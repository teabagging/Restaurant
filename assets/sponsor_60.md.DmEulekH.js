Long and narrow with exposed rafters and wine shelves everywhere - and a giant, wonderful bar.  The lighting is just right to give it that welcoming, relaxing vibe.\\n\\n\\nWe arrived on a Thursday evening not long after they opened.  We were seated immediately.  They asked if we thought we would be finished by 7pm because the table had a reservation for that time.  We said that was no problem.  I thought that was very professional of them to ask.  The table was very nice, towards the back at the end of the bar.\\n\\nOur server was Tom and he was outstanding.  He knew everything about all the menu items and had recommendations when we asked.  Cocktails were ordered and we both had Palomas.  These were scratch made and subtly flavored.  Not sweet like the ones made from grapefruit soda, but very smooth.  We started with a simple cheese dish that used the amusingly titled Hoja Santa goat cheese from the Mozzarella Company.  The goat cheese round is wrapped with the Hoja Santa leaf and then served on a bed of black eyed peas, a peppered oil and pickled jalape√±o.  The cheese is delicious spread on the provided baguette slices.  The peppered oil is very good and not too spicy.  This dish is really, really good and much better than the sum of it's parts. \\n\\nMy main dish was the Wagyu Slider with fries.  It's one of my favorite burgers in town.  It's small, but I like that - bigger is rarely better, and this is a carefully prepared small delight.  The fries are outstanding and come with house made ketchup and garlic aioli.  My wife had a shredded pork with Pappardelle pasta accompanied by Brussels sprouts and white carrots all in a savory jus.  She loved it.  I tried a piece of the pork and it was juicy and tender.\\n\\nThe Chocolate Pot au Creme called my name and it was creamy and rich.  I paired it with Cappuccino because I just couldn't get enough caffeine.  BTW the Cappuccino was very nicely prepared.  I've tried them all over town and they are rarely done properly.  This one was perfect - the milk was obviously steamed by someone who knows what they are doing.  The espresso was not overpowering which is usually what I get at other restaurants.  The wife's Poached Pear crumble with vanilla ice cream was good, but the pear was a little hard.  It was poached in wine and had a nice flavor, but needed a little more cooking time to soften it up.  This was the only misstep for the entire meal.\\n\\nA very nice meal and evening.  The total with tip was a little over $100.

We ordered the cheese plate as an appetizer, which was a little large for just 2 people but was great.  It had very good accompaniments for each cheese.  \\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the venison.  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, tender, and delicious!! It came with satueed greens, mushrooms, and a squash puree.  Everything went well together and I ate every bit.  My boyfriend got the \\"Three Little Piggies\\" which included fried pig skin, a pork sausage, and a slice of pork tenderloin.  He loved every bite as well.  \\n\\nI was pretty full by the end of the meal so I didn't order any dessert, but they brought me out a piece of the squash cheesecake with Happy Birthday written across the top in chocolate sauce.  Was delicious even though I couldn't finish it all. \\n\\nWould love to come back here for another special dinner sometime in the future.

Bittersweet. We had a few extra dining credits left on our meal plan so we decided to splurge on this place. SUCH a fantastic idea. I wish we had eaten there earlier in the week so we had time to go back again. So good! \\n\\nFirstly, I felt severely under dressed. But so is everyone else, really. I mean, it was in the 80s at Disney. I was in shorts, a t-shirt, and sweaty and doused in sunscreen. It wasn't my finest moment. But they didn't blink an eye and served us perfectly.\\n\\nOur meal plan covered two non alcoholic beverages, appetizer, entree, and dessert per person. I opted for the Orangina and a coffee. My fella went for coffee and a lemonade type drink. For appetizers I went for the Maine lobster (with saut√©ed mushrooms, mollet quail egg, creamy black truffle bouillon) which was so rich but so very good. I joked that I would like to lick the plate and the nice fellow sitting at the table next to us suggested asking for a bit of bread to sop it up. SMART. That plate left me clean. My guy got the Ahi Tuna Tartare which was also fantastic. \\n\\nFor an entree I had the grilled beef tenderloin (with a mushroom crust and bordelaise sauce) with a side of mashed potatoes. Another amazing, clean plate dish. The beef was so tender, it melted in my mouth. The mushroom crust was a lovely compliment, and the sauce? Rich and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were also incredible. Creamy and smooth. Doug got the scallops which were also fantastic but I have to say I loved mine so much that I didn't really try much of his! \\n\\nDessert? I had the meringue which was two meringue cookies sandwiched around vanilla ice cream with a side of chantilly and rapsberry coulis and topped with sorbet. So light and perfect. Sweet enough without being heavy after such a rich meal. Doug had the \\"sphere\\" which is a white chocolate sphere filled with cake and sorbet, then they dump a hot syrup over it so it melts and turns into a bowl of deliciousness. We had just gotten engaged a few days before and had our fancy \\"Just Engaged!\\" pins on so they wrote \\"Congratulations!\\" on both of our desserts. A nice touch and made the meal feel extra festive. \\n\\nNext time we make it back to Disney Monsieur Paul is definitely on our list to return to!"},{"name":"The Family Dog","address":"1402 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"My partner and I had a LONG layover (arrived in the morning and departed late at night) in Atlanta.

The burgers are just the right size and, as posters outside the store declare, are made from all-natural, pesticide- and hormone-free, some locally grown ingredients. In fact, the website reveals detailed origins of items on the menu. You have the option to get white or wheat bread (delivered fresh every other day). The milkshakes are wonderful but served in miserably tiny cups.\\n\\nSeating and ordering may be a little awkward for some people. I however, and several of my friends, love it. To order, cars and people line up outside, right next to each other. You seat yourself in an all-patio, dog-friendly, smoker-unfriendly, trees-surrounded outdoor setting. When the weather is cooperative, it's magical sitting outside and chomping down delish burgers with great company. The few times that Austin weather isn't conducive to porch-seating you get to drive yourselves back home.\\n\\nAll in all, a great \\"anti-fast-food\\" (as they like to call themselves) experience.

Drinks are expensive (popular bar things) but beers are very affordable. They also have a downstairs, where you can find the bathrooms, and another bar.

At the beginning I thought it would be fair as they had to keep the tables for customers instead of the many tired passers by that just stop without eating.   The problem is that they they have al tables \\"reserved\\" which is more like blocked unless you buy, which is not welcoming at all.  \\n\\nWhile I was ordering my party sat down and they were forced to stand up even though I was already ordering.  They were then instructed to sit in two tables, again not ideal...the last straw was when one of the persons with me pulled a chair to sit closer to her baby and one the staff members instructed (yes instructed, not requested) her not to do it .

The skirt steak was tasty, but the portion was small and also pricey at $30.\\n\\nThe waiter failed to bring our bread even though he said he was going to get it. We had to ask someone else for it.

At busy times, you'll have to try the neighborhood, but they're by a school, so...\\nATMOSPHERE: \\nFeels more relaxed than other locations. Nice place for a calm breakfast away from the insanity of other locations. For example, there's a little outdoor seating area that's not right next to the street, so it's quiet and peaceful (it's right by the parking lot, but there's a wee bit of a landscaped buffer). I'm thinking this is the biggest GCB retail space, so it feels roomy, spacious. Nice paintings, in what I think of as sort of a Portland (quirky and fun) variation of soviet worker art (art geeks will no doubt cringe and shake their heads in dismay, muttering \\"no, no, no, that's not right at all\\"). \\nMusic is awful. The stereotypical Portland garbage: moldy hits, top 40 stuff that wasn't even good when it was fresh, and now it's just a rekindled earworm of the songs you had gratefully forgotten.\\nSERVICE:\\nOrder and pick up at the counter, bus your own table. \\nLike other GC locations, they seem to dote over regulars, at the expense of people in line. Is that a GCB policy or something? Anyway, generally nice people. \\nFOOD: \\nPretty good. Simple fare, baked goods and soup/salad/sandwiches. There's no point in telling you what my faves are, because yours will vary. Nothing here is bad. But be warned, some items might be more sturdy/rustic than you're used to; this is not Hellen Bernhards. But neither is it dull lifeless heavy \\"healthy\\" food, like the dry flavorless muffin you might see at some granola co-op. GCB is indulgent, but in an adult way (I cringe when I see parents buy their kids a cinimon roll here...it's not cinibon, and I bet most kids won't like it). Main gripe is inconsistency. Some items are made literally every day, year after year after year. You'd think they'd be the same every time. It's hard to swallow the \\"artisinal\\" excuse, when GCB is nearly as big as Franz. Okay, I exagerate, but you know. Anyway, at its finest, GCB food is good enough to make me laugh, then cry, then laugh some more (which, strangely, is also how I react to really bad food).\\nTip: Best Tripple Chocolate cookie I ever had was at GCB on Weidler; worst Tripple Chocolate cookie I ever had was at Safeway a couple blocks west. I'd rather have one GCB cookie than a dozen of those execrable chocolate-flavored rubber discs they sell at Safeway. Was the fifty-cent Safeway hockey puck a good value? No. No, it was not. Unless your criteria is calories per dollar...in which case, why are you reading Yelp?   \\nPRESENTATION:\\nPretty good, although I've never cared for their cheap flatware. \\nPRICE/VALUE:\\nFair and reasonable. This is a big enterprise, and you know they do their research. They know what the market will bear, and they take full advantage of that without going overboard. However, having said that, I'm seeing some seasonal sandwiches creep over $10 (sandwich only). This isn't your forearm-sized hoagie we're talking about, and it's hard to justify that. Heck, their everyday Turkey Deluxe is $11 ($13.75 w/ chips and cookie). \\nRESTROOMS: \\nGet a key at the counter and go find the restroom outside the business, in the building lobby. \\nOVERALL: \\nSince GCB closed the Irvington location, North Fremont (not to be confused with the Beumont location on Northeast Fremont) is my home GCB. I haven't been to them all, but almost, and this is my favorite so far. \\nregarding GCB in general: They may not be the best in Portland, but I think of them as the quintessential Portland retail bakery/cafe. Yeah, they're a chain, and yeah, they were started in Seattle where they maintain a presence, but this is where I'd bring an out-of-towner who wanted a plate of Portland for breakfast or lunch."},{"name":"Windward Passage Restaurant","address":"4739 Reed Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I agree with many of the other reviewers that Windward Passage was a nice surprise.

I feel like this should be an occasional indulgence and not a place where the staff recognizes you... but they recognize me.\\n\\nThere are so many great reasons to go to JP Licks, before you even get to the ice cream. There's good coffee, a small for $1. There are yummy pastries (croissants, scones, cookies, brownies). If you like spicy things, please don't miss the Diablo Hot Chocolate. You can order a cute cow-spot-patterned ice-cream cake for your next office party. Sign up for the loyalty club and you will get a free sundae on your birthday, and earn points with each purchase for a future freebie. There are a few tables where you can sit and read; window seats for people-watching; outdoor tables in nice weather. The place can be a little overwhelming to the senses, with its astroturf walls and always-long lines and pumping loud music. But the staff are friendly, and if it all gets to be too much for you, at least you can zone out on your sugar high.\\n\\nSo, that brings me to the ice cream. A broad range of flavors and oh boy do they pack a punch. There are about a dozen \\"monthly special\\" flavors that change on the first of the month. The fall ones are the best (variations on pumpkiny and spicy things, and one based on stout). In February the focus is chocolate. March is mint/green things (including one with Thin MInt Girl Scout cookies). If you see peanut butter Oreo on the list, snap it up then and there! It might be the best thing I've ever eaten.\\n\\nEvery month they also have some frozen yogurt specials and sherbet specials, and they also just introduced a line of dairy-free ice cream with a coconut milk base. You can get your ice cream in a cup (yes they have child size), a cone, or a sundae (fun toppings like Fruity Pebbles and Cap'n Crunch). The friendly employees will gladly combine 2 or 3 flavors in the same cup if you ask. They also let you taste multiple flavors before deciding.\\n\\nOn occasion I will still go a few doors down to Baskin Robbins. Gotta be honest -- this is when I am craving salt. There is no (or very little) added salt in JP Licks' product, whereas Baskin Robbins packs a salt-sugar punch that keeps you wanting more. JPL uses almost all natural ingredients (their mint ice creams are still green, which is why I say \\"almost\\"), whereas at BR you know there is a good dose of artificial in there... that space-styrofoam texture wouldn't be possible otherwise.

I arrived before my daughter so wanting to keep it a surprise, I spoke with the hostess who told me that she would inform the server.

The meal itself was pretty good (I had the beef brisket) but there sure was not much of the beef for a 16.99 price tag. The rest of the plate was taken up by sides that were ok at best. By the end of the meal, it was clear to me that the \\"sundae\\" was not coming, so I asked the server and he offered the birthday boy one, who declined (he's pretty shy). I joked with the server a bit about no crew singing happy birthday at the table and he then informed us that it was not allowed because it \\"violated copyright laws\\". We all thought this was very, very strange. We then left.\\nthe whole incident bothered me so when I got home I called the restaurant and asked for the \\"top\\" manager. Once I got through \\"Tim\\" who apparently was a manager but not the top, I got the General Manager Janet on the phone. Once I had verified that the veteran was supposed to receive a 16.99 free entree and that they do give a free \\"sundae\\" on birthdays, I related what had actually happened. At this point there was not a drop of an apology from Janet, instead she went on to defend the hostess. Clearly the conversation was immediately adversarial and so I ended it. This am I called the corporate number (non toll free) and the operator told me the person I needed to speak with was in a meeting and nobody was there to take my call. More bad service in my eyes. I then asked for the \\"executive offices\\", only to be routed to \\"Guest Relations\\" where it was just another voice mail. In frustration I called the Tualatin location and when I spoke with the person who answered, they said they would have the district manager call me (they would give out his email but NOT his phone number). He did call and we had a nice chat. He very clearly identified that several things had gone wrong. He also identified that the server was BS'ing about the \\"copyright\\" on the birthday song part. So in the end I paid for a meal that should have been free, had the server fail to ask if there were any veterans at the table that should be honored, had the hostess forget to do what she said she would do, was then lied to by the server, and then channeled by an uncaring corporate entity. Not to mention the small amount of meat you actually got and a General Manager who has no clue about customer service."},{"name":"L'Osteria","address":"104 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Like many of the other reviews on here, this place has gone way downhill over the years.  15 years ago I used to go here weekly but stopped going when it became apparent to me that the owner did not care about her local/ regulars and only cared about the tourists.  Perhaps she forgets that Boston has a very long and tough winter.  \\n  After about 10 years boycotting this place I decided to give it another try.  Well it has gone much more downhill.  I had the Veal Parm and it was sliced so thin that the old Wendy's commercial came to mind.  \\" Wheres the Veal???\\"  The veal had so much breading on it and was so thin that I could not taste any of the veal.  Sadly, this will be my final and last time trying this place again.  Not even having Patty back on the floor is worth being ripped off and I love Patty always have.

Their Pad Thai is great but the Pad Se Ew is even better--with subtle flavors, Chinese broccoli, and none of the extra sweetness or overuse of soy sauce that can ruin a good Pad Se Ew. The service is fast and attentive. Tonight, I ordered a Thai iced tea (my first time trying it) and didn't really like the taste.

If I was a Michelin Guide reviewer I would award Monsieur Paul's three stars which means \\"Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey\\" in their standard.\\n\\nThe restaurant is well run, beautiful and owned by Jerome Bocuse, the son of famed Chef Paul Bocuse.  Jerome has worked with his staff to craft a menu that is not only a superb experience, but is also an adventure in French cuisine.\\n\\nIf you have the opportunity to eat inside Monsieur Paul's make sure you start with the St. Germain Cocktail.\\n\\nOn my last trip I started with the escargot in a bacon and cream foam.  I find that most Americans that tell me they love escargot are actually confessing to enjoying butter served at cruise ship dinners.  My escargot at Monsieur Paul's was anything but.  This appetizer celebrates the earthiness of the snail and uses the bacon and cream to enhance this French delicacy.  \\n\\nThen I was introduced to my new favorite food, Soup aux truffles V.G.E. (Beef broth, oxtail, vegetables, black winter truffle, puff pastry).  This special creation by Monsieur Paul himself is a culinary portrait of skill and elegance.  The soup is rich and transforms the guest to the French royal court.  The restaurant honors its namesake with its precise preparation of this dish.\\n\\nIf the soup was my favorite part of the food, Bouchard Pere & Fils Les Lavieres, Savigny-Les-Beaune 2011 is my new favorite wine.  This rare gem is a little known burgundy that is difficult to find, but worth the search if you are inclined.  \\n\\nThe night finished off with the Le Paris-Brest (almond puff, hazelnut cream, almond nougat one, pistachio ice cream)\\n\\nPlease treat yourself to a unique experience while you are in Florida and seek out my favorite French restaurant."},{"name":"Las Margaritas Latin Resturant Tequila & Rum Sports Bar","address":"1842 Chesire Bridge Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm tempted to give this review 4 stars.

BEST BBQ TOFU EVER. Okay, maybe that's too far. It was definitely the best I've had in a long time - definitely better than any I've had in LA. I had a side of sauteed green beans to go with it because it was my third day in the ATL and I couldn't stomach any more sweet potatoes or collard greens. The beans were cooked well - simple but good.\\n\\nThe best part of all this? My dinner came out to less than $10. Seriously, that's nuts. That's about how much a cab ride cost just to get there.

We've also tried the bolognese pasta and it was surprisingly one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The beers are a bit overpriced (they only have bottles, and not a great selection), and the sangria is tasty and fairly priced but we didn't get too much of a buzz off it. Service is super friendly, but sometimes they can be a bit slow. Also prepare to wait if you're going around peak lunch or dinner time -- even on weekdays. (They don't take reservations).

They brought out some delicious toasted Italian bread to pick out with some light olive oil and seasoning.  It was early lunch time so I had a Chicken parm Panini, we split a tortellini soup and my wife had Pasta pomodoro.  The ambiance is very nice and they did a good job of giving it that Italian market feel for sure.  The chicken parm panini was well put together and toasted perfectly. Just the right portion also, I didn't feel bloated or overly stuffed after.  The pasta was fresh and you can tell the sauce was homemade.

We'd parked on the north side of the building but didn't see the entrance and walked all the way around to what was the patio area facing the arboretum. We felt foolish walking in that way to find that we'd parked by the front door. They seemed to be used to that happening. Better signage an d proper marking would have helped. \\n\\nI don't remember our service being that great and took them awhile to get around to waiting on us even though it wasn't busy. And even though we'd not ordered much didn't really check to see if we wanted any additional items  after our first go as most sushi places have done that I've been to. The food was just sort of so-so. The only thing I can say was that the Brandy roll was just delicious. it was like a philly roll they'd tempuraed. The cream cheese was just slightly warm and gooey. Yum.  Everything else we had wasn't that great. \\n\\nI find myself craving that Brandy roll which is the only reason I'd probably ever venture back.

The second time around, since I was paying, I asked everyone at the table to please order the Kobe steak ... thinking I can impress them....but they were not happy with the expensive Kobe. The chef sliced it, maybe to hide how small the piece really was and in the proccess making the cut lose its juices. My friends asked for medium rare and it was definetely over cooked. Since I had asked mine to be \\"no salt added\\" my cut was fine, obviously the chef was paying more attention.... and in fact it was very, very tender, more tender than the Kobe I had at Grill 23.

The space is really nice has some long farm style tables and then a bunch of 4 tops. The kitchen is completely open which is pretty cool. There isn't a bar but they do have a table in the front you can sit at if you are waiting for a table.  \\n\\nThe dining format is very unique and they call it, \\"southern dim-sum\\". When you sit down you get a menu with the offerings of the day. As the chefs make the dishes they come by your table with them and explain the dish to you and then you decide if you want it or not. Every item on the menu will come by your table within an hour or so. I found it really hard to say no as all the dishes looked really good but if you are like me you will end up with a pretty expensive bill because you wanted to try so many different things. We tried:\\n\\nPork Belly - very good but when is pork belly bad?\\n\\nSquid Pancakes with a sriracha style sauce - interesting dish and pretty good\\n\\nBeef Tenderloin with pea puree - dish was ok but portion size was really small for what they charged\\n\\nCrispy Trout - One of our favorites\\n\\nGrouper with dumplings - very tasty and one of our favorites\\n\\nIndian dish with lentils and chickpeas - very flavorful dish and was not expecting this to be served here\\n\\nSquab with peaches - Only my second time having squab and we really enjoyed this one\\n\\nBeef Tongue (pastrami sandwich style) - interesting dish but basically tasted like a pastrami sandwich\\n\\nBlackberry Cobbler with Vanilla Ice Cream - great dessert\\n\\nOverall I liked all of our dishes. Some were totally worth the price and some were overpriced IMO. The presentation on all the dishes was excellent and its pretty damn cool to have a Top Chef finalist come to your table and say, \\"Tonight I prepared...\\"\\n\\nAnother important item to note is that you can bring your own beer/wine with no corkage fee. I did not know this and had a few of their wines and beers which are reasonably priced...but why pay for that when you can bring it with you and spend more on the food. \\n\\nI highly recommend checking Gunshow out.

Its located in a strip mall at 4739 Reed Rd Columbus, OH 43220. Opened in 1973. Its at the end of a strip mall and looks very generic from the outside. If you were unaware of its existence you I am sure you would drive right by. However when you walk in the front door be prepared to Enter The Twilight Zone. Time stopped here in the 70's and the original patrons are still inside. The average age of patrons I am guessing is 70 years old. Upon entering it will take a minute for your eyes to adjust as the place is dark. No windows and the walls are old dark knotty pine and adorned with nautical stuff including brass port holes, nets, lobster traps, and a bridge engine order telegraph. To the right is an elevated bar area and the bartender is in the center. Booths surround the bar and small round tables to seat two and four are scattered about. The bar area is seat yourself and to me is the best place to watch the action. Just about everyone knows everyone but you will not be made to feel as an outsider. A happy hour food area is located on the back wall. There is no rhyme or reason to the free happy hour food as I have seen everything from sliced sausage links, chicken wings, shrimp, to strange egg rolls.   Old Money Upper Arlington Ohio is the common patron with large four door Cadillac's and other large land Yachts adorn the parking lot. After all it is mostly a seafood place. \\n\\nTo the left of the entrance is the dining room. While it is better lit its still pretty dark and candles are on all tables. The staff is exactly what one would expect. Top notch and very friendly. The place is also very busy. Don't even attempt trying to go here on a Friday or Saturday and not expect to wait. Even by 5 o'clock its packed as the elderly patrons tend to start early. This includes the bar area as well. Go on a Tuesday or Wednesday about 6 and you will be able to imagine what its like on the weekend. If you like to watch and listen to people this place is as good as it gets. \\n\\nThe food is mostly seafood but steaks are on the menu which are cut to order. They are also much larger than stated. The butcher in the back has no concept of actual size. The seafood hits just about every style with raw oysters, crab legs, mussels, soft shell crab, and the fish can be cooked three ways. For example the Walleye can be fried, sauteed or broiled. All the seafood is fresh unless stated by the server. Sometimes the Walleye is not fresh and they will tell you it was frozen ahead of time. \\n\\n Side note: Steaks can be ordered Pittsburgh Style. Here is the Wiki definition:\\nA Pittsburgh rare steak is one that has been heated to a very high temperature very quickly, so it is charred on the outside but still rare or raw on the inside. The degree of rareness and the amount of charring on the outside may vary according to taste. The term 'Pittsburgh rare' is used in some parts of the American midwest and eastern seaboard, but similar methods of sear cooking are known by different terms elsewhere, including Chicago-style rare and, in Pittsburgh itself, black and blue. Ask your server when ordering. \\n\\nThe prices on the menu are way below what you would think and I have never had a bad meal or service here.\\n\\nBlue cheese dressing is as good as it gets.\\nFriday and Saturday you will find home made cinnamon rolls in the bread basket along with the bread. Why cinnamon rolls? Who cares there are good and I try to save them until the end. But I rarely do.   \\nHomemade Waldorf Salad......That's right I said Waldorf Salad and it is excellent.\\n\\nWine is way below market prices and the list is pretty good.\\nDrinks are old school and feel free to order a Martini, Manhattan, Long Island Iced Tea or a Rob Roy. Cheap prices and no short cuts. No watered down BS.\\n\\nFinally if you are older and thought all these places are gone this one remains and is standing strong. There commitment to the way things should be are the mainstay here. If you are younger and wonder what things were like back in the day that your parents and grand parents told you about you can experience it first hand.\\n\\nIf you are in the Columbus area shame on you if you don't make this a stop....Russ"},{"name":"Wonder Cafe","address":"58 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"3.5","text":"I saw all of the positive reviews and was excited to try this place out.

Knowing this is restaurant week & not realizing they were not participants we made a reservation a few days ahead on opentable. \\n\\nThey weren't very busy at all, this probably being related to our 8:30pm mid-week reservation; and therefore we were sat immediately by a friendly host. \\n\\nThe back waiter was spectacular (minus the poorly placed dump tray that remained cluttered with heaps of other tables' garbage through out the course of our meal directly adjacent to our table. I understand this is sometimes necessary but whereas the place was 1/2 empty they surely could have found a table not located next to the dumpsite)\\nOtherwise, he was spectacular- setting and clearing quickly and quietly, fast bread service and never an empty glass of H20. \\n\\nThe steak tartare and oysters were great and the porterhouse au poivre was to die for. The vanilla bean creme brulee also gets an A. \\n\\nThe other shoe dropping would be the server. She didn't arrive at our table until roughly 15 minutes after we were sat. By this time we had already selected our appetizers and our meals, then reevaluated our appetizer selection and downsized it as we were by then full from eating the entire basket of bread as we awaited service. \\nShe didn't arrive until after another table (her only other table) had been sat next to us and also waited about 5 minutes themselves. When she arrived she did apologize for the delay although her reasons will always be unknown to me as her section was empty and she appeared perfectly able bodied to. Now she had the task of waiting on both tables at once whereas had she handled us in an appropriate time frame this would not be the case. Plus her multi-tasking skills were below par. \\nShe did suggest a good bottle of wine so kudos. She tried to refuse our request for putting our appetizer order in at that same time, however. Probably because she didn't want her manager to see we were ready for everything after our wait or she just couldn't handle two things at once. That wine did not however arrive until well after the appetizers. Too bad for her because knowing my friends and I, had we started drinking sooner we'd have surely ordered a second bottle by night's end. \\nShe did appropriately guess which male guest's (c'est moi) dessert to place a birthday candle in, so that's good. \\nBut she again left us waiting way too long at the end of dessert before bringing the check and then ridiculously long thereafter before returning for the check. At this point we discovered her reasons for never being around- she was sitting gossiping in the server pantry in eyeshot of our table. We all had to glare at them for about another 10 minutes after this discovery before one caught our eye and got her attention. She rushed back after that but not without awkwardly stating as she handed us our change \\"You liked the wine, remember that!\\" As if to threaten us not to leave a poor tip or speak to her manager. We opted out of both, lucky her, however 3 of the 4 of us being in the industry, she did go from a 25% standard tip to an 18%. This service was poor for a casual dining experience; for fine dining it was dreadful.\\nTo boot our table was beneath a slow leak from the ceiling, making itself known at the end of the dinner hence explaining the wet tablecloth without any spills.\\nThe 2 stars are because the kitchen and the backwaiter deserve 5 stars.

Finally we saw that an Italian place was going up and got excited.  Who doesn't like Italian?!  As we watched in anticipation as the venue was being re-done into this very ornately decorated, European style restaurant we thought \\"oh, we definitely need to try that place.\\"  We received an ad/coupon in the mail that said a complimentary Tominata or Provoletta.  So we finally went to try this place out.  \\n\\nDecoration-wise, this place is too busy for me.  Lot's going on.  Especially the ceiling. \\n\\nService, was good.  Although our waiter I don't think was trained very well.  The way he described La Tagliatella was \\"a different type if Italian restaurant so don't expect the regular ol' Olive Garden menu...\\" that didn't come off in a good way.\\n\\nAt first glance, the menu was quite confusing.  Appetizers, salads, traditional pasta dishes, and then there was a column of pastas and a columns of sauces which we could choose to make our own dish. It was printed twice for some reason... \\n\\nThe waiter said the dish sizes were family style, meant for sharing.  So we split a salad and decided to split a pasta.  It was still wayyy too much food. We had also used the coupon for the Provoletta.  Which I would recommend not order since it's just a plate of melted cheese.... And it did not come with bread or anything, so you were just supposed to eat the melted cheese by itself.  We asked for bread to eat with is, and they charged us for that. \\n\\nOverall, I would say this place is okay.  Probably wouldn't go back though."},{"name":"Petit Robert Bistro","address":"480 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"One of the all time favorite French restaurants for a casual but delicious meal.

The last two times we went, the service was absolutely terrible. We went in March for dinner with a Scoutmob and waited at least 20 minutes to be seated, inspite of have a reservation and being on time. The food, as always, was fantastic, but they had run out  of several things we wanted, as well as the beer we wanted. Additionally, and this is the bad part, literally, everything brought to the table was wrong and took a VERY long time. The server was nice, no doubt, and the manager, was understanding when it was brought to this attention. In fact, he gave a gift certificate to come back. This was literally (not using the word incorrectly here), the only reason we decided to give it another try. So, we went for brunch. We waited a while, which was fine, since we had no reservation. We were seated outside, and remained seating, while three other tables were also seated around us. No one came and checked on us. At the end of about 10-15s mins of all tables waiting, a server finally comes out, and starts with the table at the front, not taking into consideration at all who had been seated first. We thought, fine, they are going to go down the line. Nope. A second server comes takes another tables order. Then a third server comes and skips us and takes an order from the table on  our other side! All the other tables are being checked on - badly - but still at  least being checked on. At this point we have been at the restaurant 50 mins to an hour, have been seated for 20-25 mins and yet have not placed our order. I go inside and complain to the manager, who sends two different people out, who yet again, check every table but ours. I don't know why we didn't walk out, but I wish we had. We finally got a server, who was attentive, and we were  finally able to place our order. The food was great, and they took the beer off our check, but unless something drastically changes, we will not return. This is a great pity, since the restaurant still, obviously, has good food, very cute ambience and a great neighbourhood feel.

When asked why we weren't called, she just said she forgot to call the people already waiting outside.  For a place that only seats 25 people, it is kind of hard for a hostess to be overwhelmed.  After that, the waitress forgot to bring us bread until our food was arriving and I was never asked if I wanted anything else to drink.

It was tasty and filling.\\n\\nI ordered the duck confit hash.  The leg was served on a bed of sweet potatoes with two poached eggs and a pumpkin seed sauce.  The eggs were perfectly cooked with a bright orange yolk.  Farm fresh for sure.  I needed to order one of the housemade English muffins to soak up the yolks.  My bf got the fried chicken biscuit which was basically like a Reggie Deluxe, but twice the price.  \\n\\nFor dessert the birthday girl opted for the ubiquitous warm chocolate cake served here with champagne sorbet.  I split the \\"lemon meringue pie\\" which was good but I wish the menu had said it was deconstructed, not an actual piece of pie.  Instead of pie like my grandma would make it was layered parfait style in a glass with lemon curd, shortbread crumbs, lemon sorbet and what tasted like a browned marshmallow instead of meringue.\\n\\nWe were seated in the atrium, which felt like eating in a hotel lobby - because, well, it is.  After molesting the surrounding foliage it was determined that it was plastic.

Heck, I heard the term 'jardiniere' used on the Food Network so I'm good to go.  I even bought a jar of that stuff to go (no kidding here) and poured in on everything at home (ok, not everything ... just stuff to eat).\\n\\nThey even have multigrain bread which of course means you can then have five cheeses, 4 bags of chips, 3 shakes, and a couple of cookies.\\n\\nSpeaking of cookies, the oatmeal chocolate chip is drool inducing.  Then again, I have never uttered the phrase 'I didn't care for that oatmeal chocolate chip cookie'.\\n\\nThe website is darn solid (I kept it at 'darn' for the children out there).

The menu had a good variety, but I wasn't really feelin' anything in particular. After a little while, I decided to go with the lobster ravioli. It was advertised \\"in a cream sauce, with penne pasta surrounding the ravioli.\\" So I ordered it, already sketched about the cream sauce. When it comes, I smell the oder of Mac 'N Cheese. I'm thinking \\"No way is that odor coming from my plate.\\" Sure enough, it is. I essentially get penne pasta in a cheese sauce with lobster raviolis on top, which were subpar to say the least. Needless to say, I couldn't even finish the meal because it was so salty and cheesy. If I wanted mac 'n cheese, I would have ordered that. I wanted lobster ravioli, so I could taste the lobster, but because of the thick, salty cheese sauce, that wasn't possible. Point of story, DO NOT GET THE LOBSTER RAVIOLI!\\n\\nDrinks were fairly priced and the service was good tho. Don't know about the other food, but the fact that I couldn't even finish the meal brings this review to 3 stars. If the food was better, it would have been 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake that 2 Stars. I'm editing this the day after. I had a horrible night sleeping, kept waking up with a stomach ache.

After each bite, \\"juice\\" flowed out of my bao bao, getting all over my plate and fingers. The \\"juice\\" was very oily... The flavor of the pork filling was average. There are condiments available like siracha you can add if you want.\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't come here again and definitely would not pay $3.25-4 for a single bun.

We chose this well know steak house as our place for dinner on New Year's Eve. When we arrived for our 8:15 reservation we were told it would be about ten minutes. Turned out to be more like 30. Dinner was a set price of $75/person for which we expected a good meal. Granted all the courses were pretty good but not spectacular. Three of us ordered ribeyes. My friend was brought out a New York strip. When we told the runners they insisted it was a ribeye. Then the waiter took it back to the kitchen. The cook insisted it was just a weird cut of ribeye! No, it was a strip, we've grilled many a ribeye. The waiter then brought her a ribeye that was apparently ready!! It was over cooked but she didn't want her sides to get cold, so she accepted it.

The space and is absolutely gorgeous. Warm lighting, lots of beige and ivory, and a great wine cellar in the basement. The concept is cool too: an upscale steakhouse with quality steak and classic preparations.\\nI can't say I didn't like the food that Mooo offers, but I simply cannot justify the prices. Usually, I really REALLY don't care too much about prices, not because I have money to throw away, but I simply love good food and understand that you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, that's not what happened at Mooo.\\nThe first time I went was for lunch and I got a small dry piece of salmon. It was 24 bucks. The second time I went, I gave in and got the steak frites. Steak was good, but a common overuse of truffle oil drenched the fries... As usual, when truffle oil is employed chefs like to throw it in your face. I get it. It was 28 dollars. The third time was the cincher. Ordered Lobster Mac and Cheese, a dish I'm very familiar with, being from Maine. There was almost NO lobster and too much cream. When all was said and done, the two of us spent nearly two hundred dollars and each only had one dish. This is due to the fact that their wine prices are OUTRAGEOUS. (Average 14 dollars a glass and nothing to write home about). The other kicker is that it's 18 bucks to valet your car. No thank you.\\nAll in all, beautiful space, overpriced, over hyped.

I know my limits and conduct my behavior accordingly. So the last 5 times I've been to Phnom Penh we have not gotten in. Three times due to long lines and twice because the restaurant was closed for vacation. So when a friend suggested PP for lunch I thought sure . As long as the lineup is not to long. \\nMy other concern was our size. It was going to need to be a strictly Pho outing. Two is not a crowd and for ala carte dining you need a crowd. So please keep in mind this meal was going to be strictly soup. \\n\\nNot bad. Small line up. Looked to be about 20 minutes . I can do that without getting pissy with strangers. And sure enough we were seated in 20 minutes.\\nSkipped my usual perusal of the menu and went right to soup. I settled on the #5 which described a bowl of broth complimented by pork, prawns, beef, tendon and pork innards. Those words exactly!\\nMy friend went for the number #9 which centered around a beef ,carrot and tomato broth with large pieces of stewed beef. \\nBoth came quickly and mine was  as described . A hearty piping hot bowl of beef broth strewn with bits of pork blood, fatty and lean beef, lean and fatty pork and other things I could not identify with any certainty but were lovely all the same. Broth was fragrant, slightly sweet and not as salty as most. Something was amiss.  It lacked the power of a great 5 star broth. Could I be missing MSG?!! \\nNow I have eaten many many a bowl of pho in my life as my list can attest to. And this one was good. Very good. But not the best I have had this year, let alone in my life. There are better bowls within throwing distance of Kingsway and Vic. \\n\\nMy friends meal was the real star of the duo. A rich and hearty broth of indescribeable complexity. I had never had a bowl of anything to compare it to so I will not try. It did have the power lacking in the last bowl but that's not enough. Lets just say it was really good. The quantity of stewed beef and large flavorful chunks of carrots were surprisingly generous for its alarmingly low price of $8 dollars. In fact both bowls were large and plentiful in all ingredients and should be noted for their incredible value. \\n\\nOne note. we asked for Sriracha . What we got was not Sriracha . In fact its taste was was not at all similar . It might have been an inferior brand and had a much rawer taste than Sriracha.

So my heart always skips a beat whenever I spy a restaurant claiming to specialize in cuisine from that part of the world.  Into Redd's I went when I saw how they promoted themselves outside.\\n\\nAnd...my heart, having skipped a beat, sank as my meal went on.  Calling the menu offerings \\"Southern\\" was a stretch at best.  (Monkfish osso buco?  O kee...)  I was encouraged by seeing that hush puppies were available;  however, nothing stood out about them whatsoever.  Not that they're anything much more than small globes of corn meal to begin with - but at Redd's that's ALL they were.  Redeeming this almost 100% was the awesome onion/bacon ragout.  I could've gone through a whole tub o' that stuff.\\nOn to the entrees.  The one and only dish that seemed to call out \\"Hey y'all\\" was the one featuring grits, so I went for it.  Saying \\"meh\\" would be kind.  Atop and around the brick of grits (hardest I've ever eaten) were some dollops of caramelized onions,  various veggies, and still more onions in the form of what shakes out of a Durkee's can.  Here again a particular feature came to the rescue, almost.  The blend of tastes and textures created by the differing portions of onion melded really well with the other veggies and the grits brick.  But the rescue fell shorter that time around, 'cause several forkfuls of grits gave away how they'd been prepared.  Yup, I got some hits of the unmistakable taste of - ACKKKKK - charcoal lighting fluid. \\n\\nThe third reluctant star for this review is given thanks to the waitstaff.  I ate at the bar since I was traveling solo, and the bartender was appropriately cordial (neither \\"strictly business\\" nor wanting to be your next BFF.)  Better still, the two servers delivered on Redd's intention to make their house welcoming to anyone who walks through the door.  Another man at the bar proved to be what the special-ed professionals term \\"high functioning\\" - capable of most simple day-to-day things without assistance but, you know, \\"special.\\"  They cheerfully engaged him in a lengthy conversation and made him feel the way any customer would want to.   That is to say, they appreciated his patronage and encouraged him to stay for as long as he liked.  And they did it without being fawning and smarmy.  Hiring \\"people persons\\" to work the front of the house should be a no-brainer for a restaurateur.

Everything else looked stale or unhealthy. They generously added additional vegetables and asked if I wanted my box filled with more noodels since I wasn't getting a salad. Not sure how salad and related cold items go with hot Asian food. I was disappointed at the sauce selection. Only two, plus soy and siracha. I opted for no additional sauce since they are were unhealthy with mayo or other adverse items. When I reheated my food at home (and added some flavorings since everything was oily and bland) I realized how greasy the noodles were - and I believe it was just an overzealous amount of sesame oil at that.\\n\\nPRICE: A little overpriced for carryout Asian food. \\n\\nLOCATION and ATMOSPHERE: the location is okay, there is parking available.

In this case, I really just want to discuss the service. The food was excellent - but when paying over $100/pp, it should be better than Olive Garden.\\n\\nI think there were a couple factors at play with the service tonight. It appeared that our server had at least 8 tables and he barely spoke any English. We were seated at 8:30 and he came over right away to take our drink order. There was no greeting, he didn't describe any specials or recommend any wine, he didn't even tell us his name. He just asked what we wanted to drink. After bringing us our $18 cocktails, he disappeared for a half hour. \\n\\nAt around 9:05, a bus boy came over and asked if anybody had taken our order yet. I said no, and he clearly looked concerned and went to find our waiter. Our waiter came over, didn't say anything, just held his notepad and looked at us. \\n\\nThe food was brought out by a couple runners, but they placed the entrees and side dishes on the table and just walked away. At every other steak house I've been to, they usually ask you to cut into the steak to ensure it's cooked properly; they also traditionally serve each patron a portion from the a la carte sides. \\n\\nAfter we finished eating, we just sat and waited until somebody noticed that we were ready to be cleared. I debated not getting dessert since I figured that would be another hour of my life I could never get back. Since I love cake like a fat kid loves cake, I had to order something. Surprisingly, dessert was served without a hitch and I promptly paid the bill. \\n\\nAll in all, I just felt like they didn't want us to be there. There was just a strange vibe from the moment we checked in to the moment we got our coats. Nobody even wished us a good night as we walked out. The best service we had was from the valet attendants.\\n\\nTruthfully, the only reason I picked Grill 23 was because it was the only upscale restaurant on OpenTable with availability tonight.

For the main course, I ordered the lamb chops. They were a lot bigger than I had imagined so I would pay attention to their sizes when ordering.The lamb chops actually turned out really good and pretty much cooked right to perfection, where the meat wasn't too chewy or too soft. The Grill 23 Tots are a must if you order sides. Ultimately I think the best part of the meal were their desserts. Everything, and I mean everything looked good on their dessert menu. I would have probably ordered everything off their dessert menu except they had about ten different desserts (eating so many would probably not be possible :) On one final note, I would like to praise their staff for their service and attentiveness.

The poached eggs were served on a deliciously, soft biscuit topped with pimento cheese and turkey bacon and hollandaise sauce. The garnished it with basil and this made a world of difference. Nice touch with the basil. \\n\\nWe both had potatoes and grits for our sides. The grits were dangerously delicious and creamy with cheese and the potatoes were well seasoned and had some crisp and crunch which I loved. The jam that is given with the biscuit taste homemade.

Me and 11 of my guy friends stopped into Blackstone Grill last night around 9:30 or so as our first stop of the night to kickoff my Bachelor Party. Between the 12 of us, we had all had 2 beers each prior to getting there - that's it. We're all around 30 - not amateurs here so this is where I'm confused.  We were looking for food to get started so we walked in, headed to the back and were looking at Menus, talking, and having a good time.  Next thing I know, we're told that they can't serve us because we were too drunk... I've been a bartender myself, so I understand when that becomes necessary, but no one was even remotely buzzed at that point.  We hadn't even asked to order anything - I was just hungry since we drove into Boston from Westford.  Instead, we were asked to leave.

We only had their drinks (a coffee and a london fog), whose taste/quality compares to what you can get in Second Cup in Quebec (a chain coffee shop, that is literally the closest comparison I could come up with). \\nTheir chocolate (which they do not make themselves) has some exciting variety to it, so this is a place to get your fix of fancy chocolate as a reward to yourself after a stressful time. Some flavours I can remember are champagne with butter cream and kirsch liquor. I will go back for those.\\nWe didn't try their gelato, but as I said they don't have anything that would keep you from going to Rocky Point instead, unless you live nearby and don't want to go the distance.\\nBut gotta give it up to this business for having affogato and alcoholic coffees.\\nTheir desserts looked quite attractive, but then Casa del Pane is right at the opposite, I went there for my dessert, because I wanted a smaller portion. You can get your dessert here if you are craving for something sweet in large amounts.\\nThe interior also has nothing architecturally attractive to it, we preferred to sit outside.\\nIn conclusion, you can come to this place if it is convenient for you to go with a friend for its proximity after a long day, as in when you aren't looking for a fulfilling or unforgettable culinary experience or a fancy place to satisfy a need to be in a good looking surrounding."},{"name":"BB Rover's Cafe & Pub","address":"12636 Research Blvd, Ste B101","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Pleasant surprise.

The location is Fairbanks Ave., just a few blocks West of Park Ave (between Ravenous Pig and Fiddler's Green, if you will). It's the old Lee's Liquors apparently...\\n\\nUpon arriving, it was quickly evident that WPFC is going for the beach shack/fish market motif. A pervasive nautical theme runs throughout the establishment, beginning with outdoor shack style patio/seating area that is intermittently covered by sheets of aluminum and wood. There's a beautiful fountain in the entryway, which I found charming.\\n\\nThe interior is something at which to marvel. It's a mash-up of a fish market, with a display case of chilled fish and a large wooden counter top, and a cozy dining room with nestled booths and tables, all within the space of a couple hundred square feet. The decor itself is impressive... It's well thought out, with just the right amount of boating equipment, sea-faring memorabilia and iconic kitschy-ness that you'll think you're at the coast of a hip city. Here, the ambience is enchanting as opposed to obnoxious (think clutter on the walls/ceiling of a TGI Fridays.) As for the other aspects of the interior, I haven't seen such perfect balance of color, lighting, building materials (brick/wood/tile/metal work), and props in recent memory. One vintage TV set overhead was showing a classic film about ocean life, in B&W. Very cool.\\n\\nThe menu is replete with a host of typical seafood fare, while offering more types of fish than most restaurants around here. There were many other interesting creations as well, including fish wraps referring to a 'cones'. I opted for something simple--a salmon burger with fries and cole slaw ($8.50). It was a perfectly sized and cooked slab of fish. The cole slaw was about the best I've had. My friend got something called the Grouper Cheeks, a parchment wrapped cut of fish with seasonings, with couscous and vegetable. He loved it!\\n\\nStaff is very friendly and tries to ensure your experience was pleasant. Multiple people passing by our table asked if we needed anything. We spoke to the owner(?) for a few moments, and he was polite and attentive as well. \\n\\nTo reiterate: 5 stars for atmosphere, hospitality, menu choice, quality and taste of food, and novelty.

It's the hippy epicenter for Austin, complete with yoga classes, a macrobiotic restaurant, a culinary school and plenty of foliage.  When my friend first told me about this place, I wondered how in the heck she found it.  But boy, am I glad she did.  \\n\\nFirst, a little terminology.  This restaurant is a Vegan Macrobiotic restaurant.  What does that mean?  Well, vegan means no animal products.  So no dairy, no honey, no meat.  Macrobiotic is a little more difficult to define, but it mainly means eating with the seasons, eating more simply and eating a very balanced plate.  The dinner plates here typically contain beans, greens, grains, salad and some sort of fermented pickle.  The plate isn't going to have lots of sauce and decoration, but will be tasty and is designed to nourish the body, mind & soul.\\n\\nThe dinner plates are $12 apiece, you bus your own table and you will have the most interesting random conversations with people there.  If you're going, I highly recommend sitting at one of the long family-style tables and just talking to the people there.

This little gem was fried and presented with a sauce that was light and refreshing.\\n\\nThe second course was escargots in puff pastry with king oyster mushrooms and a mushroom pur√©e.   This small earthy present was filled with six large escargots and packed with the mushrooms.  The plate is finished off with fresh greens and three different accoutrements of p√¢t√©, potato, and a tangy orange bell pepper sauce whose acid pairs well with this robust dish. \\n\\nWhile savoring my second course my wife enjoyed the whipped cheese verrine, poached pears, and caramelized pecans with a mix of red lettuce and dill greens.  These flavors were rich and sweet which balanced the intensity of the salad.  \\n\\nThe third course of the tasting menu was a sqaub that was crispy outside and delicate and juicy inside. This dark meat course is an unexpected delicacy served medium-rare like a fine filet.  \\n\\nThe fourth course was a Chardonnay granita. This partially frozen palette cleanser was a delightful break in the menu.  \\n\\nNext, course five was a duo of venison.  The loin was served medium that didn't need a knife to cut.  The companion on this plate was ground venison, crusted in bacon and served crispy.   The rich meat was soft as butter and the crisp ground venison were a perfect contrast.   \\n\\nThe sixth course was a cheese plate and Monsieur Paul's never disappoints.   The Munster was soft with hints of butter and cream.  The bleu cheese was bloomy and pungent in a way that contrasted nicely with the richness of the previous courses.  \\n\\nFinally, course seven was Le Moelleux, a warm almond cake with a creamy chocolate center and a hazelnut ice cream. \\n\\nDinner was topped off with a fine cup of French pressed coffee and a fireworks display that never disappoints.  \\n\\nWhat Chef Nicolas does in the kitchen transports you directly to Lyon's finest restaurants.

The times I've eaten at Byblos I've been treated to what I'd consider 'dry' service, but that doesn't equate bad. Let's put it this way - the waiter/host I've had three times now was consistent. I wouldn't call him a buddy, but I'd trust him to bring me the previously mentioned delicious morsels. So I consider us on good terms.\\n\\nTheir location is somewhat strange, and the interior looks like a hotel banquet hall - I find myself surprised that such a place is in Norwood center, but it doesn't deter me from doing what I came to do - devour all of the delicacies placed before me. \\n\\nAs everyone has said (and it's something that bears repeating because I'm in full agreement), the hummus is very weak.

The meal is served in several courses and you really should just take your time to enjoy them all: lentil soup, salads (with bread), entree, B'stilla Royale, tea. \\nWe have had both the lamb and the chicken here and can easily say that both are wonderful. Soft and tender it melts in your mouth and there is enough food that you are sure to not leave hungry.

We often bring a couple of bottles of a real strong beer (think Chimay or Boulevard Smokestacks) and grab a cigar to sit there and chat all night while the bacchanalia on 6th happens around us.\\n-YOU CAN SMOKE INDOORS.  As a former cigarette smoker I remember what it was like back in the day...but now that its banned almost everywhere, its sort of a cool feeling to enjoy a smoke inside.\\n-Great prices, and great selection for those looking for a great cigar or those just wanting a nice flavored beginner smoke.\\n\\nCONS:\\n-Indoor smoking...other side to the coin is that if you go here early in the night, you will absolutely radiate cigar smoke until said clothes are dry cleaned.  I totally don't see this as a problem but I know some might.\\n-Lots of touristy people stand in the window and stare at the smokers and rollers.  Again, I don't care, but I know others get a little sketched out when a 40 something UT mom walks by and cranes her nose at the heathens smoking tobacco.\\n-Location on 6th street can either be totally perfect or really really terrible (especially if its crazy mania bar night and you have to park in another zip code to get to it)\\n\\nAll in all, this is one of those places that I require we visit when we take our weekenders to the fine city of Austin."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We had a great dinner here.  I am not a fan of stuffy steakhouses.  Luckily, Mooo is far from stuffy - It has a great modern ambience.  I'm also not a big steak eater, and was relieved that Mooo's seafood options were also actually really good.  We started with the Seafood Sampler which included lobster claws, oysters, clams, shrimp, which were good, and some lump crab that was too dry.  The Wagyu dumplings were a fan favorite - definitely get these.  For my main I ordered the butter poached lobster, which was a very large portion and served over vegetables.  I appreciated the fact that it wasn't the usual steakhouse version of grilled lobster dipped in butter and was much more moist.  Others did order the steak, including the sirloin, the ribeye and the filet mignon, and everyone enjoyed their meat.  The bone marrow butter was very rich.  We also ordered a bunch of sides including steamed asparagus, exotic mushrooms, mac n cheese, and potato gratin - but the favorite was the onion rings.  Finally, the wine selection was excellent.  Overall, a great night out."},{"name":"Siam Thai Restaurant","address":"123 Sycamore St","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"I've only eaten here once, but I like real Thai food - spicy, rich, served in bowls that you share and this was not it.

Curry served american style on individual plates with rice sitting half into sauce instead of a separate dish.  They also brought our appetizer before our drinks which is a huge pet peeve of mine.

The food was a real disappointment and the service, while friendly, was so full of hovering and pushing us to order that it made us feel that we were welcome to leave any time. \\n\\nWe thought that we'd start with a bottle of wine. The price was $46 a bottle across the board, so I took a quick check of one of the wines to see if it had good reviews. Not particularly impressed by what I saw, I used my BC Liquor Store app to check the price in the store: $13.99! Now I understand that a substantial markup is part of the deal when you buy wine in a restaurant, but this is on a scale that I found shocking. They are selling a run-of-the-mill wine as something special. \\n\\nI was looking forward to an interesting starter from this self-proclaimed \\"Chinese Fusion\\" restaurant. What I found was... 5 different kinds of sliders?! I ordered one and found it okay, but the bun was fried and sweet, which I was not keen on. It turned out that the whole meal was deep-fried wherever possible. Even a dish that was supposed to be pan-fried was deep-fried (to be fair, the server warned us of this ahead of time). \\n\\nWe both felt unwell by the time we left; it got worse over the next few hours, and we didn't feel better until the middle of the next morning. \\n\\nEven without the aching bellies, we did not enjoy the food. \\n\\nJust as bad was the service. We were seated by a friendly server, who then proceeded to visit our table at what seemed like two-minute intervals: \\"ready to order?\\", \\"ready to order yet?\\"  We knew that they were expecting a large party, and it seemed that they wanted us to hurry up and order so they would have the kitchen free when the group showed up. After three-such inquiries, we were then visited by the manager, who asked the same question! \\n\\nOn three different occasions, the server actually stood on the stairs a few feet away and stared at us when our starter and main plates were nearly empty, hovering, then sweeping in the moment she thought we were done. We once had to tell her please to put the plate back because we were still eating. \\n\\nIf you want a good fusion restaurant in the same area, try Wild Rice.

He ordered the Potato Lace Wrapped Salmon, and I had the White Wine Braised Leg of Rabbit. His salmon was cooked perfectly, and the braised rabbit came out piping hot and very flavorful. Both of our colorful veggies and potatoes were savory and delicious. Service was very attentive, and the waitress was very educated on the nightly specials along with the rest of the dinner menu. The total for our dinner with tip was $85.50. \\n\\nThat brings me to where my experiences here have left me wanting more.  To drop that kind of cash on a Tuesday night dinner, I would expect some better seating than some cheap hard ice cream parlor chairs.  The ambiance for the evening was equivalent to bellying up to the deli counter at Kroger with the bright white lights glaring from the meat case, humming refrigerators, grocery store walls, and noisy open kitchen.  To me this theme just doesn't fit with the price and quality of the food being served. Also, I fail to see the reason to charge an $8.00 corking fee to serve your own wine.  Come to think about it, I should not have tipped on the full amount of the bill because because it included the corking fee (which is a tip itself) and the wine (which was already charged the corking fee).\\n\\nSecond, being an Italian Village resident I have found the grocery to be of little to no use.  It would be far too expensive to walk to The Market Italian Village each night and pick up all your items to make dinner at home; This is what they advertised themselves to be for the walking neighborhood residents.  Almost all of the items on the shelves are of the highest quality and price.  Although I do appreciate the availability of these types of items, realistically these are not what the majority of the local public will be cooking with on a daily accord. Also, they are missing many staple items necessary to cook at home.\\n\\nThird, After being open for a while their point of sale system and staff education has been abysmal. There has only been twice I have not been charged sales tax for my grocery items. I have brought this to management's attention multiple times with sincere apologies, but last week when I bought milk the clerk argued that products with sugar get charged tax. That's supposed to be sugar added beverages, not natural sugars. Regardless, the point of sale system has not had the attention it needs to avoid these awkward and vexing conversations.\\n\\nAll in all I love the concept of our new corner market, and I look forward to seeing how it will grow in the future.  I will be back!"},{"name":"Sonic Drive-In","address":"6208 Cameron Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"I have been going to the sonic for over 10 years. After the renovation, they have lost me forever as a customer. The way they made the new monitors and menus so close to the curb, you can't even pull your vehicle up to utilize the touch screen. When you do order, it takes five minutes for someone to get back to you and then they say they cannot hear you. If you pay with a credit card, you may have to open your door and get out to swipe it because of how close the curb is to the actual touchscreen and Card acceptor. It's not like I drive a huge SUV. These are all relatively annoying inconveniences, but having to wait 25 minutes to get my food is unacceptable. I have been there three times since they reopened, and all three times I have been incredibly frustrated and disappointed with both the of the food, The lack of functionality with the new touchscreen and ordering system, and the long wait time. On my first trip back, I waited 10 minutes for just an iced tea. I am done with this place even though it is less than a half a mile away.

I was happy with filling amount for the pork, veggie, and chicken bao, the ones we tried. I love the puffy bao dough and would probably eat it by itself so maybe I'm not the one to critique the filling ratio. I think the filling is going to vary in general just because these are handmade and hand filled. The pork bao was very yummy and juicy, i really enjoyed the veggie too. The veggie had the most filling, a tasty mixture of diced greens, scallions, tofu. When i come again I'll probably get a big plate of pork and veggie bao.

They manage to be a neighborhood bar, a dining destination, a place to start your night, a restaurant to bring you 'rents, a date spot, a night cap and a great bunch place all in one. It seems that other establishments try, but end up looking confused. Here, an admittedly lengthy review of Temple's well-blended personalities.\\n\\nNeighborhood Bar: Situated between Porter and Harvard, Temple is one of those places you can stop in, any time, saddle up to the bar have a beer. Or a scotch. Or a well-made yummy cocktail. Ad an appetizer and your set. It's casual. It's close. And it's not pricey!\\n\\nDinner Time: I've had a few dinners at Temple Bar and have yet to be disappointed. Something for everyone, fresh flavors, truffled pizzas, fondue! The service is down-to-earth and the portions are just right.\\n\\nStart Here: On your way out, have a drink in your neighborhood and then head to the city. Chances are the drinks will be cheaper here and you can always grab a small plate to get some num in your tum to soak up all the alcohol later in the night.\\n\\nParental Approved: If you have old-fashioned parents, price-conscious parents, picky eater parents, hard-to-please parents, you'll do fine here. They'll love the neighborhood charm!\\n\\nDate Night: First or one of many, Temple Bar is a great for a date. It's not too loud, the lighting is dimmed to the optimal level and there is more than booze to get you in the mood (or help you forget...if it's been that kind of night).\\n\\nThe Night Cap: Yes they stop serving at 1am, so if you're ending your night early (hey-it happens) stumble into Temple for that last hurrah and then stumble home. I've done this more than once. And loved it every time.\\n\\nSunday Funday Brunchday. Egges Benedict with chorizo. It's comfortable, lazy Sunday atmosphere with food that makes you feel a lot better than you look (hooray for hangovers).\\n\\nAnd, weather permitting, you can do all of this on their mini patio!"},{"name":"Byblos Restaurant","address":"678 Washington St","city":"Norwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Scrumtrillescent.  I know Will Ferrell made up that word, but it's the best one I can think of to describe this place.  It is my favorite restaurant and it's an excellent place to take out of towners--especially folks with unique dietary needs (vegetarian, gluten issues, etc.) because they have significant variety to suit most appetites.  \\n\\nLet's start with the pickles.  I am a fiend for these.  They are turnips steeped in homemade brine, with olives and hot peppers. They come with fresh pita slices.  I always ask for refills on these because they are ADDICTIVE.\\n\\nNext, the artichoke.  The folks at Byblos have managed to turn the already yummy artichoke into a thing of perfection. It's perfectly steamed--I suspect some kind of pressure cooking, actually, because it is so juicy and tender--with lemon juicy, olive oil, and gorgeous fresh garlic.  This is by far my favorite thing on the menu.  I have even come here on holidays when they have a set mezze menu and I beg for it.  They have always accommodated me because everyone there is super nice and awesome.\\n\\nMy husband and I eat here a lot and over the years we've probably had most of the menu.  I have never been disappointed--everything is exquisite and worth any kind of wait because it's fresh and homemade.  If you are expecting somekind of greasy kabob palace, this is not the kind of place for you. It's a lovely restaurant serving authentic Lebanese cuisine (Get that?

So, there's no assembly line to follow along and have to repeat your order to 5 different people.  Beginning to end - same guy.  Easy.  Also - they have a wonderful menu of sandwiches, mainly named after streets in Boston.  Each one is numbered, so if you don't like saying \\"I'll have the Tremont Street\\" you can just say \\"Number 23\\".  The subs have a good amount of meat and stuff in them, but not overwhelmingly so.

We had the Parlour Platter, the Cook's Platter, medium combo plate, and all you can eat popcorn shrimp.  No complaints and plenty of food.  Though most of it was fried, it was not and did not taste greasy.  The waitress was attentive and brought us numerous helpings of hush puppies.  After the meal we took time to  look closer at the signs.

Erin worked with me to find out what would make my stay enjoyable and went out of her way to make things comfortable for me.

Not so much.\\n\\nFOOD: Subpar. My bagel was dry and bland, and they refused to toast it for me after handing it over, even though I had asked for it to be toasted. The squash soup was really sweet. Like, really, really, really sweet. I got through about half of my bagel and cup of soup and gave up. The latte was okay, but for $3.50 I did expect it to be better than it was.\\nSERVICE: They don't know what they're doing, and the reason for that is because Panera Cares is attempting to revamp the restaurant routine. A routine, by the way, that everyone is used to, everyone knows, and generally works well everywhere else. There were about a dozen employees milling about confusedly. I gave my order to not one, but three, separate people. They took my money and then gave me back exact change for the entire amount and told me I had to put my cash in a glass box next to the cashier (?Why?). I got my bagel first, waited, got my latte next, waited, and then finally got the soup. All three items were room temperature by the time I got them. Panera Cares has not worked out a routine, and their revamping efforts are a terrible misfire.\\nATMOSPHERE: It is a pretty nice, clean little restaurant. I did appreciate that. However, when I needed to use the restroom before I left, I had to find their manager, who walked me over to the bathroom and opened it for me with her personal key. That is the bathroom routine. I'm pretty sure I haven't been escorted to the bathroom since grade school, and certainly wasn't wanting or needing an escort this time around.\\n\\nPanera- go back to square one.

(BTW, if you want the best Szechuan-style string beans anywhere, go check out Chilli Garden in Medford-- wow!)  The veggies are indeed fresh at Wonder Cafe.\\n\\nWhat kicks this place up a notch, though, are the people working there.  The first time I ordered here, I called ahead, and after speaking with the woman on the phone, I said to myself \\"wow, what a nice person\\".  She said \\"I noticed that you didn't order any rice.  Some people don't order rice because they don't know we have brown rice.  Is that why you didn't order any?\\"  And, yes!  That's why I didn't order any originally.  When I went in on another occasion, I recognized the voice of the person from the phone, and she introduced herself as \\"Liz\\".

The food was great, which is to be expected with a kitchen full of world-class chefs who take pride not only in their food, but in being a part of this restaurant's team.\\nThere are two glaring draw backs here though. The big problem is that idea does not work for larger groups (anything more than 4 people.) Lots of tapas style restaurants are great for bigger groups, even as many as 10 or 12 people. Gun Show isn't. I literally left there still hungry. Guests are expected to share the foods they chose while doing so leaves each person (in a larger group) with one or two bites. Again, the food is amazing. Every morsel is mouth-watering and cooked perfectly. This is especially impressive considering they are continuously making every item on the menu and rotating it around the dining room. I just didn't get enough of it. My cut on a six person meal was over $100 and I left there still hungry. That is a red flag. It's either a price issue or portion issue, or maybe a little of both.\\nThe other, more minor issue that I have, is the atmosphere. I'm a young adult myself, but I don't like the new trend of putting restaurants in loud, echo-y, spaces with high ceilings. I do like the open kitchen, which is probably necessary for the execution of their concept, but it was SO LOUD that I couldn't hear the people at my table who were just a foot or two away. My parents, who are in their 60's, dined with us and they were really annoyed and frustrated with the noise.\\nObviously I would love to eat the food again, but I'm not sure when. I wouldn't take a date there because of the noise. I wouldn't go again with a large group. And if I were in the mood to be in a place louder than most bars, well I would probably just go to a bar.

If you want to throw a party or have an intimate dinner, there are a few options for private rooms...just be sure to call ahead (few weeks at least).\\n\\nPardon my not remembering anything about the sides except that they were likely quite yummy, but I try to keep focused when I'm at a steakhouse...on the meat that is.\\n\\nI'm sure that you'll enjoy most of anything that you have at Grill23 unless you're a healthy loser and opt for seafood at the place that is known for their grilled meats (no, shrimp doesn't qualify as meat).\\n\\nI can personally vouch for these two dishes: \\n\\nDRY-AGED RIBEYE 16OZ (46)\\n\\nKOBE CAP STEAK 10OZ (59)\\n\\nBoth were fabulous. You will enjoy the rich, juicy-ness of the ribeye and the creaminess of the kobe cut. If you're more of a NY person then these might be too fatty for you - but I can promise that it'll melt in your mouth.\\n\\nSo, if you're looking for a place to grab a couple cocktails before sitting (great bar in the entrance), have a nice meal and a glass of wine (or two), try Grill23.

To kick things off we had their complimentary rolls. WOW, they were absolutely divine. Fluffy, slightly sweet and offset perfectly by the course salt and kick of honey dusted over the tops. I had the steak tartare and my friend got the bisque, as appetizers. My tartare was wonderful (though a minor gripe I have is the way they present it, like it had just been squished into a mold. I think food like that is better when presented a little more organically) and my friend thoroughly enjoyed the bisque. We each ordered the sirloin- he got his medium and mine was medium rare. Each was cooked perfectly and the marrow butter really did amazing things for the flavor. Typically when you order a sirloin you don't expect anything out of this world but it really was delicious, tender, and juicy. The truffled frites that came with the steak were interesting and quite tasty, and the way they're served in a paper cone in a tiny pot was a cute touch.To finish things off we got coffee and tea, I had the white chocolate and citrus cheesecake and my friend had the brownie sundae.

Under cooked, under salted, crunchy black beans and under cooked, under salted, crunchy rice.  Pico de gallo without the pico, guacamole without garlic, thick sub-par tortilla chips, and boring luke warm queso...  you get the picture.  Dumb down food for people that don't like too much flavor.  Surprisingly, Z Tejas comes with some built in attitude on the menu (vs. the service, which was excellent).  No cheese enchiladas, no pinto beans and \\"we don't have pickled jalapenos.\\"  Unfortunately, the food didn't come out as lofty as the aspirations.\\n\\nMargaritas were the typical let down (what is so hard about making a drink with three ingredients?).  The unwelcome trend of adding agave nectar to skimp on Cointreau was in full effect at Z Tejas.  So, if you ask for a real Margarita with no sweet & sour or, um, agave nectar,  it will come out with little Cointreau and the same amount of lime juice.  In other words, super tart and lacking balance (and I like 'em tart, it's a tart drink).  And since the drink is so watered down you can't really taste any Tequila or Cointreau - it tastes like lime & water.  To be fair, El Meson on South Lamar, one of my favorites, is guilty of the same trend.  Maybe I should type up a recipe for a Margarita and give it to the server:  2oz silver agave tequilla, 1oz Cointreau, 1 whole lime.

We were very hungry so it looked good, the meat was well seasoned, the mashed potatoes as well. However the entire meal was cold. The butter didn't melt on the baked potatoes, the mashed room temp.

Although I don't normally buy meat from here, as it is more expensive (given the quality), they sell 2 for $3 burger patties seasoned with Jacobsen Salt.

The best way to describe this restaurant is the way the host described it to us: Redneck dim sum.  Servers come by with different dishes and describe them to you. If you are interested in the dish, they set it down and check off the item on the menu, just like a dim sum restaurant. The only difference is that the servers are actually the chef/cook that made the dishes. On top of that, the restaurant would occasionally invite a top chef to cook at their restaurant, aka \\"the hired gun\\".\\n\\nFor those from the SF Bay Area, the concept may remind you of one of the most popular restaurants of The City in the past 5 years: State Bird Provisions. You also may not be wowed by the dishes, which you can easily find offered by local food trucks. I have to somewhat agree. But what makes Gunshow a standout is the overall experience.

It seems I am definitely in the minority here, though.  Started out dinner with the fried calamari.  Not bad, pretty good actually for a steak place.  Had a wedge salad which was drenched, DRENCHED, in dressing.  I couldn't even tell it was a wedge salad.  I could see two tiny corners of green; everything else was white.  I should've definitely asked for dressing on the side.  I chose the filet mignon for the entree since it's my favorite at Fleming's.  Wow.  I asked for something between medium and medium well (which the waiter said was medium plus.  Which is kind of odd since another review said that was between medium rare and medium.)  What did I get?  I think I got a tiny notch below well done crispy fried.  Every bite I had was crunchy, you would've thought I was eating a potato chip.  Absolutely horrible and dry.  My dinner partner had the strip.  It looked. . .not very appetizing.  He said it wasn't good at all, tasted sinewy and rubbery (he asked for medium).  We didn't even want to try desert.

Perhaps most disappointing aspect of the meal was that there were a few fruit flies around our table now and then throughout our time there, and we were seated a few tables away from the closest to the kitchen. Not sure if everyone throughout the restaurant would have had that experience. Either way, definitely NOT something you hope for at such a high end spot. \\nAnyhoo - Wine list is very extensive and the Chianti we chose was quite wonderful. \\nBread basket before dinner was just fine, nothing special but nothing bad. Crab cake as an appetizer was good, interesting texture on the outside but very fresh and good consistency on the inside. \\nMy dining partner and I actually decided to share the aged ribeye and a handful of sides. The steak itself was a great cut of meat, however seemed overly/unnecessarily seasoned - personally I prefer when restaurants let the meat speak for itself without extra seasoning, and let their guests control the salt/pepper at the table. But don't get me wrong it was a truly great piece of meat, the quality was there for sure. Unfortunately the sides were mostly the same story - mashed potatoes were way over buttered (I know this would be a plus for some people but it was just excessive), the bacon braised greens were actually so salty that they were inedible (we did not eat them nor did we take the leftovers home), the roasted brussels sprouts were fine but over-balsamic'd. And my dining partner also got the tots on a whim (he had seen such good reviews about them he just had to try them!) and they were kind of a bust, just very so-so (but I think that's to be expected with tots). I understand that some people prefer their meals this way, so take that into consideration if you're still reading! I personally do not, and it was still a GOOD meal, just not something I would have often.\\nLastly we got a little sundae for dessert, it was good - no complaints there.

I should first recommend that if you're at all able, try to sit outside. It's not a very large space inside, and when busy, it's loud enough to be unpleasant and very difficult to carry on a conversation. \\n\\nYou'll order at the counter, and as others have pointed out, since this place isn't at all cheap, table service should be offered. We ordered the fittatine di pasta, fried macaroni basically, for the appetizer and it's absolutely delicious. It's served with a side of Sapori's delicious marinara sauce. I must say that I found their sauce to be substantially above average. It's not too sweet, and seems to have a generous helping of black pepper in it, which I love. For my pizza, I ordered the Carnosa, which is topped with ham, Italian sausage and salami. Everything about it was delicious - the cheese, toppings, crust, sauce. Absolutely no complaints, it was one of the better pizzas I've had in Atlanta.\\n\\nInsofar as service, you're more or less on your own. The staff is very friendly, but you may have to flag down the server if you want extra beer or refill, or go to the counter to ask. After our server visited our table a few times and still didn't give us plates, napkins or utensils I found where they were kept and got them myself. The pizzas usually cost at least $20 or more, and that obviously doesn't include any drinks, appetizers or deserts so I think for this price they really should offer table service. Here's where I wish that Yelp had half-star ratings because four stars is a little high to give a restaurant where the mere act of having your water refilled can be a chore, but damn that pizza was good, so screw it.\\n\\nPros: Delicious, wonderful pizza.\\n\\nCons: Self-service. \\n\\nVerdict: Recommended"},{"name":"French Quarter Brasserie and Oyster Bar","address":"1207 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"Stopped in for a Sunday as \\"Oyster Bar\\" seemed enticing.....There was a show going on and it was a fun atmosphere which is why I'm giving 2 stars.

The lesson of \\"Top Chef\\" vs. \\"Kitchen Nightmares\\" is that you don't have to be an asshole to be good.\\n\\nRamsay's show descended on Park's Edge for the full bube-tube treatment (I understand it'll air this fall), and apparently a number of dust ups ensued - including one dramatic firing during business hours. But you'd expect drama from a venom-spewing chef who chews up his own reality-show sets, along with the people who populate them.\\n\\nWhatever I think about Gordy, Park's Edge today is a superb example of Atlanta eateries doing the basic art of food. Could the restaurant have picked itself up without a TV invasion? Perhaps. For me, the *results are the story - not the actions leading up to it, or better put, the ratings they try to generate.\\n\\nNow that my rant about TV doofuses is over I can gush about how well Park's Edge did for us. Upon a recommendation from gal-pal extraordinaire Lorikay Stone, we went without any expectations - and we left with a belly full of terrific food. Each dish was better than the next.\\n\\nThe corn chowder is an absolute must - do NOT leave there without trying it. The soup has a remarkably buttery but unobtrusive taste and you'll immediately beg for the recipe. As a starter I also tried the watermelon salad, which was great, and my mother had the beet and feta salad, which was delicious and on-point taste-wise.\\n\\nMain course. Oy... the salmon. What do I say about this dish other than it was, risking cliche, perfection. Not the biggest cut of fish, not the most grandiose serving - but it didn't need to be, because it was *cooked in such a remarkable way that the first bite exploded with crisp, salty flavor. The accompanying beans and mash were excellent, too. I was so hypnotized by my own dish that I hardly remember what my other co-diners got. (Their pork chops were just so-so.) My mother had the shrimp and grits, which was also very flavorful. \\n\\nAfter a great showing with the salads and entrees, we had to try dessert - and it's a good thing we did. The bread pudding was in the same category as the corn chowder - stunning and one-of-a-kind. It was the perfect punctuation to our dinner - set in an intimate, fun house. I will not just go back - I'll rush back. and so should you.\\n\\nPS: most of the reviewers on here have gone for brunch, and I urge you to try the place for dinner.

Taking over Blackbird's previous first floor dining area (and the Keg Caesars before that) on Dunsmuir Street, the freshly renovated space is gorgeous with a classy, sophisticated look and feel in a neighbourhood dominated by chain restaurants.\\n\\nHead chef Jack Chen heads up the 80-seat farm-to-table eatery's menu of locally-sourced seasonal ingredients in keeping with a philosophy of sustainable dining. This preview night dinner--filling the entirety of the newly finished restaurant--was actually the staff's first experience together serving any diners. Cannily, they served two different menus alternating from table to table.\\n\\nTo drink, I was delighted by the Amaro et Caf√© cocktail (made with Elysian cold brew coffee, Amaro Montenegro, and orange) and its strong but welcoming mixture of tastes. Likewise, the  classic French 75 (with gin, prosseco, pressed lemon, and orange oil) was also a light and refreshing pre-dinner libation. Both cocktails are featured on the L'Ap√©ro (ap√©ritif) happy hour drink menu from bar manager Wendy McGuiness for your enjoyment while you wait for a table or your meal to be served.\\n\\nTo start, the salt baked beetroot (with summer berries, cheese, and sorrel granite) was predictably filled with fresh, simple flavours. I found it pretty refreshing.\\n\\nAs for the mains, the black pepper pappardelle (with zucchini and parmesan cheese) was serviceable but somewhat lacking with a very mild taste. The house made pasta was delicious and well-made, but for me, deserved something more substantial topped on it.\\n\\nThe ling cod (with grilled cucumber, mussels, caramelized whey, and dill) was subtle, well-cooked, and quite tasty as were the mussels in the sauce (enjoyed with some of their naturally leavened bread). The dish was understated but satisfying.\\n\\nRoyal Dinette is aiming for variety and complementary dishes with fresh pastas, tasting menus, sharing plates, and drink pairings as they're going for a full dining experience. For dessert, I was quite taken with the well-prepared stone fruit (with salted white chocolate, milk sorbet, and candied hazelnut) for bringing so many sweet flavours together sublimely.\\n\\nFor their very first outing serving anyone, let alone media and only hours after putting the finishing touches on the restaurant, Royal Dinette's familiar yet welcoming menu of flavours is already fairly appealing. Coming to the table with such a strong pedigree from front of house to back, I only expect things to improve on a promising start in refining their menu and tastes."},{"name":"P.

Awkward interactions and subpar food that's overpriced.  I have to say that the restaurant aesthetically is fantastic!  It's a perfect location, the patio is super cute, the decor is spot on, overall it feels like a really cool spot.  However, the food was not good.  The oysters were still attached, and not nearly as fresh as Jax.  The crawfish √©touff√©e was pretty mediocre and WAY overpriced.  The fish salad had some weird orange dressing that tasted like a candy sauce, and the salad itself was so basic.  For the price, they could of spiced it up past the whole grape tomatoes and cucumbers...  The fish was also overcooked and bland.  The only good part was the cornbread croutons - those were great.  The service is really really bad.  You know when a place isn't busy, and your waiter asks you fifty times if you need anything?  Super annoying.  And it seems like none of the wait staff has actually ever worked in the food service industry.  For the high prices, this place should come with staff that has fine-dining experience.

On a mini vacay in GA visiting girlfriends and came across Gunshow. We really did not understand the concept but we were curious. We called and they were booked and the waiting list was full too!! They said if we came in and waited we would get in before people on the waiting list since we were there. Thank God we did! The bar was full when we walked in BUT 3 spots opened up just in time! We each got a cocktail. Not sure what we ordered but it was all very good and strong! We waited about 15 mins and got sat. They were able to transfer our bill to the table. Cafeteria style seating which was pretty cool and not too close to the other parties. Cute set up with bandana napkins that we had too much fun with! The kitchen was very open and we had some fun with the chefs too:)! Basically the menu reads like gibberish BUT learned it's like that for a reason! Instead of ordering and praying you ordered right they bring out each item(one at a time with some space in between) to the table!! You can see and smell the dish before committing to it! How awesome is that!!! Smaller plates. I would be good with 1.5 plates myself. The three of us ended up getting 4 plates and a dessert. The menu changes everyday so describing each plate seems counterintuitive but all were FAB!! this place allows you to go outside your comfort zone because you let your senses decide! Smelling and seeing it not to mention the chef themselves tell you how they made it when they come out made this an amazing dinner! OK, best part...Kevin Gillespie from Top Chef and owner of Gunshow was there and served us a plate!! AND he let three tipsy women interrogate him about his restaurant! Why he did it this way? Is he thinking about branching out? Has he had many offered to expand? Blah blah blah!! And answered every question with pleasure! I am such a fan now! Not only of his food but he's unique take on dinning and he's passion! Love love love him! also let me rave about the all the other staff members. Everyone seemed to enjoy working there! It was chill but still professional. Can't remember our servers name but we loved him! He had a good time with us and helped us decide what to do after dinner. Lastly, it was a pretty big bill but hey we got a lot! The cocktails themselves were like 10 bucks and the dishes were 14-25 bucks I think. We got 5 drinks, 4 plates, and dessert and spend 120. Not bad for what we got!

As far as coffee shops go, definitely worth checking out.\\n\\nAs a dog owner, however, I have noticed lately an increase in unattended dogs in the dog park. The last three times I've been there I've witnessed dog owners frustratingly removing their dogs from the park because they have been targetted by more aggressive dogs whose owners were nowhere to be found. My last visit there were 9 dogs and only two people outside (dog park and patio) watching them. My dog was approached by three bigger dogs and the interaction turned violent. I tried to withdraw my dog from the situation but struggled to do so while keeping three larger dogs that were lunging at her at bay. This could have easily been avoided had any of those dog owners been around to remove their dogs from the situation. Luckily, the two dog owners who were outside (not the owners of the dogs attacking mine) were able to intervene and helped me pull these dogs off and we were able to leave. The situation could have been much worst but because of this experience, and irresponsible pet owners, we will no longer be going back. \\n\\nTo be fair, ParkGrounds does have signs that state that dogs must not be left unattended, but these rules aren't enforced. It's not the staff's responsibility to do so, it's 100% on the dog owners. I understand it is cold outside and one of the perks of this place is that there is an inside area.

When I have sushi, I like to sit at the sushi bar and order directly from the sushi chefs. A few things bothered me about this place. The first is that the bar stools were uncomfortable as they were high and, if you have big feet (like I do), there's no good place to rest them and I kept moving them around during the meal trying to find a way to get comfortable with little luck. Second, the bar level where you sit is about a foot lower than the other side of the bar and it feels like you're in the orchestra pit and your sushi guys are on the stage (that was an exageration, but you are significantly lower than in almost any other sushi place I've been to). I'm thinking this was intentional, though, because they also don't seem to like you ordering from the sushi chef direcly; they prefer that you order with your server when they come around. The server was perfectly fine and attentive, but it's definitely not the way I like to order.\\n\\nMy third complaint would be that if you don't order everything at once, expect a big delay if you order something later. I know this is common in many places, but having to place the order through the server first could be part of the slowness.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint, though, is that the quality of the sushi or its presentation is not high enough to match the decor. It feels like you're dining in a museum, but the sushi is just good. I've been to sushi places that look like holes-in-the-wall that have had phenomenal sushi and the sushi here doesn't even come close. It's just OK."},{"name":"Blue Glass Cafe","address":"200 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"This place is a fail.

The ambience is relaxed elegance.  The servers were professional and attentive.  The food was...confusing.  The prices were comically high.  \\n\\nI ordered the filet mignon.  I chose the tavern salad and the saut√©ed mushrooms, which were included with the entree.  The tavern salad is dressed with a balsamic dressing, which tasted unexpectedly sweet, and not in a good way.  The tomatoes were pale pink, tasteless, and very crunchy.  Next up, saut√©ed mushrooms.  What's not to love?  Allow me to tell you.  The mushrooms also were strangely sweet.  Why???  And now, the steak.  I ordered it Oscar style.  The b√©arnaise was, like everything else I had eaten, extremely sweet.  Just....whyyy?  Why are your savory foods so sweet?  I will say I ordered my filet rare and it was perfectly cooked and of good quality.  However, I was disappointed to discover it was next to impossible to cut my steak without my plate scooting all over the table.  No tablecloths, which really isn't a big deal until you try to cut into a thick piece of meat without your plate slip-sliding all over.  It was embarrassing.  I had the creme br√ªl√©e for dessert, which was perfect.  \\n\\nI have no idea why they feel the need to make items that should be savory instead taste inexplicably sweet.  My entire bill for the above plus two glasses of wine was $90.

Old Spaghetti Factory was like getting old spaghetti from a factory. I know that's a little harsh because the food was necessarily bad and the restaurant was clean and fun for our family.

From the beginning to the end it was not a great experience. My water tasted like lemonade. The waiter was apologetic and got me a new glass. Both of our salads where \\"swimming\\" in Caesar dressing. Probably empty a whole bottle between the two salads. I got the chicken parmigiana and was not impressed. I doubt the ingredients where fresh and my chicken was Luke warm and dry. It was obviously thrown together. All three of us had spaghetti and in summary there was nothing special about it.

We usually get a few of the small plates and even share depending on the portions.  Our order that night was a braised pork belly, the chestnut soup, duck confit and the mussels.  We always get the sticky toffee for desert, because it is usually perfectly executed, unctuous and the comfort factor is off the charts.  The braised pork belly arrived--- I have had Kevin Gillespie's pork belly, David Chang's pork belly at Momofuku and an insanely delicious version from Jean-Georges Vonderichten's Perry St. in the West Village, so I am a fair judge of the dish.  This was an utter disappointment--dry, practically flavorless with a brackish reduction that had no discernable fllavors of the muscadine glaze it had promised--one tiny turnip, crispy parsnip ribbons and a few chards of tasteless beech mushroom.  BH's chestnut soup was just OK, as she described it--good velvety texture, but rather bland.  We tried some bread--cold, almost stale, they tasted like something from the Kroger bakery---Linton Hopkins H&F bakery puts out some of the best baked goods in the city--this didn't even approach their worst effort. Then we waited . . and waited . . and waited. after 30 minutes between the courses, we asked our very attentive and competent server if the next plates were coming--she assured me they were and would we like a couple of more glasses of wine?  Why of course---out came the wine and 5 more minutes passed.  Here was the food--BH pushed her plate away \\"Ice cold\\" she said, and indeed, they were clearly not up to temp and had a sad, sodden look as if they had been sitting for some time.  I took one bite of confit.  This was not confit---it was a baked duckleg, deboned and bathed in the saltiest demi-glace I have ever tasted--there was a good serving of handmade orichiette on the plate that had been properly cooked, but the sodium level ruined the dish.  We sent it all back, asked for our check and bolted.  To management's credit they comped the boomerrang dishes and even gave us a take out with a free lemon tart and a sticky, although the sticky was not the same out of the microwave.

The first time we ordered the ahi tuna poke appetizer which was decent although it wasn't memorable. We both got the scallops as our entree and I believe it came with a heap of rice and a salad. I've had better seafood but it was decent and the service was fine. \\n\\nThen last weekend we decided to try their sandwiches and pretty much everything went wrong. \\nWe were seated immediately but were not asked if we had a preference as to whether we wanted to sit inside or out so we had the host redirect us to a table outside. No big deal. Two seconds after we sat down a waiter laid several appetizers on our table so we had to explain that we hadn't ordered yet. Again, no big deal, just foreshadowing of the screw ups to come. I ordered a glass of wine and my partner ordered a Sweetwater 420 because it was listed as on draft at about $4. However, the waitress brought him a bottle so he asked why it wasn't on draft and she basically said oops should have said it wasn't on draft. Oh well. We ordered mahi mahi sandwiches and both requested remoulade sauce, something that only comes with sandwiches. The waitress then asked what two sides we wanted which was odd because the sandwiches were listed as coming with one side.  We also ordered a popcorn shrimp appetizer which we found out was basically a bowl of dry lettuce and carrots with a few pieces of room temperature fried shrimp on top, coated with what appeared to be sweet and sour sauce. It was an odd, mostly tasteless arrangement that did not seem worth the price. We were also given another bowl of lettuce with a wedge of tomato on top which they called a salad. If there was dressing on it, I couldn't tell. We waited quite a while for our sandwiches to come out while overhearing other waiters apologizing to other tables for the delay. When our food came out it was in the form of a platter and not a sandwhich which would have cost significantly less. They took it back and put it in a bun and the waitress explained that she misunderstood because mahi mahi is also an entree. Of course, she did remember the remoulade sauce. I hate to say it but the fish was a rather small filet and it was pretty dry. My side of brussel sprouts was probably the most decent thing on my plate although my boyfriend's \\"charred\\" green beans were simply steamed with a lack of salt.\\n\\nI'm sure that the wait staff or kitchen was understaffed or experiencing some other issues that night so I can understand why a lot of things went wrong for a lot of the patrons there that night. Surely our experience wasn't typical. Fortunately, they reduced our bill significantly although they charged over $6 for the beer for some reason. We felt like at that point it wasn't worth complaining about. I'm not so sure I want to go back mainly because the food was bland and the portions of actual seafood were small. I'm sure they're trying to save money by serving smaller portions of fish and filling in the gaps with extra rice or lettuce."},{"name":"Charlie's Kitchen","address":"10 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Great service last night at Charlie Kitchen.

Then the host (if you can call him that) asked how many and brought us to a table that was cramped and right next to server station.  Who we thought was the host, ended up being our server. He never smiled, never told us his name and was just plain rude (his name is Brandon and the only reason I know that is because it was on our receipt).  Our food came quickly and I figured out exactly why!  I ordered the Eggstravaganza.  The eggs were dry, the turkey bacon (which I actually asked for pork bacon) was dry and resembled unflavored beef jerky.  The grits were luke warm and what I was most looking forward to were the oven roasted moon dusted potatoes - but  they were so dry and bland I had to douse them with ketchup and salt in order to eat them. The raspberry sauce and honey cr√®me anglaise on the French  toast was so runny ... by the time I got it (for the second time since he dropped my first plate of French toast) the toast was so saturated, it was like a wet sponge. I'm sure all the food was pre-cooked in warming trays - dried out, lacking flavor and barely warm.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself felt unclean with years of dirt, grease and grime that has never really been thoroughly cleaned. The plastic table clothes that are stapled to the tables felt sticky and filmy. The salt shaker had food stuck on it where the holes are..so gross!  But what really grossed me out the most was almost every time our server came by our table, his sweater brushed over my French toast plate.  That was how close he had to come to our table to pass by us.  By that time, I had had enough.

Ted's is American comfort food at its best! \\n\\n(I'll try not to sound biased, I worked here for a year, so instead I'll give you tips on how to have the best experience ever here.)\\n\\nTip Number 1. CALL AHEAD SEATING! If you are going to be dinning here on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night or if you have a large group, it's best to call about a hour ahead and notify that you are coming. It's not a reservation, it just puts your party higher on the priority list if there is a wait so they can better accommodate you.\\n\\nTip Number 2. Request the best waiter on the floor that day. Turn around time here is fast, and some waiters are significantly more experienced than others, and if you know you are picky about service, just ask the friendly hostess to sit you in the best section. \\n\\nTip Number 3. If you are picky about a booth or table, tell the hostess ahead of time so she can prepare you that table - you may have to wait.\\n\\nTip Number 4. The patio is only opened when the weather is good.\\n\\nTip Number 5. EVERYTHING ON THE MENU CAN BE MODIFIED, BUT IT MAY COST YOU A BIT EXTRA. Just ask for no butter on your whole wheat bun, or a side of green beans instead of French fries. Everything is made to order and is fresh; just make sure your server understands your requests.\\n\\nTip Number 6. Don't be afraid to ask to speak to the manager to rave about the service or food or to complain about it...it helps them out if they know how their restaurant is performing.\\n\\nTip Number 7. SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT. The seasonal desserts are usually the best...but very high in calories, split it between your party.\\n\\nTip Number 8. Order Take Away if you want.\\n\\nTip Number 9. Tip your server! They work their asses off!\\n\\nTip Number 10. Tell your friends!"},{"name":"Nud Pob Thai Cuisine","address":"738 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"oh Nud Pob, how I love you.

My experience was always meh, at best. Tried the catfish basket, some shrimp, oysters...all fried, served with fries. Pretty much all seafood options at Sam's are deep fried. They also offer burgers and some Tex-Mex fare; however, I never went there.\\n\\nSo, this crawfish season - already having been to several a-ok boils at other events around town - the hubster and I ask around about what restaurant had the best mud bugs in Austin, and just about everyone pointed us towards Sam's.\\n\\nSo off we went. Sat on one of the 2 bars located on opposite sides of the restaurant. Ordered a few cold brews, 2 lbs of bugs to start, and some garlic bread (2 overly greasy, super salty little slices for $1.50 if I recall). Rolled up our sleeves with anticipation...waited...waited...sure they were busy but most people were ordering cray so should've been throwing them out of the pass IMHO. Finally delivered. They were fine. Just fine. Not great, not horrible...fine. Not overcooked, seasoned lightly. Sadly, probably are some of the best in Austin...but definitely not the best I've ever had.\\n\\nOverall: Bartender was super nice and accommodating. Every time my husband ordered his particular beer of choice, she had to walk to the other bar to retrieve it (they don't stock each bar the same exact way; wtf?). Each \\"pound\\" of crawfish looked a little smaller than I'm accustomed to being served. Substantiated by the fact we ended up eating 5 lbs instead of our normal maximum of 3 shared. Even though we're far from twig people, we do have our limits. ;) Wouldn't order the embarrassing bread again...ever. Would possibly go back and enjoy cold libations on their large patio on a nice day (esp. during their many HH options), and maybe \\"snack\\" on a pound of bugs next season.

The service here is a bit appalling at times like when the waitress spills beer on my shoes and remains deadpan about it. I don't recommend the food nor the beer...I don't suggest anything. There was one night where the taps were dirty that you could taste it in your beer and the said beer was lukewarm. The happy hour Caesars were a joke that at one point they were watered down Clamato juice with no alcohol. I understand that there are big crowds and they can be overwhelming but for the quality to plummet so quickly is inexcusable. The food and service are both brutal. I feel ashamed to even spend my hard earned money here. The pizzas are average frozen pizza quality and the rest of the menu items are disappointing. For a pub that mimics a gastropub, it failed miserably. An example of it would be tonight's experience when I had ordered stuffed Yorkie. I was expecting a flaky goodness with tender roast beef with rich red wine au jus... I think I got a frozen ready-to-eat version of it. It was a nightmare and a half. It was inedible: dried, overcooked roast beef and dry pudding (can't really call it a pudding)...it was like a burnt dried croissant crossed with a burnt muffin. There were sprinkles of green onion but it was all bland. The red wine au jus was completely watered down (moreso than Joe's and I disliked that establishment). It's as if they had place a small portion of a sachet and added water like I would not notice. I ate through one piece because I had drank alcohol and I didn't want to get sick. The second piece I had to stop because this was simply unacceptable. For $14 I wasn't expecting Michelin awarded quality but I wanted some of the cook's integrity in serving this garbage. The waitress had said that it had always come out burnt and dry and I wondered how this item stayed on their menu if this lack of quality remained constant. With the help of my companions it was removed from my bill and ruined my appetite for the rest of the night. I don't recommend the food even to my worst enemy. I've had calamari but I can't shake this experience off with the Yorkies. It had reminded me of a wonderful time and a person in the UK and after tonight, this place totally lost it for me. \\n\\nAlso don't try the Wine O'Clock Chardonnay or the Shiraz.

I was warned about the long waiting time but luckily we didn't wait too long when we came around 10:15 AM. There were only about 6 groups of people in front. Nevertheless, the wait was about 40 minutes or so for the three of us. I was actually expecting to wait for longer than an hour. Although it was a small space, I liked how they decorated the interiors. I ordered the fried chicken benedict ($16) and a fizzy lavender lemonade ($3.50).\\n\\nThe lavender lemonade had a strong lavender flavour. I think it is an acquired taste as my friend thought it was like drinking perfume. I thought the drink was refreshing especially with the fizz. The fried chicken benedict looked good when it arrived. The hashbrown looked like it was pre-made in a pan because it was neatly cut. It tasted much better with the house made sauce if you like spicy. The benedict itself was all good except for the fried chicken. I thought it was too dry, almost like chewing on cardboard. I just wished it was more juicy but I did like how they didn't use a lot of batter. The portion was just right as it kept me full for the next 6 hours. One main concern I had was the temperature of the food. It was not as hot as I expected it to be. The hashbrown was cold and the benedict was at room temperature. I understand the kitchen must have been very busy and probably not enough staff to bring food out, but I think the food would have tasted better if it was hotter.\\n\\nThe server was attentive as she came by to refill our water and made sure everything was okay even though it was busy.

For dinner my wife had the lobster Mac and cheese, and I had the blackened swordfish. I asked to substitute wasabi mashed potatoes, but was served regular ones. Speaking of the potatoes, they were extremely bland, and my piece of swordfish, while decent, wasn't anything to go crazy over. My wife's dinner was once again just ok.

Then it was Court House, but that's a chain. Then Oceanaire, but that wasn't classy enough. I brought the classic 80s little black dress with my 4 inch heels and diamonds, so we needed a good steakhouse where I could get some seafood and not look overdressed doing it. \\n\\nSo Grill 23 it was.  And it was a delectably good choice. From the get go, the menu looked good and the wine selection was outstanding. I always feel intimidated by wine books with tables of contents, like I need to take more wine classes to learn more. In cases like this, I gravitate towards that I know: a Spanish rioja, Marques de Riscal, 2001 reserva. 2001 was sold out, so we got a 2002. Very dry, the 2001's a fuller vintage, but once it opened up it was good. (See! I know some, but only about wines I drink often enough to have learned the differences.)\\n\\nFor starters I went standard, a ceasar salad. I always feel a restaurant can be judged by how good their ceasar is. The salad was crisp, croutons not too crunchy and the dressing wasn't overpowering but with a good bite. We also got the ravioli app, which was good, but there wasn't a lot in it. More dough than filling, a whole bite with the sauce and the ravioli was tasty. There just wasn't that much there.\\n\\nI was in a seafood mood, so I went with the salmon. Very well cooked, seared on the outside so it was delectably crunchy. The NY strip got ordered too, and it was interesting. Apparently, it's wet-aged, instead of dry-aged. It wasn't too fatty, and seasoned just right. A nice bite of that with the broccoli gratin was oh so yummy. However, the mashed potatoes? Oh my god so good. Like, I ate almost the whole bowl of the side good. \\n\\nI'll admit, choosing what to eat was hard, everything looked delicious. Our choices were good, but there might be some better ones on the menu. \\n\\nWe also got dessert, a fresh fruit sorbet that was interesting. Kumquats and tangerines were the main flavors, and a great light finishing to the meal. I wasn't entirely impressed by the selection of the dessert menu, it was pretty simple, but I'm sure delicious nonetheless. After dinner drinks weren't had at Grill 23, but they had a nice, and very reasonably priced, list of cognacs and bourbons. \\n\\nVenue:\\nA big, old, boy's club of a restaurant. Two floors, open kitchen, mahogany bar. You don't see restaurants like this in NYC anymore, real estate's too valuable, so it's great to see a true steakhouse at it's finest. Waiters in their whites, coat check and gold banisters, it's a real sight to behold and makes you feel welcome. \\n\\nOur server, I can't remember her name, was such a sweetie. She made our dinner experience go very smoothly. Appropriately inquisitive and suggestive, she offered up the steak as a dinner choice, and we took it. Compared to our dessert waiter, she was a bubbling personality, where as he didn't say a word that didn't need saying.\\n\\nOverall it was a fantastic evening, but shy of five stars for me. The food was delicious, but this side of wowing. There wasn't an over-the-top feel, but I was in an over-the-top outfit, so I was a bit disappointed by that. I know Boston's a big city too, but I felt like it was NYC prices when it needn't have been.

I went with ten chicken wings. They were crispy  on the outside and tender on the inside, and not doused with carb filled crumbs or batter. My wife's selection was also what she expected.

Our main complaint with the restaurant is the lack of seasoning and mostly spice.  The dishes are generous but lack serious flavor.  I ordered the jalape√±o pepper and shrimp dish and it had zero spice or flavor.  My husband and I asked the waitress for some more jalape√±o peppers on the side and we'll as some chilli oil.  No joke the oil tasted like cardboard and the jalape√±os had no heat.  This leads me to believe the restaurant  is  serving old products.  I should not be able to eat thick slices of jalape√±o if they were fresh. We decided to pack up our order early after it came out because we knew we had spicy chilli at home with fresh jalape√±os.  As we were paying we overheard the table next to us complaining about the same issue we were having....no spice and no flavor.  They even mentioned they paid extra for jalape√±os and they weren't spicy.  I will say our waitress was nice, but the couple behind us had a very rude waitress who was not happy about them voicing their concerns over the food.  It's not worth the portion size if it's not made how the customer orders it.  Lastly, I've noticed the same complaints with other yelp reviews of this restaurant.  I hope management will read this at some point.  It's a shame to lose customers over this.  If the dish has a jalape√±o pepper next to the item than IT SHOULD BE SPICY.

Upon entrance to Babs, we were overwhelmed with a staff willing to help us with whatever we wanted.  One thing can certainly be said of Babs: the quality of service is excellent.  We were well taken care of during the entire meal, and the staff was extremely friendly.\\n\\nThe second thing to note about Babs is this: for what you pay, you will get a veritable feast.  All of the dishes were enormous given the price, and while the menu was small the variety between dishes was great.  There were a lot of options, from the standard waffles, eggs, and sausage (my choice) to a \\"stromboli\\" of sorts.  The fruits served with each dish were fresh and delicious, and not your standard grocery store pineapple-melon-cantaloupe-grape mix.  We're talking fresh strawberries, orange slices, and huge apple wedges (this should be a model for other aspiring brunch places).  The only reason Babs gets 4 stars rather than 5 is because I was slightly disappointed in the quality of some of the other food.  Their potatoes were perfect, and their eggs scrambled exactly how I like them, but the waffles left a lot to be desired.  The texture of the waffles was too dry, and it was difficult to get through a whole waffle without drowning it in syrup.  The pork sausage that - by request - accompanied the waffle was cooked just a bit too long, and was a little chewy for my tastes.  \\n\\nNormally, these issues would be enough for me to knock this down to a 3-star, but the exceptional service, good atmosphere, and general attitude of the staff definitely earns them enough of a bonus to get to 4 stars.

Both dished were under the House Speciality dishes.  I'll admit, I went into getting food here with hesitation, as the reviews were all over the place.  For the beef dish, I asked if it could be made mild, as it had a hot pepper symbol next to it.  I was told no problem.  When the order was repeated back, I said again, \\"PLEASE make sure the dish is mild\\".  The food came around the time they averaged.  I don't like pork dumplings but my husband and kids said they were great.  The shumai was average as was the scallion pancake.  The chicken and shrimp dish tasted of uncooked white wine, both rice's were crunchy and tatted stale.  The beef dish was so hot, I couldn't eat it.  And, I normally love hot.  I only got it mild for my kids.  All in all the food was meh at best, but what knocked it down to one star was the attitude of the owner.  I called back and told her about the food.  She insisted that what I said wasn't true, and when I insisted back that \\"yes, it is\\", she said she was going to send a driver back to take back the food and see.     I told her, \\"that's fine, but I want a credit, which she said ok to\\".   Back he came and I wrapped up what I didn't like, which was most of it, almost completely untouched.   When I checked my bank balance the next day, I didn't see the credit, so I called and left a message.  She called me back about an hour later and said that she would not credit my card.  Only give me a credit to use towards the restaurant.  If the food was good and I had an off night, sure, I supposed.

The hostess brought a stack of menus to our table which was actually kind of ridiculous.  \\n\\nWe were able to order and my son and I asked for Ranch on our salads, but when they came didn't taste like they had ranch on them.  I asked the waitress and she admitted that it was their creamy pesto and not ranch (all the while trying to tell me that they are the same thing).  I explained that if I had known it was not ranch I would have ordered thousand island instead.  \\n\\nMy wife got a special salad with a hair.\\n\\nI had experienced the fact that when we order the cheese bread they don't bring table bread.  I have never liked their cheese bread, but my wife does.  I ordered the cheese bread, but asked that they make sure to bring the table bread because I won't eat the cheese bread.  When the cheese bread came my wife says it was kind of cold, like it had been sitting under the heat lamp too long.  I never eat it, because I think it always tasted that way and always looked burnt and dry.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the lasagna and it looked like they had cut it out a mold.  I mean it had sharp edges and did not look appetizing at all.  After the hair and seeing the lasagna my wife lost her appetite.\\n\\nI had ordered the chicken parm, but there was something way off about it.  First it didn't look right.  I looked like someone just took a chicken breast and tried to bread it without any other prep.  No butter fly or tenderizing.  Then the crust looked all wrong.  It definitely didn't have any breading or crispness to it.  It looked like there was a lot of egg used to try and bread it.  The taste was even worse.  I thought at first I was having some sort of problem, so I took another much smaller bite.  I must have had a look on my face, because when I asked my wife to give it a try for me she said absolutely not.  After some coaxing I finally got my son to try it and he had the same look I did.  We both kind thought it tasted like when you get that balloon powder in your mouth.  It took forever for that taste to go away.\\n\\nI noticed that the place wasn't very full for lunch, and we were all looking at the mess on the headboards of our booth.\\n\\nThis place needs some serious attention, and if you go and start noticing the things I did, don't order anything, just leave.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nI got home that night and my son was dealing with diarrhea and nausea.

First of all, service was horrible. I have worked in the service industry for years and I understand most complications and working in a busy place. But seriously they got our order wrong twice. We ordered at the counter where they were up-selling the special so I said ok and ordered 3 (squash dumplings) and then they said there were only 2 left. Given I don't eat dairy or meat they recommended the vegetarian dumpling. My boyfriend then ordered two meat dumplings and the sweet potato dumpling (which contains dairy as the person at the counter warned me). So we ordered six total and when the food was brought to us there were only five. We tried to clarify and it was very confusing; of course you can't really tell the flavors from the outside of the dumplings. They apologized and put an extra one in for us and when we got home to eat them we had completely different dumplings then we ordered. Also, they were not very flavorful or filling. I received none of the special squash dumplings, two vegetarian ones (very bland), a sweet potato, and three meat dumplings. I tried a small taste of the sweet potato and it was just mushy and mostly dough. My boyfriend did enjoy the meat ones but agreed they were a little bland and not filling. $22 for six dumplings, half of which we didn't even order, not impressed.

This friendly neighborhood gastropub is owned by Jason Chenette and the self-proclaimed \\"angry chef\\", Ron Eyester, of nearby Rosebud restaurant.\\n\\nFood: I must admit that I'm puzzled by some of the lackluster reviews for the cuisine at The Family Dog. Although this establishment touts its self, first and foremost, as a bar, I personally found the food to be incredibly well executed and far superior to what you would find in most stand-alone restaurants. For the most part, the food offerings are traditional pub fare with a contemporary twist. During my visit this past Saturday afternoon, we opted for the \\"nachos of the day\\", which were laced with pulled pork and a series of fresh, farm-to-table vegetables; the appetizer was hot upon arrival, flavorful, and sizable in portion. For an entree, I ordered the BLT, which was hands down the best I have ever had. In lieu of what you'd traditionally expect, the dish was comprised of braised pork belly, tomato marmalade, and arugula; the flavors uniquely complimented one another, resulting in a superb flavor. As a side, I ordered the the housemade cheetohs, which were essentially fried pork rinds tossed in powdered cheddar cheese; again, a unique flavor combination with epic results. The drink options are fairly standard, but there is a separate drink menu with a decent selection of creative handcrafted beers and mixed drinks.\\n\\nService: Contrary to what others have experienced, the service during my visit was friendly and efficient. Upon entry, we were promptly told to sit anywhere that we pleased, so we simply did so. The hostess immediately took our drink order and our waitress arrived shortly thereafter. Ron Eyester happened to be in the bar at the time and brought out our appetizer. I had never encountered him before in person, but contrary to what you would expect from his online persona, he was polite and cordial.\\n\\nAtmosphere: I was really impressed by the expansive amount of space in this bar. The ceilings are incredibly high and the front of the establishment is all windows, which was a welcomed alternative to the typical cave-like atmosphere of most bars in the area. They also have a sizable bar, that extends most of the length of the far left wall, which is surrounded by a series of high-top tables and booths. There are also a few arcade games scattered throughout bar, including foosball.  \\n\\nPrice: Moderately priced, but commensurate with the quality of the food. Most sandwiches and small plates are around $6 to $10, but it's important to note that they are not accompanied by any sides. However, there are a series of \\"snacks\\" that you can order as sides for $4 each, including fries, duck fat chips, and cheetohs, among other things.\\n\\nOther: Another thing that I really appreciated about The Family Dog is that smoking is prohibited. At this day in age, I'm still baffled by the fact that many locations still let people smoke in indoor public places. Kudos to the owners for catering to the 80% of the population that would prefer to \\"sit, drink, and stay\\" in a health friendly environment."},{"name":"Turf N Surf Po' Boy","address":"407 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Fried oyster taco??

However, last year while visiting my mom, I took her to try Cafe Hibiscus, and we had a new favorite for Portland.  The Rosti is your basic potato pancake, but ours have been well prepared every time we have gone there, and potato pancakes by any name are standard fare for Germany and surrounding areas, so don't act disappointed that they serve them at Cafe Hibiscus.  The salad may not have any special ingredients if you ignore the Swiss Dressing.  However, the dressing cannot be ignored.  It is a thin creamy, tangy, smoky dressing that also goes well with the bread you get with your meal. I guess that's why they serve the soft fresh bread with a dipping cup of Swiss Dressing straight and another dipping cup of dressing spiced up with Sriracha sauce.   I suggest buying a bottle while you're at teh restaurant and taking it home.\\n\\nOur last time there on July 4, I had the Goulash with spaetzle.

Since it was raining (natch') and I had just kicked off my shoes, I cut our losses and had the salad, which was very, very good. The pears and candied walnuts added just the right amount of sweetness to offset the gorgonzola and balsamic dressing.\\n\\nThe best comparison I can make on the pizza, even they're a newer establishment than Pizzicato, is Sizzle Pie.

And after reading MANY of the other reviews on here I think one of two things is going on. Either there is great inconsistency in the food and service, or there are reviews on here that are not real. Let's just say I have my suspicions. \\n  The eggrolls I ordered were well cooked, but not inedible. That was the high point of my meal, and the only one. The rice balls were far too overcooked, just shy of being burnt. Additionally, they had no flavor. Literally none. The curry was my biggest disappointment. It was ordered as a yellow curry, mild. What I got was some mixture of yellow and red curry. The flavor tasted just like two curries mixed together (and not good, I might add) and the consistency was extremely thin. There were no potatoes, almost no bell peppers, and a very small portion of tofu. The only veggie that seemed to get in in a reasonable quantity were carrots.

I dined here as a party of 5 @ around 8:30 PM on a Sat. They were bustling, but not overly busy. A couple of things made it so I couldn't enjoy my night. Our server decided not to bring us bread until we had ordered apps. A nice tactic to see if we are going to spend money on a first round of food and to keep us from getting filled up so we would order apps. This, coupled with the fact that the service was so slow, meant that we were left sitting there starving for about 20-25 minutes while we were given time to decide on our meals. Seriously? Come on. When people come to a restaurant, they are usually hungry, and you are going to make them sit there until you decide to bring bread? NO, get that out on the table asap. If people are going to order apps, they are going to order apps, if they aren't, they aren't. \\n\\nWe started off with a couple of orders of oysters, clams casino, and beef carpaccio. Once we finally got these about 35 minutes after we arrived, our hunger pains had settled. Three people in my party got the scallops, I got the filet, and my date got the lamb chops. Additionally, we got a few sides to split as well. The scallops seemed to be a big hit, as well as the lamb chops. I found my filet to be a bit dry, but the bone marrow butter and wine sauce helped make up for it. Still, when you are paying that much for a meal, you should expect that everything would be on point. \\n\\nOur table was cleared, and we were offered desert, but declined. Instead, we wrapped it up with some coffee and cappuccinos. The cappuccinos were served along with our empty coffee cups.... leaving us waiting a bit for coffee while our lady friends got halfway done with their cappuccinos. Why wasn't everything served at the same time? \\n\\nThis review wouldn't have been so picky is the service was not on par with, lets say, Chili's. If you want to get away with charging 22$ for 6 oysters, and 38$ for a dried out piece of 6 ounce meat, you better have some stellar service to back it up. This was not the case. \\n\\nAmbiance = Dark and LOUD. Romantic? Sure. Will you be able to hear your date if he or she is soft spoken? No. \\n\\nService = Lackluster and much to be desired.\\n\\nFood = Hit or miss, expensive, and over rated. \\n\\nPrice = Lets just say bring a couple extra bucks just in case, like a hundred or two. \\n\\nOverall, I have had far better experiences at Abe and Loui's and The Capitol Grill.

The best bagels I've found anywhere outside of New York or Montreal--slightly doughy and dense--and more often right out of the oven than most bagel places, since they have to keep baking to keep up with the healthy crowds this place deservedly pulls in. I'm not normally big on bagel sandwiches, but the freshness of the bagels combined with the simple, fresh ingredients, always perfectly grilled with amazing consistency (in 30 egg sandwiches I've yet to encounter an egg that wouldn't have been made less delicious by 30 seconds less or more on the grill), make the combinations real winners. It's just counter service, but the folks behind the counter are so dependably friendly, fast and accurate that it's almost a little weird--you walk in and your heart sinks to see a line of 30 people, but four minutes later you're giving your order, and 3 minutes later you've got your food, and there's no confusion or tension. And somehow there's usually a table available, I don't even get the math on that. On top of everything else, the food here is cheaper than anywhere in town, even for similar dishes. They even get the plain old coffee right--the beans they're using aren't anything special, but it's always fresh-tasting, including the decaf, which already makes the coffee better than 80% of restaurants, and it's never weak or (are you getting this, Starbucks?) bitterly strong, which puts it above most of the other 20%."},{"name":"Carrabba's Italian Grill","address":"4675 St John's Pkwy","city":"Sanford","stars":"3.5","text":"As a vegetarian, I've never really been impressed with the selection at Carrabas, but I have carnivore friends who love it so I eat there occasionally.

We meet at the restaurant for Sunday Brunch.\\n\\nI will start with the positive first. \\n\\nPros: The place is super cute. Small and quaint. The decor is nice and stylist. Everyone inside seems to be happy and enjoying their food. Unlike a lot of places in Atlanta, they will seat your party even though everyone hasn't shown up. Thats a plus since its seems to get pretty crowded in there. \\n\\nCons: The customer service sucks! Customer service is key RIGHT???\\n\\nOkay...here's what happened.\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the restaurant to meet the ladies for brunch, half the party was there. They were already sitting at the table and sipping on Mimosa and other beverages. When I arrived, the waitress came over, took my drink order (water) and informed me she would come back and explain the specials and take our order once everyone showed up. This place gets crazy crowded by 2pm..so if you are going for brunch, I suggest go early. I say that to say since the place is small and quaint...it gets extremely loud and CROWDED in there. I know the owner cant do anything about the noise level however cramming people at table next ours when the space is already tight is crazy. Being cramped was no big deal to me..I can deal with that but horrible customer service I CAN NOT.\\nOnce the rest of the party arrives, one of the other ladies orders a Mimosa. When her  drink arrives at the table she gets her glass of Mimosa and a Carafe of Mimosa. You  may wonder why I even mention that...well there's a reason. One of the other ladies at our table had already been enjoying her Mimosa with no Carafe so she assumed she wasn't get the \\"bottomless Mimosa\\" special that was advertised on the menu. We are intelligent ladies, we can read however the service at this point was a bit confusing. We shrug it off as no big deal and continue to enjoy our brunch (the food was good btw) and finallly we ask for our ticket so we can pay and leave. Upon receiving our bill for our meal we quickly noticed that both ladies drinking Mimosas were paying the same price. Hmmm thats confusing. Call the waitress over and ask her to explain. She tells us that the Mimosa are a set price if you order Bottomless or not. Well if that's the case, why didnt the other lady get a Carafe with her drink? Interesting huh? The waitress said well she could have had some of the other lady's Mimosa since the Carafe was on the table. At this point in our meal, that Carafe is empty. So she ask for a refill on her Mimosa. The waitress said last call was 45 mins ago. Ummmm how were we supposed to know that? We ask her why she didnt inform us of this...at this point everyone is pissed. The owner didnt handle the situation any better than the incompetent waitress. He took $5 off the lady's ticket that never received a refill on her Mimosa or a Carafe...and proceeds to insult our intelligence by telling us that Bottomless Mimosa is written in large print on the menu and then if that wasn't insulting enough, he ask us were can we go in the city and get a $5 drink? Really dude....\\n\\nNote to the owner...NEVER INSULT YOUR CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT, unless you DO NOT plan to be in business much longer.\\n\\nBy the time we paid for our meal, the entire party was noticeably disturbed and irritated with the whole experience of what was supposed to be a nice brunch with friends. I don't believe we were ever offered an apology. I just felt at some point the OWNER should have just taken the charge off the bill. Cut his losses, and plan to train is staff in order to avoid any incident happening like this in the future. A $10 comp would not have wrecked his business for the day, esp b/c his place was packed with customers but b/c he didn't comp his customers and offer to RIGHT A WRONG....he truly lost potential [loyal] customers."},{"name":"ParkGrounds","address":"142 Flat Shoals Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Really enjoyed my first visit at park grounds with my six month old puppy, Lucy.

What we have here is a fairly simple white wine/tarragon mouclade buried (yes, buried) beneath a handful of fries and topped with garlic mayonnaise sauce. Doesn't look appetizing, but to our surprise it mostly worked (I'd still prefer the fries on the side). But one thing was notably missing, and it's the one thing you simply must have to finish off a dish like thls: some nice, crunchy bread to mop up the delicious wine sauce. Granted, you've already got your carbs with the fries, but it's not about carbs, it's about what a dish needs to be complete. Alas, when we asked for bread, they delivered a very small, very soft (no crunch at all) segment of french bread, very thinly sliced as if intended for cold cuts or small slices of cheese (for which it would still have been underwhelming).\\n\\n- Bison slider: Instead of a bun, you get it on about 4 inches of a barely crispy segment of a baguette of french bread. But the taste was outstanding, and they score extra points by including pickled onions on the side. Wasn't sure what to make of the several microscopic gherkins, except to pop them into my mouth after tearing off a bite of the slider.\\n\\n- Redwood hill crottin: Another unusual presentation. This is several unadorned slices of soft goat cheese on top of some sort of marinated or grilled sliced onion, on top of a small, very thin herb omelet. At first we thought the omelet was simply a decorative way of presenting the cheese, so we found ourselves searching for bread initially, but the idea is to eat all three ingredients together, and that certainly made the dish work very well.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nNeeds improvement. Our waiter was absent when needed and unctuous and effusive when present. Another thing: when we first arrived, the person behind the oversized desk at the door totally ignored us. We ended up having to ask whether we were, um, supposed to seat ourselves (we were).\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: \\nThis is a judgment call. Some people like to keep the noise levels high in a place like this. We thought it needed at least a little sound dampening. It really is one of the louder places we know of in town. Bare wood floors, bare walls (except for the wine racks and mirrors), bare wooden chairs and tables, exposed ventilation, and high ceilings. You get the picture. There was no music, which is fine because they would have had to really crank it to compete with the existing noise levels. The decor might benefit from being a few notches less spartan. Lighting was excellent: dim but not too dim.\\n\\nIn short, we recommend the place with genuine but modest enthusiasm."},{"name":"Las Margaritas Latin Resturant Tequila & Rum Sports Bar","address":"1842 Chesire Bridge Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here with my partner to meet with some other friends who was already here for dinner.

It's so nice to have this great patio weather in the fall-like weather we're having, and their patio really does deliver!\\n\\nI had me a caipirinha to start off, and it went down smoothly. Perhaps too smoothly? My dining companion decided there was a bitter taste in it that she wasn't sure about. Well, more for me. Granted, I've had them here where I tasted the bitterness of the limes they use, but this one was quite lovely. \\n\\nI couldn't find anything thrilling on the lunch menu, so I went for tapas. I think I'll have to re-visit this place for happy hour and more tapas again! \\n\\nPao de Queijo: Cheese bread! Made with yucca flour! Don't expect your usual bread consistency, because if you do, you'll think you got undercooked bread. The flour makes for an interesting chewy-ness. And their's are perfect.\\n\\nCalamari: Not your typical calamari. The crusting was great, and they were just drizzled with a nice (if loose) aioli. It was served with a small salad with a citrus vinaigrette that made a nice chance from the usual pomodoro sauce most people serve calamari with.\\n\\nFried Brie: Woah nelly! This stuff is worth the trip by itself! AND they must know fights will break out over this tapa, because it's served with a miniature cleaver with which to..er...cut the cheese. And you'll be glad you did!\\n\\nI wish I wish I wish they'd have their Albari√±o by the glass. That would be great.

She insisted ...and to my surprise.....yummmm yummm... If you have never been ..dont get overwhelmed when you walk in....I did because when I am trying new places I dont like to feel rushed (but this is a somewhat fast food place and people were behind me..) Regardless of all I was feeling the young lady at the front was super patient and she helped me figure out what I wanted while answering 100000000000 questions that I had. I ended up choosing chicken as my meat and kung pao sauce....and \\"score\\"....oh... and instead of white rice I paid an up charge of 99 cents for noodles. There is an upcharge of 99 cents for fried rice and noodles. keep in mind the noodles dont have sauce (which i thought they would be a lo mein type of side but it was plain noodles that they use for lo mein....there is a difference....) however, I was please...the nice young lady at the front gave me extra sauce because I was trying to figure out if I wanted a lunch portion which is 2oz of meat or a dinner portion which is 4oz. I was starving but not to the point that I wanted to feel stuffed and uncomfortable. So the words she used sold me.....\\" get the dinner portion...it has great reheat value\\". Advertisement at its best! This girl needs a promotion to sales/advertisment or something....I am so upset that I cannot remember her name...But keep that in mind folks.... \\"reheat value\\". I she was not wrong!!! Just reheated for lunch and it was even better. So back the the food. The menu is easy but you have options so first choose a meat ( chicken, shrimp, steak...) and then a sauce. It comes with brown or white rice and like i mentioned before you can upgrade/change for 99 cents. The menu also dictated which sauces were hot and you have to option of making any sauce hot upon your request...(they make everything to order... :)\\nAll in all....I will return...quick good chinese food. super clean restaurant. :)"},{"name":"The Harp","address":"85 Causeway St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Okay, this review is going to be quite similar to a few I have done in my brief period here on yelp, it will be two fold.  I feel it incumbent upon myself to write to write ups and you will understand (if you make it through my thesis).. (Based on a game day visit and my several visits on weekends in my younger days)\\n\\nMy GF and I hit the Harp up on Tuesday night prior to the Penguins/ Bruins game at TD Garden.  We arrived about 1.5 hours prior to game time, the upstairs bar was jammed, the second level bar was jammed and we were discouraged and about to leave.  However, we decided to check downstairs.  The bar was crowded, but I noticed a few empty chairs at the end of the bar.  We walked over to the chairs and jackets were on the back of them.  I asked the bartender if anyone is sitting in them? \\"Well, kind of\\"? Eh?? A group of about 6 guys behind us said; \\"We are saving them, we have people meeting us here in a little while and we will need the seats\\"..  Ah, sorry pal but you don't get to hang on to bar seats for however long you like, if you need them, sit in them until the rest of your party arrives.  In his defense, he turned out to be okay and told us to take them, which we quickly did.\\n\\nI was starving, our bartender (Jess) quickly greeted us and poured us our drinks.  Drinks are not worth mentioning really, just a coors light and a glass of house wine, can't muck that up.  However, Jess was very quick and quite friendly.  We reviewed the menu and I knew I wanted Fish and Chips but the GF could not decide.  Jess recommended a Barbecue Chicken Pizza and my GF took her advice.  The food came out quite quickly, and I can say, it was very tasty.  My roll was fresh, no grease seeping through causing the roll to sog up, the fish was cooked perfectly (Cod I believe) and it was delicious.  My fried were cooked nicely, I was very satisfied.  MY GF'S pizza was terrific, crust was cooked perfectly, the chicken was tasty, and sauce quite good.  And, through it all, Jess did a great job, constantly checking on us, as well as the rest of the huge crowd (she was all alone, no bar back) and really was terrific.\\n\\nSo, I would say, if you can get bar seats, great stop prior to a game at TD Garden, and I find some of the food reviews to be a bit over the top, I have found the food to always be pretty good..\\n\\nNow, second half of the review will be quick..  If you are coming here for a weekend, like to hang out with friends, and you are over the age of 25, hit the road!  The place gets JAMMED..  You will pay a 10.00 cover to most likely hear an average cover band and extremely loud DJ.  You will fight like Muhammad Ali to get a drink, and should keep your head on a swivel (as he did) because you may get a blindside punch from one of the hundreds of drunken college fools that stumble here from surrounding universities.  Trying to get a drink? Well, you may want to join SEAL TEAM 6 and parachute in to the bar special ops style, because you are not getting a drink the classic way..  And, the bathrooms??  What??  two lines converge like the 93 and route 24 and there is just as many accidents.  The bathroom are designed for Hobbits, and the drunks that are within probably will be looking for Frodo's ring, so beware.\\n\\nBelow based on five star rating (Gameday and weekend)\\n\\nFOOD                         *** 1/2        ** 1/2\\nATMOSPHERE        ****             **\\nSERVICE                   ****            *\\nOVERALL                 ****             * 1/2"},{"name":"Yumm Teriyaki","address":"87 Peachtree St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Awful.

We had Costas as our server and he was pretty knowledgeable about the menu as he eventually went on to tell us that he was formerly a chef.  The place was a true steak house with cuts of meat for customers to view as soon as you walk in the door thru a deli style glass display. I had a Margarita while we waited to be seated but as soon as i had it in my hand we were called to be seated.\\nWe were happy with the short wait time and the smiling ladies at the front.  Our glasses were immediately filled with water and Costas started explaining the specials.  After that's done, they go and retrieve the steak tray and bring the different cuts of steak table side so that you get an up close view of which cut you want.  He explained the cuts very thoroughly and where the meat came from and how it was fed.  We had the Shrimp and Scallops appetizer to start and they were great, very well seasoned with plenty of flavor.  She decided on the Kansas City strip and i had the 22-24 oz ribeye.  They were both very tender and delicious.  My girl commented that it was probably the best steak that she had ever had. They were so so flavorful and there was never a mention, let alone a need for any steak sauce to adjust the flavor.  Both steaks came with two huge shrimp and lump crab meet on top.  They were really outstanding.  Along with her steak she had asparagus that was topped with a cream sauce, very tasty.  Mine came with potatoes au gratin and again, delicious but we barely could get through the potatoes as the steaks were so good and very large portions for us.  Everything else you'd expect was there, the bread, water was refilled promptly, Costas explained the available wine selections with recommendations... it was just a great meal and experience for us.  All the wait staff wore aprons\\nThe place was very clean, there were no obstructions that stood out which allowed the many patrons to freely walk about as they wished.\\nThe restrooms were clean, tidy and had a fresh smell.  The dress code was casual but you could dress up just as easy - this can easily be a formal dinner restaurant.

Not by just a hostess but by a lineup of eager servers. They were cordial and efficient, which was not the case the first time around. They refilled the waters, did a swapping of the plates, and the bathrooms were clean. I was already in a happy place.\\n\\nThen the food hit me (again). Samosas were a tad dry, the naan was a tad too chewy for my tastes, and the traditional chicken curry was just bland to the bone. Not much to report on the lamb rogan josh, which was equally unmemorable. There was a group wide consensus in the disappointment of the mixed grill, which included shrimp, chicken, and seekh kebabs. All were lacking quality flavor, to which we felt defeated.\\n\\nThere were some standouts however, and dishes certainly worth mentioning. First off, the sag paneer was creamy and hearty. Chunks of paneer cheese bathing in a soft, fluffy pillows of spinach is always best accompanied by rice and a voracious appetite. The rasmalai is always a welcome treat in Indian desert land, which was in the paneer realm of creamy and just sweet enough to notice.\\n\\nReturns are to be merited and the prices are still so reasonable after all of these years. $8.95 buffets that include any semblance of meat is a rarity for Indian buffets nowadays, but I'm hoping India Grill continues to make improvements in all facets."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Brunch review: \\n\\nOverall I really enjoyed my meal here.

The wife of the chef, who runs the front of house, is especially charming and welcoming.  \\n\\nI was able to try the following dishes:\\n\\nA pea soup with lemon foam amuse -  The lemon foam was light and had a clear lemon flavor on its own. When combined with the pea soup, though, the foam was completely masked by the saltiness of the soup.  It was unfortunate because the texture of the soup was excellent.\\n\\nCured trout with compressed cucumber, shaved rye bread, and radishes - I did enjoy this dish and thought the trout was fresh and flavorful.  It was tasty, but it was not the best trout I've ever had.\\n\\nSeared bay scallops with foie gras - This dish was so overseasoned that it was hard to appreciate the freshness of the seafood.  The diced pear accompanying the dish was quite good but not enough to cut through the saltiness of the rest of the dish.\\n\\nSturgeon with dill emulsion, potato gnocchi, and black truffle \\"caviar\\" - Again, I found the Sturgeon to be very salty, and the dill sauce was quite powerful.  The fish itself, though, was cooked nicely, but I couldn't appreciate its flavor when it was so overseasoned.  The black truffle caviar really did look of roe, but it had no flavor at all.  \\n\\nWaygu beef with potatoes and carrot - I found the beef to be chewy, and it lacked flavor.  The gravy on its own was on the salty side.  The carrot was quite hard and difficult to cut through even with a steak knife.  The potato was fine.\\n\\nLemon souffle tart - The souffle was the best dish of the night.  The texture of the souffle was perfect, and the tart had a nice tartness to it.  The crust of the tart was a bit hard.  The fruit accompanying the dish (blackberries, figs, and raspberries) was especially good and unmessed around with.  The raspberry sorbet had a nice texture and flavor.\\n\\nFig jelly and shortbread petits fours - I found these petits fours to be nice but not especially memorable.  The shortbread was a bit on the dry side.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, it took about 10 minutes to get the attention of our server, which was frustrating.

When we approached the manager as we were walking out, explained we had not been acknowledged, and his response was \\"were you seated outside?\\" We weren't seated outside, but to me sounds like if we were that must be a regular complaint if he's asking, and the service must be poor more often than just tonight."},{"name":"Saddle Up LBV","address":"8200 World Ctr Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Thank goodness experiences like this are rare, but this restaurant missed the mark in almost every way possible.  Upon entering the restaurant we were told to seat ourselves, and although we wanted a booth, the booths were not quite big enough for our family.  One of the employees said there were large tables in on the other side, but they were all high tops which wouldn't work with our two year-old, so we decided to take up two booths.  That same employee who offered us a table, then offered to bring over some games for our kids, but that never happened, she seemed more interested in playing darts the whole time we were there, not sure if she was a manager, or just an off the clock employee...very strange.\\n\\nAt that point, our server took our drink orders and we waited a long time for those.  I ordered an iced tea mixed with lemonade but only received just plain iced tea, not the worst I've ever had, but pretty close.  She then took our orders which  began almost an hour wait for our food.  \\n\\nWe got to watch the table behind us who arrived after us get served their food and even a check before our food came out.  Server was apologetic, but her excuses didn't make any sense, she said they had a rush of people...who I did see at the pick up window, but they  came in AFTER we placed our order ...the kitchen was down a fryer...well, we didn't order anything fried except the side of fries.  Mom and I ordered salads and couldn't understand why they didn't even bring those out before the rest of the orders.  The waitress, although friendly offered to take 10% off the check, which was the same amount of discount I got for checking in on the app.  On the check the discount said: \\"Disney 10%\\".   So clearly they give the discount to Disney employees, but she passed it off as a recovery discount. \\n\\nFinally, the food--some of the food comes out--and I'm one who will forgive all kinds of service missteps if the food is on point, but none of us were happy with our orders.  The biggest disappointments were the ribs my husband ordered, which were quite tough and too spicy for him, but are not described as spicy on the menu.  The pulled pork I ordered had a decent flavor and texture but was sitting in a pool of grease.  The cornbread was pretty good, but the toast had a stale texture to it.  Missing from our orders, were: one of the salads, an order of corn bread and a side of the fries.  \\n\\nOverall, a poor experience from start to finish.  I was hoping for a manager or someone to check on our table at any point so I could express my concerns but that never happened.  Definitely will not be back, there are much better options for BBQ in the area."},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"What a great restaurant.

We were asked by the person who seated us whether or not we would be using any special discounts, and he didn't bat an eye when I told him about our groupon.  The server took our groupon number and informed us that certain items were not allowed under the groupon (pasta of the day and daily specials.... this didn't bother me until a table got seated later and their server let them order the rack of lamb that was day's special with their groupon).  Our server was polite and prompt.  We had the ricotta goat cheese dip as our appetizer, and it was served with bread instead of the advertised chips.  It was good, but it wasn't the culinary masterpiece others have made it out to be.  Our food took forever to come out (almost an hour), right as I was going to ask about it, our server let us know that our ticket was next and our food would be out soon.

On one occasion I checked in with the hostess about an hour ahead of time so that we could enjoy a few drinks. During that time the hostess approached us three times to see if we would consider eating earlier than our reservation. Another time I took my wife for her birthday. My steak arrived DOA, burned to a crisp. The waiter then agreed to have another one prepared. The problem was that they then rushed the second steak so badly that it was charred horribly on the outside and raw on the inside. Rather than ruin my wife's birthday by causing a scene I waited and sent the restaurant's manager a letter the next day with a copy of my credit card receipt. About a month later I noticed a credit on my Amex card. Never got any call or note from anyone connected with the restaurant.

It's usually buyer beware and a case of dissentry or food poisoning or both that will follow.  If the price is too good to be true and the food \\"uh Oh\\"\\n\\nThink about it.  \\n\\nFood that is offered too cheap, you just have to wonder how they do it?  Especially with AYCE and most importantly with Sushi.  The last thing you want, is bad, raw fish.\\n\\nIn this case, at this very restaurant, this is the exception.\\nIt's probably the least expensive for Japanese food and the quality is good enough that you shouldn't have to worry like I would, if I were going to some AYCE place.  \\n\\nThe service is a bit lacking but I didn't encounter bitchiness like some other reviewers had written. \\nThe food,  I would give a 2.5 to 3 stars (but it's not \\"real\\" Japanese food).\\n\\nMy food critic from Japan thinks it wasn't as good and after much debate she decided to offer the food a generous 2 stars. For the cost factor, because it's so affordable to eat here, it would round out to 3 stars.  OK 2.5 stars for the facial smudges on the windows.  Quite funny.\\n\\nI found myself agreeing to the same process in the outcome of overall ratings for this review.\\n\\nNow you have to ask  yourself this.  It's quite important, so that you know what you are about to expect. -\\n\\n-A 5 star hamburger at a fast food joint isn't quite the same as a 5 star hamburger made by a famous Michelin rated chef made from top quality ingredients.  You have to base it on the cost, food factor, flavour. presenation. location and more..\\n\\nIn some cases even those aren't part of the equation and you simply can't compare apples to oranges.  Like a Big Mac to a Kobe beef burger.\\n\\nIn this case, it's like Chinese Mandarins VS Japanese Mandarins.  They are different, but yet the same. Often the comparisons are not made fairly, yet to some an orange is an orange.  My Japanese food critic is very traditional when it comes to cuisine from her part of the world.  She can be very critical at times because of her rooted traditions in how Sushi is supposed to be made, how the rice is supposed to be cooked and the way it is all supposed to be made and presented.  I say \\"wax on wax off\\". :)\\n\\nKi Sushi is a Chinese Mandarin.  I like Chinese Mandarins, but if you didn't know what it was before you ate it, you might get it mixed up for a Japanese Mandarin orange and think, \\"it doesn't taste quite the same\\" or \\"There's seeds in this?\\"\\n\\nThat's becuase here, the food may sound and look similar,  It's classified as Japanese, yet it's different.  From their perspective in the way it's created and the ingredients are the same, but. there's no Zen factor.\\n\\nSo, for me, if I want cheap but good sushi and don't care too much about the service and I'm in New Westminster.  I'll come back.\\n\\nYou can't beat the price.\\nAnd it's the combination of the good taste, price and decent quality that solidifies it in a good review.\\n\\nThe customer service is kind of expected from what you get here. So a trade off I assume is expected.  To be fair, we had a good waitress and the other would have been good, but maybe it was her first day.  There were others but maybe we were lucky?\\n\\nIf you just want Japanese style food at great prices and are very hungry, it's worth the visit.  If you want Kobe beef and Lobster sashimi from Japan and Blowfish and stuff.  You'll have to pay alot more and somewhere else.\\n\\nHere, you can eat the stuff everyday on a decent budget, if that suits your fancy."},{"name":"Marco's Cafe & Espresso Bar","address":"7910 SW 35th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great coffee and amazing breakfast!

Chicken under a brick revealed the complete mediocrity of the kitchen with the first bite of vegetable, a clump of plain, steamed broccoli...no salt, no pepper, no butter, no olive oil, nothing done to it whatsoever than to throw it in the steamer and put it on the plate as an obligatory garnish. That says a lot about the effort and attention paid elsewhere. The chicken was adequately cooked, but the skin wasn't crisp at all, and it was virtually flavorless...no herbs/spices to speak of. The mashed sweet potatoes didn't seem to be anything more than steamed, pureed sweet potatoes, with no additional preparation that I could detect. The dumplings I started with could've come from Trader Joes (not a horrible thing, but I expect better at $10 a plate) and were accompanied by crappy, mass-produced sweet-chilly sauce. In retrospect, my wife's fries at the start told the whole story...obviously bag-frozen and competently fried. The whole restaurant is an obvious cynical attempt to make a buck by someone who knows their way around a kitchen like a squid on a bike."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This was one of the best breakfasts I've had in years (not counting brunches, but brunch is the magical breakfast with alcohol).\\n\\nThe biscuits were excellent, the coffee was great, and I tasted pretty much everyone elses food and couldn't have been happier.

I had a combo of the mochi chicken (or did they call it mochiko chicken?) and meat jun, also at my friend's recommendation (I don't pretend to know much at all about Hawaiian food). Total cost: $7.5 for the combo.\\n\\nI'll get the bad out of the way first (some of which is nitpicking):\\n- Wait is long. I was the 9th customer in line (though they all already ordered) and the wait was a little over half an hour, although my friend says this is the longest wait he's heard of, so it could have just been an odd time of the day.\\n- Rice is a bit mushy and overcooked. I'm not sure if it's just them or if this is authentic to Hawaiian cuisine, but, for my personal tastes, it's overcooked.\\n- Mac salad a little lacking in flavor, could use a bit more salt/tang.\\n\\nNeutral:\\n- Kimchi and potsticker obviously store bought (which I don't mind); both not bad, but did not stand out.\\n\\nNow the good! \\n- Wow, seriously good quantity to price ratio. I was charged the price of the mochi chicken ($7.5) instead of the meat jun ($9) for the combo, which I appreciated and made up for with tips. These are good, hearty people who serve good, hearty food. It was a lot of food for $7.5... \\n- Chicken was very well seasoned (but not overly so), crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Delicious.\\n- I've never had meat jun before, but I was very impressed with their version of it. I may have let the lunch sit a bit longer than I should have (I drove home to eat instead of eating right there) so it was not as crispy, but, like the chicken, the meat jun was well flavored, the meat was tender, though next time I'll eat right there so it's more crispy.\\n- The sugar/vinegar/soy sauce/garlic dipping sauce!! That was, for me, the highlight of the meal. It made the jun, which is slices of beef dipped in batter and deep fried, seem LIGHT. I devoured it. The sauce balanced out both the chicken and the beef. Well done!! \\n- Furikake on rice is a nice touch :) \\n\\nWould I go back? You bet!

Don't forget to check the specials on the sign as you enter the door.  I've been going there for about 7 years and find that it's consistently good.  They give complimentary bean sprouts to all who enter along with those nice warm cloths to cleanse your hands.  I always start off with their tuna kobachi (medium heat) which has never disappointed me.  Tuna is so fresh and has just the right amount of spices and mixed with some soy sauce--yum.  One of my favorite rolls is the Dream Roll which is spicy tuna wrapped and lightly fried and topped with this great sauce (it's a must every time I go there).  Another favorite is the Sebring Roll which has assorted fish, asparagus, cream cheese among other goodies and flash fried.  My workplace is in the downtown area so we have tried most of the sushi restaurants in the area and one thing that I've noticed is that Fuji has reasonable prices and their rolls are quite substantial in filling - not substantial with the rice-which is a plus in my book.  They have a decent selection of wines (I was surprised to see Red Diamond on their wine list at around $5.00 a glass), sake and beers.  Service is usually very good and the staff is pretty knowledgeable about the offerings.  Parking is free and easy (no valet here unlike the new kid on the block across the shopping center).  If you require the snobbish atmosphere and more expensive bill, go elsewhere.

We settled on wine selections from the menu although you can purchase a bottle from their extensive offerings beautifully displayed along the walls and enjoy it during your visit.  It took a nanosecond to decide on dindin once we saw grouper on the menu.  This was a nice size portion of perfectly prepared fish on a bed of fresh tomato slices, a potato crisp and yellow squash.  The veggies were just enough to accentuate the fish and not overpower.  Perfection!  For dessert we were adventuresome and chose the olive oil cake with avocado ice cream.  Wha??  Yes, you read correctly.  This is so crazy good I could eat it everyday!  The avocado is only faintly detectable with hints of clove or some other spice popping up.  The cake is moist and delicious and served with a gingersnap crisp on the side.

Not the bistro at Congress, not the restaurant.

Lots of ceremony and invented tradition. Plenty of botanicals, herbs, spices, syrups, bitters, beakers, flasks, colloids, emulsions, mystical chants, and secret ceremonies. The staff is, as it should be, remote, aloof, and a bit imperious. They do not want to hear how you think you would like your drink to be made--that would be like telling the chef how to stir your risotto. They just want a quiet five or ten minutes, alone, to make your drink with precision and panache.\\n\\nProblem is, I just wanted a plain, old-style, country-club, your father's martini with an olive. On the rocks, if you can believe that.\\n\\nThis sums it up: Which of these gins were not stocked by Bar Congress: Bombay Sapphire, Boodles, Tanqueray, Gordon's, Gilbeys, Plymouth, and Beefeater.

Pad Thai is usually one of the items we order at other Thai restaurants, but we saw that they also had Pad Thai Woon Sen on the menu.  Our waiter explained that it is very similar to Pad Thai except that vermicelli noodles are used instead of the usual thin rice noodles, so we decided to try it.  Had to have some curry too, so we ordered Yellow Curry with Tofu.  I appreciated that the curry sauce in it was thick enough to stick to the food, rather than being thin and watery.  Really, all three items were delicious. . .but there were just some minor things that could have been a little better.  The vermicelli noodles in the Pad Thai Woon Sen was totally clumped together like a lump of dough. . .annoying, but it still TASTED good.

I'm a huge Indian cuisine fan. However, if AAB's Bexley location was my only option for Indian food, I would never touch it again.\\n\\nI placed a take out order by phone. My order consisted of Chicken Mahkni and gajar helwa. When I arrived to pick it up on my 30 minute lunch break, I discovered that the woman who took my order entered it as chicken curry. Additionally, she informed me that they don't have any gajar helwa.\\n\\nI politely informed her that she wrote my order down incorrectly - I ordered chicken Mahkni, not curry. She rolled her eyes and said she would have them make the mahkni if I would like (I would like what I ordered, please). I told her that I was really looking forward to the gajar helwa, but would take kheer as a replacement. Huge mistake on my part! (I would think that the kheer would be on the house considering that she tried to serve me the wrong food, which I now have to wait and return to work late for. And they didn't have the gajar helwa that I ordered. Am I wrong?!)  \\n\\nEnough about their below average service. Lets get to the food review: The chicken in my chicken mahkni was tough, dry chunks of chicken. The sauce was bland and I didn't find 1 cashew or raisin. Disappointing, but not quite as disappointing as the kheer. I don't know who decided to call whatever they served me \\"kheer\\", but it was (I'm not exagerating) watery milk with a very faint cardamom taste and something that resembled several bits of rice at the bottom.\\n\\nIf friendly service matters to you and you want good quality food, find some other place.

The meat of the salmon was smoked to a perfection, moist and tender meat at its center.The Corn and Crab Emulsion sauce was gave the salmon a touch of southern favor and compliment the smoky favor of the fish. Lastly, the stuffed crab ravioli was good. I like the crab stuffing but the noodle itself was a little rough to my taste.

The cups were kinda small and the straws were cheap.  The PB&J my kids had was bad.  The toasted bread was too hard for a 2 year old to eat and it was slathered with gobs of jelly and peanut butter.

All of the food sounded very \\"rich\\" as I kept checking-off things from my list of options.  The menu bares no resemblance to what was formerly offered at the Standard.  Sure, it's definitely intriguing, since most (if not all) menu items had an ecletic twist in one way or another.  Peppered throughout are dishes with ingredients such as kimchee, pimento cheese, bento bacon, etc., and the only hamburger listed came with a fried egg (amongst other things) on top.  Not the first time I've seen that on a menu, yet I can't appreciate it because I prefer one or the other.  Fried egg and hamburger together?  This little piggie just doesn't get it.

Couple that with some nice retro decor and you've got a cozy pocket of Little Italy that takes its pork seriously along the south Cambie strip. \\n\\nThe service was quick and courteous. I ordered a porchetta plate which came fork-and-knife style vs. sandwich style. It also came with a side of rosemary infused potatoes. \\n\\nThe food came out fairly quickly (although I did come during an off-peak time). The porchetta itself was a big slice. The skin was very crispy. Although it was a bit too crispy - if there is such a thing - to the point where I was only able to break the pieces of skin with my teeth instead of a fork. The sage stuffing was pretty strong but I'm a fan of sage so it's all good. The most inner circle of the porchetta (the core if you will) was unfortunately a little dry and harder to chew. The abundance of sage and garlic mayo helped this go down easier. However, the outer portions where the fatty (aka good) stuff were soft and flavourful. \\n\\nThe rosemary potatoes were out of this world! so much so it deserved its own paragraph. They were so soft and had the right absorption of pork belly juice runoff. Highly recommended for the bellies with the 6th gear. \\n\\nThe price is comparable to Meat & Bread's porchetta. I paid an extra couple for the side of 'tatoes. \\n\\nOverall, pretty solid piece of pork that will keep you full for a few hours. -1 star for slight dryness.

The lights are not the least bit dimmed for dinner, as one would usually expect for a weekend at 9pm.  Personally, the lighting was too bold, but I do understand the reasoning.  The handful of chefs running the kitchen and presenting their creations to each table need the light to see what they are doing and keep the overall energy of the restaurant high.   Again, little things like this also make the experience unique and fun.  Similar to the experience at a tapas restaurant, I really enjoyed being able to taste many small, different dishes.  The chefs basically prepare dishes and offer the same to the guests at each table (which are set up as long \\"family style\\" table).  At first I felt bad turning down any of the chef's dishes, but really, I don't think they take it to heart.  It was also nice to have a casual conversation with Chef Kevin Gillespie, who was eager to expand on the inspiration for the restaurant.

The restaurant was quite empty at that time (1 pm on a weekday), so the service was fairly quick. \\n\\nThe bread they gave us was over-buttered, so I didn't have any. But that's ok. I don't judge a restaurant based off their bread.\\n\\nSince we had 3 people, we each ordered a different appetizer and shared. I got the steak tartare, which I liked the best. As with all tartares, I couldn't eat too much of it, but it was good. The mussels/clams/whatever wasn't too good; I personally didn't like them. The bisque was decent, but the tartare was definitely the choice to make.\\n\\nWe did the same thing with the main dishes. I got the salmon, which was delicious. I'm not usually a huge fan of salmon, but this salmon was 1) a big portion, 2) cooked perfectly, and 3) not too heavy or doused in sauce. My friend's steak wasn't impressive at all; I have had better steaks elsewhere. My other friend's chicken/hen dish was pretty good. It paired really well with the mashed potatoes at the bottom. My other two friends like the hen the best; I personally liked the salmon.\\n\\nFor dessert, there were only 2 options. 1 friend got the apple tart, and me and my other friend got the banana foster. Again, I was happy with my choice. The banana could've been a little bit warmer/more caramelized, but it paired well with the ice cream and you could taste the alcohol, which was nice. The apple tart was nothing special. I don't think either of my friends enjoyed their desserts, but I was more than happy to finish them off since they didn't want them.\\n\\nAll in all, I would only go here for the price fix $25 lunch special, because that's the only reason it'd be worth it. And even then, make sure you pick what you like. I'm glad I picked what I did, but if I had picked something else, I'd probably not have been as happy."},{"name":"Sala's Hawaiian Slurp Shack","address":"1803 E Semoran Blvd","city":"Apopka","stars":"4.5","text":"GREAT PLACE WITH A FRIENDLY STAFF AND OWNERS WHO ARE HANDS ON!!

The burgers were pretty decent, although not as juicy and tasty as I've had, the steak frites and risotto were good, and pork loin I thought to be a little dry as well. \\n\\nThe service was also incredibly slow. While the appetizers and drinks came fairly quickly, it had to have been close to an hour before the entrees came. \\n\\nI should mention also that I've come for brunch too, which they do a pretty good job with.

While the we were seated with our novels, I mean menus. The menus were a little overwhelming because it's about a dozen pages.

In front of the waiter they said, \\"Don't order from this waiter. He's terrible. All of your food will be cold by the time he gets it to you.\\" At this point our jaws were on the floor and the waiter walked off.

I ordered the Clams and Scallion on a bed of lo mien but when the food came out my clams looked great. However each clam had one, yes one, noodle sticking out of it. I was a little perplexed because a dozen noodles hardly makes up a bed. The waiter immediately got his manager who preceded to tell me I had ordered the cheaper (appetizer) dish. I explained to him that I ordered the dish that was $18 and therefore was aware that I was ordering the more expensive dish. It was quickly fixed. \\n\\nThe waiter threw in some ice cream bon bons for all the mishaps but there was still one more accident! As he refilled our water he spilled it all over the table.

Why do I trust this man? \\n\\nI haven't had anything Greek in a while so I decided to go with his plan since he said he brings all his business visitors there whenever they are in for meetings. I forgot they're all men and will think nearly anything is exquisite.  It's not so much a matter of the food but more about the freshness and atmosphere. It helped the score more. If you gave me this food just as a taste test, it would have easily scored it a 2.5 to 3.5 stars. Greek food can be better than this.\\n\\nThe Hubs started out with ordering hummus which was nothing special. It is difficult to mess that up and even the worst Greek places easily make this dish well. I ordered the steak/beef kabobs. I can't remember what they were called but I instantly assumed it was like a Persian Koobedeh which is seasoned minced meat pressed onto a skewer and grilled. I realized, after looking at pictures, that I had ordered cubes of steak. My husband ordered some kind of protein plate with green cabage slaw. The kids got a quesadilla and ham and cheese sandwich. Note: Never order anything cheese related in a Greek place. You will always get some kind of Velveeta or Kraft American cheese. My kids didn't like the quesadilla and the ham sandwich was just okay. The only real cheese you will get is feta. Skip the quesadilla if your kids are used to real cheese.  That was a waste of money. Anyway, I got my plate and I just sort of looked at it for a minute because it looked blah. The steak was charred, nearly burnt with the onions and peppers on the wooden skewers nearly burned to death. They were so thin and black that it wasn't worth eating unless I liked ashes. I tried to pull the meat off and ended up flinging the food onto the table because it was stuck. The mixed vegetables as a side was over cooked with soggy broccoli which looked like I got one piece of broccoli cut into a bunch of pieces and cooked too long. The slices of onions were okay. I can assume they threw it all in the pan together and ended up with brown broccoli.  Onions take longer to cook so they should have been cooked first. The potatoes were also boiled too long and became a pile of bland mush. I crushed pepper on it but it didn't help. The Hubs then tells me to try his dish.

If you want real Greek, Austin offers better. I first graded this place as a 4 star but as I started to type this out and was reminded of how most of my food was over cooked,  I had to go down a star.

Very clean and organized, very well put together. Its is quite a large restaurant. \\n\\nCustomer service: from the door to being served it was a great experience. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waitress who happened to be pretty new there helped us a lot. When she did not know the answer she went to ask and came with an answer.\\n\\nFood: First off all, the portions are plentiful and the sushi pieces, especially the Sahsimi were quite big which I was surprised. I mean you don't want sushi pieces to be overwhelming, you want them balanced and I think it was pretty close to perfect. We had a few thai dishes, a few chinese, and a big sushi boat. That boat was one of the best i've had. The scallop and crab appetizer dishes were mouth watering.\\n\\nPrices: Well, we had the Groupon and had a lot of food. We were surprised how small the ending bill was which was good that way the tip would be so much bigger. Overall prices without discounts are great for the type of food and atmosphere. \\n\\nOverall we had a great experience.

I am not vegetarian but tend to eat meat kind of sparingly (just how I was raised), like a few times a month.

I appreciate that there's lots of good simple tea too. The grounds are really pretty and the dining room is spacious and calm.

They reheated well and were enjoyed by both - the end."},{"name":"Babs","address":"814 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The amazing brunch here is only outdone by the great atmosphere and service.

Maybe I went into this with bad vibes after spending literally 20 minutes trying to find a parking spot. I still ended up three blocks away from the cafe. After hiking from my car, my three year old and I met up with a friend at the cafe. The friend and I were talking about serious stuff, and the cafe was almost too quite. I felt like everyone could hear what we were saying. Also, I ordered orange juice for my daughter and they gave it to her in a pint glass...not a great idea for someone who spills something about 1,000 times a day. :) I only had tea, so I can't review the food or coffee. It may be a great place to go under different circumstances."},{"name":"Mick Morgan's","address":"118 Needham St","city":"Newton","stars":"3","text":"We were doing an errand out in Needham on Sat. and wanted to grab a quick lunch and with Yelp's help found Mick Morgan's. \\n\\nCozied up at the bar and had a few beers and a great lunch!  \\n\\nChicken soup was so yummy, a \\"real\\" corned beef sandwich and the Irish Stew...mmmmm!
