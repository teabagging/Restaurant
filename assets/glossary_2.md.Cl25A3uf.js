The menu is on the wall and there are only 3 people that work there. The chef, the server an the dish washer. They are fast. It isn't fancy but it is clean. I had the squid linguini puttanesca and it was slightly too salty for me. Otherwise very good. Hubby had scallops linguini with white wine sauce. It was fantastic. Daughter had fish and chips. Very good and a lot of it. The only complaint, if you can call it that, is its over priced....and I believe by a lot. My meal Was an app size and was 15.00. Hubby was 25.00 and daughters were, I think, 18.00. Go there...yes...be prepared to spend the money...yes. I would have done 3 1/2 stars, but wasn't available.

I usually don't like grits, but I could see how it was an award winning burger.  Finally, for my dish, the Smoked Chicken Wings is a must-try dish.  This is actually from the starter menu but I ordered it as a entree.  If you're not a big fan of tater tots, I would recommend the wings as a starter.  It was crispy on the outside and juicy inside.  There's two flavors that you can choose from, Coca-Cola BBQ or the Honey Chipotle BBQ.

For fun kicks, try the sardines (the freshest sardines ever) or the deep fried chicken liver chucks (it's like an Italian meatball stew!)  Overall, this restaurant has everything, hands down. On Friday nights, stay for the live flamenco show and watch the trio go bananas as you sip on savory sangria!"},{"name":"Commonwealth Restaurant and Market","address":"11 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here with a party of 5 for brunch on Sunday. This was my third time eating brunch here. I always get the Chicken and Biscuit, which is $14, comes in a very generous portion, and is delicious. I like getting chicken and waffles or any variant thereof whenever I go to brunch places, and out of the ones I've been to in Cambridge/Boston, the chicken here is definitely one of the best - it's not overly fried and it's very tender and juicy. I also got lemonade, which came in a tall glass and has free refills ($4). I also got 6 oysters ($1 each), which were pretty fresh so I think it was a great deal. Our server, Emma, was also very nice.\\n\\nI only have a few complaints. They only serve their brunch menu on Sundays, and it's hard to get a table with a large party unless you make a reservation or are willing to wait. Also, I don't know when their patio for outdoor seating is open, but it wasn't open today even though the weather was nice. Lastly, my friend got an orange juice, which cost $5 but only came in a short glass, and he asked for a refill but it wasn't even free! So he ended up paying $10 for two small glasses of orange juice, which seems like a total ripoff."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This is one of my favorite places for brunch in Cambridge.

We got in on our third time trying to eat here (usually we can't wait that long and end up eating somewhere else) and had a 1.5 hour wait. The parking is also pretty limited around the area but they do offer valet parking if you are willing to spend money on that. \\n\\nBrunch is done buffet style and there are two rooms in which the food is spread out. The waiters come by and take your plate when you're finished and you can move on to the next plate as many times as you want.

There was one person working in a small cafe that served a bunch of crepes and various drinks. My date and I both had the caramel apple crepe and hot chocolate. The hot chocolate came in a large cup and it was quite good. The crepe on the other hand was not as soft and delicate as I like them to be and most of the ingredients to the crepe were on top (all of the apples were on top and the only thing inside were the nuts), which was confusing and a bit difficult to eat.

Unlike what I had seen on television, the clam chowder was neither packed with fresh clams nor flavorful.

The cole slaw in the sandwich absolutely killed the taste and made the sandwich too sweet--which is not how I would ever imagine a pastrami sandwich tasting. The French fries were the best part but you could probably get the same type of fries at Silvertone or any other place around the corner.

In the evening, candles cast a golden glow over the medium-sized space and complimentary sparkling water is automatically brought to your table.  This would be a great spot for a date or a casual treat meal.\\n\\nThe food options are very veggie-heavy, so vegetarians and vegans can look forward to a bounty of choices.  And these people know how to coax insane flavors out of their veggies.  At first I was puzzled by the concept of a riceless risotto (instead made with fresh corn in a creamy poblano sauce), but the end product was delicious, tossed with delicate and meaty lobster mushrooms.  I wouldn't normally gravitate towards artichokes, but the grilled artichokes in brown butter and sumac were off the charts, with the tangy lemony sumac balancing the richness of the butter.  Had I been strategic, I would've saved some of the house-milled sourdough bread to sop up the remaining sauce.\\n\\nThe one off note for me was a fettuccine in a pork and fennel ragout.  I don't eat pork, but tried a portion of the noodles and found them to be unpalatably salty.\\n\\nPortions are indeed on the smaller side (I guess the \\"tapas\\" connection?) and on the pricier end, no doubt in part because of the quality of the ingredients that they source.

The pork skewers were good but overpriced... Came with great sides that complemented it, pretty standard pickled cucumbers and curry/peanut sauce. Rice is so pricey at 2$ a portion and one portion is more like half of one when you get the sticky rice. The famous wings should have came out more hot and crispy, thought they were kind of a tough texture. Not sure if that's how they are usually but I thought it could be better, especially for $14 - good thing I was on vacation. Only unique thing about them is the fish sauce touch.

The setting is awesome, the views amazing and you really feel like you are in the thick of it all. The menu is completely dedicated to the Bosox which I love. And there is even a sandwich named after Papelbon -- 'The Papelbomb' which thrills me.  The food was pretty good, we had the 'Street Vendor' pizza-- I have just started trying spicy food so this was right up my alley, minus my friends decision to cover it in tabasco sauce when I wasn't looking. But I enjoyed it none the less. It came out hot and had great flavor and fresh bell peppers and italian sausage. The drinks were decent, I kind of have an issue with the state of Massachusetts liquor laws, aka I think they are a bunch of hooey. Honestly, I went to college in the bible belt and those people allowed for stronger drinks. But that is besides the point and I am getting away from things.\\n\\nNow, for the reason I deducted 1.5, well 2 stars. \\n\\nFirst, the bartender who was serving us was kind of worthless when we first came in. I wasn't hungry right away because it was so damn hot out and I had also just walked for what felt like forever due to my friend wanting me to see every aspect of Fenway. So I didn't order anything except an iced tea. Getting her attention again was like pulling teeth. In fact getting any bartenders attention was a challenge. When I finally flagged her down she made the drink and it really did hit the spot (I got the El Guapo, a combination of lemon vodka, lemonade and iced tea, so refreshing on a hot day!) the only problem was that I tried to order something off the lunch menu which ends at 3, it was 3:10. This would all have been okay if they couldn't make it, but not only did she not even ask, but she was so rude about it I wanted to scream. I get that the kitchen has rules, I am a food service vet. But I also know good and well that asking can work magic. And the bar wasn't busy at all.\\n\\nNow the other reason for the 1/2-1 star reduction, once the bar got busy our bartender started paying attention to us like no other and ignoring the 160,020,820,832 other people around us, causing them to scream in my ear nonstop, and push, and all that. I think she may have just been lazy and it was easier for her to pretend to be serving us then pay attention to them. Also, anytime anyone asked for a drink that wasn't easy she rolled her eyes or complained. My friend and I that were there both worked in bars all through college. At an SEC school. On game day. If you want busy, and drunk, trust me it is the place to be, so I think that may be where my lack of sympathy comes from. \\n\\nAll in all though, I would go back. It just sucks that one person had to kind of screw with my first Fenway experience. Just try and avoid the female bartenders. Kind of worthless."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious food with manageable portions.

Within4 blocks from Gilmore to Willingdon you could find 6 Japanese stores. So what good is another sushi bar around this area? \\n\\nI recently walked by Kokoro and asked myself that question, but due to fact I really did not have a \\"favorite\\" sushi restaurant around the heights yet, I decided to come back and try it out one day. The decor at Kokoro is an old fashion authentic Japanese restaurant. The lighting was dim with lamps made of wood and paper, like those you would expect from a Japanese house. The tables, chairs, wall decoration, and menu were all within that theme as well. There was nothing flashy or new they wanted to do with this place, but in all honesty, it works; it won't stand out and attract a lot of attention, but it works. \\n\\nUsually the first time I try Japanese restaurants, I order the same dishes. Salmon sashimi to find out the size they serve, variations of the house roll (this one was called the North Van roll) to find out how they make rolls, an appetizer (tako yaki this time), and individual nigiri pieces (usually toro to see how fresh the fish is). \\n\\nTo my surprise, the food here was pretty good. My order came quick. The salmon sashimi came in thick cut pieces and tasted extremely fresh. Better than almost all the other Japanese restaurants I've tried within this 4 block radius. The roll that came was good sized as well without filling everything with rice. The tako yaki was mediocre, but they served it with a green salad, I thought that was pretty unique. The toro nigiri was fresh as well, not the best toro I've had but definitely something I may come back to if I have the craving. \\n\\nTo end the dining experience I got the chance to speak with the owners as I was paying. I found that they moved to the Burnaby Heights area from their Lonsdale location because they had kids in the family and wanted to move their business closer to school for their kids. I thought that was an extremely tough decision they would have made since they were probably well known at the old location for over 10 years.

So I have been to this place more times than I can count. That is mostly due to my non-Asian friends. I took them there because if the reviews it received here on Yelp, and they were so pleased that they refuse to go anywhere else out of fear of being disappointed. Mind you, they did not necessarily grow up with Korean food and all that it has to offer beyond the typical white belt fare such as bulgogi and kalbi. But this is not about them. This is about my opinion. Confession time: I am not a big fan of bulgogi. There, I said it. Don't tell my FOB mom. But, I am a fan of their kalbi. It's got just the right balance of sweet and savory marinade, and the fat to meat ratio is pretty good. My only complaint is the portion size. I actually find the prices a little ridiculous given the amount of meat you get. The banchan (side dishes) are merely mediocre, apart from the turnip kimchee. But then again, I LOVE kakdugi, and can't even fathom making my own, so I am not very critical on that point. They also include some BS banchan like weird noodles dernched in mayo, which I think is just wrong. Apart from the BBQ, I think the other entrees like the chigae and fish are slightly less than mediocre. For example, I have tried their doen jang chigae a few times and found it bland. How the hell can something as flavorful as doen jang be turned bland? In any case, I keep returning, and leaving with a full belly, but also full of curiosity of a better place onto which I can turn my friends.\\n\\nIn terms of the service...all I can say is \\"Bless their hearts!\\" I'm half Korean and half Southerner, by the way.

It's completely incomprehensible. Walk down the freezer isle of your local grocery establishment and you'll find Swedish meatballs offered by every single brand. They have to be popular, right? Visit Ikea, one of the few places around to offer the bite size meatwads, and over half of the plates are loaded with balls.\\n\\nMy gal (who also enjoys the balls) and I both ordered the sample plate special ($7 each) to get a variety of offerings. I also decided to get an extra order of meatballs and mashed potatoes ($7.50). The rationale here was that a sampler may be small and I might want a bit more, but if I was full, I could always start off the next morning with a mouth full of balls.\\n\\nOur order was to go, and we were given 3 takeout containers in a bag. When I asked which ones were the samplers and which was the order or meatballs, the delightful woman laughed, held up an entirely different takeout box, and said that was the extra order of meatballs. Oh my, this is going to be a lot of food.\\n\\nSo... The food. The sampler, broken down.\\n\\n1 - Meatballs and mashed potatoes - You get 2 meatballs (hey, it's a sampler!), some mashed p's, cream sauce, and a bit of lingonberry jam. Even with my love of meatballs, this was not my first bite, so my gal had one her hers first. \\"It's very meaty.\\" She exclaimed. As I gave her the look of \\"Yeah, no shit, they are MEATballs, dummy.\\", she continue. \\"They are very dense. Seems like more meat and less filler than other places.\\" It was a pretty perfect description. I'm use to going somewhere and being able to eat countless meatballs of the same size. These obviously have a lot more substance to them. While they were very, very tasty, I can't help but think they might be better if they weren't made with lean ground beef. I felt just a bit more fat would have made them a bit more moist, which would have really been perfect for me. The lean ground beef is probably a draw for others, so I'm probably in the minority here.\\n\\n2 - Hot dog wrap - Thin bread wrap stuffed with an all-beef hot dog, mashed p's, spices, and fresh crab salad. I'll be honest... I was more curious about this item than looking forward to it. Fresh crab salad with a hot dog? It sounded like somebody put the menu together while hanging out next to the truck while the paint dried. \\"A favorite fast food in Sweden after a night out\\". OK, so it's an actual item. It ended up being the surprise hit of the night. No matter how hard I try, I can't think of a way to describe this item. It's so unique, but oh-so delicious. I'm not sure how the size of the sample version compared to when you order it by itself, but I can imagine this fucker can be filling very fast. If I were in public, I probably would have had to explain to a bunch of strangers on how amazing it was. Since I was with my girlfriend and she had her own, she basically just looked at each other with our mouths stuffed, pointed, and approved. I'm planning another trip to Swededish sometime just so I can get a whole one of these.\\n\\n3 - Potato cupcake\\n4 - Cheese and onion pastry\\nI'm lumping these items together because of their similarities. I loved the potato cupcake (don't even ask what's in it, I'm an idiot and figuring that stuff out... Maybe Gargoye skin and cheese?) and really enjoyed the cheese and onion pastry. I could see myself eating a tray of the potato cupcakes, holding a viking sword in one hand, while declaring \\"MORE!\\" from the little people below. Both of the items came with... Well, I'm not entirely sure. It seemed like onions and a little cabbage, but I don't want to say that's what it was because then if I'm wrong somebody might kick me in the dick and say \\"Hey idiot, it was this, not that!\\" So, they came with something. I enjoyed it, but I probably only needed half as much.\\n\\nSo the sampler? Dynamite! What a great deal for $7! Lots of food, and you get all sorts of tastes. It also filled me up enough that I decided to leave the other order of meatballs until the next morning.\\n\\nThe order of meatballs made for a wonderful breakfast. I already covered the items in there. It's just... More. There are only 5 or 6 meatballs in an order, and 3 decently sized scoops of mashed p's. The creme sauce, lingonberry jam, and pickled gherkins are all there too. While the night before I was annoyed that there were only 5 or 6 meatballs, after eating them I understood the numbers a bit more. I would probably campaign for an extra meatball or 2 and lower the amount of tator's, but that's also after the incredible deal that is the sampler plate. Since the sampler is a special though, I don't think it's always going to be an option.\\n\\nIt's not a question of if I'll be back. The question is, \\"How soon is now?\\" Hrmmff.

The \\"smoked\\" salmon was very good the hotate came out very fishy. The quality of the other fish was also questionable. Each piece of Nigiri was also put together badly. The rice fell apart, the garnish's were arranged in random locations.  I can forgive the plating if the food is great but this was unforgivable. \\n\\nThe last serving of disappointment we got was the chicken karaage. They use chicken breast with no \\"breading\\". I think they are closer to baked chicken. I am wondering why they only provided four tiny pieces of chicken. I have never been to another Japanese restaurant that only gave us four sorry pieces of chicken. Well, at least they tasted decent.\\n\\nWe were not disappointed with the service.

I honestly don't know how someone could eat this whole portion alone, since we struggled to split it ourselves. It is huge, fluffy biscuits topped with yes big chunks of crispy fried chicken, a fried egg and of course some thick gravy that had more meat in that too! Wow. I with the gym membership comment on there was true! After this review, time to work out just so I can go back and get me some more of this fatty goodness! So so good. This made our trip there worth it hands down. \\n\\nAnother winner was their blood mary that came with a snack stick which was a big piece of sausage. And it paired well with those oysters too. The other dish we got was their chilaquiles and we almost didn't since most places in Boston haven't wowed us with their versions of it, but the menu said trust them so we did. First, they make it with ground beef which is seasoned really well, but we prefer the chicken version of this dish. There also wasn't quite enough tortilla strip love in this dish either. So I would just focus more on biscuits and fried chicken and gravy next time! \\n\\nAnd if you are in the area and don't want to dine in, they have an awesome market in the front with all kinds of fun produce, house made sorbet and ice cream, spices, all kinds of stuff.

Transparent edged, greasy pancakes are not edible.  Also, only the very center of the grill gets up to 400 degrees and makes the actual cooking really disappointing.\\n\\nAs a group of three, we also ordered a few made in the kitchen items.

The artichokes are meant to be eaten by hand, so we got in there, peeled the layers and dipped them into a lovely creamy sauce.\\n\\nDecor was lovely and intimate!

The memories of the food brings a smile to my face and I wish I could go back again.\\n\\nMy friends and I came at an odd hour so luckily there was no line, which I had feared since many of the reviews mention a long wait.  The seating gets a little tight but otherwise the decor and the smells that invite you as you come in definitely take you to Thailand.  Here are the plates that we ordered:\\n\\nPapaya pok pok: I am a fan of papaya salad so it pains me to say that while this dish was solid, I would say that it was nothing special.  Sure you get the crunchiness of the papaya and soft fresh tomatoes marinated in the spicy Thai chili and lime juices one would expect from a papaya salad.  However, given the caliber of the other dishes, I would definitely wish I tried something else.\\n\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings : Probably some of the best chicken wings I have tried... EVER!  The chicken wings are marinated in fish sauce and sugar that gives a great salty sweet combination.  The deep frying after gives it a wonderful crispiness while retaining the chicken meat's juicy and tender quality.  With our group, we definitely wished there were more to share.\\n\\nKaeng Hang Leh (pork belly curry): If you are a fan of pork belly fatty goodness oozing into a spicy sweet curry soup, then you should order this dish!  Give me some good quality pork belly with a good layer fat and I am a happy man.  But with the curry spices, you are getting a nice spice to it.  It is definitely a little bit more soupy than most of your traditional curries, but the flavor was definitely on point.\\n\\nMuu Paa Kham Wan (boar collar meat): What this dish lacks in quantity makes up for in flavor!  In fact, they even provides a plate of greens to help cleanse the palate between bites.  When you first look at the plate you see a few slivers of meat covered in a beautiful fish and lime sauce filled with different colored chilis, garlic, and cilantro.  As mentioned before, it doesn't look like a lot, but man! does it powerful punch of flavor.  You get the heat from the chilis, citrus from the limes, sweet and saltiness from the fish sauce all with a refreshing end note from the cilantro.  \\n\\nThey had plenty of cocktails that I wished I could have tried, but I unfortunately had to steer away from.  However, the wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  We were able to find parking on the street not too far from the restaurant.\\n\\nMy only downside of the restaurant would be that they charge you for rice.  Not that I am against the practice, but how can you honestly enjoy Asian food and not have rice?!  That alone does not take away from my bomb experience though.\\n\\nOverall, Pok Pok has amazing Thai food that I would be willing to drive to Portland again for!"},{"name":"Oak Brewpub","address":"630 E Lake Dr","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"this is the best!!  if you are in the area you need to try this place for beer and great food.! we had trout, chicken, fried pickles lady peas and broccoli.  i can not gush enough. eating outside was great. the beer selection is wonderful. had their ipa, awesome. we will be back in two days. btw, tori is the wait staff that will make you feel special."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"One of the greatest book stores in the world.

However, they seem to be a lot of the same items on the regular menu, but like a good 1-2$ dollars cheaper, so definitely come here during lunch time.\\n\\nThe servers here are all pretty nice, and even though it got a little busy, I felt they were pretty good with coming by to my table quickly, along with water or everything like that.\\n\\nI ordered a bun cha, which was different from what I was normally used to. Typically, the bun cha that I order is like.. a bowl of vermicelli noodles with pork, spring rolls, and fresh vegetables all arranged on top, along with a sweet/spicy kind of dressing that you can put on top. However, the version that I ordered here was actually different, since they actually give you rice rolls and expect you to dip it. Basically how it worked was that you had to dip your rice roll into hot water in order to make it soft. Then, once it softens, you stuff it with the vermicelli noodles, along with the meat, vegetables, and sauce, followed by wrapping it up, creating a kind of spring roll essentially.\\n\\nThe food here was great, and it was a pretty big quantity, much bigger than any other vietnamese place (essentially) that I've ever been to. All this for just around $10, seemed like an excellent deal. \\n\\nI'd really like to come to Boston as little as possible in the future since I've spent way too much time here, but if I'm ever in the neighbourhood, this will definitely be my top choice."},{"name":"Jerusalem Cafe","address":"516 SE Chkalov Dr, Ste 45","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Easily my favorite Mediterranean place, outside of a restaurant I visited in Tel Aviv, whose name I can't remember.

I like the emphasis on hot meals, which is perfect for freezing cold Boston.  They have great salads too which are rooted in their devotion to hummus apparently. \\n\\nI'm from Philadelphia which is green smoothie nirvana, and while Life Alive has the juice thing down pat they're far from green smoothie pros.  I love the humor of some of their ideas such as the Elvis Smoothie, but that epitomizes that lack of green smoothies.  Most smoothies are rooted in different flavor combinations, but only one of which is green out of a menu of like 12.  You can certainly ask to have Kale added, etc. but it's not just adding a green, you need to balance that with more fruits and there should be baby spinach which is easier on the neophyte's palate.\\n\\nFinally, the line is annoying.  They say you can pre-order, which is great, but the pickup area is to the \\"left\\" of the counter, which means cutting in front of a huge line of people.

I got the simple salad and added chicken. That was pretty tasty, I actually had it for lunch today and it held up well. The two stars is mostly for the pizza. I have celiac disease and was excited to see that they have many gluten free options. I was very disappointed with the quality of the crust (it was about 1/4 inch thick and resembled something I could buy frozen) and was not very flavorful. For my toppings I ordered italian sausage, green peppers, kalamata olives and ricotta, along with red sauce. There was no ricotta when my pizza arrived, cold, and only one slice of sausage on each slice of the 12 inch, 6-slice pizza. The sauce was not evenly distributed and was rather put on one dollop per slice. Since the cheese was forgotten (I assumed that the pizzas would all come with a base layer of mozzarella, I didn't realize I had to specify that I wanted more cheese, I thought I was ordering ricotta in addition to mozarella that came standard)  none of the topping adhered to the pizza.

The service was so bad.  After an entire hour of waiting for our food I had to ask about it.  They said it would be just a few minutes.  But what they brought in about 5 minutes was a free appetizer.  It was something I never would have ordered, it was very greasy -- which for some folks is fine.  But I was so hungry I chose to eat it.  Then about 20 minutes later our food came.  Unbelievably, my fish was considerably overcooked.  And after eating that heavy appetizer, it tasted even worse.  We would have been better off without any free appetizer.  Having waited 1 hour and 20 minutes from the time of ordering our food, you would think they would have done something other than a free, greasy appetizer.

I didn't have a problem with that but the hostess, stated to us \\"we close at 10pm\\" and I was a little set back from that right from the start. We waited at the two barstools at the bar and got ourselves a glass of wine, while we waited for our table. Once our table was ready it was set up for 4 people and decorated as we were dining with another couple, after we sat there for about 10 minutes a lady brought us bread and water and asked us what we wanted to drink, I request the wine menu so I could chose my wine. When she came back we chose our wine and then continued to wait 25 minutes to receive our glasses. In that time another waitress came back and asked us if we were ready to order but I informed her we weren't ready because they never brought over menus when we sat down. We finally got the menus and I had a few questions about the menu itself and I was given answers like I'll have to ask my manager or very brief one or two word answers, this was a downside because I felt like they didn't know what they were selling to me. I ordered the lobster bisque which was very good and I got a Filet and my girlfriend got the chicken dish which were both very good, they would of been better if what we ordered exactly came out the right way, they forgot a vegetable on her plate and her side of potatoes. I had to ask them to bring them out for us. We were done and I was getting very impatient with the horrible service so we decided to skip dessert and just get the check. I asked the waiter for the check and he said he would be right back, about 10 minutes went by and I still didn't have the check so I asked another waiter to inform the gentlemen that we wanted the check, he came back to our table after being gone for quite awhile and asked us if we wanted dessert and I said no just the check please. Overall the experience of this place I would rate a 1 out of 5 stars because the food was very good, but with the staff they have running the place, I don't give this restaurant more than 6 months before the service staff runs it into the ground and that will be a shame because the food is delicious and the restaurant is very unique. Anyone can go anywhere and eat good food in a gorgeous setting but it's the service that really sells the place. I will probably not go back, unless I knew the service would be 100x better my 2nd time around."},{"name":"Clay Oven Indian Cuisine","address":"7696 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was ok and on a little expensive end.    \\nOur spice level was taken care of as requested.  \\nStaff was friendly."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Spectacular food, including a nice suite of permanent menu items and rotating specialties.

It did take a little longer than she promised.  My breakfast sampler was acceptable.  Sunny side up eggs, hashbrowns, sausage and bacon.

I finally went with a group, and I have to say, I have mixed feelings about this place.\\n\\nI am a pescatarian, and several members of my party are meat eaters, so we got a pretty good sampling of what this place has to offer.\\n\\nI started with the eggplant-mushroom empanada. I have to give this place huge kudos on their empanada dough.  As someone who routinely makes empanadas from scratch, I can appreciate the labor involved. The empanadas at this place were very rustic-looking, and the dough was very flaky and delicious, probably homemade.  My daughter really loved the chicken empanada.  For me, though, the accolades end with the dough. The veggie filling was bland and mushy.\\n\\nFor my main meal, I ordered the congri (rice with black beans), after the waitress told me that it was, vegetarian.  I was surprised to find a huge chunk of what appeared to be pork mixed in with the rice.  I decided to not make a big deal of this, and moved the meat to my husband's plate.  The rice definitely did not taste like it had stewed with meat in it, and that is a good thing.  But, I found it a bit dry (almost as if it sat in the pan for a long time with the heat off) and just not too exciting.\\n\\nThe Cuban sandwich received mixed reviews from my crew.... My 14 YO loved it, but my husband had it on a previous visit was not impressed at all.  He found it to be too meaty, and the meat was dry.  He is rather knowledgeable about sandwiches, so I would definitely take that comment seriously.\\n\\nAnother member of my party had the ropa vieja, and they really really loved it.

The piping hot soup was perfect for a chilly day and quite hearty.  The seafood mainly consisted of tiny shrimp, which I had no interest in however.  I would probably opt for just beef or pork next time.\\n\\nWe ordered the beef for the half order of bulgoghi.  This seemed to be the most common choice, and you can't really go wrong with beef.

The ambiance is more French and definitely more high end than your typical bare bones Asian restaurant.  The menu is standard enough, but what puzzled me was that they only offer pho one day a week.  That's a pretty big SMH moment with any Vietnamese restaurant.  We started off with the spring rolls with shrimp.  Meh, acceptable, but just stuffing them with mostly lettuce doesn't do it for me.  Then we ordered the shaken noodles and the chicken curry.  Disappointed by both.  The shaken noodles were underflavored and the egg noodles slightly undercooked.  Beef and shrimp in the dish were fine.  The chicken curry was equally bad.  Chicken was overcooked and hard.  The potatoes and carrots tasted like they were boiled separately.  No flavor and also undercooked.

One really cool feature is that they sell used books right on the same shelves as the new books so not only can you often find a cheaper \\"pre-loved\\" copy of the book you want, it's also easy to find remainders, out of print books and rarities. Note that Powell's is very popular and can get really crowded during the day, so if you're like me and like to do your book-hunting in a less frenetic environment, try to go in the morning or later at night (they are open from 9 AM to 11 PM daily).

But I understand, the wait was so long (2 hours...), and when I looked around the place, the problem looked to be that there seemed to be only less than 10 or 8 tables in the entire place (not including the long bar of table in the front). But for a small place, they seem to be doing about 500x the business it can sit. They could add on another section of tables or even open up an entirely new restaurant, but I don't know about how the owner would feel about that sort of implication.\\n\\nI would definitely say go and try it, and if it's your thing to go to hip restaurants and try food from everywhere, the wait in line is totally worth it. If it's not your thing, wait until somebody brings leftover wings to you, and try them out and see if the line is worth it. (Also, I would try the drinking vinegar that they carry mixed with a dry soda or something, because that is absolutely amazing.

I lived in Italy and trust me if it's not rotisserie chicken, it's not really the best option. Pasta and chicken don't go together in Italy and they really shouldn't here either, so if it's on the menu, steer clear. If you know what you are ordering here, it's well worth the visit. If you think Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden has good food, then you don't know what you're talking about and you shouldn't be bothering. \\n\\nIf you like New York-ese/Americana Italiana food, this place is not bad. You must order something like their pizza, their raviolis, or their pasta-based dishes to be fully satisfied though. And you will be satisfied, especially with the serving sizes. The best dish I've had there was the Frutti di mare linguine dish and the mushroom raviolis are a close second. They are both fantastic and well worth the visit and price. \\n\\nThe reason there is a disco ball and singers is because this is not only a restaurant, but a space for Oldies singers to come through and sing at and I love that stuff so that just makes it even better for me!

Franklin was on my list (after seeing Anthony Bourdain's show), but I heard the wait time was ridiculous. I did visit La Barbecue, which I thought was pretty delicious, too (sad that the wait time was 2 hours). On my last day in Austin, I decided to hit up another BBQ joint and also bring some back home for family. I was told that Rudy's was a good spot. Unlike Franklin's and La Barbecue, there is no wait! However, the food isn't as great - compared to La Barbecue. But, I think that can be expected. Apparently, they are known for being located next to a Shell gas station. \\n\\nIf you're new to Rudy's, they will give you a special shout out. Unfortunately, I was new and my cashier did not offer me the friendly, loud greetings like some of the other customers around me. I was there for the brisket, which came in 3 cuts - Cutter's Choice, Lean, and Moist. Don't forget to ask for a sample! I personally liked the Cutter's Choice. Moist was way too fatty for me. Don't ask to try the ribs because they won't let you. If you're looking to bring it on a plane, they would be more than glad to wrap it up with extra paper and saran wrap. What I thought was funny, after they get the meat, they put it on a big open tray...that was completely new to me! As mentioned above, the food was good, but not as great as some of the other smaller BBQ joints. \\n\\nI recommend this place if you're looking for some good Austin BBQ, but want to skip the super long waits at Franklin and La Barbecue.

He spilled water and wine each time he refreshed our glasses so by the end of the meal our table was soaked.  We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and after he poured our first glass (and about a  of a glass ended up being on the table) he asked if we would like it on ice.  We said \\"yes please\\" - his response... a disgruntled sigh like he could not believe we would like our wine to remained chilled.  It was almost comical. \\n\\nThroughout the evening, he never once asked how we were, never once smiled and never once said \\"thank you\\" or \\"you're welcome\\".  The best we got was a grunt.  He also basically threw the silverware down between courses as well as our plates.\\n\\nThe highlight of the meal has to be the water service.   There must be a competition with the servers on who can pour the most water throughout the evening.  Serously - aren't we supposed to be conserving water?  Many times throughout the night I asked that he stop refreshing my glass with water.  This was for 3 reasons - 1. He kept spilling water on me and the table, 2. My glass was completely full of ice from the previous pours and 3.  I was not thirsty ANYMORE!  He simply ignored my request.  I finally said \\"I do not want any water\\" and he said he \\"had to pour it because management had video cameras taping water service\\" - What???  When he came for the final time I said \\"please, no more water\\" and had to put my hand over my glass - he poured it on my hand and said \\"I have to pour you water\\".  I replied \\"no you do not; I do not want any more water, thank you\\".  His reply - \\"I have 50,000 people watching me so I have to give you water\\".  I said \\"no you do not\\".  He said \\"give me your glass I am going to take it away\\".  I said \\"no, I would like to keep my glass with the little bit of water I have\\".  He proceeded to argue with me causing a scene at our table and I finally said \\"I am the guest, I wish for no more water and would like to keep my glass, please leave\\".  Needless to say we paid our bill right away.\\n\\nThe food was great- I had the Porcini Salmon. However, I will NEVER step one foot into this restaurant ever again.

I especially love their fresh & dried squid in special salt, their sauteed snow pea leaves, and their won ton soup.  Their barbecue pork is good, too, although I think their duck is a little bony and on the dry side.  It's somehow comforting and familiar to walk in and see all the barbecued ducks hanging there with their heads on, though.\\n\\nDin Ho gets crowded at peak eating times, so be ready to battle for parking and wait for a table.  Great for smaller groups and larger crowds alike, as they have everything from 2-tops to the big, round tables with a lazy susan in the middle.  I'm glad they finally got rid of the gigantic TV in the corner of the room; it was distracting when you were trying to have a conversation (there's still a TV in the room, but it's not the monstrosity that used to be there).\\n\\nDin Ho is located right next to Target on 183 at Ohlen.  It's in a little Asian strip mall, so you can also stock up on Asian groceries, get bubble tea, or pick up something from Sunflower to go so you can eat it at your next meal.  I like to go to Target after I eat and walk around so that one less piece of fried squid gets added to my thighs.\\n\\n---------\\nEDIT, 3/25/08:  I'm surprised I didn't edit this review earlier.  I agree with  Dennis C's comment that Din Ho has gone downhill in recent years.  Although I haven't fully vetted the menu at First Chinese BBQ, First Chinese's barbecue is MUCH better than Din Ho's, in my experience.  I'm leaving Din Ho with five stars simply because - although it's not the best in Austin, it's still among the top five Chinese restaurants in town.  I know that's not really saying much since the field of authentic Chinese food restaurants from which to choose is pretty lame, but when you've gotta have it, you've gotta have it, and Din Ho gets props from me for proving it can be done, even if it's not done perfectly."},{"name":"Thunderbird Coffee","address":"2200 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Coffee's okay, but the staff is rude and they don't know their own store - and they're even ruder when it becomes *obvious* they don't know their own store!

I said it. \\n\\nWhy? Well, not only is there the awkward inability to eat the same foods, but you need to be awkwardly concerned of eating too much of a teeny order being passed around. I hate that. \\n\\nI hate getting the bill when 2 of us were so disenchanted with the menu (and that they would not let us have a check for just us, we weren't going to eat 90% of the food that folks ordered) we decided to get 1 dish and some sticky rice. \\n\\nThe $13.50 we spent on what sounded so good on the menu, ended up being so bleh that I am not not so sure that if we come back to try more stuff as a couple it will be worth it. \\nIt was a tuna salad. It was called \\"albacore tuna\\". \\n\\nI am all prepared for some warm fish with lovely dressing full of veggies and tuna. \\n\\nWhat was it? Some chilled canned Albacore with a few tomatoes, some lime dressing with green onions and $10. Never. Again. \\n\\nI had a small bite of a friend's mushroom veggie dish. It was nice smoky flavored mushrooms. Spendy though. It was such a small portion for a lot of money. \\n\\nThe sweet rice was not very good. I like the sweet rice at Tom Yum on Woodstock better, well.. pretty much anywhere I have had it I have honestly liked it better. \\n\\nWas confused what made the water so great? We all thought the water tasted like water in a cup that once had rice in it. \\n\\nI HATE it when the bill comes in these chi chi places. I knew we had almost nothing, so yes.. it was appropriate to pay our small portion since we shared nothing else... but if I was part of that group that took over 10 min to figure out the bill... I would not be happy.  \\n\\nOne of the reasons I love having a potluck at home instead of going out to eat in big groups are dealing with the bill. \\n\\nMy wife and I might go back when we are feeling particularly wealthy or as an adventurous visit... maybe, one day. But since we do not eat meat, it will be limited.\\n\\nThe prawns were tempting to me as a veggie that eats sea food.  (Yes, I need to try more food here). \\n\\nA few people who had the highly coveted wings complained they were expensive for the amount of food. Also they complained about soda refills costing extra. \\n\\nI do not recommend coming as a big group unless everyone is open to eating all kinds of meaty dishes.  \\n\\nit's also too loud for me to hear people a ways down the table.

Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable (the entire staff from the moment we walked to the door and were greeted by the valet were all out-going and friendly). Our water glasses were never even close to empty and the crumbs from our bread were very neatly removed from our table between appetizers and main course. Our steaks were a whole different level of perfect!! Perfectly cooked, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Before desert I stepped out to look for ladies room, and another server walked me to the restroom, no pointing or giving directions, which would have been fine.

I could see myself walking in with jeans and t-shirt on a Saturday afternoon or in suit right after work.  The front half of ICOB is a bar area with a long bar on the right side and high top tables on the left.  As your eyes glaze down the bar, you can see a raw bar station about halfway down.  Right above the raw bar is cluster of lights.  This lighting element is encased in some mesh wire and is very reminiscent of a lobster trap. Behind the raw bar is a secondary or back bar.  The whole left side of the ICOB are giant windows covered with slatted shades composed of what looks like beach/drift wood.  It reminded me a lot of my summers on cape cod.  But enough about the view, How'd it taste?  Two words... WICKED AWESOME.\\n\\nMy buddy and I got there and started the meal off with a drink they call the Perennial (10$) It was composed of rain organic vodka, blended with fresh lemon and a touch of fennel. Then, we went with some oysters.  We sampled 3 different types -Hog Island (3$) from Tamales Bay, Ca; Kumamoto (3$) from Puget Sound, Wa; and then there were the Hama Hama (2.5$) from Lilliwaup, WA.  Damn these little suckers were delicious.  When it comes to oysters and the wide range of flavors, everyone has their own favorite.  These were all on the smaller side, and were less briny and were absolutely amazing.  After my Perennial disappeared, I decided to try the Evergreen (10$) composed of pear, bitter orange and late harvest stevia essence).  \\n\\nThen we tried the Oysters Gregory (12$) which were baked oysters covered with bacon & paprika crusted, charred leek, parmesan.  Holy cow these little suckers were amazing.  The bacon overpowered the oyster flavor but still, if you let me, I could probably eat 100 of these guys.  Next came out a Crispy Island Creek Oyster Slider served on a brioche with a lime and chili aioli (4$).  While it was delicious, I didn't get much oyster flavor in it.  Maybe they should tone down the breading (both the coating and the roll)?  We also tried the Tuna Tartare (13$) which was tossed in a ginger cream and came with chips and crispy roots to use for dipping.  They added just the right amount of ginger cream.  It was simple and flavorful, a wonderful dish. After really enjoying my first two cocktails, I decided to try another, this time I tried the High Pines (10$) and had flavors of juniper, elderflower and grapefruit.  YUM.\\n\\nIt was at this point in the meal were I was starting to develop a perma-grin.  You, know that smirk/ smile on your face that you just can't get rid of.  Maybe it was the cocktails, maybe it was the amazing food, maybe it was hanging with one of my best friends, to be honest it was probably a combination of all three.  However, I'm sure others at the bar were looking at me wondering.  What is this guy so happy about?\\n\\nTo round off our marathon dinner, we decided to snag a bottle of Southern Right Sauvigon Blanc from South Africa.  With flavors of oak, grapefruit and lemon, this wine definitely fits the profile of being crisp, clean, lean and mean.  I then proceeded to get a lobster roll (19$) which was so big I could barely get my mouth around it (that's what she said).   It was cold, very light on the mayo and celery and packed a big punch of refreshing flavor.  My buddy had the chowder (10$) which was creamy, light and had the most delicate clams in it and came with the most to die for biscuits.  He also got the baby Iceberg, Berkshire blue cheese and bacon salad (10$) which had the most potent blue cheese I've ever tasted.  This stuff was rich, but the big chunks of bacon balanced it out perfectly.\\n\\nWhat an amazing first meal at ICOB.  One other item to note, our bar tender Devon, knew his stuff about the oysters, the cocktails and was engaging yet let us progress the culinary adventure at our own pace.  He, the food, and the ambiance were all terrific and I will surely be back soon."},{"name":"Murphy's Twin Shamrocks","address":"425 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Murphy's is still great, and trivia is always fun.

The kitchen messed up my on-the-side brown sugar and put it on top of the oatmeal. It was not a huge amount, so it didn't affect the final taste. But if I wanted it on the top, I wouldn't have ordered it to be on the side, would I?

The panini was tasty although the bread is pretty oily like someone else mentioned. Not oily enough to make it soggy though. I actually liked their bakery potato chips. It's kettle chip style, a little salty and crunchy, but tasty. The eggs were good but nothing too special. The harvest bread that came with the eggs has a hint of sourdough taste and lots of nuts and sunflower seeds.\\n\\nThe 'bakery' in the name can be confusing. It's really just a cafe.

It's a little cheaper than the other places, but not by much. What I like about their menu is that they serve breakfast items all day, even oatmeals. I also like that they list calorie count for all items on the menu. I am interested in seeing how long this place would last. Today it was pretty busy at lunch time, probably because it's new and just sent out the coupons. :)"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This truly is the gem of Portland!

Took our food a bit to come out. Waitress brought out our dinner plates. I had to ask her to please take the appetizers plates. She kinda rolled her eyes. Then, my sister in law & I had ordered beef fajita nachos. They were cold & soggy. They we so soggy that we could roll them up like an enchiladas except they ripped. At first we were like, we'll just eat them because the waitress seems bothered & we don't like to complain. After the 2nd one, it was like no! This is crazy & nasty. My sister in law called our waitress & told her. She snatched both our plates, took them to the back. All of a sudden, man comes rushing out carrying the plates on his left forearm & hand with anger. He starts yelling at us. Picking up the soggy nachos with his fingers, yelling, \\"the cheese is melted!\\" \\"You already ate it!\\" His face was red. He continued with a few other words as if we just didn't want to pay for our food. And at this point we were all in shock. Things of course became outraged. All we wanted was crispy beef fajita nachos. Believe me...money is never an issue. \\"The angry man yelling at us, is the owner.\\" I could not believe it. \\nBut what we do know is, we will never step foot in this place again, nor will we recommend it.

I was inclined to leave a 4 star review, but my sister who paid the tab said she would only give it a 3 star.

To start, they give you a loaf of bread with butter and water served in plastic cups. There's only one menu hanging on the walls written in chalk. We got the Black ink pasta aglio olio (garlic and olive oil) and the fried calamari since they seemed like popular choices. The fried calamari was seriously disgusting. I barely tasted any squid because it was basically all batter. I didn't even want to finish the rest after eating a few of them. Adding lemon juice to them made them somewhat more edible. The pasta was slightly better. The squid ink added a nice texture to the pasta and I liked the minced squid in the sauce. Still wasn't anything amazing though. Skip this place.

Now you can find a number of bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants that are run by Italians and it has become one of Boston's top tourist spots to hit up.\\n\\nRight on Hanover Street, there's this small seafood place called The Daily Catch that serves up mean rustic Italian dishes with fresh seafood as the star of each dish. The Daily Catch is top notch for many of their menu items but their pi√®ce de r√©sistance is definitely their squid ink pasta. I tried the squid ink pasta aglio olio which meant it was tossed in simple garlic, oil and crushed squid. The squid ink gave the pasta a slightly briny flavour to it, lending the flavour of the salty sea. It went very well with the crushed squid that they put in the dish and something I can see complimenting seafood well in general.\\n\\nTo read the rest of the blog entry and to check out the photos, click here http://bit.ly/1km5ilq\\n\\nHappy Dining!"},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Our first night we had a group of six of us at Bistro du Midi.

The dishes that we ordered were; Lamb neck, pork belly, foie gras, salmon crudo, octopus, chitara, cod and bouillabaisse. The lamb, cod and bouillabaisse were salted to the extreme. This was especially true of the lamb and almost made it inedible. The bouillabaisse and chitara flavor were both derived from a very good lobster base. The chitara was cooked absolutely perfect and the pleasantly flavored lobster base saved the otherwise clunky dish and rubbery lobster pieces. The bouillabaisse was almost a complete disaster with the broth overly thick and salty. The two pork bellies were ok, but again, salted beyond acceptable. The salmon crudo was a nice contrast of rich and acidic flavor, but a little meager in size. The octopus suffered from portion size with the iberico have and aioli rounding out the dish.

When we finally did get seated, the waitress asked if we had been there before, but when 2/3 of our group said no, she did not give us an explanation which was expected.  Then, we ordered our pancake mix and toppings.  It's incredible that it takes 10 minutes to take some batter off the shelf and serve some chocolate chips.  Once our batter was finally delivered, the waitress never came by to see if we were fine or wanted anything else.

We thought we'd give it another try tonight thinking that our first bad experience was due to opening kinks. NOPE! Turns out it's terrible ALL the time. \\n\\nBEWARE of the bait and switch with the guacamole appetizer. You'll sit down and notice a nice bowl of avocados at your table-big, juicy, black. You'll be told they'll be crushed into guacamole at your table side. If you fall for this (both the hostess and the waiter will mention it) the waiter will whisk the 2-3 big juicy avocados away and return with 3 small green avocado HALVES=1.5 avocados total=not the two to three avocados that were in the bowl at your table- and make them into guacamole for you. The guac is  good but 1.5 small avocados do not make for a large amount of guac and they charge $10.00 for the appetizer. $10.00 for one and a half avocados. It's ridiculous and I totally resented being fooled by what was on our table as compared to what we were given. \\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered a chicken salad. Last time we were in we had fajitas and a burrito which were not good. The chicken salad was $12. Described as having bacon, avocado and chicken on it. It had 1/8 of an avocado slice on top, half a chicken breast that tasted very frozen, and an amount of bacon so small I didn't really find it. Pretty terrible.\\n\\nThe service was equally bad. It creeps me out because like other reviewers here I found it not rude, but nervous, flummoxed. You wonder what they do to their staff every night to make them scared to death. Our server had no personality AT ALL. After he took our order, a food runner brought our food, no one ever came to refill our water or chips, and our server just walked by the table, dropped the bill and never said a word. Didn't check on us to see if our meal was OK or ask us if we wanted coffee or dessert. He just laid the cheque sleeve down and left. Bad, really really bad. Our interaction with the food runner (whom we asked for water after our waiter had flaked on it, but she did too) was the last interaction we had with any of the staff. For 50.00 for salad and guac, you could expect a little more attentiveness or at least a refill on the water. Come on. \\n\\nAnd if you're going to spend a million bucks on putting a restaraunt in 29th Street, spend a few more dollars on the outdoor umbrellas that tilt so they actually protect your customers from the sun.

Our experience was totally a disaster. I strongly recommend tourists/residents choosing any other restaurants here (there're a lot of good Italian restaurant in little Italy area) in case it ruined your trip.\\n\\nWe got there at 7pm on a Saturday night after a one-day trip in Boston. There were around 20 people waiting outside. After standing for 1h, all of my friends got really tired and we just wanna sit down and have a rest so I went into the restaurant and asked the waiter/host if he could give a plastic bag and we could sit on the ground. I knew the idea sound stupid but we're really exhausted... He looked at me with a shocked face and asked 'Who do you think I am? Who do you think you are?' I was like 'eh...'. He then said 'I can only serve you when you sit down'. Okay, fair... I'm just asking stupid questions I guess.\\n\\nTherefore we kept waiting for another 0.5 h and got in the restaurant. I wish I left when he treated me like that but I didn't cuz we've waited for 1h and there're so many good reviews about it...\\n\\nThe restaurant is really tiny, which I already knew from other reviews. However, the dinner environment is really bad. We had 3 people and we had to share table with another 3 strangers (later it became 5 people...) There's only one waiter and he's also the host. I don't think he's able to serve 20 people at the same time as he kept forgetting things. He didn't provide water for us for a looooong time until we asked. He's like 'oh, we don't offer water. Hahaha, I'm just joking!' This kind of joke for people who have waited such a long time like us was really annoying.\\n\\nFinally, we came to the food part. I should say this's the worst pasta I've had (minus the one I cooked...) plus the bad attitude from the host. We order fried calamari as appetizer and shared a squid ink pasta and a white sauce shrimp linguine. Actually the fried calamari was okay. It was just tasteless but we added salt and pepper by ourself so it's still eatable. \\n\\nThe pasta were all too hard to eat plus the black pasta had no flavor at all. We then asked the waiter/host about it. I told him it's quite hard but he didn't believe us. I said it's different from what we ate before. Actually what I meant was that one of my friends had been here before and she ordered exactly the SAME food as we did this time so she knew what it was last time. But I guess my face just looked like I've never been here before so the host told us 'This is what we called al dente. It's different from what you ate before but it's how Italian pasta is cooked'. Who doesn't know al dente?! I have the common sense to distinguish al dente from the really hard pasta that needs more cook and also this is not the only Italian restaurant I've been to before. Fine, the host then took the food back to kitchen and added some water into them and boiled them for a few minutes. He didn't even ask the chef but did this by himself...\\n\\nThough the pasta after re-cooked was still not good, we decided not to bother the Mafia boss looking waiter (we had a lot of pasta left as they were really hard to bite...). We came in the restaurant, finished the food and paid in 0.5 h cuz we knew a lot of people were waiting outside. Also we ate fast but not a lot though we were really hungry. After we paid, one of my friend went to the restroom. While we were waiting for her, I swear it's only within 3 min after we paid, the host came to us and asked 'Could you guys leave? I need this table!'. We explained we were waiting for a friend who went to the restroom. He then said you could wait outside so we stood outside of the restaurant to wait our friend... This is the first time I got request from the restaurant like that. I knew there were a lot of people waiting and that's why we tried to be quick but I don't think this is the right attitude for a restaurant.\\n\\nOverall, I think eating in this restaurant is like gambling. The chef is really overwhelmed. I wouldn't say my experience represent the food in this restaurant but it's possible that the chef couldn't pay enough attention to your food and it tastes 'not that good' then. I just wanna share my experience and hope people could think twice before they go there.

We came here with friends on a Friday night and were told there were no reservations until 10:30pm but that we could take our chances with a walk-in.  We got there around 6:15 and were seated around 7:45 which is much better than 10:30.  While waiting we snagged some seats at the bar and had exceptional service from the bar staff.  Too bad we can't say the same about the servers.  After enjoying a few drinks and some oysters at the bar we were seated upon which we waited over 15 minutes before a server came over.  When she did, we asked her for menus to which her reply was \\"I would've thought you brought them from the bar\\".  Excuse me?  Yuck.  It then took another 10 minutes for a different server to come over.  I asked him if he was our server and his reply was less than professional.  Finally after 25 minutes total we ordered drinks and food. My friend got her glass of wine in 2 minutes while my husband waited 14 minutes!!! (we timed it on our phone for fun) for a beer.  A beer!! Finally, it was our friendly bartender who noticed our wistful or angry looks toward the non-existent servers that brought the beer. At this point I made a comment like \\"next time we'll stay at the bar, your service was excellent, I can't say the same for the floor\\".  From that point forward our service did get better as my friend noticed the bartender say something to the hostess, but it was too little too late.  \\n\\nOverall, food was excellent (tuna tartar, trout, oysters, fried clams, apple cider donuts!!), ambiance was cool, bar service top notch and knowledgeable, floor service fail.  To their credit, it did seem as though they were short staffed on servers (plenty of bussers, managers, etc) but that is no excuse for snarky unprofessional attitudes, 15 minute waits for menus/drinks, and general absenteeism.

Not even the lightest pink. I never really like grits. The grits here though were so tasty. I think its due to the fact that they had a thicker texture than grits normally do.\\n\\nMy sister ordered the country fried steak with chipotle gravy and youkon garlic mashed potatoes. It was amazeballs. Id say the best garlic mash potatoes I've had. And I know my mash potatoes! The breading for the steak was pretty ordinary buttermilk, the chipotle gravy was really the star of the show though!\\n\\nMy best friend had the barnyard chicken sandwich, basic grilled chicken with a little bbq sandwich to me.

Having spent a bunch of years in NY, my wife and I had certain expectations of Vietnamese cuisine. This place missed the mark. \\n\\nBefore we get to the food, let's talk about the service and ambience. It was pretty nice inside, candle-lit, and clean. Staff were friendly and attentive but tried really hard to get us to order more food. We got there around 8pm on a Friday night and it was pretty full (but no wait). \\n\\nSince they are fusion, a few things they DIDN'T have. We hunted for the pho, but couldn't find it. Figured they didn't serve pho for dinner. Also was looking for some classics, like a lemongrass grilled pork chop (xuong nuong) or sweet and sour bass (ca chien), but they didn't have these on menu either. Bummer. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering the creamy coconut soup to start, bo luc lac (cubed steak, classic vietnamese), and French indochine tuna. (in retrospect, why did I get this?) \\n\\nCreamy Coconut Soup: a bit watery, not creamy. Had a spicy kick, but that was about it. The mushrooms tasted like they just threw them in from the supermarket and felt a bit undercooked. I've had much better at Simply Thai and Rasa Sayang. 2/5.\\n\\nBo Luc Lac: One of my usual favorites at Vietnamese restaurants, this one was a minor success. the meat was decently cooked and flavored alright. The sauce was a bit heavy and salty, but I assume that was to balance out the steamed broccoli and string beans, which had no seasoning. 3/5.\\n\\nFrench Indochine Tuna: I was really looking forward to getting bass, so when I couldn't find it on the menu, I went for the next closest thing - big mistake. The tuna was awkwardly cooked, a little too far beyond seared, so it tasted funny... The cuts of tuna also had some stringiness and toughness. The asparagus was undercooked and again had no seasoning, but I presume I was supposed to balance it out with the overpowering marinade. It was served on some noodles, which was ok. I would have preferred rice. 1/5. \\n\\nI might try it one more time, but I don't have a lot of hope. I figure I have to give their pho and bun xao (pad thai) a shot.\\n\\nFinal words.

With butter is not the way the kitchen normally makes it, so I really would not hold that against them. Best fish and chips I have ever had. The fish was so moist and juicy. The fries were tasty, of a size large enough to taste potato in every bite, and not burnt. I also got the biscuit. It sat in honey and was flakey.

It's not my fault. As a transplant from Portland, OR, aka coffee paradise, where on one mile-long stretch of Alberta Street there are at least 12 independently and locally owned coffee shops each offering a different locally roasted brand of beans, I kid you not. As you can imagine, it's next to impossible not to have extremely high standards. With notable exceptions being Halcyon, Little City, Progress and Caffe Medici, I have been less than impressed with some of the coffee poured around Austin. I mean, c'mon, I have yet to find an Ethiopian Sidamo in this town. Ugh! More often than not, the coffee beans are all burnt to hell or they're just yet another version of a nasty dark French roast or Latin American varietal with no nuance. Not so here at Thunderbird, where I have yet to experience a boring cup of coffee. Y'all pull a fine Americano, the fact that you French press your house coffee means you avoid the nasty dishwater drab of drip coffee. Yay! Oh, and the iced coffees are the bomb! One of the first times I came in, someone on staff was kind enough to offer me a free cold water extract. Well gosh, if that's not good customer service, I don't know what is! \\n\\nAs far as the ambience, I feel as though I've found a home away from home. I almost always enjoy the rad music playing, I dig the fact that there are ample outlets for plugging in to do some work on the ol' craptop, and if I need to stay my hunger, the menu abounds with sammiches, brekkie tacos till they run out, and they even offer a peanut butter option for my bagel, huzzah!

The most enjoyable place to watch a game is upstairs where there is a large room with a projector tv, less crowded bar, and lounge chairs facing the screen. Other parts of the bar are more club-like and have loud dance music. The bar ample inside and outside areas, which is always something I appreciate.

This menu is uber expansive and it's a little overwhelming if I'm being perfectly honest.  My husband and I came here once just the two of us, then again most recently with his parents.  Both times, I had the beef lo mein, which is dynamite, and he had the orange chicken.  My father-in-law had the bbq pork and my mother-in-law had the garlic chicken.  We also had a plate of wontons to share (which ended up being just two shrimp and a ton of pork).\\n\\nEverything we ate was delicious, and four meals and a plate of wontons with two iced teas, two waters, and a glass of wine was about $55 before tip so not too shabby.  That even left some food to take home for later.\\n\\nBut here's the thing.  They get SUPER busy.  You walk in, sign in at the clipboard on the table (make sure you write legibly), and wait for them to call your name in the tiny space available for waiting.  When it was finally our turn to sit down, we had to wait ages for a waitress.  Then when the waitress came, my mother-in-law ordered her garlic chicken by the letter/number combination on the menu.  \\"I don't know what that is,\\" the waitress said.  Not sure why you have it listed that way on the menu then, but ok...  Then each plate came out slowly...one...by...one...  And we ended up with a plate from someone else's table.  And we were not interested in eating family style.  So this was awkward for us, watching one person eat while everyone else sipped at their drinks and chatted.  Then the endless wait for someone to bring a check so we could ask for a to go box.  They're just reallllly busy.  But that lets you know you've gone to a deliciously tasty place.  And I recommend you check it out on some weeknight at a weird dining time.  :)\\n\\n(And not that you'll ever read this, but to the guy with the party of 5 who was mad that other people with fewer in their party were seated before you and that \\"no one notified [you] that it would be this way,\\" have you never been to a restaurant before?

The trick is to get there before the sale starts, gather your items, and be first in line at the sale hour. I was in and out in under 45 min where others could wait an hour or so just in the cashier line. \\n\\nBook sales are another godsend when you find your place overun with books (and a good way to save up for the appreciation sale) Each store in the Portland area has their own buyers (Burnside, Hawthorne, Cascade Station) so if you have the ability take your books to each one to get the most of your collection before gifting the last away."},{"name":"Tapenade Bistro","address":"3711 Bayview Street","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Went there with a Groupon so good deal for what we are getting.

My reasoning for a 1 star goes for the customer service we had the last 2 times we visited. It is just this one guy that we have had the issue with. I found his name through another employee and was told his name is \\"Mi\\" pronounced as \\"Me\\" \\n\\nWhen running a business I believe the product/service goes alongside good customer service. I took my parents there yesterday who were visiting from out of town. As a server, it is his duty to explain what an item on the menu is especially when it's not American food. I asked him and he was very frustrated for some reason and was huffing and puffing. I asked him another question and he did the same. I did not voice my displeasure due to other customers there. He then came and started taking away the soup bowls by stacking them on top of each other so loud. We were ready to walk out of there with our party of 9 who were visiting from out of town. We asked him for a to go box a couple times and he pretended he did not hear. He was conciously avoiding our table. Then our 4 year old asked him politely \\"excuse me, can i have a box?\\" and he yells \\"OKAY!! I will get you a box\\".He never came back to our table to refill water or ask if we needed anything else - which brings me to my next issue.. \\n\\nMy other issue with this place is that the waiters take their own tip whether its a party of 4 (they took the tip with just 4 ppl) or 8. They scribble it on the bill that we have to take to the cashier upfront. And when they do write their numbers, they make it look like its the tax or something with the numbers jumbled out. Why would you even take tip when your service sucks so bad? I thought the customers did.\\n\\nBottom line, the tip will be taken regardless - so your service sucks. I was very disappointed especially because I brought new customers. So if the manager wants to contact me, you can respond back and I will give you more details.. I don't think I will be coming back to this place anytime soon."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pok Pok came highly recommended by pretty much anyone I know who has visited Portland. That much hype almost always leads to disappointment. I had the special, which the server warned me would be spicy. It was, but it was also very flavorful. Nothing dull about the food. The Hunny (grapefruit, lime, som honey, tequila served up) definitely hit the spot-- it was heavy on both the citrus and tequila.\\n\\nWhen I first arrived, the host asked me if I would prefer sitting on their heated enclosed patio or wait for a table in the bar. Even though it was pouring rain, I decided to give the patio a shot. Unfortunately they hadn't actually turned the heaters on (so it's a good thing I ordered the spiciest thing in the world to warm myself up). \\n\\nThe server was generally unhelpful and a little rude. I let him know I had never been in and did he have any specials or recommendations. He pointed to a dry erase board behind him and walked away.

I have never had anything but good service, excellent food, and a great experience.\\n\\nI have had just about everything on the menu and feel it has all been very good. \\n\\nI love the Khao Man Som Tam, the Kung Op Wun Sen, the Kung Pao, the Kai Yang, and the of course, the wings. The wings are among the best dishes I have ever had. \\n\\nThe Kao Soi Kai is very good, though I would say that Madam Mam's in Austin and Opart Thai in Chicago have much better renditions of this dish.\\n\\nI have read reviews that say some dishes are too hot, but I have never been there and not had the server warn me that the Papaya Pok Pok is very hot (plus, it says the same thing on the menu) and ask if I want it adjusted. \\n\\nThe cocktails and drinking vinegars are excellent. The Hunny, The Southside, The King and I, and the Pok Pok Bloody are all highly recommended. The bartenders at Pok Pok make consistently good drinks, whether they are with booze or not. The rotating tap is always something interesting, I think I have been there when they had Line-Dry Rye from Oakshire; a Fresh-Hop from Deschutes; amongst other good seasonal selections.\\n\\nBasically, I think Pok Pok just does a great job of making sure they deliver high quality results and interesting/thoughtful dishes and drinks. Not many places can say the same.\\n\\nI have always had consistently great service. Never even had anything approaching average service. There seems to be some people on here harping on \\"hipster\\" kids who ignore them based on how they are dressed or if they are not \\"hip\\" enough and I can't say that I have ever had that experience...having gone to Pok Pok in everything from a business suit to shorts and a t-shirt...with friends with a 1 year old and with people who had never even eaten Thai food...the servers were always friendly and helpful. \\n\\nFinally, I think Pok Pok does a great job of managing their demand. They have Whisky Soda right across the street and have made sure that it provides all the same high-quality service, drinks, and apps. If you wants wings and a cocktail, you can head there and not worry about waiting for hours.\\n\\nKeep it up, Pok Pok!"},{"name":"Finale","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"I really like this place!!!\\n\\nIt was my friend and my first time here last night, and we had a great time!

Luce Enoteca isn't there yet, but is under consideration and worthy of a second visit.  \\n\\nThere was plenty to like.  The chairs are padded and super-comfy.  Our server, James, was excellent, as was the stuffed meatball appetizer that he recommended.  There was a solid wine list, too.  In all, the food was good...but not so good that I wanted to jump out of my chair and start break dancing (that's how I show my appreciation).\\n\\nPart of the problem may be that the restaurant has an identity crisis.  I should have picked up on this when Luce boasted \\"casual fine dining,\\" which means everyone is either overdressed or underdressed.  Half of the restaurant is a lively bar area that combines several tables (with dinner seating), a fireplace, TVs tuned to football, and a semi-live musician that played sax or clarinet over top of canned jazz and soft rock.  It's almost sensory overload...especially when the sax player leaves his post and starts playing tableside.  The menu is just as confusing - do we order entrees or do we share small plates?  I don't mind options, but I find it hard to define what \\"vibe\\" this place is going for.  I don't know how to finish this sentence: \\"Be sure to hit Luce Enoteca for the...\\"\\n\\nLuce seems to be popular with a slightly more mature crowd.  Not coincidentally, the food was a bit on the bland, under-seasoned side.  Almost every dish (even the aforementioned meatball) was made better with a dash of salt and pepper.  A cheese sampler had not one, but two (out of four) types of bleu cheese, which was disappointingly stinky.  I love almost all cheese, but bleu is kinda gross.  Dessert was pretty tasty, though.\\n\\nI'm going to give Luce another shot.  I'm kinda focusing on the negatives in this review, but I wasn't disappointed.  Just not as enthused as I wanted to be.  The service should probably bump this up to a solid 3-1/2 stars.

I am Chinese, grew up in NY, lived in SF for a long time, and am a Chinese food snob.\\n\\nDin Ho is pretty good Chinese food (especially for Austin).  They have some of the best char sui I've had- it's lean, fresh, and delicious.  Having sampled a lot of their menu I would definitely say their barbecue and variety of noodle dishes is their strength.  Seafood can be good (have had it where it's questionably fresh- especially their fish) and their menu is extensive although definitely not as creative as some of our favorite Chinese restaurants in NY.\\n\\nWe've never had a problem with the service at Din Ho and find it above average with many other similar type Chinese restaurants we have been to.  Like everything though, reviews are mostly compared with one's past experiences... Try telling your 'waiter' at a Chinese restaurant in Brooklyn that their food is cold and you'll be quickly talking to the curb.  Overall though, service is efficient and we've even seen a few employees smile.\\n\\nWe haven't found a better Chinese restauant in Austin (and we've been seriously trying)... for us, Din Ho is just fine for some good, authentic Chinese food."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Literally so good!

(It was probably wise of them to seat us downstairs as we got a little rowdy as the night progressed.) Our server, Terri, was exceptional. She took care of us with efficiency and ease, and even won us over with a little humor.\\n\\nI ordered a salmon tartare appetizer, a 12oz. filet -- medium -- and the silver queen grits as a side. The salmon tartare had excellent flavor without being fishy. My steak was about 1.5 inches thick and cooked to perfection: warm pink center and seared well. Each bite melted in my mouth. And I had enough to bring home and made a nice lunch of it today. The only disappointment for me was the grits. They were not as good as the other sides my friends ordered that I sampled. Of those, the mac-n-cheese was the best, followed by the sweet potato and gruyere. Also, the baked escargot app was tasty as was the roasted beet salad with goat cheese. The Asian meatballs were tender and served in a sauce that had a hint of ginger that was not too spicy. Cocktails were well-mixed and not weak. I did not order wine or dessert. Maybe next time.

I'm nowhere near vegetarian, but the tofu is really good and you should try it. They don't use the pasteurized/processed cheese like most Tex-Mex spots, so you're getting a much more fresh, less greasy product.

The server, who never introduced herself, was less than pleasant and just not good overall for multiple reasons. Overall, good drinks, nice atmosphere, below average service, overpriced average food.

Service was alright- the waitress was good nothing special. Whoever puts the spoons in the cup on the table should check the spoons, some of them had crusted food on there.

You could get ceviche that's 100 times better on Orange Ave, at a little Peruvian place. We ordered the Tortilla de Espana- this was awful, I've been to Spain, I know I'm not going to be able to repeat that experience but c'mon...this was so bad. There as a hard spot on it, like when you put something in the microwave for too long. We had mushrooms with goat cheese, said it was served with bread, but the bread was underneath all the cream and goat cheese and was so soggy. We had a few other dishes- all forgettable. We tried a pitcher of Sangria- I've made better at home. It was not not good at all.\\nI wouldn't go back.

It took forever to flag someone down to take our order, and it didn't come out quick. When all the food did eventually come out, there was even more disappointment.

After grabbing a quick bite at Clyde Common, I entered Powell's ready for my quest at 9:23pm.\\n\\nI was able to find exactly the collection I wanted in a 1978 almost pristine hardcover print from The Franklin Library. The bookstore is color coordinated and well labeled. I found the book at 9:28pm. Quest over. The end. *sigh*\\n\\nA little dumbfounded by how easily my mission had been accomplished, I continued to look at other poetry books. \\"It's Not You, It's Me: The Poetry of Breakup\\" screamed out to me with it's simple cover and cliche statement of disinterest on the cover. I found a step tool in the next aisle to read it in. \\n\\nWhile reading poetry written about divorces and cheaters, I paused drew a breath and looked up. I found myself in the Greek Mythology section. Quick flashbacks of me sleeping through Classics 128 lectures in college just to try to run into the guy was crushing on as we would leave the lecture hall. But also how I had adored reading about Homer, Odysseus, Medea, and Antigone. Much of what was written so long ago resonate so well with modern times. \\n\\nClutching my T.S.

I put down the other book and wandered deeper into Powell's.\\n\\nUp and down the stairs it's like a maze, I wandered into the architecture and interior design sections because I enjoy those topics. Unfortunately the web has made it so much easier to digest those topics, relegating these books to things you keep on your coffee table for show. \\n\\nThen I ended up in the young adult section and discovered Nancy Drew again.

Definitely a cool location and the restaurant is a modern dressed up steakhouse with what looks like a mega million dollar investment in  it's design and improvements.\\n\\nService was excellent and our table of four ordered enough food to feed half of India. Started with the Waygu Short Rib appetizer which was an off the chart 15 out of 10! But I ordered the Spinalis cut steak which was a special for the evening and described as the boneless cap of the ribeye with the tenderness of a filet. I never had this cut as a standalone but the description made my mouth water. Upon receipt and in hindsight it reminded me of the famous and way overrated Tampa steakhouse Berns which separates the outer edge of the rib eye from the portion and of which I have never enjoyed. Normally I'm more of a bone in filet or tomahawk rib type of guy and found this relatively newer type cut to have the interior consistency or at least this one of a skirt steak which I can't stand. So 2.5 for this. Had very good sides including their Jalape√±o creamed corn, elbow mac and cheese and just a so so twice baked potato which I would give just an ok 2.5 rating. There were desserts which I did not indulge in and lots of wine and spirits. We did hit a $1000+ for the evening.\\n\\nWould I go again? Hard to say and I am more swayed to say no as opposed to yes.

The bartender seemed like she legitimately hated her life and job and was disgusted by the idea of being bothered by customers...she actually refused to serve a guy sitting next to me a specific single malt scotch because it was inside...mind you, there is a window on the patio bar leading to the main inside bar. After 10 years in the service industry I couldn't believe that this response to a customer was even an option! Though there were only about 6 people at the bar top, she acted much too busy to be bothered by us--so, once we received our drinks, we drank them quickly and left.

They have three different types of BBQ sauces---a white sauce that is they call the Alabama sauce, which is vinegar based.  They also have a sweet BBQ sauce that is the favorite--the was also my favorite.  It is more traditional.  They also have a more spicy one that I did not try.  The girlfriend was dying to have me try the corn on the cob, which was absolutely spectacular.  She is a big fan of it and I was also.  The pulled pork was moist and delicious.  All of the food was hot and the waitress was very attentive.  The atmosphere is very casual--more a jeans and t-shirt kind of place.

I was impressed with the menu's selection and low prices, but I came strictly for pizza.  Asked the guy behind the counter how long a small cheese would take and he said, looking at the two of us, \\"why don't you get a large?\\"  He had a perfect point, and delivered it so nicely we took him up on it and ordered a large half sausage half sausage and mushroom (I steer clear of the fungi kingdom).  My friend grabbed a Pepsi and pointed out the limited drink selection--just Pepsi products, and no fountain drinks.  The place was cleaner than I expected, and the framed artwork wasn't dusty, greasy or ancient like most small Italian eateries.  Also, by the door, two plaques announced 2006 awards by Zagat and Citysearch.  Impressive.\\n\\nOur pizza was ready in about 8 minutes and so hot I'm sure I have permanent burns.  The sausage was in slices, like shaved steak, instead of the round variety and very tasty, but they could have been a bit more generous with it.  The crust was crispy, which is essential for me, and the fresh homemade sauce was outstanding.  My friend really liked it too but mentioned that something was missing.  My guess is that, since it is so fresh, it might contain less sodium.\\n\\nSo, this large great pizza and one Pepsi only set us back $12.88--a great deal in my book.  I observed other people's portions, and they looked huge, especially the pasta dishes and salad plates.  I will definitely come back here again even though, when I threw away some trash, I noticed a mouse scurry across the floor.  This has never bothered me.

The chef really knows his SE Asian flavors. I was skeptical at first because it wasn't an Asian person chef and I was afraid that it was going to be a American style Asian food. I was sooo wrong. The reason I wanted to try this restaurant because I saw in the review in the Portland Monthly magazine which stated that the chef/owner does travel to different parts of SE Asia to learn authentic Asian food. This restaurant doesn't have the typical Asian food such as Pad Thai or Pho. His menu is filled with really authentic Asian food that you don't get to experience with other Asian restaurants. I love their Papaya salad. I wasn't a big fan of Papaya salad until I tried Papaya Pok Pok. I always recommend the Kai Yaang which is roasted natural hen. It's soo good and it's not dried. I also recommend the coconut rice over jasmine rice because you get jasmine rice at any Asian restaurant but not coconut rice.The food is in small portion and kind of pricey too. I do recommend that you do order just one quantity for each item in the menu. Even though the food portion is small but by the time you finish all the items (at least 5 items for a couple), you'll be full. The reason I recommended to do this is because the menu does changes so you don't get to have the same food available at all times and it's worth trying at least once how authentic Asian food taste like. The one downside of this restaurant is that it's too small. I've been to their dining area before outside and inside but not in the lounge section before. The restaurant does have a sitting area outside that has some heaters. I love eating outside because it gives me a feeling as though I was in Asia;the way the outside sitting arrangment is exactly the way it's like in Korea or China. Not only their food is unique but they also have a wide range of creative drinks. I love the sugarcane drink. I totally recommend this restaurant.

My wife, who is Japanese, said that this was the best intepretation of the dish that she had ever had. \\n\\nWe tried some of the yakitori skewers. They were tender and the sauce used to coat the chicken was superb. We followed that up with an order of the okonomiyaki (grilled cabbage pancake) which made me feel like I was back in Japan. \\n\\nWe also tried the 5 piece sushi set which was pretty respectable. Usually, in Japan, people do not go to izakayas just to eat sushi. The sushi is just another aspect of the meal. \\n\\nFinally, we finished with the miso tonkotsu ramen. The noodles are hand made everyday and you can really taste the difference. Although this is definitely not the best ramen I have ever had, it is easily the best ramen I have tasted in the Portland metro area. \\n\\nThe only slight disappointment to the meal was the dessert. We ordered the macha mousse cake. The cake was dry and the color was an unappetizing pale green. I appreciate that they have their own pastry chef but for me that dish was a bit of a letdown. \\n\\nBottom line: if you want to try REAL Japanese food go to Shigezo and don't be scared to stray from the sushi menu."},{"name":"110 Grill","address":"170 Forbes Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"This new place is great!\\n\\nClose by but let's get into the details:\\nAtmosphere is professional and family friendly!

Based on the first visit, I would have given this place a ZERO, or maybe just half a star. \\n\\nMy friends and I came here, after we made a reservation for 7pm. When we got there, we were told some of the dishes were no longer available because they were out. Disappointing, on a Friday night. we asked for a different item and they told us they had one left so we wanted that. We told the waiter to put that order in first so that we are at least ensured we have it. He said that shouldn't be a problem since there weren't many folks in the restaurant so we proceeded to order 2 apps and 3 more entrees and would decide on dessert after. He left to put the other in and in a couple of minutes he returned and informed us the Duck was no longer available. At this point, we didn't want to stay anymore. It wouldn't have made sense since most of their items weren't able, at least the 2 top choices for us weren't. So we told him to cancel the order and we would come back when they are fully stocked. He appeared upset and made some body gestures. \\n\\nWell that was the first time, but we have since returned a couple of weeks later. \\n\\nTheir menu has changed and a few of the things we would have liked to order was no longer on the menu so we tried something new. \\n\\nThe waitress made a couple of recommendations and for the most part was good. the service was also nice because she was friendly and quick to get back to us and refilled drinks and removed soiled dishes. \\n\\nThe food without question was definitely good but the portion size to the cost was not very economical and it wouldn't be something I'd eat on a regular basis and not feel full after. \\n\\nThe desserts were probably the highlight of the meal with the exception of the nutella crepe. The layer inside was extremely thinly smeared on the crepe. We were very disappointed how little nutella there was. \\n\\nI would probably give at least a 3 star if it was based on the last review. i posted some pics in case you're interested in seeing what we ordered."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Overrated. Good food but too expensive. Waiter was rude when we asked about the dishes, as if we were asking a stupid question when in reality the menu can be very daunting to a newbie. The portions were small as well, for $15 the entrees were far too small and not filling. On the bright side, we had plenty of room for Salt and Straw after our less-than-filling meal. \\n\\nBottom line: good food, small portions, poor service, expensive, but good atmosphere. Deng's Thai Food on 43 a much better choice in my opinion. Probably won't go back."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Why haven't you been here yet????\\n\\nTo be honest, I wasn't too sure about this establishment.  New restaurants have to deal with the battle of impressing the hard to please and capture intrigue at first glance of skeptics everywhere.  I consider myself fairly hard to please.  There aren't many places where I want to return to immediately.  And given that Creek Oyster took over the enormous space that was Great Bay, which I knew as being extraordinarily over-priced and snobby; I wasn't about to give ICOB (turns out using the acronym is easier) a hall pass.  Plus, it's name is Island Creek Oyster Bar.  I associate oyster bars with small crowded spaces like Neptune and B&G.  All delicious, but small for a reason... their feature: those unfathomably complex bivalves.  Right?  This place had to win my heart from the start.\\n\\nAnd so... yah, I'm married now, but it turns out that love at first sight can happen.  And, good god, yes; it can happen TWICE.  It's a Sunday night and Kenmore Square, not the most happening place in town, is quiet, yes.  The oversized glass door entrance can be intimidating, but at ICOB it's softened with wood handles that give the impression of driftwood/ ancient row boat oars.  In fact, when you open the door, the driftwood gleys and caspian blues and misty cool ocean openness aura continues throughout the space.  Needless to say, I dig it.  Realy dig it.  The visual speaks for itself and the open space allows sound to disappear (ha ha! ideal for my quiet-speaking/semi-deaf parents) with enough space between the tables to be comfortable.\\n\\nFOOD FLAVOR\\nBut really, you all are probably wondering about the food.  Well, let me just say that I wish I could try every item on the menu, which in itself was a progressively unique arrangement of a menu, including items like crispy cod cheeks, seafood casserole, lobster roe noodles, the burger ..  All of these items, for an employed (but by no means rolling in money) 27-year old, were within my price comfort zone ($16-27).\\n\\nAfter pondering for what seemed like hours, I order the $24 pan-roasted trout with brussel leaves and madeira mushroom.  This was fantabulous and simple but delicious and I got to enjoy every inch of it and every drop of the sauce (thanks to homemade sourdough).  I won clean plate club, people.  I really did.  Of the night.  Dave's fish and chips with malt vinegar aioli and Bonna's oyster stew + crispy cod salad ... were both executed very well.  I had room to try all of theirs and despite not being overstuffed I was perfectly satisfied.\\n\\nAnd... have already decided to come back with my parents for the lobster roe noodles next week...  And of course, not to worry, we started with the oysters, mainly $2 ea and served with a mignonette and cocktail.  The variety included: Dodge Cove of Muscongous Bay, ME, Island Creek, of course, Wellfleets, and UGH I can't remember the fourth we tried... local and enormous.\\n\\nOur wine of choice was a 1 L $33 German varietal of the halbtrocken flavor ... sweet, half dry, complex ... talk about bang for your buck.\\n\\nOh man, and to finish off the night, our lovely friend, Bonna, ordered a Chemex drip coffee ($5), which was soooo delicious, dark, smooth, hint of volcanic smoke.  And, I, part of the reason I am writing such a long review, enjoyed a Macallan 12y (the youngest cheapest choice).\\n\\nCheers, ICOB.

Both veal dishes had a good assortment of vegetables which were wonderful. Each of us raved about our selections. My Cioppino's broth was outstanding in flavour and had a good variety of seafood. Absolutely delicious! The bread was phenomenal, along with it's red pepper aioli  - baked fresh, so we ordered a second batch. Portions were generous, therefore we did not have room for desert.

The first was during the soft opening.  I sat at the bar with friends and enjoyed a few appetizers and drinks.  I had the mini tacos, quesadilla and the prickly pear margarita. I also sampled the churros. The food was okay, the margaritas were good (definitely worth it at happy hour) but I've tried better churros. I could order the quesadilla again but I'd pass on the tacos. The staff was friendly and the Chef welcomed my friends' feedback on a few dishes. \\n\\nOn the next visit,  I had a larger group of friends meet me for happy hour.  They happily accommodated our large group.  I also learned that the original Chef was no longer with them. This time I tried the smoked wings & avocado ranch with a side of grilled asparagus, juevos diablos and prickly pear margaritas.  It all turned out well. Services seemed a little slow but overall I think it went well.  To my knowledge all of our orders and bills were correct. I think everyone enjoyed their food and drinks.  Our servers checked on us often. It was a fun time. \\n\\nOn a next visit,  I met a friend for brunch.  I was undecided on the Steak and Eggs, Breakfast burrito and beef enchilada.  Our server recommended that I go for the Steak and Eggs which comes with Mexican hash browns so I did. Our hash browns came out extremely burned and dry.  Unedible. A total dissapointment.\\nThe bottomless mimosas, however, were good and worth the $10.\\n\\nOverall, I love the decor,  location and drinks at F&D Cantina. They amount to about a 4.

This is compulsory. Going to Island Creek without sampling the oysters would be akin to going to New York Fashion Week and missing the Marc Jacobs show. Make no mistake: they may be petite in size, they may be the first to arrive at the table, and they probably won't fill you up, but the oysters here are the main event. Island Creek Oyster Bar features an extensive assortment of oysters, including East Coast favorites and their West Coast cousins. Every single one of Island Creek Oyster Bar's employees must spend a day at the Duxbury oyster farm, learning about the ins and outs of modern aquaculture. As a result, the serving staff will speak knowledgeably on the subject, and are expertly trained in describing the differences between geographical and genetic varieties. For advanced oyster connoisseurs, they will suggest specific kinds to pair, so as to better highlight contrasting or complementary traits.\\n\\nOn a recent visit, a dozen freshly shucked oysters (six types, in twos) arrived at the table to start. Massive Moonstone Oysters from Point Judith Pond, RI, paired exquisitely with slightly smaller Misty Point Oysters from Pope's Bay, VA - the former plump and juicy, the latter a paper-thin sliver. Both displayed an intense brininess (but not overpoweringly so), that gave way to a clean, light salt on the aftertaste. Brilliant Kumamoto Oysters from Puget Sound, WA, fat and buttery, were paired with larger Hama Hama Oysters from Lillywaup, WA. Kumamoto Oysters are some of my favorite of all, and these did not disappoint. They were simply extraordinary, tasting of melons with a faint metallic undertone. Each tiny shotgun shell of love lay seductively in its iridescent shell, just begging to slide down my throat. I complied willingly. Blue Pool Oysters, also of Lillywaup, were creamy and complex, as were the absolutely outstanding Shigoku Oysters of Bay Center, WA. As is typical of West Coast oysters, these last two selections were delightfully multifaceted. I tasted cucumber, citrus, a hint of copper and a distinctly algal smoke. Merroir, a term used by oyster aficionados in the manner an oenophile uses terroir (but with \\"mer\\": French for \\"sea\\"), has never been more apparent to me. It underlines the importance of the water profile in which an oyster was cultivated; the salinity, the mineral composition, the current, the temperature - it is this which defines the oyster's taste. Though vastly different in texture and flavor, all of them boasted fantastic finishes, and a lovely, crisp bite. Spoonfuls of mignonette used? Zero. The taste of an oyster is something so subtle, so sensual, so absolutely primal, that I did not--I could not--want to alter the experience. None of them tasted of sand or silt, a problem I have had in the past when ordering at lesser restaurants. I sipped on a flute of champagne in between shots of mollusk, bubbly offsetting the briny. My eyes were closed, my mind drifting away into a sensory overload of the dreamiest kind.\\n\\nAfter a round of such spectacular bivalve heaven, it is easy to forget that Island Creek Oyster Bar is more than just that. Get a starter plate of Smoked Trout - orangey-pink and flakey, on a bed of superb walnut pesto. Pile the fish and the decadent, gravelly pesto on a slice of toasted rye; the combination of flavors is at once stunning. Sour and herbaceous notes from the bread, a monster truck of nutty oiliness from the pesto, and a marvelous smokiness from the fish. It is a hodgepodge of strange contrasts that somehow fits together beautifully. \\n\\nAs for entrees, try the Seared New Bedford Scallops. They are enormous, plump, tender and juicy. Seared to a brown crisp on the outside, snowy white and pure as a virgin on the inside. Sweet potato puree lends a sugary kick to each forkful, and (in keeping with the bivalve theme), crunchy oyster mushrooms provide textural interplay. A fantastic dish. A mere four scallops may seem insignificant, but fear not, these beasts are massive - little brown-and-white rock sculptures on the plate, rivers of puree settling in the canyons between. For fans of more traditional New England style seafood, Island Creek devotes a section of their menu to the breaded and fried. Try a Fried Fish Sandwich - Island Creek's version is very good. The meat is exceptionally sweet and flaky, the batter is ethereal and light, and the slaw is fresh, cool and crunchy. Old Bay French Fries take the experience up a notch. Tangy and crispy, and served in a tin can lined with discarded print. Like the majority of the preppy crowd, this rendition would not have been out of place in an All-American clam shack in Cape Cod. It tastes of a sunny day at the seaside. A happy-go-lucky slice of summer."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Wow.

Although, there was a good number of various Asian faces, which is a good sign, but I'm not sure if that is due to close proximity to Berklee.\\n\\nI went for the Dac Viet or combo beef, which should have come with flank, tripe, soft tendon, and what seemed to be brisket.  When the order came it smelled good and there was a nice beef slick from the fatty pieces of meat.  Unfortunately, my tripe was missing, a thing that I only noticed when I cleaned out enough noodles.  I really appreciated the freshness of the sprouts and basil.  Over all a decent bowl of Pho.  It was nothing like home or when I go out to the west coast, but what can you do.  \\n\\nThe service is great!  They were attentive and refiled my coke when I was half way through it.  The is place isn't that huge, and I had to wait for a bit.  The staff was nice, and let me know how long it would be until they could seat me.  They did some table rearrangements to accommodate me, but groups that are larger than four might have a longer wait for table to clear out.  \\n\\nI will go there again to try the Pho Ga so I can discern if that is a better choice.  Also, I would like to try some of the other menu items and then I will ratify my review accordingly."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I live in the North End and this is by far my favorite restaurant.

Still, once our server came, she was very lovely and attentive and the food was delicious! We ordered a few different kinds of oysters (our waitress was very knowledgeable and got us exactly what we were looking for) and my husband ordered their famous lobster roe noodles which he thought were just ok, and I got the striped bass special which was probably the best fish dish I have had in Boston.

Overall, the place is nice, albeit a little overpriced, less intimate than expected but great music (golden oldies), trendy, but it was a positive experience overall. Would I go back here?

Hmm, I think I could figure that out myself.  After putting our order in, I overhear another server telling his table what the specials are.  Our server didn't mention any specials...until we asked but by then it was too late anyway.  The chopped salad was just ok.  Next we had the artisan cheese plate.  It was delicious.  We had to request our server tell us what the cheeses were.  She was able to name the cheeses.  When I asked, is this the manchego?  She said I guess.  Really?  I guess?  Why not ask a senior person for the answer.  I ordered the lamb lollipops which were good, a more generous portion than the server implied.  My husband had the chicken saltimbocca.  Also good except the meat around the bone was a little pink.  If I'm going to spend money at  a restaurant, I expect knowledgeable and well trained staff.

I loved the wings though. Usually hot wings aren't nearly spicy enough for me but here they have a very nice kick.

Their sandwiches are stuffed with pretty much whatever you want, with choices ranging from Italian meats and cheeses to Mediterranean style food like Chicken Souvlaki and Falafel.\\n\\nAlthough this is fast food, it seems to be on the healthier side.  I also appreciate the care that goes into their product.  For example, when I ordered my food, the gentleman who made my food washed his hands at a little sink that they have behind the counter, and put on a fresh pair of gloves.  In most other restaurants I've been to, they either don't change their gloves very often, or they don't use gloves at all.  So needless to say, this means to a lot to me.\\n\\nIf you're a vegetarian, you'll appreciate the fact that they cook their vegetarian dishes on the opposite side of the grill from where they cook their meat dishes.  Another nice touch is that they cook their vegetables in water instead of oil.  Extreme Pita also shows an interest in the environment by having a separate recycling bin just for bottles and cans.  It's little details like these that separate companies that truly care about the world we live in, and the health of their customers from those who only pay lip service, or don't make any effort at all.\\n\\nExtreme Pita is a clean, sanitary dining establishment where you can go to get delicious, healthy sandwiches for less than $8, served up by a friendly staff.

Before this week I was saying that Rathbun Steak could be the best steak in the country, but, unfortunately, after spending the first part of the week in LA which included a meal at Cut Steakhouse, it cannot be, but I still feel that it is the best steakhouse in Atlanta. \\n\\nEvery time I have been I always do a four course meal including appetizer, salad, steak with sides and dessert. Every time I go I am never disappointed with anything. One thing that one must get if it is available is the five spiced seared foie gras - as our server George (who I would highly recommend requesting) put it - it is absolutely divine. No argument here. But the real reason to go to Rathbun Steak is the steak itself. I have tried everything on the left side of the menu as far as meats go and I have to say that the way to go is the dry aged for three (if party size calls for it), dry aged cowboy ribeye or the NY Strip. This week was the 22 oz. Cowboy Ribeye which did not disappoint. Perfect temperature, tenderness, crust and fat content. A beautiful piece of meat of which I savored every last bite. Couple that perfectly cooked steak with some of Rathbun's inventive side dishes and you have a fabulous meal. If one had to critique anything at this restaurant it would be size of the sides - they barely have two servings. If you remember that and order properly, you will have no problems at all. \\n\\nYes, Atlanta has Bones, Chops, McKendricks, BLT Steak, etc. and they are all good. But, for me, Rathbun is just doing something so right starting with the space (dark and unassuming with a nouveau industrial feel) and ending with perfectly presented and delectable food. The most important thing of all, he is doing it consistently.

Our party was almost 10 people and it did take a little while or us to sit but we didn't have reservations. The staff was honest with us and said it was because the kitchen was behind and not that they didn't have open seats.\\n\\nWe were seated and greeted with flavored popcorn and friendly server. I didn't try the popcorn but it went quickly from everyone else at the table. The server was prompt with our drinks and taking out order which was great.\\n\\nThe food was a little delayed but not surprising considering the kitchen was behind. But wow... the food really made it worth the wait. The Chicken sandwich I ordered was incredible. Bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. Instead of fries I ordered green beans and they were also superbly cooked and flavored.. hard to not eat them all at once. We also enjoyed the jalape√±o cornbread that came out with the meal. Even the crazy big desserts were amazing!\\n\\nOverall - blown away top to bottom for my first meal in Austin. Absolutely recommended this spot for any meal.

This is just an informational review...When you enter the space you are in the market.  There is a refrigerated/freezer section along the wall in front of you and a few tables with produce and dry goods/spices.  There is house made ice creams in the freezer.  Next to them there is also bags of dried pasta, pasta sauce with or without meatballs and beverages.  There is a small cut out in the wall next to host stand that displays fresh herbs and veggies.  On the tables you will find local produce and also a display of house made jams.  As you make your way to the counter there is a small fridge with a good variety of cheeses.  Above the counter, the menu options until 4 pm are lunch sandwiches and salads.  Beginning at four they offer a special each day of the week - tonight was braised beef ribs, soft polenta and roasted potatoes.  The main courses for each night start at $16, I believe.  Depending upon the day, your option might be tacos, roast chicken, meatloaf, etc...\\nWhen I arrived I had missed the lunch options and the dining room doesn't open up until 5 so my only option for food was the braised beef ribs/polenta/potatoes.  There are about 6 different sandwiches - bahn mi, veggie option - cambridgian, etc...  There was only one other person in the market when I was there, but it seems strange to stop the sandwich making and only have 1 option for something to eat other than a cookie or a muffin.  Maybe they don't have the staff to cover it, but since it was dead it shouldn't be too difficult to make sandwiches up until when the dining room opens, just sayin'.  \\nI don't live in the area, but the prices are pricey.  For a pint of ice cream it is $8.  Sandwiches are all $9.  I didn't see them, but I hope that for that price they aren't small.  The jams they are selling a about $6 for a few ounces.  I know the area has a lot of money with all the hi-tech, internet and medical companies, and the high per capita residents.  Some of the items are too expensive to be justified.\\nLooking at the dinner menu, the sides which are served family style to accomodate 2-3 people are $9, and the entrees are individual portions range from $20-$26.  These prices are competitive and fair.\\nIf I was in the area I would check in to see what was on the daily market menu for dinner - but only if I was feeling lazy and indulging.  It is spacious and I imagine when the season permits it will be filled with more produce.  I think that with the self-serve refrigeration they could also offer ready made refrigerated meals, too.  The nice thing about markets is that not only the raw ingredients but the ready to eat items, adn ones that aren't sweets.\\nI did purchase a chocolate chip cookie and they had an apple pop tart/toaster strudel item.  The cookie was big and had lots of chocolate, very crispy - especially the egdes.  Not sure if there is just butter or oil, too, but definitely a rich cookie that is big enough to share.  I had the apple pastry the next day.  It is basically a hand held pie.  It had a drizzle of glaze on top, a chunky apple filling and a thick pie crust.  When I bit into it you could see the flaky crust, was on thick side and that gave it a density; but, it was filled with a good amount of apple filling to keep it from becoming dry - it was a good ratio of filling:crust."},{"name":"Tommy's Jerky Outlet","address":"3461 Broadway","city":"Grove City","stars":"3.5","text":"Went on Facebook blaming their customers for having to let go of their employees and for their impending closure. \\nMaybe if they spent more time advertising and promoting their business, they'd be going strong.

Considering our office is across the street and next door, we're always popping in when in town. \\n\\nI am a huge fan of the seafood chowder and the chocolate lava cake (and have been for 6 years now). Whenever I visit I always have to get the chowder at a minimum. \\n\\nThe seafood chowder is cream based with a roux, so it's really thick and rich in the mouth. The scallops, shrimp and clam pieces are never chewy, just nicely cooked. The potatoes are also properly soft and melt when pressed against the roof of your mouth. Toss in a couple oyster crackers and you're set. This, a couple of rolls and maybe a salad and you could be full.  \\n\\nOne Bistro did the chocolate lava cake dessert before it became a trendy dessert option a few years ago. Theirs is always super rich, but how cooked the cake portion is depends on who makes it. I have had it entirely lava with just a crust of cake and then other times entirely cake with a tiny, jiggly center. The vanilla ice cream it's served with it always good. \\n\\nThe seafood tower appetizer is really filling. I have ordered just that for dinner in the past. Raw items have been fresh and simply presented. \\n\\nPizzas are good, espeically if you don't want to dent the wallet. They are large and very tasty. The wood oven cooking is a nice touch. \\n\\nThe specials board usually has some creative entrees, but other times it's a standard menu item with mixed up sides or toppings.  \\n\\nThe bar is extensive and the bartenders have always been friendly."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love that you can get a drink across the street while waiting (other restaurants - take note!!).

Come prepared to eat with you hands - I recommend for a dinner out with close friends!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My first experience with the Pok Pok franchise was when Pok Pok Wings first opened down the block from me.  I have to admit that I did not understand the hype and was not a big fan of the wings.  That is partially why when they opened up their restaurant in Brooklyn, I never bothered to trek out there to try the place.  However, it is always on the back of my mind to try it and I have friends who always rave about the place.  So, when we were trying to figure out what to eat for lunch in Portland, I naturally thought of this place.  What better way to try it than it go to the original one, the one where it all started (at least that is what I think, I never bothered to research it).\\n\\nWe got here for lunch on a Saturday and the wait was about 30-40 minutes, which is not terrible, as I had expected it to be longer.  They use a nifty app that tells you how many tables are ahead of you, which is pretty cool and all restaurants should use it.  Anyway, we finally got seated in what appeared to be the tiny foyer of a house, it was a tight fit, but who cares, I finally get to try the \\"world famous\\" Pok Pok.  We decided to try three dishes:\\n\\nKhanom Jiin Sao Naam - a vermicelli dish that is sweet, sour and slightly spicy.  It really surprised me, in a good way.  The dish contains bits of pineapple, mango and ginger, all of which you can clearly taste.  It is topped with a coconut cream dressing.  Make sure you mix all of the ingredients well so that you have a balanced taste.  This dish goes extremely well with spicy dishes, as the sweet and sour taste, along with the creaminess of coconut helped to tempered down the spiciness of other dishes, which brings me to...\\n\\nMuu Paa Kham Waan - the boar collar meat dish that everyone raves about.  It is good, but sooooo spicy!  Be prepared!  My mouth was on fire, then subsequently numb after two pieces.  The dish comes with mustard greens to help mitigate the heat, but I don't think it helped.  The aforementioned noodle however, was super helpful.  \\n\\nDeep Fried Whole Fish - it was the special of the day and my least favorite dish.  It was presented beautifully, but was super bland.  The two accompanied dips were not helpful in punching up the flavor of the dish.  I wish they marinated the fish in some type of sauce before deep frying it, or at least season it with some salt and pepper.  Skip it, not worth the 20-something dollars for this dish.\\n\\nThe server was extremely helpful, and warned us about the sweetness of the noodle dish.  But I am glad we ordered the dish in spite of the warning.  Tip to Pok Pok, maybe you guys should recommend the noodle dish when guests are ordering super spicy dishes, like the boar collar, as the two dishes are extremely complementary of each other.  Lastly, I really like the Thai Ice Tea with lime juice drink, as Thai ice tea is generally served with condensed or evaporated milk, the lime juice was super refreshing.  Also the drinks were bottled in soda containers, it was super cute.  I liked the place so much that I actually went to the Pok Pok in NY when I got home.  Stay tuned for my review on the NY one (spoiler alert, it was not good)..."},{"name":"Basta Pasta Trattoria","address":"319 Western Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"These brothers are great.

The food took a while to come out but the servers were awesome considering all the chaos. People were out of their seats mingling most of the night but the servers still managed to stay attentive and keep the drinks flowing. I had the seared Rainbow Trout with bacon cornbread stuffing and chile sage butter. The fish was slightly overcooked but still very delicious. I also got the green chile cheddar grits as a side dish. I was very happy with both choices. Really my only complaint was they only serve bottled beer. I just feel a nice cold craft draft beer would've really hit the spot with the comfort style food. The ribs also seemed to be a big hit with everyone as well with it's Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce.\\n\\nEvery time we drove by this place in Austin it was packed with a line out of the door.

They literally gave us a SINGLE sausage and a small handful of veggies on the side, and it cost $16.

The spiciness drowned out some of the flavor and made for a subpar dish. \\n-  Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings are tasty and rich, but only good if you love your wings absolutely smothered in sauce, which I do. \\n- Kaeng Hang Leh (pork belly and pork shoulder) was beautifully flavored with soft and tender meat. However, the portion size was frustratingly small (2 small pieces of each meat). \\n\\nThe servers were down to earth and nice enough (especially to deal with our large party of 14), and the food arrived quickly, but they didn't seem to care very much about giving us the correct food items. We had to ask multiple times for the correct entrees and additional rice. When we asked if we could split the bill according to certain groups of 2-3, our main server just said straight-up: \\"No.\\" When we read the menu later on, it stated that we could split the bill into 3 cards with $1 extra for each additional card. Since we're all friends, we eventually figured out the bill by ourselves and just paid each other instead.

Boasting a stunning exterior and interior design I was immediately drawn in. I went on a sunday night with my mom and it was absolutely packed however, the noise level was not too bad. The service was excellent and I was seated at a table quickly. The most important piece of advice that I have is to get oysters - of course!. There are over a dozen types of oysters. I got four types of oysters and my favorites are listed here in the order of preference: Island Creek, Moon, Chatham and Chilmark. All the oysters are very fresh and if they did not cost three dollars each, I would eat over a hundred. The main courses were equally impressive. I was able to taste the sea bass and the seafood casserole. The sea bass was cooked and filleted perfectly. The casserole was in a delicious heavy cream lobster bisque type sauce that combined perfectly with the fresh lobster, scallops, haddock and many other types of seafood. Every single piece of fish in the casserole was cooked to perfection. I was quite full at this point but peeking at tables surrounding me, dessert looked too good to pass up. I ordered the Banoffee Pie with dulce de leche and banana. Wow! What a way to top off the meal. This place is expensive and the bill can rack up fast if you chow down too many oysters.

I wasn't a fan, but they have all your classic favorites from California rolls to nigiri to volcano/spider/dragon/unicorn rolls loaded with cream cheese, avocado, salmon, tuna, etc.  \\n\\nThere is a hibachi station next to the sushi roll station that has a lot of delicious soups such as udon and crab soup. The hibachi was good but nothing to rave about.\\n \\nOn the other side of the sashimi station is the salad/kimchi area. Next to this station is the fried and other cooked foods section. Items range from dumplings, calamari rings, chicken teriyaki, Korean-style ribs, crab cake, and list goes on and on. I would say half these items were good while half were lackluster. \\n\\nTo top it all off, there is a strong choice of desserts ranging including fruits, cookies, cake, green tea ice cream, which I would definitely recommend trying, and fruit crepes. \\n\\nYou're not going to find a lot of buffets like Nori Nori, and I plan on going back many more times."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Ewe!!!

Pasta were excellent, with creamy cheese mixing well with the rich carbonara sauce of the still-good-when-burped-up-hours-later caliber. Dish also came with chicken bites, which seemed odd and inferior in comparison to the rest of the dish. And that's coming from a meat lover.\\n\\nA further epiphany was that of the dessert menu, much of which can be ordered at the window to go. Using my Yelp check-in coupon, walked out with an enormous apple turnover which ran only $2. Spectacular.\\n\\nReturned the next week for eclairs, whoopie pies, and more turnovers. Eclair was okay - essentially a cannoli in loaf form - but the whoopie pie was a revelation. Did they lemonize the cream???\\n\\nLunch crowd was mostly geriatric.

I'd also never seen a closed poppyseed kolache--which isn't bad, per se, just not what I pictured.  This is just further confirmation of my theory that you have to go out into the country to get a decent kolache--or, using the Homesick Texan's recipe, your own kitchen.\\n\\nThe good: the folks manning the counters were very nice and kept everyone moving quickly through the line.  Even though it was 10am when I stopped by, they weren't out of anything, and if I lived in the area or wasn't going to spend all day in a car, I would have bought their day-old kolaches which are reduced in price.\\n\\nIf you're puttering around the Hill Country, I would recommend Hruska's, Weikel's, or even The Little Bakery in Columbus over Kolache Creations.

Also because my boyfriend had been talking about it non-stop, almost felt like he was overhyping it. Like how good could this asian fusion restaurant be?! But let me to clear it now... expectations were met!! \\n\\nWe visited Pok Pok during the around prime time, 7:30/8pm on a Wednesday. We figured out the bus system and took a bus that lead us to the front door. We saw a line forming outside already and you won't miss it, as it seemed like the only loud establishment on the block! We left our name down with the hostess and were told that the wait was going to be around 45 minutes - 1 hour. Not too shabby. We headed over to their sister bar across the corner for a drink. \\n\\nWe ordered enough food to have leftovers for lunch the next day! The menu is a bit overwhelming because there were sooooo many words. It was quite busy and it took a while for someone to give us their attention. But here's our two cents on what we ordered:\\n1. Vietnamese Wings (9/10) Amazing wings to add to my best wings list, but it was slightly too salty but bearable.\\n2. Papaya Salad (10/10) Dankkkkkkkk salad. Can we possibly say a balanced diet needs papaya salad? But be prepared to sweat like a mf-er. It's so spicy!!\\n3. Laap Muu Khua Phrae (8/10) I've had laap before and am a huge fan. Such a simple dish yet so freaking enjoyable and addicting. But felt like it was lacking something... couldn't tell what though. \\n4. Mango Alexander (Drink) This cocktail is almost like a dessert! It'll help kill the spice a bit...\\n5. Coconut Ice Cream Bun (6/10) Was it good? Sure. Was it great? Meh. The bun was lacking and was very dry. May need to rework the recipe if it's made in house. There's a surprise in here: sticky rice stuffed in between the bun and ice cream!! This was my favorite part.\\n\\nOverall, food did not disappoint a bit. There's both inside and outside seating (we sat outside). Seating is a bit tight, where you're kinda almost listening in on everyone else' conversation. Staff were all helpful and attentive, but almost felt like they were understaffed. Whenever we needed something, it took us a while to flag a waiter down.

How majestic does that sound?! How can you not order something like that when you see it on the menu? French toast with scrambled eggs and ham and bacon and pepper jack cheese, as a sandwich, with homefries. Order up, indeed. \\n\\nIt was a breakfast fit for a man the size of a truck. Truck men everywhere agree, the Breakfast Montecristo is where it's at. \\n\\nI am not the size of a truck. I am the size of a modest 2-door sedan. Therefore I could not be what the sandwich truly needed me to be. But that sandwich treated me good. \\n\\nI had initial reservations due to the potential stickiness and questionable structural integrity of french toast as a sandwich bread, but those worries were soon put to a soft, cinnamony rest as I sank my teeth (jaw unhinged like a python) into the first bite. Fingers came away clean. The sandwich held fast, still resembling a sandwich despite the fact I was unable to bite through the ham on the first (or any) bite and had to remove it from the sandwich to eat on its own. Truck men may or may not have the same issue here. \\n\\nI needed to go deeper though. Could I add an additional sauce and still honor the essential spirit of the sandwich? I put it to the test with french toast's BFF, syrup. With all the concentration of a bomb diffuser I drizzled syrup artfully under the french toast of one half of the sandwich. A bite. Another bite. Momentary out of body experience. Sandwich intact. Achievement unlocked. \\n\\nBut what about egg's favorite mistress, hot sauce? One half of my sandwich still untouched, I continued my experiment. Hot sauce was liberally daubed over the cheese of the other (unsyruped) half. I took a bite. No gustas were had. You put up a good fight, hot sauce, but syrup is the clear winner in this battle of the condiments. \\n\\nThe homefries are the round, chubbier cousins of the potato chip, imparting a delicious rosemary-influenced salt-and-peppery goodness with every soft-but-crunchy bite. These were seriously so good. Maybe top 10 homefries awards. Definitely top 10. \\n\\nAlso it may have been the Montecristo goggles, but the apple juice was uncommonly good."},{"name":"Soto South Lamar","address":"1100 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 2115","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Extraordinary.

It's great on it's own, but one of my favorite preparations is the pork green burrito.  My absolute favorite though may be their carnitas enchiladas.  Perfectly prepared carnitas, crispy on the outside and melts in your mouth.  Served with fresh pico de gallo and guacamole, it's absolutely delicious.  If you like fajitas, theirs always come out sizzling and are the tastiest in town.  If you are looking for something more off the beaten path, some of the real gems are owner Ernesto Alvarez's recipes from back home in Jalisco - try the Shrimp Jalisco or the Lamb en su Hugo for a authentic Mexican feast.  Last but not least, their huge selection of tequilas can be expertly blended to your specifications.  Their bartender Ron is as good at mixing a perfect margarita as they come, and will make you something that you won't forget.  In the summer you can sit back and sip a frosty one on the patio with a Flatirons view.  In summary, there are plenty of mediocre Mexican and Tex-Mex places in Boulder to choose from.

Don't let the 11pm hour fool you - the place was still incredibly packed and hopping. When we made our impromptu reservation earlier in the day, 11pm was also the earliest time available! At this time, even on a Saturday night, there was plenty of street parking available right in front of Island Creek, right on Comm Ave.\\n\\nOnce we walked in, we were seated very quickly and our server was very friendly. She said that while they did switch over to their late night menu at 11pm, she would be able to offer us the full menu for a while longer, since we came in right on the cusp of things.\\n\\nAfter weighing over a few menu options and discussing with the waitress, I opted to have just the clam chowder (Hand dug clams, buttermilk biscuits, house-cured bacon), at least at first. My girlfriend went with the Lobster Roe Noodles (Braised short rib, grilled lobster, oyster mushrooms, pecorino).\\n\\nThe Lobster Roe Noodles, in short, were amazing. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the short ribs, lobster, oyster mushrooms and pecorino all complemented each other very nicely. This dish is a party for your taste buds and definitely worth ordering.\\n\\nMoving on to the clam chowder, I don't know if there's a certain kind of chowder that defines New England, but I've definitely grown accustomed to the heartier kinds of chowder, like what's served over at Union Oyster House (don't kill me for mentioning their name). Anyways, what's served at Island Creek is definitely on the lighter side. The bacon and biscuits are included in the chowder and there also aren't as many clams as one would like.\\n\\nSomething else that was a bit of a detractor was our server. She was very friendly, but being that she was doing her best to keep the full menu available as late as possible, she was asking us a bit too often if there was anything else we'd like to order. It almost got to the point of pressuring us to order more - maybe she's not used to people eating late at night and eating as little as we did. I really do appreciate how she was advocating for her restaurant, but in the end, it was a bit much.\\n\\nFor dessert, we tried the Meyer Lemon Curd sorbet, which while refreshing, needed more lemon and curd.\\n\\nI don't doubt the raw bar here is excellent and Island Creek is undoubtedly popular, as shown by the packed house at 11pm. The Lobster Roe Noodles were excellent and if not for the so-so chowder and somewhat overbearing waitress, I'd definitely give this place four stars."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Quaint little restaurant with a really clever idea (vegan Japanese food).

My seltzer was also adorn with a dried lime. We ordered pan con tomate which was a bad version a bruschetta. The bread was supposed to be toasted but tasted more like stale bread. Up next... Another bad tapa! \\"Piquillos relleno\\" that came burned and not worth it either. We saw some one with the paella and it looked good and because we seem to be gluttons for punishment we order it. Let's just say the amount of oil at the bottom was good enough to fry and egg on it and some parts were cooked some were crunchy! Jesus Christ! And here we go again and decide to order desert....

Obviously, this was a matter for our solicitors to discuss, a matter perhaps only for a magistrate to resolve.\\n\\nChapter 2: A Duel With A Tiny Green Unfortunate\\n\\nThus, in a voice I thought loud enough for the Small Neon Green Unfortunate to hear, I said, \\"Kind sir of ma'am, would you be so kind as to forward me the contact information of your family solicitor, that we may resolve the issue of blueberry ownership forthwith?\\"\\n\\nThe only response was slightly wiggling, which, as it occurred in public and in front of my family,  I deemed a most grievous insult to my dignity. \\n\\n\\"Sir or ma'am,\\" I stated, \\"you have insulted my dignity and I demand satisfaction.  My 13 year old niece, who witnessed the insult to my honor with be my second.  Choose your second now, and your weapon of choice.  Though I would be satisfied using traditional weapons such as swords or flintlocks, I suggest that you choose a weapon as best suits your stature and morphological traits.\\"\\n\\nSo saying, his/her/ or its response was silence.  Finally, I deigned the entire situation beneath me, and called our waitress to the table, whereupon a terrible accident ensued.\\n\\nChapter 3: The large-Diameter Man Leg, And What Happened To It, And Why\\n\\nAs the waitress, a spare, petite lass with a barbell-pierced septum courteously responded to my summons, she mistakenly ascertained that her presence was required in order to fill my coffee cup, and not to remove the Tiny Green Unfortunate from my breakfast repast.  Thus it was that my large-diameter man leg, which was protruding precipitously from beneath our table, came to catch a small torrent of coffee as it spilled from a carafe, poured from a high-altitude into a waiting cup and onto a waiting leg, due to the inability of the small waitress to approach aforementioned cup closely due to the awkward presence of the aforenoted man leg.\\n\\nMy gentleman's pride forced me to bite my tongue to spare the feelings of the stressed and barbell-clad lass rather than draw attention to it.  When asked what to do with the Tiny Unfortunate populating our blueberry, she took him away and replaced the blueberry with another of equal or greater value.\\n\\nChapter 4:  The Repast\\n\\nAt this time, we commenced to pour batter into various shapes on a griddle.  A smiley face with hair was generated, along with a yin and yang symbol, and the name of one of our party which, unfortunately, appeared to resemble the lower portion of the human alimentary tract when viewed from upsidedown.  Sadly, the low temperature of the griddle caused a substantial wait in order to cook the pancakes, and the content of the batter was insipid.  A grits and egg dish, though delectable, seemed rather over-priced.  \\n\\nThough the shine of the experienced was tarnished by a singed man leg and the debacle with our tiny friend, our waitress performed most admirably under what may be termed, adverse conditions.\\n\\nChapter 5: Conclusion of the Repast and the Resolution of All Misunderstandings With Aforenoted Tiny Green Unfortunate     \\n\\nLater on that morning, a note arrived by post to our table.  It read thus:\\n\\n                      Kind Sir,\\n                              forgive my lack of manners.

THE GARLIC BUTTER. It's worth contemplating ordering a meal over because this bread n' butter is satisfying and filling once you keep on saying, \\"okay, just one more slice!\\".\\n\\nEach entree comes with soup or salad and this salad is certainly something Moretti's is known for! It comes with romaine, tomatoes, green beans, noodles, balsamic vinaigrette and gorgonzola cheese if you want to spend $2 more. For some strange reason, the most recent time I went, all of the 12 girls I sat with commented on how salty the salad was. We still ate it up but probably a bad batch of dressing unless they spiked the sodium content in the recipe.\\n\\nI would recommend skipping the entree portions of the menu and looking at the appetizers. You'll find spaghetti, fettuccine alfredo and other pasta dishes for a few bucks less and maybe 5 bites shy of the regular dinner size (aka copious amounts food!). I'm confused on how a large plate of spaghetti could be shared by all before another large plate of your own but I'm not complaining! The tomato sauce has a little kick to it so if you're anti-spicy, I would pass.\\n\\nThe seating is relatively limited, the walk to the bathroom is 'I hope someone doesn't back out of their seat at the bar because I will get pinned again the wall' and the service for a busy Saturday night was nothing to rave about.

Not only is the food delicious, but the portion sizes are also the perfect amount.\\n\\nI'm sure many of you have gone to this plaza looking to dine at Ramen Tatsu-Ya, and often finding yourselves discouraged by the long line. Instead I highly recommend going to Din Ho around the corner. \\n\\nI absolutely love their Walnut Shrimp. Their homemade mayo and honey marinated walnuts are made perfectly, not to mention their shrimp is cooked and tastes wonderful (some restaurants serve shrimp that tastes very shrimpy...if you know what I mean). If shrimp is not for you, I would also suggest the Fried Salt and Pepper Fish. Although the fish isn't crispy, the battered fish is still full of flavor.  \\n\\nMy favorite pork dishes are the BBQ Pork and the Chinese Style Pork Chop. Just to be clear, the BBQ Pork is the pork that's displayed in the front entrance, your typical sweet marinated pork slices. The Chinese Style Pork Chop is pork cooked in a savory sweet and sour sauce. Usually Chinese restaurants serve the pork chop with the bones, but Din Ho leaves the bones out, which I think is considerate of them and why I particularly love this dish.\\n\\nIf you like Cantonese style crispy noodles, then the Combination Pan Fried Noodle is a good choice. It's the crispy noodles with BBQ pork, beef, shrimp, and vegetables. Quickly dive into this dish though because the noodles will get soggy from the sauce (although I personally like it soggy since it's more flavorful). \\n\\nThe service can be very slow sometimes, so you might need to take the initiative to get the attention of a waiter to place an order or to refill the rice. With that said I suggest getting an appetizer like the Fried Golden Bean Curd (Fried Tofu) or the Minced Beef with Egg Swirl Soup.\\n\\nWhat I love most about Din Ho is that the restaurant is great for groups, and the price is extremely reasonable for the portion size you get.

When you walk in you may not know exactly what to do so ...I will give you my step by step along with what I think about the food on this review. \\nWhen you walk in you will see a salad bar...First grab a tray...usually its on the side of the wall ...you are going to need this. If you are anything like me...you might stop by the handsanitizer station which they provide near the trays... :) \\nFor me as I put my tray on the salad bar I grab two plates....I do this because I want a sample salad plate as well as my main salad that I know I am going to enjoy plate. At the first part of the salad bar you have premade salads which sometimes change but for the most part you will have a ceasar salad and two others. I particularly enjoy the ceaser and the strawberry salad....Both of these go on my \\"sample salad plate\\" or you can call it the \\"taste plate\\" because I want to \\"taste these particular ones :). Once you get past the pre made salads you start what you may call your normal salad bar. You can pick your lettuce or you can have all three or four that they have available...whatever you want you can have. it...from romain to spring to iceburg lettuce....knock yourself out. Next you will begin your toppings. They have everything. I mean everything...egg, carrots, onions, olives, cheese, brocolli, peppers, pickled beets, regular beets, zuchini, cucumber...the list goes on an on.....once you get towards the end they have a good amount of salad dressings...I am a fan of the creamy garlic myself...I choose this because its the only place I can get it and I can get ranch and/or balsamic from anywhere. Keep in mind you have a \\"sample/taster plate\\" that you can use for other premade salads that are further on the bar which range from brocolli and raisin, and tuna salad. I am giving you this step by step because most sweet tomatoes are set up the same. It was a time I was at this place weekly...smh...dont judge me. :) at the end you can grab a fork...dont forget the napkins just in case there arent any at your table. If you want a drink from the drink station...this is not included in the salad bar....js. However, their strawberry lemonade is \\"awesome\\"...\\nAfter you pay and get your drink ....go ahead and put your tray down at a table....its cool no one is going to bother it ...at least I hope....well that just what I do. I then go up and look at all the soups, breads, pastas and potatoes..(carb heaven). My favorite is the potatoe leek soup; however, they change the soups all the time. They like to keep you guessing. :) My favorite bread is the multi-grain wheat and I usually get the honey spread but for some reason this time....uhh they didnt have any ....this kind of ruined it for me....i know, i know...IM SIMPLE.

I'm a stranger to Portland, so when I went to Pok Pok and the neighborhood it is located in, it reminded me of a suburb version of Williamsburg. The restaurant is charming, and cozy. The waiting list can be long but you can wait to be called at the joint down the block (which name I forgot) and they will let you know when the table is ready.\\n\\nThe food was delicious although I'm quite an ignorant to what stands for traditional or authentic Thai, yet Asian food wise, in the food they served I saw no signs of Westernization. We ordered the famous fish sauce wings that everyone spoke about, the minced duck, boar collar, the ribs and kung op wun sen. These dishes were awesome and tasty, I wouldn't hesitate to go back to have them again and explore the rest of the menu.\\n\\nHowever. Well, here goes my whining.\\n\\nI don't dig the holly attitude our waitress had with the food. The way she described the food she brought made it sounds like she was presenting an Amazonian tribe member that has never been introduced to civilization. She was also telling us how to eat our food... without asking us first if we were familiar. I was not upset, just felt it was slightly condescending. \\n\\nI couldn't help but to arch my brows when she brought the greens on the ice to the table to calm the spiciness because according to her those are traditional ways in Thai cuisine to cool things down. I have had those greens since I was little and I never knew they could do that. That's very interesting. \\n\\nAnother thing worth mentioning about is the pricing. For what you are getting, the price tag is actually quite steep if you did a cost analysis. But then, before you start throwing stones at me, I understand the story where a guy got billed with an insane price by an engineer to fixing his machinery just by tightening up a single screw. When the guy demanded for the reason behind such an absurd amount, the engineer simply said that it was because he knew which screw to work on, the bill wasn't based on the action itself.\\n\\nI think Pok Pok in the end is definitely a bookmark and you should visit and give it a try.

While occasionally offering a little bit slow of service and being on the pricier side, there's very little to critique at this place whether for brunch, dinner, or a drink at their bar. It's the most reliable seafood restaurant for a nice meal that's actually accessible (uy the waits at Neptune!) despite some difficulties booking during peak times (they're on OpenTable and booking for Friday/Saturday around dinner should be done more than a few days or week in advance unless you want very early or very late -- call if they don't show up online to double check about more times).\\n\\nAtmosphere: Post-modern industrial chic? The place has huge open spaces, 20ft ceilings, and near floor to ceiling windows for awesome nature light. It's softly lit and utilizes a lot of whites/silvers/greys to make a fairly neutral modernist palate. It can get loud at times but with the acoustics still makes it just seem like loud white noise. The vibe is both hip, elegant, refined, minimalistic, and relaxed at the same time.\\n\\nService: The service here is always fairly well-informed. They have their strong opinions which I appreciate but generally will wait for your permission before sharing it. There's a fair number of support staff that will come around to clear plates and refill water, but there's not always a tiered buddy system that some busy nicer restaurants institute around Boston. Come feel the service can be a little slow and that's often true even in less busy times. Coming here enough it's clear that's part european-esque intentionality and part somewhat inefficiency but nothing so major it'd make me take their rating down a star.\\n\\nFood: I've had some of my best dishes in Boston here. The Lobster Roe pasta is to die for -- such a crazy combination of food that just works. The Colorado Angus burger with bacon, cheddar on Brioche longs to be made into the \\"Oyster Burger\\" with the 5-dollar fried oyster add-on. It's a calorie bomb that continues to be so good even past when you're full, you can't stop eating. The oyster slider is a great bite for those who want to try a little everything but worry about over-ordering. The fried ipswich clams here are on par with Craigie on Maine and Neptune. Their oyster selection is superb and many of them curated themselves -- notably the island creek duxburys. So good. Their lobster roll is legit. Even their honeyed biscuit is surprisingly noteworthy and good. Most people end up ordering too much food -- but that's part of the inherent joy of their food and a testament to their product.\\n\\nDrink: They have an excellent selection of beer, wine, and liquor with pairing notes for oysters and food selection. They're happy to talk to you about recommendations with what you're ordering and coursing if you're getting hardcore about it. They have a list of ever-rotating cocktails with quips and fun poetry beside them; you can tell they have fun. I particularly enjoy some of the french bottles of medium-pricing that are hard to find at other restaurants and have had more than a few new beers that I've discovered on their rotating tap list here.\\n\\nPrice: ICOB isn't cheap. And I mean than in both manners of the word. Theres a few places you can go and get some of the same oysters for $2-2.50 that you'd get for $3-3.50 each here. But there's also a lot that you can't get anywhere else in town besides here, not in this setting, and not without waiting for a very long time without taking reservations. \\n\\nBottom line: If I don't have the time to sit and wait for Neptune to hopefully let me in and/or if I have more than just me and one other person looking for great seafood, I'm going to ICOB. I might not go weekly due to the prices but it sticks with me as an always satisfying and joyous experience.

Overall, the food is satisfying.   You won't go hungry.  For the sushi area, due to mass production, the quality and art is not there, only the novice sushi consumer who has not experienced real Japanese style of sushi would be satisfied.  In this case, it is not comparable.  Salad area and the other side type dishes around the corner of the the serving area, are of quality.  The true taste and the harmony of flavor keeps with its ethnic style, but with a twist ownership from the chef's recipe.  The main dishes, are of common to ordinary Chinese buffets.  Prepare yourself, with rudeness from other customers.  Can't really depict on one specific group, but the rude ones commonly put their head down and squeeze by between you and the serving area.  Some will actually look at you as if you are the one in error.  There is no specific order, just pure chaos.  If you have young ones, I suggest you provide cover while they get their food.  The rudeness has no boundaries.  In addition, don't expect any common courtesy, not even a simple, \\"excuse me\\".

The moist, flavourful turkey burger is made for the owner to his specifications so it isn't the dry \\"hockey puck\\"  one finds at most other burger places. The fries are hand cut right in the kitchen and are served in a very generous portion. The dipping sauce which comes as an extra is delicious with the fries but is not for those watching fat or calories! The milkshakes are made with hard ice cream in an old fashioned milkshake maker - simply delicious. Two people with an average appetite can easily order a burger, split an order of fries and split a milkshake and each be very full.\\nAlthough the atmosphere is authentic 1950's diner cool, the restaurant hours are quite restrictive. I usually don't start thinking about dinner until 7 -7:30pm so because the doors at Moderne close at 7:45pm it often loses consideration for me for a meal.

We live in Seattle and have been to many Thai restaurants..Their Coconut soup is the best we have ever had..the flavors are pure ecstasy!"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Powell's is probably world-renowed as a book store.  It's huge yet somehow cozy and personal all at the same time.  I never leave without a HUGE bag of books weighing me down.  Yet, I'm happy in spite of having to trek it home with all those heavy books (what WAS I thinking?).  New books, good books, bad books, obscure books, special rare books, and best of all-- the book you've been wanting, now at a discount- cause someone read it so now it's used books...Whatever.  It's a book lover's paradise.  Spend a couple hours, or spend a day, but if you're in Portland and you love books, Powell's is for you. (and if you are visiting and don't know better...for an extra special adventure, attempt to park your car in their weird parking garage....)"},{"name":"Welcome India food","address":"18631 SW Tv Hwy","city":"Aloha","stars":"4","text":"We came here on a whim. It was pretty good. I ordered paneer tikka masala, the sauce was was much thicker than I expected. But the samosas and mango lassi were delicious. The naan was delicious as well. We got there right at opening, ordered our food and about 20 minutes later it was done. Good place."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Brunch is worth the hour wait! It's definitely one of the best brunch buffet set ups I've had in Austin. My family comes from Dallas & Houston and ALWAYS asks to go to Moonshine on Sundays. Sitting out on the porch rocking chairs, just catching up, while enjoying a mimosa or bloody mary... Then getting to enjoy the endless buffet... Love this place!\\n\\n(I didn't rate it 5 stars only because we once went to dinner here and told the waitress my father was deathly allergic to legumes... Only to have her bring us an appetizer with hidden pecans (a legume FYI) on it and my father almost to whip out the epi pen... a mistake for certain. We will still go back - we'll just skip the appetizer!!)"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"SWEET MERCIFUL CRAP THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUSNESS!!! a party was going down in my mouth.
