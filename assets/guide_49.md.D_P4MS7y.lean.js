It is situated in a strip mall area of Beaverton.  I never thought a fancy, expensive restaurant can exist in such a place, interesting. We were seated, our waitress explained the menu, left, and returned with bread and butter. The bread was cold, so it was pretty hard to spread my butter. When ordering, we only had one choice for appetizers and two choices for salad for the second course. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought we get to choose between soup and salad as a second course.\\n\\nThe appetizer, pate brulee, was pretty good. I'm a big fan of pate, and there was something interesting about this particular pate that I kept asking for more bread to eat it with. However, we both agreed that the pate was a bit on the salty side for our taste buds. The salad, I got the house salad and my boyfriend go the trout salad, was pretty good. It tasted like regular salad with a good amount a dressing. There wasn't particularly special about it. \\n\\nWe only had three choices for our entrees. I got the trout and my boyfriend got the steak. I was only impressed by the sauce they had put over the trout. But otherwise, I also found the chickpeas/carrots to be a bit on the salty side. My boyfriend's steak was a bit under cooked. He had asked for medium, but it looked a bit too red, I thought it looked more like medium-rare. \\n\\nFinally, our dessert was the huckleberry/hazelnut brown butter cake.

The menu is simple, a handful of items. The iced green tea is a juice box, which is cute, but was a surprise. \\n\\nThey had sold out earlier in the day so we were among the first in line at 5 for the re-opening. We ordered the duck bao, the pork and cabbage bao, the soup dumplings, and an order of the five spice cashews. \\n\\nWe were served the duck bao first, which come three to plate. They were good, but not quite the duck flavor I had hoped for. It was overpowered by the sauce, and left us with more or less something that tasted like a bbq pork bao. The dipping sauce was wonderful, however. We had to ask for our nuts - which were addictive. A touch heavy on the anise in the five spice, but we devoured them. Perfect crunchy snack to go with the meal! \\n\\nThe soup dumplings arrived and we were overjoyed with excitement. We loaded up our spoons, dribbled on some of the red vinegar and ginger sauce, and gave them a whirl. I was left feeling like a kid who had just accidentally let go of their balloon. My husband and I looked at each other, tilted our heads, and unspoken we realized we were each disappointed. So we tried a second dumpling, surely we were mistaken? Nope - the taste of bland disappointment. Were it not for the ginger and vinegar sauce, there would have been only the taste of stale water and vague notes of meat. I told my husband it tasted the way dirty sink water smells. The kitchen was wrapping soup dumplings as fast as they could for the growing crowd, and we assumed perhaps the rush was to blame for the average soup dumplings, and vowed to give them another try in a few weeks when things have calmed down. \\n\\nThe last dish to arrive was the plate of pork and cabbage bao, which we had ordered almost as an afterthought. The dough was that perfect sticky pillowy texture...and the flavor! It was that salty, umami, gingery, porky punch I had been expecting of the dumplings! We could not believe how delicious and fantastic and perfect the pork bao were, especially after our disappointing soup dumplings. We were sad to have only had three to share. The pork and cabbage bao won the entire meal, period. \\n\\nWe left disappointed that a place named for pork soup dumplings had pork soup dumplings that were a sad doughy flavorless event, but we left knowing we would come back for multiple orders of the pork bao! We will be giving them another try to see if it was just a case of the first-day oopsies on the dumplings. \\n\\nIn the meantime, get the pork and cabbage bao!

The seasoning was spot on- nothing was needed to compliment this dish. It was fresh and seasonal and so amazing. Why can't it be this way with salmon on the menu in my neck of the woods? I eat salmon at every place that it's offered and it's never been this good - my colleagues came and joined me later and I got a pic of one of the lighter fare which is was a grilled cheese and crab sandwich with a bisque soup- forgot what it was called- my other colleague got the steamer clams and said they were delicious too. \\nI am excited that our education director tells us that we will be using this hotel for many of our future classes- I want to try the wrapped scallops if they're still on the menu in my next visit. \\nThank you Gracies for a wonderful evening and the most delicious food.

Quizno's was too expensive for a sandwich but have to agree $10 bucks for a sandy, chips & small drink is a bit much.  \\n\\nI've both ordered delivery & eat-in at this establishment.  Last week alone, we ordered x2 for the entire office ($60 - $70 on avg) & the food is always fresh!  Typically their sandwiches are overflowing w/ meat & all the fixins!  Haven't had a bad sandwich yet & have tried almost all of the menu.  \\n\\nI concur w/ another review that the music is played way too loud for eat-in.  Twice I've had a quick business mtg w/ a customer & we both agreed to hold the conversation till we got outside because we couldn't hear each other over the music.  I'm no fuddy-duddy either as I regularly attend music festivals & concerts ... I typically like to listen to my music louder than normal ... But not in a restaurant while attempting to carry on a conversation.  This is not a one-time exception as I routinely go in weekly to order my own food.  I've even observed an employee turn it up & start singing so loud it was disruptive ... I guess he thought he was being funny but after his poor attempt to sing, they left the music up loud!! \\n\\nLast but not least, a few times I've experienced a less-than-happy-to-help attitude from the person behind the register.   Once, I asked for my receipt & was told to \\"pick it up at the end.\\"  When I got to the end, they threw my receipt out & told me to go back to the register to get a new one.  No apology or desire to personally help out (not my job attitude).... Just rude.  Other than that, the overall customer service is hit or miss - some guys are great while others not-so-much.  \\n\\nI've had JJ's at all different locations both in & out of Florida.   In fact, January this year I was in Philadelphia for an emergency surgery on my dad.  I went to a nearby JJ's (3925 Walnut St location) & realized I had forgotten my wallet back in the hospital (Presbyterian Penn).  I had walked a 1/2 mile one way to get there ... The guy behind the counter told me, \\"it's on me this time\\" .... I was blown away by this great demonstration of above-and-beyond.  After enjoying my sandwich & a cup of water, I approached the counter again & asked if they took AMEX (yes).  I'm a freak of nature for memorizing numbers & I knew my 15 digit AMEX card number, exp date & security code - they entered it manually in to their system & I was able to pay for my sandwich after all but the good deed was already done!!  Now that's epic service in my opinion!!\\n\\nI heard a rumor Jimmy himself presents a Rolex watch to team members who go the extra mile & get recognized.  I know this because a client of mine worked on Jimmy's personal South Florida vacation home.   The client's superintendent was presented w/ a Rolex for an extraordinary job & was told the reason behind it.  Seems like the culture exists in senior & executive management but isn't getting implemented at the field / store level.  \\n\\nPros - great sandwiches & usually overflowing w/ the fixins.  Never had a bad sandwich here.  Usually delivery is Freaky Fast - can't think of a time where they've ever been slow. \\n\\nCons - prices are approaching a price threshold of almost too-much when a combo w/ medium drink is $10.69.   Music is too loud & customer service is inconsistent.  Room for improvement. \\n\\n3 Stars because the food is consistently good!

The ciabatta bread with chili oil & balsamic vinegar is killer as well. As always, he ordered the brisket empanadas & devoured them in 2.5 seconds. I usually order the Scallops served with Gouda Grits (heavenly) or the American Shrimp, which is essentially a gourmet version of a lowcountry boil (also delectable), but this time, I opted to try their special Jalapeno Glazed American Sea Bass served over Cauliflower & Swiss Chard. It was out of this world! Highly recommend trying it if it makes the menu again (menu changes daily). We opted out of dessert since I baked a red velvet cake, but secretly, the Spicy Molten Lava cake was screaming my name... ah c'est la vie... next time!

Yet the In-Laws are in town, and there is nothing worse then hungry relatives, especially when your home is their base of operations for the week.  They start foraging through the house, and the last thing you want to find is your In-Laws going through your drawers.  Having heard of possible long waits for those arriving later in the morning, the Tall Leggy Blonde and I decide to forgo some extra shut eye time and took the parental-unit-in-laws to Broder for a Scandinavian breakfast.\\n\\nWe got the last table upon opening, yet still found our wait for food to be close to an hour.  As the in-laws were accompanying us, I decide to play it conservative and abstain from the \\"AM Booze\\" specials and stuck with coffee.  Black...and lots of it.  Well, by the time our food did arrive, I had consumed way too much java, and was jitterier than a hyper active, attention deficit disordered four year old on a candy binge.  I should have gone for the Bloody Mary.\\n\\nThe food was good; the TLB and I both had the waffles topped with egg and ham.  Excellent...very fresh tasting, with unique flavors.  I would order it again, but seeing the baked eggs, would probably go that route.\\n\\nThe In-Laws both selected the Breakfast Bords.  I don't think they were impressed; being from the Midwest, I think something a little more hearty would have been to their liking.  And to mine as well.  While the waffle combo was terrific, I can become a glutton when it comes to breakfast.  I like something that either fills me up for the large part of the day, or else put me into an immediate food coma.\\n\\nThe other item that keeps Broder from being a 5 star breakfast stop was the waitress who was borderline rude...never smiled, and had a very obvious dislike for being at work that day.

That having been said, I did have a small tinge of hope when I walked in the doors at The Rheinlander while visiting a friend in Portland.\\n\\nStar 1 - Was the service good?\\n\\nMy visit to The Rhinelander got off to a roaring start upon meeting Maria, our lovely waitress.  While she was wearing an absolutely ridiculously gimmicky outfit, she was from Western Germany and had moved to the States 30 years prior after marrying an American GI.  Maria was absolutely brilliant the entire evening, and even was able to give my group some pointers on where to find a good spaetzle shredder.  Star Granted.\\n\\nStar 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?\\n\\nAdmittedly, my quest for the elusive German restaurant took a hit when I opened the menu.  With options like a 10oz. \\"New York Sirloin\\" littering the menu, I couldn't help but sigh, and when I saw that my Jaegerschnitzel came in at an absolutely astronomical $15.00 USD (a basic dish that is never more than $10 in Germany), my sigh was compounded by financial despair.  Yes, The Rheinlander is a nice place, but for as hard as they push authentic German cuisine, their prices are far from authentic.  While my Jaegerschnitzel was properly large, it was far from $15 large, and my friend's \\"Alpine Feast\\" was flat out lacking in the portion department. No Star Granted.  \\n\\nStars 3/4 - Did the food taste good?\\n\\nAfter getting over the menu and the price, I really was able to shed a tear of joy when my Jaegerschnitzel with Spaetzle transported me back to some of my favorite restaurants back in Rhineland-Pfaltz.  The schnitzel was properly breaded, pounded, and lathered in a wonderfully authentic mushroom gravy.  As for the Spaetzle, it really did give my mom and run for her money. Purely German!  From a taste perspective, my dish was wonderfully authentic and tasted fantastic. Dual Stars Granted.  \\n\\nStar 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?\\n\\nDirectly associated with my younger years, German is more than a cuisine to myself and my entire family, and while The Rhinelander does offer some fantastically authentic service and food, there was just enough Americanization to make me cringe here and there.

We were in a hurry to get to a play, but they brought out the dishes in fairly quick succession, giving us enough time to get out east. \\n\\nSo we went through the following dishes: \\n\\n1. Grilled black cod with miso and mustard - the cod was smooth, slippery, and sublime; oily with that deep fish aroma you get from cod, yet it was very light on the palate, with a great savoriness. However, it was a really stingy serving (about 6 bites worth) for $8.99.\\n\\n2. Fresh crab california roll - tasty and light, the roll really did bring out the salt and sweetness inherent in fresh crab that is unique and highly different from the pollock that masquerades as fake crab. However, but they did not shell the crab well. In particular, they didn't remove those shell portions that are at the top of crab legs, as I I felt a lot of those shell fragments (and saw them) when eating the roll.\\n\\n3. Salmon and avocado roll - the salmon was the right balance of fresh salmon flavor with a small balance of fat, but the avocado was a little hard, so the roll wasn't perfect.\\n\\n4. Nigiri -  we had uni (sea urchin), ahi (red tuna), toro (tuna belly) and hotate (scallops). My friend was adventurous and she enjoyed the toro the most, which I expected since it's the most friendly to newcomers. Personally, I thought the uni was very nice and, the ahi was kind of tough and sinuous (another disappointment considering it was one of their special limited items), the toro sublime with a lovely finish, and the hotate that nice balance of light meat, sweet sea taste, without the rubberiness or fishiness that can come if the scallop isn't fresh.   \\n\\n5. Gomae roll - this made for an interesting concept but was poorly executed. While the roll was fine (the spinach and rice held together), they served a very thin sesame sauce for dipping that made the roll feel drippy and wet. I understand that they wanted to try and serve it like goma-ae (where the sesame is on top of the roll), but the sesame dressing is thick when it comes for gomae so people can mix it in... it's not a watery mess. Water around already kind of watery spinach is a bit of a fail. \\n\\nThe service was polite and attentive, but didn't really know much about the menu. So nothing to write home about.\\n\\nI wanted to like this restaurant, but it just ended up being so-so when I went there. Sushi standards in Vancouver are high, and if you are going to charge what Hime does, then you'd better have good quality to your items."},{"name":"Thai Noodles House","address":"2602 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"If you're looking for low-hassle, delicious yet cheap Thai food, this is the place to go.

Sandwiches are served open face and are easily shareable when paired with one of the daily soups (I had the cucumber soup my first visit, which was chilled and a little bland for my palate).  Of the sandwiches I have tried, I enjoyed the chicken salad (large chunks of chicken, topped with nuts and dried cranberries, very filling) and the smoked salmon (saltiness of the fish offset nicely by the garlic and herb cream cheese).

(yes pun intended)\\n\\nI've been wanting to try this trailer for MONTHS now and I finally had the chance to come back to Austin and grab brunch on Sunday.  The combination of mouth-watering pictures and some positive review on the food led me to believe this would be one of the top fried chicken experiences I've ever had.  Pure excitement.\\n\\nSo I'll get straight to the point and start with the food.  Everything about this trailer is smoke and mirrors.  You ooooo and ahhh at the truffle aioli,  Your mouth waters when you see pictures of the fried chicken but it's all a facade.  The chicken and waffles well set you back about 9, almost $10 bucks, the mac n cheese about $5.  Hey, no problem, this place sounds GREAT. \\n\\nAbout 20 minutes later... you're served a fancy pants fried chicken and waffle with eggs benedict etc etc.\\n\\nHow things went wrong:\\n\\nWaffle?  It was burnt! Everyone around me was getting burnt waffles on the bottom.  How hard is it to NOT burn a waffle?  I just don't comprehend.  It's not like they were swamped or anything.\\n\\nChicken and waffles?  It came with LITERALLY one small chicken tender, take about misleading advertising on your website but fine whatever.  I'll redeem it if it tastes good.  Was it tasty?  No, absolutely not, I can tell that they attempted to throw in some unique spice mix but the chicken failed on a basic levels.  The chicken itself was dry and it was underseasoned.  Oh you brine the chicken?  That doesn't mean anything when you fry it to death.\\n\\nThe Egg?  It was an well-done poached egg.  I mean geez,...\\n\\nTruffle Mac n Cheese?  Definitely overrated.  You can't just throw fancy ingredients around and call it GOOD food.  The Mac and Cheese lacked any cheesy flavor to it.  The truffle aioli was interesting but honestly didnt add another dimension or positive anything to the dish.  I've had better mac n cheese at a cafeteria.\\n\\nTo keep it simple, I would choose Chick-Fil-A, Popeyes, Church's, heck even Max's Wine Dive who charges just as much is way better. RIP Not Your Mama's food truck because your bird was righteous, and now I miss it even more\\n\\nThe criteria I typically set forth when I review a restaurant is based on 2 things,  1) Would I recommend this to a friend? and 2) Am I getting good value for what I'm paying.  Ms P's failed to deliver on both.  I am happy to say that they FINALLY added their prices to their menu so people aren't kicked in the nads after ordering 3 pieces and a side and receiving a $15 bill for that.\\n\\nAll I'm saying is if they didn't charge so much, I probably would have given it 3 stars.

I'll put it to you this way... Take those that are just nori (the dark shell around it), some rice, and a piece of cucumber. Then take those you get at any ol' supermarket. Somewhere in between those two (although to be fair, closer to the supermarket size)\\n\\nAs for the ingredients, while they weren't bad or spoiled, they certainly weren't at their finest. The cucumber stood out the most, primarily because I could taste the crunch it offered the dish. The rest of it though got lost somewhere in the mediocrity. \\n\\nFor one, the rice could have used a little more flavor, usually rice vinegar goes into sushi rice, and here I think it was either skimped or skipped entirely. As for the fish, while I found it okay, it wasn't the freshest piece of tuna I'd had. I knew it was there, and based on looks they didn't skimp on this ingredient, I found it rather hard to find as I was eating.\\n\\nIn terms of it being spicy, while they did use some kind of spicy sauce on top, I didn't find the dish to have any distinguishable heat (although I should mention I have reduced sensitivity to sharp foods.\\n\\nI had no issues with the service speed, but this was because I was the only one who had an order going at the time. \\n\\nOverall, the food may not be bad in and of itself, but considering quality and quantity I find the value subpar."},{"name":"Happy Valley Station Food Carts","address":"13551 SE 145th Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Been here twice now.

I only tried 12 of the doughnuts... so check their website for more variety/the cream filled ones (since those don't tickle my fancy).\\n\\nThe Voodoo Doll : This guy is a chocolate covered glazed raspberry jelly doughnut, with a pretzel rod jammed into it. This one was pretty tasty. It was a little much having it both glazed and covered in chocolate, somewhat of a sugar overload, but the raspberry jelly was so good. Now I wouldn't leave the pretzel in for too long... after my long plane ride home the pretzel had gotten soggy and weird. This one was one of my top picks. I think it was partially because of the jelly. That stuff tasted like real raspberry jam.\\n\\nMaple Bacon Bar: You know that saying \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\"?... the same applies to this doughnut. You cannot judge it until you try it (unless you are thinking, DAMN that looks good). This one was by far my favorite. It was like a hearty breakfast of pancakes with maple syrup and bacon. Bacon makes everything better. The doughnut was deliciously perfect, the maple frosting was not tooo sugary, but just enough mapley-ness, and the bacon was not greasy at all so its saltiness complimented the sugar quite nicely. My mate denied trying this until my begging/nagging/high pitched squeals of persistence annoyed him enough to try it. As much as he wanted to hate it... he loved it. The rest of the tasting gang truly enjoyed it too, even though some were hesitant at first. BOOM. so take it from me and just trust the bacon.\\n\\nDirt: This little munchkin is a regular doughnut with vanilla icing and Oreo cookies crumbled on top. They made sure not to skimp on the Oreos, which was nice. Dirt was pretty tasty. This one topped the hubby's list of favorites. It was simple, yet fun enough that your mouth had a good time eating it.  Having a glass of milk nearby also helps. Overall I would recommend this one for future guests.\\n\\nOld Dirty Bastard (pardon my french): This fun concoction is comprised of: a doughnut, chocolate frosting, Oreo crumbles, and peanut butter. This was a richer version of the Dirt doughnut. It was tasty. Nothing I would exclaim about, but definitely worth a try. The peanut butter was a fun addition.\\n\\nButterfingerling: I really liked this one. I think it has something to do with the fact that I liked Butterfingers... but who knows. This doughnut was one of the smaller more condensed versions of the regular (instead of those big fluffy airy ones), with vanilla frosting and crushed Butterfingers. YUM. This wasn't overbearing in the least, and small enough that you don't feel too guilty combining 2 desserty things into one.\\n\\nNo Name: Regular doughnut, chocolate frosting, rice krispies, and peanut butter. Unfortunately I found the cereal to be stale. :/ It was a bit of a disappointment since I was really looking forward to a nice subtle crunch to compliment  the soft doughnut. The flavors weren't out of control, but if the rice krispies were crunchy... it would have been a whole lot better.\\n\\nDiablos Rex: a little condensed chocolate doughnut, with chocolate frosting, a vanilla star design, chocolate chips, and red sprinkles! I love sprinkles. They make everything better... just like bacon. The chocolate chips were a super fun addition. I would give this one a go if you are into the whole chocolate thing.\\n\\nTriple Chocolate Penetration: You would think with a name like Triple Chocolate Penetration that it would be a mouthful of chocolatey goodness. Nope. Although the doughnut itself was chocolate, with chocolate frosting, and coco-puffs, the coco-puffs were stale, and ruined the whole experience. I think Voodoo has to buy this cereal stuff in bulk, so more often than not their cereal infused creations will be stale. Heartbreaking. Crunchy chocolatey coco-puffs on even more chocolate sound like a dream.\\n\\nCaptain my Captain: This vanilla frosted, Captain Crunch encrusted doughnut would be a hit... but the cereal was (all together now...) stale. :/ so this was more of a bummer to try than anything. If you are a huge fan of the cereal though, I would just keep ordering it until you get non-stale encrustments. It looks pretty delicious otherwise.\\n\\nThe Loop: The Loop was the same as the Captain doughnut... except with stale Fruit Loops. If only I had known!! I would have saved myself the agony of trying all these tasty sounding doughnuts only to be sad I spent 2 bucks on each :( \\n\\nMarshall Matters: The eloquently named M&M covered doughnut was a hit! I love M&M's and since those cannot get stale, I enjoyed eating it very much. It was a simple doughnut with vanilla frosting, but it tasted and looked good! If you like M&M's then this one is definitely worth trying.\\n\\nRaspberry Romeo: a powdered sugar, raspberry jelly filled doughnut. IT IS DIVINE. Anything with that raspberry jelly is worth it."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm lovin it. their creativeness of the donut. mmm!

The service ( I believe our server was Ally) was amazing. The attention to allergies was so clutch especially since I kept trying to order things that wouldn't agree with that.

Though the food and service were good, there just wasn't anything about Coast that stuck out as amazing for me.  This was my first visit but apparently they have just completely redone their menu converting it from a menu that was heavy with fried options to one that has more seafood classics.  \\n\\nWhile the bar & patio areas are more casual with wood tables and stools, I found the dining area to be a bit dated with white table clothes and primary colored, abstract art pieces on the walls. I think Coast is struggling to find that happy balance between a casual seafood joint and a more upscale seafood restaurant. While I prefer their take on a casual atmosphere, the menu and pricing do not match that vibe. Also, the raw bar options seem too disjointed from the dishes on the regular menu. One note on their bar is they have no beers on draft and a relatively small selection of bottled beers for this part of town.  The cocktail list looked tasty though and there are plenty of reasonably priced wines. \\n\\nI opted for the Sea Scallop Risotto as my meal. Three large scallops came on top of a plate of creamy & flavorful risotto.  The scallops were well cooked and the risotto was soft.  Everyone at my table seemed happy with their dinner choices and the kitchen was happy to make a few substitutions that different people at my table requested. \\n\\nOn another positive note, 10% of our check went to help support a local charity, The Empty Stocking Fund.  I applaud any local business that is willing to help organizations like this one and it says a lot about the type of people who own and manage Coast.  I enjoyed my food, company, and service but nothing made me want to click my heels or jump for joy."},{"name":"Brooklyn Pizza","address":"1647 Arapahoe Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This is the best pizza I've had in Boulder, and I've lived here for over 25 years.

Both service and food quality varied quite a bit and weren't what we had hoped.\\n\\nThe meal started off deliciously with the Plateaux. Our party of 4 had mixed feelings on raw seafood, so the combination of that plus charcuterie is an excellent idea. Presentation was very nice, seafood was perfectly cold and fresh, charcuterie board was savory and interesting (great pickles). The snail toast was also excellent, although from a service perspective, we were disappointed that the waitress did not ask the kitchen to cut the toast in four pieces; she brought it out to a table of 4 in 3 slices. Minor detail, but not the service you expect from a restaurant rated \\"best new restaurant in North America\\" by Esquire.\\n\\nNext, we devil's egg fans ordered Townsman's spin on this old-school dish but were disappointed that it deviated pretty far from the traditional, to the point that calling it deviled was a bit of a stretch. It was a perfectly acceptable dish in its own right, but unfortunately the title misled our expectations.\\n\\nThe saddest outcomes were the crudo - the yellowfin, fluke and beef were all severely oversalted. Lovely cuts of fish, and beautifully tender beef, were all completely ruined by the excess of salt. Even worse, the waitress did not appear to find it odd that a table of obvious foodies left half of a tartare dish untouched. We could not even swallow it.\\n\\nThe redeeming spot was the quail, an absolutely perfect dish in flavor, presentation and tenderness. We ate every last bite.\\n\\nMy husband and I went with friends who are chefs. They were concerned that perhaps the kitchen might want to know about the mistakes in the crudo, so one of them gently pointed out to the waitress that the dishes were oversalted, in hopes that she would notify the manager or the line crew. Instead, she mumbled something about the creativity of the dishes and hurried away when we requested the check. A few minutes later, the manager appeared with a flourish, announcing that a table that appreciated the bottle of wine we'd ordered earlier deserved a bottle, on the house, of XX (I don't recall what it was). He opened and served it, and unfortunately we didn't care for it, but he never mentioned the issue with salt or expressed regret, which made the free wine a meaningless gesture. Next, a free dessert came to our table; unfortunately, it featured a Miso sauce, and at that point, we just couldn't bear the thought of more salt and were beginning to feel a bit hostage while we waited for the check - which we'd requested before these random comps began appearing. We finally settled the check and left.\\n\\nOverall, the service, while sincere and well-intentioned, seemed inexperienced. A truly excellent wait staff would not allow a plate to come out divided 3 ways for a party of 4. They would address our concerns directly and sincerely, and respect our interest in the check vs. plying us with random food and drink we didn't need or want. These are rookie mistakes, but hopefully one that a restaurant like Townsman can address and correct. The dishes that we loved were truly fantastic; we just wished for more consistency.\\n\\nA minor note on decor: hip but sterile. We all wished it had a bit more warmth; the hard floors, spare table style and large windows did make the space airy but also felt a bit chilly and generic.

It seems like everyone has heard of Voodoo doughnuts and wants to give them a try.  So it wasn't surprising that there was a huge line outside the shop whenever we go there.  Thankfully that long line doesn't take too long to get through.  Whenever you finally make it into the shop you are able to see a pretty nice space.  It was brightly colored with lots of photos on the wall and had a cool chandelier type light.  By the time we got up to the spot to order we had already made our selections long before.  So it was with great sadness that they told me that they were out of the lemon chiffon that I wanted.  As a quick backup selection I ended up ordering the maple bacon bar.  We then made it to the register and paid our cash (it's a cash only place) before heading outside to sit at one of their tables.  The doughnut portion of my bar ended up being fresh and really good while I also enjoyed the bacon.  What I didn't enjoy as much was the maple frosting which i found to be a bit too sweet for me.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Hopefully the next time they will have the lemon chiffon and I can leave a bit more impressed."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It's something you have to experience at least once.... but once is enough.\\n\\nWhen I first moved to Portland, I had no idea what I was standing in line for- just that the line went around the block, it was booming awesome music, and normal looking people were in line (good cue letting me know it wasn't a crack house or X-rated), so I figure, 'I got some time, why not?'\\n\\nOnce in, I thought the interiors were fun, the workers seemed a bit bored, but friendly enough. The selection of donuts and their donut decor was also fun, but the taste is honestly like any other friend ball of dough you would find at a generic donut shop... with a ton of frosting and other goodies on top.\\n\\nAfter having it, you'll be tempted to grab a box of cereal and some frosting to make your own. And you might as well. Safeway, Fred Meyers, and all the other grocers in town are doing it too. \\n\\nSince that first experience, i've stopped in once for a couple of donuts, but always found that 1 or 2 bites was enough before my head exploded from the sugar. \\n\\nSeriously, once is enough."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay, I've heard SO MUCH about voodoo doughnuts. When I was visiting Portland everyone was telling me to try this place because it had the best donuts ever. I was little skeptical because I'm from LA and NOTHING beats the food or desserts out there. \\n\\nSo after dinner, we decided to walk over to this joint located near Chinatown. This place is CASH ONLY. I'm not sure if the other place is cash only as well, but the voodoo doughnuts in Chinatown was so that was a bummer. They have an ATM machine inside so you're in luck if you don't have cash. \\n\\nThe venue is SMALL, and dirty as hell. Actually, the surrounding area of the venue seemed like your typical LA skid row type of area so if you're feeling something nicer, maybe you should head to the other one somewhere in Portland. \\n\\nWe ordered half a dozen donuts, and it came out to be 10 bucks? It's pretty pricey for donuts but since it's a popular joint I guess they can hike up the dollar amount. They're also popular for their vegan options but we didn't have any of that. \\n\\nIn all honesty, this place is all hype. I'm not sure where the hype stemmed from but gotta give it up to their marketing skills. It tastes like any other donut joint but more expensive. \\n\\nBut when in Portland, it's always good to visit their most famed donut shop at least once. Probably won't come here again if I head up to Portland again. \\n\\nCalifornia donut shops are better.

Thin, crispy crust from a deck pizza oven. No conveyer belt. Sauce was nice. Well balanced flavor without that sweetness. Cheese was gooey, without being rubbery. The pepperoni was sliced thin, and did not curl into bowls of grease. It was not overly spicy, yet tasty. \\nWe sent the meatball sub back, because we found them to have the consistency of a meat paste. Homemade, but too much time in the food processor. Exchanged for a chicken parm sub. They toasted the sub roll with garlic butter. The great marinara, cheese, and garlic bread would have been perfect with grilled, or freshly breaded chicken.

That maple-bacon doughnut was a symphony of delight, and their signature voodoo doll doughnut (with the raspberry filling, natch) was soft and delicious. These are well-made doughnuts for people looking for something a little more off the wall than a plain glazed, and Voodoo Doughnut definitely delivers.\\n\\nCons: THE WAIT. My word. Line was out the door LITERALLY all day. We walked past the place a couple of times throughout the day, and the line never got any shorter.\\n\\nI eventually gave up and went to their satellite location instead in the SE part of town. which was fine, and still seemed to have the same bonkers aesthetic as its home location. BUT the fruity cereal topping on my fruity cereal doughnut was super super stale. Yuck. Might have been a fluke, and I might have hit at the wrong time of day, but if I'd actually had to wait in line for over an hour for that doughnut, I'd have been extra pissed.\\n\\nI enjoyed the doughnuts!

The voodoo doughnut was pretty good with the jelly filled center and the oreo encrusted one was pretty good too. I just had a bite from each and the sugar was enough for me.

The waiter full of apologies told us to have dessert on the house.  We ordered dessert which was served promptly and it was wonderful. We were thinking perhaps they were having an off night and perhaps we might come back, but when we received the check we were charged for the appetizer we did not receive as well as the dessert that was complimentary.  When we brought the issue of the appetizer up to the waiter he stated are you sure you did not receive it?  I mean really...we didn't bother to discuss the \\"free\\" dessert...we just didn't leave him a tip... but I do  have a tip for the waiter and the restaurant manager...good time management is key   several people with reservations were waiting 15 minutes to over 30 for a table in an unheated entry way with the temperature outside hovering at 25 degrees! If you were a regular patron you were served immediately if you were a new comer, well I guess you were just taking up space.... I was never so insulted in my life.

Friendly but not gushy.  Inviting but not rehearsed.  Attentive but not hovering.  It reminds me of the casual gold standard that the Dube and Nancy's always seem to have.  It was that glint in the eye that says, look, I'll bust my hump to get you whatever it is you need and I'll do it with a smile, but then I'll leave you be to chew your own food.  I like to be served without being waited on, if that makes sense, and OBON is exactly that for me.  I detected a hint more formality at the Worthington location, but maybe that was just my imagination.\\n\\nThe bottom line: this is a neighborhood pub with pubby food, but they offer some wonderful fresh seafood entrees that makes you forget there are a row of barstools right next to you.

The beautiful bar area was quiet and the bartender invited me to sit while I waited for my group. \\n\\nI couldn't help but try their Ohio Honey martini (made with both Bros.

Yay!), and a bit of fresh greens and goat cheese to kill the chile burn while the mushrooms added a great earthy undertone.\\n\\nMy (awesome) entree was the kalua pork, which came out of the banana leaf almost melting away on the tongue, seasoned just enough to let the pork speak for itself, and well complimented by the carrots and mashed parsnips / potatoes.\\n\\nFinally, for dessert, I called an audible and our server was good enough to let me get away with it - instead of going with one of the Dine Originals desserts (both of which looked quite tasty, I admit, but...) I asked if I could get a dessert that had caught my eye on the specials board - Apple & Chai Pot Pie. With a pleased twinkle in his eye, he granted my wish, and more than satisfied my curiosity.\\n\\nThe apples and chai spices blended perfectly under a crispy, flaky crust, with a tiny bit of vanilla ice cream on top to round things out.\\n\\nI also have to mention the beautiful job that BCB did with the portions - each course was just big enough to be enjoyable and satisfying without leaving you wanting more or feeling like you had too much to finish before the next course would arrive.

I always wondered if their burgers were really KILLER. So, it was no surprise when I check this year's Burger Week participants and \\"Grindhouse Killer Burgers\\" was listed.\\n\\nThis year's burger entry is the Grindhouse Style Junior Burger, made of 1/4 lb. angus beef. This burger is topped with grilled onions, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and Grindhouse sauce. The one thing I didn't like is that they only offer their burgers medium or well. If you want medium well, like me, you're SOL. I ended up getting medium. I used to be a \\"well done\\" guy, but I grew a different taste for consistency. As I figured, the medium was softer than I would've liked it. They were slightly too generous with the Grindhouse sauce. I got my burger to go. 10 minutes after getting it, the bun was practically mushy from being soaked by the sauce. Nevertheless, the burger was still tasty and flavorful. I didn't get to finish it, though. Towards the end of my burger, the bun was just too drenched for my liking. \\n\\nI also ordered a side of crinkle fries for $2.50. The fries were very good. The perfect amount of season salt. \\n\\nWhile I waited for my food, I noticed much of the inside and outdoor seating. Seems to have a lot of space, but I'm sure this place can get packed. They have HELLA awards for being the shizznit in Atlanta. \\n\\nOverall, my first experience was ok. I appreciate them for participating in Burger Week, allowing this burger to be $5. With its toppings, this burger would usually be $6 with the cheese and grilled onions (both .50 each). So you're saving a buck. I think next time I'll order a different burger not associated with Burger Week and definitely will get my burger well done.

I'd like to say WOW. I was here on President's Day at 1 pm and the place was bumping. There was a 20 minute wait but once you sat down; you were in the world of wieners. You can have it just about any way you want it. I had the chili cheese dog with relish. I felt a little odd about the relish. It was super green like it was fake. I wasn't sure if it was edible! I tried it and 2 days later, I'm alive. Safe to eat! The hot dogs are thick not like your regular store bought hot dogs and it wasn't greasy after taking a bite, and neither was the chili! I enjoyed my chili cheese dog. Let's be honest, I did not get the runs from chili. So thumbs up! My boyfriend had the plain dog with kraut and porked it, which means white American cheese, wrap with bacon and deep fried. I had a bite and it tasted OK, I didn't realized it had bacon around it until I was told. My favorite redhead had the nacho dog, she said it was OK and it's quite messy to eat. We also had the Britney Spears, which is fried pickle spears with ranch. I felt it was a little greasy and the batter was flaky like they used cornflakes or something, it was not your typical batter. I also ordered the mini corn dogs. The batter was a little greasy and a little soft. I would have liked a little crispy, IMO. We also had the chili cheese waffle fries. Perfect, couldn't have been any better. I also like the fact they offer apps in 2 portion sizes. \\n\\nWe also tried their drinks: I had the Ginger Cherry Limeade with Monopolowa Vodka, ginger simple syrup, fresh lime juice, \\ncherry cider - it was very refreshing but could have used a little bit more vodka. I am your true alcohol tester as I turned red as soon as I drink a sip of alcohol. The hotter my face determines how much alcohol was in the drink, and my face was only mildly red. The Triple Crown was very strong for me but I'm also not a fan of whiskey. The Ranch house - Wood ford Reserve, fresh lemon juice, ginger syrup, fresh squeezed blood orange juice, it was also refreshing. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and my favorite red head ordered the bacon infused Marker's Mark shot. I had a sip and oh boy, it seemed like it was a little stronger than usual with the bacon in it. To top it off, the waiter came back with complimentary double shots of the same! Big deal! \\n\\nI had a great experience and enjoyed the ambiance. They seem to have their operations in order, especially with the wait and their service was great. Our waiter was fun and treated us like we were his friends.

Its hard to cook brisket right, often it is dry - but this brisket was moist & tasty. The place was crowded even with a late reservation.

Since I am a sucker for trying new ethnic food,  I rolled thru the drive thru on my way to work. Got 1/2 chicken hot with yucca fries and white corn. Tried the yucca fries right away since I figured they wouldn't hold. Found them very starchy and a bit under done.  Lacked seasoning too. The fries came with a watery ranch based dipping sauce that was underwhelming.  Not a good start. The corn was just corn. No seasoning nothing. Like frozen corn out of a bag. The meal came with a basic salsa that managed to rescue the corn out of obscurity. The chicken, however, was very tasty if not a bit over done and dry. Very flavorful. You could really tell it was cooked with charcoal.  Heat level was medium at best, but built well thru the meal. Would love to see them offer a \\"HOTTER\\" version, but they only have 2 levels of heat.\\n\\nA drive-thru meal that came to just over 12 bucks seemed kinda pricey for 4 small pieces of chicken, 2 sides, and what would amount to a small drink anywhere else.

The octopus was some of the best I have had. It wasn't overly chewy or rubbery, but it made me realize that I just don't like octopus unless it's fried or in takoyaki. The ricotta, however, was to die for. So hot you had to spoon it onto a plate and wait for it to cool a bit before shovelling it in your mouth with the accompanying bread. I say shovelling because I could not get enough! For such a simple dish, it was rather special.\\n\\nWe got a simple pepperoni pizza and again was wowed by how good such a simple dish can be.

Believe it or not, after all that we still had room for dessert (there was 4 of us). We all split a single order of the chocolate budino.

I still enjoyed the dish, and was happy the salmon wasn't scrawny (good size chunk). \\n\\nAgain, the place was good but I probably won't be back just because there are better.

This past weekend I went in and was utterly impressed.\\n\\nThey have a great selection of quality meat (much better than Stop-and-Shop) but, more importantly, have a full-service market there (not \\"grocery store\\", but all the basics you need). That was a huge discovery for me, as I now know I can just walk down the street if I run out of essentials or want to pick up a steak for a small dinner, as well as veggies, sides, condiments, etc. Everyone there was very friendly and helped me choose some meat on the two occasions I've been there.

For some reason, french fries are really the only kind of potato side that restaurants seem to be able to get right: the roasted fingerling potatoes served with the pork were no exception.  They were practically flavorless and almost all of them were undercooked.  The blood red stonefruit chutney was also underwhelming.\\n\\nDesserts, however, were amazing.

On the menu its described as confit duck leg paired with cilantro-infused rice, a savory-sweet passionfruit sauce and baby carrots.  I was able to sub the baby carrots with spinach.  I was so sad when I finished eating because I've never really enjoyed duck that wasn't Peking duck before.  Also, Peking duck is good, but this was a totally different level.  My mind was blown.  I cleaned the duck down to the bone and my friends were like woah.  That's how good it was.  The dish is on the smaller side compared to their Lomo Saltado, so be prepared.  I did try some of the Lomo Saltado, but it was inferior to my duck entree.

Luckily the honey never crosses the line from complex to cloying. We also got the tomato tartare, which is a very creative dish. It's a play off of both tuna tartare (in presentation) and a caprese salad (in flavor combination). The other salad we got came with an olive tapenade toast and goat cheese toast. It was a solid salad, if a little forgettable. \\n\\nFinally, the escargot. I've never had it when the escargot do not come drenched in garlic butter (not that that's a bad thing), but this was absolutely delicious. Neither my dining companion nor I wanted to share this.

The ice cream was also delicious. \\n\\nAs for Sunday brunch, the menu is a bit limited, leaning definitely more toward savory than sweet. My cousin and I both ordered omelettes, which were solid.

We drive by all the time as we live in the area, and always thought the building looked beautiful.  Well my friends, this is indeed the case your lovely short and plumb 1st grade teacher always tells you about, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\\"   I was under the delusion that this place was in some way affiliated with J Gilbert's, which is right down the road.  J Gilbert's is a phenomenal high-class experience, which is what I thought we were going to find in Liu's...Not so much.  Under the guise of thinking I was going to a top of the line place, I called a week ahead to reserve a table.  The second we walked through the door I realized that was a waste of my time and completely unnecessary.  About  75% of the tables were empty at 6PM on a Friday.  Even though all the nice tables near the walls were open, our reservation landed us smack dab in the middle table with four pull out chairs right next to two families with kids. Nothing against children, but I don't want my night out to be right next to four friggin kids.  So we looked at each other and immediately asked to be moved to a booth away from the crowd.  Once we were moved we got a chance to look at our coffee/pop/water stained paper menus.  Then finally the delightful charm of a burned-out 50 year old angry woman waitress shows up.  She would walk by every minute or two while we read our vintage menus to ask \\"You know what you want yet?\\"  I explained we were in no hurry and wanted to order some appetizers first.  We ordered some calamari and pot stickers to start.  The calamari only spent about a month in the freezer before being thawed out to a rubbery shoelace texture.  There were no tentacle pieces just the gold ol' fashioned rubber pellets.   The pot-stickers actually may have just been purchased from TGI Friday's in Polaris.  Nothing special, over cooked, bland sauce, just over-all meh pot-stickers.  A couple minutes after these superb dishes arrived the \\"You know what you want\\"s started up again.  My wife had been saying for the past few minutes that nothing on the menu looked appealing.  I finally got her to order the \\"Chicken Milanese\\" and she added a crab cake side. I ordered the scallops.  10 minutes after our apps came the main dishes were rung-in, cooked, and at our table.  Score!  There's nothing I love more than not even being half way through my appetizer and having my main entree shoved onto the table.  Literally, she moved the appetizer plates over with our entree plates.  The chicken dish was essentially Chicken Parm and the crab cake was about 99 percent bread crumb.  My scallops were under-cooked and runny.  I choked down one of them while questioning if I should be eating a runny scallop.  The comic relief was when the manager walked by and asked \\"How was everything\\", my wife paused for a few seconds and says \\"good\\".  The manager goes \\"Ummmm I sensed some hesitation there, you sure?\\"  We don't complain so of course she said yes, and he just walked right away without trying to see why we didn't seem to be enjoying our food (or time there at all).   We got our bill for our nice big night out around 45 minutes after we arrived, I just love a nice leisurely meal.  For 3 drinks, 2 apps, and 2 entrees at this over-priced Applebee's we spent about 120 bucks.  To think of all the amazing places we could have gone to for that price brings a tear to my eye.

This was the number one must-hit spot on our list of Portland restaurants for our trip, and it absolutely did not disappoint. I asked the guy where he wanted to do his birthday dinner, and without missing a beat, he declared Andina. Reservations go pretty quick, so make sure you're making them early in advance to avoid waiting an hour for a table! \\n\\nWe actually arrived about 45 minutes early for our reservation because the guy got the time wrong (he's old and senile now at 28), but the hosts were kind enough to let us peruse the menu and grab a couple drinks for us. I had the hechicero, and he had the curatodo de sauco. We both really loved our drinks, though mine was a touch on the sweet side and his was stronger. We happily dipped on our drinks and scanned the menu, watching the yummy dishes fly out of the kitchen at lightning-fast speeds. \\n\\nWe ordered the Mixto Chorrillano Ceviche, the Mixta Nikkei Causa, the Conchas a la Parrilla, and the Arroz con Pato. The ceviche was probably the best I've ever had. Truly just a scoop out of the ocean, it had just about every sea creature ever, marinated beautifully and served with yummy sweet potato. Phenomenal. It was the perfect light tapa to kick off the meal. The causa was also so great; I will never understand how they get the potatoes so smooth and perfect in causas. I was a little weary at first about tuna and crab together in a causa, but it was so great. Some of the best tuna we had in Portland, for sure. The Conchas were probably my favorite dish of the evening. I love scallops a lot, but not a ton of places do them that well. The brown sugar butter sauce was absolutely amazing, and the scallops cooked to perfection. We were also able to get this dish gluten free, despite it not being on the gluten free menu! The Pato was the dude's favorite, mainly because it came with what appeared to be an entire half of a duck. It was roasted to perfection with an amazing sweet sauce that played beautifully with the cilantro rice. This was definitely a much bigger portion than our other small plates. \\n\\nOur server knew it was my guy's birthday, and brought out our two alfajores on a fancy plate decorated with \\"Feliz Cumplea√±os\\" and an extra dollop of manjar with a lit candle. Super thoughtful, and we really appreciated it. The alfajores were absolutely fantastic, and they were even gluten free! This was the first time the dude had an alfajore and he lost his entire mind. \\n\\nIf you're in Portland, you absolutely must make time for a wonderful meal at Andina."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Not only was this a great meal, but it was a great experience.

The barbecue sauce was there more to accentuate the flavor of the chicken than to cover something up, like it is in many other cases.\\n\\nDrinkwise, I stuck to cocktails from the infusion menu.  I had an excellent tequila-based cocktail with a mango juice ice cube.  I also got a gin-based cocktail (the \\"Tickle my Pickle\\") that wasn't quite as good, but that may have been a case of my expectations not matching reality more than a shortcoming of the cocktail itself."},{"name":"Armando's Pizza & Subs","address":"163 Huron Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Really good NY style thin pizza.

Shaded and relatively cool anytime after early afternoon.  The indoor seating seemed stark and uninviting, though I'm not sure why.\\n\\nThe service was pretty good through the entire dinner.\\n\\nBeets n Bleu salad $8 - The menu description had me expecting a pile of beets with some cheese, bacon and dressing.  It ended up being a standard green salad with a small amount of beets, some cheese crumbles and a strip of bacon.  Not bad, but not what I expected and I would have preferred the version I pictured ahead of time.  I probably would not get this again.\\n\\nDeep Fried Salmon and Oyster Appetizer $8 - This was a daily special.  You get three pieces.  They consist of a small oyster, a small piece of salmon, coated in something I could not identify and then deep fried.  It comes with lemon wedges and a mild dip made with cilantro leaves.  The dip and the crunchy exterior were pretty good, but the salmon/oyster interior was watery and did not have much taste and was not seasoned.  I would not get this again, though the people I was with liked it.   \\n\\nFish n Chips $16 - This was what I ordered and it was a major disappointment.  You get a wide shallow bowl with french fries in the bottom with fish piled on top.  When ordering I asked the waitress if the chips were crispy.  She responded that they were \\"extremely crispy\\".  They were not.  They might have been a little crispy at some point, but that was before they sat in a tub for a while.  They were a bit soft and not especially hot when served.  Initially it looked like I had gotten three large pieces of deep fried fish.  No.  I received one piece of fish with a lot of crispy batter and then two huge pieces of crispy batter that they passed off as fish.  (Tip:  Try the Frying Scotsman If you want three times as much fish, one third the amount of batter, the same amount of fries for a third of the price.)  I would not order this again.\\n\\nRisotto  with spring peas, oyster mushrooms, and spinach, topped with shaved parmesan $8 (small 5 oz version) - Not very good.  There was still a lot of free liquid, the rice was over cooked and it did not have much flavor.  I would not order this again.\\n\\nChick Pea Crepes $15 - One of my companions had this and indicated that she liked it.\\n\\nCocktails - Mojito $7 - A really small drink for the price.  Not much ice.  A single mint leaf that did not get much muddling.  My wife said it was OK, but that she would not order it again.\\n\\nBeer - They listed five or six draft beers on the menu, but only had two in stock.  They serve them at a relatively high temperature.  Close to what you might get at a real English pub.\\n\\nConclusion:  Nice location, good service, mediocre food and beverages and prices that are not justified by the food.  I will not be returning."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Very quaint place with good seafood.  Reasonable priced for quality and location.

I made a reservation, but not sure it was needed.  They had a couple of tables open on the inside, but the patio would still have been a 20 - 30 minute wait, even with reservations.  We opted for the inside.  Within about 10 - 15 minutes of arriving, every table was full (we got there at 7:30 on a Wednesday).\\n\\nFirst - the service:  Spectacular.  The host was very cordial and our server was professional and very attentive.  Nothing to complain about here!  And, there was a guy that must only be there to refill water/take dirty plates, as he came by our table 3 or 4 times to refill our water or remove our used plates.  That was a nice touch.\\n\\nSecond - the food:   Well, first, the menu:  They had the chicken I remembered from a few years ago (imho, it's probably the best thing on the menu) and a couple of steaks.  They had too much fish for my taste.  There were two on the written menu and two on the specials board.  While I'm sure it was tasty (the table beside us ordered two of the fish meals and they looked good), I thought it was overkill.   Anyway, on to what we actually ordered.\\n\\nI ordered the special soup: carrot, ginger, & basil soup and my gf had the arugula salad.  Both were good (well, I didn't taste the arugula, but Shawn raved about it).  For entrees I had the beouf au povre (filet), ordered medium and Shawn had the chicken.  The filet was cooked perfectly - a bit black and charred on the outside (making a nice crust) and dark pink on the inside, but very warm and not dripping (it was actually one of the rare occasions where the kitchen and I agreed on word 'medium').  The filet was served with Lyonnaise potatoes, sweet onions and a cognac au jus.  Shawn reported the chicken to be great.    The chicken was thyme roasted with mashed potatoes (well, Yukon gold puree, to be exact) and green beans (haricot verts).  We had a half bottle of Presseco to drink.\\n\\nWe opted to skip dessert, but from prior experience, I remember them to be fantastic.\\n\\nThe only ways it could have been better:  less fish (and more chicken or beef entrees to choose from) and sitting on the patio.

At $8, I feel the burger could have been a lot better. The mint inside it was brown and wilting, although it was otherwise quite tasty. Food truck food is supposed to be cheaper because you're not paying nearly as much for real estate. After all, $8-9 is what you'd pay for a veggie burger at a sit-down restaurant with a full plate of fries and a pickle. For me, they substituted about 8 potato chips instead of my beans, which is a pretty miserly amount after they pulled the bait and switch.\\n\\nTwo stars for the otherwise friendly service and the fact that they're trying to do something different.

I saved and spent and rationalized and didn't go for months. Then, one fine day, I see that Frank is hiring a barista. I happen to be a barista. I happen to love Intelligentsia coffee, which they serve at Frank. So, I apply and interview to no avail...\\n\\n(Aside) Not really important to your dining experience, but after I interviewed, the manager Jen, called me back just to say that while I seemed awesome they went in a different direction due to more restaurant experience. She was very nice and very professional which might surprise the hipster hater reviewers here. (End aside)\\n\\nSo, after a brief mourning period of my short-lived dream of being Frank's tallest barista, I dragged some buddies there on a Sunday evening. There were three of us and we ordered the following all to split:\\n\\nOne small order of Canadian Poutine: Fuck me. If it weren't for the snow and lack of other people, I'd move to Canada right now. Fries covered in gravy and cheese curds. GRAVY (i.e. crack). Frank can't really take credit for this one, but they do it (kudos) and they do it pretty well with the non-traditional waffle fries. I wanted more gravy, but I kind of always want more gravy.\\n\\nOne Chicago Dog (no pickles), Porked.: The Pork-It! option on the menu (stuff a dog with cheese, wrap it in bacon and deep fry it) reads a little more epic than it comes. I surely would've enjoyed the Chicago Dog un-porked just as well, but I didn't want to live my life not knowing what the Pork-it was like. The dog itself was good, however, as many other Chicagoan reviewers, one of my dinner partners was a native Chi-towner and basically agreed that it was a Chicago dog made in Austin and tasted as such.\\n\\nOne Texalina: Yes. Grilled cole slaw, spicy mustard bbq sauce, awesome baguette bun. Came highly recommended from our waitress and I will highly recommend it to you.\\n\\nOne order of Chocolate Covered Bacon: It's $2 for one strip of bacon. I can get one package of bacon for $2... but holy god is it delicious. You probably shouldn't eat more than one strip of that anyway.\\n\\nAlso ordered was one Lone Star, one Pig's Neck (the best whiskey ginger drink you will ever drink unless you find yourself at Flowers in Seattle), one Ginger Cherry Limeade (Sonic should make these), one Rummy Root Beer (made with Amy's Ice Cream... Frank is nothing if not locally focused), and one (effing amazing) cortado. I would send you here if you just wanted a cocktail. The list is very enticing.\\n\\nOur bill was around $50 and we were all full and happy. In the future I will be ordering large orders of Poutine. (extra crack, please!) And dear Frank, if everyone and I mean EVERYONE else in town can charge $2.50-$3 for a Fireman's 4 on tap, so can you. That is not a $5 beer. \\n\\nPro Coffee Tips: They don't do their delicious pour-over on Sunday brunch, they do French Press. Their siphon coffee, while undoubtedly delish is severely overpriced at $15 for 4 small cups. Go to Houndstooth for that.  \\n\\nTry it with an open mind and an empty stomach. Bring your friends so you can try more stuff. \\n\\nAlso, afterthoughts, the house music was very enjoyable and not too loud at all. I saw two TVs and maybe there was a third by the bar? We were seated in the loft area, which was nice for people watching and had one TV with a game on but the other massive HD TV was playing Desperate Housewives.

Place is definitely pretty cool looking and in a great part of town.  I had the Southern Fried, my wife had eggs Benedict and we shared the beignets.  To start with they were not beignets.  They were very hard and dense donut holes....very disappointing!  Not the way to start off with food impression.  Then we received our meals and my wife's was not what we ordered.  We asked if they had \\"traditional\\" eggs Benedict and were told they could make it.  What she got was nothing close.  English muffins with spinach and mushrooms with poached eggs and what was supposed to be hollandaise sauce, but clearly wasn't.  We asked the server, she did not deliver the food, if they could again make it \\"traditional\\" with eggs and Canadian bacon, she sId YES.  Came back again, not only was it poached eggs on regular bacon, but they had the audacity to scrape off the spinach and mushrooms and use same soggy English muffin, leaving a couple mushrooms still on.  Had it not been for my wife asking me to simply dismiss it, I would have coached them on how they should have handled this correctly.  The positive was my meal was decent and so was the coffee.

The buns are also pretty run of the mill grocery style.  The other was the Red Hot Waffle Fries.  Simply dusting them with red pepper and then providing watery Tabasco chili sauce does not make a decent side dish.  I thought the Militia Manhattan, with bacon infused Makers Mark was great, although most of the guys at the table wussed out and cried like babies.

I then decided to order dessert, opting for the vegan chocolate peanut butter torte. This was smooth rich chocolately amazingness in my mouth. The service was good as well. Leaf is not the place to go for an inexpensive meal. I spent $25 on dinner, dessert and tip for just myself. I'd also like to see them offer more vegan options.

I always dressed up, loved the subdued and quiet atmosphere, being treated like royalty from the management (especially if it was a birthday or some special occasion), the great food, great service, great views.  It was worth the high price of $120 for dinner for two.   I guess it was time to try it out again!  It can't be -that- different can it??\\n\\nWell, I can now say:  WOW, everyone is right about this place! Tourist trap all the way!\\n\\nMy date and I arrived \\"dressed to the nines\\".

Ok, so we didn't get a window table even though it was requested  weeks in advance.  It was pretty obvious that it's simply first come first serve here... I don't think I really needed to bother with reservations.   \\n\\nFirst three things I noticed right away.  First, it smelled like a cafeteria--you know, like a hospital cafeteria, or a hotel function room where dinner is served... that kind of smell.  Not a good sign!   Second, we were the best dressed people in the place!  There used to be a dress code to get in here, but obviously there is no dress code at all.  Literally jeans and a T-shirt is OK with them!   Third, the atmosphere was more \\"Ground Round\\" then a classy, subdued one.  Loud patrons, screaming kids(?!)   Ugh...this place -must- be under new management...well, at least since 2002. \\n\\nI really should have turned around right there and left, but I did the typical \\"Well, since we are here...\\" rationalization.   The waiter...wow, pure salesman all the way.  Literally spent 2 mins (that's a LOOONG time) giving his spiel about the most expensive entrees and claiming he has been in the business for 15 years.  Oh and this or that is the best entree in the city!  Ha, what a joke!  Then had to listen to the same thing being told to every new customer that came in and sat down near us... ugh!   Real classy!  Ha, imagine his dismay when my date and I get a (relative to this place) inexpensive entree.   Of course, since he knew this was a low cost party, we barely saw him again.\\n  \\nWell, the food, to put it bluntly, was horrible.  I'm talking really, really, really bad!  I'm not exaggerating!  I could have got much tastier chicken at Boston Market for 75% less cost.  Oh well, I kinda knew this would happen.  My date's lasagna was straight from you grocer's freezer.  As soon as we finished we asked for the check.  Desert?  Are you kidding me?   Great, they charge $7 for bottle of water that they don't ever mention you have to pay for.  It's sitting there, they open it and pour it for you...no questions asked.  That's like being charged extra for rolls.  There is no place anywhere that mentions the cost of this bottle of water.  Pretty shady...and I question the legality of it.  But whatever, comes off the tip..tip?  Yes 2% is more than fair!\\n\\nIn conclusion, just don't....ok... don't!  Believe me, I was this place's biggest fan.  It is now obvious there is a new management and/or a new business plan: Upsell upsell upsell!  Let -anyone- in.  Nickel and dime.

My friend got boneless wings with \\"mild sauce\\" aka 2nd degree buffalo. They said they were too spicy to eat. The was a group of guys who sat next yo us at the bar. One if them also got the 2nd degree buffalo sauce in wings and had to send them back because they were too spicy. When we were done we asked for the bill. It took the bartender five minutes to get us the bill because she was talking to other servers who were all standing behind the bar. When she took the credit card for payment she went to the register and stood there and continued her conversation with her coworkers. When this place first opened I read some of the reviews that were bad, but thought it was just because they were new. Obviously they have not improved.

In my mind, his restaurants represent the food of the new South - beautifully-prepared and incredibly satisfying food, rooted deeply in traditional Southern cooking, but styled for the Atlanta yupsters and priced for their ever-growing disposable incomes. \\n\\nEach of Fry's restaurants seems to have a distinct \\"genre\\" - Optimist is seafood, JCT is soul-food/fried-chicken, St Cecilia's is, I think, Italian bistro (haven't been to that one yet). King+Duke is hearty, hearth-cooked, heft. \\n\\nImage-wise, King+Duke is a play on anachronistic irony: it's Melville-meets-the-Hamptons, dusty-library-gone-trendy-chic, shelves full of antiques and old books, walls adorned with modern portraits of classic American authors, tables lit by mini-replicas of oil burning lanterns - all against a backdrop of alternative rock blasting from the speakers and packed full of young Atlanta 20-30somethings dressed in Jcrew and Vineyard Vines.\\n\\nThe centerpiece of this place is a blazing open kitchen with a crackling grill and an incredible old-school hearth, which appears to have inspired the menu: coal-roasted lamb shank and sirloin, bone marrow, and even lobster (yes, lobster that roasts on the open coals and leaves the grill with a disgustingly sexy and mouth-watering char). Even the appetizers and vegetable sides come out in cast-iron pans that did good time in those hearths. \\n\\nSo the other reviews have already raved about the \\"Yorkshire\\" bread that gets served with the meals. I'll rave too. It's good. \\n\\nIt's basically Yorkshire pudding, served as the pre-meal dinner roll. Genius. First restaurant I've been to that does this. Sign me up for more. And the server was kind enough to do that, over and over again, throughout the meal. They come out piping hot (probably also from those hearth ovens) - light, airy, savory and appealingly chewy, ready to sop up the juices from all the proteins you'll want to order.\\n\\nThe octopus appetizer was another amazing dish - thick cuts of octopus, surprisingly tender, perfectly balanced with a tart, acidic tomato caper sauce and sliced potatoes. The only flaw was the small serving, which only made us want more (and for $15, that's what we were expecting). \\n\\nTurnip greens were an interesting take on a southern standard - the roots were halved, roasted, and sitting on a bed of its leaves, which themselves were served whole (not chopped up), marinating in a vinegary sauce. We also had the gnocchi, which was passable. The bone marrow appetizer was the only major disappointment. It came with a short rib marmalade on top, which overpowered the marrow in sweetness and heft, and rendered the marrow indiscernible. \\n\\nSteaks were otherwise hot and satisfying, served with an awesome chimichurri, and some really great fries- nice thick crispy cuts. If you want to go all out, they have \\"The King\\" - which is a huge-ass ribeye served with bone marrow, made for at least two or more, all for $87. The table next to us ordered and split it, and I have to say, it looked pretty darn good. Incidentally, the marrow served with \\"The King\\" appeared to be unadulterated by the short rib that was all over the appetizer. There were no sides (I don't believe) that came with \\"The King,\\" so - caveat emptor.\\n\\nWhile we didn't have room for dessert, the menu seemed full of sweet pudding dishes - butterscotch and toffee - as well as a blondie and brownie served with ice cream - all seemingly satisfying, and likely all made in their hearth ovens - and  all with good mass-appeal (nothing offensive to pickier palates). \\n\\nThis place is perfect on a cold winter day (or any day really) - the ovens will warm you up, the crowd (and blaring music) will energize you, and the food will stick to your bones and keep you insulated and satisfied for a long hibernation. Or for at least until you decide you want seconds (and have saved up enough to do it again).\\n\\nAs an aside - be sure to check out their drink menu. The literary references - like their cocktails - are pretty sweet."},{"name":"Coconut Cafe","address":"759 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome Food!

Yes, the building is old and I guess their claim as the \\"Oldest Restaurant in America\\" is valid, but that doesn't really hold much water.  The food was very basic, almost flavorless and not EVER outstanding, and that's very unfortunate.  \\n\\nI do want to say that the service is very genuine, using older servers who did a very good job, of well, serving.  But the food is so poorly done, it's Sad.  Take my \\"Fish Stew\\" which should be a classic.  Read Boston's famous Chef's book \\"50 Chowders\\" by Jasper White to see what a Fish Stew ought to be.  And wouldn't you expect to find a great Fish Stew at the Union Oyster House?  I specifically Googled it before to make sure they had Fish Stew, and they did.  Only it turned out to be a horrible attempt, not even trying to be great in any way.  What was served was a thick concoction of potato chowder, little flavor, topped in the center with some white fish pieces.  REALLY???  I ate the fish portions and left the rest.  Really Sad.\\n\\nOn a brighter note, my companion had their Lobster Salad, and it looked quite good I have to say.  It was worth the price because it did contain a good amount of Lobster meat.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my selection of Fried Oysters turned out to be one of the worst meals I've ever had.  You'd think \\"an Oyster House\\" would serve a great Oyster Entree.  Think again.  Instead of plump fresh oysters hand breaded in very light crumbs, you receive a thick coating of bread surrounding a tiny piece of oyster.  I never really got an oyster flavor in the few bites I attempted to eat.  I left half of the order on my plate.\\n\\nI normally would not order Baked Beans as a specific side dish, but being in Boston, I wanted to see how this dish would taste like, assuming that it would be really tasty.  Again, think again.  I could be wrong, but I suspect it was just from a can of Baked Beans somewhere.  Open the can, heat it up, and voile'.  So disappointing.\\n\\nAs our lunch was ending, the place was filling up.  People like me always seem to give it a try even though we've read the same very poor reviews again and again.  Instead of having a bite here, I'd suggest sticking your head in the door to see America's Oldest Restaurant (really not very much to see anyway), then head elsewhere for a good meal.

The valet lot that parks for Wisteria and Il Localino also provides parking for Folk Art.  Also, the decor inside is fantastic - lots to look at but not overwhelming.  The bench seats in the booths, however, get fairly uncomfortable after a bit. \\n\\nDrinks: We started with a round of mimosas - lovely although they add apple bitters which wasn't what we were expecting - delicious, but caught us by surprise.  I also had a What's Up Doc which was light, refreshing and the carrot juice really shined.  One of my dining mates also had a glass of sparkling white wine which she said was nice.\\n\\nFood: We all opted for egg dishes - myself, the crab eggs benedict - sauce on the side (really good although a bit bread-y for this often gluten-free girl - and I would recommend sauce on the side for this - if they had poured it on, it would have been way too rich); one woman had the sausage omelet (although you wouldn't know she had more than grits the way she was RAVING about them); and, the other ordered the fungi omelet (which she said was delicious).

The burger was cooked really well, was falling apart a little bit but I like it that way. Wouldn't be a stretch to say they were cooked perfectly. My issue was with the flavor. The meat itself was almost tasteless and the toppings, save for the fresh jalepenos, added little to nothing to the burger. The meat just wasn't seasoned or the flavor may have been cooked out of it but it was very disappointing. \\n\\nThe sweet potato fries were great, crinkle cut and some of the best I've had in recent memory.

However, I have been here countless times and I have never had a bad experience unless you count the time that I didn't heed the server's warning that the fra diavolo was super duper spicy that day (I didn't have a stomach lining for days after).\\n\\nI went there last night with some fellow gay Yelpers for what we called the Big Gay Shit Show, a bar crawl hitting all the gay bars in Boston. When we decided that sustenance would be needed, I suggested Anchovies, to which the two guys that have never been said sounded cool, but the other that was familiar with the place said, \\"I love Anchovies!\\" It was decided. I will also add that I had dim sum early that afternoon with the same person and we were already talking about the Italian nachos.\\n\\nOur server was the so adorable and personable Mike and he was a sweetheart (seriously people, if he had not said he was working until 3 in the morning we would have jotted down a number and asked him to meet us later on into our bar crawl). He could have totally screwed everything up and I think we still would have been OK with it, but he didn't. Actually he gave us great service was quick and efficient and he just let us do our own thing.\\n\\nI have never had anything that I did not enjoy here (except the fra diavolo since that was just way over the top of the spicy scale). They are consistent. The Italian nachos are a must. They actually take a pile of tortilla chips and top them with bolognese sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, and banana peppers. So freaking good. I bounce all over the place when it comes to what I eat here. Whether you settle on a salad, sandwich, pasta, or other entree, you really can't go wrong. Last night I had the chicken parmesan and substituted the bolognese sauce instead of the marinara and my dining companion that had been there before overheard and copied me. We both agreed that was the way to go. I wouldn't call the bolognese authentic, but it is pretty darn tasty and complemented the dish much more than their marinara. This visit I also tried the pesto on the salad, it tasted great and was different than just an everyday dressing.\\n\\nGenerous portions, reasonable prices, a great staff, a decent beer and wine list (although I really do hate when places serve wine in glasses that are so small they have to fill them to the top to give you a serving, but I won't be a snob), a good liquor selection, and consistency are what you are going to get here. Sure it is dark, cramped, and dingy in here, almost like you are eating in Paul Revere's refinished basement if it was refinished in the 50s, but it is a welcome respite from a lot of the stuck up restaurants in the area.

The food selections for the night are as follows:\\n\\nMyself: BBQ Plate - pulled pork, mac n' cheese, potato salad, with Carolina Gold sauce.\\n\\nWife: Grilled Cheese, Cheese, Cheese w/fries\\n\\nDaughter: Kids Grilled Cheese w/fruit\\n\\nThe Good: \\nImmediately upon entering the restaurant, your mouth starts watering due to the incredible smells coming from the kitchen. The remodel from the old Howards was incredible and you could barely tell (from the inside) that it used to be another restaurant. It was too cold, but there appears to be horseshoes outside, as well as I've heard they're adding corn hole during the warmer months. This should make it a fun place to go with a family and hang out. The staff was also very friendly and smiling all the time. It appears as if they hired much of the old Howards staff back, which keeps this feeling like a local restaurant. Food wise, the Carolina Gold sauce was tasty with a little bit of a kick. \\n\\nThe Bad: \\nThere's not enough room to accommodate a 30 minute wait. There are two small benches and the standing room makes things jumbled for people to enter. I'm sure things will be better during the warmer months where you can go outside and wait. It also appears as if they serve ALL of their drinks in plastic cups. I understand that's to keep glass out from the sandy outside areas, but sitting at a table it is awkward to see my wife's wine served in a plastic cup. The potato salad had little flavor and the mac n' cheese looked better on the menu than it actually tasted. The fries were also nothing special.\\n\\nThe Ugly:\\nI went on a Friday night and there was a 30 minute wait, which is to be expected for a weekend. However, a 30 minute wait while staring at 3-4 empty tables for 10 minutes is ridiculous. Once seated, we had an older lady as our server who was quite nice, but didn't appear comfortable with how busy the restaurant was on a Friday night. After we ordered, we sat awkwardly for 45+ minutes waiting for our food. After several apologies from our server about the kitchen being backed up, which I believed since I saw here pacing back and forth looking at the kitchen, our food finally arrived. My wife's grilled cheese looked as if it had 3 different kinds of sliced cheese stacked on top of each other, warmed up, and then served....and it tasted like it. My daughter's grilled cheese was awful to the point that she wouldn't touch it (which is saying something coming from my daughter). The \\"fruit\\" was a cheap Dole fruit cup, not fresh fruit like I expected. Besides the sauce, the BBQ was nowhere near being worth the 45+ minute wait. NOW THE BIG PROBLEM! THE ONLINE MENU DOES NOT MATCH THE ACTUAL RESTAURANT MENU. My wife is a vegetarian and they advertised a black bean burger on their online menu, as well as other burgers. When I asked our server about them, she stated they used to have them, but now they don't. The restaurant has only been open 2-3 weeks and they've already changed the menu?!?!?!\\n\\nOverall: \\nI'll revisit the restaurant in about 6 months to see if they worked the kinks out that should've been fixed within the first week or so of being open. But as it stands now, you'll get better BBQ from Jim N' Nicks and Ebony and Ivory (hard to beat them taste wise). From start to finish, we spent over 2 hours in the restaurant."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yum, I love this place.

Look, it's a trend that sometimes pays off, that's all.  Just remember: when you feel the siren call of gastronomical responsibility and elitism, you have to DO something GOOD with GOOD ingredients to get GOOD food.  Just saying. \\n\\nI was lucky enough to be dining with 5 others (total of 3 couples), so I was able to try 3 different appetizers and 3 entrees.  (Boys don't share with the table, you know)  \\n\\nFirst, we tried the Sauteed Mushroom appetizer.  Served in a clear coffee mug with a spoon, the Crimini mushrooms in garlic oil were nothing to complain about.  The mushrooms were the perfect texture, piping hot and flavorful.  I couldn't help thinking, however, that I could easily have made this at home and that it felt more like an ingredient than a dish in itself.  Not bad, but certainly not 7-dollars-good.\\n\\nOne companion ordered the Bistro Fries with a Duo of Sauces.  The fries were just right: steamy and fluffy on the inside, crispy and flavorful on the outside.  These were the sort of fries that you just want to continuously shovel into your mouth.  Then you are reminded by the artful presentation of the accompanying grown-up sauces that you ought to savor each fry individually.  The first sauce is a spicy ketchup.   It was a sharp burn, one that then lingers pleasantly.  The other sauce was a white truffle sauce.  Frankly, it was bland.  I don't recall detecting much of the earthy, satisfying truffle flavor I was expecting.  Overall an easy way to start the meal, though.\\n\\nBy far, the biggest disappointment of the evening was my choice of entree, the Peanut Butter and Jelly Duck. The dish was described as duck breast served with thai peanut noodles, cabernet demi-glace and fresh berries.  Taken in by the whimsical name and my craving for duck, I had high hopes for this creative sounding dish.  After being assured the duck would come out medium rare, my plate arrived with 4 or 5 artfully sliced rubbery duck-pucks.  Now, the waiter could not have been more accommodating.  He immediately put in a new order and, having overheard me exclaiming over the house-made gravlox on my companion's plate, brought out a heaping plate of it while I waited.  It made no difference, this dish was just terrible.  The mushy noodles tasted like they were drowned in an entire jar of cheap peanut butter.  And that was it.  You could not taste anything else.  I fished out some shriveled-up strawberries (I think) and even they tasted like Jiffy.  What a great idea for duck, what a lamentable execution.  I separated off the now perfectly cooked duck and ate just that.  It was good.  \\n\\nThere were a couple of near-wins, however.  My date's 'Salmon Three Ways' was not entirely disappointing:  DELICIOUS gravlox, boring filet, predictable salmon cake.  A friend's hummus plate was both refreshing and satisfying.  \\n\\nI'll go back again.  One meal does not a reputation make.  So far, however, this restaurant is overrated."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"LOVE this place!  It's so tiny and elegant.

I was not disappointed at all with that decision, although I think it weighed a little on my conscious that I had consumed the meat of three separate animals in one meal. Sorry, vegetarians. The truffle parmesan fries that accompanied them were decent, and I really liked their house made ketchup.\\n\\nOther than the food aspect, I was pleasantly surprised by how cool the interior of the restaurant is, and our server (I really need to start remembering names so I can give props) was very friendly and helped guide us through the menu with suggestions.

Situated in a strip mall along the International Corridor (i.e., Bethel Road), Min Ga is warm, inviting, and authentic. The d√©cor is minimal, and the service is slower-paced, as is typical of most Korean restaurants - and if you have questions, they are more than happy to help you sort out what you're looking for.\\n\\nKorean food is comforting, with lots of meat-and-tofu rich stews and soups, fried rice and noodle dishes, and of course, big plates of just beef (bulgogi) or pork (kalbi). In addition, there is the bi bim bop, a big ol' mess of rice, veggies, protein and sauce all topped with an egg and served sizzling from the oven. Min Ga's appetizers are as varied as their dishes, but my favorites are the seafood pancake and the Korean roll (a sushi roll with bulgogi and crab inside, what's not to like). On this visit, I got soon dae guk, a noodle stew with pork belly, spam, soon dae (a Korean sausage) and tofu. When it came out, there was a piece of cheese on top - most unusual for Asian and certainly for Korean. I went with it, but am not sure if it enhanced the stew, which was otherwise delicious. My companion had beef jeongol, which is a \\"casserole\\" of items cooked together and served with a spicy broth. Also, this was delicious. Korean restaurants also serve small dishes of various kitchen sides - moonflower, kimchi, seaweed salad, mung sprouts - called ban chan. Min Ga's tend to be sourer and less sweet. The seaweed salad this time had a gelatinous element that was not exactly unpleasant, but instead of tasting brine, you got a taste of...nothing.\\n\\nIf you're looking to branch out into Korean cuisine, Min Ga is a wonderful introduction. They are down to earth, but authentic with their recipes and happy to help you have a great first time with your food."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I lived in Beacon Hill for five years and Paramount was the go-to place for hang-over induced binge breakfasts. People are often intimidated by their seating policy that has you stand in line to order your food and THEN sit. Many times I've seen people walk away in horror, \\"Look at that liiine!\\" or all-out freak from the line, \\"ohmygod ohmygod we're never going to get a table\\". You do. You will. Chiiiil out. \\n\\nBy some twisted luck there is always a table emptying as you pay for your food. The breakfast is worth the line too. Paramount's portions are far better than the other Beacon Hill breakfast joints. My trick if you're in a rush? Call in your order from outside. Then you can just skip the line, grab and go! \\n\\nIt's also a nice place for a casual date dinner. It's dimly lit with little white candles on each table. I like to sit at the tall tables and watch the cooks in action. \\n\\nThe only negative for me is that, aside from occasional specials, their menu hasn't changed.

I mean I know it is only 40 minutes from my house, but I want to stay here!\\nI love the architecture and all of the exposed wood beams in the ceiling.  The check in desk was so adorably tiny.  There was a beautiful courtyard and the first words out of my mouth were, \\"What a beautiful spot to get married.\\"  We walked further down the corridor and guess what?  They were setting up for a wedding.  \\nWe checked in at the restaurant and were promptly seated at the center of the restaurant.  The menu was breakfast, not brunch.  I think we were too early.  It didn't matter because all the stuff I had picked out via yelp was on the breakfast menu.  Now because we were there so early there was no Bloody Mary bar, but neither of us drink those anyway, so no big loss there.  \\nWe ordered the corned beef burrito and the French toast.  Our intention was to share as we do with many meals.  Our waiter knew that we were going to share so he actually had the kitchen divide each and served us each the 1/2 portion.  It was totally unnecessary, but extremely thoughtful.  \\nthe corned beef burrito was awesome.  I loved it and would definitely order it again if I came here for breakfast.  Flavorful meat, well cooked eggs, a little bit of hot sauce, and a fresh tortilla.  I wouldn't have minded a little more hot sauce, but that is just because I really like spicy food and this could easily be corrected with a dash of Cholula.  \\nThe French toast here was also amazing.  It had fresh berries and the richest of whip cream.  It was made with brioche and was so delicious that syrup was completely unnecessary.  \\nOur service here was fantastic.  One of the servers carried on quite the conversation with my boyfriend regarding superheroes, which greatly entertained us.  He was wearing a Captain America shirt.  \\nAlso the prices were very reasonable for breakfast.  As I said we do brunch pretty much every Sunday and this is one of the few locations where brunch for the 2 of us was under $35.

Why should we fund your lack of enough parking spaces, especially since the valets that we would be paying for could also be used by restaurant patrons?  So we got turned over to a girl named Alexis. I also turned over the details to another committee member. Big mistake on my part had I known what was to come. Alexis was hard to reach, more of an order taker, no ideas or details. And get this no valet on the day of our event. This is where the disaster began. We have many older employees and  some had to walk and fend for themselves from blocks away. We had a buffet. The food was dry and over cooked. The side orders were wrong, the type of salad was wrong. Todd always had our salad served individually by stressing this was a classy touch for a nice holiday party. This year not only was the salad wrong but we had to get it at the buffet. I also found the venue to be getting old and worn out looking - dirty elevator, wrinkled linens with spots on them, stained carpeting.

Fianc√© loves Brussel sprouts and got their Brussel sprout salad which was nothing impressive and again overpriced for the portion size. Lamb shank was incredibly tender but the flavorless mashed potatoes and unseasoned zucchini ruined the entree for me. How hard is it to slightly season the vegetables? He had a seared duck with risotto which was not cooked well and was a disappointment, way too many cherries in the risotto which ruined what little flavor there was otherwise. Service was poor. Everyone around us was given bread and butter and we were not offered. Server rushed us to either finish our bottle of wine or let the him take it away and put in a bag for us to take it home.

There were only a few tables occupied but our server was out of sight, so I needed to ask another server to refill hot water for my tea pot but unfortunately, he threw away the tea bag and gave me a pot of hot water when he returned. Our server came to us when we asked for the bill, then she disappeared again.  So we needed to ask the host to bring us back with some change.  Our server brought us back the change and she said the amount out loud.  It was odd and rude.  I don't know why she did that because usually the servers would just give you back the change without telling you the amount of change.  The server who threw away my tea bag did come back to our table and apologize, but he should not apologize; our server should.  It was all our server's fault - if our server had always checked on our table, I wouldn't need to talk to another server and therefore, my pot of tea would not become a pot of hot water. Also, our server was supposed to bring back the topping of my salad which was missing; but she told another staff to do it instead.

After passing up De Novo for our anniversary in early April, my boyfriend and I made reservations for his birthday at the end of the month. I must say, we made a huge mistake choosing a different restaurant for our anniversary!\\n\\nThe decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is super modern, without being at all cold or off-putting. It was trendy and I loved the Tiffany-blue accents throughout the place. From the moment we entered and were (promptly!) seated I felt comfortable and at ease. Enter our wonderful server, Sean. He was attentive, personable, and honest in his recommendations of drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert. I also really appreciated that he knelt down next to our table, as the booths are quite low, to chat and take our order.\\n\\nFor drinks, my boyfriend had his go-to Old Fashioned and enjoyed it. My choice was a Kentucky Mule,  out of character for myself as I generally do not order whiskey-based cocktails yet it was refreshing and light. Perfect for the warm spring evening.\\n\\nThe pacing of the meal was on point; as we were finishing up the warm rolls with garlic butter, our Lobster Mac and Cheese appetizer arrived at the table. While our server warned us that it was quite pricey, we saw the huge pieces of lobster included in the dish and were very happy with our choice. The cheese sauce was much lighter than it could have been, and very delicious.\\n\\nAs the main courses, I ordered the Double Bone Pork Chop and my boyfriend had the Chilean Sea Bass. The menu quotes a 45 minute wait for the pork, but it arrived at our table somewhere around 35 minutes later, a surprise I appreciated. My meat was perfectly prepared and the herb butter atop it complimented it wonderfully. The bread pudding included was a great mix of sweet and savory and it completed the dish very well. My boyfriend stated that the sea bass was the best prepared fish he had ever had, and upon tasting it I had to concur.\\n\\nWhile ordering dessert, I casually let it slip we were there for a birthday celebration, and Sean responded by bringing a candle in the creme brulee. We also ordered raspberry chip ice cream with godiva liquor poured over it at Sean's suggestion. My boyfriend ordered an espresso which complimented the dishes well. Each dessert was light and tasty. I left feeling full, but not stuffed. It was perfect.\\n\\nThe only negative part of our meal was when the check came, we received another table's items along with our own. Sean fixed it as soon as we pointed it out, and it did not detract anything from the overall experience.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend De Novo for a night out with friends or for a romantic evening to celebrate a special occasion. From the food to the service we were very impressed and much happier after this meal than after our anniversary dinner. In fact, the wonderful experience at De Novo was my inspiration to (finally) create an account and leave a review.

Like those are going stay put. The over worked paint scheme on the walls and the mismatched lights just do not say class. It says Home Depot paint technique's class. I appreciate that original art pieces are used but, they don't help. \\n\\nFor dinner:  really liked the choices of hot and cold small plates. Had a nice malbec to start. I had the shrimp tempura small plate, the crab cakes small plate and the French fries with the triple smoked ketchup (they are really proud of this) and my companion had the sea bass (again really proud of that also).

The mustard sauce didn't add anything. \\n\\nThe fries were good and I did like the smoked ketchup. \\n\\nOn the plus side, when my companion asked for a top-shelf vodka they didn't have, someone ran up the street to the liquor store and got one.  \\n\\nThere seemed to be two restaurants here.

I'm pretty easy to please, with a tendency toward both hyperbole and letting recent experiences totally overshadow those of the past, but with that caveat, these three meals at Andina have been among the best I've had in Portland, if not MY ENTIRE LIFE. I've picked and nibbled at so many of their dishes that they blur together, but they've all been uniformly delicious. The one thing we absolutely get every time is the 5 Elementos ceviche, which apparently varies depending on what's fresh, but each time it's been the highlight of a meal where the bar is already very, very high. The dipping sauces for the bread are also seriously delicious. While the plates don't look super huge, sharing a couple of appetizers and a dessert with the table and splitting an entree with my girlfriend left me perfectly full, and getting my own entree in the past has always led to a meal-sized portion of (awesome) leftovers. But plan carefully if you're going out afterward and don't want to have to toss out delicious food.\\n\\nThis last time we sat at a table in the middle of the bar area, which I initially feared was going to be cramped and claustrophobic, but wound up being just tight enough to make it feel like we were in the heart of a jumping South American neighborhood and not at all uncomfortable. (The live music and sangria helped.) \\n\\nThe only head scratcher is why the entry hall / front door / stairway layout is so impractical - servers are coming and going with stacks of chairs and plates of drinks, while people waiting for tables or trying to check out the posted menus are creating constantly shifting human traffic jams. It's like a Benny Hill physical comedy routine, and it looks so unpleasant for the staff that I'm mystified as to why they haven't added a second door or put up an awning outside or something.

My friend finally asked the hostess what the deal was, and she said that our table STILL wasn't ready, but if we wanted to sit in the bar area (full menu is served there), we could. We said we'd look at the table and then decide. It was a low table with a couch and 2 chairs. We decided it was fine, as we were starving and who knew when \\"our\\" table would be ready. Another big mistake. We were in a prime spot in the bar/lounge area for people who wanted to use our table and chairs as their coat rack, butt balance spot, etc. Pretty sweet dining experience for a \\"fine dining\\" establishment, right? \\n\\nWhile our server was perfectly nice, and she tried when she could, it was clear that things beyond her grip were spiraling out of control. The order that we got things was so out of whack, it made no sense. We got our appetizers before our drinks, yet we had no silverware or other common table items (salt and pepper). I asked for my salad a certain way, it was made wrong, then brought back with just the item in question missing. As my friend said, you could see the outline of the item I requested to be left off still on the rest of the plate. What if I had an allergy? Either way, what terrible service (this time for the lazy kitchen staff). When I immediately realized that this was the same salad (as the server admitted it), I asked for a new salad. What did I get this time? 6 leaves of plain lettuce on a plate. No dressing. I find it offensive that that is how their kitchen team let a plate leave the kitchen. My request was not so outrageous in the first place. At this point, I just wanted to eat and high-tail it out of there, so I just politely asked for more dressing. By the time I got it, my friend was done with her appetizer and our entrees arrived at the table moments later.\\n\\nThe food was fine, nothing to rave about. Why were there so many shaved carrots, or whatever they were, on top of every item? It really was too much, and took away from what might have been otherwise enjoyable dishes.\\n\\nWhile it was very nice that the manager paid for our first round of drinks for making us wait even though we had a reservation, I honestly could not believe that no one acknowledged the 3x screw up with my salad. I'm guessing that the girl who brought the salad just never told our server. Either way, it was uncomfortable, and made for a very less than pleasurable dining experience. This meal set my friend and I back about $170 total, which is NOT CHEAP. I am appalled that this JOKE of a place overcharges so highly for awful, pathetic service and food.\\n\\nSo, that brings me to the reason I'm writing this review. I know, like all of that wasn't enough. At first, I actually decided not to put them on blast publicly and contact them privately to try and make it right. I sent a thoughtful email about my experience, and received a response from the General Manager, Richard Brackett (richard@the-bancroft.com). He acknowledged that they had dropped the ball on my experience, and he wanted to make it right. He offered to send me something to make up for it. I gave him my address. A month goes by, nothing comes. I write him another email. He claims he sent it out immediately, and said he was sending out a replacement immediately. Another 3 weeks has gone by, I live ONE TOWN over, and I have received nothing. The whole dining experience in the restaurant was offensive enough, then to insult me by LYING about \\"making it right\\"?\\n\\nRichard Brackett, General Manager of The Bancroft  Ph 781-221-2100, Richard@the-bancroft.com -you have a lot to learn about how to treat guests who are paying good, hard-earned money.

Because, in my limited experience, beignets are tiny morsels of deliciousness that you'll pay anywhere from $3 to $5 for.

The waitstaff is pretty good, the menu looks good, but most of the food is poorly executed.\\n\\nOkay, so for the play by play:  My lady and I came for dinner around 7:00 and were seated immediately.  I'd say the place was 60-75% full and seemed like no shortage of waiters.  Beer prices are not outrageous but a bit on the high side considering most of the food came on disposable plastic dishes.  We ordered the appetizer of fried, pickled vegetables, and entree platters consisting of ribs, pastrami, pulled pork, and chopped brisket with sides of green beans, brussels sprouts, and collards/kale.\\n\\nThe appetizer came out reasonably quick and was actually very good.  It consisted of fried pickle chips, whole pickled okra, and slices \\"sweet\\" peppers.  I say \\"sweet\\" because that's how they are labeled on the menu but they definitely have a kick.  I like spicy food and I would say they were closer to jalape√±o than cherry pepper and were a bit much for my wife.  They were slightly on the greasy side but nothing terrible compared to other fried pickles I've eaten.  Overall one of the high points of the meal.\\n\\nSo then we waited...and waited, until after a few apologies and approximately 45 minutes (from the appetizer being cleared) we received our bbq platters, albeit missing 2 of the sauces we had requested and giving me one that I didn't ask for (more on that later).  First, 45 minutes?! this is BBQ we're talking about here.  Everything is cooked hours ahead of time.  This better be some amazing BBQ...but it's not.  To top it off, all of the meats were lukewarm at best, with some spots being downright cold.  Temperature aside, I really liked the pastrami.  It was totally unique and was nice and smokey.  The ribs were average to mediocre.  My wife eats ribs everywhere and for her money, Fox Bros baby backs are the standard in town and she said Crafty Hog is maybe 50% as good, even going so far to say Jim'n'Nicks ribs are better (they are surprisingly good, and cheese muffins!).  The chopped brisket had potential, but my portion was EXTREMELY fatty.  I would say I left 30% pure fat of the total volume on the plate, and some of the very lean pieces were dry because of it.  However there were a few pieces that had that perfect distribution and they show the potential of this place.  For comparison's sake, my gold standard of brisket in Atlanta is Heirloom Market BBQ and this place isn't even close but they could easily make a few improvements just in butchery that would get them competing.  Finally the pork...poor pork.  It was beyond dry and barely warm.  It didn't taste bad or anything, it was just unmemorable.  In an area so ripe with great BBQ, they really need to step their game up if they want to compete.  The sides...Brussels Sprouts were very tasty and again, unique among BBQ joints.  Collards/Kale were somewhat bland but okay.  Green Beans tasted like standard canned/stewed beans, nothing special.\\n\\nBut what about the sauces, you say?  Well, my wife ordered the sweet and the mustard, and I ordered the mustard and the vinegar.  When the plates arrived, we appeared to both have only 1 sauce and it was the sweet one.  Once informed, the food runner promptly brought back the mustard sauce and the vinegar...or was it?  I checked and it was very thick and sweet...it tasted almost identical to the sweet sauce.  I talked with the waitress who left and returned with two more sauces, both of which looked like the same sweet sauce.  It turns out that \\"the sauce was mixed wrong\\" and that the sweet sauce got mixed into the vinegar sauce.  And this is where you really lose me.  What self-respecting restaurant mis-mixes one of their signature sauces, and then continues to serve the bad sauce even when they know it's wrong?  For one thing, I hate sweet sauces and I would bet most others who order the vinegar sauce are doing so because they don't like the sweet...so passing that garbage off to the people who like vinegar-based sauces is just an insult.  Okay, so now that that's off my chest, the 'sweet' sauce was no better than a good bottled sauce (like Sweet Baby Ray's).  The one shining star was the mustard sauce.  It was unconventional for a mustard sauce but that's okay.  I'm used to a thinner mustard sauce but this one was thicker, more like a traditional sauce.  It had a sweetness but also a nice mustard flavor that countered it.  Knowing how good this was actually makes me more upset that i didn't get to try the true vinegar based sauce.\\n\\nOther side notes, the inside is like a nice \\"sports bar\\" vibe with plenty of screens to watch an event and a semi-separate bar.  It's weird paradox with the plastic dishes and trays.  Overall I'm super disappointed however I will give them one more chance since I live maybe half a mile and I want to try the turkey among others.

And there was one thing that I was always interested in--what's the best thing to eat around here? With this attitude, I found the best that each city had to offer. From Seattle to New York, from San Francisco to DC, I had eaten at them all. But one major city never crossed my path, one city had always eluded me. Until now.\\n\\nBoston is known for many things, but a recurring theme is seafood. Which makes sense, since as a coastal city there's easy access to the sea. Thus, seafood. Kind of self-explanatory.\\n\\nOne popular place is the Union Oyster House right off the North End? It may have a reputation as a tourist trap, but it's popularity is well deserved. It's a multi-level establishment with a small casual bar on the first floor and a tightly clustered arrangement of rooms on the second, each lined with a series of booths along the wall. I was a fan of the dark and claustrophobic interior, as it added to the old-world charm of the place.\\n\\nThe food was good, but not quite extra-ordinary. After being seated at our table, we were served cornbread, which was a pleasant surprise. I liked the cornbread a lot, and having it for free was an extra bonus. The clam chowder was creamier than I would have liked, and it certainly was not the best clam chowder I've had, but it wasn't a disappointment either. We also ordered a few oysters and slurped down their fresh and juicy goodness, but I'm not sure whether that reflects more on the establishment or the farm from which they came. The fried crab cakes and the lobster cakes that we had were better than expected, although they were both a little small, and I found myself craving for more.\\n\\nAll in all, the Union Oyster House doesn't disappoint . All too often, tourism restaurants take advantage of their reputation to serve lower quality food to the masses--after all, tourists aren't repeat customers. I'm glad that wasn't the case here.

The street kids started yelling at the customer, saying he shouldn't bring his dog in there, and theirs was a service dog. The man holding the small dog didn't say anything, just pulled out a lanyard he had around his neck to show that actually, HIS was the service dog. I really doubt the street kids' pitbull was a service dog that just randomly viciously attacks other people's dogs. The worst part?

The roll is very soft, and there is an ample amount of cheese, the eggs were cooked to a perfect over-easy, and the bacon seemed freshly cooked (not the out of a box pre-cooked garbage), but still crispy.\\n\\nThe fresh squeezed OJ was also excellent.\\n\\nThe storefront is not particularly inviting, but i would not pass up an opportunity to grab breakfast here."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"New location not nearly as freakishly cool as the old, but still a one of a kind joint!\\n\\nLots of strange, however tasty, treats in here.

Particularly the crab cake; so tasty. \\n\\nSo far, everything are excellent including the warm buns. When the tomahawk steak arrived, we were surprised to see there was so much fat in the steak. I understand that the tomahawk steak is a rib eye steak and should have some fat in it, but the amount of fat we ended up cutting out from the steak could have filled a third of one of their plates. I couldn't tell how much the total fat weighed, but it looked like it was about 1/3 of the meat we got out from the steak.  Considering this is their signature dish, I was very disappointed in it. I agree that the meat and the way it was cooked is very good, but the excessive amount of fat in the steak took away my appreciation of the dish.

So a group of seven had to wait for 1 single person, we all kinda crowded around the bar to try to get out of the way. Seemed silly but it's their restaurant so I rolled with it. Took us a good bit to get a drink menu as it seemed like there was only one of two for the whole bar. We finally got seated. I ordered my drink and it came out fairly quickly. Drink was different taste wise and super spicy. Once seated I needed a water to wash it down. Everyone in our group pretty much ordered the lobster macaroni/ fried chicken and greens. Lobster macaroni was great! One co worker in our group's chicken was pink inside and she pushed it back saying it was undercooked then the server kinda got sassy with my coworker saying it was just the seasoning, we all ordered the same thing and no one else had under cooked chicken. She tried to give her back the undercooked chicken and then the manager I believe came over and asked how she wanted this to go and she was like it's pink and clearly undercooked just bring me a new piece, once she received her food everyone else was pretty much done. After that the service kinda went down hill, as another larger group was placed near by us. We were all over it at this point. Lastly, a coworker got her leftovers boxed up. They take your food away to box it, which makes me nervous. The next day when she goes to eat her leftovers she finds a piece of chewed gum in her to go box. Just gross! I think maybe go as a couple, as I'm not sure if their service staff can handle more than three people at the table. Overall food was tasty but not worth the price or experience.

The Bresaola was a favorite of our table. All the meats tasted fresh. I would love to come back just for a charcuterie/cheese board. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich ($15). The sandwich was OK. The portions for their sandwiches and salads are pretty small which wasn't an issue since we got the huge board to start off with. But, I can see leaving here hungry if I only ordered an entree. \\n\\nFood prep is slow. The charcuterie board took well over 30 minutes after ordering to arrive and my entree perhaps an hour.

A solitary server stood smiling behind the counter full of wonderfully varied pizza pies gleaming at us in the cozy atmosphere in the small shop. All the different types of pizzas looked extremely appetizing in their own ways, but my friend and I settled for a couple that looked particularly delectable. I was a bit shocked when the server took out HUGE \\"slices\\" of pizza for each of our orders, which were more like blocks of pizza, and were only around $5-6 each.\\n\\nMy friend really enjoyed this one pizza that had some arugula on it with some kind sweet almost vegetable-y topping, perhaps just because it was surprisingly sweet and not as savory. I didn't care for it as much. The meatball and ricotta one was superb. However my personal favorite was hands down the mushroom and garlic aoili. Every mushroom was so fleshy and juicy, and had that perfect amount of umami mushroom flavor. Each bite of the pizza was an amazingly sensuous experience and chewing through so perfectly juicy mushroom densely packed together was just divine. Oh and the aoili was also very delicious. Usually I have to get some type of meat on my pizzas but the next time I'm definitely going to get the mushroom again!\\n\\nDefinitely try out this place if you're in the area and want some good pizza for pretty cheap.

The bread was fresh and the fruit spreads were sweet and tasty. We split a strawberry and cream cheese croissant and a chocolate croissant. The croissants here are amazing, a little pricey but they are worth it...fresh, flaky, and delicious. I was informed they run out of these halfway through brunch, so order these first! My group ordered the waffle plate, egg salad tartine, chicken salad tartine, a tuna salad tartine and a smoked salmon. The waffle was crispy, airy and the perfect level of sweetness. The tartines also didn't dissappoint, and I really enjoyed the chicken salad, and the egg salad. The portions are perfect for brunch but since we ordered the bread basket and the croissants, we were stuffed.\\n\\nDrinks: The mimosas are a great price at brunch, $4 for a pint glass and $2 for a single. We went with the pints and ordered 2 pomegranate and 2 lavender. The pomegranate ones were great and you could tell the ratio of champagne to juice was perfect (more champagne than juice). The lavender mimosas were interesting...the sip was refreshing but after that I felt like I was drinking a lavender candle...will be avoiding this in the future. \\n\\nOverall, it's a cute place for brunch, the service was prompt, other than one waiter, the rest of them were very nice and helpful and the food was great.

It was the first time there for both of us, and it was absolutely the right place for a girly light meal.  It's a small place, with a country French ambiance that's inviting and not at all stuffy.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful without being overbearing.  My friend and I shared the mimosas for 2, which was a pleasant way to begin the meal without the relative heaviness of wine or beer.  The mimosas weren't too diluted, although I wouldn't have complained if they were stronger.  I ordered the chicken salad tartine.  Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I thought the chicken salad was excellent - not too gloopy, and the pine nuts and dried cranberries helped it taste more upscale without being weird or pretentious.  The artisan bread it was served on was fresh and tasted homemade.  My only suggestion was that  a small bowl of fruit or serving of pommes frites might have helped made it a more robust meal - although I could have ordered soup or salad with my sandwich if I were really hungry.  That said, it was the perfect place to go if you don't want to eat something heavy or greasy.  The flavors are clean and simple (in a good way).

Just to warn you if she comes back again, she's definitely not as good as she thinks she is...but it made the wait a little more interesting.\\n\\nWhen I finally made it in, I ordered 3 doughnuts:\\nBacon Maple Bar ($3): arguably the doughnut Voodoo is most famous for.

The cream was light and delicious, but the chocolate layer on top proved to be too sweet for me. I had to scrape it off to finish.\\n\\nLemon Chantilly Cruller ($1.40): the crullers here are really good. This one was also covered in frosting, but since I saved it for later, most of the frosting came off on the paper I'd wrapped it in. Only then did I think I was good. The actual cruller was light with a perfect texture.\\n\\nPrices are fair. Not cheap, but not overly expensive.\\n\\nOverall, I think the doughnuts here have too much frosting.

I've had my fair share of bistro-ey tartines at Le Pan Quo- (http://www.lepainquotidien.com).  \\n\\nSo here is my take on the perfect \\"tartine\\": Small and simple, but tasty and satisfying, like the mating of a favorite savory and a sandwich.  So while I was expecting a lighter lunch, I was hoping for some serious yum.  I got exactly the opposite.  A really big and heavy lunch (mostly of bread) and a little yum.   While the corn and potato chowder was hearty, flavor-wise it was pretty forgettable.  On the tartine side, I was the only one of four of us that chose wisely.  The chicken salad tartine is tasty, and large enough  for a big appetite, but the plating was a little off.  The bread slices are so big that they almost didn't fit on the sandwich board.  There was no room for garnish so it was crammed in the cracks between bread slices.  And from looking at the shabby chic decor of the place, detail is obviously important on some level.  So it was just confusing that the tartines were presented so haphazardly.\\n\\nBut back to the other, less fortunate, tartines.  One got the tuna salad, that was the driest sandwich on earth.  Only after heavily dousing the thing in olive oil was one able to take a bite and have enough moisture in your mouth to fully masticate and form a food bolus for passing along the digestive tract.  The turkey tartine was flat out insulting.  Would you offer your mother a turkey sandwich that was only bread with one slice of deli-meat turkey?  But by far the worst was the shrimp and avocado tartine.  You know, a part of me was almost thinking they had run out of shrimp, because the tartine came with only 1 shrimp per huuuuge slice of bread.  And the avocado on it was spread so thinly, that you could only see it form certain angles, let alone even attempt to taste it.  Actually the tartine had no taste at all.\\n\\nWhile the service was great and the interiors were cute and quaint, the food definitely left me wanting more...than bread.  But I think for a cup of coffee and a starch heavy snack, this place could work.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, my sister once told me that the best way to judge  a place is by the quality of the bread they give you to occupy your time, and your stomach. But usually, these are temporary distractions till the main course comes.  Here, bread seems to be the main course, and while, yes, it is some delicious and tasty bread.  Man, and certainly me, cannot live by bread alone."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"How fun was this?

When we got there the place was full.  We had a nice place not in the main room but a sectioned off area behind the bar. So here's the Good, The Bad and the Ugly.  THE GOOD The ambiance was very nice with a cool d√©cor.  The bread served was a challah bread dinner roll with salt flakes this was fantastic.  The Appetizers that I would recommend was the tuna. It was simply lovely with a light glaze of Asian sauce served in a glass bowl on a bed of ice.  I recommend you get this and don't share because it is that good.  Someone told me to get he octopus and so I ordered the charred octopus app.  It was mediocre at best.  I am thinking that they probably wanted me to get the Octopus ceviche.  My 3 dinner mates had entrees that they said really liked.  2 had swordfish with many different flavor profiles along with braised pork belly and beet puree--they certainly got the pork right. I recommend you Get the Side of potatoes. Yummy with fried potatoes in a bed of cr√®me fresh. THE BAD: The place is pretty loud and not great for conversation for a foursome. I found myself talking more to the person next to me because of this. My entree, well the Cioppino was not good. Generally with Cioppino you cook the fish for about 5 minutes in the sauce, this seemed like it was an old entr√©e heated up. I am telling you, the mussels tasted almost exactly like the time I bought frozen mussels because I had a craving; never again.  The fish seemed to have been sitting in the sauce overnight, kind of old and overdue leftovers.  The mussels were mushy, the king crab tasted over its time and the monkfish, which is supposed to resemble lobster, was rubbery and soaked up so much of the sauce. This is not what you would expect from a fine dining seafood restaurant. Dessert was apple cider donuts with cinnamon swirl and sea salt ice cream.  The ice cream was great but the donuts were not light and fluffy. I've had better in a hostess box. Regarding my entr√©e, Shame on me for not sending it back. It was just bad.

I waited in the long line for almost an hour to get a dozen cuz I've never been to Portland before & this is sort of a Portland institution.  I ordered the 'Voodoo Dozen' which means the cashier pics them out.  Some of them are unusual, i.e. a doughnut with oreos sprinkled on it, another with fruitloops on it, etc., but then some of the ones she gave me were just as ordinary as ordinary can be, like a maple bar, and a plain old chocolate covered, plus a few others.  Those weren't 'Voodoo' at all from what I could tell.  One I was hoping the woman would include was the maple bar with bacon strips because I'd read about that one before coming here, but for some odd reason she left that one out in favor of some more ordinary nothing-special doughnuts instead.  I asked her if she could swap one of the ordinary doughnut for it -- she said no, but I could buy it for an additional $2.25, which I did, even though I felt like that was sort of a ripoff.  The doughnuts themselves taste okay as far as doughnuts go, but I wouldn't say they are  anything all that special or spectacular as all the hype & vibe of this place would lead you to believe they are.  They're just doughnuts, some of which have an interesting, unique visual flair.  That said, I was really surprised when she told me they don't take plastic!  This makes NO sense, this is a very popular booming business, it's not like they can't afford the fees of taking plastic (A LOT of other less popular businesses in this area DO take plastic).  She told me I could use their ATM, but I'm sure the fees I get charged for that wouldn't be worth it, however, luckily I had enough cash to pay for them.  Come on Voodoo, this is ridiculous, don't be so damn cheap, take plastic you morons!  IMHO this place is way over hyped for what it is.  I can see how this would be fun for little kids to get some of the unusual doughnuts with cereal or cookies sprinkled on them, so that might be worthwhile under those circumstances, but otherwise Voodoo Doughnuts  really isn't anything all that great."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I am writing this review because I have such a vivid memory of this place. \\n\\nI came here about 6 years ago and sent my dish back.

Out of those restaurants (and they were all good to various degrees) my wife and I both thought Union was the best.

We wanted to sit that the historic bar downstairs, and we're pleased to grab a couple of stools after a fairly short wait. The wait staff was very friendly, and allowed my wife to order from the full menu since she's a vegetarian and the bar didn't have any vegetarian options on it. The oysters were freshly shucked right in front of you which is awesome, the the clam chowdah.... oh my gawd it was wicked pissah! Perhaps people from the region are spoiled with delicious chowder, but being from Texas I was floored with how great it was.

And the best part is every possible combination is divine. Exquisite. Outstanding. You can go with one of their daily combination dogs or build your own as the Picasso of dogs upon a blank bun canvas. \\n\\nAnother favorite thing about Frank is their vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options--they really appeal to absolutely everyone. Their vegetarian hot dog is tasty, but if something more thick and flavorful is your style, they make daily vegan sausage specials, like chipotle, Italian or apple sage, to go between the bun. \\n\\nI'm a big fan of their other dishes, like their loaded fries with melted cheese, sour cream, and scallions, the corn cup, and Frito pie. Basically anything on the menu that catches your eye will be guaranteed appetizing. \\n\\nPlus, they have a condiment for every taste bud out there. The cajun remoulade, sriracha aioli, and chili mayonesa especially go great with any spice-lovers dog.\\n\\nIf you want to explore the wild side of hot dogs and be seriously satisfied doing it, Frank is definitely for you.

I was the last person to order in my group and told the girl in the trailer that I wanted to try a bit of everything so she weighed out a little bit of each meat (excluding the pork shoulder since I had no interest in it) to total a pound with a side of beans. Walked around the corner and added a Mexican Coke to my order and paid. For a sampler of meat, beans and a drink it came out to around $20 so that's not too bad.\\n\\nThe BBQ was fan-freaking-tastic. J Mueller coats his meats with a nice coarse pepper that forms a kind of crust on the meat that is \\"to die for.\\" My sampler included pork ribs, a beef short rib, moist brisket, sausage and turkey. Out of these meats if you were to only pick one, I would highly suggest the beef short rib above all others, but none of the meats were lacking any flavor or awesomness.\\n\\nHIGHLY recommended. \\n\\nSide note: I recently found out that before J Mueller left town he had a restaurant that a young Aaron Franklin worked at.

I'll most likely eat it before it gets to you, that's why.\\n\\nI walk into the shop and the place is very... eclectic.  It's got all sorts of knick knacks, photos, random items.  There was maybe one table and that was it.  I approached the counter and the grungy, hippie of a lady came to my assistance.\\n\\n\\"I'm here for one thing and one thing only: the maple bacon donut\\" I proclaimed like a mighty warrior standing triumphantly over a fallen beast, slain by my bare hands.\\n\\nWith a subtle nod and a \\"ok\\", she goes to retrieve my maple bacon donut and present it to me like a peace offering, in hopes that I won't send in my armies to pillage and plunder their village.\\n\\nI paid and, fulfilling a request, I asked the lady to take a photograph of me taking a bite into said maple bacon donut.  This one's for you Laura\\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/iyJZgnMxc0I4RSgmcoWw0A/l\\n\\nI actually do have to backtrack and say that visually, it probably won't be the most beautiful donut you'll ever see (although with bacon, that's automatic bonus points), so don't get your hopes up.  I mean, two strips of bacon laying perpendicular to a maple glazed bar?  Eh.... I personally would've liked it laying the other way, which I guess I easily could have repositioned it myself, but eh.  If it ain't broke, why fix it? Is what I say.\\n\\nSo I take a bite and my first impression.... pretty good.  Not orgasmic by any sense, but nor was I disappointed.  I sat down and quietly ate my donut, while internally reveling at such a marriage of sweet and savory.  It's not something I'd totally go out of my way for, but definitely will stop by if I've got the time to make my way to NW 3rd and Burnside, or whatever street it was (one block south of Burnside?) and I think it's definitely worth trying at least once in your life.\\n\\nThey have a pretty crazy variety of donuts.  They have your usual fare, but they had donuts topped with breakfast cereal and candy, and they have a donut called the \\"cock and balls\\" which is a large donut in the shape of what else, cock and balls, then dipped (not that kind of dipped!) in chocolate glaze.  I thought it was a play on words, but it was quite literal.\\n\\nI rode off (on foot) into the sunset feel accomplished at the day's kill."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Adorable and delicious!

From the bland commercialized mexican food, to horrible service from the server. Once the food came out, it all started down hill, I've never experienced mexican food with such little flavor. The puffy tacos were a joke, and anything but puffy. I tried both the beef and the chicken, which were unflavored and un-seasoned. The cheese on top was some of the lowest quality I've tasted. The best tasting thing on my plate, was probably the plate itself. You would think that alone would be bad enough, but than our horrible server experience started. First with her sitting in plain view ignoring customers, while she sat enjoying a cup of coffee, as if she was people watching at a Starbucks. When it was time for the check she was no where to be found and was only noticed when a manager walked by a booth where she was enjoying a nap. When she awoke, she proceeded to finally serve food, which I presume was cold to a couple that had been waiting so long, that the husband had finished two whiskey sours before his food was served. Than she finally brought us the check, with a cheery attitude, as if she was a wonderful waitress the whole time and expected a nice tip. Not an experience anyone would expect when they are spending $60 to enjoy a meal. With horrible food and an even worse service, I would never recommend this place to anyone I like, only to my enemies.\\n\\nPS- I have a very strong feeling these good reviews are fake, take a look at the photos.

The place is small and people are everywhere so you have no idea which line is for people waiting for their food and which line is for people who want to order. I order a half sandwich and chicken pot pie soup. I wait about 25 minutes for the food. I finally get it open the bag and realize there is no soup. I call this to the managers attention.  He goes to get the soup. Naturally they are out of chicken Pot pie soup.

I then just request my money back. He tells me the place is a madhouse and he cannot do it now.  However if I write down my address and information he will take care of it. Couple of things ran through my mind. One was that the guy was not going to do it and I would end up paying $9.05 for a rather wimpy half sandwich and a piece of bread. The next thought was \\"How is he going to refund my money when I paid with a credit card?\\"  I write down my information and I then ask him that exact question. He then tell me to write my credit card number on a piece of paper. There was simply no way I was going to do that. I am sure the guy was honest but the place was such a cluster**** that I was not going to risk this guy dropping this paper on the floor or putting it in someones lunch bag.  Last thing I want is a piece of paper with my home address and my credit card number wandering the mean streets of Boston.  At this point I just tell him that I will take a cheeseburger soup so I can be on my way. \\n\\nTo be fair the food is decent there, he did offer to give me the sandwich for free and did upgrade my soup to a large.  He could have tried harder to refund my money but he was doing the best that he could but he was clearly overwhelmed.

The firmly established Santouka family of ramen-yas has finalized its designs in Harvard Square, with results that exceed the years of pent up demand. This is Santouka's second standalone restaurant in the States, and certainly the new flagship of all U.S. Santouka outlets. \\n\\nSantouka offers a few styles, yet the original recipe Shio Tonkotsu is cited as the signature ramen. However, Miso is more expected in Hokkaido, so the fusion of Shio and Tonkotsu flavors is a notable marriage of tastes, even if ennui filled ramen followers are very versed with the Santouka style. (It would be inaccurate to call this only \\"Shio\\".) To be clear, the broth is a medium-weight Tonkotsu, very certainly. It has the telltale milky consistency and milky color too, once you probe under the surface and skim some of the top away. The yellowish tinge on the surface, probably partly derives from the tar√© or kaeshi, the secret sauce or essential oils if you will. It is a concentrated flavoring added at staging time. In this, the Shio characteristics of Santouka's famous bowl are delivered. Again, two very different strands working together, the broth and the tar√©. \\n\\nThis being a new flagship, every attention to detail was presumably excruciatingly looked over, given they performed pop-ups around Harvard Square, operated from Japan, no easy project. In comparison to prior bowls in other U.S. outlets, the wood-ear fungus had a pleasant bite, likely a fresh, un-reconstituted one that was surprising given that many toppings in ramen are preserved. An excellent choice because it centered the whole dish between it's deeper flavors and brighter ones, such as the almost trademark tiny colorful umeboshi, or pickled plum. It always sits in the middle, atop the chopped scallions. Again, and perhaps it's the excitement of opening day, the ume had a more memorable size and quality than other times at other locales. \\n\\nThe chashu, or braised pork belly, and the menma, preserved bamboo shoots were also at peak. Sesame seeds and finally, the swirly pink and white narutomaki or fish cake, completed what Santouka fans expect and newcomers smile back at, as they happily slurp into their virgin bowl. The noodles were perhaps a touch thicker than memory but it's hard to track all the details, such as noodle bend radius waviness factor, and color when artificial lighting is affecting vision, or how much kansu/alkalinity and guessing whether egg white is in play when you are just chowing with no regard to mental note-taking. There's a time to appreciate the beauty and skill of your bowl, and it pretty much ends when the chopsticks hit the surface. Then it's a mad rush to the bottom before the noodles lose their intended essence. \\n\\nSpeaking of bowl, the delicate Santouka blue and white is practically a designator of design that speaks to the owner's passion. He did speak of interesting, sometimes wacky and non-sequitor, analogies to female touches about his ramen. Such as umeboshi being like putting on lipstick as a woman goes out for a date. It's all made up fun of course, but it shows that ramen isn't quite as serious as Bostonians make it out to be, yet it's understandable since there has not been anything to contemplate deeply in soup noodles until now. \\n\\nRegarding service and customer experience. Matt Damon may return one day to the very exact GPS location where he once said, \\"How do you like them apples?\\" and be a bit bewildered to find, instead of donuts, a small army of full-service waitstaff, a maitre d' stand, Japanese bins to hold your coat at all tables and port side windows peering into a huge array of stock bins complete with built-in plumbing arrangements. It's simply the classiest ramen-ya I have been to."},{"name":"Flying Cat Coffee","address":"3041 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I stopped by here randomly after an appointment I had next door.

He's not as adventurous as I am so he didn't go for anything big.\\n\\nNow here's why I left out a star. The service. I mean, if I could, I would've given 4.5. I just rated whatever felt RIGHT, as I believe this restaurant definitely has room to improve. We had 2 different servers during our time there, and they were all quite nice, checked up on us here and there to ask how everything was which was cool, but like say I wanted some more parm cheese to add on to my dish, which I had no idea I could do until I half ate my dish, she never came out with it, and also like asking for the bill too, it was kinda confusing. I dunno, the servers would decent, but didn't seem to get that connection with them like they enjoyed their job. So again, just like the seats, I wish they'd give in more with accommodation, cause I mean, it IS top of the hub. \\n\\nTHE FOOD WAS VERY FILLING. People are always scared for small portions, and the price, but HERE'S THE THING: the only thing is that you'll be bummed out like me, SUPER BUMMED that there aren't leftovers. cause say usually I go get my comfort food local pasta for $15, and I typically have TONS of leftovers for the next day. I'm just bummed out that my AMAZING toth food didn't last. That's part of the star left off.

I'm jealous to read others received a spinach salad (miniature tomatoes notwithstanding) - the standard salad appears to have now been downgraded to 'small plate of iceberg lettuce, with a few radish slices.'  The soups offered - borsch or mushroom - are really good.  The borsch isn't as good as MY borsch, but I was still pretty impressed with it.  I enjoyed the tilapia as well (teeny tiny slice as it was), and I liked how the fish was adorably decorated with small dancing vegetables (of course, I did note the price fix option only offered as an entr√©e veggie crepes, chicken and tilapia - basically, the least expensive mains - guess you pay for the presentation).  The final course - crepes! - were quite tasty - so all in all, I did enjoy my meal.  I guess I'm just a bit turned off by the insinuation that customers are getting a good deal through Groupon.

This line continues inside and wraps around the end and comes back around. This line can be daunting but it is so well worth the wait. There is no name list or receptionist. You literally wait in line to order your meal at the counter, watch it being cooked, grab your food, pay for it and THEN find a place to sit down. This is very important as you will see having a place to sit will not be a problem but you will not be allowed to save seats no matter how large your party is.\\n\\nOnce inside, the aroma of breakfast, eggs, pancake, toast and fresh squeezed juices overwhelm your senses. It's really cozy inside so the wait may be around 50 min if you are at the beginning of the door and more if you're outside. \\n\\nI have to disagree about any bad things with pancakes here. They are SO moist AND fluffy. How do they do that? I cook pancakes at home, I follow the recipe and even find recipes for \\"extra fluffy\\" pancakes and it never comes out tasting like such. \\n\\nThey also serve lunch during brunch times so you can order the varieties of salads, sandwiches and soups they have on order. But their breakfast was what zoomed me in. The fresh bowl of fruit was literally ... FRESH. Everything tasted so deliciously ripe and had that \\"just cut\\" feel.

The elements of sweetness and creaminess just pair together fantastically, and the walnuts add a nice crunch to the otherwise \\"soft\\" dish.

Smoked salmon by itself has a saltiness richness about it, but the spread cuts into that and provides a nice balance. \\n\\nMy girlfriend favored the salmon, while I favored the brie. I wouldn't order the tartines by themselves though. I think eating the two them balanced out the flavors, and overall, provided a melody of sweet and salt. \\n\\nThe staff were great, but it literally took about 15 minutes for them to notice that we were even there. It took about 5-7 min for us to get a menu, and it took even longer for them to take our order. We were ready to order in about 2 minutes because the happy hour menu was already on the table.

Nice. \\n\\nThe party arrived over 15-20 minutes- each new guest was promptly greeted, drink orders taken and delivered quickly. Suggestions were made on the menu, as it was a first visit for all of us. Wine menu had some great offerings by the glass and by the bottle. We started off with the Rose Cava and moved to a Chianti. Sitting near the bar, we saw some tasty drinks being created and the Blackberry Mojito looked amazing. \\n\\nHubby and I enjoyed the house salad with pear and I ordered a wood fired pizza, he ordered the pasta with mussels. Raves for all of our choices! We split the house salad and it arrived in to separate bowls, nice touch- no extra charge. I enjoyed the Caprese pizza, with artichokes. ($14.95+1.50 for extra topping) The pizza crust was not too thick or thin, tender and cooked perfectly. I would have appreciated some more cheese and toppings, but when topped with some sprinkled parm, it was great. Nice sauce, for sure. Hubby loved his pasta, a nice portion of Orecchiette with Mussels, mushrooms and a flavorful garlic wine sauce.

The doggie patio is what sold us for repeat visits, and there are always a few water bowls out. These tables, although not covered, have umbrellas. This is concrete, though, so we bring a towel for our dog to lay on if she wants. \\n\\nNow, to the food. A single is usually enough for me, and that runs about $4 before the paid additions such as cheese or bacon. Doubles are $6. The patties are done in a thinner style, but still very juicy and tasty - that's hard to get right and they do it well. The raw onions are red onions, which makes me a happy gal. There's a burger that's served with bacon, cheese, onion rings, and BBQ sauce that is excellent. You can build your own burger, or select one of their many burgers with pre-selected toppings. Their onion rings are thicker slices and cornmeal-coated. I'm picky about o-rings, but these are very, very good. I usually like skinny slices, but these were great. The fries are ripple-cut, kind of boring. I had the chili cheese fries my first visit, and haven't had them since, because the fries just didn't stand up very well or make the dish tasty. I think I'll try a cup of the chili by itself next time, though, because I think it was good on its own.\\n\\nOn Tuesdays, they have more high-brow burger options and appetizer specials, but we haven't made it over for those yet. We plan to, for certain. \\n\\nI'm not a beer drinker, but my hubby likes the draft list; they have some low-brow cheapy options as well as some $7/glass higher-end craft beers, and every price point in between. In general, the beer list is excellent. \\n\\nAs for the bar, I'm pregnant, so I haven't been drinking, but the menu looks solid. They also have milkshakes, including alcoholic ones. I went near Xmas, and they had a special shake with eggnog, brandy, whisky, rum, and cinnamon toast crunch. O_o I was tempted to get one (at $8) just to try a sip. \\n\\nI usually get a single bacon cheddar burger, and you can make it a combo with fries and a drink, which comes to about $8.

We settled for another small table in a slightly better location.  \\nOur waiter, Griffin, arrives.  He's great! We loved him! Very attentive!! I can go on and on, but this review is getting long.  We both order the rum punch.  I hated it & asked to exchange it.  Griffin states he needs to talk to the manager & here comes James..good grief! I don't like him.  He asked what was wrong with the drink.  I explained it didn't taste how I imagined it would & asked for a different drink.  He seemed perturbed and wanted to know exactly what I didn't like about the drink! (Listen...either you will exchange it or you won't).  He proceeds to go on and on about how most people love it, he makes all the drinks, and asks if he should stop making it because one person dislikes it!!!! Ummm...of course not.  He tells me they don't normally take back drinks but will do it today.  Great...\\nThis review is too long, so let me wrap up.  The food (lobster mac and cheese & fried chicken) was great!! Griffin was great! James is an awful host and manager.  I will likely not return simply because of him."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely worth trying at least once!

The donuts themselves vary in size, but are all quite good - just the right balance of fluffy and chewy. I was also surprised that the jelly fillings weren't super sweet and artificial tasting!

I finally walked over to her to try and say that I am picking up an order, she looked at me with an irritated look, ignored me, talked for a while longer, and walked away to the back without saying a word to me. I stood there for at least 5 more minutes and then thought that I would just get in line and pay at the cash register. I waited in line for almost 10 minutes at the cash register (3 people in front of me) and when I got to the front she said that I needed to go to the bar to pick up my order. Seriously? So I walked back to the bar, waited again for a minute or two, then a different bartender appeared and I walked over and talked out loud that I have an order for pick up. Paid, got my food, and left.

So now, if you're a local in there for a doughnut, you're good to go, and if you're a tourist there for a bit of an edible, sadistic souvenir and bragging rights, go on ahead. Everyone is happy. Another thing is that the people who work here are so very, very rude. So extremely rude. Giant gutter punk brutes who just glare and hand you your doughnuts.

One server/bartender who was definitely distracted with other tasks, service actually got better as more people showed up since she was on the floor more at that point. If I had any complaints it would be that incredibly minor point. The menu is diverse and creative and the kitchen delivers high quality, well portioned grub. Not your typical bar food. Reminded me of The Crest. We had the pierogies which we were concerned were overpriced at $10 for 4 but once we tasted, felt were totally worth it. My husband had the archers of loaf. The bacon meatloaf was delicious and the meal itself was huge, he had plenty of leftovers. I had the big room burger made with a veggie patty and roasted carrots and leeks on the side. Again, fantastic quality and delicious. Hubby had a Bloody Mary which he thought was a little spicy but he's not crazy for spice. Overall we will be back!

Having only two parties of four in front of our party of four, it took us two hours to sit down. The entire time we waited we were ignored completely, with no word on how long the wait would be. The hostess told us it would be just a minute more about an hour and a half in, and then we didn't see her for another thirty minutes. \\nOnce we sat down we waited for another 10 minutes to be seen by our waiter when there are only 10 tables and two waiters in the whole restaurant. There was no apology or understanding about how long we had waited or any acknowledgment at all as the waiter and hostess and cook spent most of the time we were there chatting or taking coffee breaks. \\nThe food itself was an incredible rip off. I understand the concept of this restaurant is supposed to be quaint and progressive but they confused classy with shoddy. Spending $11 for half a plate of food is ridiculous for brunch specials. Everyone at the table was still hungry after the tiny portions were eaten. The food was poorly made, lukewarm, and low quality for an exorbitant price.\\nWe never saw our waiter again. Ever. We had to flag down the hostess to get our check, flag down the busser to take our check, and left without our plates being cleared. To top it off, the waiter showed up to the table to look at the tip we didn't leave faster than we'd seen him move all day.

The school is also a hotel with unique rooms, such as old classrooms and the new wing with a literature theme. \\n\\nI've been to the Courtyard Restaurant a couple of times, the Cypress Room once, the Boiler Room once, and the rest of my time is spent in Detention. The food here is a bit above average; tasty Fish and Chips, big burgers, and amazing Cajun Tater Tots. The times I've been in Courtyard were busy, a long wait for a table and food to come in.

My favorite place is Detention, but I will caution that it isn't for everyone.\\n\\nThe Detention Room is a full bar, but I will tell you that it has a lot of whiskey on their shelves. It is also a cigar-only bar, where one can purchase and enjoy a cigar from their humidor or you can bring your own.

We rented some Hubway bikes and took to the streets!\\n\\nThe cool thing about this place was the mall on the bottom floor. You have a lot of shops to choose from and a huge food court. What we were wanting to see was the observatory deck but it was $16 to see, so we did the next best thing: Used that money towards food and drinks while getting to see the same views from the Top of the Hub restaurant. This place is definitely a more upscale joint. Dramatic vaulted ceilings, dark color contrasts and servers dressed in all black really made the place seem more chic. Each server came with a servers assistant, it seemed, and the staff was definitely on point. Our server was attentive and really accommodating. He was cordial and really made our experience a good one! \\n\\nFor lunch, I got the Arugula salad for $9 and added shrimp to it for $6 more. The salad was arugula, Gorgonzola cheese, toasted pine nuts and a balsamic vinaigrette. I love the spiciness of the arugula. Paired with the sweetness of the balsamic and you've got a nice combination. The pine nuts brought a nice crunchy element and the Gorgonzola cheese really sealed the deal for me. Salty and creamy, I enjoyed every last bite! Along with the salad, I got the clam chowder for $10. This soup is one of Boston's signature dish and was filled with loads of clam, potatoes and onions. The cream was nice but a little soupy. I almost envisioned it being thicker but the flavors were still there. Lots of clams to solidify the name! \\n\\nWhen you're in Boston, The Pru is definitely the way to go! Instead of paying $16 on the 50th floor, take a couple of levels up to the 52nd floor and use that money towards drinks and food.

When was that?  Nearly seven years ago?  Time flies. In the dozen meals we've had at Andina since, each has been as good as or better than the one before it.  Not just excellent, but consistently excellent.  A difficult thing to do in food service but the difficult is made to look easy here.\\n\\nRelative to how many great places there are to eat in the city and so little time to eat at them we tend to stay \\"on the move\\" when we visit Portland.  That we've been to Andina so many times reflects our high regard for it.  The components of food, ambiance and service perfectly balance to keep pulling us back.  For happy hour, for lunch, for dinner, with friends, by ourselves, on a sunny day, on a rainy day, for a special occasion or for no occasion at all, Andina is a just right choice. \\n \\nFOOD:  We've grazed our way through Andina menus and come up with a few favorites, although everything is delicious.  Our preferred way to eat at Andina is to make a meal of appetizers, which they offer in small, medium and large plate options, or order a few appetizers and a couple entrees, if more than the two of us dining, and share everything.  \\n \\nAmong our favorite appetizers are poquillo peppers stuffed with quinoa and Serrano ham, potatoes with three dipping sauces, savory steamed mussels, grilled octopus skewers and quinoa studded shrimp. Favorite entrees include anything lamb, in particular the lamb shanks redolent with aji Amarillo and cilantro, and also chicken that has an aji Amarillo and peanut sauce. A \\"can't miss\\" dessert is whatever creme brulee trio is offered and Alfajores (sp?), a cookie with key lime flavors and powdered sugar.  (Beware!  They are addicting and sold as \\"each\\" so you'll want to order extras after the first one!)  \\n \\nLIBATIONS:: Great cocktail list!  At happy hour (4 - 6) they offer a couple of bucks off specialty beverages (normally $9).  We highly recommend the Pisco Sour (almost no one makes one right, but Andina does), Caipirinha (think mojito made with cachaca instead of rum) and hands down my favorite cocktail of all time, their Fuerte de Tamarindo (tamarind nectar, rye whiskey, orange and lime served in a tamarind sugar rimmed glass).\\n \\nSERVICE:  Whether we've eaten in the bar or in the restaurant, for lunch or dinner, service has been stellar every time.  The staff makes you feel welcome, knows the menu and is eager to answer questions about Peruvian food and flavors.  At every visit we think the management and staff could teach a master class on how to get hospitality right.\\n \\nAMBIANCE:  Photos Joshua C. posted say it best to demonstrate how vibrant and cozy at the same time is Andina.  We love the colored napkins on the tables!  After 7:00 (?) on most (all?) nights there is live music of various musicians that fit perfectly.  A wonderful thing to do on a rainy evening is order small plates in the bar, in front of the fire, with a cocktail and enjoy the music along with everything else.\\n\\nThe only drawback of Andina also has to do with ambince and it is the very tight tables. Removing a couple of table to mitigate the \\"sardine can\\" seatingwould be more comfy for all dines and the wait staff too.\\n \\nVALUE:  Depending on choices made, you can eat pretty inexpensively or very expensively at Andina. (Appetizers in small plate sizes are about $9.  Entrees range from roughly $20 to $30 at dinner.)  Regardless, the experience and quality for the dollars spent is worth it!\\n \\nACCESSIBILITY:  NYTimes restaurant reviewer Frank Bruni started paying more attention to access when a friend who ate and drank with him needed to use a wheelchair and he discovered how many barriers there were to her equal participation.  We pay more attention too these days.  We learned during a visit to Andina when we had a wheelchair involved that there is a wheelchair lift from the street level a half flight up to the restaurant.  .\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  When folks used to ask us our favorite Portland restaurant, we'd need to think about it for a second or two...there are so many good ones... but in \\"forced choice\\" to whittle the many to one, we  inevitably answered Higgens.  Now we still need to think for a second, but in the last four years our answer is inevitably Andina!"},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Lives up to the hype.
