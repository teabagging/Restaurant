It came with a cute little soup cup - 'irish stew,' which was a nice mild broth with onions, potatoes, green beans, and some other vegetable things... but the main attraction was slivers of pastrami. Ooooh so good.\\n\\nSoon afterwards I made a return trip, for some bleu cheese and apple quesadillas - likewise delicious, although with all the crepes I've been eating recently, it was weird to experience those ingredients on the inside of a tortilla.\\n\\nThere's a whole breakfast menu that needs exploring, as well as a couple other tasty looking treats... which will require some serious future visits."},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Only if you sit at the bar on the second floor, or only at the whole bar area on the first floor can you order a burger.\\n\\nIt's off-menu and I was asking the bartender the other day- it's a 9 oz dry aged ribeye/brisket burger, served on a brioche bun with lettuce, red onion, bacon, salt and butter pickles, and -I believe it was- a ketchup and mustard housemade remoulade sauce. Not sure about the remoulade aspect- I remember hearing it somewhere before- maybe it was the burger? And let's not forget the extra, EXTRA sharp piece of cheddar that goes on top of it.\\n\\n(The other secret menu item is a tomahawk steak. Whereas the burger is always available- just at the bar- the tomahawk is subject to availability)\\n\\nI searched Yelp all over for a review on their burger and I was pretty surprised how I did not find a one that went and actually reviewed the burger. There was one- I saw- that did mention getting the burger, but I did not see any reviews for it.\\n\\nThe burger costs $21 and it's served with a side of Parmesan Herb French Fries. Based on the menu alone- the fries separately cost $10, so essentially the burger is $11- which is a really fair market price. The fries are also really good market price. What's an order of large fries elsewhere? $3/$4? Well, the fries here feel like it's double in portion what you get at McDonald's or Burger King (reference). Not only that- but just tasting it- the Parmesan is top-notch and the herbs add a really nice astringent, aromatic taste to it. For lack of a better word- it was most definitely herby. Not a pungency like bleu cheese, but it was honestly- more pungent than I initially expected, but in a good way. An interesting twist on traditional or even truffled fries. Oddly enough- if you've ever eaten Chinese style Salt and Pepper Squid, the fries taste VERY similar to that. I'm not kidding either- you try Salt and Pepper squid, then try the Fries here and you TELL ME that they don't taste near identical. 5/5\\n\\nAs far as I know, the hallmarks of Grill 23 & Bar are the 100-Day Aged Ribeye, the Grill 23 (truffled) Tots, and the Coconut Cake. These are arguably, the most favorited entree, side, and dessert item.\\n\\nI really wanted to like the tots- I really, really did. I held such high expectations for them too. If you want my honest advice- stick to the fries. I, personally, was not a fan of the tots- but many other people are, so who knows- odds are in your favor that you'll like them. Anyways, it's mashed potato, rolled up into tater tots, battered, fried, and then tossed with Truffle oil. By the looks of it, a good amount of salt too. They were salted just right, the mashed potato had a nice consistency, and the coating was good. I just, gotta say- French fries had much more of an impact on me. These tots remind me of the smiley face fries that I had when I was younger- mashed potatoes with a batter-fried shell outside. Of course- these tots have more depth to them than the frozen smiley fries, but they were still underwhelming. Sorry, but I have to give them a 2/5 for me.\\n\\nNow- let's talk about this monstrosity of a burger. IT IS BIG. #9OUNCES. To put that into perspective- it's roughly eating a little more burger than 2 Quarter Pounders. Oh my god- I know that I had some bread as a snack beforehand, but wow- this thing is massively big. I was quite surprised why it never got the review that it deserved until the moment that I took my first bite.\\n\\nIt is quite literally, something that you do not want to put down. I am pretty sure, that whoever else may have eaten the burger simply did not want to stop, take a picture, etc... Although I didn't want to stop eating it- I got full and had to put it down, take a break, and take my food to go. The burger is definitely good- it's definitely a good burger and it justifies it's pricing, and as good as it was- it did not \\"blow my socks off\\". I'm not saying that it was bad- it was a good burger, and I definitely will have it sometime again- but it's doesn't seem like something that I would go out of my way to get. Juicy, flavorful, the sauce was really good and so was the bacon- this is a solid 5/5.\\n\\nI was served by Bartenders Joe and Kevin on the first floor- absolutely amazing service. When my glass of water was empty- boom! Refilled. Really nice people too.\\n\\nThere was a rotation of chocolate truffles with limited availability on the menu and I really wanted to try it- but sadly, it ran out :( *sighs*\\n\\nAnyways- this is a really nice restaurant, the service is great and the atmosphere is really nice too. Only 5 minutes away from the Arlington T Stop, so it's really accessible too.\\n\\nThe burger and the fries really sealed the deal- if I could, I would definitely give the fries a 7/5 because they absolutely destroyed my grading scale for fries. But wow- OH MY GOD, if you are a fan of bleu cheese, or Parmesan, or- apparently- salt and pepper squid, you absolutely HAVE to try these fries!"},{"name":"Blacker's Bakeshop","address":"543 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Newton","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite bakery around.

Having worked with the breed for many years, I can assure you that as a breed, pitts are NOT dog aggressive.  They are TRAINED to be aggressive (we all know about dog fighting rings), but their breed characteristics lean towards overly friendly and rowdy.  My pitt bull has NEVER been in a dog fight or skirmish, we regularly socialize her with other dogs, and we have had her for three years.  She was a shelter dog, and was found on the street in North Philadelphia.  She changes people's minds about pitt bulls.\\n\\nMy point is, I will not be frequenting this coffee shop.

All three of our items came out to the table at the same time, so we ate the salad along with the pizza, and it was nice to have the arugala to cut through the richness of both pizzas.\\n\\nI only had a few bites of the fennel sausage pizza, but it was very good & made me wonder if they'd be willing to do the funghi pizza without their tomato sauce - it seemed like the plain pizza base might compliment the mushrooms & the truffle emulsion better. The funghi pizza was great as it was though, and different than other mushroom/truffle pizzas I've had at other places.\\n\\nWhile the crust it supposed to be a classic thin crust, it did seem a little dry for my taste, and the crust itself had no discenrable seasoning, which is good to not distract from the toppings of each pizza but makes eating the crusts less enjoyable (it's usually my favorite part).\\n\\nService was great, and fairly quick, especially for freshly made pizza & salads made to order, and the tracking system they use to deliver the food to the table is a nice update (it's similar to the systems used at Burger Fi & Be Our Guest).

Prove it you say? OK, here's the deal. They are made with double filtered water so they impart no flavor to the drink, and they have that cool transparency effect. They are perfect cubes. No dimples or holes. They are frozen at what must be lower temps than usual because they don't melt away in a few minutes. They hang in there for the long haul.  They are large. I rarely measure ice cubes, but I would ball park them at an inch and a half to two inches in diameter.  That's some big swingin' ice, Jeeyumm. When you put them in a rocks glass they class the hell out of it. They make that cool tinkly musical sound when the glass tilts pre or post sip. I immediately wanted to be wearing a black 1950's tux with the bow tie undone and the collar open while Dean Martin and I decided which club to hit in Manhattan after we finished our drinks here. Proof enough? Yeah, you better look away. Tell me to prove it. Prove this. OK, before this escalates, let's just agree I'm right. \\n\\nJason, the mixologist, was that perfect combination of friendly and laid back. Friendly enough to give the history of the place and bring us cool old bartenders books to peruse while we sipped, and laid back enough to give us space when we got involved in the drinking and eating and talking portion, while always ready to fill up a water glass or suggest another really, seriously good drink. And really good drinks are their specialty. They have an enormous selection of mixers and tinctures and although I heard several people ask for unusual drinks while I was there, not only were they never stumped, they usually asked which version the customer wanted. Mistress Linda and Kimberly both like grapefruit so they had several different drinks utilizing both fresh grapefruit and some arcane grapefruit bitters and they were all simply By Golly Great!\\n\\nThe food balances the cocktails perfectly. We adored the charcuterie and cheese plates and I will have them again. Plus they give lots of toasted bread with each platter, rather than the skimpy one or two pieces at some other places. The prices are on a par with the service and fare. The ambience is modern and upscale, but very inviting and comfortable. I love bars so we sat there, and the bar stools are more than comfortable enough to park it for a serious night of sipping, but there were tables along a long back wall if you prefer them. It's not a large place, but it seems larger than it is. \\n\\nIt ain't cheap, but when you're in the mood to dress up and hit the town in style, you can't go wrong here. I could see where there could be a snooty factor here but it wasn't in evidence when we visited.\\n\\nIt occupies an odd time warp between Second Bar and Kitchen, and the restaurant Congress. Both of these have their own bars, so Bar Congress is not part of either, but since it has no street entrance of its own you have to go through one or the other to get to it, like it's a secret. This makes me like it more. And I liked it a lot already.

Really does. Like, epic hurt. I mean, I REALLY thought I was going to love this place. Especially when we sat down and they started playing Guns N' Roses \\"Sweet Child O' Mine.\\" I was exhilarated. \\n\\nLet me preface by saying (1) my wife and I had high expectations and (2) I gauge my experience at restaurants based largely on the cost:experience ratio. Because to me, dining is an experience, much like a concert or a sporting event. If we go to Fatt Matt's Rib Shack, I don't expect Bacchanalia-level experience, and I still feel as though I get more than I paid for. And when we go to Bacchanalia, I feel the same way -- the cost:experience ratio is worthwhile to me. We'll go back to both places in a heartbeat.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I can't say the same thing about Gunshow, and my wife and I agreed (before the meal was through, mind you), that we wouldn't do it again. \\n\\nAnd that's too bad, because the food was good (though definitely not worth the prices charged). I think my wife hit the nail on the head when she said it was like being at a food truck park except all out of the same kitchen. Each small plate was well done, but c'mon, $25 for a chicken-fried lobster tail and a dollop of potato salad that tasted like, well, potato salad. That's just plain ridiculous. Tasted good, but ridiculous nonetheless.\\n\\nOur favorites were the foie gras/apple dish (though the foie was still chilled in the center), the in-and-out-like slider and the lamb mole/corn dish. We also had the aforementioned chicken-fried lobster tail, which was good but not great, the Brazilian churrascaria plate, which was pretty blah, the vegetarian grilled \\"octopus,\\" which was reasonably good for being vegetarian (I am a stalwart meatatarian) and the steamed pork belly bun, which I liked a lot but the wife thought was too sweet. For dessert, we had the banana pudding (can't go wrong) and the huckleberry-in-a-chocolate-pie-crust thingy, which was not that good and maybe could even be categorized as bad. \\n\\nBut even if we had dropped $260 (meal, dessert, cocktail and bottle of wine for the two of us), I don't think we would have been nearly as disappointed had it not been for the execution.\\n\\nAnd I do mean execution. They should rename the place \\"Machine Gun Show,\\" for crying out loud. They attempt to kill you with food as quickly as possible. Within 12 minutes of sitting down, four plates had been dropped at our table, and we were already over $70 in the hole and stuffing our face nonstop to keep up (think gluttony from the movie \\"Se7en\\"). I shouldn't be hustled through a meal that costs this much. Who does he think he is, Jiro Ono?\\n\\nIn addition, to echo the sentiment of others here, the chefs/waiters frequently seem annoyed when you turn down a dish (which is difficult to do when they plop it in the middle of the table as if you've ordered it), and we definitely experienced this, though it was not universal among the chefs. And it was loud, but we didn't have any trouble hearing each other, so people complaining about that may need hearing aides or ear horns. In fact, we thought the ambiance was fun.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that, for $260, we expect to spend more than an hour and 10 minutes at a place unless the food and experience is worth it, which this is not. Sadly, we won't be back, and I'll be recommending it to others with a lot of reservations."},{"name":"Casa De Luz","address":"1701 Toomey Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Having been here many more times since my first experience, I'll say that it's grown on me a great deal.  The food is more flavorful and seems to be better thought-out in terms of pairings of courses.  It also feels a lot looser than it did when I first visited 5 years ago (as in less uptight).  Could be because the price has gone up so they can afford a bit more variety & options.\\n\\nAnd they got rid of the process of paying for the wooden token, which you then gave to a person 5 feet away from where you bought it.

I've been to the Harp a few times and I have some general rules for having a successful night:\\n\\n1. Pregame hard: You're going to need to be slightly tipsy to deal with the massive amounts of people. With two big floors this place is packed! I made the mistake of coming here for a sober night and quickly regretted it. I found myself wishing I never handed over $10 at the door.\\n\\n2. Get there early: This one's easy -- nobody likes long lines. We all know it's hard to end pregames and actually get everyone in a cab. But trust me, it is worth it to avoid this line! So fill up your flasks and get out the door by 10. \\n\\n3. Wear shoes with some strong soles: The floor is sticky as hell. I made the mistake of wearing some flimsy flats and could barely walk because my feet were so stuck to the floor! In my attempt to dance I ended up awkwardly swaying back and forth so that I wouldn't fall over due to lack of feet support -- really attractive.\\n\\n4. Wear earplugs if you hate bad singing: I LOVE cover bands. But after a few vodka tonics everyone suddenly thinks they're Christina Aguilera and forgets that they don't actually know the lyrics to the Outfield's \\"Your Love\\". Stick with the opening line people, then let the band do the rest.\\n\\n5. Never break the seal: The last time I went to the Harp the line for the women's bathroom was unbelievable. There was literally 50 girls on the line! No way am I wasting half my night waiting to get in the bathroom.

We also wanted to try it and utilized the Portland dining month opportunity as a trial for a possible future party. We were seated in a corner table in the back of the room. Took a while to get a server to take our order for drinks. He explained that menu for PDM was not the \\"full experience\\" some meat options were not included. Which was fine, we probably wouldn't have noticed anyway. Service was not good. It was clearly obvious that since we were not there for the \\"full experience\\" or: not paying full dinner menu price we were not considered a priority like the others around us. First off it was quite a while before any of the meat carvers even stopped at our table. Then most went past our table. Maybe the location made it inconvenient. We didn't get our cocktails until 40 minutes into dinner and we were almost done. We only saw a server a couple of times toward the end of our meal. Pick up plates finally and bring the bill. Cocktails $14 each are spendy for the quality as well. At one point a gentleman came through and stopped at all the tables around us to check how meals were but as soon as he saw we had the PDM markers on our table he kept on walking by. Not even an acknowledgement to say hello. \\nThe whole dining experience made us feel awkward and disappointed. We generally prefer smaller independent portland restaurants over chains.

With the dark surroundings and how hot it was, I felt very sticky and uncomfortable. \\n\\nRicky's is a restaurant where you order food at the register and they call you when your food is ready. The guy at the register did not look very happy or friendly. I ordered the steak combo. My boyfriend asked for steak and the guy said he has to go check if they still have steak in the back.  That was pretty strange as I would think the restaurant would stock up on food to prepare for the weekend. Since this restaurant did not seem very busy, I am assuming they do not have a lot of food on hand. \\n\\nOn to the food, the plates seemed to have a lot of food when you first looked at it, but the meals were not very fulfilling. My steak tasted okay, I think the chimichurri sauce made it taste good. The plantains were very good - sweet and soft. I think they need to give more rice (and I'm not even a rice person). The amount of rice they gave was not enough carbs for me to feel full. My boyfriend felt the same way about his meal.

On the most recent occasion, P started with the steak tartare and got the 100 Day Aged Dry Prime Rib as his entree. P is normally hesitant at where he orders steak tartare, but he knew that Grill 23 would come through. P's prime rib was perfectly marbled and seasoned. A started with the clam chowder and got a seafood special as her entree that included scallops, swordfish, and veggies in a thick white wine broth. The seafood special was the best decision A could have made; the scallops melted in her mouth and she was pretty upset after the last bite. We split cream spinach as a side and washed the meal down with a Cabernet Sauvignon (reasonably priced for where you are).

For example, during my first visit, my dining partner opted for the PBLT sandwich, which was comprised of pimento cheese, bacon, lettuce, and fried green tomatoes. I opted for the stuffed french toast, which was prepared using challah bread, ricotta stuffing, and fresh berries, all of which neatly complemented one another for a simply sublime taste. I also ordered a biscuit on the side, which was served with a pinch of lavender that added both flavor and presentational flair. \\n\\nService: Contrary to other reviewers, I found the service to be pleasant and efficient, particularly for a Sunday morning. I was also impressed by the fact that our server returned to our table after I placed my order to inquire as to whether I wanted to change my order to an item that he originally had told me was sold out. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The lackluster atmosphere is the sole reason why I'm unable to commit to a 5 star rating. First, Sun in My Belly is somewhat difficult to find. It's located in a former hardware store, but the owners have failed to feature a prominent sign noting the restaurant's name on the exterior of the building; if it weren't for the sandwich board with specials out front, I would have never known this was the actual restaurant. Second, as others have noted, the interior of the restaurant is incredibly cramped and the chairs are difficult to endure for a prolonged period. Finally, the ambience was virtually non-existent; the first dining room is vaguely reminiscent of a school arts room and the staff's repeated tearing of paper to place on the tops of newly set tables became incredibly annoying after about 10 minutes.\\n\\nPrice: Commensurate with the quality of the food. Most entrees cost approximately $9, while sides are around $3. For certain sides, such as macaroni n' cheese, there are 3 different size options with varying prices.\\n\\nOther: Parking can be somewhat difficult on weekends, but your best bet is to park directly on College Street and walk to the restaurant. Also, there is typically a wait for a table, but it goes fast. During my visit for Sunday Brunch, we were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes, but we were seated within less than 10 minutes.

My girlfriend and I have pretty reasonable expectations for GF options, and we typically only go to places with dedicated GF menus or that clearly label GF dishes. Although we couldn't actually find the GF menu online, the PDF version of the menu and the menus they gave us both specifically said, \\"Ask to see our gluten free menu.\\" We got there, sat down, and asked to see the GF menu, at which point our server told us \\"We don't have a separate menu. Just pick anything on the menu and we can make it gluten free.\\" We were skeptical, but we took him at his word.\\n\\nWe ordered General Gao's Chicken and Kung Pao Beef, and he told us they weren't available GF. We tried the Kung Pao Chicken and the Sesame Beef, both still no. He suggested the Hot and Spicy Chicken, which we accepted. He went back to the kitchen and returned immediately, telling us that the Hot and Spicy Chicken that he had recommended was not available GF either. We asked to see the menu again to decide on our sixth choice, and he stood next to the table waiting the entire time we were looking.\\n\\nLong story short: Don't advertise a GF menu you don't have, and certainly don't explicitly say you can make everything GF when that's just not true.

The portions are smaller, unlike American restaurants, so sharing an app is good if you both want a small taste without ruining your dinner.  This was something to be savored, not wolfed down, so if you want quantity, (and sometimes we do) do not go here, it will be pricey!\\n\\nHe chose the special of mahi mahi, and I chose the salmon encrusted with white sesame seeds.  It was served on a bed of collard greens in a tomato and coconut sauce with a side of rice.  It was creative, exotic, and delicious.

I just flew in and was taking 3 other guests out to dinner.  We ordered the corn bread as the appetizer to share along with drinks.  It took FOREVER to get our drinks (we wound up ordering food after 15 min of looking at the menu yet still not having our drinks) and the corn bread finally arrived. \\n\\nI was the lucky one to take a bite into it and discovered a long black hair in it!  Obviously, we all ceased from eating it!  I pointed it out to the server and they didn't offer to replace it.  We were all finally served our drinks, then meal (ridiculous amount of waiting time) and simply didn't enjoy the meal like I know this place normally can do.  We were never given our check and management never showed.  Our server totally disappeared.  I went to the bar tender to tell him our table and get our tab (it was about an hour later than it should have been so it felt) and told him what happened.  He never offered to do anything about the hairy corn bread experience nor even pointed it out to management.  I was even charged for the corn bread we never finished!!  I was so pissed that I just paid it and left.\\n\\nI then sent an e-mail to corporate shortly after that and to this day, haven't heard any response.  About 10 months later, they filed bankruptcy (go figure) BUT somehow the Arboretum location still survived?!  I even have a code for a free appetizer (saved the receipt), yet I've purposely refrained from ever going back.  Anyone who mentions Z-Tejas gets to hear about my experience, including no response from anyone after trying to reach out.  After seeing this receipt on my desk for a year, I decided to Yelp my experience.  I'd avoid this place at all cost!

While I usually like my seafood Baltimore-style (for shrimp, that would be Old Bay & vinegar), the red pepper aioli sauce made up for the lack of flavor in the shrimp themselves.  They're actually served with three sauces, but I practically ignored the other two because that one was so good.\\n\\nThe Asian chicken skewers were pretty good, though they have a bit of a burnt taste...Though I think they're supposed to be that way, as they're covered with burnt sesame seeds.  Interesting...\\n\\nI don't normally eat ham, but the purpose of our visit was taste-testing for a catering event, so I tried the Coca-Cola Glazed ham.  It was served thinly sliced on biscuits, and those biscuits were delicious!  The mustard was really high-quality stuff, but I would have preferred it without it.  I didn't really taste any Coca-Cola, but it was still quite good.\\n\\nThe salmon was pretty good, with delicious seasonings atop the filet.  It wasn't the best salmon ever, but it was definitely delicious.\\n\\nFor dessert, we tried the key lime tarts, lemon-margarita triangles, and bananas foster.  The key lime tarts were adorable, but too sweet for my taste.  The lemon-margarita triangles were much better...but the bananas foster was my favorite.

I was equally impressed both times by the service, the food, and the ambiance.\\n\\nMy first venture to Mooo (which I hadn't heard of until a Beacon Hill friend said that it was his favorite steakhouse ever) was for lunch during Restaurant Week. Most of the time I hesitate to base my impression of a restaurant on the crazy busy, discounted week, but even for that, Mooo showed its true colors of being an outstanding restaurant. I sat at the bar and was immediately attended to by two bartenders. They were attentive and quick, which was perfect for my lunch during the day. They started me off with rolls, which were fantastic. Even though I was having a 3 course lunch I couldn't get enough of the rolls. For the first course I went with the steak tartare - a heaping portion of tender, delicious steak, served with amazing flatbread. For the entree I had grilled salmon (I just couldn't take eating a whole steak after the tartare in the middle of the day) and I was definitely impressed. It was perfectly cooked and served on top of a corn salsa that I'll have a hard time recreating at home. Dessert was a cheesecake, tasty but not the star of the show.\\n\\nLast night, I suggested going back to Mooo for a little celebration. Every Sunday and Monday night they have a $35 prix fixe - pretty much the same as Restaurant Week. Again, the food and service were both outstanding. All 6 of us had the 12oz sirloin, each cooked to a perfect medium rare with a bone filled with bone marrow butter accompanying the meat. The starter choices were lobster bisque (incredible!) or two different, tasty looking salads. For dessert, the choices were the cheesecake I had last week and a brownie sundae. Again, good, but not the star of the show. A great part of the Sunday night deal was free valet parking, a huge plus when you're dining in the heart of Beacon Hill.\\n\\nAs I've said a few times already, the food and service at Mooo were exceptional. The normal prices definitely reflect this fact, so I'll be restricting my nights (or afternoons) eating here to Restaurant week and Sunday and Mondays. But I will be back, hopefully really soon!"},{"name":"So Crab So Good Seafood Restaurant","address":"3853 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Went there with a couple of girlfriends last week and we didn't know what to expect.

We were not disappointed at all. The barbacoa was well seasoned with great texture and not too greasy. The pastor was chunky and a little spicy and one of the best we've tried but definitely a multi napkin mess. The birria taco, which our waitress says they make with lamb, was fantastic. It's stewed with tomatoes, chilies and other good stuff and it comes out tender, juicy and delicious. The tortillas both flour and corn were good, they did their jobs admirably but really didn't add much else. Our tacos came with the traditional onion and cilantro and the salsas both had great flavor with a nice little kick.\\n\\nThis is another one of those places that we've driven past for years and we're both glad that we finally stopped. The tacos here were not small and the Bang vs Buck measure is favorable so Jazz and I are happy to give them a B+ as one of the best we've had so far. They're priced just above a $ so a $+ seems to fit them. \\n\\n¬†I realised after leaving in a taco stupor that I had forgotten to check on the vegetarian options so I'll have to go back soon and give an update.

Normally I'm totally cool with sarcasm but a couple of comments left the entire table quiet and slightly shocked. When one of my friends ordered a glass of red she immediately regretted that decision because the wine was not good. She asked if she could get a different glass of wine because she didn't care for it and even said that she is sorry and didn't want to be a pain.

My fiances Charlie bowl consisted of bland and soggy hash brown with overly dry biscuit biscuit through out the ham and what ever else there was in there.

The pad thai was rather bland - very skimpy on the chicken, scallions & crushed peanuts. The beef macadamia tasted more like chinese food than thai food. The chicken satay was heavy on the curry & about 1/2 the size of satay I have ordered at other restaurants. The vegetable spring rolls were meh. Nothing blew me away. Overall, I was underwhelmed. Both my friend & I felt we were eating thai food from a chinese restaurant vs. authentic thai food.

It was completely empty when we got there so I was already getting skeptical.  My first observation  was that the restaurant was very clean, down to the glasses and silverware, and the floors were spic and span as well.  My husband and I are mostly vegetarian so we ordered the edamame and Kho Pha (soup)(I think that's what it's called) as the appetizer.  Immediately, I noticed how fresh the vegetables were.  The soup was especially good and I ate every bite.  My husband ordered the yellow curry w/vegetables and I ordered the green curry w/vegetables for the entree.  Both were amazing.  Yellow curry is not spicy but sweet and a little savory (delicious), the green curry was not too spicy and had a great flavor.  Both dishes were loaded with fresh crisp veggies.  I solidified Thai Boo as my new fav Thai restaurant when I learned they have moshi for dessert.  Moshi is like ice cream, but its like a bean paste that has different flavors like green tea, strawberry, mango, and chocolate.  It is my absolute fav dessert when I eat out (I have no idea how to make it at home so I order it every time I see it on a menu).  Who knew Norwood had such great Thai food?

F. Krueger is really going to town on me.  Damn, his nails are sharp and no, I've never uttered that line before.  I finally give Freddie the slip with my Heisman like moves and make it back to reality (side question -- have you ever thought that dreams were actually our 'lives' and our waking hours are actually our 'dream' state?  No?  Oh, just checking.).\\n\\nI wake up in a complete pretzel (as usual), my arm is bleeding (I told you his nails were sharp), and I have the shakes.  Now mind you, I would be the worst needle drug user ever.  It's not those shakes, it's ... Po' Boy withdrawls.  Now here's about the time we cut away to Mr. Krueger with one of his clever little lines ... \\"Hey Poor Boy ... you certainly have yourself in quite a Pickle!\\".\\n\\nSpeaking of pickle (I'm big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid), it's really the delicious captain of the condiments here.  Other teammates include tomato, red onion (those of you familiar with my work know I'm going 'no onion' on mine), cabbage (I'm not comfortably saying 'slaw' here, it's got something going on there, but it's not lathered in mayonnaise), and a spring mix (ok, you caught me ... like I know what the hell a 'spring mix' is ... what I'm getting at is lettuce that's not iceburg).\\n\\nNow let's get to the proteins ... fish, shrimp, chicken, pork, steak ... I swear they have a secret tunnel underneath the trailer.  One way leads to the ocean, and the other way leads to the butcher shop!  You can get your proteins any which way you like 'em also such as blackened, grilled, fried, buffalo style ... there's really got to be over 50 combos so you're gonna find one or 9 or 27 or 50 that you like.  The variety of fish is wide and they will even throw you a curveball with some Marlin (Josh Johnson?).\\n\\nMy favorite is the blackened shrimp.  I have already alerted the commissioner's office as these shrimp are on 'roids or at the very least SGH (Shrimp Growth Hormone).  I just wanna take these shrimp to every mexican restaurant that serves seafood and say 'USE THESE!!'.  \\n\\nAre these po' boys authentic?  I wouldn't have the foggiest.  Don't you love how every review on Yelp for a mexican joint has to have the word authentic in it multiple times?  Authentically speaking, the authentic authenticness of the rice and beans confirmed the authenticity of the dish -- my grandma would authentically give her authentic seal of approval.  Easy there Aaron Sanchez (cacique ... autentico!).\\n\\nAnother option is to forgo the po' boy roll and have it inside a couple of tacos.  One po' boy = two tacos on the Turf N Surf conversion factor.  The tortillas are great as well so if you only eat tacos for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 4th meal, they have you covered.\\n\\nNow when I don't get shrimp, I go for the ... who am I kidding?  I've gotten shrimp every single time I've been down there.  I should be saying when I get more than one, one of my other choices is usually the pulled pork.  It's mango flavor ... there are no chunks of mangos in it, there's no sugary mango sauce all over it ... it tastes like the mango and the pork were holding hands all afternoon (yes, that's what I'm going with!).\\n\\nAs the other reviewers have opined (just had to get an 'opined' in there), the fellas here are very welcoming.  So head on over to Turf N Surf Po' Boy (fbook has their hours) and tell 'em the Cobra sent ya ... I'll be the handsome guy at the front table with the blackened shrimp Po' Boy ...\\n\\nHey Krueger ... put your dorky looking Fedora on and let's go grab some lunch ...

Anyway, we let the waitress know and she proceeded to argue with us for 10 minutes. and long story short, made us pay for it. We asked to speak to a manager. She said ok, waited 5 minutes and then came back and told us there was no manager there. Bizarre. We never send food back, but this was simply wrong and they made no attempt at making amends. Sad they'd lose really good customers (our family spends about $100/week here) over a silly $13 item. We told the waitress we'd be writing a review on Yelp about the terribly disappointing service.

Anywho, I also like their clams with basil which goes great with steamed rice and lotus stems.  Sometimes the lotus stems are not available so I get pea tips but pea tips is not as good - but they do make it up for quantity.  I tried fried squid and shrimp but wings were better.  I did not try fried frog legs and I do not plan to.  The chicken wing is a little salty and sweet with lots of garlic and when you dunk it to lime juice with salt and pepper, it quite simply is the best fried chicken wings I ever tasted.  The noodle dishes are diverse and quite good but still a side show from chicken wings.  I personally like their dried noodle which basically is rice noodle mixed with soy sauce and topped with either meat or seafood.  I usually get it with egg sunny side up and the yolk when broken goes well with the noodle.  Interestingly enough this place also serves a mean beef sashimi (cambodian carpacio style) and it is the whole plate.

I was up in the area with a friend from South Austin since she was looking to move up North.  We wanted to grab some drinks, some dinner and sit out on a patio.  We both start yelping the area and she found BB Rover's.  I said I hadn't been there in years but it used to be a pretty cool place, kind of like Flying Saucer, lots of beers, fun atmosphere.  Not even close to being the case.  It was a Wednesday night and maybe because it was SXSW week, there was a \\"band\\" playing.  There were about 15 people and my friend and I were by far the youngest there at 40.  It took a while for us to get acknowledged by the guy behind the bar but maybe because we're not regulars.  I ordered a Stella Artois and was told they were out.  My friend ordered a Japanese beer that was on the menu and she was told they didn't carry that beer anymore.  I started having flashes of Bar Rescue and thought this bar would never survive a Stress Test and I sure don't want to know what would come out of their kitchen.  I ended up getting a Pacifico and she got the only Asian beer  they did carry.  The beer didn't even taste good and it was in a bottle.  We were so uncomfortable and I was scared to uses the restroom, rightfully so.  As we were wrapping up and trying to stop noticing stuff John Taffer would have a fit about a guy walks up to the bar drinking a Stella.

Although not printed, the stone crab on shaved citrus ice showed a delicacy worthy of few. \\n\\nThen the venison steak as my entree, perfectly cooked and not at all chewy but still a little tough, seasoned well with just enough wildness in the flavor to know I was not eating buffalo or another lean steak. The wilted greens were another matter -- disappointing and too sour, needing just a touch of apple vinegar or more of the sweet puree beneath.\\n\\nI've come to loathe the delicate scoop of ice cream a la mode on desserts, as even with the tiniest of bites, one finds the frozen wonders do not last throughout the whole remainders of the sweets and this was no exception. About two thirds through the sticky toffee pudding -- and it's pudding in the sense of a British pudding -- I ran out of the vanilla wonder and then the sticky mess became way to sweet to bear.\\n\\nSo it goes that 4th and Swift lacks a delicate balance it can achieve with a bit more attention to detail.

I really like Asian style pork belly and the last time I got pork belly at a Western restaurant I was so disappointed, but this was delicious!

My bf ordered the catch in a bag which ended up being a 28 dollar large spring roll. It didn't have much seafood flavor to it since the fried shell covers up most of the flavor.

It's no surprise some of the best restaurants I've ever been to are here. But there's a problem. I live in Burnaby. So many great restaurants are deep within the Vancouver city limits which means I'm either going to have to make a long, frustrating drive or make the long walk and hop on the skytrain. 99% of the time I'm not going to make that journey. I'm lazy and would rather settle for something close by. However, Jam Cafe is that 1% that I will always make that long journey for.\\n\\nFirst of all, let me say that I love how small and quaint Jam Cafe is. It kind of works against it because it's such a popular place that since it's small there's always a huge lineup outside. But the small venue offers a much more intimate dining experience. I love the decorations. You feel comfortable and welcomed like you're in your own dining room. It's an incredible atmosphere you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else.\\n\\nI've been here twice for breakfast and I can honestly say Jam Cafe has provided me with two of the best breakfast's I have ever had. First time I went I wound up getting the gravy coupe and it may have very well been heaven on a plate. The gravy was absolutely delicious. The biscuits were soft and flavorful. The eggs were cooked perfectly. And the chicken. My goodness the chicken is what made the whole breakfast absolutely divine. The second time I went I wound up getting the Chicken and Waffles and it was just as good as the gravy coupe. I really like the chicken. Whatever seasoning they use is some of the best I have ever had. \\n\\nThe only real issue with jam Cafe like I said in my second paragraph is because it's such a small place that is incredibly popular you should expect to wait outside for a table for quite a while. Both times my wife and I went we wound up waiting in excess of 30 minutes. I don't have a problem with waiting, and Jam Cafe is certainly worth any wait but again, expect to be waiting for a while."},{"name":"Thai Express","address":"1900 McLoughlin Blvd","city":"Oregon City","stars":"4","text":"Horrible service.

We held our heads down in hungry shame as we wandered past each restaurant with a line pouring out the front door when I suddenly recalled that Liberty Glass was tucked away just down the hill!\\n\\nMy friend asked me what that was, I replied \\"triscuit nachos\\" to which he replied \\"ZOMG LETS GO\\". We made our way down to the bright pink house with wacky x-mas lights dotting the outside, people enjoying mason jar drinks on the front porch, no line to be seen on the sidewalk. SCORE.\\n\\nThe interior is faux hunter in the woods with a dash Grandpa's house on the coast. The curtains lining the windows are a tacky shade of retro dark orange. The bar has candles lit with vintage clocks ticking between bottles of liquor flickering in the light. You'll also notice a couple animal parts of former living animals nailed to the wall. It somehow all ties together with candle lit tables and chill music chiming in. Its pure Portland tacky chic.\\n\\nWe were seated promptly after stepping in the front door and given menus to browse. The food here is very very down home hearty. Think things like fried chicken with mashed spuds and a biscuit. I myself eyed the pecan buttermilk chicken with a wedge salad and a biscuit(in fact its what I did end up ordering). My buddy was intrigued by the appetizers. They feature tuna and anchovies stuffed eggs or other interesting items like home made onion bread with butter. \\n\\nThe food was presented to us with a little bit of a wait. I only saw one guy working in the back so it could had been because of that. It didn't matter really because the windows were open so that a nice little breeze could come in. We people watched while sipping our drinks. The wait was inconsequential because the food came and our jaws dropped. SAVORY. TASTY. YUM! My pecan chicken had crusted bits of pecans on top with a delicious batter that was pan seared. My friends fried chicken special looked straight out of a southern dream. \\n\\nI ordered a side of beets because I'm fancy like that, and I adore beets done right. They arrived slightly sweet, a little sour, and appropriately bitter like a good pickled beet should be. After we took a moment to devour our plates we asked for our bill. 2 entrees, 2 pabsts,1 gingerale, and a side was only 35 bucks altogether. For what we received this was an amazing deal. I can't wait to come back and sample the \\"Over The Rainbow\\" mac n cheese or the weekly special chili dogs.

Since when is Switzerland known for its exciting cuisine? I thought they mostly eat potatoes and cheese.\\" Well I guess I was right because that is also what they serve at Cafe Hibiscus, and not even good Swiss cheese at that.\\n\\nThe reality just does not live up to the hype and I am left to conclude that these reviewers are people who do not know anything about \\"European food\\" or \\"modern food\\" or possibly even just food in general.\\n\\nMy experience at Cafe Hibiscus was so totally average I am left baffled by the other reviews. We had a rosti (hashbrowns with bacon) for starters, then what appeared to be some bagged precut lettuce with the restaurant's patented \\"Swiss dressing\\" - which they make in house and sell and promote. I found a few shreds of carrot and an errant tomato fragment or two but that was it. And by the way, rosti is just hashbrowns. That's it. And not even great hashbrowns. (Try The Original Hot Cake and Steak House for GREAT hashbrowns, by the way). \\n\\nMains were weinershnitzel (wow, fried meat, how exotic and special) and goulash (okay, decent slow-cooked pork with saurkraut but honestly my crockpot can do the same thing!) with spaetzel. Potato salad and coleslaw rounded out the meal. It was like we were at a church potluck in Minneapolis or something. Scratch that, they probably make better potato salad in Minneapolis.\\n\\nThis review is coming across as very mean spirited but honestly my intention is to bring a little dose of reality to the table so other folks don't get their hopes up like I did and spend their birthday in a restaurant this underwhelming when they could have gone to eight other amazing restaurants in about a two-block radius.\\n\\nIf you want Grandma-style German classics I recommend the Berlin Inn, where at least they make fantastic deserts (try the apple streudel!) and their sausages are made and smoked next door."},{"name":"Urban Farmer","address":"525 SW Morrison St, 8th Fl","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We did end up having lunch at The Nines Hotel's restaurant Urban Farmer.

The main course grass-fed, organic burger with an english muffin bun was the size of my head, that we also split.  Hands down, probably the best burger I've ever had.

Their kind could be found frequenting such Gainesville establishments as Market Street Pub, the Dugout, Round Bar, Hogan's Heros - rarely any place with a greater than 3 beer selection on tap. They never backed down from a challenge for a round of darts and frequently surprised you with their skill even while visibly drunk. If there was one ACR in the place you always knew there were more coming; they flocked like birds. Rowdy birds who chewed tobacco. \\n\\nI bring it up because I've discovered that the special breed of characters that were the ACR are apparently not exclusive to Alachua County.

(I hope to go sometime, so if I ever do then I will provide a review of it after that potential visit.) For the time being, this review is for the food/service at the company's food truck, which is a regular at many area food truck events.\\n\\nSince I am so overwhelmingly drawn to The Crooked Spoon/Treehouse/Big Wheel food trucks, I hadn't tried any food from this company's truck until last Wednesday (7/6) at the food truck event at Firestone. I only tried one fish taco, just to see how it was. My verdict? Great! I can't remember which fish was on it - I believe I was told either tilapia or mahi - but it was enjoyable either way. The fish appeared to be breaded lightly and not overly fried, and the taco was filled with lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese and came with salsa and sour cream (or perhaps tartar sauce?). I put some sriracha and maybe something else on it, as well. It was very good. I'm not much of a seafood guy, but at least the tacos here are good. I can't speak for anything else on the menu, though the food must be pretty enjoyable to others since the truck is at most, if not all, food truck events.\\n\\nMy only uncertainty about this truck is the prices. I think just one fish taco is either $4 or $5, and if you get three at once then the price is $12. (Something like that; there's a discount for the more you order.) While the one taco I had was great, I'm not sure I'd pay as much for a singular one again. If you go here, the best deal is to buy several tacos.\\n\\nI may try some more food from this truck at some point soon.

The cuddle fish was simply a couple thin tempura fried pieces of fish. Also completely flavorless. They both were SUPER heavy with salt, which we noted because the overuse of salt was obviously an attempt to make up for the lack of flavor.  Main course was butternut squash risotto.

All but one of their original rolls sounded absolutely disgusting, and even this roll (I think it was called the brandy roll?) was only so-so. This was also the first sushi restaurant I have ever been to in which they did not give us a sheet to check off the sushi we wanted to order, so it was tiring and inefficient to just sit there and name every single nigiri sushi piece that we wanted. The restaurant was also way too dark for me and the bathroom was hilariously tacky. They seemed to have purchased the most complicated, fancy, ridiculous fountain-ish bathroom sink I have ever seen and placed it in a restroom that otherwise looked and smelled like a gas station restroom. The doors are broken, paint is chipped, barren floors, messy, bad smell.... but look at our fancy fountain! It was so out of place that it made me laugh.\\n\\nThe ugly: the service. At first I thought the restaurant was so cold because the air conditioning was up too high, but no, it was because the staff's attitude was absolutely frigid. Neither the host nor waiter smiled at me even once the entire time. The waiter was extremely awkward and not even slightly friendly. Then it took them over 20 minutes to bring my receipt back to sign after payment even though there were very few other customers there at the time. After waiting 20+ minutes just for the stupid receipt and my card (being 100% ignored the entire time), a host came back and threw the receipt book in my face and then walked away without saying a single word. No \\"sorry for the wait\\" or even a \\"here you go\\"; just absolute silence before running away. No one checked on our table the entire time, either. I wonder if the waiters here are forced to eat wasabi out of the tube before coming to work or something, because I have never seen such cranky, rude staff (especially at a higher-end sushi restaurant like this).\\n\\nSo, yes, the nigiri sushi was tasty, but not worth the horrible service.

It turned out to be bland fish wrapped in soggy rice paper. I should have sent it back but picked at it instead. The vegetables were overcooked and the \\"hoison glaze\\" was syrupy and much too sweet. I was totally disappointed! My uncle also ordered a fish dish and it wasn't much better. His wife had pasta dish, which was the most acceptable dish of the night. \\n\\nFrom this experience we all agreed the Asian fused with Italian just wasn't working.

During all that time, she did not come by to fill our empty water glasses, nor ask us if we wanted more coffee. She did however offer us one free bakery item to share since we were obviously hungry and verging on murderous rage. The croissant did the job to stave off the hunger pains but it did not make up for everything else that was going on...or wasn't going on.\\n\\nWhen the food finally came it was lukewarm and mediocre.

The experience of having your meat brought to your table is not worth a premium of $100 unless you plan on putting down 4 lbs or red meat in one sitting.\\n\\n...and water should never cost $10 without a warning up-front.\\n\\nAs a side note, the 3/5 star rating is solely based on this experience and not an average based on the first visit or 'up-rated' in any way for the great service provided by the corporate office AFTER our first visit.

When it did get going, there were not a lot of people outside of our group who seemed to be interested in it.

But really, it's a coffee shop/cafe, so I think I need to get over myself... Anyway, I digress.\\n\\nI met my friend at PG for breakfast this morning so his pup could run around before my pal took off for a work trip. I realized two things when I got there: I'd only ever had plain coffee at PG, and I didn't really realize that they had a full-blown breakfast/lunch menu. So, of course, I had to have something non-plain to drink and test out the nosh. \\n\\nI immediately ordered a soy capp when I saw \\"Cappuccino - 6oz\\" clearly labeled on the menu board. Nothing wins me over faster than a coffee shop that refuses to make a 20oz capp. I had scoped out somebody eating what looked like a sausage-egg-n-cheese bagel, but I couldn't quite pinpoint that combo on the menu, and I don't eat veggie-sausage, so I ordered the R-town on a bagel: egg-cheese-n-tomatoes. I saw that they had tofu options on some of the other breakfast things, but I didn't feel like a length \\"add this, minus this\\" order. I was just really freakin hungry and wanted to get the order in ASAP.\\n\\nThe cappuccino was great - good crema on the foam, nice and hot, just the way I like it. The bagel was good too - I recommend the everything bagel to bring a little excitement. It's hard to make a mind-blowing breakfast bagel, so I'll just leave it at yup, good. Hit the spot.\\n\\nThe patio is good for watching the dogs run around, and I'm glad to see they built up the fence and railings a bit to keep the rascals from invading your humans-only space. There were, however, an awful lot of flys, even though the doggie garbage bins were no where near the patio. Maybe it's just the heat...\\n\\nMy other (small) beef with PG visitors (not the establishment itself) is that it seems like some folks aren't very attentive of their dogs. Time and again, I've seen dogs do their business and no one comes to pick it up. I've watched people put their dogs in the run and then sit inside the coffee shop for an hour. It's kind of disheartening, and my canine-owning friends have voiced that they sometimes feel like babysitters for the pups with flakey owners. From what friends have told me, the new owners of PG have made huge strides to remind doggie parents to be responsible, and my friends have definitely seen improvement. I hadn't been over there in a while and yard looked like it was in a lot better shape than this time a year ago. Good work, new-PG-owners!\\n\\nOverall, it's great to have a super-dog-friendly place in an often anti-dog town. Definitely recommend the espresso drinks, need to try out more of the menu, and woud love to see a little better etiquette on the part of the dog owners."},{"name":"Jam Cafe on Beatty","address":"556 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing spot.

Their menus have changed, from what I had in Kerrisdale. They don't have kimbap, but instead, they have Salmon Salad. Instead of Dumpling Soup, they have different types of soups and bibimbap. \\n\\nToday, I had the Seafood SoonDooBoo Stew, and it was so delicious. It didn't taste as if they use the same broth and add different ingredients to distinguish different types of the stew...no, it tasted definitely like seafood, like it's supposed to. I was also surprised to find such a huge mussel in my stew, I almost cried in joy. Lots of seafood goodies were found too, like little baby shrimps and decently sized octopus bits. My friends had the Beef SoonDooBoo Stew and the BBQ Chicken. The BBQ chicken came on a sizzling hot plate, with pretty colours of red and green. Beautiful! And there were more chicken than the asparagus and tomatoes! \\n\\nThe family who was running the place seemed a bit flustered by the number of people in their restaurant. The daughter particularly seemed stressed out, so I told her that they seem busy and that it's good that they're busy. I also told her the food was good, and that I hope they do well too. She seemed to be happy to hear that, because she apologized for not taking good care of our side-dishes, and told me to come back during lunch hours when it's less busy for a better service (our food did come later than the other table who arrived later than us). \\n\\nI will definitely come back and try their other dishes!

We started with an order of chips and roasted tomatillo salsa which I found tasted overly smokey. Also $5 for chips and salsa!?! Between my boyfriend and I we had the achiote pork, chicken tinga, black rooster asada, and vegetarian tacos. The best was the black rooster asada because of the bacon.

My boyfriend and I shared the Gravy Cooper and the Cracker Jack, the biscuit that came with the Gravy Cooper is to die for. The chicken is quite tasty as well, it's not too juicy but it's crispy and well seasoned. It looks a lot like a chicken cutlet. We also ordered a side of hollandaise sauce and it was very good as well, will have to come back to try the Benny's. They have a large selection of savoury or sweet breakfast items as well as a good selection of lunch items. The entire menu looks extremely tasty. The Nutella banana French toast was quite sweet but it was very good too. The only thing I would suggest would be to maybe even share 1 breakfast item between two people because once we finished the Gravy Cooper, we were pretty much too full to even eat the Cracker Jack. The portions are huge here!! Oh and btw, you've got to try the Jam Iced Coffee!! It's so amazing, definately one of the better iced coffees I've had. \\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere here is lovely, I absolutely love the hipstery knick-knacks and signages on the wall. I appreciate when restaurant have themed decor. The music was also great, not your typical Top 40s but now 70s/80s music, it matched the theme of the restaurant very well. Very cozy too, love it! \\nService: The service here was quite disappointing, our server seemed uninterested in servicing us, it could've been because we came in pretty late, but we did leave just at 3pm, so that's kind of inexcusable.

I had heard about this place for years.  The general consensus was that it was delicious, but pricey.  When I suggested the restaurant my boyfriend sort of scoffed because he thought, \\"It's a chain, and it's in a strip center.  How nice could it be?\\"  Very nice it turns out and he was very glad that I suggested it.\\nWe had an early reservation at 5pm because I like to eat with the old folks.  LOL.  A little true, but more importantly we wanted to go see a movie afterward so we based our dining around the ETX showing of the movie.  \\nWe arrived about 5 till and the doors were still locked.  They were opened promptly at 5.  We were the second ones to be seated, but at least 15-20 tables were sat within the next few minutes.  \\nWe were seated in a quiet booth and I remarked how much I loved the classic steakhouse look of the place.  There is a lot of stained glass and etched glass.  There is dark wood paneling everywhere.  It has a classy old feel to it.  \\nOur server, Owen, was very attentive.  He explained the menu to us as we were first timers.  First he described the cocktails.  We ordered the Strawberry Basil Lemonade and Hawaiian Cosmo.  Both were delicious.  The Strawberry Basil Lemonade was especially fresh tasting with muddled strawberries, hand squeezed lemons, and fresh basil.  \\nOwen brought out all the different cuts of steaks for us to look at.  I really like when steak restaurants show off their cuts of beef.  It is usually a good sign, and it shows they take great pride in what they serve.  \\nWe decided to start with the Gator Bites.  These were the best gator bites I've ever had.  They were meaty and tender, unlike some places.  The batter was flavorful with a bit of a kick to it.  The sauce that is served with it was horseradish.  Because the batter was spicy I would've liked a sweet sauce to counteract the spicy, but that is just a personal preference.  The horseradish was perfectly good.  \\nWe were then brought out 2 small salads with the house Spanish vinegrette dressing.  The dressing was delicious, but there were lots of olives which neither my boyfriend or I are the biggest fans of and they were minced so difficult to remove.  Additionally, the salad had lots of diced tomatoes which is not my favorite.  \\nThe bread was a garlic cheese bread and it was delicious.  However, we never received any butter for the bread and our steaks arrived before I could ask.  \\nFor our main course we decided to share the Kansas City bone in strip.  It was plenty for the 2 of us considering we had salad, bread, and a good size appetizer.  The steak was delicious.  It was well seasoned and properly cooked.  It was delicious on its own, but there was this peppercorn sauce that made it even more incredible.  \\nThe price was high, but not when you look at the service that you are getting and the quality of food you are getting.  It actually seemed more reasonable than some of the other designer steakhouses.  \\nWe had a great experience and we will definitely be back.  Hopefully, next time I'll save room for dessert."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I have not had a day off together in some time and we wanted to make tonight a special one.

It was not cheap about $18 but, I got two tacos with really big pieces of swordfish in them, I could only finish one of them.

As much as this restaurant seems to be right up my alley -- meat and pies, how can you go wrong? -- I don't think it's going to last.  [edit] Wow, it's been open since '07?  Shows what I know! \\n\\nLet's start with the obvious.  Location.  It's particularly difficult to find, even though it's theoretically right on a major thoroughfare.   The signage is very small and the restaurant is tucked way in the back.  I could have driven past this place a dozen times without ever noticing it was there.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I did.  \\n\\nSecond, the hours.  This place closes at 8pm.  Sharp.  I'm a notoriously late eater, and I get that after 9pm, it's kind of difficult to find places to eat on a weekday in Austin, but 8pm is a little ridiculous.  Especially when you're this close to campus. \\n\\nHowever, I finally made my way over there in time to eat.   \\n\\nThe good?  Well, the restaurant presents itself well, it's nice inside and the menu is extremely well priced.  I think you'd struggle to hit $10 for one person.  Service is fast, since the pies are all prepared in advance, you'll be eating in just a few minutes after you walk in the door. \\n\\nThe food?  While I enjoyed it fine, there was absolutely nothing remarkable about it.   I tried my girlfriend's different meat pie and neither of us could tell one from the other, it was that bland.   I could eat here again without complaint, but I can honestly say that I'll never crave it or suggest that we eat there. \\n\\nAlso, as we were finishing up our meal and taking our last bites, we crossed the magical 8pm barrier.

Boloco seems to do a great job of being part of the neighborhood, keeping aspects of the original architecture, listening to their patrons, outdoor seating, engagement with the community.  I love that.  But the burritos taste like an anglicized version of a burrito, not the deliciously spicy and comforting meld of cheese, rice, beans and meat wrapped in a tortilla for easy consumption that delivers a full taste experience in every bite. These are not those San Francisco burritos that I first fell in love with.\\n\\nBoloco burritos are a little bland and dry.  Give me some cilantro and salsa to liven these poor guys up. The wrap is good and tight so that it doesn't fall apart on you, but the mojo just doesn't seem to be in the filling.  Boloco has a rotating special burrito like the Memphis this summer and the new Jambalaya.  Some say it's a wrap not a burrito, but if I can accept a California sushi roll then I'll allow Boloco to serve me a Jambalaya burrito and admit that it was good enough to bump my review a star.\\n\\nIf you are a fan, be sure to sign up for their customer appreciation program to earn free meals, get special deals on their new burritos, etc. It's well worth it.

But the addition of about 400 shirtless gay men to what is otherwise described as a hetero meat-market bar probably changed the vibe somewhat. And that's what I loved about it.  Ladies, picture it: \\n\\n*Instead of shoving off clueless, rhythm-less dudes all night, you're dancing with pretty men who know how to shake it - and you don't have to worry about them trying to get your number\\n\\n*Instead of having to try to ignore obnoxious cat-calls and artless pick-up lines from a crowd of apes at the bar,, you pass a line of attractive men waiting for their Heinekens who all tell you \\"Oh my god. I love your dress. You're fabulous.\\"\\n\\n*Every man is chiseled and has his shirt off, but it's not in the least intimidating\\n\\n*No line for the women's bathroom.\\n\\nThe other amazing thing was that the downstairs DJ seemed to have caught on very early that the place was under gay guerilla control - and proceeded to play every track from the gay music canon, from Madonna's \\"Like a Prayer\\" to RuPaul's \\"Covergirl\\", as well as old club classics like Amber's \\"Sexual\\".  \\n\\nThere were also some pretty amazing sing-a-long moments during Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (really? In a dance club? Amazing) and of course Kelly Clarkson's \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" which everyone belted out with major chops and a lot of jumping. My throat is still a bit hoarse from all the singing.\\n\\nAs my friend said, \\"this night is definitely going down in my Shake-it Hall of Fame.\\"\\n\\nAlso, I have to give props to the Harp for having Molson on tap (although they didn't have any on this night).

When we walked in the girl at the counter in the front demanded that we all pay a $10 cover even after the bouncer told her that he said there was no cover. We paid the cover without incident until one of our friends realized she didn't have cash which was fine one of us would cover her, so she quickly ran to the bathroom. After about 3 seconds the \\"security\\" went to hunt her down like she was a fugitive on the run and then proceeded to surround and intimidate her while ignoring the other people trying to hand them cash to pay for her.\\n\\nLater on in the night when it got a bit more crowded there were clearly belligerent drunks causing problems left and right while \\"security\\" just ignored them walking around carrying their invisible suitcases puffing out their chests trying intimidate people.\\n\\nBut the best part of the night was when I was waiting for my girlfriend to come out of the bathroom at the bottom of the stairs and then it hit me... It came at me like the security came after that girl earlier... It was SHIT. HUMAN SHIT. someone shit on the floor like just straight up said \\"fuck it this place is already a dump let me just top it off\\". \\n\\nSo after we realized that someone had just laid out a heater on the floor I notice one of my friends being dragged out the front door by the security thugs, and I mean aggressively dragged out and thrown into the street. Why was he dragged out? Because he took a picture of the shit on the floor. He was assaulted for taking a picture like the shit on the floor was a celebrity, he was the paparazzi, and these goons were the shits personal bodyguards. After we got the entire thing on video the security did a great job of letting some drunk kid in line randomly start a fight with me while letting another person in line punch someone in the face for no reason (they probably both got a job there after that) they just stood there and did nothing.\\n\\nNow on twitter they told me the shit incident wasn't a common occurrence, clearly they don't read the reviews about their own place. It also seems like the thug squad seems to be a common problem to. I'd give the bartender 5 stars though he took care of me and my friends the whole time even after it got crowded.

I had the duck quesadilla, a great idea and good dish (smoked duck, goat cheese, pickled veggies).  But the duck was over-seasoned (too salty), so when combined with pickles, it was a bit too much.  I'm a sucker for a good pimento cheese, so I had to get theirs, which is served with Saltines.

My martini was only about 1/2 full, not even 3/4.  If I'm paying almost $10, I would expect an almost full glass.  I did ask and she told me that's the size.  \\n\\nThe service was a little slow but the waitress was friendly and fun.  She was busy with a bunch of tables.  If they had a couple of more servers, it would have been better since there was an hour wait for tables.\\n\\nPrice and service could be better.  Maybe I'd give more stars the next time I go.

Selection is good, quality is good, but it all comes out how you would expect it at an establishment such as this.  The martini olives are stuffed with something - either garlic or cheese, I can't recall...good, but tiny olives.\\nAppetizers - unfortunately I did not try as many of the appetizers as most things ordered I do not eat (eg oysters, weird meat platters with congealed fat rectangles, tuna).  I did try a piece of bread and one shrimp.  OK. \\nDinner entrees - everyone at the table ordered a steak, except for me.  I had the scallops.  Ohhh my.  Sooo good!

They have a Wagyu (sp?) cut which was good and so many others that I tried that were good too.  Meat was tender (yes a tad salty as a reviewer below noted, but not disgustingly so~), juicy, and cooked well.  \\nSides - I'll only comment on one side: The creamy potatoes (or potato puree I believe is the technical term).  I don't know what they put in this but it's like a candy!  Not quite sweet, or buttery, but it is.

The items we ordered were, however, a bit hit-or-miss for a variety of reasons.  I shall specify.\\n\\nI ordered the shrimp and grits.  Not bad at all.  I prefer a bit more texture and flavor in my grits, but these were ok.  The shrimp were ample - like 5 or 6 large shrimp - flavorful and not overcooked.  The bonus was the addition of some breakfast sausage, very nice in my book - but I would suggest that the menu really needs to mention the sausage - lots of people do not eat pork and well, the menu should be accurate.  On that note, my wife ordered the omelet with a side of bacon.  The omelet was described as spinach and mushroom - the bacon as \\"honey glazed\\".  The omelet was actually also overflowing with very strongly flavored dill Havarti cheese - I like this, but my wife does not - and again, was not mentioned.  On to the bacon, the honey glaze was overpowered by a significant quantity of cumin - creative and strongly flavored - but not mentioned on the menu.  If you are averse to cumin (like my wife), an accurate description would have been helpful.  Finally, my sister in law ordered the french toast with fresh fruit.  She said that the toast was quite stale and was sogged by the addition of a large amount of cold ricotta (menu said the toast would be stuffed with honeyed ricotta, this was just a lump of almost frozen ricotta on top).  The best part of the dish was the fresh fruit (assorted berries).  If we go back, I think I would try the \\"breakfast panini\\" - the adjacent table was enjoying a couple of those.

I ventured to Marlow's Tavern on a whim one Sunday morning in search of some carbohydrates following an evening out on the town - it's quite possible that my expectations were low and my mental impairment was high, but I actually enjoyed my experience here. \\n\\nFood: The menu at Marlow's Tavern is comprised of casual American bare fare, including appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, and full-size entrees. During my inaugural visit, we started with the kettle chips with gorgonzola cheese and bacon - the chips were nicely cooked and the serving of cheese and bacon was generous. For an entree, I opted for the rustic grilled cheese, which was made with havarti, swiss, and classic mornay - the best part was the applewood smoked bacon and the butter-slathered sour dough bread it was sandwiched between. For a side, I ordered the hand-cut tavern fries, which were a greasy, coronary occluding delight.   \\n\\nService: All the staff were professional, courteous, and welcoming. Upon learning that we had never dined at the restaurant before, the waitress gave us an overview of the menu and offered recommendations. Shortly thereafter, the manager arrived with a complimentary order of kettle chips, which I think is their standard schtick for new customers. It was a nice touch and it worked - the added hospitality certainly enticed me to return again in the future. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior of this place was darker than a dungeon, but I'm not complaining because I looked absolutely wretched from the previous evening's festivities. Other than that, the set-up of this place is fairly standard - there's a series of raised booths and tables throughout, as well as a fairly expansive outdoor patio. There is an open kitchen toward the back, so the air was a little thick around the tables in the near vicinity. \\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced. Appetizers are $5-$10, sandwiches and burgers are approximately $10, and full entrees are generally $10-$15. \\n\\nOther: This location of Marlow's Tavern is located in the new Emory Point complex, directly across from CDC's main campus. The restaurant is centrally located in the complex, right next to Tin Lizzy's. Free parking is available for up to 2 hours before 5PM and 3 hours after 5PM in the plaza's parking garage.

We got there and a host appeared who I gave our name & reservation number.  This ordeal was foolish to say the least.  It was a somewhat chilly afternoon if one was in the shade, but he said that the only place to be seated in the near future was going to be on the patio.  I asked if we might be positioned in the sun, he told me that he could put me 'right there' and pointed out the seat for me.  I agreed that would be fine. He was going to get the table all ready for me, I waited.  2 minutes later, I noticed him seat another couple at our table.  Alrighty then...  A few others came in (no reservations) and he gave them the same 'so busy, only place is on the patio talk'.  Everyone was flexible and had groups the same size as ours.  Another group with a highly recommended reservation came in.  They were only going to need 7 of their 10 seats and were seated inside.  I asked if he might consider providing us with the extra seats that they were not using.  He told me that would not work, they were going to be seated at a large round table (there was NO way that 10 folks were sitting at that table), but no problem, I just waited.  He told me that he was scoping out a table for us, he just had to wait for the group to finish up with their checks & reset.  No problem, then he seated a group of older ladies at that table.  Soft spot for some older ladies who enjoy a good brunch, no big deal here.  THEN, there is another table that is open, he goes to sit another group that came in after me.  At this point, though he had been nothing buy polite, yet frazzled, I went to mention the fact that our table kept being given away to a manager.  He assured me that he noticed the same and asked him what the issue was.  He told the manager that I just kept harping on him about getting a table (HARDLY TRUE) and for the 5th time, he told the manager that he just needed a moment to 'take in the place' so that he could figure out how many tables they had left.  The manager was quite annoyed with him, I overhead the host speaking ill of me, but we were able to obtain an inside seat very shortly after that time.  \\n\\nI ordered the bottomless mimosas, they were OK, but only as bottomless as someone is willing to keep you filled.  I had the special of the day that was a salmon dish, it was tasty.  Our group shared the peaches & creme french toast, it was alright.  The chicken sausage & gravy was not as spicy as I have found it at plenty of places.\\n\\nWould I go back?  The wait staff was accomodating.

This place is open 24 hours a day, and has a full bar and wifi, that is v sick. There is also a wicked dance floor! I've driven past at night, and it looks pretty bumpin. We were a bit confused because 3 different waitresses came to take our drink orders and food orders. I ordered a Cesar, and brad had a coffee. The Cesar was awesome!!! Fresh celery and not too spicy. I had steak and eggs, it was great, the eggs were a bit iffy, but nice big portions ect... Brad had eggs Benedict and he said it was awesome. I recommend this place for anyone who isn't a snob.

So here is the deal:\\n1. Indian food is my fav (nxt to Mexican) food.\\n2. I am a vegetarian, so spices and authenticity matters.\\n3. I never had Indian food until I had Saag Paneer, so I base a lot on sauces.\\n\\nIndia Grill was the first Indian food I had in PDX. Since then...I traveled the city for amazing Indian...turning time and time again to our beloved Yelp in hopes I could find something more amazing tham the last Indian food joint. I've tried them all....and I have to say... many reviews really confuse me. I feel...they have better reviews because folks like shitty, bland, deep fried, poorly balanced food. Or perhaps it's conveince (think a popular SE Hawthorne joint, that has good reviews and I've been dissapointed in a number of times) ....but trust me....I wouldn't be writting this if I didn't enjoy, believe in or know authentic taste.\\n\\nWhile I will admit, this spot can be a lil hit and miss at times.... it's mostly a hit. The creamy, spicy, deliciousness of the sauces....the tenderness of the cheeses and meats.... are absolutely legit. This is a true family establishment passed down through the hands of hard work and tradition. If you like Indian food...I can honestly say this is one of the best Portland can offer...and I hope more ppl get a chance to eat some REAL Indian food ;) 7years behind me (in a rapidly growing city) has to be right!"},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"2306 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"1.5","text":"I've tried this location in the past and they messed up my order, my son wanted a burger so here we go again with the f*ckery from this location. I ordered my son a cheeseburger kids meal and myself a chili dog with the chili and onions on the side. The three cooks were cackling loudly over the food while in the background on the line like a bunch of hens. When the nice cashier turned to let the cook know that the onions in chili was supposed to be on the side, the three ignoramuses made fun of her trying to do her job and said \\"calm down killer we aren't even on her ticket yet!\\" I felt so bad for the young lady because of their lack of professionalism towards her and that she has to deal with that type of ignorance while working. Glory and behold I get my order and there is chili on my hot dog, and I have about five onions diced in a container. With my bus being four minutes away I did not have time to wait for another order, I asked for more onions, and once again I left this tasty burger disappointed! Maybe if the workers spent less time eating on the line, carrying on and making jokes in front of customers, and took a professionalism course on how to behave in the workplace the customers would have a better experience. I will be contacting corporate because I never have this type of experience while in the Fenway or the Back Bay locations only when I come to my neighborhood and deal with this location am I always disappointed with tasty burger.

My dining companion asked what the deal was with that and  I told her that you alwqs get free cinnamon rolls on the weekends. Next up was the Waldorf salads. I don't know where else to get this so I make sure I get it everytime. One thing I've always liked about Windward is that they'll make any combination you want. I wanted prime rib and walleye. It's hard to believe that a restaurant that specializes in seafood has such a good prime rib but it is. Perfectly medium rare with au jus and really strong horseradish. The broiled walleye was excellent. served with baked potato and properly cooked broccoli it was a great buy for around $55.  I wish the sevice had been better. Their no reservations policy means there can be a long wait to get seated and we ended up in the lounge. They offer the full menu in there but it was very cramped. That's not our server's fault but he left us alone for too long and without drink refills serveral times. He didn't bring me a knife to cut my prime rib and  my friend had to give me her butter knife. Good thing it was so tender!  Also, the salad came before the app but that's a minor point.

During our long dinner, there were a few more tables of younger people who came in but for the most part, the place never filled up as much as its food would suggest that it could. \\n\\nI saw a cute chalkboard that had happy hour specials written on it with drink and appetizer specials. Again, I was surprised because there was just something about this place that felt old and uninviting, so it didn't seem like a happening happy hour spot. I realized the issue was a drab interior. The chalkboard was really the only fun thing in the restaurant. Other than that, it was old prints and framed art, linens on the tables, and really poor lighting. It was dim and washed out. Not to mention the music -- it was simply awful. It was a terrible mix that had a few good songs in it. As we walked in, La Vie En Rose was playing but then later we had bad 80s ballads and even box office instrumentals. What the..?\\n\\nIf I could give this place a makeover, I'd focus first and foremost on the lighting. Warm spotlights to accentuate the funkiness and vibrance of the bistro would be great. Bring out the colors at little more. Mustard orange and bistro reds are great, but not if they're dulled out with poor lighting. Bring the funky artwork and serving accessories to the forefront, get this place feeling like more of a casual environment. Loved the chalkboard idea because it feels personal -- more elements like this would be nice. Secondly, I'd have them spruce up their music options. Play me some jazz, play something with a nice beat that keeps the overall mood and tempo of the diners up. You want to fill the place with laughter and conversation and liveliness which is contagious and recognized from passersby wanting to be a part of it. Lastly, I'd make the exterior a lot more inviting. French flag on the awning is so two decades ago. Let's get this place looking a little more homey and funky and warm. \\n\\nIf all that can happen, I think more people might get the chance to recognize how great the food here really is. We had the lobster mac n cheese which was incredible, and the steak frites which was great as well. We also had a cheese plate and a crepe suzette for dessert. With a few glasses of wine, we made this a lovely dinner that we enjoyed so much -- yet upon leaving and walking by Central Bistro up the road, we both said \\"Oh look how cute this place looks! Let's go here next time.\\"\\n\\nFood and service only go so far, atmosphere has so much to do with a dining experience as well."},{"name":"Carrabba's Italian Grill","address":"4675 St John's Pkwy","city":"Sanford","stars":"3.5","text":"This was my first time at a Carrabas Grill.

I'll begin by saying that I am a VERY finicky eater and see myself as something of a pizza connoisseur.  I ordered a 14\\" extra cheese pizza, a Beefini with provolone and chicken tenders with buttermilk ranch, delivered.  I went for the pizza first and was not happy.  It was, in my estimation, quite burnt.  After two bites, I decided to call Jumbo's to complain and request a replacement.  I was quickly transferred to the owner who was apologetic and promised to deliver a new pizza shortly.  In the meantime - I was quite hungry - I tried the chicken tenders, which I found rather dry and - to me - somewhat burnt; I think now, the dryness had to do with them being somewhat burnt.  A short while later, the owner knocked on my door with a new pizza.  I showed him the one that was delivered, and he was rather surprised I thought it burnt and informed me that he LIKED pizza that way and quite a few people did.  Nonetheless, he delivered the new pizza and apologized.  He also advised me that henceforth, if I ordered from Jumbo's, I should inform them that things should be \\"light.\\"  The replacement pizza was quite good, and the Beefing ended up being fantastic.  I know now that I need to request \\"light\\" when I order pizza or tenders from Jumbo's.  And I SHALL order from them in the future.  I was more than impressed that the owner went out of his way to satisfy a customer.

Even the burgers and fries, which is on the more casual side of this menu, are delicious. \\n\\nHere's where they lost those two stars; the service.

I just sat and waited and waited. The cooks had hot food in the window and were trying to get someone's attention to run it out. The cooks motioned over to me to ask if it was my food. It wasn't. Of course 15 minutes in we decided to leave but my friend had a tab for his beers ( he got there 20 minutes earlier than I did) but it was another 15 minutes before he could get the check and he had to get up and walk down to the bartender to even get it! \\n\\nThis sort of thing seems to happen a lot.

If you can't handle spice, ask for the sauce on the side.  \\n\\nWe then had our salads that come with all the steaks (a wedge salad with blue cheese).  I'm usually not a blue cheese fan, but damn was this good.  Obviously homemade dressing and the blue cheese was of high quality because it wasn't as potent as it usually is.  (however, i'm sure it wasn't on the healthy side)\\n\\nWe each had the filet, which were both cooked perfectly.  We shared a side of green beans and their mashed potatoes which were both seasoned great (not too salty/garlicky- is that a word?)

The waitresses are nice, I suppose."},{"name":"The Tardis Room","address":"1218 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Besides the English themed paraphernalia from pictures of London streets and British double decker buses, the establishment has upped its Britishness with BBC sci-fi notes by also adding in Doctor Who. All the napkin holders show a TARDIS \\"flying\\" through its side space. Posters and pictures remind you of various characters varying from Cybermen to K-9 and the glowing sonic screwdriver. Seriously though, there is not any bare wall in this place with the combined British memorabilia and Doctor Who collectibles scattered in every which and where.\\n\\nThere are life-size cutouts of a Dalek, and one of 10th Doctor incarnation David Tennant (who I call the \\"melancholy Doctor\\") and one of the current and 11th Doctor Matt Smith (who I dub \\"weird face Doctor\\"). There's a Dalek clock on the wall and bobble head of the 4th Doctor Who Tom Baker (\\"scarf Doctor\\") at the bar, while in the stage/tv room (where they of course play Doctor Who episodes on BBC America when they air on Saturdays. They also have live music and Doctor Who trivia nights), a lamp boasts a big blue TARDIS model base. The free-play pool room (with a single pool table) randomly plays Doctor Who sounds and Bad Wolf is scrawled on one part of the wall. The bathroom door looks like a TARDIs door. Thank god there is no Weeping Angel.\\n\\nThe Tardis Room Menu is basically the Fish & Chip menu, but with some Doctor Who references thrown into the title, such as \\"Sycorax Wings of Fire\\" and \\"Weeping Angel Onion Rings\\", or the only American options they have (burgers) are named TARDIS burger, Dalek Burger, or Davros Burger. Still lots of fried British pub style food, mostly variants of fish and chips in which you vary the fried fish type, as well as scotch eggs, bangers and mash, Cornish pasty, etc. If you are unfortunate enough to be a vegetarian, you are pretty limited as anything fried is done so in animal fat, so look to salad, vegetarian beans on toast, hummus, and mushy peas. At least, to eat. \\n\\nBeverage wise, besides the expected local tap selection, there are also a variety of British sodas and English pints. In addition, the full bar offers cocktails with Doctor Who themed names, such as \\"Sonic Screwdriver 10th Doctor\\" or \\"Sonic Screwdriver 11th Doctor\\" using whipped cream vodka and lemonade, with the only difference being the addition of either blue curacao or Midori between the doctors in cocktail format. A drink called Capt. Jack Harness of course uses Captain Morgan Rum and Jack Daniels.\\n\\nThe various seating is a mix of pub style wooden tables in dark wood and also couch-y lounges over a big communal table and and various rooms and little hallways that break up the space that overall makes you feel like you are in someone's British flat. As you would expect, this space is much bigger on the inside than it may initially appear (reference to the TARDIS of course). So, the end effect is that although this food is definitely not good for your arteries, it's a place of relaxed fun and you can feel community warmth and welcome. If you are a Doctor Who fan, you will love it here as you go crazy over all the little touches interweaved everywhere in the nook and crannies of The Tardis Room, and you know you are among others geeking it out along with you."},{"name":"The Liberty Glass","address":"938 N Cook St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"You know how sometimes you go out, you like where you go, you think, \\"hey, this place is alright.\\" It may cross your mind again in the future.

However, my curiosity was piqued, and a hungry friend and I went to check it out last night.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar. The bartender/server Jemima was delightful. She and one other guy round out the front of house staff. Jemima shared with us this information: Jason and Rose are the owners-- a brother and sister  team who worked at Crow Brow and Basement Pub respectively--and they work back in the kitchen. They designed the whole menu and the decor of the place. (All cups-bowls-plates are those lightweight camping blue speckled dishes. Clever without being precious.) The place is cozy, with live music some nights. The front porch is smoking, and even that looked welcoming. (!)\\n\\nThe menu is seasonal and includes meat, veggie, and vegan options.   We split the Bruschetta with avocado spread and fresh tomatoes and the Vegan Pot Pie with seasonal vegetables and a Phyllo Dough Crust. I stayed away from the Mac and Cheese since I was eating vegan-ly, but the woman next to me was raving about it. It's served with a cheddar and pepper biscuit and small green salad. All the ingredients on the menu are seasonal, most are local, and some are organic. \\n\\nAs for the drinks, I tried the \\"Ghetto-Gria\\". You'll have to go check it out. I won't ruin the surprise.\\n My friend Shelley got a home-made Kombucha pear drink. Sassy.\\n\\nALSO--get this--Happy Hour every night from midnight til 2:30. $1 off all liquors and beers. Wha?! What a great idea!\\n\\nMy goodness. Jemima was a platinum blonde treat, the atmosphere was so cozy I never wanted to leave (and indeed, I came back a few hours later for a nightcap, dragging another friend with me); the food seasonal, varietal, and filling; the drinks creative, and...

Can't remember the full names of anything I had, but here's what I can remember in very non culinary speak, thai style spiced catfish, some kind of olive toast with a soft boiled egg, kung pao brussel sprouts, chile relleno, soft shell crab with bacon, mediterranean style calamari over toast, fried chicken sandwich, fried oysters with collards, and pork belly wrapped pork loin with root vegetables. My favorites were the the fried oysters and calamari.\\n\\nSo I don't want to say the food is overpriced, because I think when you go to a restaurant like this, you expect to pay, but I will say that portions were inadequate and inconsistent. It was my husband and I dining and we both left not hungry, but definitely not full. Most of the dishes are anywhere from $14-$30. There was a lot of inconsistency in portion sizes among different dishes and I really didn't see the dishes costing more yielding bigger quantities. Sometimes the contrary. Some dishes were 2-3 bites which is a little annoying. Even tapas/dim sum style is going to give 4-5 bites a plate generally. I don't mind paying, but if you're dropping $18 on a dish and sharing it, you want a good 4-5 bites. Our total bill was $142 (included 2 drinks), so after tip you're looking at just south of $200. \\n\\nSecond biggest con would be that I don't feel like enough food is brought out. Some things you see you want on the menu and it'll be gone before the chef gets to your table. I absolutely hate this! I at least want to be guaranteed I'll get what I want, especially for the price. The service was definitely slower because depending on the dish, 2-3 come out and then you wait for more to be made, so it's a lot of waiting for the food. At times you'll be sitting there with nothing to eat. Really a bit of marketing genius as after waiting for so long you'll take anything that's offered to you next. This was probably the biggest con. Just imagine seeing a dish you want, it's on the menu and watching everyone else snatch it up and you never get to try it. It's totally like Milton and the birthday cake in Office Space. \\n\\nTips: \\n \\n1. Don't come super hungry. Portions are small. Look at this as more of a tasting experience.\\n\\n2. Be prepared to wait for the food to come around and don't be disappointed if you don't get it. It's not like traditional dim sum where the dishes are hot and ready and BAM at your table all you want.\\n\\n3. Along with number 2, be prepared for a longer dining experience, thanks to the staff and chef's, it's sure to be a pleasant one!"},{"name":"Fuji Sushi Japanese Cuisine","address":"1449 Lee Rd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Favorite sushi place!

She didn't know?  Not that she didn't know if it was working, but she really didn't know if it even existed.  Okay, turns out they don't have wi-fi.  I checked.  Then I asked to use the restroom.  They sent me back through the kitchen.  Like in the kitchen with the bakers.  I thought that was pretty sweet.  A complete lack of pretension.  Nothing to hide whatsoever.\\n\\nThe food and coffee were excellent, and I like the wood tables/ interior.  So they didn't have wi-fi, and regardless, there were no outlets to plug my laptop into anyway.  Whatever, I'm the jerk.  I should probably stop staring into that screen anyway and pay attention to my surroundings a little more.

I was told that the beef was grilled but aside from it being tender, it had nearly no flavor whatsoever - not even salt. The beans were the same, just a pile of sorry looking beans. I had to use a good amount A1 sauce with the beef and a generous dose of chili powder + garlic salt for the beans. House salad just looked like pico + some onions + a bit of greens. \\n\\nConclusion: \\nDefinitely disappointed in my dish due to the lack of seasoning but willing to try some other dishes before completely writing it off.

Service was great, Daniel handled our communal table well and I always have a soft spot for restaurants that never let your water glass go empty for long.\\n\\nFor just being two of us, I think we did a good job of trying most of the current menu as we accepted every dish minus the whole fish until we started to slow down at the end.\\n\\nHam Hock Rillette - Most notable component was the delicious peanut gravy, which really made the dish.\\n\\nSeared Scallop - Our first dish, good flavors, but unfortunately, you only get one scallop per dish (which is fine since there were only two of us).\\n\\nBroccoli and Cheddar Rigatoni - One of my favorites (although I'm a bit of a sucker for cheesy dishes) with homemade pasta.  A heavier, richer dish, but very well done.\\n\\nBison tartare - One of my wife's top dishes of the night.  For me, a bit heavy on the bleu cheese, although I've never been a huge fan of bleu cheese.  The grapefruit added an interesting texture and the crisps that came with the dish were great.\\n\\nWinter Greens Tart - I think the dish was prepared well, but I just wasn't that into it.  \\n\\nLobster Terrine - Another wifey favorite. A decent amount of lobster and the greens that came with it were tasty.\\n\\nFoie Gras Torchon - Haven't really seen any reviews on this, but this was hands-down our favorite dish of the night.  Prepared by the executive chef, Joey Ward, the foie gras dish was a perfect juxtaposition of hot, cold, crunchy, smooth, sweet, savory rich, and more.  Not served in the typical foie gras loaf format, the dish worked very well.\\n\\nBanana Pudding - As many other reviewers have indicated... just get it, you won't regret it."},{"name":"Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET","address":"1110 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place.

The spicy tuna roll was nothing spectacular, but was a larger portion (10 pieces) than I typically see for the price.

They have a nice simple (not overly fried seafood) menu with a well round beverage program. \\n\\nThe lobster roll literally was one of the best I've had. The perfect amount of mayo and sweet lobster on a nice toasted split top bun.  Very authentic with the drawn butter. I probably could have eaten two. The buttermilk dress house salad will not leave you disappointed in case you decide to pass on the fries.  Usually salad is a overmarked up item at any restaurant and side salad usually is spartan in it's presentation and taste.  The buttermilk dressing and salty pecan with mixed field green paired well with my meal and my fiancee's tacos.\\n\\nThe have a great deal of reasonably priced beer and cocktail options such as $5 margaritas made with the good stuff and craft beers for around $3. They don't skimp out on this area either and serve a margarita in a whimpy tumbler. \\n\\nThe service and ambiance is a nice upscale touch to an area that desperately needed it.

I had sworn off of Jumbo's since my first experience but after moving to the area, I decided to give it another shot. Equal levels of disappointment still exist. \\n\\nI ordered for delivery a small cheese pizza and regular sized bacon cheese fries. The delivery driver called and was frustrated that he couldn't find my building in my apartment. He was on the wrong side of the building and hung up abruptly when I told him I would meet him on the other side while empathizing that the building was confusing. I met him in the parking lot and he shoved my food at me and walked away.\\n\\nI'm not sure what method Jumbo's uses for their bacon cheese fries, but I couldn't even finish them because they were so burned on the bottom. The bacon was very thick and gummy and the cheese was congealed and stringy. Additionally, the size I received for $6 was no bigger than a small index card. The pizza was extremely runny (although the sauce was delicious and light - I will say that!) and cut without care into 4 small slices. For $10, I expected a little more. My entire order came to $23 for two items and it was absolutely not worth it. \\n\\nThere are so many better (and cheaper) options in the area.

In my experience, Wolf and Bears is more of a \\"Portland-Hipster\\" fusion cart than genuine Middle Eastern. In fact, on their website it states that they feature \\"Middle Eastern inspired vegetarian fare.\\" \\n\\nWolf and Bear's falafel is grilled, not deep fried, or at least it was when I was there. It's nicely flavored, not anything amazing, but nice. The grilling keeps it from being overly oily, but allows it to retain a nice crisp edge. \\nThe grilled eggplant featured in most of the entrees is sweet and well-cooked, and in my experience pairs nicely with the tahini sauce and greens. The hummus isn't particularly special, but isn't at all inedible, and doesn't overpower any of the other ingredients either. \\n\\nThe last time I was there, late November 2015 I believe, I ordered the Lentil Soup (not on their website so I'm not sure the exact name). The menu stated that it was a winter-specific dish, so if you're coming in the summer I wouldn't get my hopes up about its availability.\\nIt cost me $5, which is a fair price for a cup about 4.5 inches in wide. The soup itself was hearty, especially for vegetarian (vegan?) fare, and thick with lentils, potatoes, and tomatoes. It was faintly sweet (from the tomato perhaps) and slightly spicy. It filled and warmed me up impressively and I'd recommend it as a good option for a cold day. I believe it also comes with a side of bread for one or two more dollars. \\n\\nIn terms of wait time, my soup got to me very quickly. That wasn't entirely unexpected since it was probably made in advance, but it was pleasant nonetheless.

We checked the breakfast focussed menu, spotted some tasty evening items and asked for a table and that is when our IHOP experience went downhill. Our server quickly took our 'no coke products' drink order and then vanished, reappearing 15 mins later with drinks..ready to take our order...2 chicken tender and fries meals, one Philly steak sandwich with onion rings and a BLT with fries. Whoosh ... Our server vanished again ! We quietly slurped our semi-flat soft drinks whilst risking whiplash looking around to see where our Harriet Potter wizard server had evaporated too...20 mins later two chicken tender meals arrived...hot tenders but cold soggy sad looking fries, clearly undercooked and horrible - hard to understand how any kitchen would allow customers be served such disgusting food. As soon as Ms Potter had come she was gone... Once more we scanned the IHOP landscape for Harriet P but alas no sign, time marched on and we waited for the remaining two dishes to arrive, when they did we pointed about that the fries resembles cold noodles and not hot fries, Harriet said she'd bring back fresh fries.we started into our meals, the Philly Steak sandwich was fine, however the onion rings were so deep fried they were a health risk, with nearby cardiac wards staying on standby ! The BLT sandwich was cut by Edward Scissorhands, one half of the bread in triangle the other square, no mayo (ran out apparently) one slice of tomatoe and a lettuce leaf ... Yum ! 20 mins later our new fries arrived hot but stodgy...rounding off a very poor meal that cost $50 ... Hard to believe the cost, poor food and service and we won't be back. IHOP ?

Honestly, I think I was expecting so much from yelp reviews that it ultimately led me to be disappointed. First let's start with service. Service was great! 5 stars for that. The lime margarita-like drink was also five stars. So good. What ultimately makes me give only 3 stars is the taste. For the price and reviews I was expecting tastier food. Salad bar was good, especially the salmon but the meat strolling around left me disappointed. All of it was a bit too salty for my liking and some of it a bit too rubbery/tough. I'd say the pork and beef tasted like it was seasoned only with a little too much salt and I'm from a family that tends to over season everything so that was shocking. I don't know maybe I'm just not an all you can eat meat buffet person but I really have to admit that the food was lacking and I was pretty disappointed.

The best thing to do is to check out their specials menu before ordering off the regular menu. I do this most places that I dine but most of my favorite dishes for Winter Park Fish co have come off the specials menu board. I haven't been coming as often recently except for maybe a lunchtime $2 fish taco on Tuesdays. They have changed quite a few things since I was there last. Now, you wait to be seated and you order from your table. Gives it a different vibe but I wouldn't say it's better. There's something so charming about ordering at the front and having the little fish with your name written on it. They still bring by the little plate of tuna or salmon dip with crackers. It's always really good and one day I might remember to buy a small tub of it to bring home and snack on. \\nSome favorites from the regular menu:\\n-Appetizer: conch fritters and crab cakes, both really moist with a fresh crunch to the outside so it's not mushy.\\n-Sides/Salads: their Cesar salad is magical! I never would have thought something as basic as a Cesar salad would blow my mind, but it does!  Last time I was there I got the Cesar with a spring lettuce mix because they were out of romaine and it was even better. I will probably do that from now on. The dressing it so zesty and peppery. Also the hush puppies are the best I've ever had in my life. We almost always leave with a to-go order and end up eating them in the car on the way home. Same as the conch fritters, moist inside with a crunchy outside but they are covered in powdered sugar!!! I'd recommend eating them as a dessert because they tend to be on the sweeter side. \\n-Entree: Hands down best on the menu is the grouper cheeks. My dad made these when I was a kid and they are the closest to his that I've had in Florida. it makes a difference that they are so fresh. I've tried them at a few chain-ish restaurants and the texture is all wrong. The fish platters are always amazing. You choose your fish and how you want it cooked and choose sides. Can't go wrong there. I don't have anything against fried fish but I wouldn't suggest it here. Their blackening seasoning is too good to get your fish fried.

I can't begin to pick a favorite.  They're all excellent, fresh, flavorful, large portions with a perfect balance of meat, veggies, and sauce. And if you ask for spicy, they will make it spicy.  The default is somewhat mild though. \\n\\nPrices are in line with other similar restaurants; I can get out of here with a large meal for 2 for around $25.

They were friendly about it but unfortunately all they could give me was very cold tomato paste or something. Terrible - guess that is why they don't do sauce.  They may say tomatoes as a topping and that  may be what they use to make up for no sauce, but I only got like two, so it did nothing.

Charley's on OBT used to be one of our favorites, but we had never been to Charley's at Parkway, Kissimmee.  We decided to celebrate our 52nd anniversary there.  Since we had such good memories of the old Charley's, we were expecting a wonderful experience.  I made mention that it was our anniversary when I made reservations.  I also told the hostess and our server, expecting they would ensure we had an excellent dining experience.\\n\\nWe had a nice, quiet table (romantic) which I appreciated.  Our server was attentive, but the overpriced food was disappointing and that is putting it mildly.  The Lobster bisque was served with pieces of swordfish rather than lobster.  It was good, but I did order LOBSTER bisque, not swordfish bisque.  The salad was wilted.  I didn't eat mine.  \\n\\nWe ordered steak and fully loaded baked potatoes.  My steak was cooked to perfection, but served cold, as were the potatoes. My \\"loaded\\" potato consisted of a very cold potato with sour cream and cheese.  We asked about bacon bits and chives, which the server promptly brought to the table, but did nothing about the \\"cold\\" potato (also lacking butter).  In that we paid an extra $10 for the potato, you would think we would have an enormous, fully loaded \\"hot\\" potato.  The steak alone was $48.  \\n\\nWith these kind of prices, I did expect an acknowledgement of our special occasion.  No such acknowledgement.   It was a very disappointing evening at a very high price.  We will not be back.\\n\\nA further note:  Our friends also celebrated their anniversary (the same week) and went to Charley's on International Drive.  I do not know the details of their evening, but as we were sharing our experience with them, they said their experience was not any better and they will not be returning to Charley's either.  \\n\\nWith so many wonderful steak houses in Orlando, at their prices, Charley's definitely needs to up their game."},{"name":"Bertucci's Italian Restaurant","address":"14 Elissa Ave","city":"Wayland","stars":"2","text":"How can a Bertucci's location with such bad reviews be so full on a Saturday night?

Sadly, this location is incredibly inconsistent.  Roughly half the time the food and/or service is outright bad.  Not just subpar, but BAD.\\n\\nJust last night I placed a carry out order.  They called to let me know they were busy and it would take extra time to prepare the order -- OK.  When I arrived at the revised time, my pizzas were already in the warming window yet it took an extra half hour for the other entrees to be ready.  Not only was I annoyed to wait there that long, but the \\"fresh\\" pizza was just sitting there getting old for at least 30 minutes.  When I got it all home parts of the order were missing.\\n\\nLong waits aren't uncommon, nor are missing items.  Other bad experiences have included burnt chicken piccata (really!) and cold food food arriving at the table cold (sure, the manager insists everything is made to order but an entree can't delivered to the table three minutes from ordering -- even before the complimentary soup -- and be cooked to order).  \\n\\nEven on the occasions when it's not bad, the quality seems lower than other locations.  I can't imagine why Bertucci's can be so consistent elsewhere but doesn't care enough to raise the standards in Wayland.

We started the night with the Croute Emmental which is a traditional Swiss dish with toasted bread topped with mushroom cream sauce, ham, and Swiss cheese.  This was a fabulous appetizer very rich in flavor and the melted cheese with the creamy sauce was just to die for.  We had a nice simple yet light salad tossed with a Swiss dressing.  If you like vinegar dressing then you'll like this salad.  For our entrees, I had the Emince Zurichoise and my friend had the Weinerschnitzel.  The Emince Zurichoise is made with thinly sliced pork saut√©ed in mushroom cream sauce served with Spaetzli.  The mushroom sauce is fabulous and creamy and the Spaetzli is buttery and sort of tastes like fresh pilaf.  I highly recommend trying this dish.  My friend ordered the Weinerschnitzel made with lightly breaded chicken cutlet with lemon with Spaetzli.  The chicken cutlet was light with a hint of fresh lemon flavor.  It was wonderful and went well with the Spaetzli.  Overall the food was fantastic but what makes this place so special is the staff and the people.\\n\\nService was prompt and very friendly.

Finally, we settled on the sketch lil sushi place hidden in a discreet corner of the Toco Hills plaza. Not in the mood for sushi, and distraught that we couldn't find this supposedly epic sub place (I still havent been) I ordered off the korean menu in the back, first off because it was cheaper than the sushi, and secondly because the (dak dori tang) that I ordered involve potatoes, and I'm all for starches disguised in vegetable form. Also, I love spicy food and the description was something along the lines of \\"spicy chicken stewed with potatoes\\"\\nMinutes later, to my surprise, they bring out banchan. I did not expect this out of a random japanese place that just so happens to have korean food in the back of the menu. Even more surprising, their korean potato salad is one of my favorite things ever. No joke. I always ask for extra and they always give it to me as banchan are refillable. I the blend of potato, apple, mayo and whatever other vegetable they have floating in this suspension of goodness. you just have to try it to understand.\\n\\nAbout twenty minutes later, and five refills of potato salad later, the dish comes out. Bubbling, red, and beautiful in a traditional korean stone pot, me and my friends are amazed. It looks like something that my mom would make. That I would eat at home. Lots of stewed chicken (good pieces too, an assortment of dark and white) covered in the red spicy goodness, hearty flavorful potato chunks cooked to the point they melt in your mouth, jalapeno peppers, and onion in a great spicy red stew. It has the korean spicy taste but with a more substantial flavor that reminds me of chinese food almost.

I have also had their Beef Achiote and it's so good. The meat is so tender and juicy and it also has their sweet plantains in the bowl with some chips. I think it could use some rice or something to soak up all the juice but it's delicious regardless. Speaking of plantains? Just order a whole side. They're that good. Lastly, I dig the kale salad. I added the beef when I went and although the additional protein makes the price a little steep, they give you a TON of it so to me it's worth it.

I can't help but go with the compare factor.  You will know why...\\n\\nI live in Seattle and have been frequenting Panera for a few years now after they came to the region.  With one friend in particular I'd say these visits were pretty regular.  Recently, that has changed.  The newest Panera in Seattle opened on Broadway in Capitol Hill and it is consistently a bad experience in most ways.  Everything from the food to the service.  Needless to say, the experience at this Panera Cares Cafe has restored my quickly declining faith in this eatery.  \\n\\nTrue story, but I'd began drafting a letter to corporate describing my recent visits to the new Panera I mentioned.  After visiting this cafe, I scrapped the letter.  My partner & I were greeted by who I would assume is the store manager and she took it upon herself to explain the concept of this particular cafe.  I had already read several news articles on them, this one and 2 other Panera Cares in the midwest, but it was good to see her so enthusiastic about it all.  In fact, it caused us to 'donate' more money!\\n\\nThe food was as good as I could have hoped for on any visit to Panera.  I always get the Sierra Turkey Sandwich minus the onions, greens & sauce.  Totally plain, I realize, but I have them add Swiss and then I add regular mustard.  I was able to do all of this with no problem and enjoy some delicious iced tea.  The weather was so good that we ate outside.\\n\\nMy only complaint about this location, nothing worth taking off a star, is the fact that the door to the patio locks from the outside once you enter the patio.  I figured this was to prevent theft?  Anyhow, it made it difficult to refill beverages or re-enter the cafe as you then had to use the main entrance.  \\n\\nIt was so wonderful that I can't wait to go back!

Where was it? =( The dish wasn't terrible, it was still edible and I mean, you can't go wrong when there's crispy chicken. It was really medicore, nothing I would come back to. I definitely prefer Rod Dee's (Brookline) Indonesian Fried Rice over Nud Pob's.\\n\\nAnother day after hours of studying and being extremely famished, I decided to give Nud Pob another shot so I ordered a Pad See You with chicken. It was okay. The soy sauce that they used was overly sweet for my taste and I couldn't finish the dish. A friend of mine ordered the Pineapple fried rice and loved it so I suppose Nud Pob does have some really good dishes, depends on what you order.\\n\\nI probably won't be returning to Nud Pob often. Especially when I know that hands down, S&I to-go in Allston and Rod Dee is a thousand times better tasting and better value."},{"name":"Laughing Planet","address":"1720 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very busy when I arrived to order lunch.

Wait time is OK--usually 30-45 minutes, as stated--but I get the feeling they are overwhelmed with their delivery business, and they have screwed up my order a few times. However, they have remedied a couple times with free wings or garlic knots. I've also dined in a few times; service is sometimes slow, as the always friendly register person is usually on the phone taking delivery orders. Nice to see the displayed art by local artists on the walls.\\n\\nThe wings and tenders are above average--I usually get rochester gold (mustard BBQ), teradactyl (teriyaki BBQ) or medium buffalo. Small orders (8 wings $6.59, 6 tenders $7.49) are correctly priced.\\n\\nThe pizza is pretty good, altho overpriced. Have not had the personal (10\\"), but the regular (14\\") is basically a small--enough for one person. A regular cheese is $9.49 plus $1.50 per topping; my regular pepperoni and sausage is $12.49--excessive for basically a small pie. (I can go down the street to Pini's and get two slices for $4 and be just as full.) Better to get the jumbo (18\\") at $10.99 plus $2 per topping--for a few bucks more, you have two meals.\\n\\nOther recommendations: Little Italy sub (mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, oregano, olive oil and balsamic) is a good deal at $5.99, as is the upgrade with chicken at $6.79. Burger is good, as are the fries. Buffalo chicken caesar salad ($7.98) is excellent, and very filling. Garlic knots are great; I'd upgrade to 12 for $5.99.\\n\\nNOTES: In a nod to Somerville's place as the origin of marshmallow fluff, Jumbo's offers a fluffernutter for $3.49. So +1 for that. Also, the Su/M/R special of 1 two-topping jumbo pie and small order of tenders for $19.95 is outstanding value--basically three meals in one."},{"name":"Dalo's Kitchen","address":"1533 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Hello!!! gluten free injera here....\\nI love this place... \\nThe food was delicious...

Food is wonderful, ambience and experience is amazing. The hand washing, the decor, the belly dancing, all great. The waiters had seemed a bit less than hospitable; maybe it's the culture of the restaurant? Wanting to be unintrusive somehow so it feels more authentic? \\nMy feelings towards them completely changed and I pegged myself wrong about their attitudes and started to think rather highly of them when, many years ago I went to meet a date there and, while waiting, had some of their delicious mint tea. My date ended up stuck in traffic and so I left. I tried to pay for the tea, but they said it was on them. Very nice of them and I always felt good about them afterward. \\nThat is until several years ago when I joined a large group for a friend's birthday. My friend had told them several days in advance how big a group we were. They crammed us into a small area, where some people literally were back to back at the round tables. My friend ended up downstairs by accident, looking for the restrooms and found it empty. She asked the sever down there if we could move our group down there and was told we were welcome. She then relayed to our waiter our decision and he told her we could not move downstairs... At one point the last stragglers of friends to join us ended up sitting at a small table nearby as there was no more room at the cramped tables. They were separated from us, which wasn't fair. They knew how many of us there were prior to us coming and based on their attitude towards us, they seemed displeased we were there.\\nOne member of our party had to relay to our waiter her drink request 3 times before it was brought to her, despite others getting their drinks timely. \\nAt the end, payment was chaos. People literally started going to the front to pay and get the hell out of there as we had been there TWO hours and no one was coming with bills. \\nThat being said, my friend had paid a deposit of $200 to make a reservation. After the other guests had left, she went to pay the last part of the bill and found they hadn't kept track of the few people who left already and paid by cash. On top of that, the $200 was supposed to be applied to the total bill (or refunded, I can't recall which) and is wasn't. So she over paid... What kind of business are they running?!?\\nThe cherry on top of it all was when she and the person who had to ask 3 times for her drink were pulled aside and told our group was very rude and we were not welcome back. Soooo asking to have our group size adequately accommodated seating wise after giving plenty of prior notice and requesting a drink is somehow rude??? Huh, guess next time we should make a reservation at a restaurant then if we expect those kind of things. I don't know what we were thinking!!\\nWell my friend moved away and was recently back in town. She wanted to get together and give the place another try. I vowed to not go back there due to the outcome of our last visit, however since it mostly happened to her and she was willing to let the past be the past, who was I to say no? Our group of 5 arrived at 9:15pm. They close at 10pm per their website AND sign in the door. I don't want to be one of those people who arrive at closing time, but that was 45 minutes before... Shouldn't have been an issue. The waiter told us: they. Were. Closed. Didn't bother arguing; who would trust eating the food after that? We just left. It's sad that honestly we just accepted that kind of service without even thinking about it. That's how poorly we think of their service. Now, even if someone invited me back there, I would never go. I drive Uber and have had people ask me for recommendations of where to eat, even specifically about Marrakesh. I always make sure to let them know to avoid that place due to the poor service. Maybe they should have their waiters go through customer service training or something. Or maybe they are under staffed and could stand to hire some more people so a waiter at the end of their shift doesn't feel the need to shoo a big set of customers away. \\ntldr; food and ambience are great, but not worth the bad attitudes of the wait staff and subsequent poor handling of large groups."},{"name":"Tamarind Indian Cuisine","address":"12309 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic Indian food!

The meats were all very bland, and all though they brought different cuts around, they all had a similar salt lacking, burnt flavor that made it hard to differentiate the Top Sirloin from the flank or the pork. The salad bar is gorgeous and it was different that they brought 3 warm plates of appetizers included in the meal, all of which were also very lacking in flavor and not worth the money they are charging for the meal.

It was busy even for a Tuesday night, but we were seated relatively promptly and set about ordering cocktails.  My husband had the best Old Fashioned he's ever had, and even not being a bourbon drinker myself, I fully concurred! I had a drink that came out with a beautiful purple orchid (Pacific Vice, I think?), and it was delicious.  As for the food - well, it's hard to get too detailed, as the menu changes weekly and my experience won't be yours.  To me, that's a fun concept.  I enjoyed that the dishes would come out and each chef would describe to you what they had made, giving you the chance to grab it or pass it up - but you only get one chance!  It's a lot of fun!  My friends had a hard time saying no to a chef's face, but you have to get over that or you will order EVERYTHING on the menu and end up spending a ton!\\n\\nWe probably ordered and shared about 6 plates between us, some that we split 4 ways, some only split 2 ways, and then we ordered 2 desserts.  I left quite full and satisfied.  The bill came to just under $200 for 4 of us, but my husband and I kept to 1 drink apiece.  \\n\\nThe food is beautiful and is intricately prepared, and it's fun to watch them create these dishes in the open kitchen.  I didn't mind so much sitting next to strangers, as they kept to themselves and so did we.  Our server was great with any questions and encouraged us to ask.  The one downfall, I think, is the unbelievable level of noise.  It's just SO loud in there, very poor acoustics.  Even sitting across the table from our friends, there were often times I couldn't hear/understand what they said.  It would definitely be a tough place to really talk and get to know someone or catch up with a long-lost friend.  Way too hard to hear.  But other than that, the vibe is very cool and relaxed, and the high-quality execution of the dishes can't be beat!  It's special food.

Body [concisely describe the food, ambiance, and service.

Order anything with tomato sauce and you will be satisfied: chicken parm, lasagna, ravioli, or just plain pasta.  If they have the pasta fagioli, definitely try that as well.  I have not tried the pizza, but I hear it is also very good.  \\n\\nThe ambiance is best described as clean and basic.  Dining-in is like eating in a sandwich shop.  Good for a weekday lunch or an evening when you just want some simplicity.  Not a date place, unless your date is just really into homestyle Italian food.  I typically use Francesca's as my go-to takeout place.\\n\\nThe service is great.  The owner, Joe, seems to always be there and makes sure everything is taken care of.

Was seated at a booth with a dirty table. Uh we should've just left then. Its my fault I didn't call first to make sure they had crawfish BECAUSE they were out. Our waitress, bless her heart, tried to offer sno crabs as an alternative. Obviously she's not a crawfish lover. They don't even compare. She also said they offer boiled shrimp but not by the pound. They come either in 6 pieces or 12 pieces. Lol that made me chuckle. I've had their fried shrimp before and its breaded, previously frozen and yucky. We ordered crab cakes and grilled shrimp with steamed vegetables and red potatoes. I asked what was in the steamed vegetables and our waitress said broccoli only. Its a good thing I like broccoli, cauliflower and carrots aka steamed vegetables (not broccoli only). The red potatoes and veggies were not seasoned. The grilled shrimp were blah. The crab cakes are a minced meat mess with corn added. The only highlight of the night was the pitcher of beer we ordered. Time to go to the restroom. OMG! When was the last time someone cleaned it?!?!?! 1 stall had a broken toilet seat with urine still in there. 1 stall (with the changing table) had NO toilet paper. It's a good thing I looked at the open changing table because toilet paper and paper towels were there for my pleasure. Washed my hands.

On top was what I can only describe as a Graham/toffee crumble base with chocolate truffle and dollops of torched marshmallow. Topping it all off was a vanilla ice cream infused with cherry wood smoke. It was like campfire s'mores amplified 10 times. Over a week later and we are still talking ( and dreaming) about it.

I usually tend to not like it when the alcohol is over bearing the flavor but this was a perfect mix. \\n1. The wait. I was wondering how the chefs kept track of which table they already went to and which they didnt as well as who they went to first. We got the first dish pretty quick, but had a lapse of nearly twenty min before the next. Along that time both parties on both sides of us had two chefs come to them, and one included ones we didnt get yet. It seems there is a floor manager that takes care of everyone and directs the chefs to tables the chefs missed, and definitely props to him for handling so much.\\n2. Price. The portions were reallllly small with no complementary bread/rolls to help and you dont have an option to order sides either. We ended up spending $170 including tip which was a lot compared to other quality restaurants for the amount that we ate. My bf was still hungry at the end and... for me, if it wasnt the dessert, i wouldnt have been full either. I get the concept, and it was nice trying a lot of different dishes.... but... could be priced a bit lower. \\n3.

My advice would be to arrive early and pick a table especially if you're going with a big group of people. Restaurant is okay sized but can get very crowded. \\n-Wings - I've had better. I was really excited to try their wings because of all the hype. We tried Jose's Spicy Sauce and it was just a weird texture and taste overall. Some people may like it but I think I will stick to other places for wings. \\n-Beer list on menu is not accurate. Make sure to ask your server what all they offer and what they don't offer.

I understand when a restaurant switches it up and does dinner when it's used to a different ebb and flow that there's a learning curve. However this is month 4 of SIMB offering dinner and I've gotta say I expected more. The food was pretty good, not as spectacular as what we had for a tasting, but to be fair this meal cost $50 not 5,000.

We ordered General Gau's bean curd (it came out as gloppy, corn starch ladden vaguely orange-flavored sauce with rubbery tofu), spicy chicken with garlic sauce (this one had some flavor, but was mostly huge mis-shapen pieces of bell peppers with gloppy corn starch-thickened sauce), and noodle dish that was supposed to have a peanut sauce.

Walking by, I always thought this place was upscale and pricey, but not after stopping in. It's a very casual atmosphere with reasonably priced food. There were no issues with having my two young daughters and my dog sitting outside. It did take a while for our waiter to come out (10 minutes) which made us nervous. When he did finally come, he was super helpful and friendly. He was honest about what his opinions were of certain things on the menu and was friendly to my kids/dog. The food was excellent as well.

The food is freshly cooked, and not overly seasoned with any particular sauce or spice (unless you want it hot!), There is a good selection of reasonably priced entrees ($10 - 20 range).  Diners are given a choice of vegetarian, beef, pork, chicken or seafood entrees and curry dishes.  Our favorites (so far) include:   Appetizers: Spring rolls, steamed Boo dumplings, seaweed salad (!!); Soups: Wonton, Tom Rha, Tom Yum; Entrees: Tamarind duck, beef masaman curry, Pad Thai (great!), and pork Thai basil.  Entree portions are adequate; however, the dessert menu is mostly limited to sticky sweet rice/ice cream dishes.   Wine and beer are available.  Thai Boo also has good ambiance: Instead of jamming tables next to each other, management has spaced them far enough apart so you can easily engage in private conservations.  The lights are usually dimmed slightly, and there is no annoying background music.  Above all, the service is excellent; you may have 2 - 3 friendly servers providing the food and drinks, clearing dishes after each course, and checking to see if anything else is needed.  Because of its increasing popularity, reservations are recommended if you plan to dine after 6 PM. To save money, watch for Groupon coupon deals up to 50% off their menu prices.   Thai Boo is only 15 min. south of Dedham Legacy Place and rte 128/rte 1 interchange, and there is plenty of free parking near the restaurant.

To start, the place was slammed at 4:45 pm, but we figured we had plenty of time before our 8pm ghost tour.  We put our name in and were told to expect an hour wait for patio seating...\\n\\nFor the next hour we watched the group of hostesses (for some reason they needed 3 teenage girls for this job) to stand at the door and confront every potential guest with the bad news that the patio would be an hour wait, but \\"you can be seated inside immediately.\\"  An hour quickly became  an hour and a half, and then two hours....and then oddly three and a half, even though almost no one put their name.  I got the feeling that they WANTED people to leave.  One guy called them on it, which was awesome.  He said, \\"I don't think you want my business.  I asked about the wait, you said an hour, and I tried to put my name in anyway.  But you said, 'It's going to be an hour and a half' now.  That's just rude.\\"  And he walked out.  The three-headed-teen hostess didn't know what hit her.  Might have been the highlight of the evening.\\n\\nTurns out they only had 5 tables on the patio that night, a wedding rehearsal dominated the other potential tables.  And since they have a policy not to ask guests to leave, these five tables were occupied by the same people for over two hours each.  Took forever to get in, and I understand having drinks, dinner, more drinks, and then afterdinner drinks...but come on, a dozen parties are waiting.  Someone should have stepped in and done something.\\n\\nOne last thing on the hostesses: cab driver comes in saying someone had called for a ride.  They look at him, blank stares, as if he's speaking French.  They don't bother to check with the bar tender, even though there are three of them, and the bar is about twenty feet away.  Felt bad for the cabbie as he walked awkwardly away.\\n\\nFinally get a table, waiter realizes everyone's a little frazzled, and is very cool to us.  I have a prime rib sandwich in ciabatta bread, med rare - amazing.  The garlic mashers are also top notch.  Drinks were pricey, $10 for a basic mixed drink, but a few girls kept coming by with free samples of fruity concoctions.  The girls got a kick out of them.  Live music was nice, and the weather was perfect.  The \\"view\\" was a little disappointing...a little slip of water with boats docked.  Nothing like the Lobster Pool in Rockport.  So we waited a long time for a mediocre view. Decent selection of beers on tap...about $4-5 a pour.\\n\\nAll in all, the food itself compensated for the service and generic \\"waterfront\\" view.

For my app, I got the sweet corn soup w/ chorizo & cilantro oil - nice comfort choice, made me feel warm & fuzzy, but honestly after a few sips, I got bored. I thought it tasted a little bland.

We took advantage of the bread 'cone' and there was nearly a fight over the cheddar biscuits!\\n\\nAppetizers: our table had a couple of the butternut squash soup, the artisanal cured meats, and the Brussels sprouts with north Georgia apples. The charcuterie plate was a selection of four different kinds of pork with several mustards and breads. Our table enjoyed all of them and I hogged the delicious pretzel roll! The Brussels sprouts were mine, though, and they were delicious. I am not a vegetable girl at all, but the cr√®me fr√¢iche and apple cider reduction but a wonderful spin on them. They were perfectly cooked and sliced, with the apple slices in between making an excellent combination of both texture and taste.\\n\\nEntrees: We all had a pretty difficult time deciding on our main course. The menu had too many good things and quite a variety of them. Mine was the seared George's Bank diver scallops, and what an excellent choice! These were simply the best scallops I have ever had away from watching them go from the boat to the plate at the coast. Tender and savory, with a brown butter sauce and parsnips, each bite was better than the last. The duck breast was also good, but the other highlights were some of the main dishes from the Market menu. These change daily, and ours included grilled swordfish and several others that while I can't recall them now, they were indeed delicious.\\n\\nFor desert we asked about the bacon ice cream and indeed, my boyfriend was able to get \\"the last serving\\" for his birthday. We all tried it and it was certainly interesting! A rather good melding of salty/savory and sweet. He loved it, of course. We tried most of the deserts on the menu. Favorites were the sticky toffee pudding and a tarte tatin. The only one I didn't care for was the donut holes, which I thought were a bit heavy.\\n\\nThe service and space: Everyone there was friendly, courteous, and smiling.

Atmosphere - I loved the look of 4th and Swift - it has a very industrial and clean look, plus the bar looked awesome.  They did what they could with the outdoor section, but you can't do much about the construction going on around you - not a pretty view, but a quaint outdoor area. \\n\\n2. Service - We were seated around 8:30pm outside and noticed that there were 3 other tables of people around us. We're a very talkative couple and we spent a lot of time looking over the menu and deciding what we wanted to order...but then we realized that nobody had been to our table to take a drink order or greet us. We're pretty easy going people so we waited for another 10 minutes or so, figuring someone would come out at least for one of the other tables. I could see the people around us fidgeting too...I think they were in need of service or the check. At 8:50pm, I went inside to find a server(I know, who waits 20 minutes to say something? Passive people like me!). I asked the first person I saw if there was a server outside, and he immediately came out to take our drink order. It was nice of him to jump to our service so quickly, but he wasn't very friendly and didn't seem to apologetic about us having to wait. After ordering our drinks, we waited another 15 minutes to get them. We almost considered just having a drink there and eating at Gekko Sushi anyway, but the man assured us that the service would be fine for dinner. And it absolutely was - after ordering our dinner, a new server never let our drinks get low, checked on us consistently, and was quick to get us anything we needed. They redeemed themselves, but still didn't apologize - plus, at these prices, you shouldn't experience any bad service at all. \\n\\n3. Drinks - We both got Dirty Martinis with the blue cheese stuffed olives - mmmmm. Some people just can't get a dirty martini right, but 4th & Swift has it down. \\n\\n4. Appetizers - We wanted to try something out of our comfort zone, so we ordered the Braised SFF Rabbit and the Wood Grilled Octopus.  The Braised SFF Rabbit was good, but I was too busy stuffing down the octopus! I loved the flavors - it had an AMAZING smoky flavor that I just couldn't get enough of. The meat wasn't chewy like I expected and the mushrooms were the perfect consistency. I would love to just go to 4th & Swift for a dirty martini and the octopus for cocktail hour! Oh, and of course the amazing bread. This bread basket was dangerous...especially since it tasted like a cross between a pretzel and sourdough bread with creamy butter on it. Absolute heaven. If I had to rate bread baskets in Atlanta, this would be top 3. \\n\\n5. Dinner- I'm usually full after appetizers, so we decided to just split the Wood Grilled Wagyu Flank Steak. I thought the steak was pretty good, but I'm not exactly a steak expert and I rarely order meat.  The BF thought that the steak tasted exactly like the octopus flavors - I'm sure because both were wood grilled. He didn't seem too impressed, but he didn't dislike it either. The mushrooms, bok choy and steak all had kind of a one-note flavor and all just tasted like different consistencies of the same flavor. It was good, but it would be nice to get some different flavors and textures to accompany the meal. Overall, it felt very heavy and rich throughout...with no relief even from the greens!\\n\\nIt was a neat experience to try something new, but I don't think we'll be singing 4th & Swift's praises any time soon. We'll probably only come back for a cocktail and one appetizer - maybe next time we'll try dessert!"},{"name":"Brewed Awakenings Coffee Roasters","address":"16318 SE 12th St, Bldg B","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Early Sunday morning, about 7:30am.

The interior of the restaurant (which used to be Hiro Sushi, one of the better sushi places in the area so when that closed down I was always going to hold it against the next restaurant coming into that space) is charming, relaxing, modern, and very well done.  It's very cool and chic.  The service is really quite nice, very friendly and accommodating, not perfect but certainly passable for a fine dining establishment.  The food itself is good.  Not awesome or outstanding.  But good.\\n\\nNow let's get to the flaws.  My waiter was a little on the neurotic side and my wife and I just never clicked with him, he felt a little strange instead of inviting in our interaction with him, but that's just one waiter.  The menu is overpriced IMO, and as I said before the food although is tasty, is not worth the price in any way.  My wife's tuna appetizer was mediocre at best the peanut noodles she got could have come from any take out chinese food restaurant, her salmon entree although cooked properly was just boring and overpriced just because there was a \\"lobster ragu\\" meaning a few chunks of lobster sautee thrown on top of the plate.  My salad of spinach and king crab could have come out of a trader joe's container (just insipid and lifeless, a cold lump of overcooked king crab unseasoned with baby spinach leaves that just felt a little tough, in a boring miso dressing that tasted like it could have come out of a bottle) and my main course of braised ginger short ribs with pan fried noodles although was delicious, was plated messily, and to be honest would have made anyone asian cringe with the amount of sauce they slathered on the dish (which is bizarre since my wife's salmon dish was dry as a bone).  All the dishes were messy in plating.  It wasn't sloop on a plate, but it certainly wasn't beautiful to look at either.  \\n\\nDessert was okay, the meyer lemon cheesecake my wife had looked a little too airy for her liking, my dessert was delicious but wasn't exactly inventive (it was caramelized bananas with glorified ice cream with toasted coconut and macadamia nuts).  Cocktails were above average but at $12 a little steep for what you get.\\n\\nThe one big problem I have with this place is unnecessary pretentiousness.  There's nothing wrong with having a swank dining room, a great staff, but when the food doesn't match the decor, alarms go off in my head, and when I noticed that some cocktails on the menu cost $69 (that's not a typo), the wanna be pretentious alarms really start to go off.  I'm all about high quality liquors and I know the costs, but when I was reading the ingredients, it shouldn't have costed that much (or even half that much).  \\n\\nI have a serious problem with high end restaurants that serve Asian fusion cuisine.  I never liked Blue Ginger for the same reason, even if you elevate the cuisine, it's still in the end flavors that many people are familiar with at significantly cheaper prices.  I can get a fine authentic Chinese meal of equal or better quality in food but the atmosphere might suck but it'll cost me half or more less.  Why should I pay double the price for a meal that takes the same flavors but just dresses it up a little?  And in Maxwell 148's case, it's not even that dressed up."},{"name":"Vino Vino","address":"4119 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I checked out Vino Vino this weekend and was pleasantly surprised by the snazzy food in spite of the fact that I always thought this place was just a wine bar.\\n\\nThe good?\\nWe came at prime time -- say 7:30PM on a Friday -- and our service was awesome. The place was packed but I called ahead about 30 minutes in advance and they had a tabled reserved and waiting.  Our waitress recommended a nice little cheese plate and it was de-lish!  The cheese plates, in fact, were really interesting.  Ours was goat cheese with roasted potato and lemon.  Another was a soft cow's cheese with pecans, honey and squash.  I'm down for any addition of veggies and this was an interesting way to incorporate them.  Our party of two had the gnocchi and the scallops. The gnocchi was totally unique and was the highlight of the evening. Instead of the traditionally boiled mess it was finished on either a grill or pan-finished. It had a nice crust on it. Super good.  The scallops were fresh, good sized and nicely seasoned.  The portions were actually quite large. We took some of each item home.\\n\\nThe bad?\\nThe place itself  is somewhat bland. Again, the food and service are good but the decor leaves a little to the imagination. It's actually a really big, spacious room, and could use a little modern art touch if you ask me.  Parking is a bit limited and the prices are also a bit expensive for main entrees.  \\n\\nI will go back to Vino Vino but when I do I'll probably stick to the smaller plates or share a bowl of the gnocchi."},{"name":"Swiss Hibiscus","address":"4950 NE 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"We went there and we love their food and food is champ we will come back we met owner and Chef Jeanie she is so nice person"},{"name":"Figs by Todd English","address":"42 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I love Figs!

You can split the pizza and get two types. My favorite is the calamari. You get an insane amount of calamari to cover the pizza. I was hesitant about the lemon aioli at first because I prefer my calamari with plain lemon and marinara sauce - but the lemon aioli really makes the pizza. It is super crispy and delicious.

I think it is because when you go out to a dinner as an event perhaps you expect more.  Their bread is very average-- again, maybe its my expectations, as I wanted something thicker, more Italian-o and with a nice chewy crust-- the bread was fresh and good for what it was, but it certainly was a disappointment.  The egg-plant parm was very very good--unusual that a place can make one better than I can :-)-the Lobster Diablo was great, sauce not creamy enough, though--but only eighteen bucks??  Seriously, how can you beat that?  The pasta was okay, the red sauce was tomatoey, with a little basil, but not that great.  In the long run, if I hadn't been expecting better they might have gotten four stars with my main criticism being the bread.  The house wine was good--I can't remember what bottle we got in addition to the house wine (sick that I remember the price, though :-) but that was very good.  As it should have been.

My friend and I didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into, but we don't regret it at all. As soon as we sat down, the dishes started coming quickly. Some of the chefs really sell their dishes and some of them just tell you what it is. We usually ended up going with the more persuasive chefs and we were not disappointed. But we always found it hard to say no. For some, it will be as much an emotional as it is a culinary experience. The beer, wine, and cocktail menus are fantastic, but we went simple to avoid our tastebuds being overpowered by alcohol. My favorites of the night were a veal, soft shell crab, asparagus dish and also a dish with oyster mushrooms fried in tempura. There was a lull in dishes appearing when we got towards the end, and we never even saw the mysterious duck bulgogi. We went with the classic banana pudding for dessert, which is made to order. As someone who normally gets banana pudding with my barbecue, I can tell you there were no vanilla wafers in this pudding. It was both delicious and beautiful. \\n\\nI would definitely go back, especially with the changing menu.

Also, if you go into Moonstruck you can get a card from them with discount codes for 20% off Opera tickets. Think about that, friends with good taste, Opera and chocolate??!! Yes, you need this in your life. Also, their cafe is still just amazing. They had this gorgeous strawberry champagne cake in the case but I stuck with three bags: dark chocolate blueberries, sea salt and chocolate covered roasted hazelnuts and dark chocolate marcona almonds. But then I found two perfect Oregon/Portland themed cards from local artists for my family back east. I was ready to pay and determined also to ignore their orange creamsicle milkshake. The husband had to get his two needs: Mayan Mocha (yep, iced coffee with their Mayan Hot Cocoa added)...I hate coffee and I LOVED IT! He then found some chocolate bark with sea salt caramel and some kind of nutty crack. With our 10% off we were stocked up on all of the things for $28!! I refused to look at the cases but I have a friend who usually give me Moonstruck chocolates every year and boy do I adore him! \\n\\nPro Tip: This little chocolate cafe is VERY conveniently located.

This morning it was Bumblekiss that saved me from the depths of hangover hell (it was a manishevitz night last night).  This super small cafe seats maybe 10-12 people total, mostly broken down into tables of 2.  The word cozy gets thrown around a lot, usually people say cozy to mean a small space that feels comfortable, and in that regard most people could rightfully call Bumblekiss cozy, however it was too cramped for my hungoverness this morning.  On the upside there was no wait when we arrived (12:30 on Saturday) and no line formed the entire time we were there.  In the summer I am sure this place gets crackin with that sweet looking patio outside, but it is currently winter and the outdoor seating isn't covered or heated.\\nThe food is healthy, good quality, pseudo hippie style typical breakfast and lunch fare that is both delicious and pretty forgettable.  I had some pretty tasty cinnamon swirl french toast that delivered some super thick slices oozing with sticky sweet goodness.  My side option was a tiny portion of bacon and cheddar omelet, that really didn't do anything for me and before I could decide whether I liked it or not all 4 bites of it had been consumed.  Coffee was 2 dollars and our waitress did a great job keeping our cups filled, same story with the water.  The prices were just a tad above reasonable, but they certainly are keeping with the small time Portland breakfast scene.  I think my french toast was 9.50.  I left full, happy, and no longer hungover, which is the perfect recipe for a successful neighborhood breakfast spot.\\nI would advise against a group larger than 4 as there is simply no way to seat that many people in this establishment."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ok, after reading other yelpers I knew that the grits and biscuits should be the highlight of my meal and they were.

BUT I did expect a much larger restuarant especially since these chains are so popular.  It seemed like they crammed all these tables and chairs into this little facility. No wonder the wait time is atrocious. Once we were finally seated, our area was cramped but as I looked around everyone else was a little cramped too.

A lot.\\n\\nI also like nice pleasant buffet joints for late lunch so I can relax with the paper, not rush, and have a little of this and a little of that.\\n\\nHaveli is an odd bird in Inman Square's Restaurantopia area. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but they have an amenity that is very rare indeed in this neighborhood: a real parking lot in back! I don't drive, but still noted that.\\n\\nWhen you step up (yes, there is about a 1/3 flight of stairs to get in, and several steps to get down into the dining area) and in, you are transported to another world.\\n\\nThe entire place is uniquely covered, floor to ceiling, and I do mean the ceiling, with lovely pieces of Indo-Paki textiles of various sizes and colors, mostly warm colors, with the very necessary tiny mirrors sewn in, very popular in the Middle East, too. Women go on shopping trips to India from all over the ME to buy their fabrics and textile products from silks to these cottons and linens.\\n\\nLaid out like a big sunken dining room, there are half a dozen banquettes, half at the big windows (glorious natural light for dining? yes!) and a long central \\"group dining\\" table with 2/4 toppers strewn about semi privately. At first I thought this an odd arrangement, but after many visits, it's quite utile and well thought out. One can fade away in the background while others are the center of hubbub.\\n\\nThe waitstaff is one Nepali fellow who takes a while to warm up to and vice versa, but he's a nice guy and can be chatty once he realizes you're not a douche, with a quick smile and welcoming wave to sit anywhere you like.\\n\\nHe's very attentive, my dish is always cleared quickly, my water is always full and I'm always asked if there is something I want or need replenished. That deserves a decent tip, so I do.\\n\\nThe food is simple: There is always a Palak (spinach) dish, with or without Paneer (cheese) that is rich, but not oily, and not too hot for newbies. The food overall is spicy and flavorful but not very hot at all and ideal for newbies to Indian dining. There is usually a mixed vegetable affair with curry or other sauce, there is always Tikka Masala (tikka-chicken, masala-spice blend) which is Tandoor Chicken (tender, moist, always there unsauced, too) in a sauce of tomato, ghee (which is probably olive-oil based, if I recall this chef from another restaurant years ago, so not heart-attacky) and a little cream with the rich but not very hot masala. It's quite smooth and plentiful, so take extra for dredging.\\n\\nDredging? Yes... the veggie Samosas (potato/pea puffed pastry) are usually very good, not as spicy as I usually like, but again, great for a newbie, and the onion Pakora (a deep fried \\"ball\\" of lentil/wheat dough with onions and spices) are also usually very good, not too greasy, and both are deeelish dredged through the masala that you are hereby ordered to put extra of on your plate or in a small bowl.\\n\\nThere is always ample Basmati rice, simple, usually a lentil or chick pea dish, and usually two kinds of Naan, the delicious flat bread that is really quite good here, not greasy, and sometimes a bit crispy one side and nice and chewy the other. Very nicely done. Sadly, no parotta bread, but that's a lot of labor (flaked layered butter fried flat bread).\\n\\nThere is a cut salad veggie tray to pick what you like for a salad or garnish, the usual table salad ingredients, fresh, with lemons, a nice tamarind sauce with a wee tiny kick, a nice yogurt sauce/dressing, a decent onion sweet/hot chutney and a decent, overly simple rice pudding for dessert, sometimes with these decadent little rice dough with sugar syrup treats I forgot the name of, with just a touch of rosewater in the syrup.\\n\\nThe food temperatures are correct, everything is usually quite clean, and bonus: Indian/Pakistani/Sri Lankan dance music videos playing on a tv over the buffet, the music ebulliently (usually) audible everywhere, though not overpowering... but I ask for them to turn it up when nobody else is around. Fun stuff!\\n\\nFor under $10 + tip for a nice big lunch in a really pleasant room with pleasant people, you can't beat this place, and the neighborhood is fun to walk around and browse the funky shops for art, antiques, spices, hardware (?) and other stuff.\\n\\nThe have a small full bar, offer beer and wine, though the wine selection is, well... order beer.\\n\\nOne of my favorite lunch joints, you'll do well to check it out. Is it high end? No. Is it really accurate Indian food? Not really, but it's nice, always well prepared and friendly, tasty and satisfying.

Freezing cold AC which didn't get it started and then it all went downhill. It took them 45 minutes to prepare 7 sushi rolls when there were only 6 other tables in the entire restaurant. Then our group didn't even like 3 of the most basic rolls. The crab tasted spoiled. Can't understand how they have been open 2.5 yrs with food/service like this."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The Flying Biscuit is considered an Atlanta staple. I love the midtown location since I live a few blocks from it. This is a great spot for brunch or breakfast. Beware of the crowds though ! On a Saturday or Sunday there's often a long line waiting. \\nFor my last visit, I came here for breakfast around 10am on a Monday. I had a coffee along with the Famous Flying Biscuit Breakfast. The place was crowded as usual but the service at the bar was quite fast and friendly. The coffee was standard - good enough to kick away my Monday morning blues and get me started for the day. \\nThen the main entree came out. I cannot say enough about how awesome and tasty the Creamy dreamy grits are. Having my experience with grits limited to the Quaker instant grits that come out of a carton, I gotta say that these grits were just amazing. The scrambled eggs and cheese were just about okay, nothing too great. I actually prefer the Waffle House scrambled eggs with cheese (perhaps showing how I have become a slave of processed food over natural ingredients). The Biscuit itself and the chicken sausage were a bit disappointing. The chicken sausage patties had a rubbery texture, as if they had been microwaved. My Jimmy deans chicken sausages at home are better. The Biscuit was plain dry. It didn't have that juicy and fluffy consistency that I look for in a good Biscuit. \\nOverall, the Flying Biscuit still passes with flying colors for me. Just get a giant bowl of these incredibly fantastic grits !!!"},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Yummy!

It wasn't awful but it wasn't great either. They had a special on Bloody Marys for the weekend, so I got one. It was actually really good. The food itself was not great, though.

Although the server made a mistake, the tartar did not come out, and the rib steak was over cooked, they have offered to bring it out and also make us a new one, but because we didn't want the other guests to have to wait for us, we declined the offer.  At the end, the server sent the manager over to apologize again, and also took care of the steak and two desserts for the table. \\nI do want to take off one star for making two mistakes in one night, but the service of our waitress had compensated for that, plus we really liked the New York striploin and the desserts and the chopped salad, these three things are highly recommended if you visit this restaurant.

The Tuesday lunch special was a spicy chicken adobo, served with saffron rice and a small baked potato topped with cheddar cheese. On Wednesday, I had the minestrone soup and half a chicken-Brie panini, along with a small order of sweet potato fries. Everything was absolutely delicious, especially the crispy fries.
