I can't comment on the authentic Indian-ness of the food, but I can say that everything I've tasted at The Clay Pit has been delicious...\\n\\nYou can request to have your dishes spicy, but I have enjoyed all of them mild.  I was always afraid of curry after a painfully spicy experience eating at a Malaysian friend's home... :)  So, I'm a-okay with a mild curry.  All that said, lack of bite doesn't mean lack of flavor.\\n\\nEveryone I've accompanied to The Clay Pit raves about the Tikki Masala.  It's apparently the most popular dish.  But my favorites are definitely the Korma (cashew-almond-pistachio sauce with garlic and coconut), the Coconut Curry (onion curry with coconut milk, roasted whole spices and bay leaves), and the Kabuli Chicken (cooked in the Korma sauce and infused with pureed nuts, raisins, and cherries).  I also really liked the creamy Mango Lassi drink, which also would have made a good light dessert.\\n\\nThe ambience is slightly upscale and really alive.  The noise level can be slightly loud sometimes, but has never been enough to really bother me.  The prices are what I expected - about $10 for the curries and $15 for entrees from the grill.  It's appropriate to dress up for this place, but it's also not awkward to show up in jeans.  Every time I have been, there have been families with young children.  It wouldn't have struck me as a great restaurant for kids, but these families seemed to enjoy it.\\n\\nI've only gone to happy hour at The Clay Pit once.  I had a nice Prum Riesling. There was a big group having Mexican Martinis and the bartender graciously gave my friend and me small glasses with the leftovers, to sample.  It was really good, but really strong.  Really.\\n\\nThey offer gift cards and catering.  And I heard that their banquet room seats over 200 people.\\n\\nI can't speak to the authenticity of this place for Indian cuisine, but I definitely recommend it for a comfortable, stylish, upscale restaurant with professional staff and delicious food."},{"name":"Xi Xia Western Chinese Cuisine","address":"1140 Kenny Centre Mall","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything there is delicious.

I informed him that nowhere on the coupon it says 'redeemable once' and he replied saying \\"It doesn't matter what it says, the coupon is used to only get new customers and you have ordered here before, therefore you are not new...my job is to make money, not sell you $8 pizzas whenever you want them.'\\n\\nNow, usually I would not gripe over a coupon, but the attitude and overall remarkable unfriendliness is what spurred me to write this.

Solid food, solid service, decent atmosphere, etc. This review is particularly in relation to one specific incident that occurred almost a year ago. \\n\\nI was at the bar with a buddy, and (separately) a younger girl and her slightly older tinder date were at the bar next to us. As the night wore on, the male kept getting angrier and angrier, and more aggressive. Unfortunately, if you are familiar with the Boston bar scene, this is not a terribly unusual occurrence. What was unusual, was how Whiskey's staff handled the situation. \\n\\nWhile the situation escalated continuously, the young women on her date grew clearly more and more upset. There was a woman who I can only imagine was some kind of management member, who pulled the younger girl aside - into one of the private staff only areas, and spoke to her for quite a while. She later explained that she was not only comforting the young woman, but imploring her to not leave with her irate Tinder date. He was escorted from the bar by the attentive security staff. \\n\\nI do not know exactly how the entire event concluded, but what I do know is that the staff at Whiskey's did everything in their power to de-escalate the situation, and ensure everyone's safety. Unfortunately I have frequently seen similar situations at bars around Boston, that are not handled well at all. The professionalism and concern for patron safety demonstrated at Whiskey's was refreshing, and deserves mention.

Maybe I am trying to keep it a secret all for myself, muhahaha!! This place is amazing on so many levels. Let's start with the food. I've tried everything here and while everything is a momento of the Taiwanese street food that I have craved from Taiwan, my go-to is the bento boxes with a boba milk tea with the pork belly buns a very close second. The pork belly slices are thick and hearty and just melts in your mouth! Also, ask them what their bento options are (braised pork, chicken, porkchop) because on a daily basis it can change because its all fresh. The milk tea is actually made with tea AND milk. I know that may sound silly to some of you but it is such a huge deal as some places make milk tea from powder. You can really taste the tea flavor. They recently added optional flavors to their milk teas, and the one option I was most excited about is the wildflower honey. Granted, I am still a traditionalist so their regular boba milk tea hits the spot for me. They make it exactly how i like it, light on ice and just slightly sweet. \\n\\nThe owners Alex and Shirley are also just the sweetest people. I love that they are chasing their dream and making the food that I have grown up eating in Taiwan here in Austin!! The trailer is located behind the University Co-op. You can park on the side streets or you can park in the Co-op garage. They will validate your parking ticket for up to a hour. Sometimes the garage is just open as well with no tickets needed. \\n\\nThis is a great place for me to bring new people to, there is plenty of outside seating with umbrella coverage.

That pretty much sums up my experience here. Per the staff, this was highly unusual and due to the fact that the show Man v. Food had filmed here the day before. So maybe that's true and maybe they are awesome the rest of the time. But, honestly, at the end of the day, you run a restaurant. If you want the exposure of being featured on Man v Food, you should be fully prepared for that day and the day after. Instead, what we got was an ever escalating comedy of errors where we would order something only to have the server come back 20 minutes later to tell us they actually didn't have it. No cocktails, no wine, no donut holes, and this is the best, no sparkling water that we were still charged for and paid because the server was too frazzled to take it off the split credit card bill that was already run. Yeah, it was only a few bucks, but no one should have to pay for something they didn't receive. Someone should have gone in and gotten us the cash and given it back to us. Also when you run out of water, you have hit rock bottom in terms of being able to provide a reasonable dining experience. Also the food we did order was only so so. We got a triple threat appetizer, which is potato chips served with three types of cheese dips: queso, pimento, and bleu cheese. The bleu cheese was literally some chunks of bleu cheese swimming in a bowl of ranch dressing. Sure the ranch dressing tasted fine (I've never had ranch dressing that didn't taste fine) but I don't know if I would go so far as to call it a bleu cheese dip. The deep fried pickle okra was sliding out of the batter. And the Mac and cheese side was completely non-descript cafeteria level Mac and cheese. We later ordered a burger, Caesar salad, and a dessert, only to have to wait about an hour for the food to come out, despite our server coming out to tell us several times that the food was coming out shortly. Not to mention, at one point we were told to hang on to our silverware because they might not have anymore clean silverware. What?!

Many reviewers would say, \\"I should have just gone to Buffet Palace,\\" or \\"I'll just stick to my Buffet Palace.\\" That and the fact that Buffet Palace is a 10-minute drive from my place, I was sold. \\n\\nThe marquee in the center it is in was so small, we almost drove straight past it! We could barely see the sign for Buffet Palace, but we swerved into the parking lot and made our way to the front door. I'll admit, on the way up to the door, I eagle-eyed the plates in front of the patrons sitting in the booths next to the windows I walked by. First impression was good! I'm looking at plates scraped clean, and what food on it looks made-to-order quality. We are immediately greeted and seated in a booth next to the window.\\n\\nThe buffet itself consists of a central hub: Sushi, salads, exotic dishes, soups, cold sides, desserts, and a soft-serve ice cream machine (vanilla, chocolate, and swirl; cups and cones provided). The bar outside consists of a self-serve pho style bar (two different kinds of broth and pre-made vermicelli bowls to pour the broth over), fried items (battered and fried french fries, spring rolls, rangoons, tempura-fried vegetables like onions, sweet potatoes, and green beans), proteins (sesame chicken, kung pao style chicken, grilled chicken, and so much more), lo mein noodles, fried rice and steamed rice.\\n\\nI would like to comment that the dessert selection is the most expansive dessert buffet I have seen (carrot cake made in house, chocolate cake, spiced apple crumble cake, puddings, an ice cream machine, fried dessert bread with cinnamon on the side, sesame balls...it was overwhelming). SUSHI PEOPLE: THE SUSHI BAR HAD FOURTEEN, COUNTED THEM, FOURTEEN different types of rolls, all which my boyfriend can attest to a great quality (the best at a buffet he has had). \\n\\nI helped myself to kung pao, grilled, and sesame style chicken, fried rice and lo mein, rangoons, a potsticker, and an egg roll, as well as some tempura veggies. Healthy, I know. But I ate every bite. On New Year's eve, we visited a Chinese buffet nearby and honestly...I left hungry. The meats were cold, and I felt at-risk for food poisoning at that place. Buffet Palace is SUBLIME. \\n\\nPlease understand; however, this is still a BUFFET. A CHINESE BUFFET. Do not expect the same quality of cooked-to-order dishes. That aside, the meal I had this evening was hands down, the BEST buffet experience I have had in my life, and I will be back again and again.\\n\\nThe total amount for two sodas and two dinner buffets at 4:45 pm on a Saturday came out to $30.83. Also, they carry Pepsi products, so we got the, \\"to drink?\\" \\"Cokes, please.\\" \\"Is Pepsi OK?\\" \\"Well...is monopoly money OK?\\" But the sodas weren't flat with plenty of ice so that's all we can ask for. \\n\\nIt was loud, but I could still speak across the table. Our waitress was astounding. It's just a buffet...all I expect is someone to refill my drinks. Our waitress was attentive, filling up our drinks the moment they reached the bottom third. I started with a Pepsi then asked for a Mountain Dew. She was actually concerned that I might have been displeased with the Pepsi. I assured her everything was fine, and she thanked me. She was so great! \\n\\nBuffet Palace is now our go-to buffet for Chinese anywhere in Austin. Thank you for this experience."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Austen B was an amazing server.

They also didn't have their drinks, limes, or the salsa they serve with their chips (which they don't give refills for cause they're homemade). For $3 the fajita steak taco was good (coulda went without the one slice of avocado they throw on there) but the Al pastor was what threw me off. The consistency was mushy & although I firmly believe pineapple elevates an Al pastor taco, I think that's what made the meat too soft & wet (I couldn't finish it cause it was so off putting). \\n\\nAs a Mexican Houstonian, I was hoping for more but I guess this wasn't the spot to expect above average from. I really wanted to enjoy the experience cause they felt authentic, but looking at their dominant customer base, I'm not surprised their food seemed to be dull in flavor and spice.

Nothing good...unfortunately. We had probably about 4 experiences with them and it was a disaster most of the time. \\n\\nOur first experience was a few months ago when I ordered the gluten-free pizza (super pricey BTW) and it was a little burned. My son loved the deep dish pizza though so that part went well. \\n\\nThe second experience, my GF pizza was burned and inedible. Because I paid so much for it, I ate as much of it as I could but I did call the manager and explain the problem. He didn't offer to refund my money or give me a discount for the next time but told me I could drive up there and pick up a replacement. It was one of those busy nights and running up there was out of the question. \\n\\nThe third experience was when we had problems with the online ordering being down and there was confusion about the order. I did call the manager and gave him my proper phone number as it wasn't correct in the system. I also asked him to please not burn the GF pizza [which is a common problem with GF pizzas, unfortunately]. The pizza arrived somewhat burned around the outsides, again. \\n\\nThe fourth experience - the deal breaker - we had the same problem with online ordering system again only *I did not know it until the driver got here*. The first thing I said to him was \\"oh hello there, I don't think I was able to add your tip online so I'll write it in now, if that's OK.\\" I don't think he even heard me, TBH. This young guy was beyond rude. I was a little confused about having to pay cash for the order, he pointed to the receipt and said very slowly and in a super condescending tone \\"see...cash...C - A - S - H - cash...you pay caaaaash.\\" I was really confused because the online ordering system had taken my card info and confirmed the order and wondered how could this have happened. Meanwhile, the kid repeats \\"you need to pay caaaash\\" [pointing to the receipt as if I were 5 yrs. old] in such a nasty low tone that I was shocked. I mean seriously, the look he gave me was full of contempt. (It's just pizza for heaven's sake!) I then told him \\"ok, I'll go get your *cash*\\" and as I walked away from the door to my purse, HE LEFT!  He just LEFT! [What in the absolute world just happened here?]\\n\\nAfter that, I called the store and told them I had the rudest and worst experience I'd ever had with takeout and delivery food service. The young man on the phone said he'd tell his general manager [which I doubt happened]. \\n\\nJet's: there are tons of pizza options in this area and the occasional mistake can be overlooked but you need to seriously look at who is running this location because they need to be replaced. A business cannot survive in this very competitive environment by providing crummy service, a user interface that doesn't work, and burned pizzas with no remorse. Even when my son begs me to order him a deep-dish, I have to tell him NO MORE JET'S, period. \\n\\nThe thing is, even after writing this review and having called the store twice to complain, I sincerely doubt anybody will do anything to fix the root causes of the problems let alone respond to this review."},{"name":"Banya Japanese Restaurant","address":"8166 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I may sound like a broken record but once again I had an amazing experience at Banya.  I ordered my favorite, Hamachi (yellowtail) which was amazing in both freshness and quantity.  I also got my second favorite Unagi (eel) which is only good if prepared with good timing, due to the fact that it is served warm.   I have never been disappointed here which is a very good sign that the Itamae is a true professional. I got the Masago (flying fish egg) because I like the fireworks explosion in my mouth. I ordered something that I have not ordered here before which was the Escolar (super white tuna) which was an amazing treat.  It is a delicious fish if it is fresh and only order it at a place that you trust. Keep in mind this fish is known as the \\"ex-lax fish\\" and should only be eaten if it's fresh and in small quantity. This is why I love this place so much!!!! I trust the Itamae (sushi chef).  I also ordered the Uni (sea urchin) but as you can see in the picture..it wasn't there.  He told me he had it but it was not as fresh as he'd like it so I politely thanked him for being a professional and informing me.  Uni is another one of those that is a great treat if it's fresh.  It's also an acquired taste so it's not ordered very often. He always lets me know if he thinks it's up to standard or not. He could have just served it to me, especially since it's a high priced item, but he is a True Professional Itamae.  Thank you again to the entire staff of Banya!!!

They were very friendly and answered all of my questions about the place. They smiled the whole time and didn't seem too worried about the fact that I showed up minutes before closing.

The food is a tad expensive, but the sandwiches are excellent...and Boston is a city with few good sandwich spots. The rotation of sandwiches every couple of months keeps the selection fresh. In fact, all of the food is good, albeit often salty (though I like salt). For a cheap snack, the half order of mac & cheese is a tasty compliment to some beers. \\n\\nThe atmosphere defines Parish. It's a laid back bar with few college students and mostly young professionals. The music is generally a little off-beat (a nice mix of stuff you may not have heard) and is actually enjoyable to hear...rather than the poppy crap that most bars play. \\n\\nUnlike some other bars on Boylston, you don't wonder if some of the patrons were on the Jersey Shore.

My true rating would be a 3.5. Let me start off by saying that the food was good. Not great. Good. I am always thrilled when any Asian-inspired restaurants open in Austin as they are few and far between. I had super high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it just didn't blow me out of the water. The fish quality was alright, but not amazing. And for the price ($$$$$) I would expect more. Portions were extremely small. Why open a sushi restaurant and pay special attention to the fish quality and then have 1/3 of your menu be rice and cucumber heavy handrolls? Also, this place is supposed to be small plates, sharing style?? Yet a big chunk of their menu are impossible to share hand rolls. \\n\\nThe nigiri was delicious. Ordered the Japanese Sea Bream and the Negi Toro from the specials menu. Both were-melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Yellowtail nigiri was delicious as well. \\n\\nOrdered the Negi Hama handroll. It was overly bitter and the quality of fish left much to be desired. The Miso Salmon was better. The Marinated Big Eye was probably the best. All left something to be desired. All had too much rice and cucumber, not enough fish or avocado. The one godsend was the Crab Butter handroll. But let me clarify, it was IMITATION CRAB. So is imitation crab smothered in mayo worth $10 to you? That's for you to decide!\\n\\nWe ordered the Marinated Yellowtail and Soft Shell Crab from the plates section of the menu. While the fish was plentiful and delicious in the yellowtail dish, something was off with the accompanying sauce. The taste of vinegar was pretty much the only thing we could decipher. The soft shell crab on the other hand was fine. Again, VERY VERY SMALL portions. \\n\\nCocktails were good. Kind of heavy to be accompanying a meal, but good nonetheless. \\n\\nOverall we spent about $75 a person (ordering conservatively) and left with room to fill in our stomachs. Hate to say it, but would have been much more satisfied spending $75 at Uchi (and probably would have left full)."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"A friend at work repeatedly told me many times that I must eat Gus's chicken as soon as possible. Since it's smack in the middle of downtown, and I hate downtown traffic with a passion, my hubby and I have just put off the visit, and our thoughts were, \\"it's fried chicken, how good can fried chicken REALLY get?\\" This past 4th of July weekend, some girlfriends came to visit me from Houston. It's a Friday night, we went for happy hour at a couple places downtown. Come 7 PM, we were all starving, and I suggested that we should all go try out this supposedly amazing fried chicken place, already downtown, who knows when I'll come again. We walked to Gus's, cute little place, even though it's not a local Austin restaurant, they made it very Austin-y and hippie. There was a little wait, about 10 mins, not too bad. The 5 of us ordered the 12 piece family style combo, came with sides, we got cole slaw, macaroni, and beans. Got a couple of big boys 32 oz beer and soda. Food took a little bit, but that's because they fry the chicken after you order, so it's fresh. My hubby took the first bite, I believe the phrase that came out of his mouth was \\"holy shit how can fried chicken be this good.\\" We DEVOURED (even that maybe an understatement) the chicken. Everything was SUPER tender and juicy, especially the chicken breast. I normally hate white meat, because it's always dry and flavorless, and will only eat dark meat. But the chicken breast here is so juicy and tender, that from the times that we went back, I only ordered breasts. The sides were also superb. I hate cole slaw, but this cole slaw I will eat. Everyone was fighting over the beans, my husband literally licked the bowl clean, and mac & cheese is above average also. If you still have room after all the deliciousness, definitely grab a piece of their Chess Pie. As I like to call it, the Crack Pie. Gus's chicken is 120% the best fried chicken I've ever had. It's full of flavor, spicy, juicy, tender, and most importantly, NOT dripping in grease and oil. All of my friends were raving about it after we ate it, and are now trying to convince me that mailing them Gus's fried chicken to Houston is a sign of friendship.

The special was lamb shank, and I asked the waiter what he would recommend between the lamb shank and Le Steak Frites. He said definitely the steak, as it's their signature dish. I ordered it medium, and it comes already sliced up, and it was obviously rare. Not even close to medium. The chef should have seen this before it went out. No big deal - I sent it back to be cooked a little more. Meanwhile, my wife is eating her dinner. It comes back, looks great, pink but not raw, but is tough. Chewy tough. I tried a few pieces, and it was inedible. I've had their steak before and they are obviously using lesser cuts of meats. It can happen. However, my wife was almost done her dinner and so it didn't make sense to order another meal. When I spoke to the waiter about it obviously being raw, he said it's not about the colour, but the texture. Seriously? Basically, he told me I was wrong. I had to have the cheese plate for dessert because I was still hungry. The final bill came to over $200 - I had two after-dinner drinks, and the only thing he did was comp my wife's lemon tart, an $8 item. Seriously? If anything, it should have been one of my food items, not hers. I have a three strike rule and they hit it plus one - badly cooked food, poor quality meat, confrontational service, and a lack of reasonable compensation. This place used to be great.. it's obviously changed. It's not the same. The people beside us felt the same as well. So, there are lots of other places where your food dollar will go a lot further. I had two double Calvados drinks after dinner - for $19.50 each. A full bottle of Calvados sells at BC Liquor stores for $28.99. The minimum comp should have been her tart and one of my drinks. Because of their bad cooking and poor quality meat, I didn't actually get to eat dinner with my wife, which was the whole point of coming out tonight. We have kids, and rarely get out. And, I'm an internet professional. So, they could have done the right thing and shown that they really cared about bad food and bad cooking, or they could have brushed me off, which they did. So, not acceptable, not right, and now they've lost a customer for life.

Despite it being incredibly crowded, I was able to get a seat at the bar for dinner. I ordered the sausage sampler and the cream puff for dessert. Both were exactly as expected. The sausage was all very good in absolute terms, although for what was supposed to be four distinct types of sausage, they were all pretty much cut from the same cloth and faintly kielbasa-ish. Nothing like a weisswurst (my favorite sausage) or anything too unique. The Bahama Mama was discernable from the rest, though it didn't knock my socks off or anything. Maybe that's their definition of spicy, as we are dealing with midwestern palates here. Regardless, I didn't mind the similarity as all the varieties were delicious.

While there was plenty of hype preceding it, i'm not a big fan of desserts that are just homogenous pure sugar.

Just based on the menu, I couldn't wait to give Virgil's a try.  I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 5pm. I noticed that they have the waitlist option on Yelp and the live wait time was only 5 minutes so this was perfect timing. \\n\\nUpon walking in, I was pleasantly greeted by the host (who I think is one of the owners) and promptly seated.  The decor on the inside is vibrant and the music was on point.  There is a full top shelf bar w/ TVs so this is a great place to come for drinks/happy hour.  \\n\\nNow for the food....the menu here seems like it's meant to be \\"shareable\\".   With that said, my husband and our friend  ordered damn near everything!  We started with 3 appetizers - gullah eggrolls, shark bites, and bussin cornmuffins. The corn muffins were so sweet but I couldn't stop eating them!  The shark bites were perfectly seasoned and were similar to a fried oyster (so I was told) in terms of texture.  The gullah eggrolls were also amazing! I recommend everything!!!\\n\\nFor our entrees, my husband and I ordered the shrimp and crab gravy, broiled fish (whiting), mac and cheese, the veggie of the day (sauteed squash and zucchini) and seafood salad.  Our friend had the okra soup, mac and cheese, greens, and the sauteed shrimp.  Overall, I can't say enough good things about the food but the standout for me was that mac and cheese!! OMG! I swear it tastes like my grandmother's! I could eat an entire pan of it!  The shrimp and crab gravy was also pretty flavorful and filling.  I usually feel bloated and kinda crappy (like I ate too much) after eating soul food but their food was satisfying (not heavy) and didn't have me feeling like I would be sleep for hours.  I'm pretty sure I might have felt differently if I had ordered dessert. LOL!\\n\\nIt's also worth noting that the service was great - our food came out quickly, none of our order was wrong and the food was piping hot. I've been to several soul food restaurants in the Atlanta metro area and this one is definitely in the top 3 (dare I say #1).  The waitress mentioned that they did a test run on a brunch menu a week or so ago. If they actually roll out brunch here, the neighboring restaurants better watch out!

Surrounded by Austin big fish like Homeslice, Guero's, SoCo Cafe and more, Hopdoddy still shines just as brilliantly.\\n\\nEvery time a guest comes in town, I take them to this place, and they absolutely love it.  No joke.  Parents to friends, you name it.  My thoughts below (and yes I've tried all of these!):\\n\\nTOP BURGERS\\nMagic Shroom - Personally, this is my favorite.  Large, thinly sliced mushrooms with a nice creamy goat cheese to compliment.  The basil pesto totally brightens the flavor of all ingredients and is an ingenious a changeup from your typical mushroom-swiss burger.\\n\\nGreek - YES.  Can anybody in town name another place that actually serves a LAMB burger?!  If a gyro and a burger got together and had a multi-talented, brainiac child, this would be it.  It's amazing if you're a lamb fan.  If you aren't...well then I sincerely pity you.\\n\\nTeralingua - Frito Pie in a burger?  I think...YES.  The best part of this burger is that the chili isn't overpowering, which is often the case with a chili burger.  This one is perfect.\\n\\nMEH BURGERS\\nClassic Burger - As virgin as it gets, but a must try if you're into the traditional stuff...\\n\\nLlano Poblano - A plethora of flavors from pepper jack to roasted poblano chiles to apple-smoked bacon.  If you've been eating stale bread for the past week, this will blow you away.  A little too crazy for me though...\\n\\nPRIMETIME - Kobe Beef.  Must I say more?  It's a pricier burger, though, so if you have fries and a shake (which is a must) then you'll be dropping $25+ on a burger and fries... Something sounds totally wrong about that, but I digress!\\n\\nThe Goodnight - This is basically the poor man's choice.  One of the cheaper burgers, but a step up from just adding cheese.  I'm not a fan personally--don't really enjoy the BBQ sauce.  I'm totally a BBQ stickler.\\n\\nOTHER GREATNESS\\nNutella Chocolate Pretzel Milkshake - I don't think I have to explain this one...If I do, well then......ah, nevermind, forget it.\\n\\nKennebec Fries - For those that don't know, Kennebec potatoes are a higher quality tater.  They basically lack all the horrible disease-filled, hole-y, thick skinned qualities of your typical Idaho, and are often nicer on the palate.  That pretty much sums up Hopdoddy:  All the good in a burger, and leaves out the bad.\\n\\nPro-Tip: Get the burger medium rare =]"},{"name":"Virgils Gullah Kitchen & Bar","address":"3721 Main St","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Unprofessional ownership, kinda shady vibe.

However, I highly recommend that for dinner you make one. It's a small place. Maybe 15 tables at best that sit 4 people each.\\nWe went during week day so I presume in the weekend this place is packed. By 9pm I noticed larger groups starting to trickle in. \\n\\nMy first order of business was to try the sangria. Although the serving was much smaller that I am accustomed to, the flavors were there. It was refreshing and fruity. I don't recall that it had slices of fruit though. \\n\\n4-5 tapas are appropriate for 2 people. We ordered the machego cheese with chorizo. Delicious. Bite size servings, hey remember these are tapas. Chorizo was not oily or fatty and filled with flavors that complemented the manchego cheese so well! Next up was, the pulpo a la gallega. This is my all time favorite appetizer and must try whenever at a Spaniard restaurant. Each piece was cooked to perfection, it melted in your mouth like butter. The portion provided was also perfect. Although I could have just ordered two more of those with some bread and that would have been dinner. I was tempted believe me! As we were enjoying our pulpo, group behind us ordered the kobe beef empanada. They looked like they were in complete heaven with every bite. So we decided to order the same. \\n\\nOne great thing about this place is that they are not pushy. They actually encourage you to order 1 tapa at a time so that they don't all come out at the same time and get cold. This also allows you to decide weather you want to keep going or you had your fair fill. Back to the Kobe beef empanada, I liked it but was not enamored with it. Only one reason, it had raisins. The empanada had a great gravy inside to go along with the meat but the flavor of the raisin kind of ruined it for me. I just don't like them, sue me! But otherwise, it's a great selection. \\n\\nNext up was (yes - we kept going) the spicy scallops in garlic sauce. Yum yum yum!!! Tiny scallops with incredible garlic infused goodness. They are spicy so watch out! The bread helped simmer down the fire. They come out pipping hot. Check out my video. \\n\\nFinally for a closer we decided to get the chorizo balls only because they were out of the bacalao croquets. Sadly you only get two but for us at this point it was the perfect ending. Inside was creamy but not overly with chorizo pieces throughout.\\n\\nWe then saw there was desserrrrrrtttt. Yay! We ordered the flan, deliciousness! A little bigger portion than most Spanish places which was great! The balance of the custard was excellent. They know how to measure their eggs for sure! But my all time favorite was the almond natas. I have never experienced such a wonderful taste in my mouth. I licked my spoon twice for each taste. I have to get my grandmother to fork up this dish asap. I felt I have been deprived coming from Spanish heritage and not ever having tried this wonderful dessert. My friend tells me it's simply corn.

We've tried and adored the kalua pork sliders, chicken katsu, cucumber sunomono salad, sticky rice, ginger macaroni salad, and mix of sweet potato & thick cut fries, and it's all thrilled us and exceeded our expectations. I'm sure everything on the menu is out of this world but it's hard to tear myself away from my favorites to try something new although I've heard the poke is amazing and am determined to try it next time. As it is, I make my husband and kids get something different from what I order every time so I can get a bite of everything! All the food is cooked to order but if you're in a hurry you can call ahead to place a to-go order. The portions are large, the price is great, really beyond fair (I almost feel like I'm stealing, the food is that good) and the owners are kind, welcoming and generous.

This is what I have been waiting for. An honest to goodness Korean Soup and BBQ house. Ever since Seoul Solong Tang bit the yang, Portland has been a Korean soup wasteland. Not anymore. \\n\\nSo Kong Dong Tofu & BBQ opened up recently in the Fubonn center out on 82nd. I had been wondering about it for quite a while but once Catherine stamped it with her seal of approval, I simply couldn't wait to get over there to try it out. \\n\\nThe space is pretty much exactly the same as when it was a Vietnamese place, with some added stainless steel exhaust hoods, some tables outfitted with tabletop BBQ grills, and a Korean menu. It's long and deep and clean and sterile. And of course, as any self-respecting Korean place should, it smells vaguely of fish and strongly of BBQ meat.\\n\\nThe menu is short and to the point: A list of sundubu (soft tofu soup) dishes including a Kimchi Sundubu, Oyster Sundubu, Fish Sundubu, Veggie Sundubu (although I suspect the broth is not vegetarian) and the requisite meat Sundubu. There are also traditional favorites like Japchae, Kimchi Chigae, bibimbap, bulgogi, galbi, and the Bean Paste Chigae. There is of course also a list of meats, both marinated and not, you can order for a BBQ table. The prices range from the $6 range (for apps) to the low $20's (for the bigger meat plates). \\n\\nHilary and I opted for some Japchae (hold the meat - which they were able to do no problem), and 2 orders of kimchi sundubu (one without meat). We started with some barley tea and soon thereafter (actually, not really all that soon, but the place was PACKED when we were in there at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon) came a whole bunch of banchan dishes: A whole fried oily fish (that came out first, so we were calling it our Korean amuse bouche), a bowl with a pink vinegary substance with napa cabbage floating in it, and then your typical array of small banchan offerings like kimchi, a fish cake in gochujhang, fermented bean sprouts, and the ubiquitous Asian potato salad. The fish was tasty yet both oily and a little greasy. It had a yummy, fishy flavor akin to Mackerel. The banchan dishes were all tasty enough, with the kimchi being stand-out good. \\n\\nOur dishes arrived next: 2 boiling bowls of sundubu (with raw egg to crack into the boiling soup), 2 stone pots with rice cooking inside, and a plate of Japchae. The Japchae was not the best I've had but definitely the best I have had in Portland. This salty potato-noodle dish with mushrooms and onions is always a crowd pleaser, and to be able to get it sans meat without much argument was really nice. Hilary was very impressed with this dish. It was for sure a highlight. The soup had a nice, clean broth in it. Definitely not overly heavy with MSG, and lacking that dirty grittyness that is sometimes attendant with Korean soups. The tofu was custard-soft, and mine included some decent-sized chunks of Pork. The egg yolk added a delicious richness to the soup and cut into the heat a bit. It was a small bowl for almost $9, but the quality more than made up for it. Mine was devoured with much haste. At the end of the meal, they came over and poured some barley tea in the stone rice bowl to form a little after lunch digestif of rice and barley. \\n\\nOverall, I was seriously impressed by this standout spot in an otherwise wasteland of decent Korean food. Having been spoiled by both the excellent spots in Seattle and my friend's mom's home-cooking, I have always been let down by the local options. And while I have yet to sample the BBQ, I can give the bowl of sundubu and the little plate of Japchae I ate today 5 stars easy. Add in all the banchan and rice, and honestly, $25 for more food than 2 people can eat is not bad, especially at this level of quality. \\n\\nGlad that this place exists. Were we in Seattle, this would be a solid 4.5, but here in Portland, this is 5-star Korean food."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The best donuts! \\ni had a raspberry donut (dont remember the full name) but it was super fresh !

Brought along one of our teenagers. \\n\\nMade a reservations a couple weeks earlier. This is recommended. \\n\\nParking: There is a parking lot but it is crowded. Street parking and valet parking is available as well. \\n\\nDress code:  Yelp said dressy. In reality it ran the gamut. Men: Vest and tie to FootJoy golf pullover to baseball cap and jeans. Women: Dresses, slacks and tops, jeans and sweaters. \\n\\nAmbiance/ atmosphere: my wife said it felt stuffy. It wasn't bad to me but there wasn't a wow factor for me either.  Lots of different size parties and groups going on. Some celebrating birthdays with cake and present ; some looking a dinner party scene from a Woody Allen movie. The exact words to describe escape me at the moment so I have to come back and edit my review \\n\\nSeating: Booths and tables naturally. Our seating kind of sucked. Imagine a narrow \\"V\\" seating arrangement with the bottom of the \\"V\\" being flat. Now put a table in the middle of that \\"V\\". That is where our table was. Surround by booths and tables..almost being like being by the kitchen entrance if you have ever sat there.  My back was towards the entrance all night which I hate. At one point a guy bent over  to talk to someone he knew sitting at the booth/table next to us and his butt was like a foot from out table. Not what you want to see while trying to eat appetizers. \\n\\nAppetizers: Calamari ($15) and crab cake ($18). More than enough for two people not quite for three (if your bring a growing teenager). \\n\\nMain course:  Crapped Stuff Shrimp ($31)(again good size the average diner but not a growing teenager), Scallop Entree ($34) (wife really like this...\\"it was delicious\\") and the 12 oz filet mignon ($46) cooked medium (this was cooked very well). All plates came out hot, which kinda surprised me. \\n\\nSides:  Brussels sprouts with bacon ($10) and truffle Mac and Cheese ($12). Enough for 3 people. Recommend both. \\n\\nDrinks: Just water and iced tea ($12). One coffee at the end ($3) They have an extensive wine list with bottles that can run you a few hundred dollars and a full bar. \\n\\nWaitstaff: Great. Our waiter was Bryon and he was very attentive. Our son said \\"I liked that guy\\". \\n\\nOverall: Enjoyable dining experience. The family enjoyed the outing. Grand total - around $230 to include tax and tip. \\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"China Star","address":"753 S Orlando Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"horrible customer service!!!!! older oriental lady yelled at me because i was simply telling her that she charged me for large everything and i only wanted small....this is my 3rd horrible visit to this place!!!! take your money somewhere where you will be appreciated!!! i paid for the food and then had to ask for it after she placed it on the side of the counter!!!!!!"},{"name":"Blue Ribbon Grill","address":"4006 Lavista Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"The service and friendliness of this spot will bring me back.

No, you really are not missing out on some amazing yogurt; I am just THAT boring when it comes to food.  \\n\\nRegrettably, I am equally as dull when it comes to where I go get food, so like it or not, my sister is making me try new places.  As a starting point (that wouldn't result in complete culture shock) I was introduced to Sip.  After glancing over the menu, I decided to be brave and try a green tea milkshake.  Slightly hesitant about my choice, I was quickly comforted when I was presented with a drink that was a similar shade of key lime yogurt green.  Following my initial baby sip, I came to the verdict that I was holding a cup full of deliciousness!  Those vegans sure know what it is all about; in fact, I don't think I ever want an ice-cream based milkshake ever again! \\n\\nSo I guess I have to admit that trying new things won't kill me.  This probably means I should set aside my boring yogurt filled lunches and spice things up a bit more often.

The decor is rustic and wine themed and both my husband and I really liked how it looked. They have a ton of wine lining the walls, which we were later told were able to be shopped and opened while dining, but I felt like that might be a little overwhelming due to quantity! \\n\\nWe were there on a Tuesday, which is 1/2 price bottles of wine. What a win! We asked our waiter for a recommendation and the one he helped us pick was amazing! The perfect blend of fruity for me and dry for my husband. We were seated in a little room towards the back, which I was excited about for the cozy feeling, but then disappointed when I realized there were babies at 2 of the 6 tables. Crying babies. I'd read on Yelp that it was not kid friendly and was looking forward to a more romantic night out, so I was surprised to experience that. \\n\\nWe ordered off the special menu and between the two of us received - tuscan chicken soup, baked french brie, Steak Frites, Fettucini Del Mar, triple chocolate pot de creme and key lime pie. Everything was very good and the portions were well-sized.

Ok so onto the review of this place. We were visiting a local utility (NSTAR) and we decided to give this place a try on a blustery afternoon in mid-January. Being as I am the food savant (this is applied to the small circle of co-workers I was with...literally one other person who happens to be my supervisor). \\nFood: I'm going to break everything down individually since the variance was all over the map.\\nCourse 1 Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Fried Rice): This was by far our favorite dish. The grilled pineapple, shrimp, pork, egg...everything just worked. It had a nice subtle spiciness that lingered a little after each bite, personally I would have liked more heat, but I think the heat strikes a balance that would please most. It was also a pretty generous portion, especially in comparison to the other dishes that we got. This dish was unequivocally 5 stars; it was head and shoulders above the rest.\\n\\nCourse 2: Pork Belly Buns: These were pretty tasty; the bread reminded me of a Filipino steamed bun (Siopao), just with a little more finesse. My only complaint was that if you're sharing this with someone you're only going to get two bites before you're waiting for the next course. I would give this dish a solid 4 stars overall.  \\n\\nCourse 3 Tea-Smoked Pork Spare Ribs: The only positive thing I can say about this dish is that the meat was very tender.  This one positive was completely overshadowed by the taste of smoke that camped out in your mouth like people at Best Buy for Black Friday. If you enjoy eating cigars, this dish was made for you, otherwise steer clear I just did you a huge favor. I would give this dish 2 stars, this could have easily been a 4 star dish if they were able to smoke the ribs with a deft touch, but sadly this wasn't the case for my experience.\\n\\nCourse 4 (totally unplanned and 100% motivated by expelling the smoke from our taste buds) Edamame+ Celery Slaw: After our waitress returned I asked for something quick and refreshing to remove the smoke taste from our palettes. She recommended this dish and it was brought to our table in short order a couple of minutes later. It was pretty refreshing, and definitely removed the smoke from our mouths. Personally I thought it was a little one note (3 stars).\\nWait staff/Ambiance: The lunch crowd was mostly business with a speckle of artsy/bohemian. The place has booths along the perimeter with tables in the middle. \\n\\nOverall: I picked this place due to its proximity to our business meeting and the rave reviews/interesting fare. Personally I probably wouldn't go back. I found the portions a little small and the menu all over the place in terms of enjoyment. I know you take my word as gospel but give it a shot if you're near this place and want something different. I would recommend ordering about 30% more than you normally would at a tapas place and by all means avoid the tea smoked spare ribs."},{"name":"She's Not Here","address":"440 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to this place knowing nothing about it.

My coworkers and I opted for the buffet. The restaurant was packed with older folks shuffling about. I loaded my plate with sausages, pasta, and a cabbage/ham dish. A lot of the dishes were boiled and loaded in salt. I enjoyed the bahama mama , which is their signature sausage; the casing was thick and the meat inside was juicy and oily. When it came time for dessert, I ordered a cream puff - another thing Schmidt's is known for. The cream puff was almost the size of my head! The vanilla filling was delicious, but the pastry itself was dry and flavorless. \\n\\nAll in all, I wasn't impressed with the restaurant's food. But I recognize that I'm not a big fan of German food in general. For newcomers, I'd suggest skipping the buffet and ordering the sausage sampler from the menu.

With so many bubble tea shops come and gone, Leisure has been one to withstand the storm throughout the years. It has been in business for more than 10 years. This quaint teahouse brings you a nostalgic feel, something of an old English coffee shop prior to the arrival of mega chains.\\n\\n\\nThere are different variations of tea houses - ones with shaved ices or dessert treats and savory snacks; such as Leisure ones that have evolved more like a restaurant with set meals (hot pot, mini sets, noodles, etc) while serving bubble teas; ex. Pearl Castle, Well Tea \\n\\nWhat is bubble tea, BBT, bobaÊ≥¢Èú∏Â•∂Ëå∂or \\"pearl milk tea\\" ÁèçÁè†Â•∂Ëå∂? It is a type of tea beverage originated from Taiwan in the early 1980s that contains a tea based mixture. The \\"pearls\\" are made from tapioca starch and carries a chewy gelatine texture shaped into tiny balls. Some teahouses also mix sago with the pearls. The contrast between the tiny and the large balls are quite tasty! Pudding, tapioca noodles, coconut jelly are also common substitutes.\\n\\nSome common drinks\\n\\nJasmine Green Tea ËåâÈ¶ôÁ∂†Ëå∂\\nPearl Black Tea ÁèçÁè†Á¥ÖËå∂\\nFoam Green Tea Ê≥°Ê≤´Á∂†Ëå∂\\nPearl Milk Tea ÁèçÁè†Â•∂Ëå∂\\nHoney Green Tea  ËúÇËúúÁ∂†Ëå∂\\nLeisure Tea & Coffee  00012\\n\\nLeisure Tea & Coffee  00015\\n\\nWhat type of tea do you fancy? Green, Red, Black, Milk, fruity, floral or herbal infused? I like Leisure for that fact that they are not too generous with the sweet syrups. They know how to balance. One of my favorite drinks of all time is Jasmine green milk tea with added grass jelly!\\n\\nA wide variety of desserts such as shaved ice, cr√®me caramel, tiramisu, pudding, Japanese cheesecake, crepes and ice-cream waffles are crowd pleasers.\\n\\nSo what is shaved iced you ask? B√†obƒ´ng Âà®ÂÜ∞. Bascially it is ice shaven down with added toppings. It is most popular in Taiwan. During the scorching hot summer days it is an inexpensive way to cool down while enjoying something sweet. Common toppings are: Red bean, grass jelly, coconut jelly, taro pearls (kind of like mochi), etc. Other toppings may be added as the customer desires. Eight Treasure Ice ÂÖ´ÂØ∂ÔøΩ?generally means a mixture of everything!\\n\\nSo if you are ever nearby, this is a place not to be missed if you desire an authentic Taiwanese caf√© experience and want to chill with some friends!\\n\\nItems are price point around $5.

Instead they tried to make up for it by bringing us out another pizza and not charging us. \\n\\nLike I said before Amrheins is not a place that I will be frequenting since there are so many other comparable restaurants in the neighborhood with better food and comparable prices.

Kyma is certainly no exception and Chef Karatassos' father was instrumental in starting. Chef and Kyma have earned many accolades and I'm clearly not the only one singing their praises. Karatassos has become a rock star celebrity chef and has a resume that includes working at some of the best the United States has to offer including The French Laundry, Le Bernardin and Jean-Georges. I could go on but for brevity's sake the man is at the top of his game. Kyma focuses on high end Mediterranean fare in a fancy space meant to impress. It is worthy to note that they do have a semi-strict dress code and I luckily changed into a collard shirt moments before venturing here. The beverage department takes pride in acquiring hard to get and noteworthy Greek wines. I enjoyed a cocktail that had flavors of licorice and was crafted with care and attention to detail. Kyma in short has made me a believer in Greek cuisine. Inspiration and training through French technique have resulted in dishes that are not limited to only flavors of mint, olive and capers. I was won over by the approachable plates with their inventive twist, which made the meal memorable. The menu can be approached many ways. Their mezze section are small plates meant to be tasted and can be made out of a meal in themselves. Like most have said the octopus is a must try with its charred texture and sweet glaze. Another strategy involves their larger entrees or whole grilled fish, which was the most exciting, and something you cannot skip out on. We opted for a dover sole which is hard to pass on any menu but here it paired perfectly as a flavorful protein without being too filling. They say the Mediterranean diet is the secret to longevity and if I could eat here everyday I probably would live to see 100 and be happy doing it."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We had such an incredible experience for our date night.

The place was half-empty, with the bar relatively crowded and the dining room far emptier; the restaurant seemed well-enough staffed, but it was clear that the staff had some trouble communicating clearly with one another. \\n\\nThree out of five of us ordered drinks almost immediately, and the other two ordered shortly thereafter. The first two got their drinks, then the second two, and the boy, who ordered with the first group, waited... and waited... and waited. He had to remind various staff three times to get his drink, and our server ended up bringing a second one (that no one ordered) shortly after someone else brought the first one. Not only was it given to another member of our party, but it was also put on their bill, and I was rather shocked that after all that, one of the drinks wasn't comped, as it was the staff's mistake. The boy did end up keeping the drink, but it should have been offered to him complementary. A minor annoyance, but nonetheless. \\n\\nThe rest of the evening went more smoothly. The food and drinks we ordered were quite good - I split the fried green tomatoes and a pulled pork plate with fries and baked beans with a friend, and we ended up stuffed. The cornmeal breading on the tomatoes could have used more flavor, but the BBQ was delightful. The fries and beans were fantastic as well. I do love that they have five different house-made sauces at each table, so you can taste-test them and season your food to your liking. I do wish the sauces were thicker in consistency, but that's personal preference. The boy had one of the burgers, and loved it.\\n\\nI tried the bloody mary, which came with a hunk of brisket on a skewer - yum! I wish the bloody mix was thicker as well, as it was a bit on the watery side, but had good flavor. The salted caramel martini was quite tasty, but it could have used more caramel and less salt on the rim. Perhaps drizzle the inside of the glass with caramel instead of letting it pool on the bottom? I also had the summer punch, which is a good bourbon drink for non-bourbon drinkers. \\n\\nThe food menu is extensive, and the whiskey offerings even more so. The cocktails are strong and reasonably priced.

After a less than stellar experience at another restaurant on her birthday a few months before, I took the reins and made reservations at Eddie V's at the Arboretum.\\nFrom the welcome to the ambiance, to the over the top customer service from our waiter, Dan, it was everything we were looking for in a fine dining experience.\\nMom mentioned that she really couldn't decide between the redfish with lump crab on it or fried oysters, so Dan presented her with a set of six small, perfectly fried oysters and made it a Happy Mother's Day gift. She was floored and enjoyed them immensely. She ordered her redfish and ate most of it, as well!\\nMy husband and I both were drawn to the Sole with Meuniere sauce, fresh arugula, and heirloom cherry tomatoes and I have to say it was one of the best fish dishes we have had this year. Succulent, very fresh fish with a parmesan crust that stood up to both the sauce and the lemon I added. It was crispy and luscious to the last bite.\\nWe ordered asparagus and hollandaise for the table and if I had any criticism at all for this dinner, it would be that the hollandaise was a bit mundane.

We've come here on various occasions and have had a different (albeit enjoyable) experience each time.\\n\\nThe first time was in the fall; my roommate and I had come here just the two of us. We ordered apple cider pork belly (tapa), a whole fried branzino, and squid ink fideos. The service was impeccable and the food came out in a timely yet organized manner.\\n\\nI loved the pork belly; it wasn't too cloyingly sweet. The branzino was good, but I woulnd't order it again. The fideos were absolutely amazing and very rich; we couldn't finish most of it and brought it home to eat the next day. \\n\\nThe service was also amazing; we sat outside so the server offered us blankets when it got cold.\\n\\nThe second time we went for our birthday dinner; we ordered a variety of tapas including the patatas bravas, abondingas, and migas, as well as the paella and fideos. The paella isn't as good as the fideos, but the tapas were really good.\\n\\nThe third time was in the spring with a group of 5; we ordered the patatas bravas again (my favorite), along with the spicy eggplant caponata. The eggplant would go wonderfully with the warm bread and olive oil they provide for free (sadly, I'm gluten free though). We also ordered the pork belly with tomatillo salsa, which was amazing, the mussels al diablo, and the grilled broccolini. The mussels were good, but the broccolini was far too salty. Finally, we ordered the champinones al ajillo, which are foraged mushrooms, which was decent, and the migas, which weren't as good this time around as they were during our bday dinner.\\n\\nAs for the paella, it was ok, but I'd recommend ordering the fideos if you aren't gluten free. They're more unique and better cooked; our paella was on the soggy side and missing the classic crispy rice edges.\\n\\nIf you're legal, try the wine or the sangria!

That said, we arrived just after 8pm on a slushy evening, so the lack of crowds wasn't too surprising for us.\\n\\nSchmidt's, of course, is famous for both its German specialty dishes, but also for it's \\"Autobahn\\" sausage buffet.  In both of our visits to Schmidt's, I've opted for the buffet, simply for pure amount of delicious food.  The buffet features at least 5 types of sausage, plus their sausage stew, salad, soups, and a good number of classic German sides.  I would have liked to see some spaetzle or the the like on the buffet, but the very obviously homemade mashed potatoes, German potato salad, and mac-n-cheese would have to do.\\n\\nI will say, this past time out the buffet was a little lackluster, but that was primarily due to the lateness of our visit.  I kind of wished the mashed potatoes were refilled while we were there, but no such luck.  That said, everything was still hot and particularly tasty.  I find that I prefer the 'mild' version of Schmidt's signature \\"Bahama Mama\\", as well as their garlic knockwurst.  \\n\\nOf course, the other bit that Schmidt's is famous for is their glorious dessert case.  Cream puffs the size of your head?  Oh yes...so good.  If you can't save room for one on your own, share!\\n\\nSchmidt's is an institution for a reason.

Plus they had some interesting rolls on the menu.  \\n\\nWe ordered the bainbridge roll, firecracker roll, chicken karage, sushi pizza, and ebi mayo.  For those who don't know, \\"sushi pizza\\" ($8) is essentially a flat round of deep fried rice, layered with all the \\"house\\" items: crab meat, avocado, and a few slices of tuna and salmon sashimi, cut into 6 pieces.  It seems like they're not doing too well in the deep-fried department, because I wasn't a fan of any of our appetizers!  The karage was pretty dry.  Maybe if they were a bit thicker cut, they'd be a bit juicier? Def needs to be fried less!  The coating/batter on the ebi mayo was really disappointing.  I've had ebi mayo lots of times at other places, and this didn't compare at all. Sushi Pizza - a bit difficult to eat, I wasn't a fan of the deep fried rice.  If anything, the house roll ($4-5) would have been a better option. \\n\\nMy favorite roll was the firecracker: scallop roll topped with spicy tuna, seared with a blowtorch.  The torched fish gave everything a different smokey flavor, I loved it! \\n\\nThe service was disappointing for sure.  It was a Tuesday night, and it did get busy at times.  But when it was quiet, the waitress would be standing on the side watching the room, even though we've been waiting about 15 minutes and definitely ready to order.  She was the only one on the floor, and I think there was another girl who was probably handling the cash and helping in the kitchen.  We had a bit of attitude from her (apparently, we're supposed to know what a sushi pizza is), but when we tried to pay, the girl didn't say anything, just popped the card into the reader without confirming with us what we wanted to pay, and quickly went back to packing up boxes.  Service was a bit abrupt and rude, leaving little to be desired.  It seems they get a lot of take-out orders (I wonder why..) \\n\\nAnyway, the rolls are alright, I'm not a fan of the 3 appies I ordered, and I'd definitely stay away from anything deep fried from here.

The first thing I noticed was the $14 chips and salsa \\"flight\\". That seems like an exorbitant price to pay for tortilla chips so I asked the server what made it so special. We didn't get it, but I'm pretty sure it was just chips and salsa. I got the Tope margarita which was tasty, but weak. For tacos (about $5 each) I got the carne asada (meh/just ok) and the al pastor (really tasty). I think the pineapple in the al pastor really made the meat taste good. One thing I found strange about the taco delivery is that the put the entire table's order on one tray and leave you to figure out which tacos belong to which person. On the table they have 3 hot sauces - Serrano, habanero, and some mystery one that's dangerously spicy. I'm glad the person who delivered our food gave us more information about those since ours were not labeled. The view from up here is really nice, but the way the bar is oriented, your back is to the windows while you're eating.

They really emphasize flavor over anything else, so you won't find fun shapes or tacky sprinkles/frosting on these donuts. I can't even remember all the flavors that I've tried, but my favorite has got to be the horchata one. Honestly you can't go wrong with any of the flavors though. I'm personally not a fruity flavor person, so I didn't like the fruit flavors as much but it's prob personal preference. \\n\\nThe cafe itself is a really nice place to chill in.

Plus as someone who has been in the food business when you aren't busy as the owner if there is a table dropping big money you check in or table touch. That did not happen. Also the manager/server kept her pen for card transactions inside her hair. I mean fully in it and when she handed it over so I could sign for the transaction it had strands of her hair attached.

We had a group of four and probably waited about 45 minutes. There's a lady that pops her head out the door and seats people by the number you have in your group. The line actually goes fairly fast although I recommend dressing warm if you plan on going in the winter months. *Pro tip: If you REALLY don't want to wait, go by yourself since they asked if there were \\"Any singles?\\" several times*\\n\\nDefinitely stays true to the diner vibes, very 80s-ish. So, I've actually never watched the Breakfast Club, which means that the menu theme didn't mean anything to me but I'm sure it's cool if you've seen the movie...To me, the food is higher-tier quality than most other diners, although prices are also a bit higher. Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered the Supreme omelette, acai bowl, and Harvest Hash (which is on their seasonal menu). Everything was well-portioned and not as greasy as I usually find diner food to be. Acai bowl was stocked with all kinds of fruit, including fruit I would never expect to find in an acai bowl...grapes, anyone? The smoothie base was pretty liquid-y by the time it came to us, but for ordering an acai bowl from a diner which, to me, is equivalent to ordering steak at a Chinese buffet, I thought the effort was commendable. My friend ordered the pancakes, which were huge and fluffy. I usually never order pancakes anywhere because I'm always largely disappointed and can make them better myself, but I would definitely order these next time.  \\n\\nIs the Breakfast Club worth the hype?

We thought this place would be great to try. We arrived right at the time they opened for a late lunch. The hostess promptly greeted us. We told her that we had 3 dining and she let us know that the only table they had that could accommodate us was in an alcove, hidden from others. Our waiter, Lance, came and gave suggestions on drink options. We had 2 iced teas and 1 cocktail. The cocktail was described as the favorite of most guests. \\n\\nFor our meal, we ordered the fried jam up wings, macaroni and cheese, Gullah fries, vegan fried cabbage, and vegan red rice. The presentation of the wings was lovely. The wings also had good flavor. The macaroni and cheese looked like it was cooked by someone's grandmother, and was just okay. The vegan red rice was a good portion size, but it too, was just okay. The wedges were just wedges. You couldn't taste the sugar that the fries were purported to be dusted with, however. The cabbage was good, but it had been cooked a bit longer than I'd like.\\n\\nThe food was decent. There were things that I noticed that could be changed. I did have an opportunity to ask one of the owners if there was any chance that they'd broaden the vegan options on their menu. He explained that it is in the forefront of their minds, and during their soft opening, they tried out vegan dishes that didn't capture the essence of the Gullah flavor. The menu is a la cart, which gave the thought that the prices were reasonable. Once you build your meal, it's regular price food. The server, Lance, was great. He offered suggestions and told us his favorite items. \\n\\nThe location is not vegan friendly at this time, so if this is what you're looking for, try another spot for now. It also isn't great for kids or large parties.

Initially I thought it was my fault, as I grabbed a slice right when it came out and it was so hot that all the toppings immediately slid off. But even after I let it cool, the slice was extremely floppy and took two hands to eat because you also had to support the bottom so that the cheese wouldn't just fall off. \\n\\nAlthough it's not listed on the menu, there is also hard alcohol available, although I don't imagine they do a lot in the way of any mixed drink that isn't just soda. \\n\\nThere was no lime or lemon for mixed drinks and no butter for the bread.

This was back when I had A WHOLE HOUR for lunch and I could eat carbs at will with no repercussion, so we ate here probably once a week for years. All the staff knew us and the owner, Eddie, would always flirt just enough with my hubby in his wittle brown shorts to make him embarrassed and yet, somehow flattered.  I would always get a sammie and fries or a chicken or tuna salad salad.  I remembered them to have some of the best fries in town so I was interested to see how today's food would hold up to my admittedly rose tinted  memories.\\n\\nThis weekend I got my old favorite, the Italian Sandwich and fries and hubby got the Rueben.  That sandwich rocked my tipsy world, loaded as it was with several Italian cold cuts and cheeses and served on an olive oil and rosemary foccacia.  Nothing too fancy about it but delicious.  And, yes....the FRIES!  Perfectly cut, these ain't your wimpy shoestring variety nor your bulky steak fries.  They are just riiiiight and seasoned perfectly.  Just like I remembered.  As a bonus, they also have yummy crispy pickles!  Hubby really enjoyed his Rueben as well.\\n\\nI was so happy to see quite a few lunch diners here as, for me, I sometimes forget this little gem is tucked away here.  Still the service has always been friendly and prompt.

Less dense than a regular bagel and still a good portion of lox, two things I can appreciate. Somewhat on the pricier side, but with the yelp discount I felt like it was totally reasonable for the size.

Besides all of that terribleness the food and staff were amazing! THE FOOD IS AMAZING!

I asked for 2 sausage egg & cheese McGriddles, she said that wasn't part of the promotion even though the window sign said any breakfast sandwich.   She finally rang it up but not without a fight. I had to go back to the register for salt & pepper.  The young guy that was now there was just standing there staring off into the distance (there's a theme here) & even though i was standing in front of him I still had to get his attention to ask for salt & pepper.

Having tried out the first two on previous occasions, I and my wife decided to go here for our marriage anniversary dinner. \\n\\nThe place is located on the inner portion of the parking lot and the place in front is an Arabian market. We visited there on a Monday evening and it was sparsely populated with a couple of other tables being full. They have an affordable list of beverages and both our white and red wines were served quite fast. We really liked the choice of alcohol that we made and I appreciate the suggestions made to us by our waitress. \\n\\nFor appetizers we ordered Kashk-o bodenjoon, a sauteed eggplant based plate and Dolmeh, a ground beef delicacy. The bodenjoon was delicious and the naan bread that came with it was a perfect match. The Dolmeh was good as well but the grape leaves that are usually used to wrap a Dolmeh are easy to cut with a knife, I faced a little resistance here that may depend on the quality of the grape leaves and the manner in which the beef was wrapped. However, the ground beef was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious and exquisite.\\n\\nFor our entr√©es we ordered the Joojeh Kabob and the Barreh Kabob. The Joojeh are little pieces of chicken (with bone), seasoned with saffron sauce that gives it an exotic and tangy taste that goes very well with the basmati rice. The Barreh are skewered boneless lamb pieces cooked on open fire to perfection. I ordered medium to well done and it was cooked perfectly, just as I wanted. This was really a dinner to remember.

The most recent time would be during the long weekend I came here with my bf cause I was craving hotpot again and we were near by. They gave us a pack of red envelops too. I give this place a 4.5 stars. Very close to 5 stars for an asain place like this but there are minor things that needs to be changed. So, feel free to read on. \\n\\nI love their concept of individual pots and a set amount of food for a reasonable price which includes a drink and dessert (mango or green tea ice cream made from a machine. Green tea was better that day). Personally I don't really like All You Can Eat anymore because it's not worth it for a small eater like me. I have weird allergies like sesame, certain types or nuts and curry. So, it's best I get my own pot so others who go with me don't need to worry about my allergies. \\n\\nThe first time I was here was like about 4 to 5 years ago. It gave me the vibe that it's very Taiwanese and home like. I don't exactly know why asides from their decor. There wasn't much but it made me feel like I walked into someone's home. Anyhow, asides from that they have this bar shaped set up in the middle of the restaurant and a few tables on the side for bigger parties. In the middle of the bar shaped set up is where the server brings out the food, brings you drinks and so forth. I thought that was pretty cool. But the second time I went, none of that has changed. Not saying it's a bad thing but a nice upgrade would be good.  \\n\\nI don't have much to say about the food. I mean it's all raw and u just cook it in a pot. It comes with a chicken broth and if u want to change that you'll just have to pay the difference which wasn't much (less than 5.00 I believe). I love how they include an egg in the cost of your hotpot. That's a bonus to me because other places that I've been to, they charge like .50 to 1.00. \\n\\nIn terms for service, well there wasn't much. There was one server for the whole place. Poor girl that's running around all by herself. She has decent English because I asked her to explain to me what's in the sauce they gave us which was soy sauce, green onions, satay sauce and some minced garlic. Unfortunately I cant have satay sauce due to my sesame allergy. She kindly switched it up for me. But she should smile more. Asides from greeting us while we walked, we didn't ever see a smile on her. I mean being in the service industry and not like it would just make life miserable. \\n\\nOverall, not a bad place and I would totally come back if i'm in the area (a bit of a drive for me to get there). I would totally recommend this place to others especially to those people who love individual hotpots. This place does take credit card and that's rare for an Asian place to do so."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Awesome.

I made a vow to wake up early and find out what the hubbub was about the place.\\n\\nIt was a great dining experience.  I sat at the bar and was attended to by the attentive and talkative server.  I started with a waffle with the white chocolate pistachio rosewater sauce and the lavender latte.  Both very tasty.  They were followed by the fricassee, which did well in satisfying my morning savorytooth.  At the advice of my server I capped the meal off with a shot of expresso, which left me feeling lighter from my big breakfast and on a nice caffeine high to begin my day.\\n\\nI'd be hard-pressed to justify coming at peak hours as the wait is killer if you end up being a few parties behind in the line.

My only two complaints was the seating which isn't really the restaurants fault and the fact that our waiter switched up our soup preferences. My stomach wasn't feeling that well that day so I opted for a Mild soup - my husband wanted the Medium. At the end, his Lamb hot pot got the mild soup and I got the medium. I noticed the issue right away but I figured I could take the heat and so we didn't say anything to our waiter. It's a tiny mistake but it did alter our experience slightly. As for drinks, I got the lemon basil seed juice and it was great to go with my Medium Hot Pot. \\n\\nI do note though that I noticed several tables where people shared one hot pot between two people as per other reviewers. I'm not sure if it was just that my husband and I have bigger stomachs, but I don't think that would have worked for us. Our two hot pots were adequately sized and I was even worried whether or not it was enough for my husband for dinner. Thankfully, his lamb hot pot included an egg for extra protein so he was alright with the size. In general, I would recommend only smaller eaters to share their hot pot. Normal customers should generally get their own unless you plan to load up on appetizers on the side. \\n\\nThe restaurant was busy throughout our visit there on a Saturday evening but there were always free seats whenever a new customer came by.\\n \\nAll in all, our experience was A-Ok and we most likely will return in the future on the odd occasion."},{"name":"Engine House Pizza","address":"71 Lafayette St","city":"Salem","stars":"3","text":"UPDATED!!!

The add-your-own sauces on the side are solid, too. \\n\\nI really enjoyed my migas poblanas (egg, tortilla chips, poblano peppers, red onion, queso fresco, black beans, avocado) on flour tortilla, and chicken mole on corn tortilla, though I think the migas were the standout. The mole sauce is really well down though. \\n\\nThe strawberry aguafresca was spot on. So refreshing, perfectly sweetened with cane sugar so not too sweet, and ginormous. \\n\\nThe line moves fairly quickly and they'll tell you the wait time when you order.

It's clean, they use high quality ingredients, which is rare, and don't cheap out on their food. I like getting a beautiful Cesar salad with real parm sliced not ground - the house dressing is so yummy and they serve these delicious and soft pita rolls that melt in your mouth- the pita bread is not pita bread - it's like awesome explosion of bread wonderful- Everything I've had here is delicious. Super fast and cheap. And it's not the grease bomb food you usually get. The service inside is great too. On Monday's and Tuesday's they have a pizza deal my family loves.

It was well past any lunch rush, as there were around maybe 8 tables left working on meals. While our party was seated promptly, there was no further aknowledgment of our presence after that. I waited for over 10 minutes for a server to touch the table and offer us something to drink. A server made eye contact with us at some point, but did not come to the table. Perhaps we were not in his section, but maybe he would get his colleague in charge of my section to come around? Almost 15 minutes in, our water glasses were still empty - completely unacceptable for any fine dining restaurant. The final nail in the coffin was when we saw another table get sat and a server immediately starting up their lunch service. Clearly, your servers know what it means to wait tables, so I guess your servers were just not in the mood to offer us a decent lunch service on this particular day. \\n\\nI did not think it was worth my time or frustration to further pursue lunch at Bauhaus. There are plenty of good restaurants in the neighbourhood that understand the basics of waiting tables and what it means to provide consistent service. Bauhaus, your staff really did not give me a reason to want to stay and try your food. It doesn't matter how good your food is if your staff can't be bother to take a customer's order.

Well, guess what? Desta Ethiopian Kitchen participates in the Yelp cash back. What that means is you store your favorite credit card on your Yelp account and if you use that credit card at Desta, you get a whopping 7% cash back!

Apparently there is some unwritten rule that the fire pit is for reserved customers only, despite there being no signs to that effect where I sat down. Before I could finish my drink the very rude, twenty something male host asked if I could please move because they had a larger party they needed to seat. Not move to another seat but leave the fire put entirely. Despite having hot wax poured over me I was enjoying myself enough that I complied despite his rude request.

Buns were interesting and good but the sandwich/burger was hard to eat as a whole due to its size and the fillings coming apart when you try to eat it.  So conceptually it's pretty but when eating, I had to deconstruct it.  \\n\\nWhere's the rice, you ask? It was in the rice paper buns with crab meat (the artifical ones in sushi).  It tasted good and similar flavor to a Korean pancake that is made from eggs and crab meat.  Fish was super fresh surprisingly.  I had my doubts about ordering sushi from a join that co-specialized with meat.  Overall the sandwich was fresh, but it was missing a flavorful sauce or key item that tied it all down like avocado or something.\\n\\nAll entrees come with a side, so I went for the fried pickles.  It was very dill and not soggy! Loved it, even to the dipping sauce, which I think was blue cheese. \\n\\nIt's not a solid 4 stars but an interesting place that I would go again.

Very disappointed! First off, ordered the Bloody Mary. I couldn't finish it. It was way too spicy. I am convinced that the extreme spiciness of the drink is intended to mask the fact that there was little to no alcohol included in this concoction. It came with a garnish of 3 blah pickles and a strip of bacon with cold bacon fat caked on the side. I love bacon but did not touch this. \\n\\nOrdered the French toast bacon grilled cheese dish. I was hesitant to order this but the server insisted that it was delicious! Sadly, she was wrong. The dish consisted of two regular slices of bread filled with some sort of cream cheese concoction with a couple strips of bacon in the middle. When you make French toast with regular sliced bread, it tends to be mushy in the middle. When you add cream cheese it was really a mushy mess with some tasteless bacon added. My greatest fears were realized.\\n\\nIf the over spicy non-alcoholic bloody Mary wasn't enough, my dish came with some overly spiced Home fries. These were really just chunks of potatoes with a bunch of spice on them with a few onions. Now don't get me wrong I like spice but both of these were just over the top.\\n\\nI should have known that something was awry when we arrived at 12 o'clock on a Saturday morning and there were only three other patrons in the restaurant.

By the time I walk back onto campus it had already gone sour. Or perhaps it wasn't fresh to begin with. I had to throw it away. However, a redeeming quality is that their Boba tea is quite nice. It's a bit on the sweeter side and their hot oil is on point, but tbh I probably wouldn't come here again. But hey, the service was nice if you're into that."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"825 Battery Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Always a long wait for food during weeks day's lunch.

If you see groups of old Asian women there, that's a very, very good sign.\\"  We were the only Asians in the restaurant last night (no Asian staff, even?  At least that we could see, in the front of the house).  So... you do the math.  The service was good, the food was fine, albeit excessively spicy in some cases (and we happen to like spice, because you know, Asians).  The whole black pepper crab, which has to be ordered at least 24 hours in advance, was underwhelming at the price point ($85).  After a couple of legs your mouth will be on fire.  Our favorites dishes were the lamb panang curry and the beef stir fry.  The crispiness of the belly in the pork stir fry was a little off-putting (it was like eating chips made out of meat), and the pad thai was insanely spicy, even with the chile on the side.  I liked the fusion-y brussel sprouts with almond side dish, but it wasn't very Thai.  The cocktails here are realllly tasty, though.

I arrived here at around 11:30am-12pm, to which my friend and I had to wait around 30 minutes for a table. Reading the other reviews, this seems like a pretty good wait time. We were immediately greeted with a super smiley host, one that was dressed casually yet professionally; her attitude vaguely reminded me of Aritzia workers: kind, stern, outgoing, but not too preppy.\\n\\nAnd so we waited. When we got seated, the setting of the location was very cozy and homely. It was nice weather outside, but the temperature of the restaurant was definitely warmer; it was reminiscent of sitting by a fireplace, which is exactly the sort of atmosphere this restaurant gives you. Very relaxing.\\n\\nThe server we got was equally as nice, giving us time to look at the menu and refilled our waters pretty often. I asked her if the Couscous had any dairy in it, to which she said there was cheese; instead, she offered to replace the cheese with avocado to no extra charge. I ended up getting that, while my friend got 2 waffles with the milk chocolate lavender sauce on the side.\\n\\nThe food came out pretty quickly. It was presented nicely, and my food didn't taste bad. It wasn't exactly a flavour or texture I particularly loved, though. The dish was served at a room-temperature, perhaps leaning a bit colder; it was more like a salad than anything else. There wasn't too much textural interest, it was more or less smooth and oily feeling (not in a horrible way) all the way through. I think I prefer something a little more crunchy or a bit more dry? It's definitely a preference thing, though; I'd come again, but I'd order something else.\\n\\nBefore finishing off the review, I'd like to make another note: the girl sitting at the table beside me looked at her dish, called a server over, and asked for some ketchup for her bread because she deemed it looked too dry. Without any attitude or any interrogation, the waitress offered to give her some tomato jam with no extra charge. \\n\\nI feel like this place definitely does not want you to leave with any bit of unsatisfaction."},{"name":"Tassili's Raw Reality","address":"1059 Ralph D Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I thoroughly enjoy the kale wrap!

Each pot comes with a drink and your choice of udon or vermicelli. \\n\\nI have to say that the food is nothing special and the quality (at least of the meat) is dubious. On multiple visits, I have noticed that some of my meatballs showed signs of spoilage. The redeeming factor is that you get A LOT of food at a cheap price.

I tried 3 items on my very first visit. I was inspired also by the loving couple who owned the restaurant.\\n\\nPositives: The location is cool. Although parking is limited, there was easy access to Public Parking behind the restaurant. I saw a sign as I was leaving the lot that stated \\"permit\\" parking was allowed for four hours. So I was hopeful that this sign was a thing of the past.\\n\\nThe bartender, a female, was cordial. However, I noticed that the server stations were located behind the bar & there was an iPad or two being used. My biggest concern was exactly what happened -the bartender stepped away (because she did not write my order down) to ask me for a second time what I ordered. At that moment, a waitress with blond hair starts typing in an order. I immediately saw problems with this. Bartenders need their own station & servers need their own. Just old school waiter tips.\\n\\nNegatives: There was a young guy --employee--who apparently was there to get that money. He actually said he had 2 1/2 hours to go. I interpreted that as I looked on that he needed tasks to do. Thankfully a server came by and followed up with the bartender's suggestion that he asked everyone if the needed water. I sat at the bar and was not offered a water by anyone. He was told to do that twice. He was also told to clean up tables. He definitely was a novice at feeling the crowd and what they needed.\\n\\nThe food: I honestly can say that the wings were above board & so were the shrimp. However, the portion size -5 shrimp & 3 wings was way too small for the price of over $25. Unfortunately, the egg rolls tasted funny to me. They just didn't seem fresh. I'm sorry but I threw them out.\\n\\nI am not a person that lives on absolutes. I believe I will give the restaurant a second chance. I feel a sense of hope It is my hope that they make improvements. The employees need to act like they want to be there.

On our way to another restaurant it's charming curb appeal got us to make a u-turn and check it out. I'm so happy we did!\\n\\nThe COOP is similar to a fast casual setting but once your seated it certainly doesn't feel that way. You queue into a line (I'm still getting used to grabbing a menu at the front) and off to the register you go. On Saturdays you will see a huge tray with cinnamon buns that are unevenly cut to fill the whole plate. Making guest really feel at home. \\n\\nEverything hearty, heavy, and just full of soul. The COOP embodies everything Southern cooking is about. I got a huge trip off of the picked peppers as a condiment. Spending apart of my childhood in Georgia you knew a good Southern place when some bottled pickled peppers are on that table. Let me learn you a thing or two about Southern eatin..... you need the spice and vinegar to cut through the fat and salt involved in the dishes. This brings me to the frying batter to most it would be considered heavily salted but covered up some of those pickled peppers, than you have you a good ole time. \\n\\nEvery table had a staff member touching it. Ours was touched three times. Not only to express their gratitude (all the southern feels) but also to talk about 4 Rivers. New to the area we have been to many events catered by 4Rivers yet still haven't had the opportunity to drop by.

There were four bite size pieces decent enough to eat but the rest of them looked questionable or were extremely dried out. The coleslaw was okay. Nothing fancy or special about it. The biscuit was plain and dry and ended up being thrown out. The choices of dipping sauce did not include honey mustard. Why? If you're selling chicken nuggets or tenders, honey mustard should be an option.\\n\\nThe staff appears to not care about what they're doing.

The preparation style and flavor of the food seemed less like Ruth's Chris (or even Longhorn) but more like that one uncle who cooks really well. Like Chef Eddie's, but with steak! The ribeye I had was marinated in a house sauce, which might be off-putting to people who prefer the steak to be the \\"star\\".

Never have I experienced something like this. Their delivery driver is CRAZY and potentially DANGEROUS. I placed an order today at around 11:30 am and the food did not arrive until 1 pm, almost an hour and a half. Not too big of a deal to be honest. But when I received the call from the driver, he was not clear as to where he was at or where I should meet him. I told him I'll be downstairs, he said something that wasn't clear and just hung up. When I waited for a few minutes at the lobby, he called again with a much more belligerent tone, asking loudly where I am and telling me he would leave if I did not come to meet him, but he did not even specify which street he was on or what car he was driving. So I walked outside of the building and onto the streets, that's when he got out of his car while talking to me on the phone and he suddenly just screamed at me from across the street in a very threatening and aggressive tone. He was like \\"HEY\\", everyone on the street heard it and looked at him, and he started yelling things at me about the parking (which I do not have control of) while crossing the street. I have never experienced something like this from previous delivery drivers, this has got to be the rudest and scary encounter I've had with a delivery driver. Note that I never said anything rude or mean to him, in fact I was being as helpful as I can, I even said thank you when I took the food from him (which i regret saying) while he continued to degrade me. Stay away from their delivery service (driver was wearing dominos polo shirt and drives an orange/bright red car, middle aged). I even tipped him on the app, ONLY TO GET YELLED AT ON THE STREET, I will be talking to grubhub customer service about this, I am not paying you to yell at me and blame me for your problems (I get it if you're having a bad day, but this is just crazy).

Thanks to Errol M, Joe C, and Amy D for the wonderful evening.\\n\\nI think the only way to dine at Barley Swine is to dine with a group and order the entire menu, this is the only way - you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nI've never hit the character limit on Yelp before but if I try to describe in detail how much I loved each and every dish I just may.  So instead I will talk about the dishes that I absolutely fell in love with.  For those looking for every dish I tried, take a look at my pictures (I took pictures of every single one).\\n\\nTo my Denver peeps, Barley Swine is like the Squeaky Bean of Austin, TX.  Beautiful and artistic food with tasty foams and gastriques to scrape up with your mini spatula, yes I said spatula.  More places should offer these, a great idea.\\n\\nHighlights for the evening:\\n\\nHay roasted beets, mole, crispy rice and goat cheese - majestic colors from the beets and the way the texture of the crispy rice played with the goat cheese really made each bite magnificent.\\n\\nBrussels sprouts, bacon, hot sauce, hay, and hoe cakes - This was a fun playful dish that I just couldn't get enough of.  Anytime you add bacon to brussels sprouts I'm in heaven, and then hot sauce and little hoe cake medallions - truly divine.\\n\\nGoat, walnut, kohlrabi, fenugreek, wild rice, and green garlic - This may be my favorite for the night.  I'm a goat lover, you heard me.  The combination of all the ingredients was a real hit.\\n\\nDuck, foie gras, carrot, lavender, farro, and hibiscus - My first time trying foie gras and I have to say I'm a fan.  Texture was different but I loved the richness and the pairing with the duck.  Carrots were cooked nicely and presented in a way that had the table laughing (enter dirty minds here).  \\n\\nAll the desserts (three) were fabulous but the one that stood out for me was the milk chocolate ganache, sweet potato marshmallows, whiskey, and orange.  The sweet potato marshmallows had me speechless and not just because my mouth was full of them but because how does one even conceptualize sweet potato marshmallows.  I don't really want the answer I just want some more please!\\n\\nA couple important notes, the bacon broth in the lamb dish is a bit on the salty side so be prepared.  The fennel cream on the trout dish was intriguing and had something in it that kept me coming back for more.  New and interesting take on carrot cake, my first time eating a grilled carrot cake, it adds so great depth.\\n\\nNothing could have made this night more perfect.  Great company, fun and new food, exceptional service, and lots of laughs.  An amazing night on the town and totally worth the wait - just go!  You won't regret it."},{"name":"Yalla","address":"99 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Three stars for the three of us, but I don't call a bowl of pickled vegetables with a small smear of hummus a good value.

Sounds petty--but considering when the food is spicy and when some of your friends can't hang, it creates a dicey situation for them.\\n\\nWhat I didn't like about Clay Pit was that they served beef on the menu. This is the first Indian restaurant that I have ever been to that has had this item on the menu. I'm sure it's great for business, but definitely lost authenticity points for me.

Therefore, we checked in with the hostess and were informed that the wait would be about 15-20 minutes. We decided to stay and wait since it was likely that other places were just as busy. \\n\\nThey were consistently busy with people coming in behind us as we waited. This is something to keep in mind if you're looking for a grab-and-go place place to eat. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, we waited a few minutes before the server took our drink order. They have a full bar, beers on draft and in bottle, and they have wine. Some of the options they had on draft were impressive. \\n\\nIt was really hard to figure out what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu sounded delicious. You can see the chefs making the sandwiches in the kitchen which helped give us an idea of what looked good. I also checked photos on Yelp to see some of the favorites or commonly ordered sandwiches. Since we ultimately couldn't make up our minds, we each ordered different sandwiches (which would allow us to try more than one).\\n\\nAfter we ordered, the food was served shortly after. The sandwiches were DELICIOUS. I ordered the Bravas sandwich that came with a side of potato salad. Others in my party ordered the Le Mistral, The Bondir Brisket, and the Steak and Blue.

What a fun surprise if you like this kind of thing, I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone.  It feels like entering an alternate universe that's just a little different from ours. First of all, it's hidden (well hidden!) inside a hotel that's firmly wedged behind a fitness center. You'll definitely think you're in the wrong spot before you find out you're in the right spot. Park by the gym, walk directly behind the gym into the driveway for the hotel, go inside the hotel and straight past the front desk, go through the double doors and you'll find yourself inside a.... a what? Sort of a 50's style tiki bar? When we went, we ate inside the bar but you could see there was a full restaurant just beyond, I think they didn't open it up because it was a slow Monday night. The service is charming (like a stylish grandpa who gently teases you for ordering weak drinks but is ultimately funny and kind and helpful). \\nThe food- it's legit Thai food! Full disclosure: I haven't been to Thailand, but I've long loved Thai food and eaten it in a variety of cities. Columbus has a sad lack of Thai food, or where it does exits it doesn't appear to be prepared with care or something? So for the record, this place is the first one I've found so far in Columbus that serves Pad Thai with cilantro, peanuts, and lime automatically, where you don't have to ask for one or all three. The flavors were well balanced, and it was a hit overall, even if my noodles were a little bit soft for my taste. Of course I ate everyone else's food as well, and can recommend: the green curry, the papaya salad, the fried tofu appetizer, and the cashew broccoli (I think that's what it was called, it was a vegetarian dish with a great sauce, served with rice). So overall the menu is kind of short, but for that, there's decent variety in the menu and something for everyone (vegan, vegetarian, etc) and it actually tastes like Thai food. You can also order many things how you like them, for example the pad thai is listed as having shrimp and chicken, but you can just order one (shrimp or chicken) and they'll adjust the price for you.  Also on the menu, possibly in a nod to how surprisingly not-popular Thai food seems to be in central Ohio, there's a little section with American Chinese dishes for whatever reason- I assume because people asked for them? So not really Chinese food but more \\"Chinese\\" food- think Panda Express rather than NE Chinese- things like crab rangoon, fried rice, etc. (For those of you who are following the Columbus food scene closely, this menu is, in my mind, a mirror of Jiu Thai which serves excellent Chinese food and a small selection of kind of weak-afterthought-version Thai food. Moral of the story: go to Jiu Thai for your Chinese food and Thai Lagoon for your Thai food!)\\n\\nThe bar itself is a trip- really fun atmosphere if you like kitsch. But it also had a smooth kind of... cool grandpa vibe? The music was unusual as well, really chill smooth jazz covers of artists like Amy Winehouse. The whole thing felt like it was designed by a more upbeat version of David Lynch.

I was really looking forward to coming here again for the great food, and it's nice to have a good brunch place where you don't have to wait 45 minutes for a table and that actually takes resos. Although we were able to be seated right away at 11AM they do get busy close to noontime so call ahead just in case.\\n\\nHowever this experience was a bit disappointing. We ordered a clam chowder, 6 feature oysters (buck-a-shuck), a classic breakfast and a peameal bacon eggs benny. Firstly, the food took a long time to come out. It took almost twenty minutes for our bowl of clam chowder and oysters to arrive. Then another twenty minutes before our mains arrived. (The two tables beside us that had ordered after us had finished their mains by then). \\n\\nThe clam chowder was great like at my previous visits; it was flavourful and a big enough portion for two to share. The feature oysters were fresh too albeit a bit small. However my main was disappointing. They served under seasoned, soggy potato wedges instead of the great tater tots that I had months ago (I included an old photo). In the menu, \\"spiced tater tots\\" are still in the dish description so I feel like the restaurant should let the customers know about any substitutions. Another issue was with the hollandaise sauce; last time it was perfect but this time it was sour and had a strong vinegar taste. \\n\\nIt also didn't help that the bowls given to us were dirty (see photos).\\n\\nI was really disappointed by this visit.

Dark interior with cozy rounded booths, kitschy lamps, and large paintings of well....Conquistadors I assume....on the walls. The jukebox pumps out classic rock, and you'll be just as likely to find your feet tapping to The Kinks as you will David Bowie.

Okay....maybe not a first date, let's keep it classy....but after date 9 and you've seen each other naked....sure! \\n\\nFood is a simple but well rounded menu of nachos, enchiladas, etc., and done very well.  The Happy Hour menu gives you rice and bean bowls, chips and salsa(3 kinds of salsa!), and tacos, etc. I opted for the \\"small\\" nacho on the HH menu and it was beyond awesome.  A massive bow of chips topped with cheese, salsa, olives, jalapenos, and everything under the sun.  The value is unreal.  I could barely finish them and I probably should not have!

Plenty of top shelf liquors here and they use fresh juices.  When you see a clean bar and the use of fresh lemons that's a good sign!\\n\\nOverall a super great value place and a clean, well run place. Even though they had one person at the bar, she worked it like a pro and kept everyone happy.  That deserves some special mention alone!

There are currently five locations: Buckhead, Miami Circle (near Lindbergh), Westside (West Midtown), Vinings, and Brookhaven.  The business got its name from the original location in Buckhead on Pharr Rd.  This review is for the Vinings location, found inside the Vinings Jubilee shopping district (same shopping center with La Paz, Mellow Mushroom, Another Broken Egg Cafe).\\n\\nCafe at Pharr is a lunch place.  Most locations close in the afternoon.  This Vinings location stays open the latest, until 6pm, Monday through Saturday.  The restaurant is closed Sundays.\\n\\nThe restaurant is small and casual.  There's a bar in the center of the dining space and seating consists of a mixture of regular and high-top tables.  Clean and contemporary environment.  Big windows allow natural sunlight to fill most of the interior and photos of Atlanta serve as decor along one of the walls.\\n\\nI like the simple menu.  The specialties are salads and sandwiches, and they have soups too.  The most popular item at Cafe at Pharr is the walnut chicken salad.  If it's your first time, ask for samples.  They'll bring various salads out in sample cups for you to try.  Most sandwiches are priced at $7.50 each and most salad plates $9.00 each.  There are several different bread choices (white, wheat, multigrain, baguette, croissant) and all entrees come with red grapes and housemade yogurt rolls.  Take-out is a popular option.\\n\\nI've tried a handful of salads including:\\n\\nWalnut chicken salad\\nCelery chicken salad\\nCurry chicken salad\\nTuna salad\\n\\nThey're all good, so it's hard to go wrong.  The chicken salads are made with all-white meat chicken.  The walnut chicken salad contains crushed walnuts and golden raisins.  The celery chicken salad contains celery and mayo -- a very traditional chicken salad.  The curry chicken salad is the most flavorful of the lot and perhaps my favorite, but only by a hair.  It's subtly spicy.  The tuna salad is similar to the celery chicken salad.  It's another classic tasting salad.\\n\\nIf you order a sandwich, I recommend it on white bread or in a croissant.  The croissant bread is tasty -- soft, flaky, and buttery.  Speaking of croissants, Cafe at Pharr's yogurt rolls are made with leftover croissant dough.  The yogurt rolls are essentially croissants filled with a semi-sweet, creamy yogurt.  They are delectable and something the restaurant is known for.\\n\\nI prefer the salad plates, which are just as filling as the sandwiches.  Only one dressing comes with the salads and it's a housemade ginger dressing, which is served on the side in a neat little pour cup.  The dressing is light and vinegary and contains tiny seeds.  The salad itself comes with fresh, crisp lettuce, shredded carrots, and slices or ripe tomato.  Along with the aforementioned grapes and yogurt roll, a slice of bread is included too.\\n\\nIf you like soup, try one of their soups of the day.  I've tried the tomato soup and it is fantastic.  It's a little bit creamy, which I like, and full of flavor.  The chicken noodle soup, with shredded chicken, looks pretty good too.\\n\\nService is excellent.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm a fan of Cafe at Pharr's Vinings location.

Apparently they have live music sometimes which is pretty cool considering its in the airport and I've never seen that before.  However without the live music this just another airport restaurant.  \\nOver priced and underwhelming. \\n\\nI waited 35 minutes for a below average $13 cheeseburger and half cooked fries.  Nothing special to make it worth a 35 minute wait.  I wouldn't have minded but I was one of seven people in there, so it didn't make sense to wait that long.  To pass the time I drank a $6.50 Shiner that was almost cold when I got it.  \\n\\nThe music they played over the speakers was good, hard to hate classic rock.  Also, the service was fine.  On a final note, as I ordered my drink (after I ordered my food) I noticed what looked to be a cricket (but I don't know) crawling around behind the bar.  Wish I saw that before I ordered my food.

She's a huge fan of Ethiopian food and I've never tried it. I have always assumed that I would not like their food because the combination of spices and things they use remind me of Indian food, which I cannot get into.... but I digress. \\n\\nAnyway, I love the setup of the restaurant. Super casual, yet intimate setting which would be ideal for a date night. I also loved their music selection. They played West African music throughout our time there, so it was nice to hear some of my favorite songs from artists like P-Square and Davido. The waitress was also super welcoming and attentive. I really like that they cater to vegans, because it's hard dining as one when going to an African or Caribbean restaurant. I first started off with an appetizer, which were the Sambusas stuffed with lentils. They were....spicy! And I grew up in a Nigerian household that uses lots of spice, so that's saying something. I also felt that there was too much going in with the flavors though, so I didn't enjoy them as much. \\n\\nThen it was the dinner. I settled on the Miser, which was a vegan spicy lentil stew, and I ordered a side of rice and the squishy injera bread. My friend got the Fish Awaze, and a side of cottage cheese, injera, and the collard greens. She loved the fish, but we both agreed that the collard greens were yucky--they just tasted super bitter. I thought I would regret ordering my meal because the Sambusas were spicy, but the stew was actually not spicy at all. So the stew: There was too much going on for me. I couldn't get with the combination of flavors that was going on within my bowl. I'm one for flavor in my dishes and this stew wasn't my kind of vibe. Also the injera bread was not for me either. It left a sour aftertaste in my mouth. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish my meal. The rice was the only thing that made the stew bearable to eat. \\n\\nAlthough Ethiopian food is not for me (as suspected), Desta is generally good if you enjoy strong, aromatic flavors, like that used in Indian cooking. You'd have to try this place out yourself to make the decision!"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place lives up to the hype in all ways.\\n1) we arrived five minutes before they opened to find a line halfway down the block that filled the restaurant completely, all seats taken, two tables ahead of us. So when they say to get there early they're not joking around.\\nDespite this it only took about 45 minutes for us to get a table of three seated, if there's only you or you and a friend you can get seated within 30 minutes of opening presuming that you stood in line and waited for the doors to open.\\n\\n2) fortunately we will we were able to wait inside in a nice cubby area that was quite warm. I ordered drinks while we waited and they certainly did not disappoint. The pistachio rosewater white chocolate mocha will make your toes curl in ecstasy. Again, it's no joke. I was concerned it would be too sweet, but it was perfectly sweetened and the flavors were settle and not overpowering. They have truly mastered this beverage.\\n\\n3) I ordered the Saumon Fum√© on a gluten free English muffin. The salmon was mashed with just a hint of cream cheese to hold it together so it was not too heavy of a dish. One side was topped with the tiniest tomatoes and a gloriously zingy Dijon-dressed mess of greens. The other half was topped with a thin layer of perfectly ripe Avocado and an egg so gorgeous and orange that it took me back to Paris. Extra points for the gluten-free bottom, which was raised and fluffy, not like the dense hockey puck I was expecting. It was a little on the dry side, but this was easily remedied by the orange yolk and the moist salmon.\\n\\nTragically, we are only in peaceful, welcoming Vancouver for the weekend. Tomorrow morning we will return for breakfast again because it would be foolish to miss out on that mocha a second time! If you're in the area this is a must visit.

He engages his patrons, seems to know most of them on a first-name basis, gets to know them as individuals, and busts his a** to make sure they're 100% satisfied.\\n\\nSince customers have the option to eat their meal at the bar, too, I chose to eat there so that I could watch the game (....they've got flat-screen TVs at the bar). John's funny, attentive, highly intelligent, and he's been at this Unos for years.\\n\\nMake no mistake about it. This restaurant is great because John MAKES it great. He is the kind of guy you'd film if you wanted to make a training video on superb customer service and best of all, it's AUTHENTIC.  He's not faking ANYTHING. He legitimately CARES that the patrons there are served in a timely fashion and that they are fully satisfied with every part of their time at the bar.\\n\\nIf someone's salary were based solely on their customer service, the man would be making a seven-figure income.

The cornbread was warm and fresh. The potato salad and Mac and cheese were also solid. I normally don't like coleslaw, but I liked their coleslaw. The fatty brisket literally melts in your mouth as you take a bite. It's so juicy and you can tell they were smoking that for hours. For the pork ribs, the meat literally slid right off the bone and was so juicy. All 3 of their sauces were good and complimented the meat well, but the meat was good by itself too.

The food is on point but the service could use some tightening up. The design of the space could use some improvements for optimal sales and a faster checkout experience for customers which means more sales for you. I've been here several times and I've counted numerous people leaving after seeing how long the line is upon entering. Here are some suggestions:\\n\\n1. Please do GRAB N GO WRAPS in your cooler especially if these are your best sellers. When I walk in, it's never filled with anything but a few juices. I'm sure you know your numbers and data to forecast how many wraps need to be made during certain hours and how many of each wrap need to be made. This will tremendously improve speed of service and customer's experience.\\n\\n2. Pull out the juice cooler from the line and place it by the napkins and forks stand so that it's not stuck on the other side while customers are in line or get rid of the napkin stand altogether. Customers waiting in line can still grab a drink from the cooler while checking out. Every inch of your space should be used for up selling and a great customer experience. You can add your cookies and popcorn here as well. I've started calling in my orders and I can't buy more items because they're boxed in with customers in line. I get that people can pick up items as they wait in line but that neglects call in orders. \\n\\n3. If you can afford the labor, please have another cashier for pick up and GRAB N GO orders only separated from the main line cashier. I understand this may be a tall order. The call in orders need to be able to pay online some way so they literally come in and just pick up instead of breaking the flow of the main line thus bottle necking the entire line. Plus it feels awkward as a customer to feel like I'm \\"breaking in line\\" in front of all these low key angry customers. Your POS should have a mobile POS option where you can plug into your phone and get to work.  Please explore this option if you haven't already.\\n\\nI feel like you're working harder and not smarter. Your product is phenomenal but that's only half of the customer's experience. Don't rest on your laurels because you never know when another competitor may pop up and do your weaknesses exceptionally well with an ok product. I've seen it happen numerous times in my line of work.\\n\\nLAST BUT NOT LEAST, GRAB N GO, GRAB N GO, GRAB N GO, GRAB N GO PLEASEEEEE!! I never customize my wrap because you guys have an awesome product already. I've heard customers ask for the bbq option and whatnot but even then you can put those add ons in souffle cups for the add'l cost. I never heard someone ask for a wrap and completely scratch your ingredients and make up their own wrap and I've come a lot. \\n\\nTrust, I'm rooting for every BLACK OWNED BUSINESS and I love what you're doing for the community's health but please earn my money on every transaction and don't take it for granted.

A few other places I've tried to get pizza at were overpriced and didn't know what a stromboli WAS, so clearly they were off my list. But this place does a REALLY TASTY stromboli, complete with garlic-butter basting. The marinara sauce that came with the stromboli was fantastic - a really good flavor to it and even some chunks of veggies, which is something I adore. Lots of places skimp on the flavor with the marinara sauce, making it just out of pureed tomatoes and a few spices - but the best marinara sauce is made exactly like you make spaghetti sauce - in my house, this means without the meat that we would normally put in. The stromboli was chock-full of fresh-cut vegetables, plenty of cheese, and not light on the pepperoni or sausage. It was pretty much the best stromboli I've had since I left home - and let's face it, everyone has hometown pizza places that no one else can ever top, and Soprano's is really competing with my hometown go-to.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was family-friendly, with a lot of smiling faces and friendly staff. They have an eat-in dining area, and a few seats for those waiting on take-out. The pricing is very reasonable for take-out Italian (and eat-in), and can be anywhere from cheap to moderate, depending on what you're getting.

I would say this one was better than average with a few bright spots. We had a group of 10 including work colleagues, spouses and children, for dinner on a rainy Tuesday night.  The restaurant was maybe half full. It was pleasantly buzzy but not loud. They had a good happy hour special with $5 drinks and small plates, but we didn't order from that. Also they had a special menu for the evening with some featured whiskeys and food pairings. We ordered plates of the corn bread and a spicy shrimp appetizer which were both pretty good.  The corn bread wasn't too sweet which was to my liking. The waiter recommended the skirt steak from the special menu, and several of our party got that, reporting it flavorful and a good portion. I got the Applewood BBQ plate with chicken and pork, potato salad and collard greens. The chicken was very tender but just an ok flavor. The pulled pork was really juicy and much better than the chicken. Sauce was a vinegary Carolina variety. The collard greens were honestly more pork than greens, and not too flavorful. I was really hoping for some good southern greens and it just didn't answer that call. A couple of others got the fried chicken and it looked so good, I wished I'd ordered that.

It was the weird spring roll wrapper rice and kani filled \\"bun\\" I didn't care for.  They could leave out the fake crab and it would be good or better yet, make a rice bun (which I've had in Japan and is good).  The Taste Explosion Roll was pretty good, but I couldn't see myself eating a whole plate of it.  I'm glad I was able to split it with someone.  I have to say that their crab rangoon appetizer was really good.  If you like crab rangoon, get their deconstructed version!\\n\\nThe second time I went, the service was pretty bad.

However, the crust was a little flimsy for my liking and the toppings seemed most concentrated in the center of the pie leaving the outer crust areas with a relative dearth of flavor.\\n\\nOverall, I would eat here again--especially late at night.

I have to admit, when we pulled up in the strip mall, I had my doubts.  But, once you walk through the door, you are taken into a delightful restaurant starting with the warm greeting by a friendly gentleman.  \\"Sports Bar\\" is not an accurate listing (how it appears on Open Table).  The outside patio area is beautiful - we did not sit out there, but the heaters made it very comfortable even on a 35 degree evening.  The specialty cocktails are terrific - try the Ginger Rodgers, because it was amazing.  Our server, Carl, was fantastic and really made the evening with his excellent recommendations for appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and his friendly attentiveness; not to mention his patience with our group.  I had the citrus glazed salmon; it was done perfectly, not dry at all and the glaze not overbearing.  My husband had the special of the evening which was a red snapper in a puttanesca sauce with fingerling potatoes.  He devoured it.  A couple friends had filets, which came out nicely, as well as a ribeye that mouthwatering.  The grande finale was the dessert platter.  Only 3 people in our party of 8 wanted desserts, however Carl let us know that the desserts were all around $10, but you could get a platter of all 6 desserts for just $50.  My husband insisted on this, and sure enough, EVERYONE at the table absolutely devoured that platter.  The coconut cake was probably the best dessert - it was dense yet fluffy and the cream cheese icing was so delicious.  There was also a creme br√ªl√©e (basic), a flourless chocolate cake with homemade pistachio ice cream (a favorite), an apple bread pudding that was delicious, sticky toffee pudding (good, but not as good as King and Duke's!), and an ice cream made with Williams Sonoma peppermint bark.

The waitress brought our hummus/baba  appetizer but said that we would have to wait on pita because it wasn't ready yet. Really?!, Really? A Mediterranean place backordered on pita on a Saturday night? Seems like they might anticipate a need for pita as it accompanies just about every dish and have an extra amount at the ready. And why not just wait to bring out our appetizer until the pita was ready? What were we supposed to do? Dip our fingers in the hummus? On top of that, the baba didn't even taste like roasted eggplant; super bland. And most egregious, $18 for a pile of rice, 3 strips of bell pepper and 5 pieces of dried out lamb? Really?! I MIGHT have been ok paying $8 for that from a food trailer. But $18 for basically a plate of rice is crazy to me. If the lamb had been insanely delicious, maybe it would have been ok.

We ordered another round hoping they'd be better considering our server said they had been off that night and the bartender had fixed the recipe. Well the second round tasted like paint thinner. They were NASTY so I asked for the mix they use to try to fix the taste. That made it worse no joke I love sweet stuff and it was not good. So our server came back to check on us (josh) who is AMAZING and SO SWEET and he asked how everything was and I just asked if I could switch it out with a margarita since the drink was still full because it was gross... so the manager came over and was SO RUDE he gave me the biggest attitude and whipped out a menu to shove it in my face and tell me no returns or exchanges on alcohol. I kindly explained that this drink was terrible compared to the last and he started raising his voice and tone into an even worse manner, so I laughed it off and told him I can't wait to share this experience with my general manager at my job. I've never been treated that way and I've never heard of such a terrible rule? That literally makes no sense. The two drinks that I ordered were supposed to at least taste similar?

I did ascertain that it is a tapas-style restaurant, but that's about it. Now, I know why. Their menus are convoluted and cryptic, so no one would ever understand them without a verbal explanation. \\nWe were a party of four on a Wednesday evening. Since they don't take reservations for parties under six, we expected to have to wait at Angel Face next door, and fully and planned to. But upon arrival, we noticed that only 2 tables were occupied, and we were seated right away. The decor is fairly cozy and simple, with wooden tables and chairs, but pleasant. (Be warned, it gets very loud when full.) The server came over right away with water and menus, of which there were two - one featuring their regular menu items and one featuring their specials. And this is where it got confusing. \\nThe regular menu listed about 15-18 items with only one or two word descriptions. While that's fine for items such as 'Bread,' 'Butter,' 'Salami,' 'Cheese,' etc., it gets tricky when all it says is 'Hanger Steak,' 'Lamb,' or 'Bird.' When asked how those items were prepared, our server seemed annoyed (or maybe just disinterested) and gave the most minimal explanations possible. 'Lamb,' she explained was simply grilled and served with olive tapenade; 'Bird' was prepared in the oven, smoky not spicy. \\nThe \\"Specials\\" menu consisted of at least 25 items with 2-3 word descriptions. Yay, much more helpful! But the two menus together were a lot to get through. She suggested 2 large plates and 4-6 small plates for 4 people. For brevity's sake, I won't list all of the dishes, but the bottom line is that only a few of the dishes were in any way memorable -- the corn flour blinis with trout roe and creme fraiche; the pork pate; the kale salad with lemon and parm (while not inspired, it was fresh and tasty); and the fennel, pear and comte salad. The 'Lamb' was well-prepared, nicely medium rare, but lacked something. The 'Bird' turned out to be braised legs, thighs and wings in a stew (not at all what we were expecting), arriving in a crock with loads of gravy. She offered bread for dipping, but by then we had already eaten all our bread and din't want more. Moreover, the chicken was VERY dry - not what you'd expect from a braised meat, especially on the bone.\\nOn a positive note, their wine menu offered many options - by the glass, the carafe, 1/2 bottle and full bottle - at varying price points. I was surprised that a majority of the selections were French instead of Spanish, but that's not a complaint.\\nBased on the food we ordered, and the inherent value for the dollar ($278 for 4 people), I would not return to Navarre. I guess I'm glad I tried it, but there are just too many other restaurants in Portland to return to one that was just ok."},{"name":"Scramblers","address":"567 E Livingston Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"A little disappointed.

But when someone finally invited me down to check it out I was enthusiastic to see what all the excitement was about. \\n\\nI am still enthusiastic to learn what all of the excitement is about. And maybe I'll find it when I visit the new sister restaurant Luce. But of the many small plates I sampled on my visit, I didn't find anything that jumped out as anything beyond 'okay.'\\n\\nThe menu consists of varying sizes of plates that can be ordered off of what I can only describe as a sushi-style checklist. Read the list, mark down what you want, and they come pick it up and serve it more or less family style. The plates I ordered all turned out to be fairly small and while exciting based on description, were not as exciting in practice. In fact beyond the fairly generous bread portion (which costs $) I wasn't impressed enough with anything in particular to remember what I really had. Some greens, some lentils of some sort? Huh. \\n\\nI guess that I can't say I ate a full multi-course meal here but I did sample a few of the various offerings that I and my associates ordered and while I appreciate the subtlety of flavors in play here nothing ever really arose out of it. Subtle and simple without enough oomph or complexity to really amount to anything. \\n\\nI would like to come back and try more to see if I just came in on an off day or had an anomalous experience.

The fact we had to actually move our table for people sitting on either side of us to get up and leave tells you how many they smush together. I totally understand more tables equals more money but it was just a bit too tight for me and I didn't want to hear conversations on both sides of me; there was no way to tune them out so we heard a dad being condescending to his kid and putting him down, and on the side, heard a guy tell us how he wasn't sure what percentage of him was Moroccan but he knew he had some in him so that's why he was ordering the tagine. \\n\\n- The Medina iced tea was awesome. I could drink those all day. \\n\\n- My partner loved her lavender latte as well. \\n\\n- The waffles were nice and chewy. I wasn't a fan of the mixed berry compote and would stick to the maple syrup next time. I could easily eat 10 of those waffles - YUM! \\n\\n- My cassoulet was delicious. My only complaint was that they needed to rehydrate the white beans longer. They were still a bit hard and dry which took away from the dish. Other than that, everything in that dish worked really well together. \\n\\nSo why the 3 stars? As delicious as the food was, I don't think it was worth an hour wait. If it was 15 minutes, sure, but at an hour I wasn't blown away. I also felt the tables were too tightly packed. Also, maybe it's because I eat a lot but I wasn't full after eating 3 waffles and my cassoulet. The food is wonderful but the portions didn't match the price in my opinion. I wouldn't even mind if they raised it to $20+ for the cassoulet but put more stuff in it. In fact, the cassoulet was so delicious I would have paid $25 for it...just give me more!

Depending on which day you come, it can be a live DJ or Karaoke night. Sushi is usually pretty good but it's not consistent. It depends on who is working that day/night shift. Sushi combination overall is good. Philly maki or anything with cream cheese sushi combo is not my priority choice. I just don't like cream cheese in sushi but that's just my personal preference. It taste weird. Spicy salmon, tuna, caterpillar, unagi, scorpion roll, spider roll, rainbow roll, and anything along those lines are usually my choices for sushi/maki rolls.\\n\\nI prefer to dine in than take-out because too many occasions when I do take-out, the sushi is bad by the time I get it home and I live legit 5-10 minutes max from this restaurant. I don't even understand how it gets bad when it's Winter in New England. Scorpion bowl is good, I highly recommend it for ladies' night out or to share with a date. They won't let you get the Scorpion bowl alone so two people have to show their IDs and share. Salmon wonton chips aren't as oily as it used to be. However, I prefer salmon wonton chips from Fuji at Assembly. The salmon wonton chips here was mainly tomatoes and not as much compare to Fuji at Assembly (located in Sommerville). I was disappointed. Beef Tataki is good but if you're not in raw beef then you won't like it. I don't recommend their seaweed salad. It's mainly lettuce, especially when you do take-out. Why is there lettuce in seaweed salad? Fried ice-cream is not the best but still decent and satisfying.\\n\\nServers are usually friendly and knowledgeable about their menu choices.\\n\\nThey accept credit cards and I believe they're currently a Groupon, if you're interested in trying this place out.\\n\\nThere's street parking and parking behind the restaurant (big parking lot, shared among other restaurants/businesses).

I called 4 days in advance for a reservation and got in, no problem.  \\n\\nOnce we arrived we were seated promptly and the service was attentive.  Started out with some cocktails - a French Martini and an East Vangria.  Both were delicious, I'd highly recommend either, but the French Martini was a stand out.  \\n\\nAs an appetizer we shared the Alsacienne Tarte,  It was a puffed pastry tart with caramelized onion, lardons, cr√®me fra√Æche and ricotta.  It was quite good, but considering all the Yelp reviews that raved about it I was expecting a little more.  I'm glad I tried it but next time I'll branch out and try a different appetizer.  \\n\\nOn to the mains, which were the stars of the night.  I had the Canard Confit which was served on a warm salad of garlic potatoes, arugula, goat cheese and snap peas with port jus.  The duck was delicious - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside -  FANTASTIQUE!  I was so glad I chose that dish.  I also really enjoyed the bed of arugula that it was on - tastiest arugula ever.  Not sure about the snap peas though, yes I like snap peas, but the flavour didn't complement the dish.  My date ordered the Portobello Duchess, which was a portobello mushroom with saut√©ed mushrooms, duchess potatoes, and mixed greens.  I tasted it and it was also very good, especially those potatoes!\\n\\nThe portion sizes of the mains were quite large, but given there was a nice amount of greenery on each plate I was full but not stuffed, so there was room for dessert!  We shared the passion fruit tart, it was a little on the sweet side but the passionfruit flavour was spot on.  It was good, but next time I'll try the creme br√ªl√©e that everyone has been raving about.  \\n\\nIn total the meal came to $76 before tip - pretty reasonable, considering the quality of the food. \\n\\nAll in all, a fantastic meal, so why the 4 stars?  Honestly, I was a little put off by the attire of the staff.  The waiters were wearing skate shoes and shorts with t-shirts that had skateboarding logos on them.  The hostess was wearing shorts and just any old tank top.  Given the atmosphere it would have been nice to have seen a little more effort in their attire.  I'm not saying that they should have to wear white collared shirts or anything, but a pair of pants and something nicer than a logo-T would really help to improve appearances.  Considering the setting it just seemed to be a mis-match - most of the patrons were dressed much better than the staff."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Apart from dripping sweat in the 45 min line and dripping more sweat at our picnic table, this place is pretty bomb.

There are a number of tables with variations of sitting options (bar, for two or a sharing/group style) that are numbered for better organization. There's what appeared to be a full-bar, kitchen and ordering area in the back and as another plus I believe there's a parking lot and easy access to B-Cycle bike stations a block or two away. Dimly lit (at night at least) with lots of wooden furniture with titled walls and black paint. Great flow and floor plan!\\n\\nOne line that goes directing to the pick-up/register and a staff member is near the line to assist you with ordering prior to paying. There's a jug full of water for free at the bar if you need a refresher while you wait. The prices are a bit high but the quality of the food is worth the pretty penny! I ordered the mushroom burger with truffle aioli fries AND a salted caramel milkshake. OMG waay too much food but it was so tempting especially when you're hungry. So lesson learned, come hungry and pace yourself! Staff came around to the tables to check on your experience and if you needed anything else. Thumbs up for the waiter service!\\n\\nThe burger was super juicy and spiced, which gave it a bit more flavor. Melted cheese, mushrooms and bacon, delish! Burger comes on a brioche-like bun and I think somewhat toasted (?). Everything went perfectly together including the garlic truffle aioli fries!

First, contrary to the first reviews here, it does now have a liquor license, something that stopped me at first because I so enjoy wine with fine food. Second, the area which seems to be an enclosed porch-like place is quite cozy and warm while simultaneously allowing a lot of space for diners. I sat there tonight and marveled at the warmth and the lovely wooden ceiling. Tonight for dinner, my dining companion and I started with the spinach and paneer Momo. It was so delicious that I could have made that my entire dinner except that, alas, I had to share it! My entree was the shrimp tarkari, which was delicious! Uncertain about how hot 1-10 was, I opted for 5, which was quite good, but I think that I might be able to handle a 6! My companion had the rack of lamb and also found it quite tasty! This is a new restaurant, and the people there are quite earnest about pleasing their customers. The service is very attentive and wanting to please.

She's a light weight and advised me she felt no buzz.  I thought nothing of it.  So I get home and open my gumbo.  Taste it and I think my blood pressure went up right away.  It was soooooooo salty.  Additionally, my jungle juice was literally just juice.  So I messaged the restaurant on Instagram and was nice didn't ask for anything but just gave advice to ensure good quality was on point before delivered to patrons.  The owner replied, apologized, and offered to fix it upon my return.  Well, I returned last night for a friend's bday and immediately went to the owner to remind him.  Once again he advised he would take care of it.  I ordered seafood rolls again - this time they were good.  They no longer have jungle juice but three of us spilt a half pitcher.  The service wasn't great.  Everyone's food wasn't brought out at the same time.  Some of us were finished eating when other's food arrived.  I advised the waitress of what Corey - the owner had said and she immediately laughed it off.  I reminded her again and she came back and said he said you'll get 25% of your rolls and that's all.  (Confused face) So that's fixing it.  I went to Corey (the owner) and he immediately had an attitude. I advised him I spent a lot of wasted money in his established and he told me different.  He said to me I don't have to come there.  What?!???? I wasn't asking for a free meal.  You could've discounted my whole meal.  Additionally, you said you would fix it!  I didn't ask!  That said, I shall not be returning.  He's right!

Was told on the phone that a seat at the bar was all that was available all night, even if I wanted to walk in and wait for a table (this was not possible I was told). So we arrived and decided to try the bar seating, which in my opinion was the best seat in the house. The hostess who sat us happened to be the same person who turned me down for a table a few minutes earlier on the phone, and when I expressed my pleasant surprised at seeing the mini half-booth that was our seat, she said: \\"Clearly you didn't know what you were missing!\\" She was right. From this seat, you can peek into the kitchen, you can see what everyone else in the restaurant is eating, and you have constant access to the wait staff, who is walking by constantly. Only con was the lack of a footrest, which kind of makes you feel like a little kid whose feet are too short to touch the ground. \\n\\nService was lovely throughout. We were checked in on and waitstaff was very knowledgeable.\\n\\nFood was solid.

During dessert, I actually got to witness how the staff uses this charming contraption to make coffee, which was decidedly disturbing to my dinner mate (a coffee nerd), and which process prompted us each to simultaneously look at each other and try to keep our laughter at polite decibels.

I frequent the food court inside our Korean supermarket in Houston and all the vendors do a good to great job making all sorts of delicious Korean foods. I don't expect much from food courts inside malls or dorms, but if you're specializing in Korean food and you're established inside a Korean supermarket...use it! It's not like you have to ship delicacies to you every week because you're so far away.  If you've ever had Korean food at Dobie Mall's food court, this is worse.\\n\\nFirst, the rice they use is not the semi-sticky, short grain rice you'll normally find at Korean eateries. It's dry, it's not fresh and it ruins the meal for you if you've had Korean food before and love it. It reminds me of bad Chinese food. Rice is a huge staple in this cuisine, so when it's done badly you start to notice everything else that's bad.  There's a variety of good Korean rice they can use just thirty feet away, so I don't understand this.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the bulgogi (beef)--a pile of thinly-sliced, low-grade beef that's mashed together with onions.  The beef they use is worse than the kind you'd get at Taco Cabana.  Instead of grilling it, they sauteed it which would be fine if they had done it correctly.  What you get is a mound of dry meat sitting in a pool of watery sweet soy sauce.  I know people who would be ashamed if they made their bulgogi like this.  I would be ashamed, too.\\n\\nThe japchae (stir-fry potato noodles) was not any better because they made it the exact same way as the bulgogi with the same ingredients and just threw in carrots and noodles. Watery. Disappointing. Japchae fail.\\n\\nThe soondubu (tofu soup) was the only thing that tasted right but there's not much to be said about it other than it was edible.

He is talking to no one in particular and he goes on to tell anyone who will listen about the passion they have here at Hopdoddy. How they love fresh ingredients soooo much that sometimes they slap each other. They grind their own Black Angus beef, no..not like that. They actually use a meat grinder. As he sips his hop he continues to talk about how they bake their own buns from scratch and that they even cut their own Kennebec fries. \\n\\nDoddy tells us to get in line and enjoy. I tip my hat to him and we grab a menu and go over all of our choices. As we are deciding we order from the bar that we are lined up against. Quinn B. gets a Black Cherry Hard Limeade with Vodka, lime and Black Cherry Fiz for $6. You can choose gin if you like. Mr. Smidgens went with the Socosweettea....yes it is all one word. Deep Eddy sweet tea Vodka & fresh lemonade, served in a sugar rimmed glass for $6. As we indulge in our sips for grown ups we choose our burgers. We are helped by a cute little lady that takes Quinn's order first. She says she will write it down for us. Cool beans. As Quinn orders her Magic Shroom with a beef patty, Pure goat cheese, field mushrooms, and basil pesto the little lady inquires if QB wants everything on it. When QB inquires back about what else comes on the burger the little lady gets huffy...minus one star huffy puffy pants. As she sassily explains that all the burgers come with red leaf lettuce, white onion, ripe beef steak tomato, mayo & mustard I tell her to be gentle..it's our first time. She looks at me and smiles and the cute little lady was back. As the banter continues I decide to go with the Buffalo Bill as I apply my chap stick I imagine biting into the bison patty with , maytag blue cheese, Frank's hot sauce, and mouth slobbering apple-smoked bacon. \\n\\nMr. Smidgens and the rakish Quinn B. Decided to share the chili cheese fries $5 and a chocolate peanut butter milkshake. This tag team action \\nwas a win win sitch!\\n\\nAs we stood in line waiting to actually hand the order ticket to the cashier, pay, and get our table number we took in the ambiance of Hopdoddy. We laughed that some person had said the pictures on the wall were uninteresting. Really? Willie Nelson....Pine Top Perkins..uninteresting? How dare you! Llama....Number 34....excuse me? Your table number 34 Sir. Oh, hehe....thanks! As we get to our table we order more of the same from Steven who is so pleasant and very attentive. We chat about how we are in the path of the women's RR and how funny it would be if I was trying to chat up these ladies as they are on their way to go relieve themselves. It would go a little something like this. \\"Hey there. Gotta pee huh, well I will be here when you get back.\\" We had a big laugh. Hey look..our food! Everything we ordered was \\nOMG! The whole Hopdoddy experience was fantastic! The idea of waiting in line, ordering drinks while you wait in line instead of putting your name on a list and getting a pager whilst you wait with the other sheep for a table. This way you can drink, know what you want, and then when you get your table you can actually have a conversation without worrying what to order before the server gets back....brilliant!\\n\\nAs we walked out of Hopdoddy I heard a faint moo in the distance. I turned and it was Doddy. He was driving away in a pimped out convertible caddie. The moo was his horn. We exchanged smiles and we tipped our hats to each other. He knew with that we had experienced the freshness that is Hopdoddy....End scene\\n\\nDon't take my word or Doddy's word...experience Hopdoddy for yourselves and feel the freshness take over.\\n\\nHopdoddy......Winning!"},{"name":"The Waterfront","address":"4201 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This has got to be one of the best outdoor dining places in Orlando.

Then, the turkey and ham were neatly piled high.  Next, the bacon, lettuce, and tomato were fresh and well-portioned, and the American and Swiss cheese slices were thick-cut and delicious.

A beef pho at Huong's on Morse for about $8-9 has more flavor. \\n\\nThe Xi Xia noodles (no soup) were also bland. The meat (chicken & beef ) were over tenderized.

The flavors are good and are true to the geechee culture. \\nWe started with the bussin corn muffins, which were moist & had just the right amount of sweet potato pur√©e. I could've used a bit more honey drizzle, as it seemed to be primarily on the bottom of the plate. I'd definitely recommend them.\\nThey ran out of okra mix so we couldn't try this. The girl next to us said they were good though.\\nI had the drink that has all the alcohol but can't remember the name of it. I think it's either rough or rough it up, something like that. You can add a few flavors such as peach, blackberry, & strawberry. I think that's the right offerings. I had the peach and it was good. One was all I needed. My daughter ordered the uppity old fashioned and it was very potent. The bartenders are good at what they do! \\nFor the entree we shared the shrimp and crab gravy. This dish is yummy.

Probably the best street tacos in town. \\n\\nMy friend Logan R. inspired me to get on this review that I've been putting off for some time now. He gave Veracruz 4 stars and called the steak fajita taco \\"weak.\\" I strongly disagree.\\n\\nI've had all the lunch tacos at Veracruz (except the fish), as well as myriad locations all around Austin, and Veracruz trends at the top for best beef taco, and best \\"authentic\\" tacos. All their lunch tacos have the same basic ingredients--onions, cilantro, meat, and for 75c more, avocado, cheese, and pico.\\n\\nThe lunch tacos may have all the same ingredients, but the lack of diversity in their ingredients does not take away from the experience. In fact, the formula actually brings out the flavors of the meat.\\n\\nVeracruz's steak taco is amazing. You take one bite and you enter a stupor of culinary bliss. It's juicy. And just the right amount, too: it's not dry and  it's not overly juicy such that the juices drown out the flavor (and run down your wrist). The flavor is right. The meat is tender. The texture has varied from smooth to crispy, but in all occasions, I have never been disappointed.\\n\\nI give special regard to their chicken taco, whose flavor Veracruz has managed to push beyond the limits of normal chicken dishes. I generally choose chicken items for reasons other than pure taste preference (e.g., price, health), but Veracruz's taco redeems chicken as a legitimate culinary contender. The strength of their chicken comes again from its juiciness and the clearly discernible, savory flavor.\\n\\nHonorable mention goes to the Al Pastor taco, which will tantalize your palette with its unique (perhaps smoky?) sauce. Choose this one to change things up, or if you really like Al Pastor or pork.\\n\\nVeracruz's location and parking lot is not convenient. They share a small lot with a pretentious pinata store that jealously guards its parking spots with threats of towing [I have yet to see more than one car parked in its six or seven spots]. For lack of parking, I have had to park on Chalmers street and then walk through the gas station.\\n\\nAlso, the wait (including the line) can exceed a half hour at the busiest times. \\n\\nBut the best things in life are not free, and this is part of the price for some truly amazing tacos."},{"name":"Virgils Gullah Kitchen & Bar","address":"3721 Main St","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Ok, let me start by saying that I'm giving them 4 stars because I recognized the potential of what my first visit should've been!

You know, to wet our whistles. As we took our time and waited the allotted time before we were to be paged, we headed back to Barley Swine and sat outside at the tables they had for their patrons in waiting. We sat there like most people do, playing on their phones. I documented this, tagged, and posted it to FB so my friends could see how lame we were being by not conversing whilst we waited. We all got a good laugh. What's that buzzing in my pants? Oh, it's time!!\\nWe were taken to our seats and as we settled in for our dining experience, Jason James the manager asked us if we had ever been. We all said no. He said we were in for a real treat!

I think it may have something to do with the stories that The Bertram Building, c. 1853, is haunted.  It is said that party noises are sometimes heard on the second floor. Most likely it is the people missing from the empty tables.\\n \\nI love a server who knows his way around a menu. And Wolfgang certainly does.

You eyes will be dazzled by the art of noodle pulling and your taste buds will be comforted by the soft texture of these non-uniformly shaped noodles.\\n\\nI dropped by for a quick lunch on a rainy day and ordered the Beef Hand-pulled Noodles and the Dragon Roll. The noodles were delicious, as expected. Make sure to add a little bit of chili oil, even if you don't like spicy food. It provides that extra kick of flavors. However, I do have to say that the dish as a whole was quite boring. Besides the noodles, it was just a few beef slices and a ton of cilantro. That's it. For $10 after tax, it definitely feels over-priced. The dragon roll was below average at best. The pieces were small, the inside tasted soggy, and there was barely any unagi sauce. Not recommended, especially for $10.\\n\\nSide Note: Upon looking at the menu again while writing this review, I noticed that my bowl was supposed to also contain white radish, green leek, and bean sprouts. That would have made more sense. However, my bowl certainly did not contain those ingredients. Not sure what happened there.\\n\\nSo overall, this was actually more of a 3-star experience.

You can expect a wide selection of authentic Vietnamese cuisine at reasonable prices and an owner who knows her regulars if not by name then at least by what they eat.\\n\\n\\"Wide selection\\" is not used lightly here. There's no shortage of Vietnamese places with huge menus offering dozens of dishes, but usually they only hit the mark on one or two items. Vietnamese moms know that one goes to a restaurant for their Pho but not their Hieu Tieu and another for their Com but not their Goi Cuon (Spring Rolls). \\n\\nHien Vuong is an exception to this rule. In terms of American food it's like having one go to place that has great steaks, awesome Southern fried chicken, BBQ Brisket and backyard burgers. Hien Vuong does it all and the kicker is that it does it all pretty damn well. \\n\\nThe menu has seen additions over time but after 20 years of eating here these are my suggestions: \\nRice Plates (the Com Suon Bi Cha but especially the Grilled Chicken)\\nEgg Noodles with Duck (Mi Vit Tiem)\\nRice Noodles with Duck and Bamboo (Bun Mang Vit)\\nBun Mam is a great for the more adventurous palate\\n\\nThis list could be a lot longer and the truth is since I no longer have the luxury of eating here regularly whenever I go, I almost always fall back on the Vietnamese dish I love most...

If I had to eat one food and only one food for the rest of my life, I'd gladly choose Suya joint's moi moi. Again, it's the flavor in every bite that's just so beautifully balanced.

Beef version a little tough, but the chicken was cooked to that sweet spot where it's completely cooked but not at all dry. And again, the flavor!!!

I ordered the Mediterranean Veggie sandwich, which needs some work but it's still alright.  Nice hummus on tomato basil bread, tomato, cucumber, sweet peppers, and feta.  I would probably choose a firmer whole grain bread next time, and it's certainly an improvement overall from the rather bland sandwich in the past.  They just need to stop putting chunks of cucumber in the middle which makes the soft bread lump and tear apart. Really strange.  You would think sliced veggies would be a given on a sandwich!\\n\\nI have always been a fan of Panera's drinks.  Great iced tea with 3 different flavors, and an array of hot coffees and espressos.  They seem to have upgraded their coffee as well, not bad at all!  The baked goods have never been my favorite so I don't order any of that but of course it's up to each person.

One side of the menu is smaller, tapas-style plates meant to be shared, while the other side of the menu has larger portions. My friend and I decided to split some tapas-style plates so we could try out more things.

The scallion pancake had a crunchy, fried texture, which was interesting. I guess that's the \\"untraditional\\" part of it. The Thai pork lettuce wraps were not what I expected; the meat came in the form of meatballs on a skewer. Anyway, it tasted really good. The freshness from the lettuce and herbs paired nicely with the glazed meatballs, which might have been too heavy for me on their own.

I normally go to Tin Shed which I love! I decided to take the plunge and try somewhere new. First things first, they are listed under healthy restaurants but there is a ton of butter and oil in everything. Brussels were fried and decent but there was just too much butter. You don't need so much butter for good brussel spouts. A lil bit of oil and cook them in the oven and they are delicious. \\n\\nThe biscuit was pretty good but the consistently was more like a muffin.  Kind of dense for a biscuit but honestly one of the best things I had on the menu \\n\\nI ordered the cauliflower and lacinato hash and sadly was also not impressed. The potatoes and spice were tasty but when I ate the cauliflower and feta cheese together, it tasted like cellophane or something similar. Just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth! I have to eat eggs over cooked and completely scrambled or they make me sick (kind of a weird request I know). When I requested that they came out more like a browned omelet, they weren't separated. When they took it back I think they must have re-cooked them in a plate something else was cooked in because they tasted gross and the consistency was gooey inside. Not a fan! \\n\\n I ordered a side of chicken and that tasted fine! I also got to sample the butternut squash soup which was pretty good, although served chill which was unexpected. Being a cold day I didn't order it but would definitely have it in the summer! \\n\\nMy friend's pancakes were undercooked and gross as well. Sausage was fine except the aftertaste was greasy. Sausage is generally greasy but this was overly greasy.\\n\\nThe service was fine! She seemed a tad annoyed at my special requests but it also could have been because it was busy. She was nice otherwise. She removed the pancakes from the bill which was appreciated but didn't question much when I left over half my food untouched  I would have appreciated a follow up for that. \\n\\nOverall I'm giving it 2 stars. Too much butter/grease on things and I'm probably going to be sick from this meal . I'm kind of a food snob and while this may be good for someone who eats processed foods a lot, it wasn't great for me or my friends. And also when something goes wrong you should always get a manager to check in. Take ownership of mistakes. \\n\\nUnfortunately I will not be returning.

First, let's talk about it's BBQ style. What are you? Carolina, Texas, KC, Georgia? The entire meal was riddled with confusing food that just doesn't shine on its own merits. As someone who had dined on many amazing samples of the various BBQ styles, it was so very disappointing. So let's go back to the beginning of the meal. Drinks were a huge miss. We had the amber syrup Sazerac  and a special cooler...so forgettable I don't even recall it's name now. The Sazerac was so darn syrupy that it was just sweet upon sweet. Our appetizers were mostly meh. The salt and vinegar chips were just chips with no salt and no vinegar. The fried green tomatoes had a super dense breading that made everything rock hard. Again, such a confusing menu. You have a bit of everything on the appetizer side. Then comes our main courses. First, do me a favor. Pulled pork and chopped pork are NOT the same thing. The slaws and mayo based salads were more like veggies swimming in heavy cream. The brisket was bland as cardboard and the sausages were just a pathetic excuse of a tube of meat. No smoke flavor what so ever. But what we did have was rubbery meat with extra rubbery fat. And oh my god, black pepper everything. Like so much black pepper. And no salt. How is that possible? This place is truly the worst restaurant I have been to in Portland. It's like someone thought they could do hipster BBQ and all they got was bad food, mediocre whiskey selection, and overly cliche BBQ decorations. Do yourself a favor and pass.\\n\\nComment to the Owner:  I love your type.  You love to respond to negative criticism with disdain for the person writing the review.  How dare they leave a negative review?!?  So to you sir or ma'am, I say thanks for stalking me (creepy) and making broad general assumptions about me or if I am willing to discuss my experience.  Second, did you try to reach out to me?  Nope.  Instead you decided to take it personal and try to attack back.  Had you reached out I would have had a dialog.  Some of my negative reviews have had dialogs after from ownership that ACTUALLY cares instead of ripping the person who had a negative experience.  And as far as what direction I have to go, I wouldn't worry about me.  I'm doing excellent.  Maybe worry about the customer and there experience instead of my position in life."},{"name":"Top Burmese","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is so amazing, not only is the good absolutely delicious, but the owners are so warm and welcoming.

The aftertaste of drinking a sip of the green tea latte was also extremely fishy. I really wanted to drink the whole thing because it was so expensive, but I really couldn't bring myself to drink all of it. I probably drank 4-5 sips. It actually made me kind of nauseated and sick. In the end, my friend and I decided to leave and go to Tea Haus. Before leaving, I asked one of the workers if they purposefully made the green tea fishy since I know that some green teas have a fish/seaweed taste and he didn't know what I was talking about. He said it might be the chocolate which is a bit strange butttt obviously it was not on purpose so I guess I will never know where that mysterious fishy taste and smell came from.

So my first time to Yak and Yeti at WDW was yesterday. Let's start by saying I love the vibe of the Animal Kingdom in general but I really love the vibe of Asia, Yak and Yeti is just an extension of that. The decor is so cool, and you would never guess from walking by that there is a fairly decent sized restaurant inside with two floors. We were seated on the main floor close to the door. I really wanted to be upstairs, but we did take a walk around, and with how crowded and HOT it was we were not complaining at all to be seated at a table in the air conditioning.The person who seated us had a smile and was extremely pleasant despite the fact that people were pouring in trying to get tables with long waits just to try to get away from the heat. Our server was named Kayla and she was wonderful from start to finish. It was obvious that the restaurant was at full capacity and she had a large table of 14 people next to us which I'm sure is difficult but she never made us feel rushed and she was never anything but lovely. We ordered the well-known ahi tuna nachos to start and they did not disappoint people!!! This was my first time having nachos with wontons as opposed to tortilla chips and it was fantastic. It was beautifully paired with the delightful drink there called the Kiwi Kimono which I highly recommend. It has coconut rum, vodka, kiwi....not sure what else but it was very refreshing! We had 2 of those. My husband and I then shared the street tacos with Korean beef (that was off of the specialty menu)..... and my daughter had the sweet and sour chicken with jasmine rice. She also had a nonalcoholic strawberry daiquiri that was light and refreshing. All of the food was flavorful and presented beautifully. The street tacos were spicy but not too spicy. They came with a typical Asian slaw and a sauce. There were three of them on a plate with some french fries. The sweet-and-sour chicken was delicious because instead of having that deep-fried crunchy coating, it was much softer and juicier and it seemed like actual real quality chicken inside. The stirfry vegetables and pineapple that came with it were also delicious.

This place used to be so good! Unfortunately service and quality of food seems to have declined =( VIsited a week or two ago and had a cup of bermuda soup, which was much too salty and overwhelmingly rum-tasting. Yes, there is supposed to be rum, but the whole dish should not taste like you are ... drinking a very salty rum. Woof. Ended up drinking about two spoonfuls that was all could be handled. The lobster mac and cheese bites.... a big disappointment. These used to be loaded with little lobster niblets! Sliced one open and literally could not find a single piece of lobster. Griddled corn bread came with two pieces of plastic wrap stuck on the sides of the cornbread... meep. The large calamari was kind of ... lukewarm, not very crispy, and again, overly salty. We got the kind with spicy peppers etc but that didn't help much. Perhaps the only good item of the night was the apple crisp. Nothing extraordinary but nothing disappointing. For a ~$60 meal, pretty disappointed and definitely shocked to see how much food quality (and service... quite lacking for how not-busy they were) has decreased over past three years."},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"2435 S Hwy 27","city":"Clermont","stars":"4","text":"Love this place.

These were delicious, especially dipped in ranch. They were soft on the inside, yet crunchy on the outside. As for our main entrees, we all decided to get our own plates. I ordered the 3 piece dark chicken, which comes with 2 thighs, 1 leg, bread, slaw, and baked beans ($8.90). I upgraded one of my sides from the baked beans to mac and cheese for an extra 50cents, which was totally worth it! Also, I had to add a Sweet Tea ($2.50), which comes in a souvenir cup with free refills. I definitely went through multiple refills of the sweet tea as it was refreshing and nicely paired with my chicken. The slaw is on the creamy side while their mac and cheese was cheese topped on cheese --so damn good!\\n\\nEverything from the fried chicken to the sides to the sweet tea was amazing!

Though many called them crazy for going to a single restaurant so many times, they didn't let the haters distract them from persevering and finally achieving their goal, 3 months later. I am now here today to tell our story and share our ultimate, undisputed rankings of all 19 Parish Caf√© sandwiches (though really this is up to personal preference so feel free to dispute it).\\n\\nOkay folks so I wrote my first review about Parish Cafe and gave it a 5, which I don't give that often. This place is unassuming, has a cafe feel, and serves the humble sandwich, but it earns its 5 stars. The service is great, the prices are reasonable given the portion size, and I have never left her feeling unhappy. I said it in my first review and I'll say it again. I love how this place elevates the sandwich and has 19 different ones created by different chefs around the city. I know I joked about going to the same restaurant so many times above but in going to this restaurant, you are almost getting a taste of Boston by trying the different sandwiches created by the different chefs of Boston.\\n\\nWith that said, I would like to share my ranking of all 19 sandwiches based on my personal preference (plus pictures of every single one). I also had the bread pudding which is PHENOMENAL. A few caveats:\\nI should first say that what I like is not necessarily going to be what everyone else likes so please know that. Two sandwiches below have horseradish cream and bleu cheese which set them way back for me because I don't like either of those things.\\nI am also a big meat eater so I am inherently biased against the meatless sandwiches (and you will find most of those at the bottom of the ranking).\\nI will also not judge sandwiches based on their sides...the sandwiches either come with potato chips, potato salad, cole slaw, or mixed greens and to be (somewhat) healthy, my friend often just went with the mixed greens.

I think this happens to me when I hear a lot of hype about something and I often end up being a bit disappointed.\\n\\nI had the famous waffles with the lavender milk chocolate sauce.  It was tasty but I found it very thick, more fondue like.  I preferred the consistency of the raspberry caramel and white chocolate pistachio sauces, but the taste of the lavender milk chocolate was fabulous.\\n\\nTo be honest, the waffles were only OK.  They were lukewarm and not that crisp on the outside.  Presentation was very pretty but so not worth the $3.10 per waffle IMHO.  My eggs on the side were excellent.\\n\\nService is also only A-OK.  My glass was empty a number of times before someone came around and the server appeared flustered/annoyed with dealing with the bill for the large group.\\n\\nI'd come back but definitely not worth the line-ups I saw.

Tons of seating, charming atmosphere, huge menu, and great drinks. \\n\\nCherrywood's kind of a jack of all trades. Not only is it a great place to come to spend time with compadres, but also a great place to get some work done. How is this possible? Cherrywood has a ton of space. There's an extensive outdoor scene (that sometimes features live music) and plenty of seating indoors. You can separate yourself from the social crew by remaining indoors and in the sectioned-off space, which is where most of the worker bees flock.\\n\\nOkay, I now you're too ashamed to admit it, but you're wondering--how good is the people watching here? It's not bad. It's not as visually stimulating as other hipster stalwarts (e.g., Thunderbird or Spiderhouse), but you're certain to see some interesting people here. With good reason, too. Cherrywood has something for everyone.\\n\\nCherrywood's food is good. They certainly have a wide enough selection that you can get something you like. I've mostly kept to the tacos, which are probably a little bit more expensive than they should be. Go for the fish tacos or the pork poblano tacos. If you don't dig on swine or fish, there are a ton of options. My only regret in life has been not branching out more when I go to Cherrywood. \\n\\nAs for drinks--again a huge selection. They have everything you would expect them to have at a coffee shop, plus adult beverages, mundane beverages (milk, orange juice), and smoothies. I especially love their ice tea and their peanut butter smoothie.\\n\\nParking is a little bit of a hassle--most times I've gone, their small parking lot is full and I've had to park up the hill in the residential area. It can be a bit of a drag because  the street you have to cross is always busy and there's a curve that's hard to see around.\\n\\nBut don't let that deter you. Cherrywood gets top marks in my book. Definitely a strong candidate for your next go-to place."},{"name":"The Painted Pin","address":"737 Miami Cir NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hip and chic come to mind.\\n\\nEntered through the big steel door and welcomed into a whole different world!\\n\\nRelatively new equipment.

The atmosphere was cozy as the restaurant is smaller so to optimize space they have bench seating along the walls with tables and chairs towards the interior of the room. Was expecting the set up to be more intimate for the prices. I was slightly disappointed that I was seated right on the corner to the kitchen and bar but I suppose with it being fully booked every weekend someone has to sit there. Morale of the story the food is delicious but the atmosphere detracted from the experience. I'd recommend skipping it for the first date and saving it for someone worthwhile that won't mind a tight dining experience. \\n\\nHighly recommend the  Selezione di Affettati misti e to begin with as it's great for sharing and gives lots of variety. The Sformato di Parmigiano was interesting, much lighter than I thought it was going to be, I think it's worth trying but has to be in addition to something. \\nAgnolotti del Plin was cooked to perfection but I was missing a flavour component. While the sauce complimented the dish and I understand why they didn't want it to over power the veal and spinach stuffing, I would have preferred it to be slightly richer. \\nMaltagliati all'Amatriciana was my favourite dish out of them all and highly recommend it. \\n\\nAs a side note be cautious of the staff, our server was determined to up sell dishes which was slightly annoying when we had two of the same starter dishes come out and hadn't agreed to it. I understand he may have thought 4 people needed two souffl√©s but with two tiny girls, an additional starter plate and pasta dishes to go around it was a bit over kill."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"825 Battery Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place really makes you feel that you're in a special place. The atmosphere is really nice and high end. The service was friendly and professional and our waiter was helpful and timely.\\n\\nThe menu is eclectic and quite varied. I settled for deep fried cheese curds as an appetizer, the were spot on good. I ordered a quesadilla with asada for dinner and it was good, not great. They do something weird with the cheese. It seems that they pan fry the quesadilla in cheese after it's assembled. What that does is leave you with a chewy exterior shell. Nice flavor but really hard to cut with a knife or chew. It also makes it extremely greasy. The flavor was good but I'd nix the outside cheese, it doesn't need it. The steak and peppers and onion and cheese filling was very good. The sour cream and salsa need larger cups to accommodate the quesadilla as it is a good size. All and all, very nice. I'd probably try something different next time."},{"name":"Viceroy","address":"1132 W Dillon Rd","city":"Louisville","stars":"2.5","text":"I was exploring dinner options yesterday and although I am a fan of Tao Fusion now (yet to be written up), it just wasn't calling me.  So I explored Indian, and came up with this place Mike reviewed.  So be it.  It was after 8pm on a Sunday night, and I questioned whether the place would be open or not -- it was.  Hurray!  1/2 pt for being open that late on a Sunday night in Louisville.\\n\\nEntering, the perception one gets is very modern and eclectic.  Plush, comfortable -- and WIDE -- chairs mix with lights hanging from wavy metal supports, warm-toned backless chairs at the bar, and 'curvy' architecture.  I can't really describe it well, so some of the pics I took will try and do it justice.\\n\\nThe owner apparently has been restauranteuring for 13 years, used to own India House in Denver, and had places in Lakewood and Boulder.  He is very hopeful that business will start picking up.  If my visit, his hospitality, and the food quality is any indication, word will get around.\\n\\nI ordered the stuffed naan, the assorted veggie sampler with pakoras/samosas, and for my main course the lamb...kifta korma?...seemed to hit the spot for my craving.  The naan was very good but someone screwed up my order and gave me the \\"plain\\" naan instead.  Still very tasty and soft, but not what I paid an extra $1.50-2 for.  The sampler was very good, but I only had 1samosa in mine and i was expecting 2.  Don't get me wrong, for $8 there was a bucketload of pakora in there...but just 1 samosa?  The pakora were...interestingly formed, like they had been cut up after they had been fried, and...well, it was very tasty, but not mind-blowing.  That crown still belongs to Nepal Cuisine in S. Boulder.\\n\\nFinally the main dish, the lamb, was very succulent, a goodly portion delivered in a delectable sauce with cream, spices, and other Indian magic.  I completely skipped the rice, because...I'm just that way sometimes with \\"empty\\" carbs.  I dipped the pakora into the savory sauce and think it improved with the mingled flavors.  There was chutney and some cucumber sauce as well, which I had the next day for lunch with the rest of the pakora and half the lamb.\\n\\nFinally, their register was not functioning and therefore they had to write out a manual credit card bill...\\n\\nSo...overall, really very good and a unique place architecturally inside.  The music wafting through the place seemed to be either soft jazz, new-age tinged, or both...no 'authentic' Indian music that I could tell.  Seems they're trying to find their identity??  No problem...and everything was reasonably priced too.  Uploaded some pics as well. (Gee.  Now I only have 4-5 more reviews to spew out...=^p )  I believe their lunch buffet is $8.95 for all you can gorge.\\n\\nOh.  Their website?

Terry Black's is what I imagine for barbecue but somehow exceeded every expectation I had. It is not located in a very walkable area, but you won't be sorry. It is a very spacious restaurant with excessive seating indoor and outdoor. They let you pile up your plate with 2 sides (pile as high as you'd like! We went a little overboard...) and then you pick your meat and drink.\\nChopped Beef Sandwich - the chopped beef was recommended by the cashier. It was so delicious! The beef was tender and tasty and the sandwich was enormous! It came with pickles and onions as well. I added original barbecue sauce and I could not have been any happier!\\nCole Slaw - THIS is what I expect for a cole slaw. It was refreshing, not too thick and a little sweet. It was probably the best cole slaw I can say I have tasted.\\nBaked Beans - delicious! There was nothing truly unique.

I especially loved the portobello and asparagus salad, which was excellent. What was not so excellent was the immense pain I felt shortly before receiving the check and realizing that somewhere in my meal I consumed gluten. What frustrates me is that I continued to check at multiple points throughout the meal that it was gluten free and safe for me to eat and every time I was assured that it was! I don't know which part of the meal was contaminated, but when I told the waiter that something was - he couldn't care less!!
