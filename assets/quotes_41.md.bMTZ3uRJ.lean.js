The pizza and spring rolls were unbelievably delicious. We met some great people and even went out for dessert with them afterward. But here is where the experience began to sour...\\n\\nI'm sure the lamb would have been fantastic. Unfortunately, Kathy Cafarelli was one of the rudest proprietors I have ever encountered. When my dinner came and I asked if a server could take my credit card and bring me a glass of wine, she rudely told me I could go to the bar (in the restaurant) to get a glass of wine. When I did that, after paying $200 for tickets to the show, the bartenders did not have the wine I was drinking and had to go back to the room I was told to leave in order to get the wine. After waiting 10 minutes for my wine, I returned to The Cooking Show where literally every single person had finished eating and had their plates removed.\\n\\nI saw Kathy Cafarelli and asked if I could talk to her. She begrudgingly agreed, but it was apparent she had no interest in hearing what I had to say. When I tried to provide feedback regarding how I would have appreciated a server taking my card and bringing me a glass of wine so I could have eaten my main course hot, she was completely unwilling to accept any type of feedback. In the 10+ years that I worked in the restaurant business, I have never seen a proprietor disregard honest customer feedback regarding his/her experience.\\n\\nShe let me know, \\"that everyone was served the same amount of wine and if you decided to drink yours before the main course came out, then I don't know what you want me to do.\\" \\"The wine service time was over. The show was over.\\" I let her know that I wanted a server to take my order so I could have eaten my food while it was hot and that I didn't care about the cost. She informed me that, \\"I mean we have been doing this for 10 years and this has never been an issue.\\" At no point did she apologize for the fact that my main course was cold, nor did she try to remedy the situation so that I felt the feedback was received.\\n\\nLong story somewhat shorter, if it was only Chef Liz running the show I would go on a weekly basis.

I'd lean towards 4.5 stars but there were a few minor notes that left me wanting.\\n\\nWe began with cocktails....I had asked if they had a Sazerac which unfortunately they weren't familair with, but the Booker's Manhattan they made for me was wonderful and the maraschino cherries were homemade from what I could tell which I can apprecaite wholly.\\n\\nFor satrters we tried the Brussel Sprouts appetizer which was layered with all sorts of flavors combining into one amazing profile. These were really a solid starter where the almonds and the pancetta added so much to this dish I would've loved to take an order home. Next we tried the Lobster Johnny Cakes which could be described best as a stack of corn cakes with lobster meat and a creamy stock sauce to accompany. These were also a solid appetizer, so much so that my colleague grabbed most of the dish for himself himself before the soup came. These were pretty tremendous and I'd recommend them highly! The soup was a special that day....a chorizo bean puree. It was pretty heavy on cumin and tasted similar to a smooth chili. It was decent but I wouldn't order it again. \\n\\nThe entrees that piqued my interests were a choice between the pheasant, the rabbit, the duck, and the surf and turf. I opted for the two-in-one and ordered the Seared Scallops and Ohio Pulled Beef with White Cheddar Grits and Sauteed Spinach. It sounds tremendous right?!...it mostly was. The scallops were perfectly cooked although I would've liked a little darker sear on them, and the pulled beef was flavorful and unctuous as you'd expect. The sauteed spinach was bitter and delicious but where the dish fell short, to my dismay, were the cheese grits. They were still very good but I didn't get any real cheesiness from them nor the flavor of, and more importantly, the texture was wrong. They were tight like a polenta rather than smooth and light like a low country grit. It was one solid mass of polenta that was saved by the beef stock at the bottom of the dish, which was very very flavorful.....so much so that I spooned it up when I was finsihed with the main.\\n\\nThe service here was almost flawless. The maitre d' could've been a little friendlier but our server Tim was legit!

Whereas before I could count on some of the moistest most flavorful brisket I've ever tasted (and definitely the best I've had outside of central Texas), lately the brisket has been less flavorful and significantly drier.  While it's still the best brisket I've found in Colorado, it isn't on par with the best brisket places in central Texas the way it was previously.  I'm not sure what exactly has changed, but the bark has been noticeably thinner on the servings I've had.

We stopped in on a cold, rainy evening, and it really hit the spot!\\n\\nFirst, this isn't a place you come to eat light or healthy. The portions are fairly gluttonous, and the items that don't necessarily scare you in size, will hit you in their heavy preparation. This isn't a complaint, but a fair warning! Come hungry.\\n\\nWe had a wonderful server, who was friendly, attentive, and really excited about the food and cocktails (in an authentic way). She warned us of the portion sizes and guided us to relatively-sensible decisions. The service never dropped, even when the place began to fill up and her workload increased. We were impressed!\\n\\nAs for the food, nothing was necessarily mind-blowing, but everything was good. We tried the fried chicken, the fried chicken sandwich (we were craving fried chicken, in case that wasn't obvious), grilled corn on the cob, mac & cheese, biscuits, and the apple crumble dessert. We had no complaints at all across all the dishes. The chicken was nicely breaded and fried. Not overly breaded, and not soggy at all. The sandwich was all juicy thigh meat and had a perfect amount of heat, with the cheese and sauce balancing it out. The mac & cheese was heavy, huge, and satisfying. The corn was too saucy for my wife's preference, but it was still good. Note on the sauces: ask for extra napkins, as they have a heavy hand when it comes to sauces. Their biscuits are huge and rich, as you'd expect, and the apple crumble dessert, while nothing spectacular, hit the spot!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is as non-pretentious as the food and the prices were fair for the amount of food that arrived. Southern Proper is a place you go for familiar dishes done well. They're not introducing anything new to the southern food spectrum, but that's okay. Walking in, you're not expecting anything more, and when you leave, you won't be surprised or disappointed by what you ate...especially if you're craving southern food in Boston.\\n\\nOverall, if you're looking for solid southern-influenced food, Southern Proper is definitely worth checking out.

It's just a restaurant inspired by  hawkers around Asia. It's located around Viet-town, but the crowd here? Dunder Miffliners for sure. There must be a bunch of corporate offices in the immediate area. \\n Fine. We accepted it, now let's get to parking. There's about 3 spots, and of course 0 out of 3 were available. We had to be patient. When we finally stalked a spot for about 15 minutes we stood there at the front a fairly packed house, with a couple of tables available. Nobody greeted us for about 20 minutes and there were other parties waiting for a table too. They were kind of upset as well. Eek. \\n\\nNot looking good Hawkers. We sat down eventually and ordered several plates as this is a Tapas oriented joint. As my main dish I had a volcanic-like Curry Laksa. It was delicious.

The ubiquitous complimentary chips and salsa is better than the bag and jar stuff that some places in Boston try to pass of, and is brought to a whole new level with a few splashes from the bottle of hot sauce on each table.  Margaritas are great, as long as you are very specific about your desired ingredients, and the carafe of sangria is the perfect choice to wile away a Sunday afternoon.  A good mix of cinnamony and sweet, the only thing lacking is those colorful chunks of fruit, as others have pointed out.  \\n\\nThe wait staff is efficient, if not a bit quiet.

She left and reappears a few minutes later with glasses that appear to be just as dirty, except  around the rims.  She opened the wine, pours a bit for tasting and completely disappears to help the table next to us.  Our water glasses are empty.  By now, there is one other  table on the patio, a table of young, childless folks apparently out bar hopping.  Which was fine except for the fact that this table was seated so close to us they could've been part of our table, literally so close the tables almost touched.  On large empty patio with one other occupied two top at the other end.  And the bar hoppers were drinking, a lot, and swearing, a lot, and my 6 year old is now in my lap and the 11 yr old moves to the other end of the table because the other table is crowding him.  And, it's a celebratory event for our family.  I mention that we would like more bread for our tasty appetizer dip,  my drink arrives and I mention it again.  The dip is now cold.  And the food comes.  One dish, two, three.  No more.  Wait 5 minutes, another two plates arrive,  we're waiting for everyone to be served, and we're told the last dish will be a few more minutes, cause it takes longer.  The two people without food tell the rest of us to eat, while the food is hot.  We take a bite.  It's the first and last bite several of us take of our meal.  The bread comes for the cold dip.  Our water glasses are empty.  The final two dishes arrive.  One diner takes one bite of the extra time needed dish.  It's inedibly salty.  Our neighbors discuss subjects best not described at a table with children using terms I prefer my children don't hear as the waitress asks if we'd like boxes for our untouched food.  Children are removed to the car and senior adult asks to speak with manager.  Manager says he could see right away the seating was a problem, the group shouldn't have been seated that close to a family.  Manager is however not really the manager as the real manager has left for the evening.  Not-manager manager apologizes and offers us a gift certificate to come back and try them again.  We arrive at the car and look at the gift certificate we've received and laugh.  For a miserable meal of 5 adult and two kid entrees, a bottle of wine and drinks and appetizers, that we paid in full for, the not manager has given us a gift certificate for $30.  Yeah.  If anyone wants to try it, you're welcome to it, because I'm not certain they are capable of improvement.  I'd give this disaster 0 stars if I could.  Pretty much the pinnacle of the worst.  Avoid."},{"name":"Oga's Japanese Cuisine","address":"915 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"I went to college not too far from Oga's and remembered it being good.

If you like bacon, you'll love it.  Canoe also smokes their own salmon (which is awesome) and their own canadian bacon for the fried green tomato benedict.  Sticky buns were good but I'd opt for a full basket of scones next time if sharing with a group.  We dined indoors both times as the weather was nasty.  Atmosphere is cool, clean and the food is awesome.  If Canoe wasn't so far from our house, we'd dine for brunch much more often.  Well worth the drive up from South Atlanta.

It drew me in. 7 more months to go until I can (legally) drink, and the bar at Jack Allen's caught my attention. \\n- Bruch offerings spanned Southern/Southwestern cuisine. House Cured Ham, Mama's Sunday Chicken, and Jalapeno Pork Sausage were personal favorites. \\n- Service was top notch. \\n\\nThe Bad\\n- Shepherds Pie. Flavorless. No amount of salt could have saved it. Chicken Fried Pork Tenderloin was equally under-seasoned, smoked salmon spread tasted like it used canned as opposed to smoked fish and contained massive chunks of plain cream cheese. \\n- Out of the entire buffet, my little brother and I only enjoyed 3 items.\\n\\nThe Verdict \\n-  Look. I understand that, at a buffet, every item is not expected to be spectacular. However, an eatery of Jack Allen's reported caliber should sport a tastier buffet.\\n- I'll be back. Maybe the kitchen is still trying to figure out buffet logistics? Or we caught them on an off day? The a la carte items on the dinner menu sound delicious, and Jack Allen's seems like a \\ndate-night kind of place.

The menu claimed that it had \\"cured egg yolk.\\" That sounds sexy and exciting, right? And might be the reason you'd order an otherwise boring-sounding dish, right? Imagine our surprise when a plate of plain ole raw radishes shows up in a tub of butter with a fairy dusting of cured egg yolk that nobody at our table could taste. That baby costs $8. For the love. And bread service? Better proportioned for elves.\\n\\nThe kale and lentil salad, however, was spectacular: well-dressed and seasoned. Delicious. The whipped ricotta tasted like air, so that flatbread dish was a miss overall. The grouper was awesome, but why nothing to sop up the sauce (oh, more elf bread? no server to be found). The veal dish was equally impressive, but the portion was so small that we each only had one small bite. And the lamb three ways: the rib way was 99% fat and kinda gross.\\n\\nService started strong, but then went downhill. Drinks didn't come out together and weren't even on the table when the first dish arrived. Our waitress was lovely, but she was also gone for parts of the evening (i.e. we didn't have a chance to get a second round before the mains came out). We skipped dessert.\\n\\nThe restaurant space itself is quite nice, and we did enjoy much of what we ate, but the radish thing appropriately put a bitter taste in our mouths at the onset.

Umi shares valet parking ($2 not including tip) with Chops. That is how I found the restaurant. I put in their address instead. I couldn't find the location when I put in Umi in my GPS.

We had to ask why happened to it. :-( The spicy tuna crispy rice was not as we expected (see pic), but was pretty good. The edamame was nothing special though there was tons of it. My guy got the miso soup I got the avocado salad. He liked the soup. I did not like the \\"salad.\\" I gave it my guy and he liked it. The wasabi flavor was just too much for me. My roll was the veggie roll. The carrot ruined it all in my opinion. Way too hard. Note that menu did NOT mention that there was carrot in it. What the heck. My guy got the rainbow roll and the otoro caviar. The rainbow roll was pretty good, but he wasn't a fan of the soy flavoring added. He wanted a more simple version.\\n\\nI don't know too much about sushi, so my opinion is worth only so much. I can say that I wasn't a big fan. Alone, I thought it was 3 stars when in the restaurant. In my guy's opinion, the taste of the food was definitely not worth the price. He preferred another sushi restaurant we went to on a previous visit. He gave it 2 stars. As I wrote this review, I realized that I started to lean more toward his score. 2 stars it is.

Tyler recommended that we get the BBQ platter. It was $62 and had a great assortment of meat (bbq chicken, beef brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and rib) plus beans (spicy), cornbread, white slices of bread, and fries - plus we subbed out the coleslaw and regular potato salad for a hot potato salad because of the mayo in the slaw and potato salad. \\n\\nNeither myself or my wife felt like drinking on this night as we had our two youngest with us, and Tyler never gave us a hint of that being an issue - which was great. The food was more than enough for the four of us. Our favourite meats were the beef brisket and pulled pork - sausage also very good. There are different BBQ sauces that go with the different meats if you ask for them. But the beef brisket BBQ is just the best!!!!  . My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I really enjoyed the hot potato salad, which was a baked potato with chives/ real bacon/ corn/ sour cream - diced up like potato salad.  Really good. The beans were spicy, our oldest son didn't eat them because they were too hot for him.  \\n\\nWhen it starts to get busy, the wait staff end up a little overwhelmed.

There is a good amount of street parking and they also have Valet. \\n\\nGetting a reservation... tricky, but worth it. They only take Tock reservations once a month and they fill up within minutes, yes the entire month fills up within minutes, so make sure you know exactly when you want to come and how many people. There is also a $25 deposit taken per person when you book your reservation, but it is taken off of your bill when you come in. \\n\\nThings to know: this will be an expensive night out. All of the ingredients are sourced locally, and they are the best of the best quality. Get over it, trust me, it is worth it.

The servers wear jeans and t shirts, Outkast is playing, and it feels like you are eating at a friends house who happens to be an amazing chef. \\n\\nOur server was amazing. He helped us figure out the order everything should come out and had great suggestions for us. Everything is locally sourced and each dish was explained in detail to us as it was brought out. \\n\\nWe started with the Chicken Liver tart... DEAR HEAVEN stop what you are doing and eat this tart. It was the most delicious tart I have ever eaten. I'm not even a chicken liver fan, or at least I am now, I feel like I was in the chicken liver dark ages and this was the chicken liver renaissance. \\n\\nNext was the steak tar tar, again, amazing. So flavorful, divine. \\n\\nNext up, a pasta that I didn't write down in the moment because I just wanted to put my whole face in it. Light, fluffy, fresh, tasty, I took a picture, don't worry. \\n\\nNext potato bread, not just any bread, but the chef grandmothers recipe, cooking runs in the family because it was delicious. \\n\\nNext the halibut. Cooked to perfection, went great with the un oaked Chardonnay I chose, and I definitely wanted to drink the sauce. \\n\\nNext... the aged beef... literally gave me goosebumps. They did not ask for a temp, but at this point I knew that I did not know what was best for me and they would make all of my culinary decisions moving forward, it was perfect. So tender, so flavorful, I almost fought my BF for the last bite.\\n\\nDessert- lots of white chocolate with strawberries and strawberry sorbet, Ok I was 4 drinks in and don't remember the details, I of course took a picture. It was delicious. \\n\\nMy BF and I shared everything and it was the perfect amount of food. All of the portions look small at first, but the server helped us order and made sure we were taken care of the entire experience. We felt comfortable asking questions, no one was condescending when we asked about ingredients, and we truly enjoyed every bite. \\n\\nOverall, this is the best food, most unpretentious environment, and coolest atmosphere I have ever eaten.

They covered the rest of the fish with vegetables and toppings, but the eyes and the mouth showed that it was a frozen fish. No frozen fish is worth $35, and they could easily get a fresh fish as Richmond is so close to the Pacific. We sent the fish back and were offered the waitress' profuse apologizes. The second time most of the toppings had been wiped off the fish and it appeared as if the cook had prodded the fish every few inches to check if it was cooked. When I tasted the fish and its toppings, it was as if the cook spill the salt shaker over the fish and didn't bother to wipe any salt off. We called the waitress over again and insisted that we couldn't possibly eat something like this. She looked at us in shock then proceded to ask us where we were from and if our taste might not be suitable for the restaurant's dishes (It's a \\"Beijing-style\\" restaurant, my family is from Beijing...). We then asked if we could return the fish. She initially refused to but relented when we asked her to call her manager over and have him/her taste the fish. After returning the fish we ordered some smaller dishes. Two out of the four were pretty good, but one was again extremely salty (my father has high BP and is on a low-sodium diet) and the other wasn't that good. We were hoping to stop by a good Chinese restaurant during our visit to the Vancouver area and were immensely disappointed by Point Zero.

The first time, we did take out and the food was okay. I had the wonton soup and a sushi roll (I think it was the spicy tuna). Nothing spectacular but not terrible.\\n\\nThe second time my boyfriend and I decided to dine in. We arrived there at 9pm on a Friday and thought we had plenty of time because they are open until midnight and there were other customers. We sat down and were given our menus (which are very long). No more than 2 minutes later the waitress asked us if we were ready to order. I politely asked for another minute because we needed more time to get through their long menu. She walked away and returned 1 minute later. We were still not ready. She must have came to our table 5 times in less than 10 minutes asking us for our order.\\n\\nWe ordered our food. Once the waitress gave us our food, she returned before we could even take a bite and gave us our check and said that she needed to go home but take our time. We said okay and continued with our meal. She returned 2 minutes later and said we needed to pay now because she had to go home. I have barely even gotten into my meal and you want me to pay?! I said we would take care of it after the meal. She INSISTED that we pay her now. Annoyed, my boyfriend threw down his card. She ran the card and returned with the receipt. We thought it was all set so we continued with our meal. She returns 2 minutes later and says we need to sign the receipt so she can go home. Frustrated, I told her we would sign it when we were done and give it to the bartender. She said no, she needed us to sign before she went home. We signed and left her a modest tip even though the service was terrible. Mind you this all took place in a matter of 20 minutes.\\n\\nAs for the food, the spicy pork was extremely salty! After one bite, we felt like we needed to chug a full glass of water. We didn't finish it. The beef and vegetable wasn't bad. Their mai tais were pretty good but we didn't even get to enjoy it as after all that we just wanted to hurry and get out of there.

Seeing as how I was using my computer at the time, I decided that I needed to get something that would enable me to continue working without making a mess. Naturally, I decided on wings, because that's just the way my brain works.\\n\\nI was aware of the new Sarpino's down the road, due to the fact that they drop a door hanger off at least once a month, so I decided to give them a shot. Seeing as how my psyche is at least 25% candyass, I went with the barbeque wings instead of the buffalo, because spicy foods and me do not always get along. 45 minutes later, my wings were delivered unto me, along with a requisite bottle of root beer. The wings actually came in 2 separate foil wrappings, which I didn't understand until I opened them up. What I had were 2 very different looking types of wings. The first were definitely barbeque wings, but the second had all of the properties stereotypically found with buffalo wings. Suffice it to say, I was not pleased. I realize that people make mistakes, but getting my order wrong is generally a 1 way ticket to Onestarville (Population: Super China).\\n\\nAt this point, the restaurant was closed and I was hungry, so I ventured into the uncharted buffalo flavored waters. That's when I discovered that Sarpino's buffalo wings are actually really good. They're not too spicy, which I like, but are still both flavorful. They were not as good as the barbeque wings that filled the first half of my order, but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.\\n\\nAnd so here I sit, a man conflicted. While Sarpino's didn't bring me what I ordered, the food they did bring me was enjoyable. While I can't give them a 4 or 5 star rating because of that, I would order from them again... if only to see what they bring me next.\\n\\nSHORT VERSION:\\n\\nCons: They didn't bring me what I ordered.\\nPros: It was still pretty good."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I attended an event here while I was in town for work.

Steven, the employee, condescendingly smirked and offered to refund her money. The woman explained that she was not concerned about the money, just that she frequents this place and was disappointed with how long it took to prepare her food. The employee began arguing with her, and appeared more interested in trying to prove his point than in trying to satisfy the customer. I was astonished and disappointed with the employee's behavior toward the customer. When my friend chimed in to try to diffuse the situation, the employee became even more argumentative toward the woman, my friend, and myself. We asked to split our check between my friend and I, which the employee failed to do. When we asked him about this, he stated that we never asked him to do so.

I think Yassir is a great guy and I love the old Soundbites.  I also think Omar is a great chef, and that the food at Ball Square Cafe is even better than it was at Sound Bites - primarily because there are new items on the menu.  Obviously, since the old Soundbites and Ball Sq have almost identical menus created and cooked by the same chef - Omar - there really isn't that much of a difference there.  But Omar has added some extra items - like the caramelized apple cinnamon waffle which really is not a waffle, but more like a light airy souffle drenched in hot caramel sauce and fresh apples.  I am drooling just thinking about it.\\n\\nI don't know the dirt on why SoundBites moved and frankly would love to hear the details.  From the face of it, it sounds like the landlord wanted to raise soundbites' rent since they saw what great brunch business they did.  Yassir refused, moved next door, and so the landlord opened a restaurant in soundbites' place with the identical menu and soundbites' chef as his partner.  Slimy in some respects.  In other respects, I think it is only fair that great chefs own at least part of the restaurants they work at, whose reputations are built on their skills. \\n\\nSo there you go.  I guess I will frequent Ball Square Cafe since I liked the vibe of the Old Soundbites a lot more than the new one which has a giant bar in the middle of it.

We came back to see the deserts, a chocolate moose filled pasty and a cheesecake like thing. They were both good, but not wanting to be impolite we ate a few bites and i rushed us out with 40 minutes to spare before the boat docked.\\n   When we came back 20 minutes later, the food was gone. they had already cleared the tables, perhaps thinking the few bites we took was all we wanted. I had fun celebrating my friends birthday, but for that price tag for two people I would have rather packed my own dinner of sun chips and brie and rented out a dinghy for an hour. Don't take this cruise if you want to eat. take it if you want to get hammered on a fancy boat and listen to covers.\\n   The only enduring parts of the evening were the streamers they gave us with our water which we put in our birthday girls hair, making her look like George Clinton and the Popsicle they gave us as we exited the boat. OK guys you could have done even worse, but I rate the food portion of this dining cruise a 3/10."},{"name":"B.J. Willys Woodfired Pizza & Pub","address":"Progress Ridge Townsquare, 12345 SW Horizon Blvd, Ste 61","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"With a name like B.J. Willys, I was a bit hesitant to go in. I expected this place to \\"blow\\". The name itself is screaming to be made fun of-so how good could this place really be? Not to mention it is located smack dab in the middle of yuppy \\"family-land\\". Fortunately, (for this review), I just had a baby and needed a place to go on one of the hottest days yet this year that I could have a beer and sit outside with my fiance and little one. They have prime outdoor seating for people with kids. Let me emphasize this point. People WITH KIDS. If you do not have kids, I hope you are tolerant because there is a marvelous fountain 10 feet away for kids to play in. It gets busy, and if you are sitting in the outdoor section, kids will be running by you throughout your meal. I thought it was great. Pre-kid, I would have been a bit annoyed.\\n\\nOk, enough about the name and outdoor seating. No drink menus, so the poor waitress had to list all 15 or so beers offered, and by the time she was through wit her list, I forgot most of what she had told me so I settled for a wonderfully strong Long Island (GREAT if you don't have/don't like kids and are sitting outside). We waited a bit too long for our appetizer (Garlic Cheese Bread). It was cheesy, but not that garlicy. The cheese was a bit \\"rubbery\\" but I am thinking that might have been because it was woodfired? I am not an expert on woodfired food yet. I'd probably order that again, but not after I tried all the other sides first. Then our pizza came out. We got the 10\\" Italian. The ham was burned to a crisp on the edges, possibly another woodfired effect? I would have preferred it not burnt, but it was good none-the-less! \\n\\nThe staff seemed a bit \\"douchy\\" (I'm talking about the men). One was even singing some sort of R&B love song that I am hoping he thought no one would hear. He had a good voice though, just not the right time and place for love songs. I have to give him credit though, he was good looking, had a great voice, but was totally awkward with his customers! He tried way too hard and seemed like he was almost flirting with the female at the table (who was most certainly with her husband). I did like our waitress though-she thought our baby boy was adorable, so she got a good tip.\\n\\nPrice was way too high. Our 10\\" slightly-burnt pizza was $15.99!! \\n\\nOK, so forget all my sarcastically honest humor, this place was good and I'm going back. I forgot to ask if they have a full bar and if what kind of shots they make. Maybe next time I'll get a BJ for old time's sake and take it with no hands from between my fiance's knees!"},{"name":"Stella Public House","address":"1905 Aldrich St, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My new favorite spot in Austin.

This is the first time that I've had kare kare so I don't know what it should be like, but I did really enjoy the peanut sauce/broth, which was savoury and had a great fragrance from the peanut.

They have a good assortment of dishes, and a dosai (Indian crepe) comes w/ your buffet meal. Cost is $8.99 for buffet during the week. It costs a little more for weekends.

We arrived early to a fairly empty restaurant, but that was remedied in a few hours as their dinner crowd started coming in.  I love the fact that it's next door to one of our favorite bars so after a few beers we thought it would be a nice place for dinner.  Dai Due has a wonderful open kitchen area, where you get to see all the chef's/cooks are being very busy preparing meals and order for the butcher shop.  I watched as a gentlemen came in to pick up his young suckling pig, which was being wrapped in butcher paper and getting ready for it's last performance.  Hostess guided us over to a booth, but in the end we wanted to sit at the bar... as usual.  There I spied a bearded Clinton.. the first bartender who turned me on to Prosecco at Enoteca, poured me amazing drinks at Fino and now he finds himself at Dai Due.  He immediately suggested some white wine which comes out of a tap.  A Duchman Vermentino, it was very nice, cold and crisp.  Another tip of the hat to Clinton, who knows his stuff.\\n\\nI ponied up and ordered the cold meat board to start.  It was chock full of meaty goodness; Chicken Liver Mousse, Venison Ham, Bierwurst, Venison Rillette, and Summer Sausage with Pickled Figs, Sour Cucumber, Sprouted Rye and Smoked Chile Mustard.  I will have to admit, Henri's next to Barley Swine took the cake when it came to cheese and meat boards, but for $16 this was clearly plenty for three of us.  After consulting with Clinton, we thought the supper club idea for us three would do the trick.  He mentioned it's a pretty large serving and since we had already munched through the meat plate, his suggestion was taken to get it for two.  That was an excellent suggestion.  A really greatly appreciated suggestion, since if we would of gotten three specials we would left most of it behind.  The Sunday special was: Fried  1/2 Dewberry Hills Farm Chicken with Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans, Bread and Butter Jalape√±os and a Biscuit.  It was delicious.  Top notch and very filling.  The deserts were very tasty, which is pretty important since having Sugar Mama's next door is some hefty competition.\\n\\nDai Due will be quickly loved by their neighbors and us in particular, we definitely be back soon."},{"name":"Madras Pavilion","address":"9025 Research Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to my first ever Vegan Night which is held once a month at this place.

So we were left on our own to serve ourselves dishes that were so hot as to be inedible.  Many of the things I got I could not even eat and so it ended up as wasted food.

We kept waiting for a check but never got one so we finally went to the cash register where, once again, there was no one to take our money.

Our entrees arrived on very, very tiny plates. I had 5 bland, deep-fried chicken balls on my plate with some lettuce for garnish on the side and some weak sauce pooled at the bottom, just barely. They had no flavor. The last piece I spit out. It's sad to say I would have preferred ammonia'd fake crappy McNuggets to that. My boyfriend's steak (which I did try) had a faint flavor and was mediocre at best. He told me Kirin beer was also nothing to write home about.\\n\\nWe were excited to go here and had good expectations. Being big fans of Japanese cuisine, this place made our stomachs sad.

So, it's some of the best food and some of the best drinks, every time, in a relaxed but elegant setting.  \\n\\nI do have to be in the mood to eat here, though.  The menu is not long and typically has a strong emphasis on vegetables.  Combine this with an aesthetic that can sometimes be taken to a zen-like level, this means that if unlucky, I could see not a single dish that sounds exciting on the menu.  Of course pristine raw oysters, burrata, sea scallop, good bread, etc. are always going to taste great.  But more naughty and recipe-centric dishes like the ESS fried bologna sandwich, or dishes defined by a richness of taste like a gumbo or shrimp and grits, are kind of hard to come by.  So, I have to be in the mood to submit myself to the aesthetic to eat here.  It helps that the drinks are now so stellar, I can just drink at the bar and get a couple small plates instead of actually having dinner.  \\n\\nSo, try Cakes & Ale but with the proper expectation.

I had to post thanks to two amazing visits in the past month. Yeah, updates can be boring and usually in the realm of this place was great and then it dive bombed. Not the case here my Yelp kin, it got WAY better. And, its in Oak Hill! How often counting back to the seventies do I get to sing the praises for an restaurant out in my hood. \\n\\nMy mom is always looking for an exciting place to take her staff when they finish yearly business transactions. I consulted with her, checked reviews and old favorites, then offered up JAK as a suitable contender. This place is decidedly a country bumpkin paradise, featuring pimento cheese as a teaser with a category on the menu that embraces chicken fried anything. I tend to lean toward innovative fine dining; but this place has me rethinking my taste buds. \\n\\nFirst visit I had the chicken fried beef rib. I sent pictures of the dish to the in-laws and the father in law threw a fit about living in Colorado. Apparently they have no viable options when it comes to country dining. The rib was tender and when you hit a bit of fat it was divine. Sides were good, every diner enjoyed their selections thru the dessert round. \\n\\nThe wife and I visited next thanks to some shady spots for parking on the west side of the lot. We chose the blue crab gratin and the guacamole with toasted pumpkin seeds as our starters. Good flavors on the gratin along with the toasted bread, could have used a bit of herbs to balance the dish. Our second round on the guacamole was a recap on why this place is great. Fresh and vibrant flavors with fried chips to make it a spectacular addition to the menu. \\n\\nWe chose burgers as our entrees of choice, they were huge. Dubbed the \\"killer cheeseburger\\" and its \\"green chili\\" cousin;  1/2 lb of meat and a bun made in Kyle just down the road. You get a choice of fries and I recommend a split decision. The end of the story is we walked out barely under our own power and yearned for a nap. The boy ate more fries off our plate than his own; a good result for his little tummy. \\n\\nSo I have to tally that JAK totally rocked for a business lunch and a nice family outing. JAK seems to have hit its stride with a busy lunch crowd and another packed parking lot every evening.

I had full intention to go back to the Lustre Pearl and eat from the Bomb Taco trailer out back, no disrespect to that trailer but our evening definitely upgraded.\\n\\nWe walked in and there were a few people crowded in the foyer/seating area so I quietly grabbed a beer and food menu and waited for them to sort out the parties in front of us.  (more on this in a moment).\\n\\nAfter looking over the food menu we decided we should give it a shot as many of the options sounded good and the prices were reasonable.  \\n\\nKnowing that the place had just opened I watched how the waitstaff moved around and how the bar and kitchen staff processed orders.  All while enjoying the first of a few beers.  Although looking back on it I wish I had ordered one of the beer flights to be a bit more adventurous but I will be back sooner than later.\\n\\nThe staff here is knowledgeable  and super friendly.  I spoke with the floor manager and the owner numerous times and learned quite a bit about their business.  Chris, the owner, is a super nice guy who spent 20 minutes talking to me and my girlfriend about the business  and food.  Which occurred because I had asked about the free tattoo section of the menu.  What can I say I am a sucker for a free tattoo.  But anyways I learned about becoming a beer cicerone (which is like a wine smellier for beer) .  To keep it somewhat concise I will just say that they are doing it the right way.  \\n\\nNow onto the food:  Got the basic banger because it was made in-house and I wanted to get a true feel for their kitchen.  I had them put it on a pumpernickel wheat bun covered with onions, spicy sauerkraut, pepper ketchup, and spicy mustard.  All of these items were made by hand in house.  The lady got a very similar order but on the Kolache bun.  Quite frankly the sausage was so good I could have eaten it without the toppings or bun and been quite satisfied.  The toppings were a bonus.  We also had a fried pickle appetizer which was good and I love that they used fermented pickles as they remained crisp and flavorful, if I had to do it again I would probably order them not fried.  This is not a knock on the batter or anything just the pickles stood well on their own.\\n\\nBeer:  1 light beer on the entire menu and that was Shiner Light Blonde, hey if you gotta have one at least its a Texas beer.  The beer menu is quite intimidating but well organized.  You never feel overwhelmed and each gives you a good rundown of pertinent information.  As I stated earlier I  learned about being a beer cicerone and apparently all of their bar staff is or is in the process of becoming a beer cicerone.  This can come in very handy as it is essentially the end all be all of beer knowledge so if you are not sure what you want put your trust in the bar staff and know that this is not somebody who will steer you a rye.  Had I known about this prior I would have gotten beer recommended by them instead of trying to choose my own.  \\n\\nFree tattoo: So if you are willing to get their logo as a tattoo they will pay for it.  They have an agreement with multiple shops who they call up and make the appointment and payment and you just go get the tattoo.  I could have done it right after my meal.  All they ask is that you comeback so they can take a picture of it.  I am not ashamed to say I am considering it, as I said I am a sucker for a free tattoo.\\n\\nNow I feel like I have made it very clear that I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Bangers but I will lay out my one complaint.  The hostess/seating situation.  I watched 3 different people work the hostess stand and each one had a different system.  Also each one had to talk to multiple people to clarify how to seat people.  Also they use your phone number to call you if you are not sitting close by, which isn't bad but seems a bit intrusive.  It seemed weird that the hostesses were the most confused by what was going on when the rest of the place ran like a well oiled machine.  Maybe they should move to an electronic seating system or something more uniform than a pen and pad system.\\n\\nSide note: Seating inside is family style.  Patio is quite large and well spaced out."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I went here twice this week, it was that good.

There is a bus stop (for the 77) literally right in front and there are streetcar stops a block (11th and couch) or two (11th and glisan) away, which is very handy indeed.\\n\\nThis is a large verging on gigantic space which will in all probability be just jam packed when you arrive, no matter what time of day you come. There is always room at the bar of course, and couples won't wait any too long. If you are looking to seat a party of five or more you might want to call ahead.\\n\\nWhile you can get the same beer that deshutes distributes everywhere-mirror pond ale, black butte porter, wheat, ipa, and whatever else they have in the regular national lineup you totally should consider the limited releases instead. They have some big beers rotating in and out. It's subject to change but should you feel experimental they have sours, imperials, ryes, dunkels or saisons that is totally the way to go. Interesting high quality high craft beer that you can't necessarily get anywhere else. \\n\\nIn addition to super awesome beer, the food is spectacular as well. This ins't just a great beer spot as the restaurant more then holds it's own. Solid salads, artisanal appetizers (pork belly confit, local cheeses, ponzu beer nuts etc),  and fantastic heavy entrees along with great sandwich plates round out a better then average menu. It's not the most cost effective place it's true-a couple of beers and  meal will get you into the fifty dollar range-but it is good.\\n\\nService is solid. We had no real waits for anything and our waitress (on the day we took a table) cruised by five times during our meal just to check in. \\n\\nI feel as though i should mention the dining area is gorgeous as well. Very much a semi refined feel, with lots of light wood touches. \\n\\nOnly the ever present crowds and the fact that in my opinion the standard beer line up is just average keep this from a five star rating."},{"name":"Tap Tap Station Cafe","address":"3 Carter St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4.5","text":"I had their signature dish the tap tap and it was delicious."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My brothers and I visited Atlanta in September.

We went with take-out.\\nThough the place didn't look too bad inside. It was rather pleasant and generic, as most oriental food establishments go for. I won't go into fuller detail, out of respect, and since I wasn't in the place for longer than 15 minutes.\\n\\nLike most Thai/Vietnamese restaurants, most of the menu is not based on what specific dish you order, but the meat you choose and the style you want it prepared. Personally, I love this convenient little idea, and it's slowly gaining more popularity.\\n\\nI went with their red curry, with tofu. Not because I'm vegetarian, by any means, I just wanted to focus more on the sauce than the meat with this one. Which turned out to be a great idea: A speckled, lush curry, made from coconut milk and smothering every bit of rice in the box. Even the tofu soaked up some of the sweet, spicy goodness.\\nWhereas my partner in crime, who had never eaten Thai before, got every newbie's usual favorite dish: Pad Thai chicken. Which looked as good as one can hope for, and there definitely was not a complaint to be sputtered from anybody.\\n\\nThough I think my lovely dining experience would of been better if I was indoors, eating outside and gazing at nighttime Boston was a treat in its own right.\\n\\nSo I gave it a 3, and a MAYBE 4, depending on how nice it might had been inside.

Lucky for me (unlucky for the waistline) the LA based mini-chain Spitz recently opened on Killingsworth, a short 15 minute stroll from my house.\\n\\nSpitz specializes in doner kebabs: strips of juicy meat layered with assorted veggies, cheese, and sauce then swaddled in a pita. Vegan and vegetarian options are also available. Doners aren't that common in Portland (yet) so I was excited to see a new offering on the food scene.\\n\\nLocated on North Killingsworth in the old New American space, I really loved Spitz's branding presence and consistency. You get the same vibrant, hip feel from their website as from the restaurant. Colorful umbrellas dot the patio. Contemporary art is splashed along the walls. Old album covers paper the restroom walls. Fresh-faced staff are poised to take your order at the counter. Pints of craft beers and sangria are tipped back by happy, satiated customers.\\n\\nBut I have to tell you about the street cart fries. Oh. My. Deliciousness. Perfectly crispy fries are smothered with layers of garlic aioli, feta cheese, red onion, green pepper, tomato, olives, and spicy pepperoncinis. I literally could not stop eating them, they were pure foodie bliss.\\n\\nOf course we had to try the doners too. I mean, that was the real reason for coming. (But I'm still dreaming about those street cart fries!)\\n\\nThe boyfriend ordered Spitz's self-proclaimed most popular wrap, the Street Cart Doner. Pieces of beef and lamb are tucked into a pita with garlic aioli, fried lavash chips, romaine, cabbage, tomato, onion, green pepper, cucumber, and tzatziki. For an additional $4.75 you can make it a combo with fries and a fountain drink.\\n\\nFor myself, I ordered the Doner with Pommes which is meat with your choice of fries (thin cut or sweet potato waffle fries), garlic aioli, lavash chips, romaine, cabbage, tomato, onion, green pepper, cucumber, and tzatziki. The fries made for a nice soft center with layers of crunchy veggies and hearty meat surrounding it. I ordered beef and lamb on mine, although chicken, mixed meat, and falafel are available as well.\\n\\nThe meat was well prepared in thin slices. The layer of veggies added nice crunch and the combination of aioli and tzatziki lended a good punch of flavor. I especially liked that the doner was wrapped tightly, making it very easy to eat without falling apart.\\n\\nBut those street cart fries! I'm telling you, you gotta try them. Since they're just a 15 minute walk from me, I definitely will be ordering them again.\\n\\nTip: For $3 more turn your street cart fries into a meal by adding the meat of your choice and some zesty feta."},{"name":"Chi'Lantro","address":"11005 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The best food and customer service I have had in a long time.

For instance at the old location all the people knew everybody and smiled. Not so much at the new one its more like just eat,drink,give us your money and go! Maybe that is because they are a sports bar not family themed. The food is about equal as the old location(nothing stellar), they just need to add all the extra items to the menu for those who don't know(because that's what we get). The arcade is a joke.

The food seemed like it was going to be impressive from the descriptions on the menu. I had the meatballs, bulgogi bahn mi, and five spice fish. The meatballs came out and looked like grey ping pong balls. The texture of these things I can't even describe. It had the consistency of a vienna sausage but worse if that makes any sense. I moved on to the Roti which was actually pretty good. A bit over priced though for only one piece of bread. I had previously been excited about the five spice fish until it reached the table. The fish got to the table hot but looked like a fresh fried light brown fish stick. I think it might have been better but I honestly didn't taste any of the five spices they were claimed to have been tossed in. The bahn mi was served on a very nice piece of bread. I think the sandwich would have been better if the ingredients had been proportioned better. I never got a consistent bite of the sandwich. Either all meat or all salad.

Having just finished moving into the area, and not familiar with area, we were running a bit behind. I called at 7pm and asked if they were open and until when, saying we were having a late start to our night. The young man said, they were open and until 10pm. I was excited and thanked him and said, \\"We hope to be there by 830-845pm for just a cocktail and appitezer\\". \\n\\nWe arrived and were told by the same young man, and the two young woman up front (high school kids), all talking over each other, let us know they were closing at 10pm and we could not be seated. \\n\\nIt was 8:55 pm.\\n\\nI asked if they were open until 10 and she said, \\"Yes\\". We stared at each other for a few moments, and then the guy stepped in and said, \\"Yeah, we're closing early today.\\" Dumbfounded. I said I had just called him 90 mins prior and asked him if they were opened for drinks and app's and that he said, yes, they were open until 10pm. He blinked. He shrugged and turned around to keep wiping down the menus. No, I'm sorry. No, I made a mistake. Nothing. Literally turned his back on us.\\n\\nDue to the time and still wanting to make something for mom's day, we left without asking to speak to the manager or be \\"those customers'' and demand to be seated 60 minutes before closing.  But I have to tell you, it was disappointing and embarrsing in front of my family and to our industry. \\n\\nAs a degreed graduate of culinary school and culinary business mgmt, when stuff like this happens I am floored. Sure, we don't like when people show up close to closing, but it happens. We love people, we feed them. That's what our industry does. We serve the last person until the last minute of our hours posted. Just like most resturants do. If they stop serving at 9pm, it should be listed. If they decided to close early, it should have been posted OUTSIDE before bringing my party indoors to just be turned away. \\n\\nEither way, we were not served, no one apolgized for the mistake and there was no type of compensation offered. Awful customer service and these kids playing hostess have no idea how to represent, what I've been told by clients as, a classy establishment.

Each cart usually sell one items that they are good with. The prawn mee is the best dish and they are closer to my mom cooking. The process to produce the broth is very difficult. The broth is actually broil a lot of shrimp head and yellow ginger and chili. This usually require a lot of shrimp. Once the broth is almost complete, the shrimp meat is to broil with the soup. The shrimp need to fillet to two half to allow the broth to marinate the meat. It serve with fried onion and vege. This dish is actually an Nyonya dish who is the mix marriage of Chinese and Malay descendant cusine. \\n\\nThe chicken satay is close to the Malay people cusine. It need to be sweeter but the flavor is there. The Hokkein Mee is actually an immigrants of Chinese from Hokkein region of china to Malaysia dish. This dish is predominately in sweet soy source. A good Hokkein Mee need to be not watery source. It should be in drier source. The roti canai is actually an Malaysian Indian dish. The roti of this dish are not quite to the required paper thin bread. However , the curry is good. Some prefer watery curry than liquid curry.

Anyway, here we go: \\n\\nWe arrived and it was very uncrowded as we went on a random Monday evening when there were no Boston games played at all, so we sat right away. The service was on point; the host greeted us right away, and the waitress was courteous. She accommodated my request to put the Pittsburgh vs Washington hockey game on, even though she seemed surprised (put off even) that I wanted a hockey game on that didn't star the Bruins. It was almost like she couldn't believe that someone just watched hockey unless it was for the home team, but that was just funny and didn't take away from the experience. In fact, we had a laugh about it as she changed the channel. The busboy was also right there when he was needed, so all-in-all, the staff gets an A... A-. \\n\\nHowever! \\n\\nFirst things first, and I don't know why this ALWAYS seems to happen when I order one of these, but they were out of Magners Cider. I don't know what the deal is with restaurants and restocking their Magners, but everyone seems to be fresh out just as soon as I order one. My girlfriend ordered a diet Coke, and it was flat. So, right from the start, I was feeling down. \\n\\nThen we ordered the appetizers. I got the beef and lamb chili, which was good. It wasn't great, it was just average. My girlfriend got the blue cheese potato patties (I don't know if that's the technical name for them), and they were very bland. My girlfriend had a stuffy nose and couldn't taste any of them, but she wasn't missing much, because they weren't very flavorful anyway. \\n\\nFor our meals, I ordered the (it sickens me to even remember them) Battered Sausage Supper. Now, I guess I'm partly to blame for this one, because for some reason I over-looked the \\"Battered\\" part and was quite surprised when I literally got deep-fried, beer-battered sausages. Sure, I was taken aback, but before I dug in, I thought, \\"This could actually end up being the best food mistake of my life. I like beer-batteredness and I like sausages, so why not combine the two and make a heavenly meal unlike any other!?!?\\" The only problem was that they were the worst food I've ever tasted and I've eaten broccoli and asparagus. I managed to gag one down because I paid for it and I'm never one to send food back, but after every bite I had to chase it with a fist full of french fries, which they call \\"chips\\" (oooooo, classy!). \\n\\nMy girl ordered the baby spinach leaf, blue cheese, and chicken salad, but without the red peppers in it. Now, I don't eat spinach, so I can only go by what she said, and she gave it a thumbs down. She was upset by the fact that the salad doesn't come with dressing on it (besides the blue cheese), and after drizzling lemon juice on it, she was still unimpressed and said, \\"I'm not going to be in a rush to get back here.\\" \\n\\nAnd I agree. While the service was good (I just expect that kind of service at any restaurant though) and prices were reasonable, we didn't really enjoy anything we ate exceptionally.

To put things simply though, HK Too is not Barefoot Bobs.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nFirst off I went there during opening weekend.  The wait was pretty long (which is completely understandable), it was a nice day and it was opening weekend, however as I waited there I could not help to notice that at least half the tables were empty and never completely filled during the entire wait.  This should be addressed.\\n\\nSecond, the drink menu.  This is where the difference between Bobs and HK  Too is apparent, the drinks are very small and are weak, not to mention more expensive than the drinks at Bobs.  If you were to frequent Bob's there for the Tropical drinks, there is no need to stop by at HK Too, they are not the same and you will be disappointed.  \\n\\nThird, the menu.  I will state I am not a fan of seafood so I cannot speak to that specifically, but the rest of the menu was pretty shallow.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, nothing special, no reason to wait for an hour plus for it.  There are no burgers here, so if you are trying to get a Margaritaville type of Hamburger in paradise experience, again not your place to go.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\nThe place is cleaner, and the furniture is nicer.  I do like the extra plants they started to add, I think they could even add a little more, good idea.\\n\\nI liked the french fries better.\\n\\nSummary,\\n\\nHK Too is not that special place like the previous establishment, it is the standard below average dining experience you will expect from a hole in the wall at the beach.  I would have friends and family that would make it a trip to drive hours to go to my beach just to get a nice strong drink, and a simple burger, this is no longer the case.  \\n\\nI am writing this not out of malice, it was a real sad day after hoping that the memory of Bobs didn't need to just be a memory.\\n\\nMy advice, Do not skimp on your drinks, expand the menu and drink selection.  I wont argue that you will have people show up to your place during the summer, because they don't know better or choices become limited, but you have and will definitely lose most of your local loyal customers."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"In the Somerville breakfast wars, Ball Square Cafe comes out on top every time.

Though that may be, my family and I have had our fair share of lazy days and, not willing to cook, we would walk a few blocks and come by here to just grab a simple pho, rice or vermicelli dish.\\n\\nThough the pho broth is not the best, it stills hit the spot. I wish that they had more of the garnishes--bean sprouts, herbs, and lime--as they were lacking last time. It is best eaten with these ingredients and you can always adjust how much you want. For me, my usual is the pho tai (flank steak) where I just add the juice of one wedge of lime, some of the herbs + bean sprouts and I am all set!\\n\\nWhen I want a rice dish, all of them are good. Usually they are grilled meats but my favorites are the com thit nuong (grilled beef rice plate) and com ga (chicken rice plate). I would add a side of tau hu ky (fried bean thread with shrimp paste). Accompanied by fresh vegetables (lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers) and pickled carrots and radishes, these are staples in Vietnamese cuisine. \\n\\nVermicelli dishes are also very good but if you are not a big fan of fish sauce, I would recommend you to either stay away or look very carefully at the listed ingredients. Though the smell is very pungent, it is very tasty. It's an acquired taste and I would not recommend it to the faintest of hearts.\\n\\nI never tried the desserts, but that's because I usually end up too full. The sinh tos, or smoothies, are very good. I usually prefer the cafe sua dua (Vietnamese iced coffee) which has a strong dense flavor sweetened with condensed milk--yum!\\n\\nOverall, the servings here are fairly large. I can only manage to eat half the meal and pack the rest for a late dinner or for lunch the next day! Moreover, the service here is fine.

It was previously a Japanese restaurant, and not an easy conversion to its new face as a popular Middle Eastern cafe. As others have commented, he has had to try to refurbish it mostly by himself while also continuing to serve food seven days a week at quite convenient hours.\\n\\nHowever, Ali very recently has taken on a partner in the venture who is always there, and now has additional staff on hand. In addition, he is remaking the menu again for a very special new item that's coming soon with the hiring of yet another staff member.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Ali makes his offerings with pride, and can definitely even make you things off the menu to delight you and introduce you to new Middle Eastern cuisine. Though he specializes in falafel, very special grilled chicken and vegetables, delicious baklava and other things, I find it impressive that even the cheeseburger and homemade chips are great. And he even has a delicious fish and rice dish for when I am in the mood for seafood.\\n\\nI eat here about once a week and have always enjoyed my meals here, especially when trying new things.\\n\\n(The only disclaimer I will give is that Ali has become a friend of my wife and me since his first restaurant, near this one. It is specifically because of his food that he has become a friend. Therefore my review is balanced from the perspecitve of a \\"foodie.\\" Ali did not solicit this review and doesn't know I've written it.)"},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Today was the day for my first trip to Hawkers. I was expecting great things, and Hawkers definitely did not disappoint.\\n\\nJust seconds after my friend and I entered, we were greeted and sat at a table at the far end of the restaurant. Our server, Gwen, was very helpful, attentive, polite and knowledgeable about the menu. (And Jeff, you were right about the attractive female employees - Gwen is very pretty!) Gwen answered some questions we had about the menu and even made some recommendations, several of which we took her up on. My friend and I each ordered 4 items and shared much of it: my friend ordered the fried green beans, the duck tacos, the South Asian curry and the roti canai, and I ordered the five-spice tofu, curry mashed potatoes, the Char Kway Teo and the vegetarian spring rolls. I tried a little bit of everything except for the duck, since I've never had duck and am not sure I ever want to. Everything was excellent! I'm definitely going to be making another trip here sometime - soon, hopefully - to try some more menu items.\\n\\nMy friend seemed to enjoy everything she ordered, especially the roti canai. (We even ordered a 2nd one after the first one was gone.) My spring rolls were great, the curry mashed potatoes were equally as great, the Char Kway Teo was even better than I was expecting (and it's a large portion, as I couldn't even finish it) and the tofu also was delicious and unique. I don't know a lot about curry, except for that I like it; the curry here is very good and has the perfect mixture of spices and flavor.\\n\\nOur total came to just short of $40, but for 8 different menu items, an additional roti canai and my friend's soda (I had a water), that's fair. As several reviewers have already pointed out, none, if any, of the menu items have a price of more than $6, and many are less than that. The spring rolls (2 of them in an order), roti canai and mashed potatoes were $3 apiece, the duck tacos were $5, the five-spice tofu is $4 and the green beans were $4.50. So, you can definitely try a little of everything here and not pay a lot for any one given choice.\\n\\nI definitely can recommend everything that we were served (save for the duck, since I didn't try it), especially the roti canai (it's a very light and buttery flatbread - delicious!), the fried green beans, the tofu (which is served cut into tiny cubes and has a spice similar to, if not the same as, that of the green beans) and the Char Kway Teo (I agree with Jeff - this is a must-try!). The service is very friendly, the prices seem fair and the restaurant has a cool atmosphere and design. (Krista P. is right; it's reminiscent of the inside of a Chipotle, though I think Hawkers is much more cool.)\\n\\nI will definitely be back here in the future and hope most Yelpers who are thinking about checking this place out will do so. The restaurant was quiet today, though I hope that's only because it was so nice outside. Hopefully it'll experience continued success and these reviews will attract some business!"},{"name":"Fellini's Pizza","address":"4429 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It's totally Daniel B's fault.

I had the chicken tikka masala and she ordered the chicken palak.  When we ordered our waiter asked us how spicy we wanted our dishes on a scale of 1 - 10.  (I've never been asked to request spice on such a scale ... can't they just have mild, medium, and spicy levels?  I mean, how much different is a 6 going to be from a 7?)  Feeling adventurous I asked for a 9 and my fiancee, who likes a mild chicken palak, ordered a 3.  My chicken tikka masala had a great deal of heat to it, but a disappointing amount of actual spice.  My fiancee's chicken palak was just a bit too spicy for her liking, but she was able to finish about half of it before giving up.  Next time she says she's ordering a spice level of 1.  We also shared an order of regular naan which filled our craving for it, but wasn't amazing.\\n\\nWe'll be back because we still have another groupon to use, but I don't see us visiting this place regularly.

Sweet. However, they still charged us normal price somehow, and when I got my food, there was no scone. I asked, and was told they hadn't made any that day... So I drove 100 blocks for scones, and they didn't have any. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have been told before hand or something. Once I mentioned it, I was offered toast, but that's not the same. \\n\\nOther than that, this place has probably pushed itself high up on my lists of favorite breakfasts, the omelet and potatoes were divine, as was my husband's elk/pork scramble special. I'm not much of a breakfast person, and since it's my husband's favorite, I'm always on the search for somewhere I can enjoy as well, so I can't wait to try the scones. \\n\\nThe bloody mary was good, and they had a little bloody mary bar with celery, pickled beans, olives and onions.

Let's see if I beat the clock or fall asleep before midnight.\\n\\nAs I came back through downtown after getting off work early (and going sock shopping (so glamorous)), I felt like I owed myself a treat and decided on The Original.  I've been intrigued with the restaurant for quite awhile, so what better time than New Year's Eve.\\n\\nThere's so much right here:\\n\\nService: Fast, friendly, frequent, not pretentious yet not intrusive.  I felt comfortable right away and that's due to this bright young group of servers.  My server, Chelsea, anticipated my needs, but I also could ask for help from the other servers if need be and not feel like I was causing them trouble.  They just jumped in and answered my questions.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: Relaxed and friendly.  The booths were spacious and comfortable.  They let me have a whole booth to myself on request and let me choose it.  \\n\\nMusic: Great choices of music that wasn't too loud.  Other diners could carry on conversations comfortably without having to resort to screaming or having their heads explode due to volume extremes.  Some even sang along out loud and that just made things more comfy.  \\n\\nCleanliness: Very clean.  Didn't use the restroom, but seems like they probably would be clean like the restaurant itself.\\n\\nDecor: Coffee shop meets club?  One half of The Original is diner decor and the other half is contemporary cool club decor.  It works pretty well and doesn't take away from the feeling of coziness in the diner area or cool factor of the club.  \\n\\nMenu: Eclectic diner.  Breakfast for dinner, burgers, shakes, etc.  Lots of tasty-looking dishes to be had.  I settled on biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and hash browns just because it was a little bit of a celebration after getting off work and heading home sweet home afterward.  Their cocktail menu looked intriguing.  Portions were perfect, not leaving me feel like I could explode, just comfortably full.\\n\\nWhat Could Be Better:\\n\\nFood: My scrambled eggs were light, that's true, but they were also still runny.  Should have asked for them to be well done, but that's just me.  My hash browns and biscuits and gravy were not adequately seasoned and on the bland side.  The biscuits were not as light as they could be (they need my mom's biscuit recipe and her light touch) and it was hard to cut through them with a fork and were also a tad too crispy and almost verging on burnt.  The hash browns were good enough that I would have liked more.  The organic ketchup by Portland Ketchup Company (which I wasn't sure I would like) turned out to be one of the best parts of the meal.  The food didn't stay hot for very long either.  I had Earl Grey Tea and was given plenty of honey and lemons to \\"season\\" the tea with.  I originally wasn't going to have dessert, but when I checked in via Yelp on my phone, a coupon for a free piece of pie popped up and The Original honored the coupon, so of course I had to have the pie (dutch apple).  It was tasty, but the pie crust hadn't been mixed well (big patches of salty crust interspersed with big patches of overly sweet crust).  It was also tough and hard to cut through with  my fork (had been handled too much during the mixing of the dough).  The filling was not seasoned enough with sugar and other spices.  The dish as a whole was not heated correctly so half was cold and the other blazing hot; yikes.  A for effort, C+ to D for outcome.\\n\\nLike I said, there's so much right here at The Original, and I would definitely like to come back and have a burger (saw the burger and fries going past to other patrons and looked very good) to give them another chance.  The biggest draws are the service, decor, cleanliness, and other atmospheric things.  Someone needs to pay greater attention to the smaller details of actual food prep and getting that spot on (making sure things are heated all the way through, etc.).  I think this is definitely a restaurant that can do it because they're smart and care about what they're doing.  \\n\\nI almost wrote a book, and I hear fireworks going off all over my neighborhood, so Father Time is going to be changing the clock over to the New year sooner than not.  My best wishes to everyone everywhere for a great New Year, especially at The Original.

The decor is nice but definitely kitschy North Carolina with lots of unfinished pine wood, upside down lamps for lights, and deer heads around the walls. A far away big city interpretation for sure. Lol Service is attentive and friendly. \\n\\nFor main courses we have had the following  the frittata, mushroom omelette, and chicken and waffles.\\n\\nThe frittata is very good as is the mushroom omelette. The ingredients go well together in both dishes and both entrees contain large portion sizes. The fried green tomatoes on top of the frittata were a nice touch and very tasty. Also, the red hot sauce on the table is quite good and goes well on the mushroom omelette and frittata.\\n\\nThe chicken and waffles are quite good overall. We have lived in Dallas and Atlanta and found the fried chicken to be very comparable to great places in both of these cities. The waffles are good but not great. They are on the softer / mushier side compared to good places in Atlanta or Dallas. We prefer them more airy and crispy. I believe the waffles are corn meal based here vs a traditional southern waffle batter. That might be what makes them a different style. \\n\\nFor starters we have had the bread basket and popovers with pimento cheese and red pepper jam. \\n\\nThe bread basket is both good and bad. The pastries: pop overs, biscuit, and chocolate croissant are all of very high quality. The unfortunate miss is that they don't serve the basket with any good jams/jelly. It is served with a marginal apple butter spread that is not nearly flavorful enough for the fantastic crumbly biscuit or the other items. This really detracts from the basket. It is strange that a southern themed restaurant does not offer a side of quality berry jams, preserves, or compote for the pastries. Adding this would greatly enhance the basket.\\n\\nThe popovers with pimento cheese and pepper jam are quite good. The pimento cheese mixed with the red pepper jam has fantastic flavor. I highly recommend this starter if you like pimento cheese\\n\\nIt has its flaws. However, we would recommend this place if you are visiting or live in Boston and are looking for a solid southern brunch option."},{"name":"Casa Mia Cucina Italiana","address":"261 Washington St","city":"Marblehead","stars":"4.5","text":"I have tried many restaurants in Marblehead and by far this is my favorite place.

And the fish is incredibly fresh--I happen to know that the chef/owner was not satisfied with the quality of fish he could get from other sources locally, so he now has some of it flown in from Japan (from Tsukiji Market, where they have the bluefin tuna auctions). This is seriously not only some of the best sushi you'll find in the Columbus area, but possibly in the Midwest or even the US. It's as good as much of the sushi I've had in Japan. \\n\\nThe servers are extremely friendly and nice, and they do everything in their power to keep customers happy. Everything is prepared fresh, and there may be cases where things take longer or even slip through the cracks in the kitchen. But that is highly unusual. One thing to keep in mind: In Japan, servers generally leave you alone during the meal, and you have to call out \\"sumimasen\\" (Excuse me) to get their attention. The servers at Yoshi's have to balance perhaps giving less attention to their Japanese customers, who aren't used to servers fluttering around the table, and the American customers, who expect it. If you can't get someone's attention, you might try raising your hand and politely saying \\"Excuse me.\\" They really want to help. Everything about this place is authentic, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"name":"Pad Thai Cafe","address":"1116 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in Boston and has wonderful Pad Thai. Tried the Pad Thai and many of the items on the menu. The pork items are all pretty tasty and they also had thousand year old egg that was fried and came with fried basil leaves and ground pork. They can adjust the level of spiciness for you. It is mostly a self service type place so you don't need to overdo it with the tip.

He wanted to go to one with a buffet but that particular one only offers it on Wednesday nights and it was a Friday, so he consulted Yelp and the highest rated restaurant in our area was this one, so off we went.\\n\\nI have to tell you, I've never eaten Indian food before.  I've heard they use a lot of spices, especially curry, so I was looking forward to a good meal.  What I got was completely different from what I expected.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is kind of dark and gloomy and a bit outdated.  We were 'greeted' or should I say stared at, by a host who definitely did not want to there.  He mumbled something about having to wait then shuffled off to the back of the restaurant.\\n\\nAfter someone cleaned up a table, we were seated.  I ordered a sweet lassi to drink, which is basically a yogurt smoothie.  It tasted exactly like one of those drinkable yogurts you get in the supermarket, which I'm pretty sure it was.\\n\\nI ordered the Papri Chaat for an appetizer.  It sounded good on the menu but it was really odd.  Basically, it was bean dip, but instead of beans, they put in puffy cereal.  Probably one of the weirdest things I ever eaten, that's for sure.  I'm not certain if I liked it or not.\\n\\nFor an entree, I had a Sada Dosa.  It looked good, like a giant crepe, but it was really bland.  It tasted like stale bread.  It came with coconut, and I put some chicken and rice along with some creamy tomato sauce from my husband's and kids' dishes.  It helped, but it still wasn't great.  My entree also came with a lentil soup.  I've never had anything that tasted bland and overly spicy at the same time until then.  At first, it tasted just like split pea soup, which I hate by the way.  Then, five seconds later, the heat dial turned up to 11 and my eyes were watering and I began choking.  I gave it to my husband to eat.  He took one bite and said it sucked.  I figured at least the rice would be good, but nope, it was way overdone and dry as a bone.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the chicken tikka marsala, and my kids ordered the mixed grill and lamb curry.  I tried a bit of their dishes and I thought they were pretty good, though the chicken from the mixed grill was very bland and dry.  Daughter No. 1 really liked the lamb curry, though Daughter No. 2 was less than impressed and barely touched her food.  My husband said his dish was okay but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nWe decided to pass on dessert.  Our waiter was nice, better than the host, at least, but he was a little slow, especially with the check.  I'm really surprised at all the good reviews.  Maybe we just came on a bad night, but we'll probably go to a different Indian restaurant in the future."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Seriously yum!!!

There were so many people on deck that we had no seats and had to eat standing for a good 30 min... our dining area/buffet location was in the bottom floor, and they were also having a dance party on the floor above us.

They can be found in Concourses A, E, and T. This review is for the Goldbergs located in Concourse T next to Gate T12. I stopped by this Goldsbergs to pick up breakfast while waiting to board a flight at Gate T15. The dining options are limited in this concourse compared to the others, especially on the north side (Gates T9-T15).\\n\\nThe store is small with no interior seating, but there are small two-top tables lined up against the glass windows across the way. Inside, there are a couple open air display fridges with beverages from bottled water to Naked Juice. On the other side is a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, coffee, tea, and a tiny self-serve counter with napkins, utensils, sugar packets, etc. There is one line and two registers.\\n\\nBreakfast is served all day and consists of bagels, bagel sandwiches, waffles, oatmeal, pastries, croissants, and muffins. Lunch and dinner consists mainly of sandwiches such as turkey and roast beef, chicken salad, tuna salad, Reubens, and pastramis. They've got chicken noodle soup and chili too. Expect to spend roughly $4-8 per breakfast item and $8-12 per lunch/dinner sandwich.\\n\\nI had an everything bagel with lox cream cheese ($4.25). Other bagel types offered by Goldbergs include plain, wheat, cinnamon raisin, and sesame. The everything bagel had different seeds on it (poppy, caraway, sesame) and was flavored with salt, garlic, and onion. The bagel was served in sandwich form, conveniently split and halved, with lox-flavored cream cheese in the center.\\n\\nNo, there were not actual brined salmon fillets. However, I thought Goldberg's lox cream cheese tasted just fine -- smooth, thick, and creamy. The bagel was alright too. Cold, chewy, and flavors commensurate to the everything bagel ingredients described above. The sandwich was neatly wrapped in paper and placed in a paper bag, making it a great option to take with you on the plane in case you want to store it to eat on the plane. Just be careful not to spill seeds everywhere. :)\\n\\nService was A-OK.\\n\\nNote: I originally posted this review to the Goldberg's business listing at https://www.yelp.com/biz/goldbergs-atlanta-4 on 12/17/2016.

BOY was I wrong. From the seating - to the service to the food - it was subpar.  Two of us ended up attached to a toilet after eating here.  \\n\\nWe were off to go to a game that kicked off at 3 - so we turned up here at 1 looking to get some good filling grub in order to avoid paying 6 dollars for a hot dog.  We walked in - hostess - really weird.  She asked me if I needed two kids menus when my eldest who is 12 but looks 15 who is 120 pounds and 5ft 6in. Really that child is bigger than me and she will take a kids meal?  Anyway - she walks over to the booth which she begins to wipe down throwing all the crumbs and left overs of the previous party on the floor.  Then comes the red headed waitress - she was nice and very attentive. I requested ice water for all of us and 4 orders of salmon sashimi as starters while we look at the menu.  Keep in mind each order of sashimi is $5.  She comes back with the water and then the fish -  The fish was the wrong cut of salmon - not sashimi grade- and it looked like it was taken off pre-made nigiri as it still had the curve and it was dried up - exposed in the fridge air had gotten to it. \\nSo I kindly decline and ask if the chef would be nice enough to cut us some fresh fish. She leaves to state what we asked.  When she came back we ordered.  My husband got a bowl of clam chowder , I got a grilled salmon sandwich to share with him , my 7 year old fish and chips, and my 12 year old a grilled halibut sandwich.  Me and my daughter also got a bowl of clam chowder as a side.  After we placed the order the \\"chef\\" comes and states that he does not have any fish he can cut and that he had already precut all the salmon for the nigiri. That means that he had all of it sitting in a fridge with the rice! BLAH ! Horrific!\\nI nicely declined any entertainment of sushi from this place after that. \\n\\nSo, then the manager a young lady obviously not happy apologized for not having the sushi we want - as they pride themselves on sushi. She would be happy to give us shashimi but she cant because all the food is pre-made fresh.  My eldest said \\" How is it fresh if it's pre-made\\" .  The response -- a blank look.  Nevertheless we were offered some warm bread and then our food arrived.  \\nThe soup - sent back - it was gray in color and well, it is possible that it is fresh - because some potatoes were raw but it could be that they take premade stuff and then add more veggies to spread it - or take old soup and cook with more ingredients (yes restaurants do this) -- bottom line NASTY. \\nThe grilled salmon sandwich - so messy!! So so so Messy and not tasty it had so much dressing it was like I ordered a sandwich to go with my dressing .  The fried were good - frozen kind but they were cooked well. \\nThe grilled halibut sandwich - HORRIFIC.  Need I state that my child had nothing to eat but Kellogs Special K in the late am - she only ate half of it - because it put her off somehow... guess what - at the game she was vomiting and running to the bathroom ! Boooooo!!! \\n\\nMy youngest - couldn't eat her food until 20 min had passed!  The fish was so hot it burnt my finger tips trying to cut it up for her.  By far a nasty experience.

I've visited Hawkers in the past and had a great experience. This time I wanted to bring my very picky eater husband to try it out. My husband is a 30 year old \\"I still don't like any vegetables\\" type of guy. Luckily he found chicken wings and french fries on the menu and was happy.  (Yes, I am married to a big child haha)\\n\\nRemember to check in when you get to Hawkers. The check in got us a free order of summer rolls. Now, my picky no eating vegetables husband loved them. I think he actually loved the peanut sauce that came with them, but regardless he ate them. I also ordered wok fried lettuce and a cod dish. This is a tapas type place where you order smaller dishes that are priced from $3-6. They do also offer some large plate choices for about $8.00. The husband loved the fries and the wings. The fries had cinnamon on them and served with a sweet chili sauce. These made the fries really unique and tasty. The chicken wing he said were tasty and juicy. \\n\\nMy wok fried salad was light and delicious. It had a few mushrooms and peppers mixed in. It was also tossed in a tasty soy sauce. I did not have much luck with the cod dish. I do not eat meat or chicken, so I am usually eating and loving fish. However, I couldn't do this dish. The fish was way too fishy tasting for me and I did not care for the sauce at all. I pushed it aside and continued to eat the lettuce. The server noticed I didn't eat it and asked if I wanted something else. I said I was fine but thank you. About five minutes later the manager came to our table and asked me what was wrong with the dish. I stated that nothing was wrong, I just personally didn't care for it. He informed me that dish is an iffy one for people. He suggested I try the black bean fish instead.. He said it was his favorite and a lot of people seem to love it. Even though I told the server no thanks, he talked me into trying something else. I am super glad I did!\\n\\nThe dish was excellent and I loved the sauce. When the bill came I was even more surprised. I figured we would be charged for either or both of the fish dishes. I did not ask for a replacement dish, I did not complain about the food, so I expected to pay for something. That was not the case. The manager came and told me he took off the cod dish because I didn't like it, and he wanted to give me the other fish dish on the house so I knew what I would like for next time. I found this very generous. Then our way out the door the manager stopped us again at the door and told us he messed up the bill. He forgot to take off the price of the summer rolls because he knew we were supposed to get them for free through our Yelp check in. Our bill was only $15.00 for two filling meals before the summer rolls, so I told him thank you but not to worry about it. \\n\\nIt is managers and servers like this who will keep me coming back to restaurants!"},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful food and service!!

This is some good a$$ food and some good a$$ coffee! One thing I love is that there is not one dedicated waitstaff member to each table. This means there was always someone coming by to make sure we were okay. The staff was very attentive to keeping our coffee cup and water cup filled.  \\nI couldn't decide what to order but eventually decided on an egg white omelet, the Meat Lovers Omelet to be exact. MEAT MEAT CHEESE MEAT AND MORE MEAT! HEAVEN!!! It was sooooo good! The omelet came with hash browns and toast. One would think toast is toast right. Not the case at Cafe Java. I'm not sure what toasting method or butter they are using but it is working in a very GOOD way. I was full and wanted to stop eating the toast but I couldn't. No jelly even needed. \\n\\nYea I can't wait to go back here. A good breakfast place close to where I live.

The pork, which had no inkling of seasoning or smokiness, was drowned in a tomato sauce that made it resemble a pile of sloppy joe. The flatbread didn't help - it was thick and doughy, and quickly sogged up from the excess sauce.\\n\\nOur chicken sandwich was a little better - it arrived on an enormous, slightly flavorless, doughy bun. The chicken breast was only about 1/4 of an inch thick and cooked very dry, with an herb breading and slathered with a spiced, smoky aioli. All the spice and heat was in the aioli - the chicken itself was pretty bland.\\n\\nBoth came with garlic parmesan fries which were just as disappointing as everything else we ordered.

It does not warrant a 1-star review as the food is fairly good, but it's the service and the way this place is run, that make me give it 2-stars.\\n\\nThe menu - I'm confused about the menu.  If you've looked at their menu online, it is different from the menu you get in house.  There are at least 4 items I counted that you can find online that are not available in the tavern itself.  There is not a great variety in their menu, only 6 dinner entrees, a few burgers and pizza.  I've not ordered a burger, but they do look really good.  Their fries are excellent, hand-cut with the skin on.  Definitely the best I've found in the past year.  But the lack of options on the menu, and the discrepancy between their website and the actual restaurant do not make me want to rush back here.\\n\\nThe service - Here is where the biggest problem lies.  I cannot actually speak to the table service, as I have only sat at the bar here.  When I have the option I will always sit at the bar as I find the service is (usually) better.  However, my experience with two of the bartenders here has been anything but good.\\n\\nOn one visit my girlfriend and I stopped in after work.  We wanted to grab a few drinks and a bite to eat before going home.  On this occasion our bartender started out very pleasant.  She was smiling and friendly and attentive. But after we ordered our second round of drinks, her demeanor changed drastically.  It seemed like she was judging us because we ordered another drink.  She made us feel awkward and uncomfortable and like we shouldn't be drinking that much, but this was only our second drink in an hour.  By the time we ordered a third drink (90 mins after we arrived) she could not have been more unfriendly.  However we still tipped 20% and planned on coming back again.  The next time we went, she was tending bar again.  She stared us down, recognized us after a minute, and was instantly unfriendly, again.  We left after 1 drink we were so uncomfortable.\\n\\nSo we decided to go back again.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe because we live around the corner.  But against our better judgment, we went back.  We had a different bartender this time, and it seemed as if things were looking up.  She was friendly and quick to get us a drink (although we were the first people to walk in when it opened).  However, within a few minutes she had exhibited the level of service that we have (sadly) come to expect from the BHT.  We ordered a basket of fries to munch on while we had our first drink.  She put out a placemat for us and walked away.  A few mins later a server came out and dropped off our fries.  However we had no plates, no napkins, no silverware, and our drinks were empty.  We went to look for our bartender, and she was nowhere to be found.  When we finally spotted her, she was writing on the specials board.  We watched as she literally spent at least 10 mins writing \\"Sour Grape Martini\\" and drawing a grouping of 6 grapes.  This literally took 10 mins, I am not exaggerating.  There were probably about 10 customers sitting at the bar by this point, but their needs would have to wait because she wasn't happy with the way \\"Sour Grape Martini\\" and 6 grapes looked.  I finally got up and walked to an empty table and grabbed some place settings so we could eat our food.  When she had finally finished her masterpiece and had come back behind the bar, she asked if we wanted another drink.  I told her that I didn't want another Bass Ale because it seemed to be watery.  I told her this not to be a jerk, but to inform her that there might be a problem with their draft system.  It tasted more like a Bud than a Bass.  She had no response to this and just shrugged it off with an \\"okayyyyy\\" that sounded more Valley Girl than tavern bartender.  For the remainder of our time she was cold and unfriendly.\\n\\nThat was enough for us. \\n\\nWe will be hard pressed to ever go back to the Black Horse again.  And that's really too bad.  This place would be perfect.  It's a 30-second walk from our house, and we've been looking for a good local.  However, our experience with these two particular bartenders, have made us want to never come back again.  A tavern is place to hang out, a place to relax.  A tavern is where you want to go after a hard days work where you can have a drink, unwind, and grab a nice bite to eat; not to be judged and ignored and made to feel unimportant and insignificant."},{"name":"Tamale House East","address":"1707 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Prices have gone up, which isn't a surprise when you consider the rent, but they are still one of the cheapest places in town.\\n\\nThey've added more seating, take credit cards now, and they have bands like The Brew play on Thursdays.

Jacqueline's ROTD, all the 5's that were plastered on her, the intriguing descriptions of everything from the decor through the food to the beer selection.  But I was also curious, since there were more than a couple of detractors: Lauren's \\"underwhelming\\" 3-star review, the disturbing warning from David S, the gripes about the poor value...  After all, I said 'yes' to 7 out of the 8 questions that Tina V.W. posed.  I know we're all different, but either this place is supremely inconsistent, or it's the difference between eastern and western palates being greater than reported.  How else do you explain the same bowl of Laksa being \\"great bowl of delight\\" to one reviewer, and \\"disgusting\\" to the next?  Unless it wasn't the same bowl of laksa!\\n\\nMy own personal experience was that the food ranged from slurp-delicious (the satay!), through \\"it was OK!\\" (duck, hawker's delight, and Singapore mei-fun), to 2-star 'meh' (vegetarian spring-roll).  I do love having brown rice on the menu.  Other Asian places should start doing that too.  The micro-brew choices are phenomenal and don't really carry \\"ouch-gouge!\\" price tags, but that cannot be said of food prices in general.  The mei fun was a very small portion - I KNOW this is a tapas place, but they charged $6.50 for it, you know.  The duck, at $5 or $6 for 5 little pieces that don't even comprise an entire duck leg, is galling bordering on abusive.  If I'm doing word association with this place, \\"Good value\\" is not going to come up.\\n\\nAnother reviewer said that the music isn't loud enough.  Actually, the problem with acoustics is that it's all glass and metal, not because the music is too soft or too loud.  Decor is bright and pleasant.

I tend to eat pork or chicken, while my husband is a red meat and potato guy.  I decided to go out on a limb and order the duck and my husband ordered the NY Strip. He said he wouldn't have ordered the rabbit if i didn't!!!  The rabbit was so tender and delicious and was not gamey at all. The rabbit came with a bacon ravioli and butternut squash - holy moly it was divine! And of course we couldn't leave with out dessert - Mocha Latte Cheesecake. It was okay. The consistency was a little too dense and not as creamy as I would have liked.  But it still tasted delicious!  The best part of our dinner was the service.

We do have a few places that are decent - just nothing that consistently makes me say, \\"THAT'S what I'm talking about!\\"\\n\\nWhile I'm not sure Exotic Thai rises to that level in all of its offerings, it does have a few that I think are outstandingly good.  The chicken larb (ground chicken mixed with mint and lime - and by the way, it is strangely satisfying to pretend you're a pirate when you're referring to this dish and call it \\"larrrrrrrrrrrrb!\\") is insanely delicious, as are the green curry on the curry section of their menu (the one with the eggplant in it) and their Gatee Tom Yum Gai soup (although they call it something more generic like \\"coconut chicken soup\\" - despite their name, I guess they didn't want to sound TOO exotic).  I also tried the shrimp Thai fried rice (good, but not wow), their pad thai (better than average for restaurant pad thai, but not fabulous - however, I'm a total pad thai snob), and their red curry with coconut milk (very very good, but not as rich and flavorful as the red curry at Thai Kitchen, IMO). \\n\\nPrices seem to be a little on the lower end as far as Thai food goes - most entrees are between $6.50-$7.50, IIRC, although there are a few in the \\"food\\" portion of their menu (yes, you read that correctly) that range up to around $10.  However, the portions are more or less individual portions (albeit generous ones) - I wouldn't say they are quite as large as some of the more \\"family style\\" portions you sometimes find at Thai restaurants.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, the atmosphere is a little on the sterile/generic side.  You wouldn't expect them to be turning fantastic, authentic Thai food out of this kitchen.  But it's surprisingly good given the surroundings.  If you're in the area, I definitely recommend that you give it a try; it may even be worth a special trip for that larb or the green curry.

Between the six of us there we tried the chicken and sun dried tomato sausage, the wild boar, the antelope and venison, the duck and fig, the fried chicken, and the hog (they don't roast a hog everyday, but they happened to be having an \\"end of the world party\\"). The chicken and sun dried tomato sausage was delicious, the duck and fig was good but not super flavorful, the fried chicken was good, but the wild boar and the antelope and venison were horrible. They were dry and hard to eat and just an embarrassment for an establishment that specializes in sausage.  The special hog plate (hog, blistered peppers, rice and beans, and corn), was DAMN good. If that was all I had tried I probably would have loved this place.  The hog was nice and juicy and outrageously delicious, especially in combination with the blistered peppers.\\n\\nBanger's does have a HUGE beer selection but every time I picked a beer it always seemed to be out.  The hubs was happy though and tried a pretty big selection of local craft beers. \\n\\nProbably the worst part about this place was the service. Look, I get that it's busy and that you're throwing an \\"end of the world\\" party so its even busier, but staff the place accordingly. Our waitress would disappear forever. We ran out of water and beer on multiple occasions and learned to order our next beer when our current one was still half to 3/4 full. Worst of all, when the waitress asked if we wanted to dessert she paid attention to half of our party, took their order, and then without taking a second glance at the other half of our party just walked away. Never mind that they wanted some dessert.  We didn't see her again until she brought the dessert 10 minutes later, so the people in our party didn't want to hold the other half up by ordering their dessert at that point. \\n\\nI'd go back, but probably just to sit at the bar, and maybe if they're roasting a hog that day!"},{"name":"Absolutely Asia","address":"864 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"Service tereble, food ok watter looked that she didn't want do nothing.

We saw a few options but reviews like Denise's about it being the best BBQ she's ever tasted made me decide it was worth a visit. \\n\\nRight when we walked in, we were greeted by this obscenely delicious smell of BBQ. As we were being led to our booth, we saw the huge platter being taken to a table *drool*. \\n\\nWe knew we wanted to try all of it so we got the platter. It says it feeds 2-3 people but I dare say it would feed 4 people comfortably unless 4 were extremely athletic men or people who attend eating competitions. I eat a lot...probably enough for two women. Many people have commented on how I hoover food and they don't understand how I can pack it all in. Even I couldn't make a huge dent in this platter. We ended up packing it to go which resulted in 4 boxes. \\n\\nThe atomic turds are jalapenos grilled with pulled pork and cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. These are NOT traditional jalapeno poppers that are deep friend. These were delicious. What a great way to wet our appetite for the main attraction.\\n\\nOur platter arrived, the skies partied, light beamed down and angels sang. It was glorious *cue Macklemore music*. But seriously, the positive reviews weren't lying - this is amazing. I've had a lot of brisket in my day and this was fall apart tender. The bounce test passed. The smoke ring was lovely. The fall apart in my mouth was out of this world. The taste was there, it was moist...oh my. Best brisket I've had in Metro Vancouver. The ribs were also fall apart tender, well seasoned and the smoke ring was non existent because the whole dang thing was pink pink pink! I don't mean as in undercooked but as in that thing was smoked to perfection. The roasted chicken was also moist and well seasoned. The pulled pork was also delicious. Pretty much all of their meat is amazing; the exception being the farmhouse sausage. I felt it was too lean and didn't really do much for me. The snap on the casing was great but I didn't like the actual sausage itself. The white bread was stale and extremely dry and I wish they'd just use villagio or something because it would at least be pillowy soft and easy to absorb bbq sauce and meat awesomeness. The cornbread was so good; maybe they could skip the white bread all together and just give everyone 6 cornbread muffins? Their house BBQ sauce is also really well made. Coleslaw was a homerun.\\n\\nThe only things I weren't a fan of: potato salad and pit beans. I want more beans and less of the onion or whatever else was in there. Other than that, the beans itself tasted great and were cooked well. I just found biting into the onion or whatever in there offputting. \\n\\nOur server was also fantastic. She came to check on us often. Our food came out quickly and it came out hot (the latter you'd think is standard but isn't in many of the BBQ places in town). \\n\\nNow we have leftovers for days and we aren't complaining!"},{"name":"Bouchee","address":"159 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Bouchee is a perfect fit for Newbury.

My \\"French 75,\\" made with Hennessy, was incredibly smooth and silky going down.  Amazing how one drink can really set the bar for a meal!  Once I found out that lobster risotto was one of the specials du jour, I had to have it.  It came out plated gorgeously--hunks of sweet lobster nestled in butter risotto, topped with a lovely salad scattered with artichoke chips.  Just perfection!  The boyfriend enjoyed steak au poivre, which was served with a side of GIANT asparagus spears--again, delicious.  We ended the meal with creme brulee, which was the only flaw in our entire meal.  While the burnt sugar crust was really good, the custard was nearly flavorless.  It was like eating a dish of butter.  \\n\\nService was extremely attentive throughout despite the very busy dining room.

We had 3 runners with us and were looking for a place where they could carbo load while non-runners could be satisfied with non-pasta dishes if desired.  Rustic Kitchen was the perfect place to hold such a dinner because 1-they had the space to fit such a large party, 2-were having pasta specials for runners and 3-had a pretty decent menu if you didn't want the pasta.  \\n\\nOur reservations were at 5pm but the majority of people showed up around 6pm which turned out to be completely fine.  We weren't given that annoying line that you can't be seated until everyone has arrived.  We had the entire room to ourselves so it didn't matter.  The table was huge and the seats were cushiony, making me feel like I was sinking further down.  I felt like a little girl sitting at the adults table for holiday meals and in need of a booster seat.  My one complaint: the service could have been a little better. For a party of 15 and knowing that there are hungry runners waiting, the servers should have brought double the number of bread baskets and olive/hummus dishes.  They only brought 3 baskets and everything  disappeared within seconds.  Also, the server never asked if we wanted wine. She just poured the water in the glasses and walked out.  Had I not asked about their wine list, she would have never come back for our wine order. And even after I ordered, she never checked with the other end to see if anyone else wanted anything off the wine menu. \\n\\nNow onto the food:  1/5 of the table got the Mac N'Cheese and 100% of the table agreed that it was PHENOMENAL.  The mac n'cheese consisted of porcini mushrooms and green peas.  The cheese was creamy but not overwhelming.  My bf got the hangar steak with bleu cheese & fries (which was pretty tasteless) and the fries were soggy.  The rigatoni came in a cast iron pan and had some kind of sausage in it and looked pretty good.  All 3 runners got the \\"carbo load special\\" which was a choice of 4 pastas, 6 sauces, and different ingredients.  2 of the runners chose the veal meatballs, and they licked the plate clean.  To me, it didn't look like there was enough pasta to load up on anything but then again, I didn't have their dish.  They said it was good though.  \\n\\nOn a side note, I did ask the server to bring in a cake of some sort so we could wish a group member a happy birthday. The girl gave me a choice of the desserts, so I picked Molten Chocolate Cake.  However, when she came in with the candle on the cake, it defintiely was not molten chocolate anything. It was straight up chocolate mousse. Oh well....so all in all...it was okay.

Excellent experience once we had been seated!!!!!!!\\n\\n If this review was based solely on food, it would have 5 stars. It loses two stars for me because it is so horribly run and managed, it becomes nearly not worth it. Our party of 9 (yes, large, but Hibachi caters to and attracts big groups) waited 45 minutes and we HAD A RESERVATION. Our reservation was for 7:30 and we weren't even seated until 8:15. The man who appeared to be running the front desk and reservations and arrivals could not have been more clueless and incompetent in dealing with his overwhelming crowd. There were about 3 other parties of 8+ people crammed in the entry way asking why they weren't seated when they had reservations for nearly 30 minutes ago. It was literally a disaster and I was shoved into a plant while the crowd continued to grow and servers attempted to get by. \\n\\nOsaka MUST rework how they approach their management and reservations. They clearly overbooked their hibachi but having seemingly no limit to the number of reservations available. Dear Manager, reservations are to reserve tables, not simply there for the heck of it.

So they took some fold-out chairs and shoved 2 at the corners of a regular table.  Not so classy.  Any expectations I had of this place started out really low.\\n\\nLuckily, the food more than compensated.  For the table of us we ordered many many tapas for division.  We started out with edamame and the sunomono combo, an almost ceviche-esque fish treated with vinegar that was one of my favorite things all night.  If I were going to do it again I'd just get the mackerel, as that was the best in the combo.\\n\\nWe soon realized that 2 dishes at a time wouldn't be enough, so we started ordering in threes.  The next round, we got a cucumber-rolled naruto maki, a spicy tuna roll (even though you don't come to shiki for maki, they still made a damn fine spicy tuna roll), and their divine beef tataki, the last of which was in my top three dishes of the night.\\n\\nFor round three we went for the heartier stuff: softshell crab, grilled eggplant, and broiled fatty yellowtail kama.  I think the eggplant was my favorite of the three, and you have to be careful about getting all the meat off the yellowtail cuz there's lots to be overlooked if you don't really get in there!\\n\\nThough originally we were only planning on these 8 dishes, we were still hungry.  So we asked for recommendations!  The waitress recommended two of the specials: a stuffed squid dish and pork belly dish, and one from the regular menu: a halibut carpaccio.

My friends all raved over the pork belly, I'm just a non-pig eater so I can't say firsthand.\\n\\nBecause we were celebrating a birthday we went with ice cream desserts and tried a little bit of everything: their vanilla (some of the best vanilla ice cream I've had), their green tea, their ginger, and their Mango sorbet.  It was all I could do to not lick the bowl, but the Mango and the Ginger were my favorites!\\n\\nAll told, over the course of 3 hours, we consumed 11 tapas plates and 4 bowls of ice cream between five of us, and even though we only divided the check 4 ways (so the bday girl wouldn't need to pay), even with drinks, our bills still came to under $40 a person!  Not bad for the immense variety and high quality of food we tried.\\n\\nNow you just need to work on your service.  Fill our water glasses when they're empty, and when we're done eating don't wait another *half hour* to give us our bill.

However, another young man we flagged down to help us here and there was a much better server (though he was not our main server) who smiled and was willing to help us out. For him, he would be a 4 star, the young lady a 3 star. \\nAltogether: 3.5 star for service\\n\\nFood: As one of the only places in Orlando that served Malaysian Laksa and Malaysian Prawn Mee, we gave this place a try knowing it was Asian Fusion. The way their food is set up is tapas bar style, which makes a good revenue since you make a small amount of food and charge it for a tapas price (not cheap like dim sum - family/tapas style!). \\nTheir Prawn Mee (entree dish) consisted of good ingredients, however extremely unflavorful. It was obvious that the broth was made of beef stock, and tasted more like unflavorful Chinese beef noodle soup with tons of hot peppers added to it, real spicy. (2 star)\\nThe Prawn Mee (entree dish) tasted like weak curry soup, again with fresh ingredients, but poor flavor. (2 star)\\nWe also ordered the black bean fish filet (tapas dish), which was absolutely delicious, with great ingredients as well. (4 star)\\n3 star\\n\\nThis place, unfortunately, is not the place to go for authentic Asian food. It is obvious when you read the category this place is put in as \\"Asian Fusion\\" which is not real authentic. Hawker's has a wonderful set up with great ambience, I highly appreciated the nostalgic \\"newspaper tables\\" and walls. My rating for this place would be higher, had it been for a better server that makes the experience funner. Anything you order off the tapas menu can be found with bigger portions (and better pricing) at other authentic restaurants. It is real obvious when you find few Asians working this place as well as eating here, that this is not an authentic restaurant. Overall, this is a place for people who are willing to eat \\"Asian\\" food the American way, and not step into the real culture. \\nI will commend the way that they have Americanized Asian dining into a prettier experience for Americans.

Even with a dinner reservation, the lounge was at capacity and we had to wait a bit before they let us downstairs. \\n\\nBut back to the restaurant ... very modern and open layout. Exposed brick, high ceilings, open kitchen area. Props to their designer.

I always leave stuffed and happy.\\n\\nA friend of mine who grew up on Buford Hwy invited some of us from work to a hot pot dinner.  There were 5 of us, and we got to sit at one table with a chair pulled up.\\n\\nI'm thankful my friend was there to help explain things.  We got 1 pot in the middle of our table, which was split into 3 sections so we could have different flavors of broth.  We got spice, normal, and nutrition.  The normal broth is a standard salty flavor and is the base of all the broth flavors.  For spicy, they add spice, and for nutrition, they add ingredients that are good for your health (jujube, ginger slices, things like that).  As we chowed down and drank some of the broth, the staff came by and replenished the broth from kettles of hot broth.  My friend would dip out some of the broth to drink like a soup, and I liked doing this, too, after adding some seasonings from the seasonings counter.\\n\\nThe seasonings counter is near the front door, to the left.  You can help yourself to all the things there.  Sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, special sauce, fish sauce, garlic oil, etc.  There is also a dessert and, I think, another soup of some sort there.  I usually get two small bowls.  One for garlic and salt and sesame oil and one for just soy sauce.  Get a new bowl when you need more.\\n\\n(The bathrooms are located beyond the seasonings counter, by the way.  They are 1-stall single-use rooms.)\\n\\nNow onto the menu!  The price is $18.95 per person, all you can eat for 2 hours.  I've seen a single person chow down by themselves, and I believe the staff adjusts the portions they bring out according to the number of people at the table.  They're happy to accommodate your request for a small portion, too.\\n\\nThe menu shows a long list of options.  Mark what you want brought to the table, wait patiently for a little while, then pass the raw foods into the boiling broth and dip it out with the ladles provided.\\n\\nGolden mushrooms = enoki mushrooms\\nBlack mushroom = shitake mushrooms\\nFungus = wood ear mushroom (I think)\\n\\nI highly recommend ordering the handmade noodles and the lamb pancake.  The lamb pancake is brought out on a plate already cooked and crispy.  The same goes with the buns, which I don't like as much. \\n My other favorites are the golden mushrooms, vermicelli, nappa (cabbage), lamb or pork dumplings (which go into the pot), and sliced beef.  I like to make sure I add in plenty of veggies like the cabbage or bean sprouts because these meals can feel pretty heavy after a while.  The mussels, by the way, taste like the ocean, not like the kind I was used to that were simmered in butter and white wine, haha.\\n\\nThere are some premium items that cost extra at the bottom of the menu.  You can have a delicious meal without them, so don't feel pressure to go all in.\\n\\nWhen you want more food, you can mark again on your menu and let the staff know what you want.\\n\\nMy husband and I loved our first visit with work friends so much that we brought my mother here for her first hot pot experience, too!  She's not good with chopsticks, so I made sure to serve her from the pot so that she'd get enough food.\\n\\nThere's a medium-sized parking lot for the whole plaza.  If you're feeling really bold, there's a rolled Thai ice cream place a few storefronts down, but honestly, we were full enough from dinner and should not have gone afterward for dessert (both times).\\n\\nThe restaurant has TVs, very friendly staff, and a lot of tasty options.

The beef taco plate had 3 tiny strips of beef they were not seasoned and a bit over cooked. The roasted chicken taco had to be the worst when I lifted the taco so much water leaked out of it I had a plate a full and the taco was soggy, the chicken was completely unseasoned.

We had.\\n\\nTo Deschutes' credit, our server offered us a free appetizer, but we were so hungry we passed and ordered right away. I went with a medium-rare bleu cheese & bacon burger, my wife went with the veggie burger.\\n\\nBy the time our food arrived, I was running outside to feed the meter, since it was an hour after we walked in the door. I realize now what took so long: They were cooking my medium-rare burger into a charred hockey puck. Had I not been so hungry, I would've sent it back, but at that point I just wanted to eat and go home.\\n\\nI'm not a huge stickler for exact meat done-ness, especially with a mere 1/3 lb patty, which can go from rare to medium in seconds. But my standards go up when you're charging $12.75 for a burger. They go up even more when the menu describes exactly what to expect from your medium-rare. (Cooked on the outside, pink and barely warm inside.)\\n\\nMy medium rare burger was beyond cooked through. It was dry. No pink in sight. The only thing that saved it was the bacon and bleu cheese, which were both tasty. The sweet potato fries were also decent, but not extraordinary.\\n\\nI'm willing to forgive a service screw up or the occasional kitchen misfire.

I have had the pleasure of following Chef Long around ever since he started at Sushi Pop in Oviedo a few years ago. He then worked for Chef Henry at Kabooki for a few years and now settled at the restaurant. As I stated, it is in their soft opening stages which means, there will be mistakes and longer wait times but hopefully it will be cleared up and worked on before the grand opening. So far here is what I observed. \\n\\nParking is in a pretty big plaza on Alafaya Trail (434) almost near Mitchell Hammock road. Plenty of parking for sure unless you happen to get one in front of the restaurant.  The inside is clean and contemporary. The bar is a nice height so you don't have to either reach up or lean down. Where I sat, I had a birds eye view of the bar, hibachi area and into the kitchen. The menu was well organized. You have your appetizers, cold and hot items and of course the sushi portion. Your typical rolls, sashimi, nigiri, bowls and moriwassee combinations. The price is a wee bit higher then other sushi restaurants but you pay what you get.\\n\\nI settled on the ramen as I can have sushi anytime. Ramen not so much as it's so satisfying. I got a small appetizer of grilled Brussels sprouts to start off with. It had a nice grilled taste to it with the right amount of garlic and what tasted like balsamic dressing flavor. The ramen came out next but I waited quite a while as they were doing other things around the kitchen. I reminded myself, it's soft opening. There will be hiccups along the way. The ramen came out in a small tall bowl. The presentation was nice. 4 white gelatinous composition which I think was fish balls and 4 pieces of pork belly. The pork belly was nice and firm. It was not overly done with seasoning. It was perfect. The noodles were cooked properly and had a nice firm bite. The soup was seasoned right. Not overly spicey or with tangy seasoning, just smooth flavor. \\n\\nAll in all, I was impressed. Chef Long had a group of followers with him including me in enjoying his master sushi skills. I will definitely come back and try their various sushi rolls on the menu."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The chicken fried beef rib delivered in every way.

We looked at the menu they have posted on the window, and we were sold.  \\n\\nUpon entering, you notice the bar on the left and the large dining room on the right.  The lighting is dim, and they have good music playing.  The best thing about this place is the fact that they brew their own beer.  While waiting to be seated (about 10 minutes), I took a trip to the restrooms.  On the way there you can see the brewery and copper barrels through glass doors.  It was awesome to see that, and made the restaurant unique.  \\n\\nTo get started, I ordered the beer sampler.  It came with 6 4oz glasses of beer, which I got to choose from the menu.  I thought that 5 of my 6 beers were excellent.  I did not enjoy the darkest beer very much, but I do not usually enjoy stouts so I was not surprised. \\n\\nFor our meal, my sister and I ordered:\\n1. Cheese spinach dip (Appetizer)\\n2. Oregon Blue Bacon Burger with Sweet potato fries\\n3. Chicken Burger with salad.\\n\\nWe shared our burgers so that we could try both.

I usually do not like Sweet Potato fries, but I decided to give them a second chance, and I enjoyed them.  The chicken burger was good, but it was not excellent.  Both my sister and I agreed that we have had better.  The portions were a good size, and we were left with leftovers to take back to the hotel.

Even though I gave this place 3 stars, there is just so much to say. So I'll try to make this as brief as possible. \\n\\nThe food is ok. The bread they serve is odd to me because of its texture: it's soft and crumbly, clearly has seasonings on it,  and it's served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I'm just not used to crumbly bread. We also ordered their calamari which was under-seasoned, needing more salt but it had the light batter texture that I enjoy. The marinara dipping sauce served with the calamari was watered down. There's some flavor but not enough considering how the calamari had little flavor. It's a nice portion of calamari, but not worth $11. \\n\\nThe entrees aren't bad. I had the Black Ink Tagliatelle with which came with clams and mussels (2 pieces of shrimp too) all wrapped up in parchment paper, while my boyfriend had Linguini a Vongele (Linguini with clams in a white sauce). At first, I was really impressed with the black ink tagliatelle since it had that chewy texture. The more I thought about it though, the ink doesn't really give the noodles any flavor - it's really just the \\"ooh\\" factor with the color. The flavor seemed to come from the same marinara sauce used with the calamari. Maybe I'm not familiar with Italian food, but I've never encountered the use of parchment paper before with pasta. \\n\\nService was a little sub-par. Our waiter seemed a little loopy like he was drunk or high: forgetting our appetizer, forgetting bread and coming over 2 separate times to provide us a plate/tiny-fork for our seafood before our entrees. My boyfriend had to get up and go to the bar area to ask for spoons since our waiter was either disappeared or was working another table. When working another table, I saw him sit down and start venting about his day even though the patrons didn't know him at all. I'm glad he didn't sit down with us because he was becoming creepy and weird. Our check didn't include a beer we ordered, but my boyfriend made sure the tip made up for the difference. Right before we left, the waiter started venting to us too about his day. I would chalk it up to an off day, but c'mon, be a little more professional.\\n\\nI really wanted to at least bump this up to 4 stars because the main dishes were decent but I've had better calamari and much better service elsewhere.

I've had the pork chop during my second visit there, and I was touting it as the best pork chop i've ever had to all my friends.

We had made a reso, so we were seated at one of the longer tables along the wall. It was a Tuesday night, so it wasn't too busy; the restaurant was serving three other tables besides ourselves, and the restaurant isn't too big to begin with.

It was tasty, but I still prefer regular fries to the extra crispy fried noodles. \\n\\nWe also got the Chicken Seoul Good, which was Korean fried chicken with cream, truffle oil, and grated Parmesan. The chicken was fried perfectly, was super juicy, and was so good with the creamy sauce.\\n\\nMy girlfriend adored their Heart Attack Rice, which had some chicken crackling and an egg inside, but it was a tad salty for me. \\n\\nPersonally, I LOVED their squid ink pasta with sea urchin cream.

With that in mind, I would probably give this Marriott a 3-star rating. However, I'm giving it 4 stars based on the impending renovation, my lowered expectations, and also to counteract some of the unreasonably low reviews. Maybe my experience was better than some others, but I have very few negative things to say.\\n\\nFirst off, the value. I was trying via Priceline to win the nearby Hilton Garden Inn which is a '3-star' property that I've stayed at in the past. I inadvertently won the Marriott and was a little bummed at first, but in hindsight the $55 per night(after taxes and fees) is a fantastic value.\\n\\nRooms are clearly outdated as even the most clueless person would notice, but they are obviously aware of this. No matter where you are in the hotel, they make sure you know that they are currently going through a $22 million renovation and basically to bear with them. With that said, our room was very well kept and wasn't falling apart or anything, it was just dated. The bed was huge and comfortable and the shower had great water pressure. TV is a dinosaur but the channels all came in clearly and the remote worked as expected, meaning it made me fall asleep while channel surfing. Beware that you may only receive 2 towels in your bathroom so plan ahead if you don't want to use your wife's wet hair towel and/or hand towels to dry off.\\n\\nParking is free and abundant, albeit awkwardly laid out. I like the perimeter area so location is a plus.\\n\\nPool area was surprisingly nice. I probably only call it nice because this is one of the few times I brought nothing to swim in, so I had pool envy.\\n\\nWe were able to connect to the hotel's wi-fi with no problem. I was under the assumption that wireless was only available in the public areas as evidenced by people with tablets and laptops scattered around the lobby. However, on the 14th floor we were able to connect with a pretty fast connection and for no charge.\\n\\nThe only glaringly negative thing I have to say about the hotel is the wait and the crowd on the elevators. Only 2 of the 3 elevators were working during our visit(because of renovation maybe?) and the hotel was pretty full, so there was always a long wait unless it was way off-peak hours like the middle of the night.

I had the Katsu Don. I actually really liked it.\\n\\nAtmosphere of the restaurant is pretty cool. Seeing as it was on the second floor of a building, overlooking Robson below, it grabbed our attention.\\n\\nAll in all, what completely killed the experience was poor attitude and service. While the restaurant was not so busy, the four of us (well behaved college students; myself being the only non-Japanese) were asked if we could leave by a certain time.\\n\\nFurthermore, the guy in particular who helped us kept coming to our table so frequently it was annoying. Each time, with seemingly no enthusiasm whatsoever.\\n\\nLastly, after we paid (each separate check), none of us felt the service was that great and decided not to tip. He asked \\"No tip?\\" and I played dumb and replied \\"Oh, I thought that was it..\\" he says \\"No, HST is the tax.\\"\\n\\nWe grab our things and get ready to leave, and he comes back to confront us once more. \\"There's no tip here...\\".

I love the intimate atmosphere but the overall experience still leaves much to be desired. \\n\\nMy first visit I sat a few tables away from the stage. The view and sound was nice but things were a little chaotic on the floor. The tables are really close together and feels a bit crammed in. I understand trying to seat as many as possible in the small venue but it shouldn't be at the expense of comfort. Also the waiters seemed a bit unorganized, they delivered the wrong orders to our table at least 3 times. It was halfway through the show before we were finally served and then the food was cold! I didn't even bother sending it back because the waiters took so long to come around. After the show it took almost 30 minutes between receiving and paying for the bill. \\n\\nThey have a lot of good artists on their lineup which is why I decided to double  back a few months later. This time hoping they'd worked out most of the kinks since the last show. My second show was definitely better. This time I decided to sit in the VIP section toward the back. It was a bit more roomy and way less chaotic. Plus I still had a great view of the stage. There's truly no bad seat in the house. I ordered the shrimp & grits combination which was just ok, a bit over seasoned but at least this time it was warm. \\n\\nBefore and after the show the host emphasized to make sure you \\"take care\\" of your waiters (which I always do) \\"because they work so hard.\\" I don't know if the staff is just overwhelmed with tables but on neither of my visits were the waiters very attentive. i.e. Once your food is delivered good luck seeing them again. \\n\\nOverall I think the venue has a lot of potential and I hope they continue to improve and listen to all the feedback.

However, the complaints follow pretty quickly after that initial reaction to the atmosphere. Upon check-in, there seemed to be a lot of confusion showing us to our table. The employees had a map of the tables and were shown where to direct us before heading in to the room but they still seemed lost. Once at our table- it was immediately clear that they crammed too many tables in to this space. We had to stand and wait for the waitress to take the order of the table next to ours before being able to squeeze in the aisle and sit. The table had 1 bottle of water that was already emptied by the other 2 people at our table and was never refilled during the entire show (even though requested to be refilled).\\n\\nThankfully we ate dinner elsewhere before coming to the show and we only ordered a half-carafe of wine before the show started. Our wine showed up quickly enough but no glasses were brought with our carafe. So, we sat and waited for glasses, looking around to see other tables in the same situation. The confusion among the food/drink runners was laughable. They kept showing up with glasses of wine/food that were for other tables and had no clue where tables were - just asking around, \\"is this yours?\\" The tables are numbered on a bottle on the table, but it's hard to see and once the lights go down for the show, confusion got worse and was at times very distracting. \\n\\nAnyone who ordered drinks/apps before the show - basically never saw their waiter again without asking a food runner for assistance. They would finally get to order their entrees half-way through the show. The pizza looked pretty good, but again we ate beforehand which I think was a blessing. \\n\\nThe sound - the show in general was lovely. The seats did become a bit uncomfortable about half way through the show and it was hard to see through all of the heads in front of you - but overall was a nice intimate experience with the artist. The only downfall at this point is the confused waiters/food runners and the constant dropping of plates/glassware. \\n\\nNoting all of this confusion and the lack of our waitress coming around, we caught her and asked for our check early on in the show so we wouldn't be held up at the end of the show anticipating mass confusion at that process. She didn't return with our check until the last song and brought ours among the rest of the tables she was serving. We handed her our credit card as soon as she handed us our check and she took it. The show ended --- waitress was no where in site and there is a line of servers trying to close out checks at the 1 computer in the corner. My husband got out of his seat and got it from her directly once she was located on the other side of the room - so we could get out of there before our parking expired. \\n\\nSO - overall.....venue is cute and a great idea. Even though its a tight squeeze, IF they can get their sh*t together then I would be happy to return. However, for now - I would recommend eating dinner elsewhere and just ordering a glass of wine or two and attempt to close out ASAP."},{"name":"The Rise Eatery","address":"3121 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great food!!

I will say there are no cheap reds by the glass, but from the weekly paper wine menu (also a good sign) it looks like that might change.  \\nWe did sample the chocolate cake and that was the highlight of the evening.

Everything was very aggressively seasoned but the flavors themselves are all one-note.  Hawkers completely fails to reinterpret Asian flavors as they seemed to forget/ignore the subtle contrast of flavor notes that makes Asian food so good.  All of the flavors were \\"in your face\\" and quite frankly, tasted like sauces out of a jar.  There were many concoctions & flavor combinations that were 100% off the mark for Asian food but even more unfortunately, they were awkward and borderline inedible.\\n\\nTexturally, every dish fell completely flat as there was an overall lack of textural contrast that you come to associate with Asian food.  The noodle dishes all had an awful gooey/mushy texture, not the al dente chewiness that you've come to expect.  The duck & beef were all extremely fatty and overcooked while the cod literally tasted like frozen fish fillets tossed in a black bean sauce straight from the jar.\\n\\nBy the end of our meal, my boyfriend and I concluded that the best thing from lunch was the Tiger and Kirin Light beer.

From the outside, this place didn't seem that big, but once you step in, you'll be impressed by the space and the atmosphere.\\n\\nI'm not a huge drinker so for all I know, every Portlandian brewery serves up beers as good as, or if not better, than Deschutes on the regular. But I have to give this place 5 stars for the outstanding service and the freakishly delicious food (but then again, I didn't eat a single thing in Portland that wasn't freakishly delicious).\\n\\nWe went with the Brewer's Creations, which offers a nice sample tray of 6 beers for $8. Most would consider this to be just 6 shots of beer, but I found the total volume to be pretty overwhelming. After 5 sips, I was drunk...so $8 for all that was a steal, in my opinion. Here was what we had (check out my pictures for a menu with descriptions):\\n\\nHoppy Pilsner - crisp, clean, consistent\\nBachelor Bitter - light but well-bodied with caramel hints  \\nCinder Cone Red - very complex with sweet and bitter flavors and a strong malty aftertaste \\nDouble Impact Belgian IPA - fruity and aromatic\\nFresh Squeezed IPA - smooth but packed with citrus\\nHop Henge Experimental IPA - so hoppy that I could feel it coming out of my nostrils!\\n\\nOut of the 6, the Bachelor Bitter was my favorite (spoiler alert: it's really not that bitter). Both the Pilsner and Bachelor Bitter had the lowest alcohol content and were by far the most approachable. The Pilsner really tastes as described in the menu, consistently crisp and clean from start to finish. Very drinkable, but I preferred a bit more dimensionality, which the Bachelor nicely delivered. The Red was the most complex, for me, with the flavors competing with one another until the very end. It was probably my second favorite, though. The Double Impact was my least favorite as I found it too fruity and too floral. The Fresh Squeezed IPA was heavy on the citrus, but surprisingly refreshing and tasted light despite the alcohol percentage. The Hop Henge was my husband's favorite and I can see why. There's a lot of flavor, a lot of alcohol, and a lot of bitters--but the former dominates the latter two. Each mouthful is loaded with some earthy hops but there's something--dare I say sweet?--that balances it all out. Surprisingly drinkable given the high ABV and IBU, but after two sips my head was starting to pound and I was in need of some water, stat.\\n\\nAbout halfway, we realized all the food truck food we had eaten in the morning wasn't going to be enough to sustain us through this journey of hops, malts, and alcohol, so we got ourselves the root beer braised pork belly with poached egg. I would have appreciated a bigger egg but I'm sure this one came from a bird that eats real grass and lives in a meadow. The pork belly was cut fairly thick and was crispy and fatty in all the right places. Best part though just might have been the mustard. Honestly to die for, I'd recommend their pretzels too if it means you get some of that mustard.\\n\\nOur bartender was nothing short of superb.

I did a search on yelp and found that their are many Indian restaurants and lunch buffets in Boston. But I couldn't quite find one that met my particular needs. ie...... Vegetarian and south Indian. So I did a general web search for a vegetarian indian buffet. And I found a web page \\"The Vegetarian Society of Boston\\" its a very helpful site. has listings for every thing vegetarian and vegan. Dosa n Curry was on their restaurant list .  I went here with high expectations. Also im comparing it to the current vegetarian indian buffets that I know and like. So perhaps Dosa n Curry is at an unfair disadvantage.\\n\\nI finally got their after traveling for about a 1/2 hour. I couldn't find the parking. They advertise on their website that they have parking at a separate lot on a different address. I thought perhaps the parking for them was located at the grocery store just across the street. so I pulled into the grocery store car park and it was packed out. instead of just parking and getting towed away I thought I would put in a call to Dosa n Curry and find out just where this car park was. a very nice woman answered the phone and she explained to me that the lot was just a little further down on the same side as the restaurant. after talking with her for a bit longer. And she realized that I had no idea where this lot was. She did a very nice thing she came outside and looked for me and directed me in the direction of the car park. Ok i was parked happy i finally got that over with. now to experience the buffet lunch.\\n\\nIt was about 12.30 and their was nobody in there. I was warmly greeted and my drink ordered was taken. I proceeded to the buffet. i was initially excited because from a distance walking towards the buffet it looked like that their were lots of choices. I got vegtable biryani rice and a few other things. I was looking for the idlyl and their was none in the spot where it was supposed to be. one of the attendents told me that the idyl was coming soon.  finished my first plate and went for my second plate.  i ended with herbal soup which was very good.\\n\\nThe food was ok, it was lacking the spiciness, and abundance of chilli peppers that i love, at south indian buffets. I don't know what they use for their fat, butter or oil however the food had a heaviness that i do not enjoy. usually that  comes from butter. Lacking any spiciness and kick. even the chutneys were bland. the mint chutney, which is one of my favourites was bland.  I was hoping the soup would be better than the food.. i went to get a bowl to put my soup in and i noticed they had Styrofoam cups for that. I never understand why some buffets do this. who wants to eat hot soup out of plastic or Styrofoam. I certainly don't.  Its very unhealthy!...... chemicals from the Styrofoam or plastic leeching into your soup. cancer causing chemicals.  No thanks.  So i asked the waitress(the same women that was so helpful in helping me to find the car park) if i could have a glass or ceramic bowl  for the soup. she told me that they don't have glass or ceramic and offered me a plastic pyrex  bowl. having no other option other than not eating the soup. i graciously accepted the plastic bowl. the two soups where better than any thing else i had on the buffet line. they were good. they would have been much better if they had more chili peppers. i found only one or two in the herbal soup and i didn't find any in the other soup. \\n\\nFor a weekend buffet and with a price of $13.96. that didn't have that many selections to warrant that high price and the food was a miss for me. \\n\\nThe only positive i can say was the helpful waitress."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything about Canoe is extraordinary.

The Boy and I were reeling from a recent trip to South Carolina so we cashed in some OpenTable credits for a certificate to Southern Proper.\\n\\nTo start we got Deviled Eggs - eat these little babies like they're served on top of that pickle to get that extra dill flavor in there. We also got the Pimento Cheese Popovers too. I personally found this popover a little heavy and a little dry but The Boy really enjoyed it - he loves pimento cheese - and I'll admit with the pepper jam, it was a great combination of flavors.\\n\\nWe also ordered a Smoked Hot Link sausage; this was housemade and truly delicious, served with pickles, slaw, and a bevy of sauces. If the eggs didn't convince me, this tray did. PICKLES OUT OF THIS WORLD at Southern Proper. Also the mustard and barbecue are crazy addictive. You'll be dipping for days (or until you've gobbled that sausage!).\\n\\nThank heavens we opted for the 4 piece Fried Chicken over the 8 because normally our eyes are bigger than our stomachs. You can totally do a half-n-half at SP by the way which is exactly what we did. Half classic (it's lemon & thyme) and half hot. BOTH of these were unreal and everyone knows I am the champion of spicy foods but the classic actually was my favorite between the two.\\n\\nFor sides, we opted for Collard Greens and Grits & Butter. The greens are actually some of the best I've had in Boston but pass on the grits. I got excited because it had corn in it but it was lukewarm and the pats of butter were cold which might've been the suspect for not being served piping hot. Maybe we'll get the biscuits or corn bread next time.\\n\\nWithout the certificate from OpenTable, this meal is pretty pricey (we did drinks too), but I also think it's worth the price for good Southern in Boston.

Seriously.\\n\\nAfter a great day of fun at both Universal Parks, we were starving! \\nLooked at the menu, seemed classic Italian (although my first warning was the kids eat free pasta buffet), but what the heck. It was not cheap, but reasonable and it was pretty busy. So we were seated quickly, great server, and ordered fried calamari appetizer ($11.99), seafood fra diavolo, ($ 20.00) and the NY sirloin (medium rare please) ($21.00)   Basic simple food.\\n\\nCalamari came out and was horrible. No rings (much less the heads), but rather strips, large ones, of old frozen calamari  - soggy with oil and tasted like....I can't even decide. It was not going to make you sick bad, but no flavor and the texture icky. Called the server who admitted that yes, it was frozen, they never had rings, people always complained about it, but it was always served that way. OK. So we sent it back.\\n\\nThen the entrees arrived. My steak was medium well verging on well done,  with roasted potaoes and vegetables. Server came to check and said \\"Oh I'm sorry- that is not medium rare. I'll take it back but it may be a while as we are busy. I will try and get them to make another one quickly.\\"\\n\\nThe seafood fra diavolo had 2 medium sized shrimp, 2 clams and 2 mussels - all over cooked to the point of being dried and hard. The pasta was overcooked and the fra diavolo sauce was just plain tomato sauce. Any hint of spice or flavor was not there. The server came to check on his food, and was mortified when he looked at the dish that looked old and dried out. He said \\"We don't make the sauce very spicy.\\" The natural answer to that was :But fra diavolo sauce IS spicy. That's why he ordered it. \\n\\nAt this point it is 11 pm and we are starved so he ate that and was almost done when my steak came out. It was a 9-10 oz top sirloin and full of fat and gristle (as was the first one) It was a bit rare but way better than overdone. Sadly, the potaoes and vegetables where the same as they were on the first plate. The bite I had taken out of a potatoe chunk was still there.\\n\\nThe manager came over and asked how things were. We told him and he said \\"I am sorry, but that is how we make things. How about free dessert?\\" No thank you. My normally low key BF was furious and asked how they could hire a chef who can't make basic food? He also told the manager that is was wrong to not care that 99% of the people there would never be back, and so it didn't really matter if the food sucked. He aplolgized again, but it is a chain.\\n\\nThe server took  the pasta and calamari off the bill, and was so sorry. He even said he was embarressed at working there as there were so many complaints, but he needed a job. The service was good, so we left him a good tip. It wasn't his fault. \\n\\nBottom line is the food is cheap (that piece if steak was below standard and a bad cheap cut), the basic tomato sauce was like chef boy are dee from a can, the seafood had been precooked and added at the last minute and thrown on top of overcooked pasta that had been cooked hours before and heated in hot water before being served. \\n\\nLooking around, people were eating pizza and kids eating bowls of pasta. Perhaps they had a better experience. However, having eaten at many of the restaurants throughout the years at Universal and City Walk, this is the worst. We may all think the turkey leg or monster cafe isn't the best, but compared to this place - they all are. At least they don't pretend to have a full menu and be good. They offer a few things and therer are no surprises.\\n\\nTrust me- pick any other place.

It's almost immediately obvious that the owner and his stressed-out waitstaff feel their venue is so popular that they don't need to treat their customers with respect or a level of customer service any better than you'd expect from an outdoor parking lot attendant for a Red Sox/Yankees game. Get in, get out of the way -- you got a problem with something, then tough luck. Stay and sit silently in your corner, and do what you're told, or get lost. \\n\\nI've been here twice -- the first time only hinted at the problem, and amazingly that was when the line was literally out the door and waited 30 - 45 minutes just to get a table. Ball Square Cafe showed its true colors on my second visit, when the line was only 4 people -- but unfortunately there was only room for 3 people to stand inside without getting in the way of the stressed-out waitstaff and the hard-working owner. Everywhere I moved, I was in somebody's way. The servers' remarks and tone kept getting ruder and ruder. But hey, it's not my fault your restaurant is split across two buildings, forcing you to walk outside, down the sidewalk, and into a neighboring building to deliver food for half the patrons. That's how it is -- you have to deal with that all the time. Don't take it out on me. We waited about 10 minutes -- this whole time there is 1 table right in front of us, fully set and ready to take guests. After all this hassle, I was getting tired of being pushed around so I took a seat at that table, turning the chair around to face the line to make it clear that I wasn't claiming the table, but just using the chair to wait.\\n\\nThis infuriated a passing waitress and she let me know it. That was the last straw. I don't need to be treated like a 5-year-old when I go out to eat. I suggested to my girlfriend that we just leave, and the owner was walking by and heard this. His response? \\"Sorry, that's just the way out policy works here, folks. You can't get in the way of our servers -- you have to wait by the door.\\" Of course, as I pointed out earlier, there wasn't room for a 4th person to stand by the door without getting in the way of the servers running in and outside. So we just left.\\n\\nSo if you don't mind terrible customer service and being treated as nothing more than some loose change found between the sofa cushions, please enjoy the tasty breakfast food here. Ball Square Cafe may have been the inspiration for that notorious soup cook on Seinfeld. If you're a tough guy or just don't care about being treated like you're crashing a private party, you'll have a great time here."},{"name":"Pollo Norte","address":"2935 NE Glisan","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place has the potential to be great if they were able to turn the spice down a notch or two.\\n\\nThe chicken is full of flavor but if you're not\\ninto spicy you have to peel all the skin off to  enjoy your poultry.

Everyone we know who had eaten there raves about it. I have to say, I was disappointed. We did the tasting menu, and it was mediocre. The first course was essentially a beef tartare with thinly shaved turnip. First, it was one of the least visually appealing plates I have ever been served. It reminded me of a specimen from a dissection lab. Just a round mold of tartar with a white-ish, fleshly looking slice of turnip on top. I hoped it would taste better. It did not. I love a tartare, and this was hands down the least flavorful tartare I have ever eaten. It was so completely nondescript and was begging for any type of flavor - salt, acid, anything. Truly disappointing. \\n\\nThe next course was good. I can't exactly remember the preparation, but it was similar to a butter poached cabbage. Very nice. Probably my favorite dish of the night. Visually fine - not good, not bad. It really was a treat. \\n\\nWe had a liver tart as a small bite as we waited for the main course. It was fine. I'm not a huge liver fan, as the after taste is displeasing to me, but it was probably good if you like liver. \\n\\nThe main course was duck two ways - duck breast (traditional preparation), which was quite nice. The second was described as a duck mousse. I bit in and it was more like duck jerky. Extremely tough, salty, and annoying to eat. I did not finish it. We actually told the server that the description did not match what it was and he basically could not have cared less. This is not the attitude expected at a restaurant of this caliber. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ended with an apple tart/pie with hay ice cream. It was very good. No complaints. \\n\\nOverall, I felt underwhelmed by the food. I'm sorry to say that I felt the same about the service. There were several instances of lack of attentiveness. I already mentioned the total indifference regarding the duck. When we originally sat down, we ordered a drink. We had already had a cocktail before arriving, so my husband decided to have a beer. My husband is quite the beer lover, and chose one he was unfamiliar with, but which was described as being something right up his alley. When we both tasted it, it could not have been further from the description. It was basically an IPA, and neither of us are IPA fans. My husband told the server that this was not as described. We fully thought the server would offer to replace it - as would be expected. He did not. He said sorry. He came back a minute later and said he had some of another beer  left over from the night before. My husband took it, but that was a pretty poor attempt at replacing the first beer. The first beer was not removed from the bill, either.  At every course, each plate was dropped off hurriedly, the server quickly said what it was and ran away. There was no time to even ask a question. Very poor indeed. For the dessert course, I was quickly able to question \\"hay?\\" when she said it was hay ice cream. The answer was \\"yes\\" and then off she went. I expected her to provide a little more description/background, since \\"hay\\" ice cream is not common. \\n\\nOverall our experience was not what we had hoped. This certainly, in my opinion, is not one of the finest restaurants in the city. My suggestion is to take your money and eat elsewhere - somewhere with tastier food and which values your business.

The shiitake mushrooms were really sour and delicious with it. \\n\\nThen the assorted sashimi came. We had maguro, otoro, ama-ebi, yellowtail, red snapper and uni.

Do get your parking validated at the front hostess station. You can also choose to valet through St. Regis and walk over. \\n\\nReservations- Use open table. \\n\\nService- Service is excellent and efficient. We ordered the Miyabi which consisted of about 6-7 dishes, however we were in and out of their in a little over an hour. Not to mention our waiter had about 5-6 other tables? Impressive. \\n\\nAmbiance- Lively madhouse. Its a perfect place to go to dinner with friends or family. Not so much for a romantic date night. Too hectic and loud to carry a conversation clearly. \\n\\nFood- Being this was our first visit, we decided to get the miyabi to sample as much as we could. Next time we will probably sit at the bar. Here is what we sampled: \\n\\n1. Rock Shrimp Tempura - Choose to have it served with ponzu sauce on the side or doused in spicy creamy sauce. We were given one of each. Rock Shrimp is popular due to its similar lobster taste and appearance. This dish is famous at Nobu restaurants also (well the one in spicy creamy sauce). The head is the best (with eggs!) part so devour that piece first. \\n\\n2. Spicy Tuna crispy rice-spicy tuna tartare on lightly fried crispy sushi rice with jalape√±o slices. My hubby requested this one to be incorporated into our miyabe. He is very fond of crispy rice (what asian kid isnt- he still scrapes up the crispy rice at the bottom of the rice pot when I cook it on the stove vs the rice cooker lol).If you make this dish at home also, you can substitute the tuna for crawfish for a southern touch. \\n\\n* 3. Madai carpaccio- Japanese red snapper carpaccio with sea salt,lemon, olive oil, and yuzukosho. Refreshing and clean. \\n\\n4. Sashimi Plate - 16 pieces (2 of each) served classically and natural. Due to the yelp word limit I will not be listing them all, however I will mention my favorite was the scallop. I could do without the rest of the offerings. \\n\\n* 5. Samplings of Black Cod Miso yaki-grilled black cod marinated in miso AND Chilean Sea bass Yu-an Yaki 24- grilled chilean sea bass marinated in yu-an sauce. Executed beautifully. Rich, soft, warm, juicy. \\n\\n* 6. Assorted Nigiri - Now this dish, was probably my favorite of the night and the best in regards to combination of plating, creativity, texture, taste, flavor, etc. Once again due to Yelp review word limit I will only mention my favorite 3: \\n   A) Sake Aioli -cured scottish salmon with garlic aioli, lime, and caviar\\n   B)Kobe-beef Nigiri seared kobe-beef nigiri with ponzu, green onion, garlic chips, and yuzu kosho\\n   C)Otoro Caviar -otoro nigiri with truffle soy, serrano slice,cilantro, and caviar \\n\\n* 7. Dessert- A delicate serving of vanilla Souffl√© topped with gold flakes paired with a fresh slice of fig,a frozen rasberry, and a black sesame mochi ball. A lovely and refreshing way to end the meal.\\n\\n* The items I liked/would get again I put a \\" * \\" next to.

So when the bartender found out she immediately walked from around her station to confront me in front of my lady friend about why I didn't leave her a tip,\\" Is there a problem\\"and started giving me this spill about how she only makes $2 and some change per hour. Not even taking into consideration that it's the holidays, I make minimum wage,and inside there with my work clothes on and spent what I made for that whole entire day at work. All of this happened in front of their  manager and the rest of the staff, while they sat behind the bar and laughed and smirked about her comments.

This for sure saved us many trips out there\\n\\nCons:\\nThe food was pretty mediocre not too authentic chinese food\\nNo serving spoons or anything, so we had to serve w/ normal plastic spoons\\n\\n\\nAll in all, I think people are more interested about the quality of the food, hence my rating of this place."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Good experience overall.

The carnitas and other meats are cut right when you order, and the salsa is fresh. In general the burritos are full of flavor but not overly seasoned -- you can clearly taste each ingredient when you bite into it. I ate here 4 times in one weekend because of a competition in Rockwell Cage, and yet I still grabbed an Anna's burrito to go as I was on my way out of Cambridge because I knew I would miss it.\\n\\nIf you're up early, their breakfast burritos are awesome also -- eggs, rice, potatoes, and your choice of either sausage or chorizo, salsa optional.

We actually landed at this pod to visit a different cart, but then something magical happened. As we were walking through the parking lot a tall, skinny girl (who looked like she'd never eaten a burger in her life) approached us, shielded her eyes from the sun and whispered, \\"Hey. Have you been to Cascade Burger yet?\\" At first I was confused because it seemed like a warning. It wasn't. She continued, \\"You have to go. You have to. I come here, like, three times a week. I just can't get enough.\\" I took one look at the dribble of burger grease on her chin and I knew she was serious. She got in her car and drove away (I didn't mention the grease on her chin, I didn't think we knew each other well enough). We quickly ditched our original plans and headed to Cascade Burger; I am so glad we did! \\n\\nI ordered an Epic Burger with mayo, pickles, tomatoes and field greens ... oh, and cheese. Really great cheddar cheese. I figured it would be a small burger (it was only $6!), so we also ordered some fries ($2). The burger was big. Not over-the-top, but a perfectly sized burger. The meat was flavorful and incredibly juicy, and cooked until it was just barely brown all the way through (the way I try to make them at home but never quite can). It was clearly a handmade patty, not a frozen too-round burger. The cheese was melted on and surrounded by crispy greens, freshly sliced tomato, a few pickle slices and a light spread of mayo on a soft, slightly chewy bun. You'll probably think that I'm crazy when I say this, but the burger was actually beautiful. It tasted even better than it looked! \\n\\nIt was one of the best burgers I've ever had. \\n\\nAnd the fries! Hand cut, cooked to an almost crispy brown and salted just right. He also has homemade ketchup. Who does that?! We both ate MORE than enough and our WHOLE MEAL only came to $15. The owner was kind and even recommended that we try a dessert from one of his competitors. \\n\\nThe pod itself is great. They provide seating and shade, the owners are all friendly with each other ... and for some reason there was a large screen TV playing ESPN in the parking lot (which wasn't necessary, really, but if I liked sports I'm sure I would have been thrilled). \\n\\nWe will go back to Cascade Burger ... probably soon!"},{"name":"Minas Grill","address":"2555 Delk Rd, Ste B4","city":"Marietta","stars":"4","text":"This is like a neighborhood restaurant that you find in Brazil.

The service was above average- the waiters didn't hover, and seemed genuinely happy to see guests.  \\n\\nGiven the small space, it can get loud really quickly.  But all in all, not a bad place to bring a few friends.  \\n\\nOn to the food: \\n\\nAppetizer: Fried oysters with tartar sauce- These oysters were on the small side (to be expected if they're fried), and they tasted good- though they seemed to be soaked in the fryer for a bit for too long.  The breading did not have the crispness that I'd expect from fried seafood of any sort.  Score: 3\\n\\n1) Potato gnocchi with spicy Italian sausage, olives & tomato sauce - I only got a taste of this, and it was better than decent- the gnocchi had a perfect texture, and the flavor of the sauce had made its way into it.  The portion however, was WAY TOO small.  Score: 3.5\\n\\n2) Chicken paillard with white beans, broccoli, arugula & lemon - this was my entree- the largest entree among the three of us by FAR.  It's basically a flattened/tenderized, breaded breast of chicken that was pan fried until the breading was crisp, surrounded by large white beans, with the broccoli bathed in the juices hidden underneath the chicken.  The combination works- but it didn't blow me away.  Just decent.  Score: 3.5\\n\\n3) Green garlic pudding-souffle, roasted vegetables & mushrooms - Again...a tiny portion- I felt so bad for my buddy- it wasn't much larger than a side portion you'd get at a Meat 'n Three kind of place.  Of course, Cakes & Ale is not a Southern Kitchen...but exquisite taste and generous portions do not necessarly have to be mutually exclusive....right? :-p The souffle was average, the vegetables were flavored rather nicely.  Score: 3.5\\n\\nDessert: \\"Phatty Cakes\\"- These are basically made of marscapone cheese sandwiched between gingersnap cookies- Like a brownish oreo- but better.  But yea, they're just cookies.  Score: 3\\n\\nThey DO have St. Bernardus ABT 12 on tap...which is a plus for Belgian beer fans...though it's the only good beer they have.  \\n\\nWould I come here again?  Yes, but only with friends who want to go.  I can't frequent these kinds of places too often- can be a bit tough on the wallet if you want to leave with a satisfied stomach.

The manager continued to talk to.other employees about us and again came over and told us had to move due to the fire code. Again,  there were no other people at the bar and it would have been very easy for anyone to get by us.  The bartender then came over and told us that she was told not to serve us any longer.  We are all respectable adults and this was in no way justified. I asked the manager about this and she said that we had had a little to much wine.  We hadn't finished our first glass at this time. The owner then came over and asked us to leave. Unbelievable! !!  After spending over 600.00 in this establishment for the show, to.have the experience end this way is pathetic! \\nI highly recommend this Liz and the Cooking Show.

There server mentioned the chef was from Australia and he says its better than what he's had down under! Next came our main courses: rabbit and strip steak. The rabbit was served with a smoked cremini mushroom ravioli and was yummy. Steak was well cooked and served over crushed fingerling potatoes. Well seasoned and I could barely eat half of it. So my husband happily finished it off for me. We barely had room for dessert, but the night's special was tempting us, so we got a vanilla pound cake with ice cream and berries.

Lol lol OK sorry back to the review. Seriously though this place is damn loud at the weekend. Nothing against loud places but the noises here are just because out of stupidity.\\n\\nSome waitresses are really nice and attentive but some can have attitude too - I really don't understand why such behaviour. \\n\\nFood is alright, they look very unique in terms of presentation but for the price - the taste isn't as good. Portions are small as it is served as tapas style but the taste isn't even as good or interesting. Over the course of my other visits I found their sushi tasteless perhaps on flavor. Smaller mom and pop to-go sushi shops taste better.\\n\\n\\nThis place is more for like drinking. Good prices when compared to a club - this place is good for pre-drinks.

We were on (what we thought was) the early side...probably about 6:15 PM. We were wrong. The place was jam packed and the wait for a table was about 20 minutes. We decided to hold out and during the time we spent waiting, I took stock of the surroundings. The layout is different. When you walk in, there is a longer than wide front room with a very small waiting area to your right and a small bar and a couple high tops to your left. The hostess stand is actually just beyond the entry into the next room ... which features a couple communal tables, a large horseshoe bar and some table seating. Finally there is a third \\"annex\\" in the back, again long and not very wide that has additional seating. The place is shined and glossy, but it's LOUD. That was our first, very distinct impression. You have to speak loudly to be heard. I'm all for the bar experience, but having no quieter space to dine in a more intimate fashion is a little unfortunate.\\n\\nThe menu is limited and features mainly bar staples (nachos, pizza, burgers). From what I can tell, it's a place where a lot of folks bring kids, perhaps because the menu isn't too fussy.\\n\\nAfter the 20 minute wait, we were seated in the second room - the one with the huge bar. The atmosphere wasn't great, just because we wanted something slightly more quiet so we could enjoy conversation, but we made the best of it. Our server was nice enough and quick to come around to take drink orders and eventually the food orders.\\n\\nWe started with the buffalo chicken dip - very good. Flavorful and perfect for two. Had more tortilla chips than were necessary, but appreciated that they didn't skimp. I ordered the steak with mash and green beans for dinner. I ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I yearned for more taste. It lacked punch, but I added a little salt and made due. Bf got the steak tips (basically my dinner, but cut into chunks) with rice pilaf and zucchini / squash \\"noodles\\".

I'm a big fan of seared ahi tuna so it really wasn't hard for me to pick the healthier option. Plus the price wasn't bad for Houston's -- just $15. One of my friends ordered the same thing (her \\"favorite\\"), while the other person ordered the cheeseburger. \\n\\nLove love this salad. First the presentation was just lovely. Heap of salad on one side of the plate -- all fresh chopped mixed greens, chunks of avocado & mango, all mixed with the perfect amount of the cilantro-ginger dressing. And then on the other side of the plate, a row of the seared ahi tuna. So delicious! Every bite was clean, crunchy, and just so fresh-tasting. My friend & I both really enjoyed it. As for the cheeseburger friend, I didn't ask -- I think a cheeseburger is a cheeseburger. \\n\\nI remember going to Houston's a lot during the early to mid-90s ... then J. Alexander's came to town and I switched my loyalties ... it was closer to my house, and at the time -- the prices were slightly better, and salads were included with the meal. The feel & the service were at par with Houston's. Salads are no longer included and I think the prices are about the same. I think we're back to a tie. \\n\\nI'll have to remember to keep Houston's in my consideration list for good places to eat.

The interior isn't as 'fancy' as one would presume of a finer dining French restaurant, but it's cozy. \\n\\nFor appetizers, I've tried their Mussels \\"Le Coze\\" and French Onion Soup. I'm a sucker for mussels - especially the broth - and it did not disappoint. Served with crispy, toasted baguette slices on the side, it was the perfect complement to dip in the white wine and shallot-infused cream sauce afterwards. The French Onion Soup is pretty good - there's a hefty amount of gruyere cheese melted on top, but I'm not the biggest fan of this soup in general. I thought it tasted relatively standard. \\n\\nFor entrees, I've tried the Loup De Mer, sea bass that's placed on top of a citrus emulsion and served with spinach and fingerling potatoes (this is probably one of my favorite dishes I've tried here). The acidity of the citrus balanced perfectly against the sea bass and capers added an extra kick to the dish. I also have tried the Steak Au Poivre and Maine Scallops St. Jacques. I was really looking forward to the Steak Au Poivre, but found the pepper crust on the tenderloins too intense on the palate - it overpowered the dish and the other ingredients didn't really have a chance to shine. The tenderloin itself was tender and well-cooked, but the only caveat was the pepper seasoning. The scallops were tasty as well, pan-seared then placed on a place with asparagus and a white wine nage, but nothing extraordinary like I would've hoped for. Still, a solid dish, but wish there could've been something more. \\n\\nEmployees are always helpful and kind. I visited once for a birthday dinner and upon my waiter finding out, he brought out a complimentary dessert (candle, too!) which was a sweet gesture."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Umi is an upscale, high end restaurant located in the One Buckhead Plaza. Umi offers a wide range of items from hand crafted cocktails, fresh sushi selection, and hot delicious entrees. This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had filled with amazing food, awesome service, and a great environment. \\n\\nAs mentioned, it's located in the One Buckhead Plaza. There's a parking deck but I forgot to ask if they validate parking. There's also valet in front of the St. Regis hotel. \\n\\nI would highly suggest you make a reservation. My bf and I got lucky and were able to be seated at the lounge area by the bar. Those are come first served and a couple just got up as soon as we walked in. This place gets pretty busy during the weekend so I wouldn't chance it if you don't want to wait. \\n\\nInterior design is great! There's a lounge area to the side of the bar and then you have the main dining room and the sushi bar. We came during dinner time and they like to keep the place pretty dim - to set the mood I suppose. The sushi bar is pretty lit up though. The lounge was also fairly dim but not as dim as the dining room. I was actually pretty happy with sitting in the lounge because it was away from the crowd and was just a nicer setting for a date. \\n\\nWe started off with some cocktails. I tried the Lightweight and my bf tried the Kam-No-Kaze. \\n-- The Lightweight definitely lives up to its name. Not a strong drink but has lots of flavors. It's more on the sweet side and it's crafted with perfect snow nigori, lychee, shochu, grapefruit, Ashai super dry. \\n-- The Kami-No-Kaze is Nikka 12yr, Cocchi Americano, Green Chartreuse, Regan's Orange Bitters. Not sure what most of those are but I do know that equals a pretty strong drink. If you like whiskey, this is a pretty good drink to have. \\n\\nNext we had a couple of appetizers: Yellowtail Jalape√±o and Madai Carpaccio\\n-- Yellowtail Jalape√±o is thinly sliced yellowtail with jalape√±o pepper, cilantro, and ponzu sauce. Wow... one of the best things I've ever tasted. The yellowtail is so fresh and so good! It paired really well with the jalape√±o pepper and the cilantro. The jalape√±o wasn't too spicy so it didn't overpower the other things. \\n-- Madai Carpaccio comes with Japanese red snapper carpaccio, sea salt, lemon, olive oil, and yuzukosho. This was also really good. All the items paired really well together. Really fresh snapper that went really well with the yuzukosho on the side. \\n\\nFinally to our entrees: Chilean Sea Bass Yu-An Yaki, Seared Diver Scallops, and Typhoon Roll\\n-- Chilean Sea Bass Yu-An Yaki is grilled Chilean sea bass marinated in Yu-An sauce. This was my favorite dish of the night and probably one of my all time favorite dish in general. The sea bass was cooked perfectly. The sauce it was marinated in was absolutely amazing. I can't stress enough how awesome this dish was. Highly recommended!\\n-- Seared Diver Scallops is cooked in a soy ginger sauce with a toban grill. It came out still cooking in a bowl with the flame underneath. Once you see steam coming through, it's done cooking. I think the scallops were good but not my favorite item of the night compared to everything else. It's a cool item to get and definitely food pic worthy. Presentation was definitely on point.\\n-- Typhoon Roll comes with spicy yellowtail roll topped with yellowtail, salmon, avocado, and jalape√±o. A really good roll. They made sure to pack the roll up and not short you of anything. \\n\\nOverall, I am absolutely in love with this place! Everything I tried was good. No complaints. Service was terrific. They were really knowledgeable about the menu and really attentive. \\nNo sugar coating this but this was probably one of the most expensive meal I've had. With that being said, it was also one of the best meals I've had. You're really paying for quality over quantity here, and Umi offers really high quality ingredients and a staff that knows how to prepare and combine those ingredients really well. Oh, and last time I checked, they had a food score of 97. Highly recommend this place for a special occasion. I can't wait to come back to try this place again~"},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I dine out a lot so the overall experience is important to me.

The lobster Toban-Yaki is a dish that was as fun as it was tasty. The problem was the restaurant was full and we where rushed. I understand the concept of table turns but our waitress actually presented the check and came back to cash it out so fast that I did not have time to leave may card. When I said it was not ready she started clearing more stuff from the table. My dinner guest turned to me and said, \\"I guess we're going somewhere else for desert\\".

It started when I searched for nearby restaurants for lunch since I work near the research park, once I read about their food I had to try it. I ordered a black bean burger and side to go and was nervous because, let's be honest, to go food is often sub-par to in house food (that may due to condensation in the box, cooling, moving around and different flavors coming together - a lot of reasons) but this was not! The burger and side was two meals for me, and that was two super delicious meals! You know that kind of meal, the wow it's like I just got back from vacation because the food was soo good I am relaxed, in a good mood, and have a new view on life! \\nFirst order was with co-workers who ordered salads and were not that impressed but I have to say it's rare that I am impressed by a salad - I am not sure why they weren't impressed because they did not give any details. \\nPlease note that this is a real veggie burger made in-house so it is not a hard, pressed patty that will look like, taste like, or handle like meat. As a veggie I love that because I love veggies, not meat! So for those of you looking for that fresh from the freezer firmness and brown/gray patty this is not the one for you, this is not a meat substitution. *This is hands down my favorite veggie burger in town! Period.*\\nSecond time was with child, who ordered macaroni and cheese with a side of macaroni and cheese. Yes, he loves cheese! We were in house for that visit and the burger was equally good, and my child shed a couple tears stating that this was his favorite macaroni and cheese ever! Some notes about what I like about dining there: 1. It's casual so you can order in line and then eat so you don't have to worry about any staunch, uptight atmosphere. There were no white table clothes or waiters and so no tip or reservation was required. 2. We had fun trying all of their drinks, such as their cupcake lemonade - which believe it or not does taste like a cupcake! 3. They are friendly and easy to talk to, and they know their food! The combo of all of the above is great for someone like me who (sigh!) has food allergies and needs to be careful; I am comfortable discussing what I can/cannot eat and feel confident they aren't lying or making something up.

They had customers, but weren't busy by any means especially for a Friday night. We sat down, and was greeted for drinks, but after that it just went down hill. I'm not a complainer and am a very patient and understanding person, but we were being blatently ignored. She (Kasey according to the receipt) was joking with the bartenders, bar top customers, or just plain old nowhere to be found. She came around eventually to see if we wanted another round of drinks, but then forgot by the time she left. When she remembered, the drinks were pretty tasty! We also had to asked for a menu since they serve food, and she disappeared again. One of the other servers on the floor kept passing by, and finally stopped by our table to see if we wanted to put an order in (THANK YOU! Wish I knew her name). She took our order, and even went out of her way to give us a suggestion for the type of bread for our sandwich, which we appreciated (The Natural was super delicious with the wheat bread!). We were out of drinks again at this point, and our actual server kept passing by us again without checking in. I ended up going up to the bar to ask for another round, and the bartender asked me who our server was. I had to be honest, because at that point I wasn't sure. One gal took our drink order and the other took our food. Turned out our server was the disappearing act gal. She showed up just after I sat down again, and asked if we wanted the drinks I had just asked for. Of course we did. Our food came out and we had asked initially for ranch to dip the tater tots in, but we hadn't received it, so asked again. She forgot again for a bit, but eventually came back with them. At that point, we were again out of drinks and she didn't see if we needed more or water or anything. We were pretty thirsty at this point, but we're just fed up by that point, so just decided to get through the meal to leave. When she decided to show again, we just asked for the bill. She asked if we were doing one bill or splitting, and we asked to split it 50/50. She came back with one bill, and when we looked at it we were charged $1.25 for side dressing and $0.75 for \\"Misc Food\\" twice. When we asked about the \\"Misc Food\\" charges, she said it was for the side dressing, so we pointed out that it was already charged. (By the way, who charges for ranch to dip tots in?) She said she didn't realize it had been charged, so adjusted it off. We left super upset by the whole experience. I guess the point in my long winded story is don't sit in the section just across from the bar if \\"Kasey\\" is working. Even in clear sight, she's too preoccupied to help you.

You have a choice of sides. Sweet potato, regular, salad, or soup. Being able to chose my sides is always a plus in my book. We got one of each. All pretty good.

We've been together for years now, and you'll forever have the gold plate on the wall to remind you of our time together.

If you are going to have people print their own tickets to get their beers recorded, could you please even try to make sure that your beer finder actually reflects your current stock? Having to inform the manager every time I go there gets a little tiresome.\\n\\nNow that I think about it, really, maybe it is you, Flying Saucer. Maybe it's the ever-shrinking and generally awful menu of pre-fabbed foods. Maybe it's the fact that you can't decide whether or not dogs are allowed on your patio, forcing us to come up with a backup plan when planning to visit you. Or maybe it's the fact that your lovely and expansive beer selection is rendered moot if I CAN'T GET A JESUS BLOODY BEER BECAUSE YOUR SERVERS NEVER NOTICE US. \\n\\nSorry about all the caps there, Flying Saucer. I didn't mean to shout just then. Yes, Flying Saucer, this is hard for me, too. But after the fourth time in the past year of walking out on you and going somewhere else because we couldn't get anyone to wait on us, do you know what I've realized, Flying Saucer? We can just go somewhere else in the first place. \\n\\nThat's right, Flying Saucer: if you're going to staff four servers to cover 3,000 square feet and then try to save a few bucks by failing to hire a host/ess to let said servers know that they have customers waiting, I'll just go another few blocks to the Draught House, which, as it turns out, has better Sunday and Monday specials than you, anyway. I do not owe you 15-20 minutes of drinkless boredom while you get your sh*t together.\\n\\nAnd I cannot get around your awful table service, Flying Saucer. Do you know why? Because there are only about six available seats at the whole bar, which are always full, and even there, the bartenders are perpetually making drinks for your clueless servers. It's as if our relationship is one big, vicious cycle, Flying Saucer. And so, Flying Saucer, I'm afraid this is goodbye. We both know it's for the best.\\n\\nP.S. That puerile bint in your corporate office who responded to my email about the beer club by personally insulting me is a real peach, Flying Saucer. Does she write your server training manuals?

The Typhoon was pretty good as well, the cilantro gave it a refreshing flavor, but it did have a little bit of a spice kick for my tastes.  The Bara roll was very simple, traditional and fresh with a ton of black and red tobiki.   His unagi was pretty big portion wise compared to the unagi I have seen him get elsewhere.  \\n\\nI am not one who wants constant attention while I dine, but I do want one check-in after the food arrives of \\"how is everything.\\"  This did not happen.

It had gone off of my radar until a friend turned me on to Jack Allen's a couple of years ago.\\n\\nThe Menu: The interesting thing is that I recall thinking the menu was rather mundane before I had visited the restaurant much. After a few visits, though, I was hooked. The chicken fried chicken is the best I've ever had. It tastes as good the next day. I have no idea what kind of alchemy that took. The 13 spiced chicken is another favorite, but you may want to ask them to take it easy on the jalapenos because a couple of times they've overpowered the delicate flavor balance. I've tried all of the other chicken frieds on the menu, and the chicken is by far the best in my opinion, but don't take my word for it. See the happy hour section below for info on the appetizers.\\n\\nThe Happy Hour: Super busy, but half priced apps. I can't think of many places where I could make a delicious meal out of the appetizer section on a menu, but this is one. The pork belly (BLT) sliders are delicious (though lately the buns have been a bit on the greasy/buttery side). The guacamole is fantastic! They add a nice touch with the pumpkin seeds. The salsa isn't a HH special, but do yourself a favor and try it. The wholesome blend of herbs and spices is unique and delicious. The barbacoa stackers are good. \\n\\nTips for when it's busy: It's a big place so don't be surprised if the 45 minute wait ends up being half that. You can grab a spot at the outside bar if you don't want to wait for a table (people are always getting up to take their seats). The bartenders are nice and they are happy to serve you food. If it's packed, you can avoid the main parking lot altogether and park at the office complex on the other side of the Sonic."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We were told the wait time would be 30-45 minutes. Over 60 minutes later and we're still waiting... we decided to ask the hostess how much longer she thinks the wait will be since it was 2:30 and they would be closing at 3. She literally said, \\"Our iPad ran out of battery so I've been charging it. As soon as it starts up again, I'll be able to seat you guys.\\" 10 minutes later, we're seated at a 4-seated table for 6 people... Our server definitely needed more serving experience. She was very socially awkward and unprofessional. Coffees were brought out without cream and the sugar packet holder was completely empty. Not to mention that up until our entrees was already brought out, we only had 3 wrapped utensils. I can't believe we had to bring it to the server's attention that we didn't have enough utensils and that we needed cream/sugar. \\n\\nIt was a bad experience at first but as soon as the food came out, everything was ok.

As I looked up the ceiling has a long red cape (hence the name, cape in Spanish for the bullfighter's cape that he/she takes off in the third act of la corrida.) Capa has six Chaquetillas (the top portion of the bullfighters traje de luces).  This is not to judge the morality of a bullfight but to acknowledge a custom going back to the Phoenicians.  Besides if your hung up on bullfighting and meat why are you at a steakhouse ?   \\n\\nI went to Capa for thanksgiving so the reader is cautioned about the review.  \\n\\nWe started our first Tercio with drinks and traditional Spanish taps. We had the pan con tomate and detailes.  They were great and authentic. Although I will take exception to the stingy amount of stuffed dates.  El Mercado this was not.  \\n\\nWe then had the traditional turkey meal plate.  It was great.   The cranberries were to die for and the turkey moist. We had it all with a Syrah from E. Guigal Chateauneuf-du-Pape.  I commented to the sommelier how we had been near this vineyard.  I knew this wine was good with game and we chose it. \\n\\nAfter the final tercio we walked outside with the Syrah and watched the fireworks over the Magic Kingdom at 1000; so plan accordingly as the view is magnificent.  \\n\\nAt the end I had my Jake moment (from the Sun Also Rises) and paid the bill.  I even mentioned the book to the table as Hemingway's finest novel. \\n\\nMy major issue was the portion and the prices. Stingy and exorbitant.  But then again it's not the reason you come here.

Highly, highly recommended. The fisherman soup is magical."},{"name":"Brioso Coffee","address":"53 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"So I thought it was A-OK.\\n\\nMost of the people who rave about Caf√© Brioso seem to mention the coffee first, and that might be part of why I didn't love and adore it, but it's not the only reason. It's because they came very close to making my heart soar twice while I was here, only to let me down in the end.\\n\\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, the wonderful smell slaps you in the face as soon as you walk in the door. How lovely and welcoming! There's a big coffee station right next to the front door that just may have been put there for that reason, or maybe for the same reason the produce is put by the entrance of most supermarkets -- to get the taste buds prepped through their buddies, the nostrils and eyeballs.\\n\\nThere were separate spots for ordering food and drinks, and then you get rung up at the latter. As a newcomer, I found that a bit confusing, and I can only imagine it becomes more so on a busy downtown weekday (I came on a Saturday), but it may just be a fresh-made-food place's equivalent of \\"Can I get you something from the case?\\"\\n\\n(If that reference doesn't translate to anyone but me: Sometimes you'll be at a coffeehouse where the line for the single register is wrapping around tables and practically [or literally] leads out the door, so to speed up the process, the work is divided between pre-order people who will get you your bagel or muffin while you're waiting to order your coffee and the post-order drink people. Perhaps having separate ordering stations is kinda like that but, y'know, with sandwiches and soups instead of stuff \\"from the case.\\")\\n\\nAt the drink station, I encountered my first almost-win. I asked about tea options, and the staff member pointed me to a nearby display with about six or eight loose leaf teas in itty bitty jars. Yay! Very likely-to-be-good teas! I made my choice, the barista headed over to make it, and quickly returned. \\"I'm sorry, we're out of tea filters. Would you like iced tea instead?\\"\\n\\n*Sigh.* He did everything right in the imaginary customer service textbook that I just made up: apologize, offer alternative. But really? Out of tea filters? How often do ya run out of critical coffee accessories, Caf√© Brioso? The iced tea was great -- definitely better than most iced tea -- and it was actually the iced version of the gunpowder I was going to have hot. But letdown. Sadface.\\n\\nHeading toward the tables with my cup of iced tea to wait for my sandwich, I spotted almost-win number two: a small table in a corner simply surrounded by outlets! Outlet oasis. Outlet mecca. Of course, I don't need more than one, but it was like this table was calling me. I happily started setting the laptop up (my sandwich arrived while I was doing so -- nice, fast food service, though it *was* an off-peak time). Plugged in, turned on... and was surprised to see the laptop do that dimmy thing it does when it's just realized it's now running off the battery. Huh? Sure enough, the outlet wasn't outletting. Tried one on the other side -- not working there either. Darnit! The outlets were a lie! Six doodads to plug stuff into and every one a lie.\\n\\nI could see another one near the couch, which I'm going to believe would have worked, but the time on my parking meter was going to be barely longer than the laptop battery life anyway, so I stayed put and buried my frustration in a veggie sandwich (with nice wheat bread, fresh-tasting ingredients, and the option to have it with or without cheese).\\n\\nSide note: I didn't try very hard to get wifi while there because the work I was doing didn't need it, but it appeared to need a password. So if you *do* need to use it, don't forget to ask.\\n\\nSo yes, I can see what people love about Caf√© Brioso, and I will happily give it more tries. I'm sure the supposed fabulosity of the coffee helps coffee drinkers forgive any similar shortcomings they might otherwise notice (whether from the flavor or the caffeine or some other bliss drug they slip into the formula). But for now I don't see myself proclaiming myself a fan, and for my needs it's certainly not as good as it gets."},{"name":"Denny's","address":"2320 S Interregional","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Seriously?

I can't even stress how much I love this place - I live and work in the area and go there often for dinner and lunch. Sometimes the service can be a bit spotty, but they always get it together in the end and the food is good enough to let it slide. I also chose to tolerate the fact that a) they stopped serving yakitori at lunch and b) their sushi chef walked out recently and they have been unable to serve sushi the last few times I went. Today, however, the service issue was beyond the pale. I have been there many times, yet am never received with any particular warmth (I tip well). Today was no different in this respect, except that in addition to the usual somewhat blank reception I received, the guy waiter who always waits on me (tall skinny guy) and the middle aged lady who clearly runs the show proceeded to have a heated debate while I stood there for several minutes. It was obvious that they were arguing about whether it was too late to serve me lunch (it was about 1:40; they close at 2). The waiter seemed to be lobbying for me to be allowed to eat and he eventually won. I sat down and immediately ordered to speed things along, which the waiter seemed to appreciate. After 10 minutes, another server came by and gave me a menu. I explained I had already ordered. Another 5 minutes went by and the waiter came back and asked me if I had gotten my salad yet - I had not, and he went and got it. All of this flakiness and slowness are par for the course, but like I said, no big deal given how great the food is, so I didn't really think anything of it. Another 5 minutes passed and he brought me my tonkatusu ramen, which looked great, as usual. I went to tuck in and found the pork to be ice cold. I called the waiter over and he told me that's how it is supposed to be, which is crap - I have eaten this dish there and elsewhere many times, and this is simply not true. I told him this and another argument ensued between he and the lady in charge, but he eventually took the bowl away and then came back a few minutes later with the bowl with no pork in it and said they would heat the pork and bring it over. About one minute later he came back with a tiny bowl with seriously about 1/5 as much pork in it, microwaved to within an inch of its life. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and asked him if that was all of the pork. He said yes  - I asked if he was kidding me and at this point the lady in charge came over too. They said there was still pork in the bowl of noodles (I poked around to show them that this was not the case), and then tried to tell me this was the same size portion as had been on there when it was cold and that I had somehow misunderstood something. I reminded them I had eaten there many times, and that all of this was BS, and they kept arguing with me. At this point I regret that I basically lost it, told them off, and stormed out. It was just so unbelievable. I am gutted to have to take this place off my local roster, but I don't see what choice I have - I could never go back to a place where I was treated so rudely. I have heard that they are generally ruder to western customers, a phenomenon I am familiar with from years of dining at Umezono (also recently stricken from my local roster due to their horrible service attitude, and also at great pain to me because I love that place). I worked at a Japanese company for several years and hence am pretty familiar with Japanese culture - I like to think that this makes me a respectful customer who isn't expecting a western style dining experience. I am also well aware that many Japanese people do look down their noses at Westerners and have encountered this problem at some places in the past (and been with Japanese colleagues who were embarrassed and apologetic). I hate to think that one of my favorite local places suffers from this, but sadly I think it may be the case. If I am in the wrong here and truly did \\"misunderstand\\" something, I would really like to know. From my perspective, I waited patiently for a bowl of food that came out bearing an alarming and unacceptable (not to mention potentially unsanitary) combination of temperatures, politely asked for the situation to be rectified, was argued with and told I did not understand how the dish I had ordered was served - which I damn well do - and then the problem was \\"solved\\" in a completely unacceptable manner which resulted in a huge reduction in portion size and me being argued with yet again and told I did not know what I was talking about. The worst thing about this - and again this reminds me of Umezono - is the feeling that the folks at this restaurant could not give less of a crap how I felt or if I ever go back there. No, the worst thing is never again eating that awesome ramen and delicious yakitori, but the fact that they don't care is a close second."},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Had chili (mild) cheese baked potato.

The overall portions are pretty filling, like what you usually get at Chipotle, mainly because it's like half rice or noodles. The food is actually pretty tasty, nothing to complain about there, especially if you get their Magic sauce- stuff's good. \\nOne important thing to note is they don't take cash, although that's pretty well-known about all Chi'Lantro locations. What I was shocked at is they don't take Apple pay or any kind of mobile pay app, which I prefer over paying with card, so I was disappointed.

What a great way to start off a client dinner at a place we ranted and raved about.\\n\\nOur server was awesome and did his best to cover for the early embarrassment.  Our bill was over $500, and I cannot believe that wasn't worth the apparent $5 in laundry costs to put a linen on the one table out of the four we were occupying.  I don't know if the experienced managers are up in Round Rock trying to help with the opening of that location, but this was a very unimpressive trip to one of my previously favorite restaurants in Austin.\\n\\n11/20 UPDATE:  Very impressed by JAK general manager Shannon's follow up responses to my experience.

We were informed that they recently had a grease fire in the kitchen that has caused a limited menu. Today they did have grill options but you may want to give them a week or so to get that fixed before going. My co workers and I ended up getting chicken tenders, steak sandwiches, and the burger. They did not have BBQ sauce for the chicken, only ketchup, ranch, honey mustard. The burger I was told was ok but nothing mind blowing. The bacon on the burger was thick cut and looked delicious. The steak sandwich I got was disappointing. At $12, mine only had 4 small slices of steak and you couldn't really taste it. The arugula on it was nice over lettuce and it comes with a fried egg. It was more of a chewy egg and salad sandwich than what I think a steak sandwich should be. We did mention it to our waitress who said she would talk to the chef, so maybe try again later to see if they improve it. All of our dishes come with house made potato chips which were ok but didn't have any salt nor a lot of flavor. I opted for fries instead which were an upcharge that I was surprised about, but they were really fresh, tasty, and might be some of my favorite in downtown.They do have a poutine dish on the menu that I really want to try as its something you just can't find anywhere but the northeast and in Canada.\\n\\nThe theme and atmosphere were enjoyable and the seating was comfortable. The waitresses were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. They are probably the reason I bumped it to 3 stars instead of 2.

The menu prices are a bit pricey but mostly on par with surrounding restaurants. Their drink menu had a lot of choices but was more expensive than most of the bars around.\\n\\nAs it stands, the Dapper Duck does not really have anything that makes me want to stop in instead of heading to the Pour House next door, or Avenue across the street.

I had dinner here with some friends last night before a concert and it was amazing.  \\n\\nFirst of all, when you walk into the restaurant, no matter from which door you enter, it's eye-catching.  The bar area has great chandeliers and sconces that look almost like giant heads of garlic and cornucopias.  The walls are papered with wine bottle labels from various different companies and vineyards.  The bar itself is pretty impressive, with fully stocked shelves and jars of fruit-infused vodka, and there's a giant wood-fired oven at the back, from which delicious-looking pizzas and roasted dishes emerge.  The hostess was very friendly and escorted us to our table in the main dining room after a short wait at the podium.  \\n\\nOur server was very friendly and patient with our indecisiveness over drinks.  The place was pretty busy for a Wednesday evening, but she remained calm and collected.  After mulling over our drink order, we finally moved on to the dinner menu, only to be completely stumped by what we should order.  The menu is extensive and very well thought out.  I've always been impressed by the thought and detail that goes into each dish on the menu, and this particular Fall menu was probably one of the best I've seen since I began coming here three years ago.  \\n\\nWe all ordered a mixture of entrees, appetizers, and salads.  Everyone tried a little bit of everyone else's dinner, and I have to say that there wasn't one plate on that table that I found lacking.  Each dish was very well balanced with flavors and seasoning, and the ingredients were harmonious together, which is something I appreciate above all else.  \\n\\nI ordered the Italian Spring Rolls, which were filled with anise-scented pork sausage and served with provolone fondue and marinara as dipping sauces, as well as the Pear and Gorgonzola Salad, which was served with delectably roasted, gorgonzola-stuffed pear halves and thinly sliced Prosciutto de Parma.  Although I was more than satisfied with my ordering decisions, I had ultimate entree-envy when my friend's dinner of Roasted Duck with Duck Confit Ravioli was placed in front of him.  I stole a bite of the ravioli and can honestly say that I almost blacked out from pure, gustatory bliss.  \\n\\nThe waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  Our particular server was very helpful when she offered to give us the check so we wouldn't be late for the 7:30 concert I had mentioned in my reservation on OpenTable.com.  \\n\\nI highly recommend Rustic Kitchen for their inventive and tasty menu offerings, professional and attentive service, and astounding decor."},{"name":"Shut Up and Eat","address":"3848 SE Gladstone St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"GREAT FOOD!!

Yum!\\n- Fried Turnip Cake - luscious pureed Chinese turnips steamed into a cake and then pan fried.  A Chinese favorite in most dim sum houses but even better here!\\n- Fried Taro Cake - similar to the Turnip Cake but with taro root instead.  Bits of taro throughout makes this one of my favorites.\\n- Bean Curd Skin Roll - this is a must order!

We asked one of the waiters and confirmed that this place is a club on weekends, which explains the long bar, the large speakers, the plastic chairs, and the (faux?) marble finish. There was also a large Buddha statue and some bright blue lights on top of the stairs leading down to the bathrooms and a lounge-looking area. The bathrooms were also awkward, with large, one-way mirrors on the doors of each stall. Everything just struck me as kind of tacky.\\n\\nThe food was decent. We had garlic, sun-dried tomato, and ginger and honey naan with several different types of chutney. We also had the lamb curry and the pork tenderloin. Everything was just average. I ordered the curry mild because I have a very low threshold for spiciness, but it didn't really taste like anything other than salty. I was very disappointed since I'm usually a big fan of curries. The only thing I really enjoyed was the tomato and coconut soup.\\n\\nThe service, while not overtly BAD, was rather unpleasant. Our waitress was nice enough, attentive, and recommended several dishes to us, but she just seemed kind of awkward. She hovered around our table a lot and seemed rather forgetful. For example, she put our chutneys down on the table, realized she'd forgotten a spoon for one of the chutneys, and then came back with a single spoon. Then she brought out a dinner dish with dirty spots on it, widened her eyes, and then mumbled and hurried back with another one. When she brought out our entrees, she put them all an empty corner of the table (we had a party of three), farthest from where anyone was sitting.

The egg custard and the hot black tea is just simply amazing!!! We love it so much!! I think the portion of the set is quite generous as we were able to share but then maybe we were also already a bit full.  The bill is already calculated with 10 percent tips included.

It has all the decor, style, and ambience of any other suburban Marriott.  The rooms are furnished accordingly and are maintained fairly well.  The executive lounge has a reasonable variety.  Housekeeping and the front desk staff are all efficient and courteous (at least the ones I met were).  The location is great if you are working up in the Perimeter area north of Atlanta:  It's never more than a 5-10 minute drive anywhere.  \\n\\nMy one biggest gripe is that the Atlanta Marriott Perimeter Center is situated right behind the I-285 highway AND the MARTA train line.  The MARTA seems to run every 3 minutes and all night long.  There also is a continuous rumble 24/7 from the incredibly busy highway that is literally a couple hundred yards away.  If you do stay here, make sure to get a room on the even-numbered side as they face away from the MARTA and I-285.\\n\\nOverall I give the Atlanta Marriott Perimeter Center 3 out of 5 stars.  It's a decent hotel located near most businesses operating out of Atlanta.

Bottles of wine were dirt-cheap for restaurant prices - cheaper than ordering by the glass! - and they had a great selection.  We tried two reds, both delicious, both $10 off.  We basically sampled all of the appetizers, which were also half off.  I would like to list a favorite, but they were honestly great.  I don't even like mac and cheese that much, but it was ridiculously good.  That truffle oil...The chicken nachos were also delicious, and the gorgonzola and honey crostini was a table favorite.  Best part?  Two bottles of wine, probably 8-10 shared plates, and the tab came to $80-something bucks (before tip).  For four people.  At a wine bar.  Amazing!  \\n\\nHighly recommended for a nice double-date spot, meeting up with the girls for wine and conversation, or just a mellow happy hour.

We ordered some beef bulgogi street skewers and they were bursting with flavor! We each ordered different plates, I got Hokkien Mee and it as also very tasty. Soy sauce is also provided upon request. Now, if you're used to getting full after dinner this place isn't for you as it is a tapa style restaurant. I will say though for me, paying $9 for a small portion was a little high in my eyes.

We went on a Saturday afternoon. After ordering a Brisket Platter, I mentioned to the young guy taking my order that I prefer the moist portion of the brisket. The only reason I know that, is because I venture to 4 Rivers often, and they provide the option of both - lean or moist. After receiving my Brisket platter, I soon discovered that the brisket was not only cold (yuck), but very lean and hard to chew. I smothered it in BBQ sauce, hoping it would help, but it was to no avail! I approached the woman wearing the white coat behind the counter, because she looked like she was in charge. After I kindly mentioned that I had asked for the moist end of the brisket, she sarcastically replied \\"so you want fat?\\" I shrugged off her rudeness and continued to ask for a hot, moist piece of BBQ - because I was after all, at a BBQ joint. She became very aggressive and rude, threw my tray back at me and said \\"that's all we got.\\" She then offered a refund, and was not only rude to me, but rude to my husband as well! \\n\\nOverall, completely appalled by my experience at this location - mainly, the customer service. We paid nearly $30 for lunch for two, and if you're going to support your community, your community should be supporting you! 4 Rivers will likely have a longer wait, but the BBQ is far better than Harry & Larry's - hold the attitude."},{"name":"Chi'Lantro","address":"11005 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Oh man is there food good.

There weren't any straws, and so then it took him forever to find those. I asked the lady who helped him find the straws for a refund, because it was now half an hour ago that I'd ordered. She said yes and then disappeared to the back, and the girl at the cash register gave me a refund, calling me \\"hon\\"/\\"sweetie\\" in the process. I truly appreciate my money back.

Low and behold, I found my second 5-star review in this little place in Orlando.  I tried Laska here for the first time after hearing about how great it is in Malaysia and it was fantastic...  A little spicy with curry and coconut, the broth is a little more gritty than pho but the noodles are about the same in texture.  The \\"Char Kway Teo\\" was good and I loved the slightly burnt noodles to give it some texture and taste.  The Ginger Chicken wasn't anything I expected, the ginger sauce was like a mix of Pesto with thin ginger strips giving it a nice but it didn't have a overbearing ginger taste.  \\n\\nThe dishes are served tapas style with slightly smaller portions but I think that works out better cause it encourages you to try different ones.  I especially liked that fact that each dish tasted distinctively different, which can't be said for most Asian food you find in restaurants.  Its a subtle difference that goes a long way in taste and quality of the food.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the \\"Royal Pairing\\" or the King and Queen of Fruits, Durian and Mangosteen.  Durian is the smelly fruit that is suppose to taste heavenly.  I had never smelled nor tasted the fruit.  I kept sniffing the durian in the spoon but couldn't really pick up any foul smell to it.  I had also never tried Mangosteen, which I thought was somehow related to a Mango, though a quick google search revealed it looks nothing like a mango... more like a giant lychee looking fruit.  The dessert was great and I liked it.  Served creme brulee style was unique but may be my only complaint, it was a little too sweet, I would have preferred just the fruits itself, but that's just me...\\n\\nThe service was excellent and the decor was a unique open area with a small outdoor area, its not what I expected just by looking at the exterior of the restaurant, but I think it also summarizes my review, they managed to excel and exceed all of my expectations, which is why I think it deserved 5 stars."},{"name":"K Restaurant","address":"100 Lynn St","city":"Peabody","stars":"5","text":"As others have mentioned, you place your order on a tablet, pay by credit card and take a table.

The inside definitely has a nice vibe to it with all decor, lighting, furniture and etc.  The restaurant can also seat ~24 people (they have 12, two person tables) and we didn't have to wait for a table when we went for dinner.  The staff was very friendly and helpful; they were always checking in on us to how we were enjoying our meal.  \\n\\nEven though the interior and decor is very modern, the dishes are as authentic as you can get - love how well they balance each other out!  \\n\\nDrinks:\\n-Thai Iced Tea: not too sweet and you could really taste the tea in it, which is fantastic since the sweetness usually overpowers it, but not here! \\n\\nAppetizers/Salads:\\n-Homemade steamed pork dumplings: smaller than expected, but they weren't over or under-cooked.  They were full of flavor, which is complemented well with the ginger sauce. \\n(x)-Papaya salad (Som Tum): SPICY!!!  A lot spicier than other Som Tum I've had so it started getting painful after a while.  Flavors were fantastic, but the spiciness definitely overpowered the dish to the point where it became less and less enjoyable.  So if you can really take spicy, then go for it, but if not, then I wouldn't recommend it.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n-Pad See Ew w/ Duck: the flat rice noodles were perfectly cooked (I've never had these noodles cooked so well before!) and the sweet black bean sauce was the just the right balance of sweet and salty.  The duck was also very well prepared, but their was an unusual amount of fat in the dish, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but overall a great dish!\\n-Khao Soi: this curry-based noodle soup was very light and not as spicy as I expected.  The delicious curry was definitely more soupy, which makes sense, and the thin noodles were cooked perfectly (they are noodle masters or something).\\n\\nOverall, very pleasant experience here and would give them 4-4.5 stars!  Service, atmosphere, authenticity, dishes, and price were all on point!

The entree that we picked (Miso bass, Scallops, Rock shrimp) were somewhat on the salty side, but was still really delicious. The sashimi was all really fresh, especially the scallops and wagyu beef.

We knew it had a great view.. thought it would be fun, etc.\\n\\nAll three of us were majorly disappointed. MAJORLY. It was one of those moments, when the food finally arrives, and you take a few bites, and you try to pretend like it's all right, and then you look around at each other, eat a few more bites, think about how each entree cost about 40 bucks, and realize that you've just been ensnared in the biggest TOURIST TRAP in all of PDX!!\\n\\nSave yourself the agony.

They took our drink orders, a coffee and a diet coke, and left us to enjoy the pleasant Austin air. Left us for quite a while, in fact. We were actually kind of giddy planning our meals. So many choices, all of which carried the faint whiff of danger in the sense that they were likely a little too ambitious for a kitchen of this sort. Still, this promised to be interesting. \\n\\nEventually, the trainee came out with my coffee and seemed puzzled that the coffee had arrived prior to the diet coke. So, off she went, returning shortly with the drink. Again, we were left to ourselves to take in the air for a good ten minutes before the waiter returned to take our order. This gave me time to take a sip of the coffee. I am not one to make faces. I made a face. The coffee was amazing in that it was thin and acidic and horribly burned at the same time. I took another sip because there's no way the coffee tasted like that. Only, it did. \\n\\nThe waiter took our order and afterward, I asked him if he could brew up a fresh pot of coffee as this was \\"the most unfortunate cup of coffee I'd ever tasted.\\" He shrugged slightly, telling me that the trainee had in fact made it fresh and while he could make another pot, it would taste pretty much like this. \\"Maybe we just have bad coffee\\" were his words. I think we can safely scratch the \\"maybe\\" part. I asked him for a glass of water and he wandered off into the night.\\n\\nAfter fifteen minutes, our enthusiasm for this enterprise waning, we considered a wager. Which would arrive first: Our appetizer, our silverware and napkins, or my water? My date didn't hesitate in picking the appetizer and I had to agree that it seemed the most likely. The trainee brought the appetizer out ten minutes later and we had to ask her for the silverware, napkins, and water. The combo consisted of crab dip, popcorn shrimp, and \\"great balls of fire.\\" The crab dip was decent, although the top had the thick skin of an item that had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. The poor little popcorn shrimp were fried beyond much shrimpiness, but that was to be expected. The \\"great balls of fire\\" were quite miraculous. They apparently were breaded balls of cream cheese, shrimp, and jalapeno and yet they had no discernible taste whatsoever. Nothing. \\n\\nWe were still working on the appetizer when the entrees arrived. My date had the shrimp trio, which consisted of fried coconut shrimp, grilled shrimp with a mango slaw, and crab-stuffed shrimp. The hope, I think, was that one of the three would be a tasty treat. One look at the plate dashed that poor, little hope. We're talking TV dinner quality here. The shrimp was overcooked, but that was to be expected. The mango slaw was kind of insulting and the crab stuffing was the stuff, if not nightmares, then at least tummy troubles.\\n\\nMy dinner fared somewhat better. I got the \\"Old Bay\\" steam pot, which was a pot with a dozen clams, 8 king crab claws, a link of sausage, an ear of corn, and some potato-y looking things. My first impression was that they'd managed to over-steam the entire mess, which is more impressive than just over-baking or over-frying. The clams looked dry and kind of shredded. The crab claws were washed out, small, and two of 'em were missing. I'm not going to try to describe the sausage. I started with the clams because they were less work. They tasted briny and, well, I guess that's about it. Dipped in butter, they tasted buttery, which was an improvement. The crab legs were the highlight of the meal. They were actually fairly tasty and the only thing that I ate that managed to exceed the low expectations we had.\\n\\nThe trainee came by during the meal and asked how everything was and all I could say was \\"perfectly adequate.\\" Yes, it was a lie, but please understand how far I have to be pushed to give any answer other than \\"succulent and delicious.\\". Before he took my card, though, the waitstaff came out to sing \\"Happy Birthday\\" to a girl at the table next to us. They made her wear a cowboy hat and \\"ride\\" a broom while they sang. I think this girl's friends must hate her. \\n\\nHere's the moral: Going to a mediocre chain restaurant doesn't have to be horrible, but never, ever, ever pick a place that tries to be \\"fun.\\" Joe's isn't about food. They're selling an experience. It's  sort of like Jimmy Buffett in this sense. With Buffett, the music is almost beside the point. He can get a zillion people to come out to his shows because there's a giant party and the music is just sort of an afterthought. \\n\\nSo yeah, in retrospect, the sign said it all: Life is too long to live like this."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Atlanta.

It was complemented exceptionally well by the TONS of fresh fruit piled high atop as well as hefty dollops of whipped cream.  If it isn't apparent by now, the portion was most generous and the same was true for the omelettes.  I didn't get a chance to try them, but my friends said they all enjoyed their dishes.\\n\\nAs for ambiance and service, both got the job done.  Despite the minimal square footage, BSC's seating arrangement made it feel much more spacious than I expected.  I'd also note that one of the younger waitresses was a bit too obvious with her little stink eye when my group split the check with several credit cards.

Last night I ordered the salmon pizza, usually delicious with smoked salmon, goat cheese and capers.  However, it died before it ever got to the table, baking under the heat lamps.

For $5, I also got a large sized caesar salad (lettuce was fresh). \\n\\nI didn't give it 5 stars because I felt that there was a little something missing- maybe a little salt or a spice or two would have sealed the deal.

The atmosphere is elegantly casual. They did a great job on the interior decorating; I especially like the huge fireplace and the French casement windows like restaurants in the North End . The bar is very beautifully designed. There is a flat screen TV for sports fans and an extensive drink list. The food is delicious. Every single time we've eaten here we've been 100% satisfied. You definitely get your moneys worth here with large portions. You can count on the food to be consistent. In some places you can order the same thing a few times and depending on who the chef is that day it comes out different, but not so with the BHT......we order the steak tips and they are perfect every single time. Cooked exactly the way we ordered. Tender and juicy and the made-from-scratch-marinade is delicious! The pizza is by far the best around. I am very particular about my pizza (I'm not easy to please) and now this is my # 1 spot. I recommend the mashed potatoes, the rice pilaf, and the steamed broccoli with any meal you order because they are all cooked to perfection and well seasoned. (it is a rare treat to have broccoli cooked properly- usually restaurants either undercook or overcook it but BHT gets it right). The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable. The waitress we had last week clearly explained the specials without having to look at her notes. In some restaurants the waitstaff comes to your table every 5 min wanting to know if everything is ok, which I find annoying. Sometimes its the opposite, you never see them once the food comes. Each time we've eaten at BHT (about 8 times now) our waiters have been attentive but not hovering. Parking is on the street but we've always found a spot. If you take the Commuter Rail it is literally at the station so it's very convenient to stop in after work. All in all, I give Black Horse Tavern a 5 star vote."},{"name":"Chicken and Rice Guys","address":"81 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"What can i say..

Actually, that's pretty unfair because that was some pretty amazing complimentary kimchi.  For those of you who like to make impromptu sandwiches with your BBQ, consider adding the kimchi.  Being more of a purist, I ate the beef cheeks on their lonesome, and they were just as tasty as they looked.  That said, I probably preferred the pork ribs, but I'm from Alabama, and this could just mean I miss my home state dearly.  In any event, while they weren't especially meaty, the flavor was great.  I would hard pass on the boudin though.   The sides weren't especially memorable on this visit with the cheesy squash probably being my favorite.  At least they are trying something different.

They've got this awesome trailer with a bunch of fryers on it that sits outside and they just cook it up all night long.

And let me tell you, I left quite angry. To start, I arrived around 6pm and the wait was only 15 min. Probably because it's winter so there's less people in Boston (also, I believe school is on break). I was pretty excited to not have to wait, I also felt very lucky!! (Happy customer). Got a seat at the bar and kept having to flag our waiter down to order. We finally order.. Got the lobster roll (hot), oysters, crab bisque and a beer. We see our beer, sitting there ... We ask ourselves .. When is he gonna bring our beer over? So we purposely watch our beer sit and wait to see how long this man will take to bring it over. Of course, he finally brings it over (10 min later?) .. Now we turn into a bit of disgruntled customers.. We get our oysters, 2 are missing from the list that we ordered from. We tell a nearby waiter (since ours gives us no attention), and he apologizes and gets us our 2 missing oysters. Soup came out luke warm. I think it had been sitting there a while. Lobster roll was on point. I'd say there's at least 2-3 lobsters in just one roll. It's loaded. We also had to flag our waiter down for bread. It was really annoying. He seemed to hate his job or not want to be there... I felt like I was working for his attention! Anyway, the bill comes and I see that they charged me the 2 extra oysters (when I had told them I was missing 2, not ordering an extra 2). It was only $6 and I don't typically complain or make a fuss over 6 bucks. But because of the below average service, I had to say something. I was really hoping for a good experience since I been dying to go back to Boston just for neptunes. And this waiter totally ruined my experience. Tuna (servers name), if you don't like your job, go somewhere else. We all have a bad day, but please don't take it out on your customers. This is just bad business for the business!

I've got to say that it's one of the most consistent restaurants in town.  We've been there for family events, happy hours, holidays, birthdays, with out-of-town guests,  and just 'cause we were driving by.  When a relative was in ICU nearby we practically lived there between visitations for couple of weeks. The staff even signed a get well card for him (we took him there often)!  We were there for their first Holiday Ale (A barley wine-style ale, we dubbed \\"Christmas Crack\\" because it was strong and tasted so good you just wanted more) and every Holiday Ale since. In all the years we've been coming to NXNW (some years we were there at least once a week) we've only had two meals that weren't outstanding--they were just okay.  Both times they were slammed so we cut them a break.  We take most out-of-town guests there and they always look forward to returning when they come back to town. I grew up in the Midwest on corn-fed beef and NXNW is one of the few places in Austin I'll order a steak--Their tenderloin is a favorite. Whether it's a burger, a salad, a pizza, a steak, pasta or one of their many great appetizers, NXNW always comes up at the top of our list for great food, local brews. It's real food made there (not shipped in on a truck and re-heated) and we usually see the chef coming out of the kitchen once or twice an evening serving guests.  We've had most of the dishes on their menu. I won't go on and review each one--there are so many stand outs--but the Skillet Fried Corn Bread is so good it should be illegal! Okay, so the Lemon Shrimp Linguine is also wonderful, as is the Sirlon Salad, and the Calamari.  My husband won't even eat Calamari anywhere else--all the others being rubbery and tasteless.  The Py Jingo Ale is our favorite, next to the Christmas Ale and a few other seasonals.  I've seen a few people posting here say their food was bland, but I would disagree.

Did you want to try out the Spirit of Boston so you can experience how it might feel like to sail out into the sunset while eating and dancing through the night (or in this case between the hours of 7-10pm)? Do you also enjoy airport lines and airplane food? If your answer is YES to the above 3 questions, then this cruise is right for you =D\\n\\nThis cruise leaves at exactly 7pm (there are other times available) be sure to arrive at least 30-40 minutes early for boarding. Upon arrival they file you into a line, check you in, take your photo (for memory purpose and to make more money off you later) and have you walk down a wooden ramp and up onto the boat. When you get inside, the hostess will ask for your name and seat you. Your waitress then comes to take your drink order (they have a full bar) and brings you a bowl of bread while you wait for the rest of the guests to arrive. \\n\\nAs soon as the clock strikes 7 the DJ/Host cranks up the corky cruise music, welcomes the guest and begins dinner service (or in my case the buffet which includes: chicken, prime rib, 2 pastas, salad and fruits). And after dinner, the dancing begins (or continue eating, the buffet stays open for ~1.5 hours)! But if you prefer neither eating or dancing you can also explore the boat, they have plenty of outdoor seating, but I found it to be pointless because it got so cold and windy that siting outside was a little bit unbearable. When dinner service was finally over, they serve dessert (a slice of cheesecake and a chocolate covered swirly thing that reminded me of cow turd).  \\n\\nAlthough the food was mediocre and the drinks were average, the night view of the city was amazing. I had a great overall experience. It was fun corky and romantic! \\n\\nOne final tip for the ladies:  The stairs on the boat has these sharp rigid grooves  to prevent slipping but can do some serious damage to your heels (opt for wedges or something you won't mind scraping up)."},{"name":"Mezza Luna","address":"1669 Spring Rd SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4.5","text":"The food quality was good, BUT the meals are WAY overpriced, and the portions are undersized, and without ANY garnish, NOT EVEN a side salad. Our experience was even more interesting. 1. Each place setting contained two forks of the same type, either two dinner forks OR two salad forks, per setting. The wait staff does not seem know the difference. And, by extension this means that the management doesn't know the difference between forks. 2. Both of my forks and my plate were dirty. Given the price of our meals, it would seem that the understanding of place setting, etiquette and presentation would be within their grasp.

I'm certainly going to try it other places now, though I'm doubtful any place can top Canoe in this respect.\\n\\nMy date had the duck which she mightily enjoyed, saved for a couple center pieces that were way undercooked. Mmmm, raw poultry! The veggie crepe wasn't anything special to either of us.\\n\\nThe chocolate grotto as a finishing dessert was superb as well.

For not particularly catering to native Asian customers the food is actually quite good.  Clean and courteous, Golden Buddha refreshingly stays away from the ridiculous marketing schemes and pretension many Vinings Oriental Restaurants adopt.  Here they proudly serve tasty dishes that are mostly familiar Americanized Chinese staples, with some Thai, Malaysian, and even Korean noodles thrown in for good measure.  \\n\\nI was told that the lo mein came to the restaurant in packages and ready to serve just by heating.  This apparently in no way results in bad noodles as I found the lo mein very tasty with generous amount of meat toppings.  In fact, I found generous meat/seafood toppings to be one of the noticeable pleasantries here.  The sauces are all too predictably sweet, but not unpalatable at all...something aspiring Americanized Chinese restaurateurs can learn a thing or two from.    \\n\\nNot a place to make a trip to, but certainly puts some non self-respecting brethren of the consciously commercial order to shame.

I recently bought a BuyWithMe coupon, and we decided to try RK. I made an Open Table reservation, got the coupon and got on the T (Arlington stop). \\n\\nWe were seated in a lovely little booth that was a half circle built into the back wall. It was a touch difficult to slide up and into, however. If I was a large lady, it might have proved impossible. The cave decor is kinda cute, it reminds me a bit of Ned Devine's with a brick oven.\\n\\nThe drink menu looked creative, and so I ordered both a red sangria and later on, a Blueberry Lemonade. They tasted good but weren't as strong as I would have liked. We started off with the precursory focaccia that came with a white bean dip and what seemed like a tomato sauce dip. The white bean was the better of the two. The Italian spring rolls were a good choice at $13. The crispy rolls were piping hot and filled with provolone and sausage.\\n\\nMy BF had the stuffed lobster tail entree which came on a big, deep fried potato cake. A bit too greasy. He thought there may have been crab in the stuffing but wasn't sure what was in there amidst the cheese and the breading. \\n\\nMy lobster risotto fared better, but didn't feel like a true risotto, as the rice was leaning a bit more towards the al dente side of the pasta/grain meter. The lobster chunks were good, though not as plentiful as I would have liked. Sweet corn kernels complimented the dish. The next day for lunch, I found several fatty bits of bacon in the risotto, which I found just a little confusing. I hadn't tasted any of it, and it wasn't listed on the menu.\\n\\nEverything was okay until we tried to use the BuyWithMe certificate. Our waitress immediately came back and asked us for the voucher number. Having only used BWM twice before for Dante, I was confused. No one at Dante had asked me for a voucher number on either occasion. The waitress explained that she couldn't use the voucher as payment without the number, even though it was nowhere on the paper. She then asked me if there was a phone number I could call on the paper to get it. There was a number, but since it was after business hours, no one answered. I even tried the merchant option in addition to the customer service option. Sigh. I don't currently have a smart phone, so I couldn't sign into my BWM account to check it out.\\n\\nShe brought out another BWE voucher used by a previous customer, and showed me where the number was located. Strangely, it was printed above the outline of the certificate. And nowhere in the fine print does it state that you have to have a number. I've given BWM feedback on this. \\n\\nSince this was a $50 chunk of check at stake, I asked if there was a computer I could use. She left to ask and returned to say no. I thought for a moment, then asked if I could call her once I got home and signed into my BWM account. She acquiesced, and I did just that. A few days later, the charge is for the correct amount, and all is good. I'm glad that we were able to come to this solution, because I may not have returned otherwise."},{"name":"Denny's","address":"2320 S Interregional","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"What terrible service!!!

I wasn't hard up, but the offer was hard to beat, so I decided to take him up on it. \\n\\nHe took a firm stance that the traditional Bratwurst was succulent, and enough to fill him up.

Our server asked me if I was okay with it being really hot, and after answering in the affirmative, she warned me again that it'd be super spicy and wanted to make sure I didn't get shafted with something I couldn't handle. This did not rub me the wrong way at all, as it built up anticipation that I'd be getting something powerful.\\n\\nAnd yes, it was hot and hit the right spots. Unlike my table mate that finished a bit prematurely, I took my time working on this sausage as the spiciness required occasional breaks for sips of beer between bites.

Well, I wasn't  looking for a second family last night- i just wanted some pizza. One might think Via Tribunale would be just the spot. Now, one might think again. Don't worry if you're not that hungry when you arrive. There will be plenty of time for that. Our waitress breezed over to the table with an air of total competence which, in the wrong hands, can be a very dangerous thing. Throughout the evening, we got to see her  on occasion and as the intervals increased, I actually kind of missed her and hoped she would write more often. She and the bartender were able to showcase a very unusual feature of the restaurant- Cocktail Preview. This is apparently a system via which, after your drinks are prepared, they are left to sit on the bar for 5-10 minutes where , if the conversation slows, one can gaze over at the beverages and watch the ice melt. \\n\\nSalads finally arrived- now we're talkin'- just as the drinks were moved over to the final evaporation area near the pizza oven. The next sighting of our waitress resulted in a very very special treat indeed. To top off my Ceasar, she offered the highly prized and rarely dispensed \\"fresh ground pepper\\" from a curiously tall wooden instrument. Her pride was obvious. I understand that if you order ahead, you can get this on both your  salad AND your pizza ! At this point, Miss Can Do apparently went on sabbatical as the pizza orders were placed in a bottle and tossed in the Willamette. I then had the great pleasure of watching the bartender ( small shirt, small pants, hipster hair and too-cool-for school attitude ) work his magic, shaking a tini over his head, pouring, then casually popping a couple of pills in his mouth ( I am not kidding about this ). In vain, I prayed they were Adderall.\\n\\nIf you get to sit in the front of Via Tribunale, as we did, you can inhale the combined fumes of pizza from the restaurant and the Voodoo Donuts next door, successfully recreating the exact smell of the Wisconsin State Fair. Perhaps the Tribunale family would consider adding curly fries to the menu to round out the carb-stink ?\\n\\nPIZZA TIME- I was so excited. I thought I had asked for  the Margarita, but apparently my order was mixed up with a pie called Lovers' Mattress- crusty around the edges with a big wet spot in the middle. Never mind. By this time we were so hungry we were nibbling on the coasters. Fresh ground pepper expense here is apparently balanced by saving on paper products, as Via Tribunale adheres to the one table, one paper napkin principle.\\n\\nThe check finally arrived and I made the mistake of presenting one of those on-line coupons which resulted in 2 or 3 subsequent bill revisions and a lot of fuzzy math.\\n\\nIt is my understanding that Via Tribunales' claim to authenticity is twofold. It uses wood fired ovens from Naples and the restaurant's owners are Italian. Might I suggest that next time they are in the country, they consider a staff meeting. God knows there is plenty of dead wood to fire and, incidentally, I know where they can get some killer donuts."},{"name":"North By Northwest Restaurant & Brewery - Stonelake","address":"10010 Capital Of Tx Hwy N","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been many times to nxnw and today I came to the realization that nxnw does no longer value customer experience.

We chose to sit in the bar area at one of the small tables. The place we sat at was perfect as we had a direct view of a number of TVs and the large bar. We waited awhile for service so we ended up ordering our first round of drinks from the bar. No big deal yet. A kettle one dirty martini for me, a maker's mark on the rocks for the dad and a glass of pinot noir (Soul Sister's) for the mom. All of the drinks were quite good. A server ended up coming over (a bit too late) and we ordered our food. The mom and I split the Chicken Quesadilla and the Roasted Vegetable Flat Bread. The dad got the blackened fish tacos with a cup of the white bean soup. All of us were thrilled with the food. It's pretty much better quality bar food. We waited awhile to receive plates, napkins, and silverware and the additional drinks took quite too long. The server kept saying it was very busy for a Sunday. I didn't see that so I assume they were understaffed. I do believe the prices were a little too high for what the items were, especially with the poor service. I would return and probably sit at the actual bar as the bartender seemed to be on her game. Not a bad place at all if service would improve. I love the vibe of the bar as people were cheering on some NFL. Come if you wish. You will enjoy the drinks and food!"},{"name":"Ichi 28 Teriyaki","address":"4804 NE Parkway Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Good place to eat. My family occasionally go there for teriyaki.

One of my pet peeves is making reservations and having to wait   And extra 30 mins or so. We decided to wait out side since the front lounge was full. A gentleman saw us waiting and invited us to a secret lounge area a couple places down from UMI.  We sat down ordered drinks and the drinks itself took about 15 mins to make.. I had gotten a text message that our table was ready right before the drinks came. I had ordered a drink that had vodka and infused pear and truffle oil. It was a delicious drink, just the truffle oil threw me off, I seriously thought the guy next to me had bad B.O or something.\\n\\nSo we sat down at our table at UMI and ordered immediately... This is what we ordered.\\n\\nMiso soup- basic, but it was really good because I was starving at this point.\\n\\nSalad- skimped on the ginger dressing so I only ate the top layer with the dressing.\\n\\nFoi grois- my first time having foi grois and I liked it. They seared and the outside had a nice crust but the inside was fatty. \\n\\nBaked Lobster Tempura- the sauce that layed over the tempura was just too much and over powering. I had to scrape off the sauce just to eat the lobster tempura.\\n\\nCrunchy Lobster box- similar to the baked lobster tempura just with rice. Was kinda tired of the same taste so we didn't eat that much of it.\\n\\nMiso cod- one of my favorite dishes. I liked that this cod was not as fatty as some miso cods I've had before. \\n\\nNigiri (hamachi, sweet shrimp and yellow jack) - truthfully, I wasn't impressed but then again it's just nigiri...\\n\\nOtoro caviar- I was expecting this one to blow my mind but I was t a fan because of the truffle oil again. About 3 of my dishes through out the whole night plus my cocktail drink had truffle oil in it. I was so over it.\\n\\nSake aoili- it's just salmon with caviar on top..\\n\\nKobe beef nigiri- one probably my favorite out of them all\\n\\nBlood orange sorbet- a good way to end the night with something refreshing\\n\\nSesame ice cream (on the house)- even tho it was free, I did not like the ice cream. It wasn't sweet at all.\\n\\nChocolate sphere- looks cool, probably something you should try on your first time here. And make sure you \\"reserve\\" one... They only make 10 a night or something like that. It sits on a green tea sauce, so I think that's the only reason why I liked the dessert."},{"name":"Tamale House East","address":"1707 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"1) lots of parking\\n2) interesting spot since it looks like a house with a long front driveway (parking lot)\\n3) friendly service\\n4) love the outdoor seating\\n5) tried a few tacos : #1 (bacon, egg, potatoes, cheese) was okay.

The hubs joke that I should never expect much for ambience from ethnic restaurants, which is true. As long as the food is good...\\n\\nAnd the food was great! The hubs & I shared the non-vegetarian dinner for 2 ($30). It was a LOT of food: chicken pakora, chicken soups (spicy), shrimp & spinach, goat curry, naan, rice. It was a great deal for that much food. Everything was flavored well and had good spice to it. All of our friends enjoyed their dinner selections too. \\n\\nService was fantastic as well. The waiter joked about my friend who kept needing his water refilled. \\"You like water, huh? Do you like the food too?\\" He was very friendly and fast.

It's Asian fusion, which is great because I enjoy Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese... they have all kinds of dishes from these regions, and it's nice that they are served small-plate style (like tapas).\\n\\nThe idea here is to reproduce the (best) food from Asian street vendors and serve it up in a manner where you can share your dishes with your group. (but you don't have to). In practice, I tend to order more than I need, but, also in practice, I still manage to finish everything. \\n\\nTheir beer list is very good, and they just recently updated their menu. Now it's not just a list, but they have helpful explanations of the origins of each beer they offer. My last trip there, I ordered the Red Brick Blonde Ale, which I highly recommend on hot summer days.\\n\\nBy the way, eating outside on their patio area during a midsummer Florida day is not recommended because it's not covered. However, we had our corgi with us so we really didn't have much choice. Fortunately, one of the girls there was super nice and fetched us an umbrella. \\n\\nThe inside of Hawkers is a neat gastropub type atmosphere. The biggest problem here is parking - there's just not enough of it. (If their lot is full, I recommend just parking on the side of Mills somewhere). Fortunately, we live within walking distance to Hawkers so it's not a major deal. \\n\\nMy favorite dishes at Hawkers are: the Roti Canai, Five spice fish tacos, roast duck tacos, wings (with oriental jerk seasoning), the Yow Choy (kale) and the Bok Choy. But I haven't had a dish I didn't like yet... By the way, the prices here are extremely reasonable! I was surprised at how cheap the bill was after all the food.\\n\\nFinal tip: check in on Yelp and get a free order of spring rolls!"},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Anytime we're in Austin we make an effort to stop at gourmands and have a sandwich.

And they have outdoor seating. \\n\\nCame here with 2 friends and split an orders of tomato rustica, the pumpkin ravioli, fettuccine w/ lamb ragu, linguine w/ clams in white win and garlic sauce, and the lasagna (4 entrees and an appetizer. We also got the chickpea tomato soup as well as the free in house bread.\\n\\nLets just put it out there. The bread is free and AMAZING. you just need to ask for it. \\n\\nOverall, the food was pretty good here.Our three favorite dishes were definitely \\n1. linguine w/ Lamb Ragu\\n2. tomato rustica\\n3. lasagna\\n\\n the linguine w/ lamb ragu was especially tasty, not too salty, not under seasoned, and Oh My God, the lamb was slow cooked into heavenly goodness. It just about melted into meaty goodness in my mouth when i bit into it. It was moist, and had just enough lambiness without it being overpowering.\\n\\nThe tomato rustica was a pleasant surprise. We initially got it as a substitute for bruschetta (which Saba surprisingly does not have). The rustica is marinara sauce topped with goat cheese and (i think) a bit of pesto. The goat cheese and marinara sauce definitely complemented each other very well. It was sweet, salty, savory all at the same time. We definitely went through 3 bread baskets just eating the rustica. \\n\\nThe lasagna was was a pretty big portion (as all the other portions are here). It practically melted in my mouth. It wasn't burned, had plenty of cheese and bolognese sauce. One of my friends thought it was a bit too salty. I didn't think so.\\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was definitely the pumpkin ravioli. The raviolis were kinda tough, and they weren't really that big. They were not plump with filling, and the filling itself could have definitely used a bit more seasoning. Overall, the weakest of all the entrees that we tried. \\n\\nThe soup was interesting to say the least. If you think it's just going to be a tomato soup with chickpeas in it, you would be mistaken. The flavor is definitely unique. I definitely enjoyed using it as a dipping sauce with the bread.\\n\\nThe white clam sauce contained a lot of clams, but it was definitely under seasoned and very... plain tasting. Nothing really \\"popped\\" at me when i ate it. \\n\\nIn the end, I would definitely come here again. I would definitely get a bowl of soup (or 2 different cups of soup), or the tomato rustica and just dip the bread in it. Or if I felt like splurging, I would get the lasagna or the lamb ragu (with which I could dip the delicious bread into). \\n\\nDefinitely worth the money.

When I say food I specifically mean the Mexican. Other than Mexico, I think California is authentic as it gets, but Habanero comes close.  When people think of burritos and tacos people think Chicken, Beef, or Pork.  But for those who are daring and courageous, you would ask yourself what would locals eat in Mexico, so I asked (when I lived in California).  Answer I got was Al Pastor (Pork on a rotating spit, like Sharwma), Lengua (Beef tongue), and Tripas (Intestine).  Yes, I know I'm going outside of the norm of say Taco Bell.  Trust me after a long night of drinking and huge appetite anything is good. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong I still order the spicy carnitas and carne asada once in awhile, but when it comes to Habanero, lengua taco's all day!! I typically order 3 lengua taco's then an Al Pastor Torta, which is like a Mexican Sub/Sanwhich that comes with chips and salsa and if that doesn't cut it, I order a taco or two more (yeah I can eat). Sadly, this place or anyplace around Boston that I know of don't have Tripas. This small restaurant has food that is just so authentic here and can satisfy my Mexican cravings.  They offer more than just burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. They have authentic soups and rice plates that I see locals ordering all the time, sadly haven't had the chance to try, but it's on my to eat list.  \\n\\nI'm giving it 4 stars because 5 is reserved for the taco truck!"},{"name":"Stella Public House","address":"1905 Aldrich St, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Looks good, sounds good... isn't good.

He made us want to come back...soon.\\n\\nIt's ashame there's not one of these in San Diego because I would love to be back to a place like this, often.  Hands down, 5 stars plus some if I could.  \\n\\nThank you Banger's for making Austin worth while."},{"name":"Kaya Restaurant","address":"1924 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Went for weekday lunch time. One of the nicest days out but of course the patio here was still mangled in wires. From the outside .. this place looks like it could belong in the desert somewhere. Villa style in Porter Square. It's nice. Interior is huge.. with spacious seating.. darken wood.. closed off rooms with rice paper screens to shut yourself in. Nice natural light coming through. The feel of the place gave me positive vibes.. enough for me to go back for dinner with a party of 7. 7. That's right, 7. Who;s in?\\n\\nWe were the only ones there the entire time so that was sort of very zombie Porter Square like.. waitress/hostess lady was quick and all about business.\\n\\nEnd result: Sashimi was fresh, Tofu with the O.G concoction of soysauce, vinegar, sesame seeds and red pepper was standard, and the garden salad was served packaged style with orange slices of course. The highlight was probably when we ate tuna in booger mucus goo. That was called Tuna sashimi over Graded yam. Yam my ass. \\n\\nSo yeah.. anyways I guess by writing this review I've become one of those jerks who ate basically no Korean food at a Korean resataurant and gave it 3 stars anyway. Dammit."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went to Banger's with my wife and 4 other friends...  I wasn't planning on going here within the first few days of opening, but after seeing all the great reviews I figured I'd give it a try.  \\n\\nWe expected a fairly long wait (it was about an hour) so no complaints there.  While waiting, we got to check out the beer selection.  Although impressive, I was pretty surprised at the cost;  Whip-in and Draught House carry many of the same beers for a dollar or two less per pint/snifter/etc.  A lot of the stronger beers were about $7-$8 per 8 oz. pour (I've yet to see a bar in Austin that will charge that high for an un-cellared or not particularly rare brew).  \\n\\nOnce seated, we were surprised to see that the food was pretty reasonably priced after seeing sky-high prices on the beer menu.  I had the currywurst, my wife had the bratwurst, and my friends all got their own dishes which included some of the sides.  The currywurst was pretty dry and unimpressive, but I may be biased after eating at Salt & TIme at the Hope Farmer's market (best currywurst ever).  My wife thought her bratwurst was ok, but the creamed corn and pickled veggies were good.  The only issue that anyone else had w/ the food were the fries.  They tasted great, but a $5 side of fries was ridiculously small.  We did have great and attentive service that brought some more out, but no-one was very impressed with their meal (that stuck out to me since our group contained a farmer that supplies local restaurants, three homebrewers, and a few others that just like to eat).\\n\\nI know the place won't be swamped like it has been on opening week, so seating won't be an issue like it was tonight.  However, after seeing all these great reviews I expected some excellent food.  The reason I was skeptical in the first place was the ambitious amount of sausage and beer they're offering.   While leaving the restaurant, I just wasn't that impressed with Banger's.  I'm sure they'll improve as the restaurant gets up and running, but frankly there are plenty of Austin restaurants that do it better.  The \\"Quality not Quantity\\" principle strikes again; check out Easy Tiger or Whip-in for reasonable beer prices and better food."},{"name":"Houston's Restaurant","address":"3321 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Parking is complimentary and the staff inside was very friendly.\\nFood was great, me and my hubby both ordered the veggie burger which is made out of brown rice, black beans, jalape√±os (no not spicy)and many other things.
