My companion has some allergies, namely onions and iceberg lettuce, so we asked what was on the wraps. The girl seemed confused at the questions, and as we proceeded to order, she continued to act confused.  We both ordered a lamb kebab wrap with white sauce (tzatziki) only.  I also wanted to try just the beef kebab so I ordered that ala carte.  The cashier girl, who had trouble understanding that we wanted the lamb KEBAB WRAP (we had to repeat it a few times), asked if I wanted the beef kebab as a wrap or over rice--I told her neither--just on the side and pointed to the side of the menu that listed the ala carte items.  She gave me a look and then punched a button on the cash register. And then I ordered hummus and extra pita.  Even the request for extra pita seemed to throw her!  Maybe she was new, but no one was supervising her or came to help when clearly we kept having to repeat things to her. \\n\\nSo we didn't have to wait too long and got our order.  But while we were waiting, I looked at the receipt and saw she had charged us for the beef kebab over rice! That's a $5 difference between a meal and just extra kebab.  :(\\n\\nSo when we got our meal, I checked things out before we left (we ordered to go). No kebab over rice.  Just kebab--as I had ordered but hadn't paid for.  So while the gentleman at the front did correct it (by giving me rice), the fact that 1) he acted like it was my fault, and 2) it was such an ordeal to order doesn't make me want to come back too quickly to give it a second chance.  \\n\\nThe food was pretty good--but not the best. The lamb was really good compared to some other places (Sarah's Med was always gristly and tough). The wrap itself was huge which was great especially for the price. But the tzatziki sauce tasted off. The hummus was ok (183 Grill has much much better! And with excellent customer service to match!). Halal Bros put some sort of spicy red oil on top of the hummus too--I'm just a plain Jane olive oil on my hummus type, so I didn't like it overall.  The rice was good--almost a dessert rice because of the spices in it (but not worth $5!!). \\n\\nSo. The best thing was the generous chunks of tasty lamb in my wrap.  The worst was a really bad first (and likely last) impression given by bad customer service."},{"name":"N&P Saigon Subs","address":"1185 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"4.5","text":"Great grilled pork banh mi, first time patron.

I ordered a stuffed blue cheese and bacon burger and while the burger itself was fairly tasty, it was pretty well overdone. I ordered it medium and it came medium well to well. Unfortunately it made the burger pretty dry overall. Big Dig Fries were very disappointing -- the cheese and bacon was insufficient and looked like barely any was used. Not what one expects for a $10 order of fries. Finally, the fried Snickers bar that we split was absolutely disgusting. The wrapper seemed like wonton wrapping or something instead of cake batter that many places uses for fried sweets. The result was a hard, chewy, thick casing that was tough to cut into. Neither of us could finish the dessert because it was so gross and so tough.\\n\\nThe burger might have been better if on site and I think perhaps the same could be said of the cold, chewy fries (and of course, the lack of toppings would have been addressed immediately).

I say \\"Yes.\\"  She comes back with one glass of water.  When I ask for a second one, she seems mildly annoyed with that request.

The waitress comes back and we tell her our orders, including one alcoholic beverage.

I am not sure if they take reservations. When your table is ready you get a text message. When you go back up to the front they will hand you a sheet where you will write everyone's shoe size and/or if they need socks. Then they will deliver these to your lane. Instead of regular plastic seats, they have chesterfield couches. This makes bowling a LOT more comfortable and it makes the place look more stylish. Once seated you will have wait staff that will get your drink/food orders. \\n\\nIf you need to wait for a lane don't worry, there is plenty to do.

I'll discuss later.\\n\\nI fear this will be a hostile review because I'm angry with FLIP.  I wanted to like it so I came with very modest expectations for mediocrity, which were not met or exceeded in most areas. \\n\\nThe space is nice but not inviting.  I got over it.\\n\\nWe were seated after a reasonable wait but there were at least five empty table tops by that time and some had been empty for ten minutes or more.  They weren't seating anyone and were effectively sending people away by telling newcomers that the wait was 90 minutes.  There were issues with kitchen back-up, despite a horde of people in the kitchen.\\n\\nWe sat in one of the fun-looking booths, got our menus, were not informed of the burger of the day, and were approached by our server.  He apologized for the wait (nice) but warned us that the kitchen was backed up so we couldn't put in our entr√©e orders yet as they wanted to space things out. They sat us because they didn't want to make us stand around any longer.  Umm...OK?  He then began making excuses for the poor service we were about to receive and flippantly said, \\"Well, we've only been open less than a week so there will be some back-up. Ha ha\\".  Yes, we KNOW, but this explanation was weird.  He told us to order drinks now, as well as sides, and then order entrees later.  This seemed OK since I was starving so we ordered sides and drinks (the sides came out SUPER fast - 3 minutes - before we even received water) but later I was annoyed when I saw other people getting their burgers with their sides, well, on the side.\\n\\nThe fries were decent, the onion rings were quite good (very crispy), the fried rutabaga had no flavor and were a waste of calories and table space (I think they just needed salt) and the sweet potato tots were OK.  I thought it was fine that the tots were softer on the inside - I like cooked sweet potatoes.  What I didn't think was fine was how greasy they were.  Yes, I know they are fried and, quite frankly, I like some grease.  But, I had one bite of a tot and it tasted like it was all grease - the grease was just floating around in my mouth.  And, a single tot left a puddle of grease on my plate.  That's just too greasy.  I did really enjoy the blue cheese foam.\\n\\nFor our party of five, we ordered a total of eight burgers.  Being a non-eater of red meat, I was only able to try four of them.  I ordered the Codfish burger as my main course.  It was a ground up fish burger but looked like fish and chips on a bun (seemed like a whole piece of cod) with malt vinegar, tartar sauce and pea shoots on it.  In a word, it was terrible.  The fish was remarkably bland (again, no salt, and no salt on the table, either, for me to fix it) and the malt vinegar/tartar sauce combo was not enough to salvage it.  I couldn't finish it and was forced to try and give it away.  The receiver of the fish was not pleased with me.\\n\\nI also tried the Po Boyger (pretty good), the Turkey burger (OK but somewhat flavorless - the avocado foam flavor completely disappeared when eating the burger), and the burger of the day, the falafel.  The first bite of the falafel was very good (it was the hottest of the burgers I tried by far) but when it cooled down just a little bit, it was bland and became very mushy.  I like a grainier falafel texture and this one did not have it.  Additionally, I would've ordered this as my main entr√©e (and avoided that codpiece nightmare) if our Flipster (flippant hipster server) had bothered to inform us of the burger of the day.  But, he didn't - he actually recommended the Codfish :(  In general, I'm not sure about foams on burgers - they seem to lose their flavor when consumed as part of a burger.\\n\\nThen, the milkshakes.  My Krispy Kreme was good but I didn't love the effect of the liquid nitrogen on top.  The top of the milkshake was very crusty, and when stirred, it had the appearance of ice cream left in my freezer too long.  Then, I tried Angela's pistachio shake.  Oh, good lord.  I love pistachio but the flavor was drowned by this horrible chemical burnt plastic flavor.  Awful.  When we told the Flipster, he flippantly said he didn't know how that could happen (no apologies and he seemed to not believe us).  And later, after we'd paid and tipped, he asked for feedback (he said he cared) and we finally decided to point out that there were two small pieces of metal shard in one of the milkshakes (not in any way excusable).  The Flipster again did not apologize, said he didn't know how that could happen and acted like he didn't believe us (bad because we clearly were not trying to get something free and felt bad giving this feedback).\\n\\nI wanted to like FLIP but found little to entice me to return.

The tasty coffee was presented as self serve, which worked out very well considering that we were only a few feet away from the pot.\\n\\nThe eggs Benedict was served exactly the way I always hope it should be, with runny yolks, great ham, and just enough hollandaise to get some with every bite.  The English muffin was whole wheat, and probably the weakest link for that reason (it doesn't take to sauce as well, you see).  Although the hash browns were very, very salty, they were also deliciously peppery and shaped in a way that emphasized the \\"browns\\" part of the deal.\\n\\nOur sandwich-eater seemed happy with her sandwich, which looked nice and cost all of $6, but the final verdict on the scramble was that the choice of vegetables didn't quite work  for a scramble (though the chorizo was delicious).\\n\\nInside, Navarre chooses simple over flashy, and the cookbooks on the shelves lend the feeling that we were stepping into someone's kitchen rather than just taking up a table at a restaurant.  If I ran a restaurant, this is probably what it would look like, though maybe I'd go somewhere other than IKEA for the chairs.\\n\\nNavarre gives me the great vibe that even if an individual dish isn't quite perfect, the next dish will probably be great.  Please don't let a gem like this sit empty during prime brunch hours.\\n\\nI would love to try it for dinner, and will have to figure out how to do so next time I'm in Portland."},{"name":"Eddie V's Prime Seafood","address":"9400 B Arboretum Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I love coming here.

We personally go with the cheddar cheese fondue, with a beer base it's such a classic.

When it comes to the salads my husband loves the house with its quasi honey mustard tangy dressing and I prefer the strawberry pecan. Make sure you get the garlic and wine seasoning (we keep it on our table and season our entrees with it as well). Additionally you can change out which chocolates you want with each type. My fave cookies and cream with substituted white chocolate... nom nom nom. I'm salivating just thinking of it. Feel free to ask for recommendations and get refreshers on cook times from the staff.

Today, we finally managed to get a reservation and all I can say is: This place is undoubtedly worth the wait.\\n\\nUnpretentious French cuisine, featuring simple, fresh, regional ingredients, executed to perfection, all the way down to the French Fries. Everything, including the barely medium-sized but well-arranged wine list, is very reasonably priced. I had scallops as an appetizer, which came nicely plated inside the shell, gratined with a mild Gruyere blend, which accentuated the flavour of the scallops surprisingly well. For the entree, I had the Filet Mignon, which was unfortunately a little on the rare side (I ordered medium), but a very high quality cut of beef, nicely seasoned and perfectly paired with a simple potato gratin. I finished with the lemon tart, on which even the crust was an experience (very likely the best I've ever had). With a mid-priced bottle of wine and aperitifs for everyone, the bill came to $215 (before tip) altogether for four diners and a three-course meal, which is well below any French restaurant I've been to in this city.\\n\\nThe bottom line: Make your reservations now, even if the next free table is three weeks away.

I went with the lemon meyer and keylime curd and I also tried the maple bacon. Personally I don't get the bacon on doughnuts craze, but this one was pretty tasty.

Suffice to say I brought my donut skepticism to Blue Star, only stopping at the establishment simply because of its proximity to Lardo. We picked out one passion fruit, one valrhona chocolate from what I consider a rather sparse selection. The texture of the donuts are surprisingly soft with a very gentle chew, quite different from the typical donut. No, not all fresh donuts are this delicious. The passion fruit glaze is tart and mildly sweet, with a crumble topping. The dark valrhona chocolate is smooth and decadent, also with crunchy bits.

I know what I like and when I am able to get out, I appreciate knowing full well that I will enjoy the food and the experience. Therefore, I end up eating a lot of the same foods at a lot of the same places, especially when I am out on my own.\\n\\nSo it was a stretch when I was driving through the Polaris area around lunchtime and noticed an Indian restaurant that I had never noticed before. I checked the reviews and they were mostly positive. I noticed on the Yelp app that they had a 15% discount with a check-in and I had a craving for a different type of ethnic food, so I went for it. I did not want the typical sandwich, salad, pizza, or other fast food on this day. It was a Thursday and late for a lunch.\\n\\nWhen I walked in, I was invited to a table by the host immediately. I was sat down and I mentioned to him that I was going to have the lunch buffet. He said okay. Since I was not sure if I should go up to get some food right away (maybe that's just my ignorance about the buffet etiquette in sit-down restaurants), so I waited a few minutes. Someone brought me ice water and I told him I was going to eat at the buffet and he said I could go get some food. No direction or anything, which was disappointing. Again, I am not aware of the lunch buffet culture, but I would've preferred some instruction.\\n\\nI walked up to the buffet and looked around. Luckily, a server or host was nearby to ask a question. I asked him which foods were vegetarian and he pointed out that the entire left half (from where I was standing) were vegetarian dishes. Not being picky at all, I took some of each. However, ignorance again, I didn't know how each dish worked. Some looked like sauces - was I supposed to cover rice with them? I had to wing it. The server or host also pointed out that they had two soups, one of which was vegetarian. So lots of options! I also noticed a salad bar where the soups and plates were.\\n\\nEverything I ate there was at least decent, most of it was really good. I only tried one thing I think that was just decent and not really good. I was impressed by the range of flavor, which had been my (limited) experience at other Indian restaurants. There was spicy, not so spicy, but so much that I wanted to keep eating. The foods at the buffet were each marked, but I did not know what most of the words meant. So I just took a little of everything. Two trips to the buffet were enough to fill me up! The server brought pita bread to the table which I dipped into some of the sauce-like dishes that I had from the buffet (I also utilized the rice option in the same way). The server also kept my water filled consistently, which I appreciate.\\n\\nAt the end of my meal, I went to pay and show the host my Yelp app, but he immediately told me that the discount is not applicable on the buffet. It would've been nice to know that ahead of time. I give it 4/5 stars not because of this slight miscommunication, but because I really enjoyed the food, but would've appreciated more direction on how everything worked and what each food was.\\n\\nI think I would go here again, but I didn't love it enough to rush back. If nothing else, it makes me want to eat Indian food more often, even if it's not at this place."},{"name":"Fuji 1546 Restaurant and Bar","address":"1546 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was great, but took a bit to get in since the door was closed after it was supposed to be open, oversight I'm sure."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I'm actually surprised that this place doesn't have such great reviews.

Takes the pressure off  you and people can't hold tables while they are in line.\\nWe split the buffalo burger and the continental club with fries. Loved the turkey burger on the continental club...one of the best I have had, the bison was juicy and delicous and you do NEED to like blue cheese because it's on there heavy but it all works well with the hot sauce and the sassy sauce which I liked a lot too. The fries were my favorite kind, thin and crispy and salty and I loved the condiments that are also homeade. That's a great touch to get chipotle ketchup and zingy honey mustard.\\nWe had nutella and chocolate covered pretzel shakes and they were truly divine and worth every calorie. It is pricey for a burger place but the buns are homeade and taste so perfect and the place is fun for a splurge. Will definately go back for a drink.

The fried layer was the BEST part of the entire meal, but the meat was still juicy, succulent, and cooked to perfection. The crunchy fried skin holds firm to the meat with every bite unlike flaky fried batter held together by a thin, slimy/rubbery layer found in most fried chicken restaurants.

We accidentally found Blue Wave and decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nThe place looked a bit dead on the outside but was not the case inside. The bouncer was cool and let us right in. The coat check girl was anchoring herself to her podium do-hickey looking tired and disinterested...not exactly giving me a fun vibe. We got in and people were dancing so it looked promising. We made our way to the bar and plunked down a boat load of cash for drinks!! I've been to clubs in bigger cities and don't ever remember paying what I paid for a long island ice tea there! That being said all the drinks were slap your mama strong! I mean it. No watered down anything here! \\n\\nOverall the music was...eh...could have been better. Initially a little reggae which I'm not really into. Then it went to hip hop from the 80's, 90's and today with a smidgen of R&B thrown in. \\n\\nThe crowd was mostly black but I did see a few white guys and girls there. Mostly older couples at first and then more single guys came in. \\n\\nEveryone was very well dressed so it was nice to see people looking good. Not sure about the \\"no flats allowed policy\\" -my friend had flats on and had no problem getting in. \\n\\nThe place is only getting 2 stars from me because I really thought they could have mixed the music up a little better. But the real reason is the crowd. The place did not give off a pretentious vibe but I have to say the people there were not very friendly. I thought it had to do with the amount of couples that were there but then when the influx of single guys came in-I thought it was odd that a lot of these guys still seemed standoffish. Another girl came and sat at the bar and just held her purse and looked like she couldn't be bothered to talk to anyone. \\n\\nOn our way out -my friend mentioned how rude the crowd got after almost running her over to get their coats from the coat check. \\n\\nWe did end up talking to this woman outside of the club who was very friendly (maybe a little drunk too) who was hoping we had a good time. \\n\\nAll in all, it was ok for a little something to do but the crowd sank it for me. \\n\\nSo not sure what that was about.

I love the new location and had been coming for a year before the new location. My favorite is the Lox sandwich. Super yummy when it's made right. And right there is why I'm only able to give it three stars. The first few times I'd eaten here (old location) I got the Lox sandwich. I was pretty bummed out because the onion was cut so thick it was like biting into an apple. Being they use red onions that's a LOT of flavor and heat for it to be sliced that big. So I had to remove them. I got into the habit of asking if my onion could be sliced thinly, and although they obliged me, I am usually met with bewilderment, angst and perturbation by the employees. On some occasions I'd have an employee who totally got it and was happy to make it happen, but usually I felt like I was being difficult for asking such a reasonable request. The last few times I've been I got the sense that it was not a problem and I was weird for even feeling the need to ask so this visit I'm writing about now, I didn't ask. I got a pile of onion that when stacked up was larger than the one half of the sandwich. If I had left it on that would be the only thing I would taste. When an employee heard me complaining to my husband about it she offered to rectify it but I just couldn't be bothered, especially when she made excuses like \\"When it's busy sometimes the onion gets sliced thick like that\\" which I know is not the case, because unless you ask them to do it otherwise you get quarter to half inch slices of red onion ALL THE TIME, slow busy or moderate paced business hours. Please fix this ongoing issue. Having worked in high end deli/restaurants when I was younger, my suggestion is to get a meat slicer and slice your onion on the slicer and then you get beautiful thinly sliced onion and CONSISTENCY so then if you have patrons who actually WANT tons and tons of onion you just add more onion. If the issue gets fixed (I'm going to write the company directly too) then I'm more than happy to give you guys a 5 star review, cause I love you guys otherwise."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Certainly unexpected flavors.

My friend had a bowl of special soup (cream of mushroom soup), which he declared delicious. \\n\\nFor the main course, I went with the veal scallopine in a mushroom cream sauce, and he chose another special: fettuccine with shrimp, bay scallops, tomatoes and peas in a lemon cream sauce. The veal comes with whipped potatoes and veggies. I asked if I could substitute pasta for the potatoes, but was told that no substitutions are allow on the lunch menu. \\n\\nAlthough I still think pasta would have been a better companion to the veal than potatoes, I wasn't too disappointed.

His pasta dish with fresh seasonal ingredients was perfectly united by the lemony cream. \\n\\nWe were too full for dessert and went with coffee instead, which was mediocre at best, but which came with a small biscotti: a nice touch. \\n\\nAndiamo is the Italian equivalent to Chez Nous: small, family owned, near pitch perfect.

One reviewer notes slow service, so it might be helpful to know how the restaurant works: When you place an order, the items are brought to the table as soon as they're finished, rather than keeping things warm under lights and delivering them to the table all at the same time. So something just seared in the wok will be piping hot and incredibly fragrant. The wait staff is attentive and friendly without being intrusive, and the chefs--who work in an open kitchen--clearly enjoy their work. An additional plus is that vegetarians can find just as much to love as anyone else.

The only thing that I am not crazy about are the somosa's and to be honest its not that I don't like them here, I'm just not a fan in general.

So, forget about burgers at Thurman's Cafe and pizza at Plank's. Instead, go to Schmidt's Sausage Haus Und Restaurant. Not only is the food authentically German here, the waitstaff dons German garb and the restaurant itself is on the national registry of historic places! \\n\\nSchmidt's Sausage Haus is amongst the cobblestone catacombs of German Village and can't be missed, as it has a wooden cut-out of a German man and woman that are waiting for you to take your picture with (there's a spot to have your face be their face). There is ample parking on the street and in Schmidt's own parking lot behind the restaurant. Major plus.\\n\\nInside you will first see a display case with Schmidt's FAMOUS cream puffs. SAVE ROOM FOR THE CREAM PUFFS! One is plenty for a table of two, three, four, or five (if you eat one of those massive pastires by yourself, you probably will gain 6 pounds in one sitting and I would definitely judge you).\\n\\nThe menu is pretty fantastic. The pretzel starters are \\"sehr gut\\" (very good) as they say in German. Get them and split them! The best option for your visit (and in my opinion the best deal) is the buffet. It is $9.50 for the all-you-can-eat buffet where you can sample various sausages and other menu items. Most other dishes cost more than this, and you'd be limited to just one entree and 2 sides. So, why people ever get anything other than the buffet is baffling to me.\\n\\nSchmidt's is known for its Bahama Mama sausage, which comes in mild and regular. It is supposed to be really spicy and out of this world, but to me is not very spicy at all, and while it is good, I am not sure why it is so raved about. I much prefer the regular bratwurst and the sausage stew. The sides are fantastic as well: sauerkraut, potato salad (not anything like you'd see at any potluck around...it is vinegar based rather than mayonnaise based), mac and cheese, potato soup, beets, green beans, etc. There is also a salad bar and homemade applesauce.\\n\\nWhile German food is never my first choice when dining out, you HAVE to eat German if you're in German Village, and Schmidt's is where it's at!\\n\\nPS: There is BIER too!"},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This review is a little over do but here goes.

As an avid lover of fried chicken and anything Southern, I needed to give this place a shot. I'm probably the only person in Orlando who really doesn't care for 4 Rivers, but I do like the concepts that John Rivers has been rolling out here so I did have high hopes. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I went for dinner around 7:30p and it was only about half-full (it was a holiday weekend after all). It meant that we walked right up to the counter and ordered with no wait. I was in the mood for a sit-down experience, but to be honest this concept has worked very well for 4 Rivers and B&B, so I wasn't surprised when I saw it was going to be the same quick-service set up. We both got the 2-piece fried chicken with 2 sides, a dessert to share and 2 drinks. Our total was only $20! Very happy about that, because usually date nights can run much steeper. \\n\\nThe fried chicken was really good! It had a good homestyle taste, like my great grandmother made out of a cast iron skillet. The batter lightly coats the chicken and has a lot of black pepper, but its not overpowering. I had the fried okra and collard greens for my sides. The fried okra has a hard time holding on to the breading, but that's really common. The creamy horseradish sauce on the side holds everything together though! I was very happy to see the bottle of pepper vinegar on the table to go with my greens. My boyfriend got the mashed potatoes with gravy and mac and cheese. Again, everything tasted like it was made in-house and fresh. \\n\\nWe shared a serving of their bread pudding and IT WAS AMAZING! I loved how they added an extra heavy coating of icing on top. It was gooey and rich and sweet; the perfect ending to our meal.\\n\\nI'm not sure how I would like this place during a busier day. Its the same shared seating layout as 4R's, but luckily there are different 'dining rooms' and a large patio. The decor is very quaint and Southern, so there is a nice authentic feel. My only real complaint (and its really more of an observation rather than a complaint) is that it reminds me of a glorified Piccadilly Cafeteria and that's only because its Southern cuisine being served on a tray that you order down the line."},{"name":"The Mighty Oak","address":"198 W 18th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is another adorable, off the beaten track addition to the neighbourhood.

We went with a party of 9 for my daughters birthday.  She was really excited about the belly dancing!  This is the main reason we picked this place.  We got there a bit early for the dancing and almost didn't stay for it, which would have made it a very disappointing experience.  I'm glad we waited!  It made the whole visit.\\n\\nPro's: \\n- The staff are friendly\\n- They belly dancing and music were the best part!  The dancer was fun and beautiful to watch!  She invited people to the dance floor and my daughters had a blast with her!  Even the 16 month old!  The music was played by a man who also sang and was great!\\n- The ambiance, especially when the dancer and musician were playing, is fun!  And the lights all around are pretty once the sun goes down.\\n- I had a toddler running around while we waited for our food, climbing on the stages and it was perfectly fine.\\n\\nCon's:\\n- The food is just ok.  We ordered the Mezze plate, which wasn't as abundant as what they show on their website.  Three of us had the chicken sheesh kabobs and thought it was a bit over cooked.  Two ordered Shawarma and thought it was bland.  One ordered the salmon and thought it was bland and one ordered the lamb shank, which actually looked moist and yummy!  The falafels were good, but the baklava didn't have much flavor. \\n- Service was slow.  There were only a couple of tables there, so I was surprised at how slow things came out.  One person finished their main course before their sauce came out.\\n- It feels a bit old and a lot dirty.  We passed through the inside pretty quickly, but I was happy we weren't sitting in there.  Outside, the tables are mostly a bunch of folding tables, which looked to rarely get a cleaning, placed on dirt.  One of the kids spilled a cup of water and when they wiped it, it was extremely dirty.  I don't think they get a regular wiping.  My toddler kept playing in the dirt, then wiping her nose and inhaling a ton of dust.  The bathrooms were yuck.  They need a serious cleaning and smell horribly of urine.\\n\\nThis is probably a great place to sit around and smoke hooka, if you are into that (we aren't), and bring your own bottle.  Probably best to come after dark so you don't see just how dirty it is.  Maybe not the best place for kids.\\n- A bit over priced because of that.  I ended up picking up the whole bill, to the tune of $220 with tip. Since only 7 of us ordered, this seemed a lot."},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The food was amazing except for the lamb shish kabob which was undercooked.

Courson's is a new entry to the smoked meats in Austin. A food trailer on East 7th Street, and the smell of smoldering oak got my attention, so I banged a uey and stopped by for lunch. Since it was my first time I went in for the 3-meater, brisket, sausage and ribs along with  side of Brunswick stew and potato salad. First, let me rave about the Brunswick stew. I never had it before. The Q'er hails from Georgia and told me it is a staple over there on the east coast that is made mostly with pulled pork. He deiced to Texas-it-up with brisket and pork, and let me tell you that it was the finest stew I have had since.... Well I can't remember when but it was damn good. I didn't ask for the recipe but I could tell you that it had brisket, pork, corn, tomatoes, and other fine ingredients that made it worth to order. The potato salad was more of a German-inspired made with red potatoes, vinegar, green onions and other good stuff. Brisket was tender and flavorful but a bit on the dry side. The sausage was crisp and clean when I bit into it but the pork ribs were super de-lee-shus. Great smoke ring, awesome dry rub and tender and juicy. The have 4 kinds of BBQ sauce, Texas Pepper, Texas Sweet, Red Vinegar, and a mustard base sauce. All very, very good but the Texas Pepper went well with the brisket while the mustard sauce was a good compliment to the pork ribs. One thing on the menu that I didn't get since I didn't have any more room in my tummy is their corn bread style waffles. Yes! You read that correctly. One of their munu items piles on a mile high portion of brisket on top of these waffles.

I was greeted by a nice hostess whom was able to accommodate my party of one very easily at a table not the bar. My server was Micheal, a delightful very informative server. He made great suggestions, which I most definitely took him up on since we were both original mid westerners. He suggested the mussels....delicious!!! Great tomato base sauce and plentiful. I was then debating between two dishes, he said both were very popular. Since I was getting the mussels I went with the smaller, lighter of the choices....fish of the day tacos, tonight they were salmon and the mango salsa was fabulous, so flavorful and just the right amount of zing. I then followed it up with the dessert special...... blueberry bread pudding and it was just as Micheal had described it, light and fruity. Again I was not disappointed. I went home with a full and happy belly.\\nAlso I'd like to point out that the beer list was great it had a lot of local breweries, which I love, so I tried two locals but also had some other famous breweries.

I also did not feel like the cheese was very high quality. The boneless wings were soggy, soaked in Buffalo sauce, and the blue cheese was off. The wings could have been soggy because of the breading, however, you could tell that they were never crisp and basically just stuck frozen wings in a microwave and tossed them in sauce.

It was an easy solution for where to go when several of the folks were not as adventurous as the rest of us. However, we were there for 2 hours and that seems excessively long. The place wasn't busy and we were pretty quick to order. Our waitress was really cool and friendly. \\nWe all ordered side caesar salads that came out with so much dressing on them I could barely eat mine. This is honestly my complaint to restaurants in general: back off the dressing! I am always hesitant to order a caesar salad because half the time they are swimming in dressing and that's just not healthy. But, usually it's a safe salad to buy as I HATE iceberg lettuce prefer more leafy lettuces and spring greens. \\nPizza was good and as expected. We did take the time to order the Ooey-Gooey dessert early and I recommend you do it as well.

Came in for a lunch meeting right around peak lunch hour and grabbed a seat on the cozy patio. \\n\\nI did my typical \\"new biz approach\\" and did absolutely no research on the brand, menu, price point, portion size, etc. I, instead, walked in carte blanche and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the experience. \\n\\nThe layout and decor totally makes you feel like you have somehow escaped Atlanta altogether. You no longer feel like you are on Westside, but rather you have somehow made it to a restaurant reminiscent of California or something a bit more coastal. It's a cozy, laid back atmosphere with a gnarly patio. Plenty of shade, intermittent sunshine, an awesome bar area, and casual service. I grabbed a seat on the patio at one of the \\"booth-y\\" type seats. There are a few smaller tables available, but at other Yelpers have mentioned, the seating is a bit odd. It looks like you'd be sitting at a coffee table, so I avoided those. \\n\\nStarted with an order of chips and guac. The guac was pretty standard, though delicious, and the chips were easily the best part. Pretty good and I really dig that the chips were giant discs -- like flatted taco shells. The flavor was pretty great, too. \\n\\nFor tacos, I ordered a falafel taco and the mushroom mole tamale. The tamale was great and was served in a corn husk, which I appreciated. The flavors were pretty nice and deep and definitely a win for a vegetarian item. The taco was pretty small, but I rather appreciated that. It wasn't packed with a ton of cabbage or slaw like some tacos tend to be, but rather very simple and modest in flavor. If you're feeling overtly hungry upon your visit, you may need 3-4 tacos to feel full, but use your own discretion. \\n\\nService was really on point. There were probably 5 different servers taking care of our orders and drinks. They made it happen really fast, too. \\n\\nPrices aren't too bad a la carte, but they also have some great lunch specials. Worth checking out. \\n\\nWhere I'm not looking to rush back right away, I'd really love to head back for dinner on a cool night to hang out on the patio.

The empanadas were small but came with a salad.   Had we known the empanadas came with a salad, we would not have ordered the palmito salad.

The vinaigrette like dressing was more to our liking.\\n\\nWe ended ordering our main courses from the specials.  I had the tenderloin while my girlfriend had the plantain encrusted mahi mahi.  Both dishes were excellent and full of flavor.  While pricier than the main menu, both dishes were still under $20.  My one complaint is that at the end of the meal, I felt like I could've used more food.   I believe this was mostly due to the lack of carbs.  Neither dishes were accompanied with rice and beans unlike many of the other entrees, nor were we given bread (not sure what the standard practice is at Venezuelan restaurants). \\n\\nDespite a few shortcomings, I would not hesitate to go back.

The Manini Slider with pork and cabbage is a great 2 buck snack, as are all of the skewers they offer (coconut shrimp, chicken, beef, Ahi tuna; $1.75-2.25). I would be remiss to fail to mention they also do a pretty legit Ahi poke bowl...yup, out of a food truck.

Never had Ethiopian food before? Go to Desta!\\n\\nParking is plentiful as Desta is located in an outbuilding in a shopping center right off Briacliff Road in Brookhaven. Enter the front door next to their large outdoor deck and then take a deep breath and smell the wonderful aroma of some of the best East African cuisine. It's intoxicating. Common spices used in ways unfamiliar to the western palate. \\n\\nLike so many great foods, this is cooking from the heart. It's simple, designed to pull the most flavor from what we would today think of as suboptimal cuts. Think about BBQ or \\"soul\\" food - foods that took in some cases leftovers and had to craft them into delicious and sustaining meals. Such is Ethiopian food, to me anyway. \\n\\nWaitstaff was incredibly friendly and eager to dive in to help you understand the menu and explain items or step back and let you wander through it at your own pace. First time? Don't be afraid to ask for help and guidance... the folks at Desta are genuinely happy you're there and want you to enjoy your meal. We just couldn't decide so we worked with our server to put together a platter that had several of the tibs and a bunch of the vegetables. Their spicy red lentils were amazing and had incredibly deep and rich flavor and the lamb tibs were fantastic. \\n\\nAnd if you're new to Ethiopian food... you've got to at least try Injera. It's the staple bread that is made typically with Teff flour but isn't leavened - so it doesn't rise like a loaf. Think of it being more like a pancake crossed with sourdough. It's soft and a bit spongy - tear off a piece and use it to pinch up some of the tibs or the lentils or whatever you've chosen. Eating with your hands is A-OK! \\n\\nWhat can I say - go to Desta. Run to Desta."},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Give them your money.\\n\\nI love this place so much.

Sure, you could wait an hour in the summer heat (or the rain) to eat overpriced fried chicken at Screen Door OR you could come here, sit down immediately, and have a delicious, civilized brunch with really good bread, REALLY good butter, the most perfectly cooked and seasoned eggs you've ever eaten, and actually be able to have a conversation with your dining companion(s) because the noise level is sane.\\n\\nFor dinner, just do the chef's choice. Let them feed you. They will feed you well. There will be a smorgasbord of different dishes, meat and vegetable, that will delight you. The prices are damn fair.\\n\\nMy favorite thing about Navarre?

Our group ordered the fettuccine, pappardelle, and thick spaghetti. Out of those, I would recommend the thick spaghetti (#1) and pappardelle (#2), as I prefer noodles with a chewier texture. The fettuccine was well made, but it didn't have the bite that I was looking for. \\n\\nThere are also two different types of broth with the beef noodle soups: One with clear broth and one with a rich red broth. Normally, I would opt to go for the red rich broth. However, the clear broth was surprisingly just as flavorful, and maybe even more preferable with the $2 difference. I will let that for you all to decide. ;) Both broths are equally authentic and delicious.\\n\\nThe only complaint I have about the soup is the beef. The type/cut of beef in the soup is spot on, but the beef that day needed to be braised just a little longer. The meat and collagen were a bit chewy and did not have the melt-in-your mouth texture that should be in beef noodle soups. This didn't bother me too much, but the soup would be even more fantastic if the beef was cooked more.\\n\\nOverall, Xian is a pretty solid restaurant, and I'm happy that Austin finally has hand pulled noodles and authentic beef noodle soup.

Luckily, I went downtown this past weekend to try a new bar and The Coop was right down the street and an easy sell with my friends. We all checked out the menu and debated what we all would like for a while since the menu had so many things we wanted. I ended up ordering the Meatloaf, which was served on a bed of mashed potatoes and gravy, whice came with 3 sides and a biscuit or cornbread. I got the Cole Slaw, Mac n Cheese and hush puppies and when the employees saw I wasn't really interested in cornbread or a biscuit he offered to substitute it for their bread pudding which my fianc√© was happy to take to eat with his Chicken and Waffles. I liked my meatloaf, although I still fancy mine more, and it was moist and flavorful and married perfectly with the mashed potatoes and gravy. The hush puppies were perfection, the mac n cheese was delicious and my only complaint is the coleslaw was flavorless and is the kind that is minced instead of shredded. I never got to try my fianc√©s chicken and waffles which he inhaled but he told me the chicken was delicious and the waffle was just an average waffle. The servings here are big and although I felt like I wanted to eat it all I eventually just packed some up and took it home. Finally I would like to comment on the venue itself. I am in love. It has ample dining space and the the chairs and tables are all mix and matched which just made me feel so relaxed and homey (not that I had chairs mix matched at home, but there is just something about it) and the windows are big and allow lots of natural light.

Our server was nice.. When she was around. It was not busy but we did hear a server say they were short staffed. I ordered the lobster quesadilla which was tiny and has hardly any lobster. I actually had to open each piece to see how much  was in there ( much less than a tablespoon in each slice (4). Each piece was 2 bites! I honestly don't expect much in terms of food portions but this was not acceptable. The fried seafood combo meal ( around $30 a plate) came with a small portion cup of tarter sauce and no one ever came back after dropping it off to check on us or see if we needed anything else (we clearly needed more than 1 oz of tarter sauce)! The seafood was good, however the plating is a little odd. The fries and onion rings were sitting under all the seafood, collecting all of the grease. When you got to them they were slimy  and sitting in a pool of oil. I just wish after spending $100 on a meal for 2 that I didn't come home hungry and annoyed at the lack of service. Plus thirsty since no one ever came to check on us and make sure we were ok with everything.. never even offered waters. Also, my husband's plate was dirty so he had to eat his oysters off of the main dish it was served on. All in all, I would not return. Not worth your money.

Starting with the red wingback chairs, which were uncomfortable as hell,  the faux (I think) crystal chandeliers, which were gawdy as hell, and the red fabric draped across the ceiling, which was clich√© as hell, the dining room looks like it was pretending to be a ball room in a castle in Norway or something. \\n\\nOther than the cheesy decor, the food was tolerable.

First off, let me say the service was probably the worst I've ever received in a restaurant. The waiter had a horribly snooty attitude from the moment we sat down. He was very condescending towards everyone in our group as he began to explain this place's endless rules for ordering. We were schooled on their \\"order together, eat together, pay together\\" nonsense policy which involved one order card for the entire table and a dragonfly card for questions?!? We had a big group, and he insisted that we could only fill out one card for the entire table. The waiter kept coming over and telling us that their policy was easy to understand and that we were just confused. He also proceeded to inform us that this method has worked for over 7 years at their primary restaurant in Connecticut and that he had over 15 years in the service industry?!? What? Who does that?!? The dishes came out (not served by our own waiter, of course) in waves leading to some folks finishing their meals before others had been served. The food was decent, but no different than any other tapas place in town, and both the food and drinks seemed to be overpriced ($48.99 for a \\"carafe\\" of magaritas?). We had to divvy up our own checks (which required a degree in calculus) and did far more work for ourselves than our waiter did. The best part about this place was the ambiance and decor. Otherwise, it's a definite miss. This place has potential if they pull their heads out of their own tails and realize that their ordering/payment policies are extremely customer unfriendly.

You spend almost zero time with staff yet are expected to tip up front...? You order from an iPad, assign and take your own order number, bus your own tables... The drinks were good, also, but I have to say there was an unavoidably pretentious vibe emanating from the very woodwork in this place that will probably keep us from driving up here again. We live downtown and have several options available where we don't feel so odd and out of place... Definitely check it out, as this might be right up your alley and as stated, the food and drinks were good but if I'm going to spend more than $40 on breakfast for two again, it's not going to be here. Not my type of place. Again, some might love it! The selfie area with the Einstein and Mona Lisa pictures was very funny and the option to hang from a swing or sit amongst cushions will be appreciated by somebody very much, I'm sure. The no laptop policy...? That will likely keep a lot of folks from coming back...  I don't necessarily disagree with it as I'm not a \\"laptop at the coffeeshop\\" person so it doesn't affect me in the slightest BUT a lot of folks come to these places alone and to get away for awhile so they can focus on their laptop related work/activities. I will say kudos to the waitress for enforcing it! Guy next to us popped his open oblivious to the rule and as his food was delivered he was advised and complied. Little advice, though... If you're not going to allow laptops in the shop, you might want the first customer-facing interface to be that human element you're promoting instead of the iPad. If you want your customers to talk to eachother, then talk to your customers!

The Ginger Lemonade was a sure shot; it was very refreshing and you could feel the fresh-squeezedness of the Lemonade. The Parmesan Truffle Fries OH MY SO GOOD. Hands down best fries I have ever had -- the side of sauce really completes the picture and trust me, you're going to want to ask for more. The burgers, lastly, were very well made but honestly, I didn't think they were as special as a 1-hour wait. Some of the flavors in my Diablo felt overwhelming and overdone.

The chashu was actually very soft over the meat and not too fatty/chewy near the fat. I live in LA where everyone eats Ramen at Sawtelle and Little Tokyo, and I felt that this chashu was above average, even in Japan. \\n\\nTheir noodles are great. Chewy and medium sized thickness with good texture (which is exactly what I like). My only complaint about the noodles is that I wish they were a little longer. I was not able to slurp the noodles as I would have liked to but you can definitely tell that they are made in-house.\\n\\nThe broth is tricky. There are 3 different flavors to pick from, Shio (salt), Shoyu (soy sauce) and Miso (miso). They are all chicken and pork bone based soup. I got the Chashu Shoyu, which I felt was very heavily on the chicken stock side than pork bone, but was pretty good. My girlfriend got the Miso with Corn. I only had one spoonful of her miso soup and I thought it was very okay to below average. Although, the corn was good, and she liked the Miso, who also traveled with me in Japan.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely rate this place above average than most ramen places in LA, and I only know this place in Oregon since I am visiting so I can't speak for the rest of Oregon, but I would definitely come back if I am in the neighborhood."},{"name":"Honduran Tamale Factory","address":"NE 15th Ave Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"With such a far-reaching and promising name on this food-cart, I was more than a little bit expecting a singing and dancing troupe entertaining us while they whipped up our victuals. to the beat of classics like \\"Gonna make you sweat.\\" \\n\\nI am beyond delighted to have HTF up in the 'hood, and am hoping beyond hope they see fit to stick around for a long time. I felt that as a brand new food cart on the scene, they are a strong presence that is sufficiently different -- and high quality--- from the mexi-cart in the same small cart pod, to warrant plenty of attention and business. Having done many medical missions in Latin America, I was at once comfy with their menu and particularly liked several items. I'm not normally much of a tamale sorta guy, but these were rico y delicioso. They were the size and shape of your average microwave burrito, it, a couple of these would be enough for most people's appetite, and there you've done lunch for under $5!\\n\\nThey also offer Honduran style pupusas, which I thought was interesting. I ordered some with Chicharones and cotija. I thought the matron quite gracious, in conceding that Salvadorians own pupusas, but that they are quite popular all along la frontera (the border) straddling E.S. and Honduras.\\n\\nI also really liked the baleadas, which are gussied up quesadillas with meat, egg and cotija cheese, as well as several other possible options. Again, quick easy, super cheap, delicious, and just about a perfect meal. One or two of these and you are set for your day/afternoon back at the grind.\\n\\nWishing HTF supreme and lasting success. La Dona was muy amable and gave all the credit to her sister, who is apparently back in Honduras, for starting up the business. Apparently la Hermana is usually the cook as well, but I didn't find much fault with the skills of this cocinera.....

All the cheeses were great. We also had a simple tomato, mozzarella and balsamic app, and it was yummy but predictable. \\nDespite my initial misgivings about bringing a youngster here, the staff went out of their way to accommodate us, and even offered to create a kids pasta dish if we wanted. Instead, the 3 of us ordering from the menu just shared our entree with the boy - he'd eaten most of the cheese anyway. \\nThere was a musician playing in the background, which was nice. It sounded beautiful and wasn't too intrusive. \\nMy husband had the seafood pasta, I had the night's special ravioli and my daughter had the stew.

It is high end without being pretentious, super local without being granola hippie. \\n\\nWe got there at about 7pm on a Monday night and didn't have to wait for a table, though the bar was already full. We got put in the middle of one of the tables between two other couples. Not the best seats in the house I suppose, but our neighbors were friendly and it wasn't uncomfortable. \\n\\nSo commence an onslaught of flavor explosion after explosion - asparagus soup, scallops, pork belly, goat parfait - OH MY! Ridiculously flavorful, unique dishes that taste different every bite, that I would easily expect a $20/plate price tag. Between the two of us we consume 6 plates. \\n\\nThe service was impeccable. We had a cute punky-but-refined looking waitress who was just the right degree of attentive and enthusiastic without going overboard. The space itself was quaint but sophisticated, kind of like a gourmet chow line in a really nice farm or something. Nice exposed wood, beams, mason jars. The place is small, but not loud, even when full (which it was by 7:30). \\n\\nSeriously, one of the best dining experiences - yes, a total experience, not just a meal - that I've had the pleasure of experiencing in Austin. Barley Swine is completely deserving of all its accolades. \\n\\n6 plates + a round of beer for the kitchen = $77\\n\\nTHE ONLY DRAWBACK: My friend and I are both active runners/are generally athletic, so when we eat we tend to eat big. We both had to go and get something to eat after leaving Barley Swine just to get full, so unless you're willing to hike up your tab with extra dishes, I'd eat a large lunch before going."},{"name":"Eddie V's Prime Seafood","address":"9400 B Arboretum Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"BF was being extremely sweet and offered to take me to dinner at ANY place I wanted. My choice was Eddie V's.  We arrive there 30 minutes prior to our reservation time but they were happy to seat us early. Hostess handed the menus to a Seater who brought us to our table. Since it was Restaurant week, I asked if we could have that menu also. Hmmm, was that a disapproving look that Seater gave me. If so, he did come back with those menus.\\nThe waitress came over and took our drink orders, a Margaretta and Dirty Martini. She asked if I had a perference of vodka, no.  A short time later she brought the drinks and bread.  Okay, so she missed the DIRTY part of my martini. Still tasted good, but missed the olive taste.\\nSince I had already looked over the menu, I knew what my first and second choices would be. I let BF order first and he selected all of my first picks. So I was lucky enough to savor both options.\\nAppetitizers:   \\nLobster Shrimp Bisque had more of a seafood stock consistency rather than creamy. It had a lot of shrimp and lobster pieces. I found that the more you ate it the creamier it got.\\nSeared Scallops on cheesy grits with a tomato vinegarette was so first-rate. Scallops were perfectly cooked. The grits were creamy and smooth. The tomato vinegerette complimented the grits and scallops. This dish was so worth coming for.\\n\\nEntrees:\\nSauteed Gulf Snapper was a large filet with a golden brown color. It was served with a brown butter and sliced red grapes. I almost didn't share with BF because it was so good. My compliments go to the grape slicer. The slight sweetness of the grapes cut the richness of thee brown butter. \\nRoasted Alaskan Halibut was BF pick. It was served with Green beans...Oops, I mean, Haricots Vert, tomatos, olives and capers. It had good flavors but I think my entr√©e was much better.\\n\\nDesserts: \\nThe Chocolate mousse was light and fluffy. Not bad but I like my chocolate flavor intense.\\nNow the Cr√®me Brulee was rich and creamy. It was crusted with brown sugar which lent itself to a slightly different flavor on top. I really enjoyed it. Oh, and it came with two homemade cookies. Well, actually one was more of a marizapn and the other a fudge ball. \\n\\nThe service was impecable.

No, my father is not gay, he's just particular about his apple martinis, so he had a beer instead.  My margarita was ok, but kind of watery.\\n\\nThe food was pretty disappointing.

I'd been hearing much hoopla about Nuba but had never managed to make it to any of the locations. Finally a couple of friends and I were heading out for a girl's night and decided to give it a try.\\n\\nA cool retro room and an interesting mix of people. Main Street Hipsters in all their glory to normal folk just having a night out. And some chick who thought she was Lady Gaga. We had made reservations and would love to have had one of the booths on the edge of the room but instead were seated at a very badly placed table, right at the bottom of the stairs to the raised seating area and in the middle of the pathway from the kitchen/bar to the rest of the restaurant. it was like someone had moved the table their temporarily and forgotten to move it back. My friend sitting closest to the stairs was constantly bumped and knocked throughout the evening but customers and staff. We would have asked for a different table except they looked pretty full.  \\n\\nOur first greeting by the bus person was not much of a greeting. No \\"hello\\" or any other words for that matter. Literally slammed three glasses down on the table, splooshed water into them, and walked away. We were all a bit stunned by this. His behaviour was pretty much the same when he came back for refills and to bus the table. We were definitely putting him out by being there.\\n\\nThe restaurant was fairly busy as it was 8:00 on a Friday night. It took a while to get menus and drink orders taken but the server was pleasant, if not a bit rushed, and answered our questions well.\\n\\nWe shared a couple of appies: the baba ghanooj and the crispy cauliflower. SO YUMMY. I dream about both of them. Very flavourful and fresh tasting. So we had high hopes for our mains. I ordered the Chicken Shish Tawook and my friends both ordered the Beef Tenderloin Kebabs. My chicken was very tender but very bland. The menu said it was marinated but I didn't taste any marinade at all and no spice either. Plus, no salt and pepper on the table. My friends both said the same thing about their beef, although theirs wasn't as tender. All three entrees were served with potatoes and a salad. The salad was standard and fine but the potatoes were greasy, cold and tough and seemed suspiciously like leftover breakfast homefries.\\n\\nFor dessert we shared a rice pudding and a chocolate lava cake with mango ice cream. Both were quite good. The rice pudding had a creme brulee type hard sugar shell on top (yum!) and the chocolate lava cake was hot and gooey with lots of rich chocolate flavour and not too much sugar.\\n\\nOverall, I'll definitely give it another shot but probably won't go back to this location. The too-cool-for-school attitude was just a bit much to take. But it's also sort of what we expected. As for the menu, next time I think we would just order a variety of appies and do dinner that way since they were so tasty. Looking forward to hitting the Main & 3rd location, especially now that they're fully licensed."},{"name":"Bauhaus Restaurant","address":"1st W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this gem of a place one night walking through downtown Vancouver.

Every donut here starts with a soft brioche recipe originating in France which means less work for you in tearing the pieces off the donut. I rank the lemon poppy seed as my top choice because it has the best balance between sweet frosting and sour lemon. The cinnamon & sugar comes in at a close second because I think it's the best way to taste the purest form of the Blue Star Doughnut. You can't go wrong with any choice though. I thought an interesting doughnut was the salted caramel which comes speckled with pretzel bits. This was a little overbearing on the sugar, but was the coolest combination compared to the other sweet donuts. All donuts clock in at about $2.50 so you know it's going to be good and they don't disappoint. If you're a fan of chocolate, you will find a doughnut haven here.\\n\\nFeatures:\\nThis is a bright corner cafe that doesn't care how early it closes. They open early and close when they run out of donuts for the day. This usually ends up being around 3-4PM on a regular day. They have nice bar seats great for people watching and an open kitchen concept so you can see the donuts being made. There is also a self-serve water jug so you can wash down their delicious donuts easier.\\n\\nService:\\nThe staff are super friendly here. Maybe they know people love people who serve donuts. They can be heartbreakers when they run out of donuts, but that's just the way it goes when you show up too late for your favourite flavour. It's a very quick process to get a doughnut, and I recommend you try one before 3PM any day of the week.\\n\\nOne-liner: Tasty, non-Voodoo donuts\\nHighlight: Lemon Poppy Seed Doughnut\\nRecommended for: Those who enjoy quick lines for donuts\\nWould I go back?

The brisket is overall the best. It's juicy and falls apart. The seasoning on top is an appropriate amount that's not too heavy. The pepper isn't overwhelming that you can't taste it. Very tender.  \\n\\nThe original sausage was great too, it had flavor rather than just cooked. It was tender and it was chewy. \\n\\nThe spare ribs had appropriate amount of seasoning and pepper as well. Sorry guys, really picky about too much or not enough seasoning. I was just really impressed how well prepared these were. \\n\\nNot too found of the sweet tea, it tasted too water down for me(yes I checked if it was unsweet. Tried them all). But I guess they're trying accommodate to all people's preference. They do have sugar packets to compensate. It helped a little bit. \\n\\nSides: Mac n cheese was good. It didn't taste fake like Kraft or something. \\n\\nThe green beans were probably the best I've ever  had. So juicy and well cooked. It wasn't rubbery or soaked. \\n\\nThe potato salad was portioned in its ingredients where you taste everything evenly. It wasn't where one ingredient stood out than the other. It was very good. For my wife and I to be full from all the above came out to $30.96 for those just scrolling to see some prices. It may not look like you got much on your plate but man, you'll be full. \\n\\nThe cobbler my in-laws got was good as well. It wasn't too crust-like where you can't taste the glory. The cobbler wasn't all over the place. It was more held up together. \\n\\nThere's a changing table in the women's in case you brought your baby. \\n\\nThe staff are very polite and informative in explaining how everything is cut and priced to first time guests.

I've never taken anyone here who hasn't raved about their food and the service. This place does not skimp on anything.  Everything is first class. \\n\\nThe quality of food is always consistent, top quality, and delicious. The service is beyond compare. I know several of the wait staff have been there for at least a decade, probably more.  I've never had a bad meal or bad service at Babette's. Once, a long time ago, the muscles were not up to their usual standards; they were a little large and a bit rubbery, but we ate them anyway. After we had eaten them our waitress came to take the plate away, she asked us how they were, we told her; she apologized profusely. A little while later Marla, the owner & chef, came out to apologize. She said we were correct  and not only did she not charge us for them, but she gave us a free dessert to make up for the inconvenience of us eating muscles that were not up to her usual standards. \\n\\nTo start, I love the baguette. We never fail to devour it and request more.\\n\\nThe wine list is very good and the servers are very knowledgeable about it. The cocktails are served good and strong.  \\n\\nWe always get an order, or 2, of the muscles. The sauce is fantastic; we sop up every drop with the wonderful bread mentioned above. This dish makes me wish Babette's wasn't such a nice place so that I could pick up the bowl and drink the sauce. My husband has been known to run his finger around inside the bowl and lick it, but he at least tries to make sure no one is looking. \\n\\nThe corn chowder, only served at certain times of the year, is great. My older son always gets a bowl, the rest of us get a cup. \\n\\nMy favorite main dish is the lamp chops. I love the sauce on them. They are always cooked to perfection, moist, and melt in your mouth. The string potatoes served with them are also delicious; my younger son grabs some as soon as my plate is put down. My older son usually gets the lamb chops too.\\n\\nMy husband is more of an experimenter and tries different dishes and the specials; he usually ends up with a fish dish or the vegetable plate. He has never been disappointed in any dish. Their fish is always fresh, flaky and also cooked to perfection.   \\n\\nMy younger son usually gets the filet mignon, he loves it. It melts in your mouth. The horseradish mashed potatoes are excellent! I try to steal a few spoonsful, but he is usually on alert. \\n\\nTheir deserts are wonderful too; they seem to change more than anything else. I think it has to do with the season and crop of fruits. They always have the cr√®me brulee and it is to die for.  If they have the blueberry pie/tart, get it!

Plenty of shrimp but tasteless and with a lackluster presentation. My meal was the Special 'Superfood' of Cod and Goji berries. Bleh.

I GOT that for a .50 charge still no Italian dressing.  Next I ordered a Calzone with ONLY one marinara side. Really a whole calzone and on tiny side of sauce. Next but not least I asked if the cheesecake was good the dude taking the order said it was a good choice and it came with caramel sauce. Well guess what no caramel sauce. I called them back when I received my order the guy said he tell his manager about the situation and try to resolve the issue but to no avail no call no nothing. Just left a bad taste in my mouth.

First, we caught hell for entering the restaurant through the front door. \\"To go\\" orders are sent to a side door. Excuuuuuse me...\\n\\nNope, they don't offer any of the barbecued menu items to go. We wanted to get up to New Hampshire, so we changed our order to a plain pizza and a sausage pizza.

Santarpio's put our \\"to go\\" pizzas on a circular piece of cardboard and slid them into two large, thin paper bags.\\n\\nThe crusts were firm and chewy as good pizza should be. What's up with corn meal on the bottom of the pizza? My companion thought these pizzas were just great. But, she's from Chicago (what the hell do they know about pizza? They eat pizza with a knife and fork). I thought they were pretty good. I knocked them down a star because I thought their sausage pizza should have had more sausage on it.\\n\\nThe second time, we ate on the premises. We ordered another plain pie and a variety of barbecued lamb and sausage. The pizza and the barbecued over fire lamb chunks and sausages were outstanding. The locals, including the waitstaff, become more friendly the more you talk to them.\\n\\nThey make their own sausage. Could they put a little more of it on their pizzas? Could you  break down and put your pizza in boxes? Paper bags are cheap and your pizza deserves better.

We met a friend here for a meal before heading to a birthday party, and got reservations like 2 hours before we showed up. Good thing too, because the place was jamming the entire time. \\n\\nThe restaurant is small and charming, but you can tell it is kept up pretty well and not falling apart. I thought I had overheard that they moved from somewhere else in the N. End, but I can't be sure. \\n\\nThe bf and I had to wait a while for our friend, so we ordered up the wine and the special appetizer - this wonderful bruschetta that I immediately wanted more of...basil, fresh mozzerella...mmm...at the end of our meal, I recommended they put it on the menu permanently! Once our friend arrived, we got a couple of salads to share and ordered our meal. The bf went off the specials menu (which seems to be pretty consistent given other reviews), I had the simple linguini, and my friend customized the Gamberi option with penne. We ordered up another bottle of wine to wash down the delicious food. \\n\\nCame to about $70 each, if I can remember correctly, including tip. So, it was pricey but mainly because we were lushes and had 2 bottles of wine for 3 people. Well, it was worth it!! This now rivals Pomodoro as my favorite \\"nice\\" place in the N. End.

Also had the blackened chicken wings, which were also good but not amazing. I would try the place again and order some different things. Think I got too much char flavor between the two dishes.

I got some sort of spicy chicken omlette that really hit the spot. The home fries were the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth. Or maybe I was still drunk. Either way, it was good. They also serve a ridiculously large spicy bloody mary, which is my spirit drink. And to top off the huge portions food and drink, the bill was SO low. It was like I died and went to heaven.\\n\\nI also came here one night for trivia, the trivia wasn't that great and the waitress never came over to drink my drink order (I showed up a bit late), so I wouldn't endorse trivia night at Whiskey's.\\n\\nFinally, I stumbled here from a Saint Patrick's Day rooftop party in Southie to find a fellow Chiver who bought me and my friend drinks, which was so nice of him. And even on Saint Patrick's Day, the service was up to par, we didn't have to wait too long for our drinks or food. Overall, Whiskey's is a pretty solid place.

Tony was the nicest man serving us and made both me and my friend feel very welcomed. We shared the sausage and garlic pizza and a lamb barbecue. Both were AMAZING!! I was particularly blown away by the flavor and deliciousness of the lamb. The small spicy peppers and Italian bread that came with it were on point too.  Next time I want to try the other barbecue meats. The pizza sauce was delicious, and the sausage on top was so good as well. One thing I recommend is waiting until the pizza cools down a bit before digging in so the cheese and sauce can settle a bit and your slice is able to be picked up and eaten by hand:) there is only one size pizza (about 13 inch) and it is enough to feed 1-2 people each. Since my friend and I got beers, a lamb skewer, and a pizz to share, we both left feeling very full and there was still some slices leftover to take home"},{"name":"etc... eatery","address":"6500 SW Virginia Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this local restaurant!

Came on a Wednesday around 6:15. We were told that without a reservation, there would be no room for us in the main dining area and we'd have to sit at the bar. Seemed a bit odd to me because the whole place was empty but, I get it, the kitchen can get busy and they were anticipating reservations. We sat down at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine. The bartender asked if we were moving to a table in the dining room and I let him know they said none were available until around 9:30 so, we were fine at the bar. He sort of rolled his eyes and let us know he wasn't sure why they'd said that but that he could certainly get us a table in the main dining area. We didn't want to move at that point so, we stayed put. (Not to mention that would have been a bit awkward after the male host told us we couldn't sit there already). I love meza so, we ordered the eggplant walnut dip which was my favorite appetizer of the evening! We also ordered the octopus which I thought was super tough - I wouldn't order again. Next we had the lamb chops which were okay and finally the baked cheese which was delicious and rich. For dinner, we split the dorade fish which was really yummy - done very simply but so delicious. It was served with very salty kale which I didn't care for. The bar area got pretty crowded as our meal went on and service really started to deteriorate. It took 30+ mins for our check and we never got water refilled. This probably could have been avoided if we were allowed to sit in the dinner area.

To me, the food is \\"meh,\\" at best. \\n\\nI've been there for lunch buffet once--if you can call it a buffet when you have maybe two options each for veg and non-veg. The food then was unimpressive. Most Indian buffets have twice the options, which is sort of the point of a buffet.\\n\\nDinner is a la carte, but the quality isn't much better. The Samosa Chaat is pretty bland, surprising given the preparation, which on arrival had so much potential. I also had the Vegetable Ayam, which was passable but left me feeling a bit ill from the overt creaminess, and the Bhindi Masala which was okay, if bland. \\n\\nThe servers don't seem to know much about the food, or the wines, and are generally lackadaisical in their attitude. We were in a group and had a variety of naans ordered, but they were all mixed up in baskets and unceremoniously deposited at random on the table without any explanation of what each one was. We were left to attempt to figure it out in the massively under-lit dining room.\\n\\nAs for said dining room, the decor reminds me of those fake medieval dining halls you would find at Disney or Vegas in the 70s and 80s.

The sides are bland and uninspired, which I would normally overlook in a barbecue restaurant, but I'm grasping for explanations.  \\n\\nOne contributing factor in the price I paid is that the beef ribs are cut way too big (not to mention too fatty.)  They look impressive as a novelty, but if you end up paying $30 for lunch because a single rib weighs more than a pound, that's just not worth it.  It's either a gimmick for tourists or a way to inflate prices by making people buy more than they want.

Our favorite is by far the shittake pasta. My second favorite was the squash and my husband's was the rice pudding. For our budget, it's definitely a special occasion meal (the 2 of us, with 2 drinks each, was about $125), but worth every penny. Also, the steak was undercooked (but only for our taste, would have been perfect for others). The server asked if everything was ok with the dish (since we didn't finish it) and we said it was simply undercooked for our taste. He comped that dish, even though it was our preference.

As the manager walked by I did show him the onion skin and informed him. He said he will review the process and see if they need more training. This is the only location that has had this problem. I've been going to this location for over 3 years. Even when they were struggling and then re-opened, we still come back. The business concept is excellent, the food theoretically is good.

My favorites are the potato soup (top it with a little bit of bacon from salad bar), mac and cheese (it's creamy and saucy, the way mac should be), green beans with spaetzel (canned green beans and balls of dough, no, I'm not being sarcastic when I say I love it), and the sausage and pasta dish that is basically doused in BBQ sauce (the name is escaping me).\\n\\nTheir cream puffs are huge and pretty delicious, I think the chocolate one is actually my favorite over the original vanilla.

It was a generous portion of ahi tuna, with good furikake rice and decent Asian slaw. It was the style you get at the markets in Hawaii that's the traditional or shoyu style. Very nice and fresh. We make poke at home pretty regularly, although we make a slightly different style, so it's nice to get the traditional style. \\n\\nWe also tried the huli huli chicken skewer, which was basically a chicken teriyaki skewer. It was fine. The kahlua pig (called kahlua pork here) slider was good, not quite the taste we remember from Hawaii, but good. I liked it with the pineapple sauce we got for the shrimp, rather than the lava sauce it came with. But both are good. Finally, we had the coconut shrimp skewer, which was delicious. It's fried coconut shrimp, with the pineapple sauce. Hard to go wrong there.\\n\\nWe'd like to go back and try a few of the other dishes, but we'll certainly get the poke and the shrimp again. We're not loco moco fans, but they do have it on the menu there. \\n\\nOne word of caution - as others have mentioned, if you go when it's busy, you will wait.

The company we are keeping, the mood we are in, the weather if one is sitting outside, and how much alcohol one has to drink are all significant factors that can make or break a person's impression of a place - especially when it's their first impression.\\n\\nLuckily for Phara's, all of these factors fell in their favor on my first outing here.  I was with the indomitable Liz C., feeling relatively happy with the world, sporting a bottle of wine we brought ourselves (no liquor license yet, so it's BYO), and the evening was lovely and relatively cool.  We opted to sit on the cement part of the patio, within earshot of the live band that was playing, but out of target audience range for the bellydancer (and the mosquitoes).  It was perfect.  I could have sat there all night; indeed, we loitered for hours, until the Great Storm of 2008 started tapping on the patio cover.\\n\\nHappily, the factors that Phara's DID have control over were well-aligned that evening, too.  Phara's has taken the space formerly occupied by Ararat and added an overlay of peacefulness to the vibe.  The rugs that previously covered the walls have been taken down, in favor of a uniform coat of deep teal paint and a piece or two of art.  Outdoors, there's ample seating divided into three distinct areas, plus a small covered area for a band and a bellydancer.    The place is dimly lit both inside and out, a liberal application of white Christmas lights making everything feel rather twinkly.\\n\\nThe menu offered several things that sounded tempting, including FIVE different lamb dishes, a salmon dish, several other meatatarian entrees, and a number of veggie entrees.  I chose the lamb shank ($21), and Liz had the thali platter ($13).  The shank was giNORmous and the meat practically fell off the bone when you looked at it.  It was accompanied by some rice mixed with dried cranberries; some cous cous; a smattering of grilled veggies; a wonderful mint chutney; some yogurt sauce, and pita bread.  I loved everything on my plate with the exception of the cous cous, which seemed a little on the dry and bland side to me.  I also liberally sampled from Liz's plate, and loved most everything there, too, especially the dolmas, which were outstanding.\\n\\nService was absolutely perfect:  warm, friendly, attentive but not obtrusive, with a liberal sprinkling of humor.  This was true for everybody from our actual server to the host to Phara, who briefly said hello to us as she walked by.  When we realized that the storm wasn't going to let up anytime soon and that we were going to have to leave while it was raining, our server even gallantly offered to accompany us to our respective cars after our meal, so we could make use of his large umbrella.  In short, we were made to feel that we were among friends.  \\n\\nSo why didn't I give Phara's five stars?  Two reasons.  One, I agree with Amanda that charging a corking fee per person is a little lame.  Sure, it's only $3, but if you have four people sharing a bottle of wine, you could conceivably be charged $12 to drink a bottle of wine you brought and served yourself (they did supply wine glasses and a corkscrew, but didn't open it or pour it).  Two, my recent experience with Cuatro's instilled in me a reluctance to give a five star rating to any but the very, very best experiences on my first outing.  That said, I certainly wouldn't preclude the possibility that Phara's may earn a fifth star from me after subsequent visits.  I'd give it 4-1/2 stars right now if I could, as my first experience here was nothing short of delightful."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The hours suck.\\n\\nEverything is the most donuty deliciousness you've ever experienced.

But not really - boo. \\n\\nFive stars for service. I have rarely seen such attentive service anywhere in the greater metro area. Neither water glass nor coffee cup ever got below the half full point, and food came out lickety-split. I didn't time the delivery, but it couldn't have been more than 7 or 8 minutes after ordering. Amazing!  My breakfast companion is a bit of a picky customer, but our patient server handled him like a pro and with a smile. When I said I might need milk with my coffee, depending on the coffee, she brought both milk and cream just in case. Well done, and the hefty tip was well-deserved. \\n\\nAlthough it breaks my heart to say this, only three stars for food. I had the corned beef hash, which was a mighty large serving (stuffed me for two separate meals, and I'm a serious eater) of beautifully prepared goodness. If you've never had real corned beef hash, where you can see shreds of real corned beef, served with potato hunks instead of the microscopic dice from a can, do yourself a favor and order this. They served it with shredded Swiss cheese, which I'd never heard of, but it worked well. The poached eggs got a bit too firm of a poach on them, so the yolks didn't run the way they should have. That would have been a nice accompaniment. The dish was served with a horseradish cream. The flavor was perfect for the hash, but the format didn't make sense. The horseradish had a mayo consistency. How do you spread something like mayo onto something like hash that already has a soft texture?  I was baffled. Perhaps they should thin the cream to more of a sauce consistency so it can actually make its way onto the hash. They offer a few options on bread upgrades, so I got the coffee cake. I was expecting a big piece of cinnamon-y, crumbling cake. What I got was a small piece of flavorless cake that seemed to be made primarily of butter and cornmeal. It had exactly one lonely walnut baked into it and no topping to speak of. Since I paid extra for it, it was pretty disappointing. I also didn't care for the fact that even though I ordered a savory dish, they just plunked the coffee cake on top of it. Cake and beef. Yuck. How about a plate?  The coffee was another miss. At a place like this and at these prices, I'd expect a specialty grind, but I got a sour cup of joe like you'd get at a diner. \\n\\nAmbiance was great, and it wasn't busy at all at 9:30 on a Thursday morning, but I never felt rushed. A side note:  I was taught that if they bring you your check on a tray or in a portfolio, they'll pick up the bill and payment for you. If they just leave the slip on the table, you're supposed to pay up front at the register. They did the latter, but there was no register up front. I ended up just leaving cash on the table, because I didn't see any middle ground. Including tip it was $42 for two for breakfast, so yeah, a bit spendy."},{"name":"Frontier Public House","address":"4909 NE Hazel Dell Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"What a great find!!!\\nThis place has a great menu great creative drinks and even a good kids menu!"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I just walked in to the clay pit and Hannah, one of hostesses instantly knew my name and previous order.

Lets face it; not that many options for breakfast in the greater Lakeway / Bee Caves area. We got up early to deliver a piece of fitness equipment in the neighborhood and instead of driving back to Oak Hill to wait in line at Jim's we gave it a shot.\\n\\nSeating was immediate to our surprise as we got in just before the wait started. First transgression for a country fella; no biscuits on the dang menu. This place claims even down to the greeting from our server to be \\"French-esque\\" so we both started with a butter croissant. Strangely, no condiments were brought to the table when they were served to us. The jelly basket I would think would be a no brainer here.\\n\\nFor my entree I had the steak and eggs. Perhaps a bit overcooked from my request of rare; the steak was quite flavorful. It was served with breakfast potatoes when the menu description clearly stated it came with fries. So $19 for a steak dish and it doesn't even come with bread. Yeah yeah, I had a pastry before the meal. Appetizer I mean! Mimi's charged me $2.00 for ONE friggin' slice of rye bread.\\n\\nThe wife had a crepe number with spinach, egg, and mornay. Same taters and again $2 toast. At least she got two slices. We're both used to having salsa to accompany our dishes; forget it Texans as it comes right out of a container from New York City. . So, they spend a million hours baking various signature pastries and can't find 10 minutes to make fresh salsa. \\n\\nService started out friendly and attentive and went to hell and a bread basket when she got three small tables. I had to ask for items repeatedly, and filled my own tea glass more than once.

With the opening of new Chinese restaurants all over Vancouver and Richmond during the '90s with gourmet Chinese cuisine chefs from Hong Kong, we slowly forgot about the Golden Swan despite the fact there we always see a long line outside the restaurant on Saturdays and Sundays.\\n\\nWe were looking for a neighbourhood place for dim sum this morning and decided to give Golden Swan a try after a 20-year absence.  We both LOVED it.  The dum sum dishes were hot and delicious;  and the variety was abundant.   We ordered:\\n\\n- deep fried soy bean sheet roll\\n- princess bun\\n- Tripes\\n- Pork dumplings\\n- Chive dumplings\\n- \\"Salt water\\" dumplings ( a deep fried crunchy dough with pork and dried shrimp fillings.\\n\\nOur favourite was with princess bun.  It is a light sugared coated doughnut filled with BBQ pork.  We love the sweet and savoury combination as well as the doughnut texture unlike the usual the BBQ pork bun.\\n\\nYou need to get in before 10am.  Otherwise, expect a long line and long wait.\\n\\nThe only drawback of the restaurant is that they still push carts vs letting patrons order from a menu.  Instead of relaxing to enjoy the food, you need to constantly perk up your ears to listen to the waitresses revealing the dishes to the tables next to you so you are ready to order (or decline) when  they come to your table.  The other downside of ordering from carts is you don't know what's coming  so you would order as they come along because you are hungry.  Finally, when your favourite dish appears, you're either too full or force yourself to order it even though you're full.  \\n\\nDespite the cart pushing, I think Golden Swan will re-appear on our list of dim sum restaurants to patronize regularly.

It was slightly spicy, and when blended all together, it was so good and the portions were just right. My husband got the Fricasee, which included poached eggs, short ribs, potatoes and sauteed onions. The short ribs on that dish was to die for.

The bar served one of my favorite local craft beers which is the 512 Pecan Porter so that was a good start, however the mason jar it was served in made me question if I was actually getting served a full pint. Oh well, I might just of been really hung over that day who knows. I didn't know what to order so the bartender suggested a master piece that consisted of a donut, mashed potatoes which I believe had a pancake some how synced into it, pot roast, and a bunch of onion rings on it. Let me tell you when that thing arrived I was in all. I am not sure if I ate it the correct way, but I basically cut it into pieces and tried to make sure I had a piece of everything in each fork full. I will supply a picture of this architectural master piece onto this review. I wish I remembered what it was called...

Jerk Chicken with coconut rice: amazing- salty and spicy. Roasted brussels sprouts: love that they were dark and carmelized. Beet salad: delicious, even my husband who hates beets ate some. The watermelon salad that they had during the summer was sweet and refreshing, hope they bring it back this summer! My son usually gets the kid's burger; he likes it, and it comes with enough fries that mom can easily steal some.\\n\\nOverall, we have really enjoyed this place- consistently good food, drinks, and service.

When does 3 hot dishes constitute a buffet?\\n\\nWe've been to pretty much every Indian food joint in town, and this place really scores the bottom of the list as far as range of dishes on the buffet.  \\n\\nI'm generally a big eater, and usually have no problem making a second run at a buffet table.  This time, though, I tried a small sampling of several items, none of which looked particularly appealing.  The Tandoori chicken, in particular, was the absolute worst excuse for suck I've ever seen.  Nothing but thighs and wings and a few other unidentified parts.  Dry and flavorless.\\n\\nAt first I wondered where the Naan was on the buffet, but then realized the waitress had brought out a plate to the table.  This bread was dry and near cold.. nothing like a proper naan should be. Okay, I will admit the waitress was pleasant and attentive.. one small bright mark\\n\\nWhen all was said and done, I picked at my food, and then had no inclination to return to the buffet for more (same for my wife and our other dining companion).\\n\\nWe won't be back, at least not for lunch.  There are too many other appealing places in town offering far superior food, such as Bombay Bistro, or Royal India in the Sunset Valley area.. both outstanding alternatives!\\n\\nFor those who gave this place a 5 star rating.. my advice, go to a REAL Indian Food restaurant, and then see if you don't have a different opinion.\\n\\nOh, did I mention it is impossible to find free parking?"},{"name":"Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen","address":"3652 Bee Caves Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"1.5","text":"This Popeyes does not serve hot fresh chicken or biscuits.

Quite possible that everything is meticulously metered out to accommodate a specific number of servings, but it would be nice to allow that kind of flexibility.

Their price for a glass of wine is definitely overpriced compared to other restaurants in the city. Their appetizers have always been satisfying but certainly overpriced. I would even recommend serving half the amount, lowering the price and therefore  encouraging small groups (2-3) to order more than one appetizer instead of feeling like they should just order one thing due to the high prices. I also wasn't super impressed with their cheeses. It felt like they just purchased them from Whole foods and threw them on a plate without much thought. \\n\\nAll in all, I'm sure I'll be back (multiple times) but mainly because it is the most convenient wine bar to grab a glass of wine with a girlfriend.

Hopdoddy was recommended to me by, well, any person within earshot who heard me mention I was going to Austin. Even though I wasn't the most stoked to visit, I made sure it was on my list of places to eat on vacation. We headed to the South Congress location on a Saturday night around 6pm, and from getting in line to getting food, probably waited 30 minutes. However, this place knows how to make you wait. Within a minute of getting in line, our drink orders were taken, and by the time we reached inside, we were knee deep in some great drinks, which certainly made the line feel shorter. I ordered the burger of the month, the Kahuna, which was a chicken burger marinated in a Hefeweizen/teriyaki sauce, with soy-glazed grilled pineapple, cilantro lime mayo and avocado. When I took a bite of this burger, I yelped (pun intended). With this many flavors going on, it's easy for something to get lost, but not with this burger. It is easily the best burger I've had. Two friends ordered the goodnight/good cause and had equal sentiments to share. My sister got a salad and said it was good. I'm sure it was, but I didn't waste any space in my stomach to try it. \\n\\nI want to spend a moment talking about the Parmesan truffle fries. If you order nothing else, order these. One order was enough for a hungry group of four, but don't be embarrassed if you want more. Live your best life! What makes these thinly-sliced fries stand out, besides the healthy serving or Parmesan and the delicate taste of truffle, is the truffle aioli. Am I being dramatic when I say I'd like to be buried in this aioli? Probably. But I don't care. This sauce is BOMB. I can't put into words what it is, but order it, and order extra, because we went through four containers of aioli. \\n\\nDo me a favor and visit Hopdoddy. And then visit twice more. And take a selfie with your life-changing burger. Let the world know the wonder that is truffle aioli."},{"name":"Pho Van","address":"8557 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Very consistent, very quick and easy!

I do not recommend this to anyone at all.  \\n\\nI ordered the super spicy ramen on a 10/20 level of spicyness.  It was also customizable so I asked for a rich broth.  What came out was a tiny bowl (and i thought jinya's was small) with noodles you can finish in probably 5 spoonfuls.  The broth wasnt rich at all, in fact watery.  And the chashu that came with it was 2 small slices, on the rubbery side, not moist, not the melt-in-your-mouth kind.  The only toppings were green onions and chashu, anything else would be extra. A little disappointing considering how there was already so little noodles that came with it already.\\n\\nThis place is mediocre, and I would rather go to the ramen shop in the Robson public market, and enjoy a large hearty bowl without the long wait.

We also got an order of TRUFFLE KENNEBEC FRIES for the table. \\n\\nThere's no denying that this is a pretty good burger. My primary complaint would be that, in the scheme of things, it's actually a pretty small burger.

We had the fried green tomatoes, fries, cole slaw, and mac and cheese on the side. The fried green tomatoes come in a nice batter but it seemed to lack something. Maybe the crunch of the fresh green tomatoes or maybe the batter was not as crunchy as I'd prefer. The fries are pretty standard. The cole slaw tasted akin to something I'd get from a fast food chain but not saturated in mayonnaise. The mac and cheese was basic as well.\\n\\nBut the name of the place is Famous Fried Chicken, not Outstanding Tomatoes, Renowned Slaw, or Mac and Cheese. That chicken is as moist as an orange and crunchy like a bag of potato chips. The batter is full of flavor as well as crunch.

Scouring the breakfast side of Yelp, the pickings were either unimpressive or further than we cared to walk on a rainy Saturday morning. Remembering hearing about a diner near by that had the same name as the gang that spent one weekend afternoon in detention that changed their lives, we immediately grabbed our jackets and headed for the door.\\nUpon arrival, there was a mass of eager and hungry people crammed into the doorway like hungover, hipster dressed sardines. Most were in groups of two or three like us, which just so happened to be the average number leaving at the same time. However, there was one wanker in front of us who was eating alone. Before I go on, I would just like to say thanks douche bag, for taking the counter where three seats just cleared out. It would have been courteous and considerate if you held off for a minute to let three people sit where three people could actually sit, together. For this, you are a wanker douche who eats alone.\\nAnyways, once seated, all three of us eagerly ordered coffee in their amazingly labeled \\"Breakfast Club\\" mugs. Now this, is a mug I would purchase; beautifully labeled and conveniently large. The waitress was quick to come back and grab our orders. I ordered the oatmeal with walnuts, and The Jock; an egg white omelet with mushrooms, peppers and broccoli with wheat toast (hold the butter). My girlfriend got the The Criminal, which came with just about everything except Judd T. Nelson; two pancakes, two eggs any style, sausage, toast, and homefries. Our friend ordered the Blueberry Oatmeal Pancakes, which were a part of the Breakfast Specials. \\nThe oatmeal came pretty quickly, and was surprisingly enormous and tasty. However, the walnuts were candied, which gave off this coated confectionery taste, and didn't cover the massive bowel like I would have enjoyed. Shortly after, our meals came, which is where I was massively disappointed.\\nWhere in the omelets from the section marked \\"Omelets\\" mentioned them being three egg, this must have been secretly labeled under the \\"one egg\\" section. My omelet was so disappointingly small, that it looked like I ordered a side of omelet with my meal of toast. It was so tiny, it looked like an underweight albino fetus. I didn't know whether to eat it or call Planed Parenthood. Sorry for the similes and jokes, but it was just that disappointing. However, it didn't taste all that bad, and the waitress did actually remember not to lather the toast with butter, which typically doesn't happen at diners, even when requested. My friends Blueberry Oatmeal Pancakes looked absolutely delicious, but weren't as big as I expected. \\nAll in all, The Breakfast Club is a fantastic idea and atmosphere, with posters from almost every iconic 80's film plastered on the walls. Too bad it's all wrapped around so-so portions and uneven dishes. The coffee was good, as was the music, which was definitely cranked to 11, however, when I hit up a diner, I want massive portions as I'm not really giving two shits about what notch my belt is on.

When my wife and I arrived there were only 2 seats left at the bar, which was fine by us because we enjoy eating at bars. This place was lively, with a good buzz but not too loud that it was hard to have a conversation. We sat down and a server took our coats and hung them up even though the hooks were only 10 feet away. We were served by what turned out to be the wife of one of the owners. What an incredibly charming woman! She was working feverishly but each time she stopped to talk to us it was like we were the only people in the restaurant. In addition to enjoyable banter she also provided great recommendations (and translations) that landed right on the mark.\\n\\nWe started with a couple of glasses of wine. They only serve Spanish wines but mine was a Rioja that was better than most cab sauv's I've had. We were then presented with two amuse-bouches. I don't remember what they were but it was a nice touch. We ordered a few tapas at a time, and they were brought out just as we finished eating the one before, hot and fresh from the kitchen. We had the Gambas al Pil Pil, Pinchito de Pollo, Txistorras de cerdo al Jerez, Croquetas de Verduras, Esparragos con Romesco, and one or two more off the special menu that I can't recall. All were delicious, even the croqueta, and I'm not a big fan of fried foods. For dessert we shared Natillas de Almendras and 2 decaf coffees. Yum. We finished the night with a 5 minute conversation with one of the owners, who was equally as charming as his wife. He deflected all of my praise toward his partner in the kitchen, clearly admiring his skill at perfecting his craft. \\n\\nDelicious food and drink, outstanding attentive service, inviting atmosphere, what's not to like?

For those who are unaware of such diamonds in the rough let me present to you, Andiamo Ristorante.  Upon entering the restaurant I was amazed to find a quaintly intimate dinning area that could have been taken straight from a movie scene. This Italian restaurant has a very classic appeal set to a mandolin based soundtrack.\\n\\nI have to admit it was somewhat difficult to make a decision on what to order because everything on the menu sounded wonderful.  As to not appear as indecisive as I was already feeling I ordered the Linguine Lucy Johnson. (Diced shrimp with cherry tomatoes, portobello mushrooms)  I'm not sure who this Lucy Johnson is exactly, but she must be a saint to have such a dish named after her because this dish was heavenly. Just like Andiamo's surroundings the food was absolutely delightful.\\n\\nThe over all experience was hands down 5 stars.  I would have loved to have stayed longer drinking more wine, but I knew it was time to gracefully make my exit when the mandolinist played the theme from the Godfather.

We ordered a cheese pizza and a pizza with many meats, as well as their grilled lamb, beef, and sausage bbq. This cheese pizza was amazing: the cheese was stringy, but not too much, had appropriate saltiness and creaminess; the sauce was tomato rich with the appropriate amount of herb-i-ness; and the crust was perfectly thin, had a great taste, texture, and was not left as an unloved handle on anyone's plate. I can't avoid comments that a pizza should consist of more than a single non-cheese topping: in my humble opinion this hides any short-comings in the pizza. There was no need to hide anything about this pizza. The best of the grill items was the sausage, resulting in fork prong hand attacks when I attempted to take the last piece. the beef was salted appropriately and a second favorite behind the sausage. The lamb was chewy (no fork attacks for that lone piece). CASH ONLY. Boston surly included for free, adding to the ambiance.

When the craving for that style of pizza hits, I'll drive halfway across town for it and be happy I did!\\n\\nWhy is Santarpio's so special? Well, first, most pizza in town is Greek. The crust is tasteless and doughy, the cheese is low-quality and congealed in a giant layer over the marinara. You can just peel the cheese off the top and there is the layer of marinara under it, which by the way, tastes terrible.\\n\\nEven the worst Italian style pizza, which is harder to find, is better than Greek pizza. In Italian style pizza, which some people also call New York Style, the crust is just right--pretty thin, but doesn't  need to brag about being thin like the gourmet places...it just is. The crust is just crunchy enough, with delicious marinara and gooey high-quality mozzarella in just the right proportions. So when you look at the slice you see spots of white and spots of red. This is the class in which Santarpio rules. Just rules.\\n\\nAnd then there's  frou-frou gourmet type \\"thin crust\\" type pizza. The crust is maybe even a little thinner than good Italian pizza and--in the best ones--may be yeastier and more flavorful. The style is a little different--proportions of ingredients may be a bit inventive depending on the chef and the sauce may vary--say fresh tomatoes instead of marinara. In this class, the best in town are Upper Crust (in Brookline and now other locations) and Sweet Tomatoes in Newton.\\n\\nI like the frou-frou stuff, but every now and then I'm jonesing for the best in working-class Italian style, and that's when I head to Chelsea Street.

If someone told me that I was disappointed because I hadn't ordered the right thing (and sorry, but lactose intolerance means no truffle mac n' cheese for me), I would believe them, but without an organizational push to what's good, or at least to what kind of meal -- sandwich? entree with sides? Italian? Mexican? Asian? -- I'll remain a skeptic.\\n\\nNow, to be fair, it isn't that bad. I had a burger which was entirely passable, the other dinners we had looked fine. The beer selection was actually surprisingly decent, and the seasonal flight (heffeweisens now) looked interesting. Service was prompt, even when it started filling up, although I hear that slips a bit when the bar is super crowded (later weekend nights, trivia night, big sports events). And maybe most importantly, it fills a niche in Porter that hadn't been served before. It's casual, but not somewhere to be embarrassed bringing a date. It's got a touch of class, but won't break your wallet. It's also fairly high capacity, which I'm sure is good for when it gets busier. All in all, I think I would usually choose nearby Christopher's over it, but that's me, and some people might dig the more put-together, more intentional, new-and-improved-freshman feel here."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"How did I not review here before??

Aside from being star-struck, i really, really enjoyed watching her mild and stress-free demeanor, while maintaining a smile at all times -- even when talking to her employees!! she totally changed the industry stereotype that one has to yell and curse in the kitchen in order to be successful (ahem, Ramsay...).\\n\\nin any case, see pics for dishes over the years (will have to dig out the older ones). all good stuff!"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I have been ordering from this place for 20 years. \\n\\nChicken tika masala. \\nSaag panneer. \\nKorma."},{"name":"Smokey Bones Bar & Fire Grill","address":"2200 Baltimore Reynoldsburg Rd","city":"Reynoldsburg","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for Mother's Day at my grandmother's request, she really likes this place and has bee coming here for quite awhile now! We came in around 6pm and they were packed! Which we already figured so was not surprised that we had to wait 15min. \\nCustomer service: 9/10- our waitress was helpful and attendant despite the other tables she had to waitress. She didn't rush off while we were ordering, she stayed to be sure of what we wanted or were interested in.\\nAtmosphere: 9/10- From the first time I've come I always thought their decorations were cool, they have signs hanging on the wall with funny little phrases. Directly when you come in is the check-in booth, look to the left and it's the seating area, while straight across is the bar area. Plenty of tvs at the bar area (few throughout the seating area) for game watching, etc. \\nFood: 5/10- The food is meh. I ordered the pulled brisket platter with French fries and broccoli. The broccoli was not very tender and soft like I like it. The brisket was nothing to jump about even with the option of different BBQ sauces! I also had a strawberry sangria which wasn't too bad but took awhile to get to the table. My sister and grandmother ordered a meal for two. It consisted of portioned chicken, wings, sausage, and pulled meat all on a table top grill. For $35 you'd think it was going to be at least halfway decent.....not. When they brought the grill out we were shocked at the amount of food that was given! For two it just wasn't enough, they would've been better off with the \\"feed three\\" grill option. My grandmother and sister both did not like the chicken, they said it was very dry. They however did ask for an order of chicken which I thought was better than most of the food we received, they were so good. \\nThree stars for the great service and atmosphere!

It's in the middle of the hustle and bustle of SoCo, so when we went right at 11:00 this Saturday, the line was already out the door and when we were finished eating it was wrapped around the building.  Luckily, they have a server for the line so you can enjoy a beer or shake while you wait.  Once we realized you could ditch the line and sit at the bar if spots opened up, that is what we did and I suggest you do too (if you're 21)! They're a craft burger bar, and while I got the classic burger, it was hands down one of the best I've ever had.  The three of us split some parmesan truffle fries and they were amazingggggggg!

It just felt that I am eating plain Naan with Garlic pasted with imitation butter at last minute.\\n\\nAll the dishes were not creamy enough. It is like taking a dish and diluted it with water before serving. The goat was terribly chewy and the chicken was bland and tough.\\n\\nI give it two stars is because it has a lot of vegetarian food to offer.
