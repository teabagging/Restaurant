Mac and Cheese was out of this world, and the rice close slaw, and the green beans were super as well! I got the chopped brisket sandwich (they ask chopped or sliced) with onions and pickles in the buttery potato bread bun. Words cannot described how epic this brisket was. Everything went so well together and the sweet sauce they have on each table was truly scrumptious. Wife got the turkey and that was an amazing experience as well.

I'm sorry to say it but, pizza in Portland is pretty awful. Being from back East, I have spent three years in Oregon trying to find some good East coast pizza. Signal station has it. Thin homemade crust, delicious sauce, not too much cheese; pick up a slice, fold it in half, put it in your mouth...and some grease should drip...maybe not healthy...but delicious. And for those of you out there who don't like the grease, use a paper towel. \\nSo, I have been going to signal station 2-3 times a month and have always been happy. Last night I called in my order and when I went to pick it up they were having some sort of trouble with their oven. They said that they thought they could fix it and offered me a beer while I waited. About 10 minutes later I was informed that the oven was not going to be fixed anytime soon but, I could take my pizza and bake it at home. So, I ended up with a free beer, half price pizza, and delicious pizza at home. They even kept my pizza on the pizza tray/rack for me and told me to return it when ever I'm in the neighborhood. One would never get that kind of service at Hot lips or Pizzacato. \\nThe only thing that I wish they had was Birch beer...it's pretty scarce in the Northwest....and there is nothing better than birch beer and pizza."},{"name":"Chicha","address":"136 E Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Breathtakingly tasty!

Next comes the \\"appetizer\\" ... a cheese fondue (several to choose from) served with fresh veggies and fruit. Lastly the entree (again a couple of options) ... we get the meat and seafood and cook it in the bouillon rather than the oil.

Located, naturally enough, in German Village just south of downtown Columbus, Schmidt's is just off the beaten path and can be slightly difficult to find if you don't know what you're looking for - but it's well worth the search.  German Village is one of Columbus's most interesting and attractive areas, and the Schmidt's building itself is a registered historical landmark.  When you do locate Schmidt's, parking may be difficult, as the lot directly next to the building is small and fills quickly, but there is another lot for further Schmidt's parking just to the East, across the street.\\n\\nInside, everything is decorated with an old German feel, from the wooden floors and thick wooden door at the entrance, to the bar with the taps in old \\"keg\\" facades, to the staff themselves, dressed in old-world German costume.  Due to it's popularity, Schmidt's fills very quickly, but the wait doesn't often get too long.  The popularity also means that the restaurant itself can be somewhat cramped - tables are very close together and servers may bump into you trying to get to their corner tables.  If there is a wait, and you need to kill some time, wander across the street to the fudge shoppe and take a look around - and maybe grab a free sample if you're lucky.\\n\\nThe menu offers a breadth of German cuisine, from schnitzels to spatzels to sandwhiches and, of course, sausages.  Schmidt's signature item is their Bahama Mama - a spiced sausage available in both regular (moderately spicy) and mild (not very spicy), but they've also won awards for their bratwurst, and serve an excellent garlic knocwurst.  The sausage sampler entree offers a half length of each and is a great way to get a taste of each - served with chunky applesauce and hot kraut.  If straight sausage isn't your thing, you can try the \\"Mama Ruben\\" - a Ruben with a Bahama Mama patty instead of corned beef (or pastrami), and excellent schnitzel as well.  Frequently Schmidt's has a buffet going, which offers all the sausages, some pasta dishes, potato salad, kraut and soups and salads - it's a smallish yet decent selection and a good price.  One thing not available at the buffet, however, is the excellent potato pancakes.  Either order them as your meal's side or as an add-on side - they're not to be missed.  To make them truly grand, try them with the fresh horseradish.  For dessert, well the obvious choice and specialty is the cream puff - ranging from mini cream puffs to jumbo cream puffs, there's a size available for everyone.  Vanilla is always available, and chocolate is frequent as well, but occasionally there are other special flavors... the double chocolate being a highlight.\\n\\nService at Schmidt's is most often excellent, though it can suffer slightly during fairly busy times.  Even when ordering the buffet, servers are very attentive to drinks and other needs, such as bringing extra buns and condiments on request.\\n\\nSchmidt's is a must-do for any fan of German cuisine, from the hardcore to the casual sausage eater.  It's a true Columbus landmark, one of the few remaining, with both the Kahiki and the Jai Alai being torn down for \\"progress\\".  The prices are great, the service is great, and the setting is great.  The location can be somewhat difficult - at one time there were two other locations, one on Henderson Road and one in Westerville, but sadly both of those have closed and only the original remains.  Thankfully the original seems to be going strong, and will hopefully continue providing incredible German food in a historical setting for years to come!"},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is the place that good for western people and Asians. The Asian dishes here are not traditional, but are successfully westernized. We tried scallion pancake, green curry lobster, pork spare ribs, dan dan noodles, double cooked lamb stirfry and lemon-ginger mousse for the dessert.\\nScallion pancake is unorthodox, but absolutely palatable. It is not deep fried, and the scallions are scattered at the surface of the pancakes. The fresh taste of the scallions neutralizes the slight oil taste in the pancake, perfect combination. \\nPork spare ribs is a sweet style dish. The pork ribs are slowly cooked. The meat and bones are apart. You can tear off the meat easily. This dish is the most recommended. \\nDan Dan noodles is over boiled. The noodles are too soft, but the overall taste is spicy and exciting.\\nThe double cooked lamb is not that good. It is way too sweet. The lamb itself is ambrosial, but the vegetables underneath are too sweet to eat.\\nGreen curry lobster is another main character. The green curry provides a spicy taste and fried rice cake comes inside the curry sauce.\\nLemon Ginger mousse is also recommended as dessert. Asian dishes are mostly oily. The sour lemon cream and sweet ginger candy completely obviate the oily taste. In addition, a homemade fortune cookie is added.

My faves were the crab croquettes (filled with lumps of crab meat) and the mushroom croquettes (they were so tasty!).  The dipping sauce that accompanied the croquettes was off the hook.  It had a wonderful smokey tomato flavor.\\n\\nSangria:  Let's be real.  Without proper sangria, a tapas place can never truly be a tapas place - even with amazing tapas.

The service was great, the chicken had an awesome scald to it, just the right amount of spice and a great batter.  The pieces were large and satisfying.  The cole slaw was awesome, and I have eaten my fair share of bad restaurant cole slaw, but this ranks in my top 3.  My friend had the potato salad which was also remarkable and the greens were delicious. However I was greatly dissappointed by the fried green tomatoes.  If you're going to offer fried green tomatoes, they need to be FRESH, not frozen and deep fried with a mechanically applied batter.  The crust was ok, but the tomato inside was mush.  Not a good selling point. If you cant offer firm fresh fried tomatoes, don't bother.  Parking downtown is an issue with any restaurant, so we hoofed it to Gus's but sat down quickly at 11:30.  The lunch rush was just hitting and we had to wait a while for the food.  By the time we left, about 12:45, the place was packed and out the door with a line.  There was a convention in town which might have added to the long wait time, I'm not sure.  One more point... In a city as concerned about recycling and not using non-degradable materials, I found it kind of off-putting that they use styrofoam plates, plastic eating utensils and cups.  At the prices they charge for chicken, they could afford washable plates, bowls, and flatware."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Loved the variety of dim sum style dishes offered here, and they were able to accommodate my friend's allergy to shell fish by making modifications to the dishes we ordered so that can he eat them.  \\n\\nEdamame Wasabi Potstickers - pan fried to a nice crisp on one side, and there was a nice kick from the wasabi.\\n\\nHakka Eggplant (Vegan Style) - eggplant was cooked well, making it soft without being mushy, and was tossed in a sauce that make the dish quite savory and delicious.\\n\\nThe Green Monster - a vegan salad made with pistachio lemongrass pesto, all the green things, wheatberries.  Loved this dish as the wheatberries were cooked to a nice al dente, a little chewy and firm.  Light and delicious.\\n\\nCrispy Spring Rolls - a vegan dish that was made with swiss chard, glass noodles, quince duck sauce.  Crispy, not too greasy.  Didn't take advantage much of the sauce, as the spring rolls themselves were tasty on its own from the well seasoned Swiss chard and glass noodles.\\n\\nSzechuan Dan Dan Noodles made with pork, pickled mustard greens, hot bean paste.  An unusual take dan dan noodles.\\n\\nServers were friendly and very attentive.

She has been back here for quite some time, and tried to find good Nepali food here, but I believe it has been harder than she expected.\\nI saw a Groupon for Gurkha, but it was sold out by the time I went to purchase it. I figured that was a good sign, so my sister and I decided to try them out... And boy am I glad we did!\\nFirstly, my sister and I are adventurous eaters. But, there are a few \\"North Americanized\\" items on the menu in case you aren't (ie there is a rendition of butter chicken and you can order it mild).\\nSecondly, vegan and gluten-free dishes are very well marked in case your dietary needs require them.\\nThirdly, the menu has a ton of wonderful sounding items on it. We were having such a hard time picking that we started off with some spiced tea (a lot like Indian chai) while we reviewed what we'd get. \\nWe got two appetizers. The first one was Taas- it's puffed rice mixed with lamb and herbs and spices. The flavors are great and a little acidic. That may not sound delicious, but that's probably because it's a combination we don't think of often in Western cooking. The Taas was phenomenal and I highly recommend it; I've never had anything else like it.\\nWe also ordered momos. They are a type of dumpling. We got the vegetarian momos, which I found to be quite good - and the sauces which accompanied them were amazing. I wouldn't order them again, however, because everything else was better and we ended up being stuffed, plus a ton of left-overs. Now, since I've never been to Nepal, I don't know how they stack up traditionally, but they tasted great and my sister said they were great too.\\nBy this time we had figured out what we wanted for our mains. We got gorkha khasi as well as tingmo on the side, and the lamb skewers. The tingmo was light and fluffy and great for eating the curry. The lamb was seasons and grilled perfectly.\\nOverall, this restaurant exceeded my expectations in terms of food quality, flavour, and quantity. I also adored the friendly staff. Our server was super upbeat and both my sister and I felt very comfortable at this establishment.

I've been to bertuccis a few times at this location and every time the servers were completely incompetent.  I'm almost positive that every single person that works there is intoxicated every time they come to work.  Very bad experience and the food is terrible for the prices they charge.  The caesar salad has way to much dressing, the pasta dishes are overcooked and somewhat burnt and the pizza seemed to be made sloppily and without care; the sauce wasn't spread onto the entire pizza and the toppings were far from evenly spread, to me thats the least you can do for a decent pizza. And I saw that they leave their pizza dough out in the open to dry for a long time, at least an for the hour that i was there, no wonder it tasted stale!!!! Also contrary to their claim it is not a brick oven pizza. I looked into the pizza ovens at one point and they are most certainly not brick ovens.  I worked in a pizza restaurant a long time ago, that had actual brick ovens, and these are definitely not true brick ovens.  From what I could see it appeared to me that they used gas instead of wood or other more natural elements to heat their ovens and from my limited knowledge of pizzerias that is definitely not the way to cook a good pizza.

All of it was very good.  The tacos were in won ton skins and tortilla chips (not the flimsy kind, but the crispy kind).  The slaw that was in the tacos were absolutely divine.  Then the chicharrones came out.  The dish looked like a pile of burnt dog poo set atop lettuce and tomatos.  So I made one of my friends take the first bite (as a good food taster should).  He said it was very tasty and I believed him.  After my first bite, I was in heaven.  Although it looked like crap, it tasted like marinated pork that had been cooked with a chimichurri.

Only 10 mins late. \\n\\nUpon entering the space an employee greeted me and I told her I was picking up the to go order. For some strange reason (and with a cross-looking expression) the words out of her mouth were, \\"Um, I was wondering if you'd be coming.\\" \\n\\nUm, lady, I am 10 mins late. And it is a to-go order. \\n\\nBad Attitude Barbara continues her schtick. I'm addressed a couple times in a sarcastic, saccharine tone. Am I in trouble for something?\\n\\nI ask if the food containers are labeled. \\n\\nHER: \\"Have you ever eaten with us before?\\"\\nME: \\"Yeah, the food is great.\\"\\nHER: \\"Well did they NOT label them?\\"\\nME: \\"Oh, I dined in. Sorry, just out of curiosity...\\"\\n\\nYikes.\\n\\nStill perplexed by passive aggressiveness and actual aggressiveness, I pay, take my food and leave. Halfway to the car I realize I've left behind my copy of the receipt which needs to be expensed later. I return and am greeted with a look of exasperation and the question, \\"Is there a problem?\\"\\n\\nNo, no. just left my receipt. Sorry for being born.\\n\\nSo here's the deal. I just wanted to pick up to go food and leave. Why did it require such sassiness and negativity? I'm sorry if you're hungover or your cat still hates you, but a basic tenet of your job is to be nice to customers. We tip you. We are your livelihood. I can't believe I even left a tip, though it's likely because I used to work in restaurants myself and still find it difficult to even come close to stiffing someone.\\n\\nI'd say it's definitely time for her and the manager / owner for a sit-down. This can't be good for business. Oh, and all those future lunch meetings that could have brought our company's dollars to Verde Cocina? Nope. Not out of punishment, but more because I don't want to interact with that woman again if I don't have to."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Really good really legit.

Half the employees at the Eola location appear to be stoned. The other half are hapless teenagers who treat the dining room like it's a basement den and the parents are on vacation. I've complained now, twice, to the Panera corporate website because whenever I go in there I have a bad experience.  They send me 15 dollars and nothing changes. So in an effort to convince them to get their act together, I've elected to publish these pretty godawful experiences on Yelp. \\n\\nOne day I am sitting there and an employee sits down next to me to have a loud and obscene conversation on his cell phone in the middle of his shift. Half the employees walk around the restaurant with hands-free pieces in their ears talking rather than working. They drink out of open cups in front of guests and don't change their gloves after handling food or themselves. I had a guy tie his shoe by placing his foot on the counter while he was taking my order, and then proceed to get me a bagel without washing his hands or putting on new gloves. The next time I go in, I can't sit down because there are multiple 4-top booths occupied by single employees who are sitting down texting and drinking soda, either on their breaks or waiting for their shifts to start. Either way, why are they there? Why aren't they in the back or outside where they aren't in the way? So much for prioritizing the paying guest experience. The last time I went there (today), my coffee is cold, over 2 hours old, and has weird flecks of whitish something-or-other (looked like flywings) in it. The managers appear so preoccupied doing the work that the staff seems incapable of doing that they aren't even paying attention to the lack of work ethic by their young and clearly dysfunctional staff. None of the coffee is refilled on a regular schedule like at other Parena locations I've frequented, and all of the various paper and sugar and whatnot is constantly out without employees restocking it. The dining room is a disaster at weird times of day (11 am after AM rush, 2pm well after lunch rush, 5 pm before dinner). The general attitude of the staff is not at all congenial or helpful. They sometimes make you wait for minutes while they talk before helping you place an order. I've been to few places as dysfunctionally managed as this location, and all of them were on college campuses. This one needs to be completely gutted. The staff is clearly full of bad apples and the management is either unwilling or unable to root out whatever the causes are that keep the staff acting so consistently underwhelming."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The actual lunch menu at Parish is drastically different from that shown online and includes a single vegetarian sandwich- eggplant.

They were cooked perfectly and to the right crisp. Next is the chicken. The chicken was so crispy and juicy, it was absolutely amazing. The fried chicken was at a great spice level as well, making it so flavorful in every bite. We also got the fries which were seasoned just right and we also got the Mac n Cheese.

The space is small and the wait long but the attitude and atmosphere are welcoming. The food is even more so. The open kitchen fills the small space with a wonderfully appetizing aroma that grabs hold of your senses and forces you to wait. The head chef was very personable and went out of his way to make our wait as comfortable as possible.  On this particular visit we had the good fortune of getting our seats within ten minutes (the benefits of showing up before 7 because by 8 the place was mobbed). We were immediately greeted by busy yet freindly waiter who proceeded to list the day's specials and was kind enough to make suggestions. We started with drinks. It should be noted here that the list of specialty drinks is quite robust but not displayed on the their website menu for some reason. If you love Mojitos  this is definitely the place for you as they have numerous variations. They also make a decent Sangria which i highly recommend. Wine is my thing, so i started with a moderately filled  glass of Malbec, recommended by the waiter. We opened our dining with these orgasmicly delicious bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. Its not on the website menu and i forget their name but i will never forget the taste! A perfect combination of flavor and texture. We then moved on to Arepas. The Domino was very nice though i still have no idea what palmizulia cheese is. The Reina Pepiada was ok, too dry and lacking avocado so i suggest trying something else. If you plan on sharing Arepas it should be noted that they are not easily cut and it may be wise for you to request they be served segemented. Also, these are basically sandwiches and should be eaten that way, try fork and knifing them and you are in for a mess. We felt ourselves filling up already so jumped to the main dish. I had the At√∫n. The serving was moderate in size, yet seemingly appropriate given what we had eaten thus far. The tuna was tender, flavorful and not overwhlemd by the sweet, delicious sauce that blended very nicely with the vinagrette dressing on the arugala. The fact that you are dining so close to others is not as uncomfortable as i at first thought. We were so absorbed by the food and converation that the proximity to other diners was a non-issue. However half-way through our dinner i got the sense we were being given the \\"here's your hat, what's your hurry\\" treatment when the waiter asked us if we were done when we were so obvioulsly not. Its somewhat understandable given the place was mobbed with people standing, some noticably uncomfortably, around the small bar awaitng a table. Overall, it was a very enjoyable and delicious experience. An experience that can only get better each time you dine there.

The service was the only redeeming quality about this place. The food was average at best.

The portions were very small... for example one dish had a teaspoon of ice cream to be shared by three people. \\n\\nI went with a group of 7 and the bill came out around $590 and we didn't have many drinks. I wouldn't mind the price if I was handed high quality food, but instead I was handed ingredients that you can find at your local supermarket for cheap. This was the first restaurant I visited in the United States after living in Korea for three months and I am embarrassed for the food in my country. I was getting dishes in Korea for $5 with more flavor and portions than anything out of the 14 concoctions that was handed to me at Barley Swine.\\n\\nHonestly I'm surprised at all the positive reviews.

Have been for almost 20 years, in fact, ever since high school, when cadets from the nearby Air Force Academy would try to flirt with me and my friends by sending us over pitchers of water (since none of us were old enough to drink. Clever the first time, but after that--couldn't they at least send a pitcher of Diet Coke? Or maybe one of those delicious Mountain High Mud Pies?). I pretty much always get the Clucks & Fries, a cuter name for chicken strips. So yummy. Occasionally I get the Crispy Chicken Burger--aka, Clucks & bread--but that's only when I'm feeling crazy.\\n\\nYes, this is a family-friendly joint. If you don't like that environment, you probably won't like Red Robin. But the food is solid. How can you not love bottomless fries? And steak fries at that? If you deny it, I won't believe you.\\n\\nNow, in terms of this particular location--I had an unfortunate experience a couple of months ago with my waiter. I put down $30 on a $21 bill. He took the bill and left...and never returned. I waited. And waited. And waited. I thought about leaving because I'm kind of passive that way, but my friend reminded me that it was ridiculous to leave a $9 tip on a $21 bill. So I waited some more. He never came over to check on us. I mean, usually, even if you've already paid and you're just hanging out talking, your waiter will come by and refill your water, you know? Not this guy. He disappeared into oblivion. Eventually, I had to stop someone else and ask her to get our waiter for us. Then, when he finally showed up and I told him I needed change, he said, \\"Oh! I already closed you guys out,\\" and hesitated like I'd say, \\"Never mind then.\\" But I didn't, so he relunctantly got my change.\\n\\nI disliked that experience. Intensely.

The sides were a disappointment... the mac n cheese was gritty KFC quality. The coleslaw was just a run of the mill kind scooped from a big tub.

My wife's dark meat chicken was good but almost a little too moist/greasy that  gave it a weird texture.

Having lived in Atlanta way back when the Blue Nile was the only game in town (I never went, being a bit more scaredy-cat about food than I am now), we'd heard that Atlanta's Ethiopian scene had exploded over the years.  Based on Ghion Cultural Hall's proximity to our hotel and the rave Yelp reviews, it seemed like an easy Ethiopian choice.\\n\\nFirst impressions were not too great, though.  Ghion is located on seedy Cheshire Bridge Road, nestled among some crummy-looking strip joints. We walked into the nearly empty, moribund front area--on a Saturday evening no less--and were seated in a stuffy, aquarium-like cubicle at a too-small table and waited on by a rather grumpy woman who did not appear to be Ethiopian.  Within a couple of minutes, however, one of the super-friendly owners emerged from the back, noticed our plight, and immediately led us down a hallway to a corner table inside the bright \\"cultural hall\\" at the back of the facility--the last unoccupied table in that big room--where a graduation party was in progress.\\n\\nThis was when things really picked up.  \\n\\nAt first we were a little apprehensive, thinking that these folks wouldn't be too happy about us crashing their scene.  (It looked like the party was being hosted by the family of an Ethiopian student, but the vast majority of the attendees were well-to-do Atlanta white folks.)  But after a couple of minutes, we realized that they weren't concerned about us at all, leaving us to enjoy this increasingly entertaining scene as flies on the wall.  After the party guests worked their way through their buffet dinner, with much table-to-table visiting and glad-handing, the staff did a fascinating Ethiopian coffee service that smoked up the room pretty good.  (One of the owners very graciously offered us some of the delicious coffee.)\\n\\nThen an actual party began.  The staff tuned the hall's giant television to a Youtube station playing Ethiopian music videos and soon cranked up the volume to club levels.  At first, the staff and other Ethiopians weren't too successful in getting the kids and their parents to dance.  But then a couple of brave white kids got up and joined the dance circle, and then a few more.  By the fifth or sixth song, just about the whole damn room was joyously throwing down on the dancefloor--Ethiopians, white kids and their parents, and even somebody's granddad who had to be helped to his feet and looked liked like he was about 85 years old.\\n\\nSo madcap and entertaining hi-jinks are sometimes afoot at Ghion Cultural Hall.  \\n\\nAnd what the hell--we had dinner, too!  Frankly, the food didn't quite live up to the festive atmosphere, although it was plenty satisfying and well worth the low prices.  Some of the veggie items lacked pop, and the lamb beg-tips, while flavorful, were a little overcooked and tough.  Maybe the kitchen was too distracted by the party buffet to focus on our order.  \\n\\nAnyway, we had a great evening:  If this visit was any indication, the warmth and hospitality of the owners of Ghion cannot be beat."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm a burger addict; I'd eat them every single day if I could.

They're focused just as much - if not more - on craft beer as they are on their burgers. The line starts near the door, but you don't place your order until you get nearly to the back of the space - passing the bar on your way. Twelve local, craft breweries on tap, most of which are available in Houston, but I was glad to see Austin natives Circle Brewing and Thirsty Planet, which are not. I was ignoring the menu because, out on the street, the Greek Burger had caught my eye - as it is wont to do - and not only did it promise lamb, feta, and tzatziki, but arugula, which has become something of an addiction of mine.\\n\\nThe line moves pretty quickly, but you don't grab a table until you've placed your order, and you don't place your order until there is a table ready for you. Sip on that delightful beer you ordered, make a new friend in line, or chat with the gregarious staff. When they're ready for you, they'll take your order and give you a table number. This system obviates the need to hover over tables like vultures, intimidating occupants to finish those last couple of fries and wrap up their conversation. That's just uncomfortable for everybody. \\n\\nThe hand-formed lamb patty on my GRK burger was a perfectly cooked on the medium side of medium-well, with juices running down my wrists, with crisp, refreshing cucumber, tangy pickled red onions which played off the feta cheese that gets you right in the salivary glands, peppery arugula, and a creamy tzatziki sauce all stacked on a fresh-baked bun. Gone are the days when your average Russet was a fit potato for French fries. Kennebec is the potato of choice here, lending a slightly nutty flavor, expertly fried with a soft interior and crispy, delicately seasoned exterior. A generic condiment seemed a sin on any part of this spread, but they do have chipotle ketchup and honey mustard back at the condiment bar. In fact, I was surprised to see the standard red ketchup and yellow mustard.

The chipotle ketchup was a really good compliment to the fries, giving a little smoke, and a little bite but not too spicy.\\n\\nOn my second visit, I tried the Buffalo Bill burger. It's a bison patty with blue cheese, bacon, Frank's hot sauce and sassy sauce. That burger was wonderful. It was the perfect doneness with a just a hint of pink and a really good flavor.

But as dessert or a decadent afternoon snack, accompanied by one of their excellent espressos, yes. Yes. Yes."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"To begin, San Francisco lacks a decent donut shop. Rolling Pin Donuts in San Bruno are good, but what Blue Star Donuts offers is a deviation from typical donut flavors; these deviant flavors were both adventurous and divine. \\n\\nI visited Portland for the first time Memorial Day Weekend, 2017. Upon arrival, the first thing my partner set out to do was find the best donut shop in town. He had heard through the grapevine that Portland is \\"famous for its donuts.\\" With a solid recommendation from our Uber driver, and after seeing the incredible line at Voodoo Donuts, we made our way to Blue Star Donuts.\\n\\nOn our first go, there was no line and still a full selection of donut flavors. This was around 2PM on a Saturday, and despite the later time, the donuts both looked and tasted fresh. We each opted to order our own flavor and split in half to share. I opted for the Vahlrona Crunch ($3), and my partner chose the Strawberry Rhubarb ($3), the latter of which I believe was a seasonal flavor. \\n\\nIf you're a chocolate lover, the Vahlrona Crunch flavor is for you. It's bitter, messy and melts in your mouth. I liked this flavor, but the chocolate was too strong for my personal preference. The Strawberry Rhubarb was not overwhelming in sweetness, surprisingly. I preferred this flavor greatly to the Vahlrona Crunch. Coated in granulated sugar, the Strawberry Rhubarb flavor tasted very much like a strawberry jam sandwich. I could have easily re-created this flavor and texture at home with store-bought bread and fruit preserve. The taste and texture was familiar, and took me back to my elementary school lunch days.\\n\\nAfter we finished our donuts, we headed off to continue our Portland adventures. If it were up to me, I would have been satisfied checking Blue Star Donuts off my Portland bucket list and calling it a day. Been there, done that. \\n\\nFor the next two days, all my partner spoke about was Blue Start Donuts. The taste. The texture. The flavor options. The smell. By the time we made our way back to Pearl District on Monday mid-morning, Blue Star Donuts had acquired a long line and less flavor options available. \\n\\nOur strategy the second time around was the same: pick two flavors, split in half and share. He ordered the classic Blueberry Bourbon Basil ($2.50), and I opted for the Hard Apple Cider Fitter ($2.75). We each took one respective bite of the donuts we ordered, and swapped. Although the Hard Apple Cider Fritter tasted like an apple pie, just chewier and softer in texture, the apple taste was too strong and the overall flavor too sweet. What I appreciated most about the Blueberry Bourbon Basil was that the bitterness and herbaceous flavors of the bourbon and basil combined dominated that of the fruity blueberry.\\n\\nWhat I think Blue Star Donuts does right in setting itself a part from other donut shops is the sustainable, ethical approach to their product. Blue Star Donuts makes it a point to hand make each batch of donuts from top-of-the-line ingredients.\\n\\nI lack a sweet tooth, so please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really know what I'm talking about. But if I were to go off of how many times my partner mentioned Blue Star Donuts over the course of the three days we spent in Portland, this place would receive a solid 6 stars."},{"name":"Nine Bar Espresso","address":"11 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"There's no such thing as too many independent coffee shops - so despite my deep love for another around-the-corner place, I'm thrilled to welcome Nine Bar Espresso to the neighborhood.\\n\\nTheir iced latte with almond milk is INCREDIBLE.

The appetizer sampler consisted of flavorless hummus, tiny dolmas, the worst tatziki we've ever had; tasted like straight sour cream. You can tell the pitas were days old. The lamb platters were dull, the salads were dry, and even the baklava was underwhelming. Growing up with a Middle Eastern grandma cooking these items, it was clear Phara's food is not authentic whatsoever.\\n-Food is overpriced. The entrees were $17-21.

Extensive drink menu with many variations on a theme - spiced red pepper salt mixed with usual rim salt on their margaritas as an example.  Nice touch.  Food menu rather limited and very little to interest a vegetarian or anyone who wants a vegetable beyond a wedge of iceberg lettuce or a fried tomato.  \\nThe place was packed, Saturday night, with music.  Some oddities:  When you enter the room layout indicates probably a hostess will seat you....many standing ahead of me picked up the same vibe.  When no one approached or even looked interested I approached a waitress and asked, \\"Hostess or seat ourselves?\\"  Seat yourselves was the advice.  I passed this along to the rest waiting and most foraged out to find a table.  Maybe a sign somewhere indicating the protocol?  \\nThe Public House, which is really more like a hall - think Elks Hall, has cement block walls, cement floor, wooden tables and chairs, a long bar with seating and another long counter running parallel to it, also with seating but everyone is looking in one\\ndirection so not much opportunity for interaction.  The area also has maybe 12 or so tables and chairs for dining and is exclusively for those 18 and older, as a small, blackboard sign notifies all in the area where you won't find anything telling you about hostess vs no hostess.  So the larger portion of the hall is given over to those both over and  under 18, with a preponderance of families, many with pre-schoolers and even infants in tow this Sat. evening.\\nThe noise, pre-music was deafening.  Not the gentle hum of genial conversation but a cacophony of mind numbing babble aided by the over-excited screams of toddlers.\\nOn the plus side, the wait staff was amazingly efficient, quick, accurate and pleasant given the crowd, the noise and the generally chaotic scene.\\nNot my cup of tea (or margarita) at all but if you want a place you can take the kids, like meals heavy on the meat, and reasonable prices, this may be the place for you."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I am on a never-ending quest to find the perfect burger and so far Hop Doddy is the winner.

At most places it is impossible to order a rare burger and actually get a rare burger but at Hop Doddy they get it right. When you add that to the fact that they have great toppings, good quality meat and a soft, freshly baked bun, you get one amazing burger. Their fries are pretty good too and are even better with their green chile queso.

I wouldn't come here just for the beverages but it's a nice addition to the food. I also appreciate that everything is pretty reasonably priced here.

The donuts were DELICIOUS. We made ourselves pleasantly but sickly full. The one thing I will say is that the counter staff were a little abrupt (when my boyfriend pointed above the donut he wanted, the cashier snapped at him to keep his finger below the glass...ok, but maybe they should enclose the display donuts with a glass lid then) and there aren't many chairs for customers to sit in and enjoy their donuts with any comfort.

I think I will lovingly call it HD. \\n\\nI went with a friend who had also never been before. I was a little confused at where to go when I first walked in because you order by the kitchen and it is in the back. I think it works great, it's just not apparent right off the bat that you order at the counter and seat yourself. \\n\\nAnyway, we went half-seys on the Llano Poblano and the Magic Shroom burger and got an order of fries. Food came out promptly, hot and fresh. They have a nice selection of sodas on tap and an awesome array of sauces with little twists on the classics. The horseradish honey mustard sauce was our favorite and was so yummy to dip fries in. I love the no nonsense way they serve their food; on a mini cookie sheet with a paper liner on it. Paper towels conveniently located right on the table. Just the perfect set up to be all about the food, and this place totally is. \\n\\nBoth burgers were delicious and awesome. Full of flavor with really nice touches, like on the shroom burger the goat cheese was rich and creamy and you just wanted to keep eating it forever. On the poblano burger the bacon along with the roasted peppers was such a nice combo in your mouth. I think at a normal burger place we would've given up without finishing all of our food but not only did we eat both burgers but also every last crumb of fry. YUM! \\n\\nWe also both commented on how we couldn't wait to try some of the less traditional burger options next time we came like the ahi tuna burger or a salad.

My salad and pizza came in a timely manner, but my husband's spaghetti never came. He then told the waiter to give us our check and deduct his order since it never came. The waiter was nice and apologized and came back with his ordered all boxed in so we could take it home and said that he should be able to waive the whole check. Then he came back charging us $7 for my salad. We thought it was cheesy for them to charge us anything after this horrible experience. The pizza was ok, the salad was nothing to brag about, the dressing is just balsamic vinegar with olive oil, and the spaghetti was disgusting. There was no sauce!!

They probably would try to subtly hint to us that it's time for us to leave by asking \\"Is there anything else?\\" or even dropping off the check.  What Barcelona did instead was the manager came over, sat next to us, had a 2 minute conversation with us asking how our meal was and came clean about the fact that they had another reservation coming in and asked if we could move to another table (without mentioning a word about how long we'd been there).  They offered to buy us a round of drinks AND give us a free desert for doing so.  It might not sound like much, but I felt like they treated us with such dignity and respect, which is not all so common in restaurants.\\n\\nWe declined the dessert (we were stuffed from the delicious food), but they brought out their best desert anyways.

It was renovated in the last 5 years or so, and the interior is well kept, clean, and comfortable.  It's a big dark, especially on the bar side though not to the point of distraction.

I was really impressed with their organization - as we were waiting in line, a waitress asked us if she could get us something to drink.  As we were starving, we ordered a milkshake to help tide us over.  The raspberry milkshake was excellent - I do not think that I've had a better milkshake in Austin.  I'm picky about milkshakes - I think that enough milk should be added so that you can actually drink it rather than eat with a spoon and this one fit the bill plus they make their own ice cream on site. Then as we were closer to actually ordering, another waitress asked the number of people in our party and assigned us a table so that we were ready to be seated after ordering. Despite being packed, the actual wait to get food after ordering was on the typical side - about fifteen minutes.  \\nWe shared a Magic Shroom burger and a large order of fries.  The person who took our orders was kind enough to offer to have the burger cut in half and made sure that there were two of the metal trays that the burgers are served on so that we could each have one.  The Magic Shroom burger is half pound burger with goat cheese, sauteed mushrooms, pesto, onion and tomato.  The flavors were excellent together and the burger was juicy but didn't fall apart in my hands.  The fries were thin, crisp and seasoned with parsley, salt and pepper - just the way that I like them.  We were impressed with their condiment bar - sweet and dill pickles, chipotle ketchup, bbq sauce and my favorite sauce of the night - honey mustard horseradish sauce.  I could not get enough of the honey mustard horseradish sauce - perfect to dip your fries into.

I love the aatish khumb, which is a mix of vegetables (mushrooms, onions, tomatoes) with a spice mix (their website says it's pickled spices). It's something I have never had at other Indian restaurants and it's been my favorite choice both times I've come. You also can't go wrong with the saag paneer or the chicken tikka masala either. Both of those are pretty standard for Indian restaurants, but I really enjoyed the flavor here. One of the best things with the lunch buffet is that they bring you baskets of naan to go with your meal as well. I pretty much ate my weight in naan, which is not the worst thing. The service both times has been good and the place is very clean. Also, pro-tip: right now, if you check in on the Yelp app, they have a 15% off coupon.

After being advised by the waiter that the tasting plate would be determined by the the wine we selected, we chose a bottle of  Pinot Nero. Had we known what was coming, perhaps we would have chosen a white wine instead. What started off with a selection of cured meats, followed by a rich, but delicate and tasty cheese souffle, more meat and cheese dishes began to follow. By the time we reached the poached pears and lemon cream dessert, I felt a little ill. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, each dish, on it's own, was lovely. The rabbit wrapped in prosciutto with pork belly, carrots and lentils was lovely, although the pork belly was a tad dry. The pasta dishes were also beautifully balanced. But all of the above, and more, in 7 courses, was just a bit too much. Usually when you get the tasting menu, there's a complimentary balance that leaves you full, but in a pleasant way. This time around, I left feeling full but sickly from too much meat and cheese and overall richness.

The grits as a side item are heavenly as well. I've had the tea here which was good and not too much of an extensive selection though. There are complimentary mimosas on the weekend which you can't beat.\\n\\nThe prices are very reasonable for what you get. The service can be slow although I went as recently as yesterday for Sunday Brunch and our food arrived in 20 minutes while some friends of ours who sat a nearby table who arrived earlier waited 1.5 hrs before their food arrived. I know management is aware of the service issue and may be working on improving the wait times for food. \\n\\nThe waitstaff could use some improvement. They sometimes seem really clueless about customer service almost like it's their first day waiting tables (although I see all the time) each time I go there.\\n\\nThe place is small with indoor & outdoor seating and quite cute & quaint.

I realize that this is unfair to Nora and Michael and need to give them their due rave review.  Their breakfast tacos are most excellent.  They are not greasy.  In fact, if you're health conscious you can order egg whites, and whole wheat tortillas, and whatever healthy items you want on the tacos.  They have the best migas tacos or migas I have had in Austin.  I have to admit I am more of a salsa connoisseur and love their salsa.  If you like spicy ask for the green salsa.  I like both green and red salsas as the red is very garlic and onion-y.   Oh, and if you are pinching pennies or watching what you spend....or just frankly refuse to spend dinner prices for breakfast tacos this place is also reasonably priced!!!

Shane had warned us about the wait time, so we planned ahead - there was a bar within walking (or waddling distance in my case) from Barley Swine, so we kicked it there. After my husband and friend had a few drinks (and water for me), we got a text telling us our table was ready, I think we waited about 45 minutes. \\nWhen we arrived, we were sat at a table that had one person eating by himself and one other couple. Communal sitting isn't our favorite, even less comfortable when you are 9 months pregnant, but it wasn't terrible. Our waitress was very nice and seemed to know every detail about the menu items and drinks. She was able to choose a nonalcoholic, fruity drink for me, and helped my husband and Shane choose the beers they wanted to complement their courses.  \\nWe made all of our small plate selections, but (at least for my husband and I who hadn't been there before) were surprised by the fact that they select which items come out first, but it's best to be left up to the experts, so whatever.\\nEverything we had was FANTASTIC. We ended up ordering a second of one of the desserts because it was so freaking good. The manager came over and chit chatted with us, he was very friendly and seemed to be the cherry on the cake in regards to the experience. \\nOur only issue: ordering for 3 people was AWKWARD. My husband and I wanted to split everything we got and Shane wanted to order plates for himself. What ended up happening: we were told that we had to split each plate with all three people and would only receive 1 plate at a time for our group. Each plate we received contained 2 servings, so we had to try to figure out how to divide the 2 servings between 3 people, which was very difficult when each plate contained food that was cut into 2. It totally baffled us that we had to do this and weren't allowed to order separately. \\nThe bill was to be expected no complaint there. Nothing was over spiced, under spiced, everything was cooked to perfection, and everything was totally flavorful. If it can satisfy a pregnant woman with crazy cravings and tastes in food, it's got to be delicious. I think with beer included, we paid somewhere between $200-$300 + tip. \\nI am only giving Barley Swine 4 stars due to the food splitting dilemma, everything else was divine. \\nIn short: go with a crowd containing even numbers, expect to wait and have a waiting backup plan (there are a few places within walking distance to hang out at until your table is ready), prepare to sit next to strangers if you have a small party, look at their menu on-line to get an idea of what your dinner will cost (don't whine later about it being too expensive - know what you are walking in to or choose a cheaper restaurant), prepare to be around (even surrounded by) hipsters, remember that the menu items are small, but that if they can fill up a pregnant woman, they are still reasonable; and first and foremost, remember that this isn't your typical restaurant, so be more open minded about the experience and differences from other restaurants."},{"name":"Chicha","address":"136 E Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We went to Chicha for their Dine Out Vancouver menu.

She was extremely snarky throughout the whole evening and I don't think she smiled once, from the beginning.  She also had a terrible attitude with routine annoyances like splitting up the bill/when their debit machine didn't work.

The long wait times were expected and after being told that we would need to wait an hour for a table, I figured we'd go to the bar and have a drink, no big deal. It took a while to get a seat and once I sat down I felt like I was constantly being rushed by the bartender to finish and get up. My boyfriend and I each had a glass of wine and asked for a cheese plate. We waited for ten to fifteen minutes, during which time a separate bartender came by and asked if we'd been helped for food. We told her we had, but thank you. Five minutes later, still no food. The second bartender came back and double checked that we had, in fact, ordered something. We figured that we'd try again with the cheese plate and she put in the order again. When the cheese finally arrived, it arrived sans bread. So, we had to stop the wait staff and get bread. And then we had to stop a bartender to ask for some oil to dip the remaining bread in after the cheese was finished. Meanwhile, the waitstaff was rushing and clamoring around and the bartenders were all over the place. At that point I was honestly ready to get my check and head out. Everything felt rushed; I felt like I was just one of a million customers being processed in and out of the restaurant. My boyfriend convinced me to stay... so we did for three tapas plates. These came out much faster than the forgotten cheese plate. The mushroom dish with goat cheese was very tasty. We also had a steak dish and the beef empanadas. Neither wow'd me, but neither were bad. The portions were surprisingly small for tapas, even smaller than one would expect for small plates. The prices were on the high end, but not unreasonable.\\n\\nLooking back, I wonder if going on a less busy day and sitting at a table, rather than the bar, would have improved my experience. Much of my distaste with Barcelona has to do with the hectic/rushed feel, inconsistent service, and \\"too cool for you\\" atmosphere. Perhaps a different day, different staff, different seating location would have changed my opinion. I would not be opposed to going back again, merely to test this theory, but if this experience were repeated, it is unlikely I would return for a third time.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nUpdate: 3/5\\nI was contacted by the assistant general manager of Barcelona after writing this review. He wrote me a very kind, very thoughtful and apologetic response. I have a lot of respect for them reaching out and caring about the feedback that was given. He invited me back (and although I have not yet returned, I do intend to) and I was very impressed by their overall response, enough so to increase my review by a star.

We were paying separately, but the way she rang us up we had to wait till the 3 of us were through ordering then we had to go one by one back up to her to pay our total. Does that even make sense the way I typed it out? Yeah, that's how weird it sounded to us.\\n\\nWe were in line maybe 10-15 minutes with 2 groups in front of us. By the time we finished ordering, the line was basically to the door. Timing was impeccable.\\n\\nI'm not quite sure what the servers do besides ask if the food is good. Seriously, they didn't do anything else besides that. Oh and also, they are freakishly fast at taking your tray away. I was facing the window, but not 10 seconds after I finished my last bite, a guy was taping my shoulder asking if I was through. Lisa B. still had a bite of her burger IN HER MOUTH when guy took her tray.

We called just before leaving our residence (5 minutes walk away) to check on wait time. Rafiki said it didn't take reservations, but there probably wouldn't be a wait. \\n\\nFalse. We showed up and had to wait 20 minutes. Which is fine - we grabbed drinks and sat at the bar for a little - but it felt like we were potentially led astray. We also ordered sweet potato fries at the bar, though, which were quite good. Could have been more crispy, but were well-seasoned and well worth it.\\n\\nWe got a great little booth for two by the window. My boyfriend had the ravioli, which he felt was undercooked on some of the edges. I chose to have a salad as a main - it was definitely large enough, although I prefer more complex salads, whereas the arugula and vinegrette got a little monotonous after a few bites. \\n\\nThe food was more expensive than I think it's worth, although it was decent. The ambiance was nice, but nothing notable. The staff is still evidently learning the menu, as my boyfriend asked what a certain coffee was, and the waitress had no clue. Rafiki is still on its learning curve; while the food was okay, it didn't merit the price, and I'll only be back for maybe a drink and definitely for the sweet potato fries."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've been to Myers and Chang a couple times earlier this year and was excited to go back with family.

Only on certain days only certain months, certain hours, and so on...basically not for certain. The story goes that Speed (somewhere between 80 and best guess) is retiring from the calling which he and his cart have responded to since 1975. That is to build a better hot dog. I was on my way to a lunch of oysters at B&G and I though, perhaps an app? The stars aligned, I turned in Newmarket and entered the Speed Zone. No line. Just Speed standing outside and two new trainees on the inside cooking Pearl Franks (the big ones) first marinated in cider then grilled over charcoal. A crispy burned outside and a perfect large split top to hold it. The cook cuts the top of the dog with a knife and in goes traditional condiments (relish, mustard, onions, ketchup), or Speed's barbecue sauce, or chili. Even a special blend of mustards. I stood out there with my partner in crime and ate the over-sized greasy and guilty pleasure. Delicious. Maybe too good. I added some of the \\"Dirty Dick's Hot Sauce\\" on the counter to the chili and onions on one half with BBQ sauce on the other. Should hot dogs be this good?

I've had much better Chicken N' Waffles for way cheaper.  \\n\\nThe Chicken was tender and juicy but it just lacked that pop of seasoning I expected from similar chicken places.  Mostly an after taste of peppercorn and crunchy breading.  It is peculiar they chose to use white meat chicken tenders vs dark meat.  The waffles were slightly above lukewarm and a bit bland IMO.  I was hoping for some flavoring, vanilla of some sorts.  I went on opening day, opening hour, so the lukewarm waffles were a bit of a shocker.  \\n\\nI love the concept but not a big fan of the price.  Even if it was priced half I'd much rather get myself 3 pieces of chicken tender, waffle mix (or cinnabonwaffles in waffle iron), and maple syrup at Publix  and still have money to spare.  Nothing bad to say about the sides since they were very tasty.  Chicken N' Waffles + grits + fried okra + cornbread + root beer came out to $24!!!!!!!@$@!$!#  Mind you I am a big fan of 4 Rivers too, mainly because there is not much competition for good BBQ but chicken places are a dime a dozen.  The atmosphere and the way it operates was efficient and unique.  I loved the ambiance/theme of the restaurant.  Even though I loved the atmosphere and southern comfort food sides, it will not be on my list of regular visits.  \\n\\nKeep in mind I only had the Chicken N' Waffles, other dishes may have been better"},{"name":"Oaks Bottom Public House","address":"1621 SE Bybee Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"When it comes to beer selection, Oaks Bottom never disappoints.

When the serving staff (bless their hearts) took the complaints of no fewer than 15 of us huddled in the back room to the group, they were yelled at.\\n\\nAll I can guess is that getting drunk and watching football is more important than the comfort of the customers at Cherrywood.

Expectations set low, we walked up to the door. I noticed the logo and immediately thought we were stepping into a franchised joint, so the expectations went a little lower, until I started to take in the exterior decor. Plants, eclectic furniture. I thought that was interesting. I couldn't see through the frosted glass, but I had pictured the inside of a Subway in my head.\\n\\nSPOILERS:\\n(I feel I should mention that because the reveal and challenge to my expectations was the fun part)\\n\\nOnce inside it was a slow reveal. Eyes immediately drawn to the menus on monitors, seemed pretty standard for a fast food place, but the graphic design was really tight. Then I started noticing things, the mural with Dali, Warhol, other celebs and artists, then a set of ropes suspended from the ceiling, my eyes followed those down to a couple of chairs. Swings. Ok. I noticed that no two pieces of furniture were the same. Touchscreen ordering, board games, knick knacks. When everything came into view I really had to kick myself for setting my expectations so low. I dug the look of this place. \\n\\nBut I wasn't there for interior design. My stomach growled to remind me that I was there for some grub. I ordered a Mother Clucker, some waffle fries and an iced tea (which ended up being a Thai iced tea, not quite matching the image on the menu). Total was $20.\\n\\nChicken, egg, and sriracha mayo worked well, the waffle was a little dry, but tasty. Maple batter worked well, chicken was moist. Good stuff. Waffle fries are waffle fries. \\n\\nIt's a pretty inviting place, so we hung out there for a few hours. Ordered a beer, a tripel, a little soapy smelling, honey sweet with a citrus aftertaste, has a kick to it, like brandy.\\n\\nSo, on leaving, I saw the Factory banner outside and went back in to ask about that. The woman working said that they had just changed their name to Wild Chix after the success of adding chicken and waffles to the menu. I liked the branding clash and the perception shift, so I'm kind of hoping that they don't alter their eclectic garage sale decor and add a bunch of sad, generic booths with tables. I mean, it would be practical, as dining space is a little hard to find there, but I like a challenge.\\n\\nIt's fun. Don't over think it.

Blue Star gets a Golden Star for being more of an artisan pastry.  Yes the other one is artistic in a fun youthful way.  Blue Star is more refined and sophisticated.  All of the doughnuts start from the same base before they are given character and dressed in a glaze or glazed and filled.  So the South of France brioche style dough is the base using cage free eggs, sustainable bread flour and European butter.  There is careful thought put into choosing the ingredients.  The artistry in the glaze and fillings are also done in exquisite workmanship . There's an art form being done in the kitchens here.  Here's the attention to detail worth the $3 pastry. \\nFruit glazes of Passion Fruit Cocoa Nib, Maple or Lemon are made with fresh fruit and powdered sugar not processed syrups.  The Vanilla Custard, Mousse, Pistachio Cheesecake fillings are made on the stove top.  Not from a can.  I love Blueberries so I tried the Blueberry Basil & Bourbon glaze which they use a splash of Bulleit Bourbon.  Good quality Bourbon.  One bite and I was like \\"Now that's a doughnut!\\" It's not sugar on sugar on sugar type of deal and given a quirky novelty name.  It's a well-made pastry!  I would of never thought to mix fresh blueberries, basil and Bourbon together.  But it works!  Next visit I'm going to try the Cointreau Cr√®me Brulee that has a torched sugar top that offers that light Cr√®me Brulee crisp when you bite into it and it is filled with a house made Vanilla Custard and a Cointreau syrup sweetened with Madagascar Vanilla Beans.  I got lucky when I walked in just a few people enjoying their donuts and no one in line.  So I got to chat with the workers and take my time ordering.  The next morning there was a long line out the door and I was glad I was not standing in it.  Do you see the difference now?  Blue Star you get the Gold Star!

As a fan of the fluffiness of more traditional scallion pancakes, I wasn't wowed by their crispier take on the dish, but that was probably the only down-ish point of the meal. The fresh rolls were good, and both large dishes we ordered were excellent. The surf & turf black pepper noodles had a ton of flavor, perfectly-cooked steak, and just the right amount of spice. I also liked that the shrimp were de-tailed already. My wife ordered the Indonesian fried rice. I absolutely loved her dish, as well, and ended up eating much of it because she found it just a bit too spicy.

What I do still love, though (or DID still love - past tense after today) was their chili dogs.  I really have to be in the mood for a hot dog, though - hence my defection.  But today I was in the mood.    \\n\\nThey USED to serve the chili dog on a flat'ish roll - that had been buttered and toasted on the grill.  The frank itself was huge and a foot long (I think).  It was topped with chili - with actual huge chunks of ground beef and big plump kidney beans.  It was a thing of beauty.  I'm uploading two old pictures I found on the internet. I was also a big fan of the Fudd fries and the milkshake was one of the best kept secrets in Cobb county.  Creamy, delicious and large enough for two to share AND still have leftovers to fight over. \\n\\nBut I digress.  Back to the hot dog  Or the unreasonable facsimile of a hot dog I got today. \\n\\nWhat I got today was a thin, slightly crunchy hot dog bun. It appeared to have been toasted in an some sort of oven (hence the crunch).  The frank was significantly smaller.  But what really did me in was the 'chili.' If you've ever had or seen Castleberry's hot dog 'sauce' - then you will can envision exactly what they topped my hot dog with today.  It had the consistency of vomit. \\n\\nI had actually called in my order.  Sidebar - had to call 3 times - each time hanging up after holding for more then 4 minutes each time - before I could actually get 'Dwayne' to take my order.  (After all that - imagine my surprise when I go there and the place was nearly empty and not even one person was in line in front of me.  I guess I'd just missed the lunch rush at 12:52pm.) I was in a bit of a rush to get to my next get, so when I took a look at my order - I was pretty sure it was going to be awful - but I didn't have time to ask them to make something else - so I paid for my food and left.  \\n\\nWhile trying to exit the parking lot - anyone that knows this plaza knows its a nightmare to exit - I popped the lid again and bit into a delicious \\"looking\\" french fry - and it was unmistakenly undercooked.  Is there anything worse than expecting a hot, tasty perfectly seasoned french fry - then biting into a still firm, undercooked potato? Blech!  I still wasn't ready to throw in the towel.  So I took a bite of the dog.  It was cold.  Alright.  Screw this. I'd had enough.\\n\\nI almost ran over a pedestrian, turning that car around.  I went back in and asked for a refund.  Dwayne, the manager, did not ask me what was wrong.  He did not ask me if he could prepare anything else (not that I had time to wait at this point).  Even though he didn't ask - while he was processing the refund - instead of standing there mute - I attempted to tell him that the hot dog was cold and some of the fries were undercooked and what he did is interrupt and talk over me while I was speaking and say \\"Yes ma'am. I apologize\\" in a very sing-songy, condescending voice.  While at the register, I didn't raise my voice and I made sure I was speaking in a calm, non-agitated manner.  My only regret is that I returned it before I had the presence of mind to snap a photo.  So the only picture I can provide here is one I found on the internet.  Even this photo doesn't accurately portray the monstrosity they served me today. \\n\\nAnother thing I should add - the space cadet manning the cash register - with the two ridiculously long, ridiculous looking 'pig tails' or 'pony tails' or whatever hip new name they have for them now.  Not only was it not 'a good look' but it was not sanitary.  She actually was wearing them in front - so instead of hanging down her back, the were thrown over each shoulder hanging down to her boobs.  Management shouldn't even let her wear her hair that way when she's around food.  Seriously.  Aside from the her appearance - I'm referring to her as a space cadet because she barely acknowledged me - except to collect payment - and even then I had to ask her to repeat herself twice.  Open your mouth and ENUNCIATE please. \\n\\nI won't ever be back.  And to think - just last year I actually emailed the corporate office to give Kudos to an employee and rave about the food.  My what a difference a year makes . . .\\n\\nAs always - even though I'm no longer a fan -  I want to end this review on a positive note. That weird sour smell that used to hover around the entrance is gone.  And the chefs looked very professional, well groomed and wearing classy looking chef attire - almost what you'd expect at some sort of five star joint.  They smiled and nodded at me as I waited on my refund.

I had three small plates which were all stellar. Potato chips with Gorgonzola, best ever. Artichoke and Olive Ravioli, and finally mussels with white wine. strawberries and serrano peppers. The only dish that was sub-par was the fettuccine with spring vegetables... just a bit boring.  The check was VERY reasonable, especially given the 50% Scout Mob.

It is the \\"see and be seen\\" element.  That's what Hopdoddy is good for.  I went at 3:30 on a weekday so I could try the food without waiting in line and that plan worked.  I had the Classic - ordered medium and served very well done.  The burger nearly beat me to my table PROVING that the patty was pre-cooked.  There was a meager gram of thin sliced rings of yellow onion.  The largest ring had been the outer-most ring of the onion which made it fibrous and indelicate to eat.  One 2\\" diameter slice of tomato with another chip of tomato and a nice piece of leaf lettuce.  The bread was phenomenal but the burger was flavorless and devoid of seasoning.\\n\\nMy advice to Hopdoddy, based on the complaints here and my experience - just drop the pretense of asking how you want the burger cooked.  Cook them all medium to medium-well.  Get good at that and just tell customers that's how it is.\\n\\nBack to the see and be seen - you can't get much more electric than South Congress.  This place is vibrates with a constant 60 hz hum of sexual potential.  It is a pagent of hipsters and hotties, soccer moms and tattoo canvases.  Hopdoddy's floor to ceiling front and side wall of glass is perfect for the main attraction.  The square concrete entrance feature bisected by the glass wall is marvelous.  If I ever build a commercial space I'm totally stealing that element. \\n\\nI am past the see and be seen stage of my life but I'm glad to know it's being done well.  For that I give Hopdoddy 5 stars.  For the food I give them 2 stars and because the food comes first I average that to 3 stars.

It's definitely a feel good atmosphere where before you know it, you may have consumed more alcohol than you intended.  \\n\\nThe service was great - friendly and efficient and our bar tab was totally reasonable.  \\n\\nThe Local will now be one of my \\"let's meet up for a beer\\" recommendations."},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"The delivery was quicker than Seamless indicated but otherwise this was disappointing.

The location was great and it was easy to get a table for two inside. The outdoor spots were all taken on a beautiful June night. The wine list was good and with a nice variety of wines and price points. The service was prompt. One of the waiters was pouring a bubbly ros√© next to us and gave us a taste when we asked about it even though we ended up ordering a different bottle. The complimentary bread came piping hot to the table. All of our tapas were prepared well and did not pale too much in comparison with tapas we've enjoyed in the actual Barcelona in Spain. The ham and manchego croquettes were delicious as were the piquillo peppers. The best item we ordered was the hangar steak. The only negative was the noise level. The tables are close to each other and the music volume is loud, forcing one to raise the volume of the conversation .

Apparently now you have to get a table number from someone before ordering. How about a sign or maybe someone greeting me at the door?\\n\\n2. The 2-top at the open side of the bar is the WORST table ever. There is a constant rush of servers running past to put in orders at the terminal on the bar corner. To make things worse, the bar guy was sweeping the floor and mopping while I was eating. The mop bucket was about 2 feet away from me and the smell of bleach made it difficult to eat my meal. On top of that - he came really close to touching me with the wet mop a few times. \\n\\n3. What are all these employees doing? Everyone in the place looks busy as all get out, but no one gave me any service aside from taking my order and delivering my food. No one stopped to ask how my food was or anything else.

I kind of wish they'd just stayed as The Factory instead of rebranding... but what do I know? I accidentally went in the completely wrong door, so be aware of that. You can also only order through the tablets next to the counter, which I don't mind, but was unexpected. The food is made fresh so it does take 15-20 minutes to come out, but everything I had was super tasty. I also had a coffee and a matcha latte.

The hand washing station in the middle of the patio is a great touch and most practical since for me it just does not feel right to eat this food with utensils. The whole staff was so friendly and genuine.\\n\\nI got the vegetarian platter which had about ten different items, each of which was delicious and uniquely spiced. In the middle of the plate was a field greens salad with a light sort of vinaigrette dressing. I usually would not think such a salad to be exceptional but it was so refreshing in combination with the various warmly spiced bean and veggie dishes. It was served with several roles of perfect injera bread. The veg platter was really enough food for two but it was so good that I got through most of it on my own. My date enjoyed the Chicken Tibs which was beautifully prepared. She is not an injera eater so she had rice which also looked great. \\n\\nWhere I've been critical of a reviewer or two for writing a critique about an Ethiopian restaurant when they do not like injera, I would say that this is the place to go if you want Ethiopian food but have someone in your party who does not eat injera or is not a big fan of Ethiopian. This is not to say that I would consider Desta any less \\"authentic\\" (like I really know or care what that means anyway) than any other Ethiopian restaurant, just that they have added options on their menu to suit a broader range of tastes.\\n\\nThis is a charming and odd in the best way place that serves amazing food.

I went for the \\"Primetime\\" burger which was Texas Akaushi beef, Brie Cheese, Truffle Aioli, Arugula, Caramelized Onions, Steak Sauce. That stuff could've been served in a boot and I would've eaten it. But no. It came on a pillowy, buttery, soft, delicious, lightly toasted (feel free to stop me) bun. It could not have been more perfect. And what was chic about the presentation was how the burger was served alone on parchment paper on a small silver tray with only a knife (as if I was going to actually cut it in half and eat it civilly. Not a chance). I also went for the parmesan truffle fries which were just wonderful. Parmesan cheese and parsley/chives(?) covered the fries and they were served with a truffle aioli which I could eat on anything forever. I even asked for a second serving because it was the necessary and I needed each fry to be covered in truffle aioli. \\n\\nWhat completed my meal was the cold schooner of Bucket Head IPA that paired perfectly with the American meal I devoured.

It's good Indian food, and this is coming from somebody who knows good Indian food. The naan was slightly different than I'm used to -- it was smaller and thicker and had sliced onion rather than diced, but it was still delicious and perfectly cooked. Soft and not burned. The onion was cooked INSIDE the naan rather than sprinkled on top, which I think I prefer. It infused the whole bread with flavor; you didn't have to worry whether or not you got a piece of naan with a couple pieces of diced onion on it, because it was all inside!\\n\\nI really enjoy this place and would definitely be back if I feel like spending a ridiculous amount of money on Indian food!

The pizza was also small and the menu shows one price and your hand written piece of paper shows another price, the waitress added $4.00 to each item that we ordered.  Place is also dirty and if you order a pizza to-go, they have the customers waiting in the kitchen where the pizzas are being made.  Isn't that a HEALTH CODE VIOLATION??????????????

The food is very good, and we enjoyed our lettuce wraps and dim sum platter very much. I felt a little uneasy when I realized the restaurant is actually owned by an outside party not affiliated with Disney, but with the food, d√©cor, and efficiency I would not have known it if there were not signs on the table asking us to visit some of the other restaurants they own around the country. I will say that they should make more concessions to the fact that they are actually located in hot muggy Florida and not the cool mountaintops of Nepal. We ordered at their quick service window one day only to find that a large portion of the outdoor seating was unshaded. When we returned, we were determined to sit inside the restaurant. Without a reservation, this meant an hour wait but that was expected. Their open air waiting area is far too small for the crowd they attract, and while the d√©cor is marvelous they really should have opted for some ceiling fans or something. There is a bar just inside the entrance but it is so small that it seemed to be an alternate dining area rather than a place to wait for a table.

Having worked for a construction company that helped build this, I was particularly excited to see it in full operation.  Mr. Peach and I decided to go Wednesday night around 7pm and we were immediately seated. The ambiance is nice, kinda rustic and beachy, and the serves are all dressed in blue checkered shirts and Converse sneakers. This would be a great place for tapas with girlfriends or a date night. \\n\\nThe server was extremely helpful and explained how their system for ordering works, which is a menu in which you pencil in your selections and leave them in a placard on the end of the table to be picked up. We decided to get the small taco tray, which consisted of 6 tacos, 2 sides, guacamole and 2 tamales. Typically it's chef choice, but for an extra couple bucks you can choose what you want. We ordered the duck, chorizo, pork belly, shrimp, ribeye, and fried oyster. \\n\\nWhile we waited for the tacos and such, our guac was delivered first and man it's definitely one of the best I've ever had. Really really fresh, not too over seasoned, and chunky. It arrived at the table with baked hard, whole, corn tortillas, I would prefer the chips or to have them precut, but they were so fresh and tasty I'm not complaining at all (just lazy lol). Around this time I attempted to order one of their house drinks, the CLT, but was informed that it wasn't available, but the bartender suggested a spicy margarita in its place, and it was really good. \\n\\nOur tacos arrived not to long after, along with the tamales. Our favorites were the pork belly and the ribeye, man they were amazing.  I literally wish that's all we had ordered. The pork belly was sweet succulent had a smoked flavor. The ribeye was to die for. I have never even thought to put ribeye in a taco, but if definitely made its way to the top of the taco food chain in my eyes. Our check was around $40 and worth every penny. Definitely affordable for a couple who takes the 30-minute trip to Buford Highway for tacos a couple times a month, this place may become the substitute."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"One of the BEST burger joints I've ever been to.

We ordered the Buffalo Dip as an appetizer, half way through we found one of the centipedes and that is when we quietly alerted our waitress. We ordered a turkey burger and a salmon burger as our entree (we had asked for the veggie burger before the turkey burger but our waitress said you were all out of the veggie burger so she chose the Turkey burger instead.) We had a dark brown haired waitress (who came back from the kitchen after taking our buffalo dip to check it out and said that they checked and it was in fact a bug) I do not remember her name, but I do remember she apologized after she came back from the kitchen and asked if we wanted our entree or if we no longer had our appetites. We POLITELY said we would continue eating because we were not trying to be rude. The manager, who was a taller gentleman with a short haircut wearing a grey suit and a teal colored tie or shirt I believe came over after we were given our entrees and apologized for the bugs saying that 'it was not on purpose'... Which we had hoped it wouldn't have been, then he told us he would take the dip off our bill. The dip was only 8 or 9 dollars so after everything when we got the bill it was for 39 dollars, I even have the banking statement of when my card was swiped if you need any more proof that I was dining at your restaurant. Clearly if we had wanted this handled properly then we should have made a scene because the way it was handled and continues to be handled is appalling.

The only thing that was ironic about the whole thing - my boyfriend doesn't drink and I gave up alcohol for Lent. But we didn't want to tell the owner that because he was so generous so I ended up drinking both glasses! So I failed in my Lent sobriety! So close - just 3 days away till Easter. But the champagne was good! The owner came up to use later and offered us another bday drink but my boyfriend declined. Again super generous - and very attentive. \\n\\nWe both got the vegan chili for an appetizer (so good!). and OMG that bread is soo good. I don't know if that's butter or olive oil they put on the bread that comes with the soup (so future vegans ask about that) but otherwise it's so yummy! I was so happy they had a vegan soup special - that never happens to me! And the bread basket with olive oil is yummy too. \\n\\nI got the wild mushroom ravioli that is vegan if you leave off the sprinkled cheese. SO GOOD. I never get to have ravioli ever so it was a real treat. So much flavor and the balsamic dressing is great - love all the herbs, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, asparagus, and sun dried tomatoes. I took a little bit home and ate it for breakfast this morning. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the steak frites which he said was good but it wasn't nearly as exciting as mine. His was just steak, french fries, and grilled tomatoes. I think they should do it instead with steak, mash potatoes, and asparagus. It would just look nicer + have less bar food appeal if they dropped the fries. \\n\\nFor dessert my boyfriend got the key lime cheesecake and I asked the waiter to bring out a candle with it. He did and that was nice. My boyfriend liked the dessert a lot. I couldn't get dessert because there were no vegan options (two gluten free options but no vegan options! boo). They should add sorbet to their dessert menu. That way I could experience a 3 course meal too. \\n\\nWe each had tea which was good but whoa they put a lot in those bags. I imagine that's gotta be really expensive - you don't need that much tea for those cups. The tea they gave us is more for a pot. I would suggest they cut back on the tea quantity or serve it in a larger bowl. \\n\\nAnyway it was a great experience, I really enjoyed meeting the owner and everyone was very nice.

Despite being an unlimited buffet, the items were barely refilled.  They had common spoons for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food all getting mixed up. Do not even dare to request a refill or ask for something you need.  We tried to request for basic food which required a refill on the buffet however in return we got a rude response stating we are not offering any food anymore nor are we refilling any items.  So we asked how can we pay the full amount if we are not receiving what we are going to be charged for.  The cashier went ballistic on us and came to us to fight and started screaming.  One of the girls in our group got scared and started dialing 911. On seeing that, the cashier started screaming even more and asked us to leave the restaurant in the middle of our lunch.

T.Black's did not disappoint! Because of the size of our group we ended up with a taste of all their sides and they were awesome, fresh and full of flavor! They are pricey, but not unreasonable considering the location.  Has a nice service and dining area and a large outside patio. They even offer some kind of tour of their pits if you want. The one tip I have: If you're with a group, I would stay away from buying the family packs. Basically, you get loaded up with sides.

The hand cut fries were a nice compliment to such a juicy and tasty burger.\\n\\nAs a treat, I ordered the Nutella and Burned Marshmallows shake. Funny thing, I didn't so much distinguish the Nutella in this shake. But it was good. And now I know that I don't like burned marshmallows in a shake. Actually, I didn't like burned marshmallows before I ordered the shake, but I thought I'd be adventurous.\\n\\nAnd finally, here's how I know for sure that Flip Burger's Butcher's cut burger was one of the best I've had so far: I didn't remove a single topping from the burger. Yep. You see, usually I'm a picky eater and basically remove all the garden from a burger, especially the onions. But this day, I squared my shoulders, puffed out my chest, lifted my head and courageously faced the burger. I dared myself to experience the chef's creation as intended. I was pleasantly surprised and enchanted by the textures and flavors. Of course, this also means I'm a grown up now."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My go to BBQ in Austin.

When we arrived, we realized that it was Saturday and most people were actually out, so it was pretty crowded.  We were directed to the bar to get our order.  The bar was packed.  So, while our ice cream is melting, we are trying to force our way in with no help from the staff.  Bad takeout system!  Perhaps they are trying to discourage takeout- mission accomplished!

Originally, the food was definitely of par, but it's the service that really gets me.\\n\\nA few months back I ordered two pizzas to be delivered to my home, while I was at work. I figured I would race the delivery driver to my house, and have time to have lunch with my father (who was waiting for me til I got out of work) on my break. Obviously, I won the race...by FORTY MINUTES. That means that for two small pizzas and a 2 liter, I waited a solid hour and fifteen minutes for a delivery that is literally a straight shot up Lafayette St. When I got the pizzas, they were cold, partially burnt, and looked like they were tossed around in the back seat before they even thought about delivering them to me. The total came to $26 (ridiculous on it's own), but I told the driver I wasn't paying full price and left him a $20.\\n\\nUpset, I bothered again to give them another try. I ordered a buffalo chicken sub, with bacon and cheese, but all I got was a regular, plain chicken sub. When I came back to return it, they told me they charged me for a large sub and a pizza, for no reason whatsoever. I was refunded, but still PISSED. I didn't even want a sub that was made correctly, they completely lost my business.\\n\\nHowever...\\n\\nMore recently, I called ahead to tell them I wanted two slices of cheese pizza. A fairly simple order, but they STILL managed to screw it up. They told me it would be ready in five minutes, so I showed up in ten. When I got there, they said it still wasn't ready, because they literally just put it in the oven.\\n\\nDespite what I had to say about them, I still went ahead and gave them business again for a single slice of pepperoni pizza. When I got in to get it, I stood in line (with nobody in front of me) watching the girl behind the counter mow down on some kind of sub, who tried talking to me asking what I wanted. I told her twice the same, stupidly simple pepperoni pizza slice order, but for whatever reason she could not remember for her life what I said. The cook in the back heard me, and once she finally swallowed her last bit I got my pizza. When I went back to work to chow down, I noticed a big pool of grill grime that my cheese had melted into, and a few lovely blotches of burned dough on the bottom. Needless to say I didn't eat it, and wasted yet again another couple of bucks at Engine House Salem.\\n\\nDon't waste your time here, they thrive on screwing up."},{"name":"Hot Plate Asian Cuisine","address":"14845 SW Murray Scholls Dr, Ste 102","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Pad thai pretty good.

Also the only side veggies offered are broccolini and asparagus. Would have liked other choices. We were never asked if we wanted coffee or tea.

And that's what I was looking for.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the greeters, servers, and counter help were friendly and accommodating.\\n\\nWe arrived a bit after 6 p.m. on a Tuesday night, moments before the place filled to overflowing with a lively and noisy crowd. We were handed menus and directed to the order line at the back of the restaurant. The line moved a bit slower than expected, perhaps because two groups suddenly appeared in front of us where only two men had been standing. (That's customary Austin rudeness for ya!) But then suddenly we were rescued by a cheerfully forlorn order-taker who emerged from her hiding place behind the throng of bickering relatives to help us out.\\n\\nI had to request a gluten-free bun, called \\"non-gluten\\" because it is made in a common area with the regular buns. I wasn't told there was an upcharge for the special bun, which was hard to take since the other burgers come with a bun, too (and I would much rather eat wheat if only I could!) I must add that the total of nearly 30 bucks was steeper than I imagined for two fairly simple burgers, a small order of fries, a fountain drink and a shake. Then I felt obligated to tip twice, due to the odd arrangement and array of services, thus magnifying a bit my mild disappointment in the food. Nonetheless, we paid, gathered our drinks, utensils, and sauces and returned to the table that had been held for us by a passing server.\\n\\nFifteen or so minutes later, our burgers arrived. My companion proclaimed the Continental Club \\"delicious.\\" For me, alas, the combination of a crumbly non-gluten bun that somewhat resembled a barely underbaked buttermilk biscuit, sans gouter, a beef patty that was closer to well done than the medium I requested, and an overly- intense and somewhat confusing mixture of flavors, not helped by the addition of the honey mustard on offer, was not what I was hoping for.\\n\\nI liked the fries. Copious and crispy, but not greasy, secreting just the right amount of soft potato texture within.\\n\\nMy suggestion to the chef would be to pander a bit to the traditionalist grumps among us, and provide the traditional condiments upon request. That adjustment, plus a closer estimate of a medium cook could have raised this review to four, or perhaps even five, stars.\\n\\nMy companion says she would like to return, and I would also be inclined to do so, provided the chef begins to accommodate my old-fashioned preferences."},{"name":"Summer Shack-  Cambridge","address":"149 Alewife Brook Pkwy","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"It was okay.

There was absolutely no wait, only a few of the tables were taken inside. On the counter lady's recommendation, I got the bison burger with goat cheese instead of bleu, which was an EXCELLENT decision. The burger plus a Topo Chico was $13. Expensive, but bison usually is and I went in knowing this place was on the pricier side. I had no sticker shock. \\n\\nThe burger itself was fantastically delicious. The only demerit I give is how greasy it was. I'm not a huge stickler for that, but bison is a super lean meat anyway, so to see grease literally dripping onto my tray kind of makes me raise a brow. I literally inhaled my burger so I couldn't tell you the long-term effect on the bun, but I imagine there would of been some sogginess to contend with had I actually paced myself like a normal person. \\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was nice. I get what they're trying to do with their order-and-table system, but I'm not sure I really like it for a supposed high end burger joint. For $8-$10 a pop excluding drinks or fries, I'd kind of like to be served at my table. Just my preference. \\n\\nI'll go back to try their dessert (I keep hearing fantastic things about the salted caramel shake), but I doubt Hopdoddy's will make my list of regular stops, delicious bison burger or not.

It really takes a lot of food knowledge and skill to create the dishes that we ate tonight. some of the highlights were the smoked pork shoulder which was smoked as tasty as you would expect Franklin BBQ then sous vide (for the insane tenderness) and then wrapped up in a baggie with apples bathed in a rich smoky and woody broth. The ribeye was also sous vide as you can tell from the color and then flash seared for that crust. Every one of the 10 courses were fantastic.

Plainly put, it is - surprisingly - Chinese! And not very well-catering to Caucasians, so in all honesty people looking for well-translated and defined descriptions, as well as smiling and courteous staff, stay away! It's a noodle shop that's almost always busy (I was there at 2PM on a Saturday and had to wait 10 minutes!), so I would cut service a lot of slack.\\n\\nThe claim to fame is that this is a chain of noodle shops from Taiwan where the beef noodle has been acclaimed for awards. They also have a large array of drinks and a small array of side dishes. This time I decided to have a bowl of beef noodle soup (beef including shank, tendon and tripe) that had \\"lava chili\\" (which turned out to be Szechuan peppercorns), a marinated egg, and a matcha milk tea with red beans.\\n\\nIt took me 5-10 minutes to get my food after the order, so brusque service but they are also fast. First came out the drink, which was fairly large. Creamy, I got the green tea taste as quite a mild accent with the red beans, as is expected in Chinese food (but god knows why this is always the case), adding the sugar. \\n\\nThen came out the noodles. I had taken a thick noodle with the spicy soup and was very pleasantly surprised. The broth was spicy indeed, but more in the style I mentioned with the peppercorns - indeed, there was a lot of numbing of the tongue, which is what happens with those peppercorns, but not so much spiciness that I couldn't eat. In fact, it was actually more of a tantalizing spiciness than a repulsion (which I encounter with shichimi spice with udon, for example). The noodles were pleasantly firm to the touch but also had absorbed so much flavor that they were a true pleasure to eat. Finally, all the pieces of beef - including the tripe - were tender and falling apart to the touch, which made this quite a great dining experience.

It's not as if they don't put the order in the machine, and it's not as if I see our food sitting around under the lights.  I therefore conclude that it's the kitchen's fault.  Either they have not been trained sufficiently to get the meals prepped, plated and out to waitstaff quick enough, or else they are just ill-suited to the job of a short order cook.\\n\\nWe come here because we live in the hive and we don't have a ton of restaurants around here to choose from.

The atmosphere is a bit kitschy. From the woman wearing period dress and playing an accordion to the Photoshopped pictures of Europe ... you imagine that this is what an Italian restaurant was expected to look like in the 1950s.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, helpful, and efficient throughout the entire meal.\\n\\nFor me, the bread a restaurant serves says a lot about a restaurant's attention to detail. Fresh crusty bread--good; reheated dinner rolls--bad. Andiamo, however, defies convention by serving a moist, spongy basil and cheese bread that had the texture of cake. It wasn't bad, nor was it outstanding ... but it was unusual.\\n\\nTo start we ordered the antipasto misto and pan-seared sea scallops. The misto offered a nice mix of typical Italian appetizers. The dish included some tasty marinated mushrooms and the meats were freshly sliced. The sea scallops were a bit over done and slightly tough.\\n\\nFor entr√©es, we ordered pollo ai carciofi (chicken breast saut√©ed with artichoke hearts and sun-dried tomatoes in a garlic lemon wine sauce) and filetto di manzo (filet mignon with saut√©ed porcini, Portobello, and shitake mushrooms in our chef's gorgonzola cream sauce). The chicken dish was not bad, but there were just too many sour elements in the dish. The lemon, artichokes, and sun-dried tomato combination made the dish overly tart. The filet was well prepared and cooked exactly as ordered. The piece of meat had been poorly cut, so it was a bit mangled, but the flavors were good.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the cannoli. It was absolutely perfect--fresh, crispy, and filled with a sweet and creamy mascarpone filling.\\n\\nThe wine list isn't bad and the mark-up is reasonable.\\n\\nThe prices over-all are similar to those of high-end Italian restaurants in Austin like Siena and Vespaio. I think this is the weakness of Andiamo. In general, our experience and meal was not bad, but if I'm going to pay the same prices as I would at really excellent Austin restaurants, I would rather do so at those other restaurants. We will probably go back to Andiamo because the restaurant is close to where we live, but if it were not so convenient, I doubt we would go out of our way to return."},{"name":"Thyago's Pizza","address":"368 Trapelo Rd","city":"Belmont","stars":"2.5","text":"Just ordered a steak and cheese with mushrooms. the steak was ground up oddly, but the worst part was that one end of the sub roll was soggy like it had been dipped in water.

He asked for 3-5 minutes, and when the Lamb Lollies arrived, we were not surprised to find they were basically RAW. By this point, we were starving for something and had not even been offered bread. Our waiter did apologize profusely and spent the remainder of the evening striving to make up for his mistakes, but we were still disappointed. The bison burger was good overall, but overly salted. Substituting out the fries for roasted potatoes was a great decision, because we saw others' fries that were unappetizing. The arugula salad was good (with spinach subs), but had too much dressing.  Our waiter offered a side of cheese grits and lamb meatballs and both were yummy. We just wish the 1.5 hour visit had been better spaced out instead of chowing down food in the last 20 minutes.

During my first visit, I opted for three different cupcakes (chocolate, strawberry, and Patron) and one muffin (banana nut). The baked goods certainly weren't the best that I've had in Atlanta, but they were all flavorful, sizable, and visually appealing. I was particularly impressed with the Patron cupcake, which was both unique and fairly well executed; the liquor flavor nicely complemented the sweetness of the frosting and wasn't overly potent. Although they were sold out, I was told that they also offer a Grand Marnier version as well.\\n\\nService: The service during my visit wasn't incredibly efficient, but this wasn't surprising considering that the place had just opened its doors only a few days prior. Aside from having a few difficulties with the cash register, the gentleman who assisted us was incredibly friendly and eager to please.

I am a huge fan of very rich and flavorful Tonkatsu types of ramen and this is quite light as it is a mix of tonkatsu and chicken broth, the flavor isn't watery but not punch you in the taste buds either (which is what I want). It's good but I much prefer the broth at Kizuki.  The real stars of the show that get this place 4 star's are the chewy noodles (so good, really! they absorb the flavor of the broth and are amazing) and the Chashu.

But there are some exceptions:\\n\\n1. A Nashville restaurant called Catbird Seat which caught me by surprise.\\n2. The first chef's tasting menu I had at this new Barley Swine on Burnet.\\n3. Pretty much the last ten times I've eaten at the old Barley on Lamar.\\n\\nI get why people dip their culinary toe gingerly in Happy Hour fare, with maybe a few bites from a couple of shared plates. But my thinking is if you're there already, why not go for broke? It's only food. You never know when a five star experience will come and bite you on the taste bud. \\n\\nAnd Barley makes it easy. Here's your list:\\n1. Go online and make a reso for two.\\n2. Do the chef's tasting option.\\n3. Ask for Table 18. It's that corner banquette that lets you see everything. If you want intimacy, do the counter and turn slightly toward each other, just like the old Barley.\\n4. If you're a drinker, do the $55 mixed alcohol pairing. Prepare to be surprised. I don't drink, so I did six cups of French Press as I was watching her be surprised. \\n5. And when the last savory bowl is taken away - right before the two desserts and tiny chocolate box - ask your server if there's one thing you haven't tried that will completely blow you away. And then do it. In our case, it was the Slayer pork platter, the small portion, which was pretty much two-pounds of crispy pork belly with coleslaw & kumquats. Yeah, it blew us away. \\n\\nI thought I would miss the small bistro ambiance of the old Barley, but that wasn't the case at all. The new Barley is simply bigger and better, not brighter and shinier. I recognized Vincent from the old staff, I met John the new manager (\\"I'm not as attractive as Billy.\\" \\"True, but I won't hold that against you.\\"), and our guy Cruz was simply perfect. I think he came over from LaV.\\n\\nI'm sure the menu is seasonal, anything Mr Gilmore does involving an egg or duck will be amazing, and I still haven't figured out what the Asian component of the chicken was. Maybe I'm being fooled. I'm curious to see what they'll do with an all vegetarian request. My first visit here was during a Happy Hour gathering, and a couple of dishes with an iced tea cost me $28. This second visit with two chef tastings, the pork platter, and one alcohol pairing cost ten times that amount. But it came with a thousand times the awe factor.

However, after getting a few bites in, I started to feel greasy. Since braised pork has considerably a lot of fat, I was hoping to count on the rice to dilute the fat. However, underneath the braised pork, the rice was completely soaked in oil to the point that my mouth felt sticky and overwhelmed with grease. In terms of flavor, this dish is heavy, but satisfying.

The bar looked awesome and my first thought walking in was \\"wow, how cozy!\\"  I ordered the steak tips and they offered two sides. I chose a side salad and waffle fries. There was an up charge of $3 for the fries but i didnt mind because i love waffle fries. When the food came out that is when they lost me..... The (supposedly) 1lb of steak tips were on top on the side salad and the waffle fries came on another side plate. I asked the bartender for a plate and she passed me a tiny appetizer plate. I explained i needed a dinner plate so i can put my steak stips and fries on one plate. I take my first bite of steak and its cold! I had them warm them up.  The waffle fries had no spice on them! Now i could put all that aside if the steak was lip smacking good, but no! The steak was cut up small, lacked marinade flavor, and every bite was elastically like each piece i swallowed i had no chance of it being chewed properly. I definitely recommend they look into a better quality meat.  On the upside, i really liked the side salad! They use a spring mix and it was really fresh! Unfortunately i just didn't think my meal was a $20 quality. If you miss the mark on food then it really doesn't matter how many tv's you have.\\nOne more thing......

The first time I ordered an amazing dish that effaced the very slow service from my memory (temporarily, I guess). It was gnudi with a butter sauce and pickled raisins that was not on the menu in January. Honestly one of the best Italian dishes I have ever eaten. The second time I ordered take-out as I was staying in a nearby apartment. I ordered a cheese and meat platter because I wanted something simple. Unfortunately they forgot the bread which made it difficult to enjoy the platter. The latest time was for dinner last week, my co-worker and I ordered two pizzas (one was fig and prosciutto and one was artichoke). The pizzas were delicious and inexpensive. \\n\\nThe service all three times was slow. It often seemed like they forgot that I was a customer or that I existed. They seem to have a team setup that doesn't work in favor of the customer as no one particular person is on top of the latest interactions. Last week our waiter practically ran away after telling us about the available appetizers. What this means is it took longer than necessary to get the food, and way too long to get the check.\\n\\nI love the inside of the restaurant - it's gorgeous. It doesn't make up for the snail-like service, however.\\n\\nThe prices are bipolar. Pizzas are $12, but a meatless pasta dish may run you $24. \\n\\nOverall, it is probably worth trying.

If you enjoy Hooka it's a good idea to order it before your meal even if you want it after wards as it gives it a chance to really get going.

Navarre does lots of stuff right- cozy, intimate atmosphere, good lighting, fairly attentive waitstaff structured in such a way that any one of them can help you and a wide variety of dishes in two sizes (S and L). \\n\\nWe tried several small dishes, and while everything was tasty, there was only one standout: the Grilled Walla Walla onions. They were amazing. We ordered two plates of them and could have had another. Sweet and juicy and cooked to perfection. They were a specialty item, so if you're reading this in a timely manner, GO NOW and order up a plate!\\n\\nWe ordered almost exclusively off the specialty menu, so this review will most likely cease to be relevant shortly. But to give you a good idea of what we got: Spinach with raisins and parmesan (my second favorite dish), pork loin with apple, prunes and cheese (my third favorite), trout in morel sauce (boyfriend's second favorite), some kind of mussel dish and arugula with lemon and breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs gave the arugula an addictive crunchy texture but was a bit lemony for my tastes.\\n\\nWe had some other dishes but I already can't remember. That's the beauty of a small plates style restaurant; you can try lots of different dishes without committing and getting stuck with an entree you don't like. Navarre does a great job of letting you experiment with different tastes so you can see what you like without breaking the bank. That being said, it adds up quick, so watch out! Also get there early- popular dishes will sell out quick.\\n\\nAnd how could I forget: dessert. Glad I read some Yelp reviews before heading in, because I knew to watch out for the red velvet cake.

This was the absolute worst dining experience of my life."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This review is of the Sunday lunch buffet ($12/person) at the restaurant that is widely spoken of as the best Indian in Austin. I was there once before, April 2010, before moving to Austin, for a dinner that had mixed results (e.g. chicken tikka masala ruined by vinegar). However, the buffet yesterday fared much better and I can whole heartedly recommend it for its taste, wide variety and price appropriate for its environment. Yet, it is not superb and far from traditional. But just may be the best available and certainly satisfying.\\n\\nThe buffet was a hit with three veggie dishes, three meat/chicken dishes, one fish dish, nice array of condiments, mini-samosas, naan served at the table and two well executed desserts. (I ignored the salad and two soups.)\\n\\nThe three vegetable dishes were all winners but of different degrees. The vegetable korma was the standout success, the best korma I have had in Austin and many other places, with nice tofu amidst the other veggies. The saag chana dish was quite good with firm chick pea. The consistency of this dish was not as sickeningly rich and pureed like the entree served at Clay Pit last April -- that is a plus! Eggplant had generous amount of peas and good flavor, although very oily but that is often the case with eggplant.\\n\\nAs for the meats, the chicken tandoori is superb, especially if you time it when the plate is being refreshed which they do regularly (old, dry tandoori chicken is a big failing of other restaurant buffets). The lamb with peppers featured very good quality meat although a little spice heat would have enhanced it. The mahi mahi featured very nicely prepared fish, moist and tender, cut into perfect size pieces in a \\"mango\\" sauce which really seemed more like coconut flavor. A winner. Chicken curry was merely \\"acceptable\\" due to overabundance (imbalance) of mushrooms and an inferior yellow curry reminiscent of what you would get in a Chinese restaurant or a store bought package... but that could be me. I don't like that variety. Either way, the mushrooms killed it. Overall, the meat/chicken/fish dishes scored high. There was a very thin yellow dahl soup (unnecessary) and another soup I did not try. \\n\\nI would use dahl as a topping on very spicy dishes of which there were none. Many dishes had abundant flavor but no heat, which I would have liked. There was a hot sauce offered on the side but that is a mere palliative compared to adding fresh chilies to the making of a dish. Oh well. They win again.\\n\\nThe mini-samosas were quite good, not too fried and greasy with an interior of pureed potatoes although my dining companion identified other veggies as well. The \\"usual suspects\\" in condiments included a very nice tamarind \\"chutney\\" which worked well over the samosa and tandoori chicken. We did not try the dried chick peas and make our own \\"chat.\\" Desserts were strong conclusion: kheer rice pudding with slivered cashews and a fine, heated gulab jamon ball in which the syrup was appropriately thin.\\n\\nNow for the constructive criticism. I wanted some information on the food being served and, just like my dinner last year, there was nobody available who knows the first thing about Indian food, what is in it, which region it comes from, etc. The \\"best\\" Indian restaurant in the state capital must do better, e.g. when they told me that most of the dishes served were south Indian in origin. Really? Saag chana, korma, tandoori chicken, bengan bartha (eggplant), samosas, papri chat, dahl, gulab jamon?\\n\\nOther criticism from my companion is the ladies room is dark and dingy. I thought the men's room was fine. Certainly, the overall environment is refined and comfortable. It is a beautiful building.\\n\\nI am going back to the Clay Pit for dinner to have the entrees, the kebobs and tandoori specialties, the kashmiri rogan ghosh and the other curries. Dinner may be a different story. Suppose I'll have to go for the \\"fusion\\" dishes, too, such as curried mussels and coriander calamari. But meanwhile, I endorse the Sunday buffet (note: larger and more expensive than Mon-Sat).\\n\\nUPDATE:  Went back for dinner and it is horrible.  Khuroosh-e-tursh, chicken tikadar and tamarind coconut shrimp (with tamarind chutney in sauce).  Too painful to go thru the details, but it is bad.

Hence, you'll have to wait a bit on a Saturday night, and you'll have to wade a bit through 230+ reviews if you're curious about what yelpers think of it.\\n\\nPro/things I appreciate: \\n-Some, if not most, of the food is excellent.  I'd recommend the mushroom & swiss burger, onion rings and tequila-lime slaw for fellow veggies.  The onion rings are everything an onion ring should be - light-battered, seasoned perfectly, and tender enough to bite through without having slimy onion fall out of the batter.  They give you two great dipping sauces, and I couldn't really tell what they were in the dark, but they tasted great.\\n-Most, if not all, of the food is interesting and worth trying.  Yes, the Krispy Kreme shake is really good - overhyped, perhaps, but not overrated.  I also enjoyed the thai-bouleh salad, fried okra, fried butternut squash, fried pickles, and jar of bread & butter pickles, which were delicious even though I am generally a dill girl (we shared a lot of stuff around the table - I'm not sitting here ordering six servings of fried vegetable).  The chickpea burger was really interesting and tasted good, but not to the same level of the mushroom burger, and I got bored after a couple of bites.  That's probably one of the healthiest options, though.  I've had the tuna burger before too, and it was good but did not taste like tuna to me, and since I don't eat meat other than fish, I couldn't enjoy it for continued fear it was really a pork burger.  Note that they used to have fried asparagus, I think, and a bunch of people commented how they missed that.\\n-Decor is spot-on.  Sanitized diner, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Accomplishes a casual feel even though there are many things about it that are quite fancy, like the flat-screen TVs in white picture frames behind the bar.  Muted during busy times - it worked really well.  \\n-Lots of places to stand and lean while you're waiting for a table.  The extended divider has a nice flat surface for drinks so that you don't actually have to land a barstool to have a drink while you wait.  Which you will likely have to.\\n-Takes its concept seriously in that \\"flip\\" is incorporated into the logo, menu, and decor.  Look at the ceiling.  Come on, that's fun.\\n\\nCon/things to know before you go:\\n-I don't see a way out of feeling like you've overdone it after you leave here unless you've got a lot of self-control or you're ordering one burger and some slaw to go.  The burgers are actually portioned moderately, but you pretty much have to try at least one fried thing, and the shake, right?  That's just a lot of heavy, dense food.  One trick to eating here is balancing the greasy stuff with the exceptionally refreshing slaw/salad choices they have.  \\n-No reservations taken, even for large groups, and you'll have to wait during prime time.  I hesitate to put this as a con, because I got the impression that reservations would throw off the game of a place like this.  It's mainly my personal preference.\\n-It's definitely a bar atmosphere at night, not really a kids' place.  Not that I have any.\\n-Parking can be annoying, as the small lot on the property fills up fast, and the lot across the street is nowhere near a crosswalk over pseudo-highway Howell Mill Road.

Good sometimes, very bitter others.  Well at least I haven't been served sour coffee yet, thankfully.\\n\\nHot chocolate:  much too sweet, very rich with the whole milk but weak cocoa flavour.  Very disappointing given this is supposed to be a chocolatier.  I'd rate it 6 out of 10.\\n\\nOverall, pastries were decent, but did not blow my socks off either:\\n\\nFruit danishes:  ok pastry, custard cream clearly contains real vanilla beans but was seriously lacking vanilla flavour.  The redeeming aspect is that this pastry is relatively lightly sweetened, which I like.  One of the more reasonably priced items at $2.50 or $2.75 to pair with a coffee.\\n\\nGanache:  being a chocolatier, surprised that the chocolate flavour was not particularly rich. Somewhat of a letdown.\\n\\nMadeleines:  very dense with no rich buttery aroma.  Have had better.\\n\\nMacarons appear to be another of Thierry signature items which have been raved about.   I am not a macaron fan so naturally did not have any and therefore cannot comment.\\n\\nSo what's the word? I'd say Thierry's pastries are merely ok for the primo prices they charge.  Yes, I get it -- they have premium rents to pay, but it is not awesome enough to make me fiend for it all the time like I do for TH's goodies.

We arrived in Portland at 10 am, which is perfect for donuts and coffee. \\n\\nAfter getting our rental car, we drove straight to Blue Star. My other half dropped me off and I walked over to Blue Star while he looked for parking. I noticed the line already and knew that was the Blue Star line. It was packed! The line did move and when it was our turn, I was beyond happy that I finally could try Blue Star Donuts. I told my other half to pinch me, I am not dreaming!! We got our donuts and since Stumptown coffee wasn't available, we left for coffee and ate our donuts. \\n\\nWhat makes Blue Star donut so delicious? Their donuts are made from a classic brioche recipe that originated in the south of France. The dough is made from scratch every day, starting with a certified sustainable bread flour from shepherds grain, adding cage free eggs from Stiebrs Farms, mixing in whole milk from Sunshine Diary and then folding in European-style butter from Larsen's Creamery. All fruits used are organic and donuts are cooked in only rice oil. Donuts are made fresh through out the day. This is not your ordinary donut. \\n\\nThe donuts prices are 3.00 and up. They are pricey donuts, was my first impression but after having my first bite, it really was delicious and worth the price I paid for. FYI, Selections change daily and they sell out quickly. Although I didn't go crazy during my very first visit to Blue Star, I only bought 3 donuts for me and my other half to try.( I had plans to come back for again) My 3 donuts were : green tea, lemon poppy seed, & lilikoi. \\n\\nEnjoying our coffee with donuts, as my other half would say, This is the life!! Enjoying the vacation life. The donuts were so delicious, so soft and oh my goodness so fresh and all that ingredients mentioned, you can just taste it!!  \\n\\nDuring my next vacation I am stopping at Blue Star first for my Donut fix!!

It is great to have FRESH fish and seafood.  Entry thing was hand made."},{"name":"The Local","address":"758 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Being a 33 yr old Atlanta native and having a baby at the age of 24 only gave me about 3 years to live out what I refer to now as my glory days.. between the years of 2000-2003 and even now there is only one place my girlfriends and I would go to start our night out on our playground of Ponce De Leon....The Local. Thinking back now most of those nights we axed our plans and stayed put in our cozy little corner wooden booth and because one of the girls from our close nit group of girls was the and still is one of the best bartenders Atlanta will ever know. She will go down in the Atlanta history books as the best liked and most requested bar maid of her time. Because we were best friends with this wonderful girl we knew we would have some rank on this one block of Ponce that became my generations answer to not wanting to venture into the cheesiness of Buckhead nightlife and still be able to afford the cab ride home after taking a number of Kamikaze shots that you can handle for a short time after you turn 21. Okay, I know you're reading to get a quick review but I promise there is point to making you take a trip done memory lane with me that I'm about to explain now. Alcohol tastes the same at any bar you drink it at, what determines a always 100% guaranteed fun night is the how you feel after you drink it. That's what makes The Local a place everyone will return to after their first time there. Oh, and I can also guarantee a fun night at The Local even if you don't drink, trust me I've done it myself and its not about drinking or eating their always consistently delicious healthy pub food. From their loyal and efficient staff you will always find a friendly smile and become amazed at their ability to always be sober and make your dinning order appear in lighting speed. So expect to become friends with your server or bartender at The Local, staff turnover is rare. In fact The Local became such a social hot spot the only time I get to see my dear friendly who I'm pretty sure is friends with everyone inside the perimeter can only be on, her off days or before 4pm. Therefore, The Local has a unexpected always delicious and fun food menu, the friendliest and most efficient bar staff in the city, a cozy and comfortable dim light atmosphere where everything from the bar to booths is made from a Victorian mahogany wood. Their patio is one of my most favorite places to sit on a hot and humid Atlanta summer night where the cars and Marta Buses zipping up and down Ponce De Leon slowly festering its electric energy up the steps and through the door into every bit of airspace The Local can hold. This is when you will feel this energy. Almost as gently as the turn of your head you start to feel alive with the city and you feel young and happy and safe (I experienced this sober so not due to alcohol consumption) this is where I come to the point of my story. What has made The Local the home of some the best nights of my life thus far is the positive and exciting way you feel that has never failed me in all visits to this quaint little bar that never is too loud or pretentious. I am shy and I know that you can go to The Local and not know a soul in the place and yet always find a friendly person next to you to chat with at the bar. I am not only writing this review to convince you to give them your business because The Local doesn't have to advertise because once you go you get it. Now, I can't promise you will have the same experience I have had with my perfect little neighborhood bar your favorite bar may be somewhere totally unexpected. All I can do is share my personal experience and give credit where credit is due. I will say these last three things to you. When I found. I was pregnant I told my friends (soberly) at the local because it has and still is our favorite place to get together to have fun or just for a quick drink or bite to catch up. After my ex husband and I got married of all the places we fancy places we could have gone The Local was the only place we wanted to be late that night, and finally around 4 yrs later when I was grief stricken with my divorce at 2i8 my amazing friends piled my red eyed and puffy face into a car and took me to The Local which cheered me enough to show me I would smile again. This is my experience with this establishment. It created an environment to allow me to feel the excitement of my city living and have a good time no matter what, but also became a mental treasure box that holds some of my most beloved and important memories and coming of age moments.\\nIt's feels strange to say that about a bar but The Local isn't really about drinking or eating as much as it is about how happy and content you feel while there. So, take your friends, take your date, or just take a cab by yourself. This review will only make complete sense when you go to The Local, and then it will hit you and your story can begin."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Blueberry.

We love the quick service Yak and Yeti, but it was a special occasion so we did the sit down.  Overall if we were looking to do a sit down place in Animal Kingdom this would be my second choice (Tusker House would be my first).  Our server was too over the top.  I don't like people trying to sell me things.  He tried to sell us the tuna nachos (gross!) and it was just too much.

The other people I ate with on each visit also enjoyed their meals, including the baked haddock and the burger.  The salads are absolutely ginormous and the other portions seemed good too and I thought the prices were fine for what we received. On one visit, I also ordered some kind of margarita that had blood orange in it off the menu and that was excellent with enough tequila in it, which I appreciated.  Also, both times we were there, our hostess and server experiences were excellent.  Everything is subjective, but sometimes I wonder about Yelp reviews because two good experiences in a row is not just dumb luck and honestly, I saw another patron be a total and complete jerk to the hostess over something really idiotic (first world privilege at it's ugliest) and she held it together with grace and patience.

The meal was literally swimming in gravy - the turkey completely invisible.  A big pile of lukewarm broccoli chunks accompanied this dog's breakfast. There was no cranberry sauce (someone had been dispatched to buy more when they ran out - maybe from Safeway?)

Then there was a table number mix-up where a staff member gave us the same number as a table that was already seated. This resulted in our drinks going to another table (luckily, I caught the server trying to deliver our beers to someone else), as well as receiving our neighbor's burger by accident (they overheard and figured out what was going on). \\nHopdoddy can do better."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"This was our first time dining at Yak & Yeti.

I offered him a ride. In thanks, he offered me use of his most prized possession: a crystal ball. The crystal ball was legitimate. It could foresee the future of any man or woman with complete accuracy. The truth it revealed was absolute. How I knew this, I could not tell, but the depths of my souls recognized the majestic power of the crystalline structure set before me. \\n\\nHowever, the crystal ball only works once per person, the man explained to me with a patient smile. It would only show a twenty second clip of some point of your life in the future. There is nothing you can do to urge the crystal ball to a particular time period, or potential event. It is above the wishes of mortals.\\n\\nI peered in. Before me sat a man, foreign yet familiar. Undoubtedly it was me, except twenty years older. I appeared to be sitting in a boutique coffee shop. This was odd. I was never much of a coffee drinker. But, there I was, animatedly discussing the intricate flavors of the brew that sat before me with my fellow patrons - those that would listen, at least. I was struck with the fervor and excitement I expressed of my caffeinated beverage. It was clear that coffee had become an enormous passion of mine.\\n\\nThe crystal ball's vision ended before I could reflect further. \\n\\nI was struck with disappointment. I had a window into my future, and was given a vision of an older me drinking coffee. No insight to amass a fortune. No foreshadowing of some hardship of which I could steel myself against. Coffee.\\n\\nIn my life up until that point, coffee was a tool more so than anything else. A means to start or extend the day, hardly something worthy of the excitement I was displaying in the vision. I quickly forgot about it.\\n\\nMonths later I was walking in the neighborhood and passed by Render. The memories of my potential future came rushing back. I was faced with a choice - embrace the apparent unavoidable passion for what contained therein, or continue down the block to Dunkin Donuts. I went in.\\n\\nI explained my lack of knowledge about what I was doing and was helped by a blonde barista. She was infinitely helpful and insightful in describing how coffee is made without a Keurig. I ordered something. It was not a House Blend and was from somewhere specific. \\n\\nWhat followed was one of the most intensely pleasurable beverage drinking experiences I have ever had. The lingering disappointment from the crystal ball episode faded and was replaced with a renewed appreciation and optimism for the future that lay ahead of me. Not only did I look forward to the next cup, and each cup thereafter for the next twenty years, but from the first sip the very day itself seemed to improve. \\n\\nCoffee instantly became an enormously enjoyable part of my life, and I have Render to thank. \\n\\n(I must say that anyone expecting the earth-shattering experience I encountered here with my first cup of real coffee will be sorely disappointed.

When I hear 'dive bar', I think someplace like Billy Ray's (which, come to think of it, I love and should review) - an old, no-frills kind of place with beer signs and plumber's butt as the primary decor. This place is relatively large, with a more cool-person feel- arty murals of deer (think more along the lines of the doug fir than deer hunting), retro movies (the warriors) on the tv, and a young, bitchy bartender with dyed black hair. It had no personality.  \\n\\nWe came in about 12:30, and some of the chairs were up. The bartender was talking to her friends at the bar, and gave us a nasty look when we walked in. I asked if they were still open, and she said yes, but not for long. It's a bar, and was listed as being open til bar time, but...ok. We asked how long exactly, since we had friends meeting us. She was like 'UGH, how many people are meeting you?' At that point we felt pretty unwelcome, but figured we'd have the one drink since people were coming, and then go to one of the many other bars in the neighborhood that actually stay open. She was surly about the drinks, hassled me about my temporary license, and went back to standing around talking to her friends. After our friends showed up, along with the 2 other groups there, there were 12 people drinking in the bar. I don't know, it seems like if there are 12 people drinking in your bar on a Tuesday, you might want to stay open. And if not, you could at least try not to make the people feel unwelcome. I would never go back, I wouldn't want to make plans for someplace when I don't know whether it will stay open."},{"name":"Heidi's Cafe","address":"5943 Fraser St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Nice little Neighbourhood restaurant for a casual breakfast.

I was afraid it would be crowded, and since they don't take reservations, worried that we might have to go somewhere else for dinner. Apparently we had just beat the rush, because we arrived at 6:30 and by 7 it was packed! It's a good thing that there's additional parking across the street. \\n\\nThe interior of FLIP is impressive and very diverse. On one hand, you have modern, hip furnishings and booths that, if gravity malfunctioned and the world turned upside down, would have you sitting in identical seats. Seriously, the booth had the exact same seating, upside down, above us. And damn, was that the softest leather seating I've ever experienced. Our party nearly molested it in out awe of the texture. There are more antique frames on the wall, contrasting with the flat-screen TVs they're wrapped around. When the TVs are off, they turn into mirrors. \\n\\nThe service was quick, polite, and friendly. Just enough interaction to keep us engaged, without being awkward and butting into our dinner. The waitress answered my questions about the food, and I was very happy with her advice. I got the gyro lamburger, and I'm serious, it was the best burger I've EVER had.\\n\\nJuicy, flavorful beef and lamb, fresh tomato, crispy lettuce, requested cooked onion, the cucumber relish (and I hate relish) and tzatziki sauce all stuffed into that bun was a formidable sight, but a party for my taste buds. I inhaled that burger and was so incredibly upset when it was gone. Where did it go? Bring it back! My cousin's girlfriend said her burger was the first burger she's never put ketchup on. I think that says a lot. My boyfriend got the farmer burger and loved it.\\n\\nI also tried a bunch of samples of appetizers from out tables. The sweet potato tots my cousin got (with maple foam, omg) were my favorite, but the fried pickles I got were pretty addictive, too. There was too much salt on the sweet potato tots with marshmallow foam and chocolate salt, and the marshmallow foam was forgettable. This is my only complaint.\\n\\nI got the pumpkin chai milkshake, and waited until it stopped smoking to down it. Heavenly. I tasted the Krispy Kreme donut shake (fun for a sip, but I wouldn't drink the whole thing) and it tasty exactly like a glazed donut. The Cap'n Crunch shake was surprisingly good, too. \\n\\nFor what we got, the price was reasonable. The sides are separate from the burgers, so keep in mind that getting both will cost you around $13 without a drink. Considering the place blew my mind, it's worth the buck. They apparently have a fixed price lunch for $10, and next time I go back to Georgia, I'll be sure to swing by as soon as possible.\\n\\nThere's a reason that guy won Top Chef.

It was not appetizing and the seasoning was hugely lacking. Next, the chicken itself. About 7 tiny pieces only. I ended up taking those out and eating the chicken just to get my protein. Both the sauce and the naan breads were terrible disappointments. They were bland, cold, and flat. There was literally nothing positive about this order.

Now that it is a 12 course chef's tasting dinner, it is merely pretty good.\\n\\nLet's put it out there -- $75 per person is a splurge for most people, myself included. So when I pay that much for a meal, I expect *something* to be pretty incredible, whether it's the food, the service, the ambiance, or the presentation. These were all good, but off the top of my head, I can point you to half a dozen restaurants in this city that will do them better without charging you an arm and a leg.\\n\\nThe food was good, as were the beer and wine pairings, but most of the flavors were very mild, and nothing surprised me. The two entree-type plates, the poached salmon and the pig face were downright bland, and neither had a pleasing texture. The earlier plates were much better, particularly the red snapper in strawberry ponzu and the green gazpacho, which was delicious with kefir. The desserts were also quite tasty, and I particularly liked the french toast. The portions were perfect. \\n\\nThe service was good, but minimal. One server staunchly refused to look at us as he recited the ingredients, choosing instead to direct his gaze toward an upper corner of the room. Descriptions of the plates were limited to just the facts, ma'am, with no indication of the flavor palate of the dish or recommendations for how to approach it. The beer and wine pairings came with a bit more description, and the bartender was very responsive to questions.\\n\\nAll in all, we had a very good meal, but only three of the twelve dishes stood out to me at all, and when I'm paying Uchi prices, I expect better than that."},{"name":"Scramblers","address":"567 E Livingston Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This was so tasty!

Called a day ahead for a 10+ party for a retirement lunch.   Took forever to get orders taken, drink etc.  No apologies or explanations.  We could see the food stacking up in the kitchen and after waiting and waiting asked them to send out whatever they had made.   So first half came out luke warm/cold.   Last person served was the one paying the bill probably 30 mins after the 1st meal came out.  Apps and salads either served with entrees or right on top of them.  Again no apologies or explanations we were just treated with a \\"this is how it is mentality\\"  Great food horrible service and watched others say they would need to leave since they were clearly not getting their food no apologies given to them either.

Onion rings were HUGE, and a spicy dipping sauce you wanted to put on everything. The sandwich was somehow even better - just a huge portion of tender pork that managed to stay intact with every bite.

It's a cute, Asian-fusion diner experience. The atmosphere is really nice, and the waitstaff are attentive without hovering -- one of my pet peeves at restaurants is hovering. Maybe my high expectations were what made this lunch experience a bit of a let-down, but the food was pretty average overall.\\n\\nWe ordered the Taiwanese-style dan dan noodles, the green papaya slaw, tofu stir fry with slippery noodles, and a side of ginger scallion bok choy. One thing I really appreciated, though, was the separate menu items into gluten-free, vegetarian, shellfish-free, and nut-free for people with allergies.\\n\\nBoth the green papaya slaw the the dan dan noodles were pretty good, but disappointing in their spice levels. Myers & Chang lists both as \\"hotterest,\\" but there was barely any discernable heat in either dish. The flavors were nice, but would have definitely been aided by a bit of a kick. They should seriously revise their scale for spiciness!\\n\\nThe slippery noodles and bok choy were fairly disappointing. The tofu was pretty soggy and flavorless, and the noodles themselves didn't have much flavor. It's listed as being flavored with hot mustard, but that flavor didn't come through at all, which was a shame. The bok choy, too, didn't seem to match the description, with barely any hint of ginger.\\n\\nWe finished lunch with a ginger brownie from Flour, which was absolutely lovely.\\n\\nOverall, a fine meal; I would go back with somebody if they wanted to eat here, but probably won't be choosing it myself anytime soon."},{"name":"Vancouver Christmas Market","address":"1055 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"The Gl√ºhwein Rocked....but.....\\nThe rest was pretty  much a disappointment.  \\nCriminally overpriced food and Christmas trinkets.\\nOvercrowded and long lineups for everything.\\nIf you don't mind spending the better part of a 10'er for a baked potato or a wiener and waiting until New Years for it....you will like this place.\\nTip #1:  Top yourself up on the Gluhwein before you eat....it will ease the pain in more ways than one...and at least you will be jolly when you part with your cash;\\nTip #2:  If you drink more than 2, you may need a cab;\\nTip #3:  The cup that you are obligated to buy and return for a refund before you leave the place in order to get the Gluhwein is complete tat.

Everything was going so well ... food & service rising above my expectations (esp. after reading the mixed reviews) ... and then I handed my $25 gift certificate. The server said I couldn't use it b/c my friend & I had gotten the $25 prix fixe \\"restaurant week\\" special. That gift certificate was the only reason I even came to Lobby. \\n\\nSo then I'm thinking I'm here already, I might as well order something for tomorrow's lunch -- I can't let $25 go to waste. Plus, I read the fine print and there's nothing about a minimum purchase requirement. I ask the server to get a menu b/c I plan to order more. I'm trying to decide between the meat lovers pizza or the duck breast b/c a few of the reviews raved about them. The server comes back to make sure I understand there's a minimum $50 purchase to use the $25 gift certificate. I said there's nothing on the certificate that says that. He doesn't budge. I tell him to get the manager. I tell the manager it's not right when there's nothing about a minimum purchase in the fine print. He says ok, order what I want. The server comes back - I tell him forget it, I don't want anything. My friend also makes a statement by giving back her $20 gift certificate for filling out a form to get on their email list - and tells them she wants her form back. \\n\\nIt's too bad that experience happened. Our server was great otherwise & the food was much better than expected. My friend & I ordered the $25 prix fixe, which includes appetizer, entree, & dessert. \\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the \\"Heirloom Tomato Bruschetta\\" and the \\"Fresh Georgia Shrimp - capers, tomatoes, carraway seed, chipotle.\\" I probably won't come again but I would highly recommend the bruschetta. I couldn't believe the generous portions - 4 large slices of French bread with thick spread of whipped goat cheese, then heirloom tomatoes, basil, & sprinkling of balsamic vinegar on top. The bruschetta was the best part of the meal. The Georgia shrimp appetizer wasn't bad - the flavors were interesting but a little too salty for me.  \\n\\nFor entrees, we both ordered the \\"Wood Grilled Yellowtail Tuna.\\" It was seared & rubbed with Cajun spices, and served with grilled scallions, portabello, and olive emulsion. The tuna wasn't bad - tasted better when dipped in the olive emulsion. The portabello was delicious - I liked that better than anything else on the plate. \\n\\nFor dessert, we went with our server's favorites -- the sticky toffee pudding & the peach shortcake. The sticky toffee pudding was a little disappointing - it looked like an upside down cupcake with toffee on top, and it tasted microwaved to me. The peach shortcake is actually a peach mousse on a thin layer of white cake - very light & nice, esp. after eating all that bruschetta. \\n\\nYeah, I think Lobby has some opportunities. They need to make sure their staff understands the guidelines for using gift certificates. I didn't like the server giving me a new reason two different times why I couldn't use my gift certificate. Tell me everything at once. Otherwise I question your credibility. Don't give the customer a reason to talk to the manager.

Honestly, super disappointed in this place. We went here about a year ago and this place was a place to remember I mean the service, food, atmosphere, everything was AWESOME. So naturally, us living in tye area we made it back there and it was definitely not up to par. The food took FOREVER and the service was absolutely horrendous. Didn't even care that we were waiting to order drinks for along period of time, there was 5 of us so it wasn't like the Tab was going to be small. Finally once the food came out the food was really not good at all. Pretzel was stale and the wings were soggy amd drenched with dressing. We thought it was an off night so we gave it a break and went back tonight. To my surprise, it was even worse. The service was virtually non existent ( they were not busy) we mine as well should've been serving ourselves. And the food, took 40 minutes to come out...we ordered a Pretzel.....the only time the waitress came back to our table was when she dropped off our beers (which took 15 minutes to get) and to drop off our food. Our Pretzel was warm when it came out but as soon as it was on the table for a few minutes it turned rock hard so it was obviously stale....again. long story short we left and probably will never go back. Sad because we loved this place, the poor service and downhill landslide of food will keep us away.

When she returned, she came back with an ultimate breakfast sandwich. I ate it because I was really appreciated her going back, but how hard is it for them to get one sandwich right!\\n\\n     Not only that, but about a month ago when my girlfriend and I went through the drive-thru there was a teenage boy taking our order. The server's name was Even. He was being extremely sarcastic and rude through the drive up speaker.

It was a joke.\\n\\n     My girlfriend was ordering a milkshake and he pretends to misunderstand her and questions, \\"What'd you say?

I told him even if the girl was obviously by herself/single, that's not the way to talk to a female. He still went on further to question me, argue, act like he didn't say anything/do anything wrong, and go against what I said. I had to TELL him to apologize to her. He could barely do that and still acted like he was apologizing for nothing. \\n\\n     It was very disrespectful and still he thought it was a funny joke and laughed it off. If I was his manager I would have definitely written him up or fired him. To top it off we only got 1 straw for our 2 shakes. Not sure if it was intentional or not, maybe he was mad that I called him out and the fact he couldn't get away with disrespecting us both like that.

It's always free, and the shoddiness of it, really, is part of the place's hipster-ish charm. There's a nice beer selection with local craft brews and frequent specials, so they're doing alright there. As far as a place to hang out under a table umbrella and grab a drink, Cherrywood is spot-on.\\n\\nBut then there's the food and service. Everything on the burgers-and-eggs menu promises to be a cut above standard diner or bar fare, because it's priced a cut above. But it's not. This is completely conventional greasy spoon food that's ubiquitously $2 more than it has any reason to be. \\n\\nAs far as service goes, you wait in line (sometimes quite a while, as there's usually only one register open, and the place gets busy) to order food, and then wait (sometimes quite a while again) to have it run to your table. The main problem here is that if you come as a group and order individually at the counter, the kitchen has no way of knowing this, so your food will come out at all different times--sometimes radically different times. I came once for breakfast with a group of ten, waited until everyone else had had their food dropped off, eaten, and smoked a cigarette, and then finally went inside to ask for a refund. The server, who was about to run my incredibly belated food to my table, got in a huff that I  would ask for my money back when the food was made. I replied that she was welcome to my 35-minute order of eggs. My food was ultimately comped, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

Apparently they have live performances on some Saturday nights so I'd love to go back and see that."},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Eeek, I totally meant to write this review a month ago when my thoughts were fresh, but I forgot. I'll do what I can....\\n\\nThe BF chose Andiamo for a Valentine dinner after we waited too long to get in at Vespaio. Neither of us had ever been here, but had wanted to try. I really wish we'd come on another night. We should have done some research to know there would be a price fixe menu, limiting our options. I really don't think this was necessary at all - for the small restaurant it is, a number of tables were open the entire time we were there for our meal. \\n\\nWe had our choice of 3 options for each the appetizer, soup/salad, entree and dessert. I started with an appetizer of prosciutto wrapped asparagus, which was good, but by no means blown away. The BF had scallops, which were cooked very well, and I was wishing I'd got that instead. I then had a mixed greens salad with pear, candied walnuts and gorgonzola cheese which was good. Not sure you can really wow with that one, but it was good. For entrees, both the BF and I were quite disappointed - but there were no pasta dishes on the menu. Well, on second thought, there MIGHT have been a gnocchi option, but I really can't remember. I don't think there was though. I ended up choosing a crab stuffed prawn option. This was okay. I think the prawns were a little overcooked and there wasn't as much flavor in the crab stuffing as I was looking for. I then finished with the tiramisu, which was really good. \\n\\nThe highlight of the meal by far was the bread they brought out - it was some of sort of focaccia bread baked with cheese and spinach on top and come out all warm and cheesy-rific. So good. I couldn't stop eating this.\\n\\nI really wanted to like Andiamo, but it just couldn't win me over. I wasn't disappointed in the food, but not blown away either - I wish I could've gotten a look at the full menu. Also, while I don't mind a restaurant in a shopping center, the set up was just very plain. No real sort of ambiance - just one open room with really bright lights for the occasion. I want to say I'll try it again, but with so many memories of better food elsewhere, I don't know that I will."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I am a huge fan of this place (way better than The Franklin Cafe from a service perspective, too). Some things to try: reggae wings (appetizer), meatloaf and mexican meatball sandwiches. Skip the lemonade.  Get a real drink (full bar) or a soda. \\nThis placed gets packed on the weekends, but the servers are really efficient and the food is uniquely good.\\nI'd skip the dessert unless that award-winning chocolate torte comes back. \\nI think that the simple chicken was also good--it's been so long since I had it. I'm also curious about the Oleana (Ana Sortun) special (on the current menu)."},{"name":"Ramen Danbo","address":"1333 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Gooooooood!

It's an experience where you feel transported to the Himalayas. It feels very authentic.\\nThe furniture is varnished wood. There are flags similar to those that can be seen on Mount Everest. The music is regional as well.\\nI tried the lunch buffet which had a large array of Tibetan delicacies: veggie momo (dumplings), pickled veggies, saut√©ed greens with noodles and tofu, beets, rice, 2 types of Himalayan bread, marinated cauliflower, oven baked eggplant, lentil soup, different types of salads, kale and chickpeas, tasty cabbage slaw, and much more. For the carnivores there was beef broth, curry chicken, and a few other meat and chicken dishes.\\nThere was also a sweet dessert rice with dried fruits and nuts, fresh fruit, milk tea, green tea, and other tasty sauces and treats\\nMy favorite was the rolled Tibetan bread- like a soft sweet rolled crepe.\\nAll of my food was fresh, unique, and delicious. Dirty dishes were cleared immediately and my glass was constantly refilled with fresh,cold water.\\nAfter a lovely satisfying meal my bill came up to about $13- very reasonable\\nI also noticed some shelves full of Tibetan books available for browsing.\\nOverall, a wonderful experience, tasty food, and reasonably priced.

We went to the Anderson / Burnet area And stumbled on Barley Swine. We were able to get seats in the lounge area without  a reservation though the restaurant was filled with people. \\n\\nThe first impression is one of post-hipster quaintness. It's  the type of restaurant my pretentious friends would want to eat at because it gives off that \\"yeah I'm cool\\" vibe. If you go just look at some of the patrons they definitely will be giving off that - yes I wax my beard and mustache, rub polish on my army boots, and only talk about -isms in conversations.  But- and this is a big but- the restaurant simply can't help attracting that crowd because it is a local unique eatery with a chef's tasting , and incredible aromas lingering and wafting throughout and outside the restaurant.  It is also decorated in sort of a kitsch Irish Pub styling that screams Mumford and Sons.   It's nice and cozy and the smell of sweet salted meats thick throughout the restaurant is delightful. \\n\\nSo the food - yes it's chef's tasting but there are several things on the menu you can get. We split 5 plates between the two of us and it was just enough to fill us. Each plates was delicious and had some thematic ideas in the taste of the dish.  All we great and some better than others.  The salad that we had was so tasty I've been thinking about it the past couple days since.  I also really loved the corn bread and steak.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is pricey 10-40 dollars a plate ( I think we spent about 80/90 dollars including tip). The plates are filling together but not heavy.  It is well worth the visit of a special occasion or a date.  I think it would be an ideal date place. \\n\\nAlso I need to mention the staff . All of them were kind and on top of their work. They appeared to really enjoy working there. Definitely a sense of professionalism accompanied their service. \\n\\nSo 4 stars because I am not sure if the price is really worth the food , though coupled with the atmosphere I understand it.  I highly recommend the restaurant and  will be back on special occasions."},{"name":"The Breakfast Club","address":"270 Western Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Love it!
