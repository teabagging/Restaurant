Appa's is a family-run business (the chef is the \\"abba\\" - meaning \\"father\\" in Korean) that sells hand rolls, poke bowls and sushi buritos. They're nestled in the back of Irwin Street Market, which sits right next to Krog St. Market, where Jake's Ice Cream is. Once you enter Irwin, you have to walk through the back and find the green doors that belong to Appa's. \\n\\nI was able to check out Appa's during their soft opening last week. The interior feels very home-y -- you can see the father making orders in the open kitchen, while a handful of tables are scattered around the room (seating is also available outside). To order, you head to the front where you can customize between the following options: \\n1. choose your style: poke bowl, sushi burrito, hand roll \\n2. choose your fish: tuna, salmon\\n3. choose your sauce: spicy, savory \\n\\nDuring my first visit, I decided to try their hand roll and poke bowl. I'm a sucker for salmon, so I opted for the salmon poke bowl and salmon hand roll, both with the spicy sauce. I was curious to try the savory sauce as well; fortunately, they have large bottles of sauces at a counter with small portion cups, so you're able to try each sauce or grab more if you want extra. For those questioning which sauce to use, both are delicious. I love spicy flavors, so I chose the spicy sauce, which is a sriracha mayo-based sauce. If you can't tolerate heat as much, I'd suggest the savory sauce, which is a white, kiwi-based sauce. I think both sauces are quite savory, but the latter has a more well-rounded flavor (a balance of sweetness and tanginess from the kiwi, but a savory kick from the creaminess). \\n\\nThe poke bowl was delicious - it's served on a bed of sushi rice before being topped with the salmon poke, cucumber, tempura flakes, lettuce, toasted quinoa, red cabbage, masago, scallion, sesame seeds and furikake (nori seasoning). I think they ran out of avocados by the time I ordered, so mine came without, but I'm excited to visit again and try it with everything included. The bowl was flavorful; the poke was a bit overmarinated for my preference, with the sauce being mixed in with the fish beforehand but also added on top of the bowl - it has the potential to mask the fresh flavor of the fish, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the bowl. I liked that they included different textures and flavors (like the crunchy tempura flakes or the masago fish roe), but it was subtle enough to enhance the poke, not overpower it. The hand roll tasted similarly - a lot of the same ingredients as the poke bowl are used, but it's rolled into a smaller portion of nori. \\n\\nYou also have the option of ordering sides (edamame or seaweed salad), as well as beverages (bottled water or La Croix). Overall, the meal will cost you a bit - the poke bowls and sushi burritos will ring you up $11.95, while a hand roll costs $5.95. Sides are $4.95 each. But in general, it's a fair price you pay for a meal using fresh, raw fish and being the first of its kind here in Atlanta. I'm excited to see how Appa's will grow into its role in the coming months. Definitely worth the visit and I plan on coming back again soon!"},{"name":"Romano's Macaroni Grill","address":"48 Walkers Brook Dr","city":"Reading","stars":"2","text":"Our party of 4 was here on a Saturday night, and we very much enjoyed our service and meals.

It was perfect!! Also we got a fried fishermans plate and that was remarkable. Super fresh tasting and nice large portions. The prices are extremely reasonable. The staff is very friendly. I was amazed at how cheap their live lobsters were as we'll. We wil definitely be returning.To expand a littler further if I may.\\n\\nAny true New Englander knows what makes a lobster a lobstar!  And the Lobster Stop in Quincy shines bright among a sea of competitors in the area :) Both a sea food restaurant and market, the prices here are always very reasonable, and are comparable to the price that you would pay in your local grocery store, with lobsters starting around 4.99/lb for chicken lobsters, and between 6.99 to 8.99 for larger lobsters, depending on size. Prices have fluctuated since I wrote this review but their prices are always the best. But if you're not in the mood to cook yourself, the Lobster Stop has a great menu, consisting mostly of fried sea food; so if you're in a healthy eating mood, this isn't going to be the place to get your salad fix.  They also serve steamed lobsters and clams which are served to order in house only--this isn't an item you can order and take home with you; but why would you do that anyway?  By the time you get home, the meat inside the shell will overcook while steaming in its shell and ruin it. So, if you want steamed lobster eat it IN house or at YOUR house to avoid chewing on rubber and throwing your money down the toilet. Who likes elastic lobster?  NOBODY! \\nThough the food on the menu at the Lobster Stop is top shelf and super fresh, the lobster roll steals the thunder from all the other items on their menu.  Born and raised in these parts, and I can tell you that I have sampled many a lobster roll in my day, and the Lobster Stop's roll is the best I have ever had. It is loaded with lobster meat that is lightly mixed with mayo and small bits of celery for texture. They let their lobsters speak for themselves, and don't over saturate them with mayo and kill the natural sea flavors.  So if you're feeling guilty about the lack of veggies eating here, feel better that the additional calories weren't loaded on with globs of caloric, belly-busting mayo.\\nThis is has become one of my favorite spots, as become evident by my frequent visits (I'm averaging 2-3 times a month--yes, it is THAT good).  The freshness of the food has to be accredited to the Lobster Stop's owner, Peter Dawson, who has been a lobsterman for over 30 years.  As one who catches and consumes the lobsters, I can't think of a better a person to open up a place that serves them.  I hope that the Lobster Stop stays around for years to come, as this is the kind of place worth shucking out money for!  I always know that I am going to get a great product when I come here, and have yet to be disappointed. \\nThe Lobster Stop is located at the foot of the Fore River Bridge in Quincy Point, on the border of North Weymouth, on Rt. 3A.  It is nestled in between the bridge, the USS Salem and the MBTA Commuter Boat.  Parking has never really been an issue for me, but I can't speak to days where they have lines out the door.  Patrons should be careful when exiting the Lobster Stop as it is located off the rotary that leads on to the Fore River Bridge."},{"name":"Alfredo's Italian Kitchen","address":"462 Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"3","text":"Food is great but the last 2 times we've ordered from them our orders are messed up.

The first time was their first official day, and I try not to be a jerk by reviewing a restaurant on its inaugural run.\\n\\nI had a craving for ribs and Sweet Cheeks did a bang-up job on my second visit.  Sweet Cheek's ribs are served dry and I could see the beautiful amber of the smoke in the meat.  More importantly, the meat tasted deliciously porky and smoky.  You dress the Q with one of three sauces on the table (vinegar, house mild, and spicy).  I also got the salt and pepper potatoes which were a-ma-zing.  The spuds were rough chopped, deep-fried without batter and coated in salt and pepper ... all the better to soak up the beverages.  I got a cocktail called the Damn Yankee (better than being on the losing side of the \\"War of Northern Agression\\", or as I like to call it, the war where a bunch of rich white guys sent poor white guys to die so they could keep slaves, and let's not kid ourselves, the war was largely about slavery).  ANYWAY, the Damn Yankee had, among other things, bourbon, maple liquor, and a house-made brandy cherry.  It was a mighty strong and tasty drink.  Sweet Cheeks also has moonshine on the menu, which I will have to try the next time.\\n\\nYou can get trays of BBQ in various combinations (and varying prices).  I got the 1/2 rack of Berkshire pork ribs which comes with one hot and one cold side, pickles, and white bread for $19.  Sides are great, especially the collared greens which, with a splash of vinegar, was probably some of the best I've had.  Even the coleslaw, which I generally hate on principle because it's raw cabbage and mayo, was excellent.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really get is why the Q is served with slices of white bread.\\n\\nI waddled out of Sweet Cheeks fat and happy.\\n\\nThe take-away, get the ribs, get the sides, and get a strong cocktail.

However, passing a mandatory fee on to your customers because you are underpaying your underpaid BOH employees is just arrogant and ridiculous.  Just increase your prices by 3%.

So the prices weren't as wonderful as they seemed at first blush, but still in the reasonable range.\\nI ordered the hot and sour soup and the yellow curry vermicelli noodles and was not disappointed! First off, the hot and sour soup was served in a generous portion and was very tasty. The yellow curry vermicelli arrived soon after and while the portion wasn't as huge as some restaurants serve, I would by no means consider it \\"small\\". The portion was about all I would be able to eat anyway. I really loved the flavor of this dish- strong yellow curry flavor with fresh crunchy vegetables, pan seared tofu and well cooked noodles.

She's not picked very often for challengers to battle against...so maybe that's another problem too.\\n\\nThat being said, we were surprised that we had an AMAZING (seriously amazing) experience at Kouzzina in late October 2011.

Glad to say we enjoyed our time here.\\n\\nApps:\\n\\nCrisp Calamari and Lemon - Coated in Aborio Rice Flour with Spicy Yogurt and Garlic Yogurt $12.99.\\n\\n5 stars.  The calamari easily has to be the best I've ever had, anywhere, in my whole life.  I'm almost embarassed to admit it, though since it's at a Disney restaurant.  The waitress recommended it, raved about it, and I ordered it with doubts.  OMG.  Delicious...the batter had a tart yogurt taste to it, the rice coating was light and airy, and the calamari was tender and not chewy like most.  The dipping sauce was delish.  All in all, I could have eaten this dish all night long.\\n\\nOuzo Mussels - with Tomato, Garlic, and White Wine Broth $12.99.\\n\\n3 stars.  Meh.  Mussels, light wine broth, very mild garlic flavor and non existent tomato flavoring.  Meh.\\n\\nShaved Fennel salad w/goat cheese.  4 stars, surprisingly, a really tasty salad.  The shaved fennel was crispy, the dressing was sour but not pungent and the goat cheese really warmed up the flavors.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this dish.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\nTraditional Whole Fish - Pan-roasted with Braised Greens, Greek Olives, Fennel, and Smoked Chili (2 orders).  \\n\\n4 stars.  Yes, they give you an entire fish, with the head and everything.  They also offer to filet it tableside.  We declined, and went at it =)  The fish was tender, the skin wasn't offensive or limp/chewy.  The flavors were light and the fennel and olives took away any \\"fishy\\" smell which may (or may not) usually accompany a \\"Whole Fish\\" type of entree.  Excellent dish.\\n\\nSlow-cooked Lamb Shank - served with Oven-baked Gigantes Beans and Pepper Sauce $26.99.\\n\\n3 stars.  The lamb was well cooked, tender, falling off the bone.  But I didn't love the flavor of it.  The plus side was there was no \\"gamey\\" smell to it (as lamb usually would have).  The down side was that the sauce was so overpowering it was hard to taste anything else.  Since our apps were so light, this flavor profile really didn't go with what I had ordered as a first course.  Maybe it was just a matter of choice, but I wouldn't order this again.\\n\\nWood-grilled New York Strip Steak - with fresh Herb Saltsa and Kouzzina Potatoes $31.99.\\n\\n4 stars.  We ordered it medium rare, it came medium rare and had a great char on it.  The quality of the meat was great, and it was just a plain old simple good piece of New York Strip Steak.  No fuss, no muss.\\n\\nDessert:\\n \\nWe ordered the Loukoumades - Freshly Made Greek Doughnuts drizzled with Warm Honey $6.99 and something else (can't remember).  The doughnuts were a little dough-y and heavy, but still tasty with the warm honey.  A good try if you've never had one of these before.  3.5 stars.\\n\\nService:  Amazing.  Our waitress (can't remember her name) was the nicest no BS lady I've ever met.  She told us what was good, what was not, offered to go outside on the Boardwalk to call my hubby in for dinner when our daughter was taken outside to be entertained.  Super sweet lady.  Great service, and professional too.  \\n\\nThe demo/open show kitchen was fun to watch and we liked watching them prepare our Whole Fish.  YUM.  Unlike other reviewers, I really liked the interior of the restaurant.  It did not feel like a cafeteria to me, and I like the busy-ness of it all.

After ordering, the food didn't take long to begin arriving. It was okay. Some of the plates lacked flavor. And everything seemed to be mixed with spinach, which did not help the flavor. After the many plates and a few glasses of wine, we asked if its would be okay to have our desserts to go. They happily agreed. When the check came, they brought us our boxed desserts and even some boxed croissants, candies and cookies for the road. Sadly, the snacks were the highlight of the meal, and the dessert was highly disappointing. The goat cheesecake was a smear of cheesecake, with a large handful of cookie crumbs and a side of cilantro. The chocolate budino was a few smears of chocolate thing, surrounded by lots and lots of grapes. For $90, this meal was highly disappointing.

I wish they hadn't changed. I have ordered take out about 4 times since and dined in once. The number for dining in would have been 3 if   The first few weeks they opened the large place weren't so chaotic for them. 2 hour wait both times. Mind you it was not packed in there, the kitchen couldn't keep up with the grand opening crowd. \\n\\nTo get back on track, I loved this place. Now the chef that used to play his music is no longer there. Since he has left, the food has been noticeably worse. Which I hate because of how I used to rave about this place. The chef in the small restaurant had an eye for detail. For instance, when I used to order chicken parm out, it would be nice crisp chicken cutlets, tenderized thin, but getting two huge pieces. Pasta was cooked perfectly to chew. Even the cheese was crisped a bit to get those delicious browned bits of cheese on top. \\n\\nThis last order out today, the phone was left off the hook for an hour so I drove by. And to cut it short I ordered there, didnt wait long, but got a thick half of a chicken breast, over breaded, with sliced mozzarella on top that they threw on At the end. The sauce changed so much too. I loved the sauce before. Now ehhh. \\nPlease!!! Make up with the older Chef. And that would make many of the customers who frequent your restaurant very happy.

There's one very close to me at the convergence of North Lamar, Parkway/Enfield, and 12th Street, so I decided to check it out. Austin Java is not your typical caf√©. It's really more restaurant than caf√©, where you order and pay for your food at the onset, take a number to your table, and they then bring you your food shortly. Except for the fact that they also happen to have very good coffee (and serve beer).\\n\\nI didn't try any of their savory offerings, although the pair seated next to me had some kind of penne pasta dish that smelled and look delicious. I just stuck with the bottomless cup of coffee and a lemon cookie, cuz I am a dunker. Their coffee is very good. They offered two types of roasts plus a decaf, and the coffees are organic. Also, they have the raw sugar, which for me is always the mark of an excellent coffeeshop. No raw sugar...no thanks!\\n\\nI also saw that they have music performances, so I may be checking that out in the future. I went late at night on my first visit, around 10:00pm, and well, it was quite difficult to read with all the subdued lighting and everything.

The atmosphere here is pleasant and very friendly, the menu has just about every type of entree you would expect, your waitress actually brings you your food, and the portions are generally large.  A few things that impressed me were the decor (especially the fireplace and the terrace), the wine list, and the hot dinner rolls (as opposed to Italian bread). \\n\\nIt was tough to gauge service, because we were there on a busy Saturday night. We were a larger party, but we were fortunate to be seated immediately. Our waitress was very busy. We would not see her for long periods of time, but when she did get to our table, we would have her complete attention, and any requests were handled promptly.\\n\\nYou get a lot of food for any pasta dish you order, and I feel that is reflected in their prices. Though I would have been equally satisfied with a slightly smaller portion and a small side salad included with my meal.  My own entree, lasagna, was a little smaller than I would have expected for the price. But it contained an unusually large amount of ricotta cheese, and the meatballs did not appear to have a lot of filler (bread crumbs) in them. \\n\\nBe careful in the parking lot, especially on the north side in the front.

The food (especially the shrimp and fish filet) is delicious, their prices are reasonable (especially for good quality seafood),  the restaurant is clean, and the staff is friendly and patient and willing to answer any questions you may have. There is also plenty of parking in the mini plaza it is in, which is a huge plus in the Boston, MA area. When we went here, we ordered the lobster roll, the lobster bisque, fried shrimp, and a fish filet.  After we ordered, we sat ourselves in the spacious dining area. We also appreciated the fact that the food was served in a timely manner. \\n\\nThe lobster in the lobster roll tasted very fresh. The lobster was placed inside a buttered bread where the butter flavor was quite prominent -- more prominent than desired since the butter flavor seemed to overpower the flavor of the lobster in some bites. Sadly, the roll was a lot smaller than I anticipated, so if you are hungry for lobster roll, I recommend getting 2 rolls instead of one.\\n\\nThe fried shrimp was delicious and deemed by my fiance' as \\"one of the best shrimp I've ever had\\". They gave a generous amount of shrimp and french fries, as well as tartar sauce and a side order of coleslaw. The lobster bisque was also very good, and it had chunks of lobster in it. The soup also came with oyster crackers. The fish filet was pretty sizable and delicious, and it also came with a lemon slice and tartar sauce. \\n\\nA cool thing I found about the restaurant was how they have the live crab and lobster contained near the dining area. Hence, as you are ordering food or eating, you can sometimes see them take some live crab or lobster out.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my visit to The Lobster Stop and would visit again.

Both times now we've started with the portabella mushrooms (sooo good) and followed with a large Italian sausage, pepperoni and mushroom pizza baked extra crispy. The extra crispy part is KEY. Cooked normal-like is good, but asking for it extra crispy (like you're at KFC) is stepping it up another notch. It comes out perfectly charred and delicious! Don't forget that part. \\n\\nOn our last visit I tried the white sangria and it was wayyy too sweet for me. I honestly don't even know what I was thinking when I ordered it, seeing as sangria is very often made with sweet wine, which I do not love. \\n\\nBut our server saw my face as I took a sip and very kindly offered to have it remade for me with club soda instead of sprite.

I have been going to this chain for years. I don't expect fine dining service, and I don't mind if there is a hiccup or two during my visit. I am a server, so I understand that stuff happens. However, I visited this location with my father about a week ago, around 6pm. While there was no one waiting ahead of me, and plenty of open tables (even though most of them were dirty), it took us 10 minutes to be seated. A manager showed us to our table and said \\"I don't know who's in what section, but someone will be with you eventually.\\" Really??? You couldn't just fake it and say \\"You're server will be with you soon.\\" ?\\n\\nAfter that we waited another 15 minutes for our server to get to our table. Because it was dinner time, the restaurant began to fill up. Instead of saying hi, and asking us if we were ready to order, he asked if we knew if the table next to us sat down before or after us. Again, really??? \\n\\nFinally we ordered, and while our food took a long time to come out (Which I expected at this point), it came out hot and correct. Our experience was fine from that point on. The tables near us were not so lucky. People waited on average 15 to 20 minutes for anyone to come to their table, and it took usually another 20 minutes for them to even get drinks. Not one table was cleaned during my visit, forcing servers to sit 4 tops at 6 top tables, leaving a poor family of 5 waiting for almost an hour to be sat. And to top it all off, one family sat down shortly after my father and I, and still had no one come to their table by the time we were done with our meal (The entire visit took almost an hour). \\n\\nI went over to a manager who was standing around by the service station, while her staff tried as hard as they could to do their job (even though none of them seemed to have much hustle in them. But who can blame them when management just stands around, and doesn't even know who's supposed to be where). I told her about the long wait times, and she just laughed at me, like she thought I was joking. Then I told her about the table who still hadn't had service, and were sitting there for almost an hour. She gave me a general apology and then said that she had no idea, but some one would get to them soon. \\n\\nI sent a letter through the Steak n' Shake website, hoping that maybe something might be done about this. It's obvious that everyone in that location (management especially) needs some serious retraining. But all I got back was an email that said \\"Thanks for your feed back.

The couple of times I've come here with a hungry belly I've been disappointed. Looking at the menu, I picked fish and chips my first time because I didn't want something as heavy as a burger/sandwich so it seemed fish and chips would be perfect. The fish and chips come at $14 for salmon or $18 for halibut so I ordered salmon since $18 seemed a lot for classic pub fare. Let's just say, salmon really isn't meant to be deep fried and the portion of the 3 pieces of salmon I got was small for $14. So, like a fool, the second time I come here hungry and looking at the menu the only thing that seems like a spot on middle-of-The-road meal was again fish and chips. Due to my last experience, I decided to pony up $18 for the halibut.  What a mistake! While they were much more tasty this time I got the 3 tiniest little strips of fish I have ever seen at a restaurant. I've seen chicken tenders bigger than that, and for almost twenty bucks! Come for beer, stay away from fish and chips"},{"name":"Saz√≥n","address":"1816 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If you take a look at my other reviews you will find I am on a quest to find authentic interior Mexican food. I was born in Mexico and lived there until about 12 years ago. Lately there are a couple places in Austin where you can get pretty awesome authentic Mexican food. This is one of them.\\n\\nFirst, the salsas are quite awesome. I tried all three: red, green and orange - all three were really good. It's no surprise Sazon has won a number of Austin Salsa contests.\\n\\nThen we tried the sopesitos and the soups were delicious. In fact, I could eat soup and seopes for a meal. A pretty yummy meal. \\n\\nAll the food here passed the basic authenticity test: limes not lemons, white cheese not orange, no cummin and soft corn tortillas not crunchy hard taco shells. Speaking of which, Sazon serves hand made corn tortillas, which is always a plus.\\n\\nMy wife had the carnitas Michoacan .They were delicious: joicy, soft pulled pork with the right flavors, just like my mother made them back home. \\n\\nI went for the tacos al pastor, which were suprisingly yummy. Very authentic. As good as the best in AUstin (gueros and Maudies Milagro). My friends had the gringas pastor (quesadilla with pastor meat) which were delicous. The white rice and the beans were quite good too.\\n\\nOn the down side, the mole was not my faorite, but then again, there are dozens of mole recipes. There were easily four or five meals we wanted to try, so we will definitely be back. \\n\\nI took one star out just because the place looks a bit dark. Let's say It's not the most enjoyable location.  Abuelo's has the opposite problem: a beautiful restaurant and bad food. The food was soo good it really deserves 4.5 stars.\\n\\nReasonable price & friendly staff complete the picture for a really good value. If you like authentic Mexican, Sazon should be on your list."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had!

Tables were being moved around, carts of dim sum dishes peddled and swapped out, water jugs refilled seamlessly.\\n\\nOur server did a good job of answering questions about dishes. He had prepared, but artful explanations of the food which definitely sold it. When the dishes arrived I remember thinking \\"this is as good as it sounded\\", which means someone's doing something right.\\n\\nThere were some fairly long times in between courses ordered from the menu. I couldn't help but think this was to get you to order from the carts . I read to much into things sometimes though. All in all good stuff.\\n\\nFood/drink:\\n\\nOnly had one drink (michters whiskey, neat). It was.. A whiskey? My whiskey pallet is not refined. The list was long though so if yours is this could be good for you.\\n\\nI really like that they have a \\"Russian roulette\\" cocktail, which is essentially bartenders choice. So if you like trying new cocktails (my wife does) also a good place to try.\\n\\nFood is small tapas style plates with dim sum style plates coming by on carts. If you pick one of those up they mark it on a card on your table for your server to tally up. They're dangerous in a good way. Between 4 and 16 $ a plate and usually coming between your menu choices. Our menu choices took about 20 minutes or so, so we picked up a couple dim sums we were teased with. Brioche was the one that stood out to me!

My friend however, really wanted to be downstairs since the whole point of us coming was to hear the band. We asked our server to let us know if anything became available downstairs. Not even 5 minutes later, he managed to scrounge up 2 seats at the bar, so we moved. Prior to moving, he explained how to use the ipads to order and even arrange for our car to be outside when we were ready to go. When we moved down to the bar, we ended up just ordering with the bartender, totally defeating the purpose of the concept of the restaurant lol. \\n\\nFor drinks, I ordered the Bob Marley and my friend a strawberry lemonade.

I looked at the \\"Taste of Honey\\" too which sounded good and made a mental note to try next time. I must say I love how in keeping with the theme of the restaurant, majority of the food items are named after musical terms, I guest that's the musician in me lol. \\n\\nThe live band was a little late getting started but once they did, there was no stopping them.

We ordered these at the same time we ordered the smoked seafood platter. Our waitress suggested that she bring them out seperately since one was a cold dish and one was a hot dish. Good recommendation.

The fish was thick but the batter seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way and didn't have that crispy texture that I love about fish and chips. \\n\\nI had pompano upon the recommendation of our server. The pompano was grilled and served with fried polenta cakes topped with fennel soaked in white wine. The pompano itself was topped with (more) shaved fennel, grapefruit, and sesame. I was a little hesitant because I don't really like the taste of grapefruit but I enjoyed this dish a lot.

I asked our server if I could have meal on a separate ticket and she told me yea but it could only be split 4 ways and that we would have to figure it out, she then set the ticket down and walked off. She provided no help in splitting the ticket up for us and we had to write numbers next to each entree and drink to specify who had what which turned out to be very complicated.

Have them make some recommendations for you the first time cause the menu can be a bit much. You can tell they put a lot of thought behind not only what's in their drinks but also in how they taste. The Originator was my first drink & it tastes like a peanut butter & jelly sandwich. That sounds weird for a smoothie but it was surprisingly good. I've had about 12 different smoothies, juices & shots and enjoyed all but one. Prices are relatively cheap in my opinion but they do have a couple $13 smoothies \\n\\nI've stopped by for a couple shots before when I wasn't feeling well. Took the Medicine Man & the Noni To Fear shots on a recommendation. The Noni To Fear is serious business but the Medicine Man was no joke! Order a chaser. This location has a small patio with a few picnic tables outside. I've camped out here for a couple hours before to use the free WiFi. I'm a big fan of this spot."},{"name":"Le Bleu","address":"9070 Research Blvd, Ste 303","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love Vietnamese cuisine, have for years.

Even though dinner might have been just slightly better... I was very unimpressed with everything. \\n\\nIt was a while back when I tried lunch so I'm not exactly sure what I got, but nothing too impressive. I remember saying I wouldn't come back for lunch though. \\n\\nSo I decided to give dinner a try. I've been to this place a few years ago and remember really enjoying all of the food that was ordered. Yeah... not so much this time unfortunately. Here's what we got: \\n- Wonton soup: \\nI didn't get to try this aside from the soup but I was very disappointed in the way it was served. It came in this super tiny soup bowl. On the menu, it's priced at $4.95, but when we received the check, they marked it at $2.95. So I'm not sure if they made a mistake or not, but obviously I was expecting something a lot bigger if we're going to pay almost $5. The soup itself tasted really watery. No flavor. \\n\\n- Salt and Pepper Squid: \\nWe decided to try this since it was highly recommended on Yelp. Eh... Not sure what the hype is about. I didn't really like it and it had a very weird after taste to it. \\n\\n- Bean Curd and Mixed Seafood Hot Pot: \\nThis is always favorite type of dish to get. Although this dish was better than the first two, it was still not really that good. Portion was a decent size, but everything in there was mostly vegetables. It wasn't cooked very well so it tasted a little bland to me...\\n\\nService wasn't good. It wasn't terrible but not good. One of the servers snapped at me when I told him I changed my mind about the hot and sour soup because of the tiny bowl it came in.

I thought the ribeye special, priced at $23, sounded like a good deal, but it turned out to be a pretty lackluster steak. Served with brussels sprouts and romanesco (both of which failed to leave an impression of any kind), the steak was well-cooked, but underseasoned. The foie gras butter on top (which was the real selling point for me), was the only thing that added another dimension to the dish, but even that underwhelmed.

Being my first visit, I trusted the employees and added the pasta to the chicken piada. You then move on to the hot & cold sauces. I went with the hot crushed tomato one. And next is where your meal can go off the rails: the toppings. Zucchini, more tomatoes, onions, spinach and more. But no combo here makes sense. You're pretty much putting a salad on top of your pasta & meat. But the whole piada was decent. Although I think next time I'll skip the pasta and do more crunchy vegetables.

The only non-breakfast item I've ever tried is their pizza, and in my opinion, it stands up to any pizza shop in the area, though I do think you are limited to plain cheese and pepperoni.

I have had the afternoon tea multiple times at the old location and it had always been wonderful. Thinking that it would be the same, I invited a few colleagues to join me and really talked it up.   I made the reservation four days in advance for six people. Told them that there are two people who do not eat ham and one person that is gluten free. I was told that they do gluten free teas and that should not be a problem.  However, it seemed like the waiter knew nothing about our requests, and we were told that they have \\"run out of the gluten free tea.\\"  So, my gluten free colleague could only drink tea. As for the food, instead of giving us a plate of scones to share between two people each (which is how it had been in the past), we were only given two plates with four tiny scones each to share with everyone. The canapes were terrible - a tiny piece of poorly cut bread with cucumber on it! They have cut down the sandwich size as well.  The tea in itself was horrible. It seemed that it was sitting for a while before it was served. After serving the food, the server kind of forgot about us. We were seated in one of the back rooms so there was just no one around. We had to walk up to the counter to ask for the server THREE times - to get some hot water for the tea, to get our check, and then we eventually gave up waiting for him (for about half an hour) and walked up to the cash register to pay that check. \\n\\nOn top of it all, they have changed their afternoon tea price from $16.95 to $18.95 - that is what we were charged.

In fact, it looked like they had actually taken a little bit of thought into arranging our burgers before wrapping them up. \\nWe also got one order of the Cajun fries to split. My friend insisted that we just get one order, and I went along. Good God that was a lot of fries! They were SO GOOD too!!\\nThe bathrooms at this location are immaculate as well. I don't think I could have found an ounce of bacteria there if I had a black light. I've been in doctors offices that were dirtier than this place.\\nMy main complaint with this place, was that there was this girl sweeping the floor, and she'd yell (more like squawk) every couple minutes. I don't know if it was supposed to be inaudible, if so, she was succeeding, but then all the guys behind the counter would laugh. At first I just thought \\"Well, I guess this is a burger joint where students work...\\" but it got to the point where she was squawk-yelling LITERALLY right behind my friend. It's kind of hard to enjoy a meal when someone's randomly yelling right behind you as you're eating. Could you at least let me in on the joke, if there is one?  \\nMy other complaint, there are no milkshakes...that was a let-down. I don't understand a burger joint that doesn't have milkshakes, especially one that seems to be going for a 50's theme.\\nAside from The Squawker, and the lack of milkshakes, this place was amazing for a little burger joint."},{"name":"Bittersweet - Cafe & Confections","address":"836 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"Bittersweet is THE BEST cafe in the area.

The cocktail menu sounded really fun, but since we had a bit more driving to do I figured wine was safer (we shopped for awhile on Pearl St. after lunch, so the wine wore off).  The wine was great, but what made it really great was the setting.  We were on a cute little patio in a courtyard, and the people-watching on Pearl St. was awesome.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, we tried the \\"avocado salsa\\".  Basically, this is guacamole, but rough chopped instead of mashed.  Whatever, it's really, really good.  Giant hunks of fresh avocado, the flavors were perfect.\\n\\nFor my lunch, I had the mojo-marinated shrimp tacos, which were recommended by my server. The menu lists fried shrimp, but she suggested I get the grilled shrimp instead, and I am so glad I did.  I loved them.  The shrimp had wonderful flavor, but the jalapeno cilantro aioli served on them was what really set them off.  They were awesome.\\n\\nMy husband had the grilled hangar steak with fries and chimichurri.  The steak was tender and cooked exactly to my husband's specifications (perfect medium rare) but the FRIES!  The fries were incredible.  So well seasoned, occasionally you would get a really spicy one.  They were pretty salty, but that is how I think good fries should be, and I couldn't stay out of them.  They were the standout of his meal, which is saying a lot considering they accompanied a pretty great steak!\\n\\nOur server was a bit aloof, but she recommended a great dish for me and was fairly prompt with service, so it's hard to say that we didn't have good service.

Not exactly slap-on-the-BBQ-sauce yee-haw Texan style, but a tad bit gourmet without the pretentiousness. It's famous too, something to do with Top Chef something or the other. \\n\\nLocated down the street on Boylston Street away from the more congested area of the city, the restaurant has space to expand to an outdoor seating area and a beer garden type area. The portion sizes are substantial, and as my friend tried to warn me a few times, no one leaves hungry here. In fact, I saw lots of brown paper doggie bags sitting at most tables. \\n\\nI came hungry. Unplanned, but a good thing, as we ordered two starters of griddled corn, fried okra, hush puppies and a bucket of biscuits each \\"the size of [my friend's] face\\" served with honey butter. The corn came slathered in a pesto aioli garnished with a leaf of basil on each ear. Nice and well spiced, with paprika and Parmesan cheese on top. \\n\\nThe fried okra came whole, breaded with crack. Ok, probably drug-free but I don't think it's ok to eat almost the whole plate by myself in one sitting. Which I did, of course.\\n\\nThe hush puppies came swimming in a sea of honey and served with a white cream sauce. What's this sauce, we ask? Don't know, but it's amazing. Normally, hush puppies are too dry for my taste but these came out crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. Sure, I will eat more. \\n\\nBy now, I'm wondering if we should be ordering our entree. Since I wanted both the fried chicken and the ribs, I opted for the fried chicken tray with two ribs as sides, in addition to one cold side, and one hot side. You can get one rib as a side. Brilliant, for us indecisive people. And when the tray came, I was full simply by looking at the *five* giant pieces of fried chicken. Um, yes, I think I can spare a piece of chicken in exchange for that melt-in-your-mouth brisket. \\n\\nThe fried chicken was delicious. I swear I taste a bit of truffle oil in the crunchy cornmeal batter. The ribs were moist, juicy and fall-off-the-bone, but I am glad I opted for the chicken as the main course. The potato salad is better than most. I would love to tell you how the broccoli cheese casserole was, but I hit the wall right about then. Probably something to do with the expanding half a biscuit in my stomach, and the whole plate of okra that I devoured in rapid succession. \\n\\nBut wait, I still have room for another yummy drink in a Ball jar!"},{"name":"Brodie's Seaport","address":"215 Derby St","city":"Salem","stars":"3","text":"In any city, USA you will find tourist filled locations and restaurants/bars that feed off the out-of-towners that have no idea what or where.

Once we were seated, it took the server 15 minutes just to bring us over our menus (did I mention there are 8 tables in the whole joint and 2 servers and a bartender were on). Once we did get our menus and order, the server returned with the wrong bottle of wine, only to tell us the bottle we'd ordered was sold out but this other bottle was very similar and at the same cost. OK, whatever. My food was delicious but it was my partner's food that was the problem. He ordered the chicken. Every bite he took he'd have a small bone or piece of cartilage he'd have to remove with his fingers, so much so that a large pile of chicken bones and cartilage formed next to him on his bread plate. When you're trying to have a romantic dinner or celebration this can REALLY kill the mood. I understand in some cuisine bones are left in to enhance flavour and such.

Had a super delicious martini with blackberries in it that tasted like a sorbet.  The crowd ranged in age but was very well dressed and professional.  Arrived around 11 and there was about 4 people in line, which is in a hallway in the hotel, and my party of 3 was let in as soon as some people left.  I appreciated that it was not too crowded as it was easy to get drinks and places to sit.  There is one main room with a bar and large view of the street with bottle service couches towards the other side.  Everything has a green hue and beautiful glass sculptures.  There is also another more intimate bar down a hallway.  This is a much smaller room with a red color scheme.  There's also a patio but they were not allowing patrons on it as it was not quite warm enough for patios yet..\\n\\nI got some more friends to try out this place as I loved it on my first visit.  Unfortunately it was a horrible idea and I was embarrassed for suggesting it.  We arrived at around 11pm  on a Saturday and there was about 15 people waiting.  I was part of a party of 6, the first couple had already arrived and said it was an hour wait.  Another couple was meeting us there so we figured we'd wait it out a bit.  We quickly saw a group of about 5 leave yet the line didn't budge.  However, groups were showing up and let in with no discretion to their size.  Another person in line complained to a door man who said that when there's room those waiting would be let in and that these groups were buying tables and bottles.  A group of easily 10 or more people walked out and again no one was let in.  Frustrating to get lied to, if they were only taking those interested in buying bottles just say so, our party would have done just that as I'm sure many others waiting would of done the same.  I'm happy for the business that they were so busy with bottle service, but don't let the rest of us waste our time waiting if it's not going to happen.

We had started off with the Fagotini (a pastry stuffed with mushroom and cheese), and it was one of the best things I've eaten in a while.

This is really impractical for a weekday lunch, and probably explains why the restaurant was largely empty except for our party.  \\n\\nI had the hanger steak.  It was tender but thin, and was very buttery.  We shared mussels and escargot.  The mussels were excellent and the creamy broth in which they were served was good enough to eat with a spoon.  The escargot were very garlicky and large enough to require some real chewing (while trying not to think about what you were chewing).\\n\\n A coworker ordered the Kobe beef carpaccio, and the serving was much bigger than he expected.

We love the London Broil.  Had our son's high school graduation party here last year and they did a very nice job,  Every other restaurant wanted to charge a room fee, but we had a small group of about 25 so we had it in the room off the main restaurant and it was great plus they do not charge an extra room fee for that room. We did the lunch menu and limited it to 4 entrees and they charged just the regular lunch rate.  Every other restaurant I called would have charged double between the room fee and banquet lunch price. Love the bean dip and the corn fritters.  Best time to go is for the lunch specials and the early bird specials.  You can get some great lunch specials for just a few dollars more than the value menu at McDonalds and here you are getting real delicious food, not a crummy soggy hamburger. The decor is elegant yet they don't care if you come in nice jeans.

Unless that home was Crazy Uncle Milton, the child-molester's, then no, you won't.\\n\\nThe place is all white inside.  White walls, white tablecloths, white table paper.  The crosses on the wall give it a creepy, funereal churchlike quality.  (Not the kind of churches I go to)\\n\\nThe lunch menu is tiny.  Hamburger, chicken salad sandwich, soup.  Chicken salad. Maybe a chicken fried steak.  Seriously, there are less than ten things on the whole menu and they are not cheap.  Why are people eating here again??? \\n\\nI opted for the soup and chicken salad lunch special, which seemed overpriced at 7.99  or 8.99.  A cup of somewhat lumpy, uninspiring tomato-basil soup came with a little scoop of boring chicken salad in an iceberg cup.  Blah.  I saw my waitress once.  Just once -- she got my order and poof, she never came back except to throw my food at me.\\n\\nWorse than the food however, was a very creepy experience that will keep me from ever setting foot here again.  As a solo diner, I looked for the smallest table, because I am polite that way.  That table unfortunately happened to look into the one unisex bathroom.  After I sat, down,  a neatly dressed middle aged man came in with his mom and sat somewhat near to me.  He smiled at me.  He seemed to know everyone there and chatted with them.   We all then kind of got up at the same time to go to the bathroom. He was nearest, so he went first.  I had had to go really bad, so I was right after him.  When I went to that bathroom, it was FILTHY.  The seat was up, there was a puddle of pee on the floor, on the commode, wet toilet paper on the floor.  I cleaned it up as best I could so it was usable and just totally lost my appetite.  Then the guy's mom was right after me.  I was so thankful that I had cleaned up after that creepy man so that his elderly mother did not have to deal with that -- from her own son!!! EWW.  Then, when I left the bathroom and sat down again, totally grossed out, he made it a point to smile at me again.  (Vomit)\\n\\nPlace was creepy and gross.

Where to do start... it was pretty empty. Our waitress was nice enough but it annoyed me that she didn't seem to hear anything I said. I'm soft spoken but not so much that you need to say what after every statement. The bean dip was awful. It tasted like it had sour horse radish sauce in it. The breads were interesting. One reminded me of fried dough and was tasty. Those two bread items were the best part of the meal. I ordered the half duck with delmonte potatoes and my mother ordered the veal parmesan. We both got salads. I also got a sangria. The sangria was awful. Tasted like it contained now alcohol and just fruited water. Our salads were not that great. One cucumber and one tomato each. The lettuce was awful. I don't know how they managed it but it tasted both wilted and bitter. My mother thought her veal was okay but disliked the thick linguine it came with after being told it was similar to angel hair. I hated my duck. It was drenched in a cherry goo making the table sticky and hard to get to the meat. It was overcooked and incredibly dry. I have no idea how fresh it was. The potatoes were disgusting. Clumped together like they were a mound of paste and just a rancid taste. I tried one bite and that was enough. To top it off, I was presented with garlic spinach as a side. I wasn't told them before and I would have declined it. I hate spinach and garlic. We ended up telling the waitress and she gave us free desserts. We went with the sundaes because we assumed it'd be impossible to screw up ice cream. Yeah... whatever they used for whip cream was pretty solid and didn't taste anything like whipped cream. The ice cream was hard as a rock. We weren't going to complain at that point and paid and left. I would never go there. I don't know if catering to the older crowd makes it so they think they can get away serving bad, tasteless and just done wrong food but it's a shame they thought it was fine to serve meals the ways ours came out.

I can buy an entire container for that price! \\nSo, on to the food. I will say that the food was actually pretty dam good! We got an order of the cheese sticks which were really tasty. My son ordered a pizza with sausage and meatballs and honestly it was cooked to perfection. It was really good! I ordered the Lobster, Shrimp and scallop cannelloni. It was topped with crabmeat, which was rather dry, but the actual meal was pretty good. There were 2 cannelloni's, which was plenty of food for me, but for the price and if it was dinner, it should be at least 3 of them. There was only 1 small piece of lobster out of the 2 that I actually noticed.

The chicken pieces were meaty with very little fat or random crispy attachments like most places. The soup, I was not a fan of the soup, it's ok soup if it's labeled regular soup, but It was your hot and sour soup without the sour aspect and had a very peppery strong smell/taste to it, guess they used that powered pepper to achieve the spicy level they desired.

They had a new selection called the Braisers, so my wife tried the Cremini Pork Shank.  According to the menu description:\\n\\nOver a pound of pork shank, marsala wine sauce, caramelized onions, mushrooms, garlic rosemary potatoes.\\n\\nThe dish at $23 was not cheap for Macaroni Grill.  We were thinking the pork should be tender and moist since it was braised.  The pork came out TOUGH and DRY.  My wife's fingers turned red from trying to cut it.  We doubt the kitchen even braised it.  The dish had barely any sauce. Pork shank is a tough cut of meat and needs to be braised a long time.\\n\\nI tried the Parmesan-Crusted Veal Chop also at $23 a pop.  Although better than the pork shank since the veal chop is a more tender cut of meat, the final product was still dry. Instead of prosciutto, I received regular diced ham.   I could not find any mushrooms either.  Not what you expect for $23.   The kitchen was slow considering the restaurant was not even at half capacity.

Server was very nice.  Chips and salsa were fine.  Server said salsa had recently won an award.  Not my favorite in Austin, but still good. \\n\\nWe both ordered frozen margaritas, which we thought were delicious.  Not made with some crappy sweet/sour mix, but just the right amount of tanginess from fresh lime.  And pretty powerful for $5.  Our waitress said they offer $4 drinks for happy hour.  \\n\\nWe asked about the Pipian sauce and the Mole, and explained it was our first visit there, so she brought samples of each.  We each ordered a pork dish with Pipian and we were delighted.  Large, moist, tender chunks of pork with a warm pumpkin seed sauce.  \\n\\nThey make their own corn tortillas, which were light and delicious.  My friend ordered the enchilada, which came with their garlic white rice and black beans. I ordered the dish with the tortillas and borracho beans on the side.  This allowed me to build my own tacos with those wonderful tortillas.  \\n\\nOn Sunday we both went back.  I went around 12:30 and they were allowing people to order from their weekday lunch menu.  My friend went at around 4:30 and by then only the dinner menu was available.  \\n\\nThe decor is very South Austin.  Nothing fancy, but not ghetto.

Best Cantonese I've had.\\n\\nI'd like to say up front that, in contrast to other reviews, I've gotten takeout from here many times and it has been excellent every time. In fact, it can take 20 minutes or more to get from Canton Cook II to my home with traffic. Even so it is well packaged enough to still be hot. (I do prefer to dine-in however.) I hesitated to get takeout at first because of the poor reviews. That has not my experience at all.\\n\\nCanton Cook II is (no surprise) a Cantonese restaurant. Due to a variety of historical and demographic factors, the majority of Chinese immigrants before the 1970's originated in Guangdong Provnice, the home of the Cantonese people (and dialect and food). So, most of the \\"Americanized\\" Chinese dishes familiar to all of us who grew up eating strip mall takeout are adapted from Cantonese cuisine. Later waves of immigrants from Hunan and Schezuan arrived after Americans had begun to develop more of an interest in authentic cuisine. The point of all of that is that a good Cantonese restaurant is an excellent step up in authenticity for people wanting to explore Chinese cuisine a little deeper. It's familiar enough to not be intimidating, but much more interesting than Panda Express' sesame chicken.\\n\\nCanton Cook does have all of the familiar Americanized dishes, and they are very good versions. However, the expansive menu goes much deeper. A good example is the soup, while they have the typical (but VERY good) Egg Drop and Hot and Sour, which are Americanized, but adapted from authentic soups. They also have West Lake soup which you do not see very often in restaurants around Atlanta. West Lake is a thick soup, like egg drop, it has ground beef and egg whites, it's usually garnished with white pepper, coriander and green onion. It's definitely worth a try if you're an egg drop fan. It's similar, but different. More authentic, maybe better. They have literally dozens of soup options beyond that as well, thin soups, thick soups, noodle soups. Like I said \\"expansive\\".\\n\\nPer usual for Chinese Restaurants, the menu is divided by the main ingredient of the dishes, e.g. chicken, beef, shrimp. However, the variety available is far more than usual, especially seafood. Choices include scallop, oysters, lobster, crab, duck, among others.\\n\\nI don't think there are any bad options, but some recommendations:\\n\\nAnything \\"Spicy Salted\\". This is very similar to the Americanized \\"Salt and Pepper\\" you often see in calamari and shrimp versions. The Spicy Salted Pork Chops are outrageously good, but very rich. It's also a huge portion. I'd only order them if you had lots of friends to help you out. The Spicy Salted Shrimp are the best fried shrimp I have ever eaten. They are plump, juicy, crisp, salty, spicy, all at once with just a hint of sweetness. If you like spicy, don't miss the fried jalapeno slices hiding on the plate. The Spicy Salted Squid is also good, but I prefer the shrimp. FYI, none of these are actually \\"spicy hot\\" unless you eat the jalapenos.\\n\\nBeef Chow Fun (Dry). This was actually the reason I first tried Canton Cook. I'd read about Chow Fun, but had never had an opportunity to try it. Not many restaurants in Atlanta serve it. If you like Lo Mein, Chow Fun is your new best friend. They offer it in sauced or dry versions. The sauced version comes in a brown gravy with bok chow, it's good. The Dry version is stir fried with just a little sweet and tangy sauce, it's garnished with bean sprouts and onions.\\n\\nHot Pot. My wife does not like eggplant. However, the eggplant hot pot (with pork) is her favorite dish here. That tells you what you need to know. The chicken hot pot is also very good.\\n\\nKung Pao Chicken and Chicken with Mixed Vegetables. More authentic, excellent versions of takeout standards.\\n\\nWor Sue Duck. I can best describe this as crispy duck nuggets with mixed vegetables. It's a platter of vegetables in a sweet and sour brown gravy topped with crispy fried bits of roast duck. If you like chicken nuggets dunked in sweet and sour sauce, these are the droids you're looking for.\\n\\nThe Snow Pea Tips are like really good sauteed spinach. \\n\\nService is what you find at many authentic Chinese restaurants. It's a cultural difference. In America we expect Chet at Chili's to greet us with a big smile and flair. In Chinese culture, overt familiarity would be rude and presumptuous. So, the service can seem brusque and rude to Americans, but it's just a difference of expectations. They are attentive and responsive, just not friendly or solicitous.\\n\\nPrices are very fair for what you're getting."},{"name":"Full English","address":"2000 Southern Oaks Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Short and simple. \\n\\nLoved it.

After a brief look at the menu I realized that it was different.  No problem, I'm always up for trying something new.\\n\\nSo I guess Shiraz Grill had been open less than a week and the new signage hadn't been installed yet.  The menu contained your typical Mediterranean fare: gyros, kebabs, hummus, falafal, etc.  The prices were fair, most entrees were in the mid to low teens.  I ordered the falafal plate and my wife had a shirazi salad and a mazeh plate (hummus, some yogurt dish and stuffed grape leaves).  The wine list was pretty sparse.\\n\\nThe food was good, but nothing that knocked my socks off.  My falafal plate was pretty packed with yummy fried balls of goodness, a healthy portion of salad and baba ganoush.  My wife's salad was good sized and tasty, the mazeh was also well proportioned.  For desert we shared a piece of baklava.  In total the meal was a good value,  less than $50 for food, wine and desert.\\n\\nThe service was very friendly although a bit slow.  After hearing that they'd been open for only a few days, I couldn't fault them much for the speed since they are still getting their feet under them.  Many on the staff thanked us repeatedly for dining there even after realizing it wasn't Everett St any more.  They said that they had several would be patrons get up and walk out after they realized the change.\\n\\nI'm giving Shiraz Grill 3 stars at this time since I think they're a good restaurant, but they do have room for improvement.  The food is good, but really nothing special, at least it is a good value.  The service does need some refinement, but nothing that shouldn't come with time.  I will likely be going back and it will be interesting to see how Shiraz Grill matures."},{"name":"Extreme Pita","address":"515 Congress, Ste 130","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"(channeling monster truck announcer in 3....2....)\\n\\nsunday!\\nSunday!\\nSSUUNNDDAAY!\\n\\nThat'srightladiesandgentleman,rightnowyoutoocanbeoverwhelmedbythesensationalface-meltingamazingnessthatis\\n\\nEXTREME!!!

I looked around at other people's plates and it all looked pretty mediocre too. The server was cold, but attentive. Not the vibe I think of from BC. This is a great place to go if you want to get wasted for cheap on a Sunday and then eat mediocre food, so you don't fall into the surrounding water and die from being completely wasted. But do not go here if you want an intimate vibe and outstanding food.

I liked the emphasis on local and fresh ingredients and the prices weren't bad considering the quality.

I got the spinach and feta pastie- don't repeat my mistake. The pastry was perfect but the filling was kinda gross. Tons of balsamic vinegar, too much fresh thyme and grainy mashed potatoes made for a gray/brown/green paste that tasted sour. I scrapped it out so I could finish the crust.

Reservations weren't a problem as it was a Monday night, and this was reflected in the clearly half empty dining room. Still, the service was extremely slow--ordering drinks, getting bread on the table etc. Much to my surprise, our 20 something server decided to haughtily judge my choice in wine and tried to direct us to a much more expensive bottle. When we finally did order, he again had some snarky remark to offer about the wine I had picked. I had already been having a rough day and my friends were picking up on my quickly declining mood so one of them dropped a \\"well she can have whatever she wants on her birthday\\" line. Tacky, yes, but also a good way to tell someone that a) you're clearly upsetting your customer b) step up your game. \\n\\nWhen our food finally came, one of the party was in the ladies room. We weren't sure what she had ordered and whomever brought the plate out didn't know either. So they had taken her plate back to sit at the counter, and when she came back we had to flag someone down so that she could get her meal. I'm putting this on my list of things that shouldn't happen at a restaurant of this caliber. The next thing on the list would be the cold steak they brought me. It's cool though, a GM managed to pull herself away from texting or whatever to check in about 20 min later after everyone else was half done with their meals. No, I wouldn't like anything else at this point. \\n\\nOverall it was just a piss poor experience.

I was expecting to be charged for 5 oz. tasters of these, too, but the wait staff gave me little sips for free, which was perfect for such big beers.\\n\\nAfter sampling these, we moseyed up to to the front bar to check out the rest.  I asked for a couple of tastes here too and was about to check out the food options when I was told \\"You know, we *sell* beer here.\\"  I told them I was happy to pay for tasters, but they informed me they only sold flights of the Buckman beers.  I apologized (which I now realize is comical...aside from misunderstanding their policies, what had I done wrong, exactly?) and ordered a 12-ounce beer.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we didn't stay for lunch.  As my husband exited the building, the guy who'd educated us the evils of freeloading (he was also the one with whom we'd had the pleasant exchange about the growlers) stuck his head out the door and said \\"Thanks for coming in.  Have a nice day.\\"  We did, as we immediately walked across the street to Cascade Barrel House, where we were greeted with warm smiles (despite the fact that the place was completely packed), offered tasters which we happily paid for (along with a pint apiece of their delicious beer), and enjoyed them outside in the rare March sunshine.\\n\\nFor the record, I don't think the staff at the Green Dragon was being intentionally rude, but I would like to offer a bit of advice (as an old customer service pro myself):  every time you face a customer, it's important to remember you're facing *that* customer, not your preconceived notions based on the behavior of hundreds of others.  And trust me, I know *exactly* how difficult that can be."},{"name":"Hong Kong","address":"1238 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I love the Kong for the simple fact that it is the best place to go at 3 am.

I usually go to the Starbucks across the street since they offer free wifi. Although, the Starbucks is a great place to study, they don't have conformable chairs and there is a long desk but you have to share it with others. Not to mention limited food they serve. It becomes a pain sitting on wooden chairs after a couple of hours. \\n\\nSo, I decided to give a try Diesel Cafe yesterday. Here are my observations: \\n\\n* Pros\\n- Friendly staffs, fast service.\\n- Comfortable chairs/desk, nicely decorated place\\n\\n* Cons\\n- Sandwiches are small and cost around $10. I mean, you can buy a much bigger sandwich from Subway which is located a few meters away on the street for less than $10.\\n- The place is little noisy. \\n- There is no free wifi, I think, it is a huge mistake. (however, there is trick to get free-wifi)\\n\\nTrick to get free-wifi:\\n\\nSince the Starbucks is very close to the place, you can try to connect their wifi via your laptop. But, it is highly likely you have very low or no signal unless you have a high-quality wifi card on your laptop. So, what I did was to use my cellphone (galaxy s3) as a wireless modem. I realized, I could connect Starbucks' wifi via my cell phone. First, I connected Starbucks wifi; then downloaded a simple tethering app and activated on my cell phone. Finally, I just plugged my cell phone to my laptop and got net connection through my cell phone freely.

I went with a friend for lunch about 2 weeks ago and experienced a problem that could have been problematic for others.  I looked over your menu and asked what I could get without onions (I just don't like them at all) --- Finally, we agreed on the pork taco with the pickled onions (removed), Although when the taco arrived to our table it had these onions still on the taco, I than mentioned to the food runner (some skinny girl with an attitude) that this was supposed to be without the pickled onions. She as stated before with attitude said she would go get it fixed.  So in a few minutes she returns with the SAME taco minus the onions, it was taken back to the kitchen and the onions picked off and we know this because they missed a few pieces when doing this.  In my honest opinion this is not a way to treat customers restaurants need to realize that customers special order certain ways because of either dietary needs, or likes or dislikes, and of course there is the big one (allergic) if they brought back the same taco with just the onions picked off and someone allergic had a reaction it could not look good for this new place.  I wanted to bring this to your attention that this happened and I probably won't be coming back anytime soon and luckily I just don't like onions so things are cool I am just saying be more careful what you do I realize that you didn't want to just waste the food on your mistake but still think before you do something could save lots of problems.  My office friends do go there every now and then but if I do return it's probably going to be to only try the churro....\\n\\nI am not writing this review to get anyone into trouble or but just to make you aware of things you do, even as little as sending back the same taco with just the onions picked off could have long consequences if someone with food allergies had this happen to them."},{"name":"Einstein Bros Bagels","address":"3010 W Anderson Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"You will find me here often on weekends.

Probably enough noodles to wrap around the earth quite a few times.  Let me make myself clear: I *HEART* noodles!\\n\\nTherefore, it is rare that I have a bowl of noodles so delicious that I wish I had room for more.  By happy coincidence, a good friend brought me to this ramen place while I was visiting her in Vancouver in the summer of 2008, and now I understand just why organic tastes so much better.\\n\\nI am a big fan of their bamboo carbon broth (dark in color, more savory and complex than the shoyu, features more umami taste imo), and their slightly fatty slices of pork.  The noodles clearly taste fresh since they have that perfect bit of \\"spring\\" when you bite into them-- contrary to noodles that have been sitting in packages for a long time.  A slice of organic egg to go with it?  Yes, thank you.  A big wooden ladle?  Sure!\\n\\nThe proof is in the pudding: I ranted and raved about it to another good friend, and planted the seed of obsession when we visited Vancouver together.  They have already gone back again, and really raves about it here too!\\n\\nSo what are you waiting for?  Heaven is waiting for you in a bowl.\\n\\nUPDATE:  When I went to Vancouver for a wedding this summer 2010, I got off the plane, checked into the hotel, and literally ran to Motomachi Shokudo.  Still delicious, mmmmmmm.  When I got back to my hotel, my friend had just arrived from the Big Apple.

I went here with a large group, about 15 of us for a work meeting, and even though it was such a huge group, everything pretty much came out at the same time, and on time, and everyone was very satisfied with their meals, and I think hardly anyone ordered the same things.

If the right price points were found on the entrees and addition of sides, the sauces improved, Sweet Cheeks would clearly move into the 4 star category in my book.  Yes, the days of the Three Great BBQ spots in Greater Boston have passed: Jake's Boss BBQ, Uncle Pete's BBQ (RIP Pete), and Redbones were the standard bearers of BBQ in Boston; this far north of the Mason-Dixon you would be hard-pressed to convince anyone that great tasting BBQ could be found, but these three spots passed muster.  Of those three venerable institutions, only Redbones remains.  \\n\\nNow add Sweet Cheeks to the likes of Blue Ribbon BBQ and East Coast Grill - all places that serve pretty good BBQ but not quite awesome BBQ.  What these places lack is that \\"conversion\\" factor, making BBQ-naive eaters convert to BBQ fanatics.  So if the caveat can be stated that I favor Memphis-style pork ribs (which is the way I think pork ribs should be done), I wasn't a huge fan of the pork ribs at SC.  However, I loved the flavor of the pulled pork.  And the farmers salad as well was fantastic.  The BBQ beans weren't sweet/maple syrupy enough for me and had a bit too much meat for my taste.  Mac and cheese was decent.  The service was fairly good but could definitely be jazzed up a bit more in terms of friendliness (it's a bbq joint after all).  Sweet Cheeks makes me think about a place like Blue Smoke - Danny Meyer's joint in NYC, where the concept of BBQ and the execution of BBQ are almost there.  \\n\\nAll in all, I'll be back - to see if the prices come down a little bit and to get another taste of that pulled pork."},{"name":"Burger Stevens","address":"6238 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We enjoyed delicious burgers, a generous order of crispy fries, and bottled sodas around 2p on a Saturday.

The cranberry apple pie came out warm with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream - the taste of the two hit the spot and made everything feel complete.  If that wasn't enough, the cheesecake was also good, though I wouldn't have paired it with Bailey's Irish Cream Sauce.  The Pina Colada sorbet was also amazing, but like other Yelpers have noted, it comes out very frozen. \\n\\nWhile eating, I got to eye several dishes that people nearby ordered  - they all smelled amazing and is even more reason for me to come back!"},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Kick ass!

The server was quite pleasant and accomidating, the bread was fresh and very tasty and the fried Mozzarella was yummy although not very hot. Everything after the appetizer went down hill and fast! I ordered a bacon cheese burger and my husband the NY Strip Steak. Both arrived rather quickly..the Steak had absolutely ZERO flavor and was warm at best. The cheeseburger was far from pink (I ordered it medium rare) but yet was soft a little chewy and not dry indicating that it was old meat (hence no pink). The only flavor came from the bacon and cheese, oh and the bun was pretty tasty. My husband sent back the steak and opted for the Rib-eye. This was only a slight improvement from the first. It was luke warm and lacking any flavor as well. He had to keep dumping the jus all over trying to achieve something worthy of eating. I'm so glad we didn't attempt to try the 3lb steak they advertise so proudly for $59 or I would have protested and left without paying (would have tipped the server though as he tried his best).

The food, for the most part, was pretty good. The service from start to finish is the reason for only three stars. I don't know if they're still in their \\"soft opening\\" period but I kind of hope so. We were greeted quickly and taken to a plain table, not asked if we wanted hot pot or Korean BBQ. We had hot pot once before and had a great experience at another restraunt (hotto potty on 436) so we were excited to have it again, just closer to our house. I told the hostess we wanted hot pot so she had us turn around and wait so she could set a table. We were seated after a couple of minutes and our server came over shortly after and got our drink order. The manager then came over and asked if we were having hot pot?? and then told us we had to move to the next table because the one we were seated at didn't work. Ok..the server came back with our drinks at that time and was as confused as we were about what was going on. Maybe they need to work on communication...\\n\\nOnce we were settled again, we asked our server about the hot pot and he was, we will say, not well versed in the menu and literally read from it when we asked about specific options.  The menu is seriously lacking descriptions in the hot pot area....We finally decided on the beef combo with a beef broth and a spicy broth with udon, cabbage, broccoli, radish, mushroom and a side of fish balls.  We also ordered a tuna roll to start off. \\n\\nThe server brought out the soup pots first and turned on the burners but didn't set them to a temperature, so we did. Starting to feel like I'm being punked here. \\n\\nThe manager then came over with the sauce cart and said these are the sauces, you can read the labels to know what is what and the bowls are below and then told us he would push the cart over to the end of the seating area we were in and we could just go over and make the sauce we wanted over there. Ok...now I'm convinced we're on candid camera or something.  Afterall, the place we first had hot pot made the sauce for you at your table and left the ingredients at the table through the meal. But ok. We went over and made our sauces with the somewhat limited options and returned to the table. \\n\\nThe server came out a bit later with the beef and veggie platter and the udon.  No fish balls and no rice, as the menu described came with the combo. When I asked him about those items, he said the fish should have been on the platter and then asked if we wanted the rice...that he didn't know it came with it. It was all just a little off putting to us.   \\n\\nWe started cooking with no direction on how long each item should take to cook but we managed. The beef broth was pretty flavorless but everything else was pretty spot on. \\n\\nOverall, the food was good but the experience kind of ruined it for us. We want to try the Korean BBQ but I don't know that we will return to this place for that.

I'd just love to be able to get a side salad with it or a half of a sandwich that actually went well with it.\\n\\nAs for service, I mention it because I've had cashiers here totally ignore me, wander off mid paying for something, and just generally be bad at life. I've also had cheerful, prompt, awesome service. Expect somewhere in the middle -- not good, not horrible. I mean, all you're doing is paying for something (possibly getting bread or a baked item)--it should be pretty seamless. It's not. Soup comes with bread but only 1/3 people actually offer it to you. For some reason, others you will have to basically beg for a bag for 3-4 items even. Don't get me started on the no napkins thing (they're behind the counter, so if they forget, you don't have napkins).\\n\\nAll in all, I say go if you're in a hurry and get the chocolate chip cookie, not the brownie (they're dry and awful--definitely not worth the calories). The chocolate chip cookie, however, is divine."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Server and/or kitchen completely forgot our order, we saw 5 other couples seated after us get their entire order before the wait staff actually acknowledged they screwed up.

We chose two of their most popular broths to try, and a beef and pork combo for the meat portions. The meat combo came out with 12 slices, but they were cut very thick and were a bit chewy.

It's cute inside, VERY comfortable and can be relaxing. It's got sort of a light rustic feel to it and hometown feeling. While I have always enjoyed the interior of the place, the food is so-so. The reason I say this is because I keep feeling as though it's missing something - perhaps more food. My first lunch there, I had the meatloaf sandwich. You get a choice of bread and if you want it toasted or not. The meatloaf was like a gyro with Greek seasonings. Quite good but a sandwich is all you get. Nothing else comes with it except maybe a slice of orange. It's a sad plate of food when it comes to you and you see a toasted sandwich and that's it. There are no combo type plates in the sandwich menu. You get a sandwich with no chips or a pasta side. I ordered a tea and I was happy to see there were three choices to serve yourself. Quite nice! I just wish something came with the sandwich like a salad which would hardly cost anything on their side to add to the plate.  The kids meals are very simple. Tou get a few choices.They have a cheese sandwich which is exactly that and they don't ask if you want any sauces like mayo or something.  It comes with a juice box and two slices of apple and two of orange.\\nOur total was $17 and change. Just crazy.\\n\\nOn another day, I had the roast beef sandwich. I chose for it to be toasted and hoped that this sandwich would actually come with a side because the meatloaf was actually a thick one and didn't look as sad as this one, making this sandwich look like it's missing something. There was hardly any roast beef and the sandwich was pressed so hard in a panini press that it was maybe an inch thick IF that. The flavor was only okay. The beef had no flavor and I got maybe two slices which was hard enough that it pulled out of the sandwich in one bite, leaving me with bread left. I wasn't full and I wasn't just okay. I could have still had more. The kids sandwich bread is so thick that it's too big for their mouths. My son ended up just eating the bread separately. Again, being at nearly $20, it's not worth it. I could spend that same amount on both of my kids and me together somewhere else.\\n\\nI'd probably only come back for coffee or tea. The food isn't worth the price.

The menu had several options to choose from. I really wanted to try the crispy duck, but wasn't sure if I'd like it. I explained to the hostess/waitress that this was my first time dining and asked if she would consider a half order at half price (not like anyone was around to witness it). She declined, so I ended up ordering orange beef and my daughter had crispy honey chicken. I was baffled as to why my dish (orange beef) was just luke warm upon delivery as we were the only people in the restaurant. The beef was also very tough. The honey chicken was pretty good, it came with soup, rice and an egg roll. She opted for wonton soup which was actually delicious. Wontons were cooked perfectly, light and delicious. We had crab rangoon as an appetizer. It was just okay, didn't seem to be fresh out of the fryer.

A deliciously large plate of cheese, your choice of steak or chicken, avocados, jalapenos...mmmm just all the fixins!  The tacos are nothing to be ignored either - the first time I had them they were too spicy for me (I'm not a big fan of spicy), but I learned that they automatically make all tacos with cilantro, onions, and hot sauce - unless specified otherwise.  Since then, I've fallen for their barbacoa taco - absolutely delicious, the barbacoa is always perfectly cooked and I love the flavoring (far, far superior to Chipotle's interpretation).\\n\\n I've also sampled the 'huevos rancheros' ($4.99), which they offer sunny side up or medium rare; and they come with a side of rice and refried beans.

The flavours had from the starters and mains were consistently sharp and flavourful. The meatball appetizer was not overpowering, and the meats flavourful, light and tender. The sauce was light and ever so tasty, complimenting the meat rather than soaking it which too many Italian restaurants can get caught doing. The squid starter was also very good. Though a similar tomato sauce was deployed on the grilled squid, it wasn't completely the same, making a delightful contrast between the seafood and the meat. I had the lasagna, which granted is a pretty pedestrian choice. Cafe Il Nido's version of lasagna is well above average when it comes to restaurant fare. The noodles are fresh and the sauce again, doesn't soak and overwhelm the dish. There's enough cheese, but in its own way it's used subtly so as not to make the thing heavy.

Heading home from a long day of work in Tualatin out to Forest Grove, hunger reared its head and I decided to head off onto Canyon Road in search of noms.\\n\\nAt about the second light it occurred to me: I've been wanting to try Yuzu for so long now with their brothy sirene call of Kakuni Ramen.  I'm alone, might be able to squeeze in the door--why not give it a crack?\\n\\nSure enough, there was one seat available at the bar and I was seated promptly. Seating note: during my visit, which was near the door, I heard them tell no less than five couples that there would be a minimum 30-60 minute wait for a table and one party of four was quoted 90 minutes.  Reservations are virtually mandatory if you're two or more, and they only sporadically answer the phones after 6:00pm (opening time)--so you may need to call several days in advance and be persistent.  A seat in Yuzu is a \\"prime spot\\" in Beaverton, and getting in has its challenges.  It's worth it.\\n\\nI ordered the house special Ramen (Kakuni) and their Saba appetizer (eight slices of wonderfully-marinated sashimi mackerel). \\n\\nI can't ever resist trying saba--it's one of my favorite sushi fish and it is difficult to prepare properly and readily displays its freshness--or lack thereof.  Thankfully, Yuzu's was wonderfully fresh, skillfully marinated and beautifully sliced.  It came with a side of the best wasabi I've ever had.  It is clear that Yuzu's wasabi is the real stuff--grated horseradish--not the water-added-green-dyed-powdered-mix that is provided at virtually all other sushi places.  This wasabi was much paler in color, and had a complex, full flavor, and was not explosively spicy---it's what horseradish should be, an additive to enhance the flavor of the fish, not steal the show by masking all the other flavors.  I caught myself just enjoying the remaining wasabi when I'd finished off the mackerel--it was that good.\\n\\nAfter a brief wait, the large bowl of Kakuni Ramen arrived.  I took that first deep inhale of the steam and....oh.... heaven in a bowl awaits.  Theirs includes some wonderful, fatty, incredibly tender chunks of pork belly.  It literally had that \\"dissolve in your mouth\\" tenderness and was wonderfully flavorful.  I added a bit of Layu oil (Rayu, chili oil) to the broth (which was just fine as served but I like to kick it up a notch) and also added the provided small dish of grated garlic and sesame seeds.  Excellent.  The noodles were great in my bowl.  Best bowl of ramen I've ever had, and well worth the $13.\\n\\nService was relaxed.  I suspect Yuzu is a place where, once you get in, you are intended to hang around a while, go through some courses, sake or beer, an appetizer or two, main dish, and then finishing dishes.  Just like the wait for a reservation or a prized seat, once in, food is delivered in a slow, methodical, relaxed manner.  This is not a place to hit if you have a movie in an hour and want a quick something.  My saba and ramen took 60 minutes total.  And I enjoyed every one of them."},{"name":"Maekha Thai","address":"163 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"I thought Maekha Thai was just OK.

Finally we ask for our check when no one cared to serve us. They brought us a check that had a ten dollar cover charge figured into the bill. We ask the server what the cover was and she said it was a door cover charge. We told her no one ever told us there was one and it not posted. She walked off and a young man came over. He said it was clearly printed on all of the menus. WE NEVER GOT A MENU and never even got to order food. He said it was the policy. I ask him where it is posted... on the door ..the wall...the bar ?  He said. ..its not ! He said we were not the first to be shocked to see it on a bill. He never offered to take it off ...and he said we did have to pay it even if we did not get a menu where it was posted. He did not offer to get the manager. The music was great. The band was awesome.

We walked down to Sweet Cheeks to (finally) try it.\\n\\nBeing super-hungry, I totally over-ordered.  We started with biscuits, hushpuppies, and fried green tomatoes. For my entree I ordered the 1/2 chicken with potato salad and mac & cheese. I also got a side of pulled pork which you can buy in 1/4 increments.\\n\\nLet's have ourselves a little chat about fried green tomatoes. I'd never had them. I didn't even know you could eat a green tomato without getting sick until I saw the movie. Naturally, come hell or high water I was going to give them a try. No offense Ruth and Idgie, but I really don't get it. They weren't especially tasty, in fact, they are kind of bland. Though I get the fact southerners will fry just about anything and most of it is good, I think I might pass on these. \\n\\nTheir hush puppies were...interesting, Frankly, they tasted more like felafel, there was an exotic spice profile to them that was more reminiscent of the Middle Eastern and South Asian cuisines. They weren't bad, but the seasoning did obscure the corn flavor that makes a hush puppy so special. And the sauce didn't really work with them either (I'm not especially sure what the sauce even was, but it was creamy, tangy and white). \\n\\nI'm going to cover the biscuits later and skip to the entrees. I don't remember the last time I had chicken that was cooked so perfectly, but at the same time, it was a bit bland. You have to dump some BBQ sauce on it (which also has a spice profile that is more east than south). \\n\\nThe pulled pork was also bland on its own, here's my philosophy about that: you either give it a really good rub to make the meat savory and fragrant so it can live on its own, or you stew it in BBQ sauce. Serve it the way you want the diner to have it.  As for the sides, the potato salad was firm and chunky, which is fine if you're into that, but it too was under-seasoned. A little more salt, a little more spice, not too much to ask from a BBQ joint, is it? There was no salt & pepper on the table either, so I couldn't DIY it either (in fairness, I could have asked, I don't know why I didn't).\\n\\nThe service was actually quite good; our waiter was prompt, courteous and very helpful about navigating the menu. The beer and drink selection featured plenty of colorful options for beer, wine and booze. The beer-gria was funky but not in a bad way, the \\"epa\\" was damn tasty.\\n\\nSo, after all that, this place really is a mixed bag. But if they sold nothing but those huge, heavenly, biscuits, I'd make it rain stars. Seriously, you cannot not order them. If anything, I would go here just to get biscuits to go so I could have them for breakfast with strawberry jam, or make some breakfast sandwiches -- anything! They are simply the very best biscuits I've ever had in my entire life. \\n\\nDoes that warrant four stars? I was tempted to be generous, but in the end, when you go out to eat, you go for the entrees. The chef really hasn't hit on quite the right flavor for the core offerings. That said, even if the food's a bit bland overall, the biscuits and the great service would bring me back."},{"name":"Rolling In Thyme & Dough","address":"333 W Hwy 290","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4","text":"Probably one of my favorite breakfast joint!

So we did. It was packed, always a good sign. We started our meal with biscuits and flavored butter. Four huge, warm biscuits.  Too bad they don't have half orders, because you really want them, but you also want to save room for BBQ. We had pulled chicken and brisket, we opted for both a brisket sandwich and platter. Let me just say that the brisket was the most tender brisket I have ever had. It literally melts in your mouth. There were three sauces on the table, regular, vinegar based and very hot. We did not try the hot, but the others were great. The farmer's salad was really good - Interesting, crunchy, flavorful. Mac and Cheese great and the broccoli mac very good, too.  The platter was a lot of food. In my opinion, the bread is a waste...if you want to make a sandwich, just order a sandwich. Cut the price a bit on the platter and put bread on the menu as a side for those who really want it. The platter is also a lot of food, so ordering a sandwich might be a better option for some.We didn't really know how to gauge how much food to order, as we hadn't been there before. We took a lot home...not sorry about that, though. Next time, I will pick and choose better. Sweet Cheeks was a fun place, especially outside on a very lovely night. The interior restaurant was very loud and lively. All around great food and a fun experience. This is not a budget venue, but you can order less and still have a great meal. The quality, especially for something where you notice the difference between good and great, as in brisket, justifies the pricing. ps...the pickles and onions are a nice touch on the platter.

After a few bites and tasting what really felt like butter, I asked him if there was butter in the dish, he went to the kitchen and came back to tell me \\"yes there is a little bit of butter\\" then I freaked out because I am lactose intolerant and vegan, so I do not wish to eat butter especially when there is no need for it in a dish! A little bit is still too much.\\nAfter I told him all that, he repeated \\"no there is butter\\" which is completely different from what he had said before and what other people at the table heard.\\nNeedless to say, I did not finish the dish and based on how I felt during the afternoon, there was freaking butter on the quinoa.\\nBottom line, if you're vegan or have dietary restrictions, don't bother with this place.

We got there around 10:30pm and didn't get in until 12:30am...yeah 2 HOUR WAIT! I've never waited that long for clubs/lounges/bars, not even in LA or vegas with top DJs playing, and this is for a freakin' lounge?!? Ridiculous. There was someone ahead of us who got turned down after waiting for almost 2 hours because he had a white shirt underneath his blazer (did I mention they're VERY strict with their dress code of collared shirt and dress shoes?) The guy was very pissed and almost got into a fight with the bouncer. I don't blame him either. Couldn't they turn him down earlier and not making him wait that long? It seems like they let 2 people in for every 10 people that leave\\nOnce we got inside, there was a loungy area and a dance floor area, but the place was EMPTY. You can count the number of people dancing with 2 hands. When we tried to go to the dance area, they told us to wait in line again. Another wtf moment right there...it's not even crowded. They finally let us in after couple minutes wait. \\nMusic is good (top 40s, house, rock...nothing special). \\nDrinks are expensive and forget about pregaming before. With the 1-2 hour wait, you'll be completely sober by the time you get in\\n\\nThis place has a potential to be an amazing place if they work out some of the issues (friendlier staffs, the wait, etc..), but for now there are better places out there.\\n\\nMy first yelp review...2 stars"},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I went to this brunch spot after a few people recommended it to me.

He had the Mediterranean omelette while I settled on 2 eggs over easy which were cooked nicely. The best part of this meal was the jam and hot sauce they gave us. We were so curious as to what was in the jam that we asked what was in it... they told us it was a combination of pineapple and banana.

The bald, long bearded guy totally got me and suggested a oskar blues, mama's little yella pils - it was perfect.  A light color, golden beer with a smooth clean taste.  And, even more fun it was served in a jar.\\n\\nThe restaurant, is a large open space with long bench tables that seat people as they arrive, usually sharing the table with other diners.  \\n\\nI ordered a \\"Sweet Cheeks Tray.\\"  The biggest tray of food landed in front of me.  I was at a loss of where to start.  My food tray consisted of the Pulled Pork with Mac & Cheese, Coleslaw and two huge slices of white bread.  \\n\\nThe pulled pork was smoked, salty goodness, splashed with some barbeque sauce, it truly did alight my taste buds and I tried very hard to eat a fair amount.  I did quite well.\\n\\nThe coleslaw was really good and different from any coleslaw I had seen or tasted.  Not shredded but large chunks of crisp, fresh and zingy cabbage. \\n\\nI wasn't a huge fan of the mac and cheese as it was a bit dry and lacked flavor but I  tried a quarter of the biscuit and boy were they good.  They were so huge, I know if I eat a whole one I would not have been able to eat anything else.  Warm and fluffy with a sweet, creamy honey butter that could have easily made this dessert and not a side.  \\n\\nOur additional dishes were the fried green tomatoes, fried okra, salt and pepper potatoes and hush puppies.\\n\\nThe standout favorite for me was the fried okra.  Incredibly tasty and moorish like snacking on French fries.  Brackish, crispy pieces of okra.  \\n\\nHaving never tasted Fried Green Tomatoes before I was surprised by the sweetness.  I thought they would be bitter, perhaps because they were green.  The batter could have been a little crisper but they were still good and quite juicy.  \\n\\nCrispy, nicely seasoned salt and pepper potatoes opened into a fluffy, buttery white soft center.  Exactly how fried potatoes should be.  Another favorite of the evening.\\n\\nHmm, what else did we taste?  Oh so much.

I heard from my dinner companions that Nutter Butter is American candy bar.  Well, that is just a silly name.  This dessert, however was not silly, it outrageously good.  I didn't think I could eat any more but I could not get enough of its salted caramel over sweet, creamy and sticky butterscotch and slathered on a Nutter Butter. \\n\\nOur evening ended with us practically rolling out of the place on full bellies and satisfied palates.\\n\\nI am by no means an expert on barbeque but this place is good good good.  \\n\\nCheck it out!"},{"name":"Taqueria La Fuente","address":"12198 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"Oh, my god.

I'm fortunate to live down the block from this place and although there are 2 taco trucks right near me, Junior's is an easy choice. \\n\\nCaveat: I've only had the tacos. The fish tacos are worth the 12 min wait and you can always call to order ahead and pick it up when it's ready.

It all tastes nice and fresh with the fresh onion, cilantro, and radishes. The hot sauces (both of them) are a bit on the mild side for me but it's not a dealbreaker. Whether or not it's authentic I'm not at liberty to say since I've never eaten in Mexico, but my guess is that it's pretty close.

I adore the laid back service, although I typically go with regulars who helped install their sound system and are treated extra nicely, so maybe I am not a fair judge. I adore the awkward clientele and the fact I am for once in my life amongst the least awkward. I adore the mural of the awkward clientele with random celebrities thrown in. All though I have spent a good portion of my life trying to identify each person in the picture, only to realize there is an answer key below it. They also have outdoor seating-major plus. You can buy growlers of their beer which are fun and make for awesome slightly sketchy gifts. \\n\\nI have tried their nachos with chicken, veggie pizza, and chicken sandwich. All of these were very good (especially the pizza) and their was more than enough food. I ended up sharing with the people next to me - it's the kind of place where that isn't so odd. Their fries are also worth trying. If you are looking for a place to relax and grab a nice bite and good conversation, this is the place. If you are broke and want to get completely silly off of one beer, this is the place."},{"name":"Caufield House","address":"723 Main St","city":"Oregon City","stars":"3","text":"I got a bad first impression with this place.

He insisted the order was placed at 6:29pm. By the way, we were the only people in the restaurant, the waitress told us that the order were delayed by a lot of pizza take out orders.

We were surprised to see the place was practically deserted, and we grew concerned that we had made a mistake in our restaurant choice. \\n\\nI barely had to glance at the menu to know what I wanted-- just a seriously badass medium rare filet mignon. And a diet coke, please. \\n\\nAsk, Yelpers, and ye shall receive. A yummy juicy steak is exactly what I got. It wasn't one of those fancy dry-aged bourgeois steaks, it was just a reasonably-priced nice little cut of tender meat. I tore that thing apart like a freakin' hyena, and enjoyed every single moment of it. Remember what I said about not getting in the way of a girl and her steak-- it may one day save your life. \\n\\nMy meat-munching mate didn't fare as fortunately. He had a prime rib that looked pretty unappetizing, which he confirmed to me later. Our waitress made some errors on parts of our order, but was not around for us to ask her to correct it (we weren't that steamed about it anyway).\\n\\nAs we finished our meal that Friday night, the Friday before Easter, it dawned on us why a steakhouse might be empty.

I am 50/50 on tapas restaurants - I always end up loving most of the dishes but someone always feels gypped with such small portions and the bill is usually a lot more expensive than ordering regular entrees, but you leave feeling just as full. So, it's a good way to try new foods, and I think it works better with two or three people than a large group. \\n\\nAnyway, Tasca is deceiving from the outside. It looks a little rundown in the dumpy strip of small restaurants and convenience stores, and I think a laundromat. But when we walked in, we were met with a lively atmosphere and a wall of people waiting to be seated on a cold night a few days before Thanksgiving. We put our names in, and were asked if we had parked valet. Nope, just walked across the street! I believe they told us 30 minutes so we pondered what to order at the bar, but didn't have a chance to get drinks because our table was ready - fine by me!\\n\\nWe ordered sangria, and boy was it delicious. I had several drinks before getting to the restaurant, so I ended up only having that one glass of sangria but could've had more. For tapas, we ordered the tortilla espa√±ola, calamares fritos, brie a la plancha,  asado de cerdo, and solomillo. I tried the asado de cerdo but don't really care for pork, but everything else was amazing. My date didn't like the brie plate so I was happy to take that one down myself, and the rest we split pretty evenly.\\n\\nWe were very happy with the service. The waitress was great, and I filled out the comment card saying so. The bill was what we expected.\\n\\nAbout a month later, I got an email from Tasca (I forgot I gave them my email on the comment card!) letting me know about their New Year's Eve specials.

Maybe 7 or 8 years old.  I was somewhere in Atlanta with my parents, maybe evacuating a hurricane?  I used to really, really love smoked turkey and that was pretty much the only kind of sandwich I would eat.  I remember stopping somewhere and picking out a sandwich.  It was in a barrel and wrapped in paper and it was smoked turkey on pretzel bread.  I remember thinking in my 7 year old mind that it was the best sandwich I'd ever had.  I always begged my parents to find me that sandwich again and they would remind me that we didn't have an Atlanta Bread Company in Savannah.\\n     Flash forward a few years to the grand opening of the Atlanta Bread Company in Savannah.  I was SO excited that maybe I could find this elusive, awesome sandwich from my early childhood.  To my dismay, the Atlanta Bread Company had no such thing.  They didn't even have pretzel bread!  I figured the thing must have just been discontinued or something.  \\n    Now flash forward a few MORE years when, just having moved to Atlanta, I end up and Buckhead Bread Company totally by accident because the place I wanted to go was closed on Sunday.  I ended up in the cafe part and got a ham and brie sandwich with roasted potatoes.  Both were delicious, but expensive.  \\n    As I was leaving, I decided to take a look at all of the breads.  Impressive indeed!  I made a mental note to stop by and try a loaf sometime.  Then, as I walked toward the door, I spied a barrel.  Curious me wondered what was inside.  And what could it have been but a smoked turkey sandwich on PRETZEL BREAD!!  \\n     Perhaps the sandwich of my childhood actually came from *Buckhead* Bread Company (or some predecessor thereof) and my parents simply confused it with *Atlanta* Bread Company.

I was craving sushi, and I'm cheap besides, so I was really excited to try this place.   \\n\\nFour of us went for lunch on Sunday.  The place is indeed cozy tiny, the sushi bar takes up about a quarter of the restaurant.  The decor didn't blow me away, but then again it was lunchtime, so no showy light effects or ambient music.  I don't really care about decor anyway, if the food can deliver.\\n\\nWe all chose off the lunch menu, an overall good deal when you consider how much you get for the price.  All lunch specials come with  the typical miso soup and a small salad with gingery dressing and a couple of pieces of fried onion.  The miso soup was nothing to write home about, the pieces of tofu and seaweed were miniscule.  The dressing was tasty, but only covered the very top layers of lettuce. Sad :(\\n\\nI chose the $9 luncheon special which included 4 fat rolls of tekka maki and 4 pieces of nigiri, chef's choice.  My nigiri consisted of a piece each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and mackerel.  The plating was pretty, the selection was a pleasant surprise, and they were ample portions, but the sushi tasted just \\"o.k.\\", nothing remarkable.\\n\\nMy husband chose 2 maki rolls (off the lunch menu 2 rolls for $8 or 3 for $11): a boring cucumber roll, (but the boring was his own fault for choosing, I didn't waste any stomach space on trying it. Sorry, cucumber is cucumber); and a philadelphia roll that had potential, if only the cream cheese wasn't so thick that it overpowered the taste of salmon.\\n\\nFor the record, our friend had the una-don (grilled eel on rice), which he apparently really enjoyed, though I didn't taste it myself.  If I give this place another try I'd definitely like to check out their bento lunch, which  includes a variety of tempura and, according to the waitress, the chef's selection of maki.   \\n\\nThis place would have gotten 4 stars from me just on the basis of food quantity/price, but it sits firmly at 3 because of the service.  They forgot one of the maki rolls a friend had ordered, and they didn't bring out any soy sauce (come on, this is basic!).  We had to ask for the soy sauce twice.  At some point we weren't sure which was going to come out first, the forgotten roll or the forgotten condiment.  I wouldn't ordinarily make a big deal about this, but from start to finish, we were the *only ones* dining in the restaurant, so I don't really know what to pin the flakiness on.  \\n\\nMy wallet says it's worth it to give Gari at least another try (lunchtime specials plx, until I'm convinced it's worth it to drop my dime for a pricier dinner), but I'm not itching to do it anytime soon."},{"name":"Bill Miller Bar-B-Q","address":"709 E Ben White","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"For breakfast tacos at the drive-thru.

I was familiar with their bottled beers already (b/t/w their Great Pumpkin Ale and Sgt. Pepper Saison are amazing!!!!), but I digress.  Our parking karma was in our favor and we got a spot right out front, while I suspect that won't be the norm, but only the rare occasion.  The place is nestled (jammed) into the corner of a u-shaped plaza with other restaurants and such.  If you don't see it at first, keep looking - it's tucked away behind another's sign.\\n\\nWe got there too early for dinner much to my lament, but there was still plenty to choose from on the lunch menu.  The menu consists of casual, pub-friendly food with an added flair such as homemade pickles or BBQ sauce, but nothing fancy (not that you would be expecting pheasant-under-glass from a pub).  Aside from the tastiness of the food, they put an effort into using local-grown produce and meat for which I applaud their efforts.\\n\\nNow we'll abruptly segue into my initial fascination with this place - the brewery.  While the brewery's bottled products are well known and loved (by me), their cousins, only found on tap, are a more illusive entity.  All of my selections were beyond amazing (Om, Nom de Plum, Higgs Boson and Cerise Cass√©e), I hesitate to point out my favorite to assure its available when next I visit.  Okay, you've twisted my arm, I'll tell... it's the Cerise Cass√©e - a sour ale that's been made by combining a one or two year old batch of ale with another that has been maturing for nine years, both of which have been laced with three hundred pounds of cherries for that extra sour zip. Just a tip: order the beer sampler to get a taste of these. I didn't see it on the menu, but my waiter suggested it... after the fact!!!\\n\\nOn the topic of service, I found our server, David, to be excellent. He was knowledgable about both the food and their brews, which I would assume to be true of all the staff by what I overheard from waiters at other tables. Aside from that he was very attentive to our needs, was also personable and good spirited.

There's no where to sit, though so we grabbed a seat at Dunkin Donuts, which is a few stores down.\\n\\nWhen we walked in, were greeted very politely.

The white meat chicken was so tender (used real white meat chicken).

The price is fairly reasonable, and since they have frozen one you can take it home to have it later, for a party, or a late night snack.

Inside, there are scattered tables and booths lining the eating area which are a little small, but cozy for a party of four. Nice big windows provide awesome views of their deck - and when the sun starts to fade, and they turn on the strings of bulbs outside, it is unapologetically, authentically Austin. I especially enjoyed their flower arrangements that were big, bright and summery.\\n\\nOur waiter, while fairly quiet throughout his service, offered knowledgeable recommendations when asked, and was decently attentive. Our food also arrived with impeccable timing - drinks that were ordered arrived quickly, and there was an even spacing between appetizers, dinner, and dessert. \\n\\nFor my cocktail, I had the Melone. While not usually a fan of spicy drinks, I decided that this one sounded too interesting to pass up. I'm glad I tried it. It was served with a large ice cube situated in the middle and was sprinkled with red pepper flakes, surrounded by drops of what I can only guess was some sort of spicy oil. It had a lot of kick, especially at the end but it was very well balanced by the fresh and intense melon taste. I really loved this drink, it was divine. \\n\\nOur party ordered a range of different items - the pork meatballs and the house mozzarella for appetizers, which were both  very good. The meatballs were topped with a nice marinara and were juicy with fantastic flavor. The mozzarella was soft, slightly salty, and topped with beautiful garnishes. \\n\\nMy husband had the Cavatelli, to which, by recommendation of the waiter, he added extra shrimp to. Unfortunately, the 8 extra small-to-medium shrimp that were added cost a whopping $12. My husband enjoyed them, but did not feel that they were worth the price. Otherwise, he enjoyed the Cavatelli quite a bit.\\n\\nI ordered the Grilled Texas Spring Chicken. The plating was beautiful, and the chicken was moist, well seasoned and nicely portioned out on the plate so that it was easy to eat - which a lot of places don't do well. The accompaniments of braised artichokes, green onion, pine nut gremolata were mostly delightful. The green onions, which were grilled whole were a little hard to eat, and got limp and wilted on my plate by the time I got to them.

Once I received the dish, the sauce was extremely runny which is not how chilaquiles should be, the shrimp was too charred, tortilla chips had no crunch at all due to the runny sauce and the dish itself lacked a lot of flavor. I sent the entree back and got the Carnitas Benedict. This dish was better except that there was way too much sour cream in the hollandaise sauce. After I took my first bite, I immediately tasted the sour cream as it was over bearing on the flavor. The carnitas were good but the poached eggs were not cooked correctly and the sauce was too creamy. I would say lighten up on the sour cream and put less sauce on the dish. It has potential to be good but it was not executed well during my visit and I did not finish the meal.

After the first visit I knew Tasca was good, but the second time somehow managed to exceed my already-high expectations. I'll focus more on that visit because I remember it better.\\n\\nFor Easter brunch Tasca had a three-course prix-fixe menu for $20. GF got lobster bisque, eggs benedict with filet mignon and potato cakes, and a chocolate torte. I ordered gnocchi and mushrooms in a cream sauce, stuffed Cornish game hen, and flan.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things about Tasca is the pacing of the meal. Items always seem to be brought out at the exact moment when you begin to wonder about when it will arrive -- the wait is long enough to allow for a relaxed experience, but never drags. This was true with the tapas  for our first visit, and it was true for brunch as well. After ordering, I was about to ask the GF when she thought the first course would arrive, but as I was about to open my mouth I saw staff coming over with the bisque and gnocchi.\\n\\nAs for the food itself, everything was wonderful. I got a taste of GF's courses as well. The bisque was creamy, well-balanced, and rich without sitting too heavy in the stomach afterwards. Ditto for the gnocchi dish -- not just the sauce, but even the gnocchi itself had a perfect consistency.\\n\\nI like turkey quite a bit, and Cornish game hen tastes (to me, anyway) like what turkey should be. Every last bite was moist and tender. The meat paired well with the stuffing. Underneath was a succotash. My tendency is to eat all the meat and starch first before turning to the vegetables, but delicious pieces of sweet potato convinced me otherwise.\\n\\nBut despite how good my dish tasted, I couldn't help but wish I had ordered the eggs benedict instead. The filet mignon was melt-in-your-mouth good, the potato light and fluffy, the eggs... I could go on, but you get the point.\\n\\nWe were so full after the first two courses that we opted to pack the dessert up and bring it home.

I do feel bad I've never had the pizza given how many reviewers here seem to like it, but ever since I moved out of the Medford area down to Allston, the trip up to La Cascia's has become a special occasion, a pilgrimage, if you will,  with a single purpose...to consume gooey marinated steak tips nestled between the softest, most delicious sub roll all topped with melted American cheese.

There are also always spots on/around the pie that are several square inches of just crust - this is a waste of high dollar real estate.\\n\\nI love pizza. I used to work at Pizza Hut when I was in high school. I made the best Pizza's that location had ever seen. People packed in all day to eat MY creations (Pizza Hut or Not).

Today I can tell you about Pizza from all over the world, and Sarpino's has the right idea - they just need to get some talent behind the counter to realize it.\\n\\nA lot of creating a pizza is about even distribution of toppings and timing in the oven.

The sushi bar takes up much of the room and you are greeted with a comforting welcome as soon as you enter. Onto the food...\\n\\nWe started out with a couple cups of miso soup ($2) that was served at the right temperature and had just the right amount of seaweed and tofu with a straw mushroom garnish. Next came the seaweed salad($5) that was seasoned nicely and had a taro root garnish that improved the typical seaweed presentation. Then came the scallop sashimi($12), which packed a variety of flavors using hints of truffle oil and wasabi oil that did their part to the flavor, but in no way overpowered the very fresh and delicious sea scallop. We then ordered the Naruto Fantasy ($10), this was a wonderful treat as it was a play on sushi using assorted fish filets in a cucumber wrap. The texture of everything worked perfectly with the fish and I definitely recommend trying it.\\nToday they were featuring Toro sushi (Tuna Belly) and it was served extremely fresh and was some of the best I have ever had in Boston.\\nNext we jumped into the Makimono section of the menu. The sushi rolls range from $3.50-$13 and show no shortage of fish. The spicy tuna roll packed a nice kick and a generous amount of Tuna for the $6 menu price. The Black Diamond Maki ($12) with a combination of lobster and avocado was executed perfectly with the flavors playing off each other. When the Rainbow Maki ($12) arrived, we knew that this would do us in. The roll was huge and packed with flavor in every bite. We were too full for dessert, as you can imagine, but the tahitian creme brulee sound very desirable.

As a former patron of Gari, a customer who frequently ordered take out and dined at this restaurant, I was shocked by the level of service that was provided by the waitress tonight (3/12/14). Here are the top reasons: \\n\\n* Upon arriving to Gari, the waitress did not greet/seat us. In fact, someone from the sushi bar had to tell the waitress that company has arrived (there were only two other customers at the time).\\n\\n* My guest and I ordered warm sake, and our waitress (who explained to us that the bottle was warm), never lifted a finger to pour our sake.\\n\\n* As we explained to our waitress that the wrong-order-of-sashimi was served, our waitress never once said sorry. Furthermore, our waitress took the-wrong-order-of-sashimi (which oh by the way is raw meat) off our table even though it had sat in front of us for a few minutes. Our waitress never once offered us the opportunity to keep the order, and in fact, served that same plate to another couple of customers.\\n\\n* Water was never offered to my guest and I.\\n\\n* The check was placed immediately in front of us after my guest and I had stopped eating. We were never asked if we wanted any additional dishes or desserts after our meal.\\n\\nWhat bothers me most about this list is the third bullet point; It's concerning to me that the waitress never once thought about how the raw food that was placed on our table was exposed. I also saw her serve the same plate to two other women at the sushi bar - which is extremely unsanitary. It certainly makes me wonder if the rice, miso soup, or any other pieces of raw meat that is served at Gari is also recycled from another table (GROSS, right?)\\n\\nThis type of horrible service is not only in-hygienic, but just awful. It saddens me that the original owners had sold this restaurant to such careless people - which isn't a description you want to hear for  a sushi place."},{"name":"Library Square","address":"300 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Great beer, ambiance, food and 9 PINBALL MACHINES!

Plus the guy behind the counter put sauces in my bowl that I didn't even ask for like soy sauce. The soy sauce made my bowl ultra salty (no one puts that much soy sauce in anything) \\nThe salmon didn't taste very fresh in my opinion plus it was a little on the chewy side.

She continued to do this even after AGREEING to allow us to turn up the lights so that the children could colour. ????\\n\\nThe food was atrocious.

And Cazuela's Grill reminds me a lot of that place. Why? If you read my other review, you'll know what I'm talking about. I feel like every one of these authentic Mexican restaurants is the same. They are so similar in style, their food options are the same, and all their food tastes the same. I don't know how they do it. It's like they're all owned by the same person or company. Maybe they are. But I don't really think that this is a good thing, because I like variety! And I hate walking into one of these places for the first time and already knowing what my experience will be like.\\n\\nThis was true for Cazuela's the first time I was here. Perfectly predictable. But the second time I was here was worse than I expected.\\n\\nCazuela's is located just north of OSU campus on High St. Thus, it's not easy to find a good place to park unless you get lucky with a spot on one of the side streets. It's just this little place right on the corner of High and Northwood. It looks pretty cute from the outside. I remember when this place suddenly opened up. I was living on Norwich at the time, so I was thrilled to have a Mexican restaurant just down the block from me. It was like a 5 minute or less walk from my house. But unfortunately for me, I just wasn't that impressed with it.\\n\\nI'll talk about the second time I came here since it's the freshest in my mind. We drove there and found a place to park on a nearby street. It was an afternoon on a Saturday and I went with two friends. We were seated inside since it was cold out and we ordered some drinks - not alcoholic. I've heard good things about their margaritas, but it was too early in the day and too cold outside. We were sitting there with our menus, ready to order for the longest time. Our server had disappeared after giving us our drinks and was nowhere to be seen. After about 15 minutes, he appeared again and took our order.\\n\\nLike in my review for another authentic Mexican place, I'll tell you that nothing stood out on the menu as being original. It was the same stuff that you can find at any one of these kinds of restaurants. I went with the carnitas fajitas because it just sounded so good. I was hungry and was in the mood to build my own fajita with all the fixins they give you.\\n\\nWe were all hungry. But we were in for a long wait. Our food took at least half an hour. And they weren't even busy! There were only 2 or 3 other tables in there at the time. We ended up staying here much longer than we intended to. And from what I've heard, this is common here. Don't visit this place if you want a quick meal. And I think there was only one server in the whole restaurant (which isn't big at all inside, but still). It was almost as if he was cooking the food and serving it, too since he'd disappear for so long!\\n\\nWhen our food did finally come out, we were ready to chow down. By this time we needed refills on our drinks, and our server was quite slow in refilling them. My two friends liked their food. They didn't really think it was anything special, but we were all so hungry that they were just glad to finally be eating. My carnitas fajitas were such a disappointment. I didn't think I could go wrong in ordering them, but apparently I did. The soft flour tortillas were good and warm, and the toppings for the fajitas were great - slices of avocado, pico de gallo, cheese, etc. But the carnitas (pork) just looked...not fresh. It was like overcooked and sort of hard. Hard to explain, but it didn't look fresh and juicy. It was as if all the juice was overcooked out of it or perhaps it had been sitting out all day. Either way, it was the worst carnitas I've ever had. I was able to salvage some of it and use it for my fajitas, but I had to pick around most of it because it was too tough and chewy to put on my tortillas. Such a shame, because I was starving and would have liked to eat it all.\\n\\nI didn't think that the portion sizes here were all that big, either. Both of my friends finished theirs quickly and I ate what I could. We all still felt like we could eat more. This place is pretty cheap so the prices aren't bad, but that's not really that great if it's not even enough food. It took our server quite some time to come back and bring us our check. And I suppose that I could have complained about my meat, but our server wasn't exactly the friendliest guy and he was hardly around, so I figured that it's just chalk this experience up as a miss.\\n\\nWhat this place might be really good for is sitting out on the patio and drinking margaritas. Maybe if you're not even ordering food, you can enjoy simple chips and salsa and their patio is really nice. It's surrounded by trees and looks like a really great place to sit and relax with friends. \\n\\nI left feeling cheated and I haven't been back and don't plan on it, especially since I no longer live in the area.

The dish was good, I don't have any complaints. I am not an expert on ramen, so I can't claim that this is the best place for ramen in the area (like many others on Yelp have said), but I will say that it was tasty! I work in Beaverton, so I am always looking for new places to eat lunch. This was a perfect spot for me to go on my lunch break. I showed up at 11:30AM and left the restaurant at 11:55AM. The meal with tip came out to be $14, which is more than I wanted to spend on a bowl of soup, but oh well.

Far larger than other local pubs with plenty of room if you were coming in a large group or wanted to rent out some private space, but it was just standard American pub food (pricier than I had expected really), and it's probably my own damn fault for ordering a burger of all things, but when you ask the bartender for her recommendations and her responses are the fish and chips and the burgers, and not any of the fancy pasta or fish dishes, well, whatever.  And truth be told, this town knows how to do fries.  Not quite as big as steak fries, but always perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, I figured I'd be naughty and have them just one more time.  The burger was good, as I expect a burger to be.  The Bass was good, as I expect my Bass to be.  The bartender obliged my request for a side of gravy for my fries because \\"chips and gravy\\" are one of my favoritist things ever, even if this gravy wasn't my favoritist gravy ever.\\nThere were some live acoustic performances going on in the back room, and all I can say is that I'm grateful they turned the music up in the main bar to help drown it out.

It is sensational and reliably delicious. I think it would be a giant success in any community it would serve across the country--and my sincerest hope is that one day Columbus isn't the only \\"chosen\\" city to experience Northstar. \\n\\nThis review is really a profession of my love for all things Northstar. My experiences at all locations have always been always spot-on. Here's a few of my personal fav's you can get at any of their locations (yes, in order of favoriteness):\\n \\n~~NS Veggie Burger~~\\nMy absolute favorite is their Northstar veggie burger. It is a grand slam homerun in my book. It is the best darn tasting veggie burger I have ever had. It is up there with one of my favorite meals of all time. Not kidding. The flavors are dynamic, the consistency is very similar to a \\"real\\" burger, their veggies are always fresh and crispy, the bun is toasted just right, and I would choose it every time over a \\"real\\" burger--it's just my everything. \\n\\n~~Housemade Ginger ale~~\\nSince you are there, or thinking of going, do yourself a favor and try their housemade ginger ale. Again, a-maze-ing. If you like ginger ale you run the risk of never liking any other ginger ale as much as this one. It is refreshing and sweet--but not too sweet. It's quite delish. \\n\\n~~Face-sized peanut cookie~~\\nIt's HUGE!! It's wonderful. It's calling your name--get it--it's so darn tasty.  It's great to nibble on a couple of bites after dinner and save the rest to eat the next morning with coffee. Tip: don't put it in the fridge like I did.  It's way better at room temp and then just 9 secs. in the microwave. It's a mind-bending cookie indulgence experience if there ever was one. I highly recommend it. \\n\\n~~All things brunch~~\\nTheir brunch is stellar, too. You should really do it at least once--and splurge: get a coffee AND a glass of OJ. \\nTheir fresh pressed OJ is everything you would hope for. They freshly squeeze oranges into a glass and serve it to you--it's the best!\\nTheir single source coffee is delightful and you get free refills.\\nTheir pancakes are made with ricotta cheese. What?!? Yup. And they are yummy. I'd tell my best friend to order them without any reservations so I think you'll like them too. \\nTheir poached eggs with prosciutto won't disappoint either.  \\nTheir breakfast burrito is another fail-proof breakfast experience. I've gotten it several times it's got a yummy-ness about it that I can't resist. \\n\\nI could go on, but I think you get the point. I've never had anything that disappointed me at Northstar. Pretty much everything is craveable and like I said, I really hope Columbus doesn't remain the only \\"chosen\\" city for this amazing dining experience. It's so good I want to share with my friends and family all over the country. Happy eating, Columbus friends, be grateful you live in the \\"chosen\\" city--be very grateful."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My family and I visited Sweet Cheeks for lunch earlier today.  We were warmly greeted and sat immediately.  The restaurant was about half empty so no surprise here.  We started off with some AMAZING biscuits.  My wife and son both had pulled chicken which was great and I had a burnt ends sandwich which was OK but tasted like it had teriyaki sauce on it which I found to be an odd flavor in a BBQ restaurant.  really enjoyed the sides we got of potato salad and mac & cheese as well as the sweet tea.  The only thing I was really disappointed in was the service in particular our waiter.  It took a while before he came over to take our order and we almost never saw him again until he brought our check.  Luckily, the kitchen works quickly here and they have runners bring the food.  If not for the waiter, I probably would have given 4 if not 5 stars to this restaurant.\\n\\nOn a smaller level, I was also disappointed that there is no kids menu.  One would think a casual restaurant like this would cater to kids at least during lunch if not dinner as well.\\n\\nUPDATE: I've returned to Sweet Cheeks a few times since my initial review.

It's a really cozy/comfortable coffee shop that has all of the necessities - great coffee, free wifi, outlets, a nice wait staff, appetizers/food to fuel any busy bee, and much more. If you're needing to get some work done, this is the place to be. On weekdays, it's filled with students and other professionals working away as well as with friends and families grabbing dinner/lunch. However, even though I'm here as often as I am, I do think there's a few things that Austin Java is lacking/could be improved, regardless of how much of an Austin staple it is.\\n\\nThe coffee is great - there's nothing here I can complain about. I'm not usually a fan of black coffee, but Austin Java's coffee is so great that I've been converted. You really get to taste the flavor of the coffee and the aroma is so soothing. Their Texas Pecan blend is my favorite, and they have a few others to suit any taste. Their blended drinks, such as the hot/iced vanilla latte, frappes, etc. are also pretty good.\\n\\nHowever, the food is a different story. Don't get me wrong, I've had a few items from the menu that I like - the pancakes are my absolute favorite! The gingerbread pancakes are probably my favorite ones, but all of them are served with their special cinnamon butter that makes everything taste delicious. Who can complain about breakfast served all day? The Ladybird burger is pretty good and their turkey burgers are decent overall. But for the most part, their food is pretty lacking of any real flavor, uniqueness, and taste. I've tried a few of their other burgers, such as the Shroom n' Swiss and the Black and Blue burger, but I've mostly found that the meat patty is just extremely dry and not flavorful at all. If I'm paying about 9.50 for a burger after tax, I expect a darn good burger. Their pastas aren't that great, nor are their sandwiches. They are standard and sometimes I feel like I'm eating food from Chili's when it's in front of me. I stay away from chains for a reason.\\n\\nThey do have great specials every day of the week if you want to try their food out. Mondays are two for one burgers, Wednesdays are half off appetizers, and Thursdays are usually a set price on a chef selection of pasta from the menu. They are all pretty good deals since I consider their food to be pretty overpriced.

The sides were pretty terrible, with the exception of the collard greens which were great, and the black eyed peas, which were good.  Stay away from the baked beans and the macaroni and cheese.  The sauces they have at the table were all overly sweet, and completely lacked in any depth of flavor- which was too bad, because I was hoping to use them to give the actual food I was eating something to taste like.\\n\\nI had been really excited, because none of the BBQ places up north seem to serve macaroni and cheese, which, to me, is essential.  The macaroni and cheese was clearly not baked, and was instead made with a flavorless cheese sauce and put into a cup, with crumbled, soggy Ritz crackers on top.  I would have even preferred velveeta- at least that tastes like something.  Lunches are served with two slices of plain white bread, which had already become crusted over with staleness by the time they got to the table.\\n\\nMaybe I'm spoiled from having lived below the Mason-Dixon line, but this was not BBQ.

In all fairness though, our meal last night was terrifyingly awesome.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars, is because I just can't completely justify the pricing they are using.  Even if items, maybe just the sides, were just a couple of bucks cheaper it would have been 5 stars in my book.  We had the Ribs, Pork Belly and Brisket, as well as the Salt Boiled Potatoes, Mac and Cheese, Fried Okra, and a couple of the cold sides (which I never even got to eat because I was too full).\\n\\nThe BBQ was really, really good.  The ribs were better than anything I've had around Boston.  They were tender/moist and had really good flavor.  The Pork Belly and Brisket were equally as good.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe would definitely come from the portion/value side of the equation.  It is expensive for what you get.  I think my plate was $24 (Pork Belly/Ribs/1 hot side/1 cold side) and that included 4 ribs and 4 pieces of pork belly.  This was a little disappointing.  I feel like there could have been a little more in the way of protein served.  Also, paid $7 for a side order of the potatoes -- which is just a bit high.  That said, they were SOOO TASTY!!!!  They are like mashed potatoes that are then deep fried.  I was dipping them in BBQ sauce and couldn't get enough -- despite the price, I would still order them again.\\n\\nDespite the experiences that other had, I thought the service was very good and the hostess was quite friendly.\\n\\nI will definitely be going back...just wish it was a little more reasonable from a pricing standpoint.  From the owners' viewpoint though, if the food/service is really good and people will continue to go back even if it is a bit too expensive, why would you lowere your prices?

I had heard the food was good, but read too many 2-star reviews affirming that, \\"I read all the reviews and hoped the service wouldnt be as bad as the last persons was, but it was.\\"  I had begun to worry that we had selected just a poor dinner choice.\\n\\nWe arrived at Winflo at 9 for our 9:15 reservation, and after a few minutes of waiting for a Hostess, I figured, \\"here we go again,\\" but the hostess found us, seated us and it wasnt so bad.  As we waited for the rest of our party to show up, I wondered where my server was...I was expecting the terrible service, but right in the nick of time, she showed.  Every time it was about to be too long since we had seen a server/hostess, they appeared right in time...so that was good.  After the initial scare, we never had a problem again with our service.\\n\\nOnto the food:\\n\\nWe started with the Prosciutto pizza.  It was amazing!  All the ingredients were so fresh and the balsamic onion marmelade really tied the whole thing together.  This was most likely the best dish that found its way to our table that evening.  \\n\\nWe also had an order of the Mussels that were very tasty with a great broth...HOWEVER...we ordered another order after our meal was complete (no, I do not know why, exactly) and the broth was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  It was not very good and I am not sure how the same dish could come out so completely different than not even an hour ago.  It was that off.\\n\\nFor our main courses I got the Fettucine al Pesto, which was just meh.  I love fettucine alfredo in all of its creamy glory and this pesto just didnt have the same creaminess I desire.  All of the flavors of the dish were fine, but in the end, it was just okay.\\n\\nMy sister had probably the best main course anyone had with the Cavatelli.  This dish had all the creaminess mine was lacking and I certainly did not want to hand it back to her.  Unfortunately, we were on the same page in regards to the deliciousness of our dishes and I had to pick off her plate the rest of the evening.\\n\\nMy mother got the Pollo Noce, which was fine.  It was probably the second best dish.  The risotto was divine, but the chicken was just okay.  I mean, I am not sure really what more you can do to a pecan crusted chicken, so I thought it was just a very plain, but well executed dish.  There are no frills with it, but it was cooked well and very tasty.\\n\\nJosh got the Italian Meatloaf and although I didnt try it, it looked good and he devoured it.  \\n\\nThe price point was very fair and the vibe of the restaurant was very cool.  The 3 stars I gave Winflo was a strong 3 stars and I would recommend this place for a date, a family dinner or really for anytime.  It may not be the best restaurant in town, but it was very enjoyable, the pizza was delicious and if I lived in Austin I assume I would hit it up again.  If they can clean up the attentiveness of their employees, which again, wasnt so bad this time, Winflo Osteria can be a very enjoyable place to dine!"},{"name":"Banrai Sushi","address":"9939 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Came here as I was staying at Rosen Shingle Creek for a conference.

Recommendations?\\n\\n    * We kicked off the dining experience with fried okra and honey biscuits -- a great prelude to the meal.   The over-sized biscuits paired with honey butter were perfectly sweet and delicious. The okra was lightly breaded, crispy and not greasy.\\n    * The pulled pork was my favorite, but I also tried the pork belly and short ribs which were impressively flavorful and tender.\\n    * And for sides?  The broccoli and cheese casserole was especially rich but still quite yummy.  The creamy mac and cheese with breadcrumbs and bbq beans were my favorites.\\n\\nThe meat comes sauce-less, so you can enjoy every bit of the smokey taste.  As a condiment lover, I tend to pour on the sauce but it just wasn't needed!  While I added a touch of the table bbq sauce and tad of the hot sauce, I didn't want to overpower the incredible flavor packed in the meat itself.\\n\\nRead more of the review at: http://bit.ly/uUyAbh"},{"name":"Noir Cafe","address":"29 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I ordered from this cafe through Uber Eats for lunch today and it was my first time getting food from here.

Standard, but on the better side of standard (J.Lohr, Mondavi, Smoking Loon, Blackstone, Kendall-Jackson), and lots of reds to choose from.\\n\\nThey have been open since 1938 and a lot of the people who eat here look like they have been coming here since then.

How often do you get such a multigenerational dining experience?\\n\\nService is good and they have NO attitude whatsoever. Due to the lack of snob factor, you will start to question whether you are actually in Cambridge.\\n\\nThe one thing that was odd was, I came here one night when a friend of mine, an amateur jazz singer, was performing. She was singing with a guy playing piano, but you had to be standing right next to the piano to be able to hear them.

I called over a manager and he understood where I was coming from and said he would make us a new entree when we were ready. He explained that dish takes 4 minutes to cook and the server should have noted to the cook that we had an appetizer. Service from the manager was great, our waitress was a bit clueless.

It's a burger and fry joint along with shakes and it took us nearly 2:45 to get our food,  eat and leave. The only reason it was only 2 hours and 45 minutes was because my wife got sick of waiting for our bill and went up to the takeout counter and asked for one and I just left cash and we walked out. We go our shakes to go and it had been 25 minutes after we recieved them that she went to do that. We did not actually grab the waiter but we did motion to him and looked at him several times and made eye contact letting him know we needed something and we were just ignored. The food was not great but was good and I would normally go again but that will be the last time I ever go to this place.

We had the hotel concierge make the reservation as we couldn't get hold of a live person. \\nWe arrived and went to the small room in the back lead by a very uninterested hostess. Our waiter came over, didn't introduce himself, and told us he had bad news about not having any mussels. Well, okay...I asked his name. ALEX.  He looks to be about 21 and also serves as your bartender. I watched him measure out all my liquor by the jigger. Not very experienced but he did make a good drink. It went downhill from here on out. I ordered the corn chowder soup. It was good but nothing spectacular. Like home cooking not a bad thing but it was just \\"good\\". My partner ordered the wedge salad. It, too was just okay. Bacon was little burned. \\nWe ordered the 10 ounce Filet Mignon that we were gonna split because we don't eat a lot and we had ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts and the mac and cheese and didn't need anything else. We ordered our steak medium and it came out medium rare. I don't care for it cooked that way and my partner won't eat any steak that is soft and red on the inside. Our waiter didn't wait for us to cut into the meat and so wasn't aware it was medium rare. When he finally came back around we asked for it to be redone. He took away and it took 15 minutes for it to reappear. The chef was nice enough at that point to give us to small filets but they were still undercooked. We had been eating the Brussels sprouts and the mac and cheese while we waited for the steak and we were pretty full. The waiter stated the chef was sorry and offered dessert on the house. I thanked Alex and hoped we could actually eat dessert. Speaking about the mac and cheese--it is served in a cast iron skillet and was very good. It has caramelized irons and was a little sweet but good. The Brussels sprouts were nicely roasted but could have used some pancetta. \\nI have worked in many restaurants and owned two; my staff would have just taken everything back and refired all of it. We didn't want to complain anymore and decided to just try and eat it. We just couldn't. It was still barely warm and medium rare. By this point, the waiter, who had barely said 10 words to us, became silent. Nice...it was 9pm and we were still the only ones in the place. The other thing that bothered me was that other staff came into this secluded back room and used their cell phones to text. Not cool. We just asked for the check. Alex handed it to us walked away. My partner wrote on note on the back of the check that simply told Alex to smile. She wasn't ugly at all. Alex informed us that steak had been taken off the bill. I told him that we would be happy to pay for it. He just presented the check and we paid for our drinks and sides. He never said another word. As we got up to leave he lead us out a side door. He didn't even say good night. I walked into the the JM CURLY door and asked to speak to a manager. I spoke with Sonny. He was nice and tried to explain that Alex was just a serious and detailed oriented person. Not true. He barely paid any attention to detail and couldn't summon up a smile at all. Sonny was nice and he listened to what I had to say and stated he would be speaking to Alex. He apologized for the steak being served twice undercooked. I told him that although we are from Dallas we would not return on our next visit and would not recommend Bogies to anyone else."},{"name":"Gigi's Cafe","address":"6320 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is my go to waffle place in PDX!

The ume dipping sauce it comes with is truly, truly amazing. \\n\\nI was not disappointed with any aspect of the dinner. The waitress was very friendly, and it was nice to speak Japanese again. The service was a little slow, but it didn't matter because you just know everyone's working their hardest. The joint is family owned, there's only one server, and with each table ordering 5-10+ dishes, things are going to come out a little slowly, but it's worth the wait. \\n\\nAlso, there is no sign for the place. Their name is written inconspicuously on their door. You may have a hard time finding it, but don't give up just because you have trouble. . . .get here. And it's open til midnight! This has easily become one of my favorite places to eat in the Portland area. \\n\\nAnd the macha-milk candy that comes with the check is also delicious.

Ordered several pieces (tuna, yellowtail, escolar, salmon) and two rolls (rock n roll & Elvis). The fish quality was excellent and the pieces were cut a little larger than most places. The rolls were boring and both had romaine lettuce in them which was not mentioned on the menu. There wasn't any interesting rolls on the lunch menu. Traditional decor and somewhat dirty bathrooms.

No one in our party was impressed with their food and we tried several brunch items, including the frittata, pancakes, waffles, eggs-over-easy and fruit cups.  The fruit was good, but I wouldn't go anywhere for just a good fruit cup.  Although they advertise \\"farm fresh eggs\\" on their menu, most of the egg dishes were too overdone to really be able to taste the eggs. The frittata was quite dry and lacked flavor, despite the colorful array of ingredients. The pancetta on top reminded me more of salami on a pizza rather than what should have been delicate wafers of pancetta.  The pancakes had too dense a consistency to be good.  The waffles were very ordinary.  The one dish that was a success amongst our group was the polenta benedict.\\n\\nThere is a lot to like about the atmosphere: a cute historic bungalow house repurposed into an inviting restaurant interior, a multi-level outdoor deck with plenty of seating and a giant oak tree, and a cute interior space with (at least the appearance of) reclaimed wood paneling, upholstered chairs and a fabulous bar area.  The bar is a standout with a copper wrap around bar, and a vintage \\"mad men\\" era looking ceiling and light ensemble.  The bar is so inviting, I will definitely be back to try out a cocktail.

It's very rare I stray from my Patron Silver but I just had a feeling I wouldn't be disappointed and I definitely wasn't. The tacos were yum too but the pork was slightly dry for me. I fixed that with the salsa they brought me for my chips and the black beans that came with my entree.

At first glance, I realized that the prices had gone up a bit, but no matter, I knew Ikea would only increase prices to what they needed to be to keep up with the rising cost of quality materials. And boy was I right! From the pungent aroma of fish floating in hot trays of murky water, to the fresh-sometime-last-week french fries, they did not disappoint. The meatballs were clearly pressed from the finest chipboard and the dessert must have been locally sourced polyurethane. At first I was a little put off that all the ketchup and mayo dispensers were dry, but soon realized that this was a subtle hint from the chef that their gourmet meals are prepared exactly to taste and don't need any additional sauces.

What was great was the view of the city. Being so high up in Vancouver downtown is really something to behold. With that said, that is where my positivity for the Roof ends. Just to note, you really aren't on the roof of the building as the name implies, but on the top floor (or an area with some sort of open air), which is disappointing.\\n\\nAs with most of my reviews, I try to go to a venue at least twice before I write a review in case a location was having an unusually busy, quiet, and/or everything in between night. However, on both occasions I went to the Roof, we received poor and unwelcoming service (first in a group of 4 and second a group of 2). Wearing more formal attire or coming with relatives did absolutely nothing to improve the service we received. \\n\\nBoth times, the Roof was not very busy, so it was easy to get a table to enjoy the view. However, the amount of time to be served in both cases was almost enough for us to walk out (had it not been for the view. Did I mention it has a great view?). The server did acknowledge us as we sat down, but it took more than 10+ min before the server came over to first greet us. Once our drink orders were taken, it took more than 15 min to get our drinks as the bartender seemed to routinely be too busy talking with elderly patrons at the bar.\\n\\nAlong with incredibly long wait times, also comes with the incredibly high prices that can sometimes be anticipated with a Fairmont hotel. Sometimes, the complexity of the cocktail or speciality of the ingredients can allow one to justify the cost. However, at the Roof, this is this not the case.  At the Fairmont Vancouver Airport, you can get an absolutely fantastic Fairmont honey vodka cocktail made with grey goose that is to the brim of the glass for $13. While at the Roof, you can get a simple Mai Tai made with Bacardi that fills 75% of the glass (this includes the ice) for $12.  To me this a complete disconnect and really isn't acceptable when so many other bars downtown can make a better drink for less. To add to things, the Roof charges $9.50 for a domestic 16 oz draft beer! To me that is absolute madness to pay for a beer in Vancouver, when craft beer is now so widely found and for much less.\\n\\nTo add to our disappointment, the food is ok at best. At least one person in our parties  tried the club sandwich ($21) and the burger ($20), and for both items, the quality was not even close to what I should have been for the cost having poor bread, and tasteless bacon (I don't even know how you can make bacon not tasty, but they found a way).\\n\\nWith poor service, an uninviting scene (but definitely a great view), overpriced drinks and only ok food, the Roof is a location I would not go to again and would not recommend.

This is for 7/16/17 - Been a few times and it has always impressed but Saturday night was phenomenal and thought it was worth noting for a few reasons:\\n1. Service - These guys are still trying to get better every time and our server (Carla) was a sign of how impressive their staff is getting.  E&R is the type of place where you need someone to walk you through the options and make real suggestions.  Carla not only understands the ingredients but explains the preparation like you would hear from the chef.\\n2. Kevin - The owner and head chef is much more present in the dinning room.  His knowledge and explanation of what is in season and how they are preparing it goes a long way towards having a great experience.  On this night he was walking around with green walnuts and explaining how they get used this time of year.\\n3. Food Carts - usually these are \\"good\\" but not stars - other than the Johnny Cakes, which are a can't miss.  However, they have improved the offerings and make for a cool addition if you want to add a few things to the table as you go.  \\n4. Food for the season - the menu changes often so this is a place you could go a few times a year and not see the same thing.  Really appreciated the food they served taking advantage of what you can get this time of year in Texas.\\n**Overall - if you have not been in a while, you should head back because the food is amazing this time of year and the service keeps getting better.

The salmon was cooked at what's known as \\"perfect\\" but I prefer it a little more well done. Not a ding just a side note. The potatoes/hash in the salmon dish had awesome flavor! I wanted more.

Because they aren't like gross processed McDonalds fries that last forever, Our fries can go soft after sitting under the heating lamp for a while. We don't cook them in bulk because then they'd all be mushy! the wait really isn't all that bad either, it only takes 4 minutes to cook from the time they are put in the fryer.\\n\\nreally, fresh food from this place is the best.\\ntime to cook fresh food:\\nFried Chicken: 15-20mins\\nStrips: 8-10 mins\\nFrench Fries: 4-6 mins\\nChicken Fried Steak (always cooked fresh to order) 6-8 Minutes\\nRibs (highly suggested fresh) 8-10 mins\\nFried Chicken Sandwich 5-6 mins\\n\\nBrisket:\\nThis is delicious! as long as you aren't the type to be grossed out by a little fat. and really not for the person trying to watch their figure. This one you would probably want to be cut fresh too. The way we serve this is by the #. (a 1/4# one serving) You can ask for a couple of different options:\\n\\nMarbled (moist and tender, more likely to have fat)\\nLean (less fat but can still be there, also not as greasy)\\nExtra Lean(where they really try and get as much fat off as possible. But the meat can still be tender! don't get this confused with marbled!)\\nNo Ends (this cuts off the harder black pieces at the ends of each slice.--- the smokier parts)\\n--lean choices are more likely to be dry..... you can also ask for a combination of lean and marbled\\n- for the lean choices you can also ask for the meat to be sliced thin!)\\n\\nAnd just as a note as to why fresh food is the best thing to ask for here: It's not because its Bill Miller's, It's because its Bill Miller's in Austin. We don't get nearly as busy here as the stores in San Antonio, so we try to wait to cook our fresh food until peak hours. don't get too frustrated though if you come near closing time and have to wait 15 minutes for a family order of chicken, You're probably the 4th car in a row to order it. people like to do that at night.....\\n\\nTHE SERVICE:\\nwe are super nice!! :D The manager's are so cool and will gladly sit down with you and have a nice chat! they'll even offer you free dessert if you had to wait too long! The employees themselves can be a bit fussy at times but I think that's just how some of them are. But usually they're only fussy with each other and more than willing to help out a customer in anyway possible to make their meal even more enjoyable. The trick is to smile back. \\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur prices are much cheaper than other BBQ places you will find, especially in Austin, The environment is very casual, but with way better than average customer service of fast food chains. you order and get your food from the front, but we bus your tables-- fusion of fast food and family sit down restaurant. Fresh food is usually the best asking for fries. only takes 5mins.\\nIt's not The best restaurant, but It gives a bang for your buck, and you're eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach here.\\n\\nPersonal favorites:\\n-- #1 Poorboy with side order and a drink (Sweet Tea is to Die for!)\\n\\nThe Quick Menu:\\nMeats: Brisket, Ham, Turkey, Sausage, Ribs, Chop (a brisket and bbq sauce mix that plays the part of sloppy joe)\\nSides: Pinto Beans, Green beans, Hash browns, Coleslaw, potato salad, spanish rice, mashed potatoes, french fries.\\n\\nall super delish."},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"You walk in the door and are immediately presented with a bountiful counter of incredible baked goods.

One of us ordered the tortilla soup and I think that was the worst part of the meal. It tasted more like warmed up tomato sauce even though the presentation was great.

Ryan, our server, excelled in keeping the water glasses filled, offering suggestions without being intrusive and was very attentive.  Three of us ordered the cheesesteak roll, which I liked but it wasn't over the top, and one ordered the chef's suggestion which was a pepper soup...wished I had ordered it as she raved over it.   I ordered the short ribs which disappointed me as expected it to have the meat falling off the bones but instead it looked unrecognizable...meat with a dollop of mashed potatoes and something else on top.  One of my friends ordered the salmon and the other two had the fillet mignon which they loved.  Ryan asked if I was happy with my short ribs which I had barely touched and upon hearing my complaint gave me the opportunity to order something else.  I ordered the fillet mignon and although it was extremely tender, I found it to be very salty, which is why I took off one star.  \\n\\nAlthough not on the Magical Dining menu, Ryan gave me my favorite dessert, the Creme Brulee. and the others ordered the Cheesecake with strawberry topping, and we were all happy with our choice.

You will most always see some seafood on the menu and  they frequently use vegetables to accent a main dish instead of rice and beans (they use them too just not as a staple for lack of creativity). Everything on the menu is fresh and the Tamales almost always sell out.

There's nothing but dive bars on River Road where you live\\" She was all \\"Au contraire mon fr√®re! Milwaukie is coming up in the world. Well, downtown Milwaukie\\". Wanting that glass of wine, I took her up on the offer and pulled off McLaughlin and onto Main. There, before my eyes was a wine bar! Wine 30, to be exact. True to it's name, the bartender stated that we had plenty of time for wine before they closed because \\"We close at wine 30, not 10 pm, like the sign suggests\\". That gave us time to chill and check the place out. \\nMy first impression was of the decor, which I liked enough to take photos of. Especially the chandelier in the front room and the skeleton sitting atop an armoire, guzzling a bottle of wine. There's a beautiful display of colorful wine bottles on a shelf on the way to the restroom. Not so great is the spooky Ouija board coffee table across from the bathroom. I'm not about that so I raced to and from the restroom, in lightening speed, to get back to the lovely Malbec that the bartender had recommended. Malbec that was so good we stuck around for a 2nd. Why not? Numerous other customers around the bar were still ordering glasses of wine and panini sandwiches (which looked delicious) so we still had time. \\nI really liked that the owner, Lenny, who was there, just chilling with the customers.\\nI also really liked the bartender. Not only did he recommend a great wine but took photos of us out front, for us, between helping customers. \\nIt's really nice to see that the area I grew up is coming up in the world and Wine 30 should be given credit for helping add culture to the downtown Milwaukie area."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"9840 NE Cascades Pkwy","city":"PORTLAND","stars":"2","text":"I will give this place a 3 and only because they were quite slow and we were like 3 of four people in there.. other than that.. they are very clean and very update..

With three different levels, each offerings its own vibe, there's something to please everybody's choice of ambiance.

All of the trees and natural lighting enhance the already chill feeling. Plus, it's just really pretty. \\n\\nScene set...now onto other items of interest: the food and libations. Olive & June takes an interesting twist on Italian fare and they are in the farm to table/seasonal game. So, the menu does change fairly often. O&J is a nice place to enjoy an enjoyable, not break the bank dinner - almost all entr√©es are under $20 (except steak, etc. = a few bucks more); however HAPPY HOUR is one of the best deals in town. Monday through Friday from 5-6:30 they offer half off beers, cocktails, and shared plates! Talk about some $$$ savings...and the eats and drinks are quite legit to boot.    \\n\\nSome of my memorable drink and eat highlights include the Love BJo cocktail, very refreshing and bright with fresh sage; the Roasted Eggplant Crustini (if they have it; it's was a \\"special\\"), the Triangoli is so so good (I doubt you would go wrong with any of the pasta dishes here), the Pork Meatballs are fluffy and flavorful, the Seafood Frito Misto is a blend of great flavors and textures consisted of an assortment of lightly fried seafood bits (seafood included in the dish changes depending on availability and season), and the Polenta with a soft cooked Farm Egg on top...drool...yeah, try the polenta. ;) \\n\\nOverall: [Again] One of the best HAPPY HOURS around for drinks AND food. Cheers! \\n\\nNote: O&J has a vast wine list, a decent cocktail menu, but is seriously lacking in beer choices.

I also ordered a side of fried cauliflower.  My salad was pretty good, everything tasted fresh. It was a light yet fulfilling meal.

I also think that they did not give enough sauce.  My favorite part of the meal was the fried cauliflower. It was oily but tasted so yummy. I also had a bite of my coworker's tots and thought that it was delicious.

It's all mixed together and served in a foil lined bamboo basket which allow the vinaigrette to drain and not make the chicken soggy.

The prices here you can't get anywhere else with the same quality. I was shocked when I saw check because I thought it was way more than it was listed. The bad thing is that this place is not close enough, but the 35-45 minute drive is worth it. I got the Salmon, mackerel, Japanese scallop, uni, and negi tuna nigiris. I can't wait to come back to satisfy my cravings."},{"name":"Texas Roadhouse","address":"102 Boston Providence Hwy","city":"Walpole","stars":"3","text":"I have eaten here before and really enjoyed it, however, my mother and I got take out today and it was far from impressive. I got the 6 oz USDA sirloin, green beans, and salad. The steak was ok at best, kind of chewy, the green beans were overloaded with salt, and the salad was MIA. They didn't even give me one. My mom got the prime rib and it was good, but stone cold. She got the mashed potatoes and asked for loaded and received just plain mashed potatoes. She also got the green beans and they were overloaded with salt as well. We got a take out container of rolls and they were cold and did  not come with butter. Overall, if eating here, I would definitely recommend eating here and not getting takeout. The service was also poor. There were 4 girls standing at the front desk and I had to wait in line for 1 girl to get my takeout for 20 minutes because she was on the phone. The 3 other girls were just standing there giggling."},{"name":"Yakuza","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Nothing disappointed.

We had a 7 p.m. event in midtown that didn't include food (I know, right?), so turned down Crescent in hopes of finding a parking and dining spot. We found both, and were glad to find bar seats at Lure for a quick bite. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, poke and trout dip. The shrimp were perfectly fine, though pricey, but the poke and the trout dip were just okay. We'd been to Hawaii a few months ago, and ate a looooot of poke, but Lure's version wasn't that great. Somewhat under seasoned, with huge puffed chips instead of the traditional rice or thin chips. The puffy chips really overwhelmed the poke, and were difficult to eat. The trout dip was okay, a tiny mason jar, but somewhat unforgettable. For the price, I wouldn't go back."},{"name":"Shoestring Cafe","address":"4611 No 6 Road, Suite 180","city":"Richmond","stars":"4.5","text":"New ish restaurant, tucked away on no 6 road.

You get to choose any appy, Main and dessert they have on the menu. We had four people so I got to try quite a few items. \\n\\nSeafood chowder: thick and creamy and they didn't skimp on the seafood. Comes with a piece of garlic toast \\n\\nCrab and avocado salad: not bad but not my favourite, didn't find it too memorable \\n\\nCalamari: delicious. Comes on a bed of greens so you feel slightly less guilty about eat all that deep fried calamari \\n\\nSeafood linguine: plate was stuffed so full! The shrimps tasted fresh and they gave quite a few on there \\n\\nPrime rib: served with some vegetables, mashed potatoes and mashed yam. I couldn't even finish half of this after the appies \\n\\nCheese cake : I didn't like this too much, not enough flavour to it so it d be better if it came some sort of sauce or flavour \\n\\nVanilla orange flan: really enjoyed this, not too sweet and lots of flavours"},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for cocktails and apps.

Everything else was a miss.  \\n\\nThey lost the order for our entrees it seems.  Not sure if this was the server's fault or the kitchen's.  But it took half an hour to get our plates of carbonara and ravioli.  Inexcusable.  The food was not worth the wait.  The other dishes we ordered that night were good, but not wortth going back for.  Minus one star.\\n\\nThe waiter volunteered to have dessert be on the house to make up for the miss with our entrees.  Nice gesture.  But then he arrived at the table with his selection of dessert for us instead of giving us menus and letting us select our own dessert.  I would rather have paid and ordered what I wanted.  I believe the kitchen was closing so he just had them make something before they closed.  That is not the way to handle that situation.  He also brought us decaf coffee instead of the decaf cappuccinos we ordered saying that they were out of decaf espresso and that the coffee would be on the house.  Since I didn't order it,nor did I want it, it should be on the house.  \\n\\nEveryone makes a mistake now and then.  It is how you handle your mistakes that set you apart.  Olive and June screwed up our meal and then screwed up how they handled it. Minus a star.\\n\\nWe ate inside.

We loved the attentiveness and unpretentiousness of the wait staff.\\n\\nNow onto the food... where do I start? Everything was overpriced, which wouldn't be a problem if the food is good. The problem is that it wasn't. The dishes were over-seasoned and so salty that we were chugging water during the second half of the meal. The White Sonora Agnolotti pasta was nothing to write home about; the pork belly was greasy instead of clear delicious fat layers; the lamb leg was pure salt.

A very strong 5 stars here. \\n\\nThe environment here is sophisticated yet traditional, complete with a \\"Mercado\\" (Market) that makes fresh guacamole (3 kinds!), ceviche and more.

I ordered the Skinny margarita that had plenty of balanced flavor...and was strong. Good $10 spent in my opinion. \\n\\nFree chips and salsa came, along with a type of queso dip I've never had before. It reminded me of the Kobe white sauce a bit, but it was spicy. I liked it and found it to be so unique.\\n\\nWe ordered the guac, which was made fresh, yet it did lack salt. We added some salt, some jalape√±o and tore up the cilantro branches that came with it and it turned out excellent. \\n\\nFor entree, I was so undecided! I eventually landed on one of the appetizers: Mini Chipotle steak tacos. OMG...spicy and amazing! I wasn't expecting that level of spice, but it was right on. I like spicy, but not fire breathing dragon spicy. I'd recommend the restaurant place some spicy indicators on their menu to help those who aren't familiar. \\n\\nI'm absolutely coming back to this new gem...and excited to see more restaurants in the area raise the bar like Saint A√±ejo and Bavaro's have done.
