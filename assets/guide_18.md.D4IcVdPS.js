This is a family-run restaurant that has been run out of a food truck for a while, and they just opened their first physical location in the past few months. The building is tiny-- there are only 5 tables inside (but there's a larger outdoor patio area, which is fine when the weather permits), but the food and atmosphere makes the cramped restaurant more than worth it! I am not typically a fan of Mexican food, while my husband could eat Mexican for every meal, and both of us LOVED our meals. So much so, that we went back three days in a row to try different items! Each menu item is a la carte, and the chips and salsa are a serious MUST. Each batch is freshly made and has chunks of fresh avocado-- it could easily be made into a gazpacho and I would eat it by the gallon! The chips are also fresh and delicious. The steak quesataco is out of this world-- we ordered it \\"traditional Mexican\\" as recommended by the owners, which comes on freshly-made masa, with cheese, steak, onions, and cilantro. We have also tried to seasoned pork, barbacoa, and shredded chicken quesatacos, and they were also delicious. The burritos are generously portioned and come with rice, beans, choice of meat, plus vegetables, and my husband loved it. I got the huarache with steak, which is basically just a huge taco, and that was also excellent. Our friends got quesadillas and thoroughly enjoyed theirs, as well. I HIGHLY recommend trying this place out-- just be mindful of the hours, since they move to the taco truck for the evening and close pretty early on the weekends for that reason.

And the onions were squeezed into one side, I finally gave up having them together but separated the onions with meat. The bottom piece of the bun was very soggy to be absolute honest. I guess my disappointment was because it was just so salty and we spent too much money on this.

Unfortunately, after two drinks neither of us had a good buzz, so I'm going to venture to say they're not all that strong.  Oh well.  For our appetizer we had the shrimp wrapped in prosciutto.  The shrimp was a tad overdone, but it still tasted amazing.  For entrees we shared the pork loin and the ravioli.  I preferred the ravioli, he totally dug the pork (I thought the size and shape of the meat made it hard to cut without feeling a bit butch).  As we were finishing up our server/host announced to the entire patio that the sunset was beautiful and we should all admire it.  I'm sure it was, too bad I was distracted by my empty glass, which he took no notice of.  We kindof got the feeling all of the servers were a bit stoned.

And I mean literally. \\n\\nTucked behind Parkside, in their assumed \\"Back Space\\" lies this months old pizza restaurant . In the same family of Parkside and new Olive and June (also AMAZING), The Backspace is headed by hot Austin chef Shawn Cirkiel- and this guy knows what hes doing. \\n\\nThe Backspace is a tiny restaurant- I think they have 5 or 6 tables max, so I would recommend calling and trying to make reservations or youll be shit out of luck. The size of the place just makes it seem more legit, and I like that. \\n\\nThe Backspace makes their pizzas in a serious serious brick oven, apparently brought over in its entirety from Italy- and they cook everything in there! Since the kitchen, bar, and tables are all in the same room, you can see the food being made- which some people dont like, but I only get more excited about my own food by watching the masters at their work. Ive eaten here twice- most recently was last night for restaurant week (obviously it was so good to compel me to write a review immediately) where they had the best menu out of all the restaurant week contenders. Like my first time dining here, i INSISTED that we order not only 1 but 2 orders of the lamb and pork meatballs. Literally, the BEST meatballs ive ever had...but dont let my Italian grandfather hear that! The meat is juicy and flavorful, but the sauce that it cooks in in the brick oven makes the appetizer dish. I want to take home a bottle of that sauce and put in on everything. I would rather eat this sauce than ice cream to get over a bad day...and im serious. The other appetizers look awesome, but I just cant allow myself to stray from these heavenly meatballs now that ive been there eaten that. \\n\\nThe pizzas are in a league of their own. Each pie is about 10 ish inches which is a little small for what they charge- about $14-18 a pie. The dough- being just flour water and some yeast- is some of the best dough ive had. I would eat it by itself. The sauce is delicious and you can just tell the meats are high quality. We split the margherita pizza and the pepperoni/salami pizzas and had 3 slices each between 4 people. My only complaint is that they could have put more cheese on the pizzas or offer some fresh parmesan to sprinkle on top.  \\n\\nCut to third course and we got both the hazelnut chocolate budino\\nand the ricotta cheesecake, with strawberry and basil. Both were served in a clip top bell jar, which I thought was adorable. The chocolate dessert was incredible. It was like a mix between chocolate mousse and pudding and topped with chocolate covered toffee. I wanted to eat about 12 more. SO GOOD. The other dessert was good too, but Im just a little biased toward anything made of chocolate. \\n\\nThe meal came with a bottle of prosecco and a bottle of chianti...can you say DEAL?!?!

Our waiter was very attentive to our needs and did his job well.\\n\\nThe price: To me, it was overpriced for basic soul food at lunch time (they had no lunch menu, so you had to buy dinner portions). My fried chicken wing dinner with two sides was like $13 plus tax. My sister's smothered chicken breast and rice with two sides was about $12.\\n\\nThe food: The fried chicken was fine, but it was nothing to write home about; I personally think it needed a little more seasoning. i didn't eat all of my chicken. I liked, not loved, the fried okra. The macaroni was just okay; the texture was a bit spongy and weird.  The breads they served as an appetizer were fine. I also decided to try the peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was very messy and okay tasting; I didn't eat it all. It didn't knock my socks off.

It's typically well cooked and flavored, and ample enough so that you (generally) don't feel hungry after eating.\\n\\nThe a la carte pancakes I ordered were delicious (though I would've liked more maple syrup), and I enjoyed the crunch and seasoning of the halibut's coating on the fish and chips. The lobster salad added on top of arugula salad option was good, not \\"out of this world\\" - though perhaps it would've been better as a lobster roll. I could've also had it on the kale salad, but I think they should offer a mixed green option for adding lobster salad or salmon - it's a pricy add-on that ruins both the entree salad and the lobster salad when paired together, so I picked the lobster out to eat separately. It would've been better just to ask them to scoop it onto a separate plate, as I ended up leaving half of the order behind - thankful that the (pricy) cup of clam chowder made up for the ruined dish. My travel companion had the burger and enjoyed it as well.\\n\\nService is a little slow, though, and once your meal is delivered that's pretty much it (except for when they wait to pick up your paid bill). The host/hostess leave much to be desired - this is my consistent impression over each of the visits.  \\n\\nAs far as the experience today, I'm writing this with my (now cold) Starbucks coffee while sitting in a side lounge directly across from the \\"please wait to be seated sign\\". I had asked to be seated for Saturday brunch in the back room here, near the buffet but I was told there was no room there and directed to the main area - that is in the open center of the hotel lobby, which was nice at first but after 3 visits just feels like you're sitting in a fish bowl. Also, since I've had a good chunk of free time on my hands waiting here hoping to be remembered, I noticed that foot traffic is surprisingly slow given how packed many places are on a holiday weekend Saturday brunch. \\n\\nConsidering each meal here has cost around $75 for two people (not including the 20% tip I've always added), and the service is a little slow, I'd recommend patience and a large group for this restaurant. They have been very prompt and responsive to them (maybe because of a bigger tip potential?). As a hotel guest, you'd think they'd be more attentive because of the potential for recurring business, but I don't think they use that customer service model here.\\n\\nMy advice is - if you're easily annoyed at being forgotten, then I'd definitely say avoid this place and explore a local place. What you'll lose in convenience you'll gain in value and service."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So I wish I could give 4.5 stars.

We are ordinary people and can't afford that. I ordered zippy cucumber soup, Louisiana jumbo shrimp, and bread service. They charge $3 for the bread! Please. I've had better bread many places. The cuke soup was good but too zippy for me. The shrimp were three, with a sauce that featured okra. Three shrimp, not that jumbo, for $15. Not that good. It did seem that for $15 they could give you five or six shrimp. It's like showing off to charge that for three.\\n\\nThe kicker was the birthday cake. My friend had called them and asked whether we could bring a cake. They said, Well, we don't like you to do that, but okay. After the candle thing they took the cake back into the kitchen and cut it and served each of us on individual plates. This is classy, okay. But charging us $2 each for that service was not okay.

She was great with my allergy and made recommendations about which dishes would be good.  The chef made my dish special to make sure it did not have any wheat or gluten at all.  My husband had Singapore noodles, which was a very generous portion.  The waitress even told us what part of his dish had wheat, just in case I wanted to try it.  We were there on a Sunday afternoon and things filled up quick!  It seems a bit of a two-man show, with one cook and one server.  We didn't get everything we asked for (an order of turnip cakes and some chili oil) and service slowed down quite a bit as the place filled up, but we were perfectly content so it didn't really matter in the end.

I also ordered a bowl of Clam Chowder (Going to Boston and not order a chowdah is like going to Disneyland and not going on any of the rides) and the Seafood Newburg. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our food to come out, we were served rather large pieces of corn bread.  The corn bread wasn't bad, but was slightly dry.  \\n\\nThe Calamari came out piping hot and was very very tasty. The batter wasn't too much and didn't overpower the pieces of squid.   My chowdah was very good and had large pieces of clams and potatoes.  \\n\\nThe seafood newburg is made of large pieces of scallops, shrimp and lobster, in a puff pastry shell covered in a sherry sauce, accompanied by a rice pilaf.  The main dish itself was very tasty.  The pieces of scallop and lobster were very large.  The puff pastry shell was delicate, even though it was topped with a heavy cream sauce.  My only complaint would be that the rice pilaf was rather tasteless.  \\n\\nMy experience was good overall, but I doubt I will return.

I bought two of the deals - $30 for 4 specially created drinks made from Tito's vodka. It's a great cause and I was excited to see that TWO Urban Licks was participating in the fundraiser. The fine print on the deal stated that we could get the drinks between 12:30-5:00. So, when we pulled into the \\"valet parking only\\" entrance (at 3:10) and stepped out of our car, we were told in a very rude tone that the restaurant \\"closed at 2:30\\". I said, \\"But, we have something that we are supposed to be able to use between 12:30 and 5:00.\\" The very young man looked at us and said in a condescending tone, \\"oh ... you have a \\"thing\\"? that says we're open?\\" Luckily, another valet stepped forward and asked if we were there for the Tito's vodka promotion and I said, \\"Yes, it's for the fundraiser.\\" He said, \\"I think they are staying open for that.\\"  We parked our car, without the assistance of the valet service and went inside. We were met with the same, \\"I have no idea what you're talking about.\\", at the hostess station. After asking them to please check with someone else about the promotion/fundraiser, we were told we could not sit at a table, there would be no ordering of food, but if we wanted to use the Scout Mob deal we could sit at the bar and have the drinks. We weren't the only ones who had this problem. We watched several others go through the same run-around and end up unhappily sitting at the small bar. Our Sunday was planned to be a lovely day, having a nice meal, a few cocktails and helping a worthwhile cause. As it turned out, we were treated as if our presence was a HUGE nuisance. I think if a restaurant is participating in any fundraiser, they should be ALL IN. In this case, the restaurant blew it ... big time.

I was schooled tonight as to what that is and it was DELICIOUS!\\n\\nIt's a pizza made in a square car parts pan as I understand it. There is a lot more going on here than a standard pizza. The crust is a little thicker than a \\"normal\\" pizza, it's light and airy on the inside and crispy on the bottom and sides. The REALLY cool thing is they use multiple types of cheese, some of which they put around the edge of the dough before baking. The end result is this delicious caramelized edge on two sides of each piece. You'll probably have to try it to understand, but it really makes the crust and style stand out when you taste it. Tonight I had the Meatball, which was excellent! Slices of meatball laid out on top, with green peppers under the cheese. Oh and one more thing... the sauce is on the top, in what I could best describe as a stripe or strip. (this is part of what makes it Detroit style) \\n\\nFinally, the two guys who own the Via 313 couldn't be nicer cats and their help as well. I sat on the patio at the Violet Crown Social Club and they brought me my pizza when it was ready. Great beer selection, Awesome Pizza and great people.

We tried finding a middle eastern place in a much livelier place like downtown, or thornton park, or dr. Phillips but none of those places had good reviews. So we thought of just coming here for a delicious meal. \\n\\nFirstly - service was AWFUL. We wanted to sit outdoors so we sat in the patio. We told the waitress and she gave us menus and we sat ourselves down outside. \\n\\nWe waited for her to come back but she didn't for at least 15 minutes. We waited and waited. Once she came back we finally ordered and then had to wait another 40 minutes. \\n\\nWe both ordered shish kabob and it was horrible. It was over cooked on the outside and raw on the inside. Not medium done - improperly done! We love Shish kabob and know when it's good and this place definitely did not do it right. Some chunks were so bad it was impossible to chew! \\n\\nWould definitely not recommend this place to anyone. Waste of money and time for bad food. \\n\\nSo in summary I give this place a 1 star because: \\n\\n1. Poor service. Wait time at least 15 mins before you can even order ESP if you're eating in the patio. \\n2. Not cooked right.

There's a huge dining room, huge bar and a smaller what appears to be a fish bar. We visited for an anniversary and were glad that we chose this restaurant. The menu is a perfect size offering several choices but not offering too much as to confuse or dilute the theme of the place.  You're in a seafood restaurant. \\nWe found a table that worked out well for us (my fiancee, didn't like the first table....not sure why) and were introduced to our server. The food was excellent, we ordered oysters to start, as we tend to do wherever they are offered and were very impressed with the quality. As I recall 2 different types were on offer when we visited. One from the east coast and another from the west. It was great to really sample the difference and compare the texture &  flavor of each. At this point it's worth noting that it was not cheap. Oysters are sold individually.  This seems like robbery to those of us accustomed to the gulf where you can likely order them by the weight or half-dozen at very least.  The premium cost was fortunately born out by the quality and selection of the oysters.\\nSadly I don't recall the entree selections of the rest of the tabel but I ordered swordfish which was fantastic. Everyone at the table was really impressed with their entree selections and the atmosphere of the place.\\n\\nSadly I can't go into more detail as this was a few months ago BUT writing this review has helped me decide to visit again very soon.

We had a group of 7 walk in on a Sat night and the place wasn't very busy so we got a table right away. The music was incredibly loud for a restaurant at 9:00 p.m. This would have been totally fine if it was later at night but people were in there to eat dinner not party like it was a club. \\n\\nOur waitress was incredibly rude right off the bat. Super short and seemed like she hated her job. She brought out our appetizer with no plates and no silverware. After waiting almost 30 minutes for the rest of our food we asked another waitress how much longer because our waitress wasn't around at all. She said she would check and walked over to the food window where a gentleman was standing eating fries off a plate in the window (I'm assuming this is the manager). While they were talking our waitress finally comes by and tell us that our food is taking longer because there was another table of 7 in front of us. Seems logical but this place is HUGE - if the kitchen can't accommodate two 7 tops at once I would hate to be here when more tables are full. \\n\\nThe second waitress then stops by and tells us that there was an emergency and someone had to leave and that's why our food wasn't out yet. While this is understandable, we've now been given two different explanations of why our food wasn't out. \\n\\nThe food finally comes out but at different times. Half the table was almost done by the time everyone had their food. Also, we still didn't have silverware and were never checked on by our waitress. We had to walk up to the bar to ask for silverware. \\n\\nI'm sure the manager was aware of all this because our waitress continuously stood in the food window talking to him while we were there. He never stopped by our table and never checked to see if everything was ok. \\n\\nIt was a very unfortunate experience because the atmosphere (if the music wasn't blaring) is pretty cool.

Boyfriend had a melon soup starter, swordfish dish, and mango dessert plate. \\n\\nThe salad and pasta were awesome. I loved that the pasta had a great actual lemony zing to it - not the sad lemon flavor taste from those concentrate bottles from safeway. The salad was also great - great mix of arugula and kale. I had never actually had fresh kale before, and this place definitely was a great first try of it. The wine was alright. The creme br√ªl√©e, unfortunately, was very disappointing. The top sugars were not torched all the way and for some reason, it was cold. Not the normal room temperature to warm custard I had before, but coooold. \\n\\nBoyfriend's melon starter dish was just... weird. It was sweet-ish and creamy. It barely tasted like melon too. Fortunately his swordfish was pretty good. I usually don't like swordfish because it had a specific weird taste to it I don't like but this dish didn't have that.

I like hamburgers that have a unique \\nand tasty flavor that shouts the establishment's name. This is the tradition of Vancouver. Dozens of Hamburger stands and after school soda fountains used to line the streets. Many stores in downtown Vancouver had lunch counters including 'Woolworth's\\" and \\"Hadleys. \\"Steakburger is one of the few family owned and operated that have managed to hang on and compete with the national cheap generic taste franchises. Talk about price???? Has anybody been to Burgerville Lately??? \\n\\nBasically, A Steakburger is a lettuce slawburger with steaksauce. Beef and steaksauce...Ergo...Steakburger.\\n\\nThe first Steakburger I remember eating was free to me. My brother and I were attending a movie at the old Broadway Theater (now gone like everything else) and it was packed. We had to wait through one showing to get in to see the next. There was a very pregnant lady standing in the isle watching the movie. Nobody got up to offer her a chair so my brother did. The lady reached into her handbag and gave him her card or a coupon for a free hamburger at Steakburger (I think she was the first generation owner). My brother gave me the coupon, as he knew how much I liked hamburgers. I have enjoyed a Steakburger now and again, since then. Mainly, I support Steakburger because they have had the courage to stay true to their product which is certainly unique, not the generic stuff of the franchises that I can make at home.  Each time I've been there, my burger has been prepared fresh and tasty. That's almost 50 years that I've been eating there. Bravo to the family and  customers for keeping it going, and, in the family.\\n\\nBurgers aren't all about size of the patty or about how much left overs can be piled on top until the top bun falls off . It's the unique flavor that evokes an indelible memory about the place, good or bad. One should bite into a burger and \\"blindfolded\\" know where they are. Obviously, if everybody's burgers taste different, not everybody is going to like all burgers. That's the cool thing about it. People get to decide their favorites. Chain burgers give us no choice, they're are all the same...lettuce, tomato, onion and ketchup. I can do that at home...how boring.

It was loud, and the DJ playing golden oldies was a little bit too loud and jangle-ey for my frayed hungover nerves.  \\nHowever, once we got over the atmosphere and settled into our food, it was definitely a good meal.  The bacon bloody mary was very good and a pretty unique thing.

But I do care about customers!"},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"After one of those situations where several friends and I took way longer to decide upon a place to eat than really should have been necessary, we ended up agreeing to all meet at Grindhouse.  I'd been to this place before on one of those Scoutmob promotions, but didn't remember to drop a review on this place then, so it's time to rectify that.\\n\\nThis particular Grindhouse's location is close to the corner of Piedmont and Cheshire Bridge, which means it can get pretty tricky in terms of traffic at the wrong parts of the day, but it's location is pretty pretty centralized in the city in the terms that just about anyone can access it via several different routes.  The parking situation here is really scant, and probably problematic at peak times, and it doesn't help that it's a one-way parking lot, leading to a lot of people heading southbound on Piedmont entering through the wrong way and leading to some car-tetris going on.\\n\\nBut anyway, once you manage to park and enter, the place is fairly spacious and comfortable.  The interior could probably seat more than they offer, but I can appreciate a place that doesn't feel the need to cram tables in to have more dining space, at the expense of being able to overhear your neighbors' conversations or inadvertently photobomb their Instagramming of their burgers.  But I prefer the patio, which in cooler weather they're good to drop the plastic sheets and have a very effective space heater.\\n\\nI appreciate that they make you order at the counter, and pay up front, because for people like me who tend to meet up with friends or eat in numbers, this completely avoids the uncomfortable situation of people who try to skimp on the tip, or avoid paying outright, and leaves everyone who wants to indulge to be responsible for their own tabs.\\n\\nAs for the food, I admire the spin they put on hamburgers, considering they're hamburgers, to which it's debatable on just how creative they can be pushed in varying directions.  Because I'm a glutton, I tend to order doubles, with a side of onion rings (and of course, the Diet Coke which makes it completely healthy).  The burgers come wrapped in paper to shield your hands, temporarily from the savory juices, and the meat is flavorful.  Even with the myriad of toppings and cheese they offer, the meat doesn't easily get overpowered, which says something, considering how many places that does happen at.\\n\\nOnions rings, fries, or pickles, are always fried on the slight side of crispy, which is definitely my favorite.\\n\\nWho could also forget the booze?  Grindhouse is an awesome place to get your drink on; their taps aren't as numerous as like a Taco Mac, but they typically have decent stuff on tap, that rotates periodically.  Or if you're cheap, the PBR/High Life comes available in trashy(good) buckets for somewhere around 5/12.  But their main events are definitely the boozy shakes; now my first impression was that the shakes would simply overpower and mute out the alcohol, but after the first drag, I kind of wince and exhale like it was the first time I'd ever had a sip of beer in my life.\\n\\nAnyway, the staff is nice, the food is good, and the men's room for some reason has a swanky black toilet, which makes me feel like I'm peeing in a Las Vegas casino or something.  The prices are adequate, and I always leave satisfied.  I think this place is also a great place to simply hang out and just have some fries and beers, if not necessarily in the mood for an entire meal too.\\n\\nIt's an easy addition into the rotation of \\"reliably decent\\" restaurants when the inevitable where should we eat inquiry arises."},{"name":"Tikki Masala","address":"3706 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"This place is great!

We ordered fried chicken and a few sides, which were macaroni and cheese, potato cakes, creamed corn, and cheese grits. The fried chicken was light and not greasy like a lot of fried chicken. It was delicious and the portions were generous. The macaroni & cheese is out of this world delicious!. It had a nice firm consistency instead of being runny like so many others prepare it. The other sides were just ok, not what I would consider outstanding but were good. We finished with peach cobbler and pecan pie. Both were delicious. Again, I would not say they were outstanding but they were good. Our waitress was very polite and charming & did a great job for us. Overall, we had a great time and I recommended this restaurant to other friends I ran into from our convention.

They wanted to check out SoCo and get some food. Someone mentioned pizza so we decided to try this place. Honestly I wasn't that impressed. The pizza was decent, but not the best I've ever had, and it was way pricey.\\nHere's what I didn't like:\\n1)  The host was really nice, but he told me it would be at least a 20 min wait. Whenever a host(ess) says \\"at least\\", I take whatever time they say and double it. I'm pretty sure \\"at least\\" is code for \\"double it\\" in these situations. Keep in mind that this was on a Wednesday night AFTER 9PM and school was still on break.\\n2) They don't have Coors light. OK, this isn't a con, I just wanted to tell the story. My friend ordered it and the stunned waitress replied that she didn't think they had that but we could get a pitcher of Lonestar. I was pretty mortified that my friend would even order Coors light in public and hastily told the waitress that Lonestar would be perfect. Sidenote - she brought us four glasses. There were five of us but someone had gone to the bathroom. It was no big deal but it did create problems later. Read on.\\n3) You can only order food in designated areas of the patio. To be fair, the host in no way indicated that we would be able to order food on the patio - he merely suggested we could wait for our table out there. My friends somehow got it into their heads though that we could order and eat out there. Probably because half of the patio is designated for food tables. Yeah, it's confusing.\\n4) I had to wait FOREVER to use the restroom. Again, this isn't entirely the restaurant's fault, but would it kill you to have more than one stall? Seriously, this lady was changing her wriggling toddler's diaper and I thought I was going to pee myself.\\n7) When we finally got seated (about 40 mins after we arrived), the server was super-awkward about asking for my ID. First she offered the table water, looking pointedly at me. At that point I asked for another pitcher and a glass for the dude who hadn't gotten a drink yet. She looked at my husband for approval (probably because he hadn't shaved that day so he looked like he was our dad). She agreed to bring us another pitcher and started to walk away, but then finally asked to see my ID very apologetically. Maybe I was just being sensitive but it rubbed me the wrong way.\\n8) The food took a while. Not that I don't enjoy talking with my friends, but we had already waited 40 mins and it was late in the evening. We were hungry!\\n9) The pizza was decent, but not the best I've ever had. The crust was nothing to scream about, not that I scream often. They don't have jalapenos as a topping (WTF?! This is Texas!), and I didn't try the sausage pizza because it looked disgusting. Please note that I generally like sausage pizza, so I'm not arbitrarily complaining about something I already dislike.\\n10) It was expensive! I think the tab ended up being like $20 each, and we ordered 2 large pizzas and 2 pitchers of LONE STAR, PEOPLE. I remember my friend commenting on how each topping was outrageously expensive, which is why we went for two one-toppings. \\nAll-in-all, it seems like you're paying for the experience of being in \\"Downtown Austin\\" where keeping it weird means waiting forever for mediocre food."},{"name":"Cadillac Cafe","address":"1801 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We stopped at Cadillac Cafe just after Noon on a Saturday.

We ordered the voodoo and pothole with much anticipation. While the donuts were obviously fresh, the raspberry jelly filling in the voodoo donut was awkwardly gelatinous and cloyingly sweet. I really couldn't taste anything else. The cream filling in the pothole donut had the jiggle and texture of generic middle school lunch vanilla pudding.

No problem, this puts us just about 10 minutes behind schedule for our plans, not a big deal. Grabbed some beers at the bar and waited.

One, the Yelp page says that this place is good for groups. Not true. Maybe good for one decent sized group, and the rest of the place can accommodate 2-4 people per table. I wouldn't call this place good for groups at all.\\n\\nThe second thing is that, I understand you don't take reservations, but don't thank me for calling in advance and tell me that your staff will accommodate a group when you obviously you didn't prepare your staff for the group at all. \\n\\nThe food looked good while we were there, and I may go back with just my wife as I'm sure they can accommodate a two-top, especially in the summer as they have some sidewalk seating.

My wife and I are avid dancers and have been to D'Amelio's 8 times or so since dinner last August.  We haven't been back to the restaurant side, however dancing at the bar side.\\n\\nFirst off, the performers we go to see are terrific..Smokey Joe, DJ Stevie Ray and Dennis Taylor.  Although the dance floor is on the small side, people start boogying like its 1975.  Friday night we celebrated Dennis Taylor's 21st b'day at midnight; what a great night.  Last night we danced to Smokey Joe and the Henchmen, then partied into the we hours. The owner, Joe, wanted the band to play Sweet Caroline and then it morphed into a Karaoke night.  The owner, bartenders and Jen, one of the best waitresses around, were dancing and joining in with the party.  \\n\\nI usually have fried calamari, caesar salad and last night my wife had the muscles which made for a great after party if you catch my drift.  My wife loves the various martinis and I love the coke and ginger ale as I'm allergic to alcohol.....I break out in hand cuffs:)\\n\\nSo if you haven't been, please go.

Boston.  \\n\\nThe Good:  The Romantic ambiance is terrific and the waitstaff affable and attentive.  The Bread is terrific.\\n\\nThe Bad:  We both ordered the Penne Cantante for $25.95 which claimed to include a lobster tail.  The lobster was the size of a crayfish or crawdad and was very difficult to extricate from its shell and was small. The pasta, which claimed to be homemade was not.  I buy the same at Market Basket.  There were four small clams and four scallops.  We asked the waitress if the salads were good sized to split and she assured us they were but when it arrived it would have been considered small for one person.  Then to top it off they have valet parking which is right across the street and pay again.\\n\\nThe waitress never asked how our meals were which would have allowed me to voice my opinion, but I passed knowing I'd be writing this on Yelp.\\n\\nTo think we paid $90 for this, although my wife had a glass of wine, is excessive.

It happened to be the \\"winter park tree lighting\\" night. I guess that falls under the category of holidays or special events rendering the coupon void?? We asked to speak with the owner who simply stated it was posted out front (which we did not see as it was not marked very well). He made no attempt to make it right or to address our disappointment other than saying we can come back with the coupon. He also mentioned there are \\"40 rules\\" that are not mentioned on those little coupons.\\n\\nMoral of the story: don't eat here unless you want to pay for overpriced italian food AND do not buy those stupid coupon books the boy next door sells that includes an enticing coupon for Pannullo's!"},{"name":"Sun Tong Luck Asian Cuisine","address":"2500 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The lady that runs the place might be the sweetest lady on the planet but that still doesn''t get around the plastic dishware, CHEAP plastic utensils, bags of mustard, etc.  And the restaurant itself is nothing to look at.

The reviews on here were so good, even though it is a bit of a drive I thought I would take the chance.\\n\\nThe good: Dumplings were tasty ((I assume they were pork, more on that later)\\nThe Shangai Supreme chow mein was very tasty, lots and lots of ginger and the beef, shrimp and chicken were tasty and tender. The mixed vegatables were very good with lots of baby bok choy, yum, and lots of other good fresh veggies, snow pea pods, water chestnuts, brocoli, mushrooms, bamboo shoots and carrots.\\nThe duck breast of the \\"Crispy Duck\\" was very well cooked and tender.\\nBBQ pork ribs wee tender and tasty, a different preperation from what is typically served in most Chinese cuisine dryer and with a different spice pallete.\\n\\nThe bad: I ordered \\"Steamed pork buns\\", instead got some kind of dumpling, thus assuming they were pork. Tasty dumplings, but not what I ordered.\\nI called in the order and then drove over to pick it up. It was a twenty minute drive and there was one table seated eating dinner. I still had to wait another fifteen minutes for the food. On top of which, the only person I saw working there was nowhere to be seen for a good five minutes and then said she would be right with me, which she wasn't. I know we orderd the duck but still that seems like a long time for what we got.\\nWhile the meats in the Shanghai Supreme chow mein were tasty there wasn't much of them, and the shrimp and pork were nearly nonexistent.\\nThe rest of the duck was overcooked and dry, and the skin was anything but crispy.\\nMaybe this is nit picking, but I really prefer chinese take out food being served in the traditional paper boxes. The styrofoam boxes are so much less environmentaly friendly, plus it doesn't breath so any items that might have been somewhat crispy are doomed to being steamed to a mush. No alternate packaging could have helped the duck, it just wasn't cooked right to begin with.\\nLastly, this minor feast was rather expensive for what it was. The total tab for two entrees, the four pork ribs, dumplings and veggies was around 55 bucks.\\n\\nTo top it all off, Argo won for best picture, really?! Against Lincoln and Life of Pi? Oh, and what in the world happened to Mellisa McCarthy? It is as if a band of rabid weasels did her hair and picked out her dress. Who ever her stylist is needs to be tarred and feathered.

But it also took so long (3 lobster roles and one burger) when we were the first table in at 11:30? \\n\\nDrinks were mediocre- Bloody Mary was a miss and lacked any mind blowing experience. \\n\\nSo to sum it up, I'll go back if my seafood friends want, but there are only 2 options on the menu for me and I like ambience! Give me ambience and I'll be cool with a mediocre burger and an average Bloody Mary. Fix it all and this place could rock"},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Quintessentially Austin.

Hopefully they didn't serve this to too many others that day. I wasn't offered something else...and I was still charged for it too. Normally McMeniman's restaurants are great about that. As this was all that I was having, it was disappointing.  I still have hard time rationalizing a glass of wine here too. They are very overpriced for the quality of wine, and I have a real problem with it every time I order. Much better restaurants don't charge as much as they do for a glass. For a bowl of soup and glass of wine it was close to $20.   Other than the restaurant this Kennedy school itself is worth visiting.

We planned on dessert but just hate being rushed. Once we ordered dessert, AGAIN with the 'gentle reminder' about the $24/min. Anyways, we had the Warm Chocolate cake which tasted like something out of a package.  I chose to take a spinach salad home which was mediocre at best.  This place will survive no matter what they serve, but I am at least curious about dinner. The service is way too pushy, though. We heard you...$24/per person minimum.

On the first floor to the left. \\n\\nThere is a small patio area for seating al fresco in the \\"outdoor\\" area as well as inside the stall along two banquets or at a counter against the kitchen for solo diners. \\n\\nThe menu hails from Sapporo, a city on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. In contrast to many styles of ramen, Ganko Ittetsu uses a wok method for preparing bowls of noodles where all of the ingredients are combined prior to serving. \\n\\nThe stock used at Ganko Ittetsu is a combination of chicken, pork and vegetable which is ultimately combined with dashi and the sauce flavor of each type of ramen: miso, shoyu or shio. \\n\\nGanko Ittetsu Ramen has a simple menu that lists one appetizer: pickled sesame cucumbers ($5), three soups: Shoyu ($11), Tan Tan ($13), Miso ($13) and an add-on section ($1-$5). Because the menu is compact, it is easy to decide what to order: the menu is anything but overwhelming.\\n\\nIntricate descriptions accompany each broth that bathes the custom noodles made in a factory in Japan. The Tan Tan is a sesame based spicy broth where 4-5oz of springy, al dente noodles with plenty of bounce are immersed. These noodles are crisp in the tooth and hold the thick, creamy broth with little effort. Dunk them back down with your chopsticks and a torrent of broth will coat these springy gems. \\n\\nAn extra order of noodles (Kaedma, $2) makes this bowl of ramen perfect. \\n\\nThe broth is rich and thick. A light brown opaque liquid speckled with fiery chili oil creates a visually stunning bowl of noodles. The toppings: corn, ground pork, scallions, wakame - float on the edges of the nutty broth. Sesame seeds are sprinkled in the middle of the bowl. \\n\\nThis bowl of noodles is unique and wonderful. Multiple textures and ingredients hit at any particular moment. The noodles hold the broth. The broth brings flavor. The vegetables bring crunch. \\n\\nCredit cards accepted on a tablet style device makes paying and tipping incredibly convenient and quick at the table all in one spot once the check is requested.\\n\\nService is polite and the food arrives quickly. This is a well thought out concept which is executed flawlessly. Joining the ranks of the many recent ramen entrants in the Boston market, Ganko Ittetsu Ramen is the best or very nearly so."},{"name":"Milestones Restaurants","address":"1145 Robson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here a few times.

Best pizza we have had in North Austin.\\n\\n--Wait was not long at peak time on a Thursday night. 10 minutes tops - we had just enough time to order a drink in the cute and comfy bar before being seated.\\n\\n-Nice choice of appetizers. The fried mozzarella had a great herby breading and hot gooey cheese inside. Good and satisfying. Stuffed mushrooms did not look appetizing, but were very good also. Bruschetta was a little disappointing, the bread was not quite toasted crisp enough to support the heaping amount of toppings, but overall good.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-Atmosphere wasn't very inviting. The dining room was pretty full and several tables were turned over while we ate. We did not get the feel that the waitstaff was super-slammed, but we didn't feel extremely comfortable waiting for the food. \\n\\n-Service was rather slow and not very friendly. We were never checked on in between dishes arriving, which was between 10-15 for app and then for entrees. Wait staff friendliness would not keep me from coming back as they were not at all \\"rude\\". Just would have appreciated feeling a little more welcome while we were there.\\n\\n- Pasta was so-so. Due to this being called pizza cafe, I would usually not dock a star for this, but they have a rather extensive menu other than pizza, so it has to be done. We would opt for other establishments for just pasta in the future - but loved the pizza. \\n\\nIf I were to play Gordon Ramsay ala Kitchen Nightmares here, I would say this place suffers from the \\"too-big of a menu for what they are good at\\" situation. They should stick to pizza and update the decor a little bit. I wish I could say the dark and drab interior gave an authentic italian feel, but it gave me a slightly dirty and i'm ready to go home feel.\\n\\nAnyway, all I wanted was some great pizza and I did get that. I believe in the future, I would go out of my way to pick up pizza here to take home, but I do not expect to dine here or take others for a meal unless some things are changed."},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite cafes to go to! Delicious chai and good lunch assortment compared to starbucks or most bakeries. They now just recently came out with a few new items (the tartines) that can be made vegan which is really nice. Cute decor and perfect for studying. Sometimes food takes a little bit more time to come out but it's not a huge problem. Wish they had more vegan options as so far it's just the salads and a few tartines. All the sandwiches have meat so they're not even vegetarian but the menu seems to be changing so hopefully in the future there will be more :)"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't go here unless you're a tourist looking to get your mouth cut on sugary cereal.

The only thing I have to tell you is that this is the kind of place with $90 per glass luxury cocktails, chef's tasting menu and a pre fixe menu with wine pairings -- yet they serve cold, slightly stale bread with rock hard butter.

This is the 2nd time in 2 weeks we come here. Last time was t too great so we were hoping this time it would be better run. We were wrong.Arrived at about 730 PM and was told it would be a 20 minute wait. When I walked to the bathroom I noticed about half the restaurant was empty yet they had about 5 families waiting for tables which did not make much sense to me. I am not sure if this restaurant has a staffing issue and that might be the reason why. As soon as you walk in the hostess almost force you to sit at the bar as all the tables are open seating by the bar. After about 30 mins of waiting we asked to clean a table by the bar and decided to sit there. \\n\\nThe waiter came and took our order. 3 of us did the unlimited appetizers and the waiter was nice enough to take our next round of appetizers so we can get them back to back. One of the main reasons I come to Friday's is for their Jack Daniels sauce. When I asked for boneless wings with jack Daniels I was told there was no jack Daniels sauce. How does a Friday's not have jack Daniels sauce??? Someone in our party ordered the steak with vegetables since they are doing the Atkins diet. \\n\\nPlates started to come out and we all got our appetizers plus  the next rounds and the person in our party with the steak did not get hers yet. When asked about it the waiter stated \\" some things cook faster than others.\\" Asked for a manager and that still took about 15 mins and when he came he continently had the steak. Taste on the steak was not that great. Appetizers were good as usual. I am a big fan of Friday's and usually go to the one at Waterford but for some reason this Friday's is poorly run with the empty tables, long wait times, and long time for food to be ready.

Try the Buffalo Wild Wings next door instead."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I think there is MUCH better southern food to be had for their wait to be as long as it usually is.

For their first visit there yesterday, my four year old niece, who can be a bit picky, ate all of her food and my sister-in-law raved about her chicken biscuit with eggs and side of corn grits. My husband went expecting to order the fried fish and shrimp entree. He'd been suggesting that we go there several times within the past few weeks just so he could order it. When we arrived the waitress said they'd extended their brunch time so he was unable to order from the dinner menu. He ended up deciding to go with the turkey burger. When it arrived he said that he wasn't expecting it to be a triple patty burger. Before cutting it he decided to taste the meat, as he was anticipating flavor comparable to everything else he's had and loved from Folk Art before. I wish you could've seen the face he made. He asked his sister to taste it to see if he was tasting something weird (I'm vegetarian), and she immediately cringed also. Both of them said that THE MEAT TASTED LIKE IT HAD EXPIRED! It was an inexplicable flavor that they couldn't describe any other way besides the meat no longer being fresh. He sent it back and was so disgusted that he didn't order anything else.

This restaurant knows how to treat food as art. \\n\\nIt was here that I enjoyed the best steak tartare I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned and just the right texture and consistency. As well, I really love the truffled poutine. The essence of the truffle oil warms my soul as each bite is better than the last. Just the right proportions of all that makes a perfect poutine. \\n\\nAs far as mussels go, they're not the best I've had and there are so many great choices on the menu that I'll likely opt for something different moving forward. However, you can can order them with either a saffron broth or white wine and garlic. Both options are equally good. Also, do note that the mussels again come with fries which might be just a bit much upon having devoured poutine already. \\n\\nThe duck two ways is great.

These chefs clearly have pride in their workplace that you see as they're cleaning up and preparing for the next day. \\n\\nLastly, and not at all relevant to your enjoyment of food, but perhaps moreso to the appreciation of the kind of people who run this place (and let's face it, that matters), I've seen the chefs prepare a special plate for the dishwasher at the night's end with the same level of attention and care they do for the customers.

It's not heavy, nor is it too light.  I personally think that the broth is well made, but would be interesting to see a more stronger broth.  Great taste of oils on top.  \\n\\nThe tare (concentrated flavor base) was great.  The unique characteristic of Sapporo ramen is its utilization of a wok for its high temperature to cook the tare and vegetables.   This gives a caramelized, deeper aroma, however, I'm not experienced enough to make this distinction and cannot vouch for its significance yet. \\n\\nThe toppings, soy sauce, cha-shu, egg, bean sprouts, menma, sesame seeds, scallions were contributed a good and balanced dynamic to the ramen.  No flavor overshadows the other, and because all toppings are separated both by taste and texture, they are easily distinguished.  This what I like most about ramen toppings. \\n\\nThe ramen noodles, to the best of my knowledge, are imported from Japan through Nishiyama Seimen.  These are most likely frozen, and perhaps for that reason, there was something about the noodles--they are elastic, and are designed to retain the flavor of the soup, yet, they seemed a little too soft. I might like the curly noodles to give just a slight more \\"give\\" or \\"chewiness\\" in the texture.

Yes, from time to time, as the waitress explains in 7 sentences how exactly they dress wilted greens, once the plate is infront of you and morsels in your mouth...the dish is effortless.\\n\\nLenoir is small. Probably the size of a studio apartment in New York City. Reservations are a necessity but volume and ambiance remain both quiet and calm. The decor is \\"anthropologie chic\\"...darling, as my mother would put it. And service is attentive and well paced. We went to Lenoir witha group of 5 and sampled nearly the entire menu (it's prix fixe with a broad array of choices nightly). Highlights included the \\"goat spam\\", an elevated (despite the name) permutation of a gyro, fig flatbread, and rice paper ravioli. \\n\\nLenoir costs a pretty penny but is definitely worth it; a wonderful date night or special occasion spot but most importantly, a place that defines Yelp five-stardom."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious and great service and location. \\n\\nThe foul play is my current favorite.

I don't know how the servers can stand it. \\n\\n\\nWe stopped in on a Saturday night.  I ordered my usual. The infamous salmon chips and the Gouda grits with scallops. The salmon chips taste the same each time that I've ordered them. Pure deliciousness.  My entree on the other hand I must say I was a tad bit disappointed with it.. When it finally arrived I wasn't as impressed with the plating as usual. This time it appeared to be sloppy/rushed. Perhaps because it was so crowded in the place but nonetheless my grits were cold. Not a solid cold but a less than lukewarm type of cold. You get the gist. The flavors were still present and I was starving so it did get eaten but I so wanted to really enjoy it with a full smile. Now I'm sure I could have sent it back and waited for another but my hunger pangs would not allow it. I did not want to have t sit and wait another 20- 30 mins for my food again. \\n\\nOne dull experience will not keep me away from this place. I look forward to going back and actually venturing into trying something different on the menu like the calamari."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I LOVE this place!

Wish I could say the same about the service here, which was some of the worst I've ever experienced.\\n\\nBrunch was good.  I had brisket and eggs.  Although it was good, the brisket was very hard to cut with my knife, and should've just fallen apart with tenderness - It was good though.  Great charred fat on the outside, and the flavor was good.  My poached eggs were runny, as I love them to be, but undercooked, as half the whites were not set, as seemed to be the theme for the other three at my table as well.  My potatoes were yummy, and overall the food was good.  \\nThe service, however, was beyond pitiful!  One thing after another, the whole time!  No silverware - had to ask 3 times to different people, food came out in about one minute, which is perhaps why none of our eggs had set whites.  Oh wait, food came out one dish at a time, while the rest of us waited.  Easily 5 minutes from first served to the fourth person at our table.  And then, no jam, no toast, no butter, no salt/pepper, no drinks.  Had to ask for each item more than once.  Shall I continue?  No, I think you get the point.  It's a shame - the chef/manager needs to do better with their wait staff. \\nNow to top it all off, I noted on my credit card statement that the amount I signed and had a receipt for, was not the amount billed.  As a matter of fact, it's more than double what it should be! I did call them; they were very apologetic, and was told I'd hear back yesterday.

Not much of a choice really, salad, tots, fries or potato salad. The salad was uninspiring. Iceberg lettuce and Greek dressing. That's it. No other veggies. Thankfully the gyro was so good. Beef, tomatoes, onions and tzatziki, plus feta. I was looking for the pepperoncinis but I forgot to ask for them. It was still good, large and filling.

I would give the restaurant a 4.5 rating if I could from the Yelp app, due to the very noisy atmosphere.

The idea of converting a school is original, and a good gimmick.  But beyond the gimmick, I was disappointed.  \\n\\nThe restaurant staff needs much more training.  The food is average to poor, which is to be expected from a gimmick restaurant (stick to staples like burgers and fries so you won't be dissapointed).  What was most unfortunate was the waitress we were assigned.  Working with a group of 10 does require effort, but she gave off the attitude that she clearly didn't want to be there.  We had to constantly remind her to bring us things we ordered and we had to always flag her down as she never once checked in on us.\\n\\nYou know the kind of staff that purposely avoids eye contact so that they don't have to help you... and try to always look needlessly busy... that's her.  What is she doing with that touch screen computer that takes that long?\\n\\nWhen I go to a restaurant with a large group I expect to spend my night laughing and frolicking with my friends.  \\"Is everything okay?  Would you like another drink?  Is there anything you need?\\" are things I expect to hear from time to time.  Instead, we all had to spend the night trying to catch the waitresses eye so that we could get the drinks we ordered 45 minutes ago.\\n\\nTo top things off, the food will be served cold.  Clam chowder is not so good when it is cold.  The excuse we were given is that they wait until all the food is ready before they serve it.  Perhaps they need to revisit this policy... it sucks.  Serve hot food hot.  Who cares if you manage to deliver 10 cold plates at once?\\n\\nIf you wish to experience this place, pick a date and time where the place is not busy and expect to spend a long time here.

It's located in the back of this office building/warehouse parking lot.  \\n\\nValet is complimentary - but you have to do it. Self parking is not an option. While this sounds like a perk, it was honestly an inconvenience.  It would've been more efficient for us to just park ourselves and walk up.  We had to sit there and wait as the valets ran around trying to help the LINE OF PEOPLE waiting for their cars, as well as the new ones pulling up.  \\n\\nWe had a reservation, so we waited only about 5 min to be seated.  The decor and vibe of the place is amazing - it's huge and you can smell the smokehouse immediately upon entry.  \\n\\nOur server was kind and attentive, and went over everything with us. We shared the empanada (DELICIOUS) and the salmon chips to start. I recommend both - so yummy. \\n\\nFor entrees we had the chicken with Mac& cheese (it was amazing - had a sweet taste and was very moist. I believe it was half a chicken - so you get plenty of leftovers) and the scallops (also very yummy).  \\n\\nNow, back to the valet  this is honestly where I took 2 stars off.  As I mentioned, we are from out of town. We did NOT know there was a mandatory valet we had to use, so we weren't prepared with cash for tip.  I even kept my eye out for an ATM but didn't see one.  We felt very uncomfortable not tipping, but we simply didn't know so we couldn't prepare. So instead we thanked them for their help and got in the car.  As I was putting my purse in the backseat, one of the valet (not Connor, it was a black guy with a close cut) held my door open (aka preventing me from closing it) talking about \\"we take credit cards for tips) - EXCUSE ME? I was in shock. The tone he took was very much TELLING ME to tip. I told him I didn't appreciate the assumption he was making that he deserved a tip, grabbed the door from him, and drove off. \\n\\nWe were both VERY turned off by his comment, it was rude, and I'm not having ANYONE TELL ME what to do.  If they had a sign by the valet that said \\"we accept cash or card for tips\\" that would have been appropriate. Or if I had ASKED if they take card. I did neither, because I was initially very uncomfortable because we didn't have tip money.

The 3 is for the food,  A ok, it didn't live up to the hype for me. Wasn't the best thing I ever ate, it was decent, and for the price I could've gotten better food somewhere else. I'm a huge foodie and this just didn't do it for me.\\n\\nBut Omg where do I begin. Well I'll split this review into my experience,  and then drama with my mom and the chef/restaurant lol. Get ready for an entertaining read...\\n\\nBackstory: I'm in town visiting my parents in Atlanta.  As an elite yelper, I depend on Yelp for everything!  I went on yelp and found Poor Calvin's, and after reading the reviews I HAD to come here. Like I begged my parents, \\"please lets drive 45 min to this place, you won't be disappointed. \\"\\n\\nAtmosphere and Service- It's a small cute restaurant. Some outside and bar seating which is first come first serve. The restaurant is very tiny on the inside from what I could tell. When I walked in I let the host know I made reservations.  Unfortunately my best friend in Atlanta was running late so we couldn't be seated(you must have everyone in your group present). After 45min the host said my guest was taking too long and that I would run into the 7pm reservation so I would only have my table for an hour. I was slightly annoyed about this rule, Tampa restaurants aren't set up this way, but whatever. I decided that I would stay at the bar or go outside.  Plus it was REALLY hot inside, I was sweating so bad, so I figured it couldn't be worst outside.  The service from the host I wasn't feeling, the bartenders were cool, and our server was cool to me...but more about this in the drama section lol. But overall I would give service a C.\\n\\nPrices/value: on the pricier side. Dishes range from 18 to 30 dollars. Apps around 10 dollars, drinks around $10 as well. I felt like the portions were good, but I was not blown away in comparison to the prices. Not at all. I would've been just as satisfied at PF changs.\\n\\nFood- while sitting at the bar after being refused a table lol, my parents ordered the watermelon goat cheese salad which they raved about.  I was happy to see they were so pleased with my restaurant choice. I read the lobster mac and cheese and crispy beef was amazing so I ordered that. Everything was tasty, but nothing blew me away. The mac and cheese had a smokey flavor, very filling, but no obvious pieces of lobster. The crispy beef tasted more traditional,  it was what I thought,  nothing special really, and it could come with more rice. My rice was dry actually. My ftiend ordered the same as me and agreed it was good, but nothing special. My dad loved his lobster fried rice. And my mom ordered the ribeye filet. Lawd...this is when things turn bad. \\n\\nDrama- so my friend did eventually show up around 5:45 and we decided to all sit outside.  Everything was great, everyone was happy, we were laughing telling stories, yay.  Then my mom's ribeye filet came out and it was like the devil had visited us lol. My mom said to the server \\"this isn't a ribeye, I raised cows growing up and this is a sirloin\\". I mean I knew my mom had a farm , but I didn't know my mom was a cow expert and butcher... but ok I was listening. So the server got the chef and the chef explained that it was a filet with the fat trimmed and was indeed a ribeye and not a knockoff lol.   My mom refused the meal and said take it off my bill. So the server got the chef again and the chef refused to take it off the bill. People at this point were watching and my mom was talking to the chef with a knife in her hand. I was getting nervous,  my mom was looking real crazy about this piece of meat. She even asked the chef if they could \\"discuss this\\" somewhere else so she could really talk to her without an audience. I don't know what happened next because I fell really ill from the food and/or heat exhaustion and felt nauseous and dizzy and couldn't cool down so my dad walked me to the car to get AC and to lay down, I thought I was dying lol. \\n\\n My mom came to the car about 20 min later and said the staff at poor calvins called the police because they thought she wasn't going to pay. She was outraged and said what chef has time to cook when they are busy arguing with customers. I was sooo disappointed,  but I felt like I was about to die so I didn't have the energy to be mad. I honestly don't know what was the right thing to do, as a chef, but I could see both sides. Ultimately,as a business owner I would probably always try to please the customer and cut my losses with a piece of meat. \\n\\nConclusion: I've never had an evening like this, I almost died from heat or something, the food wasn't great enough for me to come back without my parents to give it another try, I saw a crazy side to my mom I never want to see again lol, and I honestly never want to see another steak in my life lol."},{"name":"The Righteous Room","address":"2142 Johnson Ferry Rd","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"One of those places that I give 5 stars to for simply being excellent in their niche.

Really? Like, really. Especially when they have a jelly-filled donut in the shape of a Voodoo doll. I mean you can't. You just can't.\\n\\nLet's just say, we ordered a dozen donuts for 5 people and that pink box was empty in a matter of moments. Truthfully speaking, the donuts themselves are pretty average. We didn't try any with cereal or weird things on them because I'd heard from many that the cereal is quite stale. The ones that stood out for me were the Maple Bacon, the traditional glazed, the old fashioned chocolate, and the apple fritter. \\n\\nAlso if you're going to a donut shop that has a donut called \\"Cock N' Balls,\\" I feel like you just have to order it. So obviously we did. And the staff will even write vulgar things in icing on it for you, which is a nice touch, especially if you go there at 6:30 in the morning like we did.\\n\\nYou will wait in line - that's almost guaranteed.

We had already had dinner and drinks so we weren't thrilled at the prospect, but thought it might be nice to give the restaurant and bar there a shot so we sat down and began to order.  Our waiter was very nice and we ordered some cocktails off the menu and a dessert.  The cocktails were horrible for the price.  Overly sweetened and just not mixed very well.  They reminded me of the type of drink that you would get at the Cheesecake factory and not at a pricey nice Boston restaurant.  We ordered their strawberry shortcake dessert as well, yet again something overly sweetened and not done with a lot of thought, another cheesecake factory style dessert.  Definitely not what you would expect at this cailber of a place.\\n\\nWe also were walking around because we had never really been up there before and were told we could walk around.  We wandered near the dining area but hesitated because we weren't sure if we could go in, but my boyfriend's dad wanted to just got through quickly to look out the windows.

The seating was odd (mix of plastic chairs and wooden) but weather was great, lighting was perfect, and sitting on High is always fun! \\n\\nWe started with cocktails and wine. Cocktails were just OK... Wine was good (cab blend).\\n\\nOrdered a Surprise app and the clams. Clams were wonderful!! Highly recommend!! The surprise was disgusting: lamb sweetbread.. We've all had better. Chewey, fatty, yuck.\\n\\nGot a kale Caesar salad and it was served warm which means it was really like serving greens, another disappointment.\\n\\nDinner was the worst. Timpani, two surprises, and the goat. The goat was the most tolerable albeit very fatty again.  The pasta/timpano was served scalding hot and was just overall confusing.  The surprise was a fatty pork chop with fatty chicken liver plus boiled potatoes half mashed up.. Soo unhealthy and lacking in flavor. The look of it was all just brown and white.\\n\\nFor dessert we unfortunately did another surprise and the coconut layer cake. The coconut was good but nothing special.. And the surprise was a grape cake that again was just confusing.\\n\\nNeedless to say none of us finished our entrees and didn't take them home.\\n\\nOur server was very nice.. Again helping for 2 stars.\\n\\n\\nTo finding it all off they charge you for bread service which just feels cheap! \\nI wish I understood was the hype was all about, maybe if you like meats on meats and fatty food that's lacking flavor, come to Alana's."},{"name":"The Fireside","address":"801 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great ambiance, location, and drinks.

I had to eat over a third of my donut before I reached any of the creamy filling and found nothing particularly special in the dough itself. Don't get me wrong, the donut was good, but not spectacular as all the reviews led me to believe. Tang sprinkled donughts? Donuts topped with stale looking fruit loops? Thick, hard looking bacon slapped on maple bars? One bite and off comes the bacon. Why not dice the right bite-size bacon pieces and top the maple bar so we can enjoy bacon with every bite and bake some right into the dough? And nothing looked fresh.

Not having ranch dressing in America is like not having cheese for a cheese burger or like no ketchup for fries. Hench, make sure you pack your ranch dressing in your purse! LOL. This is America people! He almost frowned when we asked. After several back and forth convo we asked if the chef could just bring her a small plate of veggies. We opted for the $38 sea bass and the sushi plate our neighboring dinners ordered. The sushi was beautifully made...taste is about an 8, not much Wasabi soy sauce very salty for my taste. So they bring out our soup in the smallest unique bowl I've ever seen. Not very much. My greatest disappointment came with the sea bass. For starters this is not my first sea bass and I know how it should be cooked. After my first bite I told the waiter it was over cooked. He said he would inform the chef. Then he returns only to tell me that the chef said I was wrong. They sear the sea bass so it just comes that way. I quickly showed him how I could stick my chop stick inside the fish and lift it off the plate like a piece of hamburger and shake it around without one piece falling off. I told him to tell the chef that sea bass is a delicacy and it should flake away easily. Furthermore, sear does not mean overcooked. So he returns only to tell me the chef said kitchen is closed and he can just take it off the tab. I asked if I could get something else. Nope kitchen was closed so I ate my salad and rice. The veggies underneath the sea bass were bland and didn't go well with the dish in my opinion. My friend agreed the size was small. They cut the fish in half and butterfly it to make it appear larger in size but very small for $38. Then about 10mins later the waiter returns and says he should've taken my plate away from me...he forgot!!! Really?...so your kitchen closed, chef tells me I'm wrong without even checking the plate, you offer to take off tab..then take my plate so I can't such as have a vegetable.. .I asked for an alternative it was not like I was trying to get over on the tab....I  did not request for him to remove it. He valunteered. Our last shock of the night was the bill. They charged my first $8 for that small saucer plate of tiny cut veggies for her baby. Just was not a good experience plus still starving after being ther for couple of hours."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Visiting ATL and according to Yelp there is a shuttle in the area but the number I called just rang and rang with no answer.

(And very tiny) I initially came from Louisiana to here as a connection flight and had time to kill so I walked around to look for something good to eat and I saw a lady walk right past me holding a bag with the Popeyes Logo and I was excited because i have a soft spot for chicken. I went to the store and there was a huge rush but a lady came forward me and asked to take my order, I ended up getting a three piece combo with coke and mash potato and a extra order or dirty rice. When i got my food I quickly found a seat and started eating completely forgetting to get my drink since I got a combo meal. I asked the lady if i was supposed to get my drink and she offered to grab it for me even though they were busy. (So sweet) There is a gentleman there working as a bus boy who quickly makes work of the tables and gets you things that he believes you need such as napkins and straws which in my book excels at service! He zoomed right past my table and secretly dropped a napkin with a straw and spork since I didn't grab one prior to sitting down.\\n\\nI personally told the receptionist about how I felt about the chicken and the quality of service and she mentioned me to the manager and the manager personally thanked me for simply passing on kind words, I personally hope they they have a blessed time as this place is simply put, the best I've been to yet.\\n\\nNow to the food, the chicken is simply AMAZING. I haven't eaten chicken cooked that freshly in forever, and I've been eating chicken for a very long time. It was fresh and juicy and when i pulled the skin and the meat apart, I had steam come off of it and straight into my face. (Almost burned my fingers while i was at it too.) The biscuit that this place serves put Popeyes from my state to shame it's so fresh and fluffy that it fell apart as I ate it, which to me is the best kind you can get for your money and it makes sense that they offered a 15 biscuit box if desired. This place is simply a must if you're here on connection or simply just visiting the location and want what true Popeyes chicken tastes like."},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - West 6th","address":"600 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I had the omnivore. \\n\\nPros: tasty pizza!

There's a fair number of items from both the land the sea - filet mignon, racks of lamb, crispy beef, fried fish curry, and a seafood \\"melange\\" on a bed of squid ink pasta.  The restaurant is cozy on the inside and there's a small outdoor patio.  Free parking is next to the restaurant but the lot is small.  You may need to find street parking.  Also, Poor Calvin's will give you a free Uber ride from a Midtown or Downtown (but unfortunately not Georgia Tech) location at dinnertime, excluding days with special events.\\n\\nHighlights: Excellent taste and excellent presentation.  This is what ~$30 dishes should both look and taste like.  The pineapple fried rice is served in a giant pineapple half, and the rack of lamb that I ordered was certainly pictureworthy with little effort of my own.  The Australian lamb rack comes with an assortment of vegetables and mashed potatoes in a Thai curry, served on a banana leaf.  It's recommended to order the lamb cooked medium - the result is a perfect sear on the outside with a soft pink center on the inside.  I loved the blend of the curry with the mashed potatoes.  My friends ordered the seafood melange and the crispy beef.  Portions on all 3 dishes were medium to large.  The crispy beef was definitely a step up from what I've eaten at other restaurants - I really liked the sauce.  Service was attentive.  The atmosphere was very pleasant.\\n\\nCritiques: This is really a small detail, but I thought my vegetable blend could have been tweaked just a little bit.

The meatballs also came with a slice of toasted bread drizzled in olive oil; you could tell the oil was good quality.\\n\\nThe tagiatelle had a spicy, exotic flavor because of the fennel sausage. The actual pasta itself though felt light with a hint of lemon, and was very refreshing for the palate. Although I was taken back by the flavor of fennel in the beginning, it ended up being my favorite dish of the evening. The papparadelle, as mentioned by others, is also quite good, with lots of shredded duck in the sauce (which wasn't standard tomato, adding to the unique flavors available here).

This is a solid place, a hidden gem right smack in the middle of Apartmentville, Wells Branch.\\n\\nHere's what I usually get (and highly recommend):\\n\\n- The chicken. Obviously, this is the highlight - pretty amazing stuff right here. When it first comes out, the meat falls off the bone, you don't even need a knife. The flavors and seasoning are delicious and the lightly crispy skin is to die for.\\n\\n- Yucca fries. A must-have with any meal! Tastes better than fries in my opinion: Not as greasy, tastes lighter, and the crunch is addicting.\\n\\n- Fried plantains. These are seriously addicting...and I don't even like bananas that are altered from its raw state (e.g. banana pudding, smoothies w/bananas, etc). The caramel is not overly sweet and it makes a nice addition to the plate or as a dessert.\\n\\n- Rice. I believe it's basmati rice that they use. It's airy and buttery; not the best I've ever had, but still tasty. If you're a chicken and rice sort of person, this would make a good combo.\\n\\nI introduced Inka Chicken to one of my friends who lives near 38th/I35 and he routinely makes the drive just for this place.

It had everything it should, including the poppy seed bun and the 100% Vienna beef hot dog, and all the right condiments. The big problems; the bun was dry and stale and the hot dog was lukewarm. Everything else about it was great, fresh condiments; onions, neon radish, sport peppers, and tomatoes. But when you come to Franks after reading the reviews you're expecting a world-class hot dog.  The bun should be steamed warm and soft, and of course the hot dog should be HOT.  Not sure, what happened there.  Maybe it sat waiting too long before coming out to the bar. The waffles fries were great.  Hot and tender as you would expect and plentiful.\\n\\nSo the overall experience as far as food was concerned was only about three out of five. Basically the natural soda and waffle fries save today.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the service. The bartenders have to be some of the greatest around.

The building is sandwitched between two other eateries and it makes parking a little crazy at times.  Thankfully I got a great spot with no probelm this fine evening.  I am not sure what I was expecting the space to be but it is really rather small.  Four booths along the one wall, a bar along the other and four tables or so in the middle.  No wonder this place can have a wait.  There are also a few tables outside that look like they would be nice to have a few beers outside.  The place had one open table when we came in and we sat down.  The waitress was very nice and did a good job for the whole time we were there checking on us and keeping our drinks full.  We both ordered the combo poboys.  The old lady had half shrimp and half beef and I had half oyster and half shrimp.  The shrimp are prepackaged and I think the oysters might have been also.  The last poboy I had was down in New Orleans and it was a nightmare of a thing, I think the cook spilled salt on it maybe. This was not a nightmare at all but it was not what my heart recalls as a great poboy either.  I mean the bread was fresh, the lettuce was crisp, it was not over filled but not skimping on the shrimp or oysters but it just came up short to me.

So when we went back to sleep minutes later and didn't wake up till noon, my boyfriend and I decided to come here for \\"breakfast\\" before heading out for a hike in the 100 degree weather. Upon entering Grass Fed, we were greeted by the nicest and most energetic employees. It was a breath of fresh air to see people who seemed to be really enjoying their jobs despite working the weekend! \\n\\nAnywho, I got the classic hot dog with cole slaw with my fried pickles and my boyfriend got the Cali burger and the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich (only available weekends brunch). The classic dog was very small and came with a lot of cole slaw. While it was good, all I could taste was cole slaw and nothing else. My boyfriend said his Cali burger had an overwhelming bitter taste but he couldn't pinpoint which part of the sandwich it was coming from. With his meal, he had also ordered a PB&J milkshake which he said was the perfect consistency and tasted just like a PB&J sandwich! Unfortunately, the staff forget my fried pickles and since we were kind of in a rush, I asked if I just have it to go. Not a problem at all but the staff were super apologetic and repeatedly tried to compensate with me a free beer, lemonade, shake, etc. NOTE: the fried pickles are pickle spears, not pickle chips. I wish I had known that before ordering but that was my fault and not theirs. \\n\\nOverall, very friendly staff with mediocre food.

I had 2 small plates, the cornmeal crusted tofu and the squash Parmesan (one of the evenings specials).  The crust on the tofu was a little thin and it was a little bland, but the mashed black beans beneath were delicious - it had the texture of black bean hummus but tasted better.  The squash Parmesan was not at all what was expected - little fried bits of artichoke on top of a bed of yellow squash strips (that closely resemble linguine) in a roasted tomato sauce.  Delicious.  I could eat it all day.  We finished off with the cheesecake, which was extremely creamy.\\n\\nService was friendly, food was good and the atmosphere was great.

My husband and I enjoyed watching pizza after pizza being assembled and wood fired by the folks in the kitchen. We were mesmerized. We had to wait about an hour after not having a reservation so by the time we got in we were hungry. We LOVED the arancini, the seasonal squash salad and the Ripieno con Salsiccia pizza. The dough was cooked to perfection and was chewy, yeasty and delicious. Our server was incredibly accommodating, allowing me to taste a couple of wines before choosing one - and I love that you can order wine by the half glass! This allowed me to have a few different wines instead of settling on one. I also indulged in the Classic Amaro flight, with which our waitress brought out some yummy cookies as an extra. Maybe I'm just speaking from the Californian perspective but, prices cannot be beat - they are very reasonable for what you get, especially for the alcohol.

I have been to Bouldin Creek on multiple occasions every time I visit Austin, but this year's trip was THE BEST EVER, and aside from the always amazing Veggie Royale, it was the service that really made this visit. \\n\\nMy party of six was served by the most courteous, friendly, communicative and thoughtful server I have ever encountered--hands down. I wish I remembered his name, but the service was beyond memorable. When I asked for an extra side of the mouthwatering chipotle pesto (I could probably eat at Bouldin, ask for a bowl of that pesto, and be completely satisfied with my meal), he said he'd love to bring me another side, then smiled and let me know that it's an extra charge. What server does that?! If they even bother to tell you another dollar is gonna be tacked on to your bill, it's always \\"Sure, but it costs extra\\" in some snarky voice (I know, because I've done it plenty of times as a server myself). Then, as he was clearing our plates, he noticed that I'd been dipping my chips in the pesto and that mine was all gone, but my friend still had quite a bit in his little cup, and asked if I'd like to keep that one to finish dipping my chips with it. So thoughtful! \\n\\nI have never had a bad experience at Bouldin, and I absolutely love the Veggie Royale, but this has solidified the fact that it's one of my favorite veggie restaurants.

The bagels are good, but my lord what is with the people that work there??  First off no one is ever happy to be there, I mean yeah it's a job at a bagel/coffee joint, but if you really hate it so much just quit and go work someplace else.  I'm sure SOMEONE could work there and be happy.  So if it's not the less than stellar attitude towards the customers, the other major complaint is they NEVER EVER have gotten any of our orders 100% correct.  Now take into account this place is close to where I work, so we are in here enough to know it's not an isolated thing.  Ask for mustard, they leave it off.  Ask for no mayo, they put on extra.  We have started just ordering things plain and getting the condiments separately.  Definitely check your order before you leave.

Would highly recommend!"},{"name":"Ms P's Electric Cock","address":"1101 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"As promised, I'm updating my review, and I appreciate the owners contacting me not once but twice to let me know that Ms. P's had relocated to S. Congress. Having read some of the other recent reviews of the place (meaning post-relocation), I'd have to say that they are some of the most completely unfair and inaccurate reviews I can recall seeing on Yelp for quite some time, at least based on my experience.\\n\\nI'll start with the main event, the fried chicken. Best in town. Period. And note that I am a fried chicken *nut*. No, it is not KFC or Popeye's-style \\"extra crispy,\\" but that's entirely besides the point - apparently people who, unlike me, haven't grown up around homemade fried chicken and only know it through fast food don't realize that traditional fried chicken is fried in a simple flour batter and isn't really *meant* to be all that crispy, or even crispy at all. At Ms. P's, the crust is thick and soaked in some sort of spice concoction that's nothing short of magic. Chicken is an easy dish to screw up and a very difficult one to get right, and Ms. P's does the latter in spades. The fact alone that it's brined -- to my knowledge, no one else making fried chicken in Austin goes to that trouble, given how time-consuming the process is -- puts it in rareified company with some of the nations' top chefs. Yes, even Thomas Keller -- owner of the famous French Laundry in Napa Valley -- brines his fried chicken.\\n\\nAs for complaints here about the pieces being too small, my reaction is a flat-out \\"WTF?!?\\" The breasts I received were flat-out huge, and the legs were standard-sized. I was actually surprised they *were* so huge, in fact, given that they use all-natural chicken -- which tends to be smaller than the overplumped crap generally found in supermarket aisles -- but was pleasantly surprised nonetheless. Ditto the complaints about dryness: my order was fresh out of the fryer and about as succulently juicy as fried chicken gets. Ditto again the complaints about \\"overfrying,\\" which I can only assume came from people who don't realize that the proper way to make a thick fried chicken crust is to dredge it in buttermilk, batter it, let it dry, and then dredge & batter it again. (I've seen some places that do it *three* times, even.) Btw I also ordered \\"The Marty,\\" which is basically traditional Mexican street corn (on the cob) with spicy mayo; it was very good but overshadowed by the epically awesome chicken.\\n\\nLocation: a bit of an odd spot on the northern end of the S. Congress strip, about a half-block past Doc's Motorworks. When I first saw they'd relocated to the street I assumed they were in the \\"trailer park\\" across from Vespaio, but I actually prefer this location since parking is considerably easier. Btw their trailer -- an Airstream which, as advertised, has a huge CHICKEN sign in neon -- is easily one of the coolest I've seen in town.\\n\\nAll that said, I'm giving the new-and-vastly-improved Ms. P's four stars for two reasons. First, as others have noted, the prices are high -- which I say even knowing that local free-range chicken and the brining process are a big part of that expense. I agree with others that the \\"hidden\\" menu prices do them no good, even if the owners think (or at least as I suspect they think) potential customers will be driven off by them. I was actually less bothered by paying $15 for an 8-piece chicken bucket than I was paying $3.50 for a half-ear of corn and $4 for fries ... which leads me to the second reason I'm giving them four stars: upon arriving home with my to-go order, the fries were nowhere to be found. I know I could've gone back and gotten them presumably without complaint, but still: I was the only customer there at the time, and how hard is it to get a basic three-component order right the first time?\\n\\nFinally, I've noticed that they took my earlier criticism about their Web site and Yelp page directly to heart -- the Yelp site appears to be updated multiple times weekly, e.g. in the event of a one-time change in hours (such as this past Monday, when they were closed) -- but I still have one complaint: why is there a picture of waffles on the Web site home page when they're not on the menu? (Or are they? Is there some secret weekend brunch menu not promoted either on the Web site or on their physical site?)\\n\\nAnyway, I'll certainly be back, but next time I better get my fries!"},{"name":"De Novo","address":"201 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was a C+ at best.

The food here embodies the essence of its eponymous style of cuisine - hearty, soul- and body-warming French/German pub fare, only accentuated by a well-chosen beer list. And the draft brews are served in their rightful trademark glasses, which should give any true hophead worth their wheat a giant beer boner.\\n\\nThe French onion soup was filled more than halfway with deeply caramelized onions, in a homemade beef broth so rich with collagen I had to apply lip balm to keep my lips from sticking together. Lamb cheeks were decent enough, but the accompanying pommes pur√©e and garden veg (I effing love parsnips!!) outshone the meat, which needed longer braising time.\\n\\nHousemade bratwurst, topped with a giant tangle of fried onions, seemed almost too mild at first but kept the flavor going with a great garlicky aftertaste, and its bed of sauerkraut, white in thankfully true German fashion, couldn't have been better.\\n\\nAnd humble poulet r√¥ti, perhaps the quintessential bistrot entr√©e, was flavorful and moist even in the breast, and went terrifically with its brasserie bed of stewed red cabbage.\\n\\nThe little 35-seater is more intimate than clamorous, and though you maybe initially deterred by the high-ish prices ($10 for onion soup, $20+ for entrees), just have a meal here and you will agree with me and most of the critics below that they're fair considering the city, quality and generous portion size.\\n\\nIf you don't, well, I feel really bad for you."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The Optimist, another Ford Fry checked off the list!

The sauces paired very well and the octopus was meaty and flavorful - not rubbery like it can be if not cooked well.

The only exception to this is the hummus and pita appetizer which featured ample delicious hummus but only one piece of pita, not a great value, especially compared to the comparably priced sandwiches.

When making my order for the Chicken Milanese our server interrupted me and said, \\"are you sure?\\" I said, \\"yes, why what is wrong?\\"  She replied, \\" I know 'my people's' taste, its not spaghetti and it has no flavor.\\" I humored her and asked, \\"so what do you recommend?\\" She said, \\"the pasta divialo\\" I figured since that was another choice Of interest to me I went along. After what seemed like forever our food arrived. The pasta was raw and there was more meat than pasta, the sauce saved the dish. After we were served we seen our server about 2 more times before she disappeared. When she finally appears again she has a baby on her hip and she claims he was her godson and now babysitting. She did not ask if we needed anything else and just came to show the baby to our party.  After another long period of time around 30-40 mins she came to the table to ask if we wanted boxes and the check. \\nAll in all we waited a total of an hour to finalize an experience we refuse to have again.

They proudly plaster their walls with newspaper clippings and magazine articles stating how great the food is at Five Guys.\\n\\nI went through a range of emotions during my experience at Five Guys. First I was confused when I saw their menu, but then I realize that it's just much more simple than a McDonald's menu. Select from one of four types of burgers, select size, and then select toppings. Any of the toppings are free, so no charging and extra $0.50 for freakin fried onions or anything else. This is great. Make your burger however you want at the same price.\\n\\nAh let's get right to it. The burger... is good. Not quite as great as I had hoped, and definitely not quite as great as many other people say. The best description of a burger from Five Guys is that it is hands down, the absolute best homemade hamburger. Think back to the best hamburger you've ever had at family barbecue and go up a few notches, that's what a Five Guys burger is like.\\n\\nThey use never frozen all natural beef, but it's a rough grind so the patty is actually a bit more lumpy or, chunky than you're used to getting. Very much like buying ground beef from the grocery store and making your own patties at home.\\n\\nThey don't seem to add much if any seasoning to the patty and what you end up with is probably one of the most pure examples of a beef flavor from a hamburger you can get from anywhere else. It's actually surprising and refreshing to get that pure beef taste from a burger since most places add their own special seasoning to affect the taste of the meat. (With Mcdonald's being one of the most extreme examples of tampering with meat flavors and adding so many things to the patty that it could be sawdust and it'd still taste like... a McDonald's burger. But that's how they like it there.)\\n\\nBurger size? It's huge. Don't worry, you'll be full.\\n\\nThe fries? I just had the regular fries and while they have a great texture, weight and consistency... the taste is a bit lacking. However, they do give you TONS of fries. First you get a cup full of fries, they place that in your bag, then your burger, then they pour another cupfull of fries over everything. It's awesome. Your paper bag is greasy from the moment they give it to you.\\n\\nAnother surpise? The customer service is awesome. Amazingly awesome. So much that I was struck frozen and I think I literally stared at the guy taking my order because he was so polite and professional. I know, from a burger joint? Amazing.\\n\\nWith a taste and many of the same ingredients you'd find at a backyard barbecue, Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries serves up the hands down absolute best homemade burgers you can find - anywhere."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The wait was worth it, and getting a coffee at the bar made the wait much more bearable.

The food and drinks are always on point, and the service is typically pretty good.  However, on Monday afternoon, my boyfriend and I, who are oyster fanatics, decided to try out their special Monday deal: a martini and three oysters for $6. Okay, looking back on it, if you're getting a drink and oysters for only $6, there HAS to be something \\"fishy\\" about it.  But, we decided to try it out anyway. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got a dirty martini (which he said was just \\"ok\\"), and I got the basil martini, which I thought was great.  We ordered our six oysters.  They took a really long time to come to the table - longer than expected for a \\"dead\\" Monday afternoon just plating some raw oysters...but that wasn't the problem (we had the delicious bread and oil to hold us over).  When we finally got the oysters, the first two were decent - they tasted and smelled pretty fresh.  However, when my boyfriend ate the second oyster, he nearly went green. It smelled absolutely disgusting, and he said it tasted even worse. I have a terrible sense of smell, and even I was disgusted.  It smelled as if it had been sitting in the sun for days.  We couldn't finish the rest, and couldn't get out of there fast enough.  The manager did come over and halfheartedly offer an apology, but that was kind of thrown out the window when he walked away in the middle of us saying something.  They did comp the oysters off the bill, but it didn't really make up for the fact that my boyfriend could taste the oyster for the rest of the day, and even I could smell it on him for the remainder of the afternoon. Thank god for Trident.\\n\\nAlthough our server was great, and this was the first bad experience I've had there, the fact that we were served turned raw fish, is pretty bad. That's dangerous to serve to guests!  I suppose we've learned our lesson. Paying $3-5 per oyster is more than worth it to get quality seafood.\\n\\nHelpful tip:  if you're going to advertise up the wazoo for this special oyster deal, at least invest in some small oyster forks. We were given a huge serving fork for the oysters, which made no sense at all."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Amazing!

There is so much variety, everyone in your group will be able to satisfy their cravings. You want American? Burgers and wings! Mexican? Burritos and Ceviche! Asian??? Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Filipino, and Laotian! All I'm waiting for is a yummy Korean cart to pop up in the future. (Koi Fusion! I'm talking to you!) The sitting area is nice and spacious with a kids play area and an adult play area with a good amount of beers on tap! \\n\\nOne downfall is the tight, compact parking lot. I was there at 6pm and it was super dark also. Couldn't hurt to get some lamp posts installed! It didn't seem like there were a lot of spots, but that's okay because there is plenty of street parking, right? Nope, the streets are extra crowded due to the parked cars from the surrounding town homes and apartments making it hard to drive through. The compact spots are no joke, I accidentally hit the car next to me when I opened my door (I apologized to the person in the car), as I was in my car, someone hit my passenger door when they were getting out of their car (no apology, what a jerk)."},{"name":"Juliano's Pizzeria","address":"15606 SE Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I remember when it was the best in town; no more.

I knew nothing about this restaurant, but I entertain clients at top steakhouses around the country due to my job. Therefore the bar is fairly high if you expect to catch my attention. We were a party of 12 with a reservation. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken moments later. The cocktail menu is very interesting and the drinks themselves are very well crafted and balanced. I choose the salt roasted beet salad with pistachio and a soft cheese followed by beautifully prepared 28 day dry aged ribeye with prawns. The trick with a piece of meat like that is to do as little as possible so as not to screw it up. It came out a perfect medium rare. The 2 grilled prawns were served head on, which i love because there is plenty to eat in the head. Instead of any type of sauce I choose an interesting smoked salt to accompany the meat. I'm glad I took that recommendation from our wonderful waitress. It was just that little bit extra that that separates really good from great. We all wimped out on desert.  I would put this place up against ANY of the well known steakhouses around the country. And it's not just the food or the drinks. The wait staff was EXCELLENT.

Ask for my mails not so great I ordered fried pork chops, greens, and Black Eyed Peas.  The pork chops were OK could have been fried a little harder didn't have much crunch.  The greens were just OK as well nothing to rave about.  Now the black eye peas that was my biggest disappointment they were extremely bland no flavoring at all not sure what happened to them.  So my best Friend she ordered the roasted turkey, dressing & mac n cheese.  She said the Turkey was boring the dressing was once again just OK and another big disappointment was the Mac and cheese tasted like they cooked it in swamp water, it was terrible.  We did notice that everyone was ordering their fried chicken so we decided to take a 2 piece to go. Best decision ever because the fried chicken was pretty tasty and flavorful cooked to perfection.

We had the labneh, about which I'm a freak, chicken liver pate, soft egg toast, brick chicken, octopus, and the grilled branzino.  Plus some broccolini, endive and brussels sprouts.  A girl needs to digest her food, after all.  Now our enjoyment of the food may have been clouded by our unintentional over-enjoyment of the cocktails (we waited two and a half hours for our table, thank several deities for bug spray), but all the apps were fab ('snacky bits' did make me want to stab someone with a fork), the chicken was juicy and crispy, if a bit underseasoned.  The branzino was fab, with slightly charred skin redolent of smoke and not at all overcooked.  The octopus.....didn't quite make it, could have used a bit more time in the marinade, didn't have enough sear and had  bit too much 'bite'. (Read: chewy).  The vegetable sides were total stars, particularly the carmelized endive.  \\n\\nAnd the not so good:  there is no reason to have people waiting for two and a half hours for a table.  Reservations.  Take them.  If you can't accommodate a walk in, say so.  And don't have every random 21 year old who seems to be hanging around the host station, unsure of what her job should be, give me a wildly different estimate of my wait time.  Wait staff:  what's wrong with training?  Yeah, I get it.  Young 'uns with zero experience cost less, but they also don't know stuff like 'serve from the left, clear from the right'.  My Swiss guest almost died of horror when one of the staff actually reached across her to clear her plate, and then spilled the remains in her lap.  Didn't notice, of course.

You get a pretty good amount for the price and the garlic ramen came with this cool tool to squeeze and put the garlic in your soup. It was so rich and savory. the pork was made just right and wasn't engulfed by the garlic like I thought itd would be. The noodles though, oh my the noodles were heavenly. The garlic ramen had thick noodles and they had the perfect texture!! MUST TRY. \\n\\nThe spicy chicken ramen my girlfriend got was fantastic as well, it had thin noodles instead of thick, which were good, but thick are my absolute favorite. The chicken was nice and juicy, and the soup was very rich and not too spicy. good alternative to pork.\\n\\nThe wait for our food was kind of long. it was a 40 minute wait but they were super busy since it was their opening day. I'll have to update the review. despite the long wait, the service was nice and courteous and the owner or manager kept checking up on us and introduced himself personally.

Food is always fresh and the customer service is good, but if you order to-go (AKA in-store pickup) forget about it! I can't think of a time I ordered to-go and wasn't disappointed. My experiences have been:\\n\\n1. Placing my orders online: Well, twice this year alone they claimed my order didn't come through. The first time it happened they were pretty quick in preparing it. The second time it took about 40 minutes! Apparently they made a mistake and gave my order to someone else with the same first name. Not sure, but in any case this is even when I hit the submit button and receive confirmation that my order has been placed, along with a pickup time.\\n\\n2. Food Quality: I have received chicken skewers under-cooked, tough curry chicken, and this last time chewy rice! \\n\\n3. The presentation: They've gotten quite lazy or cheap now with the way they package your order. They used to use nice containers with sections. Now, they just throw your rice in with the meat (for example if you order the curry chicken with the wheat berry rice) into these little plastic tubs similar to butter tubs, the little Asian slaw goes into another container.  I made special instructions to please separate my food, but again they never got the order. so...\\n\\n4. They forget things. The curry chicken comes with wheat berry rice and corn. This last time they forgot to add the corn to my co-worker's order. Since they throw everything together in the little plastic tub you won't know what's missing until you reach your destination and begin to eat. Another time they forgot sauces, and another time they forgot to add my croissant for my soup. Now, I usually check for what I can whenever I pick up my order, but the last two times I had to have a co-worker to pick it up. Of course, they wouldn't necessarily know everything that may come with my particular order, so I don't fault them. \\n\\nI have complained to the manager before, but I hate to have to keep calling up there! It's very frustrating when you have to drive up there on your lunch break (and trust me it takes a minute in Atlanta traffic no matter how close you are), and they keep screwing things up.

Since it was close to the theater and had an interesting menu, we decided this was the place.  Our show started at 7:00 and we did not want to be rushed so we stopped in for an early dinner.  \\n\\nThe bar area was cozy with several tables and booths - warm and inviting.  I loved the look of the bar - somewhat vintage with dim lighting and brick interior walls.  The wine list is nice and what I did not expect was rather nice wines by the glass.  Orin Swift Prisoner is one of my favorite reds and was served by the glass.  The price was also surprisingly low - $13 for a glass or $45 for a bottle.  The winery charges $38 for a bottle of the same wine so not the upcharge I would have normally expected in a restaurant.  Needless to say, my husband and I decided to share a bottle over dinner.\\n\\nThe food was somewhat hit or miss for us.  We started with the pork belly served on a brioche and topped with roasted pear and white cheddar.  I loved this - husband thought it was just ok.  The pork belly was juicy and had a nice crunchy crust.  The pear and cheddar complemented the pork belly so well - I love sweet and savory flavors.  I could have done without the brioche - more like a piece of toast.  It was not what I expected, but didn't detract from the flavor of the other parts of this appetizer.  \\n\\nEveryone seemed to rave about the Prosciutto wrapped grilled Caesar in their reviews so I had to try this.  I had just tried a grilled romaine salad with balsamic and goat cheese at a place in NC and loved it so I had high hopes for this.  Thankfully, the bartender suggested putting the anchovies on the side - I did not care for them at all.  The salad fell flat for me.  I did not enjoy the Caesar dressing and was expecting so much more flavor (especially since the romaine was wrapped in Prosciutto) than what this delivered. \\n\\nMy husband and I opted to share a pizza for our meal.  We went with a small which was more than enough for the two of us.  The crust was crispy and light.  The sauce was flavorful.  We decided to top with pepperoni, onion and giardinera (which the bartender described as a mix of pickled peppers - somewhat spicy).  The pepperoni was some of the tastiest I have had on a pizza - delicious!  I thought the giardinera tasted a bit like spicy banana peppers - I liked it, but my husband thought it overpowered the flavor of the pizza.\\n\\nOverall, I thought this was a solid choice for dinner.

When we were just about to dig in, we saw Voodoo Donuts on \\"Man versus Food.\\" What a coincidence. At least I know what the owner looks like.\\n\\nI had been craving a donut for a long time so this was a nice retreat. The donuts were a Mango Tango and a Memphis Mafia. I was surprised to find that these donuts were still really fresh even all the way from Portland.\\n\\nThe Mango Tango is a raised yeast donut so it's really fluffy. The insides are filled with mango jelly while the top is frosted with white vanilla frosting and another layer of orange frosting. It kinda looks like a Krispy Kreme donut with an orange toupee. When I first tried the donut I thought it was apricot filling. I was quite surprised that it was supposed to be mango. I would bypass the purchase of this donut unless you're a big fan of sweets. The insides feel like a huge glob of corn syrup or simple syrup with artificial flavorings. The dough itself is good but I don't think it needed vanilla frosting on top. It's more like decoration than additional deliciousness. The insides are sweet enough.\\n\\n\\nThe Memphis Mafia, according Voodoo Donut's website is \\"Fried dough with banana chunks and cinnamon sugar covered in a glaze with chocolate frosting, peanut butter, peanuts and chocolate chips on top!\\" I'm pretty surprised at how many ingredients there are because I only tasted a few of them. Maybe because the donut suffers from the same problem as the Mango Tango? TOO SWEET. I couldn't taste the peanut butter, cinnamon, peanuts, chocolate chips, or cinnamon sugar. I did however like this donut a lot more than the Mango Tango. Since the dough is fried and glazed it has a crunchy shell while the dough still has a softness to it. The banana is a savior although there is not enough of it.\\n\\nIf your taste buds are maximized to 100% sweetness, it's really difficult to taste anything else. Adding more is actually getting less. The quality of the donuts and ingenuity at Voodoo Doughnut is awesome; still, the execution and balance of flavors is hardly anywhere near impressive. Please balance those flavors and control the sweetness."},{"name":"Tatsu Japanese Bistro","address":"1441 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Over the years, I have typically stayed clear of Japanese restaurants after an unhappy raw fish experience.

Stop here after Powell's and you will be the ultimate tourist of portland."},{"name":"Magic Wok Restaurant","address":"6700 Conroy Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"How did I ignore this place for so long? It is nuzzled in the strip mall where Turkey Lake Rd. dead ends onto Conroy Rd. At one time not so long ago, Mt. Fuji Sushi anchored one end of the plaza and an old favorite of mind G & G Thai somewhat to the other end. But this place looks like every other strip mall Chinese restaurant....that is, until you walk in.\\n\\nRight next to the front door is a nice little seating area complete with tranquil water feature and bamboo settings. The open dining room offers white table cloth four top tables that can certainly adjoin for larger parties. At the far end of the restaurant is the counter with an enormous wine display. I know right, you are saying wine in a Chinese restaurant? Hold your tongue. There is a nice mixture of grocery store wines and a few not so common. In between these bottles are Chinese wines and sake. After checking the wine list, I realized that not all of the displayed wines were listed. The owner affirmed that they need to reprint the list, but encouraged me that all displayed wines were available for ordering, even take out. There is a certain charm that you feel in this dining room. It is not a fancy smanzy five star, white glove service, but it is not a regular little take out joint either. Certainly a place to sit and have a decent meal.\\n\\nSpeaking of meals, Chinese menu or English menu? Yes, there are both. Why would they have both? Well, this restaurant specializes in traditional Shanghianese and American Chinese Cuisine. The American side of this coin was all the usual suspects that you would expect. The Shanghianese side....hmmm. Luckily, I had a sage with me. My sage professed that this was a very extensive, indeed Shanghianese style menu. Different from Lam's Garden, which is more traditional Cantonese. So naturally we ordered from the Shanghianese menu, which by the way, is written in Chinese Character. The English menu is not a translation of the Chinese menu. They are two completely different menus. But, the owner is more than willing to help you navigate the mighty Yangtze River.\\n\\nStinky Tofu - fermented tofu. If you don't have a nose for funky scents skip this whole section. Have you ever drove by McLeod Rd. and pass the Water Treatment Plant? Or had a sewer back up in your home? Or a very, very, very stinky baby? Open the doors, windows, and turn the fan on high, for this. The smell! I braved it and put it in my mouth. Where did the smell go? You would think that with all that flatulent air the taste would be the same. Not at all. Actually, there was just the flavor and texture of tofu. The accompanied dipping sauce was a bean paste with chili of sorts. Damn good. Get pass the smell, I can see why this is a delicacy. Needless to say I had to go take a long scrubbing shower, cleaned out my nose very well, and brushed my teeth. But, I enjoyed the experience. My sage informed that there are stronger smelling Stinky tofu, I want that!\\n\\nStew Duck - Just meat. My sage explained that the serving of just duck meat with no sauce is the Shanghai style. The duck was braised to tender perfection. Unlike Cantonese Peking duck which is cooked in an oven with crispy skin and layers of fat, Shanghai Stew Duck is braised in liquid, most of the fat is gone and the skin literally melts on contact. The flavors are subtle, with a nice balance of saltiness. Since this restaurant boast of not using MSG, that knock over the head saltiness is absent. Fantastic flavors and texture.\\n\\nFive Spice Beef - Cold beef slices. You are thinking five spice powder on deep fried beef, stir fried? Not! This is beef braised in five spice and other secret Chinese liquids, then cooled to cold and thin sliced. The spectacular almost jellylike beef texture with a sweet subtle flavor sings praises to this preparation technique.\\n\\nSpicy Anchovies - marinated anchovies with peanuts and peppers.  I favor anchovies in anything. I particularly like them deep fried and eaten as snack with beer. But this marination with peanuts, takes the little morsels to a whole different level. Thanks for the pepper but no thanks. Wow. That was hot. I would order this over and over again, but hold the pepper.\\n\\nMagic Wok is certainly a gem. I am still baffled why I did not try this place sooner. It just goes to show don't judge a restaurant by its door or storefront. Walk in, explore, take a look see, challenge your palate, you might just discover that you like it. This place has made my list of must try everything on the secret menu, with my sage of course. Maybe, next time I'll dine in. Go forth and don't be trifled with smells or names.

Not surprisingly, the dining room was empty except for a couple other tables when we arrived around 8pm.  \\n\\nOur overall dinner experience was quite enjoyable, the service was attentive and friendly, yet unobstrusive.  The tables were few, and well spaced out, so it was an intimate and relaxing meal.  \\n\\nThe food was high quality, though somewhat basic in preparation, and perhaps on the expensive side compared to comparable places nearby.  We had a butternut soup and country pate for starters,  chicken and beef entrees which both included a variety of root vegetables, and cookies and coconut/lemon cake for dessert.  The appetizers and entrees were all solid, though not particularly memorable.  The desserts were not obscenely large, as you might find in a typical chain restaurant, but I thought quite generous portions for a boutique bakery, and each could easily have been shared.  For example, the cookie plate included 3 full-sized cookies.  Both desserts were delicious and the highlight to the meal.  \\n\\nOverall, I'd consider returning for a quiet night out, but I think they could be better about answering their phones and the appetizer/entree selections could be spiffed up a bit.  If you are judging on the food itself, I would say that the pricing is on the expensive side, but when you factor in the service, setting, and very small number of tables for the size of the dining room, it seems more reasonable."},{"name":"Rossi Bar And Kitchen","address":"895 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"FINALLY!

I'd save it for an occasional special date."},{"name":"Woodys Wing House","address":"161 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has real potential if they can address some glaring issues with service and quality.\\n\\nService started out ok with a drink order and a minute to look over the menu. I ordered the loaded queso bacon waffle fries as a starter, with 5 Sweet Fire & 5 4th Degree Burn level buffalo wings to follow.\\n\\nService utensils include the traditional Hooter's style wooden plate with knife, fork, napkins & wetnaps, which were brought out after I placed my order.\\n\\nStarter:\\n\\nThe bacon on the queso fries, while not crisp, was certainly cooked at the restaurant and I appreciate the effort. The queso was plain and not at all spicy. The waffle fries were terrible, however. The fries were very bitter, a classic sign of oil oxidation. This really concerned me as most of the menu is fried. I brought this up to a manager upon leaving, who seemed especially confused as to what I meant. This concerned me even more as this is a basic concept in deep frying.\\n\\nHere's the thing, this is a new restaurant; less than 2 months old as of this review. The management and crew should be trained on proper maintenance of the fryers and what can happen if you abuse shortening. That nobody was aware of food being bitter as a symptom of bad fryer oil makes me suspicious of whether they've even changed their oil yet.\\n\\nWings:\\nThe wings were brought out when I was less than halfway through my starter, which is very aggravating. The wings looked great. Woody's breads the wings, which I appreciate(you can get them unbreaded), once again borrowing from Hooter's & Roosters. The Sweet Fire were great and I have no complaints. The buffalo wings are offered at 5 'burn levels' with 5 being the hottest. I got the 4th degree wings. While the wings had the appropriate level of heat, the flavor just wasn't right. Normally, a mild wing sauce is Frank's red hot sauce with liquid butter mixed in, with the heat increasing as the amount of butter decreases. These wings are hotter than straight red hot sauce, so I suspect some sort of capsaicin powder is used. I think these wings lacked depth of flavor that could have been reached with more vinegar, a consequence of not using a pepper sauce as the main form of heat.\\n\\nEven though I'm fine with the level of heat, my face was still messy and certain reactions like sweat and a runny nose are involuntary. Unfortunately, my meal came with only 2 napkins. 1 napkin soaked up my messy fingers and the other napkin wiped my nose.\\n\\nService:\\nAt this point there has been no call backs asking if the fries were ok or asking about a drink refill, so I had to wait several more minutes for the server, Sierra to come back.\\n\\nSierra came back with the check. I asked about more napkins, as my hands were still a mess and my nose was about to start running again. I'm just about halfway through my wings at this point.\\n\\nSierra returned with 2 more napkins and I was never asked about a refill in my unsweetened tea. Those napkins and all wetnaps were completely used up by the time I went to the bathroom to finish cleaning my hands and face. The bathroom had a strong fecal odor and no paper towels.\\n\\nMy suggestions:\\nTrain management and staff on bad frying as well as the enemies of oil. Establish a strict routine for cleaning the fryers and changing the oil.\\n\\nTrain servers on making timely call backs and not serving the main before the starter is done.\\n\\nClean the bathrooms and stock them with the appropriate supplies.\\n\\nSince so much of this place is copied from Hooter's, perhaps copy their use of paper towel holders at every table."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Why did it take me so long to go to Bouldin Creek Cafe???\\n\\nThe food is vegetarian and absolutely divine.

Recently, we arrived at 6:30 on a Thursday night and the place only had 10 tables of patrons. We were seated at a high top with super wobbly chairs so we jumped to the lower table next to it. The floors were really sticky. I think this bar needs to work on their identity - they market themselves as a bourbon gastropub but have a large upstairs party space and great stage for bands. I have never been to the restaurant during a show but I remember trying to eat there in its first year of business and the traffic stopped 5th avenue because everyone wanted to get in. I don't know what has happened but I want the problem to be fixed soon because we love Bar 145!\\n\\nThe beer and cocktail selection is always fantastic and the cocktail hour lasted until 7! Beer for $2.50 and pretzel bites with cheese sauce for $3.50? Yes please! The menu is always fantastic and I have never not liked anything. Actually, I have never not loved anything I ordered. The truffle fries with red pepper aioli are perfection, you have to order at least a side portion. I love the build your own burger because I get exactly what I want (with bacon!) for $10. The options to have the burger over spinach, the fresh ingredients, and countless sauces keep me coming back. Now this isn't the biggest burger you have ever had but it's the correct meal time portion, especially after loading it with saut√©ed onions and red peppers and eating some of those truffle fries. One time I ordered the seasonal vegetables and oh my goodness, I would eat those every day for the rest of my life. The seasoning and quality of ingredients is always fantastic.

Upon entering, I noticed the long line and I saw only booth. So I was about to walk to go save it, but at the same time we were politely told to wait in line to order/pay and then be seated. So we gave it a go. The line was a double line and very cramped but once you get to the counter you watch them cook your food in front of you. We waited for a minute or 2 and we were surpisngly seated. The system works. It seemed to push some people away, but give it a go! You will be surprised. We ordered the caramel & bananas french toast and cinnamon french toast with nutella, strawberries and bananas. The sizes are HUGE and they are DELICIOUS!

So today was my second time back & yet again not enough employee's working on the floor, my food was cold yet again. the only thing hot was the mac&chesse sweet potatoes & greens. but my waffle & chicken wasn't the food is good enough for me to keep coming back but just get some more workers on the floor.

When I went back to get my correct food, the employee tried the number with his own phone, with the same result. He was definitely disturbed by this; I'm sure it will be addressed by the time you read this review.

This mix up is the only reason why I had to dock 2 stars - 1 for giving me the wrong food, and 1 for not having a working phone number.

Garlic naan actually had a generous amount of garlic, plus cilantro which added a nice complementary flavor. I got the daal palak (lentils and spinach in sauce), which was very well seasoned.

The Luigi's meatballs appetizer was just and explosion of delicious flavor. Secret ingredients: pine nuts and raisins. Yum! Served with a delicious piece of bread to sop up all the tomato sauce. I loved the squid ink arancini - comes with three tiny ones, mozzarella in the middle :)\\n\\nFinally! The pappardelle & pheasant ragu! What a treat. Seriously. Plus, as someone who is lactose intolerant, I could tell they used the best ingredients because I didn't feel sick at all.\\n\\nI would love to come back here again. It's worth the wait.

Let's face it, most people go there to catch a show or for a pint at happy hour if there's no other place around.  That aside, I've never had as poor of an experience as this one, which took place at the Kennedy School the Thursday evening before Christmas between 5 and 8pm.\\n\\nI had joined some other sexy lady friends for drinks and a soak (hence the only reason we chose McMenamins), and despite lukewarm temperature of the soaking pool, the Detention Hall had a nice, cozy fire which was a nice feature.  If you haven't been here, there are a few themed rooms that are freakin' microscopic and Detention Hall is one of those.  Six people can fit in there, tops.  It's kind of weird.  Anyway, I ran out to my car which was parked in the Kennedy School parking lot to deposit my wet clothing and found my car window bashed in.\\n\\nI went to the front desk (the chick was incredibly lacking in customer service skills, I had previously discovered) and told the stone-faced girl what had happened.  Meanwhile I'm bleeding profusely from somehow cutting myself on the broken glass and my sexy lady friend had to specifically ask for a band aid.  Frost Princess wasn't about to lend a helping hand of her own free will.  She finally got their \\"security guard\\" who said someone (a customer?) had told them about the break-in.  The \\"guard\\" said it's difficult to know when to patrol the parking lot because it gets dark earlier now and, well.....  Wait, what?  It's been dark at 5 for like two months now.  And obviously he wasn't patrolling the lot at all otherwise he would've discovered the break-in himself.  In short, dude wasn't doing his job; sorry 'bout your luck.  I asked him how common break-ins are.  Apparently car break-ins are rampant at the Kennedy School - something the McMenamin brothers don't want you to know.\\n\\nThat's as may be, but the complete lack of customer service just adds salt to the wound.  I had to go back and ask for a garbage bag and a broom to clean off the driver's seat so I wouldn't cut myself more.  The \\"security guard\\" couldn't be bothered - he passed me off to the custodian who was not the least inclined to help remedy the situation.  Isn't a restaurant, let alone hotel, supposed to be accommodating?  I can't imagine paying the overpriced fare to stay here just to be disregarded.\\n\\nBeware parking at the Kennedy School!

For an \\"American\\"-themed brunch, I decided to make reservations--definitely not needed, but played it safe just in case: saw about 6-8 tables max being served throughout my entire time there. Perhaps people were saving the fun for dinner. The restaurant itself is quite beautiful with a vast space nestling a centrally located kitchen for us to ooh and ahh at the chefs doing their thing.\\n\\nThe food was decent with some ups and downs. My friend and I decided to share a few plates: we started with the Doughnuts w/ Roasted Strawberry Jam and were presented with 3 dry, dense fried balls of stone--a terrible first start. Even though I prefer my meats as bloody and red as possible, I decided to go with my friend's choice of medium well for the \\"Big Ass Burger\\", however, TWO Urban likes to keep their burger temps simple: rare, medium, or well done. While he ordered a medium burger, it definitely came out as rare (no complaints here), and the ground short ribs made the burger exceptionally juicy. Taste-wise, nothing to fangirl about. Though not the best I've ever had, the side of Grits I ordered were quite yummy and a serious competitor to my favorite grits in ATL. Finally, the Tall Stack Buttermilk Pancakes with Georgia Peaches were fluffy, super buttery, and rich.\\n\\nI love valet, especially when I can take advantage of the complimentary valet Atlanta offers (seriously, what kind of relatively large city offers free valet?) However, for restaurants that ONLY provide a valet option for parking, when they have what clearly appears to be an accessible private lot, is slightly irksome for me. It reminds me of Aria, Canoe, et al: here's my valet ticket even though I can see my car and walk to it in 10 seconds. But I digress...\\n\\nJust for a quick additional note, I loved our waitress. She was so chill and super inviting. Pretty much all of the staff was talkative and friendly (the hostesses and walking by the peeps at the bar). I will definitely come back to try out TUL for dinner or even brunch, though, I'll definitely try other items off their menu...except for the grits. I will order those again."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We made reservations for a party of ten for a friends father's 90th birthday. \\nThe food was average.\\nThe server great. \\nBut the manager and the hostess were very rude and obnoxious to us.

We left a six dollar tip on a $26 bill, which is around 20%.

Although there is nothing exceptional about it, all the servers and employees we interacted with were polite and welcoming.  My girlfriend describes all the waitresses as bohemian, free-spirited, and  easy on the eyes haha.\\n\\nDuring the day, Blue Dahlia serves breakfast items and tartines which are like a sandwich on only one slice of bread.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for the tartines and breakfast items.  I think we've tried at least one tartine each visit.  So far we've had:\\n\\nSalmon/cream cheese: My girlfriend got this one.  While she said it was good, her single complaint was that when she bit into the salmon, all of it came off the bread.  Besides that, she said it was really tasty and she would get it again.  \\n\\nFrench Goat Cheese: This one was my least favorite.  It wasn't bad, but it was a little much on the salty side.  I am also not the biggest fan of olives, so the tapenade kind of ruined it for me.\\n\\nBrie/Apricot Reserves:  We both agreed it was awesome and would definitely get it again (after we try other stuff of course =] )\\n\\nProsciutto/Mozzarella: We had similar issues with the prosciutto as with the salmon in keeping it on the bread.  Despite that, we thought it was great.  The Mozzarella was so good on top.\\n\\nMeat/Cheese Platter:  We were both really hoping this would come with brie, but it didn't.  It came with only two types of cheese and three types of meat.  While it was good, I don't think we'll be ordering this again anytime soon--especially for its price.\\n\\nFritatta:  I believe they make these special everyday.  The special when I ordered it was portabella, cheese (i forgot what kind), and peppers (i think?).  Anyway, it was good--no complaints.  I'm not an expert on fritattas, but it was dense, tasty, and filling.  \\n\\nAssorted Breads:  Under breakfast items, comes with three different types of bread and various spreads including orange marmalade and nutella!  If you're hungry, I would definitely order this as an appetizer.  The bread tastes very fresh and we both loved the olive bread.  \\n\\nCreme Brulee:  The one dessert we've tasted so far and it was great.  Just what we would expect creme brulee from Blue Dahlia to taste like.  Tasty and sweet (but not too sweet).\\n\\nAll in all, Blue Dahlia is great.

The Kitchen Sink is my favorite, and I recommend it to everyone. If you have vegetarian friends, have them try this burger. I am about 95% sure they will no longer be vegetarians once they taste this burger.\\n\\nMy only complaint for this place has to do with food allergies. I'm severely allergic to gluten, which means cross-contamination is an issue. If someone touches regular bread and then my burger, I end up getting super, super sick. I ended up sick after eating here once because my burger had bacon on it. Apparently, they deep fry the bacon in the same fryer as the french fries - which are not gluten-free. I asked about 5 times if everything on my burger was definitely okay and was told that it was. I modified my burger so that there would be no gluten-containing elements and they assured me it would be fine.\\n\\nI ended up getting super sick - and for celiac, that means super sick for about two weeks. It's not just a little discomfort. Your brain gets foggy, you're tired all the time, and that's in addition to all the other fun stuff that happens. It's a serious allergy, which is why I generally only go to a handful of restaurants that I know take it seriously.\\n\\nThe next time I was there, I talked to the cashier about my order and was told that the bacon actually is NOT okay, and they deep-fry it along with the french fries. I was really upset that they would be so careless with what I really stressed was a serious allergy. Since that time, they've been really careful with it, but I don't eat there as much as I otherwise would because often times, it feels like a gamble. If they're that careless with my order that time, who knows if they'll forget and grab my burger with the same gloves that touched regular bread? It's like playing Russian roulette. Sometimes I am craving their burgers so much I just go for it and hope that they are careful.

The dressing was excellent, I didn't want to leave a leaf everything was eaten . . . and I just finished another German dish (elsewhere for lunch - by accident)  The Swiss Fondue came next. . . . it gets better & better, this one, I'm buying extra for later!\\n\\nThe group ordered the Rheinlander Feast: sauerbraten, chicken schnitzel, smoked bier sausage with caramelized onions, served with sp√§tzle noodles, braised red cabbage and sauerkraut.  For Dessert we all had the Apple strudel.apples, raisins and sweet spices baked in puff pastry, glazed with apricot jam and dusted with powdered sugar.\\n$29.00 value we got it for FREE!  \\n\\nSince I already had some German music (earlier elsewhere), and this is a 'meeting' we didn't get to hear any German music, from our room . . . so that's OK.  Elsewhere in the restaurant, there were some singing, but I can hear the music in the background as we were leaving.\\n\\nCHECK-IN:\\nToday, a group of our friends took us there for dinner.  I ordered the Roast Half Chicken.  The fries and Caesar salad was excellent, so was the Swiss Fondue.  I didn't order alcoholic bev. But, I was disappointed with my chicken.  I tried cutting the chicken (wing), using my knife & fork.  I saw & saw & saw, decided to use my finger with the knife, but it won't cut, either that I had a dull knife! I've figured it out now, chicken THAT WAS COOKED can easily be separated @ the joint.  That was not so.  This was half roasted chicken, that was HALF COOKED! So, I took almost 3/4th of the chicken, to continue cooking for Sunday's lunch! \\n\\nDeduct 1 star!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went on a quick business trip to Portland and my son suggested I check this place out.

We ended up heading to the Home Slice To Go shop next to the main building and ordered our food there.  We ate it while sitting at the chairs outside of the building, which of course was not ideal, but we still had a great time and enjoyed the food.  On the flip side, my daughter and I ate there today (Friday at about 11:30 AM) and we were seated immediately.  \\nIf you have a chance to eat here, you definitely should take advantage of it.

What an exquisitely executed concept!\\n\\nWe ate on a Sunday, so your only dining option was the four course Prix Fixe (immediately I was reminded of my favorite Thomas Keller venture Ad Hoc). We asked if they had any champagne not on menu and were pleasantly surprised that they had a 2002 from Epernay that neither of us were familiar with. \\n\\nFrom the moment we sat down, the bartender Justin was engaging and knowledgeable. Every interaction with him was informative and delightful. His service was impeccable, his knowledge of the food and wine extensive. He was professional, and prompt and yet very natural to engage with... It was as though we had been invited to a fabulous dinner party and Justin felt more like the charming favored guest of your host, than a member of the staff. \\n\\nWe ordered the wine pairing with the four course prix fixe. The menu changes constantly, so I could describe each dish in detail, but I'm afraid it would do neither of us any good because the likelihood it'll be on the menu when you get there is slim.\\n\\nWhat I will say, is that the first (field), third (meat), and dessert course were wonderful. The flavors were layered exquisitely, nothing overwhelmed the palate, but every bite lent itself to an interesting blend be it the cool dill cream on the fields course, or the slightly spicy sambal mayo on the meat course. The presentations these three courses were architecturally interesting and colorful. The looked neither too contrived nor too sloppy on the plate. \\n\\nThe second (fish) course left a lot to be desired. The presentation was not visually appealing (looking something like mashed peas that had begun to turn brown, with white tapioca floating in it). The Himachi was overcooked, almost to the point of being dry. The wine pairing although delicious, and at no fault of its own... overpowered the flavors that were supposed to be in the dish (coconut tapioca... yet completely void of any coconut flavor). \\n\\nHowever, I have only once (at Ad Hoc) eaten a chef's tasting menu, or a four course prix fixe where I've liked every course. The point of a preset menu in this setting, in my opinion, is less about every course being to your particular tastes and more about appreciating the chef as a culinary artist and having the opportunity to see their passion and interest presented on a plate. With that in mind, although the fish course left something to be desired the meal as a whole, the atmosphere, and the wine were exceptional. \\n\\nI am exceptionally pleased with Lenoir"},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I like this place, I really do.

We asked if they had \\"traditional\\" eggs Benedict and were told they could make it.  What she got was nothing close.  English muffins with spinach and mushrooms with poached eggs and what was supposed to be hollandaise sauce, but clearly wasn't.  We asked the server, she did not deliver the food, if they could again make it \\"traditional\\" with eggs and Canadian bacon, she sId YES.  Came back again, not only was it poached eggs on regular bacon, but they had the audacity to scrape off the spinach and mushrooms and use same soggy English muffin, leaving a couple mushrooms still on.  Had it not been for my wife asking me to simply dismiss it, I would have coached them on how they should have handled this correctly.  The positive was my meal was decent and so was the coffee.

The staff here weren't rude, but didn't really seem to care too much about us (they weren't busy) or give off a professional vibe. The entire place looks pretty run down already. The food was ok. The desserts are pretty good. Drinks were ok. The place is cute but in comparison to the other Amelie's this one is really underwhelming for the price.

When I heard through the beer grapevine that their new tasting room had opened I made a B line for it.\\n\\nFirst off their glasses are freaking awesome. The sampler glasses are mini-wine glasses and their 12 oz glasses are tulip's. ($7 for a glass and I think I'll have to buy one next time I'm back there). The glass works perfectly for their high alcohol complex beers.\\n\\nOn to the beer. I was only able to order the Adam, which I believe is their flagship/original brew. It's 10% ABV and dark, but honestly you can barely detect the alcohol. I was talking to Alan while there and complemented him on the great job he did at hiding the alcoholic content. I've had 6% beers that tasted far more hot than Adam.\\n\\nAt this point in time I think most of the patrons at HotD are beer lovers and so it's a great place to meet new people and talk beer. Once the word gets out and they have food (I believe they will be getting food in a couple weeks, at least that's what the servers said) this place will become very crowded.\\n\\nOverall another great brewpub/tasting room in Portland to stop by and try out."},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Raw oysters were fresh and fabulous.

We split the 8-piece bucket, the truffled mac and cheese, and an order of waffles.\\n\\nThe ambiance is fun - how can you go wrong with an airstream and giant neon sign right off of Congress?  Plenty of picnic tables to enjoy on a nice sunny day.  After we ordered and were handed our drinks I got scared - the drinks were lukewarm at best.  On a warm spring day I wanted something cold! Not a good start.\\n\\nHowever, Ms P quickly redeemed herself when the food arrived.  The chicken is flat out excellent.  Perfectly cooked, with a flavorful crispy skin with a bit of a cajun flair, which I love.  My wife that usually salts her chicken was able to abstain, as the flavors were spot on.  In our bucket we recieved wings, drumsticks, and tenderloins - they do not offer thighs or breasts.  I would have liked a thigh or two, but the tenderloins were better than any fried chicken breast would have been.  The chef even threw in an extra drum because he said the pieces were a little bit small today.  They also give you some Hawaiian rolls and deliciously pickled jalepenos on the side that I used to \\"kick it up a notch\\" for the perfect savory-spicy chicken experience.  \\n\\nThe truffled mac and cheese was wonderfully decadent and plenty cheesy, unlike what I expected from some of the previous reviews I read.  The chef explained that he was out of black truffle oil, and used white truffle oil instead.  Perhaps an issue for some, but not for me - would gladly eat this side again!  If you like Kraft it may not be your thing, but those who prefer a more \\"adult-style\\" mac and cheese will not be disappointed.  \\n\\nThe one forgettable portion of the meal was the order of waffles.  They were very light and crispy, with a dash of powdered sugar and served with syrup on the side.  Perhaps it is because I am a fan of denser, more-doughy Belgian waffles, but these just didn't do it for me.\\n\\nOther than the warm drinks given at the register (minus 1 star), the customer service was good.  The chef provided great customer service, was informative, and genuinely cared that everyone enjoyed their meal.\\n\\nIf you don't mind spending more money and want a more diverse menu, I would go to Lucy's.  If you want the best chicken and waffles in town go to 24 Diner.  But, if you just want tasty crispy fried chicken on a nice day you can't do much better than Ms P's."},{"name":"Tatsu Japanese Bistro","address":"1441 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Soooo good!!

Well, MA... your laws needs to be updated to comply with the rest of the happy American places!\\n\\nI walked in and near the front entrance was their oyster bar. I sat at the only empty seat available, the bar top sloped, using coasters to level out the bowls and plates from sliding into your lap and eventually onto the floor. Not the most friendly or engaging staff, but the oysters were fresh, the chowda was good, but not the best one I've had in Boston, and the local brew was delicious!\\n\\nI lucked out and met some friendly patrons that sat next to me that made my visit a little more pleasant. Turns out that they were from Maine.\\n\\nService was fast, food, I can't really tell you because I only had the chowda.. The oysters were good and shucked right in front of you.

To start with, service in Austin is often just not that great, too many slacker waiters who think it's cool to act bored and nonchalant. Not so with Laundrette, where the entire staff took great care of us, from our waitress to the host to other servers and a manager/owner who came by to briefly chat. Example: we arrived about 5:45, and after promptly getting us drinks and appetizers, our waitress came around to check on us with 3 minutes left for happy hour to see if we needed a second round (we did!). \\n\\nAnd the appetizers and snacky bits! We ordered a lot, and I honestly couldn't pick a favorite. From the fried shrimp to the burrata to the crudo, they were excellent. The escargots, while very good, didn't reach the level of others for me personally, although the lovely creamed spinach/kale chorizo sauce under was delicious. (Another example of great service--the wait staff kept bringing us unasked extra baguette for the sauce.)\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, the vegetable options here are unbelievably delicious. The grilled broccoli may have been my favorite broccoli dish ever. The zucchini salad and brussels sprouts were also superb; the brussels sprouts were very crispy, and the marmalade added a nice sweetness against the bitterness of the sprouts.\\n\\nI don't give 5 stars (well, maybe once), and as always, perfection is a goal never to be attained. I do think the whole king crab was a miss, with just too many flavors masking the natural sweetness of the crab. The dish would have been better in a simpler format (crab and lemon butter!).  One friend loved her brick chicken, another loved her gnocchi, but I tasted the chicken and found it overpriced at $22 and just not that special (she loved it and would disagree with me).\\n\\nWe had desserts which were excellent--the buttermilk pie was a win with a texture and taste more akin to a pane cotta, the apricot sticky pudding went exceptionally well with the Italian dessert wine I ordered.\\n\\nI'll be back here!

It has maybe 10 total seats, two of which (the only empty two) we managed to snag after showing up right after work at about 5 p.m. on a Wednesday.

For them to nail down these bite size flavor farms so easily, it inspires me to revisit their use at home.\\nThe burger I had was juicy and extra beefy. The patty was fresh and hand made.

Once our order was taken, it took \\"forever\\" to get our food (30-45 minutes). \\n\\nWe have three younger kids. For those of you with kids, you know how things can get if young kids get hungry. When our food did finally arrive, we were brought only two of the three entrees we ordered. The portions were penurious, to say the least. We let one of our servers know we were still waiting for the third dish, but all he said was it's on its way. Well, the third dish never showed up after another 30 minutes. Our waitress finally came with the bill and we asked her where the third dish was. She gave us some idiotic excuse about miscommunication and we told her to just take our credit card. \\n\\nIt was getting close to our kid's bedtime. We'd been at the restaurant for about an hour and a half at this point. The entire time we were there, maybe two more tables were seated. It was nowhere near busy.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we were all hungry and now very tired. Our two youngest started to whimper and cry as we left once they realized the third dish wasn't coming. We ended up going across the street to Dairy Queen to buy hamburgers, just so no one would go to bed hungry. What a mess!\\n\\nI think it's safe to say that Ploy's will likely go out of business in the next 3-6 months. If anyone who knows how to run a restaurant is out there and thinking of starting a restaurant, the retail space that Ploy's currently occupies is a prime location in an under-served area. It should be available within the next year."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Andina is quite an expensive experience, especially if you really want to do it right from cocktails to desserts. It's hard to say if the cost was really justified but nevertheless, the food and service were great. First off, go for the tapas! Ceviche was excellent. The mixta nikkei causa (potato, spicy tuna and crab salad) was a pleasant surprise. On the other hand, the entrees were a bit of a disappointment. The arroz con mariscos was tasty but the portion was small. The fish in pescado al rocoto y kion was overcooked and dry. Definitely next time I am able to visit, I would likely skip the entrees all together and just sample a bunch of tapas. Lastly, I was thoroughly impressed by some of their cocktails. While I don't like my drinks spicy, the sacsayhuaman was flavorful and unique. I also recommend the ron-yki-on. \\n\\nDon't forget to make a reservation in advance!

The restaurant is beautiful. bright, clean lines and open, light filled space.The staff is very pleasant and helpful. We didn't feel rushed at all-in fact, we had a 2 hour lunch and never once felt like the staff was trying to  move it along and turn the table. I recommend the raw eastern oysters with house made hot sauce and house made wheat saltines for a starter. not only were they very fresh, but each oyster had been FULLY loosened from the shell for ease of consumption. the whitefish chowder was also very good and the gumbo is one of the best offerings. The   lobster roll was fresh and airy-not slathered with tons of mayo like some other places tend to do. the lavender and lemon meringue with fresh honey comb was perfect for sharing and just delicious. Even the coffee was good, and that is saying a lot because in my experience, most southern restaurants serve exceedingly week coffee. it was bold and had a smooth finish. Allover, an excellent experience. I will be going back one night to visit the adjacent oyster bar where the menu had at least six different kinds of oysters on offer. As the warm weather comes, it is a great time to go because you can dine outside. they even have a mini putting green. The only drawback is the location-on howell mill road, right past star provisions, but directly across the street from the union st. mission.

We asked the waitress to take it back and she apologized and brought it out again. Pictures attached are of said \\"medium rare\\" steak. Everyone I have shown so far can agree that the steak is RAW, not even just rare. It is so raw, you can see the fat lines in the beef. The waitress that was helping us was busy so we waved over another waitress. When she got to our table, she said to me \\"what do you want.\\" After we explained the meat, she started to argue with us that the meat was medium rare. She left and said she'll get the manager, which she did not. We waved over our original waitress and she apologized and said she would take off $6 off the dish for the extra cost of the new york strip. The thing is, the plate price still includes a 2 pieces of meat deal, so we paid for more than we ate. The only reason I am giving 2 stars and not one is because the first older waitress was very friendly and apologetic, and my dish was standard."},{"name":"Highland Bakery Midtown","address":"1180 Peachtree St NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My coworkers and I dined here for lunch on a Friday and if you do the same, make sure to come early!

I quickly chose to order a half and half--half of their house salad and half of the roast beef sandwich. We quickly grabbed a table and although in random order, the food for our entire table of 8 arrived in less than 15 minutes. My salad and sandwich were very delicious. All the ingredients were fresh and light. I'm not sure what it is, but the balsamic vinaigrette that accompanies their house salad is some of the best balsamic I've ever had... it was truly addicting and I couldn't get enough!

We decided to do the three course prix fixe with a wine pairing. The lobster bisque tasted off. Main course was short ribs with polenta. I've never eaten well done short ribs before! Just awfully over cooked and no flavor. Black Forest cake was not edible. Like two bites were all I  could swallow, a first ever in all my years of eating cake! Our waitress was very nice but the service was quite slow. We sat with our main course completed for a solid 15-20 minutes before someone cleared them and the same with dessert.

The loaf was obviously overcooked as the bottom and sides of every slice was burnt black (inedible unless you like the taste of burnt stuff).
