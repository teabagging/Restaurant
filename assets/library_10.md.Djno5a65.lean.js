The salmon that another member of my party ordered was over cooked. In general the food isn't very good.\\n\\nThe service started out fine but our server kept trying to give us the check before we were even done with drinks, never asking if their was anything else she could bring us. In fact, when we finally did pay, she started cleaning off the table and collecting the signed credit card slips before we were even done with the last sips of our drinks. It wasn't close to closing, and the section was only half full, so it didn't really make sense why they would want to rush us out. \\n\\nThere are plenty of places nearby that do what Hops N Scotch tries to do much better.

Friends had been there repeatedly with glowing reviews so when I finally had the opportunity to join them I jumped at the chance.\\n\\nFirst off, we had made reservations. When we arrived, they had the wrong time with the wrong number of people. Okay, mistake right?\\n\\nNext, the host walks us to a table, lays down menus. We start pulling out chairs to sit. Right before we sit down a different server runs over, grabs all the menus off the table and runs the opposite direction with no word to anyone. We stand there, along with the host that was seating us, looking at each other like, \\"what just happened and what are we supposed to do now.\\" The server who grabbed our menus started laying them on a different high top table right beside a large party of people we didn't know.\\n\\nOkay, next. After a good 15-20 mins we finally waved down a server who took our drink orders which arrived maybe 20 mins later (while we sat there and watched the bar tender stand around talking to the locals bellied up to the bar).\\n\\nWe ordered entrees, orders came back wrong, missing items, as our server kept proclaiming \\"it's only my second night.\\" Ordered another round of drinks, another 15 mins later we asked our server if someone was getting our drink order and he said, \\"oh the bar tender is waiting on glasses from other tables because we ran out.\\" You ran out of glassware? Really? A restaurant, with a bar ran out of glassware? \\n\\nNeedless to say toward the end of the visit we were told, \\"we've just come under new management.\\" So you know, I get it but COME ON. How can a restaurant under new management let things tank so badly? To me, it should be the opposite, this is when service and experience should be impeccable, to get customers to return. Bad experience, prob won't go back. Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen.

The meal is only worth $6 or $7 especially since you are basically gathering all the ingredients and flavoring the food yourself.

That means, if you don't put enough sauce or spill too much spicy sauce on your food, you could end up with an unpleasant meal. At the $8 - $10 price price levels, going to a local grocery store and cooking a meal yourself would be more worthwhile. In order to improve, Mongolian Grille should make the cook flavor your meal for you so that it doesn't end up too bland, salty, or spicy because let's face the facts, you're here to eat a delicious meal cooked by someone else, or else why would you even come to a restaurant?"},{"name":"Agro Caf√©","address":"1201 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We were very pleased with the great taste of the coffee and the little snacks were simple and nice.

He does in fact begin to turn his back and walk in the other direction before his arm has even ceased it's militaristic pivot.

It's better than OK, but one trip hasn't made me a fan yet.\\n\\nThere are two types of burgers out there.  Toppings burgers (Killer Burger, etc) and then meat burgers (Not sure many places are known for this, but my favs are NePo42, Pints Brewing, Shanghai Tunnel).  \\n\\nBasically, your topping joint has a thin patty piled with wild toppings.  If you're asked how you want your burger cooked, getting any pink is unlikely; the patty is simply too thin.  And really, if you're paying attention to the meat, you're doing it wrong.  It's the salami, eggs, bacon, cheese, jalapenos, onion rings, bbq sauce, philly steak, peanut butter, whatever that you're supposed to be paying attention to.\\n\\nYour meat place will probably offer bacon and perhaps a few cheeses as a topping option.  Your meat will be the star of the show and should be a nice thick patty, cooked to order.  A medium-rare burger with a bun that holds up is basically the holy grail at a joint like this.  With quality beef, your eyeballs should basically pop out of your head while your taste buds explode after taking one bite.\\n\\nI'm a little biased toward the meat burger place.  But they're rare.  And, I do love a toppings burger place.  So...\\n\\nTilt is solid.  Good toppings burger.  I wouldn't say it's better or worse than Killer Burger on a quality front.  On the price side however, it's borderline ridiculous.  There's just nothing really warranting a $10 topping burger that doesn't come with a side.  Period.\\n\\nThat said, the jalapeno tots I had were amazing!  Absolutely fantastic.  I'd even say they're worth $5, though that's pushing it.\\n\\nAt the end of the day though, burger, tots and a beer @ $20.

I am talking world-class third-world class, worst ever award for globally produced milkshake epic failure. \\nI gave this place 2 stars because the cheeseburger was OK. Not great, not bad, but OK. Still it wasn't \\"cheap\\", more like $3.75. A cheap burger is at Wendy's, on the dollar menu...... \\nDid I mention how bad the milkshake was? I had a serious craving for a milkshake. I haven't had a proper milkshake in over a year. Obviously this did not meet the requisite. \\nThere is a video on YouTube from these three dishola.com fools who go in search for the best chocolate shake in Austin, The final conclusion was Dirty Martin's with one of them giving it a 10. A PERFECT 10!!! \\nWhaaaaa????? \\nHow did this happen? Well first, the three fools said Fry's who uses hand dipped ice cream and Ghirardelli chocolate was the worst. How can that be? But the soft-serve, ice-milk mass was the best? That's what they use, some cheap, probably the cheapest industrial food grade, prison-grade imitation ice-milk. Then the chocolate, ....uh what chocolate? There was chocolate in there? Did she think I said cappuccino or something? It was so weak, even the color was off, like a pale grayish light tan. Not any kind of shade of chocolate. \\nSo what did it taste like? OK, imagine taking some pond water, then freezing it into ice cubes. Then add some powdered dry milk (make sure it's stale), then take some stale imitation chocolate left over from last Easter (that you got at the dollar store) adding just a *tiny* bit, and mix it all together. VOILA! Dirty chocolate milkshake, a perfect 10!\\nBut on the positive side, now I know I can go just about anywhere and get a superior milkshake than that, I can go to Wendy's for a Frosty, WhataBurger, Burger King, it is so easy to find a superior chocolate shake in this town now that I have seen the worst life has to offer.

I asked for a 12 year Macallan ($18). When the waiter brought it over he said they were out of the 12 year and so he brought me the 18 year.  I assumed that he was switching this at no extra cost as he never bothered to tell me that the 18 year was $46 an ounce!

Approachable, great conversation, but not too chatty, which is great.\\n\\nWhen you go, it's a smaller menu, but you'll find that the options all sound amazing and you'll have good envy for any option you don't choose. For $20, you get a drink, a savory item, and a sweet item. I used to think this was pretty spendy, but if I break it down to $12 for my savory, $2 for my beverage, and $6 for my dessert, it's pretty reasonable compared to what you would spend for that many items anywhere else. They can't make a ton of accommodations with a limited menu (plus, it's a pop-up, so it's not even their own kitchen), but if you ask, they are willing to accommodate if they can. If you look at the menu ahead of time, you'll know that this is not the place for someone with a diabetic diet. \\n\\nAnyway, I cannot say enough great things about the place--there will likely be a wait, but they have fun little activities (coloring, Nintendo, etc.) that'll help keep you busy."},{"name":"Crazy Dough's Pizza","address":"The Garage, 36 JFK St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I'm sorry, you work in a pizza store.

We had 7:00 PM reservations but hubs and I were out of work early so we ended up sitting at the bar starting around 5:30 pm. I ordered the sangria and he ordered a beer. I can't say I'm a fan of the sangria. It was incredibly sweet and the after-taste was very bitter (like orange rinds were left in the mix for far too long). I didn't miss the alcohol at all as others have eluded to (it was quite strong) and I very quickly knew I would be switching to another drink. I ordered the Malbec which was decidedly a better choice for the time being. While at the bar, we ordered the chorizo fundido. Very delicious. We both enjoyed it. A lot of spice, a lot of cheese, and it comes with tortillas (chips upon request). \\n\\nWhile at the bar, we found it very awkward to watch one of the bartenders argue with the other. Bartender 1 would ask Bartender 2 simple questions about putting orders through and she would bark back things like, \\"I'm not stupid! I know how to do my job!\\" She was attentive to patrons at the bar, but her attitude towards her colleagues was unappetizing. \\n\\nWhen our reservation time finally came 'round - we moved into the dining room. We loved the wall of water with the divers - very cool looking. We ordered the tableside guac for an appetizer - it was definitely tasty. I decided on the cheese enchiladas for my meal. They were really tasty, but they were drowning (literally drowning) in the sauce and I would have preferred far less of it on the plate. The hubs had the duck tacos and said they were delicious. Our dinner companions, had the fish tacos and the chicken enchiladas. The enchilada to sauce ratio was the same for them - too much! The fish tacos were lauded as quite tasty, but the tortillas were advertised as flour but she got corn ones instead (which were too dry for her taste). \\n\\nAll in all - a relatively solid dining experience though service could have been kicked up a notch. Our waiter seemed young (and perhaps inexperienced). We ordered three Dos Equis and we got 1 Dos Equis and two Sam Adams Stouts. As he was pouring the beer, I noticed how dark it was and had to say, \\"I don't think that's Dos Equis.\\" He was very apologetic and came back with the right order."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is delicious!

There were also some other random veggies in the mix:  brussle sprout bits, a few pieces of asparagus & more orange squash- diced.  These came with 4 small dry taco wraps/tortilla's that had no taste, or rather tasted like what I imagine softened cardboard would taste like.  On the side were 3 little puddles of sauces.  Basically, there was nothing to put in the tacos- aside from the 'flaps' of mushroom and some of the sauces.  I was very disappointed, especially since the waitress made a point to tell us that the veggie tacos were 'very delicious'.  I would encourage them to remove this from the menu or fix it so it isn't a soupy luke-warm puddle.  Maybe dice some vegetables on top or even on the side.  Maybe cheese or tomatoes or guacamole.

Also, being a longtime business owner and entrepreneur myself, including service related businesses, I value the importance of customer service and the  often \\"make or break\\" impact that it can have on success. \\nI have lived in Austin since 1975 and obviously seen tremendous changes during this time. I have also traveled extensively, and have had the opportunity to experience many different restaurant venues over the years. Being a bit of  \\"foodie\\",  I have enjoyed the increasingly, interesting offerings that Austin has had in the food industry, especially in recent years. \\nWhile I am not specifically in the restaurant industry, it is no secret that particularly in markets such as Austin, it is a very competitive and challenging industry to succeed in and that it takes more than just good food, service and location, as witnessed by a huge number of failures every year. I believe that this increasingly competitive environment has spawned an entirely new level of culinary creativity. This new component seems to be emerging as a new success metric being judged along with service, food quality, location and value pricing. \\nThat being said, somehow your group seems to have discovered the secret recipe for successfully balancing these components, witnessed by successes such as years (Z'Tejas, Hopdoddy, Roaring Fork, Eddie V's and Wildfish Seafood Grille, all of which are coincidently, some of my favorite eating destinations.  However, highly successful strategic, visionary planning and design have to include quality management oversight to be sustainable, which can be quite challenging as businesses grow in size. \\nThis brings me to the point of my communication, the egregious treatment by one of your management staff at one of your new and exciting venues here in Austin, Texas, The Salty Sow.  \\nI live in downtown Austin now and make a point to frequent weekly pilgrimages to new and exciting eatery venues. My girlfriend and I discovered The Salty Sow a month or two ago, and last night (Saturday, July 28, 2012) returned for the third time. Since we observed that The Salty Sow was quickly becoming another very popular destination, my girlfriend made advance reservations for a 7:30 pm seating for two through open table several days in advance. \\nWhen we arrived, the place was getting quite busy, however there was only one party in front of us at the hostess desk and no parties waiting. We approached the hostess desk, identified ourselves to  one of the two very young hostesses, a portly blonde, who acknowledged our reservations and gave seating instructions to the other hostess, who escorted us to our table. As we were escorted through the entire restaurant, I noticed that while quite busy and well staffed, there were still quite a number of empty tables inside including a good number of available \\"two-toppers\\". At this time, since we were never asked our preference,  I asked the hostess if we could be seated inside since it was still close to 100 degrees F outside. She continued to escort us to the outside, where she directed us to sit at a \\"six top\\" table outdoors in a corner with absolutely no ventilation. We did notice two fans outside, however, neither were impacting our isolated \\"sweat corner\\". My girlfriend, who rarely complains, indicated that it was very uncomfortable and that this would make enjoying our much anticipated experience quite difficult. I addressed this with the hostess as well as pointing out the numerous empty tables inside and asked if she could look into seating us inside even if we had to wait a bit. After looking distressed, she said that she would look into it. She left and returned about 10 minutes later, leaving us in the sweltering heat. When she returned, she stated that they could not accommodate us and that all of the inside seating was \\"reserved for people with medical conditions\\".  At this point, I politely asked to speak to the manager. The hostess said that she would go get her. \\nWe waited for what seemed to be a very lengthy period (I did not time it) during which one waiter brought us water and stopped to by at least twice to ask us if we needed anything. We indicated our situation and finally told him that we were waiting for the manager. He pointed out that a portly blonde who had been chit chatting with several people about 25 feet away for sometime, was the manager. I asked her name and he told us it was Gina.

For a little bit, we were actually the only table in the place, with one table of two dining al fresco.  \\nThe impression that I got the minute I walked in was that I accidentally stumbled into a Cost Plus World Market.

The muffins were ok, a bit dry.  Luckily they come with this delicious maple honey syrup stuff to put on them.  The cassoulet was a WT hit.  You really can't go wrong when you top something with cheddar cheese and Fritos.\\nFor dinner, I ordered the 3 meat combo with the chicken, brisket, and hot link; my sides were the mac & cheese and the corn on the cob. (side note..... ordering the corn on the cob was a brave move on my part since I watched the guy drop one on the floor on his way back to the kitchen, pick it up, and instead of carrying it separately, place it on the top of all the others!  Granted, none of them had been shucked yet, but it's the principal!) Truth be told, I only ordered the hot link because the hubs wanted it....  I traded it off for a rib!\\nAnyway, like I mentioned, we were just about the only people in the place & it took forever to get our food!!  Some guy came in, ordered take-out after we had ordered, sat down had a beer, got his food & left.  There we still were, waiting for dinner.  Ahhh, finally it came.  It was cold.  None of us complained.  Why bother?  I mean, the butter on my corn wasn't even melting.  The brisket was tough, the ribs were tough, but the chicken breast was the saving meat on that sorry plate.  Even though it wasn't hot, it wasn't over-cooked, and it tasted good.  By the way, if you are going to go here, and you're going to order the brisket..... bring your own sharp knife.

The owner was incredibly courteous and nice. The food was also really good in terms of quality and presentation for a buffet restaurant. Restaurant was a decent size, comfortable and clean. The fish to rice proportion was also decent considering most sushi buffets usually load up the rice in sushi rolls; we didn't have that issue here so +1 for this restaurant!\\n\\nThe only thing I was incredibly upset about is the staff at the restaurant. Most does not speak english well, which was fine, except they would just stand around and talk. They don't come over to ask if we need anything until we wave one down and they only take away dirty dishes when they are already here. Some of our food came late, not because the restaurant was busy (there were only 3 full tables including mine and 3 staffs and 2 sushi chefs), but because they didn't make it until we asked them about it. Every time we waved down a staff, they sighed as if we just ruined their day. Before they gave us our check, my husband noticed 2 of the staff looking at the tab with dirty looks and making comments before coming over to us (they were in clear sight!!). \\n\\nOverall, I may come back if I desperately want sushi buffet since they have the best quality for the price near where I live.

Would not order the spicy sushi combo again because It was a bit fishy for us, but everything else was wonderful. Sockeye was fresher than most high end places I go to, chicken teriyaki & rolls were still warm when arrived. The reason for the 1 star deduction is that I asked for extra shredded radish to accompany the fish, but they might've thought it meant NO radish.

I think the same principle applies to la Barbecue, except that it should be \\"in order to be full of delicious barbecue, you have to first wait in a line for two hours on an empty stomach in the blazing sun\\". What I mean to say is: there's a lot of stress associated with going to this place, but it's worth it.\\n\\nA few friends and I came here at about 10:30 on a Saturday, and it was absolutely packed. The food truck is stationed at the front of a park area with a few other food trucks in the park, and I felt bad for the other trucks because the huge line all the way to the back of the park and down the alley was ONLY for la Barbecue. Pro tip is to get a Thai iced tea from the other truck while you wait in line.\\n\\nI thought it would maybe be a 30 minute wait, but by the time we actually got to order we'd been waiting for about two hours, all the while seeing them run out of more and more menu items - they make a whole ton of barbecue in the morning, and close up shop when it's all gone. I can only assume they sell out and turn people away every single day. The sun was blazing overhead and I got more than a little sunburned.\\n\\nIt really takes a lot for me to say that this food was worth it, and I think there's a certain placebo effect that makes brisket and pork ribs taste a lot better after you've been sweating in the sun for two hours waiting for it, but my god, that barbecue was soooo good. The brisket was insanely tender and it's served with two kinds of sauces (one sweet and one tangy), each of which tasted like a different piece of heaven. The ribs were delicious as well.\\n\\nI wouldn't recommend going to this place every single weekend (especially since it was more expensive than I expected also - I paid about 25 dollars for the lunch). I wouldn't even recommend waiting in that line if it's not a special occasion. But I think it's something that's absolutely worth doing once, especially if you're only visiting Austin for a weekend. I can't bring myself to give la Barbecue 5 stars because of the wait, but I'll settle for 4 because it was so, so satisfying."},{"name":"Rishi Sushi Kitchen & Bar","address":"114 N 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"The sushi panini was amazing.

The mayo that they use for the spicy mayo on the scallops is heavy and off-putting, I couldn't eat it and I love spicy scallop sushi. I also found their miso soup to be especially \\"seaweed-y\\" and super salty. They sell their nigiri as one piece instead of two, which is nice if you just want to try something to see if you like it. The rolls were ok.

All of their chicken products seem to use the same, low quality, fatty dark meat chicken. It was a chore to eat even half of the chicken katsu or teriyaki chicken they brought out.

We had nice conversations with the two chefs in front of us, who were interesting characters.  The restaurant put on the Baylor-Oklahoma State game at the bar for us to watch.

Good selection for us vegan folk, but it isn't the best food ever. What gets me in trouble are the milkshakes and he desserts! The meals are reasonably priced (~$8-12 for an entree?) but the milkshakes and desserts start to make things more expensive and way more calorie-dense. The milkshakes are delish- rich, smooth, creamy. Just divine. \\n\\nTheir sweets rock- their cakes are moist and have a perfect crumb. Their brownies aren't overwhelmingly sweet, but instead have a slight bitter tang that I associate with dark chocolate. The muffins, while sweeter than I'd like, remind me of the muffins I ate before going vegan- unhealthy and fluffy, much unlike the dense, subtly sweet whole grain vegans ones I've grown accustomed to. The cookies are soft and yummy. I haven't tried the meringue, since I'm not the biggest fan of lemon.\\n\\nAs for the actual entrees...\\n\\nTheir burgers are good! Homemade, and oh-so-yummy. \\n\\nThe mac&cheese and grilled cheese on the other hand... meh. The homemade vegan cheese sauce they use is okay, but nothing special.

But one morning, I see a notification for a BONERS bbq, and my first thought is \\"wtf, seriously, there's actually a place called 'boners?'\\"\\n\\nFurthermore, I go to about 30+ Braves games a year.  I had no idea this place even existed until the Braves' season actually ended.\\n\\nAnyway, there was no chance in hell I wasn't going to try a place called Boners, my inner-14 year old demanded I go there.

The waitress I had was super cute and friendly, and there was no wait at 12:30 on a Thursday afternoon, so I was seated immediately.\\n\\nThe pictures of all the Bettie Page pin-up style artwork on the walls were smirk-worthy and expected; would I bring my mother here?  Probably not, nor any kids, but that's what being single in Atlanta is all about, avoiding such awkward scenarios.\\n\\nI ordered the meat plate (pork) with onion rings and beans.  Everything was pretty good.  Not the best barbecue I've ever had, but the meat was smoky, with some good chew and burnt pieces (definite good thing), and the sauce was on the sweet side.  Portion vs. price definitely favors the consumer, and I hated having to waste food, but there was no way I could eat everything in front of me.\\n\\nService was a little on the slow side, my lunch break ended up being two full hours by the time I got back to midtown, but I wasn't mad.

On a recent trip during SXSW, I was told that before I left the city I needed to make a stop at La Barbeque, and with an empty stomach.  The last Saturday of the festival, we decided to skip breakfast and head over to the truck at around 10:50am to wait in line. Lines form quick and wait time can turn into hours, so it's best to get there early! Thankfully, the line wasn't so deep and our wait time was about a half hour.  \\n\\nOf course we had to try a little bit of everything, so once at the window my group of three ordered ribs, brisket, turkey, a sausage link, the house-made pickles and coleslaw. The meat was sliced right at the window and dropped onto our tray.  I watched with pure love in my eyes as the juices ran and smoke rose.  We took our several-pound tray over to the second window, got our sides, paid, and finally it was time to head to the picnic tables to dig in.  \\n\\nI didn't even bother to use the utensils, I Medieval Times-style went right in with my hands! The ribs fell right off the bone and had an incredible peppercorn rub. They were so juicy, no BBQ sauce necessary in my opinion! I then moved onto the brisket and my mind was blown.  I've never eaten any piece of meat that was this tender and juicy.  It had the perfect smoke ring and the saltiness around the fat was absolutely addicting. The turkey was also quite good, glistening with juicy goodness that put every Thanksgiving turkey I've had to shame. I'd have to say the Brisket was my hands down favorite, followed by the ribs then turkey.  Also surprisingly good were the pickles!  The sausage was only so-so, as was the near flavorless chipotle coleslaw, but then again it was hard to compete with the level of the brisket and ribs.  \\n\\nIf you find yourself on a BBQ journey of Austin, TX, be sure to put La Barbeque to the top of your list.

The chicken wings in the Midnight Train were okay....but the waffle was soggy. I prefer  waffles with a nice crispy outer layer. I only get corn muffin from one place in Brooklyn,NY. The corn muffin here tasted just like it! Very moist and perfect texture. \\n\\nTook off one star for dry meat and soggy waffle and other star for my parking situation. I knew there was parking in the back of the restaurant. We were driving by the front, and a guy was in the parking lot next to the restaurant. He kept waving and pointing to the restaurant. It looked like he was ushering cars into the lot. Then he asked if we were eating at Glady's, he said yes and told us to park in the back to save $10. \\"Why park here when you can park for free.\\" We had already known about the free parking and was busy looking for it until he distracted us. We parked, and after getting out of the car, the same guy was there. HE FOLLOWED US!! Then he proceeded to ask for money. We gave a dollar. \\"I helped you save $10 and you give me $1??\\" He kept walking behind us, then passes by a friend that asked him if he made any money. -- That tells me it is not a one time event but something that happens all the time. Obviously, this completely ruined our mood for the evening, and I was eating while wondering if my car will be there afterwards. For this reason, I will NOT be going back and suggest people to try other places, such as Folk's.

The Pancakes were HUGE, really, don't get more than 2. They were also very tasty in that 'you know this didn't come from a box' kind of way. The Sausage gravy was perfect, it didn't taste like lard and it wasn't too salty. The best part though was my order, a Crabcake Omelette topped with horseradish sauce! Wow, unexpected, Crabby, just a little spice. One of the better Breakfast dishes I have had in the city. The coffee was also good.\\n\\nSecond, the Bar. The Bar of Marshall's is an interesting place because it attracts a very specific type of person. Marshall's appeals, for whatever reason, to the late 20's, early 30's crowd. This makes it an ideal singles bar because if you happen to be looking for someone in that age range then you tend to find someone. Very, very few college students make it this far from campus and the yuppie crowd of the Arena District is also avoided. As for the bar itself? The prices are moderate and the drinks heavy.

I got a tummy ache after though :( ...   \\n\\nJust a note though, this is americanized chinese food, but its decent compared to panda express."},{"name":"Blasi's Cafe","address":"762 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"I've been coming here for years and while it's not everyone's cup of tea, it really stands out as a great neighborhood spot for me.\\n\\nMy most recent visit was last night. I generally stick to the deli sandwiches as my main course, because they're stuffed and delicious. I got a ham and cheese sandwich, as I normally do, because they use a nice imported ham normally (Danish, I believe) unless you ask for honey ham, which is also available. My guess is that the previous reviewer that called it \\"slimey\\" ham either had a fluke bad ham sandwich, or isn't used to Danish-type ham. Without exaggerating, I have probably had over thirty ham and cheese sandwiches at Blasi's in the last eight years or so and I've never had one that was less than *good* so I stand behind that.\\n\\nItalian, pastrami, and other specialty meats stand out as well as hearty and delicious options, especially on the fresh sub rolls!\\n\\nAnother gem of the menu is simply one component of a number of meals - the tomato sauce. It is truly a slightly sweet, slightly savory blend of fantastic ingredients. I could eat it by the spoonful without hesitation. While it's great, as mentioned in a few lousy reviews, this is one of a number of items that induces a bit of heartburn. The fact is, though, that many of these homestyle recipes they use for stuffed peppers or tomato sauce don't pull any punches to make it mild or easier to eat. Some people should take Zantac, others don't need to. I love spice, and I've rarely had heartburn from Blasi's. My fiancee has had it a few times, but she also has a more sensitive stomach and takes something whenever she anticipates an issue in order to avoid it. This is reasonable, I'd say. You wouldn't rip an Indian restaurant because their curry was too spicy, right? Just how I see it, I guess.\\n\\nMy fiancee often orders the eggplant rollatini, and swears by it. it usually looks and smells amazing despite my dislike for eggplant. I tried it a while back and it was decent. It's served over spaghetti or penne.\\n\\nWe had the calamari appetizer again yesterday, as we had in the past, and it was great. Not the best ever, mind you, but great. We've had calamari twice already in the last week so it's hard to not compare. It was better than Remick's but not as good as Summer Shack. But damn near close. The breading was the best I've had on calamari in recent memory, but the texture was just shy of amazing. The tomato sauce served with it made up for that though, since I literally mopped up every drop of the stuff with the table bread!\\n\\nService is pretty lousy here but I tell a lot of friends that pick on this point that it's a matter of expectation. In many circumstances, including mine, this is a neighborhood place with a lot of regulars and I know a handful of staff. When you see your friends, they're going to run to the other customers but not feel stressed out to check on you, usually, knowing that you're not going to walk out or complain. It's not a great scenario, but I don't need a lot of attention. Legal Sea Foods or Top of the Hub, this is not. I won't need special silverware or hand towelettes... I just need my food and a non-empty drink. They seem to generally be on top of those.\\n\\nThe bar is usually mobbed with regulars, laborers and local blue-collar workers tossing back a few beers, keeping up on the Sox, Celts, Bruins and/or Pats. It makes it hard to get a beer without a wait sometimes... but it's nothing you don't run into elsewhere.\\n\\nAlso... the wings here are great. And there is a kids menu too!\\n\\nThere is ample on-street parking and there is a store lot across the street that is probably *technically* not for patrons of Blasi's and Fat Belly Deli but... I've never gotten a ticket.\\n\\nWe've taken a number of friends and family to Blasi's over the years, well over a dozen, and we've only had one guest have a problem. Her tuna melt was not hot enough so they re-made it quickly and she was pleased. On the other hand, I routinely get text messages and Facebook posts from a pair of cousins in Phoenix saying they want Fat Belly Deli or can I mail them a sandwich from Blasi's... so... that might speak for the quality of the deli sandwiches if nothing else!\\n\\nA great neighborhood spot. No frills, nothing fancy, no foie gras... just good sandwiches, accessible homestyle entrees (mostly Italian), and some standout sides and apps. Worth a visit for sure.

Quite disappointing, honestly. I expected it to be full of more sophisticated flavors than a normal cinnamon roll, but it was bland, bready with little moisture or carmelization, and a little unappetizing given that it was covered in a cold one-note glaze. You can get a better cinnamon roll from Cinnabon, and a way better cinnamon roll from Jodi Elliott of Foreign & Domestic fame (and soon to be of Bribery). I also tried the eggs benedict, which was even less satisfying. The egg wasn't poached well and burst like a volcano of slime into the Hollandaise, which made for a snotty mess. The ham, too, was overly fatty and cartilaginous. You can get much better at Counter Cafe or Hopfields.\\n\\nI know this doesn't sound like even a 3-star place, but that's because the late night fare is much better. You can get good beer here and decent snacks (the popcorn with peanuts, cinnamon, and cayenne is both off-puttingly strange and appealingly unique, and the white bean dip with duck fat and crostini is good, although not as succulent as it probably should be), but the entrees betray a quality kitchen. The rabbit & dumplings with tender cipollini onions is a gem, and the beef confit (not currently on the menu) was equally comforting and special.\\n\\nThere may be other things on the brunch menu worth trying, since they obviously have some talent, but you're far from guaranteed to walk away satisfied.

Service was quick and friendly and lunch was served after a reasonable wait. \\n  My half rack was as big as our waitress described, and would have been more food than I could eat in one sitting if I could eat it.  Unfortunately the ribs were cold.  Not room temp, but cold.  The one I ate was tender and juicy, excellently seasoned and as smoky as I could hope for, just stone cold.  The greens are quite different fron the usual smoky/salty.  They were steamed in apple cider, swimming in the stuff and tasting more of a sweet apple cider vinegar rather than  just cider with no smoke flavor, a very different taste that you might like, just don't expect the usual.\\n  I wish I could give them a better rating as they are close to home and reasonably priced, but I even sent the ribs back to the kitchen to be boxed to go so the chef could check the temperature himself, but no adjustment was made to the bill.\\n  In closing I would suggest that you try the take-out as you can heat it in the microwave at home."},{"name":"Hooligan's Sports Bar and Grill","address":"8220 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This new Sports Bar is a fun place to share a beer or two with friends.

It's not a one time unfortunate coincidence either.\\n\\nFirst of all, the staff have no idea how to properly wrap a burrito. By consequence, the burritos are tiny, or they just rip and fall apart. Worst of all, the staff don't seem to care. They look like they want to be somewhere else, and I don't even want to ask them to rewrap the burritos, or add a little bit more rice or cheese, because they evoke more pity then frustration. They just work really slowly like a chain gang, tossing the burritos around carelessly.\\n\\nThe last time I went there, they were out of white rice. Not just temporarily as in \\"hold on, it's coming in five minutes\\", but completely for the whole day. I have never had this happen in all the years I've been going to other chipotles. Also, their steak is perpetually overcooked, the rice tends to be undercooked.\\n\\nI don't know if this is a management problem, but this chipotle is very disappointing compared to other locations.

I made a reservation early in the week to ensure getting a good time and table. We got there a bit early, but we were greeted and seated right away. It took a little while for our waiter to come to our table, but it gave us a chance to look over the specials and drink menu. When it came time to order drinks I was surprised our server did not explain to us the specials or make any recommendations for their specialty drinks. We ordered some drinks and got the bone marrow to share as a starter. The bone marrow comes out looking amazing and the taste was top notch, only complaint is they do not give you enough bread for the size of the bones so we had to wait for more to finish the bones. For the main course we enjoy the crispy chicken thighs and pork chop special. The chicken was just as advertised, skin super crispy and the gravy it came with my delicious, I only wish there was more gravy. The pork chop special was very well balances and definitely the star of the night, extremely moist and flavorful and pairs with excellent prepared sweet potato mash. Overall, we were very pleased with all of the food we ate. The one thing I have to knock this place on is service. Our waiter seems to be a bit scattered throughout the meal, it would disappear for long periods, did not do a good job at explaining the menu and at the end we felt like we were rush out.

They sat us immediately when we walked through the door, unlike my past experiences in the north end when I had reservations.  The tables are close together but not too close.  You don't feel like someone is sitting in your lap.  I think you have to expect to be in close proximity to other people when you eat in that area.  The service was very speedy with drinks and food.  I got the halibut and my gf got the bolognese which was unbelievable (halibut was excellent too but the bolognese is on a different level).  I mentioned it was my gf's b-day when I made the reservation on open table and they brought us a little tart dessert that was spectacular.

My family and I decided to visit the North End prior to attending the Celtics game on Saturday, and we thought that this would be the perfect restaurant to kick off our fun filled night.  When we first arrived we utilized their valet parking service, which was a reasonable $25 charge...  We walked in and were greeted by a pleasant hostess, and were intrigued by the setup, which I could only describe as a homey atmosphere.  The hostess led us up a set of narrow stairs that lead to the second floor where we were seated.  The restaurant had dim lighting, and the seating was very tight, I would suggest that if you have issues with being close to others or are claustrophobic you may not want to visit this establishment.  The waitress came over to take our order, but before she did so, she let us know that she would prefer for us to only use 1 form of payment and not split up the bill because we were a part of 4 couples.  I looked at her puzzled, but was ok with it...  I wish I would have got her name, but I could only describe her as having a medium build, with very short blonde hair (boy cut).  While we were placing our order, I noticed that she was making sarcastic remarks about what we were ordering, but I just tried to ignore her.  Then at one point I found myself waiting for a camera crew to come out to let us know that we were being pranked, which clearly wasn't going to happen.  We proceed to place our order which included several appetizers, alcoholic beverages and entrees.  The appetizers were good especially the oysters and the duck; however, my entree was less to be desired.  I ordered the Bay Scallops Pasta; it was a very small portion, lacked flavor and had maybe 10 tiny scallops (which I'm being generous regarding the quantity).  An individual in my party ordered two bottles of wine for the table, when the second bottle came out the waitress asked him how it was, and he commented on it and she followed up with another unwarranted hostile snide remark.  At this point I was just disgusted, I couldn't believe that this lady was so disrespectful and rude.  But wait it gets better...  After dinner she asked if we wanted dessert and a person in my party said yes, but a few people in my party told  her that we shouldn't because the game was going to start within 20 minutes and we were going to be late, considering the valet takes between 10-15 minutes to retrieve your car.  However, she really wanted desert, I guess her indecisiveness irritated the waitress so much that she said \\"you know what I'll bring over the menu and you guys can decide what you want to do.\\"  Before she could leave a person from my party asked her if she had creme br√ªl√©e, and the waitress responded \\"French\\" and she said what does that mean and the waitress had the audacity to say \\"this is an Italian Restaurant and you are asking for a french desert.\\"  When she came back with the check the women from my party let the waitress know in a very matter of fact tone that her first time having creme br√ªl√©e was indeed in an Italian restaurant, in which the waitress replied \\"well we don't have it but I get what your saying\\", at this point I felt she was acting halfway decent because she knew it was tip time and our bill was close to $600.  If you ask me this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant, and I felt like we were pretty much robbed of good food and service.

Eric set up appetizers inside the house.  The appetizers are not available during the normal lunch service, but they were amazing, as well.  Our guests were particularly fond of the duck quesadillas, the Asian pears with blue cheese and the chicken buns.  \\n\\nFor the main course, people went out front of the house in small groups to order tacos and sliders off of the truck, just as during a normal lunch service.  We figured people would like the novelty, and boy were we right.  It was a huge hit, and everyone continued to rave about the food.  After getting the main course from the truck, people went back inside to get their side dishes.  We had a nice salad of mixed greens, nuts and fruit, a zucchini bake and a panko encrusted macaroni bake.  Everyone liked them all, but the macaroni bake was particularly amazing (and I don't normally rave about macaroni).  \\n\\nFor desert, we got the Peach Tortilla cobbler and the Peach Brownies.  The cobbler we good.  The Brownies?  Holy. Moly.\\n\\nI couldn't stop eating the brownies.\\n\\nI would definitely use the Peached Tortilla for a catered event again.  Even if you don't like the novelty that the truck may bring to your event... who cares?  They are worth it for the food alone.  If you don't have an upcoming event, find them on twitter and go try some tacos or sliders.  You won't be sorry."},{"name":"Toast of the Town","address":"348 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"4","text":"Went here twice with my hubby and son. Food was good and I love the service.

The bar itself is beautiful black and white granite (or marble, I haven't watched enough HGTV to differentiate easily) and is staffed by very friendly bartenders doling out cocktails that are my two favorite things:  generous and affordable.  There's no cocktail list yet, but the bartender mentioned the other night that one will be debuted shortly.

My 4 y/o was hungry so I took him to the food court expecting to eat some nasty mall pizza. Food court is mostly deserted now, pizza place wasn't even open. I guess a lot of the places there are only open on the weekend now.\\n\\nSo I pass by this place and the lady starts engaging me in conversation, she tells me they just opened right before christmas and that she makes Peruvian food from scratch with high quality ingredients. I ask for something on the mild side for my kiddo and she suggested a plate of rice and beans with stewed meat. I can't remember the name of the dish but it was also available on the spicier side with pork as the meat.\\n\\nSo a few minutes and $5.99 later we are both chowing down on some awesome homemade Peruvian food. I've only had this food a handful of times and didn't sample more dishes. This seemed comparable to better than what I've had before. I'm giving 5 stars for the combination of being very good food that was super cheap, in a very unlikely location, and my kid who lives on mac n cheese, pizza, & chicken nuggets ate it and loved it. \\n\\nI got the same dish to go to bring back home to the family and they loved it too.\\nThere's a side of hot sauce that is creamsicle orange and in the medium range that was very good.\\n\\nSo if you haven't been to Highland Mall in years I think this is a good reason to go. While you're there you can tour the suburban decay of the place and the interesting mix of stores that have opened to fill the place of the chains that every mall in America has. My favorite has to be the over the top  Quincea√±era and bridal store that has taken the place of Ann Taylor. It's way more fun than Ann Taylor ever was."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"888 SW 5th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We have been to the Yard House in Denver and Waikiki and went with a groupon to this Portland location we have been to several times before.

We sent them back and ate our sides which were delicious. But by the time the ribs came back out we were full so we took the now hot ribs to go to get cold again and heat up later.  The manager did come and offer a free dessert to go but unfortunately the creme brulee made me sick to my stomach which isn't normal occurance for me.

It's also situated near a host of other foodie delights, so it's a good idea to allow extra time to hit up spots like the East Village Bakery, Moccia Meats, etc.\\n\\nThis cozy street-diner dishes out comfort culinary creations that more often than not combine two crowd favourites into one satisfying dish. Hence the pulled pork buttermilk pancakes, or the occasional chili cheese omelette special, or the crispy pork belly sandwich, which is really the chef's take on a Vietnamese bahn mi.\\n\\nCertain protein preparations also cycle through different permutations as the day progresses. Hence the crispy pork belly and eggs in the morning and the crispy pork belly sandwich at lunch, or the pulled pork pancakes and the pulled pork sandwich.

Homestyle potatoes (usually made with a Yukon gold variety and livened up with some green onions) are perfect.\\n\\nCoffee is strong and flavorful, although the cups are tiny and the refills slow in coming. Actually, though friendly and attentive, service overall remains a bit slow, as others have noticed. There's often a backlog of people out the door -- or hovering inside the non-existent foyer on cold rainy days -- while vacated tables sit uncleared.\\n\\nThere needs to be a more organized system for the line-up, because it's awfully unwelcoming for diners, particularly new ones, to arrive not knowing whether there's a list being kept or not, while trying to remain civil and nonchalant as others march right up to the till at the back. Some more proactive seating strategies would help, too, as I saw a couple get seated at a table for four while a group of four behind them were waiting, just as a table for two cleared up... I think patrons would be more than understanding if they can see that the mental wheels are turning to calculate the most efficient way to seat everyone.

The few times I'd been, the portions were much smaller than at the other locations and the service was lackluster. Who wants to be fighting for your servers attention or shoved into a corner far away from all the other patrons simply because we weren't dressed like Buckhead elite? Considering Flying Biscuit should be a casual dining experience, I didn't realize I needed to be wearing my symphony best to eat here.\\n\\nStill, a gift card brought my boyfriend and I back here last night. In an unfortunate, rather obnoxious turn of events... THEY CLOSE AT FOUR. Four. What restaurant in the heart of Buckhead closes at four?! Apparently they told all the other restaurants that dinner in the Terminus building was a money waster. Funny because all the other spots - including Yogurberry - seem to be packed at night. Maybe it's the piss poor service and the terrible portions that were keeping guests from your restaurant at dinner time? Now the gift card is a waste because it can only be used Monday through Friday... and most of us have this thing called work that prevents us from snagging lunch 15 miles from where we work. Sorry.\\n\\nAt least they keep the place clean... 5 hours after closing, they were finally washing the tables. Whatever. Guess I won't be back since the gift card was the only reason I was coming by in the first place. If you really want to eat at Flying Biscuit, go to Candler Park first (original location) or try your luck at Midtown or the one on Northside Drive.

And I'm certainly glad that we did.\\n\\nThe hot chocolates at Aroa are very good, not spectacular, but very good.  It's not the shaved, melted chocolate like you get at Burdick, but it's certainly a good quality drink.  What WAS pretty spectacular was the variety of hot chocolates; milk, dark, white, and at least three variations of the \\"Mexican\\" spiced hot chocolate.  Mmmmm...\\n\\nI was even more impressed with their chocolates.  We did a tasting of about a half dozen of their chocolates.  The first three, the cinnamon caramel, Mexican vanilla, and champagne truffles were good, but what I would have expected.  But then we tried some more unusual chocolates: olive oil, lavender, basil.  ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! \\n\\nAs one Yelper cleverly pointed out, these are European, not Detroit chocolates - they're rather small.  However, they're so flavorful I've found that if you cut them into quarters and eat them one piece at a time, you'll get 4x the experience per piece of chocolate (it's also a great way to share).\\n\\nThis is exactly what I'll be doing at my next wine tasting - these chocolates would be perfect.\\n\\nAlso, a big thumbs up to the customer service at Aroa.

I have served in bistro-style restaurants before, and knew better than our server on dining etiquette. Our server brought our first appetizer out before bring any bread or drinks to us, and we watched as our drinks were made and sat at the counter at the bar for about 15-20 minutes before our server went and brought that to us. Throughout the night, we asked repeatedly for water refills, and they may refill one person's water, and not another. Our server was a young girl who really should have been trained better.\\n\\nNext, our main courses arrived and I was thoroughly unimpressed with mine. Partly, the menu had no descriptions of what each meal was, and I ordered the seafood linguine, and it wasn't what I expected. It was priced at $21 and I got a measly portion, with 3 shrimps (not prawns), and two squid pieces, in a cream sauce. Definitely, not worth $21. However, my family mostly enjoyed their foods (they went for lobsters and steak)\\n\\nLastly, what really killed my mood was the entertainer. I thought the singer that night was off-key and off tempo, and even fumbled on a few lyrics of a song. The music was loud and we were not even sitting next to her or any of the speakers. Then, music selection wise, she sang a couple of jazz standards which was great, but then switched to Disney music for a large portion of the night. This was Saturday night, supposedly the classiest night of all, in a somewhat self-branded \\"fine dining restaurant\\", Disney music has no place in there!

I had been to this one twice for drinks and was sold - the decor, the fireplace, the swankyness, the drinks - S.O.L.D.\\n\\nWe ended up doing the Sunday Supper, which is a Restaurant Week-style menu: Every Sunday night they feature \\"classic comfort food with a modern twist.\\" Each month celebrates a different regional fare and features a special three course, fixed price dinner menu. So it's $30/person for 3 courses, plus an optional $5 wine pairing (we got some Greek wine I'd never heard of that was fabulous).\\n\\nWe were there for Southwestern month.

He said it was the best chicken dish he has had in a long time and I have to agree. Everything on that plate was delicious.\\n\\nWe never rate dessert last, but the churros were nothing amazing. I had been planning on getting the Turtle Cheesecake, but since we went with the price-fix, this was our option.

Got there 1 hour before opening on Friday and I was about sixth in line. Early comers usually just hang around in an unorganized manner until an employee instructs you to get in line in the order you came. After the truck officially opened, we still had to wait about 30 min before we got to the front. Btw, there was free coors light for those waiting in line, if thats your thing. The employee at the front gave us a small sampler of the fatty end of a brisket and I nearly cried tears of joy when I tasted it.\\n\\nI got some brisket, a beef rib, and the pork sausage. There was a quarter inch deep smoke ring on the brisket. It was of course very tasty and juicy, but I liked the beef rib even more (because it had more fat). Both meats were crusted with a peppery blend of dry rub.  The sausage was pretty spicy and tasty, but not as stand out as the the other meat I had. On the picnic tables were a regular barbecue sauce and some sort of bbq style sweat and sour sauce (not the Chinese kind). If you like it saucy my opinion is to skip the regular sauce and go for the sweet and sour sauce which is more complimentary. Finally, I had the potato salad which had some horseradish in it, which was a nice compliment to the meal. \\n\\nOverall, if you are going for a pound of meat per person plus sides, you can expect to spend 25-30 per person. It's about 15-20 per person for a half pound of meat plus sides.

I could hear her say all the specials of the night to him. \\"something lasagna, something mushrooms, etc.\\" When she came to our table, my friend asked Tina if there were any specials. She rudely and surprisingly told us no. A firm no. No specials. Not for us. Upon hearing that, we said we needed more time to decide. Her response was, \\"Well, it's taking an hour to prepare entrees.\\" Well, Tina, you are really testing our buttons.\\n\\nShe comes around again and we give her our order. Fried Calamari, Spinach, Shrimp Cocktail for appetizers. \\n\\nThe table of one next to us gets his basket of bread and flavored olive oil.\\n\\nWe sit waiting... as I stare down Tina by the kitchen door just chatting away. Where is our bread... is this really happening to us right now? A good 15 minutes pass before we finally just get our bread basket.\\n\\nAppetizers were fine. Nothing special. Decent calamari. Oil drenched spinach. Bland Shrimp Cocktail.\\n\\nI ordered the Shrimp & Scallops pasta, which came with asparagus, broccoli, and some other veggies in garlic and oil sauce. All the vegetables were way overcooked. The asparagus had the consistency of a limp noodle. Disgusting. The whole dish lacked flavor. The giant plate of pasta was swimming in a pool of oil.

It's somewhere between \\"I've experienced better\\" and \\"ok.\\"\\n\\nI was seated in the back area near the window facing the street.  I think the staff's idea is that if people driving by on the street see people in the window, they'll attract more customers.  In my opinion, it's just the opposite.  They'd attract more customers by displaying occupancy in front of the building facing the parking lot and attracting consumers that are already shopping within the center.\\n\\nThe service was good and prompt.  I had water and silverware immediately and had my order taken within 3-5 minutes, although I was only the 2nd table.  I reviewed their lunch options and went for the chicken/cashew/pineapple stir-fry, an all-time favorite of mine.  For around $8 I was expecting a little more to be honest.  The portion was a little small compared to what I get elsewhere.  Also, there were only 7 cashews total on my plate.  (Yes, I counted them all).  When I order a chicken/cashew stir-fry, I want more than 7 cashews on my plate, and maybe a little garnish to make the plate POP a little bit.  Fortunately, I enjoyed the flavors of the dish's vegetables and chicken...I just wish there was more of it.\\n\\nOverall this place has potential to do very well.  They have to capitalize on their great location by sprucing up their food portions, presentation, and seating.  This would be a great spot to have some outdoor seating as well during the warmer months.  A few tables outside is a great way to attract more customers."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"888 SW 5th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to the Yard House for lunch with a colleague and was very impressed by the service and the food.

The prime rib was ordered medium rare, it was delivered almost raw.  Sent it back and it came back half the size but cooked.  Most of the meat was gristle or fat.  The baked potato was the smallest potato I've ever seen and dry as a bone.  The steamed vegetables were cold and partially cooked.  However, the service was excellent and I felt sorry for the wait people who were hearing complaints from other tables around us, a couple at the adjacent table was refusing to pay the dinner bill, don't know what they ordered but they were obviously as unsatisfied as we were.

Good charbroiled flavor, cooked to order, with an interesting sauce on the side (garlic mayo?). I only wish the kebabs had had more veggies, as they were dominated by onion more than anything else.

Not as tempting as a dish of preseasoned oil...\\n\\nPortions here lean towards the hearty end of the spectrum, which seems quite unusual these days, beginning with the appetizers, both of which arrived with well dressed greens and sweet fruit.  Grilled peaches in the Fig Burrata & Grilled Peaches, Bitter Greens, Chardonnay Vinaigrette $12 and seedless grapes in the Duck Confit Spring Roll, Arugula, grapes, red wine syrup $12.  The burrata was a less moist version than I've had before.  The twin fat spring rolls were stuffed full of the shredded dark meat fowl and little else.  The shells could have been crisper, but with a dip in the syrup, they were satisfying.\\n\\nThe Golden Rainbow Trout, shrimp and cornbread stuffing, prosciutto, buerre blanc $28, arrived as two stuffed pieces with crisp skin sandwiching a portion of peapod stems.  Seared Duck Breast, grilled balsamic radicchio, ricotta dumplings, peach compote $26 was tasty with a nice mix of flavors - both sweet and bitter.\\n\\nThe Flourless Chocolate Cake, Chantilly cream, Raspberry Sauce $8.50 was like a nice cool piece of fudge.  My dc ended up eating the greater share despite not being a chocoholic.  I liked both desserts, but preferred the hot crisp outer shell of the apple fritters with the soft insides with the caramel garnish and the sweet melting ice cream, and ended up with 2 of the 3 yummy fritters.\\n\\nOn a regular night at non-RW prices, 3 courses would be approximately $50 pre-tax and tip.  They seem to have a good business serving patrons of the nearby A.R.T. as the dining room quieted down by 7:30pm.  Also, our server had greeted us by asking if we were trying to make it to a show.  That was nice, although she neglected to tell us about the yummy sounding soup of the day that we overheard being described by another waitress to the tables in our vicinity.\\n\\nMy dc noted that the clientele seemed to lean towards the more mature crowd.  I looked around and was surprised to find myself in agreement.  A younger party arrived at 8pm to average it down.\\n\\nA comment about the location... from reading the other reviews, I realized that this is a basement establishment, but I hadn't memorized the number so I ended up strolling right past it.  Casablanca is located in the right hand side basement space of the red brick building labeled \\"Brattle Hall\\" which also houses Algiers on the more visible \\"ground floor\\" level, which itself is just up a short flight of stairs.\\n\\nRestrooms are located in the back, down a short hallway on the left.

I've grown to love the oft misunderstood brussel sprout in my mature years. Crisping them up and adding golden raisins into the mix for a sweet and savory taste was divine. The fritterers were, well, can fritters really ever be bad?!? These were quite unusual though. The inside was filled with oyster dirty rice from what I could tell.

The chicken was moist and tasty. Ribs were perfectly done, tender, and smokey. The brisket was delightfully tasty and perfectly fork friendly. The sauces were delicious - one was a green spicy salsa like concoction and the other was a classic molasses like BBQ sauce. We had Brussels sprouts and slaw both were delightful! Sprouts were perfectly done and the slaw had a creamy, lime based dressing which was perfect. I can't wait to go back.

So, we begin.\\n\\n(1) - Delivery time - Sometimes they run a little late but I've never received a 90 minute pizza nor have I ever received a 20 minute pizza.

He then leaned over the bar and asked \\"you sure you'll be able to finish this?\\"  While the noodles weren't as soft as I like and I wasn't a fan of the cream cheese the meatballs were masterful and the short rib literally fell from the bone. Excellent.

The indoor/outdoor setup is somehow both classy and laid back.  People were enjoying themselves and the hostess was very nice.  The fans and misters keep you comfortable even in triple digits.\\n\\nService:  Let me preface this by saying I worked in the Austin food service industry for about a decade.  I started out as a 16-year old busboy working weekends at a local Tex-Mex place and then worked as a waiter and bartender until I graduated from college.  I sympathize with waiters who often have to deal with the worst, most demanding examples of humanity.  So I always treat waiters with respect and also understand that waiters can have bad days.  But our waiter on Saturday evening was one of the rudest I've ever experienced.  And it was completely unprompted and unnecessary.  We were with a group of nine for a friend's birthday and naturally were arriving at different times.  We weren't intentionally trying to play \\"musical chairs\\" but with a group of friends who hadn't seen each other in a while, some of us changed seats for conversational purposes.  This completely flummoxed the waiter.  It's like we broke his circuit board or something he mentioned it so many times.  When some food came out to the wrong spot and two of us switched plates without mentioning it, he rudely said \\"It would have come out right if you hadn't switched seats\\" even though it wasn't a big deal.  When we asked if he could separate checks (by couples), he refused, adding in an annoyed tone that he would have been able to if we hadn't switched seats.  We were all at a little bit of a loss as to why some minor seat switching became such a glaring obsession for him.  Perhaps he was really bad at musical chairs as a child and has PTSD but I really hope he can learn to be more flexible and adaptable in the future since scolding negativity isn't a great personality trait for a waiter.  I suppose he had his pre-added 20% regardless so he didn't try too hard.  I'm not really sure.\\n\\nFood:  I have friends who rave about Contigo's food.  To be fair, some of their other stuff may be great, but if you want a good burger, avoid the $16 cheeseburger at Contigo.  The meat tasted unseasoned, was much too tall and therefore there was too much bun, and I know this is picky, but the patty had clearly been manipulated too much prior to cooking.  It was like a really fat preformed patty you'd buy frozen in bulk at Costco or Sam's.  The tomatoes were tasteless and overly firm and the pickles, which I assume were supposed to be \\"house made\\" looked and tasted more like cucumbers.  These ingredients might be acceptable on a cheaper burger, but at $16, a little nitpicking is appropriate.  Do yourself a favor and get 2 burgers for the same price at Phil's.  The atmosphere isn't quite as chic, but the flavor is far superior."},{"name":"Recreo Coffee & Roasterie","address":"1876 Centre St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"5","text":"Place smell wonderful.

It was just difficult to to stomach. The spare ribs were better, but overdone and dry on the inside. Had to smother it in the sauce from the squeeze bottles, but it didn't help much. The pork cheeks were charred on the outside, though tender on the inside. It had good texture, but the taste was disappointing - a combination of burnt surface and tasteless meat, which was somewhat surprising given how tender the inside actually was. The pulled pork was dry, overly salty, but not in a flavorful sort of way. It tasted like it was just cooked in brine, and then had the same brine sucked out of it to make it dry (possibly because of the baking with mac and cheese?).\\n\\nAs for the sides: mac and cheese was chunky rather than creamy. I could have made better from a box. The greens were overcooked, and as a result, had a bitter hint to it. We also got a side of broccoli with cheese on top.

They were clearly overwhelmed by the number of people and all the orders coming in. No ice cream for the shake I ordered. No seitan for the seitan loaf, so I ended up ordering the black bean Kendall burger with goat cheese; the idea was good, but in execution it fell apart - literally. They need to use something as a binder (egg, egg replacer, etc.) so that it holds together. The veggie burger should be something a veggie diner can nail, but at present, they need to do some re-working to make it more stable and burger-y. It's still tasted good, and the idea behind it was solid, but the burger's texture just wasn't right.\\n\\nThat being said, this is a place bursting with potential. It's kind of like if Friendly Toast were entirely veggie and had a more streamlined, less kitschy aesthetic, both for the restaurant itself as well as the menu.

The \\"regular\\" aka small fries could feed 20 (good, but excessive), and the onion rings are bland.  (Don't bother ordering ranch, either, there's no flavor in it, either.  Maybe it was diet?)  \\n\\nThere was a line everywhere we went, not just to order food, but at the bar, to get a seat and to use the bathroom.

First thing you notice is the gigantic beer-gardenesque space they have. Everything is very open. There are fans everywhere so you won't feel miserable. We chose to sit out of the sun (there is plenty of covered patio area too.\\n\\nThe service was wonderful. We were greeted and shown to our table by our hostess and then the menu was explained to us by someone else. I told him I was a veghead and he explained to me the specific veggie options as well. There were enough to keep this veghead satisfied. Thirdly our server came and took our order. The place was so busy, but we were always entertained by someone. That was quite impressive.\\n\\nWe ordered the Moscow Mueller which was perfect for that hot day. \\n\\nFor appetizers we got the crispy green beans, and the shishito peppers. Those came out promptly too. As I said earlier, really good and fast service.\\nThe crispy green beans were tempura fried with a spicy aioli on the side. The shishito peppers were sauted, with some sesame seeds, some salt, and a peanut sauce (i tasted some coconut in it too). Both were really tasty. The shishito's were the stand out item. The green beans were good too, but just nothing extra-ordinary.\\n\\nThe next thing we ordered was a small plate of the summer vegetables, with a carrot-lavendar sauce and some ricotta. Now this was mind-blasting. The sauce was probably one of the tastiest sauces I've ever had. The vegetables were just crispy enough and the pasta was perfectly cooked. Only downside to this dish, well I had nothing to wipe the sauce off that plate! Please serve it with some bread so I can wipe that plate clean!!!\\n\\nOur entree was the grilled cheese. We were told they would gladly add tomatoes to it, and so we did. Its cheese, tomatoes on brioche bread, grilled to a beautiful golden brown, served with a really delicious ailoi and some amazing fries! Again only downside to this was that the brioche is not a good base for the grilled cheese. Its too soft for it. It breaks easily and is too dense and cakey for a grilled cheese. I would suggest getting some sourdough bread (hint - easy tiger) and make it on that.

Texas Barbecue is like a soap opera.  I can't keep up with all the families splitting apart and which dearest kin have become sworn barbecue enemies, but I can tell you this.  The actual product - the barbecue - is generally excellent.  Thankfully, La Barbecue is not different in this regard.\\n\\nWhile quite a few people will recommend the short ribs, the brisket provides an almost identical flavor profile at a fraction of the cost.  And frankly, I prefer the brisket anyhow.  Whether your cut is long, tender strips of beef with a slightly pink ring and a most flavorful bark or deliciously soft globules of fat generously covered in rub, you are going to enjoy the result.  The key at La Barbecue is the rub which is the rub equivalent of Dreamland's BBQ sauce in tiny Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  More simply, it's the best rub I have ever had on brisket.  \\n\\nI'd probably pass on the pulled pork next time I come here (not to say that it isn't delicious, but rather to remark that you can find a more flavorful product in the Deep South).  However, the sausage links here are spicy and generously thick.  Order one, and you'll be glad you did.  \\n\\nWhile most of the sides are filler, the buttermilk bacon potato salad is simply outstanding and doubles as the perfect complement to your barbecue.  I'd recommend ordering a family size quart and taking whatever you don't finish home.  \\n\\nYes, there is a long line that you can largely bypass if you get here an hour or so before opening time.  Yes, there is a FREE BEER KEG on Saturdays and Sundays which is yet another reason you should probably try and get here early.  And yes, you aren't going to have to wait as long here as you would at Franklin's.  If those aren't enough reasons for you, just know that the brisket is intensely flavorful and I would likely walk a mile barefoot on 700 degree coals for La Barbecue brisket.

Our waitress, Chelsea, was nice and eager to please, but that's where the niceties ended.\\n\\nWe started our order with crispy-fried, cheesy risotto balls. The platter of 8 was portion pleasing, but left a certain creamy/smoothness to be desired.

The table felt crowded, but we didn't mind too much. The salad was adequate and just as expected, but wasn't given the appropriate time to appreciate, as our dinner orders arrived 3 minutes into our appetizer/salad/breadstick course. \\n\\nMy go-to dish at the OG has always been the Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo pasta. Unfortunately the dish served to me was not at all what I have grown accustomed to...there was so much spinach added to the dish it appeared green-grey in color, and my \\"medium-rare\\" steak medallions arrived well-done. The gorgonzola was absent, and in it's place was a over-abundance of pickled sun-dried tomatoes.

The ravioli was over cooked had a fishy aftertaste. The shrimp scampi fritta was acidic, and the \\"creamy shrimp alfredo\\" wasn't properly saturated with sauce (which had been reheated to the point of separating/curdling).\\n\\nOverall, it was our worst experience at an Olive Garden ever.

So we finally got to order our drinks and just as our bartender was about to pour the drinks, the inside bartender (who now has 2 people at his side of the bar) tells her that he needs napkins.

Lighting was appropriate for date night, small group networking or business meeting. Slightly dimmer lighting could make each table and space seem more private and intimate. \\n\\nFood- ordered the spinach & ricotta tortelli and the bucatini all'amatriciana. The bucatini texture was excellent and taste was flavorful. A bit on the sweet side most likely from the tomatoes or puree in the sauce but a pleasant taste. The tortelli on the otherhand was disappointing. The presentation was one left to be desired and too much truffle oil overpowered the taste and the aftertaste wasn't the most pleasant. Maybe more of an acquired taste. Ordered a coffee and chocolate dessert. Coffee was bitter, watery and couldn't drink more than a sip and the dessert was also generic and would not recommend either.\\n\\nService- was extremely slow and unattentive.

I researched the North End and was basically making my decision based on a few things. Open for lunch, good reviews and the availability of Gluten Free pasta since my daughter and I cannot consume wheat. \\nWhen we arrived for our reservation at 1:30 I asked the head waitress to be sure they had the gluten free pasta. She confirmed, so our party of 7 was seated. \\nWe started with appetizers and some wine to get us going. After about 40 minutes, we put the meal orders in and again specified the gluten free options, no problem.\\nSo after about 45 minutes of waiting for the meals and noticing that everyone else around us was getting their food even though we were there prior, I inquired about the meals. They informed us that there was no gluten free pasta and we would have to do without. \\nAt this point, we were pretty much stuck since we have been there for about an hour and a half and the other meals were ready. So we had to do without any GF pasta. When I expressed my disappointment, they were rather abrupt and rude, like it or lump it kind of thing. There was not attempt to make things right or accommodate us.\\nAll that being said, the food here judging by the rest of the party's comments is not really that good. I think their main thing is to make money off of hungry tourists that think they are getting authentic Italian food. They are not, the quality is not that good. The person across from me got some kind of linguini sitting in about a cup of oil at the bottom of the dish. The antipasto which was supposed to have prosciutto had a very poor quality prosciutto that basically could have been passed off as boiled ham.\\nOur waiter was brand new and receiving very little help from anyone.

Other reviewers who've been there multiple times and comment on a lack of consistency are pretty much spot on.\\n\\nThe concept is good. The menu items and the ingredients are good too. If it was consistent, it would be worth $15 for burger+fries if only because this place is open until 11pm. \\n\\nThe owner of this place, at least one of them, is a pleasant lady. I met her in person, we had a lovely conversation, and she was very attentive to feedback.\\n\\nHowever, the owner needs to find trustworthy employees to make and keep this place awesome. \\n\\nThe service upfront was terrible the last couple of times I was there. I was treated as if the folks upfront were giving me a favor by ringing me up. I paid $18 for a burger and eggplant fries at a takeout place, so at least give me service that I could expect from somewhere like Chipotle, where I pay $8. Compared to Cobblestone service, Chipotle is a Micheline Star restaurant, at least based on my latest experience at Cobblestone. No smile at any point and visible frustration when I asked questions about the ingredients, cold look and silence when I thanked them and said the food was really good (it was good that one time).\\n\\nCooking is a hit or miss too. Mostly miss - 4 out of 5 times. Last time I was there (tonight 3/10), The sweet potato fries were literally burnt. I mean, literally. I don't know how you see the fries come out this way and decide it's OK to give them to the customer. Some fries were edible, but had blackened outside and probably really bad for you, others were complete charcoal due to their smaller size (black through the middle). On top of that, the burger that was supposed to be medium-rare was medium-well to well done. I've considered returning it, but I was so hungry when I got home that instead I ate the half of the order that wasn't going to get me hospitalized in the short-term and threw the charcoal pieces away. Charcoal pieces that made up half could have been delicious sweet potato fries in my belly if the staff took pride in their work.\\n\\nI really hope this place improves, because I really like the concept, the menu items, and the fact that it's open later for occasional nights when I stumble back from work after 10pm.

In general, I found their marinara sauce to be pretty good.

I didn't really feel like I was eating food that I couldn't have made at home, and I'm not even Italian. Again, it's not bad. It's just a LOT of average food. I ate the chicken parm, shrimp with linguine, and \\"Little Al's favorite,\\" which was gnocchi, broccoli, and chicken with a pink sauce. Best pasta was the gnocchi. The breading on the chicken in both dishes was pretty useless and unnecessary. \\n\\nService was slow.

El Matador is a typical Tex-Mex restaurant that serves pretty good food and consistently. \\n\\nThe restaurant is located on Pleasantdale and Chamblee-Tucker RD in Tucker. The interior is fairly large with booth seats along the wall, a bar in the center of the restaurant and an outdoor seating area facing beautiful and scenic Pleasantdale RD. It can be somewhat crowded during the evening on weekends, but I have yet had to actually wait for a seat. \\n\\nThe food and drinks are fairly typical for Tex-Mex. That means that if you're like me, you'll enjoy them. If you're looking for something a bit more authentic, or fancy-schmancy margaritas, I do believe you may be disappointed. But, the tacos are good. The chimichangas are good. The Pollo Chipotle is good, served with a nice and spicy sauce. I asked what it was called, and I thought I heard \\"mada vida.\\" But, that doesn't turn up anything useful on Google, so I think I may have misheard it. \\n\\nEl Matador seems to be fairly family oriented. During the weekends there always seems to be little kids running about while their parents have a few drinks and unwind. On Sunday nights there is a singer who plays the sort of basic, non-offensive music that nearly anyone can digest. I cannot fairly call it one of my favorite Tex-Mex places in the area, but it's close, it's convenient, I get a lot of food and it's the same each time. Sometimes that's all I ask for and all that I need.

Roasted poblanos, tender-roasted pork with a few jalapenos and lots of fresh cilantro sprinkled in. With their corn tortillas, it's just right. I got a Veracruz side salad, too.

Maybe Monday nights in Austin are generally not busy nights for restaurants? The 10 pm closing time threw me for sure.

He kindly brought us out complimentary champagne since it was my friends bday. Little gestures like this always help bring me back to restaurants. \\n\\nThe food was very good. Between us we ordered the deviled eggs, the brussel sprouts, the caesar salad, the grilled cheese, the fried avocado stuffed with bbq beef, and the cauliflower casserole. All of the food is definitely heavy. This is not where you go if you want to feel like you just downed a healthy meal by any means. My friends did comment that the food was salty and they felt like their fingers were swelling from the sodium, but I didn't have the same issue with the food. \\n\\nThe only con I have regarding the food is the portion size. Everything is pretty large and even if you are sharing with other people it's a lot of food. You could easily go here, order two items, three tops and share between two people and be satisfied. The grilled cheese is massive and seems more apt for a large man to consume. Would have appreciated a heads up on just how large it was especially since it comes served with a ton of fries. Two people could have just ordered that one item and been full. We wanted to get dessert initially, but we were so full by the end that there was no chance of that. \\n\\nAlso, having been seated inside and outside here, if the weather allows, I'd pick outside every time.

The cue is nearly as good as Franklin but doesn't quite \\"melt in your mouth\\" in the same way.

I would say if you have more time or you get shut out at Franklin make sure you get to la Barbecue. \\n\\nAgain, we tasted the brisket and ribs. The brisket had a very nice bark on it, great smokey taste and a nice smoke ring. The meat held together well but was tender enough to cut with a fork. The pork rib meat was cooked to perfection - again staying on the bone but coming off clean when bitten into.

They range from pickled spicy cucumbers, to sweet mashed potatoes, sweet & spicy dried squid, seaweed salad, etc. My go-to appetizers have been the Spicy Squid (a top choice here), Kimchi Pajun (Kimchi pancake), or Tteokbokki (rice cake in sweet chili sauce).\\n\\nThe lunch specials are great since I'm a big fan of the fried rice that you can get instead of the white rice. It's so good it reminds me of my mother's fried rice. You can't go wrong with ordering the bento box with chicken or Kalbi (marinated short ribs). Both are bursting with flavors and offers a salad with a light ginger dressing, and kimchi and beansprout salad.\\n\\nWhat I love most about Shin Jung is their soups. The Spicy Kalbi Tang is my all time favorite choice. It's made of short ribs in a spicy rich savory beef broth with clear noodles, green onions, and egg. Total comfort food. My second favorite is the seafood soondubu. It's also a spicy broth with silken tofu and plenty of seafood in the mix. They have different and distinct tastes but both are equally addictive.\\n\\nI've also tried their Bibimbab which you can't go wrong getting it hot in the stone pot or cold in the steel bowl. I like to put a lot of the sweet hot chili sauce that comes on the table when mixing up the bulgogi in white rice with all the vegetables and egg. It's such a simple entree but it fills you up.\\n\\nI could go down the list of all the wonderful entrees on the menu but this would end up too long for anyone to read. I'd have to say, whether you choose to go with a group of friends to cook the kalbi, bulgogi, chicken or pork belly over the grill or dine with co-workers for a quick lunch, you'll enjoy the experience.\\n\\nEven though this is one of my favorite Korean restaurants around, I come back time and time again for the friendly staff that I've gotten to know over the years. They make every experience a memorable one with their attentiveness and personality. If I were to move out of state again, I'd still return to this restaurant the first chance I get when I'm back in town. That's saying a lot about this place. I highly recommend giving it a try!"},{"name":"Jade Sushi & New Asian","address":"2425 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Because Iooking for the ramen, then been here, it so good, clean environment and good service!

It was a rare, summer-like day and all the restaurants had their doors and windows open to the street. As we strolled down Hanover Street, passing by Ristorante Damiano, I noticed a front-row table in the small but crowded restaurant had just been vacated, and luckily, there were no parties waiting. My instincts told me to stop right there and I said \\"This is where we are eating.\\" Within a minute the waitress had bussed our table and we were seated  overlooking the street. The waitress politely informed us that we had to order from the Sunday brunch menu, which offered a limited selection including frittatas, salads, panini sandwiches, pasta, risotto, entrees -- plenty of choices to satisfy our varying tastes and appetites. My daughter and her friend ordered chicken and cheese panini sandwiches -- large, crunchy concoctions served with generously-portioned mesclun salads. The girls did not leave a morsel on their plates. My husband ordered the spicy Fra Diavolo Calamari with risotto, which he devoured with enthusiasm commenting about it being creamy and perfectly spiced. I ordered the beet salad with greens, goat cheese and pine nuts and the fried calamari appetizer. The salad was composed of mandoline-thin beet slices in a light vinaigrette under a bed of field greens with small bits of goat cheese and a sprinkling of pine nuts. This healthy salad was very light and tasty, but not filling-enough to stand alone as a meal. I was glad to have ordered the appetizer of delectable fried calamari, which was very light, melt-in-your mouth perfection enhanced by a spicy blend of capers and tiny bits of red bell peppers. We limited our drinks on this hot day to bottles of refreshing San Pellegrino sparkling water with lemon slices. The meal for 4 totalled about $80. It was a very relaxing experience punctuated by the warm breeze and people strolling the side walk by our table. As we were finishing the meal, we had no idea that we were about to be entertained by the city of Boston's Columbus Day Parade and we had front row seats! This was a complete  surprise and it added a fun dimension to our lunch that we had not planned. When we finished our meal, we were not rushed to pay and vacate the table. All diners were allowed to linger and watch the parade from their tables without feeling pressured to leave. That attitude alone deserves five stars."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I generally love this place!! Especially for happy hour.

It is enough to fill you up as an entree. It is rich, creamy and with a great mushroom / truffle flavor.

It can be a little pricey for some items though it's not that bad for most.  What I can't stand, because it catches me off guard, is the fact that they don't take credit/debit.  I know this is silly and they have an ATM (for a high fee, obviously) but I'm one of those believers in being able to use my card at any business that expects my business off the street.  Again, that may be just me.  \\n\\nMy fiance and her sister are vegetarians and they absolutely love the tofu.  They always comment on the fact that it is very well seasoned.  I love their crispy chicken.  I usually get it in a curry-like sauce which is delicious and a little spicy.  I like spicy Chinese/Thai food (I lived in Hong Kong for a couple years) and they have it down.  However, I recently ordered the \\"Spicy Crispy Chicken\\" and was steaming from my mouth.  It's a simple dish with chicken, jalapenos, bell peppers, and basil sauce.  The chicken itself is super flavorful, but the peppers steeped into the sauce/rice and set me on fire for a while.  I must have gone through about half of their cooler of complementary water, but I finished the whole thing.  If you like spice then I say go for it.\\n\\nThe space itself is ok.  they have couches set up, which is awkward to me.  It usually means there's a couple sitting at a table meant for 6-8 and it's crowded elsewhere.  Also, this place can be cheap and leave the A/C off in the summer which is rough enough but gets even worse when you're eating that spicy chicken.  They also have outdoor seating, for those who want it.  Only one bathroom and it's clean-ish.  Don't expect much ambiance, but why would you from a little restaurant like this.  You'll like it, but be sure to take your cash.\\n\\nThe staff isn't friendly, and they can be impatient when you're looking at the menu, but that seems to be the standard at similar Asian eateries.\\n\\nI give it four stars because of the space and the cash only.

Here's an idea - the place is called Pho Green Papaya - ever think of adding some green papaya to the spring role?  Not crazy - my friend from Cambodia does this all the time.\\nHonestly, it was a very bad value and I was happy to leave.  There is absolutely no reason to buy these items there.  Maybe try the curries, although they are not the best thing for your arteries!  You can make pho yourself easy enough, and fresh spring roles are not that difficult after a few tries.  With the ingredients prepared, you can assemble good tasting rolls in 30 seconds.  The only reason I stopped in was because I was shopping across the street at Sheridan Fruit and thought why not.  My mistake.  And I'm not new to SE Asian food."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Salty Sow did not disappoint.

Not that the wait was going to be more that 10-15 minutes, but we like to sit at the bar too. \\n\\nWe had a very good ravioli starter. They were large and the cheese filling was fluffy, light and had lots of flavor. I should also mention that the bread is maybe the best I have ever had. I ordered the ribs and mashed potato. They were a huge rack and the meat was indeed very soft and tender. It did fall of the bone. But most importantly, I am always a little hesitant to order ribs because they are often very fatty and kind slimy inside. This was definitely NOT the case here. The ribs were very meaty and lean. The sauce is outstanding and permeated the meat just enough to render full flavor. The mashed was very good too. \\n\\nMy wife had a chicken and pasta dish that was very good. Perhaps a little over-sauced, but not bad in any way. \\n\\nI cannot wait to get back to Floramos. I would encourage anyone to give it a try.

The Brisket taco had a jalapeno slaw and a smoky roasted peach BBQ sauce. I really liked this taco... the meat was tender and I enjoyed the slaw which added a nice crunch to the taco. I had no idea it had a peach BBQ sauce on it because the slaw overpowered that flavor. I would have liked to taste a little more of the BBQ but I still really enjoyed the taco.\\n\\nThe Banh Mi slider was served on a sweet Hawaiian roll, with a Vietnamese braised pork belly, pickled daikon and carrot salad, sriracha may and cilantro.

In a restaurant, inconsistency is worse than being really bad. At least with the really bad places, you know not to go there.\\n\\nRosa Mexicano is a tease: one day it's great and the next you're embarrassed that you brought your friends. \\n\\nThe first time I went, I stumbled on it after visiting the ICA, which is almost across the street. I was charmed by the margaritas, the bar bites, and the service. Because of that first experience, I've gone back more times than I should have. It's like a bad boyfriend: he had a flash of good and you keep hoping to see it again.\\n\\nOn a raw cold rainy Thursday in March, I visited the ICA again for the Walid Raad show (excellent!) and thought to myself, Is it worth the walk to Rosa Mexicano for one of those margaritas and maybe a flauta or enchilada? The thought was so enticing that I forgot that Rosa Mexicano often closes down for private parties without warning or option or apology. When I got there, the bar was bustling with people, but that's not a surprise in Boston at 7 p.m. on a Thursday night. I found a seat and asked for a drink. The bartender started to get me a drink and then asked if I was part of the group. What group? Turns out, I'd stumbled into YET ANOTHER private party. The bar was closed to paying customers. No sign, not that a sign makes up for walking through bitter spitting rain and being denied service because, well, Rosa Mexicana closes randomly.\\n\\nIt's not like it was out of their control, like a burst pipe or a C from the health inspector.... Next thing you know, they'll be doing trivia or karaoke. (NOOOOO!) \\n\\nRosa Mexicana doesn't have a regular crowd or client base. They can't with the way they close down randomly. But the problem is larger than random closings. And there's no guarantee that calling ahead will remedy the problem. On New Year's Eve 2016, a few of us were going to a party at a condo not far from the seaport and wanted to grab a bite ahead of time. I thought of Rosa Mexicana -- ugh! kicking myself -- but because it was a holiday, and because they advertised a prix fixe menu for the evening, and because they've been inconsistent in the past, I called ahead to find out if the bar would be open and if we could get a drink off the regular bar menu and maybe an app. \\"Yes, absolutely\\" was the answer. Because two of our group have gluten allergies, I also asked about gluten free offerings for that night. (Note: they *say* they cater to gluten allergies.) I was assured that we could take advantage of both the bar-bite menu and the gluten-free offerings. As you've probably guessed, neither were available. After a fuss, we were able to cobble together a reasonable meal, but our options were limited and we had to fuss to get what we got. Who wants to argue with servers or management on New Year's Eve? We wanted a relaxing drink and some apps. \\n\\nAnother time, a friend and I stopped at Rosa to watch Thursday night NFL football. We were pleased to find that the bar wasn't very crowded -- maybe two other customers -- and so placed ourselves in front of one of the two televisions, the one that was already showing NFL football. We ordered expensive drinks -- about $15 each -- and were about to order food when a woman sat down near us. Not long later, the channel of the television we were watching changed. Stunned, we asked the bartender to turn it back to football. He refused. As did management. The woman who arrived after we did wanted to watch something else and that was that. No compromise. No \\"are you watching this?\\" Just an f-u to us as customers.\\n\\nThat seems to be the theme. When they feel like offering good service, they do. It's as random as the MBTA, and I'm intentionally evoking a poorly run operation, one that gives a bad feeling.\\n\\nTwo stars because I like the margaritas, the flautas, the guac; minus a zillion stars because management."},{"name":"HunnyMilk","address":"40 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Fabulous place for Sat or Sun Brunch! $20 for a 1 savory item, one sweet, and one drink.

(Their three-part brunch offering) It had better be good. My second reaction: if you've had a birthday within three months of entering the place, expect to celebrate another before your food arrives. (Playing with crayons or other odd bits before eating neither occupies my mind nor soothes my appetite.) In apparent acknowledgment of the long wait, I was presented with a version of a \\"donut hole\\" (a small, deep-fried ball of sweet dough with an very sweet whipped-cream--or something like it. I suppose some breakfasters enjoy cloying sweets before what they anticipate to be a savory breakfast; it seemed like a bad fit to me: a strip of bacon or its vegetarian equivalent would have been better).\\n\\nOK, so the food arrived: first 1/3: a glass of orange juice, of no remarkable size or flavor that might justify a unified cost of twenty bucks. The juice was nearly gone by the time the small metal baking pan arrived with a baked-egg dish with asparagus bits, fried potatoes, and a hollandaise sauce; and, alongside, my choice of the least sweet option to round out the three-choices: a waffle (could have been carrot) with more of the aforementioned flavored whipped-cream-like topping. \\n\\nThe \\"dessert\\" was far too sweet--not merely the topping, but the waffle, almost candy-stiff with sugar, was a bad finish to the meal. Like the O.J., the waffle offered neither art nor flavor that might justify the price of the brunch. That aside, there was the main dish: the egg, cooked to semi-hardness, was buried under the potatoes and some asparagus tips, and all was visibly unidentifiable under a slather of sauce. The dish was more memorable as a puzzle than it was as a composition. The primary reason for the delay seemed to have been bad planning; and for the dish's shortcomings, bad prep.\\n\\nThe potatoes were dry, and probably were overcooked (left in the oven or on the griddle too long?), when they should have been par-cooked earlier and finished in minutes before serving. And, it was a poor choice to bury the eggs beneath them and make consumption of the potatoes a compulsory \\"first,\\" especially when the tiny dish offered nowhere to put them aside, except, perhaps, on the metal pan, which was more like a cafeteria tray than a plate. \\n\\nBaking eggs takes time, and in this case was pointless, as poaching them would have yielded equal or better results in less time. The asparagus were prepared separately, and not with the other ingredients, so there was no particular interesting blend of flavors. And then, the sea of sauce made finding and choosing from the small dish distractingly difficult: one goes to eat one's food--not to untangle and identify it first.\\n\\nMaybe someone imagined some charm to the presentation; but it didn't contribute to flavor or accessibility. The food would have been better presented on a plate, which would have offered a diner a clear choice of how and what to eat, in her or his preferred order. The three-part menu does not offer a diner a savory path through brunch; all third choices are sweet, and didn't seem well thought-out. I'd suggest that diners investigate what can be had (and offered) a la carte: and that Hunnymilk pay more attention to culinary composition, and to offering better value--and far less sugar--for the price."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing burgers, decent price; but come on, we are really all here for the fresh pie shakes.

When the water was brought to me then he took my order. So far first 15 minutes of my experience here basically set the stage for the entire meal. \\n\\nI ordered the Sonny's Sampler $14.99 and a water. Food came out within 5 minutes. Food was cold but to describe it was tad bit over room temperature and they had the A/C blasting. Though the food looked appetizing sure wasn't the food I've had at Sonny's in the past. It's was below restaurant quality in my opinion. Chicken was dry and bland. Cornbread wasn't bad but it was cold. Ribs were okay need some more seasoning. The brisket was the best thing on the plate and the pulled pork was dry but flavorful. \\n\\nI wouldn't come here again and being a business traveler I probably refrain from ever going to Sonny's again except the location in St Petersburg Fl. \\n\\nI do not recommend this location and the not so good reviews are true. I hope management works on the customer service here and atleast get to the basic food quality Sonny's was known for.

If you trust the reviews, this joint is the best food in all of Portland (even when compared to the likes of Screen Door and Le Pigeon). I have to say I'm inclined to believe the hype, but at the same time I have to set the record straight. This is not the best restaurant in Portland.\\n\\nBut are they the best Mauritian food in Portland? Are they the best African food in Portland? Might they even be the best food cart in Portland? I'm inclined to say yes.\\n\\nChez Dodo is probably the only place to get authentic Mauritian cuisine in Oregon. Mauritius is the island off the coast of Africa that the dodo bird was native to prior to being hunted to extinction (hence the cart's name). The cuisine is a nice mix between Indian, African, and European influences.\\n\\nShayam's giant \\"Shayamosas\\" make a great appetizer, but make sure you have at least one other hungry mouth to share it with. The entrees are generous. Strike that. Entrees are GIGANTIC. For $7-9, you get a ridiculous, delicious pile of pan fried noodles or rice and meat or veggies.\\n\\nCurrently, it seems like Chez Dodo isn't equipped to handle the demand for their product.

In the past we've always been happy and actually my mother and grandmother had just been there a few days before! Maybe the weekend staff is different?? Ordered the usual pizza and it came out as a very average pie. Nothing like the identical pizza ordered earlier that week. Ordered our favorite salad with house dressing. Came out with less toppings than usual and our favorite dressing nowhere to be found. All five of us agreed it was totally different. It was simply covered in bland cheap oil with a splash of vinegar. No seasoning. Literally none.  I asked the server about the dressing being different and was told it's the same as always and wasn't offered any way to correct the issue such as an alternative dressing. Strike two. Got 2 ten piece ordered of wings. Both were cooked only enough to be considered safe to eat. Very soggy and fatty and no flavor to the sauce. All salt and grease. Again we had a party of 5 and each of us who tried the first flavor agreed they were nasty. Two of my kids had regrettably placed 2 on their little plate but only ate the one because it was so bad. My mom and I then checked the flavor of the other wings which were just as bad and flagged down the waitress to tell her. She argues with me that they're baked not fried and therefore won't be crispy, well that's just how they are, they look done etc etc. After seeing that she wasn't going to argue me into submission she asked how many we had left?? \\"Um well we all tried one of this flavor so there's a couple left and I dunno my daughters have one on her plate still because after eating one we didn't want the rest so....um the other flavor my mom and I tried one each to see how those were so there's 8 there....\\" I was kind of confused at the question and she takes the plates and goes back to the kitchen for a while. She then avoids our table for a bit even though we clearly needed refills on drinks (I had asked for more water when I told her about the wings anyways) and had just had about half of our meal removed inedible from the table. She never brought the , never brought new wings, never asked us if we wanted something else in place of it etc. After about 15 minutes She brings us our check and a box for the remaining pizza, tells us she took off the wings we had left that we didn't eat. But only the mostly remaining flavor. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I didn't realize we needed an inspector for each thing brought to the table so out of a ten piece wings with five people at the table I guess that's what was supposed to happen. Didn't expect to have to inventory the items ordered to satisfy a rude server either, my apologies. Worst food and service I've had in a very long time anywhere. Doubly disappointed at this coming from what used to be one of our favorite places too.

In less than 3 minutes at the table with a nice warm fire - great so far.\\nNothing from the by-the-glass wines jumped out at us so we decided to splurge and get a bottle. We ordered the 2010 Stags Leap Artemis Cab while we perused the menu. A few minutes later the bartender/sommelier delivers a bottle but it's a 2011 which I very politely mention is different from the wine list and she replies \\"Oh, you want the 2010?\\" Yes, please. After 4 or 5 minutes she comes back saying \\"we only have the 2011 but it's not our fault, our distributor just delivers us whatever they want.\\"\\nNote: there is ~$10 retail difference between the 2010 and 2011 - the wines are not interchangeable and they should know this.\\nAnyway, we opt for a 2010 Castello Di Neive Barbaresco instead, thinking an Italian might be a better choice anyway. Apparently knowing we will check the label, we see the somm scaling the wine storage wall behind the bar, looking at bottles of wine. Voila - the 2010 Castello arrives. When she opens it, the wine is tawny brown and the odor slightly 'hot' (high alcohol). When we ask the somm if the wine is supposed to be this color, she simply raises her eyebrows and shrugs. At this point we just keep the wine and move on...We should have kept the 2011 Stags Leap!\\n\\nNow to order dinner...\\nThey offer two special salads - one with bib lettuce, blue cheese, walnuts and pears - this turns out to be the highlight dish of the evening. The other, described as chopped tomatoes, cukes and feta (no lettuce) sounds like the salads we have enjoyed in Europe many times and I jumped at it, even though our waitress mentioned that it comes formed in a ring. Unfortunately the tiny pieces of tomato and cuke made up maybe 10-20% of the 'salad' the rest was feta, smashed into a circular mold. Not refreshing or lite at all, just a ring of cheese. Oh well.\\n\\nFor entrees, my wife choose (and I quote from the menu) the \\"POLLO SALTIMBOCCA - Chicken breast with prosciutto & Fontina, in a fresh sage Marsala wine sauce, house style mashed potatoes saut√©ed with green beans.\\" When this dish arrived, the sauce that covered the two chicken breasts looked like a broken white sauce; creamy in color but curdled looking. We asked if this was really the right dish as she was expecting Marsala wine sauce and the waitress said \\"yes, it's white because of the cheese in the sauce.\\" Apparently that's where the fontina went. While the sauce looked very strange and unappetizing, the flavor was actually okay. As for the potatoes, they were some strange scallopini type preparation and the green beans looked like they may have been prepared hours ago (completely soggy).\\n\\nI unfortunately chose the \\"INVOLTINO DI VITELLO - Veal stuffed with sliced prosciutto, spinach and scamorza cheese finished with a wild mushroom Madeira sauce.\\" After seeing my wife's dish I thought I had picked the winner. Mine looked good but the veal medallions tasted of vinegar. My suspicion is that they were old but the sauce and grilled potatoes/veggies were actually quite tasty. I did peel apart and eat some of the veal, removing the prosciutto which turned out to be the source of the rancid odor, but later regretted that; spending the next hour hoping to keep it down.\\n\\nAll-in-all a sad fall from grace for one of our former go-to restaurants.\\nI've never said this before but Trattoria San Pietro might benefit from one of those restaurant reality shows where they come in, revamp the place and re-do the menu.

It's a sterile, concrete-filled neighborhood in which no one lives, so there's not much going on.\\n\\nAs a result, this bar doesn't have much competition, but you should still steer clear if you can. The serving staff isn't too knowledgeable about drinks. One of my friends ordered an old-fashioned, which is one of the oldest and simplest cocktails around, and the server didn't know how to make it. In addition, the drinks are pricey!

We arrived about 10:35, a decent line already formed and waited nearly 2 hours before we had our bag of food. In the shade, with the frequently mentioned free Lone Star and nice people to talk with, it was not really that bad.\\n\\nWe had plenty of time to ponder our order so when we got up front here was the final decision (for two people - planning to have leftovers): 1 pound brisket, 1 beef rib, 1 pulled pork sandwich, single servings of cole slaw and potato salad. Also either we ordered it on accident or the guys are super awesome and threw in an additional pork rib for free. \\n\\nIt would not surprise me had they thrown it in because everyone we dealt with from the girl serving beer to the guy cutting meat were extremely nice. Makes it so much easier to support a place when everyone is pleasant to deal with. \\n\\nAs for the final results; the brisket was first up and GD was it good. We got more than we could eat so we could have leftovers and do other wonderful things with it (like tacos). It was so unreal tender and juicy and the crust is excellent.\\n\\nFor the pulled pork, the choice for the wife, she was in heaven. I believe a few others have mentioned that its refreshing to see a BBQ place do pulled pork so well. \\n\\nAs for the two ribs, we've never seen anything like the beef rib. We know its a staple amongst other BBQ joints around the state but this was our first experience with a truly excellent one and it lived up to the hype. It does seem costly ($20++/rib) for what you end up getting but some of the bites we took were just amazing. The pork rib though smaller was also bursting with flavor and was extremely tender as well.\\n\\nThe verdict: The wife is sold on the brisket being better than Franklin and I think i'm convinced too. The rib is awesome and worth the try, just know they aren't cheap. Loved the pulled pork as mentioned and would recommend that to any and all pork fans."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came to Austin to visit my best friend, and to eat BBQ too!

It was several steps above anything I've had. I wish I would have ordered more. Brisket was amazing and turkey was great but next time I'm going straight brisket and pulled pork! I'm not a big rib person so I didn't try them. The sausage was good, just spicy at all heck. I actually had to save that to the end of my meal because the spice was so overpowering.

What started as a promising new and locally sourcing place for food and drink has sadly devolved into another overhyped and poorly run locus for the misguided foodie elite and spectacle. The food was mediocre, the cocktails marginal, and the service abhorrent. I've gone back twice since the infamous cupcake incident where my roomate was told that everyone in our group of 12 plus would have to pay 3 dollars for a \\"dessert cutting fee\\" if she took out her two birthday cupcakes whilst at the establishment. There was an assortment of other issues surrounding service and table space that night with Contigo stubbornly towing an irrational line instead of making things easy. However, I gave them two more chances to redress their transgressions and here is a quick summary of their efforts:\\nI was told the wait would be 45-an hour and it ended up being almost and hour and a half. Then both my dinner companions received, finished, and had their meals cleared before I got mine. When I raised concern it miraculously appeared and I expressed dissapointment that I was now eating by myself 45 minutes after I ordered. They sent \\"someone\\" over to explain, taking no accountability, and offering a pseudo-apology basically turing things around on me as if I should understand why things went the way they did followed by a bunch of lame excuses they used as \\"justification\\". This authority figure even had the gall to tell me it had only been 20 minutes and she could show me the ticket which could have been turned in at any time. Anyway, by the time everything arrived and was checked on I was offered a complimentary dessert (cupcake irony?) but seeing that it was now after 10, over 2 and a half hours from our arrival I quickly declined. Leaving was the best part of the experience. Thanks for nothing Contigo. FAIL.\\n\\nCheck the recent reviews (over the last month) and you'll see that a downhill trend is strong.

When we arrived, the line was already way past the door and there were around 30-40 people in front of us in line. We probably sat down and got our food by around 12:30-1:00 pm. There are no chairs for you to sit down in like at Franklin if you arrive early enough, so make sure you come with friends who can entertain you for a while. The wait might have been worse for us because it was on. Friday, so if you come here during the weekday, there is probably not much of a wait. \\n\\nWe got the brisket, pulled pork, turkey, beef ribs, and pork ribs along with some chipotle coke slaw, potato salad, and buns. The brisket was not as melt-in-your-mouth as Franklin's, but it was still pretty good. The beef ribs were to die for and fell off the bone. It's marinated very well and is something that Franklin doesn't have to offer. The pork ribs were also a bit better than the ones at Franklin in my opinion because they fell off the bone more. The pulled pork and turkey were nice additions and served more of as a break from all the other heavy meats. Cole slaw and potato salad were just average compared to other places. Getting the buns was a good call because we could make our own sandwiches with them so that we wouldn't be eating only meat. \\n\\nOverall, I think that Franklin is worth going to at least once, but after that, la bbq is honestly pretty worth because it's not as expensive and there is less of a wait with bbq that is almost just as good."},{"name":"M & M Ribs","address":"102 Hampden St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Yuummy!

During the day (not at lunch) wait is almost nothing, at night it's 5-10 minutes depending on whether you got a fancy drink or a sandwich or just something from the case. Service is still friendly and fab. \\n\\nI have now tried the cheesecake and choco cream pie (see prior review), various cookies, the salted caramel bar thing, cupcakes, the cream filled cookie sandwiches, the dulce de leche cake, and various brownies, either at the shop or elsewhere. The salted caramel bar (which may have been a winter special) was my second favorite after the turtle cheesecake - salty, sweet, moist, rich, and decadently delicious. I also love picking up a cookie for an afternoon snack (they are sold at Flying Elephants if it's a Monday or you can't make it up to 12th Ave). The brownies are pretty good - I recommend the German Chocolate because coconut (when in doubt, always go with coconut). The cookie sandwiches are WAAAAY too sweet for me, so I don't care for them - I don't taste anything but sugar. However, I have friends who love them, so who knows. I'll be interested to see if they add an ice cream cookie sandwich at some point. I also don't care for the cupcakes, which I find lacking in flavor and a little dry. The dulce de leche cake was pretty good, but so sweet and so moist I could only eat a paper thin slice. \\n\\nRegarding prices, I'm seeing a lot of complaints here. I would love to know where these people usually buy their pastries and baked goods, because after 5 years working downtown (and frequent business trips to Seattle), $2.50-3.50 for bars, cookies, and pastries is perfectly on par with what other gourmet bakeries charge. The cakes are expensive at $8 a slice (though plenty of places in the Pearl charge $6-7 for a slice), but then again gluten free ingredients are expensive too, and making an edible gluten free, vegan cake is no easy endeavor (trust me). I do wish they would offer mini slices of cake and cheesecake for less, as I really can't eat a whole slice and I don't think day old cakes or cheesecakes are very tasty. Specialty cocktails are also in line with downtown prices. So really, the cakes are the only thing that are a bit spendy, and they are fine for a special occasion.\\n\\nIn conclusion, some of the bakery items are hit or miss, but if you have a sweeter sweet tooth than mine you will probably love almost everything. I love having a vegan bakery within walking distance of my office, and having a slightly fancier place to get a dessert and a drink after work with friends or a date.

To die for!!), crispy brussel sprouts (perfect texture with sweet and savory hints),  the pork belly with collard greens, and the bananas foster beignets (you're welcome). In my opinion it's best to come with a group of friends and do family style since it's great to try everything. But this is definitely a perfect vibe for a romantic date as well! It's a little pricy but so worth it! If you only have one night in Austin, you won't regret spending it here!!!\\n\\nEdit: As much as I absolutely love this place, the last time I went here, my friends and I all commented on how they took the term \\"salty\\" a little too literally. I was saddened that many of the dishes that night were much more salt-heavy than usual, and this is coming from someone who usually adds extra salt to my food!

The food is done so quick that it's incredible-- I hardly have time to finish my salad and soup before my appetizer is there, and I hardly have time to finish my appetizer before my meal is there (which doesn't bother me one bit-- I don't like to be kept waiting). I'm partial to the BBQ Teriyaki Chicken dinner and Shrimp Tempura appetizer and my husband gets some kind of bowl of raw fish with rice, which he loves. He also really enjoys their rolls.

When I went away to college it took a little getting used to, but by my second year I was a firm proponent of 'potle OVER Anna's.  Yeah, that's right.  Here's why:\\n1.) Anna's is cheaper, but also has smaller portions.  The aforementioned price to size ratio is gargantuan and guaranteed to be the cheapest and most filling dinner you'll ever have.\\n2.) The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  I prefer the onions and peppers here to Anna's mix of squash and shit.

The service was for sure lacking. No attention to detail. We always were left with empty glasses and had to ask for more drinks as well as water.

Curry on the inside, surrounded by cloud-like fluffy bread, and a crispy outer crust. I just wish they had a microwave in the seating area so I could eat it there hot. All of theirs pastries are very light and mildly sweet.  Perfectly balanced. Their breads are fluffy and moist. They place a high level of detail on all their food and the interior design.

The ambiance is quiet, cozy, romantic with the low lighting and pillowy lounge seating along the wall. That main attraction: The tapas are to die for! Had the beef lettuce wraps and the flavor was unusual and finger-lickin GOOD. Also Mama Mei's gyoza pot, basil pesto shrimp dumplings, five spice braised beef were phenomenal!! Shrimp tempura roll was pretty good, tho small and pretty standard compared to other sushi places. Hummus with hot pitas was amazingly good n creative; it came with cucumbers and a soft yummy melt-in-your-mouth cheese (if you like bleu cheese you may like this one, my friend didn't). Had the Caribbean Kiss cocktail n loved it, tropical and fruity. I ordered other things the first time; I don't remember every item that we ordered but I distinctly remember that there was not a single bad dish, everything ranged from good to lick-my-spoon delicious. I originally came here on a Scoutmob deal 8 months ago when I was last in town and really loved it. My three friends really enjoyed it as well. I've been craving it ever since, so when I got back in town I had to stop by. I went there for my birthday yesterday and couldn't have been happier with it.  I've been here twice so far and each time the service was timely, attentive, and warm. Overall pretty stellar, I couldn't ask for more. One little extra that makes me extra happy is that parking is never a problem. There are a lot of Asian food places around town but often you have to struggle to find parking if you're in Buckhead or downtown. Plus they have outdoor seating!

During opening week, I came with a friend to find workers outside handing out fliers about how they have not yet been paid for construction. First sign that the business is potentially shady. My first visit I got the flourless chocolate cake. There were two on display and they gave me the smaller one. Both cakes looked so incredibly different even though they were labeled the same. No consistency there. The other cake that they didn't give me looked fluffier and fuller, and the one they gave me looked deflated and tiny. The chocolate cake was so dry it made me cough after each bite. \\nI decided to give Gen Sou En another chance to try the karaage. It sounded like it was going to be delicious and different -- but what came out of the $14 meal was just popcorn chicken and a lot of (cold/room temp) jasmine rice with no seasoning. Plus, they give you less than a teaspoon of spicy mayo to dip your chicken in.\\nDuring this experience, my 4 friends and I sat on the platform with our shoes off and were around a table that was meant to be raised but was inside the ground. We were given 2-3 answers by different staff people about why it could not be raised, which ranged from \\"accessibility\\" which makes no sense because the platform itself was raised with stairs leading to it... to \\"we can't put it up\\" in general. My friends and I were not sure if the table was broken. Someone else also said they were at \\"capacity\\" which also made no sense as there were other people in the space and building capacity had not been reached (otherwise new customers should not be let in the door?)\\nOne of the members of our party had a food allergy and said this very clearly. When her food came out, it was placed on the table along with an identical dish. When she asked which one was the \\"allergen safe\\" one, the waiter said that both were fine. Someone also told us that there were no nuts in the tea biscuits, only to come back 3 minutes later to say there was actually ALMOND FLOUR in them. This is terrifying for someone with food allergies had they actually tried to eat the cookies.\\nFinally, the first time we tried to order two teapots, they were just out of teapots. As a party of 5 people, we really wanted a teapot to share and not to just order individual cups of tea. When we went back an hour later to request a teapot, someone had to double check that the one in our view was useable? It was so strange all-around. Someone in our party also noted that our teapot did not come with a timer, so we would not know how long the leaves had been brewing for. The tea was burnt by the time we drank it because either the water was too hot, or it had been brewing for too long (but we would never know because nobody gave us a timer.)\\nThis place obviously needs to get it together in terms of staff training and communication. I really wanted to try the soft serve swirl, but unfortunately one of the two flavors was not available... overall a disappointing experience."},{"name":"Dizin FruttiBerri","address":"127 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"5","text":"This place is super amazing! \\nVery nice people and tasty icecream! \\nDefinitely you must try!"},{"name":"Sonny's BBQ","address":"7055 S.
