The lady would pop out every so often with a bag in hand for the take-out orderer, or plates held in both hands for their dine in patrons.\\n\\nIt took me 10 minutes to get a box for my leftovers.  So my tip to you is, if you think you might be having leftovers, consider asking for a box ahead of time when things are a little quiet.  You never know when a bunch of folks might suddenly drop in and rightly commandeer the attention of the staffer at the counter.\\n\\nWhat's a Rum Tum Ditty?  Well, a search online turned up something with cream of tomato soup and cheese... nothing like what Popover King made for me.  My impression (later confirmed by words written on their board) is that a Rum Tum Ditty at Popover King is basically popover batter baked up in a hot cast iron skillet (I peeked through the back window into their kitchen).\\n\\nUntil the first day of summer 2019, their hours are 7am - 3pm.\\n\\nThey offer breakfast specials from 7am - 11am with the discount written straight out on the sheet of $4, for a specified breakfast item, mini popover (original or sugar cinnamon), and fresh fruit bowl ($3.99)\\nDrink options add on 12 oz for $2: Organic drip coffee, tea fauchon paris, orange juice, apple cider, lavender lemonade\\n\\nThey also have lunch specials from 11am - 3pm which include a dessert (The Royal or Sir John with a mini popover, or a fresh fruit bowl) and a drink (San Pellegrino (orange, lemon, blood orange, sparkling), orange juice (12 oz), apple cider (12 oz), lavender lemonade, Tropicana apple juice, Tropicana orange juice, Poland Spring water) with savings of around $4 (basically a mostly free mini dessert).\\n\\n3.5 stars.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI ordered one of their dessert popovers on my second visit: Sticky Monkey $8.50 (banana-maple filling topped with lemon cream).  The popover was still warm and crispy, and was filled with sweet cooked diced banana, and topped with whipped cream.  Not sure if that was the lemon cream mentioned in the description, as nothing in the dish was particularly lemony.  Still it was a tasty and rather filling treat.\\n\\nI had hoped to ask the lady about the lemon cream when she brought out the water I had asked for when she brought me my popover, but I guess things got busy in the kitchen.  I asked the gent out front for my water and he brought it over promptly.\\n\\n***\\n\\nSince my impression is that Popover King's Rum Tum Ditty's tend to be more filling than the popover based savories, I elected to give their Chicken Broccoli Rum Tum Ditty $11.50 (garlic cream and cheese) a try.\\n\\nVisually, it resembled an overflowing personal pan of white pizza, but with the crust a satisfying contrast of textures of tender beneath and within the crisp outer edges.  The flavor was terrific and the broccoli florets perfectly firm tender.  Unfortunately, the chunks of chicken weren't consistently tender delicious, as I discovered a number of dry pieces of meat lurking within the pool of cheesy sauce.  Still, a nice warming meal on a cooler spring day, and just a bit over half sufficed for my lunch.\\n\\nThe basic cheese popover $5 arrived split open with MELTED cheese within.  A decent layer - not an overwhelming (yummy) mess of goo.  The inside of the popover was eggy tender, with a lightly tougher surface which lacked the crisp contrast I so enjoyed in my 'rum dittys'.  Still, it went down the hatch quite quick, and was a nice snack.\\n\\nBTW - I checked out the mini sugar & cinnamon popover in the case on the counter.  For being called mini, they're not that small.  Perhaps the size of my fist?  $2 is a rather easy price for that bit of temptation.\\n\\n***\\n\\nTheir Cinnamon Sugar Popover $5.50 from the basic category just isn't all that sweet.  So if you like your sweets less sweet, you might like it.  But as for me, since the popover base itself would tame any sweetness added to the surface anyhow, I would have preferred a much sweeter version.\\n\\nOh, by the way, Dinner Service begins on 6/21, the first day of summer: 5:30pm till 10pm.\\n\\nNew hours at that point will be:\\nSun-Wed 7am - 5pm\\nThurs-Sat 7am - 10pm"},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I discovered the Cowfish in CLT about two years ago and was so excited when the owners messaged me per my review on that location telling me they were coming to ATL and offering me a giftcard.  \\n  I put that giftcard to use yesterday afternoon.

For a meal to achieve true greatness, my highest honor, EVERYTHING has to be great - everything you put in your mouth from start to finish, service, ambiance, the sum total of your experience with the meal. They don't happen very often, and the more you eat out, the higher the bar is set. Out of the blue, we had a truly great meal here. \\n\\nTo start, best shrimp & grits I've had outside of Clancy's in NOLA. So delicious, we cleaned the plate. Two breads were brought out - white sourdough (my wife's preference) and multigrain (mine - I generally avoid the white bread, so full of tasty deceit). Yummy with a little sea salt on the crust. Greatness is all about yummy little details, isn't it? \\n\\nWe split the candied beet salad. Not candied in a syrupy sense, candied in that the slices looked like sashimi. It made for a food-porn-worthy presentation next to stems of cress, sprinkled with goat cheese & mustard dressing. Beautiful to the eyes and on the tongue. \\n\\nMy main was the grilled salmon on a bed of kale and risotto. Sounds ordinary, right? As expected, the salmon was perfectly cooked, fresh & delicious, but the best thing I had all night was the kale and risotto it sat on. No, I was not drunk, nor am I a closet kale hound. It was amazing, transcending for me all that by which kale was previously known. Who has a high standard for kale, anyway? I don't know that I've every had such a dramatic swing in a flavor benchmark, but Christ, it was really good. The manager, who came over twice to check on our meal, said he hears about the kale twice a week. I think I would have gladly eaten tilapia, a fish I have no fondness for, if it came with this kale of the gods. (There is no tilapia on the menu, thank you) My wife had the picatta, another fairly ordinary dish that turned out perfect, great lemon - savory balance, thin chicken cutlet perfectly cooked. Better than expected would be an understatement for both dishes. \\n\\nMy rule for fine dining dessert menus is to always try the one that seems too crazy, too ordinary, or genuinely out of place. Anyone can make a chocoholic bomb or a creme brulee, so get what the pastry chef was putting some creativity into that day and it will either tank or soar. Almond Pear Torte, the menu said. No other description, very non-descript. It would never evoke \\"Damn! I've got to have that!\\" from a patron, now would it? I had visualized a tart kind of thing, with sliced almonds & fresh pears on top, but what came out was anything but. It was a small pastry pie, with a top like a meat pie, but flat and filled with almond paste like marzipan and thin layers of pear that almost disappear to match the overall consistency. Just a bit less than sweet, rich but not sugary. As just three words on the menu, it exceeded any expectations I had left in me. \\n\\nThe service was impeccable, catering to our every need without intrusion, hard to do in a small place like this. Wine list was limited, but the server's recommendation knocked it out of the park. We also really liked some of the artwork on the walls, completely subjective yet a detail nonetheless. As I said, it takes a lot of little details in a lot of different places to make a great meal, and they did it. So thank you, 34th St Cafe, for giving us such a rare treat."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Call ahead and put your name on the list.

Well, we braved the crowds spurred on by the widespread hype and waited for nearly an hour on a Wednesday night.  I pretty much expected it to be like this.  It is the price you pay for going to a new, trendy spot.  \\n\\nAnyway, we sat down and ordered our food: bacon & cheese, cod burger, fries, sweet tater tots, Nutella milkshake, Krispy Kreme milkshake.  It came fairly quickly for how busy it seemed actually so that was nice.  \\n\\nThe milkshakes came maybe a minute after our food arrived.  I had the Nutella one with marshmallows.  Frankly, it was good, but not great.  For one thing, it didn't really taste much like Nutella to me.  It tasted like a chocolate milkshake, but I think they added some ground up hazelnuts in there as there were chunks of nuts near the bottom.  The taste was good and not too sweet, but I would have no idea that it was supposed to taste like Nutella if given a blind taste.  It needed a stronger Nutella flavor.  The marshmallows were a bit tricky to eat and it would have been nice to have a spoon, but I was able to get them with the scoop at the end of the straw with some effort.  I tried the Krispy Kreme one as well and it tasted more like Krispy Kremes than mine tasted like Nutella.  I didn't really care for the grainy texture (presumably from the doughnuts).  Also, I didn't really get the use of liquid nitrogen.  I know Richard Blais and the foodies would argue with me and explain to me how I'm wrong, but I really couldn't detect any improvement in texture from the nitrogen and it just seems like a gimmick to me.  Overall, the main problem for me though was that the intended flavors were not well integrated into the shakes.  \\n\\nThe fries were pretty good, but not really my style - they were very greasy and some of them were too crispy.  I kind of like my fries to contain a little more potato - these were like crispy oil sticks.  The sweet tater tots were just bad, unfortunately.  They were very mushy on the inside and basically just little grease bombs that explode in your mouth.  The sweet potato flavor didn't really come through that strongly, but really the main problem was how oily they were.  It was kind of gross honestly.  Maybe we just got a bad order though.  I did like the bleu cheese served on the side.  \\n\\nThe burgers were definitely the highlight of the meal.  My bacon & cheese was well-cooked (medium rare) and all the components were really good: tasty patty, very tasty pork belly/bacon, good cheese, great bun, and quality tomato, lettuce and onion.  All the flavors were really good.  It was quite juicy, but maybe too juicy as you basically had to rest your burger in a sea of burger grease.  In addition, the burger was pretty tall and vertical which made getting a full bite with all the components pretty tough.  It was difficult to eat and became very messy quickly.  It was delicious, but sitting elbow-to-elbow with other diners and trying to eat this burger that was falling apart before my very eyes made me feel slightly self-conscious.  Hah.  I tried the cod burger as well and it was pretty good, but not as good as the traditional burger.  \\n\\nAnyway, service at the bar and the table was good and everyone seemed very nice.  I'd probably be in a great mood as well if my trendy restaurant and I were raking in tons of cash every night as well.\\n\\nOverall, I thought it was good, but I think some things like the shakes and tots need a bit of work.  I like the concept, but it didn't really live up to the hype for me.  It's still new so if they are smart they will deal with those problems as soon as possible.  Otherwise, I just can't see going out of my way to get a solitary burger and nothing else when there are a number of other great places in town to get a good burger and good sides.\\n\\n3"},{"name":"Tin Can Oyster Bar Brookhaven","address":"705 Town Blvd Brookhaven, Ste 320","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Horrible service and even worst food!!!

The setting is down-to-earth with several tables and a communal table. It can get busy during peak lunch and dinner times, but the wait isn't bad.\\n\\nOverall, the ramen is solid. Portions are alright as long as you're not starving, in which case I recommend the upgrade to large or super size. Quality is good, though I did find it unusual that the ramen comes with onion rather than bamboo shoots. (Yes, American onion, though they do also have green onion.) It's not bad and goes decently with the broth, just a bit rebel in terms of traditional ramen composition.\\n\\nWe each got the MISO CHASHU RAMEN, which comes with three generous cuts of chashu and a soft-boiled egg for $10.50. i.e. your basic ramen including bean sprouts and nori, with extra chashu.\\n\\nThe specialty is \\"rustic temomi: NOODLES, which are hand-massaged and in an uneven wavy form for a unique texture.

In my opinion it was a bit too salty, and the mix of torigara with tonkotsu confused the flavors for anyone used to the rich tonkotsu pork bone broth or the lighter chicken-based toripaitan counterpart.

I had high hopes for this Five Guys - as I have enjoyed the \\"original\\" Five Guys in Washington, DC.  Hell, I've even eaten at this very location before, and convinced myself that I was in love.  Today, was the day the music died for me.  \\n\\nI'm not sure if I've reached a turning point in my palatable career where food has just taken a different taste for me.  I used to enjoy fast food, and today, I realized.. Five Guys sucks. \\n\\nLet's start out with what I ordered:  A hot dog with grilled onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard.  Pretty standard issue if you ask me.  I got the food 5 minutes later (seems to me like it should take a bit longer to grill a hot dog, no?) and after unwrapping the tinfoil, the bun literally disintegrated in my hand.  GROSS.  I had onion juice all over me, and the hot dog (split into halves - weird) was pretty chilly.  The flavor wasn't terrible, but I've had WAAAY better.  \\n\\nSuffice it to say, I looked around the room and realized... \\"wow, most of the people in here are scarfing down HUGE burgers, making bloody messes, and most are also obese..\\"  Maybe this should have been my tip-off in the beginning.  \\n\\nI'll give Five Guys props for their clean kitchen, bathrooms and seating areas.  However bland and cold their dining area feels, at least it's clean.  They're definitely a no-muss, no-fuss type of place.  So, I guess if you love fast food that's greasy, unmanageable and difficult to eat without a knife and fork, you'll love Five Guys.  \\n\\nHere's a thought:  they should have named it \\"Five Guys: Heartburn and Love handles,\\" and steered clear of Five Guys Burgers and Fries..."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The wait was 2+ hours both days I went.

It came with two large thighs, four slices of waffle, and a small dipping cup for the sauce. The chicken was crispy on the outside, but not over-battered, and it was cooked perfectly on the inside - not dry at all. (I find this to be the case with a lot of fried chicken.) Individually, the chicken tasted a little salty... but paired together in a bite with the waffle and hot/sweet sauce was JOY. Unfettered, delicious, chickenwaffley joy. I couldn't finish it for dinner... but I definitely had it first thing the next morning for breakfast. Five stars for the chicken and waffles.\\n\\nMy friend ended up ordering the shiitake omelette and we also split the braised pork belly buns as an appetizer.

This may be a factor of the all-hippy beef they use, but I'm not sure. Toppings are fresh and the buns very tasty.\\n\\n2. Veggie Burger is outstanding. Best I've tasted in Austin (although its a little heavy on the lentils which some folks might not like). Especially since its nearly twice the size of the typical Gardenburger (tm) you get at lots of places when you order a veggie burger. Excellent (very fresh) sprouts and toppings as well.\\n\\n3. Fries - just OK. Not out of this world, not horrible.\\n\\n4. Milkshakes. A+ for making their own ice cream, but D- for execution and price. Ok - the price reflects the fresh ingredients, I get that.

First off - their online ordering service is the least user friendly experience I have encountered to date. Unable to remove items clicked on by accident so had to start over three times. Finally, out of frustration I just called the restaurant. For two people - I ordered: Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, Mango Lassi, Lamb Shank Curry and the Shan-A-Punjab Veggie Platter. My complaints, in order of importance:\\n\\n1. We ordered at 8:31pm - our food was received at 10:32pm - with the driver complaining that he could not find my house (although he had GPS, AND the correct address entered into it)\\n\\n2. It ended up costing $50!! I'm sorry but I am not a cheap college student - I am a working professional and even so, this price was outrageous for the amount of food we got. \\n\\n3. The Masala - not great; the Garlic Naan - soggy; Mango Lassi - mediocre; Lamb Shank Curry - had two fatty pieces of lamb; the Veggie Platter was really the only thing that made the experience worth it. \\n\\n4. Someone must have sprinkled some serious 'upset stomach' powder on all courses - because I have never felt this horrible in my life. \\n\\nPlease let it be known that I have eaten authentic, homemade, and other Indian takeout before and have yet to date had such a horrible experience.

I usually like to photograph my food to promote local businesses through Austin food networks, but did not feel the lackluster presentation would encourage anyone to visit. Along with the plates being chipped, the sashimi was sitting in a pool of soy sauce marinade that did not add any aesthetic or flavor enhancements to the dish. The maki rolls tasted okay but were quite mushy. Overall, I wouldn't recommend any of the sushi dishes I tried, those being the yellow tail jalapeno sashimi, the Angry Crab roll, and the Dragon Roll.\\n\\nI feel a bit guilty for only leaving three stars, but the service received on this last visit wasn't great either.

Now I only hoped it was enough off that path that we might somehow manage to get in at the still-early-hour of 8 p.m. We took a gamble and, amazingly, they had two seats available at the bar upon arrival.\\n\\nTaking full advantage of the day, they only had a prix fixe menu that night: $37 a pop, $18 more if you wanted a flight of wine with it. A quick scan showed a lot of promising options.\\n\\nFor starters, I ordered a warm crab and parsnip salad - it was very good, although drizzled a little too heavily with hot oil dressing. Brad had an assortment of meaty bites - salami, rabbit, foie gras - which didn't appeal to me at all, but he enjoyed it tremendously. This coming from a guy who was vegan 2 years ago!\\n\\nFor my entree, I had pork loin over polenta.. Brad had duck with lentils. Both came with some delicious sauteed greens. Overall I was surprised at the hearty portions and honestly could have done with a little less food.\\n\\nThe best part was by far their dessert - I ordered a jam tart with vanilla ice cream. Navarre filled this with their own homemade jam and that by itself was 5-star worthy. My big complaint was that they let my dessert sit for several minutes, to the point where the scoop of ice cream had melted significantly. Not wanting to be a jerk - or to waste food - I ate it. But that was definitely bad form.\\n\\nBrad had a really interesting dessert - apple & pear marinated in red wine, with a yogurt custard. The latter was pretty great - a dessert that was light in both flavor and sweetness. Manifique!\\n\\nTheir bread is good - big, hearty, crusty bread. I only wish it was served with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar  - or even some fresh butter.\\n\\nOverall, I really like Navarre though. The atmosphere is cozy, relatively quiet (you can hear your dining-mate talk), and the food is fun.

We've tried a few breakfast places around the area, and they've been pretty decent. I've seen The Breakfast Club on Yelp a few times and its received good ratings, but usually says waits are long on weekends. It was early, before 9:30am, so we thought we'd give it a try....\\n\\nWhen we got there we were actually 2nd in line to be seated. We looked around the place and got a little nervous because it is REALLY tiny, a true diner feel. Like I said, 1 of us always has work on the weekends so we needed to eat, not linger. After a few seconds we noticed 2 seats at the counter, next to a window and next to a girl who looked less than pleased to have to hold or wear her jacket. We seated ourselves anyway....Glad we did too because the couple waiting ahead of us waited almost 20minutes before they sat in a booth!\\n\\nThe coffee was good. A nice, black cup of diner coffee, in a heavy diner mug! yum! The waitress seemed really excited to take our drink orders, but then when we were ready to order a few minutes later she couldn't be found. The cook, who was cooking right in front of us, took our order. He was a really friendly, fun guy who seemed to really enjoy what he was doing. Even after we placed our order it took our waitress about 7minutes to come back to see if we needed anything.\\n\\nI ordered the Breakfast Panini and my boyfriend orderd blueberry pancakes. 3 larrrrgggeeee pancakes with fresh blueberries, and a panini that was spicier than I expected (I really love spice!). The panini was on bread so big (not thick, just really large) that I could only eat half. It had avocado, eggs, bacon, and cheddar jack cheese. It would have been pretty bland without the cheese, so I definitely recommend the cheddarjack. \\n\\nThe potatoes are absolutely delicious...and this comes from a girl who really is NOT a fan of any sort of potato!!\\n\\nThe waitress only reappeared after we were ready for the check, she came over about 3 times to see if we were ready to pay. They take credit/debit cards. We were worried that they didn't because there was an ATM on the inside of the diner, but were pleasantly surprised to find out they did.\\n\\nI would definitely go back to this place, and next time I know I'm trying the french toast.

When I came here Oct 2011 for a convention I couldnt resist trying it.\\n\\nLines were out the door, parking lot filled (we had to find street parking)...this of course would show how good (&/or over popular) a place is, so we were all hyped up ready to try it out! 5 min walk later we reached the front door...and a mass of people. It was touch to even get in to the desk to put our name down. The wait was an hour, but we did have to be anywhere that night, so we waited...and waited...and waited. In my head all I could remember thinking was (besides seriously considering punching the guy next to me who was blowing smoke all over my dress) \\"dam this place must be good...it better be good.\\" As a rule I dont wait more then 30mins for a place to eat unless I'm on vacation and I know that place is going to amazing; or like when I was in Ireland and all I saw were pubs and I wanted Hard Rock - I waited an hour and a half to have my fahita. This..this place was sausage. Aka: Pork Heaven! Basically, I was ok waiting the hour, even next to chimney-boy. (Just to be clear..smokers dont piss me off. Obnoxious pre-teens do. Kids who think they rule the dam world just because theyre old enough to steal mom's cigs without her noticing...you suck. Pull up your freakin' pants and shut the hell up!) \\n\\nWe eventually got in, were walked all the way to the back (which was a lot more quite), sat at a tiny table surrounded by families, and 10 mins later the waiter finally showed up. It was packed, loud, and we were really close to the table next to us. Tom (the hubby) isnt a little guy, he's got enough bits of Scottish & Viking in him to have a huge frame....he doesnt cram well into tiny places. But he wasnt complaining so I kept my mouth shut. The server got to us, we ordered drinks & told him we were there for the sausage buffet. We got up..carefully found our way over to the buffet, which thankfully was directly in the next room (we couldnt have made it any further without bumping into someone). The buffet had a bunch of different sausages & brats and everything from kruat to potatoes. I got some of everything while hubby ate his first plate standing there; he wasnt about to walk back out to the buffet line with this many people, nor was I. I loaded my plate, he filled his up again, and we carefully walked back to our table. Our drinks still werent on the table, so we ate our food. \\n\\nThe food was..ok. I cant lie, I wasnt impressed. I LOVE pork, esp sausage! I'm a meat chick and I was having a sausage craving from hell the moment we pulled through German village on our way to Schimd's. I was ready for dinner....which lacked flavor. You could taste the care that goes into the meat, it must be slow cooked in some fashion, deffinatly authentic made. I'm guessing my polish family rubbed off on me cuz I didnt find their meat to be that good. Now, I'm not a Pole, just raised by some. My mother and her 2 sisters have all lived in the same town in Jersey since waaaaaay back and all us kids grew up with each other; me being the baby. I've grown up with Polish food my whole life, with Irish & Italian thrown in for good messure. But the mother were all Polish, so our food was Polish; nuff said. I know my golumpki's (stuffed cabbage), perogies, and sausages like the back of my hand, and I could cook them blind folded with one hand. I find all this food (when made authentically) to be on the bland side, so I've tweaked mine over the years to have some taste to it; hubby loves herbs, period. \\n\\nBasically, if you like authentic german sausages and perfer that to their modernized recipes, then go to Schmidt's, you'll love it! For the money, the buffet cant be beat. But then again, if youre not going to eat  $15  worth of food dont order the buffet. It's expensive...esp for a buffet! DESSERT..my favorite part..we got a creme puff, which was good but more bready then I was expecting. Still good. I have my eyes on the cake, which they didnt have any left the night we went.  \\n\\nI give them 5 stars for being a family run buisness that has managed to stay open all this time. Im glad they havent moderized themselves, even down the uniforms. It's charming! I love old fashioned things and having this in german village is a great thing.

This is a big deal because she traveled by Marta from the location all the to East Point. \\n\\nThe taste. I had a pork belly taco and a Shrimp taco. My daughter immediately asked how did I know it was pork belly. Dear child just because you have never in your life seen me eat it doesn't mean I dont know what its is.

I like to meander around and look at everything and stuff my face with scrumptious food, and then go back another time to do my holiday shopping, but I did not like having to pay again. Just my opinion - but I really do think it's an improvement, and I have plans to attend at least three times this year because of the change.\\n\\nThis visit was my first for the year, so I focused on looking around and on eating. Hence, this review will mostly be about the food. I noticed that the food prices seemed to have gone up a little (probably to compensate for decreased admission revenue), and I'm totally OK with that... the food was not cheap before, but it is SOOO unique and delicious that I am completely willing to pay $7-10 each for the assortment of German delicacies, that I only eat once a year at the Christmas market. I'm not looking for bargain food, and I don't expect bargain prices. I've been here before many times, so I did not have the \\"crestfallen expectations\\" problem that seems to hit a lot of yelpers. I go with people who want to share and try everything, so while it isn't a cheap afternoon, the deliciousness is well worth the cost. \\n\\nThe spaetzle with cheese and ham is SO good - please don't even offend me by trying to compare it to mac & cheese - my flexitarian/mostly vegetarian friend could not stop raving about how good it was \\"even though it has ham and I don't like ham!\\" LOL\\n\\nThe hot chocolate from Lenvi chocolates was worth the 2-hour wait for another batch to arrive ... it's not sweet, but it's the most amazing, thick and savoury, delicious, chocolatey hot chocolate I've ever even heard of, let alone tasted. Their truffles are amazing too - if you like blue cheese, their blue cheese truffle tastes like dinner & dessert and you should try one. I also had the balsamic vinegar caramel sea salt one (the balsamic lent a fruity taste which I would not have pinned as balsamic if I hadn't known, but was a welcome addition to one of my favourite combinations ever, salted caramel) and the Iron Buddha (cardamom and tea - tasted like Indian food in chocolate - very yummy). I would only not get those flavours again so that I could try new ones, not because I didn't love them. I just want to broaden my horizons with some of their other unique flavours! \\n\\nAs for baked goods, I also loved the eggnog cupcakes, which were so light and fluffy and spicy, and had a divinely spiced buttercream frosting. I tried a waffle on a stick, and it was light and fluffy too, like yummy air which has been smothered in cherries. Yum. \\n\\nThe bratwurst and other grilled sausages are hot and juicy inside, and crispy-grilled outside, just the way they should be. Pile on the toppings and find a spot at one of the covered tables to eat your drippy and delicious \\"hot dog.\\" \\n\\nSampling was the name of the game, and we were happy to play: the kettle corn is perfect, IMHO, buttery but not greasy, salty and sweet but you can still take the corn flavour. We also tried a sample of the mulled wine flavoured hard candy, and it was the most unique candy I've ever had - I like candy, so I liked it, but even my friend who doesn't like candy loved it, since it's not really sweet. The coating of powdery sugar is sweet, of course, but inside the candy tastes just exactly like mulled wine - spicy and grape-y and all that good stuff, without having to carry the mug around with you everywhere (like into the Kaethe Wolfahrt building, where no food or drinks are permitted). Sampling worked, by the way, since we ended up buying both kettle corn and mulled-wine candies. \\n\\nThe (alcoholic) gluehwein is always yummy, but I noticed they are only offering one flavour of non-alcoholic hot cider (apple) and I also like the cherry one they had before. You have to pay a $2 deposit on your mug, but I am making a collection so I always keep it. If you buy the rum version of the hot drink you get a green mug, and all other kiosks sell the blue mugs. \\n\\nFroehe Fest!"},{"name":"Denny's","address":"8787 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"After several pleasant visits to this location I had an experience that forces me to write a poor review for this location.

The impatient customer pushed his way to the counter and offered his party. I stepped up to point out that there were others waiting in line while many of the offended guests left to eat elsewhere. The host explained that there was no way for him to know who was in line first after watching the unruly jerk bowl over my two small children to cut the line.

We pretty much ordered all the different meats on the menu to sample and to leave no stone uncovered. The plate included Sausage, Ribs, turkey breast, brisket, and a beef rib.

It does tend to get quite busy because it is such a popular place to chill so I would recommend coming here during the weekdays. \\n\\nFrench Macarons - I tried their lemon macarons which was very good. It had that tangy lemon flavor but it wasn't overwhelming. The edges were nice and crispy while the center was soft and gooey. I also tried their pumpkin macaron which this one was quite disappointing because there wasn't any pumpkin flavor at all. They do make good macarons overall but they were quite steep. One macaron costed me $2.50 which I could get something similar for $2 that tasted just as good. (3.5/5)\\n\\nChocolate Marquise - My bf and I really liked this one because it was rich and chocolaty. It was also very sweet, however, the salt from the caramel helped with the sweetness. Our favorite part was the crisp praline at the bottom because it provided a wonderful crunchy texture to the cake since the majority of the cake was soft. (5/5)\\n\\nCheese Onion Brioche - This was also very good. They didn't disappoint on flavor or the description because there were pieces of onions inside and it was very cheesy. The exterior part of the brioche was crispy which I liked while the interior part was light and airy. I bet it would of tasted extra awesome if it was heated up! (5/5)\\n\\nTiramisu - Very cute and pretty looking presented dessert. This one also didn't disappoint in flavor because the sponge was soaked with both coffee and kahlua. I have tried other tiramisu cakes where the coffee flavor was too mild. Even though it had such good coffee flavor, there was way too much cream to cake ratio to my liking. (3/5)\\n\\nPassion Fruit Cake - This was very lovely. It was light and refreshing. You could taste the passion fruit within the whole cake because it was in the mousse and in the gelee. It was sweet but also tart. It would be good on a hot summer day or after a heavy meal and you crave for something sweet. (4/5)\\n\\nChocolate Succe - If you have a super sweet tooth, I would recommend getting this because it was very sweet. Inside had a thick layer of meringue so it was very gooey and it had a soft-like consistency which wasn't bad but I prefer my dessert to have a variety of textures not just one note. (3.5/5)\\n\\nChestnut Tart - This was absolutely delicious! Just a FYI, the description online states \\"almond and chestnut cream\\" but it wasn't really cream. It was more like a paste but it was so smooth and tasty, and you could taste both the almonds and chestnuts. The top part of the tart had these caramelized hazelnuts and pecans which went lovely with tart because it added some crunchy texture and nutty flavor. It also was covered with tons of dark chocolate shavings which melted in your mouth. The crust of the tart was quite hard so be careful when trying to cut into it but nonetheless, it was crunchy and not too thick. It Another FYI, you would need to ask for this because they don't have them out in the display case and it is only offered during the fall season so you got to try it out soon! (5/5)\\n\\nOverall, their desserts are awesome and staff are friendly. I would only take their desserts \\"to go\\" because I usually have coffee with my desserts and their coffee was absolutely not worth it. I had an 11 oz americano for $2.95 and they gave me such a small amount. It looked more like an 8 oz cup. I would of gotten more coffee from Starbucks at a cheaper cost. Like honestly it doesn't cost them anything since it was only hot water that goes into an americano."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Horrible experience in so many ways. After arriving for our reservation, we waited FOREVER for our food. It ended up being over an hour. They brought the kids food first, and the kids were finished before our food even arrived, so of course they were ready to leave. Then when it FINALLY came, my chicken was pink. PINK. That's not ok for chicken. I sent it back and got another plate, but of course my appetite was ruined. The manager said she'd refund a point to my dining plan (which she never did, so thanks for nothing. Luckily I called Disney's dining plan line directly and they were incredibly helpful.)\\n\\nOur server was one of the worst I've seen and prob the reason our food was so late. They claimed it was a \\"lunch rush\\" (in a place that only takes reservations?) yet there were 2 groups of people in our area who had a different server who arrived at the same time we did and were leaving before we even got our food.

Usually the oysters are good but occasionally they send you out a really foul-looking one that you know didn't die within the last few minutes. I'd recommend lunch here for sure and out of season when packs of tourists aren't crawling around. Service and food are far better.\\n\\nNow for dinner. Oh boy. Last time I went I tried getting the custom option where you choose your fish, veggie, etc. I opted for the mahi and some steamed veggies that included zucchini or some such thing. Dear lord, what a disaster. The market price $25 piece of mahi was smaller than my palm and was soggy, the sauce I ordered with it was a watery mess too. Just flavorless and awful. The veggies were another soggy, limp, and colorless mess. I took a couple bites before returning it which I hate doing. Our server was more than kind about it and took it off the bill, bless her. I have had the steak tips in the past which were great, by the way. \\n\\nThe service this last time was fine, but there was another memorable time when we didn't even see our server for 45 minutes.

That said, there were a lot of other people in the restaurant, so we may have just caught them at a bad time. As for food, our meals were good, but again, pretty average. I feel like I could get something similar at pretty much any other brunch place. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food was pretty decent.

Usually it's things she doesn't like (keep it clean, folks) like driving across town to eat a burrito in a parking lot, or watching sports.  Bored (and hungry) on Saturday night, with nobody to take to Barley, I decided to do some yelp scouting.  In the yelp \\"hot new businesses\\", I found something that struck my fancy at #40: a new pizza place (opened January, I believe) at 360 and 2222, next to Waterloo Ice House.  I always try pizza places without my wife because she is gluten-free.  I like to make sure I think she'll like it before I think about taking her. This one had 13 reviews (5 filtered), and only 2 by users with more than 5 reviews, so kind of a clean slate.\\n\\nYou can order through the website, which I usually love vs. the oft-received \\"can you hold please\\" when calling.  But since it was just over 30 minutes till closing I called just to make sure it wasn't too late.  Man who answered was friendly and efficient.  Confirmed my name (from callerid), gave me the price, and told me it would be 15 minutes.  Into the car I go!  I get there at the appointed time, and it's there ready to grab.  I see they serve fountain Maine Root sodas, which many folks seem to like (made with Fair Trade Certified Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, not HFCS) plus regular Coke, Diet Coke, and Dr. Pepper.  And there is currently a yelp checkin offer for a free drink (though I didn't ask for it).  \\n\\nI try one slice on the way home.  It's \\"New York-style\\" fare.  There's a decent chew to the crust, not as much as I like, but a good amount.  There are also a couple small/medium bubbles in the crust, which I usually look for more of too.  Possibly they're still working on oven temp, ingredients, or proofing times.  A great crust is the \\"sushi\\" of the pizza world:  it often takes a lot of training/experience to achieve perfection.  The basic toppings are somewhere in the middle as well.  The sauce is light on flavor, and a little sweet, like when I make sauce starting with tomato paste. The cheese doesn't blow me away.  But I also certainly didn't let any go to waist, errr, waste.\\n\\nVerdict?  I'd lean toward 3 1/2 stars (why no 1/2 stars yelp?) since I wasn't as wowed by it as my 4* pizza faves.  But based on the owner Cory's excitement and promise to \\"make it right\\" if I didn't like the pizza, and it still being so new, you get the yelp bump to four. A solid neighborhood joint, with a broad menu.  If it's just me, I'd probably drive a little further from my Northie hood to pick up from House or Little Deli (damn, need to review that one too).  But I may give it another try, since unlike those two places, the online ordering has a gluten-free crust option (which, if correct, would be good to show on the main website, or the paper menu I grabbed).  If you're in the delivery area, it's probably better tasting than your other delivery options (though to be fair, I'm sure the big boys' \\"$5.99 medium\\" specials are killing small businesses like this one).  \\n\\n \\n\\nyelper note:  I doubt you saw that I had \\"checked in\\" as I walked up to the door, so it did surprise me when you replied to my \\"How's business going\\" question with \\"Well, we're trying to keep ahead of the 'mad yelper' reviewers\\".  Maybe you've got eagle eyes to my iPhone, and meant it nicely.

I was immediately turned off by one of the hostess, who sat me in a corner by MYSELF away from everyone else in the restaurant. When I expressed my wishes to move, she had an attitude, and once again, sat me in the corner in a room away from all civilians. The part that put the icing on the cake, was when I was walking out of the restaurant and she did not even glance or look up to greet me goodbye. I was SO uncomfortable - already being the only black woman in the building, then to get treated like I was a low life. I didn't have on a dress and heels, but I was presentable enough- causal to say the least - and did not deserve that treatment. I talked with the manager shortly thereafter, and he had little to no remorse for the situation, and told me to mention the situation to him the next time I'm in Austin ( Ummm...I guess). \\n\\n     Nonetheless, my food and server were GREAT. I forgot his name, but he was a tall, light skinned gentleman who knew a lot about the menu. He checked on me every 5 minutes, and treated me like a Queen. He gave great suggestions on what to order as well, and had great conversation. \\n\\n\\n   I ordered the rib-eye, with crab fried rice, and sauteed spinach. I have never had a steak so good anywhere else in my life! Everything was moist and full of flavor. The portions were huge, so I ended up taking a bit home. The best part was the crab rice - you could taste crab in every bite that you took. The steak was also very tender. I was really impressed with the food. \\n\\n\\n   Besides my terrible hostess experience, the food was beyond my initial impression.

It was chunky, fresh, and would have had good flavor if there was any salt and pepper present.  The banana pudding was great.\\n\\nUnfortunately, overall, the meat was extremely underwhelming.  The turkey was mediocre.  The sausage was good, and the only standout thing I tasted.  The brisket, what any Texas BBQ restaurant is judged on, was severely lacking.  It had almost no smoke ring, zero bark, no smokey flavor, and not even the slightest hint of salt or pepper.  I had to slather it in sauce to have any flavor.  On the topic of sauces, all but the \\"Sweet and Tangy\\" were extremely sweet, and I couldn't stand them.\\n\\nThey've only been open two days, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again once the iron out the inevitable kinks.

The hot sauce helped but it was still dry and boring.

It cost over $16! The guy asked if I wanted lean or moist brisket. I chose moist as I like a little bit of marbling on the brisket I. What I got was mostly all fat. The sausage is not at all like the kind they serve at the restaurant in Lockhart. It also had several pieces of bone ground up in it.  The rib was very good. The cole slaw was good.The potato salad was bland. Keep in mind that I am a fan of Black's BBQ in Lockhart and prefer to drive there rather than the place in Driftwood which is less than 5 miles from home. the next day my stomach was still upset.

Maria's strengths are that they are fast, consistent, and inexpensive. At $7.00, the most expensive items on their menu are the shrimp tacos, quesadilla, or burrito. Items containing chicken, pork, beef, or beans and rice cost considerably less. In my opinion, an amazing (five star) taqueria would be fast and easy on the wallet, while combining quality ingredients that offer full and interesting flavors. I haven't found one (yet) in Boston. My primary reason for awarding Maria's three stars is that their food lacks complexity. The protein and rice tend to dominate their dishes, while the sparse and flavorless toppings and fillers get lost. The staff at Maria's are friendly, and their convenient hours allow you to satisfy your Mexican cravings well into the night, long after other taquerias have closed. While not the best, Maria's is consistently good, and worth paying a visit."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"5017 Hwy 290 W","city":"Austin","stars":"1.5","text":"The absolute worst McDonald's experience I've ever had. We don't eat fast food very often, but the kids were hungry while we were shopping with family, and so we caved in to the glow of the golden arches. There was one person in line before us...it was during lunch time (this should have been a warning).\\nWhat we ordered: 2 Happy Meals, 1 plain/dry hamburger, 1 ketchup only hamburger. They were out of BOTH healthy sides, so the only option was double fries. Both kids wanted apple juice. The adults ordered an oatmeal cookie and two drinks. The cashier repeated \\"oatmeal cookie\\" as she rang up the order. \\nWhat we got: Both Happy Meals were missing the drink and one was missing the fries. A mustard only hamburger instead of ketchup only. 1 girl and 1 boy toy even though both my boys have buzz cuts and were wearing stereotypical \\"boy\\" clothing. Oatmeal instead of oatmeal COOKIE. The only thing right was the drinks and that's because we made them ourselves. \\n\\nThis all resulted in several back and forth trips to the counter, and a crying toddler because I didn't notice his hamburger had mustard instead of ketchup until we sorted out the rest of the order and had already cut it up for him. To be fair, the staff was polite each time I went back up and refunded us for the oatmeal we didn't order.

The horchata with a double shot of espresso was always good too.\\n\\nThat has changed.\\n\\nI have witnessed them show the disrespect they have for their customer base twice now.  The tacos two years ago were around $2.25 a taco, and it's not as though they come loaded with extras, and many of my friends (some from SA, the land of the cheap (appropriately priced) taco) balked at paying even that.  Last year, for SXSW they bumped the price to close to $3, never came back down after, and now they've bumped it to $3.50.  Furthermore, the size of their tacos has been decreasing, along with their service.  It infuriates me that they took my taco place from me, but there is no way these tacos are worth $3.50.\\n\\nBottom line: instead of service and relationships with customers, El Chilito would rather go for a quick buck and is happy to sacrifice or fleece their customer base, but they've gotten too big for their britches.

So, I came in for a meal around 11:30 and was seated immediately.  \\nUltimately, I found the meal fell short of my expectations.  I researched the restaurant a little more afterwards and found out it is owned by the same people who run Rainforest Cafe (Landrys).  In truth, that explained alot.  It was an inoffensive meal with a menu that aims for broad appeal.  This menu would only be adventurous if you think Sweet Sour Chicken is exotic.\\n\\nGranted, I spent much of my childhood and teens with pretty much this worldview so I'm not exactly hating on it.  However, I would have liked to see a few menu items that aspired for authentic Asian instead of American foods with some Asian inspiration.\\n\\nI opted for the tamarind duck with vegetables and jasmine rice.  I explained that I do not like my duck overcooked and would order something else if the preparation tends to go that way.  My server (who was very nice and accomodating) insisted the duck is not cooked to well done so I took a chance. \\n\\nYep, you guessed it.  It was a little past well done in my opinion.  The skin was sweet from the tamarind, but not crispy and a bit fatty.  While the meat was a bit overcooked in the breast, the thigh retained a good savory flavor and was nice.\\n\\nI also found the jasmine rice to be prepared well.  The duck was paired with a plum(?) (sweet) sauce that was a bit too sweet and swamped the natural flavors of the ducky.  I suppose if I was trying to make it a super sweet dish and mask the overcooking, this did the trick, but I tend to avoid foods that use gloopy sauces.  As I've gotten older, I find they are often used to make people ignore more subtle components.  \\n\\nThe mixed vegetables were too oily and pretty boring.  Carrot, green pepper, onion, and red pepper...\\n\\nI also got the mango pie for dessert.  It was (again) sweet, but a nice mango flavor.

So naturally, I had to give this place a try!\\n\\nLots of selection of different types of Taiwanese foods but I had to go for a bowl of beef noodle soup, I decided on the Champion Braised Beef Shank with (thick) Noodles in Tomato Soup ($10.95).

The noodles were so good, like soooo gooood! A perfectly cooked noodle, which needed a little effort to bite and chew - a good sign of noodle tenderness. The noodles were obvious that they were hand-made, some being oddly shaped and the thickness varying but imperfections are what make them perfect. The braised beef shank literally fell apart in my teeth and I was so pleased none got stuck between my teeth. Only downfall, the lonely half slice of bok choy in my bowl - kind of weak Chef Hung.\\n\\nLastly, the waiters were pleasant but very eager to clear our table. We left a piece of corn to cool on a plate but they took it away! In all honestly, the corn looked like it was already eaten/mangled but that's how they gave it in the bowl!\\n\\nNote: They said no HST, but in a way I think it was just added into the set price because $10.95 for a bowl of noodles is a little pricey, regardless of how good or famous it is. \\n\\nOverall, stomach-warmingly satisfying.

It was almost 8 pm, and we were hungry.\\n\\nOut of nowhere, the FIL suggests Schmidt's. Now as an avid Yelp user -- and someone who has been burned by family dining recommendations in the past -- my husband and I look it up on Yelp.\\n\\nAnd we find it has great reviews and we can get on the list for a table via the Yelp app. \\n\\nA little bit later, we're at Schmidt's, our stomachs rumbling over the promise of soul-filling German food.\\n\\nAnd because we put it our name on the list while still in the car, just a little bit later we had a table in this busy restaurant.\\n\\nI opted for the Haus Saurbraten und Gravy ($13.75), which included marinated lean beef served over German spaetzle noodles with traditional gingersnap gravy.\\n\\nSauerbraten and spaetzle are my absolute favorite German delicacies. When I saw it on the menu, there was no question about what I would get. And this dish did not disappoint. The sauerbraten was tender enough to cut with a fork and full of savory flavor. The spaetzle was little puffs that soaked up the gravy.\\n\\nThe dish comes with two sides, so I got the potato pancakes with applesauce and sweet kraut. The pancakes were smaller and thinner, like I like them. The kraut, on the other hand, was not what I was expecting. It was sweet with a bite. I liked it.\\n\\nSchmidt's also offers an awesome German beer list. I had to get the Weihenstephaner 1809 Berlinerweisse beer. Considering it's a sour beer, it may not have been the ideal beer to pair with such a savory meal on a cold winter night. But it's one of my faves; I had to do it.\\n\\nAnd the dessert -- oh my! My husband I shared one of their half-pound, jumbo cream puffs. We got it with vanilla cream. This was decadent and delicious.\\n\\nSome other reasons to love Schmidt's:\\n* The tuba and accordion band -- Squeezing and Wheezing, I think their name was -- was hilarious and such a fun addition to the meal. How can anyone *not* like polka music?!? It's just so happy. And when the band covers non-polka songs, like \\"Under The Sea\\" and the Mario Bros. theme, even better.\\n* Schmidt's also has a sausage buffet. I tried a few bites from my husband's plate -- shhhh, buffet guests aren't supposed to share -- and the sausage was great too. Buffet diners also get a discount on the large cream puffs.\\n* Be sure to visit the bathrooms when you visit. Instead of boring elevator music, the audio included instructions on how to say popular catchphrases, like \\"I'll be back\\" and \\"Show me the money,\\" in German.\\n\\nKitschy? Yeah. But Schmidt's goes back to 1886 and is a fun experience with awesome food.

It's even better if you go with someone who wouldn't mind sharing their food because, quite frankly, i want to sample everything when i'm there and ordering just one sandwich is like asking a child to go into a candy shop and just getting one thing. \\n\\nso i guess i'm not reviewing a particular sandwich because i've had a few and some a couple years ago, i can confidently say that there's something for everyone and something they'll not only eat, but love. that being said, plan a nap afterwards or a light afternoon. the drinks are great and the sandwiches are big. not grossly sized, but big enough to slow me down a little. but then again anything that comforting and full of carbs on a sunny summer day would do that to anyone.

The main draw to Terry Black's is that you don't have to wait in line for hours and hours and can quickly get some very quality barbecue.  The brisket there has been some of my favorite in Austin and while not quite as good as Franklin's brisket, I would choose Terry Black's over Franklin's simply for the fact that there is rarely a large line and you don't have to make your BBQ experience into an all day event. Along with the brisket, I have tried the pork ribs and sausage and was very impressed with both.  These are the 3 things that I look for in a quality BBQ joint and Terry Black's hit on all 3 of them.  I highly recommend Terry Black's to someone who is looking for very quality barbecue and doesn't want to wait in a ridiculous line, such as Franklin's.

Sadly, that's tricky for me, seeing I can't have anything with gluten and so forth. That and we didn't want to eat at the same Uno's for the millionth time in a row, so we did some poking around and found this place. It was a nice day out, so we walked on down from Boylston Station ( about fifteen minutes or so, really not that bad, though there is a silver line bus that goes down to it ).\\n\\nMy first impression was that it was way smaller than I thought it was going to be. I excepted a huge restaurant style, but it was more of a small, corner cafe style type place. We were thirty minutes early, seeing we had reservations, but the hostess was cool with us being early and allowed us to sit anywhere. It's brighter closer to the windows, so we opted to be sun-hating vampires and sit closer to the back. Nice and cool and shady. If you need some light while you eat, unlike us, then sit closer to the windows. It definitely doesn't look like an Asian anything inside, but the decor was still really pleasing. I loved it.\\n\\nOur waitress was really nice and I'm probably the only person in the world who doesn't like the waitress checking in on you every ten minutes. I'm very laid back in that matter and we were in no rush, so it worked out perfectly. She was very responsive to me not being able to have gluten and even came back at one point to let me know that one of the items we originally wanted was cooked in the same oil as gluten products. A bit of a bummer, but it still made me happy that she came back and told us. She also got us samples of the DELICIOUS sangrias they had so we could figure out which ones to get. The mango one was to die for.\\n\\nWe ordered an assortment of food: thai ginger chicken salad ( wicked good ), wok-roasted chinese sausage + caramelized onion omelette ( also wicked good ), fresh rolls ( my friend claimed they had too much cilantro in them, but it didn't bother me. plus the sauce that came with it was so yummy ), nasi goreng ( indonesian fried rice, WHICH WAS TO DIE FOR. I could have order four bowls of that and be set for the day, because oh my god. For realz ), and my friend also got himself some of the pork belly thingies, which I'm assuming were yummy, because they were gone in seconds. Pretty much everything came with a yummy sauce of some sort that gave everything a delicious kick. Not too mild, not hot enough to burn a hole in your stomach. I approved. They also gave us a huge pitcher thing of water, which rocked on such a hot day. \\n\\nWe must have been there for a good hour and a half, maybe more. We were in absolutely no rush and neither was the waitress, which worked out for us. Was an awesome atmosphere for a long, leisurely late lunch. The wait staff in general was very nice and whoever was the lead for the night came over and asked how everything was, very polite and awesome. When we left, a couple of the waitresses said good night and thanked us for coming. Very pleasant!\\n\\nMy only complaint was that I wish it wasn't really out of the way to get to. I tend to look for things that are closer to the various T lines, but it was worth the mini-travel. Still, was super happy they offered gluten-free items and weren't wishy-washy about it. Didn't get sick in even the slightest, so this place is legit.

She mentioned that many friends had said the food was good but the constant long line-ups meant that she didn't have a chance to try it herself yet.  We came on a Wednesday morning at 9:30 and true enough, there was a line-up, which made me think, don't people have to work?!?  In spite of the line, we arrived at a good time though because there were probably 3 groups of 2 ahead of us, but after we put our name on the sheet, the line grew steadily longer.  For the first timers, make sure you put your name down on the sheet of paper on the clipboard when you walk in so that you get in the queue.  We still had to wait around 15 to 20 minutes for our table for 3.  My general thoughts about breakfast is that it's hard to get too creative (while keeping it tasty), with all breakfast places serving the generic eggs and bacon.  However, Cafe Medina proved me that I was a little narrow sighted, with its selection of Mediterranean inspired dishes.  \\n\\nAfter some deliberation, I ordered the 'Harissa' Burger with an Americano.  My bf had the Fricass√©e with a side of sherry roasted mushrooms while his friend had the Fricass√©e Champignons.  My bf loves the American breakfast and sherry roasted mushrooms so he picked the dish that most resembled it.  We also ordered a Liege-Style Waffle to taste since it seemed to be a specialty item.  \\n\\nThe Americano was nice and strong without tasting burnt.  The \\"burger\\" was actually really tasty with a burst of refreshing flavours and textures.  The name sounds heavy but it actually wasn't - it was not greasy at all and it provided the protein I needed for a day of walking around the city.  Both guys enjoyed their Fricass√©e dishes but found it wasn't that special.  Out of the 3, my dish was probably the most unique that would not replicated elswhere.  Although I usually love anything mushroom, it didn't do anything for me (tasted kind of weird actually).  The waffle was also okay but nothing special.  The caramel sauce was the best part.  \\n\\nThe total bill for the 2 of us came up to $60, pretty pricey for a breakfast, although we indulged and ordered more than normal to try what Medina had to offer.

We went inside and the atmosphere & decor was elegant and nice. We got seated right away. We got to our table and meet our server Matt. He is awesome!! I recommend him!! He brought my sister a congratulations card. It was super sweet.\\n\\nMatt provided us with the wine menu & the menu once we got seated. It was our first time here and Matt was very patient with us. The wine menu is two pages long. Matt brought us couple of samples of wines because we couldn't decide. We ended up ordering Moscato wine for our drinks (#403 on the wine menu). My wine glass got tipped over due to the table being unevenly leveled. But Matt replaced it with no problem. I really appreciated that. \\n\\nIn the dinner menu there was alot of selection: oyster bar, appetizers, 2nd course(salad & soups), seafood, steaks, and side dishes. We basically had 10 course meal for 4 people. 11 if you count the bread. This is what we had:\\n\\n1) Batterfried Oysters: This was really fried well. The flavor was delicious. The cucumber gave it a nice twist. I never knew oysters and cucumbers went together really well.\\n\\n2) Mussels Special: (not in menu, Matt recommendation) The sauce in the Mussels were\\nincredible. It was not chewy and my dad loved it. Matt brought us a separate bowl to put our empty shells in. \\n\\n3) Maine Lobster & Shrimp Bisque: This bisque is creamy. It had chunks of lobster & shrimp. It has a lobster after taste. It was quite amazing.\\n\\n4) Shrimp & Crab Chopped Salad: The salad had avocado, tomatoes, mushrooms, candied walnut. It was wonderful. Ingredients were fresh. Salad was crisp. Big shrimps and fresh lumb of crabs.\\n\\n5) Alaskan Halibut with Fresh Crab: (not in menu, special of the day) Halibut tasted mild and sweet.  It lean and flaky and it melts in your mouth. \\n\\n6) Swordfish Steak: This swordfish is broiled to give a firm and meaty texture allows the fish to be rich and juicy. It's firmer and meatier than the Halibut. The swordfish is moist and flavorful, with a slightly sweet¬†taste. The sauce has avocado, cilantro, and fresh crab. It's really delightful.\\n\\n7) Texas Red Fish: 2 filet of red fish. This fish reminds me of red snapper. This fish had mild, sweet flavor with a medium-firm texture. Not a steak texture like Swordfish and not as flaky as the Halibut. Very well-seasoned sauce on this fish.\\n\\n8) Crab Fried Rice: This was one of our side dish. It was a American version of fried rice. It had mushrooms, scallions, and crab. Surprisingly it was tasty.\\n\\n9) Asparagus with Hollandaise: Another side dish. Asparagus originally comes with an egg. But Matt our server recommended to get Hollandaise instead. It was less messy. Hollandaise is the same as egg yolk sauce. Asparagus was cooked well.

The menu is large and there's something for everyone, so meat eaters and vegetarians/vegans can sit and eat at the same place.  For the type of eatery this is, I give it 5/5 (don't compare it to 'restaurants' because it really isn't a restaurant, it's more like Chinese Fast Food). Oh, and they change the menu every number of months, so that way you won't get bored of the same menu items (although some items are always there).  The most interesting dish I had there was Vegetarian (vegan) Eel.  Wow, did that ever taste like eel!! (naw, I've never had real eel before).  There are two kitchens.

We've had the tandoori bites before and they're awesome.\\n\\nFor the meal, I ordered paneer tikka masala, which was of course fantastic. You can choose your spice level and I went with medium, which was perfect. I also got a side of cream cheese jalapeno naan which was really good too. My friend had the Khuroos-E-Tursh specialty dish which is chicken-breast stuffed with seasoned spinach, cheese, and other wonderful things, topped with a cashew-almond cream sauce. Oh wow. It was amazing. Not very spicy, since the sauce is more creamy. We also ordered chicken samosas for the table, which were yummy.

It tasted like fried dough, but salty with scallion on top. I really did enjoy it though. I also really liked the the braised pork belly buns-- the pickled carrot was a nice touch for texture. The Salmon was probably my favourite dish. Not only was it good, it was also served with rice! The Kalbi was really not for me though. The sour cream was much too \\"fusion\\" for me. And finally I really enjoyed the noodles and the twice-cooked lamb. However, I really wish there were more than three pieces. If there had been, that probably would have been my favourite dish. \\n\\nThe ambiance was... a strange fusion. It felt like a nice western restaurant, but then the placemats were Chinese newspaper.

The first stated that we were on their waiting list and the second that they use Yelp to manage their reservations. We sat at a table near the bar where we could clearly see, and be seen by, the hostess station. \\nOver the next HOUR, we watched the blonde hostess seat multiple tables. At one point, she walked past us to the entrance to notify a group of people who were outside, smoking, that their table was ready because they hadn't responded when she \\"buzzed\\" them. When we watched a young couple walk in and get seated at one of several empty tables within moments of arriving while our 3 1/2 year old daughter began to cry because she was tired and hungry, my husband went to speak with the hostess. \\nIn an unapologetic tone, she told my husband that she \\"buzzed\\" us 3 times. At this time, I entered the conversation. A moment later, the manager joined us. The hostess continued to insist that she had \\"buzzed\\" us 3 times so I returned to the table we'd been sitting at and retrieved my phone. By this time, I had 1 (yes, ONE...NOT 3!) text saying our table was ready. \\nWhen I showed the manager and hostess my phone, the hostess said, \\"Ma'am, I wouldn't be deceptive!\\" (No one had mentioned deception but I certainly left the Clay Pit pondering her choice of words. I also am left pondering her defensive, passive-aggressive response to this situation. A simple apology and offer to seat us right away would have diffused the situation and left my husband and I with a much better impression than the one we now have.) The manager quickly had another employee seat us. \\nOnce we were seated, the manager came to our table and apologized. He offered free appetizers which we accepted. He brought out some papadum  (chutney and crackers) to soothe our daughter who was hungry and sobbing. \\nWe then waited 20 minutes as our waiter walked by not once, not twice, but FIVE times as he waited on two tables next to ours. He made eye contact with me every single time and appeared annoyed by having to deal with us. \\nWhen he finally came over to take our order, I began by asking for iced tea for myself and water for our daughter. The waiter stopped me, stated that he didn't realize we hadn't been served water, the manager \\"didn't tell me anything,\\" and said he'd be right back. Once we were brought room temp water with no ice, the waiter returned and took our order. \\nAs we ate our appetizers and drank our room temp water with no ice, the waiter returned to announce, \\"I know we got off to a rocky start, but we're turning your table over to Bo. He's a really good server and, well, I've got to, you know, get going pretty soon.\\" \\nThis young man who had to \\"you know, get going pretty soon,\\" was sweeping the floor around our table when we left. \\n\\nFor those who've made it this far, thank you! \\nI sincerely hope that you have a much more pleasant experience should you choose to dine at the Clay Pit. The food is good and fairly consistent. The service is another matter entirely. \\nIn the end, we spent $68.00 and left feeling angry, bewildered and unwelcome."},{"name":"Art of Tacos","address":"75 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"this place has been our source of sustenance while I've been in austin for Psych Fest.

Instead, they gave us a baby shower cake. How does that even happen? It wouldn't be such a big deal if they were nice enough to at least offer a partial refund.

Served open-faced on toasted Tuscan wheat triangles, topped with melted Monterey jack cheese and applewood smoked bacon. Served with Cape Cod potato chips), which for some reason I thought would be on large pita chips. It was on 3 big slices of wheat bread, and there was no color on the plate. Oh well.

We had no reservations and were pleased to be seated right away. The atmosphere is very nice. It's a very swanky looking place, and should be to justify the money you'll be spending there. \\n\\nOur waiter was very sharp. He was sophisticated and made our drink choices easy, and they matched our needs perfectly. I ordered a 14 oz sirloin with a side of mashed potatoes, and my mother ordered the Maine Sole with fiddle heads and sweet onion. \\n\\nOur food arrived and her portion was tiny. For a $25 entree it was underwhelming at best, and didn't have any fiddle heads or sweet onions to be found. The sole was too thick, which we later found out was two pieces of sole melded together with gluten (thankfully my mother in law isn't allergic to gluten!). A manager spoke with us, but didn't offer any sort of solution to the problem, be it a free drink, half off her entree, a side order. The waiter quickly became flustered despite my mother in law insisting that it was okay, and no fault of his. He poured water into my Perrier, and ended up tossing our bill on the table.  The bill included a $6 charge for my side of mashed potatoes. I would have never ordered them had I known that they were in the rare breed of restaurant that didn't include a side with a $33 steak.\\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't go back.

He told us about his family,  where he grew up,  the sports he liked, his favorite parks,  etc. He did not let one of our conversations or our food coming out deter him.

Seriously.\\n\\nNothing about this place has ever been a disappointment, and that includes my first time eating there, and waiting over an hour to eat a burger! First off, the service is awesome, super friendly and knowledgeable staff. It's reassuring, and unfortunately rare these days to be able to encounter a wait-staff that is as knowledgeable and opinionated on the menu as the kitchen-staff. Don't let the fact that this place markets itself as a \\"burger joint\\" turn you off; there are as many, if not more non red-meat options on the menu as typical burgers, and on my most recent visit FLIP received multiple accolades from my vegetarian companion. Yes, you read that correctly; vegetarians love Blais' burgers.\\n\\nI have yet to try anything on this menu I can honestly say anything bad about. The kobe beef burger is obviously one of the flagship items of this spot; and I'd highly recommend giving it a try on your first, or one of your many return visits. I have also tried the corn fed burger, which is delicious, with the blend of homemade sauerkraut, and being topped off with a fried egg. I was worried about the potential for messiness that might have been added by throwing a fried egg into the mix here however, doubt Blais in the kitchen has always proven to be a losing proposition for me, the man knows what he is doing and is single-handedly redefining my opinions of what can be accomplished between a burger bun. Also, I'd highly recommend giving any of the sides a try; the sweetbreads are wonderful, and the fries are probably among the best I have ever tasted, beating out what I remember about the wonderfulness of In-&-Out Burger's fries, a reassuring notion considering eating at FLIP over In-&-Out is a little more convenient to most Atlantans.\\n\\n...and the milkshakes. Ordinarily I am not much of a sweet-tooth but I have yet to turn down a milkshake from FLIP. Currently to date I have tried the Krispy Kreme, Mole, Foie Gras, and Nutella + Burnt Marshmallow, with the last being my personal favorite... and yes, you did read that correctly, FLIP offers a Foie Gras milkshake. This might sound odd at first, but intuitively speaking, the consistency of the blended foie gras lends itself to a consistency that suits a milkshake well.\\n\\nYes, quite clearly, you can see how FLIP is worth going and checking out for yourself and not subjecting yourself to an afternoon of reading Yelp reviews. Let's be realistic, a gourmet chef who has me writing about how delicious organ meats are *TWICE* in a review for a restaurant that proudly serves Kobe beef?

My little journey to Not Your Mama's Food Truck failed miserably so we decided to make a detour to Hopdoddy's and boy was this the best unintentional food adventure ever.\\n\\nThe restaurant's setup is unintuitive.  You walk in and see a bar in the middle surrounded by booths and tables.  The beer selection is actually pretty good and you get served in these BADASS goblets aka pimp cups.  We walked towards the \\"Order Here\\" sign in the back of the restaurant, only to be directed to a table for table service.  So for lunch, I guess you get in line to order but for dinner you get served at the table?  It's seat yourself so we sat ourselves in a nice tall booth in the corner.  We started to get a little annoyed after waiting 10 minutes with no service.\\n\\nI quickly forgave this unattentive waitress as we devoured the CREAMIEST root bear float I've had in a long time.  The vanilla ice cream itself was made in house and had just a HINT of cinnamon that just took it over the top.  The simplest ingredients can just things over the top.\\n\\nBefore I knew it, we were surrounded with 2 giant burgers, I'm talking MASSIVE burgers.  I kinda wish I shared because it was a ridiculous size, I'm guessing 1/2-3/4lbs of beef.  I chose the Llano Poblano burger, the hamburger patty topped with a roasted Poblano chiles -- melted, oozing pepper jack cheese and  Apple-smoked bacon for the nice crunchy, salty finish.  Burgers at its finest!\\n\\nTo pair with the rest of our fatass cravings, the side of chile cheese fries just put us into pure bliss.  It's not what I expected, you're actually just served fries with a bowl of queso mixed with chili.  The fries were wonderful, not too crunchy, not too soft.\\n\\nHopdoddy's boasts homemade ice cream, self-grounded angus beef, hand cut Kennebec fries and they even bake their own buns!\\nThe buns were a fine detail that I honestly admired.  I used to enjoy Five Guys but I hated the way the bun just fell apart because it was unable to hold up against the juicy hamburger patties.\\n\\nMaybe you too can enjoy some nice pair of buns at Hopdoddy....

I ordered the Smokey Bert and my dinning companion the catfish hash. What a waste of money. I can easily say that the food we ordered was the worst I have had in more than ten years. It was absolutely disgusting. \\n\\nFirst off, the Smokey Bert is nothing more than a large scoop of black beans wrapped in an egg. What makes this even sadder is that I couldn't eat them. The black beans had not even been fully cooked. Hard and crunchy I pushed all the black beans out of the omelette onto the side of my plate. Unreal. I picked through the omelette I found very little chorizo. It was almost like they ran out and was serving me the left over pan scraps. I had to look at a menu on another table to make sure I ordered chorizo. The toast that came out with my food was cold as if it had been sitting in the back for ten minute. Even worse than the toast was that the potatoes were also not fully cooked. One should be able to cut little chunks of breakfast potatoes with a fork. \\n\\nAs for the catfish hash... wow was it terrible. We ordered this because it sounded very promising. However, the fish was terribly prepared. The catfish nuggets were clearly not freshly cut as they were devoid of all moisture. Seemed like the fish was twice deep-fried. Yuck. The catfish was so dried out and hard, it was more like beef jerky than anything else. Who ever cooked that hash should apologize to the fish for utterly destroying its flesh. \\n\\nOne positive was the Mexican hot chocolate. It was the best thing we ordered. \\n\\nHow do you screw up potatoes, black beans and simple catfish nuggets? I don't know, but I will never be back.

One person sat us, another took our order, another refilled my water (I had to flag someone down), another one came back for our bill and another one brought it back.  I understand the team approach and wait staff helping each other when needed but they really need to consider assigning tables so that waitresses have a sense of how long customers have been waiting, if they've been checked on, if their drinks have been refilled etc.  There was no awareness of our needs as a table once the order had been placed. \\n\\nI really love living down the street from this place and will give the dine-in experience another shot and hope they read this review :)  Otherwise it will be take out only."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We Austinites are rivaled only by Seattle and New York in our lust for coffee.

The menu is diverse and, for the most part, hit or miss.  The breakfast sandwich is an overpriced version of something you can get at Whataburger.  The Luna Taco is tough to handle and requires a fork, but is actually quite good.  Unfortunately, all of their food is vastly overpriced, and each bite is laced with the frustration that you just overpaid for a very simple meal.  Nonetheless, I do have to give them credit for their in-house veggie chorizo, which is surprisingly great.\\n\\nThe environment is relatively stale at best.  The interior is a large room with a few scattered tables and two couches; not exactly conducive to intimacy.  The outside patio is a saving grace.  With a few benches, tables, and a stage that plays host to the occasional jazz group, the patio can be a relaxing place to have a conversation over your pricey food/beer.  Maybe you could even discuss how overpriced your sandwich is.\\n\\nThe general clientele is of the East-side hipster variety, and Cherrywood fluctuates between incredibly packed and ghost town-vacant.

The hostess calmly told us that we would either have to be completely re-seated, or would have to sit apart. We all desperately wanted to sit together--but didn't want to gip our server from a big table. Our server ended up going and asking the owner if it would be alright to push some tables together for us (it was a circular table and a little square table--so it s something they don't normally do). The simple gesture was really appreciated. He also let us know from the start that large groups are welcome, but checks can only be split between 5 cards per table (4 of us had cash! it was perfect) \\n\\nAmidst rampant jokes about how much time we might spend in the bathroom AFTER enjoying Clay Pit---we had an amazing time!

It all sounded SO GOOD in the descriptions. Our waiter was a huge help in explaining the dishes that he thought we might like based on what we said we liked and didn't like.  We were told that a sure bet is to go with the curry menu where you pick a sauce, a protein, and a spice level (mild, medium, spicy, extra spicy)-and you have a dish! Those are all served in a bowl w/ rice---they encourage ordering lots of different ones to share. Each table has a few containers of rice that the server keeps refilling--then you can just sample all the sauces/dishes that people ordered at your table (if they'll share!) . \\n\\nWe started with two different types of naan--indian bread. Pretty good...next time I might skip the naan to save room for the entrees (they are worth waiting for!). \\n\\nThe favorites from our table: \\n-Vindaloo chicken--REALLY tasty. Delicious--curry sauce w/ onions and bell peppers. spicier than some of the other dishes. I would def order again. \\n-Chickin Tikki Masala--a Tomato/butter cream sauce. I prob would go ahead and order it hot next time (I only ordered it medium). The fact that the sauce is red makes it look spicier than it is. \\n-Lamb Korma--You can't go wrong with this. cashew, almond,  pistachio cream sauce--YUM\\n-Daal Mahkni --this was one of my favorites.

Sounds plain-tasted UNREAL!\\nAll of the above (and some others I can't remember or were multiples) were passed around our table to pour over the rice. \\n\\nWhat a fun restaurant--I want to try another more traditional Indian place--but this was a great way to get my taste for Indian food initiated!"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"When peering into the restaurant would make it seem like the the lineup is crazy long for the tiny size of the restaurant, but there's another dining room at the rear of the restaurant that you can't see from the front.\\n\\nThe food is unique and sometimes pushes your comfort zone if you're more of a mainstream eater.

The parking was atrocious as I'd figured being peak hours and holiday time but we found a nice spot in the front (YAY US)! Upon entrance it still smelled weird (not dirty but weird) so my sister and I decided to eat outside. The waiter came out and immediately turned around. It was weird! She then came back outside and greeted us. She must have seen that confused look on my face because she said I thought it was colder outside so I didn't think I would be able to take your order. I'm like did you mean at this moment, without a jacket or all together?? Like it was already a table sat outside sooo I was extremely confused. I decided not to pry because she was there so that's all that mattered. We ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer and some tea. It was pretty good! Rich and creamy but after sitting a while it became thick. I order the firecracker roll and my sister ordered the Fusion Bento box with the veggie burger and marks roll.\\n\\nAfter laughing and joking, empty drink glasses and picking at the crab Rangoon dip for about 25 minutes we were wondering where was our waiter and food. She finally emerges with dipping sauces and mentioned the food is on its way. Ma'am it's sushi, 30 patrons and mid-day! It should NOT take this long. About 7 minutes later our food arrives. The food wasn't even hot. After a couple of bites she came back out and asked was it to our liking. I told her the food was warm in my sisters bento box, especially the edamame and so was my shrimp in my roll but I don't do remakes but it needed to be brought to your attention. She said we were actually waiting on the beans. As a matter of fact I saw the chef almost burn himself putting them on her plate!! Hahahaha GIRL STOP!!! My sister rolled her eyes as I smiled and kept eating. Finally asking about a member of customer relations she put some pep in her step! I mean clearing the table (yes the mostly eaten dip was still on the table) and our glasses were still empty but at this point the lunch wasn't salvageable. \\n\\nThe rolls were okay and I really like the ponzu dipping sauce.

He was fun to watch in the kitchen, and I always thought I would like to try his food.  Before I planned my trip to Atlanta, I didn't even know he had a presence here.  Once I heard about FLIP Burger Boutique (though ugh, can we not call restaurants boutiques?), I knew we would have to go.\\n\\nMy family came for a very late lunch, around three o'clock on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was moderately busy even then - about the lunch crowd you'd expect at a neighborhood restaurant of long standing.  The dining room was spacious and comfortable with a sleek, modern d√©cor.  We sat in a big white booth and admired the televisions and mirrors mounted in the same ornate white frames.  Service was good - prompt, friendly, attentive.\\n\\nWe got beers to go with our lunch, and I liked browsing the draft list.  FLIP Burger is a sort of gastropub, and since I don't live anywhere near Atlanta, I hadn't tried or even heard of any of the beers.  We ordered a Red Brick Hoplanta, a Fu Man Brew, a Terrapin Rye IPA, and a Bells Two Hearted Ale - all very good, and I'm guessing somewhat local.\\n\\nThe food was excellent.  Since we wouldn't be able to return with any ease, we all ended up ordering the Smaller meal - slider versions of three of the most popular burgers.  This carried a distinct advantage for the indecisive diner, but I might try a full burger if I ever go back.  I loved the little soft buns and everything was delicious, but the beef, at least, took a back seat to the accompaniments.  It was cooked medium well (on purpose) so I missed that tender bite, that dribbling leak of burger juice.  Nonetheless, all wonderful.  The Butcher's Cut was probably my favorite, a beef burger with bleu cheese, caramelized onions, soy truffle vinaigrette, fris√©e, and red wine jam.  The flavors were penetrating, umami-rich, and all very big without drowning each other out.  The RBQ was another winner, also beef topped with pulled brisket, coleslaw, RBQ sauce, and smoked mayo.  If you like a BBQ burger, you will love the RBQ.  The Fried Chicken was also fantastic, a classic sandwich with Southern fried chicken, B+B pickles, and spicy Duke's mayo.  The bird was well seasoned, with a nice crunch to the batter, and it did well with the pickles and the kick of the mayo.  We shared a fry side sampler with our sliders, and this was also superb.  The house-made French fries were crispy and addictive, cooked in beef tallow and served with smoked mayo and ketchup.  The vodka battered onion rings had a great flake, and they came with a lovely beer mustard.  The best of the trio, though, were the sweet potato tots - these were bite-sized tots with a burnished crunch, served with coffee BBQ and a tangy blue cheese foam.\\n\\nWe decided to get the liquid nitrogen milk shakes for dessert, and this worked out well - beer with lunch, ice cream for dessert.  We shared the Krispy Kreme and the Nutella + Burnt Marshmallow.  They came to our table encased in liquid nitrogen fumes that calmed down while we oohed and aahed.  A+ for presentation on these.  The shakes were also delicious.  The Krispy Kreme tasted like liquefied donut (in a good way!) with a little texture from what must have been actual blended donut.  The Nutella + Burnt Marshmallow was even better.  That chocolate and hazelnut flavor just cannot be beat, and the topping of thick, gooey, charred, mochi-like marshmallows was out of this world.\\n\\nIf I lived in Atlanta, I'd come back to FLIP Burger with some frequency.  It's pricey for a burger joint, but the feel and presentation are upscale enough to justify a weekend outing.  The beer is great, and the food is fun and delicious.  You can definitely see the Richard Blais touch - it makes this place stand out.  Even if you've been to a hundred gastropubs, FLIP is well worth that 101st trip."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I eat at Parish several times a week and have been doing so since I moved to Boston in the summer of 2016.

The addition of maybe a dash or two too much red wine vinegar and lemon pushed it over the edge - and at 22$ for a small portion for two - well, Pizzacato Caesar salad is a DEAL and far FAR better.  \\n\\nMy risotto (and I LOVE spring risotto) was adequate at best - a few bits of asparagus - hardly tender, and a few other vegetables - just didn't rock it. And that should be a staple.  Easy for you - chef!  Its risotto !\\n\\nChicken cacciatore? Sauce was cooked down - maybe even overly cooked down - but it rendered it strong, thick, and quite flavorful - but the chicken itself? Meh. \\n\\nBread ... it starts ones impression, right?  Good bread begins with well baked, crusty - something that doesn't seem like thinly sliced Italian bread out of a bag.  Another missed mark. \\n\\nONE  glass of plain black coffee - $6.50. \\n\\nSkip Wilf's - too many GREAT restaurants with fresh PNW ingredients,  contemporary menus, and innovative chefs, to spend money on what seems like an expensive throwback to the 60's.\\n\\nService was great - but that only carries so much value when the restaurant looses."},{"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Place","address":"24 Pearl St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Boston.

These are the basis of Chinese comfort food. Now bearing in mind that Hon's has really westernized its menu for the gwai los, there are still a lot of staples that are still authentic. \\n\\nTake for instance the humble bowl of congee or \\"jook\\" as known by Cantonese speakers. This plain, simple, bowl of rice porridge, topped with any of the several options provided, is the epitome of authentic Chinese cuisine. Originally consumed by peasants who didn't have enough rice to go around, added a bit more water to make this creamy rice porridge (kind of like a poor man's risotto). But man does it ever hit the spot when you've got a cold!! It's easy to eat and digest and will pick you up off the floor if you're feeling lousy or hungover or sick and turn that frown upsidedown.

However, this was not needed as there were not many people in the restaurant. \\n\\nI couldn't choose between burger and sushi so I got both. They do have bento boxes where you get sushi and a small burger, but that burger was just too darn small. I got the Philly roll and black truffle cheese burger. Wow, the roll was bigger than I thought. I definitely had to stuff myself to eat as much of the food as I could (cause I was not gonna take any home). The burger was better than the sushi. I also ordered a milkshake. They have alot of creative options, even alcoholic ones. My friend also got a shake. We both thought it was the best part of our meal. \\n\\nSince we were there within the first week of opening, everyone is still getting used to things and learning. Our waitress didn't seem to really know details about the menu. She kept commenting on how everything was fresh. Over and over. \\n\\nThe bathroom is super weird.

We had both spoke of 34th Street numerous times but neither of us had been there for dinner.\\n\\nThe service was excellent and very attentive. Not in an overly awkward way, however. I also was hungry for a steak and I asked for the Filet, which was the most expensive item on the menu, but the person waiting on us admittedly steered me away from it by saying it had only been on the menu for a couple of weeks and had mixed reviews of it! I was shocked! More times than not, the waitstaff of a restaurant will say \\"it's good\\" regardless of what you ask! So I chose the hanger steak. It was delicious! The steak had only a hint of sauce (which any person who enjoys steak knows the real flavor is the meat, not to be hidden by the sauce!) and I had the hand cut fries as well. The presentation was impressive! They even make their own ketchup, which is out of this world. It's those little things that make restaurants memorable! I also had a chocolate cake for dessert that was overly generous, portion-wise and very good.\\n\\nWhile the restaurant is not the cheapest dinner in Austin, it might be one of the most enjoyable dinners I have had in my 4+ years of Austin! This establishment has been open for around 15 years and the attention to detail was amazing. The decor was pleasant and even the color selection of the Bellini chairs was pleasing to the eye and random. The lights were dimmed at a certain time of the evening and some restaurants can dim them too much where you can't see anything. It was done just enough here.\\n\\nThis is definitely a place I will return to on many occasions! I would like to try their lunch, but I hear it is totally a different experience.

The restaurant itself has a clean and modern decor, and it is set up rather comfortably.  The restrooms are very clean, which is nice.  And the service is good - not quite as attentive as at India Quality, but still great at refilling water and looking out for you.\\n\\nI strongly recommend trying the naan stuffed with lamb and spices.  It's about $0.50 to $0.60 more than the plain naan, but it's completely worth it.  I'd had garlic naan before, but never naan stuffed with a protein.  It was rich and flavorful, with just the right amount of spices baked into the bread.\\n\\nI also recommend their lamb masala dish.  I decided to mix it up a little and have lamb this evening.  While you can go all-out with vindaloo, I decided to go with masala, and I asked for them to prepare it \\"hot\\".  It was hot, but very flavorful and by no means overwhelming.  It paired perfectly with the rice (among the best Indian restaurant rice that I have had) and the aforementioned lamb naan.\\n\\nDefinitely stop into Punjab Palace if you're looking for Indian food in Allston.  It's a step above Indian restaurants, and you'll enjoy the atmosphere and service.  (Did I mention that their TV constantly plays Bollywood music videos?

The chef was cute and took a slice of octopus and made eyes for the roll! I wanted something hot, so I ordered pork tonkatsu. It same with a side salad and miso soup. The dressing on the salad was gross. It was like a vinegar with loads of pieces of pepper. I would of preferred to see a ginger carrot dressing. The miso soup was bland. When the tonkatsu arrived, it was a giant portion to make up for it! I think about 4 big cutlets of pork tenderloin. Also teriyaki sauce on the side of noodles. We had to make most of our meal to go because it was very unexpected and lucky of us to have tried it.\\n\\nWe never had any drinks here so we can't rate that."},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Viva vegan!  I may like my meats and cheeses but I'm also all about health...and sweets, which I know may seem like a contradiction.  That's because it probably is for the most part.  But I give kudos to any company that cares about the health of their customers as well as the environment, which Pattycake does.  Look beyond the teeny store to what lies beneath the glass of the display cases and to the delightful people behind the counter.  I was heading for the blueberry muffins but then I heard the cranberry orange muffins calling out my name and turning my gaze over to them they caught my eye.  When I tasted it after getting home, it was no disappointment.\\n\\nRule of thumb for this place, come in with cash or you won't be leaving with less than $10 worth of stuff because of the minimum charge.  However, if you just can't resist the temptation to bring home a load of goodies, by all means don't worry about the cash.  I wasn't thinking about a minimum charge and had just used the last of my cash before visiting Pattycake so I had to get something more.  Oh dear.  I decided to try the hemp flax granola cake cookie.  No, you won't get buzzed if you eat this thing!  Outside of my Mom's granola cookies, this one was near the top of the list.  It wasn't dry and crumbly like a lot of cookies end up being, but rather moist and not lacking in flavor at all as sometimes granola cookies are."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The donuts here are simply to die for!

I was expecting a long wait but as I waltzed up to the hostess stand, I saw signs for Landry's memberships. When I checked in, the hostess asked if I was a Landry's, I was happy to say yes.

Man, she was the nicest waitress, congratulated us for our wedding anniversaries, (this vacation was to celebrate our wedding anniversary and our friend's wedding anniversary as well), and immediately took our drink order. After she returned in a very timely manner, she answered any questions that we had on the menu items and showed us the special items on the additional menu. The four of us shared the Dim Sum Basket. My wife and I ordered and shared the Lobster and Shrimp Garlic Noodles and the Crispy Honey Chicken entree. The dim sum basket had pork pot stickers, shrimp siu mai, cha su bao (BBQ pork buns), and pork siu mai. All were served on a banana leaf inside a steam basket with soy lime dipping sauce. This was very yummy and a great appetizer. The garlic noodles were chock full of fresh shrimp, lobster pieces, and scallops. It was very tasty. I thought it was a bit saltier than I like but my wife thought it was okay. The Crispy Honey Chicken was perfectly fried to a crisp with the honey sauce accompanied by white rice, sugar snap peas, and carrots.\\n\\nAll-in-all, the food was a pleasant surprise. Lil was great with her service and our empty drink cups didn't stay empty for long. The sound levels were not too high where we would not be able to carry on a casual conversation.

The flavors are all lined up and labeled clearly, so you can decide what you want while you're waiting in line. \\n\\nI ended up going with the raspberry rosemary buttermilk doughnut and I was able to also try my friend's orange creme brulee. Both of them were absolutely incredible with really complex flavors. \\n\\nThe raspberry rosemary buttermilk doughnut was a little tart, but the rosemary undercuts this without being too overpowering.

It was fairly empty on a Thursday night (about 10 people), so we sat whenever we wanted. Both my husband and I had different drink menus (with different selections and alcohol percentages) which seemed to be a problem with the menus strewn about the bar. After figuring out what the correct one was, we were still underwhelmed with the beer selection. Of the 6 or so beers on tap, there were only 2 worth drinking, one of which they were out of (a nitro stout). We eventually settled on an IPA and a cider. Since the place was pretty empty and we were sitting right next to the bar, I expected our drinks in just a few minutes, but instead both bartender and waitress were off doing something else for 10-15 minutes. When we finally got our drinks, both were short pours.\\n\\nFor food, we ordered the Frontier Burger with bacon wrapped jalapenos and the smoked salmon BLT. The BLT was ok, but felt lacking in some kind of sauce or flavor and it hardly tasted smoked. The burger was more well done than I would've liked, and though it was decent, the jalapeno tasted like a bell pepper. Both came with fries, and they were a bit on the soggier side. Both dishes were pricey for what they were even if they were cooked and flavored correctly.\\n\\nI like the feel of the interior, but with the poor beer selection, slow service, and high price for food, I'm not so sure I will return any time soon."},{"name":"Newk's Eatery","address":"1405 Spring Rd SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3","text":"The food is always great but they seem to be very understaffed.

This place is going to make some serious money!\\n\\nFirst off, the location is pretty great. I love the Hannibal Square area and I've long hoped that someone would take this spot and make something magical out of it. Luckily, John Rivers had the clout and the dough to do just such a thing. He didn't make the same mistake he made with his first 4Rivers in Winter Park though. This is a nice, large restaurant that has plenty of seating (indoor and outdoor). Though it's so large, it still manages to maintain a wonderful charm- due to fantastically eclectic and mismatched tables and chairs, both wood and brick floors, lots of *new* windows, and great decor.\\n\\nLike 4Rivers, you will likely have to wait in line. But also like 4Rivers, it's well worth it. I decided to go with the Oxtail Beef Stew because I love oxtail, love stew, and my friends were getting the chicken, so I new I could try some of theirs. I chose to get it with 2 sides (aka fixins), the broccoli salad and maple glazed carrots. All together, I paid just over $11 and was actually quite happy with that since the portions were VERY generous!\\n\\nThe Oxtail stew was DELICIOUS! There was meat on and off the bone, but it was so tender and only took a slight nudge to get all of the meat off the bones. It was served over rice. The broccoli salad was also pretty darn delightful. It has bacon bits, craisins, and some other fantastical ingredients and made me love eating my greens! The maple glazed carrots were pretty good, but they didn't knock my socks off.\\n\\nLuckily, I went with good friends who were all about sharing and sampling everything. Here were some notes on their dishes:\\n\\n- Fried chicken: mouthwatering breading that has plenty of pepper in it (which I actually enjoyed), but on occasion could be a little heavy on the fried breading. Overall though- a big hit!\\n- Creamed corn (fixin): Holy Moley. I've never had creamed corn like this, but it had big kernels in it and a creamy sauce and was very surprising. I'd definitely order this again!\\n- Mom's Meatloaf: This baby is wrapped in bacon and the portions are BIG! It was so tasty that I have to imagine it's terrible for you. I don't care. I'll order it next time!\\n- Fresh fried okra: It's nice that the okra isn't fried to hell and is still a bit al dente! A little heavy on the breading, but pretty dang good! (that's saying a lot from a girl who doesn't like okra!)\\n- Mac & 3 Cheese: OK, granted I didn't get much of this (my friend was obsessed with it and hoarded most of it for herself) (I'm not judging!), it was seriously good! Definitely worth the crazy sodium and calories you'd be consuming (but who goes to a John Rivers restaurant to be healthy anyway??!!)\\n\\nThis place is going to be a hit.

It's a Mexican tapas place. You know what I say about tapas: small portions with huge prices. Bartaco offers that.\\n\\nFirst, parking is a nightmare. They have valet, and that makes it easy. Or you can try to find street parking (good luck), or find public parking nearby. \\n\\nBartaco's tacos are about $2.50 for a plain one. For tacos with exotic meats like ribeye, duck, boar, oyster, etc.; they are about $3.50 each. These tacos are tiny too. A full grown man would need about 4-5 to get full. \\n\\nOkay, so the food is small and expensive, how do they taste? Not so bad. I liked most of my food. They tasted solid. They have decent flavor, and they do it right. \\n\\nEveryone's favorite side was the grilled corn. Most people at our table ordered it. It comes with lime, cayenne, and cojita cheese. It's their take on Mexican street food, Elote, except it costs $2.50.\\n\\nThe corn comes in a bowl. It's messy to eat it with your hands; therefore, you should do what Yelper Troy S. did and cut the kernels off and eat it. That's much cleaner. \\n\\nI didn't have the problem with the food. I tasted good. Sure, it could've been cheaper but whatever. The problem was their outdoor seating. \\n\\nThey sat us outside in full sun. After 5 minutes of sitting, we were sweating already. They should have shade at every table. It's dumb to have tables in the open sun, especially in the middle of July. \\n\\nLuckily, we moved to the shaded, lounge area in the middle. These tables are short. You need to be a Smurf to sit comfortably on these. I have no idea how a 6' tall man (me) can sit comfortably on these. This was a bad decision on their part. Nobody looked comfortable at these tables. They should've just got standard tables. It's one of those things: good idea in theory, but bad idea in practice. \\n\\nOh, they also screwed up our orders. I can't fault them for that. They have their excuses: brand new restaurant, big group, and a busy lunch time. So I can forgive them for being slow, messing up our orders, and other service blunders. But they do need to get it together, or they are not gonna do well. \\n\\nTo order, you fill out order cards like in a sushi restaurant. The problem is, they sometimes combine multiple orders in one tray. So it gets confusing and people don't get their food. They should keep each cards separate, even if 1 person orders 1 taco. Do not combine multiple orders in 1 tray. \\n\\nOne thing I like is their blue card. If you need something, you display the blue card and someone will be summoned.

Ultimately, they ended up having to split our group in two in order to accommodate us.\\n\\nFrom the service perspective, things were good. Our server was attentive and quick. Once seated our orders were taken promptly and all of the food arrived as ordered. We never had to wait for drink refills and our asks were taken care of immediately.

The burger I had tasted great, was the right size and the sides were good as well. Of the 20+ folks dining, not one had a complaint about their meal. I did not order one of their famous milkshakes myself but I did sample the Captain Crunch selection and it was phenomenal. I was not underwhelmed by the food or selection but I was not tremendously excited either.\\n\\nFrom the price perspective, I was not surprised that prices were a bit high given the location and trendiness factor of the restaurant, but I felt it was a bit high for what is essentially just a burger.\\n\\nThe one thing that I loved though was that they sell bottles of Coca-Cola with REAL sugar and that earned them a tremendous number of brownie points in my book.\\n\\nWhat I took away from this experience was (1) don't plan any type of large group gathering here, they simply are not set up to accommodate that, (2) be prepared to pay for a burger at fine dining prices. \\n\\nWould I go again?

This restaurant is located inside Hana World Market's food court and is the only one that has remained there for the past couple years. They are always the most popular compared to their neighboring restaurants, but wait times are always quick at around 5-10 minutes even during peak times. There are plenty of seating so no need to worry about that if dining in. One thing to note is that Yoree charges 25 cents per to-go box and is cash-only. The food is not amazing, but still pretty tasty and a great value for the price. For about $15, we always get a large amount of food more than enough for 2 people. Some of our favorites include the Seafood Tofu Soup and Bibimbap. \\n\\nAny meal order includes complimentary side dishes (usually kimchi and 2 other kinds pickled veggies) and self-serve soup. There is no limit to the soup so you could have another bowl or 2 if you'd like. When we came, they had the Korean Egg Drop Soup, which was nicely seasoned, had plenty of egg, and a little spicy kick from the white pepper. The Seafood Tofu Soup was delicious as always, and perfectly seasoned without being overly spicy. The Bibimbap came with a large portion of veggies, and was topped with their red spicy sauce to your liking. The veggies could've been better seasoned as they did lack some saltiness. \\n\\nOverall, this place is comparable to other Korean restaurants we've tried in the past, but at a much better value and price. When our Korean food cravings kick in, we'll probably visit Yoree again to satisfy our tummies."},{"name":"Yoree Korean Cuisine","address":"1700 W Parmer Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Yoree is the type of utilitarian lunch place that are so common in highly dense Korean communities across the globe.

Tender, juicy, and doused in a sauce that brought upon new flavors with every bite. \\n\\nThe 4 star rating is because of the dessert.

I can't even stand myself because I haven't been here in years.

It's so close to the airport and they close at 11:30PM on weekends.\\n\\nWe got dropped off at the lot to get her car at 11:00PM and I called in for a pizza to go.  15 minutes.  We got there in 5 and I waited another 8 minutes inside for our piping hot pizza, fresh out of the oven.\\n\\nMy mouth was watering as I stood in their takeout area, watching all the pizzas come out of the oven and being cut right in front of me.  As I ran to the car with our pie, I had to stop myself from biting into a slice right away.  I wanted to enjoy the pizza before I burned all my taste buds.\\n\\nWow, words can't even begin to tell you how good this pizza is.  Plain cheese is perfect for me.  I never eat the crust on pizzas, but Santarpios is just too good to throw away.  Perfect amount of saltiness with the best cheese to tomato sauce ratio.  I think there's also garlic powder that gets baked into the bottom of the crust for added flavor.\\n\\nJust had this last week, but can't wait to come back and get more.

Hi Hat has been on my radar since it opened and I've been reading the reviews. \\n\\nA few things stuck out to me during our visit: \\n\\n- No table service. You have to order at the bar. \\n- No Happy Hour on Fridays. I really wanted to try a cheese plate, or one of their infamous pretzels but I'm not going to pay $15 for cheese or $8 for a pretzel during Happy Hour. \\n- Yes, the patio is dog friendly. However, the patio does not have a fenced off area and is located next to a busy four way stop. Since we were there during Happy Hour the street was very busy with people rushing to get home. Also, since Hi Hat lacks any kind of fencing or defining of the patio you have to deal with people in the area walking their own dogs and \\"visiting\\" with yours if you're on the lower level. Mildly annoying when you're getting ready for a sip of beer and suddenly you have someone's 300lb Basset Hound under your table tangling itself up with your own dog and leash. They just need a fence or even a rope to remind pedestrians that this is an actual restaurant and not the YMCA. \\n- We enjoyed the beer selection and I love that they encouraged sampling of beers we don't normally see on tap. \\n- Parking was quite easy for us but I could see it was challenge as it got closer to 5:30.

Everyone ordered either the Lamb Shank which was perfectly cooked and falling off the bone, or the Lamb La Zeez. Mine was slightly overcooked compared to last time, but still delicious and forgivable since we did have such a large party. The entertainment was great, the girls were walking around balancing swords on people's heads and people were getting up and dancing as well.

The Buffalo bill burger was just spicy enough without making me break into a sweat with every bite.  I love blue cheese on my burger and the bacon and sauce was a perfect compliment.  The Greek burger was extremely tasty.  The taste of the red onion and pickle were very distinct against the feta cheese.\\nThe only reason I can not give 5 stars to Hopdoddy's is because of the portion of the meat.  I wish there was more meat that was given on the burger.  If they offered a 1/2 pound maybe, it would be perfection.

My husband and I dined here for a late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday around 4:00, and the fact that most tables were filled at this odd dining time hinted to me from the start that I was going to be pleased with my experience.  The restaurant contains a dining room area, which is very casual, and also has a small bar area. We chose to sit at the bar, and the service was great. The staff were very attentive, and were happy to make suggestions, as we had never eat this cuisine of food before. We started with the Combo ($12.95), which was made up of strips and wings. Since we couldn't decide which sauce, we ordered the Half and Half, which was half Soy Garlic and half Spicy Sauce. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice, but my husband really enjoyed this flavor. I loved the soy garlic, and the chicken with the sauce was amazing. It was crispy, and the batter had a nice flavor, a bit lighter than your typical chicken wings. The wings were served with a side of pickled daikon radish, which was a tasty and refreshing snack. We also ordered the Bibimbap ($13.95), which was delicious! I had never had anything like it before, but we were presented with a hot stone bowl filled with rice, various vegetables, and topped with beef and an egg yolk. Everything was seasoned and tasted nice together, and I enjoyed how the rice became crispy from the heat of the stone bowl. The egg yolk mixed with the vegetables and beef added to the tastiness of the bowl.  Additionally, the meal was served with a miso soup, which was light and tasty, not much different tasting than a miso soup you would get anywhere else. Overall it was a tasty meal with a lot food!

Like other reviewers, I do understand that it is a new restaurant so any of these early reviews should be read bearing that fact in mind, including mine. \\n\\nThat being said, let's get to the highlights:\\n\\nGuacamole: Average guac. Nothing to really complain about, but nothing to rave about either. Would've preferred a little bit more flavor. \\n\\nSpicy chorizo taco: Was very tasty, but incredibly small. I thought $7 for 3 tacos was a great deal until I saw the size of the tacos. But, if it were solely based on taste, I can't say anything negative.\\n\\nCeviche: A little different than what I'm used to. It's shrimp ceviche with sliced red and yellow peppers and onions. Personal preference, I would've liked the vegetables to be diced because the size of them were a little overwhelming. I think it could overall use a little more citrus flavors whether that be lemon or lime. It fell a little flat for me. \\n\\nPork tamale: The pork itself was a little too fatty for me. I did like the overall texture of the tamale though. With this, I wished there were a bit more flavors as well. A little one-dimensional and just not exciting enough for my taste buds. \\n\\nAs it is now in its early stages, I would go back here again for a drink (they had a wide range of margaritas that I unfortunately did not try) because again, the vibe and atmosphere is impeccable.

Hadn't been in about 6 months or so and I brought a friend for some beer and pool.  We walk over to where the pool tables used to be, and in their place are dinner tables and a fireplace!  WTF??  So apparently they are no longer a pool hall.  I talked to the bartender and he explained that they have switched their focus to dining, serving \\"authentic\\" Mexican food.  I said \\"Don't the same people own this place as Sunset Grill downstairs?\\"  He said yes.  So I said why do you need two Mexican restaurants?  He explained that Sunset Grill is Tex-Mex.  This is AUTHENTIC Mexican.  Okay.  Whatever.  I just ate dinner at Sunset and I thought it was fantastic, so I really didn't see why they would now want TWO Mexican restaurants at the cost of getting rid of the majority of the pool tables.  On the opposite side of the joint they now had a few pool tables remaining.  We went and played for about an hour, but honestly the table seemed warped or something.  I kept missing the easiest straight shots, and it was like the ball just had a mind of it's own.  I swear, this was not a result of the alcohol.  I think they are truly shitty, warped tables!  The atmosphere just also isn't the same.  I liked the chill vibe the old pool-table area had.  It's just kinda plain and boring now, and  I believe most people must feel the same because for a Saturday night it was pretty dead.  The waiter was also odd.  He kept chasing us down and asking if we wanted drinks when we clearly already had them in hand.  He also INSISTED on showing us a dinner menu, despite the fact that we told him we just ate downstairs and weren't hungry.

Select tables are spread-out-worthy, but scarce.\\n- LIGHTING: spotty. Main source of lighting from paper globes hanging closer to the ceiling than the tables. Apart from this, the tables near the walls have their own table lamps. That's it.\\n- MUSIC CHOICE: at first I thought 'Oldies,' then 'Today's Mix,' then I just became distracted by frequent commercial breaks. There's only so much Geico we can take, guys. This was at least  weakly conducive to getting my shit done, until the already loud station clashed with the band blasting from their patio and whatever was on their television. Granted, I could've elected to go elsewhere on a Saturday night, but hey, this is a coffee shop, no?. I'd expect a little less Rawk and a little more Bach? Ok I'm kidding, I hate Bach - it just rhymed.\\n- FOOD: This is where Cherry excels beyond Epoch, who also carries the foods. Cherry offers sandwiches, gyros, burgers, pastries, a nice little selection of wine and beer on tap, *and* a build-your-own taco, on corn.

This review is for yesterday and only because it is a consistent experience that happens upon every visit. I remember when Hopdoddy first opened, Soco was blessed with a gourmet burger bar...not that the strip was short of a high priced-high quality burger (the pepper crust from The Woodland and Perla's $15 perfect cheeseburger to name a few). When the restaurant started catching attention with a constant line, they stopped allowing phone in orders. Understandable. I've phone in orders, dined in, and walked in to order to-go and every time I am confused and in awe of how the system of processing work. I mean, I get it...it's counter service, but also table service, but also you can avoid it all if you can find a seat at the bar. Yesterday was my first time at attempting to stand in that ridiculous line. Ridiculous because I am an Austin brat who can't justify standing in line for anything...especially a burger, but today I made an exception for my overly excited little sister who was visiting. We checked the wait time with the overwhelmed hostess and poked our heads in to see the situation at the bar...she noted that \\"if we really want to sit at the bar, feel free to grab any open seats we see while we wait\\". The longest 3 minutes passed and two seats opened up and we darted to the bar, only to be cut off by the same hostess that was so seemingly accommodating moments ago. She said that there were some folks who also wanted to sit at the bar and that she was going to grab them from the line. Now I'm really confused...so there's a table wait list and apparently a wait list for the seat yourself bar. We lost our place in the rapidly growing line and hangrier than ever. Debated for a second to chug a few shots of homemade ketchup at the condiment bar (NO LINES!) before leaving, but didn't want to feel anymore shameful. The burgers really are tasty. Go on a weekday...at a weird hour...not during a holiday and it will taste 100% more delicious."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Had Desta in my sights since all these 4-5 star ratings have been filling the review panel....finally got to go tonight.  Plenty glad that I did. \\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n1)Fish tibs with shiro- !!!!  This dish was borderline PHENOMENAL.  It was NOT a soupy watery tomato soup- it actually had just the right texture- not so thick as to be a paste, but enough to be able to scoop with the spongy bread.  The garlic flavor was strong- just how I like it.  The tilapia had a thin fried breading that encrusted it- and it was thick enough to keep the fish slightly crispy despite being soaked in the thick sauce.  All kinds of awesome! (4.5)  \\n\\n2)Kitfo Dulet- This dish was a bit different, but nevertheless tasty.  (description from the restaurant: Tender lean freshly minced extra lean beef, sauted in a special blend of house spices, onion, pepper, and Ethiopian butter)  I had them cook it medium...but it looked pretty red to me when it came out.  Not everyday that I get a good sized bowl of lean minced beef to eat (not that I don't love my wife's predominantly veggie cooking.....heh...heh)  (4)\\n\\n3)Lamb Tibs- (again, restaurant's description: Tender cubed fine lamb leg sauteed in a special blend of house spices, onion, tomato, pepper, and Ethiopian spiced butter)  This dish was served with some sauteed cabbage, which was surprisingly good as a side- I'm used to stewed cabbage from southern cafeterias.....so this was pleasant surprise.  The lamb was not too gamey, and lived up to the restaurants description.  Good good stuff.  (4)\\n\\nAlmost forgot, we ordered vegetarian Sambusas, which are basically like mini fried Samosas stuffed with Lentil, onion and diced jalapeno peppers. This was definitely had a nuttier taste than Samosas (which are typically stuffed with potatoes)- not bad at all.  (3.5)\\n\\nWe also had a glass of the honey wine...which is like a white-wine looking, port tasting wine.  Okay, nothing special.  (3)\\n\\nI haven't read all the reviews, but apparently the word \\"Desta\\" means \\"Happy\\" in Ethiopian, as per our waitress.

For such an amazing experience, this place needs some more accolades.  I had heard about the amazingness that is Hopdoddy, but was warned that there can be a pretty insane wait depending on the day/time.  Luckily, anytime I've been here it's only been with one other person, so we were able to snag some seats at the bar.  The bartenders are some of the nicest I've ever experienced anywhere. Seriously.  Not artificially nice either.  Idk i guess maybe i just have some adjusting to do to this level of friendly coming from the northeast haha.  But lets just say that it totally adds to everything else wonderful about Hopdoddy. \\n\\nHopdoddy also offers a solid beer selection to go along with their ridiculous burger selection.  I've had the bison burger, as well as the beef burger with the habanero  sauce on it (can't remember the name).  Both of which were mind-blowing.  The bun, the juiciness of the patty, the fresh taste of all the other ingredients on it, all of them were outstanding.  Each time I've also gotten the truffle parmesan fries which were very tasty.  I highly recommend getting an order of these to go along with your artery clogging experience.  If you want to go the healthy (ish) route, there are some options for you.  A veggie type burger, ahi tuna burger, chicken burger are all viable options.  Me?  Bring on the meat. \\n\\nI can say with confidence that Hopdoddy is one of the top 3 burgers I've ever had.  If you're in Austin, you simply must stop here.  And should you have room for dessert, the nutella milkshake had me drooling, but physically would have put me over the edge, so I didn't do it, but you should."},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Tapas here are decent, paella could use some more flavor.

When I complained about it, before even smoking it (basically right when it came out) they were very hesitant to change the hookah. I ordered two hookahs and they only changed one of them to a regular hookah at the table by simply swapping the heads. They made us keep the second as the clear all glass water bong and wouldn't change to a regular hookah. \\n\\nBesides the bad service and horrible hookah, the environment was depressing and uninviting.

It was a little hit or miss for me. Some things were really tasty while others completely missed the mark. I'm a huge thai food fan, and having enjoyed thai food in cities across Thailand as well as some great spots in NYC, LA, and Portland, the signature thai flavors of sweet, spicy, sour, and savory felt a little off balance in some dishes here. Leaning quite a bit more towards sweet with little or no spice and lacking some of the lime/acidity I love about Thai food. The duck leg curry and wagyu salad we had were delicious, while the Thai iced tea dessert was pretty to look at, but not really that satisfying or interesting. Would've preferred a simple mango and sticky rice, but that's just me. \\n\\nThe cocktails however were inventive, complex, and delicious.

First and foremost, the service was incredible. We sat outside and were constantly being tended to. We had a group of 6 so we ended up ordering every dish (multiple of some) except the \\"Snacks\\" in order to try them all.\\n\\nMarinated Egg - a \\"fancy\\" deviled egg that absolutely melts in your mouth. Simple but definitely a favorite for the table.\\n\\nCrispy pig ear slaw - definitely crispy, but the flavor wasn't really there. It's a lighter dish and wasn't one of our favorites.\\n\\nSpiced root vegetables - sounds simple but incredibly delicious. The spices were almost curry like but subtle. Vegetables were cooked to perfection (we ordered another one).\\n\\nSmoked fish salad - this one had mixed reviews from our group. As someone from NYC, I really wanted to put it on a bagel. Great fish salad, but a little too much by itself.\\n\\nBeef tartare - The beets really stand out here, but besides that, it was pretty average. The standout here is the beef fat cracker.\\n\\nGrilled and fried broccoli - Absolutely delicious tempura fried broccoli. We ordered two of these.\\n\\nShiitake dumplings - These were incredibly flavorful. You eat it in one bite and it has some vinegar kick to it. Big fan.\\n\\nCollard green tamale - I wasn't the biggest fan but others were (we ordered a second one). It's exactly as it's described, a tamale that uses greens as the wrap and then mainly beans inside.\\n\\nConfit chicken leg - Huge fan of the mix of flavors with the chicken, the jalapeno, and the jam.\\n\\nRadish pancake - Ok HANDS DOWN the BEST dish of the night. The pancake is like a crepe, and the pork belly and shrimp inside are full of flavor. I could eat multiple of these alone. Wish they sold them on a food cart or something for a quick snack!\\n\\nGoat shoulder - Extremely tender, nothing crazy but well cooked.\\n\\nWagyu barbacoa rolled pasta - Same as the goat shoulder. Very well cooked, and great for fans of steak.\\n\\nDuck breast and leg - the leg here was the real winner. The breast was nice and thick, but got a little close to being \\"dry\\". Definitely pricey for the amount you get, but hey, it's duck.\\n\\nWe skipped dessert but ended up going to the ice cream shop next door called Lick. HIGHLY recommend going there (they open till 11PM). Tons of unique flavors, and it's extremely cheap (for what you get).  \\n\\nAll in all, Barley Swine was a huge winner in terms of meals at Austin.

Fair enough, I used to manage a hotel restaurant, I get it. It took over 15 minutes for anyone to come to our table, and we had to really make eye contact to get that. We ordered some drinks, oysters to start, I got the fried clams and my wife got steamed lobster. Drinks came more than 10 minutes later, the oysters shortly after that. Oysters were good, if just a tad expensive (2.75 each). Before we were done with those, our dinners came and were unceremoniously plopped down on our table. My wife had gotten no lobster crackers or picks. After about 3 minutes, we got a waiter's attention (not ours) to ask him for some. 3 minutes after that, he came with the instruments but said they had sold out of lobster bibs. Seemed weird for a seafood place on the water. The lobster was also quite overcooked; not good for the most expensive thing on the menu.\\n\\nIn fairness, I do have to say that the view is wonderful and their beer and cocktail menu is really good.

The Benedict was good, but similar to what I'd expect at any other average joe spot. I wouldn't necessarily come back for this alone. The fiesta eggs wasn't that great of a dish. The poached eggs were cooked to the consistency of hard boiled eggs. The yolks weren't runny and the whites were rubbery.  It was pretty unappealing actually. The potatoes underneath would have been better if they were cooked a little longer and were crispier.  The potatoes with the Benedict were better, but both needed more seasoning.  They were pretty bland overall.  The sour cream was a good addition, but I wasn't too impressed with the dish as a whole and wouldn't order it again.  My cappuccino was average.  \\n\\nI might give this place 3.5 stars if I could because the Benedict was solid, though not incredible. Since I can't I'm leaning the other way to 3 stars.

The kebob was very well prepared and arrived at the proper temperature with just the right amount of sneaky hot spices for a wonderful flavor.

The restaurant is very rustic and casual, but warm and inviting with indoor and outdoor seating available.\\n\\nThe food and coffee were great.  They serve quality food at decent prices.  The menu has a good mix of options from various breakfast/brunch items, delicious fresh baked goods such as pastries, croissants, and muffins, but also made-to-order smoothies.\\n\\nI had the huevos rancheros.  I was expecting something a little more traditional, which it WASN'T, but it was still tasty. I had the cinnamon almond croissant.  It was probably one of the best croissants I've ever had.  The exterior was lightly sweetened with cinnamon sugar and the entire pastry was studded with thinly sliced almonds.  The inside of the croissant was fresh and soft...absolutely delicious.  I also had a Cuban con leche.  It was spectacular!  Cuban coffee is brewed WITH the sugar, so there's no need to add any sweetener to it.  My daughter ordered a strawberry pastry, which she said was perfect.  She also had a Cafe Au Lait and loved it.\\n\\nHere's my complaint - while the food and coffee were good, all it takes is one bad apple to taint someone's dining experience.  The woman making the coffees was absolutely rude and unfriendly....and not just to my daughter and me, but to others in the restaurant.  She seemed genuinely annoyed by the fact that she had to interact with customers at all.  \\n\\nThe restaurant doesn't necessarily have a defined flow of direction within its ordering and dining area.  It's just kind of all mixed together.  As soon as we walked in, I could see where to order the food and there was a sign above where to pick up coffee, but not much else was very obvious, especially when there aren't very many other diners in the restaurant to notice a particular route to follow. \\n\\nUpon picking up my coffee from the coffee pickup counter, I said, \\"Excuse me\\" to the woman at the coffee counter and was greeted with a mean expression on her face. I asked for some sweetener for my daughter's coffee.  She looked thoroughly annoyed at my simple question and answered rudely that it's all over there...barely pointing to a small cart-like counter over at the ENTRANCE of the restaurant.  I then asked the woman for a cup of water.  She was very rude in her response again and said, \\"it's over there.\\".....meaning on the same cart-like counter where the sweetener must be.  I wouldn't know this because I hadn't yet seen what's actually on the tiny counter across the restaurant from where I was standing.  MY BAD for not knowing the layout of a restaurant before ever stepping foot in the place.  It seems to me that for anyone working with the general public in the morning, especially in a face-to-face \\"pick up your coffee at the coffee counter\\" kind of environment, that person should probably be a little more friendly and receptive to basic questions since he/she is the person with whom we are faced in doing so.  And if you don't want people ASKING, it might be helpful to simply state where the coffee condiments are located when a customer picks up their coffee or have a sign at the coffee pickup counter to specify the location of the coffee condiments. The fact that other staff members were seeing her poor attitude the entire time we were there and yet her behavior persisted speaks volumes about management.\\n\\nGreat restaurants are a dime a dozen these days.

They don't have soy, they have almond milk. So I was mistaken in my first review saying that I got a soy latte. I got an almond milk latte.

They do have labels on all the baked goods in the display case now. However, prices are not present. There is a list of sandwiches and lunch items with prices and food stuffs though.

Both were extremely delicious but almost too rich (I think because of the donut) that we couldn't eat more than half our plate.  The portions were a good size although we weren't too impressed with our drinks - I had a Bloody Mary and my husband had coffee.  We considered both watery but that may just be due to our preference for strong flavors and brews.  The staff was very kind and attentive and it was a nice comfortable atmosphere with a cool outdoor patio area.  They also had some games, a photo booth, and an oversized donut that you could entertain yourselves with while waiting for a table.  We'll probably go again the next time we visit."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great coffee (can be so hard to find) and also a very tasty breakfastsandwich with eggs and salmon.

Then to top it all off they have a dope and unique selection of flavors.\\n\\nThe BBQ sliders, I only have great things to say, again the smoke comes through really well like someone actually cared about that slab of meat, and the variety of ways they serve it, you can't go wrong.\\n\\nService was awesome on a Friday night. \\n\\nIf we had one little thing that would have made the experience top notch, they need to bring the ribs back.

The chicken should be cooked at the right temperature and then place in ice to cool so it is not over cooked inside. The chicken at Hainan kitchen was over cooked.

Their quality tasted worse than the cheap hong kong cafe that offers Hainan chicken but way cheaper. Portion is not wow and price for the taste is not wow either.

Sad to say it was a disappointment for me. Let me preface this by saying if you want a good quality, cooked to your desire steak then yes this is your place. So long as you're not hungry and wish to have a complete meal. We ordered the crab cake as an appetizer, lobster mac and cheese, honey and bacon Brussels sprouts and of course Rib eyes as our entrees. The crab cake was definitely real crab but was desperately lacking in flavor. The lobster mac and cheese also was bland. The only flavor it had was the sharp cheddar used on top which wasn't a lot and some parts of the lobster seemed to be seasoned but the bechamel sauce made me cringe with every bite. I absolutely wanted this dish especially to overwhelm me. Next up we're the Brussels sprouts. Oh gosh. You take the one vegetable that is not naturally appealing, add honey and butter, because what is better then salty and sweet right? And completely ruin them. I would have preferred this raw in comparison which should attest to how wrong they were. Where was the sweet honey flavor? The bacon pieces were present but maybe they were old? Because it sure didn't taste like bacon. Oh and let's not forget the pool of grease aka bacon fat this dish was swimming in. It's as if the sprouts were cooked on their own and then plated in a pool of bacon grease and sprinkled with bacon pieces left over from brunch earlier. Lastly, the rib eye and the petite rib eyes. Ordered medium were cooked to perfection and had a dollop of what must have been herb butter on top. Ruth's Chris maybe next time season all of your other dishes with that herb butter. That would be a win or at least a start. This entire meal aside from the steak was a huge let down, so much so I didn't even want the traditional birthday dessert. Sigh. In my opinion this place is overhyped and simply not worth it. Unless maybe on someone else's dime and even then I would still protest it. Sorry I cannot give this place higher than 2.

The service was attentive, but odd in that our waited insisted that I make myself a porridge, even though I had no inclination towards having any. \\n\\nAs for the food and drink, they were all very tasty. I started off by getting this funky tea out of the machine in the back called \\"Job's Tears,\\" which was this amazing sweet taro tea. I then got the pork bulgogi combo with the seafood soup. The seafood soup was incredibly tasty, though I was a little freaked out by the big sardine that was laid out for me to place in the soup. The bulgogi was supurb, as it was perfectly tender and spicy. It was all in all a great meal.\\n\\nHowever, I do have to knock off a star because of how I felt after the meal. As with many Asian meals that tasty, I tend to suspect the use of MSG to enhance the flavors of the food. The tell-tale sign for me is how sleepy I get after the meal, as there is a direct correlation. Suffice to say, I was out cold about an hour after eating my meal, and this was about 9PM! I am positive that they used a heavy amount of MSG in their food. Though that may be okay for some, that is a bit od a downer (literally) for me. If you can take MSG, that's cool.

The food was unique but the overall experience was just okay for the price, especially when the majority of dishes were vegetables. \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive wine list.

I told the waitress I'd like something full-bodied but I can enjoy anything from a Zin to a Cab or a Malbec. She brought three taste samples, which is great, but none of them were favorably rated by our table. Most simply passed on wine or chose a beer from their limited bottle list. \\n\\nOne thing that really bothered me was to get the bill with a 20% tip already included. I've never heard of an automatic tip for a group of six, and to have it be 20% is insulting. (I know an 18% group gratuity is common for larger groups). Part of the dinning experience is for the customer to tip according to the service received (and I'm happy to tip over 20% when I think it's warranted).

We got it home and sat down for a family meal and we all had to agree that the jalape√±o and cheese sausage and the ribs were both excellent.  We found the brisket to be a little dry and lacking in flavor but still good. The original sausage was eatable but also somewhat lacking in flavor.  The potato salad while not my mother's was flavorful and perfectly eatable.  The beans and coleslaw both were excellent great flavor.  The peach cobbler was a disappointment it was very lacking in flavor. Overall while I will order from them again I will be selective in what I order. I do think that they are overpriced especially for there brisket and I think making customers order a minimum of five pounds of meat or you won't take their take out order is not the way to get and keep loyal customers."},{"name":"Sing Yee Chinese Restaurant","address":"3779 Sexsmith Road, Suite 2118","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Sing Yee is a casual family owned restaurant where you come here for congee, noodles, comfort Chinese food.

Pattycake's is sort of the antithesis to that experience: their stuff looks homemade and it seems like they'd rather take a risk and make something different that is also delicious instead of maybe putting a treat on the sidelines because it isn't picture perfect to look at.\\n\\nThe first time we went was a Sunday morning and we walked in to the smell of fresh-baked sticky buns coming out of the oven.  They let us know if we would be welcome to have some, but they just needed a few minutes to cool.  We walked over to Cup of Joe across the road and came back a few minutes later to a warm, pecan-crusted sticky bun.  Amazing!  It was love at first bite from thereon out.\\n\\nMy other favorite things I have had since include their vegan buckeye bar and their everything cookie.

Their signature cocktails are good, and I even got a good old fashioned made here. The \\"Fawlty Tower\\" is a sweet/bitter citrus cocktail that's boozy and worth trying.\\n\\nThe ambiance is what you would expect from a Cactus Club, so not much different here.

I don't usually go for veggie food, and I'd eaten there three times before I realized there was no meat on the menu. Likewise, I'm not generally a tequila fan and someone bought me a margarita the first time I was there; it was terrific and packed a wallop. The bartender explained to us that happy hour (which goes til 7PM) is drinks-only because the food is always priced affordably. Gotta love that. HH well drinks are poured strong for $3.25 and micros are only for $3 .\\n\\nI'm crazy about their Venezuelan style empanadas. I usually order the empanada plate (choose 3) which comes with a simple salad that I think is one of the best in town. Mixed greens are drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette and a sprinkling of toasted hazelnuts. The plate also includes the most amazing black beans, cooked with molasses and queso fresco. You can select a side of sauce to go with the empanadas--I recommend the guac. \\n\\nThere's quite a bit of seating on the main floor, but also a lounge upstairs with living room style seating, including a fab shiny gold couch and 3 pinball machines. Looks like a neat place to camp out with a group of friends. There's patio seating out front, which I enjoyed a few times this past summer. Later in the evenings there's a DJ (no cover charge), and during non-DJ times there's a 70's era jukebox where choices range from Pretenders to Poison Idea to Patsy Cline. Something for everyone. \\n\\nOn my last visit to Conquistador I met up with two friends for our annual birthday celebration. One of the ladies was wrapped up in a sweater and a server noticed she looked chilly, came over and offered to turn up the heat. All of the staff there have been very attentive and friendly. We passed around a couple of the drink specials. The passion fruit margarita was delicious and refreshing. My besweatered friend raved about the hot chocolate drink with Nocello (an Italian walnut-hazelnut liqueur), a good choice for a fall evening.  After dinner we shared a mango/mint dessert empanada, which tasted like a mojito and was pretty enough for a picture. \\n\\nConquistador doesn't offer takeout, so go when you have time to grab a margarita and kick back a while.

I really wanted this to rank high on my eating list.  3, that isn't bad, but there are some things that definitely need work.\\n\\nLocation: Could have been a it better, particularly with the traffic, but I didn't mind.  Although the parking lot is a bit small for its crowd, it wasn't too hard finding a space.  \\n\\nThe line:  It really didn't take too long being seated despite the crowd of people waiting.  I think we beat the real crowd, though since there were people spilling out into the parking lot by the time we left.  What really bothers me about their set up is that the line waiting is positioned right over one row of the tables.  People are literally hanging over the shoulder's of those eating closest to the door.  It is a not-well thought out thing they have going there.  They need to either make that wall higher or do some rearranging.  \\n\\nService: Up and down.  Some of the staff were really friendly and nice.  Our server wasn't too bad initially, but it was all down-hill from that point on.  Our server said something that offended the table next to ours and spent the rest of the time trying to kiss-ass to them and neglected the rest of the tables.  When one of our orders came out wrong, the server glanced at it with some confusion, seemed to gestured acknowledgment that it was wrong and walked away not saying anything.  We thought that that the server was going back there to correct the mistake.  We really didn't see that server again until our bill came. She never said a word to us about the mistake. By that point it was useless to mention it. If only she had just mentioned the mistake and apologized, it would have made all the the difference.\\n\\nMenu: The drinks looked enticing.  For an extra couple of dollars, you can get it with liquid nitrogen so that it comes out smoking for a minute.  Pretty gimmicky if you ask me.  The food menu was not particularly so, although some of the sides did sound interesting.  Burgers: they come out a bit more rare than many places.  a Medium comes out more medium-rare and so on and so forth. The buns are nicely toasted etc. The fries were good and so was the mayonnaise that  accompanies it.  I am not a fan of mayonnaise AT ALL, but I LOVED the smokiness of their recipe. The shakes were good, but really nothing to write home about. \\n\\nAll in all, the place is worth a visit if you're in the mood to try something new. Just keep in mind that the sides, shakes, and drinks are better than the burgers.  Also be prepared to be sitting within hands reach of the table next to you and the people waiting in line.

We wanted a place where we could get seats, talk comfortably without being bothered much, and have some good drinks. This fit the bill! \\n\\nWe grabbed some stools in the bar and there were about 3 other people there. One of them was a DJ blasting rap music- it was almost too loud to talk at times, and I wish he had turned it down, especially since none of the 5 people there looked like they wanted to listen to it. We managed to talk anyway, though. We ordered the Original \\"Corona Mariella Rita\\". AMAZING. The margarita was strong, and the Corona was a suspiciously tasty addition. I would probably be back just to drink more of these. The male bartender was friendly and nice. \\n\\nWe ordered another drink, and a female bartender made it for us. I ordered one for me and one for my friend that was going to arrive any second. She told me, \\"I'll need to see her ID before I make it\\", even though there were literally like, 5 people in the bar, and my friend and I were very clearly nowhere near 21 years old. I didn't understand why she couldn't just make it, and then look at my friend's ID before my friend consumed the drink. If that's the policy, fine, but she was sort of obnoxious about it and then stormed off after saying that. The drink she made was full of sour mix and we couldn't taste any tequila. We had trouble swallowing it because it was so sour, and we passed it person-to-person over the next 30 minutes to try to finish it. The next time the male bartender was nearby, we ordered from him again- and the drinks were glorious again, and he was actually friendly (what a concept!). \\n\\nThe only other annoying thing was that the wait staff all congregated by the side of the bar. The restaurant was empty and there were probably 5-10 waitstaff and bartenders. As a group, they seemed somewhat douchey, and it was a bit distracting to have them there staring at us and gossiping about life. \\n\\nOverall, I'd be back again on an off-night to consume more of these fabulous margarita Corona concoctions at the bar. If they turned down the rap music by about 25%, didn't let the waitstaff congregate at the bar, and only allowed friendly bartenders with a strong pour, this place would be heaven. However, I'm pretty sure, based off of the area and what I saw, that you do NOT want to go near here on weekends, cause it seems like the crowd and waitstaff would get beyond douchey."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It was very busy but we got our table very quickly.

It was the standard miso soup you get at lots of sushi places.  Solid.  Then the Salad, which had a tasty tangy dressing and was a nice addition.  The California rolls were standard fair, but on par not exceptional but very good.  The nigiri was really awesome all around.  Nice thick cuts of fish, delicious and tasty.  And the bill was affordable.  Definitely the top Sushi place in the immediate area.\\nThen I ended up going back two days later with a big group, cause everyone wanted to go there.  This time I sampled the Tempura Lunch special.  Same miso soup, same salad.  Tempura was very good.  It is basically just Tempura and rice, but hit the spot for me.  The people I was with ordered a variety of thing, some entrees, Sushi rolls, Bento Boxes.

Fresh vegetables and homemade-tasting dressings. And then on to the main event....\\nChicken, Craisin, Cashew Risotto baked into a Pumpkin. It was easily the BEST thing I have eaten this fall. Perfectly cooked risotto and the amazing textures and flavors of the nuts, craisins, chicken and pumpkin deliciousness.  Amazing.

They also have a value meal of Lunch Plates for several of their specials that come in a handy take out container that can be used for leftovers for a couple of months. \\n\\nMy first meal was of the Drunken Noodles ($8 for lunch $11 for Dinner). They were very good and unique in the fact that they included a lot of vegetables to the dish that I was accustomed to including squash, carrots, and celery. The noodles weren't greasy and the spicy sauce provided a warm blanket throughout the dish. \\n\\nI've gone back and gotten the Fresh Rolls ($7) which were HUGE. I thought they were very tasty but I felt they could've used a little avocado to bring a creamy texture to the carrots, cucumbers and lettuce. The hoisin dipping sauce was addictive and I needed more for the large sizes of the rolls. \\n\\nTo go with the rolls I had the classic comfort food of Chicken Gra Pow ($8). It's a homestyle meal of stir fried minced chicken, string beans, onion and basil leaves with a spicy chili sauce. What makes it a comfort meal is the fried egg that sits atop the dish. When you break the yoke of the egg it's supposed to create this velvety sauce that provides a full mouth feel. However, my egg was totally overdone and no yoke was to be found to help out the sauce. I'm hoping it was due to the steaming that occurs for takeout meals.\\n\\nAll in all the place is great for lunch, reasonable prices, nice decor, friendly staff and above all flavorful food."},{"name":"Chris' Pizza","address":"2911 N Druid Hills Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"We order takeout from here sometimes and have been pleased overall.

We ended up ordering the chicken tibs with tomato fitfit and the medium well kitfo. You can order both dishes with injera (like a rolled up sourdough pancake). The tibs was definitely good, the chicken was tender but still had the charred flavors. I wanted to be adventurous and try the kitfo and I think the waitress was worried for me (she asked if I've tried it before with a concerned look). Despite my second thoughts, I still wanted to give it a try. It's definitely an interesting dish, the meat was half raw/medium well and spiced heavily. The dish is spicy, but you don't feel the spiciness initially and it kicks in later when you've had a few spoonfuls. I'm glad I tried this dish, it wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd get it again (or if I do I'd go for well-done). \\n\\nService was great, the staff here were super friendly.

They actually have heavy duty plastic sheets covering every tablecloth - just like the kind that your deranged octogenarian neighbor used to put over her couch back in the 80's to prevent the cats from pissing on it. The randomness doesn't end at the decor either - some of the patrons looked as if they hadn't seen the light of day in decades. \\n\\nFood: Although this place touts itself as a 'pizza house\\", I'd classify it as more of an Americanized Greek restaurant. The menu is comprised of an array of Greek standards, including spanakopita, falafel, gyro, souvlaki, and mousaka. Pizzas can be ordered in four different sizes: individual (6\\"), small (10\\"), medium (14\\"), and large (16\\"). I had the mezze platter and the medium chicken breast salad during my visit. The mezze platter included hummus, falafel, red peppers, olives, cucumbers, and grilled pita - the ingredients were fresh and well-portioned, but still not worth the $12 price tag. The salad was advertised as being portioned for two, but I found it to be an appropriate size for a single entree - it was by no means the best greek salad I've ever ingested, but it was acceptable for the price ($8.50).\\n\\nService: Friendly and attentive. The place was packed during our Friday evening visit, but the waitstaff were on their game and capable of handling the volume. The appetizer arrived almost immediately - however, the wait for the entree was slightly longer than expected, which I think might have been due to the pizza that my dining partner ordered. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The decor is incredibly bizarre - to the point where you expect the Candid Camera crew to emerge at any minute. The center of the restaurant is occupied by a large waterless fountain surrounded by plants and various other random decor items. Unsuspecting patrons should also note that you have to walk through the kitchen in order to access the bathrooms - one would hope that there were public health laws prohibiting this, but apparently not. \\n\\nCost: Moderately priced. Appetizers are $3-$12, salads (small to large) are $4-$16, pizzas (individual to large) $5-$20, entrees are $5-$15, and desserts are $2-$4.50. \\n\\nOther: Chris' Pizza House is located in the Toco Hills Shopping Plaza. Breakfast is not served, but brunch is available on Saturday and Sunday from 10AM to 2PM. In addition to dine-in service, catering and online takeout ordering (Eat24) are also available.

Superb service. Cozy atmosphere. Loads of potential. Beautiful food. Needs tweaking.\\n\\nUsually going out for a fancy meal on a Friday launches me into a spiral of dread. I'm haunted by visions of leatherneck turbos and proto-yuppies with hair gel and shaved chests mucking about. But Barley Swine was a pleasant jaunt all around.\\n\\nOur standout dish was the sweetbreads. My human dining partner described it as one of the best things she'd eaten in years. I concur. It's a screamingly creative collage. The softness of the sweetbreads, the crispiness of the bacon, and slight sourness of the brussel sprouts merge seamlessly. We treasured every bite. It's worth going just to eat it. \\n\\nYet other dishes, while exciting, lacked integration and coherence. Example: the foie gras. Each individual element was excellent, but the whole ensemble amounted to less than the sum of the parts. The soft foie oozed with flavor, but why add a spanish tortilla? Not like it was bad, but it just had no place on that plate. The result is a missed opportunity and it prevents the dish from elevating to truly excellent. \\n\\nSimilarly, the beef risotto dish just didn't harmonize. The beef was perfect, tender, rare, delicious. The risotto showed a creative flair: punchy and gamey flavor, al dente. But together? They just didn't blend. It was a shotgun marriage. \\n\\nThe brussel spouts appetizer was good, though perhaps a tad over-charred. Obviously that's the point of the dish, but really, it's like 20% too far--to the point that the freshness of the vegetable morphs into a heap of carbon ash. In spite of that, we ate the whole cup and enjoyed it. A dash more of sauce on the sprouts might add a kick.\\n\\nFinally, the rabbit stew was really quite excellent. A heaping portion, and our second favorite tasting of the night. Sweet carrots and turnips, savory grits, with the rabbit meat and juices weaving the dish together. It again showed the tremendous potential of this restaurant when it executes.\\n\\nService was superb. As a miserable misanthrope who usually recoils in horror at having to deal with waiters, let me declare: The Barley Swine staff is phenomenally well-trained. Our waitress was attentive but never pushy, informative but not annoying; the food came out quickly (even on a Friday); and they adjusted our reservation with ease. For a brand new restaurant to show such snag-free service is remarkable. \\n\\nAnd the atmosphere is festive and loud, though not obnoxious. The communal tables didn't even annoy me. If you knew me, you'd understand how amazing that is. Beer list is great, but absurdly expensivo. Sure, a healthy alcohol price markup is part of dining out, but this was beyond the edge of the appropriate bell-curve for my tastes. I'm a beer nut but didn't even bother ordering one because the prices were so ridiculous. I can get the same beer at The Draught House for a fraction of the cost. This can be fixed and should be.\\n\\nOverall, a very good meal. It's a neat spot. Expensive for the portions? Sure. That's what you get for eating hoity-toity gourmet food. Is it worth it? Well, I'll be back.\\n\\nChef Gilmore is an artist brimming with ideas, many of them brilliant. When the dishes integrate, it's near genius. When they don't, they're still solid.

I came to Gourdough's Public House with a couple of girlfriends later on a Saturday night. I had previously been to the trailer maybe three times, so I was familiar with the fact that it was yummy and was interested in seeing how the brick & mortar turned out. The place itself is gorgeous. Very very dark, but the design of the restaurant was unspeakably well thought out. \\nEach of my friends and I ordered ourselves one of the specialty cocktails and a sweet donut. Now, I can understand wanting to do something that isn't on the trailer menu, but if I can be frank with you guys I think that's kind of stupid. Of course the donut burger wasn't phenomenal. This is a brand new area of food and these guys, as experienced as they may be in the donut realm, are just starting to get their toes wet. I'd say once they've been open for a year or so you start venturing into the crazy stuff. For now? Get what works while they work out the kinks. \\nNow, those cocktails? They're pretty damn pricey. I don't mind paying for a good cocktail, but I'd warmly suggest that they put a couple of slightly easier on the pocketbook items on the drink menu.\\nDo I really need to tell you that the donuts were amazing?

Luckily my honey was pleased with his food, but sadly I was pretty disappointed with the bland fish pasta I was served.  The dish was dull and what few flavors there were did not blend well together. The final nail in the coffin was the plain soft scrambled egg which comprised the \\"sauce\\" of this dish.  Don't picture the lovely fried farm eggs of Odd duck or the other dishes on the menu, picture completely liquid egg used as sauce.  So...plain, raw egg, mustard and fish flavor.  Maybe this appeals to someone's palate but it was not pleasing to mine.  This dish knocked off a star off what would have been a five star review.  I am really rooting for Barley Swine because I love Odd Duck and because I think that this one icky dish is just a kink in their overall plan.  I will keep trying Barley Swine until they perfect the menu (...and hopefully ditch the fish pasta.)"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Give me alllll the truffle fries!!

I think I am a fan of the Atlantic Station location more than this one, though. The atmosphere is cool (we sat outside in the Battery) as well as the decor; very modern and inviting. The host didn't seem to have it together because all of us waiting on a table were confused by everything he was saying. I think he needs a tad bit help with organization. The food was phenomenal, just small. I have to say that was my real problem. My group was so excited to see the Poke nachos. I had never heard of them, but my friends swore by them and how much you get. Everyone ordered some along with an array of appetizers for us to share and taste. I could count how many nachos were on the plate. When have you ever been able to see through to the plate of an order of nachos? And when we asked the waitress, she was so uninterested as if she didn't care. That's when I was over it. It was very good, don't get me wrong. I just know I didn't get enough. I'll be going back to the other location from now on. They're extremely nice and accommodating!"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Decent burgers.

Maria's is a great example of why I should keep doing that.\\n\\nTo be honest, I had walked by many times and never noticed this place. However, after a night of festivities and subsequent late-night hunger, a friend recommended this place. What followed was a glorious indulgence of meat and salsa.\\n\\nThe venue is small but the options are plenty, albeit standard for Mexican. Whether you want a taco or a tostada, you will find the prices are right and the portions are generous. I find that compared to chains, especially Chipotle, one can get more authentic food here and more meat per serving, all for less money.\\n\\nI've had Maria's three times thus far, and the flavor has been inconsistent. I don't know if it was because my senses were temporarily altered, if my memory betrayed me, or if they were having a bad day, but my most recent trip left me someone disappointed. The food was still good, but it was not the oral explosion I had remembered from a few weeks prior. In any case - that won't stop me from making a fourth trip here in the near future, especially since they are open relatively late.\\n\\n(^_^) Options\\n(^_^) Open late\\n(^_-) Flavor\\n(^_^) Service\\n(^_^) Bang for buck\\n\\n[4.5 rounded down for possible inconsistency]\\n\\nGlad I came.

The food has some interesting thought put behind it, particularly things like the Ahi Tuna burger. My favorite is the Primetime, which features Texas Akaushi beef, and the fresh buns are a nice treat.\\n\\nHowever, a part of me feels like they're trying a bit too hard with their burger toppings. The meat and bread are good, but the topping selection often smothers out the basic, good flavors of the burgers. In a word, they're doing too much with good material and not able to take advantage of its quality to the fullest. I feel like maybe toning down some of the burger toppings or rethinking their flavor profiles might actually be in their best interests.\\n\\nSecond, the pricing is a bit steep. I grant that a lot of it is because of the care and local sourcing of the ingredients, but this just brings me back to the point before. For all the quality of the ingredients, I don't think the end product justifies the price tag.\\n\\nStill, it's a lovely spot to go for a date, or just a bit of an evening with friends, especially given their nice brew selection."},{"name":"Cafe Paisano","address":"182 W State Rd 434, Ste 1000","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Food and wine good.

This place is relatively new and is located where Goldfish used to be (next door to the Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter Mall). There was no wait time at 6pm on a Monday, but I noticed people waiting for tables as we were leaving around 8pm. \\n\\nThe ambiance is casual and fun. Be sure to check out the whimsical artwork on the walls which is a Cowfish take on everything from Bob Ross to Minecraft. \\n\\nService was a little bit slow, but really friendly. My only complaint would be that the server wasn't up to date on which beers were in stock, and it took a while to get refills. That said, the food came out promptly and piping hot. \\n\\nThe Crab Rangoon Dip ($11) was a hit with everyone at the table. It's basically deconstructed crag rangoon, with the cheesy crab filling served in a ramekin and the wonton skins served as chips on the side. Really yummy, but disproportionately served. (We had an entire plateful of the wonton chips when we were done.) Recommended.\\n\\nThe Crispy Calamari \\"T & T\\" ($12) was just OK. Nothing to complain about, but this calamari tastes like most other decent restaurants' calamari. \\n\\nFor dinner I tried The Ultimate \\"Brento\\" Bento Box ($18), which was a great way to sample a bit of everything. The Bento boxes (on the \\"Burgooshi\\" menu) are a combo of both burgers and sushi. This particular bento came with two slider-sized double-stack burgers, four sushi maki, sweet potato fries and a really yummy cucumber-red onion salad. I tried the Blackened Tuna Roll as my sushi selection and really enjoyed it, though the pieces were so big I had to eat them in several bites. (Also - it's not listed on the menu but the server let us know that with this bento option you can choose from any of the \\"Fusion Specialty\\" rolls, not just the three options listed on the menu.)\\n\\nThe menu was so large I had a hard time deciding what to get, and after such a good first impression I'll be back to try some more of the fusion items - and another serving of the crab rangoon dip!"},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Truva is a very nice Turkish restaurant.

Their smoothies are virtually identical in both taste and texture to a milkshake (made with frozen instead though), and this is a plus for me (I confess, during my early days here I got the mixed berry shake instead, it was probably not until my third week that I tried the smoothie out of concern for my heart, and was delighted it tasted no different).\\n\\nSo I can't speak to anything else on the menu, but I've never had a bad experience here and come often.
