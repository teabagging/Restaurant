None of the food dishes blew me away, the food selection was not great, the service was pretty poor and the ambiance could be greatly improved. It needs to be a little bit darker during dinner seating in my opinion.\\n\\nBefore visiting the restaurant I was under the impression that diners would select dishes from a menu that would then be brought out and explained by the chef, which sounds great but was not the case. Here you are given a menu, don't order anything, and are randomly shown dishes by the creating chef to then say yay or nay while they hold the plate in front of you. This lends itself to some strange moments where it feels like the chefs are salesmen and need to hit some type of nightly quota of dishes purchased. Not only that, since there is no waiter in between you and your food it all comes out at random times. We had been seated and had looked at the drink menu for about 30 seconds before we were being shown a dish. We of course said no to this dish as we were still attempting to figure out what to drink, and then never saw the dish again for the rest of the night. \\n\\nThe other big failure in my opinion was the bar cart. When looking at pictures or reviews it sounded like the bar cart would be pushed directly next to you, cocktails explained and then made right on the spot. This was not the case. The bar cart bartender will serve you your first drink, but the cart was positioned 4 tables away from us out of sight, so it might as well have been made from the regular bar. All cocktails after the first order are then made at the regular bar. And just a heads up, don't order the green strawberry caipirinha -- it taste like a Naked Green Machine with vodka, very mediocre drink. \\n\\nIf I were to have to answer the \\"Net Promoter\\" type question about Gunshow (\\"Would you recommend to a friend\\" ), I would have to give this a NO unfortunately.

We visited on a Sunday around 6. Was greeted warmly and seated immediately. Very sparse but modern decor, good music from what I assume is satellite radio (was expecting Asian music but this was way better). Seemed like a family run place. Silverware and glasses were clean, floors were clean as well. The menu is at least 8 pages, be prepared for some tough choices. When quizzed our waiter had to ask a coworker what the \\"triple delight\\" contained (menu seems too big, maybe they should focus on a smaller set of specialties?). For appetizers we had fried wontons and an egg roll. They were served piping hot, crunchy and delicious on a bed of lettuce. As a former fry cook it tasted and looked like the cooking oil was clean and fresh,  a sign of a well run kitchen. We had the hibachi chicken and the triple delight (beef, chicken, shrimp in a brown sauce). I discovered that I am not a fan of the brown sauce on the triple delight, it's rather boring stuff. The hibachi chicken was supposed to be grilled yet I did not see any grill marks nor taste any kind of grilling... we wished we had chosen the teriyaki hibachi chicken instead as the regular hibachi chicken seemed bland. The rice for both dishes came in it's own little bowl and was steaming hot and super sticky, perfect for eating with chopsticks, yum! The hibachi meals are a solid dinner choice for the thrifty diner as you get a small salad (lettuce was fresh, colorful, crunchy) with yummy ginger dressing and a bowl of soup. We chose the wonton soup and it was very tasty with little rings of tasty green onions floating in the broth and a total of 3 wontons. Soda was served in a can and cost $2.00 each, wtf? We had a coupon from a recent living social deal so that was our motivation for trying this place.

We had a super friendly and super attentive waiter that made the meal that much nicer.

Overall the atmosphere of the restaurant felt like they were going for upscale seafood shack, but the clientele were not quite buying into it. \\n\\nThe food was very hit or miss. The hush puppies were absolutely amazing! They give you a good amount of hush puppies with your meal, and I would have eaten more they were so tasty! They tasted like they had some garlic, cheese, and parsley and they were perfectly fried to a golden brown. We also got the bang bang shrimp, which were very good. Little popcorn shrimp fried up in a sweet and spicy sauce and served up on a bed of lettuce, they were a great appetizer. I got the fried seafood platter with fried shrimp and scallops, and it was pretty good. The seafood itself was cooked well and tasted fresh, which is impressive for scallops. They didn't at all have that milky taste that frozen shrimp often does, I was very impressed. But the fried seafood was a bit greasy, a sign that they weren't cooked in oil hot enough. Instead of being crunchy the breading was soggy and fell off, which was a disappointment since the seafood was otherwise tasty. I would definitely order a different seafood dish next time I go. Oddly enough though the fries were cooked to a perfect crispiness and weren't soggy at all - the fries were actually really good. And it was all served with an amazingly delicious remoulade. I ended up taking the breading off the seafood and just eating it all dipped in the delicious remoulade. \\n\\nOverall it was a great dinner at a restaurant that hasn't figured out it's atmosphere yet.

I give them a lot of slack, because, hey, they need to work the bugs out. But... I have had lots of Greek food in lots of places, but this is not Greek food. Not even close.\\n\\nThe Food: I got a gyro and a side Greek salad to go. \\n\\nI got a thimble (literally the portion size) of dressing for my half slice of tomato and two olives on a bed of lettuce. The salad is otherwise not worth mentioning. \\n\\nThe gyro was awful. Just. Awful. The pita bread was more like a flatbread. It was doughy, fell apart easily, had no texture or taste, and was blindingly white. The gyro had shredded iceberg lettuce with browned edges, the tomato was a single slice of tasteless, mushy, and unripe filler. But the true offense was the gyro meat. I don't know how anyone can go wrong with gyro meat. Pop it onto the spit, turn on the burner, start spinning. There are plenty of New York street vendors and pretty much every other Greek place in Austin that do it better. They clearly don't use a burner. I don't want to give much thought to what the meat actually is, but somehow it was almost flavorless. I am not exaggerating when I say I had to force myself to finish.\\n\\nThe \\"salad bar\\" is next to where you pickup orders. It was depressing to look at.\\n\\nThe Place:\\n\\nI almost turned around and left when I opened the door. At first, I thought maybe there had been some sort of restroom overflow problem. It may have been the smell of the \\"gyro\\" meat. I don't know, but I've never smelled a Greek restaurant like that. There are 4 scattered tables and two \\"bars\\" on the walls. The stools are too short and put the bar top under your armpits. The place appears unfinished, with lots of visible problems merely painted over. The divider between the front and the kitchen appears to be a piece of naughahyde or similar material that someone has inexpertly ripped into individual pieces. There must also surely be a better way of advertising that you have a Facebook page than with a piece of notebook paper that someone's tween daughter clearly hung next to the tv. Also, protip: don't put the Food network on in a restaurant. Your food can't compete with the visuals on tv.\\n\\nThe Staff and the Service: \\n\\nMy interaction with them was limited to ordering, but I was not encouraged when I saw someone clear a table but not wipe it. I can get a gyro to go in about 60 secs most places I've ever gone. Five minutes is a bit much when only 7 people are in the place.\\n\\nThe Price:\\n\\n6.99 for a gyro is pricey and is approximately $2 more than competitor's prices. For a truly awful gyro, its criminally overpriced. \\n\\nConclusion: You couldn't pay me to go again.

Also, if you ever raise the courage to decline a plate, you will see a tear roll down the server's face as if Smokey the Bear just witnessed a forest fire. If you turn it down, you have lost your chance. The plates themselves are small dishes, not easily divided among the members of the table either, just sort of awkwardly left to the diners to evenly distribute the Oliver Twist sized portion. If you want two, you need to decide immediately, before you taste it. If you decide later you'd like seconds, too bad, you had your chance.\\n\\n2) They have a menu with 10 or 11 delicious cocktails. While they have essentially all of the ingredients that a well stocked bar would have, you may only order a drink from the menu. The first drink is made on a cart- again, you must wait for the bartender to acknowledge you. All subsequent drinks must be made through your server. The drinks are made to order, but if you, like my pregnant wife, prefer a non-alcoholic version, you're out of luck. The artistic integrity of the traveling bartender cannot be compromised- we, as mere visitors are fortunate to sit in the shadows of such giants. They do have a few coke products you can choose from though.\\n\\n3) DID YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR PARTY WHILE YOU'RE EATING DINNER? TOO BAD- THEY REALLY LIKE PLAYING LOUD MUSIC.\\n\\n4) Between each course, they give you a new plate. They place the silverware on the table while exchanging the dishware. After my fork with mashed potato residue was set on the bare table, I asked for a new one. The waiter's response, \\"just lick it dude.\\" Although, to be fair, after I apologized profusely for daring to speak to an officer of the Schutzstaffel, he did bring me a new fork. First time for everything, I'm sure.\\n\\nOverall, the food was incredible.

We understood that this was a more \\"up scale, fine dining experience\\" and it was.  The dining room has a very pleasant atmosphere and certainly much more sedate.

The soup was, however, tasty. \\nMy duck entree was prepared well as was my wife's grilled beef tenderloin. \\nOverall, the restaurant is pleasant but perhaps not worth the money they get.  If you are at Epcot, Le Cellier in Canada is a much better bet for the same dollar value. If you want to have French, try downstairs.  A bit noisier but less pretentious and a larger variety appetizer and entree selection.

I had a gluten-free, vegan cinnamon bun with icing and I'm worried I might be ruined for regular ones now. The bun has big chunks of pecans on top and the most delicious filling. I also tried a chocolate cookie (bang on) and a slice of pepperoni pizza (for the non-vegan gluten avoider). The pizza was pretty good but the crust definitely could've used the extra gluten. Sweet baked goods seems to be their wheelhouse. They don't serve coffee but allow you to bring your own in from nearby Matchstick Coffee. I understand the reasoning for this but it isn't the most convenient thing as a customer. I would recommend they offer a basic drip.

I looked up some Yelp reviews, but you know that sometimes the reviews are a bit mixed. I am a lobster mac and cheese lover, and when I saw that they had this, and some people had ordered it, I said \\"eh. why not?\\". The place is expensive, but casual. They also had a wait, but it was about 45 minutes. The bar/lounge area is first come, first serve, so we ended up stalking a table until they left. [Don't judge. I said we were pretty hungry]. \\n\\nI ordered the raw tuna appetizer, and it was delicious. The sauce and the sesame seeds really compliment each other. The amount of wasabi they put on your plate is a bit overwhelming.\\n\\nI wasn't too thrilled about the fish entrees they had, so I just decided to get the mac and cheese along with a lobster bisque soup. Unfortunately neither of them were to my liking. The mac and cheese tasted like if it was from a box. In fact, the Kraft mac and cheese tastes a bit better. The cheese was dry, and did not have much taste. I'm sorry-- but I was really hoping that it would be an A+. Not even close. \\n\\nThe lobster bisque, oh the horror! It tasted like milk more than lobster, it was a yellowish color instead of the reddish/pinkish color that I am normally used to. So, this was also a disappointment. I didn't even eat half of it. \\n\\nThe bread was pretty amazing though, but it only comes if you order an entr√©e. What's up with that??!!! Another disappointment. You also get a salad with your entr√©e.. which was also pretty good. \\n\\nOh, I forgot to mention the wine. We both ordered Estancia which is a Merlot from CA; that was actually pretty delicious!!\\n\\nOK, so now for the meat eaters:\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the Kansas City steak, which apparently had the best reviews for being the \\"juiciest steak\\". Although she did confirm that it had awesome flavor, she said it should've been the \\"fattiest steak\\" instead. She had to literally cut off a piece of fat before every single bite.

Did not get meal for about 1 1/2 hours and had to get manager involved. Food had obviously been sitting under the warmer for a really long time, it was not hot, just warm. Baked potato would not melt the butter. And, no, I am not complaining in order to stiff the waitress. We left her our usual tip. It's just eating out is expensive.

It was a group of 10 for a Saturday night. Surprisingly, the place was quite empty at the restaurant side, the bar was hopping though. The service that our waitress provided was very poor. Instead of taking all of our drink orders at once, she would do two people at a time, go back to grab the drinks, and then take another order. That left us quite puzzled. Maybe she was nervous, I don't know, but it was ridiculous. She was going to do the same when it was time to take our food orders. Then she messed up some of our orders, there were some food that they ran out of, which was one of their most famous food items. That was quite disappointing. And the worst of it all was that we specifically requested for separate checks per couple, and we ended up having one bill. I believe she did it on purpose so we would have to pay tip (groups bigger than 6). I read from previous reviews here that they have tried to put the tip in the bill before. The waitress apologized for it. So I figured out what everyone owed and wrote each amount with the credit card that it was supposed to be on. There were six cards. The owner (I believe she was, or the manager), this older lady with white/blond hair came out and said that they only take two cards. We were looking at each other, if you can swipe two cards, why not six? One of our friends works as a manager at another restaurant and he was puzzled as well. The owner said it was our fault for not telling the waitress in the beginning for separate checks, which we did, and that it was an \\"inconvenience\\" for her to have to swipe 6 cards. Can you believe this? I actually did all the work figuring out how much everyone owed, all she had to do is swipe each card with the amount displayed. I guess she was just lazy. But the owner was very rude and unprofessional. She literally said \\"IF you decide to come back, you need to tell the waitress to do separate checks first\\"....IF? Well, I'll tell you this now, I will NEVER come back, and none of the other nine people will too. One of those nine was a regular at the restaurant, so they just lost a regular as well. I don't know how the lunch service is, but the dinner service was the worst.

Unfriendly, rude, doesn't seem to want your business (i.e.. why are you here?) unless you order a full dinner w/drinks. Ate there several times with my daughter in early summer09. during her illness. When she died earlier this year, at age 44, I went back to Moulton's in Feb11 for the memory of having been there w/my daughter and to sit at the same table. Ordered appetizers w/glass of wine to toast my daughter's memory. Could sense that the owner, white bearded Bob, did not like my small order. Went back four more times to try different appetizers and once a clam roll as a change. Had the same treatment by the owner albeit the young waiter did provide service. The last time after working 14 hrs. on my daughter's estate probate and very tired I walked through the bar and into the dining room. The owner surrounded by his regulars at the bar shouted at me why couldn't I read the wait to be seated sign. I thanked him for his rudeness, commented that I had spent over $100 (actually $104.30 in five meals or $20.86/meal) in the last two months, and  did not intend to return. He replied that he really didn't care. I have always tried to support local neighborhood independent businesses especially restaurants w/good quality fare. I am from the Pacific Northwest and find that Moulton's serves very average quality seafood. So I am not sure how its high rating of its food by some reviewers is justified. Being the only average quality seafood place in Medford may be the reason. Each time I entered the place, I thought that the owner's attitude would change over time. Ironically just became more rude each time I ate there. His smoking in the kitchen was also a health concern.

After about thirty minutes, our meals came out with about a five minute lag between my plate and my parents' plates. My mother had potatoes au gratin. I had faux potatoes au gratin that were clearly saut√©ed potato chunks with melted cheese on top (still tasty). When my dad's plate came out, it had mashed potatoes on it.

I have been to Carrabba's a few times in the past and wasn't too impressed but also wasn't as disappointed as I was this time. Upon entrance we were not greeted by any host or server for at least 5 minutes. Finally someone came over to us and sat us without any apology. Our server was rude from the start and more concerned with socializing with another server as she was at our table! I asked for the specials, which she was not sure of. I ordered a Sicilian sangria which was pretty good. For my entree I ordered the chicken Bryan. When it arrived I was completely shocked to find out that it was still raw and I noticed this from a piece I was chewing on! Immediately we flagged down a server (not our own because she was nowhere to be found). Patrick the manager came to our table and told us he would have another one prepared, but was not very apologetic, he left me with the impression that it was my fault the chicken was undercooked. My date asked if there was anything else that could be done for the situation and Patrick hesitatingly offered us a free dessert which was the sogno. It arrived to our table terrible looking and falling apart. The server had a smirk on her face as if it was intentional. I really do not understand why this nightmare occurred. I am a very kind person especially in restaurant settings because I too have worked in their shoes. My date was so embarrassed for the incident. The entire atmosphere of this Carrabba's felt so unprofessional and uncomfortable, almost like what you would expect from Steak-N-Shake. I felt the most uncomfortable with Patrick and I am considering how to go about contacting human resources about him."},{"name":"Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"930 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Awesome place!

Well, the sauce was creamy and had sliced mushrooms in it. . .but it came out WAY, WAY too salty and did't have any mushroom taste at all.  (I assume the cook might have accidentally put in too much salt because I DOUBT if it was actually intended to taste the way it did.)  Meanwhile, my friend had better luck.  He ordered \\"Fleischkase with Fried Egg\\", one of three specials listed on the blackboard.  It was a pan-fried slice of porkloaf topped with a fried egg.  He really liked it a lot, but we were amused by how much it looked exactly like a pan-fried slice of Spam!  (That's OK though. . .I like Spam.)  For our side dishes, we both chose the pan-fried spatzli, which is always good.  So, the overly salty mushroom cream sauce I got tonight was definitely a bummer, but that's not going to stop me from going back to Swiss Hibiscus.

I thought this place was going to be just as great at the restaurant with the same name located downtown, but I was sorely mistaken. First of all, they seemed to be understaffed on a Saturday night which is ridiculous not only because of the day of the week but also because there are several hotels in the vicinity. We were seated at a high top table by the bar but also by an emergency door that was not alarmed so many people kept going in an out which was annoying because it was freezing that day. Yes we could have asked to be moved, but again, it was a Saturday night and they were packed and understaffed. I mean it took for ever for the waiter to come over and get our drink orders. And then when he took the order he didn't wait to see if we needed appetizers so we had to wait again. Same thing happened with our dinner order. My friend's husband had to get up three times to go get the waiter when we needed something like a drink refill. As for the food; not good. I got the lobster mac n cheese and it was dry and was missing a lot of the cheese. My friends' food were also subpar. Now, on to the ambiance; the bar area had tv's as any bar area should. However, one was on a blank channel like the signal was lost, one was on some absurd reality show and the other was on a sport. Someone had to ask to have the channel changed off of the reality show.

Over the years, the food has gotten progressively worse and the service, less and less friendly. Also, I want to point out that I have no misgivings about buffet sushi. I know what it is and what it should be and I am not proud to say that I have at times...enjoyed it. When you want to get in touch with your own biggest loser, there is no better way than all-you-can-eat seafood! So now, with all of that out the way, on to the review. \\n\\nI have eaten Sushi all over the U.S. at places where you had to mortgage the house for a piece of Toro to places like Ru San's that make eating fish out of the tank at Petsmart look attractive. \\n\\nAs far as the fish at Ru's is concerned, the nigiri is the best part, but it tends to sit there and get really dry because it doesn't get turned over regularly. They offer a selection of fried rolls that are mostly rice with a small piece of overcooked fish and usually a touch of avocado. Some of the pieces lately have been really fishy and after eating there this week, I have had some serious stomach issues. To top it all off, the restaurant now has an odd smell when you walk in, almost like a gym locker room. Not sure what that is about.\\n\\nOverall, I feel like Ru San's is like sleeping with a cheap hooker: temporarily satisfying, but after a while, you just feel gross and there is a possibility that you may get sick later."},{"name":"Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"930 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We went here Friday night for dinner, I had to make a reservation three weeks prior to get the 7:00pm sitting.\\n\\nThe food was good (although I'm not a red meat eater), the service was prompt and made me feel a bit rushed, the whole meal took only an hour or so.

Finally called one of the staff over to pour a few glasses. \\n\\n- Waiting 10 minutes at the table before the \\"waiter-helper\\" showed up with some water and cold bread. No olive oil that night.\\n\\n- Waiting 15 minutes before the waiter put in an appearance. Looking back, this was our chance to get the hell out of there, but it was late, my parents were overly optimistic, and I was starving. \\n\\n- Three people, one set of silverware. The first time we saw the waiter we told him we needed more silverware. When my parents' salads arrived, still no silverware. The waiter said \\"Oh yeah, that'll be right out\\" and then completely disappeared. My father used my mother's fork to eat his salad. Of course we could've walked out, but we thought we were too deep into it now. Big mistake.\\n\\n- Waiter finally reappeared to deliver the food. When reminded that we still didn't have silverware, he says, \\"Oh, they didn't bring that out?\\" So he's trying to say it's waiter-helper's fault. About 5 more minutes passes with me and my father staring at our food when I notice another waiter-helper / busboy wandering around with two sets of silverware looking at everybody's table trying to figure out where the hell he's supposed to take it. Apparently our waiter is too good to drop off some silverware. At this point I'm starting to think we're on Candid Camera.\\n\\n- After we got our silverware, the waiter performed another disappearing act and wasn't seen until we'd finished the food and asked for the check. By that point, I'd gotten up to get the water pitcher myself and refilled our glasses. We weren't asked once if we wanted more wine or water, etc. Basically the waiter just gave up.\\n\\n- As I was busy looking for hidden cameras, I suddenly realized how mediocre the food was, and actually always has been.  It's \\"meh, okay\\" food and until this time I've always been able to stomach it because of the setting. I'm all about supporting local, independent establishments but this is ridiculous.

The fish and chips are always good and they have menu items you don't find at most venues (like bangers & mash or the Sheppard's pie) Their Ice Cream shop at the end of the building is wonderful. Ice cream flavors are often unusual and made in house.\\nNEGATIVES: bathrooms are super small and awkward for ladies.

So yes, Lime chicken with white rice, black beans and a sampling of their guac and minimal salsa. Wow. I was actually quite impressed. For ingredients, I gotta say they blow Chipotle out of the water.. the chicken was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Everything else was a tad mild, except the guac which had a little zip in it, but toned down for most palletes. I liked it.. after schlepping all day in the oppressively humid heat, and sweating out any and all energy , a something substantial was needed but at the same time this felt very light, unlike their competitors whom can leave you more than satisfied but feeling like a nap. Bathrooms here though were less than nice. It seemed like you could hear everything happening in the kitchen and I don't want to say they were filthy bathrooms, but they definitely weren't clean...seat covers please!!  I will give this chain another shot next time and get something way out of my comfort zone because it looks really interesting ."},{"name":"Cheerful Tortoise","address":"1939 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"This is near PSU - college town on Portland.

I loved it, it was a great compliment to the margaritas.\\nFor an additional app we ordered the queso and added guacamole.\\nFor the main course I had the chicken burrito with verde sauce. At Liz's suggestion I opted for fajita meat for a slight up charge. Bb had the beef burrito with fajita meat which was some kind of skirt steak I think. Both burritos came with a generous helping of refried beans and Mexican rice, as well as some guac, and a bit of lettuce and tomato. \\nThe queso was pretty fabulous - how could you go wrong with melted cheese and guacamole!?\\nI really enjoyed my beast of a burrito and believe the fajita style is the way to go. I guess otherwise it's some kind of shredded chicken. The verde sauce was top notch and I stuffed myself to the gills. I tried the boy's burrito and felt mine was a clear winner. The steak was tough - too chewy to actually break down. \\nOur food came out really fast. By the time we were ready for another round of drinks the place was packed and Liz and her partner (only 2 severs on the floor as far as I could see) were really hustling.

Enjoy...and subscribe for more of my spicy \\"torture,\\" lol. :-) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSDhnRxCgLw)\\n_______________\\n\\nThe cart has earned its elite stripes!\\n\\nThey are now at the Green Castle food pod, which boasts a seriously great food cart lineup (Holy Cannoli, Picnic, GF Chef, Homegrown Smoker, etc.). With the grand opening coming soon, it seemed perfect to construct a food challenge for this cart. I soon discovered that Jason and Rusty had been wanting to plan their own challenge for a while, so it was the ideal meeting of the minds. Of course, it would need to be a spicy challenge -- of spicochistic proportions.\\n\\nJason and I spent some time putting the pieces together for this spicochist challenge. Fire chicken, kalua pork with fire sauce, spam in fire sauce, and eggs. Heck, even the scoop rice and scoop of mac salad would get habanero powder. We added a sweet roll as well (no heat added...yay?).\\n\\nWhat's in fire sauce? The gamut of Dave's Insanity sauces, their pineapple habanero sauce, some sambal, and habanero powder. Honestly, getting to record Jason's reaction to the fire sauce fumes was worth the cost.\\n\\nWhen I beta tested it, it was a 4-pound kanak attack waiting to happen; we had also added a pork cutlet sandwich with...more fire sauce in it. I had an hour to do it.\\n\\nI flew out of the gates to attack the kalua pork and chicken. I mixed in bites of everything, sipping my Powerade Zero (yay mixed berry flavor!). Although I had the usual runny nose and facial sweat combo from eating spicy food, my mouth really didn't feel much. Odd how that happens.\\n\\nI underestimated the heaviness of all the challenge components and basically hit an impenetrable food wall with about 30-35 minutes remaining. I likely made a huge mistake by not tackling the pork cutlet sandwich at the start. Just so heavy -- and the pork cutlet may get drier and tougher to eat as time passes.\\n\\nAfter my unfortunate loss, we lowered the poundage on the challenge to ~3 lbs, but no dairy. We're thinking 45 minutes for this one, but it could go down to 30, who knows. It's already delicious, so hungry spicy pandas should be able to KO this one by then.\\n\\nOutstanding food, as usual. I finally got to eat their kalua pork, and man, give me that in fire sauce any day. I always test the mac salad for that true taste of Hawaii, and this version was a huge winner.\\n\\nI won't lie, this challenge produced spicy aftereffects the following morning. So that everything's out in the open, I refrained from any Pepto/Tums before or after the challenge. Having that on hand probably could have prevented or lessened such evil sensations.\\n\\nIt looks like they will get a lot of business at the Green Castle pod.

The flour tortillas were not home made or even a good store bought kind. The carne guisada was tender and that's about the only good thing I can say about. The meats were very bland. Thank goodness for the salsa, which just tasted like a tostitos salsa, or there would be no flavor. Even the beans just tasted like beans...

So, I decided to order a light dinner which consisted of linguine and clams and fried calamari.  They allow you to order appetizer portions of the pasta entrees, and our waitress was very good at informing me that the fried calamari was one of the larger appetizers that is normally shared.  \\n\\nAll I can say is that the pasta was super delicious. The lemon butter sauce was just the right consistency of lemon and butter, not heavy at all.  The linguine was cooked perfectly al dente, and I learned from my friend, later on, that all the pasta is made in house.  I could certainly tell because the quality was different from what I get at the supermarket.

Maria's is not a gourmet breakfast or sandwich place; but it is a solid place to get a traditional American style breakfast or lunch quickly.

Wow. The menu was simple (about 4-5 choices) and CHEAP. $2 for a burger and around $4 for the combo w/ fries + drink or tea. SCORE! Also, I saw the words/phrases \\"organic\\" & \\"fries made from 100% canola oil\\" and already fell in love w/o even eating the food. Sat at a bench in the patio area. Totally cool, laid back, Austin environment. \\n\\nThought I was gonna wait a long time for my food. Wrong again! Got my food in about 10 minutes. Friends had come about 30 min before us and there were about 40-50 orders made in the time being. We had compared our order numbers and time ordered. OH MY GAH....!!!!!!! HOW?! \\n\\nThe burgers were smaller than the average. The fresh lettuce wasn't one of those 1 piece flaky ones.. it was the perfect ratio along w/ the tomato & mayo. The fries owned (though they were a tad bit greasy)- they were perfectly thin, some being crispy and soft. I just loved the soft ones.. the soggier/lankier... the BETTER! Don't forget the ketchup! \\n\\nThis place kind of reminds me of In-n-Out but not really. Still different but similar with trying to make it less like a typical fast food chain.

They have tables for 1 or 2 people and they have larger tables in the back for groups of 6-8 (maybe more, I don't know enough people to fill more than that.) \\n\\nThe menu is simple, good American food. Burgers, steaks and lots of seafood. I don't eat seafood so I can't speak to its goodness. I recommend the French Onion soup if it is the soup of the day. The Blackstone Steak sandwich is excellent (you can ask for a baked or mashed instead of fries even though it doesn't note that on the menu.) I also like their Greek Salad and the Turkey Burger is surprisingly tasty. So you don't think I'm too much of a homer, I did not enjoy the Quesadillas (dry) or the BLT (it too was dry.)\\n\\nThey have a large beer selection (which is a must in Boston bars) and their wine and spirits list looks lengthy.

My girlfriends and I were in the Arboretum area one weekend doing some shopping and wanted to grab dinner in the area.  Cheesecake Factory had over an hour wait, and this place had practically no patrons, so we figured no wait + sushi? What a deal! ...Too bad the hostess had thoughts of her own.  We waited for 20-30 minutes at the front while the hostess gave us the cold shoulder and continually insisted that there \\"were no available tables\\" so she would have to speak to her manager.  When she finally came back to our party after obviously not going to speak with anyone, we politely asked her again...then called her out on how she had just walked around the restaurant in circles actually talking to anyone, much less a manager. She became flustered.  Our party became increasingly more frustrated.  And we left Kenobi sans sushi and with the impression that this was one of those snooty sushi restaurants.\\n\\nFortunately, Kenobi is on its path to redemption.  I went to Monday Madness to enjoy some affordable sushi & drinks and had a much better experience.  I arrived around 5pm which beat the rush of dinner hour. There's a good selection of about 4 appetizers and 4 rolls for $2, along with a vast selection of nigiri for $2/piece.  The escolar and salmon were particularly delish! There's also some other appetizers and specialty rolls for $5-7.  Our waiter was very attentive and made suggestions when we were unsure what to order.\\n\\nThe fish was very fresh.  The ambiance was nice, and the service was great.  Hopefully my most recent experience is more indicative of the true character of this restaurant... but I will most certainly be back next Monday to test it out again!"},{"name":"Aashirwad Indian Food and Bar","address":"7000 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent Indian food, excellent service, excellent ambience.\\nWe visited the restaurant for the 1st time on 07/21/14 and were pleasantly surprised to find such super ambience & cleanliness - and the food & service wish the icing on the cake.

The ambiance, service, and food were all superb. \\n\\nThis restaurant is in Epcot, so diners need Epcot tickets, reservations, and plenty of time to get through traffic, park, and walk all the way to the back, if they are not already in the park. Les Chefs de France and Monsieur Paul share an entrance with Les Chefs being downstairs and Monsieur Paul upstairs, mostly quietly and cozily out of sight from below. Most people have the reaction we did: we didn't know this was up here, even after many visits to Epcot France. \\n\\nAs we had been eating our way through Epcot, we passed on appetizers, though they looked wonderful. \\n\\nThe entrees we ordered are listed on the menu as follows:\\n\\n\\"Magret de canard (Roasted Duck Breast) - with apple fondant, baby onions, cabbage stuffed with braised oxtail - $42.00 \\n\\nRouget Atlantique en √©cailles de pommes de terre, fenouil, sauce romarin - Red Snapper in potato scales, briased fennels, rosemary sauce - $41.00\\"\\n\\nI had the duck and it was stunningly tender and juicy, perfect for running through the pan sauce. The oxtail, cabbage, and onions were all French perfection, but the stunner on the plate was the apple fondant. How they got the apple to that level of flavor and texture is where the art and science of food meet transcending the ordinary. \\n\\nThe person I was with ordered the snapper, and the taste I had was spectacular--a depth of flavor in the sauce only the French know how to fully achieve. \\n\\nThe portions have been Disneyfied, that is, rather than the normal delicate French portions which allow you to order appetizers and dessert with ease, these are upsized to Americanized expectations. \\n\\nWe did opt for dessert, and I cannot seem to find the one we had on the current menu. It had a hazelnut cream and ice cream. Devine. Not too sweet, not too much. \\n\\nThe service was excellent, and the waitress did an outstanding job helping us pair the wine with our entrees. \\n\\nIf we lived here, I'm afraid I'd buy Epcot admission just to eat here. \\n\\nNote that this is a fine dining restaurant with the price being exactly what I expect for chef-prepared fine food, especially with the larger portions.

I thought it was fairly decent.\\n\\nNow flash forward two years, and here I am again--with a group of friends for my going away party. I initially wanted to go to Kingston Pub, but they were bought out that night for an event, so I thought \\"okay, why not St. Regis, I'm sure they'll have seating...\\"\\n\\n I could have never imagined a more horrible venue to host this going away! The only thing they had going from them was the fact that there was a lot of seating...but I probably should have taken that as a cue to not go there! There were several reasons as to why this place harboured such disappointment, but I'll just list a handful. \\n\\nSide note: I have worked in the food service industry for almost 3 years, so I am always sympathetic towards people working in restaurants, cafes, pubs, etc...so for me to write this review is really something.\\n\\nHorrible Service: \\nIf a group is expected to pay 20% Gratuity (already included in the bill when it arrived) the service should be at least decent. But to give atrocious service just because the waitress \\"knows\\" she'll get tips regardless is terrible. I'll explain, there were two tables reserved for us, we arrived at the bar at 6:30pm--our waitress greeted us with \\"attitude\\" and gave us the menu and left. She came back literally 15-20mins later to ask if we wanted drinks, by this time most of us were already starving. Oh, for some reason she was standing right beside me and managed to skip my order--she took everyone's order around the table and just didn't even bother asking me what I wanted. As if that wasn't bad enough, my boyfriend had to go \\"EXCUSE ME\\" three times before she even decided to walk over with more attitude and go \\"yes?!\\" As well, for some odd reason she couldn't take our food order with our drink order--how does that make any sense? By this time, the other table was seated as well, and I went over to ask my friends why they weren't drinking anything and...guess what? \\"She didn't come to take any orders yet\\" \\n\\nAt this point, 5 of my friends left to go to another restaurant to eat, because the waitress took so long to get any orders in! As the hostess of this gathering I was sorely disappointed to see them leave but honestly I wouldn't have tried to stop them anyways.\\n\\nLack of \\"vibe\\" & dull atmosphere: \\nAgain, I'm not expecting a party place or anything of the sort--but the overall attitudes of the server, manager etc..there was just bad. It didn't seem as though anyone wanted to be there, and in turn the people working there was rubbing off their bad vibes onto the customers. Oh, one of my friends and her boyfriend got kicked out of the place because the boyfriend didn't have any photographic ID, it was burned in an accident---even if he said he wasn't going to order anything, or drink anything he wasn't allowed to be in the pub just because he didn't have photo identification. It wasn't as though anyone in this group was underaged anyways, but apparently the management was super strict about it. Which was funny, since my other friends came in a bit later and weren't even ask to show any identification. So much for being \\"strict\\" about it. \\n\\nMediocre Food:\\nIt's a pub, so it wasn't like the food can fail too horribly. I had a burger and my friends got pasta--just from what I heard from my friends the pasta was bland, their burgers weren't good. The patty was overdone and I think during the night someone made a crack at how a McDonald's burger would have been better and the sad thing was, it probably would have been! \\n\\nConclusion: \\nOverall, I was very displeased by the experience. I could tell that my friends were not having a good time, to be frank everyone looked glum and I could tell that we were all thinking about getting out of this place. At around 8:15pm, I told my friends \\"you know what? This place really sucks.

I've been to other Greek restaurants in Austin that have many more choices.  She started listing the gyros until I reminded her that I don't eat meat.   I selected the dolmas without the yogurt sauce and paid.  A few minutes later the cashier came out and said they were out of dolmas and apologized.  I asked to substitute the hummus instead which was priced a little less, but oh well.  I got the hummus which only came with one pita bread.  I didn't care for the taste of the hummus and the pita bread smelled like meat.

In fact, if I were rating this business on the food alone, I'd probably give it 3 or 4 stars for what it is. Not amazing mind you, and not all that healthy, but pretty good overall.\\n\\nThe problem is that the food is not the only thing a restaurant, big or small, should be offering. Customer service at Jumbos is not a priority at all, and for that I'll be sure never to order from them again.\\n\\nTake a look at the other poor reviews and you'll start to get an idea of what I'm talking about. Last night, my girlfriend and I ordered a small pizza, some chicken tenders, a garden salad and fried green beans from Jumbos at 6:50pm. On a Sunday night. Foodler confirmed our order with an estimated delivery time of 7:35pm, which is reasonable I suppose. Even if our apartment is a whopping 1.2 miles from the location.\\n\\nAn hour later, at 7:50pm, we began wondering where our food was. At 8:15pm, I called Jumbos and was immediately put on hold without even being asked, which is just plain rude. When the woman came back and asked if I would like to place an order for pickup or delivery, I held back the response of \\"how about you give me the food I already ordered?\\" and stuck with something more polite. She then put me on hold again, came back and informed me that they were \\"very busy tonight\\" and that my food wasn't there, so it must be in transit. And with that and a quick \\"sorry about that, thank you for ordering\\", she hung up.\\n\\nNearly 20 minutes later, our food arrived. The driver didn't apologize, and yet I still tipped him, assuming it wasn't his fault. But then again, maybe it was. Everything we ordered was luke warm, and we ended up reheating the chicken and the green beans. The tomatoes in the garden salad looked like they'd gone bad 3 days ago, and they included a generous 2 sticks of celery with our chicken tenders.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this establishment.

My wife didn't want Italian,  she wanted to get a salad at the take out restaurant next door.  I told my wife that I would ask if they had an issue if you brought the salad over to eat with us.  My son and I walked in to Rosetta's and the bartender promptly seated us.  I asked him if bring the salad from next door would be a problem.  The bartender said that it wouldn't be an issue.  I texted my wife that it was ok.  My son and I put our food, app and drink orders in totaling nearly $50.  My wife came over once her salad was ready and sat with us.  She ordered a coke from the owner and upon his return, he saw the bowl of salad.  He said that \\"you can't bring outside food in here\\" or something to that effect.  I told him that we specifically asked the bartender if it would be a problem and he indicated that it wouldn't.  I said that we definitely won't request to do this next time and he left.  My recollection is that he came back table twice more clearly upset that my wife was eating the salad while my son and I were having our app's and entree's.  I said that \\"we wouldn't have done this if we didn't get the ok\\", that it was \\"duly noted\\" and \\"we wouldn't ask to do this next time\\".

I would respect that type of response as it would acknowledge the misunderstanding/bad info given to us and show an appreciation of the business we did give him.

I asked the bartender for the bill, paid the full bill with a good tip for him because he tried to do the right thing.

Unfortunately, my meal was not as awesome as many of the reviews. The only good thing is that the food was prepared fast and was en route within 10 minutes of placing the order. \\n\\n* So of course I tried the wings (after seeing so many yummy pics). I ordered the 6 piece wings (half medium and half lemon pepper) with fries and an extra ranch. \\n\\n* The bag & the box were super greasy! This was an indicator of what was inside the box. The wings were dry. The lemon pepper wings were barely seasoned. They were more like regular unbreaded chicken wings. The medium wings had no flavor. The sauce was stuck to the wings like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp. My food was on its way soon after ordering so I was sure this would be fresh. \\n\\n* I only got a handful of fries but that's ok. They were so greasy that you could squeeze them and the grease oozed out. \\n\\n* I also ordered an extra ranch for .50. But I only received one ranch dressing and it was really hot. \\n\\n* The description on the menu says that it comes with celery.

He really enjoyed the \\"Moo sauce\\" and we both liked the concept of the fun sauces they offered with every steak.  My lamb chops were amazing.  Perfectly cooked and wonderfully flavorful.  We also ordered a side sampler (fries, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and marinated mushrooms), and it was more food than we could eat.  The truffle fries were AWESOME.  The rest of the sides were fine... I wasn't a huge fan of the flavorless creamed spinach.\\n\\nService was good, although our waiter was rather awkward.

Indian isn't the most photogenic of cuisines, but you'd be a fool to cast a judgement based on food's visual appeal, which I've been doing myself quite often, most of the time preferring to eat at other carts in this ever-growing pod, which I visit quite often. In my defence, this is a rather new addition to Cartlandia, so I'd blame my almost complete prior unfamiliarity with Indian food on that.\\n\\nI had Chicken Makhani, and it won't be an overstatement to say that that I've never had chicken that tasted this unique (in a positive way). They have tandoor oven right inside the cart and it appears to be making quite a difference on the overall profile of most of their dishes. Mixing in nuts, raisins and spices certainly gives the dish a Middle-Eastern undertone, although it's the combination of all of the above that distances this food from its perceived similarity with Middle-Eastern cuisine.\\n\\nI also got to try garlic naan and mango lassi (yoghurt/mango drink).

But the reason I wrote this comment was about the onion. \\n\\nI had this kind of onion plate several times previously at other restaurants and always liked it so I decided to try it at this place. The server told me it's going to be a very large one and recommended me to have a half size one.  So I ordered what he recommended. I thought they'd just use half a onion or something like that.  However it turned out to be a plate of over-fried flour crumbles in which I barely found any onions. Obviously they re-used what fell off full-sized onions, re-fried them and put together a dish like this. \\n\\nI then ordered a whole onion additionally. The servers were polite and apologetic even that I actually did not make any complaint. And without being asked they exclude the half-sized onion on my bill. I paid a 18% tip. I had no problem with the service. Btw, the full size was not large at all.\\n\\nMy suggestion is Do Not order a half-size Bluemin Onion, order a full-size one or totally avoid it."},{"name":"Ki Sushi","address":"45 Eighth Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"3.5","text":"Great sushi place.

When we do, my husband and I usually order a jumbo veggie with pineapple pizza, a couple of seitan bombs, and an order of the tofu tenders and just live off of that for a few days.\\n\\nThey do have vegan desserts - usually some type of packaged cookies (such as Liz Lovely) but occasionally they'll also have something super awesome like vegan cannolis.\\n\\nI hope that Eat at Jumbos II is closer to my house so I can eat here more often!"},{"name":"Phnom Penh","address":"244 E Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite restaurants.

They do give you a lime, salt and pepper sauce for dipping. The oyster pancake was pretty good. It was fairly large and had a chewy texture to it, with pieces of oysters. For my entree, I had the bo luc lac with a fried egg on top.  The beef is cut into smaller pieces vs the usual large cubes.

I've never met a braised beef short rib that I didn't love.  Tender.  Flavorful.  Satisfying.\\n\\nFRIED CHICKEN: Served with butter and Gunshow's take on cornbread.  Again, like the Quail and Pork Terrine - it was good, but did little to distinguish itself.  Good ol' fried chicken.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The \\"cornbread\\" was different though.  I enjoyed it.  It's like the crust was different in some way - I am failing to come up with a better description.\\n\\nTIRAMISU: Gunshow's take on this Italian dessert was inspired.  Marshmallowy puffs, chocolately puffs, coffee flavors, shaved chocolate.  Definitely not tiramisu in the traditional sense, but the flavor was somewhat familiar.  \\n\\nThe Cocktails:\\n\\nDEVIL IN A WOODPILE #2:  Bourbon, rye, punt e mes, cherry heering, hide bitters, applewood smoke.  A smoke infused bourbon cocktail.  Wow!  It reminded me of smoked beer (rauchbier).  Really cool drink with a equally cool presentation.\\n\\nTOASTED OLD FASHIONED:  Bourbon, bitters, burnt sugar, bruleed cinnamon, orange.  What can I say?  I love bourbon.  I love old fashioned.  The cinnamon and burnt sugar added another layer of complexity to the classic cocktail.  \\n\\nTo summarize, Gunshow is certainly a unique restaurant with quality and (mostly) creative ever-changing menu items.  The style of service on its own makes the experience worth having, though I would caution diners to pay careful attention to how much they are spending."},{"name":"Temple Bar","address":"1688 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"i had not been in almost 8 yrs but when I saw the group it was on.

The sausage gravy had just enough saltiness to it and it combined well with the sweeter-than-normal waffles. However, the chicken was dry though I will admit to disliking chicken breast in general. I also wished that the waffles were crunchier and fluffier. They were too soft for my liking.\\n\\nOverall, the food was good enough but certainly not worth a 45-minute wait.

It was like someone grated an entire block of salt over the serving with Mizithra cheese. Maybe Mizithra cheese is naturally salty but I *really* wasn't expecting *that*. For the half with meat sauce, the amount of sauce seemed rather skimpy.\\n\\nIn-betweens: The bread, while warm, was just so-so. I LOVE bread but this was like, whatever. And for a decent sized loaf, you get just a small scoop of equally not-great whipped butter to put on it. The included salad was also mediocre. The lettuce was chopped into small bites and ranch dressing seemed to be somewhere between real homemade Hidden Vally and the weird tasting bottled kind. FWIW though, the salad did seem fresh.\\n\\nPortion Size: The spaghetti seemed average, salad was decent, bread was on the generous side, and while small, the ice cream scoop was definitely adequate after eating everything else.\\n\\nPrice: Here's the deal-breaker for me - this wasn't worth the $13.50 plus tip I paid.

It came slightly more done but still quite rare. I sent it back again. Waited about fifteen minutes more. Same steak delivered still not cooked to specifications .I should have complained to management but I didn't. By then my wife had finished her meal. I would have been there till the cows came home from the pasture. Instead, I just boxed it up and took it home. I just ate the mashed potatoes and vegetables.  By this time, I was totally disgusted.\\nMy wife wanted dessert so we ordered a salted caramel cheesecake which wasn't bad.\\nI gave it two stars as service was excellent. Waiter kept saying he was sorry. It was not his fault but the cooks.\\nAmbiance is dark woods and nautical with fish tanks.\\nI know, Yelp people have given 4-5 stars, but I could only muster up 2.\\nThis restaurant has received numerous awards and was voted one of the top 10 in the country. I just can' t see it. There is no excuse for lousy steak, both in preparation and texture. This steak was $39 ala carte. \\nI have had better steaks at much cheaper restaurants. Maybe, I should stick to those.\\nTherefore, I cannot truly recommend this dining venue."},{"name":"Famous Dave's Bar-B-Que","address":"7121 SW Nyberg St","city":"Tualatin","stars":"3","text":"A family favorite where the people are always friendly and accommodating and the food is always delicious."},{"name":"Zuma Sushi & Sake Bar","address":"2899 B N Druid HIlls Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"This is our favorite sushi place.

But since I can't and based solely on my love for their bread, I'm bumping this up to a 4. \\n\\nWith a moniker like MOOO, I entered expecting fuzzy black-white patches covering the all, a plastic Bessie grazing on astroturf near the bar, or something that looked like the displaced interior of a barn gutted and moved to downtown Boston. You know, some tacky joint with plastic tablecloths and nice middle-aged servers calling you \\"shug\\" and \\"hon\\" and of oversized portions of fat, juicy carnage still oozing tinges of pink so flavored you wouldn't even need to ask for A1 sauce. \\n\\nOkay, while I did find one awkward spotted painting toward the rear of the dinning room, I was actually pleasantly surprised to find this to be a very modern, slick looking establishment. Props to the interior designer. With cream leather seating, avant garde lighting suspended from the ceiling, and metal/chrome accents, I could def see this as a good place for a power lunch place or something you'd want to take a first date to. \\n\\nI came here a few months ago with my sister for the afternoon prix fixe lunch with my sister. We may have made the mistake of coming during restaurant week; the place was PACKED and it still took over half an hour to be seated, even with a reservation. \\n\\nThey have an AWESOME lunch menu, for $25 per person, we ordered the steak tartare, the 8 oz steak, and the brownie to finish. Here's a run through of the entire thing: \\n\\nAppetizer: i think we had the option of a salad, soup, or the tartare. While both my sister and I ordered the tartare, I did sneak a look a neighboring table's soup order. I don't remember what it exactly was, but it was a type of seafood fare that came in a brass tureen and looked like a decent portion. The tartare serving was more than what I expected (which wasn't much, considering the price) and was decent. Not particularly fresh or memorable but was decent. \\n\\nBread: It seems like everyone raves about this, but my sister and I nearly got into an epic struggle over the BREAD here. Instead of slabs of nasty cold stale sandpaper you get from other restaurants (lespalier, I'm looking at you) we were presented with a plate of four warm, fluffy, slightly flavored but-not-too-much droplets of a baked cloud. Seriously though, if I could come back and just order the bread, I would. I vaguely remember buttering it but I don't even think it was necessary. If I had to judge an establishment simply on its bread, this place would score a perfect 5. Twiceover. \\n\\nEntree: I should admit that I'm not a connoisseur of red meats or steak houses, but i am a huge fan of side dishes like mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. I still dream about the mashed potatoes of Capital Grille, and I was disappointed to find out that this place doesn't even offer grilled potatoes on the side. We ordered our 8 oz steaks medium well, and they were decent. It was a little dry and we didn't ask to see if there was any steak sauce in the house, but it could have been because it was grilled medium-well. In terms of size, both my sister and I, with our petite asian girl appetites, did not finish and ended up packing a small box of leftovers. \\n\\nDessert: My sister and i also both ordered the brownie dessert. The brownie could have, as other reviewers have mentioned, benefitted from being served warm, as it was a bit cold and thus hard when it came out. I realize that the restaurant is busy during mealtimes, but sticking the brownie in an oven for a few minutes or microwaving it for 30 seconds before serving should def be considered. It was an adequate size considering how full we were, but nothing near what you get at, say, Cheesecake Factory's notorious cake slices. What really stood out in memory about this dessert was the homemade marshmallow on top, slightly melted and browned. So friggin good you could have served me a bowl of the marshmallow alone and I would have been happy. \\n\\nService: Maybe it's just me and the fact that I and my sister look young for our ages (a free sample lady at Costco stopped me from getting a sample last year because she thought I was under 14. Seriously, I was old enough to buy a beer and most likely older than her) but I thought the hostess was a bit condescending and impatient with my party. She was maybe 22 or 23, so around my age, and I get that the restaurant is more used to serving middle-aged men in too-tight suits who may tip you after they've had more than one or two drinks at lunchtime, but check your attitude. Otherwise, the waiter was attentive but not overbearing. It would have been nice if they refilled out water quicker as you do get parched from a lot of meat, but it wasn't untimely.\\n\\nGreat For: Lunch. It's the $25 lunch deal that makes this place worth it. I'm not sure I'd pay $45+ for dinner here, but the prix fixe lunch is a great deal."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Very cool concept....the food was really good and nicely presented, we had one of everything.

It has some obstacles to overcome like being just off Alberta instead of on Alberta so it's not very visible. The name is also deceiving.

It was not crisp and was in fact mushy and tasteless.  Breading was almost nonexistent.  We ate a few of the vegetables and left the calamari.  We commented when we ordered, that the calamari and vegetable appetizer was what brought us in for dinner.  Therefore, I was surprised that our server who was otherwise excellent, did not inquire as to why we left our $8 appetizer uneaten.  \\n\\nThen came the entrees.  I must say that my Maple Glazed Salmon and Shrimp was served piping hot and very well prepared.  However, my wife's Shrimp Linguini Alfredo was served ever so slightly above room temperature and seemed a bit pasty.  Our server returned it to the kitchen to be reheated which meant that my wife and I took turns watching each other eat. I had my dinner and as I was finishing my plate, her entree was returned, tasting like something out of the freezer section at Sam's Club, but steaming hot.\\n\\nAfter paying our check, we spoke to a manager about the calamari.  He asked if we complained to the server.  I told him that we had not and that might be why he seemed totally disinterested in our opinion.  His response was a curt \\"sorry you did not like it, come back and try it again sometime\\".  I wanted to know if their preparation had intentionally changed or if it was simply not prepared properly on this occasion.   However, his demeanor left us both feeling that we would not dine at Red Lobster again.  I should mention that this manager indicated that he was filling in from another location.  I hope he returns to his home location soon before we have yet another empty store front on SR 192 in Kissimmee.\\n\\nTheir are too many options to accept disappointing visits to a chain that should be consistent if nothing else.

I had the Chicken Cordon Bleu special and my wife had the pork Wienerschnitzel both with R√∂sti on the side. The Cordon Bleu was divine, nice flaky crust and the ham and cheese inside gave every bite the perfect balance and texture. The Wienerschnitzel was similarly cooked to perfection with a nice crust.

For desert chocolate mousse for the wife and I got the best desert I've ever had, Eis Kaffe. The mousse was decadent and delicious served with strawberries. The Eis Kaffe is vanilla ice cream blended with coffee with whipped cream on top. It sounds so simple but it was just amazingly delicious.

I really dig their farm-to-pub concept and their craft cocktail list is outstanding, but there were a few things that just didn't sit right with me.  \\n\\nI ordered the fried chicken tacos with cucumber-corn salad, avocado and queso fresco.  Let me tell you, this dish looked divine.  The cucumber-corn salad was fresh and delicious.  Everything about this little appetizer should have been a win, but sadly it was not...for me, at least.  \\n\\nYou see, I had a terrible experience a few years ago where I got food poisoning from undercooked pink-in-the-middle chicken that was served to me at a restaurant.  I was expecting this dish to contain white-meat chicken tenders, but the chicken was soft in the middle with a bit of a mushy, stringy texture.   It turns out that they deep fry thigh meat instead of breast because it's more moist and juicy...and that is ok, Family Dog.  Really, it is!  But it was too late for me.  \\n\\nAll of those former food poisoned feelings started churning around in my stomach and my lovely looking fresh tacos made me nauseous.  I know, I know...this is MY ISSUE and has nothing to do with the restaurant or how they prepared the dish, but a little bit of a heads-up on the menu would have been nice. \\n\\nAnywhoo, the manager could not have been nicer about the situation.  He apologized profusely, immediately took the offending thigh meat from the table, and removed the cost of the tacos from our bill.  He also offered to get me something else, but my tummy was flip-flopping too much to eat anything else.  Still, he handled it so well and was so great!\\n\\nEveryone at The Family Dog was really nice and helpful except for one surly bartender.  At first I thought that maybe he was having a bad day, but right after I ordered a tummy taming Shirley Temple (which was fabulous, btw!) I watched him take and make two other drink orders and then pour and drink a shot with the manager.  When I reminded him about my Shirley Temple, I received a brusque and gruff \\"IT'S COMING\\" in response.

From the complimentary soup to the complimentary dessert...delicious.\\n\\nAppetizers: The bread was pretty good, although it was just bread. Yum. And oft refilled. The complimentary soup of the night...I forget what was in it, but it was delicious...white or light yellow in color. The hamachi roll was okay, but nothing spectacular, as if someone tried to do an Asian feel and sort of messed up by letting the avocado overpower the hamachi, but you can't mess up too much with high quality ingredients. Slow cooked egg is delicious...mm chorizo. The shrimp ceviche was recommended to us by our handy, knowledgeable, very French (and cute) waiter and it was really good. Nice and tangy. My favorite appetizer  remains the heirloom tomato salad though...I love a medley of high quality tomatoes, any time any place. Just can't beat excellent ingredients done well, with pleasant dressing.\\n\\nEntrees: We only ordered 3 for our 4 people, which was not quite enough (we knew it was French food, but we didn't know it was French-sized servings). Steak was okay, but nothing great. Just pretty decent. The seared yellowfin tuna was also pretty good, as something that is usually solid unless horribly botched. Really great salad with it though. The winner winner chicken dinner was most certainly the halibut. Simply...ridiculous. I don't know if I've had better fish before!

There were only 4 the night we went, with 3 previously reserved and one swooped up before us.\\n\\nDessert: Nice coffee and three others.

The chocolate parfait is really rich and excellent, especially with that wonderful hazelnut brown butter ice cream. But what really stole the show for me was the lemon souffle tart.

Cow. \\n\\nCame here with probably at least 12 people for a combined birthday dinner so we were ready to ball out. We got some wine, some appetizers, steak, and sides. For all of us, we were able to spend less than $100, which I thought was quite impressive. \\n\\nThey start you off with a wide assortment of breads-- which are all equally delicious. Some crisp breads to the soft ones. I'm a sucker for soft breads so I ate that stuff up!! Of course, don't get stuck on just eating the bread, you'll want to make room for your meal. \\n\\nWe got calamari for the table, and it was pretty good, but I feel as though I've had better calamari elsewhere - places that specialize in seafood. But anyways.....\\n\\nI split with 2 friends the 100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye and the American Kobe Cap Steak. I think I am still dreaming about the Kobe steak. Probably the best steak I've had. Simply seasoned with salt and pepper was all it needed. And cooked to exactly how I wanted it to be, medium rare. The ribeye was a little tougher compared to the Kobe steak, but still delicious. The Kobe really just melted in your mouth. Definitely a must try if you do go. \\n\\nThe sides were delicious. We got the sweet potato tots, the asparagus, and the cauliflower. I think I could eat those sweet potato tots forever. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. \\n\\nAnd don't get me started on the dessert. Creme br√ªl√©e and the Caramel Profiteroles..... The creme br√ªl√©e was nice and creamy on the inside with that perfect crunch when you cut into it with your spoon. The caramel profiteroles: The coffee ice cream was our little pick me up so we wouldn't go into food coma. It was so delicious and the almonds were a great crunch.\\n\\nI definitely recommend this place. Get dressed up for this place, I wouldn't recommend going casual. The place is fancy and right in the Back Bay Area. There are a lot of servers, so don't be intimidated-- just wine and dine and have fun with your group!

I found Black Rooster Taqueria through Instagram and was very enticed by the photos. We checked them out on an early Sunday when they opened at 11:00 a.m. We ordered the following tacos, the first of which was my favorite. The Achiote Pork (slow roasted pork in banana leaf,\\nachiote, pickled onion, cilantro, habanero salsa) tasted just like one of the authentic Mexican tacos we had on vacation except its called cochinita in Mexico. This one in my opinion was the most flavorful. The taco shells at black rooster are made fresh in house which brings so much flavor to the taco. The other tacos we ordered were my favorite in this order, black rooster asada, carne asada and the chicken tinga. Overall, you can't go wrong with any of the tacos you order, the ingredients are made and served fresh including the guacamole so you won't be disappointed!"},{"name":"Esther‚Äôs Tex Mex","address":"210 S Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"3","text":"Went for dinner on a week night at 6 PM.

Italian Sliders, are available in three choices: meatballs, chicken parmesan or sausage and peppers. We opted for the sausage and peppers because they make their own fennel sausage here, and the taste and texture are fantastic. The sausage is topped with sauteed sliced peppers and marinara sauce, and served on soft ciabatta rolls. You get three sliders to an order, which is huge.\\n\\n\\"Dominick's Choice\\" changes daily. Every day a different appetizer from the regular menu is featured at half-price. We had the shrimp scampi, five large shrimp breaded in panko and lightly fried, served on fresh sauteed spinach with a rich lemon-butter sauce.\\n\\nBut the biggest novelty is the Italian nachos! Dominick's calls them \\"Pasta Croccante,\\" which means crunchy pasta. Fried pasta chips are topped with your choice of Bolognese, Chicken Alfredo or Veggie. The Bolognese, with marinara sauce, mozzarella, spicy peperoncini and salty kalamata olives, was terrific. Two people could easily share this.\\n\\nThey're changing the decor of the bar a bit to be a more-welcoming place to hang out, with tall tables replacing some booths. Hope they won't get rid of the old-school purse hooks underneath the bar. It's nice to have a less-pricey alternative to Dominick's awesome Italian cooking.

This comes pretty close (bc nobody beats mommas cooking).\\n\\nEating notes:\\n\\n1. They also serve sawtooth herb (culantro) with the pho. This is an essential herb for pho; I usually don't see this at other places in cbus. They also bring out lime, jalepeno, Thai basil and mung bean sprouts. \\n\\n2. Broth is not too sweet and the saltiness is just right. They have fish sauce, sriracha, hoisin, sambal, and chili in oil on the table if you want to spice up your food.  \\n\\n3. Pho is all under $10. Super affordable.\\n\\n4. They have cafe sua da made right. And yes there is supposed to be more ice than coffee. The hot coffee melts the ice and dilutes the sweetness.\\n\\n5.  Prepare for \\"Paris by Night\\"-esque jams that will take any 1st generation viet-american back to their childhood's family gatherings.  Add in a huddle of aunties and uncles sipping on tea and coffee, it will be just like the good old times. \\n\\n6. When you walk in, just choose a table. They have about eight 4 tops and a few 2 tops. They also have a bar for extra seating. A two seater was barely enough room for 1 person considering all the condiments, the tea pot, water cup, and herb plates they'll pile up on ya.

If a hot mess is how you wake up in the morning, you must be really tasty because this hot mess of seafood and sausage is great! You get gloves to wear so you don't have to worry about dirtying your fingers. Digging in, it's pretty easy to get full just from the pasta and the spicy level is up to you (medium is my limit here). I've never seen any other restaurant in Vancouver do this yet so this was a true novelty to eat and reflect on.

The taste lacks umami and were not properly camarelized.\\n\\nNext top, Scallop risotto. ($25) It looks amazing when it came, but again the chefs' lack of skill shown through again. Rice were way overcooked that it turns soggy. The taste were alright, but the cream overpower every ingredients in it. \\n\\nThe one I was looking forward the most was the grilledBlack Cod.

I'm glad the menu is fat - so that I can come back to try more things. :)\\n\\nEveryone and their mother have mentioned the Marinated Butter Beef and Chicken Wings like a zillion times (ok to be technically accurate, in 48 and 76 reviews, respectively, at the time of writing). So I don't feel the need to describe them further. JUST GET 'EM!!! Definitely the highlights of the meal.\\n\\nThe Phnom Penh Dry Egg Noodle (no broth) - #4 on menu - was delicious! Noodles had good chewy texture. Right amount of sauce. Lots of toppings to make the dish interesting - liver, kidney, etc. The broth soup that came separately had rich flavour too.\\n\\nThe Vietnamese Crepe was so so. Bf thought it was bland. Yeah, I kind of agree - didn't think the crepe fillings worked well together (bean sprouts, dry shrimp, pork I think, and mushy potato? etc.). It needed a hearty dosage of fish sauce to add flavour. Wouldn't get this again.\\n\\nThe whole lot came to $45 (after tax, before tip) - the Chicken Wings were half order. So not the cheapest place for Cambo-Viet food, but so worth it. We came at 5:30pm and was seated right away, but it was already 80% full. Starting at 6pm, the line up was A-T-R-O-C-I-O-U-S!\\n\\nFinal thought?

Chicken Yaki soba. No flavour, looked like it was cooked at home. Soft mushy noodles. \\n3. Age dashi tofu. This \\"always\\" comes first as an appetizer but it came when we were finished the meal.

The pork was not tenderized, it was a pork chop, it was tough and the batter was almost burnt. The cabbage was raw but instead of cutting it very thin it was cut so thick, it was nearly inedible.\\n5. Beef Teriyaki- The beef was like jerky, it was so tough, I was surprised. To make matters worst, there was \\"No\\" flavour or sauce. Horrendous!\\n6. White rice - Unbelievable that even the white rice was terrible. Japanese rice is sticky and moist, this white rice was dry. \\n7.

But beyond that, it was a great experience. \\n\\nI ordered the Pimento Cheese Omelette with the hashed potatoes while my fiance ordered the Napoleon Complex sandwish. My omelette was delicious although a little creamy. The potatoes were flavorful, but the true star of the meal was the sandwich. The brie was wonderfully smooth and the fig jam was amazing. It smelled amazing and was the perfect compliment to his side, which was the lentil salad. I don't even like lentils and was wowed by the salad for its tang and flavor. Definitely worth coming back for if we're ever in the area again. \\n\\nI also ordered the sweet tea which was surprisingly fantastic.

I get it with grits, and it of course comes with a biscuit. It is absolutely excellent. The problem is that I'm scared to get anything else because the one time I did I was disappointed. Another problem with the menu is that they really don't have a breakfast option like granola or oatmeal or fruit for people who are on a diet.

Drinks were delivered very quickly and dinner selections were made. The first trip to the salad bar was disappointing as many of the selections were empty or well picked over. We returned to the table and had a few bites of meat before returning to the salad bar as we saw that it was being refurnished. Many great items on the salad bar with many top end vegetables being available. The asparagus was delicious and plentiful. The serving of the meat proceeded for the next 60 minutes as we tried most, but not all of the items available. The meat was superb, with the filet literally melting in your mouth. The chicken was very good as were the pork ribs and linguica. We did not try the seafood selections as it is not included in the initial price and we could see no reason to venture from the great types of meat available. Side dishes of mashed potatoes and polenta were also made available to everyone at the table. The restaurant is noisy and very crowded as many servers move around the facility to deliver and cut your meat selections at your table. With this event being a birthday celebration, a complimentary slice of cheesecake was presented to the celebrant along with a rousing round of birthday song.

We made a reservation approximately a week before our visit to Fogo de Chao, and brought a friend.\\nRight from the start, the warm welcome put us at ease. I watched as MJ carefully made me a special drink, and we all enjoyed the mood of the bar while we waited for our dinner table.\\nWe were all impressed by the ambiance of the dining room, and the friendliness of the waitstaff. We relaxed as ordering was explained to us about the cold food area, the meat and the hot sides. We all started with salad, fine meats and cheeses. The selections were both fresh and varied, and the entire area was impeccably clean. After enjoying our first round, we were ready for some meat. The BEST meat in town! Once you flip a small coaster on your table from 'red' to 'green', the meat comes to YOU, and they're not kidding about being eager to serve you. And the meat....so tender, so expertly prepared! Sausage, pork, chicken, lamb and beef in unlimited quantities will make you feel like a King (or Queen!) I was too full for dessert, but my husband got one for free as it was his birthday. \\nOur waitress was a lovely woman that was quite friendly and helpful with all of our questions, and MJ looked in on us from time to time to ensure that our experience was amazing. His humor and attentiveness really added to our evening, and he even posed for a picture and took the time to make us feel 'at home'.\\nThe entire experience was like in Beauty and The Beast, during 'Be Our Guest', and that is not an exaggeration for the sake of humor! No one at our table had ever been treated like such VIP's from start to finish at any restaurant, ever. And watching the experience of other tables, that's the regular treatment at Fogo de Chao! \\nIt was my husband's birthday, but it was so special, it was like it was everyone else's birthday, too! Thank you, MJ. You were correct. We had the extraordinary meal that you promised and enjoyed the service immensely. Would Brazil Grill have been a great meal, as well?

There were about 3 other people around the restaurant/bar. Our waitress was very kind and answered all of our questions about the menu. My mother has sever allergies so it is crucial she knows exactly what ingredients are in her meal. The waitress was able to quickly find out the necessary information and relay it back. My mother asked for a tasting of two of the wines and the waitress happily obliged. The table ordered poutin, a mushroom and truffle pizza and kettle chips with homemade onion dip. My dad, who has never tried poutin before was pleased with what he had, although, in my opinion the happy hour price was worth it. But if it was not happy hour it would have been over priced. My mother enjoyed the mushroom and truffle oil pizza, it was nice and thin with an even spreading of toppings and perfect for one person to get full on. The only part lacking was the pizza sauce, it could have been a bit thicker and not so much \\"tomato juice\\" and a little more seasoning. The kettle chips were homemade and very good. However, the onion dip was quite bland and definitely needed some more seasoning. A few of the chips were a little undercooked but I didn't mind because the potatoes were good In general and seasoned nicely.  \\n\\nLater the same evening I ordered dinner through room service, which came through the Regis B&G.

The nachos came a little burnt on the edges, which was ok with me because that's exactly how I like my nachos; however I do see how someone might not enjoy that.

They'll bring you a printed menu of items being offered that day and each chef will mark it off if you decide to keep a dish.  If there is something you are specifically interested in, you can tell you're server.  We decided to just go with the flow and tried fish/chips, lobster roll, pork loin w/ coca cola figs, slow cooked salmon with licorice/fennel, agnolotti with goat cheese, beef short rib, and blood orange creme brulee.  Some dishes didn't come out until we were too full so speak up if you are interested in something specific.  All of it was excellent but our favorites were the salmon, lobster roll, and agnolotti.

Sure glad we did. This is a Mom and Pop divey joint that's not much to look at but serves up solid Mexican and Tex Mex fare. \\n\\nThe menu is extensive and features interior as well as tex mex items. I had a Cerviche Tostada, Al Pastor taco and a Chicken Enchilada con Mole. Yes, you can get all these ala carte, one of my favorite ways to order and build my own combo plate and not have to always get rice and beans.\\n\\nThe tostada was crisp with not too much tangy Cerviche, perfect and only 2.00. The Al Pastor was very tender pork shoulded with just enough Anchote to set it apart from the pork flavor, nice. The Chicken Enchilada con Mole was excellent. There's something about the combination of a good Mole, Chicken and Jack Cheese that makes everything right with the world. \\n\\nThe wife had an Al Pastor taco and loved it as well. The chips are warm if a bit broken up but be sure to get something to drink before you try the Salza, let's just say it's warm.

The waffle wasn't as crispy as ones I've had in the past."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I've never eaten at a place that made less sense to me. Or, at least, I've never dined at place that served good food, but made no sense. I've certainly been to places where the food was average but the experience memorable in a pleasant way. Here, however, almost all the elements of a high functioning restaurant are stripped away in an effort, I think, to place emphasis squarely on the food.\\n\\nThat may work in some master chef's austere sushi temple. Unfortunately it does not work here.\\n\\nYour waiter will describe the restaurant as serving 'dim sum style'. Let's unpack this statement as it exposes the flawed philosophy of this joint (yes, 'unpack' is totally going to be the next super-douchey-corporate-buzzword so I'm using it now before it gets completely played out). Dim sum involves a ordering from a fairly standardized set of somewhat interchangeable dishes that are relatively inexpensive and served in a bustling baroque and convivial banquet atmosphere (apologies to dim sum aficionados if I'm over generalizing).\\n\\nIn contrast, at Gunshow the menu changes frequently - so you won't necessarily ever have another chance to get that dish you really want. Dishes are wildly varied so the order in which you eat them absolutely matters. Prices are commensurate with the ambition of the food, which is to say special occasion level. And the atmosphere is sparse, harshly lit and meant to feel like you are eating inside of a restaurant kitchen (or Top Chef stage?).\\n\\nIf that doesn't illuminate how this all goes wrong maybe examples will help: (1) My wife was most excited about a lobster dish that didn't made an appearance until we were ready for dessert. She, regrettably, opted to take it anyway and I could see the anguish as she guiltily tried to eat it at first and then tried to rearrange the dish to look more eaten after she admitted (to herself) that it was a costly and superfluous order after a few bites. (2) I was most interested in a scallop dish that didn't arrive until after I had consumed several land critters that would have sabotaged my enjoyment of the delicate scallop dish's flavors. (3) The 'dining room' is brightly lit, which I suppose is necessary since it's where the cooking is happening but it's not conducive to drifting off into a pleasantly boozy meal, enjoying your companions' company, or any other dining scenario I can possibly think of. After three drinks I was more wired walking out of there then when I entered. (4) The open kitchen is kinda gross. We were seated at one of the tables facing into the  kitchen and there were things I did not need to be party to. I didn't need to see one chef sticking a metal prong into the duck and then putting it to his lip to check the temp then sticking it directly into the next duck to do the same and the next. I mean I know that shit goes on but I don't need to see it. And then the dude comes right over with duck jus on his chin selling me some his dish (and damn it I ate it b/c it was one of the ones I was looking forward to). I don't need to see a chef singing Fu Fighters to me while he absentmindedly over salts the Brussels sprouts (which were inedible but that same dude also made the best dish I had all night so we'll call it even). And I didn't need to stare at a big ass container of mise en place-d Brussels all night either. (5) the pacing was erratic with three or four dishes coming out in rapid succession and then maybe 45 minutes passing before another chef strolled by with his wares. \\n\\nThe food itself is a redeeming quality. You're obviously in a kitchen with some skilled chefs. That being said, none of the dishes will haunt my dreams or were even particularly memorable. The service was also courteous and professional.\\n\\nThe sum is less than the parts here. While I don't regret going I couldn't recommend it either. After all, even if I told you to go for the surprisingly good Lamb injera, who knows if it would be available or if it would make it to you. You would be more likely to catch a wicked air guitar solo by Chef Injera as he belted out his best Dave Grohl karaoke under the unforgiving lights of the Top Chef kitchen."},{"name":"Reds Deli","address":"9840 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"After setting up my booth at the convention center, I was starving.

I went with the supreme nachos (modifying them a bit) and sat down in their chairs to enjoy. The nachos were decent. I think the cheese was pre-packaged but everything else was fresh/tasted good. Also, for the price (about $8), you get a lot of nachos. I couldn't even finish half of my plate. To bad nachos can't easily be reheated well.

Plus, it's always fun to scare away any wimpy, yet stuck-up preppies who think they can come in here and ruin us rockers' fun with any of that stupid mainstream trash... priceless! \\n\\nBottom line - if you are looking to \\"get down on the dance floor\\" then you can forget about coming to Charlie's Kitchen!

Also worthy to note is that this where my best friend and I have had the pleasure of doing a Blues Brothers dance impersonation to \\"Gimme Some Lovin\\" on Halloween night of 2014, invoking laughter in many.

The fried rice, though listed as \\"spicy\\", was also quite mild in both heat and flavor, and a bit oily.  I did love the raisins and nuts in the mix.  The chicken though was the typical \\"Chinese restaurant chicken\\" which always seems to have a slightly rubbery, oily texture.

This place is beautifully laid out with a mixture of distressed and polished wood as well with leather. The seating is set up extremely close, so you can definitely overhear people's conversation.  This is a social venue, but not as social as Brew and Brew.  It appears whoever did the makeup of the place realized that Austin coffee shops have either the aura of pretentiousness or misanthropy and they are trying to slowly make people more social. I am not aware of the area, so I don't know if this is a neighborhood spot or not. A good word to describe this place is \\"warm\\". \\n\\nThe only thing I would recommend is to make more use of the wall space behind the bar.   I want to know what the coffee is and where it is from, I also would like to look at a wall to see what beers they have on tap. When you are at the register you are not able to tell what beers they have on tap. A menu is fine, but this is a great way to make use of the wall. The coffee did not really interest me as I am not the biggest cuv√©e fan, but seeing the baristas pull the expresso and the quality of the machines they use its probably very solid. They use the clever for single pour over and chemex for 2 people. Prices are reasonable with espresso at 3 and a single pour over at 3.25. \\n\\nIt's very similar to Brew and Brew and it's not really a ripoff. I would say for the sake of the creativity of the owners. Brew and Brew is a beer focused place that does a hell of a job with coffee. Stout Haus is a coffee focused place that has a very solid beer foundation."},{"name":"Uncle Kenny's BBQ","address":"157 N Hwy 27","city":"Clermont","stars":"4.5","text":"OMG!

We sat down at 8:30 and an hour later (at which point the restaurant was much less crowded), we didn't even have silverware never mind our food. When we asked for silverware, our waitress rolled her eyes and joked about how her daughter was supposed to bring it. The daughter then brought forks and mumbled something about how the knives were all in the dishwasher -- when they came out later, she dropped them in a pile at the end of the table without saying anything (she had a horrible attitude the whole time). No one ever asked if we wanted another glass of wine and once we finally got our food, we didn't see our waitress again until I flagged her down for the bill. At that point I think she made a passing comment thanking us for being patient but clearly didn't really understand how terrible her service was.

The mini soft tacos were YUMMY (loved the mushroom, the chicken and if you are a falafel fan, try that one too!). Great sangria, and the bartender even made a mango mojito (mango not on the menu, but they were eager to please). The chef is making in-house his special potato chips with a little zing.

It was paired with sauteed kale and very ho hum sweet potatoes. All in all the portions were small. I left hungry. The bread the gave us to start was quite good and had some tasty honey butter, but again, very small pieces of bread. Then we waited a solid 30 minutes to get our check and pay.

Did this place used to be a convenient store? I shook the feeling off- some really great restaurants have... interesting ambiance... so I let it slide. \\nBoyfriend and I sat down at a table by the Sandy street side window. Window ledges were DISGUSTINGLY dirty. Dust and dirt (and bugs!) all along the trinket filled ledges/ window sills.  I mean really- that is gross. Clean your freaking window sills!! And if you're going to have a collection of trinkets in your windows (which are right by the tables) why not make sure THOSE don't collect dirt and dust too?\\nOf course upon seeing that I began to really check out the rest of my surroundings. The floor was also filthy. And I don't mean like, maybe a family with 4 kids had just left. It was around noon and not possible that the place had opened and gotten this filthy in one hour.  \\nIt was gross. Noticeably dirty. Paper napkins (or something?) wadded up under a few of the tables. Okay... maybe every one who had eaten there before us that day threw their napkins on the floor, but I doubt it.  Clean floors, tables, and windows- that's got to be a part of the side work, yah? Not here.\\n\\nI love Thai food and I love going out to dinner. I was a server for 10 years and am pretty understanding when it comes to service. Some things you can control, some things you can't. BUT- we were only one of two tables in there when sat down to eat and our server took forever to bring our drinks to us. He was a young kid, nice enough, but maybe hates his job? He finally brought us our COLD \\"hot tea\\" (had to send that back twice)!! and a really, really POOR excuse for Thai iced tea (my fave) and decided to order while he was there and we had the chance. I should have known when the Thai iced tea was bad. How hard is that? \\nTo be honest I can't remember what we ordered- one of the curries and a stir fry dish i think- but it was not edible. Boyfriend's was just as bad. One of our dishes had green beans in them- I'm pretty sure they were the frozen kind? I asked our server if they were, but he said no. Okay... so maybe they were cooked too long? I dunno, but it was terrible.  The flavors were muddied up and indistinguishable- the rice and everything else was just a thick, soupy, soggy mess. It looked as if it had been reheated. I'm not saying it HAD been- just that it looked that way. Too much sauce, or water, or whatever. \\nNeither of us could eat more than a couple bites. It was BAD. And we declined the offer of taking it home in boxes. Ummm no. We were never asked how our meal was, and although I thought it was OBVIOUS that we were not happy (we were there maybe 2 minutes after he dropped our food at our table) we weren't offered any kind of compensation. \\nYes, I could have said something, and normally I would have, but the whole experience was just too terrible.

I like the cupcakes okay, and they're very nicely presented, but the dark chocolate ones I had the other day looked super chocolatey and didn't taste super chocolatey. That was odd.  From all appearances, I was expecting a lot of flavor, but just... no.  They were kind of waxy, which confused my mouth.\\n\\nThe concept of cake balls gives me the heebie jeebies, but my kid tried one and said it was okay.  There's potential here, but some kinks need to be worked out.  If I'm going to pay this much for something I could do on my own, it had better be worth it.  The buttercream icing was not crazy sweet, which I appreciate because it seems trendy to put a ton of icing on cupcakes these days, and that gets on my last nerve.  [Note to bakers: not everyone wants 1/3 of the cupcake experience to be icing!!  I wipe 90% of it off every time.]  But again, even though it wasn't freakishly sweet, there wasn't a lot of flavor going on.  I had raspberry that tasted only vaguely raspberryish.  Same went for the madagascar vanilla buttercream - I could barely taste any vanilla.  \\n\\nOverall, I'd compare this to listening to a really good song with the radio volume very low - if they kicked up the flavor a few levels, it would be a much better experience.  I could easily make cupcakes just as good with a mix at home, so there's not much incentive to come out to Oak Hill.

I ordered the french toast, which had some strawberry sauce. The french toast was a little softer than I am used to, so it all depends on if you like a more dry or more wet french toast. It wasn't too sweet and had a good amount of powdered sugar.

I was really disappointed at the small bowl of pho.  It had 4 pieces of sliced beef and it was submerged in the soup, and not freshly sliced raw pieces of beef.  My bf and I are not big eaters but there wasn't a time where we weren't full after our bowl of pho; so sadly; right afterwards we had to order another entree to share because it just wasn't enough.

It was all delicious. There were sauces on the table; mustard, vinegar, red and spicy red. They pretty much have all the regional flavors covered with the sauces.  The meat is smoked perfectly and very tender, the ribs fall off the bone.\\n\\nMy favorite thing was the pork egg roll. Why have I never heard of this? Delicious pulled pork, with a dollop of coleslaw, rolled in an egg roll wrapper and fried nice and crispy. Don't miss this! The server recommended having the egg roll with the mustard bb sauce and she was spot on!\\n\\nFor sides, we had mac and cheese, fries, coleslaw and collards. I loved the creamy coleslaw. The collards were good but my personal preference is to add a little sugar when cooking collards.  Still, they were good and nice change of pace from the usual sides found at bbq joints.\\n\\nDesserts are made by locals so they really are homemade. I had peanut butter pie, cool and creamy with a crunchy graham cracker crust. \\n\\nJust as we were finishing up, the owner stopped by our table to see how we enjoyed our meal. What a nice guy!

But, as they say it only takes one really bad one to outshine all the good ones.   First, we've been going to Sullivans for the past 10 years, lunches, dinners and happy hours.  Quite used to paying top dollar for good food.  That being said, DON'T go there on a holiday.  We had a group of six adults--some who flew in from out of town and invited us to have our Thanksgiving at Sullivan's.  It was their fav and what's not to like about it?  When they would come to town, they would make a beeline to Sullivans....well, after a $400.00 bill, I feel I should say something about the food.  Mind you, I am not complaining about service here, only the food and the planning for a holiday.  First, they offered a Thanksgiving menu for $39 a person.  Fine, we will try that we all said!  After arriving, when we ordered, they said they only had breast meat...NOT!  I thought they actually were cooking turkeys!!!  Apparently prepackaged breast meat was all they offered.  So, we all agreed we would pay the extra for steaks.  But, they didn't even have their regular menu available!  Once we all ordered, and got over not having turkey and our guest of honor asked them to reserve a piece of chocolate pecan pie for her dessert...NO PECAN PIE!!! Really?  on Thanksgiving?  \\"We ran out\\", and things went downhill from there...to NO LEMONADE, \\"We ran out\\" and then the beer was not replenished timely due to the changing of the kegs and when it was finally offered, my husband didn't want the beer...I have to say, I began to think about the cost of our meal and when the check arrived, we were all so dissatisfied, that I thought I really needed to say something.  The Thanksgiving menu offered was at best a $12.00 meal with precooked or canned turkey, dressing and two veggies that you could get at a Luby's.  I am deeply disappointed for our out of town guests and for our spending that much $$$ for what was not even a mediocre meal.  Shame on Sullivan's for taking advantage of this wonderful holiday to make a buck and not even plan properly so they wouldn't \\"run out\\" of items."},{"name":"Boloco","address":"176 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great place to grab some quick food to eat in the park.

We get here at Noon on a Saturday afternoon, and the place is literally empty. In fact, in the two hours we were there, we only saw two other tables. It was clear as to why there was a Groupon out and about. Business is not good.\\n\\nWe ordered a ton of stuff, and we split everything like tapas. We asked our server about bakery/dessert items being valid with the Groupon, and he said no. We asked, because the restrictions on the Groupon page were unclear delineating between dessert items and bakery items, and he said we couldn't have any of it, which was kind of a bummer, because instead of getting a meal and dessert, we had to just eat a ton of food.\\n\\nAnywho, we got the Picada (Variety of cold cuts (5 plates)), a Chicken Caesar Salad (Romaine lettuce, croutons, chicken breast and grated cheese with Caesar dressing), a beef and a chicken empanada, a Spanish Style Tortilla (Five eggs, potatoes, red peppers, onions and pepperoni baked in our grandma's pan), and a chorpian sub with a side of french fries.\\n\\nThe Picada was pretty ok. It had green olives, eggplant of some sort, some little finger sandwiches with ham and more olives, some crostinis, and a plate of salami and some delicious cheese. I'm a little vague in my descriptions because the menu was and I just ate without question. It was a good little shareable item, except I hate olives. \\n\\nThe Chicken Caesar Salad was also ok. The croutons were super hard and kind of burnt, and the dressing was pretty ok.\\n\\nThe beef empanada was very good. The beef was nicely seasoned, and the dough was nice and crispy and chewy and cooked well. The less fatty chicken empanada, however, was a little dry, and I needed help from the very well, obviously housemade chimichurri sauce to get through it. \\n\\nNow for the reason this place got two stars instead of three. The Spanish Style Tortilla. I was most looking forward to this item when we came to this place, but the entire thing was very, very bland. There was absolute no salt or seasoning of any kind. It tasted like eggs and potatoes and unseasoned veggies. Very unimpressive. \\n\\nAfter all this food, we decided to box up the sub and take it home. When we ate it for dinner later that night, the sausage was actually quite nice. It was like chorizo, but more fajita-y, if that's a word. The bread was also nice, and the veggies in the sub were actually seasoned, proving that they had seasoning in the kitchen at all. The only thing was that the bread was comically disproportionate to the meat within. The bread with huge, making the sausage seem like a Vienna sausage, but the taste was there. \\n\\nAt the end of our meal, by the way, the manager of the joint took care of our check for us, and since we somehow didn't order enough food to cover the $60, she offered us something from the dessert menu or the bakery... which the previous guy did not, which ruffled our feathers a little. \\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend getting the Groupon, because that would buy you too much unimpressive food. Just stop by for the choripan sub and the dulce de leche cream puff we ended up getting. Those items are very, very good"},{"name":"L'Osteria","address":"104 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Not bad.  Did a segway tour and they recommended this place for lunch.

Haven't tried anything else in the North End so I'll probably head up other places before I come back here.\\n\\nApart from that nothing truly spectacular.

We ended up getting an asada tostada, shrimp ceviche tostada, and Mexican chorizo plate.\\n\\nAsada tostada- disappointed that the tostada shell was store bought like out of a bag. It was topped with homemade refried beans, carne asada, lettuce, cheese, and tomato. Nothing amazing but it was good.\\n\\nShrimp ceviche tostada- ceviche is when the protein is cooked with citrus. In this case it was shrimp marinated in lime juice. The shrimp was then mixed with pico de gallo (tomato, onion, cilantro, lime juice), put on a store bought tostada shell and topped with avacado slices. Flavor was good but it was too much pico and not enough shrimp in my opinion.\\n\\nMexican chorizo plate- chunks of chorizo sausage scrambled with eggs and small onions served with rice and beans and a side of flour tortillas. If you like chorizo and eggs, you'll enjoy this. Portion was rather large too. \\n\\nSides- their salsas are really good. While I prefer the less spicy red, my fianc√© loves the super spicy green which seems to have Avacado in it.

It's so pretty, the service is amazing, and the food is delicious and a good deal too.  Fill out their form when you leave and they'll send a friend a coupon for a free entree! No kidding, we did it.  \\n\\nTake this with a grain of salt, because I have had Indian food (in a restaurant rather than someone's house) seven times now, and all three have been at Haveli! Yeah!  So if you're new to Indian food like I was, maybe that means you'll like it!  I also brought home leftovers all seven times.  \\n\\nWe had Tandoori Chicken, which arrived with veggies on a sizzling platter, smelled a-mazing, and tasted divine.   We also had oh-so-tender Chicken Tikka Masala which comes in a little metal crock from which you spoon it over your yummy shared rice (of which you can get refills), and Mango Chicken, which is served the same way.  The chicken soup was lovely with mellow spices, so nice on a cold day.  The coconut soup was good, but kind of ho-hum.  Go for the chicken if you're eating soup.   They bring out crunchy lentil/pepper cracker thingies with an onion + something else chutney while you wait for dinner, and it's yummy.  \\n\\nOK, some of the food I didn't like - dessert, as attractively presented as it was.  And I have had them all now.  But I have to assume that it's just my tastes, because everything else rocked.   You can get entree combos that come with soup, dessert, and coffee or tea for like $2 more and it's a super deal if you like Indian dessert.  I have found that I do not, if Haveli is truly representative of it.  But that's OK - I can turn to other cultures for my desserts!  \\n\\nThe staff is attentive, friendly, ever-present - ideal.

Definitely not comparable to something like Publick House or Sunset, but you're likely to find a few of your favorites.  But if you're looking for great food, don't come here.  Just went last night with a group of people and there were a few items we were not impressed with:  1)  asked for chili with our nachos and instead got salsa with kidney beans, 2) two of the wraps ordered were supposed to come with honey dijon but didn't.  It was pretty tasteless without it, but waitress quickly brought over two sides of it when we pointed this out, 3) the pasta dish ordered was supposed to come with spicy marinara sauce, but the two girls eating it swore it was Frank's Hot Sauce.  As they passed the plate over, I could clearly smell buffalo wing sauce.  When we actually asked the waitress about it, she did manage to bring out a side of the correct sauce.  I think the chef was smoking crack that night.  Who in their right mind puts buffalo sauce on top of pasta and calls it marinara?  I am definitely not in a rush to go back, but since my colleagues and I used to frequent Soho for after-work drinks before, we will probably keep this place in mind for future outings just because it is conveniently located and easily accommodates large groups.  I did also notice their 9-11pm special of all-you-can-eat wings for $3.99 per person.

The food is amazing. Some of the best tacos I have ever had and it is a result of the delicious meat and wonderful combinations.\\n\\nQuality: Even with a very good reputation, I was not ready to believe the hype about an Orlando taco shop, but Black Rooster Taqueria is truly incredible. I got a ton of food, but there is nothing I would not order again. I started with the Guacamole And Chips, and the made to order guac is outstanding. It mixes in some tomato, onion, and cilantro for a near perfect dip. For tacos I ended up with five, Achlote Pork Taco, Black Rooster Asada Taco, Smoked Brisket And Beef Taco, Pork Fat Taco, and Crispy Fish Taco. The Black Rooster Asada was my favorite of the bunch with bacon, cheese, and pickled chile poblano added on. But the Pork Fat Taco and Achiote Pork Taco were close behind it. Honestly, you can't go wrong. All the meat is fantastic, the tacos have a good mix of ingredients, and the tortillas are amazing. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the Black Rooster Margarita, but with all the food you should get, don't even worry about the drinks.\\nQuantity: I ordered a ton of food because I wanted to try everything, but three tacos are more than enough for lunch. However, I recommend you come with friends to try a bunch of their delicious tacos.\\nValue: $6 for a Black Rooster Margarita. $7 for the Guacamole And Chips. $3.75 for a Achlote Pork Taco. $4.50 for a Black Rooster Asada Taco. $4.50 for a Smoked Brisket and Beef Taco. $3.50 for a Pork Fat Taco. $4.75 for a Crispy Fish Taco.\\nAmbiance: Black Rooster Taqueria is located a little east of Downtown Orlando. In a hip area full of bars and restaurants, this is the highlight. From the road it seems like a relatively ordinary spot, but the food inside is remarkable. The restaurant looks like your standard fast casual Mexican spot. You order at the counter and as you wait you can take a quick look at the food behind the windows in the kitchen area. They have a few tables and some high-tops, but it is tough to grab a spot when busy. They have a television in the corner and lights strung up, but very little other decoration. That makes the food more important, but it absolutely lives up to it.\\nCrowd: A busy lunch spot on Sunday, but I assume it would be busy every day of the week.\\nService: They have you order at the counter and then bring out your food when ready, but I still left with such a positive impression of everyone I interacted with.\\nParking: Private parking lot located behind the restaurant."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"433 N McDonough St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I have such mixed feelings about this place.

The service was impeccable... the knowledge and presentation of the wine, the GM on site asking how your dinner is going, the executive chef coming out to speak with his guests and the delivery of the food. For the food, one word, phenomenal. Let's start with the bar. I had my usual Old Fashion to begin my meal. It was prepared in the classic way with rye whiskey, no fruit an just a lemon twist. Maybe the best old fashion in city. I have never seen a wine list like this. Ordered the Walter Hanley Chardonnay and Penner Ash Cab, usuallls on my table, both of which carried only a two times markup. At another restaurant, would have been double that. For the appetizer, I had the beef tartare with a quail egg.  The texture was impeccable as it melted in your mouth. The flavor is of what meat should taste like but as our culture we have forgotton due to our disgusting lines at fast food places. For my entree I had their \\"Three Little Piggies.\\" A pork combination accented perfectly with spinach and Bourbon apples. The tenderness and savor of the pork coupled with the crispiness of the Chicaharron was excellently flavored with the offsetting salty sweetness of the spinach and apples. One of my guests had the venison that carried a smokey aroma that would rival a glass of Talisker offset with the earthiness of teh squash puree it sat on. Another guest had the seared tuna that seemed to have been plucked right out of the sea and then loaded with the shavings of a full truffle. Both the seasonal and market menus were innovative and created with the delicate care of a truly enthusiastic chef. The dessert was OK, as I'm not a desert person, but still wiped the plate clean. Overall, I would put this place next to some of the best in Atlanta in terms of food, service and all around guest experience. I had two out of town guests in for a visit, both of which are newer to the fine dining experience. It was fun to to watch their enjoyment of the masterful display around us, and reminded me of the true beauty of what a artfully provided meal can do for the soul."},{"name":"Pips Frozen Yogurt","address":"13611 NW Cornell Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is so close to being our favorite.

I explained the situation and she said that she's going to give me credit of that for next time I order.\\n\\nI said I don't want that because none of us eat raw fish and that means someone is going to be hungry even though we already paid & waited for nearly an hour for them to deliver.\\n\\nShe said she'll have it deliver it to us but it'll take 45 minutes to an hour. 45 minutes to an hour for 3 rolls of sushi, that didn't sound like an immediate fix to me so I was about to ask if there's anything else they can do to fix this faster.\\n\\nBut before that, I asked for a manager and she told me that she's the manager. I asked her name and her name is Helen.\\n\\nShe continued to tell me that they're busy and they have other deliveries to make. She made that very clear because she told that to me twice.

She also didn't want to listen to me at all because she kept interrupting me.\\n\\nIt sounded like it was more important for her to be in control than actually doing her job, customer service.\\n\\nI got bit angry for the first time at this point so I said you know what, I'll come pick up the correct order in 10 minutes but I want half of the money back because I now have to do something I didn't have to do, their delivery job.\\n\\nShe didn't want do that either but she eventually said that she will personally deliver it to me earlier than an hour, which is in 30 minutes.\\n\\nI said 20 minutes, she said 30, I said 20 and she said 25. I said okay Helen, I will see you in 25 minutes and we hang up.\\n\\nA guy who delivered us in the first place showed up and gave us the correct order. He looked at the mystery roll, said it's called house roll and not sure why we got that in the first place.\\n\\nSo Helen lied to us.\\n\\nShe never apologized for their mistake and she never showed up even though she said she will personally deliver it to us.\\n\\nOther restaurants that made mistakes like this usually called after the delivery to make sure we got the correct order. But Helen didn't bother doing that either.\\n\\nI don't think she's a manager, I think she was lyng and even she is a manager, I don't think she's a very good manager.\\n\\nThey have never made mistake like this before so I was surprised but I wasn't angry about it.

However the parking lot can be a bit cumbersome but there is parking on the street and the adjacent neighborhooods.  I was quickly seated upon arrival on a Sunday afternoon.  The atmosphere was very chill.  I ordered the Award winning Shrimp & Grits and the Chocolate bread puddding with vanilla cream.  I also ordered a Mangomosa to wash all that goodness down.  The shrimp was cooked to perfection while the grits were thick and creamy.  No sugar was necessary for those grits.  The chocolate bread pudding was very filling and chocolatey.  The star of the show was the Flying Biscuit. Very tall and thick and fluffy.  The cranberry apple sauce really makes this biscuit fly.  I also enjoyed the quick and prompt service.

The food was fabulous. We were a party of eight and what I'm complaining about is the server.  We were a party of eight and gratuity is included. The issue I had and we didn't say anything at the time but it was brought up was our waiter adding on extras not asked for yo up his check average for a bigger tip. Our waiter asked each person if we wanted blue cheese crumbles and bacon on our salads all but one said no. Every salad had it on and each person was charged 5.00 for this extra 5x8 is forty dollars. Each person was asked if we wanted truffle butter with our steak two said yes all were served truffle butter at a 5.00 charge now that's another forty dollars for his check average  to up his tip. That is eighty dollars on a bill that shouldn't have been there and was. As our waiter smiled away knowing what he was doing he kept using his language barrier as excuses. I find this to be poor practice don't add on extras to up your check average and tip. This alone makes me not want to go back to Charleys. There are several great steakhouses in the area who don't allow there waitstaff to get away with this behavior. It's more of the point than the money.

It's the best sports bar you're going to find on the Westside (at least at the time of writing this review). It's spacious, has plenty of TVs and all the channels most sports fans need, and the food is decent for a sports bar. I don't drink, but they seem to have a plethora of beers on tap.\\n\\nEver since this place opened in March 2015, I've no longer had the need to go to Hudson Grille or Taco Mac in Midtown. Those places were often crowded and parking could be a pain. The times I've been to Three Dollar Cafe, it's never been crowded and there's plenty of free parking. The sports bar is located on the ground level of Tenside, the apartment complex at Northside and 10th, near Georgia Tech. Other retail tenants include Zen on Ten, Sarpino's Pizzeria, Jersey Mike's, Bubble Cafe, and Five Guys. Parking is located inside Tenside's garage which is accessible via both Northside and 10th.\\n\\nWhen this Three Dollar Cafe opened, it was the 9th location for this chain. The chain is local and over 30 years old. I remember my first visit to a Three Dollar Cafe was circa 2000-01 at the old location on Peachtree St in Buckhead. I've also been to the small, oddly shaped one on Windy Hill.\\n\\nIt's not evident from the outside, but this Three Dollar Cafe is actually quite big inside (6,000 square feet). There's no shortage of televisions or seating and they have a patio too. My current favorite sports radio station, 92.9 The Game, has broadcast from here (Dukes & Bell). Channels and packages they carry that I'm interested in, but do not get at home, include ESPNU, NBA TV, and NBA League Pass. You can pretty much watch any NBA game here. So if you're excited about matchups like 76ers-Bucks or Suns-Kings, they'll have it for you and there's really not a bad seat in the house.\\n\\nFood-wise, Three Dollar's wings are popular. They have over a half-dozen sauces. You can get 6 for $6.79, 10 for $9.79, 20 for $19.55, 30 for $29.25, 40 for $37.85, and 50 for $46.85. They also cater. I've tried the teriyaki and lemon pepper wings and they are quite tasty. I recommend them.\\n\\nStarters cost about $5-10 each. I've tried the Nacho Mountain (half portion, $7.25) which comes with cheese, jalapenos, diced onions and tomatoes, olives, and chili with sour cream, and salsa on the side. Pretty standard stuff. It tastes like the taco salad I get on Thursdays from the cafe at my office building (where several of the ingredients come from bags, cans, and jars).\\n\\nOther starters I've tried include the Cheese Sticks ($7.99), Crispy Pickles ($5.69), and Fried Mushrooms ($6.99). The cheese sticks are terrific! Four golden-fried sticks come to an order and each is filled with delicious, ooey-gooey, mozzarella cheese. They are served with a side of marinara. I'm not a huge fan of fried pickles, but Three Dollar's crispy pickles aren't bad. Par for the course I'd say. They're served with a side of ranch. The fried mushrooms are good. They bread and fry whole button mushrooms so each piece is sizable. These are served with a yummy horseradish-dijon.\\n\\nExpect to spend about $8-10 for a burger, sandwich, or wrap. One of the best-sellers is the Steak & Cheese Sandwich ($8.69). It's essentially a Philly cheesesteak and it's pretty good. It's packed with lots of savory, thinly sliced, grilled ribeye along with melted cheese inside a long, soft hoagie. I suggest adding sauteed mushrooms and green bell pepper for a dollar extra. Overall, the cheesesteak is filling and satisfying. It comes with a side of thick cut fries (steak fries).\\n\\nEntrees ($14-15 each) include dishes like Braised Brisket, Alfredo Chicken, Shrimp & Grits, and Cajun Pasta. They also have salads ($8-9) if you're looking to eat light and healthy.\\n\\nService is good. The staff is friendly and attentive and orders come out from the kitchen relatively fast.

Even with the prix fixe menu, once you have a glass of wine and add in tax and gratuity, the per person price was around $60. Since I usually live in the $10-20 range, I was definitely expecting something wonderful from 4th & Swift.\\n\\nThe service from the moment I arrived was impeccable. The valet was fast and friendly, the hostess knew where my party was seated without having to check, and our server was attentive and knowledgeable without being intrusive. If I were rating the restaurant on service alone, it would definitely be 4 to 5 stars. \\n\\nThe food was absolutely fine. The prix fixe was almost a subset of the regular menu, with a few modifications. For example, I had the corn soup starter, which was delicious. It tasted like summer in a bowl, and the pickled okra was the perfect counterpoint to the rich creaminess of the soup. As part of the regular menu, it also includes crab meat, which would have taken the dish from tasty to luxurious. The seared trout with peas and french green beans was perfectly cooked, if not particularly exciting. On the regular menu, it's accompanied by herbed potato gnocchi, rather than chilled, thickly sliced new potatoes. My favorite part of the meal BY FAR was dessert, which was a luscious English sticky toffee pudding with vanilla sweetened cream. Rich, warm, fragrant, it was everything I would ever want in a dessert. \\n\\nI'm not saying the food wasn't tasty, rather that it lacked that \\"something extra\\" that justifies a higher price tag and elevates food from well prepared to something special. I found myself thinking several times throughout the meal, \\"well, it's good, but I'm pretty sure I could make this at home.\\" I would love to go back here for that sticky toffee pudding and a cup of coffee for a sweet end to a date night, but otherwise, I'm not sure I'd consider the food at 4th & Swift worth the price."},{"name":"Sala's Hawaiian Slurp Shack","address":"1803 E Semoran Blvd","city":"Apopka","stars":"4.5","text":"We love this place.

We had ordered delivery and liked it, but didn't get a feel for the full menu until we stopped in. We are so glad we did.\\n\\nWe started with the combination appetizer, a common Indian restaurant dish with Samosa and pakora, and already were pleased. The plate comes with one amazing ground meat Samosa (a bit unusual) and it was fantastic. The other Samosa had the usual potatoes, but they were especially well-seasoned, fluffy and delicious. The pakora was great -- crisp and freshly fried. The green and red chutneys served alongside were again a notch above what we've had elsewhere lately. The green in particular was special -- fragrant and just lightly minty.\\n\\nFor dinner, we shared entrees as we normally do with Indian food. My wife had an excellent chicken tikka masala dish, as good as any we've had.  But my dish -- the \\"Mixed Tandoori Special,\\" combining oven-cooked and grilled meats, blew us both away. It came with chicken seekh kabab, Tandoori chicken (firmly cooked and perfectly spicy) lamb tikka, and chicken tikka. I liked the tikkas best -- the lamb in particular was out of this world. and not something I normally see on the oven / grill menu at Indian places. The cubes of chicken tikka were great as well -- the seasoning was excellent. My wife especially liked the chicken seekh kabab -- only slightly behind the lamb. But it was all mouth-wateringly good. The spices on the whole Tandoori dish were just great, but the tikka will bring us back, soon.\\n\\nDon't forget an order of naan when you visit -- we had an onion version and it was fresh and crispy / chewy in the best way. \\n\\nThis place deserves more business. While we were there (a Thursday night) carry out and delivery orders were flowing steadily out the door, but we were the only ones seated (!) Perfectly nice and private for us, but kind of shame just because of the excellent level of food available -- there should be a crowd here.

The wedding couple wanted  to have the actual ceremony is the same location so Cooper's Hall set up chairs in the traditional arrangement--two sides of chairs and an aisle. The bride walked down a long dramatic stairway to enter. The ceremony was perfect and everyone could hear with the provided microphone. We bought white roses (3 vases per table) and the coordinator arranged them for us (above and beyond the call of duty). After the ceremony, an army of staff arranged the table for dinner while we mingled for the cocktail hour. The place has 15 wines on tap and we chose three types to serve guests. If they wanted cocktails, it was a no host option which worked just fine. The passed hors d'oeuvres were delicious and hot. The dinner was served family style at each table (Lamb, trout, salad and a cauliflower dish). These were all served quickly and perfectly by a very attentive team of wait staff. Wine was poured at the table so we just paid for what people actually drank. And people had their glasses immediately filled when they needed more. The wedding was the best I've ever been to.

The whole table was tense with anticipation. Then the flavor hit my tongue then the heat.  I swallowed and said one word. \\"Glorious\\" \\n\\nI immediately got up and ordered two baskets for the waitresses and the bartenders.  The things were so good I just had to share them. \\n\\nMy wife said the beans were good, didn't taste canned, the corn tortillas were good but not great.  The pork was shredded carnitas, and was cooked perfectly. \\n\\nI talked to one of the owners, his name Mike, he said, \\"we are going to be here 6 days a week.\\" I said, \\"that's weird I'm here 6 days a week too!\\" \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive menu for a taco stand - http://torchystacos.com/.  I am unsure about what their hours will be, I guess I'll have to go back and ask.\\n\\nEDIT: 10/18/07 - The Fire Marshalls made Lil Woodrow's get rid of Torchy's because they said it blocked the back fire exit. Even though it did not, and LW has two huge garage doors in front.  Anyways, I hear it will be back after some renovations to the back area of LW. -Don R\\n\\nEDIT 10/20/07- Torchy's Tacos is back! \\n\\nEDIT: 01/25/08 - Torchy's has a taco of the month, it is an off the menu special, look for a red piece of paper on the window that will describe the special. This month the special is called THE BRUSH FIRE. It is greatness. I think I have had like 10 of them in the past 10 days.

Ever since I tried the one in Victoria several years ago, it's been my go-to brunch spot despite the long lineups. For this visit, we went on a Saturday at 1pm and had to wait for about 50 minutes before being seated.\\n\\nTASTE: Having ordered the Charlie Bowl nearly every time I've gone to Jam Cafe, I decided to try the Gravy Coops ($17) this time. It was delicious and beautifully presented. The sunny-side up eggs were perfectly cooked, with the deep orange yolks oozing out as soon as I cut into them. The outside of the fried chicken was crunchy and well-seasoned, while the inside was juicy and tender. The buttermilk biscuit was not too dense and, along with the sausage gravy, perfectly complemented the rest of the dish. The hash browns were a nice addition as well. If you want some heat, you should add the housemade tomatillo sauce - it's not too spicy and adds just the right amount of kick to each bite. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the Cast Iron Macaroni ($16) and a double of The Jammer mimosa ($12). Both of us agreed that the macaroni was alright (especially in comparison to my dish), but we both enjoyed the candied bacon on top.\\n\\nVALUE: For a brunch spot, I would say that Jam Cafe is a pretty good value. The portions are huge and, depending on how rich the dish is, may even need to be packed up afterwards. The drinks, however, are not as worthwhile as the food, but are on par value-wise with other restaurants.\\n\\nSERVICE: We waited for 20 to 30 more minutes for our food to arrive. Though this was longer than I would have liked, the quality of the food more than compensated for it. Our waitress was also friendly and attentive. She checked up on us to ensure we were enjoying the food and was generally on top of water refills. At no point did we feel rushed in eating. \\n\\nAMBIANCE: It's a cozy space with incredibly interesting decor. Despite it being a full house, it didn't feel like we were packed like sardines and the noise level was manageable too. \\n\\nOverall, I had yet another great experience at Jam Cafe; I highly recommend this place!

You have a coaster that is red on one side and green on the other. Flip the green side up and a waiter will appear very quickly. Flip the red side and you eat without interruption.\\nBefore most folks start gorging on the most flavorful and properly prepared meats, you can go to Portland's best salad bar.

Unfortunately, the truth of the matter is the greatest element in Grill 23 is the AMBIANCE. The food (especially the steak) is NOT as good as Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and, for the price, the presentation of the food is underwhelming. We had the 100 day old steak, medium well (it came burned and charred on the edges). THe flavor was somewhat lacking and didn't have the mouth watering taste that places such as Ruth's Chris offered us (a few months prior). The waiter was friendly but failed to engage us. If you really want Steak and are looking for great food - try Ruth's Chris FIRST and do this ONLY for the ambiance (second to none in that)"},{"name":"Yagoto Sushi Dining","address":"2180 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"What a surprise!

When your in Apopka, the place is packed, and your the only gringo there 2. When everything is in Spanish\\n\\nSo it was with Taqueria Taco Reindo. The restaurant looks awful from the outside, and isn't much better inside. The whole building has a lean to it that makes you wonder how it passed fire code inspection. I would never had ventured in if it hadn't got such glowing Yelp reviews. When I called to ask how late they were open the person answering handed the phone to someone who could speak English. Another good sign...\\n\\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by a quiet, but nice young guy who then handed us menus. He also gave us samples of their flavored water- the milky Horchata (made with almonds and rice), red Tamarindo, and yellow Jamaica (pineapple). Our favorite of which was the Tamarindo. The menu is not extensive but has the fundamentals. Quesadillas, burritos, flautas, tacos. I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my son but it came with shredded pork that he deemed \\"spicy\\" (it wasn't). We had to order another that was \\"cheese only\\". He devoured this one. My husband and I shared the flautas, tacos and burritos. I really enjoyed my pork burritos supreme ($6.99) which came with a side of refried beans, rice and pico de gallo. The meat was moist and well seasoned. My husband's taco trio ($1.25 each) were good but small. The flautas supreme ($6.99) had a good flavor but were a little dry. I liked the topping bar- there you can chose from, among other things, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, grilled onions, and four types of salsa. Even the mildest of the four was a little spicy for me, but I'm a wimp. My husband, who loves hot sauce really enjoyed them. \\n\\nFood is cooked to order so you sit and when the food is ready it is brought to you. You then have to go back up to the toppings bar, which is a little awkward. Pay at the counter after you eat. They, unfortunately, do not serve beer (or margaritas!) which is too bad. It would've gone great with the food! I left Taco Reindo absolutely stuffed."},{"name":"Noodles & Company","address":"12190 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Clackamas","stars":"3","text":"Great place, common stop for the wife and I.

Given that it is about 2 miles from my house, I will go back.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very laid back i.e. wood tables connected by C-clamps to create family style tables, staff in jeans, etc.\\n\\nIt was Valentine's night so we got there early knowing it would be crazy busy later.  It was about 1/10th full when we arrived.  \\n\\nUpon being seated, we received the menu of the day and began perusing.  I knew from previous reviewers not to get overly attached to any one item because you might not see it during your seating and this was true.\\n\\nEverything is small plate so we shared all the items.\\n\\nWe ordered the Szechuan noodles as our 'snack'.  While I am aware that Szechuan = spicy, fair warning that Szechuan = SPICY in this dish would have been nice.  We couldn't finish it.\\n\\nEach of the meals is brought around by the chef/cook who made it.  Due to this, It is hard to turn anything down which is business genius.\\n\\nWe next had the BBQ quail which was really tasty.\\n\\nOne of our favorites was the West Coast burger (slider) that was marketed to be a replica of the In N Out burger.  It was fantastic.  So good that I pulled the Almost Famous Animal burger recipe off the Food Network site and tried to replicate it.\\n\\nOur other favorite was Kevin's sliced steak.  On the cutting board it resembled duck so when he said it was steak I was hesitant but there was no way I was not going to eat his dish.  The steak was delectable.  It was full of flavor and the fat was not grisly or distasteful.\\n\\nThe final dish we sampled was the oysters.  The presentation was deceptive.  It looked to be a single oyster but when the dish was picked up it was actually four.  I am not a fan of oysters but my husband highly suggested I try one because they were in a pickle brine.  I was very pleased with the taste and would eat them prepared this way again.\\n\\nThe two favorites were the add on items i.e. not listed on the menu.  I suggest you ask your server upon being seated what the add-ons are for the evening so you don't miss them.  They are a little guarded about them.\\n\\nThe business decision to serve the items this way is incredibly smart.  Diners may choose more items than they were planning because one of their favorites comes towards the end of the meal.  As I already stated, it's also hard to turn down the person who actually cooked the dish.\\n\\nI thought the dishes would add up more quickly than they did thus giving me a feeling we overspent but that was not nearly the truth.  We had the above items plus a good bottle of Barolo and the bill, before tip, was only $125.\\n\\nFYI, by the time we left more items were circulating so we would probably go later in the evening the next time.  At that point the restaurant was nearly 100% full.\\n\\nPlease note that the family style open setting of the restaurant can make it difficult to hear the chefs and servers (especially the one low talker) and it makes eavesdropping on your neighbors something that can't be avoided.  Plus, people feel very free to comment on the selections you make.\\n\\nAs an aside- the website is sorely lacking of anything useful.  It needs daily updating and much more information."},{"name":"Phnom Penh","address":"244 E Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I do like their chicken wings and butter beef.

I got chicken in mine and the chicken was just so amazingly marinated and seasoned it just really brings the dish together.  The Panang curry dish is good too, and it was the first time I tried a curry dish.  It is pretty spicy so I don't know if it was the best first choice, but it was tasty.  The service is great too.

Well, look at my luck -- They have one right near campus now!\\n\\nTwo things I can say about this location, the customer service is really really good and the food will leave you very very satisfied.\\n\\nDo not mess around! Get the 3 tacos in the build your own section! It's by far the best value. We were greeted by the first employee at the tortilla machine, who was very sweet and walked us through all of the choices.\\n\\nBest part..., choose a tortilla type:\\nButtermilk Flour\\nAncho Chili\\nCilantro Tomatillo (Awesome)\\nSmokey Cheddar (Amazing)\\n\\nYes! They have the little dough balls for the tortillas right there. They press them into a tortilla right in front of you and throw them onto a flat grill. Everything about this made me very happy.\\n\\nI chose the 3 tacos because you can make each taco unique. It's own tortilla style, fillings, toppings. It's like getting to try 3 separate plates. I loved that!\\n\\nYou can fill the taco with white or brown rice, 3 types of beans, regular guac or some sort of wild guacamole with even more delicious veggies mashed in.\\n\\nThe part that I really enjoyed were the various types of sauces that you could add on. I got a lot of these sauces on the side to try. It actually reminded me a lot of VERTs. I wanted to mix and match the sauces. The employees were well informed. They knew exactly which sauce went with which. The names are really hard to remember, but I think it was the 66 Red sauce that was just to die for with the brisket taco. It almost had a smoky BBQ sauce flavor, but it was a less thick than regular BBQ sauce. My favorite sauce out of all of them was the Chipotle crema. Killer flavor paired with a breaded fish taco.\\n\\nI love that this is near campus, I almost wish it was closer, so I could walk from my office! The employees were mingling in the eating area since we went during the Christmas holidays, so a lot of them had special recommendations for us to try.

Sometimes when it is crushed tomatoes used it seems to not cover the dough evenly enough in my opinion. I can't comment on the pepperoni since it isn't something I care for. \\n\\nStaff was polite, dining area clean, and the prices were alright.

My SO had the Peixe Assado, grilled red snapper with banana rice & veggies.  That was quite tasty.  This second experience was much more enjoyable."},{"name":"Roka","address":"801 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Sat night and there are a total of 4 customers here.

Some of my favorite things include their pickles which are done in house, the Bingo burger (which can be topped with the standard cheese, sauteed onions, or/and CRISPY FRIED AVOCADO), and whatever is going on with the Pig Project where genius Chef Delicious concocts delicious pork dishes that change on the regular. Really, anything that is of the porcine variety (pulled pork, bacon ragout that comes with the hush puppies, etc.) is going to be great here. While I mostly eat at the bar, the couple of times I've sat at the tables the waitstaff was friendly and reasonably prompt.

Tucked away off the street, you'll see signs for complementary valet parking to clue you in for their location. Their restaurant week menu is a subset of their normal summer menu (bonus points!) to give you an accurate idea of what the restaurant normally offers. 4th & Swift has a reasonably priced menu, so restaurant week probably did not save us a ton of money in the end. The lighting inside is dark and moody and the interior has a contemporary feel. The restaurant was busy, but it wasn't loud. All things that would make for a great date location! \\n\\nThe meal started out with a choice of appetizers. I chose the Sweet Corn Soup with crispy fried okra and basil creme fraiche and my friend chose the Salad of Young Arugula with grilled peaches, pistachios, pickled red onions, and honey-banyuls vinaigrette. This might be the best corn soup I've ever had and I love corn soup. It was creamy, refreshing, the fried okra provided a nice bite. I appreciated just the small amount of okra because it had such a punch of flavor. The salad was perfectly balanced between the spicy arugula, the sweet peaches, the crunch of the pistachio, and the tang of the red onion. The main courses weren't as exciting. My friend ordered the Pan Seared Blue Ridge Trout with summer legumes, sweet peppers, spring onions, and golden potatoes with a buttermilk dressing. While the fish was cooked perfectly, there was nothing special about the dish and the flavors were lackluster. I had the Hand Rolled Caper Torteloni with ratatouille, cherry tomatoes, olive oil bread crumbs in a white mushroom sauce. I should have guessed they would only provide three tiny pieces of torteloni. Each torteloni was stuffed fully with capers, making it somewhat overwhelming. The torteloni was best taken in tiny bites and mixed with the ratatouille for it to not be off-putting. There was also a foam on top of the dish, which was rather unnecessary and added nothing to the plate. We each finished with a slice of the Chocolate Tart topped with buttermilk ice cream and macerated strawberries. It was the perfect balance of dark chocolate with sweet toppings. The ice cream wasn't overly sweet and the chocolate tart was rich and creamy. \\n\\nAlthough our entrees here were ho-hum, I'm curious to see what the other entrees are like and if any of them are as spectacular as the appetizers and dessert we had."},{"name":"Doc Morgan's Pub & Restaurant","address":"437 Bowen Island Trunk Road","city":"Bowen Island","stars":"3.5","text":"Great new management.

Took for daughter for her birthday. Mentioned it was her birthday and the server said \\"I'll see if we do anything for that\\" - what? She never did let me know so I wound up buying a dessert. \\n\\nNo bread was offered at the outset - another kind of strange thing for a restaurant. Not only that, you can't order any if you want it. When I mentioned it the server said \\"I don't think there is any on the menu.\\" Again to -this is something she should know. Lunch options were very sparse and did not include smaller steam pots or anything - just a bunch of cheap crap I would never order in a place like this. They charge dinner prices for lunch here, another oddity. Early in the day, they really should have better options.  \\n\\nThere was quite an offering of dishes available, really something for everyone, even those who do not like seafood. The prices are decent for what you get, too. \\n\\nDespite the fact that it was a Monday afternoon and almost no one in the restaurant, it seemed like the server was AOL a lot of the time and while she was nice and good, she really could have attended to our needs a little better. I can't imagine what it would be like if they were really busy. I've noticed this ad a theme in Austin in general - lethargic and slow service everywhere, from restaurants to office stores. It is like I have to hunt people down. Not used to that in Chicago and L.A. Perhaps there just isn't enough competition here to motivate good service.\\n\\nWe decided to order a salad to split since it didn't come with dinner as a side. The  \\nCrab Cake Chipotle Caesar featured romaine lettuce one of huge lump meat crab cake, black bean corn relish, tortilla strips and chipotle Caesar dressing. The crab cake could have been a bit more crispy but otherwise it was very good. One of the first chipotle dressings that didn't burn my mouth off in Austin - another theme here that I find very unnerving. The food in general is way too spicy for an average person and there is usually no warning.\\n\\nI ordered the plain snow crab steampot with a side of corn and french fries. No baked potato is offered - another strangeness for this kind of dish. It was flavorful and plentiful, such that I could have easily shared it. My daughter got the JK Steampot with wine sauce, crab, mussels and scallops, red potatoes and corn. One of the mussels was dead, but other than that she really enjoyed it and was able to eat the whole thing. \\n\\nShe was too stuffed for dessert, and nothing was offered for her birthday -- would it have killed them to offer a scoop of ice cream and a candle? I ordered the turtle sunday and found there to be less of the dark chocolate cake than the picture, mostly consisting of ice cream. It was delicious but I expected more cake on the sides.\\n\\nMy daughter said her white wine was decent, however, there was no mention on the menu that it was even available. As something many people have with a meal like this, it seemed a bit odd not to have it on the menu.\\n\\nWhen you're dropping over $100 for lunch, you expect a little bread at the outset while you wait and a dessert to celebrate a birthday. Other than that, was very happy with the experience. However, as is another theme in Austin - chintzy, chintzy, chintzy! The music was way too loud for these prices, making it hard to talk. TVs everywhere were distracting, too. More like a sports bar ambiance. There was a nice area on the water to eat at, however it was too breezy for me and it would have been nice to have a heater to sit next to.\\n\\nI'd go again - because the meal overall was quite good."},{"name":"Cabo Bob's Burritos","address":"2828 Rio Grande St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Cabo Bob's has to be the best burrito place in town.

One of the reasons we decided to come here was on their Facebook page, they showed a deal for $3 tacos. A few of us were interested in getting them, but we found out it was $3 per taco and only the fish tacos were available for the deal. This wasn't mentioned anywhere on the post about the taco deal, so that was a bit disappointing. Only 1 of us ended up getting tacos and the rest of us got something else. We started with an appetizer of the pretzel bites and they were pretty good. I would recommend getting them. But I ordered the 4 Cheese Pretzel Crust pizza and I was very disappointed. The only thing pretzel like about the crust was that there was salt all over the edge. Otherwise, it tasted like a Tostino's pizza I can buy in the frozen food section of Kroger. It just wasn't very good at all. We did not get any beer, but I know they do have a large beer selection, so maybe I'll go back and get some brews, but the food isn't anything to write home about.

Nice modern chic look with the decor. \\n\\nMenu prices were super reasonable and they do the ordering by number. We ordered the Vietnamese egg rolls and summer rolls for appetizers, and 2 types of pho and the shaken beef rice dish, and an Iced Vietnamese coffee. The pho portions were large, and the shaken beef was served with a few cucumber slices, tomatoes, pickled carrots and daikon, and a small bowl of the pho broth.

My fiance and I got mimosas and they were good, but small. The three of us shared the calamari appetizer, and that was the only good part of our meal. Unfortunately, the calamari took another fifteen minutes and we were almost done with our drinks and had to order more so that we could eat.

I saw it and immediately had to ask for some extra on the side. What the heck are they trying to get away with? I ordered a meal with hollandaise and I want it drowning in it like EVERY other restaurant that offers it. Yucky salmon was also under the eggs.

I tend to order from them because their prices are reasonable and they are easily accessible, but one thing that definitely turns me off from spending my money somewhere is poor customer service. I am writing this long message here because the website has no way of contacting the manager and when I tried asking for the manager in person I was not given that option.\\n\\nYesterday I ordered the Yelp Voucher \\"$15 for $30 Deal at Woody's Pizza & Liquors\\" because it sounded like a great deal. I always read the fine print whenever I make a purchase such as this in order to avoid running into any issues. This voucher specifically said \\"Deal must be honored according to terms on voucher. No additional restrictions may be added at time of redemption.\\" That said, I read the rest of the voucher and found no restrictions other than \\"Promotion lasts for 1 year from date of purchase. After that period, your voucher is redeemable for the amount you paid, less any value you may have received. Not valid with other vouchers, certificates, or offers. Only 1 voucher(s) can be purchased and redeemed per person. Up to 3 can be purchased as gifts for others.\\"\\n\\nI decided to pick up my order instead of delivery to avoid any issues and unfortunately that plan backfired. As soon as I presented my voucher to the girl at the front counter she said she did not know about this deal and that her manager was not there so she showed a few of her co-workers. I told them that I wanted to buy $30 of pizza and liquor (as I usually order), but they told me that this voucher was only redeemable for pizza (additional restriction #1). I asked them how that is possible and they lied telling me that the pizza and liquor are two separate companies (hmmm, the name is called Woody's Pizza & Liquor and I have bought both together in the past). I then went into the liquor side of the store to ask another employee about the voucher and he told me that I need to talk to the manager (the girl at the front counter who told me the manager was not there). Eventually I decided to just forget about the liquor and told them that I'll just take my pizza (total of $20.60), but they told me I must make an order of over $30 in order for the voucher to kick-in and that I have to use the full amount of the voucher on one purchase(additional restriction #2). Even if this additional restriction holds true, it should be written on the voucher that clearly states \\"Deal must be honored according to terms on voucher\\"\\n\\nAt this point I simply gave up and figured I would contact the manager when I got home, but there seems to be no way to do that. \\n\\nI would have completely understood if the employees would have just told me\\"hey sorry, the manager isn't here and we are not familiar with this deal so can you hold on a few minutes while we contact him/her\\" but instead they kept trying to lie. I always shop here so a little customer service could have gone a long way (especially for something as simple as a $15deal). Unless they change the terms on this voucher or make the terms more clear I suggest that you not purchase it because they are not honoring it."},{"name":"The Perfect Bite","address":"3266 Dogwood Dr, Ste B","city":"Hapeville","stars":"3.5","text":"They seem clean but I seen a rat while visiting I paid my money then left An never returned if I could give them no stars I would"},{"name":"Babs","address":"814 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Fast table service and knowledgeable wait staff.

We split a scorpion bowl which was very good (though it was $23), and for apps we had the scallion pancakes which were okay, a little too plain for me, and the beef teriyaki... really good, nice and crispy and full of flavor (though I miss the peanut sauce at thai restaurants). In between app and meal they give you a warm towellette. A nice touch. For meal, I got the mango chicken. It has a very sweet flavor, which is nice, and not spicy at all. Though it sort of tastes like it might have been made with Miracle Whip or something similar! Unfortunately I got fried rice, which was a mistake, because the mango chicken really needed to be paired with some plain old rice. The pork fried rice with bean sprouts was very good, but also very greasy, and didnt compliment my meal, as I said, but was good with his pork dish.

I thought it was just me that the owner bullied into editing my review/improving my initial review.  I figured I'd cut him some slack since he seemed sincere in wanting to do a high quality fast food restaurant and was just getting started.  Still, there's a line that gets crossed that borders on menacing, particularly when he argues any piece of criticism you may have, even if it is constructive.\\n\\nNevertheless, I'll try again, and maybe hope he'll take some of it to heart.\\n\\nAs a tofu lover AND fast food lover and borderline vegetarian, I've been wishing for years that KFC would come out with Extra Crispy Tofu, for those of us who love the KFC flavor and crunch but choose to avoid chicken.\\n\\nSo when I saw that Eat at Jumbo's offered boneless wings made with Tofu, I flipped my lid.  Unfortunately, while the concept of it is 5 stars, and I desperately want to love them, they are, frankly, disgusting.\\n\\nWhat they've done here is taken a container of fresh tofu, and seem to have cut it into six huge pieces - then breaded and fried them.  The first mistake is that they should be getting maybe 24 pieces from the container, not 6.  Their pieces are way too big - insanely too big, so they don't get crunchy.  They just get mushy and fall apart when you try to eat them.  \\n\\nNext, I guess I don't like a lot of their wing sauces.  And the breading alone has no flavor so you absolutely need some sauce.  But the sauce takes like someone poured an entire bottle of bullseye bbq sauce onto 6 pieces of tofu - WAY too sweet and overpouring and WAY too much sauce, so it is almost mush soup.\\n\\nSo to the owner, PLEASE make the piece smaller.  Please use less sauce. Please improve the flavor of the batter.  Please offer a crunchy version like KFC.  Please offer some more 'delicate' options that work better with tofu and maybe even offer it as a dipping sauce instead of pouring it all over everything.\\n\\nFinally, I love Poutine.  LOVE IT.  So few restaurants offer it, that you MUST get it on the rare occasion you have the opportunity.  Poutine is french fries with gravy and curds.  So that the quality is judged significantly by the goodness of the gravy.  The gravy they serve here is oversalty and tastes like it came from a can.  Just not good whatsoever.  And they use mozzarella cheese.  :rolls eyes:.   You need to use curds, not mozzarella.  What you end up instead here is a mush of soggy fries drenched in disgusting sauce...\\n\\nhmm.... sounds like a theme - mushy food in second rate sauce.  Try the poutine at all-star sandwich if you want to know what it SHOULD taste like.\\n\\nApart from that, to the owner I say this - I LOVE the sound of many of the things on your menu, and I love what you're trying to do. But please, don't assume you perfected it the day you opened, or the day you add something to the menu.\\n\\nI doubt I'll eat there anytime soon, but maybe if you take some of the criticism to heart, I'll be back and even become a regular.  Until then... 2 stars."},{"name":"Bertucci's Italian Restaurant","address":"14 Elissa Ave","city":"Wayland","stars":"2","text":"Food is good. But they never get the order right.

If not for restaurant.com we may have never found this fun little place.  I have to say that people are quick to judge and give bad reviews, let alone giving positive reviews.  \\n\\nThe positives outweigh the negatives here.  We should highlight the words \\"Tequila Bar\\".  If you're looking for cheap drinks and a good time, Agave is a good spot for drinks after work or gathering a group.  It's hard to go wrong with $2 margaritas (limit 2) and $2 drafts.  The food prices were reasonable and comparable to what I expect from most Mexican restaurants, including \\"Magaritas\\" that is just up the street from Agave.\\n\\nI'm not the best critic when it comes to Mexican food.  I assume it will undoubtedly result in a couple of trips to the bathroom, but that comes with the territory.  It's easy to pick out flaws at any restaurant.  For example, the keg ran out while we were waiting on a drink.  The waitress came over and asked if we wanted something else as opposed to waiting.  I appreciate the honesty, rather than making a custom wait which I know happens at other restaurants.  To those complaining about the \\"top shelf\\" alcohol prices, Agave is still cheap!  I have a friend who owns a tequila bar in NYC and prices on the same tequila served at Agave are nearly 3x the price down there - and her place is inexpensive for NYC!\\n\\nYou can't expect perfect all the time.

My friend got the spaghetti and meatballs complete meal special.  Well, the salad looked like it was one of those pre-made salads that are poured out of the bag.

Always good, never a problem.\\n\\nBut my girlfriend and I went last night and I'm not really inclined to return, ever.\\n\\nLet me start with the food, which was actually the least of the problems. We had:\\n\\nThe escargot: Now, I am aware of how pricing, especially for escargot works, but I think it was almost 8 dollars for 6 snails that barely had any flavor. They were presented nicely, but the shells were gone and they had a small square of puff pastry over each snail. The pastry was overpowering and the snails, while tender, had barely any flavor other than \\"God, that's a lot of butter.\\"\\n\\nThe chicken croquettes: They describe these as crab cakes but made with chicken. And I like these quite a bit. But the portions were much smaller than I remember, and that was disappointing.\\n\\nCoffee-encrusted pork loin with spicy cherry glaze; mashed yuca; grilled zucchini: This was actually very good. The pork was cooked perfectly and the cherry was a perfect accompaniment. I've had coffee-encrusted steak before, and I think it works better on pork. The milder flavor of the meat allowed the coffee to come through and interact with the cherry really nicely.\\n\\nPaella: This is what my girlfriend ordered and it was the blandest, least flavorful paella either of us have ever tasted. She added tons of salt just to make it remotely palatable. The mussels were tough, and the claimed that the sausage tasted like those bright red hot dogs you find at small-town ballparks. It was just so bad.\\n\\nThe OTHER thing, besides the food that is going to keep me from returning is our waiter. I have never interacted with such a pompous guy. He kept slipping in and out of a fake-sounding accent; he brought out our entrees while we were still eating our appetizers and gave us a huffy look when we didn't rush to move our plates. And THEN, at one point he stops by to ask how the food is. \\"Fine,\\" we say. He, honest to god, raises an eyebrow and says \\"Oh. Just FINE?\\" And then leaves. No asking what's wrong, is there anything that can be improved, just this pronouncement like WE'RE the unsophisticated assholes who think this apparently life-changing food is just \\"fine.\\"  \\n\\nAnd to top it off, when he brought our check he turned around and started ambling away as he was finishing talking. So it started out \\"Okay, well (then in a mumbled voice because his back is now turned) goodbyeandhaveanicenight). Whatever, man. That was just rude.

The space felt unclean. We were seated at a very cramped table that abutted a clear glass wall with fingerprints and food splashes on it. That grossed me out. Then the laminated menus were sticky. Gross again. The coffee mugs had fingerprints and stains on the exterior and were filled to noticeably different levels (another detail, but still). The service was extremely slow (they may have been understaffed for the post Christmas traffic). Lastly, the biscuits that my party was looking forward to were below average. The apple butter made ALL the difference but on their own, these biscuits were bland and dry.

I work in customer service so when I get good service I really appreciate the time and effort put into giving great service and Jamie definitely did that. She accommodated all of my requests even though there was a lag since we were corresponding via email.
