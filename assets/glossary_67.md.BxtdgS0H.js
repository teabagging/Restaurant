Here I will provide a chronological progression of my descent into hunger-fueled fury. \\n\\n6:15PM: I decided to live a little and treat my belly to something special. As I rode the T home from a long week at work, I pondered over my usual options. The little voice inside my head told me I could go bolder. I could go meatier. I could go RIBS! \\n\\n6:20PM: I present my case to my sympathetic girlfriend. She agrees in quite possibly the easiest decision made among any couple in the history of mankind. After deciding to skip the cold and turn down our favorite (Sweet Cheeks), we settle on delivery from an old acquaintance: Soul Fire. \\n\\n6:30PM: After agonizing over which sides to get with my half rack of baby back, we finally reach the checkout page on Foodler. Usually, this is where I think ahead to my future self: will tomorrow me hate present me for this decision? Probably. But for whatever reason, I went with my gut and clicked the little orange button that led us into quite possibly the worst food experience I've ever had since moving to Boston 3 years ago. \\n\\n6:50PM: We begin checking the clock wondering how much longer until delicious BBQ will be descended upon our esophagi. Alas, it has only been 20 minutes since we ordered. \\n\\n7:05PM: Surely, it's been at least an hour and the food is late. False. We check the email to make sure. Estimated delivery of 7:40.\\n\\n7:30PM: We begin salivating uncontrollably. The end is in sight. Must convince girlfriend not to call until 7:40. \\n\\n7:41PM: Girlfriend is on the phone. Soul Fire says the driver left the restaurant over 30 min. ago and will be there in, and I quote, \\"No time\\". \\n\\n7:50PM: Hunger pangs set in. So. Close. Yet. So. Far. \\n\\n7:51PM: We begin pacing back and forth to the window. Every car that passes on the street below carries so much hope. Brake lights set us up for disappointment every time. \\n\\n8:00PM: After \\"some time\\", which is 20 minutes longer than \\"no time\\", I begin wondering if we even ordered food at all. Could this all be a dream? \\n\\n8:15PM: I call. I explain our situation to the Angel on the phone (really, her name was Angel) and am put on hold for what felt like an eternity. Angel assures me the driver is en route and will be there soon. All of my worst fears begin bubbling up, and I ask Angel if she thinks the food will be warm when it arrives since it's been on the road for over an hour (admittedly, a trick question). Her response? There will be a manager in the restaurant tomorrow if the food sucks. Awesome. Setting the expectations for me real high here...We end the call. \\n\\n8:20PM: Pacing continues. I feel like a kid on Christmas waiting for Santa Claus. We begin to ponder the option of Easy Mac. \\n\\n8:37PM: This was the moment we'd been waiting for. We raced down the stairs, grabbed the food from the driver, and immediately ran back to home base to check inventory and provide a status report. Initial tests suggest cold food. After further inspection, we determine that the food is indeed cold with a 95% confidence interval. \\n\\n8:39PM: We realize the severity of our situation and compose ourselves before making any rash decisions. We've already waited 2 hours to eat this damn food so the oven is surely out of the question. I typically cringe at the idea of reheating \\"fresh\\" food in a microwave, but desperate times call for desperate measures. \\n\\n8:42PM: While watching the aesthetically unpleasing ribs and mashed potatoes spin round and round, I quickly lose hope for what I once imagined to be a delicious meal worth my hard earned money. Depression sinks in. \\n\\n8:43PM: The moment of truth. I'll spare you all the gritty details and honestly say I'd rather eat my own underwear than eat the food I was so excited about once upon a time. I forced myself to suffer through 2 ribs and several hopeless bites of cafeteria-style mashed potatoes before throwing in the towel. \\n\\n_______\\n\\nNow, I'm usually the kind of guy who will eat anything. I never send back food at a restaurant and will never ever complain about something that is a bit sub-par. However, this experience has changed my entire perspective on life and has me reconsidering if I ever want to eat again. \\n\\nTo be fair, all restaurants have challenges. I've worked in several and know how hard a busy rush can be. But those who emerge victorious are those who put every effort into the final product when the fork meets the food.

I came as part of a birthday dinner party of 11 and the staff put together a tasting menu for the group.  Some highlights included the Birdseed Bread with a delicate whipped egg white spread, flavorful brussel sprouts, a diverse charcuterie board, and the Shrimp Toast.   While the potato risotto gnocchi was perfectly pillowly and textured, the sauce was overly salty and drowned out the dish.  The Tuna Tiradito was also very heavy on the salt.  Finally, the restaurant insisted on their $5 per person cake cutting fee.  I understand the policy, but it was a little disappointing given the food and alcohol our table had consumed.  I think it would have been a reasonable exception to make from a customer service perspective rather than having the dinner end on a slight downturn.   Instead, we ordered two dessert boards to avoid the cake cutting fee. Unfortunately, the cake from H mart was much more standout than anything on the dessert board."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Granted, it was Friday, a poor choice to seek dinner out for a self-professed misanthrope like myself, but two things struck me before I even got to taste any food. One, there was a long-ish wait with a list and a crowd of people stuck in the front entry room waiting, yet I counted 6 empty tables. They remained empty for quite some time, in fact, and it was about 45 minutes before we were seated. It seems there are some glitches in their seating process that need to be worked out.  Second, everybody (except me) seemed to have a squallering infant in tow, so that plus the music meant the noise level was fairly rattling. \\nAs for the food, I wish I could rave about the burgers, but there I was disappointed. I chose the special \\"Farm Burger\\" which was beef, lamb and foie gras with blue cheese and carmelized onions for 16 dollars. All I could taste was the foie gras, and the whole thing was pretty greasy. My friend's Lamb burger with pickled beet and cheese was much tastier and not dripping with grease; if I were to return, I'd pick that one instead. Fries were pretty good, hand cut and fresh--we got the special black and white fries with truffle oil and squid ink aioli, which made them extra tasty. The pickle plate was the best thing I had there with a selection of homeade pickled vegetables. \\nIn short, if I didn't have to wait, I'd give it another shot, if only because it's relatively close....but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.

I need to tell you about this little barbecue shack in Austin that literally no one has ever heard about.  I discovered it on Yelp when it had just 600-some reviews and a 4.5 star average.  You need to go here before it gets too popular.\\n\\nLunch at Franklin Barbecue is, admittedly, an ordeal.  Doors open at 11:00 and if you don't show up early, you run the risk of standing in a long outdoor line, only to have all the meat sell out in front of you.  That sounded terrible, so my family did some research and lined up at 10:00.  We came on a Tuesday, so an hour before opening was fine.  It looks like you want to play it safer on the weekends.  Q: How much do you like barbecue?  A: You won't know until you line up and try it here.\\n\\nIt was blistering hot out, and we were lucky enough to get an early spot in the shade.  The first people in line brought folding chairs.  Smart.  The hour crept by, but I made friends with an adorable baby with a Facebook fan page.  As 11:00 approached, a Franklin employee came out to size up our orders.  She asked how many pounds we wanted of each meat, and as she recommended three pounds for our party of five, we went with one pound brisket, and a half pound of everything else.  (This order was for prep and estimation purposes, and wasn't binding.)  When the doors opened, the line went inside and moved at a reasonable pace.  The interior was very casual and comfortable, with a fun, busy, sociable ambiance.  Service at the register was friendly, and once we had our food we had no problem finding a table, as saving tables without food was not allowed.  We spread out with trays lined with butcher paper, and plenty of napkins.\\n\\nThe food was superb, maybe the best barbecue I've had in my life.  The brisket was definitely the best, just amazing, mouthwatering meat, juicy and meltingly tender with smokey flavor and a nice crust.  If I lived within fifty miles of Austin, I'd brave a journey and a line to have that brisket again.  The rest of the meats were also fantastic.  I loved the thick, zesty sausage and the succulent glazed ribs.  The turkey was moist and meaty with a lemony spiced crust.  The only meat that didn't wow me was the pulled pork, which was slightly blander and drier than the others.  Still good, though, no question about that.\\n\\nWe feasted on our meat with three barbecue sauces, ranging from light to dark, with varying levels of sweetness and vinegar pucker.  I liked all three and mixed them freely.  The sides were not as good as the meat (I think Salt Lick loses to Franklin on meat but wins on sides by a landslide), but they were decent enough.  The cole slaw was nice for vegetable presence, if not quite as crisp or tangy as I would have liked.  The potato salad and pinto beans were average, but good to have with the barbecue.  The most crucial side, I thought, was the pickled jalape√±o, which we bought a few of to slice up and share.  I love pickled jalape√±o, and its crunch and spice went beautifully with the meat.  I washed down my lunch with a $4 glass of Live Oak Big Bark amber ale.  It hit the spot.\\n\\nFor dessert, we picked up two miniature pies, provided by an Austin bakery called Cake and Spoon.  We ordered it with our meat, which I believe is the way you're supposed to do it.  The small pies came in little paper pouches which we opened when we'd had our fill of barbecue.  They were delicious.  I loved both the bourbon banana and the lemon chess pie.  The bourbon banana filling was smooth and lickable, loaded with pure banana flavor with a sweet bourbon edge.  The crust was crumbly, and folded into the creamy filling with delectable ease.  The lemon chess pie was even better, the tart bright curd just right with a buttery pastry crust.  Franklin is too busy churning out meat to make its own desserts, and I give the place credit for choosing Cake and Spoon to supplement the barbecue menu.\\n\\nWe stuffed ourselves with barbecue and pie and left around noon, full and content.  Two hours in and out wasn't bad, really, but I did feel for the giant line we passed on our way to our car.  I hope to come back to Austin in the not-too-distant future, and when I do, I will line up again for Franklin, at least an hour before it opens."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I really hope the Octo-dog existed way before Octo-mom.

BUT the food is most definitely worth the wait. The wait is only like...30 minutes long. Trust me it's totally worth it. \\n\\nRecommendation: \\n\\nTonkatsu Original: I'm a purist at heart and so I believe the only way to judge the true worth of a ramen shop is with their most basic bowl. The broth is deliciously thick and rich. I do not find the broth too salty, but I have heard many people complain of that so be warned. I find each spoonful to be perfectly rich and flavorful, full of that creamy pork flavor I have come to love. You can really appreciate the artisan level of care they take to make their broth. The noodles are perfectly done with just enough bite and absorbency to suck up the broth. The pork belly is also done exceptionally well. I have yet to eat a pork belly as tender and juicy as that of Tatsu-Ya's. The meat basically melts into the broth at the lightest tap of your chopsticks. It's flavors compliment so well with the saltiness of the broth. The Ajitama egg is also done wonderfully. Lightly boiled so that the yolk is semi-molten and marinated so that it has that phenomenal sweet soy flavor. YUM! \\n\\nTonkotsu Sho-Yu: If you are worried about the broth being too salty then I recommend this option. It has a lighter, more refreshing taste than the Original. I find the Original has the feeling of a Thanksgiving turkey - rich and meaty, while the Sho-Yu is fresher and less dense. More like a matzo ball soup with cabbage (if that makes any sense LOL). \\n\\nKatsu Slider: Sweet bread, hot crispy pork. The cutlet is fried to perfection: hot, crispy panko on the outside, yet so moist and juicy on the inside. The salty cutlet paired with the sweet Hawaiian bread and hoisin sauce is the perfect marriage of salty and sweet. Too bad it only lasts about three bites! I would recommend you at least try this dish once, but it really isn't worth the price to get repeatedly. \\n\\nNah:\\n\\nTsukumen: I had never heard of dipping ramen before I tried it here. I wasn't a fan of the sweet and sour broth that pairs with the dish. It reminded me more of mexican tacos than ramen. It was too sour for my tastes and didn't have that warm, salty, brothy taste that I'm familiar with. Despite all that, I do believe it was good in its own right.

They only reason I'm giving them a less than stellar review is because they didn't treat my party very well this past weekend.\\nMy roomate and I share a birthday, and we brought maybe 15 people there to eat and drink. They wouldn't accept reservations, so we put in our name but were told we had to wait for our whole party to arrive, understandably. We had been drinking for about an hour and half before everyone showed up, they told us it would then take a half an hour to sit us and they pointed out a table near the front they were getting ready. After about a half hour, we saw that they sat a much smaller group at the table. When we asked about this, they said they were trying to clear a table for us in the basement, they were waiting for another party to leave. When we asked why the original table wasn't being used for us, they basically shrugged and said another party had come in.\\nThey weren't apologetic, they knew it was our birthdays and we had all just dropped about $200 on drinks for the last 2 hours. Then when we were walking away we heard them laughing at us like we had been unreasonable. Very disappointed since I've been giving them my business and praise for years, will probably not go back here again."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"After a second try, I am much less impressed. First of all, the veggie slider should definitely be renamed the Black Bean slider. And as far as black bean burgers go... not so great. Sort of just mush, and the slider overall was way too dry.

That's a pretty good deal.  They brought out cornbread to start with three types of spreads - honey molasses butter, apricot spread, and a raspberry cayenne spread.  The cornbread was delicious and very different from the normal cornbread you get everyday.  They use blue cornmeal.  Absolute harmony = cornbread w/ the honey molasses butter.  We had the burrito which is like an upscale version of the breakfast burrito at McDonald's.  The other small plate was the granola w/ yogurt and tropical fruit.  To be honest, it wasn't very tropical.  It had a few scoops of watermelon, and a few cubes of pineapple, but the rest of it was just a regular fruit salad.  The granola was quite good though.  Finally, the mac & cheese dish... This was probably one of the most heaviest dishes I've had in a while.  They used smoked gouda for the cheese which was absolutely creamy.  They had chunks of sausage (kind of like andouille sausage) and some veggies.  It was breaded up top and drizzled with a sweet & mesquite barbeque sauce.  Heaven!  This is the ultimate comfort food.

We were using a groupon and it was the last night before it expired so the place was packed (apparently everyone had waited till the last minute to redeem haha).  We put our name in and then stood in the bar area drinking beers.  We waited over half an hour but all the girls working were very friendly and kept checking in with us.  Once we sat down, the waitress informed us that they had run out of bread so sandwiches were not an option.  I was a little bummed because I wasn't sure i wanted to go for a whole platter, but this stuff happens when restaurants get slammed unexpectedly so you really can't blame them.  Might have been a good idea for them to have sent someone to the grocery store for some emergency back-up rolls but whatever.  I ended up getting the BBQ pulled pork platter with collard greens and cole slaw.  The meat was to de for.  The cornbread was sweet and moist.  The cole slaw and collard greens we typical- they were absolutely fine but nothing special.  They brought a selection of 4 different BBQ sauces that ranged from carolina vinegar-style to super sweet memphis-style to super spicy.  Great sauce, great bbq, beer, and good blues music = solid 4 stars.  I think they need to rethink the interior decor though-the screaming red and yellow grafitti-style murals are a bit harsh and garish.

Decor is above average for a Mexican restaurant and bar, with an eclectic blend of hanging objects and lights, oversized fake plants and bright colors. They have a large outdoor covered patio with heaters but it was still too cold on this Feb night to brave. Looked like it would be nice for the Spring/Summer though.\\n\\nWe were seated in a large u-shaped booth that could accommodate 8-10 adults. Cozy, but somewhat impractical for those people in the middle - tough to get out during the meal, and everthing has to be passed all the way in via 4-5 people...\\n\\nAnyway, initial service was prompt with the usual offering of chips and salsa. Chips were warm, light and fresh though a bit greasy. Salsa was flavorful and fresh with a nice hint of roasted pepper and cilantro; a spicier salsa was available on request, but still was relatively mild by our group's standards.\\n\\nWhile none of us partook of the bar offerings, it did seem that they had a lot of tasty and creative concoctions served in unique glassware.\\n\\nThe food was overall above-average for a Mexican restaurant, but nothing to wow over. My wife and I shared a Filet Vaquero which was 16 oz for $30 and came with a side of very garlicky but tasty mashed potatoes and some red onion rings that had a nice batter but were way too salty for me. We had an additional side of the jicama slaw which was very good with nice texture and flavor. Another in our party had the goat cheese enchiladas which had a unique blend of flavors that worked well together.\\n\\nDesserts options were as good as I've seen at any Mexican place. We sampled the sopapillas (concensus best), the citrus cake (rated second - tasted kind of like a key lime cheesecake), the quatro leches (so-so unless you're a big tres leches fan), the chocolate cake (a bit too dry, but interesting with the ancho chile flavor) and the brownie sundae (nothing special). The sopapillas were nice and light, drizzled with honey resulting in just the right amount of crunch and sweetness - need to eat it fast though before it gets soggy. Coffees were bold and rich served in large mugs.\\n\\nThe service was friendly, but way too slow. Estimated over 45 minute wait for dinner and 25 minutes for desserts. They added a 20% gratuity as we were a party of 8, and this was more than they deserved if you ask me.\\n\\nIn summary, this was a nice meal with a few inspired twists on traditional Mexican - some that worked and some that didn't, but service was too slow and price was up there.

Our Chinatown is horrendously small, and the selection is very narrow. That being said, there are a few gems (such as Gourmet Dumpling House and the new Hot Pot Buffet, Little Q out in Arlington), but I'm convinced the only reason ANYONE thinks Hei La Moon is great is because we see the long lines and think everyone else must know something.\\n\\nFirst off, the dim sum itself is extremely meh. I've been coming here for years, and I think they are getting sloppier with their food. It isn't really that good, and sometimes it's downright bad.  They are often lacking in dim sum staples (dumplings, pork spare ribs, soy milk with crullers, for example) and what they do have often presents quite the mystery how it made it out of the kitchen (recently had some donkey meat balls - donkey meat was bland, the whole thing was overseasoned with something awful that made it taste like sewer water treated with iodine). For a smaller, less machine-like experience where the food's quality hasn't been watered  down quite as much, I'd suggest Mary Chung's in Central Square. Nevermind the fact that the carts don't circulate in any sort of orderly fashion and it's completely a crapshoot what kind of experience you get.\\n\\nSecond, the service is horrendous. I truly believe that the management here is awful - they've learned that they are popular, and are riding on their coattails and have completely forgotten how to treat people. My party had a parking mishap (apparently similar to other experiences on this site), and the manager was completely unresponsive. Apparently there is some sort of deal where if you pay the garage people full price for parking ($11), and then pay the management $6 more, you can get your $11 back from the garage attendant. Completely a lie!!! The woman at the restaurant didn't even look at me, took my parking stub, and shoved a sticker at me that was hanging off her thumb. What was I supposed to do with this sticker? I have no idea, but I took the sticker and put it on a post-it I had in my bag. The parking attendant took pity on me that she had taken essentially the only proof I had of ever having paid my $11 and let me out of the garage without a fuss. I went back to the restaurant to get my parking stub back, at which the woman started going beserk on me about how it was MY FAULT that I had lost the parking stub and that I shouldnt be bothering her. I explained that, no, I had not lost it, and that she had forgotten to give it back to me. She refused to even acknowledged me and picked up a ringing phone and stood with her back to me. I was furious and went back to the parking attendant (Central Parking), who explained that this sort of thing happened all the time. He took pity and gave me my $11 back anyway.\\n\\nI returned to the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager. The waiter I found said that there was no manager, at which I started explaining to him in Chinese a message I wanted left with the management. At which a man who had been sitting at the table next to us the entire time started chastizing me about causing trouble for problems I had caused on my own. I informed him that since I had paid him for my parking as well as the fee charged by the actual garage, that he in fact was stealing from me. He told me, in not so many words, to shove it.\\n\\nThis was absolutely ridiculous. Bottom line: they do not value you as a customer.

There were 100 people in line or so out the door and around the corner. 50 or more people showed behind me but all left but 5 or so eventually. This man kept coming out saying we have 800 pounds of meat left, but it looks promising, you might get some food, etc. He had a shit eating grin on his face each time. It felt like he was just hyping the place up. People behind me kept leaving but I knew better. When I arrived the sold out sign was already posted on the door. Guess that it just stays there all the time. I got served at 1:45. They were out of everything except lean brisket, which was fine because I like it better than fatty brisket anyway. But wait,  then he found 2 links of sausage magically and I took one. And then.... I was given a free chopped beef sandwich. I didn't decline it. The brisket was very good. Nice and smoky and crispy and lean but a little salty and slightly dry. Still, it was the best I have bought from a restaurant compared to what my dad cooks at home. I know it's hard to consistently smoke mass quantities of brisket. I don't win every time at home, but it's hard to find something for sale in a restaurant that beats what you can do at home after years of practice. Franklin impressed me on my first visit. The sausage was oily, had a tough casing, but good flavor. I could have left it. I like lean sausage. I know that's an oxy-moron, but you get the idea. The chopped beef had a unique flavor all its own which was salty sweet, and just pretty dang good and tasty. Naturally, the brisket and chopped beef had a great smoke flavor. The potato salad was bland and the pickles and onions were from Sysco or some similar generic food supply company. When I left they were \\"closed\\". I self-bussed my tray to the inside and met the owner. I told him what I'm telling you and he was impressed I thought his brisket was up there with my dad's, which it was close. We also talked about how Kruetz is shit, Salt Lick is mediocre,  which they are, etc., He then produced a rack of ribs as my welcome gift which I took home ate later. They were very good, a little sweet and nice and smoky but not too salty. Franklin has something. There were 3 sauces. One was runny and just a little sweet, the other was thicker and saltier and the espresso sauce was thick, sweet and unique having that coffee undertone. The meat did not need sauce though. I ate most of my brisket without any sauce. It was that good, save for the slight dryness. Try finding another barbecue restaurant, except for your own backyard, if you are a weekend warrior pit boss, where the meat tasted better without sauce. Like I said, Franklin has something, not everything... but he's got brisket down."},{"name":"Dim Sum Cafe","address":"679 Fellsway W","city":"Medford","stars":"2.5","text":"Hello, I was happy to see a restaurant pop up just a few blocks away from me.

I chose the Salmon and ordered veggies with it. I thought it was perfectly cooked and delicious and was actually a bit sad when I had finished it. My husband went with the double boned pork chop. Sadly it was over cooked and dry, despite him requesting that he wanted it cooked mid rare. Which is how most places are cooking it these days. So for him it definitely was not worth the money. My daughter ordered the Crab Cakes. She absolutely loved them. I wish I could have eaten them but sadly they were not gluten free.

And so, we stopped to refuel our energy levels. \\n\\nAs it appears, Soul Fire is in the midst of becoming a full service restaurant. While it may take longer for sit down than to just go up to the counter, we didn't mind. I had an Arnold Palmer for the first time, which apparently is just half lemonade and half iced tea? I just call that a half and half, who knew there was a proper name for it. At any rate, it was the perfect ratio of tea to lemonade as well as sweetness levels. In case you didn't know, they also have free refills, so make sure you order the smaller once instead. ;-) \\n\\nFor my entree, I just couldn't decide, since I wanted everything. And so I ended up getting the combination meal which consisted of 2 BBQs meats, 2 sides, cornbread, and pickles. I chose the brisket and the spare ribs, with the collard greens and another side I can't remember. Personally for the price, I felt that the portions were a bit small. I could have definitely used a bit more brisket. They gave me 3 spare ribs. \\nNow, while I took the rest of my food home, since I only ate a little because I had just ran, normally I would expect more food on my plate. \\n\\nSoul Fire definitely filled my BBQ craving. And they also have 4 sauces on the table that you can user. Personally I liked the Soul Fire one. There was another sauce I favored, but can't remember the name. \\n\\nSo the verdict, I would rather go to Soul Fire than RedBones if I had to choose. At least Soul Fire has good ribs.

We were lucky enough to come here as a group of 3 as the dishes all had three portions. My only issue is that the dishes were served too quickly. We didn't have enough time to chat in between dishes and were far too tempted by the dishes coming in to do much else!\\n\\nTomato salad with buttermilk cheese, balsamic jelly, olive and potato bark: This was a really yummy take on a classic combination of cheese, tomato, and balsamic. The olive and potato bark (which has a texture like a thick-cut potato chip) added a really nice salty crunch in contrast to the other textures \\n\\nConfit Albacore Tuna, white bean puree, garlic toast: Growing up, I was always put off by tuna as I hate the smell of the stuff that comes from the tin. This was really delicious and restored my faith in tuna. Smooth bean puree came through the meaty chunks of tuna which made my belly very happy. I only wish there was more toast to scoop up the rest of the tuna!\\n\\nPork belly, maple meringue, apple slaw, pork rinds: Speaking of belly, this was another favourite. I am a huge fan of salty/sweet combinations and this was absolutely lovely. I don't really know what Canadian cuisine entails but the maple meringue definitely added another rich, sweet layer of flavour (I'm sure there's more to it!)

Although we arrived just after 1pm, it looked and sounded like the staff, both servers and kitchen, were done for the day.  We finally were greeted after waiting so long that we had gotten up from our hard, unpadded booth to get our own menus.  Even though we were assured that any food order would be prepared in just a few minutes, it was a significantly longer wait.  The table that entered before us also had a long wait, which I found strange, considering that including all of us, there were only four tables being served.  We weren't checked on until we were nearly finished, or I might have said something about the food.  (And the kitchen staff coming out front for breaks wearing sweat-soaked shirts was rather unappetizing.)  \\n\\nThe food.  Bad.  The biscuits were hard and dry, with one of mine a flat patty obviously hand-shaped from the last piece of leftover dough.  I love sausage gravy but theirs was floury and bland, except for a strange tang it had like mayonnaise, and it was served to me in a giant bowl on the side, filled to the brim.  It was like a really terrible \\"Southern-style\\" gravy I had in California once, and I had a humungous bowl of it to stare at through the meal.  Yuck.   \\n\\nMy eggs were seared on the outside and undercooked on the inside, and they swam in a pool of yellow cooktop grease.  The sausage patties, while they had a nice peppery flavor, must have been cooked in the morning and left under a heat lamp because they were totally devoid of moisture.  Since we learned the fried chicken and waffle actually used chicken fingers and not whole chicken, my companion opted for the biscuit bowl instead.  Sadly, it arrived drowned in that same terrible gravy.\\n\\nThe only saving grace was the breakfast potatoes, which admittedly were some of the best I've ever had.

Amanda had the Tipsy Texan and we shared potato salad and beans.\\n\\nThe brisket: VERY peppery (which is not a bad thing at all). It was exactly as tender as the white bread I ate it with, but it was firm enough to stand up on its own. I got a little burnt end also that was PACKED with flavor! Almost too intense to eat, but rewarding for those that can handle it. Best brisket I've ever eaten.\\n\\nThe ribs: WOW! I'm officially ruined on all other ribs! I used to be a Salt Lick guy for ribs, but this was a brand new type of flavor for me. Clean off the bone; absolutely ZERO meat left on the bone. Very easy to eat. Ribs were far and away the best I've had and actually rivaled the brisket as the top meat o' the day.\\n\\nThe sausage: Very crispy casing; lots of snap. However, the beef flavor overpowered the pork flavor in his mix which I didn't like as much as an Elgin sausage or a Lockhart style. I'm still going to give the edge to Southside Market on this one, but it was very good.\\n\\nBeans were ok; not a ton of flavor compared to the meats but definitely better than John Mueller's (which were very salty.) Potato salad was much better than I expected! It was almost a dead ringer of the homemade potato salad I grew up with back home. I think he's in cahoots with my mom. Very mustard-y and tangy. Highly recommend.\\n\\nBasically, arrived around 9:45 and ate at noon. Would I do it again? Absolutely. Without hesitation. Staff was VERY friendly and cool. Aaron Franklin came out to everyone's table and hung out for photos. He even took the actual photo for a family at a table, which was cool. Seems like a humble, down-to-earth guy that makes killer -que.\\n\\nAlso, I'm not a sauce guy but I used his sauces at the end of my meal once I tasted all the meats. Most sauces overpower the taste of the meat and the seasoning and you wind up with the meat being a vessel for BBQ sauce. His is the ONLY sauce I've had that complemented the meat in such a way that it enhanced the flavor of the meat and stayed in the background. You know it's there, but the meat is still the star of the show. Rare feat Mr. Franklin!!!"},{"name":"Fuji At WoC","address":"1420 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"So so so good.

There were times when we didn't even SEE our server for up to 12 minutes at a time, and taking into consideration the fact that she left us with two sets of chopsticks for four people, no napkins, and two empty water glasses, I was beginning to get upset. Additionally, while I appreciate a restaurant that brings your food out as it's ready, that appreciation dwindles when each item comes out either warm (sushi) or cold (noodles) in whatever state is the opposite of your expectation - and then to be told after we'd already eaten everything else that the kitchen was \\"backed up\\" but it's okay, they put a \\"rush\\" on the noodles? We'd already been there for an hour! What \\"rush?\\"\\n\\nThen I saw the state of the restrooms, and that was it for me. Never again.

The dish also came with two eggs made your way and a biscuit. Biscuit was perfectly baked with a crunchy exterior and a soft, fluffy center.

They both just blankly stared at our groups, confused as to what they should do.  The first group said they were looking for a table and the woman walked off, leaving the confused man, who continued to stare at us all blankly.  They repeat they want a table, then we do as well.  He looks at the computer for a few seconds and then says that we have to wait for the woman to get back.  She gets back and we go through this all again.  She tells the man something and he gets menus and walks off.  Both of our groups are looking at each other like \\"Should we follow?  Whose table is he seating?\\" The woman goes over and explains to him again what was going on and he waved us all over.  Then the woman explains to the groups who is going where.  This took a solid 5 minutes.  At this point, we're literally laughing and wondering what Twilight Zone episode we were about to be part of.  It didn't get any better than this.\\n\\nThe confused man hovered creepily the entire service.  We weren't sure what function he held in the restaurant, as we saw him do absolutely nothing, and honestly considered asking him if he was lost at one point, thinking he escaped from a home somewhere nearby.

Bonnie Bambinelli has presided over this little family owned Italian gem for years.  I have been visiting Bambinelli's for over twenty years, originally going for lunch with co-workers; as we all worked for AT&T (which was all over Tucker, at that time,) Bambi's became our favorite spot!  We especially loved the hot meatball subs, the eggplant parmigiana and the fettuccine alfredo.  When there, also try their spaghetti and meatballs or spaghetti marinara. There is something about their sauce that is truly addicting and makes you crave more.  I no longer work in the area, living almost 30 miles away, and I still find myself compelled to drive there for lunch on my day off, or for an early dinner.  (They re-open for dinner at 4:00 p.m.)  I always order one or two additional entries to go and freeze them.  In that way, I can satisfy my craving over the weeks in between visits.  I have even been known to order the LARGE Bambi's special thin crust pizza - just for me!  I freeze two slices per Ziploc.  Ummm!  Not as good as when it is served piping hot to the table straight from the oven, but better than Pizza Hut's mystery meat.  \\n\\nBonnie's Italian sausage on the pizza is sliced in long, thin strips.

So of course I was excited to hear they were opening up near my workplace.  But... I was a little leery because I also remember paying $15 for my burger in Miami.  For that location, that's a bargain for a well-made burger.  Not for the UCF area, however.  My fears of having to pay too much for lunch were realized a few weeks ago when I went there with two of my colleagues.  Three burgers, three fountain drinks, plus tip (which wasn't even deserved considering how much we had to wait to be seated and for our food)... nearly two hours later... $70.  That's insane, and unacceptable.       \\n\\nWhat is hurting this place is not the food quality per se (the Hotel California is actually quite good)... but it's the restaurant's exhorbitant prices given the location and the clientele it's presumably catering to.  You can't expect to do well in the UCF area when there are: \\n\\n1) College students with limited disposable income that far outnumber the amount of working professionals looking for food options during their daily lunch hour. \\n\\n2) Far better burger options nearby.  I'm sorry, but the signature burgers at Jimmy Hula's are not only tastier, but between 30-50% cheaper than B&BJ.  Add a side order of fries and fountain drink and you're still able to come in right around what B&BJ charges for some of their \\"meatier\\" burgers (but with no fountain drink, mind you).  You can even do Burger 21, Ruby Tuesdays, or Applebees and come in around $12 (including tip).  And now... oh boy... with Bar Louie opening up across the street... they have some killer burgers as well... and yes, most of them cheaper than what's offered at B&BJ.  May this be a fruitful outcome for all those involved in the \\"University Blvd. Burger War\\".             \\n\\n3) Right next door to 4Rivers, which offers some of the absolute best food platters anywhere... and for under $10.\\n\\n4) Located in what seems to be a \\"condemned building.\\"  Perkins did poorly there, and Culpepper's barely opened.  \\n\\nMaybe if they offered lunch specials between $8-10, including drink.

The burger patty was about one of the blandest things I'd ever tasted. No real seasoning on the meat, and no sauces to even compliment the carne. The lettuce isn't much of a flavor adder either since it's mostly water, and the the tomato wasn't ripe, so it was bland and mildly tart if anything.

The local mixed greens salad I thought was okay with crispy kale and some oily dressing, which would have done much nicer with some honey mustard/sweet balsamic drizzled on top. The onion soup was probably the star of the meal which is weird, but it had truffle oil and was really impressively nice when you dipped the fried mozarella sticks in! \\n\\nFor entrees we ordered the Crispy Flounder Filet (with uni shrimp sauce) and the Easter Rabbit Special. \\n\\nThe crispy flounder filet was actually okay, but the sauce was way too overpowering. It also came with fried lotus and a fried something else that tasted carby and floury. The shrimp was something you buy from the supermarket and not very fresh. \\n\\nThe Easter Rabbit special was something we thought we'd try, but it also wasn't very good. Came in a bowl of mush and had something like a mashed potato underneath it. Sounds horrible doesn't it. to top it off it had cheese and was just a gooey bowl of stuff with meat in it. \\n\\nI can't believe this was one of Groupon's bestsellers, and that Yelp gave it 5 stars at the time I bought it (both reasons I bought the groupon). \\n\\nDessert we had the upside down pineapple cake which was pretty good! \\n\\nSo overall i would say the try items the onion soup and pineapple cake, but the main entrees of the meal were a huge disappointment. for the groupon I do have to note they did charge like $4 tax, which is fine but wasn't really mentioned on the deal.

Twice now since my last review and both visits were even better than the first .  The overall quality and experience here is consistently superb.  Okay, I'll just admit it right now - - Ramen Tatsu-Ya is my new crack, yet unlike the street drug where (they say) one can never achieve a high as good as the first time, it's the total opposite with these guys - - it gets better and better with each visit.  \\n\\nThis is also the only time I can recall (while writing my initial review) the craving for their ramen became so (God Blessed) insatiable, I deviated from my evening activities to make the time to go back.  Yeah, I think I'm addicted, I have a problem.    \\n\\nAfter a swim @ the gym I immediately head over to find a respectable line.  But that doesn't matter anymore, it's so damn good it's well worth the wait.  I made the most of my time in line by meeting some new acquaintances along w/ some up and coming hipsters (who felt the same way about the potency of this place), the 40 min flew by and I was ready to order. \\n\\nThis time Chiai was manning the register, and this cute hipster girl (CHG) definitely has her act together.  She was very patient, polite, and professional as I ordered the #1 (again) thanks to the incredible broth + pork belly.  I added extra garlic, nori, and a Fire bowl to spice it up (her recommendation).  My new Foodie Friends said the Chashu Bowl was also a must.  CHG scans the dining room and asked if it was okay to seat me at a specific table - it turns out she picked the perfect grazing area for me, so I naturally obliged.  \\n\\nThey must be on some speed here cuz the food's out in a flash, and the #1 ramen was - again - nothing short of phenomenal.  I got plenty of press-ur-own garlic cloves and I absolutely love-love-love the Fire In A Bowl!!  I'm so glad Chiai recommended it  - - excellent suggestive selling as it lives up to its name and has a nice umami zing to it.  All that's missing is a jar w/ a label and I'd be more than happy to order a case.  The Chashu Bowl was superb, the pork belly was soft and flavorful and the ginger took it to a whole new level - - almost like a party in your mouth it's definitely a must-try.  \\n\\nOn the 3rd visit Chiai (with her warm hospitality and smile) recommended adding brussels sprouts + bamboo for my (again) #1 bowl.  All I can say is *hot damn!* this CHG's recommendations are spot-on!!  She's not all aesthetics ya know - - she's sharp, efficient, to-the-point, and very accommodating.  The perfect Ramen Tatsu-Ya match-maker to help maximize your experience, what more could you ask for?   \\n\\nEverything was phenomenal, and to top it all off H-Girl from my initial visit stopped over while I was wallowing in my ramen w/ a big smile to say hello- - how nice and sweet!  Shel even triple-checked on me to make sure it was all good, so very courteous, attentive, and professional!  \\n\\nI've done enough research in my time to know that \\"waiting\\" is the #1 customer dissatisfier (~77%).

Things I love about this place within the first few minutes: complimentary valet parking (thank goodness!), the southern charm and cultural d√©cor, and the friendly staff. Upon walking in at 8:20 for our 8:30 reservation, the hostess informed us our table is \\"finishing up\\" and asked us to wait. Most of our group were able to snag some comfortable seats around the makeshift fireplace. Everyone commented on the comfortable, warm, and welcoming atmosphere. \\n\\nDuring our wait, a lady came by and asked if we would like to order drinks during our wait. We were updated on the status of our table a few times at the beginning, and then, as our 20 minute wait turned into 30 and finally into 40 minutes, we were updated more frequently. We were finally seated at 9:10, with 50 minutes of wait time and 40 minutes after our reservation. Immediately after being seated, however, a gentleman stopped by our table, the same gentleman who had been updating us on the status of our wait, and introduced himself as the general manager of the restaurant and offered us a complimentary bottle of wine for our inconvenience. I truly have to marvel at this impressive gesture. It certainly set our experience back to a happy place.\\n\\nWe were greeted immediately by our server and our service throughout the evening was on-point. Our server knew anything and everything there is to know about the menu, even answering complex questions about peculiar ingredients in some of the dishes. We were very impressed. \\n\\nFor our meal, we decided on the family dinner special, where each guest receives a shared appetizer course, shared salad course, an entr√©e of your choosing, cornbread, shared sides of nearly all the ones on their menu, an individual dessert, along with tea and coffee. The base price for this is $42, with a minimal upcharge for 3 entr√©e items. I enjoyed the following:\\n\\n-Toasted deviled ham tea sandwiches\\n-Local kale salad with apples, artisan cheese, and boiled dressing\\n-Wood Grilled GA raised ribeye (upcharge $5)\\n-Sides:\\n**Lemon glazed sweet potatoes\\n**Revival mac and cheese\\n**Roasted turnips with apples\\n**Hickory smoked local greens (collard greens)\\n**My granny's pole beans\\n-Chocolate cake and Lemon icebox pie\\n\\nMy favorites were the deviled ham tea sandwiches, grilled ribeye (definitely worth the $5 upcharge), and the mac and cheese. The deviled ham tea sandwiches were probably the most impressive--these was spectacularly flavorful, cut with precision, and grilled perfectly. I also really loved the mac and cheese--this was by far my favorite side item. I've never had mac and cheese cooked with ditalini pasta and it made for a very interesting variant! I also loved how creamy and cheesy this was without being overwhelmingly heavy or greasy. The ribeye was large, beautiful, and cooked to a perfect medium. Be prepared to stuff yourself silly with 10-12 ounces of meat if you go this route, and it is definitely worth it! The one qualm I have about the ribeye is that I was expecting it to be deliciously seasoned but it seemed very plain. \\n\\nOverall, we had a very good meal, however, very few things had the wow factor. I do recommend coming here to enjoy the friendly staff and the great atmosphere. I suspect most patrons come here just for that, as there are plenty of places for outstanding southern cuisine in Atlanta if that's what you're seeking. Definitely come here with an easy going attitude and good company; our 4.5-course meal lasted 2.5 hours."},{"name":"Stefano's Grill","address":"7512 Dr Philips Blvd, Ste 80","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great local place with fantastic food, the flatbreads and table side Caesar salads are fantastic and the pasta, amazing!

I was so looking forward to trying this place, and have heard so many good things about it. I used to live in San Francisco and loved the plethora of great Japanese restaurants. Since moving back to Austin, and especially lately, I've been craving authentic, delicious ramen. Unfortunately, I don't think Ramen Tatsu-ya is it.\\n\\nFirst off, as other reviewers have noted, the ramen noodles they use here are these thin, kind of hard, rather flavorless ones, not the more typical ones that are thicker and springier and seem to hold a lot of flavor. The noodles at Ramen Tatsu-ya were a big detractor for me.\\n\\nMy husband is vegetarian, and there really wasn't anything he could order. They said their veggie ramen bowl is coming soon, but...when? I ordered the Tonkatsu Original (#1) bowl, and I'm pretty sure some ingredient was left out accidentally, because the broth tasted like milky nothingness. It wasn't even salty at all; just...nada. So weird. We happened to have friends who'd come to the restaurant at the same time and ordered the same thing; I tried their broth, and while it still didn't blow me away, it definitely had more flavor than mine. I asked for soy sauce so I could punch mine up a little, and the waiter fella brought out about a tablespoon's worth for me. Gee, thanks. It helped a little. I had also ordered gyoza, which were underwhelming at best, so I tossed their sauce into my soup too, after which it tasted a little better. The piece of cha-shu pork in my soup was good. The glass of tap water I ordered was way too small. That's a weird-ish complaint, I know, but I like a big glass of water, especially if there aren't any waitstaff coming around to refill your glass (which there weren't).\\n\\nOn the plus side, the people working there were really friendly, and the place itself is cute. We liked the rough wooden lamps and other elements of the decor. My husband enjoyed his Pearl Snap beer, and I liked the way the drinks and other extras were laid out for choosing among them.

My jaw has dropped so far that I am incapable of making any further verbal judgements.\\n\\nThen I had the Akinto burger, which made me feel a pleasure I've never felt before. Granted, I was quite tipsy, which tends to exaggerate how much I like food, but this was unreal. I can't get over how interesting it was: it used Hunan pickles and a kind of bird chili sauce to essentially deliver a burger with a deep and rich cucumber infusion, topped with needle-thin strings of fried onion. I've never had anything quite like it, and it sure as hell blew boring old beef-bacon-and-cheese burgers right out of the water. This was a magnificient experience.\\n\\nMy compliments go to Chef Patrick Enage, who is behind the Akinto menu of summer 2015, which was characterized by a kind of south east-asian fusion. It's brilliant.\\n\\nOh, and their old fashioned is excellent. Really very good. Though, for what it's worth, I've had another drinks there that wasn't so great.\\n\\nDid I mention that the atmosphere is absolutely delightful? It feels great to be there.

Big portions, serious quality service, and even more serious food!\\n\\nWhen my boyfriend and I were finally all moved into our apartment this summer, we had one kitchen drawer left empty- we dubbed it \\"The Take-Out/Delivery Menu Drawer\\". Bandini's menu was the first of now three menus to occupy the space, and it's been the only one we've used.\\n\\nWe've ordered delivery from there a few times now (tonight being the most recent), and each time, I have experienced the most genuine and efficient customer service- on the phone AND at time of delivery.\\n\\nTonight after a trip to the gym, I ordered the caesar salad with shrimp. You can expect quick delivery (the food is still piping hot!), and not 20 minutes after we placed the order, their ADORABLEY SHYdelivery guy showed up. We were like kids on Christmas morning... as per usual when it comes to food :) \\n\\nWhen I opened my salad, I turned to my boo and asked, \\"Hey, Babe... you made sure to tell them to add shrimp, right?\\" \\n\\n\\"Yeah, of course... I know you love your damn shrimp.\\" he replied.\\n\\n\\"There aren't any shrimp in here... should I call and ask them to bring back some shrimp? I don't wanna be a B****.\\" I pondered for a minute, and decided to call. When the sweet and professional girl on the phone answered, I told her my salad came sans shrimp and she sounded almost aghast at the mistake. \\"OH NO!! I'M SOOO SORRY!!\\" she said, but I was like \\"No, no, no it's okay, but is it possible to maybe get a little side of shrimp delivered? I'll pay a delivery fee!\\" and she so kindly obliged without hesitation. \\n\\nBetween ending the phone call and Round 2 of delivery, I spent the minutes deliberating whether I was being too demanding or not... they're such sweet, efficient, and chill people and I would hate to sound like one of \\"THOSE\\" customers. The doorbell rang, and I was given my brown bag of goodies. In return I handed the kind man $5, at least for his trouble. He quickly turned it down with a smile, and shivering from the cold without a jacket. I insisted, and then he insisted, and then I insisted again... he did not want my money! \\n\\nI opened the bag, expecting a little container of shrimp. NO- they comped me A WHOLE LARGE SIZE shrimp caesar salad, and now I have 2 salads to last me for a couple days (portions are generous, and a steal considering the prices).\\n\\nTHANK YOU BANDINI, FOR MAKING TAKE-OUT NIGHTS GIVE ME THE WARM-AND-FUZZIES."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love this place!!The ribs. ..chicken...Mac n cheese...and.collard greens...are tasty.I call in my order before heading home to Alabama.The only complaint I have is the long wait in line, but once you get your food it's well worth it."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"With the high rating and thousands of reviews, I was excited to try Screen Door.

The restaurants on Newbury Street are all far below average because they obviously don't need good food to draw in a crowd. The beautiful outdoor seating on this charming street filled with visitors and locals is simply something you must experience. You get to watch all different sorts of people walking down the street in their trendy outfits with their stylish dogs. Matching outfits are my favorite! I personally have always loved the seating at Sonsie because of the European feel with the chairs facing the street. The ambiance feels French but believe it or not the chef, Bill Poirier, is a native Rhode Islander.\\n\\nSince it was a gorgeous day outside, I felt the need to stroll Newbury street and give in to paying copious amounts of money for low quality food. I am not a fan of the majority of the restaurants because the food is subpar since business is bustling no matter how crappy the food is. I remembered dining at Sonsie for brunch a few years ago and I thought it was decent. I couldn't really remember much from the experience. I figured if it was that bad then I would have remembered, right? Think again, Kiki P, think again!\\n\\nI am not sure what has changed, but the quality of food at Sonsie has gone down over the past several years. For brunch, I ordered the eggs benedict and specifically asked for my eggs soft poached and runny. The server gave me a baffled look and her snarky reply to me was \\"poached means runny so of course the eggs will be runny.\\" I simply smiled and nodded. I always say soft poached because so many chefs OVERPOACH eggs. It is single handedly the most common mistake that a chef can make. That is why chefs hate it when you order poached eggs. Of course, when my eggs did finally come out, they were hard...basically like eating a hard-boiled egg. I understand that people make mistakes, but it is hard for me to accept this because if you claim to be a brunch spot then you should at least know how to prepare eggs, ANY WAY. I cook brunch at home all the time and the reason I go out to eat is because I can never a good poached egg. I mentioned the overpoached eggs to the server and she had the chef cook up a couple of additional eggs. Funny story, the new eggs were overpoached as well...HA! Need I say more?\\n\\nYes I must! I also tried the hot shaved beef sandwich on onion roll with cheddar, onion and marmalade. This sandwich was honestly even worse than my overpoached eggs. The beef was low quality and lacked flavor. In fact, it had a funny after taste. Just thinking about it again is making me sick to my tummy. \\n\\nOn a separate note, the service really unacceptable. My friend wanted a small snack since she wasn't all that hungry so she tried to order the house made granola. It is served with blueberries and she simply asked if she could have it with strawberries instead. Strawberries were on the menu as a separate item served with the crepes so they were obviously an option. The server claimed she could not accommodate this request and so my friend was forced to order the quiche instead. Conveniently so, the quiche was double the price as the granola \\n\\nOverall, I was sincerely disappointed in my experience at Sonsie and do not plan to return. I understand that restaurants on Newbury Street have subpar food, and honestly, sometimes I can deal with it even though I am an Ultra-Foodie. I value ambiance in certain situations so I can take one for the team. BUT when the service is this unaccommodating, the experience ends up being miserable. What if my friend had an allergy to blueberries? The server did not even ask if she was allergic!

It was Friday Nov 8th @ 6p and all other  restaurants in newton center were very busy! except this one.  This should have been the first sign.  There was only one other person at the bar while I was waiting for my friend to show.  The first three things we tried order, calamari dish, a shrimp dish,  & another I can't recall, were \\"out of stock\\".  Really???? It's a Friday and no fish?  The bartender told us that the owners parent died and the fish delivery never showed. She ended up recommending the mussels.  20 minutes later, we got a small bowl of about 10 cold and under cooked mussels.  Our main meals were mediocre and our dessert was crumbled up store bought pumpkin pie.  The crust had fallen off the pumpkin piece when it was served to us.

I only tried a couple things from here, so I'll probably come back to try some of the other things they offer.\\n\\nI tried their everything bagels and a cinnamon roll. The bagel was good, and so was the cream cheese, but I think I was expecting more of a New York style bagel, which their bagels definitely are not. But it was still pretty good.\\n\\nThe cinnamon roll was also not what I was expecting, they don't make theirs with a bread type dough like most places do, it was more of a puff pastry type dough. I thought that was interesting, and really delicious, but because of the nature of that dough it wasn't cooked in the middle and I had to eat around the edges which was kind of a turn-off. But the cream cheese frosting on top was amazing!\\n\\nThe bakery itself is a pretty decent size with seating indoors and outdoors. A nice place for a quick breakfast or lunch.

I think of BBQ as a communal experience, so being 14 centimeters away from the person beside me was okay for this meal.  We arrived at 7pm, about an hour before band played.  A sign on the wall says there is live music every night, and the pictures (if they are to be believed) suggest that some rather famous blues acts have stopped by.  Pictures and music memorabilia cover the walls and create a very \\"classic\\" atmosphere.  The service was friendly and quick, from the time we placed our order to the time our plates were whisked away.\\n\\nTalking to people from North Carolina and Texas gives one the impression that Atlanta doesn't know how to do BBQ, but I think Fat Matt's delivers a pretty good effort.  The chopped pork sandwich is served on the fluffiest white bread bun I've ever tasted, and the meat is unbelievably tender.  This is no grilled-pork-with-sauce-is-barbeque barbeque.  The kitchen obviously takes the time to do it right, slow cooking the meat until it just falls apart.  They are generous with the sauce, which has a hint of smoke and a healthy amount of peppery spice.  If you are used to the thick, sweet stuff of Kansas City, then prepare for an adjustment.  Personally, I would have liked a bit more smoke flavor to the food, so I would say that Fat Matt's deserves a half star less than Rolling Bones.  Unfortunately, Yelp doesn't let me give half stars, and the food and ambiance are so good that it just wouldn't feel right giving the place three.  Besides, my wife preferred Fat Matt's style to Rolling Bones, so I think it has more to do with my taste than with the food quality.\\n\\nI you go for the meat, hang out long enough to make room for the pie.  I have a weakness for good pie and very little tolerance for bad pie.  Bad pie is like bad theater: you pay a whole lot of money (or calories) for an experience that is supposed to be great, not just good, so when pie (or theater) falls flat it really stinks.  I'm happy to report that Fat Matt's serves great pie.  I normally don't like pecan pie because the filling is over sweetened so much that one cannot taste either the crust or the pecans.  Here, the filling was the perfect complement to the amazingly good crust, and the pecans tasted like they just came from the farm.  Definitely worth the calories!"},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This is why I cannot move to the South. \\n\\nAfter an evening of buttered biscuits, fried green tomatoes, mahi mahi with goat cheese grits, pecan pie AND banana pudding, (shared of course), it's amazing I walked out of there on my own two feet.

Waiting 4+ hours for some brisket sounds disappointing, leaving many to believe that it is not worth the wait. But if bring some friends to  camp out early in the morning and play games for a few hours, you get spend some quality time with your friends and reward yourself at the end with mind-blowing BBQ & bourbon banana pie.\\n\\nSeriously, after Franklin, I have not been able to fully enjoy brisket at any other Texas BBQ joint. The brisket here is so tender and perfectly seasoned. And their beef rib just falls off the bone. Everything was so beautiful that I could cry. After stuffing myself, I did not think I had room for dessert until I had a bite of the bourbon banana pie. Definitely get this even if you are full. At the end, I was so full, but happy, and all was right with the world.\\n\\nNotes if you are considering camping out: they have a pile of lawn chairs available to those waiting (although they are first come first serve).

Also located literally next to 3 other sushi places, wondering what this could bring to the neighborhood of sushi!\\n\\nA small place with about 15 seats, we were luckily seated quickly. Service was friendly and looking at the menu, pricing is similar to sushi town, bonus!\\n\\nWe ordered their lunch box, which was decently sized. The eel was quite delicious and the pieces of sashimi were big. The rice however, was not cooked through and too strongly seasoned with vinegar that it was overpowering.\\n\\nThe aburi oshi was very thin with barely any fish, it was tasty, but again, the rice was undercooked.\\n\\nThe White Dragon roll was saucy but I liked the combination of fish with the sauces and sear.\\n\\nThe highlight was their deluxe chirashi don. Packed full of higher end sashimi, it was a steal! Their saba was also quite unique in that they pair it with an egg base, which made the usual sour taste to saba less intense. However, the Hamachi tasted off, perhaps not a very fresh or good cut. This was one of the dishes where the undercooked rice was more prominent and noticeably worse.\\n\\nThe aburi salmon belly nigiri was deliciously torched, melty in our mouths!\\n\\nI forgot to take a picture of takoyaki, but this was a very disappointing dish. It tasted like one of the pre-made ones from T&T and only reheated in the microwave. Only one of us found a piece of octopus inside, the rest only had dough and more dough.\\n\\nOverall the food was decent, however lower quality. For the price though, I would understand. Servers were attentive but a bit opinionated. If only our waitress didn't make a comment of how we didn't order enough food for 4 people (we had just finished packing leftovers), I would go back.

Although there's nothing wrong with a good old fashioned corn dog, the novelty will wear off. It's not something one would go to regularly. The sandwiches seem like a better option for routine visitors. The corn dog IS good but it's heavily dipped in cornbread (fried) batter. Heavy! The price for a milkshake was a bit high I thought. I had a choco pb&j with banana. A 16 ounce glass was about $6. \\n\\nOverall I would recommend it once. We might go back for a sandwich but not anytime soon.

What I must not have remembered is how hungry I was that day, because today I was disappointed in the food; but I'll get to that in a moment.\\n\\nIt was about 1215 on a Wednesday when I entered Oishi Sushi and there were only 2 tables with people and no one was at the sushi bar, so I sat there. The waitress was friendly throughout my lunch and refilled my soda  1/2 way when she noticed I was low. I requested only a  1/2 fill (I don't like to waste) and she delivered.\\n\\nThe owner(?)/manager seems to do his office paperwork behind the sushi bar at a small desk and never acknowledged anyone other than a regular that came in during my stay. Not a huge deal to me, but I can't say I want to look at someone's back doing office work while I eat.\\n\\nI ordered the Bento 3 which is the same as what I ordered the first time I was here and you can see a picture of my lunch, because I uploaded one. However, I must have been starved for food the day my co-worker brought me here, because as I already mentioned Oishi Sushi fell far short today.\\n\\nAt lunch the Bento 3 at Oishi Sushi is salmon steak, 4 pieces of sushi (egg, shrimp, salmon and tuna?), salad, miso soup, white rice & 5 pieces of tempura for about 13 dollars; it might have been closer to 14.\\n\\nThe miso soup was the first thing to arrive after my sinful soda. Don't get the wrong idea about the soda, but I shouldn't be drinking it...Anyway, the miso soup was flavorless and besides the 3 small parts  of a green leafy substance found within it had two small bits of tofu. How small? I could have put them both on a penny...together.\\n\\nMy box arrived in good time, which might have been part of its downfall as the sushi was on a small serving tray inside the box which could have only been sitting in a refrigerator as nobody at the sushi bar made it, remember I was sitting right there. So, freshly made it was not.\\n\\nThe white rice, well that would be hard to mess up even for me.\\n\\nMaybe I am becoming a salad snob, you tell me. But when I am served a salad these days made of ice berg lettuce, I'm not happy and this is what I found in the middle of my box. I can't tell you any more about the salad as I didn't eat any.\\n\\nThe 4 slices of sashimi tuna were absolutely tasteless. Absolutely. Tasteless. I would have left them, if I couldn't have dunked them in soy sauce, added a bit of wasbi and I wanted the protein.\\n\\nWhen compared to the rest of the meal, the salmon steak wasn't bad. Served with a sweet sauce over it and with the skin still on I ate it all.\\n\\nI escaped from Oishi Sushi for just over $20 ($4 tip included, not the waitress' fault the food was  meh) and by the time I headed out the place was  1/2 full. With sooooo many other places to eat in the area, I'm surprised they are still open if this is the extent of their lunch rush and what I received was the norm.\\n\\nIf you are in the area I wouldn't recommend Oishi Sushi or Sushi Hanna, located across the street and in the next parking lot (yes, I Yelped them already), but there really are a number of other places within walking distance including the food court at the mall. Granted, most of the places around here are chain, but you'll escape for less money and the quality will probably be better."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We obviously came back the next day at 6:40 AM to ensure that we got this before we left. There was a good amount of people ahead of us but we were still part of the first batch to be served. Was it worth waiting 4.5 hours in 30 degree weather? I would probably say yes. It was the best, most flavorful and tender brisket of my life. We ordered way too much out of excitement, and knowing we probably wouldn't do that wait ever again - 2 lbs of brisket (half lean, half fatty), 1/2 lb of pork ribs, 1/4 of pulled pork, and two sausage links. The brisket was AMAZING, ribs were very good, could have gone without the pulled pork and sausage links though. Also, definitely get the banana bourbon pie, it was a great cap to the meal. You can really taste the subtle bourbon, and it's very creamy with pieces of banana. \\n\\nAlso, Aaron Franklin would chill in front and go around talking to everyone to make sure everything was okay. Super nice guy and was very willing to take selfies/pictures with those who requested it. Would definitely go again if I didn't have to wait so long.

I have two parts of a review I would like to write. One part is about the food and service. The second part is about the scene and the decor. I'll start with that since it's not so relevant as to whether or not you should go here, but I just have to say it.\\nThe scene is... eh... It's a little yuppy for me. However what could I have expected on a Saturday night on Newbury street? I have to take some responsibility for that one. Also, the decor is just bizarre. It's subtle because when you walk in, it's dark and has a lot of the rich rosy tones that create nice ambience in a restaurant. But when you start to look closer at the art and the fixtures, they are just bizarre and kind of tacky. \\nAlright but that's not really the point because FOOD is at the heart of the matter. And the food is delicious. Seriously delicious. I don't know if I can even go through all the things we ate but we got a lot of appetizers to split for the table which were all flavorful and well made. Only complaint is the small-ish portions, however if we weren't sharing them between a table of 14 we would probably have felt differently. \\nAs my entree I got grilled swordfish with ricotta gnocchi, hen of the woods (which is a mushroom... I had to ask the server), roast cauliflower and lemon butter. Awesome. Best gnocchi I have ever had. Just perfect little ricotta pillows. And the fish was cooked perfectly. My mouth is actually watering a little as I write this. \\nSo I would say if you're feeling fancy (or if you just make a lot more money than I do) and you want a good meal, definitely head over to Newbury and check out Sonsie.

We paid extra for VIP tickets through groupon, which include appetizers, 2 drinks, front row seats, and the option of paying extra for an upgraded dinner.  We arrived 45 minutes early for the show to have drinks and take advantage of the included appetizers. The appetizers were a cold mozzarella stick, some cheeses, and some nasty fish salad. The hot appetizers were already gone and we were told they weren't putting any more out for those of us who didn't get any. So we went to the bar to order an extremely overpriced drink that had no liquor in it AT ALL... (glorified sugar water). Pretty soon we were taken to our seats which were no better than anyone else's. The food was worse than hospital food. I could not eat anything besides my salad. My husband and I were both confused as to what the show was even about since the sound was so bad and there were 10 other things going on as the show was starting. Very unorganized and FAR from family friendly. Everything aside, we forced ourselves to sit through the show for our son. About 20 minutes before the end of the show the waitress spilled an entire pitcher of beer in my lap. I missed the last 20 minutes of the show trying to get my clothes rung  out for the 2 hour drive home. When the show was over we asked to speak with a manager who happened to be an absolute JOKE. His name is Carlos Ortiz and he would not even apologize for the poor experience we had. He told me the only thing he could do is have my pants dry cleaned. AT 9:30 at night.... we had a 2 hour drive ahead of us. Although it would have been interesting to see how he planned to accomplish this I didn't have time to entertain his bogus offer. I told him I would just like my money back since I didn't eat, didn't get to see the entire show, and now I had to ride home with pants that are dripping wet and smell like beer. He snapped at me and told me there were no refunds under any circumstances. Are you kidding me? I didn't receive any part of the service I paid for. I told him that was unacceptable and tried to explain why I was dissatisfied . He told me I needed to be quiet around the other guests or I would be escorted outside. The way this man spoke to me, the words he chose to use and the way he treated my family and I was completely unacceptable. I have never paid so much money to be treated so badly in my life. This manager needs a job cleaning bathrooms or something where he doesn't have to interact with people. For the record, have been to a few different dinner shows and have loved all of them. We are not the kind of people who complain about much but this experience was really that bad.  Save your money people. There are plenty of things to do in Orlando.

I'd say the breakfast platter wasn't anything special and definitely overpriced. But their portions are pretty big and will not fail to fill you up.

Slaw is cold, crunchy, sweet and tangy, providing a nice foil to the richness of the meats. And the meats ....oh my gosh. The brisket is so succulent and tender, presents with a nice smoke ring, and a peppery bark. Intensely satisfying flavor, real smoky, perfectly seasoned. Wings have great texture, nice and smokey, tossed in the spicy house sauce. Ribs meat is not falling off the bone but it pulls off easily which I think is perfect, not overly salted, nice spicy paprika rub. There is a basket of condiments and the house bbq sauce there on the table, but I ate my food as it came to me so as not to mask the the flavors that the pit magician is turning out.

So the look is definitely more upscale than its counterpart.  Since it wasn't that busy we got a lot of attention from our server.  He was really nice, informative, and also cute.  More importantly he wanted our feedback on the food, so he can pass the suggestions and comments back to the chef and if necessary improve on the dishes.\\n\\nThere aren't that many items on the menu.  The sake list in a way is more extensive than the menu.  The server said they reduced the amount of items on the menu, in hopes to focus on making a selective good dishes.  In a way, this approach worked.  We enjoyed the following dishes:\\n\\n1)Tempura style  Fanny Bay oyster- OMG, it was soooo good!!  The batter was light and non-greasy.  The three oysters were quite big.  I loved  the vinigrette and pickled shallots that came with it because it helped reduced the heaviness of the oysters.  I could eat another order of it by myself.\\n\\n2)Lobster Tempura Roll- Those rolls were huge.  I like the idea of combining the deep frying aspect of tempura with sushi roll styel.  Once again, it was light and non-greasy.  There lots of lobster in each roll yet it didn't overshadow the mangos nor the asparagus.  It's a good combo!!\\n\\n3)Octopus Carpaccio-It was marinated with green tea but I couldn't really taste it.  Nevertheless, it tasted really fresh and the octopus wasn't chewy.  Love the liveliness of the citrus vinigrette.\\n\\n4)Ahi Tuna Sashimi-Very fresh!! Presentation lovely.  Too bad there weren't enough shredded daikon at the bottom.\\n\\nThe presentation of each dish was very appealing.  I loved eating those edible flowers.

And they had the one thing that Michi didn't: options!\\n\\nSo I went with a friend and stood in the ridiculously long line in the heat of Austin's September.  I stepped inside, smelled the goodness, and proceeded to sweat my ass off as I approached the counter.  Whatever...delicious soup in the summer comes at a cost.\\n\\nI ordered the Me-So-Hot and Curry Bowl, and my friend ordered the Tonkatsu.  We started with Spicy Edamame and Gyoza.\\n\\nI'll start with the lowest of the lows:\\n-Noodles: This makes any Asian soup experience.  The noodles weren't the chewy, eggy strands of scrumptiousness that I was expecting.  Instead they were thin, fragile, and lacking in flavor.  However, the Dipping Ramen seemed to have the chewy, delicious noodles I so yearned for.  So, I'll have to give that a try sometime.\\n-Miso broth:  It was spicy and flavorful, but after a third of the bowl it became too heavy and creamy.  I don't know that this is a flaw in their recipe.  I've never really ordered miso broth before.  So yeah...probably won't order it again.\\n-Tonkatsu broth:  It looked right, but it relied too heavily on sesame oil and garlic for flavor.  It wasn't as balanced as I had hoped it would be.  True Tonkatsu broth isn't gimmicky.\\n\\nThe good news:\\n-Curry Bowl:  Oh. My. God.  I could eat this every day and be happy forever.  Sooo good!  It resembles the curry rice at Ajishin, which is addicting.  I don't know how they can make something so flavorful and satisfying without using meat.  Amazing!\\n-Gyoza:  Very good.  Definitely handmade, which is always impressive.  They were light, and they left me wanting more.  The dipping sauce was so good that I really wish I'd had more dumplings just so I could shamelessly eat more of that soy/vinegar/garlic/ginger/crack goodness.\\n-Service:  They have a good system here.  The line is ridiculous, but the system they have moves people through as quickly as possible without rushing customers.  I think also because the place is so hot, a lot of people don't want to sit and linger after they've finished their meal.  It's all part of their little plan.\\n-Selection:  It's always good to offer your customers options.  They've got at least 4 Ramen options (with a veggie option coming soon), two rice bowls, and a handful of yummy appetizers.  Not to mention you can add all sorts of crazy crap to your ramen, if you so choose.\\n\\nThings to try in the future (yes, I'll be back):\\n-Dipping Ramen:  They basically bring you a bowl of broth and a basket of chewy noodles, and the idea is to grab some noodles, dip them in the broth, and shove them into your mouth.  I'm not sure what type of broth this entails, but the noodles, as I mentioned before, seem to be the more classic Ramen-style.\\n-Chashu Bowl:  Roasted pork and rice.  What more do you need in life?  It sounds amazing.  I really must try it!\\n-Dessert?  I don't know...may just go to Coco's for a bubble tea. :)\\n\\nOverall, this place was kind of a let-down.  But I'll definitely go back to try more.  At this point, with Austin's meager Ramen scene, I'll take what I can get!"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I have no complaints about this place.

Thankfully, they seriously improved it.\\n\\nWhile I miss the punches from Pleasant Storage Room (the old rum bar that was here), they stripped the menu down for the better. They have lots of classic 50s cocktail staples like Zombies, Painkillers, Mai Tais, and others. Rum drinks generally take a lot of time to prepare, but the drafts cocktails seem to help: our drinks were ready in a flash (a big step up from PSR).\\n\\nI had the crab fritters, which we not bad (the lemon dressing was incredible) and I really want to go back for the Ropa Vieja with coconut rice and the Hemingway Burger (he was a jerk, but he made a damn tasty burger). It seems the Peche team also stripped down the food menu to feature more cuban and upper caribbean favorites (slow cooked, deeper flavors) than the bright, more central caribbean fish dishes that Pleasant Storage Room had.\\n\\nThe ceviche bar is still there, which I want to try - but the drinks are superb. I had the Dawn of the Apes (dark rum, banane du bresil, lime, etc.) and a very smooth Corn n' Oil (blackstrap and Falernum) and my girlfriend had the Blue Hawaiian, Draft Zombie and the Ankle Roller.

The line doesn't take long, and once you order and sit down, I've never had to wait more than 7-10 minutes for my food.\\n\\nThe ONLY reason I gave four instead of five stars is that I've felt like they want to rush me out as soon as I'm done eating so they can use that space for someone else. I'm sure this is why the line doesn't take long, but it is also quite frustrating. Even before I've finished eating, I get asked \\"Do you need a box?\\" - um, no I'm still eating. I understand the reasons for this, however it doesn't make for an enjoyable dining experience. I would NOT recommend this for a date, especially if you end up talking for a while as they will want to kick you out as quickly as possible.

CANTINA\\n\\nIn a city rich with so-called Mexican restaurants, one stands out as a true diamond in the rough.  No Mas! Cantina and Hacienda resides in the former Aristocrat Ice Cream Company in the up and coming, diverse Castleberry Hills district.  Owners, Walt Bilinski and Steve MacNeil, envisioned bringing the best of Mexico to ATL through art, food, and fun. This oasis opened in August 2006 and provides a quick escape to South of the border without having to go through airport security.\\n\\nThe Hacienda is breathtaking with its unique offerings from over 300 talented Mexican artisans.  The ADios Caf√©/ Bakery dazzles ones senses with its delectable goodies.  Then of course there is the Cantina with its Mexican-inspired foods prepared by self-learned executive chef, Se√±orita Melody Voirin. \\n \\nThere is no mass production here; even the chips and salsa are made fresh throughout the day.  The smoky chipotle-flavored salsa is the perfect partner with the robust taste of the smooth Dulce Margarita-with Partida Blanco Tequila, fresh limejuice, and Agave nectar.  Each handmade glass is adorned with a bracelet, a good way to keep count. It was a three-bracelet night ...\\n\\nTo get things going, the warm flavors of the pureed Butternut Squash soup in a house-made chicken stock are simply divine.  As the last slurp disappeared, Cajy, our knowledgable server, delivered the awesome Calamari Frito con Jalape√±os.  These flash fried treats match perfectly with the chipotle ranch and avocado cream sauces.  Dip the jalape√±o in the mouth-cooling avocado cream and the calamari in the tangy chipotle ranch and let your taste buds go on a roller coater ride.\\n\\nThe multi-faceted chicken Quesadilla Roja is not like any other in the city.  Melody showcases her skills through this dish. The chicken, goat cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes dance with tangy tropical flavors from the mango, pineapple, cilantro, onion, and jalape√±o salsa. This is way too good... When I thought the quesadilla was the best ever, out came the otherworldly Tilapia Fish Taco.  The Tilapia is lightly coated in a seasoned masa breading, flash fried in order to retain all its deliciousness, then topped with a jicama coleslaw and creamy chipotle sauce and wrapped in a freshly made tortilla- unbelievable.  \\n\\nAs for the house specialties, the Camarones Alambres, perfectly grilled jumbo shrimp on a sugar cane skewer resting on top a masa cake with sweet fried plantains touched with an exotic tamarind sauce is a treat not to be missed.  One of Melody's favorites, and mine as well, is the Pollo Relleno, after this you will never have a Chili Relleno again.  The 24-hour marinated, grilled chicken breast is stuffed with rajas poblano pepper, Chihuahua cheese, and drizzled with salsa verde, served with cilantro-mashed potatoes is melt in your mouth good.  To satisfy that carnivore craving, the savory Bistek Caf√© Tamarindo- a skirt steak marinated with a coffee rub, spices, and tamarind with roasted acorn squash puree and seasonal vegetables, each bite seemed to be better than the last.\\n\\nIt is always hard to save room for dessert, but at No Mas! Cantina you are on vacation. The delicate flavors of the Avocado Lime Cheese Cake and the seasonal Pumpkin Flan are heavenly. However, it's the Cuatro Leches that is simply decadent- a moist white layer cake made with four types of milk, topped with a Kahula frosting.  Enjoy these yummy gems with either the Gingerbread Chai or Mayan Mocha.\\n\\nWhen you get that \\"got to get away\\" feeling and you just can't, No Mas! Cantina and Hacienda is waiting to give you that escape to Mexico at least for a while. The next day you'll realize that you can't wait until that feeling comes back again.\\n\\nLGBTG FRIENDLY ***** (Lots of Friendly Smiles)   \\nFOOD *****          (Twist on Regional Recipes)   \\nPRICE *****           (Vacation on a Budget)       \\nAMBIENCE *****  (Patio/ Mexican Art Everywhere)   \\nDRINKS *****       (Great Margaritas/ $5 You Get the Glass)  http://www.nomascantina.com/"},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"2751 Wilshire Drive","city":"Orlando","stars":"1.5","text":"Ok, I know I know this is just a chain-fast food joint  but let me tell you they have made some very recognizable improvements.

She had worked for Applebee's for several years in Maryland and she wanted to visit an Applebee's in Atlanta.  What an embarrassing experience!  The waiter, Mr. AVERY, was rude, disrespectful and unprofessional.  He acted as if he did not want another customer that night and especially customers that had questions about the menu.  Gee, I had not been there in years and was not familiar with the current menu.  Since he was so difficult, I played it safe and ordered the wings.  He returned to the table and said that they were out of wings.  Really, I have never heard of Applebee's being out of wings and the place was dead.  So of course, I had questions about the other items on the menu that might be tasty.  My friend was attempting to substitute the wing depletion with shrimp.  She asked him how the shrimp would be prepared and if she could have them lightly fried.  He made an ignorant comment about not being a \\"taste test\\" restaurant.  Then he told us that he would get us another waiter as he gave us the \\"Hand\\".  We requested to speak to the manager who finally came to our table.  We explained his demeanor and what had happened.  She apologized but did not seem to really care explaining how the restaurant was having such a bad day.  I strongly believe that it is not the restaurant; it's the people who work in the restaurant that determines success.

The prices were certainly reasonable, but on the other hand I would rather have paid five dollars more for better food.

I've been in twice now and there was a third attempt which failed due to my inability to enter. \\n\\nThat brings me to my first point, the space is much too small. I understand that this location must be great for business but if cash carrying potential customers can't even get through the door then the location should probably be reconsidered. I have noticed that things calm down around 11ish, same goes for 16 Bit next door. If crowds aren't your thing, that would be the time to shoot for. \\n\\nThe food is decent. Out of the 4 hot dogs I've tried I only disliked 1, The Nikola. I imagined hot dog + tzatziki sauce to be a good combination. No. It isn't. \\nAnd while decent food is all well and good, I feel that if more people in the Columbus area were familiar with a place called Hillbilly Hot Dogs, located in Lesage WV, Dirty Frank's wouldn't be nearly as popular. Hillbilly completely blows Frank's away in every way. The food, atmosphere, space and service are much better.

Some Thai food restaurants start off with a bang serving flavorful Siamese delights that can enchant my palette only to falter after 18 months and start serving plates of mediocrity. \\n\\nMany times, the work visa for the chef expires and they are sent back to Thailand or the managers get caught up in increasing the profit margins and start to cull out the quality ingredients in lieu of more inexpensive onions and cabbage and serve less chicken or beef. Many dishes ordered at other places are served up with heaping piles of onions and green bell peppers to unsuspecting American customers to cut costs.The Pacific Northwest was flooded with Thai food in the late 90's early 2000's to meet the growing demand for this popular ethnic cuisine amongst urban hipsters and enlightened west coast suburbanites. \\n\\nWhat I am impressed about Dangs is that I have eaten here many times and the quality is very consistent over time and remains high. I have never been disappointed and the food is as good as I can cook for myself and in some cases better than what I make at home.

She asked to exchange it, and our waitress was nice about it, but what she got next (a chicken Cesar salad at $14) was not much of an upgrade.

Wanted to go on a Saturday as it is the only day they serve beef ribs.  Was in town for a meeting for my wife so I made some  a plan while she was busy to get here about 8am, I felt it would be a safe time since they open at 11am. She had a late start that day and wanted me to join her for breakfast so I didn't  get here until 9.  Was amazed how many people were already in line, I mean you read about it but it was truly amazing.  Had a great time meeting all the people around me, it really is part of the experience. They had a function that night so there was a pit master (Sam Jones) cooking a whole hog in a what seemed to be a make shift oven in the parking lot so of course I had to wander over and talk to him.  While we were talking Aaron Franklin came out to see if he needed anything so I got to speak to him too. I have to say, for someone who has done so well he was in no rush and Sam offered to take  a picture of us for me. What a great day and I hadn't even got to eat yet.  As they were coming through the line checking to see what everyone was ordering so they knew how far they could guarantee  they would have each product   I heard them run out of beef ribs about five people before me, I was crushed . And then the guy behind me was the last person to be assured brisket, they gave him a saying last man standing. He was playing hooky to the meetings my wife was at, good call. Once inside and at the counter I was blessed with the beef rib option and took it, along with a little of everything else that amounted to about five pounds. I had planned to take some back to share. Found a table next to two men where no one seemed to want to sit with,these were big guy and had forty,yes forty, pounds between them. I plopped down with them and had a most delightful conversation learning they were from Detroit and this was there sole destination and planned to take it back with them in the ice chests they brought. I shared my pies with them and got a taste of the turkey that had been deleted.

Also, be ready to wait to order because there's always a line.\\n\\nThey used to have a vegan burger on the menu for a while and it was a great option to have when you've been at the park all day and need a quick recharge, however, they've now changed it to a falafel patty. Don't get me wrong I love me some good falafel (it's one of my favorite things to eat) but I just feel like this doesn't work so well when you add burger condiments to it.\\n\\nThe topping bar offers onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, ketchup, mustard and all that jazz which are all great if you were having them on a vegan burger and not a falafel. Another downside is that if you don't add any condiments or fix-ins then the patty is just really dry - so there's your choice.\\n\\nNevertheless, I'm glad that there's a vegan option here because y'all know that when you're at the park when it's super hot and you're irritable from waiting in lines for too long and dealing with tourists you just want to eat!

The slaw on top of it was pretty good but it wasn' mindblowing. As for my husband's dogs: his overall response was that it was wayyy to salty. He expected a great Chicago dog but he said that the hot dog he got from Midway Airport tasted better than the one he had today.

I took all my out-of-town guests here and everyone loved it.  It's basically a must place to visit if you are from out of town.  But unfortunately, my relationship with this place must come to an end.  I ate the usual thing i always eat there...i shared a 1/2 rack rib with potato salad and sweet tea/lemonade with my mom.  As soon as i got home, i started getting severe abdominal cramps.  It felt like someone dug their hand into my stomach and twisting my whole intestines out.  It was so painful that I had to basically lay in bed for 4 days.  I don't think it was food poisoning because i didn't vomit or have the runs.  But something in the food definitely turned my stomach inside out.  Perhaps bacteria.  I experienced severe abdominal pain for about 4 days until i finally went to the doctors.  Doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong and sent me home with some strong antacids.  They didn't do anything to relieve it.  My doctor thinks it's stress related but how could stress turn your stomach inside out and force you to be bed stricken for days?  It wasn't until i spoke to my mother this week that i found out that she had the same problem for the past week.  It took me a full week to recover from whatever i ate at fat matt's and i still have abdominal cramps from time to time.  Now my mom is laying in bed with abdominal cramps and upset stomach.  Only thing that we had eaten together was fat matt's food a week ago.  They seriously need to inspect their food better before serving it to the whole city of atlanta and getting everyone sick.  Although this place was never that attractive-looking as far as cleanliness, the hole-in-the-wall charm always had me coming back again and again.  Afterall, you find the best foods in the city at these types of places that are small and run-down. Now, I'm thinking that i need to call in a health inspector to inspect that place inside and out.

I thought the fact that it was a surprise, a new restaurant, and not overly hipster would be recipe for success. She was quite pleased. However, it was typical in that the restaurant had a few issues being new and all. I really hope these can be worked out soon because Mettle has five star potential. For this particular review, a simple list of the good and the bad is probably best.\\n\\nSuccesses\\n\\nStaff--Friendly and knowledgeable \\nPhysical space--Rustic, masculine, simple\\nCocktails--strong\\nCrab soup--ham was a nice touch\\nBeef tongue tacos--excellent\\nMussels--the best, awesome sauce\\nPlating--cool\\n\\nDisappointments \\n\\nEntrees--I had the burger and she had the fried chicken. They were both fine but we were expecting a different twist or interpretation, however they turned out to be your typical good burger and chicken, certainly nothing to write home about.\\nBar service--We ordered two rounds and each time it took 10 to 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive.\\nOverstaffed--Lot of staff kind of lingering around not working. They weren't intrusive or bothersome but it was weird at times.\\nBill--Non itemized. I HATE IT WHEN PLACES DO THIS. It's bad customer service. I'm gonna go off a little bit here. Everyone thinks they're a good tipper but I'm in the 90th percentile of tippers and I don't mind bragging about it. When a bill is not itemized then I become Mr. 15%.

That worked out for the best as the drinks were filling and they weren't needed.  Food we had was just OK.

The decoration is modern and with all the windows and patio, it give me a great first impression.  We have a 7:00 reservation and when we get there it's already packed.  Since we have 8 people, they reserved a big table for us near the main hall way behind the bar.  Not only the music is loud, we keep having people (including stuffs) bump into our chair. Not a pleasant way to start a meal.\\n\\nFood:\\nBread - Corn breads and biscuits were served and I love the corn bread.\\n\\nAppetizer - She-crab soup has too much cream and not enough crab.  Mussel quality is ok but sauce has a little too much tomato not enough aroma. Goat cheese green tomato has too much goat cheese that overpowered green tomato. Fried Oyster - oyster is not fresh and nothing special.  I have to say we are all disappointed at this point.\\n\\nMain dish - Nothing on our table was impressive, from the shrimp and scallop grits, pork loin, jambalaya, to my shrimp Purloo.  They are ok, seafood quality is just pass the mark, not fresh.  Overall the dishes are either soak in cream or oil, two bites into the dish you are feeling full.   The best dish is the pan-seared trout, it was well seasoned and cooked.  The rice and vege on it was great with the trout.  One thing was surprising to all of us was that for a high-end restaurant like this, I would expect they have a better quality of shrimp and pull out the vein from the shrimp!  We end up tasting all the dirt inside shrimps, pretty disgusting.  \\n\\nService is mediocre, just like the food nothing bad and nothing impressive.  They were busy and our waiter didn't make any effort to make us more comfortable or offer suggestions.  One of the bus boy even took our unfinished dish away without asking.\\n\\nNothing stands out and no one wants to taste dirty shrimps with the price we paid.  I would've give it a 2 star but I gave it 3 star because 1) this is a southern restaurant so heavy sauce and oil was expected, 2) We did order a lot of seafood that night and I didn't  try their fried chicken and crab cake... 3)Some people at our table said the brunch is a much better experience.  \\n\\nIf I am in town again and happen to be near the restaurant with no other plans, I will give it a try again."},{"name":"Flyers Pizza & Subs","address":"962 N Waggoner Rd","city":"Blacklick","stars":"4","text":"Great salad, a little high price but worth the extra money.

Sure, it ranks along side with Home Slice and East Side Pies as truly exceptional pizza, but Mellow Mushroom hits all the sweet spots that make it a personal favorite.\\n\\nI'm a crust lover. I love a crisp crust with lots of bubbles and golden brown edges. For years, I thought I could only love a thin crust because a thin crust is the easiest way to get that crispiness and the most bubbles from having the dough thoroughly worked and stretched. However, Mellow Mushroom has taught me that thin crust may be the easiest way to get those things -- but it isn't the best way. The Mellow Mushroom has thicker, hand-tossed crust that promises big bubbles and crispy-crunchy edges. Words don't do it justice because this crust is sheer perfection, and there's enough of it to feel like you're actually eating something besides a mouthful of sauce and cheese. \\n\\nNow, I love toppings as much as the next person, but a great pizza is a about balance. I used to think it was all about toppings because I thought that the toppings brought the flavor, and they do, but a great pizza is marked by three things working together: freshly made, perfectly seasoned sauce, bubbling hot mozzerella, and the deep sourdoughy-stone baked bouquet of artisan dough crust. You top that off with quality and creative toppings, and you've got yourself a classic pie from The Mellow Mushroom.\\n\\nI've enjoyed everything I ever ordered from The Mellow Mushroom, but like many other yelpers, my favorite is the Red Skin Potato Pie: roasted red potatoes, Applewood smoked bacon, caramelized onions, cheddar and mozzarella. Ask for the sour cream and ranch dressing on the side and request an additional cup of their classic red sauce -- it's great for dipping your crusts!\\n\\nA close second-place goes to their house calzone. It's vegetarian and loaded with fresh veggies and mozzerella cheese.

After every one ordered I went back to the front of the take out window to see if my order was ready.  Not yet... so I waited some more.  It has not been about 5 minutes and no shake.

On the contrary--hidden gems are just waiting to be discovered, and The Hideaway Bar and Grille is one of the best.\\n\\n\\n Upon introducing said friends, never have these lucky ducks failed to express enthusiastic enjoyment for this quaint little dive. The Hideaway has been in the same location for over 60 years, and one could imagine the same characters sitting in the same stools every day since then. Even so, this is NOT an old man pub. Its trademark seems to be that every type of person--from younglings to old war vets to hipsters to bikers--simply everyone fits in and finds something to love at the Hideaway.\\n\\n\\n I heartily recommend lounging on the patio and burying your face in the humungous hand-shaped burgers, but only if you love a big juicy burger that drips down your arms and makes you moan. Personally, I go for the Hideaway Special--the combination of crispy bacon and A1 sauce just hits that YUMMM burger spot. You know the one I mean. Other food is good too--big and meaty hot wings, silly-big quesadillas, and a cheesesteak sub that is too good for words.\\n\\n\\n Not to be overlooked, The Hideaway has been voted CHEAPEST BEER IN ORLANDO by Calendar magazine. The cheapness is not outdone by the selection, which is impressive for such a tiny sports-pub establishment. The bar service is efficient as well--often the affable owner, Chip, will wait on you himself and always makes pleasant conversation.\\n\\n\\n Go there. Do it. You'll love it. I brought my rugby team in for one social event and now they won't leave (as Shannon, the ever-smiling barmaid informs me). The reasons for such loyalty will become obvious after one visit. Have I perhaps gone overboard with praise? Well, so be it. After living in Orlando my whole life, I can easily say this bar is my favorite. Whether you're looking for a casual spot that's good for lazy afternoon rendezvous or beer-fueled late-night dancing on the pool table, The Hideaway just can't be beat."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Horrible management. I've been a loyal customer for years, but after my experience today I will never return. The managers are rude and talk down to customers if and when an issue arises.\\n\\nI am 21 years old and from Colorado. When your license expires and you are out of state, which I am, because I go to college and will not be home this summer due to work, the CO Department of Transportation issues an official license extension that you adhere to the back of your license. (It's a sticker.) I was denied my drink because my license is expired according to the date on the front. Obviously, I understood because this happens every time I use my ID. However, normally, once I explain to the bouncer, or bartender, or waiter the extension, they serve me or ask for backup ID first, which I provide. I understand that this is weird, but hey, its Colorado. It doesn't make sense but thats the law. I explain it to my waiter, and he says he has to ask a manager. Makes sense, totally okay. I explain everything to the manager, and he says he can't serve me because \\"the extension is only for driving.\\" FALSE. I've flown on an airplane since my license expired. You cannot fly on an airplane without a valid license. If TSA lets it slide, a subpar, shitty, greasy Mexican restaurant should let it slide. ...because you're not letting anything slide. IT'S A LEGAL EXTENSION.\\n\\nOnce I explained again, nicely and respectfully to the manager, what the Colorado policy was, and read DIRECTLY from the Colorado Government website (here's the page: https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/license-extensions) he looked me in the eye and said that he \\"knows I'm legally 21, but still refuses to serve me.\\" \\n\\nAre you kidding? You know I'm legal but won't serve me? Are you telling me that if I showed you a fake ID with a \\"valid\\" expiration date, you would've served me? Bullshit. Walked right out and will never return.\\n\\nBesides, this place should not have as many good reviews as it does.

Oh boy, count me in!\\"\\n\\nI AM NOT AN ANGRY BITTER PERSON WHO DIDN'T GET THE FOOD AFTER FOOLISHLY WAITING 5 HOURS.\\n\\nI actually got to try every single meat. My brother, being another poor and gullible student albeit good willed, placed an online order a month in advance for mother's day, and my parents would make a 3 hour trip here whereupon we would all feast on the unicorn of all barbeques.\\n\\nIt's mediocre at best. Here's why they get two stars instead of one: Some belligerent person(s) with buyer's remorse will try to say it's cause I got it to go and didn't eat it there. Fair enough.

It was ok, and the crust was nice but it was kinda dry.\\n\\n-Turkey: Like white turkey breast smothered in BBQ sauce. For god's sake skip this or just make your own.\\n\\n-Sausage: Pretty good. Dripping in fat though, and chunky with fat pieces but it was flavorful\\n\\n-Pulled pork: Ew ew ew not only did it look like a pile of hairy meat it has that...meat smell. You \\nknow what I'm talking about, if the meat wasn't flavored all the way through it has \\nthat..sickening dog food-y meat smell. Smother it in BBQ sauce and you can swallow it.\\n\\n-Ribs: Still has that long dead meat smell. It was juicy though, juicy dead meat smelling ribs. Yes all meat we eat is dead meat, but it has /that/ dead meat smell. This was probably the best thing though as the meat was tender and it did fall off the bone but have I praised Terry black enough yet?

They do have their sauces down, it's nice thick and doesn't run all over the place.\\n\\nSo my brother spent $100 ish give or take for all of this. Meat was about 5 pounds. Sides were in LARGE containers, I was surprised. They did put effort in the packaging. This was more than enough food for 8+ people.\\n\\nFamily verdict? Dad took one bite of meat and wandered back to playing games on his laptop. My mom \\"loved\\" it...and proceeded to sit there and cut her food into tiny bits and took really really small bites while praising how good the BBQ sauce was. I stripped the crust of the ribs and ate that. My bf said he preferred Terry's. My brother piled his plate. So there's that.\\n\\nI mean for the value it's pretty good. We had so much left over, but letting it sit and marinate in the dead meat juice made it downright un- stomachable for me and left the meat chewy and gross. I still have some in my fridge from 3 days ago; normally a frugal person like me would eat everything before I buy more food but the days after that I went to HEB just to get something else to eat.

I had that with a spice bomb, ginger and nori. They only gave 2 pieces of nori which I guess explains why it was just 25 cents but really disappointing. The ginger was a good amount as after mixing I could taste at least a bit in almost every bite. The spicy bomb was nice. It was a little more intense than the cashier described but comes on the side so you can add as little or as much as you want. I added only half and thought it was pretty intense so possibly start with a chopstick full and go on from there.

In recent memory, only my French Laundry review (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-french-laundry-yountville-2#hrid:N4ajP3s6EZl_cAzAK0SEiw) has proven more difficult. Like much of the nation, as well as the city of Austin, I've learned much about 'cue since Franklin BBQ first opened (and since I wrote my original review). Aaron Franklin's timing in opening his restaurant proved fortuitous, coinciding with a massive explosion in popularity for all things smoked.\\n\\nAs I wrote in my original review, the wait is real. And now it's spectacular, having grown exponentially since 2010. First, a big hearty thanks to the wife (for which I will pay in back messages), who woke up when I didn't in order to line up at Franklin starting at 9am. That put our party fourth in line, which was, well, awesome. Being the late sleeper that I am, I sauntered up at 10:15, when the line extended to the end of the parking lot. Pro tip: bring chairs, beers, a book, a football--whatever you need to keep you busy for two hours.\\n\\nSince my original visit, I have swung by Franklin a time or three, each time way too late in the game. Simply marveling at the extent to which BBQ addicts will wait for Mr. Franklin to open his doors is an experience in itself. Frankly, I'm surprised no intrepid Austin Yelper has created a \\"Franklin BBQ Line\\" Yelp entry yet.\\n\\nWith Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations episode in Austin set to premiere on Labor Day 2012, I figured this was our last best chance to re-experience Franklin before the wait extended even longer. Honestly, 3 hours doesn't seem out of the question. It's a pain for out-of-towners to sacrifice that much of their visit to play this waiting game. But I had to know if it was worth it.\\n\\nLike I said originally, I've learned a lot about BBQ since my previous review. Most importantly I guess, I have seen the light when it comes to the sanctity of Texas meat. Sauce may be a big deal in France and Italy, but that don't fly in the great state of Texas. Thus, I eat the best BBQ mostly sauce-free these days. That said, I'm still not a fan of Franklin's kooky espresso sauce, nor the vinegar-based Carolina. The third, more regular Texan one, is good. As for the sides: good beans, decent potato salad, did not try the slaw.\\n\\nAll right, here's the payoff. Half-lean, half-fatty, with more than enough for leftovers. Yes, it's true: the world-famous Aaron Franklin brisket is very, very good. It looks good when Franklin himself unwraps it at the counter. When he slices into it and the juices come flowing. When it piles high on your plate of butcher paper. When you salivate before you take your first bite. And when you watch it in all its glory on No Reservations thinking about just how delicious it would be melting in your mouth.\\n\\nBUT. Yes, there is a but. Is it a mind-blowing, x times infinity better experience than any other brisket I have ever had in my life? Is it worth the excruciatingly long wait? Is it, well, a not-so-small slice of heaven? Boy, that's a hard question to answer.\\n\\nPeople talk about the holy trinity of BBQ--brisket, sausage, ribs. For me, the holy trinity is that one perfect bite of brisket: a bite with equal parts crust, fat, and meat. It is a bite that forces your body to emit an obligatory moan in response to how good that food just tasted. My personal favorite is Snow's, where practically every bite tastes like pure perfection. When I think of Franklin's brisket, there are certainly some bites that made my eyes roll into the back of my head. But, almost inexplicably, there are also some that do not.\\n\\nHere is my biggest concern, which holds constant from my original review. The fatty brisket can skew heavy on the fat content. It literally leaves a pool of oil on the butcher paper. At its worst, it's almost too rich. Consequently, after a bite of pure meat caramel, a bite of lean can come off as too dry.\\n\\nIf this strikes you as harsh, it's only because expectations are astronomical. Like my 4-star review for French Laundry, my rating of Franklin is based on a curve. Given the overwhelming hype and the excessive wait times, Franklin has to be far better than anything else on the planet. There is, fairly or not, a higher standard. And quite honestly, when I travel to Austin for a weekend, I would much rather wait 15 minutes for JMueller (and his excellent beef ribs) than 2 hours for Franklin.\\n\\nI love that Anthony Bourdain's boldly asserted that \\"Austin has the best barbeque in the country\\"  I just think you have to include the hill country in that statement. Like I said, Franklin BBQ is very, very good. And it truly is an experience. But there is so much good BBQ in the area that I can't call Franklin far and away the best there is. To end things here, I'll leave it up to you to decide whether that juicy, delectable meat is worth your wait."},{"name":"Hunan Pearl","address":"15160 SW Bangy Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Foods there taste funny.

But the bottom line is that it's been about a month since my last experience there and I'm still pretty pissed, so they deserve the fire. \\n\\nI have frequented Kung Fu often since the end of February this year. At the time, I was a bartender as well, so there was that feeling of service industry camaraderie. I had a specific bartender (who I will refrain from naming) I ordered from exclusively and I try to be an appropriate tipper - like I said, I was industry, too. \\n\\nOn mother's day - and I am a mother, so on what I considered my holiday, I found myself with spare time and freedom after work to grab some celebratory drinks with friends. The special was $1 mimosas (great deal) on Sunday, so that's what I had. I had three. Three $1 mimosas completed my total orders for the entire night. Other drinks were bought for me. I also gave my bartender specific instructions that only I could order on my tab. When I paid out, my tab was $14.00. I was annoyed but didn't push it as I assumed he ignored my instructions and let the friend with me order on my tab a few times - I figured I'd just cover her. A few days later, the 14 showed up on my bank statement ALONG WITH a SEPARATE tab of $30.00. I immediately called and spoke with a manager who said \\"it would be really hard and annoying\\" (basically) but that he would have to pull receipts and go through to compare signatures. I told him he won't find a receipt for a $30 tab with my name on it because I didn't sign for one, authorize it or order ANYTHING on it. He said he would call me back and never did. When I followed up multiple times, the phone line wouldn't even let me leave a message. \\n\\nI finally gave up after they ADDED A FIVE DOLLAR TIP to the erroneous tab and realized they were just going to be unprofessional dicks about it. \\n\\nBut I can be forgiving, too. The following Sunday I went back. My tab was $16 this time. I tipped to $20, signed and left early in the night. AGAIN THERE WAS A SEPARATE THIRTY DOLLAR TAB added to my bank account. I called, got no response EVER, and a few days later, they added the $5 tip again. Two weeks in a row of this I have officially been flat out robbed of $70.00 of my hard-earned money. \\n\\nI can with all honesty say that, while I like free ski ball and life-sized jenga, I will NEVER again go to Kung Fu unless I am forced, and if I do, I will pay for each drink in cash. Cause as far as I'm concerned, they are thieving jerks and this amounts the absolute worst industry service I have ever experienced. \\n\\nFAIL, Kung Fu! Fail! \\n\\nCASE IN POINT: I just called. Right now. As I post this. The phone wasn't answered, the voicemail said \\"To leave a general message, please hold\\" - then an automated woman's voice says \\"Thank you for calling, goodbye.\\" That's what I've gotten from them.

I understand how it works with their style of service but I didn't expect to be waiting so long in between dishes. The only saving grace was how delicious the food was.

I have been to this place for lunch a couple times, and I must say that sitting on the patio in the summer is my favorite way to spend my time here. My most recent visit was in the winter though and it was still a fabulous experience. The round shape of the establishment is so trendy and gives it an upscale feel, yet it is still casual for a daytime lunch. The view is wonderful and I love that the Scioto Mile trails are so close so that you can go for a walk before or after the meal! My most recent visit I had the skillet Mac n cheese and it was so tasty. Definitely a great take on a classic with the bacon and tomatoes. So so good. The beer I had was amazing as well! I believe it is their house beer that they collaborated with a brewery to make special for their restaurant. It was a Pilsner and it was very reasonably priced and easy to drink.

I already had low expectations going in about being overpriced and not very good food so that fact that I was still disappointed from that point is pretty bad.  Now I understand we had a large group of ten people, but when barely half even ordered the over expensive drinks it shouldn't take 45 minutes to get them.  It is extremely loud and I mean to the point where I couldn't hear my friends even sitting next to me let alone trying to have a real dinner conversation.  Finally about an hour later or so our food starts to arrive.  Now I was the only one who ordered soup with my meal.  My assumption is that soup comes beforehand (as do appetizers if any were ordered unless you specify you want it with your meal.) If anyone thinks I got my soup first they are mistaken.  We see one of the waiters trying to read the receipt on who's order is who's. Not like you can yell it out since you can't hear anything.  I see my soup and specifically say it's mine.  Well he is so confused and giving people the wrong food he takes the rest of the food back to the kitchen.  Including my soup I so longingly wanted.  More food with more waiters come out, by the way, we got seated around 9:40 and its now past 10:45pm the restaurant is practically empty at this point so it shouldn't be very difficult.  I finally see my Turkey Club I ordered but now my soup is missing.  Not to mention my friends order next to me was never made and they have to rush his order.  Finally my soup comes....after my sandwich...freezing cold.  It was French onion soup and the cheese had hardened.  I was too hungry to care and I know it would take another hour to remake so I gave up.  The turkey club said it contained avocados and in the picture they are slices.  The person on the other side of me got the same thing.  Neither of us got avocado slices, the pure reason for getting the club instead of the BLT.  I just wanted to leave and take my food to go at that point. I was tired and frustrated and for the amount I paid was disgusted. Not to mention they did an automatic gratuity of a whopping 20%!!!!.  Even Disney only does 18% and for what they serve and their absorbent prices for horrible food and service that was just the icing on the cake.  I would never go back there and never recommend this place to anyone.  It was low grade deli food at best.  I could get a $4 steak and shake meal that tastes better and has faster service.  SMH\\n\\nP.S.  They have a guy who dances like he is on a stripper pole for people's birthdays when they get a dessert with a sparkler which is funny and all, but when there is a table with an 8 year old boy next to the birthday girl at the table next to them maybe its not a good idea to be rubbing your butt in her face right next to the child.

Six days later, we were back. I think that probably says enough? But I'm verbose, so I'm going to forge ahead and divulge our dining experiences.\\n\\nBoth times we went, our server was Caroline. To be honest, I never really pay attention to the service anywhere unless there's something glaringly bad about it. I always expect and experience a moderate to good server interaction (since we live in foodie Boulder), so for me, service is secondary. I have to make an exception here, though. Caroline was absolutely fantastic. Usually I feel a little self-conscious asking for extra bread, sauce, whatever -- especially during happy hour, when prices are cheaper. Caroline didn't bat an eyelash at our request for more bread, brought out extra sauces, and just was pleasant, intuitive, and a great people person in general. She remembered us the second time we went, and used what she recalled from our first experience to make our second experience even better (which I didn't think was possible). Sforno got really lucky with her!\\n\\nThe first time we went to happy hour, we got calamari, some bruschetta, tempura veggies, and a pizza (yes, we're very healthy eaters). We ordered all this because happy hour is usually small plates and we were very hungry. Suffice it to say we ended up going home with a whole pizza. Portions for happy hour are *very* generous. Surprisingly generous. For $5.00 you get twice the calamari you do at The Kitchen or Jax, and it's good quality. We discovered that you can make a super delicious calamari sauce by mixing together the spicy pomodoro sauce (the calamari's default) with Sforno's garlic aioli sauce. The tempura veggies were very good, and I did enjoy the pizza. I think Pizzeria Locale's pizza is slightly better because of the fresh buffalo mozzarella that PL uses, but to be fair, PL's pizza *should* be better than every other pizza in town because that's what they specialize in. I still really enjoyed the Sforno pizza. We've tried margherita and then the one with sausage and mushrooms. If you're on the fence, I'd get the sausage and mushroom one, though the margherita is also good!\\n\\nWe've also tried the shrimp, which actually was quite fresh and good (I was surprised since, you know, we're not by an ocean); and the pear/honey bruschetta -- also good, but a little awkward to try to eat. Granted, I like to eat things in tiny bites for some weird reason, and bruschetta is hard to cut. You probably won't be as awkward as me with the bruschetta, so you should get it.\\n\\nIt also should be noted: Sforno's complimentary bread and dipping sauce is freaking delicious. I don't know what they put in that sauce, and I don't want to know because then I would make it all the time and gain a bunch of weight. I'll just indulge when I go there. \\n\\nDefinitely give this place a try!

The pros: The space is perfect. Dark and sexy, it really does evoke a \\"speakeasy' vibe and could be the setting for a fabulous meal. However, the food (with one or two exceptions) is mediocre and the service dreadful. We all started by sharing the fried halumi, their meatballs and the 100 layer spanakopita. The restaurant-in-residence is Pelekasis, a Greek affair. The halumi and meatballs were fine, but the spanakopita was to-die-for. If I'd just ordered two more of those and called it a night, all could have been well. However, these \\"medium-sized\\" plates were pretty small, so most of us opted to choose an entire from the \\"large plate\\" section of the menu. There were only three options. Lamb, fish and pork. Vegetarians were out of luck and had to have apps and the vegan at our table had even fewer options and opted for sides. Anyway, I ordered the lamb sirloin and it arrived extremely late and very cold. I sent it back to be reheated because I really have no interest in a cold supper. Once back and reheated, the lamb was fine, but not spectacular. Speaking of late arrivals, our waiter was barely with us all night, he forgot to bring two side dishes we ordered, and when we said that yes, we would like dessert, he didn't return with menus and oder-taking for almost 20 minutes. So, we declined dessert. It appears that they were short-staffed, so that may explain it, but that's no excuse.

Honestly, while it's acceptably clean here, I really prefer doing take-out. \\n\\nI haven't deviated much, admittedly, as I mainly get the wonton noodle soup with beef brisket. You don't find many places in the Boston area, much less Quincy, that serves this. So I generally come here for that fix. You get a nice amount of tender brisket but a decent amount of good wontons. The noodles have that bouncy texture and are not mushy. The broth is pretty savory as well. I've gotten the scallion pancakes here but it's mainly due to my laziness and not because they're anything outstanding.\\n\\nService is okay, with the ever-present lady there always cheerful, especially if you know Chinese.\\n\\nThere's more HK-style cafe food like baked pork chop with creamy rice and curry beef stew with noodles.

And I've lived in NC, TN, and Texas. Their wait staff is impeccable, and the food is... Well, let's put it this way, I felt like I was trapped in some kind of some level of heaven, the entire time I was there. The entire experience is other-worldly. To start off, we ordered the fried oysters, which were AMAZING, but the two people I was with didn't care for them, which is fine... Seafood doesn't appeal to everyone, and that only meant... more for me!  My partner and I ordered the brisket, and our friend ordered the fried chicken. Jesus Christ, everything was phenomenal. Keep in mind,  I loathe potato salad, which is a standard side for a lot of their entrees. Their potato salad was DELICIOUS and I had to lick my fingers. The BEST thing about this entire experience was...they messed up our order. Lost it. We were waiting for our main courses for over an hour because of it. The way the staff addressed that problem was fantastic. Ideal. The manager came out, personally apologized, and said or drinks were on the house, and offered us a free dessert. We chose the ban-offee pie, which is one of the best desserts I have ever tasted (and I'm a chocolate queen). DO NOT pass this place up due to it's popularity.

The people working the takeout must be overwhelmed constantly as they occasionally get cranky.  But, my tips do not go unappreciated and I always receive a \\"thank you\\".  It takes a bit for the order to get ready but you are rewarded with a simple, no fuss, pretty tasty burger.  The fries are nothing special but the onion rings are delicious.\\n\\nThe last time I was there, the system went down and we had to wit over 20 minutes yet no one informed us - I only knew because I was second in line and the people ahead of me told me when I asked what was causing the delay.

My SO and I go every chance we can get, though it is an investment of time and patience to get a seating. Also - we go for dinner. I've never been for brunch. I don't have patience for the lines to get breakfast in my hometown. I just don't. So - think dinner when you read my review.\\n\\nIf you have heard about screen door, you know the food is amazing and get the Fried Chicken. Blah blah blah - it is amazing and worth some patience and an open wallet. My review is entirely about seating, staff, and ambiance. \\n\\nSeating: The first rule of Screen Door - is you don't talk about Screen Door. If you do talk about it, it will be even harder to get seated after 6. :-)  Go an hour before the first seating for dinner (or Sunday brunch). Yes, an hour. Go over to a bar or coffee shop nearby with a direct view of the line situation and get a drink. When the line starts to creep up to about 10 people, go get in line. STAT. You need to be IN LINE when the door opens, but not farther back than the end of their building to get seated on first seating. If you don't do that, you should wait an hour after they open and then go wait. You'll be in the rotating tables by then and less painful, but don't be starving when you first get there. If you are one of those people who can't plan, you'll be waiting, so keep that in mind. Oh - there IS a list. Get in the door and get your name on it when you get there if you are after the first seating. \\n\\nAmbiance: SD has been open for a few years, but still keeps it's original cool. The atmosphere is southern - almost gamey steampunk but toes the line well of remaining socially appropriate for all who enter. You can take Grandma here and your picky friend from out of town and still have a nice time. It's loud, so don't try to be romantic unless you get to sit on the patio. It's good for dates, but only if you're into being a little chill and having fun having a nice meal. Its Southern Food, if you aren't into that when you go, maybe just don't go. You'll write a crap review and ruin it for everyone else. \\n\\nStaff: Always stellar. Once in a while it can take a bit for them to get to you again after first pass, but that's rare. They seem to know how to keep everyone happy, tables attended but not overly-so (nobody wants to be smothered) and extremely friendly. No - you do not have to get your own water as has been so chic lately. I friggen' hate that. I expect to get water at a bar, but not when I'm willing to tip big for a nice meal. I appreciate Screen Door for keeping up on the hospitality. PS: The Bartenders know what they are doing. An Old Fashioned is a perfect Old Fashioned. \\n\\nIn short - go for a very nice time and be patient. They do have little markers on the menu for things that are GF and Veg.

I was recommended Condado by the woman at the front desk from my hotel in WV! I knew it was a must try when I was having it recommended to me by people in different states.\\n\\nI went to Condado with the two other guys I was traveling for lunch on a Thursday and it was packed! This was the second good sign about Condado. \\n\\nCondado is unique in the way that you order because they give you sheets of paper that have either house recommended tacos or you can create your own, you the check on the paper what you want and they collect the papers. \\n\\nThey will ask if you want guacamole and queso as an appetizer which we decided to get both and my oh my am I glad we did, they were both delicious and plentiful. My favorite part was that they came with homemade tortilla chips! Not the paper thin, cut the roof of your mouth chips either, the chips were nice and thick, perfectly cooked. I will warn that the guacamole and queso are $8 each, but since we were sharing I think they were definitely worth the price. \\n\\nThe tacos range in price from $3 - $7 and the ones you create yourself start at $3.50, but can go higher if you choose the premium options, though there were so many options included in the price I had no need to spend the extra money on the premium choices. \\n\\nCondado has an energetic and fun atmosphere, with a very large bar and selection of drinks. I wish I lived in Columbus so I could come for their late night menu (11pm-2am) where tacos are only $1.50!\\n\\nA must try if you're in Columbus!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Sickest bbq I have ever had, I don't think I would do that wait very often as its not worth it unless your making a day of it.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"You can find Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q at 1238 Dekalb Ave NE Atlanta, GA 30307, right on the border of Little Five Points and Candler Park, at the Dekalb Ave overpass across Moreland. \\n\\nThis was my first time at Fox Bros actually sitting down and eating as every previous time the wait has been an hour so my party has always gone elsewhere. I have ordered from the counter in the past and my company used to frequently cater from these guys but less so now (most recently a couple of Fridays ago) so I'm very familiar with the food - the quality of the rub and rind here indeed supports the multiple rewards they're received - they usually find themselves in the Top 10 lists of BBQ places in Atlanta and sometimes Georgia. Thinking about the food makes my mouth water, even as I'm writing this. \\n\\nYesterday started as a regular get-together as I was with a friend and suggested that we have a late lunch here before hitting Arches Brewing for a talk on local beer history (awesome new brewery in Hapeville, by the way). Due to the 1 hour wait, we went to Krog Street Market then the brewery. We were joined by one other and around 6:00 thought we would try Fox Bros again. I guess I had so oversold Fox Bros that they really, really wanted to experience it, even after I suggested we go to the exceptional Pit Boss (also close by the brewery) - I think we got to Fox about 6:30 and figured that we could wait out the 1.5 hour wait-time for a table (and believe me, I never wait more than 30 minutes but my friends really wanted this Q, especially after standing in the smoke-filled air). We ordered a round of beers and waited outside.\\n\\nWhen we came earlier in the day it was raining and so crowded that the hostess suggested we could wait on the patio under the umbrellas - since there was a small table unoccupied we set up our wait there and had a beer. By then the buzz from the brewery was pretty much gone - we were just conversing. After about an hour we were asked to vacate the table - a bit weird as we could have eaten and been gone as we were waiting to be seated but no sweat. We got a second beer and stood near the railing. We were half-way though the second beer when we were notified our table was ready. We walked to the corner and had just been seated when things get interesting. \\n\\nThe manager? came by to let us know that we were cut-off from any more alcohol - that there was some report of an incident and that it was OK for us to eat but no more beer. We looked at each other bewildered and starting asking about what we did? She left for a bit then returned to say that my friend Arvin had threatened one of the servers with his beer glass - what? We told her that there must be some mistake - we were all there and it just didn't happen, but she didn't back down. It was a bit of a \\"eat and GTFO\\" moment. So we ordered the bone-on beef rib, the pulled pork, a rack of pork ribs with a side of slaw and Texas toast. Food was awesome as usual but as I sat there I started getting a stomach ache - not because of the food but because I couldn't reconcile the attitude we were receiving from this place of business.\\n\\nAs many of you know, I worked in the industry as a chef for 10 years, retiring after a stint at Indigo Coastal Grill near this very restaurant - I used to bike to work from my house on North Highland and know this neighborhood. Having worked both front and back of the house, I have a keen understanding of the restaurant business and the need for restaurants to protect their staff - I totally get that. But this was just weird. The three of us weren't being obnoxious, weren't loaded or exhibiting anything that would make the business perceive us as being threatening. It's my opinion that whoever pointed us out mistook our table for another group. The fact that we were so bewildered should have provided some clue to the \\"manager\\" that we weren't the right group. We basically ate our food and left.\\n\\nI can understand if something happened - heck if we were drunk and belligerent I would expect to be thrown out as the actions of one can upset the whole restaurant dynamic. If something had indeed happened, why wasn't the cop stationed in the parking lot leading us off premises? Instead we get an \\"eat and GTFO\\"? And herein lies the rub. This whole incident has my gut twisted up as I do love the food here, but the night just rings with a level of arrogance that I don't find very palatable. In fact I don't think I can ever come back as the events have ruined Fox Bros for me. To think that my friends were so enthralled by my description that we waited for 1.5 hours to sit when we could have gone to innumerable restaurants elsewhere in Atlanta, only to be treated with suspicion and disdain, speaks of a restaurant where good service has been replaced by ego and contempt for those customers who buy their wares. Perhaps I'm being sensitive? I don't know but right now I'm done with Fox Bros.\\n\\n(also posted to my food blog)"},{"name":"Taipei Noodle Haus","address":"11642 NE Halsey St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This an update as my roommate picked us up some take away from Taipe Noodle Haus last nite.

I like the thicker cuts, and it is often the way I make it at home. \\nThe soup was decent, though overly spiced...all I could fast was the star anise. Another big no-no was that the soup was not hot enough. When you add the cold vegetables and pre-cooked noodles to the mildly hot soup, you get lukewarm pho....sound tasty to you?\\nI really hope that pho fast could make some changes to how they deliver the pho. I think some minor adjustments, such as cooking noodles to the order (which only take a minute) and making sure the soup is piping hot, we might have good pho from a cart!

When it hits your table the dome is lifted, and the smoke wafted around to permeate the air. The subtle trick is that the condensation on the glass also gets infused with the smoke, so that as you drink the aroma never completely goes away. Genius (I had two)!

All I remember from it was that the brisket was tender and sauce was great. But I'm reviewing this mostly as a music venue after being there mid-July for three nights for my favorite band, Spoon. \\n\\nIt's an open-air venue that I'd say is about medium-sized, standing room only in the dirt. Staff gives out wristbands while lined up and even did a security check before doors opened just to make things go smoother. That was good! \\n\\nI made my way to the front rail surprisingly a lot easier than I ever thought without running (just fast walking) even though I must've had at least 20 people ahead of me in line. I guess you Austinites aren't as cut-throat as most folks I deal with in California. Since it was about an average of 100+ degree weather for that weekend, the staff there were urging people to take advantage of the free water in the back of the venue. Helpful, but not so helpful for people like me since there was no way I'd ever move from my front and center spot. What they should've been doing is giving the water out in the front too. Security staff there should have been generous with giving out water in the front, especially since a few people around me were dropping like flies halfway through Spoon's set  from dehydration and etc. Some of those staff members watching the crowd in front had a full case of water bottles and only gave it out if a person looked seconds away from passing out. How about handing some water out earlier to prevent that? And it'd be nice if there was a no smoking policy in this place. I understand if you smokers want a smoking section in these type of places, but don't smoke in the front row only to have that spreading all over the crowd. \\n\\nIf I ever go to SXSW or just back to Austin for more shows, I  have to avoid this place if the weather's gross."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Second rate show, dinner was Ok, nothing to write home about.

That alone would bring me into any establishment. I love restaurants where the owner shares something they are really passionate about.\\n\\nThen, the food. I took my boyfriend there for his birthday so we got a ton of things to sample. We started with the country fried wings and then got a platter with 3 meats: chicken, sliced brisket, and spare ribs. The sides were the mac and cheese and the baked beans. It also came with cornbread and pickles.\\n\\nAll of that, plus 4 sauces that are already on the table.\\n\\nIt was the most glorious meat-filled feast. If there was a way to die happy, it would be death by Soulfire.\\n\\nThe wings are great, super big and juicy with such a crunchy crust. You can eat them alone or with any of the 4 sauces they give you.\\n\\nThe spare ribs are AMAZING! The meat dissolves in your mouth. The rub they use is incredible.\\n\\nWe ended up with the rotisserie chicken (we meant to order pulled chicken, which we had had before but there was a bit of a mis-communication with our waitress, granted it was her first day). It was the best chicken I had ever had!\\n\\nThe brisket was great as well, served atop a giant piece of Texas toast, ready to soak up any leftover sauce.\\n\\nI don't like mac and cheese, but my boyfriend loved it, especially with the bbq chips on top.\\n\\nThe baked beans...oh, the baked beans! Hands-down my favorite part of the meal. I would bathe in them. They are home made, smokey, and amazing.  You MUST order them. Even if you don't think you like baked beans, just give them a try. You are in Boston, after all! And these are unlike any baked beans you've ever tasted.\\n\\nSo, in all, the meal was fab. And what I liked the most is that all of the meat is kind of DIY. They do amazing rubs and cooking, but they don't do an overkill with sauce. You get to pick your sauce and put it on yourself, so whether you like your ribs naked or loaded with sweetness or with a kick of spice, you get to choose! Which is especially awesome if you are sharing with a ton of people.\\n\\nTheir wine is also great - not crap wine like some other small restaurants will offer, aka not out of a box.\\n\\nOh, and did I mention the baked beans?!"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We have been dying to try this place for years after reading good reviews.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here last night since our last BBQ meal came from Fat Matt's and I was less than pleased with the fatty, greasy ribs and tiny sides. This was our second visit, but our first visit was long ago. We decided to split the Everything Plate ($22.95) where you can choose four meats. We opted for two 4-racks of ribs, four wings and 1/4 dark chicken. We also added a slice of the jalapeno cornbread to our order.\\n\\nFood was on our table within 10 minutes. Excellent, because I was ravenous and had been craving ribs for a while. I was definitely happy -- while my boyfriend found the ribs a bit too dry and salty, I thought they were great. I guess it's all a matter of preference. The outsides were charred and reminded me of beef jerky. The meat was nice and tender and smoky. They had little fat on them, which I definitely like. We were given little dipping containers of \\"white barbecue sauce\\" -- a weird concept, but it was delicious with the chicken and ribs. I also had a drumstick and was very pleased that the meat was so tender and flavorful. I also tried a bit of the wings... I wasn't crazy about the flavor because it reminded me strongly of buffalo wings and I'm not a fan of those. \\n\\nThe meal also comes with two sides. We got the baked beans and mac and cheese. Beans were very good, on the sweet side. Mac and cheese was in the form of large pasta shells with creamy cheese. Very good. \\n\\nThe cornbread was the big winner of the night, though. They bake cheddar into the bread. CHEDDAR. I do love my cheesy jalapeno cornbread. With a generous spread of the sweet butter on it, I was in heaven. I was tempted to order another but we already had a mountain of food to take on, plus the slice of cornbread was a bit pricey for my taste at $1.95. I think this place is a bit overpriced in general. If you wanted the mac and cheese on its own, for example, be prepared to shell out $3.95 for a cup. Then again, Fat Matt's is not much better with their even tinier portions for $2 a pop. \\n\\nParking sucks. The lot's spaces are oddly placed and people usually just park anywhere.

Since we were coming up on our last weekend, we decided to give brunch a shot. \\n\\nWe came around 11:30 on a Sunday. That was our mistake. The hostess told us 1.5 hours. Although it seemed like a long time, we thought we should wait since this was our only opportunity to eat here. \\n\\nGuess how long it took to finally be seated?? Wait for it...wait for it... THREE hours! Yes, 3!\\n\\nOnce you approach 1.5 hours, you think \\"any minute now, right?\\" Then the hostess kept telling us we were close. Then 2 hours passed- \\"do we leave now? We have to be next, right???\\" Once you wait that long, you can't walk away right? Well, if we could do it over, I'd walk away. There's no food worth a 3 hour wait (plus additional 45mins before food arrived). Also, how does a hostess miss the mark by that long? That's just ridiculous. There were a lot of angry folks waiting.  Typically they overshoot, not undershoot by 1.5hrs!!!! \\n\\nI just felt disappointed after waiting that long. I had the biscuits and veg gravy. It was good, but I think Pine State is better. The veg sausage was good, too (as far as veg sausage goes that is). The potatoes were a little too burnt for my liking. I like crispy, but not these. I also tried their chicken and it was good, but I think Tasty-n-Sons is better. Our table also split the banana foster French toast and that was awesome. It was definitely the best thing I had. \\n\\nI'm from the south so most of the food seemed pretty average to me and definitely not worth a 4 hour wait.

Sonsie is dependable but uninspiring.  Surely it's decision to play it safe is a result of the business ties to folks/out-of-towners in the Newbury/Hynes area.   \\n\\nIn high-rent but walker friendly Newbury strip,  Sonsie's value proposition is the bar area and people watching - the layout is that of a Parisian cafe.

CANTINA\\n\\nIn a city rich with so-called Mexican restaurants, one stands out as a true diamond in the rough.  No Mas! Cantina and Hacienda resides in the former Aristocrat Ice Cream Company in the up and coming, diverse Castleberry Hills district.  Owners, Walt Bilinski and Steve MacNeil, envisioned bringing the best of Mexico to ATL through art, food, and fun. This oasis opened in August 2006 and provides a quick escape to South of the border without having to go through airport security.\\n\\nThe Hacienda is breathtaking with its unique offerings from over 300 talented Mexican artisans.  The ADios Caf√©/ Bakery dazzles ones senses with its delectable goodies.  Then of course there is the Cantina with its Mexican-inspired foods prepared by self-learned executive chef, Se√±orita Melody Voirin. \\n\\n \\nThere is no mass production here; even the chips and salsa are made fresh throughout the day.  The smoky chipotle-flavored salsa is the perfect partner with the robust taste of the smooth Dulce Margarita-with Partida Blanco Tequila, fresh limejuice, and Agave nectar.  Each handmade glass is adorned with a bracelet, a good way to keep count. It was a three-bracelet night ...\\n\\nTo get things going, the warm flavors of the pureed Butternut Squash soup in a house-made chicken stock are simply divine.  As the last slurp disappeared, Cajy, our knowledgable server, delivered the awesome Calamari Frito con Jalape√±os.  These flash fried treats match perfectly with the chipotle ranch and avocado cream sauces.  Dip the jalape√±o in the mouth-cooling avocado cream and the calamari in the tangy chipotle ranch and let your taste buds go on a roller coater ride.\\n\\nThe multi-faceted chicken Quesadilla Roja is not like any other in the city.  Melody showcases her skills through this dish. The chicken, goat cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes dance with tangy tropical flavors from the mango, pineapple, cilantro, onion, and jalape√±o salsa. This is way too good... When I thought the quesadilla was the best ever, out came the otherworldly Tilapia Fish Taco.  The Tilapia is lightly coated in a seasoned masa breading, flash fried in order to retain all its deliciousness, then topped with a jicama coleslaw and creamy chipotle sauce and wrapped in a freshly made tortilla- unbelievable.  \\n\\nAs for the house specialties, the Camarones Alambres, perfectly grilled jumbo shrimp on a sugar cane skewer resting on top a masa cake with sweet fried plantains touched with an exotic tamarind sauce is a treat not to be missed.  One of Melody's favorites, and mine as well, is the Pollo Relleno, after this you will never have a Chili Relleno again.  The 24-hour marinated, grilled chicken breast is stuffed with rajas poblano pepper, Chihuahua cheese, and drizzled with salsa verde, served with cilantro-mashed potatoes is melt in your mouth good.  To satisfy that carnivore craving, the savory Bistek Caf√© Tamarindo- a skirt steak marinated with a coffee rub, spices, and tamarind with roasted acorn squash puree and seasonal vegetables, each bite seemed to be better than the last.\\n\\nIt is always hard to save room for dessert, but at No Mas! Cantina you are on vacation. The delicate flavors of the Avocado Lime Cheese Cake and the seasonal Pumpkin Flan are heavenly. However, it's the Cuatro Leches that is simply decadent- a moist white layer cake made with four types of milk, topped with a Kahula frosting.  Enjoy these yummy gems with either the Gingerbread Chai or Mayan Mocha.\\n\\nWhen you get that \\"got to get away\\" feeling and you just can't, No Mas! Cantina and Hacienda is waiting to give you that escape to Mexico at least for a while. The next day you'll realize that you can't wait until that feeling comes back again."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Honestly, not sure it's worth the wait?!\\n\\nThe food is delicious, the staff are all friendly and patient and the wait time from ordering to arriving is timely.

More recently I came for dinner with some girlfriends. There was a delectable holiday cocktail which was a cranberry moscow mule. One of my friends and I shared the 3-choice dinner where one could pick three items for about $16 on the right side of the menu. We had the chicken drums (3 pieces), collard greens, and cauliflower cakes, plus it came with an herb biscuit - all so savory and flavorful.

The address is auto-fill in so I know it's filled in. So it took forever just to get the food.\\n\\nSecond....food....When I got the food it was cold....I had for lunch the amazing chicken....might be amazing....if your green and live in a trash can......The chicken had a rubber texture, and had a pellical to it...a pellical is when you leave meat out like in the sun, the outside dries....nasty...it was flavorless....the veggies....wilted....watery...there was a soft black spot on my celery....which had me very sickened as that means it was rotten in that spot....the sauce had a shrimp taste to it....nasty. I think this is because despite healthy restaraunt practices, they are using the same flour that they dredge their shrimp in, in every dish....this is a recipe to kill someone....\\n\\nI had tried some of their buns 1 steamed 1 pan fried...I ordered 2 of each planning to share with my girlfriend....unfortunately....one had green mold on it (steamed), and the pan fried one had a black moldy center....they also look like they are from a can....think pillsbury biscuits.\\n\\nI had a free order of crab rangoon....crab there was none in mine...it was just straight cream cheese....or if there was crab in there, there was very little....2 of the wantons were black and burnt to hell....There was maybe a teaspoon or 2 filling per wanton....the wantons that weren't burnt to a crisp were lousy, super greasy, they were not crispy....they were soggy they fell apart in my hand....absolutely terrible...\\n\\nI had for dinner their chicken and broccoli with pork fried rice and chicken terryiaki....My chicken again tasted like shrimp....it was again rubbery....flavorless...I might of well of been eating tofu....cat food has more flavor....this time though I was in for a surprise...not only was it like eating a bouncy rubber ball....which we all did as kids...it was dry....King tut's linen wrappings would of been much more moist and succulent compaired to this travesty called chicken. The broccoli....soft...and not in a good way...there was one broccoli I didn't eat. I didn't eat it cause it was a very funky color....think pastel grey....the broccoli was also wilty....My chicken wasn't fried like my girlfriends and still tasted the same.\\n\\nPork fried rice, absolutely disgusting for me...it was hard...under cooked....the pork none existant...in an entire thing or pork fried rice...there was like 3 small pinky sized chunks of pork....2 of them were rancid flavored pork grisle...the one none grisle pork was also rancid flavored....I stole a bite from my girlfriends pork fried rice and I found it was better in flavor but not by much and it needed salt....thats right....she had me add salt to her rice...isn't chinese american food supposed to be loaded in salt? Yet they didn't season their rice....such a crime....\\n\\nChicken terriyaki that I had....disgusting....not fresh...big chunks of meat...but it had an off flavor to it...and I am pretty sure it's why I spent most my night in the bathroom fighting with what I call MAO's Revenge (montezuma's revenge), Most the night I was in the can....I also had a fever....Despite being hit directly by an ac, and 2 fans on high I was sweating like a pig at a pig roast....when I wasn't in the can I sat on a bag of dirty clothes and a towel cause I was sweating so bad at the foot of the bed and I didn't wanna mess up my girlfriends sheets....I could ring out my towel. Back to this nightmare...the terriyaki I had was poorly seasoned....part of it was under cooked....though undercooked is an understatement....it was FROZEN in the middle......It's like they took it all out of a bag threw it into a microwave and cooked it briefly without checking it....\\n\\nMy girlfriends meal was general gau's chicken with pork fried rice, and I ordered her a bowl of spare ribs....apparently they decided to give her a spring roll instead...the spring roll was cabbaggy....the chicken....again tasted of shrimp....My girlfriend gave me a peice and it was nasty....shrimpy, unflavorful chicken wise, bad sauce....GORDEN RAMSEY couldn't save this place, and I think it needs to be the shut down by health department garden....so depsite that little name change....I would be shocked to see what the kitchen is like...food like this has anyone found a finger, bandaid, both in their food yet?

(Love Cha Ba, but that's another review.) \\n\\nSince we have no great places to eat Thai food in our home town (and we have a Typhoon so I may get beat up for saying there are no great places) we ended up eating at Dang's on two nights during a recent Lake Oswego visit.  We almost never eat at the same place two times in a row. (I would say we never do, but we did here, so there you go.) Winning decision as everything we ordered at Dang's ranged from good to really good. \\n\\nFOOD HIGHLIGHTS:  We are fans of miang kum (sp?), the appetizer that is fresh spinach leaves served with tamarind \\"jam\\", finely diced ginger, peanuts, lime, onions and chiles to fold up in the spinach leaf and pop in your mouth in one perfect bite of sweet, hot, salty, sour Thai perfectness. Not found on all Thai food menus, Dang's not only serves it but gets it absolutely right.  This was the best miang kum we have ever eaten, and we've tried it in many places. \\n\\nThey also had khao soi (sp?), a Burmese influenced noodle dish made with egg noodles and not rice noodles as is more typical in Thai cooking. Dang's khao soi was second only to the khao soi at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas, in our opinion. (Lotus of Siam, in our view, once was best Thai food in the U.S.) \\n\\nSERVICE:  We know there have been concerns raised in reviews in some places about service quality, but on both nights of our visit the service was very good. And on both nights the restaurant had a decent occupancy (not full but up there) and the take out orders seemed to fly out the door. Even with those demands on the kitchen, the pacing of our meal worked. \\n\\nAs for the language barriers mentioned as a factor in some places, the server who waited on us the second night clearly did not speak English as a first language, but they spoke English a whole lot better than we speak their language (which is not at all) and we were guests in \\"their house\\", so it didn't seem a big issue. Patience and courtesy flow both ways in a service setting, seems to us. \\n\\nVALUE:  As with most Thai restaurants (except perhaps Typhoon) the prices here are very reasonable. I can't recall the tab as I post this review, but we drank only tea on both nights and without a bar bill to factor in, it was pretty inexpensive eating for such good food. \\n\\nAMBIANCE:  We liked the atmosphere here too, which is a lot more polished than many Thai restaurants. As we sat by the window and watched the cars whizzing by in the darkness and pouring rain, we thought how lucky we were to be warm and dry and eating good food at Dang's Thai Kitchen. \\n\\nUNEXPECTED: Ample parking in the restaurant's private lot is another plus, especially on a rainy night."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"What is there not to like besides the ridiculously long wait.

Pimento cheese was not as flavorful as I had hoped, but it was good and a perfectly spreadable consistency.   The gravy for the mashed potatoes was wide eyed happy faced emoji. Delicious.  Everything else was fine,  except I was not a fan of the cornbread.  Price was not bad considering how much and the quality of the food.  A very good dining experience and would happily come back here."},{"name":"Revival","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Talk about a come to Jesus meal! Hallelujah!

I think Revival is suffering from an identity crisis. I knew it would be more expensive than a meat and three place, so I was expecting more, a lot more.  Unfortunately while it delivered in some areas the overall experience left me feeling like I was the butt of some celebrity chef's joke. We ordered the Family Dining option which for 42.00 a person included appetizer, corn bread, your choice of an entree, sides and dessert plus coffee or tea. The appetizer of some sort of puffed pastry filled with pimento cheese was incredible, though the dime size portion of pimento cheese left me wanting more. I ordered a cocktail ( Pimm something or other) which was great, but when I asked if iced tea came with the meal, I was told no coffee and hot tea were available. After some time the waiter came back and said he could give me iced tea instead. Thanks for the \\"favor\\" buddy. We were given a kale salad which was fine, and my spouse ordered the pork chop while I ordered the trout. Both were fine, with good quality product but the flavor was good, not great. The sides are what I look forward to more than anything, anyway.. but that's where it got weird. We got like two large tablespoons of each of 4-5 sides. We only really liked 2 of them ( the corn and the dirty rice). The others had a ton of fat and or sodium in them and were too heavy despite being vegetables. We get it- Revival.. you really like fat.  When I asked for more corn.. I got the awkward response that I could order another side. Translation- we can see you don't like these other sides but you will have to pay for that.  Dessert is where they really shine- the fried peach pie and special blend coffee were really excellent. So in summary- if you have 150.00 and want a \\" down home\\" meal grandma might make for 20.00 served to you by a waiter who acts like he is doing you a favor by waiting on you, then have fun."},{"name":"Paul's Omelettery Restaurant","address":"2211 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"If you want burnt black toasted bread is your favourite, go ahead, not me .\\nIt is running down place .\\n\\n1.

Girlfriend got the cat head biscuit, I got the chicken and waffles and we shared the praline bacon. To start off with the best, praline bacon was amazing. I could eat that just by itself. 1 its bacon, 2 it was really good bacon. The chicken and waffles was way to big of a plate for me. Even though it was amazing, I just had no more room to eat it all. I was given 3 big pieces of chicken and 1 waffle, I ate 1 chicken piece and 7/8 of the waffle. I gave my left overs to a nearby homeless man...man he lucked out. The biscuit was amazing and also had chicken, so again trying that with the smothered gravy was amazing. This bicuits and gravy in sandwich form, fantastic. She got the cheddar gritz on the side, not my favorite, but was still pretty good. \\n\\nService, fantastic, but long wait to even get in. I repeat long wait to get in. We got there 30 mins before opening and still had to wait an hour just to be seated. This place can get really busy, so dedicate some time to be seated. If you are in a rush or have a lot of plans that day, save this for a relaxed day. While we waited, we just went to the coffee house next door, was happy with that. Once we were actually seated, our server was friendly, attentive and overall a great server. This is despite the fact that they were beyond slammed. So the service alone deserves an A+.\\n\\nOverall, the service was great, the food was amazing and it was all worth the wait. Really it was worth the hour wait.

Honestly though, the sandwich was so tasty and huge I didn't really care that I didn't like the grits. The biscuit, besides being bigger than my cat's head, was cakey and soft and it looked like they toasted or griddled it before serving which was a nice touch. The chicken for Chicken and Waffles was the same as on the sandwich.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The food here was AMAZING.  You will be sent into a food coma, guaranteed, and at really good prices too.  The waiters, waitresses, and bussers were all very sweet and attentive to my table.  We all loved the atmosphere of it too.  Good music, good food, and nice waiters/waitresses.  It would have been a great time.\\nWhat knocked off two stars though is the hostess.  My party of 7 tried to call ahead to see about reservations or a wait time estimate, but no one answered our three attempts.  No problem - we figured NYE would be super busy.  We get there and I walk up to the hostess podium to put in a table.  I saw three ladies looking at the iPad for reservations, and the blonde one in a pink work shirt instantly disliked me after I said, \\"Hello, I was just wondering how long a wait might be for 7?\\"  She went from laughing with her coworkers to glaring at me (for having interrupted her, maybe?).  I used to work as a restaurant hostess myself, so I was fine when she told me it should be a 1 hour to 1 hour & 15 minute wait.  I figured the attitude might have been some leftover crap from earlier in the day and shrug it off.\\nThey have a text message system, so I confirmed I received the text. I tell my group and we go ahead to start a walk to a nearby coffeeshop to spend our wait time.  5 minutes after booking the table/starting the walk, a friend of ours asked if he could join.  I immediately send a text to the hostess asking how long of a wait it would be if we had 8 people.  No response after a few minutes, so I proceed to call - no answer.  I then get an automated text saying the table is ready and we have 5 minutes to show up or the reservation is cancelled.  10 minute wait total after being told \\"at least an hour.\\"  We were starving though, so we were pleasantly surprised.  We hurry back, and I ask the hostess about the wait for 8 people.  She says, \\"Uh yeah, I saw your text - the table I have for you can only seat 7, not 8.\\"  Weird that she ignored my text but whatever.  I say, \\"Oh okay, so then how long would we wait for a table that seats 8?\\"  I'm still fine and patient at this point.  She rolls her eyes and says, \\"I don't know, probably 30 minutes, 35 minutes.\\"  The other lady in my group asks, \\"Are you sure?  We went from a 1 hour wait to 10 minutes, so we just want to be sure.\\"  The hostess replies, \\"Um honestly, I have no idea what the wait time will really be.  I just wait for tables to clear up.\\"  She seemed really impatient with us, so we just take the 7 table and let our friend eat to go.  I don't know why a hostess would not be able to give a semi-accurate wait time, since knowing wait times is half the job.  I still shrug it off - we were hungry, the food smelled so good, and I tried to still give her the benefit of doubt thinking NYE was too crazy.  I mean, knowing the wait times is even more crucial on busy days and there is obviously technology in place to help figure it out.  But we were happy to just go sit down and see the menu.\\nThis hostess proceeds to glare me down as we go to our table, gossiping about us to her coworker as we sit down, and continues to glare at us for our entire meal.  It was bizarre and uncomfortable.  I had super sweetened my tone speaking with her since it was pretty busy and I had shown up with a larger group.  I literally interacted with her for 2 minutes max.\\nShe got off work at the same time our table was getting up to leave, and she was STILL glaring me down as she walked by my table.  I do not understand what her issue with me was, and it felt like dealing with high school mean girls.  I was pretty shocked because everyone else in Atlanta has been so sweet to us tourists.  The rest of the employees at this place were really nice, but this hostess was absolutely terrible to us.  I would say to just reject our group altogether next time because no one likes to deal with bull over a table, but the food & restaurant atmosphere are too good to skip.  You will definitely have an excellent experience if you don't have to deal with a grumpy host or hostess.  Also, don't walk off even if you're told a one hour wait in what is obviously a crowded restaurant.  You might get surprised with a much shorter wait (yay!), but you will have only 5 minutes to get to the host or hostess to claim your table (not so great if you try to walk to some place else)."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We hadn't had dim sum in a couple of months so when we landed in Boston we decided to go straight to China town and check out the Dim Sum.

Alas - it went out of biz.  Saw the Teppanyaki sign and a banner with \\"Chinese buffet lunch $5.99\\" so went in to try it because it was 2pm - either that or MickeyD's.  They told us the buffet is only for weekdays.  Looked at the menu and saw they offer a Shanghai dimsum brunch!  OK - let's try it.  What a mistake.  We ordered spring rolls, scallion pancake, sweet tofu pudding, Chinese cruller, Peking noodles, and steamed dumplings - all the usual Shanghai dimsum dishes.  The only edible dish was the scallion pancake.  The crullers tasted like they sat there all day - you can hardly bit into them!  The tofu pudding was harder than what it should be, and it was swimming in way too much liquid - also overly gingered.  The dumplings (4) were too doughy (looked not quite cooked through inside), as were the spring rolls (tough, tasteless), and the Peking noodles were overcooked, had a strange sauce with hardly any meat but covered with julienned cucumbers and some kind of nuts!  Euuww - what a waste of money.  I can't say what their Teppanyaki is like, or the quality of their sushi, but I'd say avoid restaurants that try to be \\"all things to all people.\\"  Go to a Japanese restaurant for Japanese food, a Chinese restaurant for Chinese food (cuisine specific too!), etc...

The roll had yellowtail and some other things inside, then avocado and tuna on top.  It was delicious!  But, VERY big pieces.  Hard to fit in my mouth.  Everything else in the box was tasty as well.

UBurger holds it down in Kenmore, 5 Guys has sprouted everywhere in the suburbs, and places like Boston Burger Company in Davis are worthwhile new entries.  \\n\\nSadly, Tasty Burger falls just shy of the upper echelon of burgerdom.  For one, the patty in my burger was a little thicker and drier than I prefer.  I could replicate this burger on a backyard grill, and I'm the kind of guy who prefers his burgers cooked on a griddle, so they stay juicy.  Also, there were a limited number of specialty burgers that one could choose from, and none of them were what I *really* wanted.  UBurger has specialty burgers, but you can also construct your own creation by mixing and matching toppings.  I like that.  \\n\\nThe take-out window is a great option and gives the place a west coast kind of feel, but on a rainy night I had to go inside, and having tip a waitress or bartender added a few dollars to the cost of the meal - at 5 Guys and UBurger you don't have to bother with this.

We find our favorite haunts, and we stay loyal, because Portland isn't always the most conducive city to travel through at meal time. Well, tonight I drove around Southeast Portland on a mission: Find a new place in a neighborhood I wouldn't normally visit, and write a Yelp review about it. \\n\\nMy travels took me to Foster Burger, not because of a particular review or recommendation, but just because I remember hearing about it and seeing the sign, and it sparked my interest. Lucky for Foster Burger I love a greasy burger joint, and I had one more day of Fat Thanksgiving Weekend before cutting back on big fat burgers.\\n\\nFoster Burger surprised me. I figured it would be a takeout spot, but it was definitely more of a sit-down bar type affair. Foster Burger would be a perfect fit in downtown LA, San Francisco, Orange County, or Seattle, maybe more so than in mid-Southeast Portland these days. The walls are plastered with flyers from punk, grunge, hardcore, metal, and alternative shows from the past in the Northwest, some of which I attended, at now defunct clubs such as Satyricon and Meow Meow. Some of the servers have stretched ears and tattoos. I felt right at home.\\n\\nMany of my punk rock friends from back home would give Foster Burger a solid 5 stars, and I can see why. Foster Burger has a great bar with a solid selection of local beers from Burnside, Good Life, and many more, but first and foremost, some of the biggest, sloppiest burgers in town. I just have a more refined palate. That's a snobby way of saying I'm particularly picky about my ingredients. And I like to know where my meat and produce come from. Fortunately for me, there are plenty of chefs and restaurants in Portland who reveal their purveyors.\\n\\nI ordered the barbecue burger, which was slathered in barbecue sauce, red onions, pickles, and crispy bacon, with a big juicy patty on a sesame seed roll. Let me tell you, if I get bummed out on a cold Winter night, and I need a big sloppy burger to cure those blues, this is exactly where I'm going to go. This burger was a giant mess, and it was pretty damned tasty. I will admit, I felt like a ton of bricks when I was done, but if that's what someone is looking for, this is the place to find it. This is an every-once-in-a-while kind of place; If I ate here regularly, I would definitely be hating life.\\n\\nThe black & white truffle fries were awesome, covered in shaved Parmesan cheese and truffle oil. These fries are fresh cut, crispy, and delicious, and the primary reason I will return to Foster Burger. The squid ink aioli which accompanied the fries was okay, but may have been the most hideous color of deep green I've ever seen in a sauce. I overcame the appearance, but honestly I think the fries were good enough with the cheese and the truffle oil. The sauce was unnecessary.\\n\\nMy server was super cool, and made solid suggestions, which I accepted and appreciate very much.\\n\\nFoster Burger isn't in my favorite part of town, and it isn't somewhere I'd go regularly for any other reason than a big, sloppy burger and some crispy salty fries that made my night. No offense to the neighbors, it's just nestled among several \\"adult\\" businesses and strip clubs and surrounded by chain restaurants and used car lots. I'm sure the rent is cheap, and since the burgers are solid, they seem to be doing well. I'll return to Foster Burger some time to try the poutine."},{"name":"Saffron","address":"3616 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The best Naan and curry i had in recent times, felt so happy visiting here the service and hospitality the boys shown was beyond awsome , would like to visit real soon and the best part was the dessert."},{"name":"Tacodeli","address":"4200 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The tacos here can't be beat.

Sure its location is a little odd and parking sucks, but if their ribs are worthy of a last meal on earth, does it really matter? I will say, however, out of all of the times I've been (and that's a lot over the 5 years I was in ATL), I never had trouble finding parking or a seat inside or on the patio. The line can get somewhat long, but they're quick about taking orders.\\n\\nI've tried many items off the menu, but the best is the regular old fashioned ribs. They are grilled to perfection where the meat is unbelievably juicy and tender and you guessed it, falls off the bones! The Fat Matt's sauce has a great vinegar-y zing to it and is so unique on its own. Sometimes I like the choice of multiple sauces at a BBQ restaurant, but it says something when you have 1 amazing sauce rather than 4 okay sauces. The only down side is that additional sauces are 50 cents, and you usually want (need?) it, but it's totally worth the price. The sides are delicious as well--brunswick stew is one of my favorites, but be warned that eating a half rack of ribs + stew might induce a coma. Collards are good too, but a little too salty sometimes. Cole slaw is nice and refreshing with a heavy meal like ribs. \\n\\nI've now had BBQ in almost every southern and urban city I've traveled to and nothing compares to Fat Matt's. You can purchase their sauce in a bottle and when my boyfriend shipped it to us in Madison, the people at the post office said that Fat Matt's BBQ sauce was one of the most frequently shipped items.

A converted gas station-garage turned restaurant, full front patio with tables and chairs. You can tell that this place, before you walk in, has personality. Twin brothers had undiscovered talents which at first grew through love of Texas BBQ. Now not only is Fox Bros just  a BBQ haven, but an ATL staple. \\n\\nI had the 3-meat-headed monster combo of pulled pork, pork ribs and brisket. Accompanied by sides of Mac and cheese, brunswick stew, and jalapeno cornbread. Washed down with some sweet tea. I missed out on the banana pudding, cause frankly there was NO more room in my stomach after that feast.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was quick, friendly and efficient.\\n\\nThe sauces were just right.  They also had Hotlanta hot sauce, Texas tabasco sauce, and some extra BBQ sauce in a squirt bottle on the table to supplement the goodness ordered. \\n\\nThe pulled pork was great. Not over pulled. Not dry in texture, and not covered in sauce. The smoke and rub were done just right.\\n\\nThe ribs were fantastic. Knifing the ribs apart, the meat stayed on. When I bit into it, you need to have bitten half way up the rib to have take all the meat off.  The meat didn't fall off on first contact. Which I'm in the school of if it falls off the bone right away, it wasn't cooked right. There's a certain degree of difficulty in making ribs, and they hit the bullseye in my opinion. Fingers doused in bbq sauce, mouth looking like a 3 year old eating a PBJ sandwich. MMM....so good. \\n\\nThe typical brisket I ordered was subbed out for a \\"special of the day\\" of burnt ends of brisket, smoked extra for about 10 hrs, then covered in bbq sauce. That was done well. The smokey flavor was really evident. \\n\\nBrunswick stew I had'nt heard of it til I read the menu. Am I glad I ordered it!  I couldn;t get over the smoke flavor in the stew. It was like a bbq soup, and thats not to sound off-putting, it was fantastic. I killed the sh*t outta that bowl.\\n\\nMac and cheese. They used small shelled pasta. Not sure what kind of cheeses they used other than cheddar, but was not salty, gooey, and done really well. \\n\\nJalapeno cornbread portion was huge. Specks of corn and jalapeno throughout. Served warm, with a tablespoon of sweet cream butter on the side.Crunchy outside, soft inside, it crumbles when you take a fork full but its cornbread, not cake.The kick of jalapeno is outstanding.\\n\\nWhen the waiter brought out my food, which took all of maybe 6-7 minutes (that place is a well-oiled machine), he asked if I was sharing the meal. I was like nope, its all me. He chuckled and said there ya go enjoy. I know he wasn't laughing at me, but at that point I was determined to finish on the premises. To my dismay, I'm shocked I finished the whole meal. I was honestly struggling with the last few morsels but I got it all down.\\n\\nTotal for all that plus about 3 glasses of sweet tea was about 26 bucks w/o tip. \\n\\nThis place knows its barbecue. Patrons know good BBQ when they eat it.  I'm confident to say that you could have gone in any direction in your selection on that menu and not made a bad move. 300+ reviewers know what the hell they;re talking about. I'm one of them.

The breading is perfectly seasoned and the mashed potatoes are killer.  I could eat the potatoes by themselves but the gravy is also delicious.

(1 hour round trip drive, 4 hours waiting to open, then 1 hour to order and eat).  I've tried over two dozen 'great' BBQ joints in Texas (those in Lockhart, Elgin, Taylor, Dallas, and Austin) and Franklin is amongst the top three for me. But, the margin of difference of those top three, for me, doesn't justify spending six hours vs. two hours to enjoy barbecue. I might try the online ordering if I want to plan weeks ahead I guess...\\n\\nAfter living in Austin for seven years, I finally decided to bite the bullet and get in line for the 4+ hour wait. I wrangled two BBQ-loving friends to join me, so I wasn't a loner in line, and amazingly, we were all Franklin virgins. The morning crowd was fun - a couple of regulars, but mostly noobs like us. We sat in the folding chairs, talked, and waited it out. Once the doors were open, we stood up and waited again to get to the counter. Finally, when I arrived at the counter, I decided to order a bit of everything. Hey, if I'm spending this much time here, I might as well see what the big fuss is about! So, after a pound each of Brisket, Turkey, Ribs, Pork, and some beans, cole slaw, potato salad, and pies to wash down the grease, I found myself in a food coma. I think it took three days to get over it.\\n\\nAll in all, my Franklin adventure was just that - an adventure in the game of hurry up and wait.

Nice gesture, but honestly it just would've been better to offer an appetizer on the house so we could pick which one.

The owner or manager there was very very very attentive. He made sure we weren't sitting in the glare of the sun and that we were comfortable and happy the entire meal. He was great!\\n\\nWe ordered a chai tea, chicken choila, the Saffron mixed tandoori grill, lamb pasanda, and garlic naan.\\n\\nChicken choila: We wanted to try something labelled as Nepalese on their menu. This was really interesting. The flavors reminded me a little of wasabi and it was unique with chicken. I don't know if I would get it again but I was definitely glad to have tried it.\\n\\nMixed tandoori grill: Came with paneer, a lamb chop, chicken, shrimp, and salmon. Everything was great. The Indian spices and the delicious smokey flavor came through. The paneer was so fresh.\\n\\nLamb Pasanda: You HAVE to get this. It was great. Some of the best flavor I've ever had.\\n\\nGarlic Naan: I'd skip this. It was a little too chewy and the garlic flavor wasn't very well distributed. It was more like a pita bread instead of traditional naan.\\n\\nOverall, I'd recommend going here. The price is pretty normal for Indian food (more than you want to pay for a dinner you'd eat every night but not too expensive for an indulgence). You'll definitely indulge your palette with this restaurant."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best fried chicken in portland.

Pack some patience because the journey to getting some of Fat Matt's legendary barbecue starts in the long line outside the restaurant's front door.  It moves along fairly well but I was told by several of the regulars that there's always a line to heaven and not a stairway, in this case.  Some of you won't get that reference so moving right along.  This joint here is a no frills barbecue slinging from the counter original from 1990.  From the number of little brown bags leaving the restaurant, most of the people were ordering takeaway.  If you choose to eat in, it's going to be cozy dining.  No kidding, there's room for about 40 people inside of the shack and it's tight.  If you like meeting and eating with new people, sit down for a spell and get to it but you will literally be elbow to elbow with whoever sits next to you.  \\n\\nIt was my first time at Fat Matt's and I was only there to hear my friend's band and had never heard of it, up to this point.   It was too late for me to eat but from the number of carry outs, bone-sucking and finger-licking I observed, I'm guessing the food is everything \\"they\\" say it is -  ridiculously delicious.  I was standing in line with one guy who said he came straight from the airport to get some Fat Matt's...wow!  I'll have to go back a different day to give you my personal view of the food but if you like live blues bands and some down home barbecue and mama's secret recipes for savory side, give Fatt Matt's a try.  \\n\\nNo frills counter service beer & bbq joint with nightly live blues music since 1990.

I swear, it has been so long since I ate a fried chicken that moist. If you come here, please just get this. You get 3 huge pieces of chicken and one big waffle. Although the chicken isn't the crispiest, it is tender and the waffle is perfectly cooked. It's huge, so you could def. share. \\n\\nBananas Foster French Toast ($7.95 for 1/2 order) - If you have a sweet tooth, this baby is gonna satisfy you to the moon and back. This dish needs to be eaten right when you get it, since it is smothered in banana, cinnamon, and syrup.. so your french toast could get soggy. We liked this dish, but thank goodness we ordered the 1/2 cause if we ordered the full, it probably would have been too much of a sweetness overload. \\n\\nPraline Bacon ($4.75) - Their signature! Three huge slices of bacon covered in praline. Man is this delicious. It is the perfect blend of sweet & salty. So if you are a fan of that combo, definitely get this. We couldn't finish this either because there was so much food. \\n\\nOverall, I would come back to Screen Door. The food was delicious, ambiance was great, and our service was stellar.

We were literally the only people there. My friend asked them to turn down the music and the bartender said 'y'all are sitting right by the speaker' and didn't do anything. When I went up for a drink (god forbid they try come check on the only table of people they had) I assed them to turn it down. So I crap u not, he turned it down and then as I turned to walk back to my seat turned it back up to where it was louder than before. \\n\\nAnother time more recently, my wife, her two brothers, and my new car seated, sleeping baby walked in on a Tuesday at about 6pm. Again place is dead, there were 4 other people there. We mostly just wanted to show off the place to her brothers from out of town. The bartender immediately said the don't allow infants because 'it doesn't work' and kicked us out. He didn't say he was sorry for the inconvenience ...just pointed to the door, since it's so hard to find for us parental types.\\n\\nLook I get it, someone came in with their kid and made a scene and ruined it for everyone.

It's a Harvard Square institution, and almost always busy, even at off-peak times; probably 50-60% of the time, I've had to wait at least a few minutes, but they're good about turning tables, and usually, the wait is shorter than expected.\\n\\nThe food is great if you like hot, heavy, lots of cheese, et cetera. Don't come here on a diet if you can avoid it; while they do have lighter options, all the smells of the quesadillas and burros might bum you out. I usually order one or the other of those two, but always take home at least half, as the portions are generous.The queso dip is also excellent, and I've heard good things about the burgers. Also, they make the chips, so they come out nice and hot, and keep coming unless you tell them you don't want any more.\\n\\nDrinks are cheap and you get unlimited free refills on soda. I really like their ginger ale; there's something about it that's nice and refreshing.\\n\\nThe service has almost always been great. The staff is very quick and efficient, and they've always been happy to accommodate any request. They're especially good at anticipating when you'll want more chips and salsa or a refill on your drink.\\n\\nThe only downside is that if you get seated upstairs, things can get noisy. There's already music playing at a fairly high volume, and if the bar fills up, it gets even louder. A few times, my friends and I have had to resort to yelling or texting each other at the table. I'd recommend asking to be seated downstairs if you want a better chance of hearing each other.\\n\\nOverall, the food is good, drinks are good, service is good, location is good, there's lots of seating, and the prices are definitely good.

Everyone around us were also complaining.\\n\\nA restaurant of this size needed a handful of chefs/line cooks in my opinion. Rather than the waitress apologizing to us, it should have been the owner or manager visiting us. We felt so bad for the waitress. Most waitresses would probably quit under these conditions.

Order around being able to include it into your meal - though I'm sure you'll enjoy anything you order here. (A friend from Vancouver responded to our Facebook check-in with \\"How did YOU know about Paul's?! You can't put that on Facebook when I'm trapped in Ontario - that's just mean!\\")\\n\\nWe went to Paul's Omelettery when we woke up on Eastern Standard Time and walked to Granville Island only to find out that it wasn't open yet. I checked Yelp for the best breakfast restaurant within walking distance and we ended up here. Wow, what a treat - this place was great - and we even beat the line because we were there so early, but if you go after, say 9:00am on a weekend it looked like you should probably expect to wait. \\n\\nFirst, I la-la-love the half an eggs benedict as a menu item. It's so good that I wish I could eat both halves, but since we were planning to walk around all day I didn't need the heavy feeling of being overfull when we left - it was just the right amount of food.\\n\\nAt first I was a little concerned about the substitution of cheddar sauce for Hollandaise sauce (even though I am almost always disappointed by restaurant Hollandaise - cheddar with seafood?) but there is a really excellent hot sauce (citrussy, garlicky and just the right amount of heat) on the table that, as far as I can tell, is made by some hippy who lives in the mountains outside of Vancouver and drives a vanfull of the stuff down when he finishes a batch. We wanted to buy some but they didn't have any available in jars at the time. This hot sauce goes very, very well with the cheddar sauce and I highly recommend it.\\n\\nThe coffee was good and filled promptly by our attentive and friendly server. \\n\\nI had a half (small) seafood eggs benny, which was just delightful once I found the hot sauce (the combination of the cheddar sauce solo with cold sandwich shrimp and smoked salmon was a little much for me) with really delicious potatoes on the side. \\n\\nHe had The Devon omelette. He doesn't like asparagus but they happily agreed to substitute spinach, which was quite delicious (though in my opinion it would have been better with the asparagus.) The hot sauce was also good with this, since I'm sure you were wondering.\\n\\nAlso a final word in defence of the cheddar sauce - it really is good cheddar. With bacon or ham it would be fine. I was mostly concerned with the combination with seafood.\\n\\nWhen we vsiit Vancouver again, we'll definitely come back here for breakfast and would happily recommend it to anyone looking for a place to try."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here last night for Restaurant Week with two of my friends.

We were seated at the bar since you can opt in on the list to reduce wait time.  If you wanted to sit outside, there was no wait.

We had our own bartender there to take care of us.  Even though we didn't have drinks, he kept our waters topped off and checked to make sure our food was good.  We ordered their renown fried chicken and the screen door plate with mac n cheese, catfish and beet salad (local seasonal selection).  We knew the chicken would take awhile but watching the bartenders mix the drinks and our neighbors eating their fried chicken passed the time.  They even have a bunch of articles and reviews on the wall next to the restroom to read while you wait for the restroom or for your food.  The food was delicious.  The chicken was hot, light, crispy and boneless.  The mash and gravy had a nice kick to it.  The mac n cheese was not too greasy and light for a mac.  I liked that they topped the bowl with melted cheddar.  The catfish was very tender and flaky and had no fishy taste.  the cornbread was a little dry but if you pair it with the honey butter, it didn't matter.  The $14 for the screen door plate and the $15 for the chicken was a good price and we had left overs.  The great food, nice ambiance, great service and good prices warrant them a 5 star rating.

How dare they did that!\\n\\nOur guests were coming and my family did not want to cancel the dinner just because of dirty cups.

This mecca of meat deserves it's reputation as the place to go for brisket in Austin, if not in Texas (and if you've found the best brisket in Texas, you've found the best brisket period). \\n\\nAs a data point for your visit; we got in line at 10:30 on a random Thursday and the Last Man Standing (last person with guaranteed meat) was about four people behind us.  We ate just before two o'clock, and they ultimately were able to serve folks after the Last Man Standing, but it's a bit of a dice roll. The line apparently did start to form about 9:00, even on a weekday.\\n\\nFWIW: aside from the best brisket I've had in Texas (ridiculously perfectly cooked, I've never seen any meat cooked as perfectly), the ribs were perfectly cooked with a bit of chew but falling off the bone (I liked the basic black pepper rub, but my wife preferred the light sugar-and-tomato glaze at Smitty's).  The sausage was good, but I'm just not a connoisseur of Texas sausage, so I didn't end up with a clear preference between Franklin, Smitty's, or Kreuz.

It's been a mainstay for grabbing a good beer and patio sitting, a familiar spot where I know what kind of service and food I'm getting into. But last night, Cypress did a little extra to capture my attention, like a long time lover foregoing yoga pants and surprising you with something lace. \\n\\nIt was cold, work was long, and my girlfriend and I made the three block trek without any particular food cravings. I'd probably get a burger. Oh, but how silly of me.

There, underneath a bold and underlined 'Tuesday' I read the words \\"Roasted Chicken and Dumplings.\\"\\n\\nI don't make it a habit of ordering such a dish because no one makes a dumpling like my Grandmere did, and more often than not, they were a disgrace to the word. You see, hers were oversized, creamy and soft on the outside with a little crunch before getting to a biscuit center. Not many kitchens can replicate such a delicacy, so I didn't get excited, yet. \\n\\nI consulted the man sitting next to me, who confirmed that this was, indeed, just the kind of dumpling that came with the entree. I then confirmed with my server that it was mostly chunky, white meat. I became hopeful and decided I had to try it. \\n\\nWhen the dish arrived, I was overjoyed by the amount of sauce to dumpling ratio. Each dumpling was like a savory pillow, and I tried my hardest not to eat them in one bite portions. The sauce was thick, but not too thick. I devoured what I could and began dipping my girlfriend's fries in to sop up the remaining sauce. I had to request a spoon to finish, with a mild threat of resorting to a straw, or worse, licking the bowl in front of other patrons. \\n\\nI hope that this becomes a regular dish, even if just for the rest of the winter.

This would normally be a turn off but I figured people must be willing to wait for a reason so I stood and waited my turn. Once I got close to the front I was offered a taste of brisket while I waited and it told the story of why people were willing to wait so long. Moist, cooked just right medium, and seasoned just right. I couldn't wait to get a full portion. Once it was my turn at the front I met two of the friendliest guys one could encounter. I ordered the two meat plate choosing brisket and pork ribs with potato salad and baked beans. I was asked how I liked my brisket and when I asked for moist they pulled out a fresh fatty brisket and took their time to cut it up for me. No wonder the line moves so slowly. Sometimes good service takes time. \\n\\nOnce I sat down at one of their many covered picnic tables I dove into my meal. The brisket is honestly the best I've ever had and I have taken many a trip to BBQ joints all over Texas. Even a friend I was with who competes in LoneStar BBQ Society agreed it was good stuff. Once I got to my ribs I was disappointed at first as the outside was almost too crispy. I came to find that it was just hiding the most moist falling off the bone ribs one could ask for.

This reviewer, being of humble means himself, recommends that you order from the menu, as the cost of multiple toppings is prodigious."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'll give this place a three because the bartenders are full of themselves. They added drinks to my tab and I was unhappy so I did not tip. The bartender approached me outside the bar and said do not come back because I did not tip. I told him you guys charged me $62 for 3 drinks, so yea I'm not tipping you. Really weird how they did not keep track of my tab appropriately. Need to get better help behind the bar for me to like this place. I have been here for lunch before and enjoyed my experience, but the night staff is not friendly in the slightest."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Meat in a cone? Well it was OK, nothing great. I enjoyed my cone but it really wasn't all that filling considering the price. The chicken was more enjoyable than the shrimp variant, and the sauce was pretty good. However after the meal... I had to get a taco at Torchy's too. Now I may have a stomach the the size of beach ball, but two cones couldn't come close to taming my hunger."},{"name":"The Wild Horse Cafe","address":"392 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"The food has always been great here, but they have really weird rules about the bar and restaurant. \\n\\nThe nachos, which are ridiculously delicious- *the best I've ever had in a restaurant*- can only be served on the bar side. The bar side fills up quickly so you could be standing for quite a long time for nachos. In spite of their ridiculous goodness, it doesn't really inspire me to return and jam myself into the bar for them. It's not a huge place, so you think they could share menus, but it's a hard and fast rule. \\n\\nBrings me to my next point, b/c the bar is so small and packed the music is on the restaurant side and can get quite loud. Think about it: You can choose between having a nice meal w/friends, yet the conversation will get drowned out by the music. Or eat on the pub side, but get a pub menu which won't include yummy treats like cream of mushroom soup w/truffle oil. \\n\\nThen there are the hours.  No lunch on the weekends?  No food served until 5 any day of the week?  Limiting and disappointing.\\n\\nI just don't get it.  I've liked the food, service has been okay, but the layout and the rules that come along w/it keeps me away.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n1. share the menu across both sides of the house;\\n2. change the layout so the loud music stays on the pub side.\\n3. Open for lunch on the weekends.\\n\\nThen I'll be back."},{"name":"Bandini Pizza & Pasta","address":"3107 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"If you charged less for what you produce I would not be so harsh. You guys are just wrong on so many levels. I was really not happy with what I ordered. BANDINI YOU HAVE A CONSTANCY PROBLEM AND A QUALITY ISSUE. \\n\\n I have eaten you pizza and it was okay. Three stars anyway. Calzone was just not that good. Zero ricotta cheese and little mozzarella which was in stark contrast to what I received last time. Sausage taste mass produced and probably came from a lower quality distributor. Lasagna was just bad. Inauthentic Slop really. Homemade meat sauce ??? Really guys. tasted bland and of really cheap ingredients. I threw it out after one bite and did the same with my calzone. Watery and slapped together by someone who doesn't care. Bottom line is: I think Bandini is all about that.., the bottom line.  We Portlanders can tell cheap food for profit and when profit is your priority, your days are numbered. You better check yourselves guys and remind yourselves why you are in the pizza game in what is arguably the most competitive food market in the country. Good luck with your current business model."},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"We came on a Monday night for a drink and then decided to have a bite to eat. \\n\\nThis restaurant is located off Monroe behind the Trader Joe's, next to the cinema. It has an outside deck and tables. Plenty of parking but it does get crowded. \\n\\nWe sat in the back room on a sofa. We ordered a couple of drinks and I ordered an appetizer Hummus and pita, my partner ordered a Turkey sandwich. \\n\\nThe Hummus was nothing special, served with some standard pita, carrots and celery, did not taste homemade. The turkey sandwich apparently was nothing special but was better than my appetizer. The waitress was prompt and friendly. \\n\\nNice place to grab a drink, cool decor and vibe, we might return to try it again, but the food is not what you come for."}]`),z={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},H={key:1};function R(s,e,n,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",O,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,D)):w("",!0)])}const L=c(z,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-77e520e7"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/67.md","filePath":"glossary/67.md"}'),q={name:"glossary/67.md"},V=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(L)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
