On the one day of the year when apparently all the Magnolias and Kerbeys were closed simultaneously, this Denny's seemed a little less creepy than the nearest IHop at one in the morning, so we came here. I wasn't sure if the four cop cars in the parking lot were a good or bad sign.\\n\\nThe closest thing I could find for my late night preference of vegan/veggie fare that wasn't a salad or a Sysco veggie burger was the \\"Slim-Fit Plate\\" - an egg white/spinach/grape tomato scramble that came with two strips of turkey bacon and an English muffin. It was okay. It occurs to me I could have also taken advantage of the Denny's Senior specials if I had wanted to, but I did bring my teeth with me.\\n\\nOur waitress appeared to be a young mother who probably wished she was at home and not here, and I'm not going to be snarky about her over that.

Why is that? Because your experience can be fro 1 to 5 stars, depending on the time, day, the reason you are there, your server, your server's mood, and so on.  I have a 20 year history here, like many people.  In the early days, we'd walk up there, our server Devon would see us coming and have drinks ready when we got to the door and if we couldn't fight the crowds, or she had already left, we'd go back and pay our bill the next day (it would be on the bulletin board).  Today, still living in the same hood (from apt to house just down from Jim the owner) I am occasional lunch person (maybe once a month) - not the creepy middle aged regular who parks the expensive car out front.  If you go with friends just to stand and drink, or to relax early in the week, you are good any time. Have friends or family in town on a Spring Sunday afternoon and want to treat them to a nice lunch -- good luck.  Party of four dining on a weekend night?

I've gone several times and each time I've been frustrated in some way. The first time, they'd just opened, so I understand there are some bumps in the road. Our server was very pleasant but brought out one flat, gross drink (sent it back) and another order completely wrong. But my friend was gracious and had it anyways. The pulled pork sliders were oily and not super warm but not awful. The fries were AMAZING - our server really shined when she was talking about how they were prepared. Again, personality wise, our server was pleasant! Then my chowder came out...stone cold. Sent it back to be reheated. My friend's pizza came out wrong. The manager gave us an appetizer we didn't order, and when we explained it wasn't ours, he seemed frustrated and confused and said we could just have it. Everyone seemed stressed, flustered, and like they didn't know what was going on. Second time I went, I sat at the bar and wasn't greeted for a few minutes, even though it wasn't busy. The bartender was a little distracted, and seemed shocked when my friend ordered a coffee and said they'd have to brew up a pot, in a way that made us feel like we were troubling her. Then they came to us and said they'd messed up the first pot so they needed to make MORE. It's a simple cup of coffee! Drinks came out after a small wait, but not bad. Couldn't catch her eye later so had to place a food order with another bartender who seemed confused. Later she asked us if we'd already gotten our food, and we had to explain we were still waiting... finally it came out and while it was good, the fried dough was in pizza slices, not \\"bites\\" as it was described on the menu. There was also some confusion about our check at the end. Considering how long we waited for everything and how the bartenders were not attentive, and the lackluster food, an the fact that when my friends have gone without me and had frustrating experiences as well leads me to say that brick and beam is a disappointing experience.

It's worth it.\\n\\nI knew the food would be good because of how our server talked it up; we could tell she (and the other servers) had a real enthusiasm for the dishes Canoe serves. For an appetizer, we had the smoked salmon on a crispy potato cake with Vermont goat's cheese -- totally mouth-watering. Next, I had the Lamb Bolognese, which was a pretty hefty portion, but it was so delicious I was glad to finish it off. Mom had the Pan Seared Arctic Char, which was a really attractive and yummy dish as well. Our favorites, though, were the desserts. Mom opted for the Banana Nut Bread Pudding (swoon-worthy), and I had the Vanilla Bean Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e (AMAZING taste).\\n\\nBetween dishes, our waitress tended to us before we even thought to ask for anything, which I've always thought is the sign of a really excellent server.

After Ken, our waiter, arrived and talked to us about the menu did we decide that it was far too noisy at this spot and requested to move to a quieter spot. This was taken care of with no issue at all as we got moved to the other side of the upper dining room - a far quieter location for this special occasion. \\n\\nI ordered the duck pastrami as an appetizer, the rabbit as an entree, and the popcorn ice cream sundae as dessert. My girlfriend ordered the smoke salmon as an appetizer, the lamb shank as an entree, and a special pineapple, curry sorbet as a dessert. \\n\\nThe duck pastrami was pretty good but ultimately not too my liking (too vinegary/salty). I don't blame the dish as I probably should have got a salad or the salmon instead. My girlfriend's smoke salmon on the potato cake was mouth-watering and basically melted in your mouth like butter.  \\n\\nThe rabbit was absolutely, mindblowingly ridiculous in terms of taste and quality. The bacon ravioli underneath the rabbit only added to the awesomeness of the dish. I was literally trying to use my fork to somehow scrape up all the juices on my plate when I ran out. My girlfriends lamb was also very good but I preferred the rabbit still. \\n\\nThe popcorn ice cream sundae was incredibly unique and very tasty. It literally tasted like cracker jack popcorn and was pretty massive. My girlfriends sorbet was also very delicious and fresh tasting. \\n\\nFinally, I would also like to mention that during our dining experience, my girlfriend stated in passing that it was our anniversary and that we had tried the chocolate grotto last time.

But the review is for Buckhead Restaurant Week (BRW 4.16-23 2016) only. \\nI would give the service 4 stars and the BRW menu 5 stars.\\nIt's a $35 per person Prix Fixe menu. We had a group of 3. \\n\\nHere we start:\\nI. Starters:\\nA. Salmon Tartare, 9 out of10. I bet they borrowed the idea of sashimi, the salmon is so good, we like the Baguette Croutons as well;\\nB. Crispy Crab Beignets, 9/10. It's a lovely mini version of crab cake, try it!\\nC. Roasted Mushroom al a Creme, 7/10. Basically a small plate of pasta, a bit bland when compared with other two.\\n\\nII. Entree\\nA. Pan Roasted Haddock, 10/10!! I looked into dictionary to find haddock is one type of cod. It turns out the best dish tonight! Perfectly cooked fish with tones of flavor from tomato confit and chervil ravigote, all of us love it so much!\\nB. Hanger Steak, 9/10. The steak is well-done/crispy outside, medium-rare 80% inner part, juicy, pink and tender. Nice done!\\nC. Slow Cooked Berkshire Pork, 6/10. The only dish we didn't finish the night, maybe our group is Asian, so we are kinda picky on the pork cuisine...\\n\\nIII. Dessert\\nA. Mocha Pot de Creme, 10/10!! Another perfect dish the night. Again, Asians are a bit crazy about mocha stuff, the mocha powder they choose here is a bit different than others, since the dessert is kind yellow-green ish, I guess it contains a good amount of egg yolk and cream  which balanced the dark green. I found some hint of black tea grounds at the bottom of the pot when finishing it. Very intriguing, I wish had a \\"to go\\" box of it;\\nB. Creme Brulee, 8/10. It's a standard Brulee, after the mocha pot, I guess we can't get surprised by any other sweets';\\nC. Chocolate Mousse, 6/10. Actually a bit disappointed, since it is basically a chocolate cake topping...with a few raspberries and small chunks of dark chocolate in it... we didn't finish this one.\\n\\nI checked their regular menu, feel soooooooo sorry that the perfect dishes tonight we all love, the Haddock and Mocha Pot are not on it =( I would def come back alone just for these two bad boys!\\n\\nAgain, Bistro Niko is an elegant fine dinning place and it's quite busy!

When it was announced it was going to be a restaurant, we made reservations as soon as we could for the first week it was opened.  Since it was brand new, there were obviously a few kinks but overall our experince was very positive and the food was delicious.  \\n\\nThe host was a little curt on our way in but friendly as we left, asking if we enjoyed everything.  We were a party of four and two of us arrived first and were seated.  A waitress came over to fill all the water glasses and the host reprimanded her slightly when she started to fill the glasses of the couple we were waiting on.  This was awkward because we heard him and she gave us a sorry smile as she walked away.. \\n\\nService was hit or miss but I assume they'll sort that out with time.  \\n\\nNow for the food!  We started with a few apps - biscuits, deviled eggs, hushpuppies and sweet potato hoe cakes.  The biscuits were very good, large - we shared two between four of us.  I didn't try the deviled eggs but my friends loved them.  The hoe cakes are basically pancakes with sweet potato mixed into the batter.  They were good, a little too heavy or sweet for me though but my friend loved them.  The hushpuppies were my favorite.  It's a big order and the butter with honey is SO yummy on them!  For dinner we shared the fried chicken, pulled pork, shrimp and grits and mac and cheese.  The chicken was flavorful and crisp but it wasn't the best I've ever had, same with the pulled pork.  Shrimp and grits were better - lots of flavor.  The Mac and Cheese was my favorite.  It's creamy and cheesy!  I didn't really taste pimento but that was okay for me.  For dessert, we tried the pecan pie - delicious - and an ice cream sandwich.  There is no description of the ice cream sandwich on the menu but we just assumed it would be standard.  Their ice cream sandwich was a tiny scoop of sweet cream on one of their biscuits.  It's a cute idea to fit the theme but we didn't like it at all.  They should specify biscuit ice cream sandwich.  \\n\\nThe decor and ambiance alone are enough to go in for even just a drink.  It's a great space - there are stand-around tables near the bar for drinks and apps.  They are fairly close in proximity to the dining areas but it doesn't feel too crowded at all.

Yummy and meaty but still just snails - though what can you really do with snails.  I liked the spinach in the mix; it was done nicely and still had some crunch.\\n\\nNext was a salad.  Although this was included in the entree deal, the salad seemed to be full size.  I couldn't eat it all.  I agree with some of the other critiques about the salads being a bit overdressed/watery but it wasn't a distraction.  I had the asian caesar, which was like it sounds - half asian and half caesar.  The chow mein noodles were a great addition.\\n\\nEveryone in my party was sold by the waiter on the melange of fish - three fillets each with its own sauce.  This was the highlight of the meal.  Each sauce was distinct from the other but complementary at the same time.  There were garlic mashed potatoes served with it but they were so simple they almost tasted bland when compared with the fish.  Something with more texture and stronger flavor would be a great substitute.\\n\\nDessert was an Amaretto cake.  The taste was good, but the edges were a bit spongy as if it had been left to sit out too long - or was past its prime.  It needed something more like an ice cream or sauce.

We were in Reading for an event and made the unfortunate mistake of stopping here for a quick appetizer..  We sat at the bar, and after about ten minutes, a very nasty and miserable bartender named Molly came over to grace us with service.  We  asked her what appetizer would be relatively quick and she said all but one and then left and did  not return for over 20 minutes.  We did everything trying to gain her attention, as she stood at a random spot  socializing with another bartender.  Finally, after a 20 plus minute wait she returned,  and at this point I told her it was too late and we decided to not order food. .  She then purposefully tried to instigate  a fight with us, putting he hands to her chest and loudly stating, \\"what did you say\\" over and over...She continued on this rant, repeating over and over, \\"what did you say?\\"  She was clearly trying to instigate a fight, and we refused to go there, and requested the bill.  Molly then started threatening us, and we knew now where this was going, so we told her again to get our check...She then left and threw the paper bill at us.  The whole thing was mind boggling...The owner Zeke came over to take our credit card for the 2 drinks and said nothing.

Perfect looking Irish pub and it sets you up to feel like you are going to have a good time. Big bar in the front middle, and generous seating all around.   \\n\\nWe weren't highly impressed except with how many people we knew!  We are easy to please usually, if the food and the service are spot on, we're happy.  We ordered a glass of Sauv Blanc, a seasonal beer, calamari app, fish n chips and a burger, and a piece of choc cake.  The waiter was so out of his realm, he seemed just not with it from the start.  He neglected to give us silverware, had to ask some person walking by for it after we got our apps and picked at them with our fingers for like 10 min. No one was around to get them...  No napkins either.  Ok fine, I know it was sort of busy, but to forget the essentials?  Whatever.\\n\\nOk the calamari, which is my gauge on what the place will be like, were mediocre, in taste, but they were greasy for my taste.\\n  \\nFish n Chips were actually very nice, not greasy, very fresh and the fries were delicious.  The burger, which I forget the type he got, looked good and he ate the whole thing and said it was good.  e got sweet potato fries and they were nice.  We got two rounds of drinks, which took a lil while, but the bar was very busy so we excused it.  So while waiting we thought to get and split a dessert.  BIG MISTAKE. OMG I have never eaten a worse piece of cake in my life.  We ordered the choc cake, forget the name, and the waiter told us that it was his favorite and a favorite of his sister..so it's gatta be gud right?  NOPE.  It was almost like it was stale and old, the cake wasn't soft, the frosting was strange and it just didnt sit with us well.\\n\\nWe did leave there that night saying we'd go back to try other things and on a night that isn't so busy.  The fish n chips were real nice, which is my favorite pub food to order.  :)  \\n\\nAlso, if you are from Reading, married to someone from Reading, know people from Reading -ESPECIALLY if you went to Reading High in the last oh I'll say 25 yrs or so- this is where you want to be apparently to have a reunion on a whim.

I'm slightly confused by the 3-star rating.  They're generally pretty good and the fact that they serve actual Japanese food is a big deal.  Beyond just sushi and the normal deal restaurants try to pass off, Shiki serves food like chawanmushi (steamed egg custard with accoutrements), yakiniku, grilled fish (esp yellowtail collar which I love), ikameshi, etc.  They serve conventional classics such as nabe udon, teriyaki, and tempura so even if you don't know about the other great Japanese foods, you can always stick with what you know and love.  Their takoyaki is pretty damn good too!  Normally I never order that because all the restaurants around here probably defrost frozen copies that are generally tasteless and gross but it's nice on the inside and has a slight crispy delicious texture on the outside!\\n\\nEverything is tapas style so you can share -- order a few dishes, and enjoy sake with a few friends!

Definitely worth more than $8! \\n\\nThe red-velvet cake (Blushing Buttermilk) was moist and had one of the best cream cheese frostings I've ever tasted. The Pure Joy was nice and flavorful without being too sweet. The cherries in the crumb were both tart and sweet, a great combination. And the Orange Sherbet was by far a favorite of our group. While the cake itself was very dense, the frosting and filling were a distinct sherbet flavor. We couldn't get enough! Also ordered a vanilla milkshake, was pleasantly surprised to find it tasted of real vanilla. It even had little bits of vanilla at the bottom. \\n\\nThe servers were all very friendly and helpful.

No big deal, but when we finally caught our bartender's attention we were half done with our sandwich.

The focaccia was unbelievably moist and I could have eaten loaves on loaves of it. My mother had the apple and date salad with chicken and I had the harvest salad with chicken. Both delicious, although mine was a little overdressed for my taste so next time I would get it on the side. However, the apple date salad was dressed really nicely with a very light ginger vinaigrette and a smear of apple butter on the plate as well, which was a really nice touch. Later on we both ordered gelato to have in our hotel room which was super yummy, but the same bartender from earlier didn't give my mom any spoons ... Maybe he was just having a bad day. Regardless, we will probably be back again when we stay at the revere."},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My favorite place in Austin for soups/sandwiches.

Overall this place always seems to have a special going on, even on Saturdays which is cool beans, and the beer is always pretty darn good.  They'll even let you sample it if you're not sure.  \\n\\nI finally tried the food this past weekend - got the Salmon Wrap which came with chips and salsa.  Everything tasted great and the quality was superb, I just wish there was more salmon in my wrap.  My friend ordered the queso + chips which came out cold - but our waitress was cool and took it back w/o an issue and nuked it, plus the manager brought us extra chips for the trouble.  I'd say that's pretty good customer service for a bar / pub as you rarely get a proactive response.  \\n\\nPlenty of seating inside and out, right in the middle of the triangle, always a crowd, great selection of beers, and even specials on the weekends.

My favorite part was the red snapper and the vanilla flan. Red snapper was a little crispy on the outside and tender on the inside therefore created great texture clashes. Flan was very rich but not overly sweet. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and we also received an unexpected rose even though both us are not moms.

The crew are very nice and the executive sushi chef interacts with his immediate customers at the sushi bar. They have been open for only 4 months and was very busy on a Tuesday night. Although the fish was pretty fresh the sushi was very average with tight portion control, i.e. super thin fish slices and small protions. The miso was also average and tasted like regular miso paste from a Japanese grocery store. The best part of my meal was the Goshinamuri sashimi plate.

Later on it was on BuyWithMe, so I bought a couple and made a reservation for Friday night with the bf.\\n\\nI was surprised that it wasn't more crowded since the reviews looked good and the place is beautiful. So we get seated by a teenager wearing bright green pants..weird but ok. While the bf is in the restroom a guy comes over and fills my water without saying a word, so I assume he's the busboy. A few seconds later he comes back and asks if I want a drink without introducing himself at all, in a very quiet, completely monotone voice. Apparently he is our waiter. I ask about the house-infused vodka. There are 4 flavors, but according to the waiter all but the blueberry are completely bland...ok I guess I'll go with that one. It was delicious, but I'm still wondering about the others.\\n\\nThe special of the night is surf & turf, which includes a  filet mignon (8 oz I believe), a lobster tail, and 2 sides. It's $40, but we have coups so I order it, already salivating. BF asks about the pasta dishes. Again the waiter suggests one or two, the rest are bland. I'm beginning to see a pattern here.\\n\\n Sidenote, the waiter should seriously consider a different profession. He did not smile once and I swear the looks he gave me made me think he was going to find us and kill us if we didn't tip him enough. \\n\\nOur food comes and I am seriously dissapointed already. The surf&turf special is thrown together. It's all mixed together onto a plate that is clearly too small. The lobster tail is the smallest I have EVER seen and completely dry. The sauteed spinach is barely cooked and has no flavor. I ordered my steak medium rare. I cut into it and it immediately starts bleeding all over my plate. Eventually the waiter comes over and notices the dead animal on my plate from a distance, without me saying a word. He apologizes and asks if I'd like something else. At this point I had already filled up on fries, pasta, etc so I kindly told him I was all set. \\n\\nThis is where 1 star became 4. He immediately went over to the manager. I'm assuming he told her that if she didn't comp our entire meal he was going to kill her too because she shyly came over and apologized as well. After making sure I didn't want a replacement she said she would take the meal off of our check. I assumed this meant my entree. That would have been enough for me, but after several more death stares the waiter came back over and told us to have a good night. We ended up with at least an $80 meal for FREE. We tipped him on the full cost, minus terrible attitude, and went home with a full wallet."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic happy hour w/the 1/2 price appetizers, and the food is really good... got me eating out of my comfort zone... foods that I typically wouldn't have or rarely would eat... and quite often at that..."},{"name":"Treehouse Restaurant and Pub","address":"7 Kings Cir NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The Treehouse is a great place if you want to sit and hang out before your meal.

It didn't knock my socks off - it's nothing like, say, Lemongrass Thai - but it was good, solid Thai food.

The only part I didn't like was my Thai Iced Tea, as it was overly sweetened to the point of being sickly. \\n\\nSo okay, the food is a solid 3.5 stars \\n\\nBut the service? I mean, it was nearly laughable in its terribleness. \\n\\nI've perused through the recent reviews, and it seems others have had the same issues with this particular waitress, so I guess my question is: Why is she still working the front of the house? \\n\\nNot only was she more concerned with CLIPPING HER NAILS behind the cash machine than helping us (ewwwwwwwwww!), but she would ask us a question, and before we had time to answer, spin on her heel, mumble something unintelligible, and head back from whence she came. \\n\\nThis happened multiple times. So many times, in fact, that it became a running joke for the table.

Restaurant in back, butcher shop in front.  There is a parking lot in the back and a back entrance so you can just focus on the restaurant if you want.  The restaurant is divided into 3 spaces:  individual bar seating, tables, and booths. This set up allows for a variety of people to frequent:  singles at the bar, small families in the booths and groups of friends gathered around the tables.  Dai Due, THANK YOU for not having communal seating.  The decoration of the space is a very homey feel, with a roaring cooking fire and soft 'Edison' style dangle lights at the bar glowing off the peaceful blue color of the booths.  I don't know if these guys hired a Zen master to Feng Shui the space or what but I'm feeling it.  Kudos.\\n\\nThe focus on the food and beverage is everything regional and local.  They even make their own soda and non alcoholic drinks in house.  Their entire beer and wine list is all Texas (yee haw).  The meats are from area ranches. Texan lore tells me that their chef (and maybe owner) is a hunter so he 'gets' meat and how to prepare.  Their menu is written in a way where you can order family style (larger portions) such as supper club which is a 3 course pairing including dessert for a fixed price.  Or you can a la carte items for individual snacking as they are more petite portions but still packed with flavor.\\n\\nSince it's summer and I have a lycopene addiction I ordered everything involving tomatoes.  The advantage being that tomatoes are in full season in the summer and these babies did not disappoint.  Michelada drink blended with homemade tomato pur√©e (only gripe is I didn't love the flavor of the beer base--tasted like seltzer water), tomato salad and a side of fire flamed grilled tomatoes and okra.  Mmmm.  Dai Due used a mix of red and green tomatoes which was awesome.  The machacado (dried beef) on the salad was packed with amazing texture and flavor that complimented the tart acid of the tomatoes well.  \\n\\nThe appeal of Dai Due is definitely going to be the rotating menu since everything is sourced and seasons change.  Fridays are going to feature seafood.  There is a real talent here behind the creativity of the dishes that I would put on par with the talent of Tyson Cole and Bryce Gilmore.  Based on what I observed and tried this place will be worth coming back to experiment with.  Another bonus as always is the butcher shop up front where you can run in and grab some ranch raised meats to cook something at home.  Idea: come to bar, have some Texas brews on tap, eat a couple of small seasonal sides to see what delicious bounty is being experimented with currently then take home some freshly cut butchered meat to experiment with yourself.  Or just eat it all at the restaurant and let these guys do all the work for you.  They seem to know what they are doing."},{"name":"Sckavone's","address":"4100 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great family restaurant!

The smoked salmon and crispy potato was excellent. Sadly two of the entrees were disappointing. My duck breast was rather greasy atop an indistinguishable and quite unattractive mixture of the other ingredients. My daughter's quail suffered a similar accompaniment of indistinguishable ingredients enveloped in a wrap or crepe, unappetizing and which she did not finish. My wife had the trout and at least this dish was reasonably good. The wine list is extensive and very good, not overpriced given the quality. Service was mixed, attentive but at times a bit intrusive. I prefer to pour the wine myself but our server kept filling one or other of the glasses without first asking each guest if they wanted more. My wife eats rather slowly and the server asked her if she was finished while she was still dining. When she said no she was told no problem, take your time.

For an entree, my girlfriend ordered the quail and I ordered a fish & shellfish stew.  The waitress said they just sold the last quail, but they had a chicken they were going to prepare the same way.  I had some, and it was cooked perfectly.  Came with a fennel or barley type rice salad, which was ok.  Not overpowering flavor in that dish, but still pretty good.  My stew was more of a shallow broth with a 3-4 oz piece of white fish, 3 pieces of shrimp and 4 clams.  I was happy it wasn't a thick and hearty stew, but...for $24, I expected a little more.  The white fish was clearly fresh, but the shrimp and clams weren't.  The broth was very good, but not much to go around.

I ate here a lot long before I started using Yelp. I will continue eating here a lot. There are certain things in life that can be counted on, and my love for Tan Tan and it's place in the pantheon of Vancouver ethnic cuisine are two things that are pretty guaranteed.\\n\\nMy favorite is the pho: I order #40, Dac Biet (\\"House Special\\"), sans tripe, probably 70% of the time. The broth is rich and aromatic, the tendon melts into the bowl providing viscosity, the noodles come in obscene amounts, the meats are generous and (usually) great quality. Plus it gets meatballs, which are oddly textured yet strangely appealing. The broth is the best north of the Columbia, and better than some in Portland too.\\n\\nI also order the banh mi with regularity; I first started going to Tan Tan because at the time there was no other restaurant in Vancouver that offered them. #11, Lemongrass Pork, is my favorite, though I also on occasion will order the Vietnamese Ham. Both are fresh and flavorful, and only $3.50. That's a steal of a deal.\\n\\nI have ordered the Ca Ree/Curry multiple times; I prefer it with pork. It also comes with sliced sweet potatoes and sliced onions in a rich, coconut milk broth, thinner and less rich than a Thai style curry, but no less flavorful. I typically order this with a French roll, to dip and slurp and make a delicious mess of things. It has an addictive level of spice, the kind that burns half way through your meal but raises your endorphins enough to make to want/need to keep eating.\\n\\nI have had the Bun Vermicelli bowls multiple times, and the Dac Biet is by far the best deal, offering grilled lemongrass pork, grilled pork patty, a shrimp skewer, and a fried pork egg roll, plus cold rice noodles, nouc cham, and shredded \\"salad\\" of lettuce and herbs. I wish there were more herbs on this plate, instead of mostly shredded iceberg, julienned cilantro and bean sprouts. Some mint/basil would be nice, and when I order this to go it typically add more when I get home. \\n\\nI have had the Bo Kho twice. Super rich broth, fattier, braised beef parts. Good, hearty, but I prefer the pho.\\n\\nThere is a ridiculous amount of bubble teas available, if that's what you're into. I have had a mango+mango jelly a few times, its pretty good but definitely a sugar rush waiting to happen. I much prefer to get an iced coffee to go, which I do about 90% of the time. If I'm splurging in the winter I will sometimes get the avocado shake, which is a creamy, sweet avocado based milkshake thing that's really delicious but super rich. Notably, durian is offered, though I admit I haven't tried it.\\n\\nFour Stars, for a place I eat at multiple times a month, if not once a week? Consistency.\\n\\nSometimes the meats in the pho are sliced thin, the fatty brisket is tender without being exclusively fat. On my most recent visit, my bowl had a seven inch slice of skin that anyone would have been hard pressed to eat. That same bowl had absolutely perfect rice noodles; sometimes the rice noodles are overcooked and completely stuck together. Sometimes the bean sprouts aren't particularly fresh. \\n\\nBanh mi bread are french rolls from Portland French Bakery, a personal favorite of mine. Depending on the day (Sunday, usually), they aren't particularly fresh, and over toasted. My most recent banh mi, Monday, July 14, 2014, was frankly perfect. Bread gets delivered on certain days, I get that. But consistency is essential. \\n\\nBasically, because I eat here so often, and have for the last 3+ years, I've seen and weathered the ups and downs. Like I said at the beginning, it would take something far more offensive than overly crusty bread or stinky bean sprouts to keep me from eating here regularly.

I'm sure they're working on fixing that, but we stumbled upon it by pure, dumb luck. It's buried in the far Southern corner of Southpark Meadows, if you're curious.\\n\\nSo Smashburger is a Colorado chain expanding into Austin, and positioning themselves to go head-to-head with the likes of Mighty Fine and several other gourmet burger joints. You'll end up paying around $12 for a burger, fries and a drink, but that'll get you interesting things like rosemary fries, or the option for sweet potato fries.\\n\\nContrary to other reviews I've read, service was fast and drama free, and the burger itself was pretty good. Smashburger's gimmick is that they, you guessed it, smash the burger while they grill it. This is supposed to make it taste better, or cook better, or digest better. God only knows. It comes out looking flat and kind of sad, but tastes pretty good. Against my expectations, it wasn't dried out at all. \\n\\nThe fries on the other hand, were a soggy, rosemary mess. Interesting idea, pretty poor execution. I left, my stomach a little heavier, my wallet a little lighter. Personally I have disdain for this entire mid-priced segment of burgers. Give me a $5 P.

For some strange reason I thought the steak was going to be thin slices.  But I was pleasantly surprised that it was an actual little steak!  The steak was nicely seasoned (slightly too much salt for my taste, but in keeping with other Brazilian meat I've had which seems to be heavier on the salt than I usually would do myself).  The steak was better than I would have expected for a street cart.

Secondarily was the curt, if not dismissive, attitude exuded by the single server on staff when she did show up (this detail was perhaps a tie with the fact that there didn't seem to be a seat in the house that didn't feel to be smack in the middle of the traffic pattern). And then, but not worst of it, was the mediocre (and over priced) food we were served. \\nAfter getting through as much as we could stand, as we were waiting for our check, suddenly the entire dining area was overwhelmed by the stench of hot peppers and garlic in a cloud of stinking, stale fryer oil vapor. Not just a waft of it, but a full on wave! Could it be a ventilation failure, or simply a lack of adequate venting? I don't care. We bolted as quickly as we could manage. \\nI am, as I write this, washing for the second time the clothes I wore that night, in a seemingly vain attempt to get the stink of BaRa out.

I prefer it over Matsuyama because of the larger menu, lower prices, and better tasting food. Just be aware that it will most likely be very busy, and with the small location, this means the possibility of no immediately available parking and a very likely 10-20 min wait time. Also, this means rushed service (they seem understaffed as well). \\n\\nI went here yesterday after we realized that the ramen place we wanted to try was closed. So of course we headed to Koto, our usual go-to after-gym spot. There were two parking spaces open, luckily, at about 9:45 pm. We put our name down and were 3rd on the list, I believe, with a 10-15 min wait time estimate. I would say this was accurate.\\n\\nWhen you order, I would suggest knowing 100% what you want to get because the owner lady will get impatient if you are still deciding. She can take orders really quickly electronically. \\n\\nWe were pretty hungry so we got more items than usual. The final bill came to about $39 for 2 people, I believe. Our usual orders are a salmon/toro sashimi, cones, mini-dons, and tako wasabi.\\n\\nThe salmon/toro sashimi was good as usual. Toro is sooo delicious. Salmon is same as everywhere else. The slices for these are a little thin in my opinion but you get what you pay for.\\n\\nThe cones are all $1.99 and a great deal in my opinion. I would order just these if I were on a budget. I had a chopped scallop cone and also the kani cone. Kani is crab but the cone actually uses a tempura fried imitation crab piece with tobiko underneath and some cucumber. The chopped scallop cone was delicious.\\n\\nWe also got tako wasabi, one of my favourites. It comes with a lot of seaweed and a small bowl of octopus in this slimy sauce. The trick is not to put too much inside the seaweed - that's why they give you so much - the wasabi can really attack your nose! This is from the regular menu, not the late night one.\\n\\nI got the salmon mentaiko mini-don and my friend got the spicy chopped scallop mini-don, $3.99 each. She had no problem mixing her scallop with all the rice, but I ended up having some extra rice leftover. My don came with a huge blob of mayonnaise with the mentaiko which was surprisingly yummy and not too disgusting feeling. Although more filling, for the price I think two cones are a better deal :)\\n\\nWe noticed a menu on the side of the table with grilled items, and my friend wanted the yaki nasu, grilled eggplant. It was very light - a good change to all the other stuff we got. Not much more to say about this other than it was $4.25.\\n\\nWe also shared a mini hotpot - nabeyaki udon. It came with one prawn tempura and a yam tempura. There was egg, broccoli, imitation crab, and vegetables. It was a good size and tasted like a typical nabeyaki udon. I think this was $5.95. The picture I'll attach is half eaten - oops!\\n\\nLastly, we got chicken karrage. This came as 5 pieces of small chicken wings / drumsticks. These were fried and seasoned and very juicy. for $3.95, not too bad. I thought karrage normally comes as chicken chunks, but these are good too.\\n\\nOther items I've had before are the beef tataki, chopped scallop roll, mini sukiyaki hotpot, salmon carpaccio, tai carpaccio, spicy chopped scallop cone, agedashi tofu... I would not order the carpaccio again, they are all topped the same with mayo and onion and have less fish than other similarly priced items. The beef tataki is good but I think small as well. I am not a huge fan of tofu so this one was just okay. I think any variation of the mini hotpots, rolls, cones, and mini dons are a safe choice!\\n\\nI would definitely come back again. The service isn't amazing but I don't expect too much from a place like this. It's just good enough and no one is ever rude so that's fine. The food is priced well, the late night menu has an awesome variety, and it tastes so good!

How are you making traditional style Texas BBQ in the Frost Bank Building in the middle of downtown?  I don't think there is just a giant smoker in the middle of the street, I would have noticed.    After meeting the way too nice owner, I got my answer.  He smokes it in Taylor, and told me he has perfected a method for transporting and keeping meat moist post cooking far away.  \\n\\nSo how was the meat you ask, well actually not bad at all.  I'm still a bit confused by the whole \\"proprietary secrets\\" smoking and keep moist method.  My brisket was, as always, ordered fatty.  It was definitely moist, and was definitely cooked right.  Smokey flavor was strong and the meat melted away.  It was also cut well, just thick enough to give a good bark on the outside, but not to thick.  Sausage was another big plus.  By the looks of it you would think it was commercial, but by taste and confirmation by the owner it is very homemade.  interestingly it was the long link style you typically see in the grocery store, but custom made by the owner in Taylor.  Had great spice to it and a good snap on the case and nice flavor.   I'm more of a fan of small links or ring sausage, but this was still good.  The last meat I tried that I really liked was a bit of a surprise for me.  The turkey my girlfriend ordered was truly delicious.  It was the best cooked of all the meats I had, which surprised me because I assumed it would be dried out.  The meat was moist and tasted amazing.  Very light meat seasoned perfectly with bold taste, I thought it was the best of the four I tried that day.  I should also mention that they have banana pudding, and apparently it is delicious.  I do not eat banana pudding, but everyone at the table got one for free for ordering combo meals.  My brother assisted us and ate all three, and said they were fantastic.\\n\\nSadly the rest of the meal wasn't anything great for me.  I did not care for my side of potatoes, and beans were all too common.  Sauce (which should only be used sparingly and with bread or simply to taste) was too watery and too much spice to it.  Most disappointing was that I did not enjoy my rib.  While the size of the rib was great, it was a bit tough and over cooked.  Added to that I didn't think the spice rub was even on it and I found myself with random levels of flavor in each bite.  It was dried out to much with a bit too much chewy inedible fat.  \\n\\nOne thing that also bugged me at the back of my mind is that this place doesn't look like a Texas BBQ place.  Being in the bank building, it is a modern store front that tries to tie in new modern looks with a traditional cafeteria feel.  I think the inside could be tweaked a bit and still maintain a upscale feel to it while paying homage to the smokers of old (forgot to mention, the pitmaster is a family legacy of BBQ.  I have already visited his grandfathers place and two of his uncles places, with one uncle left to go... all of them have been delicious and great atmosphere).  Being downtown I'm sure he wants to attract a business crowd, so a sleak business look is important.  Still, a few modification couldn't hurt, including changing up the ordering, serving, getting food process.  \\n\\nAll in all this was a good stop that I will be back to.  Brisket tasted to good not to have again and it is conveniently located for me.  Also prices are right for a downtown eatery and the amount of food you get, so that is hard to beat."},{"name":"B.J.

The stars, or lack there of, are for the service from hostess to waiter. Omg it was dreadful. It's 4th of July weekend so you would think they would be properly staffed. The kitchen was because the food came out in a relatively timely matter but the rest... We came in about 6 and there was no hostess. It took at least 8 min. until someone came to seat us(or even speak to us). We were only a party of 6. The restaurant was pretty empty too. The waiter came over, he seemed harried but we got that, and since we didn't order our drinks fast enough he walked away to get someone else's order. Came back, left again, and came back. Finally got our order in, including most the food and since we didn't get one person's order in, he threw away our original order. Who does that? The only reason this is getting two stars is that the manger was a pro. Not only did he comp us dinner, he seemed genuinely sorry for our bad experience. Perhaps the waiter was off his game but he still shouldn't have been a dick. I may try another Uno's again but I won't come back to this one. I've only had bad service like this twice in my lifetime so perhaps I'm lucky. The manager made it so we didn't leave with burning anger so kudos to him.

The Crispy pork \\"siu yoke\\" was very tasty and it definitely lived up to the name, very crispy. The roasted duck, though the skin was not crispy but it was still very tasty nonetheless. \\n\\nThe 5 Spice wings were AMAZING. The 5 Spice it's their signature season and I absolutely recommend it, very very intense and complex deliciousness. \\n\\nNext we had the \\"roti\\" comes with a spicy curry dipping sauce but It can honestly do without any dipping sauce. It was sooooo good, fresh, soft , buttery and hot. It was DELECIOUS. Def something I will order every time I come here. \\n\\nWe then order the two noodle soups that seem to be the favorites here. The malaysian prawn soup and the curry laksa soup. They were both very tasty and spicy just like I like it! And a generous ration for the price. However, if had to choose one, I would go with the curry laksa!\\n\\nLast was the special of the day, \\"walnut shrimp\\" it was basically deep fried shrimp with a very good sweet Sauce and walnuts on top. Simple but very good. \\n\\nThe service was awesome, even when slammed to their teeth the staff managed to keep a smile on their face and treated us real nicely. Our waiter was great, very helpful and attentive without hovering. Food came in a timely manner. \\n\\nOne of the things I Loved the most about this place was the prices. Everything here is below $8. I think it is great quality food for the money so there is very minimal room to complain about this place. I now believe that their quality/price ratio has contributed tremendously to their success. I see some people complaining about the quantity but I didn't find this to be a problem for me, maybe because i quite familiar to tapas style plates or maybe i just appreciate quality over quantity. Perhaps you should look up the significance of \\"tapas\\"?\\n\\nCan't wait to be back and try more on the menu.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place.

First thing after we were seated (for a group if 7) one waitress took our drink orders and we had all requested water. 5 minutes later a different waitress came to take out food order. After waiting for some time everyone received their beers.... no water. Okay fine. The appetizers came out for one half of our table while the other half still waited for theirs. We finished our apps and then revived our meals.... still no waters nor apps for the second half of the table. I got the \\"special\\" which was supposed to be an arugula pesto pasta and what got was a bland pile of overcooked pasta.    By the time the first half of our table was done eating our meals they finally gave the second half of the table their apps and meals. The table was cleared by one of the waitresses and left my plate sitting on the table without an offer for a box or to even ask if I was done. It took 20 minutes to get a box for my food after the table was cleared for both sides (at this point around 45 minutes after I had finished eating) and to get the check. The staff was all sitting at the kitchen window talking and laughing and not even facing any of the tables.

Actually all the staff were like that...several people stopped by the table to see if we needed another beer or ask how everything was. GREAT SERVICE!\\n\\nThe menu is not too big, which I like. A handful of soup choices, salads & many sandwich options. I wasn't feeling very well, so I just had soup. It was broccoli cheese shiner soup in a bread bowl! AMAZING! It came with a side of homemade potato chips that were kind of flavorless, but good for dipping in the cheesy goodness.\\n\\nMy husband got the bread bowl full of what they call chili...and 1/2 of The Orgy sandwich. That is kind of like a Rueben, but with coleslaw instead of 'kraut. He looked like he died & went to heaven when he bit into it. He said it was the best sandwich of it's kind he has ever had. The chili (while totally NOT tasting like a traditional chili) was decent,, if thought of as a meaty, smoky, stew. I tasted it and was not a fan, but that is my personal taste, not anything to do with the chili itself. \\n\\nThe prices were really good for the amount & quality of the food. We got 2 bowls full of soup / chili, 1/2 of an amazing sandwich, chips & homemade pickled veggies, water & a beer for less than $20. \\n\\nI am really looking forward to returning when I am feeling better so that I can try the Godfather, which sounds incredible.\\n\\nAll in all - great little neighborhood joint with good food & wonderful service. \\n\\nNext time we go back, I'll take pictures!"},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I placed a to go order here for the first time today.There website is not user friendly and the phone number they have listed is disconnected.

The cup of minestrone it came with was great but the pasta was pretty forgettable.  I didn't care for the consistency of the penne, the chicken parm was good but the cheese was melted over way too much, and the fetticini was cooked well but the sauce was too salty.  Probably more specific to my pasta preferences but overall the meal was still pretty good.  The sangria ($6) and the minestrone soup were the high lights of the meal.

From the restaurant, I've had the Dai Due breakfast, venison breakfast sausage, venison tartar, kale gratin, quail, smoked pork chop, tamales with chilo con carne, biscuits and gravy with venison sausage, and pastrami sandwich.  The food here is special.  Every single thing I've had has been delicious. And their coffee - super strong Spicewood 71 Cuvee for drip coffee - is a great start to the day.

I'm looking mostly for location.\\n\\nI had also read about Sound Bites, but didn't realize til I got off the bus that two places are right next to each other in direct competition!  The lines ran just out the door for both establishments.  Yes, Sound Bites is physically larger and had the open-air thing going on, but I was sticking with my original choice.  I did ask a few folks in line that had been to both places.  I was actually told that there might be less of a wait due to the size of the competitor.  Again, I was glad I stuck to my guns.  Mike, the owner, realized that I was dining alone, and I got my pass directly to a table within 5 mins!  A very nice waitress immediately took my order and referred me to the beverage area in the rear of the restaurant.  There seemed to be plenty of coffee, varied teas - I believe there was an espresso machine.  I grabbed a Naked Juice from the fridge.  Less than 3 mins later, golden fluffy pancakes and a very crisp order of bacon had arrived!\\n\\nAs I ate, I noticed some fellow patrons had fresh fruit that had a fancy plating arrangement.  Another nearby table received a fresh (huge) blueberry scone on the house.  Maybe Mike felt bad for them having to wait in the rain.\\n\\nI finished up and got the check.  If you take off the Naked Juice, my meal was $6!!!!  $1.95 for almost SIX pieces of bacon.  LOVING IT!\\n\\nAfter my meal I took a few minutes out to speak with Mike.  He's quite a jolly fellow.  I saw his true appreciation for customer satisfaction during my entire visit - helping to greet and seat, helping his staff clear down tables, processing checks - all with great enthusiasm and a friendly smile.

After this review posted, The Hawthorne reached out to me to find out more about our experience, why we were disappointed, and were very proactive about course-correcting. I'm hopeful that our off night was a fluke, given the commitment to service they've shown.\\n\\nOriginal review follows:\\n\\nI'm a little reluctant here, and I don't want this review to sound petty, but it's also the kind of reviewI would want to find when checking Yelp. \\n\\nWe've been going to the Hawthorne since they opened. They've been our favorite bar not just in the Boston area, but in the country. Up until our most recent visit, every visit had been five stars. \\n\\nI don't really know if three stars is right for that most recent visit. I don't know what to call it. I know it was notably different from and less satisfying than our other visits. \\n\\nHere's the thing: the Hawthorne has been the standard to which we compare other bars. We are experienced cocktail drinkers with a home bar that includes well over 100 bottles, including more than a dozen amaros and a number of things not easily found in the US (free samples from international vendors given to me when I used to write reviews). I don't expect a bartender or server to immediately realize this, of course. But in the past, the Hawthorne has been the perfect place to discover new drinks: it's where I realized I like mezcal if it's in the right drink, and where we learned to love sherry drinks. A good proportion of the best new-to-us drinks we've had in bars have been at the Hawthorne. We have historically had servers who have tossed the menu aside and said, \\"well, what do you like?\\" and led us through a night of drink suggestions without a single dud.\\n\\nThis most recent visit, the server's first suggestion was a daiquiri. Now that's fine, if of itself - there's no way to know a guest's cocktail expertise or interests, and many people are going to show up wanting a daiquiri. But I had specifically led with, \\"I want to try something interesting and new to me, something that highlights the things the Hawthorne has or can do that other bars can't,\\" and the impression we were left with after four hours in the bar was that the server wasn't sure what those things might be. \\n\\nEvery drink we had was good. But the only ones that were particularly interesting were things we suggested ourselves (along the lines of \\"what if you took this and shook it with an egg white and added XYZ\\"). Specific drinks we requested were unavailable twice - once in a case that made sense (it required an ingredient not on hand), but in the other case, I think the server just wasn't willing to pass on an order for a drink she wasn't familiar with, even after we listed the ingredients (all of which were available and used in other drinks).\\n\\nService was always attentive. The drinks were always well made. Our server just lacked that ability to introduce us to new drinks (much less the special ability to introduce us to drinks we never would've guessed we'd love), which is the thing we come to the Hawthorne for. When you have a deep amaro selection and things like Douglas fir eau de vie, it seems like a shame to drive customers towards more conventional and novitiate drinks.\\n\\nIt just seems weird that we spent three days in Boston and the best drinks we had weren't at the Hawthorne, but at Uni and Eastern Standard -- or for that matter that Eastern Standard's drinks, right next door, were so much more interesting than what the Hawthorne offered us. It hasn't set well with us, and it'll make us more likely to go to Drink next time."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Honestly not sure what all the fuss is about!

It is definitely a nice joint, but we didn't feel out of place wearing our dry swimwear out on the shady patio, (close to the full bar and an unspoiled view of the creek).  When I saw my friend Tito on the menu, I knew I was going to like this place. I started with Tito's Sage and Grapefruit Splash (Tito's, St Germain, muddled fresh sage, fresh grapefruit).  It was perfect:  refreshing, not too sweet, and dangerously smooth.\\n\\nThe staff is extremely friendly, but genuine and not over-the-top.  I found the servers and bartenders to be very helpful and laid-back, and they all seem to enjoy their workplace.  This is a pricey place to take children, but the kids menu, the staff, and the outdoor seating make it suitable for big kids on a weeknight.  \\n\\nThe menu was chock-full of offerings based on farmer's market finds, and it was difficult to choose what to try.  \\n\\nNone of the homemade pimiento cheese went to waste.  The crunchy catfish was different from the usual cornmeal-breaded comfort food, but it got a thumbs up from the Louisiana natives at our table.  I'll admit that I was a little afraid to try the Barbacoa Stackers because I didn't know what the hell cojilla cheese even was, and I've never been a fan of coleslaw, but JAK's slaw is really, really, good--it is dry, crispy, and its sweetness comes from freshness of the veggies, not a bottle.  I got an off-menu special that combined juicy grilled porkchops with sauce that must have been comprised of sauteed veggies in a red wine reduction (I was told all the fancy details, but after a couple of drinks, I couldn't remember exactly).  \\n\\nSave room for dessert!  The chocolate bomb is a light, raspberry-laden cocoa confection that will knock your socks off!  The local peach cobbler is served alongside a scoop of Amy's Mexican vanilla ice cream.  After tasting the perfectly crispy topping on Jack's cobbler, I'll never bother to make one from scratch again."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Granted this review will be biased as my husband and I are regulars.

Beef, chicken and pulled something. No menu. That was it. I was told they used to have a buffet. I ordered the beef, my wife ordered the chicken. Mine was a flattened piece of something that was tougher than shoe leather. Seriously. My wife's chicken was similar. They gave us a salad with 2 drops of ranch dressing. No choice. The plate had the meat, a pile of dry over cooked white rice, beans of some kind  and carrots. Then they gave us a pudding of some kind. Awful. I'm 250 lbs and not a picky eater.

For the cost of a cute T-shirt you sign up and then every time you visit the Saucer, (or any other of their nationwide locations) you sample a different beer by keeping track of your order on their computer system.  After you reach 200 different beers you get to have a party with credit for free beer and the unveiling of your very own saucer (complete with your name) to mount on their wall.  What a great way to get people coming back to your establishment and trying out different beers.  \\n\\nThe prices can be a bit high but I will sacrifice for selection.  200 different beers is nothing to shake a stick at.  I have been to several different Flying Saucer locations (Nashville's being my favorite) and this was falls right in the middle for me.  The proximity to UT means a healthy stream of frat boys but don't be surprised on a lazy Sunday afternoon during a football game to find some people bringing their kids.  The Flying Saucer is also a restaurant too but skip the food.  The best deal is the $3 Texas beer specials every Sunday where you can try even seasonal specials at that rate.

It also scores big points for being located at the top of the hotel, on the 17th floor, where the Disney fireworks can be viewed from the many windows and the outside dining area. My group thoroughly enjoyed the fireworks from the balcony, with a glass of Moscato in hand.  Our server was knowledgeable and made lots of suggestions on menu items. We opted to order several tapas and share. \\n\\nSo why the lack of stars? The food. We were all incredibly disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. It was just okay, and at the price point of the menu items, just okay isnt worth it. The deviled eggs (correction, egg) left me thinking, \\"I had better at the Yelp holiday party at the Science Center. Darn, I can't remember what place made those. Actually, my mom's are better to\\". The chili shrimp was blah, the goat cheese flat bread with carmelized onions and bacon fell so short that everyone was done after one bite, and the ham croquettes (on the server, just because) lacked pizzazz to. The fried cauliflower was a step up, but not by much. There was one dish that won us all over, the chorizo with roasted poblanos. Well, the chorizo at least. A couple of us opted for dessert considering we hadn't actually eaten much; the lemon cake with honey and yogurt sorbet was my choice and I found it to be wonderful. The dessert and Moscato were definitely the highlights of the meal itself. Many have given this restaurant rave reviews so maybe we missed with our choices (maaaaaybe).

The wait time can be enjoyed in the downstairs bar which has karaoke after 9pm. I ordered the Hibachi chicken dinner. The food was pretty good but what makes hibachi different is the show the cook puts on. The flipping and clinging of the spatula the catapult and cracking of the eggs in mid air and the fiery blaze that lights up the grill really added to the dining experience. you can also enjoy sake (Japanese wine) administered through a squeeze bottle right into your mouth courtesy of the cooks surgical aim by the end you will work up a decent buzz from the large amount of  wine poured into your mouth. I would give this place 5 stars the only downside was that the chicken was not as tender and felt like a lesser quality chicken, The sauce and the grilling masqueraded some of the absence of preferred tenderness and the fried rice made up were the chicken was lacking, overall happy experience for my friends Birthday.

I didn't drink, so I can't attest to how good or bad the cocktails were.  The first app we ordered (Deviled Eggs) was pretty good and the second app (Spinach and Artichoke Dip) was also pretty good.\\n\\nSo over the course of the two hours we were waiting, the place started filling up.  I noticed that as soon as people left the bar seats, the bartenders would slide the \\"Reserved\\" signs forward, so no one could just sit down.  That's understandable, because if 2/3 of your restaurant is closed down I could understand wanting to seat people at the bar.  Totally reasonable.  However, I then realized that the people taking all of the \\"Reserved\\" seats had arrived after us.  Odd.  So, around the 1.5 hour mark, three bar seats opened up and the \\"Reserved\\" signs were promptly put out.  My friends and I are thinking \\"Awesome, these HAVE to be for us\\".

All of the wines are local, so I asked her for a recommendation. She came back with a tasting of a wine similar to a Vino Verde and she nailed it. The wine was very aromatic and had a bit of a crispy almost sparkling finish to it, it was the perfect pairing to our seafood-based appetizers and entrees. \\n\\nAfter ordering our wine I asked if she could bring some bread over as I was starving. Freshly baked bread with homemade in-house creamy butter arrived a few minutes later and it was delicious.

The dip was creamy and flavorful. \\n\\nI'm giving this place a 5/5 because of their fantastic display, presentation, and flavor profile of the grilled whole snapper and bay shrimp with veggies entree.

Looking around while you're eating, you really kind of ask yourself, is the food really as good as I'm imagining? My second visit proved it wasn't a fluke: the sandwiches are great!\\n\\nWhile the margarita on my first visit failed to impress, the well drink on my second visit was just fine...and VERY stiff.  I explored the jukebox and was happy to find that it offers an excellent selection.  Everything from Roger Miller to The Decemberists to The Smiths to Willie Nelson to Dusty Springfield.  \\n\\nThe chips that come with the sandwiches are excellent, and I say that as a person who doesn't eat chips.  I do wish they had fries, but I have to say the chips are the best I've had in town.  The escabeche-like condiment that they serve on the side (onions, cucumbers, carrots and serrano peppers that have been lightly pickled in a sweet vinegary brine that I can't identify, but which tastes to me sort of like mirin, the sweet Japanese rice wine) is delicious.  It reminds me of the pickled ginger that comes with sushi--in a very good way. \\n\\nThey have trivia night and foosball tournaments and other events.  It's clear that they aim to become a weeknight/neighborhood hangout.  They also have pool tables and ping pong, as well as a big stack of board games.  \\n\\nThe place is nothing fancy, but the staff is friendly, the drinks are strong, and the food is excellent.

Instead you only receive your printed receipt on the table. Makes you feel that you need to take it up to the register yourself. Found out that you don't.\\n4) Bathrooms - need to fill the paper towel holders vs leaving paper towels hanging out for people to touch and pull a towel off. It would be more sanitary in the proper dispensers. \\n5) Get laminated menus and use the paper ones for takeouts.  Add your address and hours on the paper menus. \\n6)  I think the manager walked by us a few times.. Would've been nice for the manager to stop at our table and ask how we were doing.  We would've asked her about the ranch dressing and/or refills.\\n7) There were candle holders on the tables with a tea light candle in them.

You'll find Clam Chowder, Lobster Rolls, Pizza, Bagels, Gelato, Pastries, and so much more.  It's so difficult to decide what to get, and it's all been quite good in my experience.  Once you've picked out your food, head outside for one of the street entertainer shows.  I find they're mostly acrobatic type shows, and they're usually a heck of a lot of fun to watch.  Quincy Market has got to be the best food/entertainment for the money in all of Boston.  After you're done eating there are a bunch of lovely boutiques to check out all around the market.  The biggest issue here is of course, parking.  Just take the T if you can, or park at the garage near the North End.

No matter what time of day I have my first meal, I ALWAYS prefer for it to be breakfast. On Saturday, my sisters and I got a late start and were searching for somewhere to have breakfast/brunch. Unfortunately, all the places we were finding and considering close or stop serving breakfast at 2pm. Just as I began thinking my breakfast dreams were not going to come true, one of my sister found this amazing little restaurant (on Yelp of course) that serves breakfast until 3pm!!! So we hightailed it over and was pleasantly pleased with our choice. \\n\\nElliot's Public House is a small quaint restaurant located on Orange Ave across from Lake Ivanhoe. If you're not looking for it, you could easily pass it which I have obviously doing for a while...but not anymore! We walked up to the restaurant and there was a covered patio area for those who like dining al fresco. Due to the weather that day we chose to eat inside. The place was empty upon our arrival so we chose our booth and had a seat. The only downfall was that it smelled as they had mopped with dirty mop water, but it wasn't enough to be a deterrent from staying. The room was split in half, one side sectioned off to accommodate large parties, and the other for smaller groups like ours. \\n\\nOur waitress came over in seconds asking for drink orders and brought them out promptly. She was very friendly. She was also very knowledgeable about the menu items and offered some great recommendations of things to eat. I decided on the corned beef hash and eggs. The hash was homemade and extremely flavorful and not too greasy like you find at some places. I ordered my eggs scrambled hard, which was exactly what I received. I was very pleased with this because I normally have to send my eggs back to be cooked longer, so WAY TO GO GUYS! Breakfast potatoes were also served with my meal and they were seasoned perfectly. The food just tasted like it was cooked with love which was great! One of my sisters ordered the croissant sandwich which I tasted and it was phenomenal and my other sister had the country fried chicken and eggs which I also tasted and it was fantastic as well. Two of our meals came with biscuits and our waitress was kind enough to give us enough for everyone which we appreciated. \\n\\nIf you can't already guess I absolutely enjoyed my experience here and I will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Madras Pavilion","address":"9025 Research Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Very Good!\\nI registered for Yelp to write a review for Madras.

I could have done without the rice and the dessert went straight in the trash.  $32 for enough to feed my husband, son and I with enough leftovers for one.\\nAll-in-all, a very good Indian meal.

So I was indeed pleased when, on a recent family visit to Atlanta, my bro and sis-in-law recommended Fellini's for dinner one night.\\n\\nMy brother had described this place as a \\"hometown-y pizza joint,\\" and I think that's an apt description. The restaurant has a lovely outdoor patio with bare-bones tables/chairs and some nice twinkle lights, and inside, the vibe is pleasantly retro: The menu above the counter looks like it was hand-written sometime in the '70s (that's a good thing), and the \\"kitchen\\" is basically right next to it, so you can actually witness the pizzas and calzones and other delicious treats as they're being assembled. We ordered a pizza to go during the height of the dinner rush yet only had to wait 10-15 minutes, and while we did, we parked our fannies in a couple of wait-chairs by the door, listened to the bouncy radio station they had on, and people-watched. It's a very active and inviting atmosphere.\\n\\nAs for the pizza itself, it honestly hit all the boxes on my pizza checklist: Piping hot, full of melty but slightly browned cheese, enough sauce for flavor but not so much that it drips off, and crust that's crispy enough on bottom to support the pizza but still chewy when you bite into it. Sure, it's greasy, but in a satisfyingly hometown-y way. A large cheese pie was less than $15, which is relatively cheap considering it provided dinner for three people. If we'd bought drinks and sides (Fellini's appeared to have a good beer selection, and they offered a few starters) it could have gotten a bit more expensive, but -- like I said -- I think that good pizza can and should be the main event.\\n\\nI'll definitely request this place as a dinner stop on subsequent visits to the ATL, and I enjoyed the simple cheese enough that I'd definitely branch out and try some other pies, perhaps by the slice (as many other reviewers have suggested.

The lobster rolls looked sad and there was not much of a crowd surrounding it. The one thing I did try was the mac and cheese because a friend of mine had recommended it. Now this seemed like a good idea, I mean you can't really screw up mac and cheese. I ordered the pesto mac and cheese (this place seems to be popular for its twists on the classic mac). Right off the back this became a bad idea. The cashier was rude and seemed to be less than satisfied with his employment at this mac shop. The \\"cook\\" preparing the mac and cheese made it look pretty unappetizing, as he was just tossing and throwing everything into one pan. And to be clear, if you're going to toss cold macaroni into a hot pan you should let it simmer a bit longer than 10 seconds or else you're going to give your patrons cold mac and cheese which to no surprise is what I got. Under seasoned, over cooked, and cold is what I got. A big bowl of disappointment. \\n\\nYou won't miss much if you go to Boston and bypass Quincy Market."},{"name":"Sam Snead's Oak Grill and Tavern","address":"1801 Maitland Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Since my husband works in the area, we've been here a few times and were never disappointed.

We went in on a Sunday around 6pm; the restaurant was about half full with more pouring in every minute. We sat at the bar while waiting for our guests and enjoyed watching chef Luigi cook in their open kitchen, singing quietly with a smile on his face greeting every guest that came through the door and thanking them on their way out. Every employee was sure to stop by and say 'hello' and thank us for coming in. The food was fantastic. We ATE. Calamari and mussels and salad and soup and fish and pasta and gnocchi and cannolis. It was all wonderful, comforting, made with love Italian food; not to mention affordable!

We ordered the daily drink special, since the bartender hadn't made it before he gave it to us on the house to make sure it was good (it was delicious). We saw a woman who complained about her food (she was remarkably rude) and they immediately fixed the issue, offered to bring her more sides and gave her a meal on the house. Even with her extremely rude demeanor, complaining that they don't have food for her baby on the menu and not saying please or thank you, they went above and beyond to give her good service. \\n\\nHappy we stopped in, great meal and fantastic service!"},{"name":"Tan Tan Cafe & Delicatessen","address":"316 SE 123rd Ave, Ste A3","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I'm always hunting good Vietnamese food options.  Since moving to Vancouver in July, 2013 from the Foster/Powell neighborhood in PDX (aka \\"Dangerously close to Best Baguette\\"), I've been exploring my hood for the triune necessitates; pho, banh mi, and boba.  Well, Tat Tan Cafe in Vancouver has effortlessly reassured me that I'll be fine.  The sandwich bread, while not as fantastically crisp as BB's, was very good, and--due to the slightly less crisp exterior--a refreshing change, especially to the roof of my girlfriend's mouth.  We both did various porky sandwiches: she did the pork patty, and I did the lemongrass pork. Both were very good, but we agreed that the patty won the day.  It was only after we bit into our sandwiches that we spotted HEAD CHEESE on the menu, to which my girlfriend replied \\"Hmmm... see you tomorrow!\\". Their boba options are varied and nice. I had a malt-flavored blended with coffee jellies. Outstanding.  I only smelled/witnessed their pho, but was encouraged to see a number of patrons slurping with enthusiastic abandon.  The place is pleasantly appointed, clean and tidy. Staff were very pleasant.  The menu offers us much to explore.

In her defense, she hadn't ever had the bottle we described, but she did her best to satisfy our tastes, recommending sakes she likes and others she hadn't tried but were popular.

These two are basically the same dish - same broth, same ingredients, etc. The Curry Laksa might have a bit for curry added which we could not detect the curry flavor but a hint of bitterness from the curry. The Roti Panai is ok, the curry has no curry flavor.

I got my worse sticky rice with mango from this restaurant. How can they screw up this simple and easy to make dessert? They sell a version of the sticky rice and mango dish called the sticky brown rice with mango. The rice was not chewy/sticky enough, feels like regular brown rice mixed with sticky white rice. The mango tastes like CANNED MANGO. Mango has no flavor or tastes - it came out smushed/in an almost ground up mango paste. I hope I am wrong on the canned mango, if you can't source fresh mango, please take the dish off the menu and do not sell canned mango. btw some places do make the mango and sticky rice without the coconut milk, the mango and sticky here does not come with coconut milk (coconut milk is not a requirement)."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We visited Canoe this past week and it was a great experience.

Today I finally had the chance to stop in.  I had no idea there was so much seating inside!  I was promptly greeted and Jake took my family's order.  He asked us to find a table and told us someone would bring the order to the table.  The restaurant was clean with a good lunch crowd for a Sunday.  The noise level was OK.  The seating area in the rear of the store was very attractive indeed.  The restaurant is handicapped accessible, though one of the three bathrooms has a step to enter.  Some of tables did need to be wiped down from previous parties, however.  The bathrooms were clean.\\n\\nThe falafel was fried to order, it isn't sitting around waiting to be reheated.  The latter being a big no-no for any fried food.  \\n\\nOur food arrived in a very reasonable amount of time.  We had a falafel & hummous plate, a spicy falafel roll up, and curly french fries.  The portions were very generous.\\n\\nThe falafel was hot and crispy on the outside.  They had lots of flavor with a healthy chickpea to stuffing ratio.  The fillings were mostly excellent, pickles, carrots, a very nice hot sauce with a kick, and tahini sauce.  The only downside was the use of iceberg lettuce and very thin American pita that lost integrity in the middle of the meal.  It's a testament to the quality of the falafel and fillings that despite those short comings I really enjoyed the falafel wrap.  My preference is for thicker Israeli type pita and shredded cabbage in my falafel.  \\n\\nThe falafel plate was similar, though not constructed into a sandwich.  The hummous was alright, though I prefer a more creamy style of hummous.  My kids thoroughly enjoyed the falafel plates.\\n\\nThe fries were pipping hot and delivered with a bottle of ketchup.\\n\\nJake checked back on the table to make sure we were satisfied.  Bear in mind we were sitting in the back of the store well away from the counter.

This review should serve as an informative warning, though I won't say that I was slighted or offended in any way that should keep you, the reader, away if you can overlook those things that made my experience so negative.\\n\\nI was in a party of three on, as I said, a Tuesday night, and we got there around 7:15.  The place wasn't empty, but we were seated immediately and most of the tables around us had patrons.  The first strike against this place was the uninspired menu.  I sensed no real common theme on the menu--some appearances from Cajun, New England, New York Deli, and BBQ.  On top of this, not a single item on the menu stood out.  Sure, there was something called a \\"Printer Dog\\" (hot dogs with sauerkraut and chili) and a \\"Printer Burger\\" (regular burger), but there was nothing that I saw that seemed like a unique offering from this restaurant.  I ordered the Crimson Reuben, which is exactly the same as a reuben anywhere else, except greasier (the bread seemed to be grilled in butter).  I will say that there was plenty of corned beef on the sandwich, but that's about all.\\n\\nBetween the 3 of us, we ordered two cocktails, and drank a total of one and a quarter.  Someone else in my party ordered the Holland Razorblade, which was gin, citrus, syrup, and cayenne pepper.  It was served on crushed ice, which was already partly melted, and the drink was too watered down to enjoy.  I ordered the Ginger Snap, with ginger liqueur, maple whisky, cinnamon, and topped with cream.  The cream was so overwhelming that the entire drink tasted unpleasantly like the icing that accompanies a Cinnabon.  Would not order again.\\n\\nWe had the calamari appetizer, which was actually quite good, but sides that we ordered were underwhelming.  The pinwheel fries sounded appealing, but ended up being plain steak fries that were bent a little.  Again, a sad attempt to personalize some ubiquitous menu item.  The lobster pups, their \\"sophisticated\\" lobster and butter infused version of hushpuppies, were dry to the point that our two orders of them went uneaten save the one each of us had to ascertain their inedibility.\\n\\nPerhaps you've noticed a negative tone in this review that seems out of touch with my description so far, which brings me to the service.  Oh, the service.  The service alone made this review a 1-star no-brainer, but the food and drinks did the restaurant no favors.  Anyway, we walked in at 7:15 and were seated, and our order was taken in a reasonable amount of time.  Our drinks and appetizers arrived in a not-too-long window, but then our waiter must have forgotten to place our food order, because at 8:15 we asked about our entrees, and he said \\"oh, sorry, this is my fault, they should be coming out soon\\" and vanished.  When our food FINALLY did come, the sides we had requested accompanying each appetizer were matched with the wrong entrees, which resulted in a lot of scraping food onto bread plates and then passing those around the table.  \\n\\nThere is absolutely no reason that our food should have taken over an hour from time of order to time on table (finally after 8:30) considering we ordered 3 sandwiches and the restaurant wasn't crowded.  However, somehow it did manage to take our server over an hour to feed our party--unacceptable.   To his credit, he did apologize and take the appetizer and sides off the bill.   However, when he brought the bill to our table, he handed us the check for another table--a man a few tables away who had a couple beers and a couple appetizers.  I almost wish I lacked the integrity keeping me from silently paying that bill instead of ours, as it was less than half the price of ours and I was pretty fed up by my experience at First Printer, and so swapped that bill for the real one, settled up, and got out of there, swearing to both write this and never return to First Printer."},{"name":"Grass Skirt Tiki Room","address":"105 N Grant Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"They don't open at 11am.

I ordered the steak-tips medium.  Seriously tasted like Stop and Shop teriyaki steak.  Some pieces were rare and some were well-done.  We also ordered a sausage and ricotta pizza with caramelized onions.  Sounds delicious, right... We had to use 1/2 of the salt and pepper shaker just to choke down the 1/2 the pizza.  The crust tasted like it had been in the freezer for a couple of days.  I have to rate the food at a 2/10, and that's being generous.  We then received the bill and it was $75!

I'll get to the food in a minute, but first I gotta bitch about the \\"complimentary\\" valet parking. The set aside a large portion of the parking lot for valet parking, thus insuring there is not enough parking, then offer to park your car in the spaces which they reserved. This saves you a walk of about 30 feet, and of course you have to wait in line for the valet to park AND retrieve your car, and then tip them for the \\"service\\". I can't decide whether to label the valet service as a scam or just a worthless amenity. Or both. On to the food...\\n\\nMy first visit was disappointing - but not so bad I wouldn't go back. I ordered the chicken fried pork chop with mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley (there were no options for the veggies). The pork chop was pretty good but a little on the dry side, the gravy saved the day with some much needed moisture. The mashed potatoes were pretty good, but nothing special. The veggie medley was luke warm and mushy.\\n\\nOn my return visit I ordered the beef rib quesadillo appetizer and the green chili burger with fries for the entree. The appetizer was very tasty and was served with an interesting \\"Jack Allen Slaw\\", which I liked. The meat on the Quesadillo was pretty fatty, but it was rib meat, so that wasn't a surprise. The green chile burger was only so-so. They added pickles to the burger which was a serious taste clash with the green chilies, and the bun was one of those soft, over-the-top sweet buns which I'm not a fan of. The fries were okay. I'll also comment of my wife's steak salad since she got tired of chewing and left a sizable portion for me to try. The salad was limp and and the steak slices were way over-cooked and seriously chewy. It had an okay flavor, but was just too dry and chewy to enjoy. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was very nice, and the wait service was top notch.

We went on a Friday and my friend brought his dog.  We all had a sausage, including the dog.  They make dog treats which are totally wholesome and good for the animals.  However, let's talk about human food.  They have a ton of different sausages on the menu.  I had the Boerewors which is South African beef and pork.  It was delicious!  Had it on my choice of bun which was a kolache roll but you can choose pumpernickel or pretzel as well.  My side was the German potato salad which was served in a mason jar and topped with bacon, little bit of green onion and something slightly sweet and buttery.  It wasn't traditional but was served warm and was like baked potato's in a jar.  Outstanding.  (I had a bite of the cream corn with fried onion strings on top and that was great as well)\\n\\nBeer\\nThe beer selection is stellar.  Over 100 beers to choose from and many are exotic to these parts.  I had Pedernales Lobo which is a local pilsner.  Good beer on a nice autumn day.  Topped that off with a porter that is not even on the web page it's so rare.  You can get just about any style of beer and they have kegs that even Flying Saucer doesn't have\\n\\nService\\nThe service was great.  We sat outside and didn't have to wait too long for anything.  They are very dog friendly as well.  More on that later.  We had a nice young lady who brought us beers and food promptly, was friendly to our dog, and made great recommendations.  Couldn't be better.\\n\\nAtmosphere\\nI didn't stay inside as my party was already outside.  It looked very nice on the inside but most of my review is of the outside.  They have lots of picnic tables lined up in the \\"backyard\\" which was quite spacious.  The pecan trees are very large in that area and provide good shade coverage even during mid-day.  There are a couple of pits for smoking food for events and a barn/stage for music and football.  They were installing a huge screen while we were there and most likely that is for football season. \\nThe second part of the outside is a dog run that is fenced in so you can let your pooch run around if you like.  We did not partake as our dog was the only one there.

In addition, they have an amazing selection of exotic ice creams (surprising in a japanese restaurant)-- the mango and the black sesame seed flavors are not to be missed.\\n\\nThe sushi is very well prepared and tasty.

My favorite aspect of this entree was the roasted potatoes, they were well-cooked and well seasoned, there was also a really nice crispiness from the skin that made all the difference. The Garvey Burger, while enjoyabe, isn't as comparable to other veggie patties I've had in the past (particularly those at Yeah! Burger and Grindhouse). One other aspect I found odd about the restaurant is that they serve the water lukewarm - you'll have to specifically ask for ice or order another beverage. \\n\\nOverall though, Soul Vegetarian serves some delicious interpretations to \\"traditional\\"   vegetarian eats, but if you're not vegetarian or vegan some of the entrees may fall short.."},{"name":"Garden Halal Meat","address":"96 Blackstone St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have never been there and I won't go to Garden Halal Meat.That's because of the phone call I had with one of the employees who was the worst person.

The last one was with Verizon which almost was a law suit... I can assure you this isn't that bad.\\n\\nQuite frankly I think Yelp is for petty people with too much time on their hands who massively exaggerate stories to try to get people in trouble. This is my last straw with QDOBA as a whole and not just one individual but unfortunately this experience is the straw that broke the camel's back. \\n\\nI will tell you first my experience with Qdoba as a whole... it is a far superior tasting place than Chipotle. I hate Chipotle. For years I hear people rave about Chipotle & it's nasty. I happened to live in Chicago a few years ago right by a Qdoba and I give it a shot. I was hooked. Constantly to the point when I walk in the door they say \\"DREW!!\\" and they immediately start making my bowl. The bowl is constantly the same price... I never deal with \\"extra meat?\\" or \\"half and half\\" when I'm clearly saying the same thing... steak and chicken... I'm never dealing with how much portions I'm getting... I never deal with a rice intolerance being a thing that stops me from getting black beans. For some reason I move to Columbus and this chain is a huge mess.\\n\\nOne day at 5th street I pay 7.80, one day I pay 10.80. One day I have 4 pieces of steak at 10.80... one day I have it all the way to the top at 7.80. I've had it with this inconsistency when ALL I WANT IS TO HAVE YOUR FOOD CONSISTENTLY!\\n\\nI gave up on 5th Ave so I had to go out of my way to Campus today because the craving was THAT REAL for your food. Going back to previously what I had said regarding exaggerations this is my experience today that will end my 5 year relationship with you (and trust me if you saw my points card you would know it's a lucrative one)\\n\\nI will preface this with that in fairness I did come in with a bad mood and I don't wish to sound like a child needing his blanky I just wanted what I wanted. I'm greeted by a manager looking guy who puts the gloves on and I'm immediately feeling like \\"manager guy = stiff portions\\"... and the more super corporate he sounded the more I knew it would be a $10 day for no food whatsoever. That's of course... just speculation and not fair... but it's my initial vibe.\\n\\nI ordered a bowl as I always do... NO RICE but both beans. Another issue I've seem to run into only in Columbus is that beans are somehow the sink for rice. How this isn't more of an issue for Qdoba I don't know but the guy informed me almost in a \\"well shit out of luck because rice is in the beans\\" way (though he never said that) and we just kind of had this 10 second thing where I know there are other beans and he knows there are other beans but he just wanted me to get my order without black beans. Rice is my problem... rice in beans is a restaurant problem. \\n\\nHe opts to finally fold in our little mexican standoff to say I had an option to have black beans (well duh I know I do) so this point I already do not like him. The Kids menu portion of steak and kids menu portion of chicken made me really not like him. Then the fajita veggies weren't out yet so he wants to put those on out of order and after more Kids menu portions he puts those on dead last fresh and hot and melting the quacamole and the cheese all over my kids menu of food for a WHOLE NEW total of 8.89. \\n\\nI leave furious... I get to my car and the more I look at this thing and knowing it was the last $8 I spend until my paycheck clears at midnight tonight the more LIVID I am. I am not going to eat this. No! NO! I'm going back. \\n\\nI go back. I ask for someone else to make it or it be refunded. I returned the meal completely in tact. HE IS THE ONE THAT WANTS TO MAKE IT AGAIN! As soon as I see the same crap about to happen twice I just wanted it on my card ending in 1535... which as of right now I am not seeing a credit for. He told me he would handle it and I almost left with no receipt proving I would be credited but insisted on one. I got one without my credit card number with some TM1138 at the top and he took my e-mail address to assure I would get confirmation. \\n\\nI'm sorry to be ending my relationship with you Qdoba but this was it. ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS ENJOY YOUR RESTAURANT WITH CONSISTENCY IN PORTION, PRICE, AND ... I dunno... not have attitude for a food intolerance in Rice. I personally do not believe I'm asking for too much. Which when this place is awesome... it's REALLY freakin awesome. When it's horrible... It's feels like a wallet robbing for no food.\\n\\nI do not wish to get anyone in trouble, just perhaps give other people better experiences than I had and have had with this brand in Columbus and explain why 50-80 bucks a week will no longer go to your product. \\n\\nI want the card credited immediately.

The sandwiches are great for both vegetarians and carnivores. I like the (vegetarian) Scalloped Potato/Egg and Zucchini/Spinach/Egg for breakfast. I like the (carnivorous) meatball sub and harvest sausage with pumpkin mascarpone for lunch. You really can't go wrong.\\n\\nI maintain that Shut Up & Eat may not be the best breakfast or lunch in Portland (competition is awfully stiff), but in my experience they are hands down the best sandwich shop in town.\\n\\nIf the owners had been content with their top-notch sandwich business, I doubt anyone would have minded. But then they go and open a top-notch deli and market next door. They heavily feature local products and provide everything from household staples to Italian ice to a full catering menu.\\n\\nIn the market section, you can pick up a locally made hot sauce, Portland Ketchup Company products, beer from Hopworks and Gigantic, pasta, fresh baked bread, candy, and even Shut Up and Eat swag. I highly doubt that they'll ever cut into the local Safeway or Trader Joe's business... but if I ever find myself in a situation where I just need some bread or I just need some ketchup, this is probably where I'll come. Between the superior quality of products and the convenient location, I'm sure they'll do very well.\\n\\nThe deli is a trip. I mean, where else can you get Elk with Oregon Huckleberry sausages? Or Russian Wild Boar with Caraway and Garlic sausages? Is your mouth watering yet? These are just two of six locally sourced sausages offered at the deli (and hey! You can get local baguettes, cheeses, and condiments right here too!).

Tucked behind the Coolidge Corner Clubhouse on Babcock Street, Shiki is as unassuming a storefront as possible.\\n\\nIt's pretty minimalist on the inside as well, but my coworker told me it's his home away from home when he wants good, authentic Japanese food. I decided to go for lunch with a friend and get one of Shiki's Kaiseki lunch platters, the Take. For $16 (which is slightly more expensive than the online menu would have you believe), you get a plethora of mini-dishes, including (but certainly not limited to) karaage, broiled fish, tempura, and some sashimi. Some of the dishes were better than others, but none of them phenomenal. In the middle of the smorgasbord was a little cup of pickled vegetables and tiny fishes (sardines?) that I anthropomorphized and therefore couldn't touch. Even if I got past the fact that they were looking at me with sad little faces, I don't imagine they would have tasted very good.\\n\\nIf I had to pick one dish that stood out from the rest, it would be the white rice infused with nori and miso. It was very mild, but it was one of those dishes that got better the more you ate of it. That was definitely the highlight of what turned out to be a satisfying Japanese lunch that didn't quite meet my expectations.\\n\\nBefore I go, I should say that I didn't experience any of the service problems that others on here have complained about.

This individual has no business being an employee much less a manager of a food establishment. This store is worse than the Domino's down the street, and believe me, that's saying something.

It varies by place, cooks, and your own constitution, I would guess. But I am sure that I've lived a scant five minutes by car from the Avenue of Roses for a few years, and I only recently became enlightened about the awesome sauce that is Baiyok Thai on 82nd between Burnside and Glisan. I'm also sure that I'm a moron for having ignored Baiyok all that time. \\n\\nYou would be equally an idiot to pass it by if you love curry on the tongue-tingling side, cashew tofu you'll want to lap up like soup on a chilly Sunday evening, actual Tom Yum soup that makes for a hearty meal on its own, and pad kee mao that could very well best the noodles at Cha Ba Thai. That's right. Baiyok might be better than Cha Ba Thai, and in this city, that's like saying there's a better independent book seller than Powell's.

My wife and I wanted to try something new, and were excited by the fact that they had a gluten free menu.

I immediately noticed that I was the only person in the entire dining area wearing shorts.  This restaurant is obviously a favorite for those on a quick \\"business lunch\\" because almost everyone looked like they were minutes away from heading back to the office.\\n\\nI ordered an angus beef burger, medium, and received it quickly.  Now, I do like to consider myself quite the \\"burger connoisseur\\" as I order one almost everywhere I go.  The beef was extremely flavorful and well cooked, just pink enough in the middle, but not pink enough to flash \\"E. Coli\\" before your eyes.  The garlic seasoned fries were very tasty (although extremely salty!).\\n\\nThe decor of this restaurant was great.  Granted, this is a personal thing, but having lived in Seattle for short jaunts, I did find that it recalled images of some of the restaurants I visited in the great northwest.  The clean colors, big fireplace, and beautifully polished wood floors and ceiling looked like they would be equally well placed in a snow-logged cabin as they are in North Austin.  The black and white pictures of snow and evergreens only added further to the setting.\\n\\nHere is my bottom line about NXNW.  I think it is the perfect lunch spot.  The prices aren't too high, the food is great for what you pay, and the decor is great.  The next time you are looking to have a quick midday meal on a cold day this winter, give NXNW a try, I'm sure the setting has even more charm when they have that fireplace roaring.  \\n\\nWhy not 5 stars?

We had our first round of drinks and the waitress came by and asked us if we would like another round, and didn't know why the 1 playboy sushi roll we were sharing wasn't ready yet, we said yes to the round. By that time our table was ready downstairs, this was a 40 minute wait, which was not bad considering it was getting busy. We never got our second round of drinks or sushi and we didn't want our table to be given away to someone else, so we told the hostess we were going to go down for our reservation. The waitress and host upstairs was very accommodating and said they would bring our drinks and sushi to our table downstairs. When we got downstairs we had to wait to be seated and we asked that hostess if our table was ready since the yelp app had told us so. She said she was going to seat another couple first and figure out where we were supposed to be. Meanwhile the upstairs host had our tray of drinks and had to wait along side us to be seated. When it came time to order I asked our server if I could get salmon on the salads and she said yes. So I ordered the Caesar with salmon. Another server dropped off our food and I got a Caesar salad with chicken, so she took it back.

For that reason, I think it's fair to give consideration to an establishment which attempts to preserve the history and artifacts of tiki culture.  The Grass Skirt, in conjunction with the Fratenal Order of Moai, has done just that. Paintings, lamps, carvings, and even a stone fountain were salvaged from the now-closed Kahiki Supper Club in Columbus, OH. These items have been incorporated with new designs to create a fun bar with a small out door patio. A wide variety of tiki mugs and glasses are used to serve classic tiki drinks. The drinks are all hand crafted, and use ingredients such as Pernod, bitters, and Fernet Branca to create drinks which are delicious but not too sweet.  Several of their mugs are available for purchase. I emphasize that the Grass Skirt is a bar, because the food is not it's strong point.  Nachos, quesadillas and shrimp appetizers are all ok, but I wouldn't stray too far from those menu items.

I was overjoyed (slight exaggeration) that they still had breakfast. The breakfast menu only had about 6 options, which I like, not a huge fan of a menu that has so many items you find it hard to choose. Additionally, I prefer a restaurant that does a few things well rather than a lot of things poorly. I was torn between a more traditional menu of Irish fare...bangers (which i have never had, but heard of many times), cooked tomatoes and soda bread, and a more American plate of potatoes, eggs, bacon, and Irish toast. Lucky for me (no, really i am so lucky) my lady friend was torn between the same two... Logic quickly dictated we get both and split..I do so love it when a plan comes together. Waitress was friendly and always there, but not in a chatty annoying way. Breakfast came in about 20 minutes, which was great as my lady friend is very easy on the eyes and i was in no hurry to divert my eyes from her to the food (tiny bit smitten). The food presentation was great, simple and attractive on square plates, ya im a sucker for square plates. I split the plates (i recently recieved an ethics lesson from my grandma and was instructed i must do this), the waitress was extremely accommodating in giving us extra plates. \\n\\nNow about the food presentation (if your still reading), the aforementioned bangers were a little disappointing to me...not really my thing. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and moist, very good, soda bread was crisp and toasty warm, probably because it was, in fact, toasted. The bacon was delicious, the rashers were little disappointing, to tough for my taste and i had to spit some out ( yes i created a diversion for my lady friend so she would not have to see this) but in truth i have never had rashers before so maybe this is normal?\\n\\nWell, to wrap this up, the ambience was excellent for a quiet breakfast, the staff friendly, prices were great, service quick and the food was good.

The bar in the back was slow and the servers seemed a bit....overwhelmed. \\n\\nFood- we ordered the fried green tomatoes, which were fine. The marinara is totally the kind you get with your mozzarella sticks at Applebees. Everything was kind of....neutral. With PCM right there, i highly recommend eating before the show.

I know that I risk cross contamination when I eat out, I get that this is a pizza place and it is riskier than most restaurants. however, if you actively claim to have gluten free food on your menus you had better take basic steps to make sure the food is actually as gluten free as possible (I see plenty of places with good practices that still have disclaimers about cross contamination, which is totally reasonable).

I had been searching for a breakfast place on Yelp for the last couple of days, thinking it would be a nice weekend to explore the options in our relatively new neighborhood.  But when my husband decided to cook breakfast, I couldn't turn it down (he's really good... seriously - many of our friends keep telling him to open a restaurant)!  Anyway, around lunch time my husband suggests trying Ball Square Cafe.  His suggestion was based on their lunch menu, but I remembered coming across the place in my search for breakfast food.  Score!\\n\\nOur conversation on the way to the restaurant:\\nMe:  I'm definitely ordering breakfast food!\\nHusband:  I just cooked you breakfast food a few hours ago.\\nMe:  But I want *more* breakfast food!\\n\\nWe managed to find a parking space and walk in just as a table opened up... which in and of itself is so amazing that I just knew this would be a good experience.   We were seated by Mike, who quickly told us about the drink situation.  Even though the coffee bar is self-serve, I think the staff asked at least three times if we needed anything while we stood there figuring out what to drink.  We definitely didn't feel neglected!  \\n\\nOnce we ordered, our food came out pretty quickly, and nothing disappointed!  My pancakes had a light, spongy texture (perfect!), the pork sausage was juicy and flavorful (could have been heated more, though - 'twas a little lukewarm), and the mashed \\"home fries\\" were delicious.  My husband's pastrami sandwich was out of this world!  He got to choose his bread, which proved to be more of a feat than one might think (it took a while for our Texan brains to translate the waitress's question of \\"Light or dark rye?\\" from Bostonese... a constant struggle for us).  The result was a stack of warm, perfectly cooked pastrami surrounded by buttery, toasted dark rye and I don't know what kind of melted cheese.  It was GOOD.  Almost made me rethink my order of breakfast food.  *Almost.* \\n\\nWe left feeling completely stuffed and satisfied, and we didn't even finish all the food.  I look forward to going back and trying other items.  When I go out, I tend to look at what other people are eating, and those omelets look delicious and HUGE!  Or maybe next time I'll *gasp* forgo the breakfast menu and order a sandwich.

However, with such an abundance of other Japanese restaurants appearing not only in the neighborhood, but throughout, I can find the same quality of food for cheaper. The service and people are nice and the ambiance is calming and relatively quiet. I went with my friend and we ordered a few different items. I had the seaweed salad and Unaju and he started with the fried oysters and then had the scallop tempura for dinner. My seaweed salad and Unaju was relatively filling, but a pretty small portion. At $23 for my Unaju, it was served in a box with a few pickles on the side and didn't necessarily have anything to write home about. The fried oysters were well fried and had a great taste though my friend was slightly disappointed at seeing only three morsels. His entree, however, was plentiful. A dozen or so plump and juicy sea scallops were very well fried and served with rice, steamed broccoli, Japanese mayonnaise and the fruit sauce for dipping, it kind of made up for the puny appetizer. In terms of taste, everything was okay, if not eh. After tax and tip, our meal came out to about $70 or so and for the amount of money, there was something left to be desired.\\n\\nThis would be a great place for a date, but once again, why? The menu items are pretty standard Japanese fare: teriyaki, donburi, sushi, noodles, a couple sides. If in the area and REALLY hankering for some good Japanese food without having to travel? Sure. I'd come back, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it and with so many other cheaper, yet equally, if not more, delicious options around, I can't say I'll be back soon."},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Okay, I'm not a bar kind of person.

My friends also tried and agreed.  My friends all enjoyed their meals to an extent, but I don't think anything was stellar.\\n\\nService:\\nThis is the strange part.  The owner (I presume) took our orders.  While trying to be funny, he offended most of the table by critiquing each order and completely disregarding the requests of two people.  Two of my friends ordered and he responded by saying that they would not like it and that he was going to change their order to something that be more suitable for their palate.  Never in my life have I experienced a waiter change a customer's order or treat paying customers in such a demeaning manner.  We ordered dumplings for an appetizer, but they did not arrive until after the final entree was served.  There was at least a fifteen, yes FIFTEEN, minute gap between the arrival of the first and last person's main meal.  We had to ask for tea twice until it arrived. After the check came, we decided that we would not tip a full 15 or 20%.  So horrified by the service (and I by my food), we decided that 10% was more than sufficient.  An older woman came by our table to pick up the bill and actually counted the money at the table in front of us.  She told us that we had to give a 15% tip.  Because this was not on the bill or previously stated, we did not budge.  When she left our table momentarily, we quickly grabbed our coats and rushed out the door leaving the tip which we decided was fair.  This was certainly not one of my proudest moments, but it felt extremely justified.\\n\\nI do not understand how this restaurant is still afloat.  It seemed busy and popular.

To say this place is in demand is an understatement. To make a reservation, it has to be made online on the second Friday of every month at 12pm for the next calendar month. Confused yet? :-) We don't really plan ahead so it was a MAJOR milestone that we went through this process but it was WELL worth it. Within 3 minutes, all reservations are gone for the entire month (every time slot, every day). It's hard to imagine but now that I've experienced it, I get it! The food was impeccable - better than anything I've probably had. The presentation, the stories, the taste, the pairings ...all the food is given so much time, prep and love. It's also funny how everyone in the restaurant takes photos of every dish! It's almost too beautiful to eat. I'm not a foodie so I had not tried half of the ingredients that make up the dishes. Sunflowers and marigolds aren't usually ingredients in my signature dishes, but somehow it made perfect sense with the crab it was paired with. I really loved all of the food, but my favorites were the crab, squash with cornbread combo and the scallops (with cucumber, butterbeans and purslane). Scrumptious. I want to go back asap. Also, final tip, if you are a wine drinker....do not order wine here. Get outside of your comfort zone and order one of their AMAZING drinks! The three of us in the party each had something different and all of them were perfection. Oh and the dessert. The words I will choose wouldn't give it justice but I do have a photo that hopefully shows how good it looks. One thing I didn't like was the seating. Only thing I'd ding the restaurant for...VERY uncomfortable hard seats with no cushion. When you are sitting for three hours, you'd like a comfortable seat.

Well, back then, during the Stone Age, the majority of the restaurants were actually located within the Mall itself, so I guess there was really no need for me to visit very many of the places on the outskirts of the Mall, (plus this was back when Lenox Square had movie theaters - yeah, THAT long ago.) So imagine my disappointment when we intended to hit the Mall's Food Court for some grub, only to find out how they had scaled the eateries WAAAAY back at Lenox, in lieu of including more ritzy shopping.  Well, we ARE talking about Lenox, after all - you can spit from here and hit somebody walking in Buckhead. \\n\\nSo, Houston's being the closest and most convenient place, we retreated there from Lenox Square, hoping to score a halfway decent meal. And we were NOT disappointed. \\n\\nYou walk in, and the interior is all dark, burnished wood, tastefully arranged plants and appropriately muted lighting, PLUS jazz - not smooth jazz one the one end or Miles Davis on the other, but the kind that goes down as well as the absolutely delicious food. \\n\\nOur server, Ebony, was friendly, capable and right on time with everything, including some good suggestions. And the meal was to die for. I had Caesar salad, jumbo lump crab cakes to rival anything that even the best Baltimore or Annapolis has to offer, a fully loaded baked potato with fillings prepared so that it was more about flavors than filling your gut, and a chocolate cake that made me want to go back to the kitchen to find out where it came from, it was THAT good. \\n\\nI'm sorry now that I hadn't been to Houston's sooner - I'd walked past it enough times on the corner.

Not only does this place avoid the standard Thai-food pitfalls (so smothered in sauce that you lose the native taste of ingredients; under/overcooking that distorts consistency), it goes the extra step of presenting a menu full of thoughtful dishes.  By Boston standards, Cha Yen constitutes something special - at an affordable price\\n\\nWe stopped here for lunch and loved it.  We ordered the Roti appetizer, the grilled calamari appetizer, basil eggplant with ground pork and tom yum noodle soup with pork.  Brilliant.  \\n\\nThey grilled the calamari perfectly so that it retained just enough rubberiness to remain squid, but just enough solidity to permit easy chewing success.  We found the attendant sauce (ginger soy) delightful.\\n\\nThey served the Roti with a spot of Thai chicken curry (yellowish sauce).  Both the curry and the Roti rocked.  The Roti presented in a golden brown that flaked off despite remaining moist.  I knew from the first taste of the curry that I would love everything else.  Although a tad sweeter than I typically prefer, I suspect that they home make the curry masala - something about the sweetness tasted real to me.  Sounds crazy, right?  Try it.\\n\\nAlthough I enjoyed the Tom Yum (having grown addicted to the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with Pork at Rod Dee), I still prefer the Rod Dee version.  Thankfully, Cha Yen doesn't overpower the sour goodness of Tom Yum with too much lemongrass.  \\n\\nThe basil eggplant with ground pork surpassed all expectations.  The eggplant remained somewhat crispy on the outside, while soft on the inside (sounds easy, but surprisingly few places accomplish this), while the ground pork (which tends to (i) hold sauce very well and (ii) infuse thai sauces with its oils - and, thereby, an extra dimension of savory goodness) contrasted perfectly perfectly with the egg plant.\\n\\nThe owner informed us that they don't use any MSG.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we live on the other side of Boston, so might not have too many opportunities to eat here."},{"name":"Chris' Caribbean Bistro","address":"4479 S Cobb Dr","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4","text":"Nice spot!

My wife had the Second Deadly Sin -- and trust me, that's all the sinning you need to do!  I paired my sandwich with the Broccoli Beer Cheese soup in a bread bowl.  Let me repeat that, \\"a bread bowl!\\"  San Francisco patrons will be proud of this one.

My most recent and most disappointing visit was for brunch.  I refuse to wait for meals, so restaurants with reservations are a must for brunch in Atlanta where the meal is basically a sport or religion with the level of fervor with which Atlantans approach it.  Needing a restaurant in Buckhead, Bistro Niko fit the bill for a 12:30 brunch on a Sunday.  \\n\\nShockingly, when we arrived, there were literally only two other tables occupied in this cavernous (and gorgeous) restaurant.  They have recreated the French bistro feel perfectly, minus the fact that it is at least three times larger than any bistro I've ever dined at in France.\\n\\nThe service, as it is at all Buckhead Life restaurants, was fantastic.  But the food was just average at best.  A pastry basket to start had only two different items in it (though two of each), which kind of defeats the point of a pastry basket, which I see as an opportunity to sample a variety of items.  And $12 for four small croissants (without even any jam for them) seemed like quite the rip-off.   Moving onto entrees, my salad Nicoise was large, but had little flavor, and the tuna was in teeny tiny little flakes and mixed into the pre-dressed salad greens.  It made it hard to get much protein out of the meal, since I could only finish about the half the salad.

I tend to spend my time in cheap Asian eateries around South Burnaby. So what would have brought me to a place so foreign and out of my comfort zone? A  2 for 1 deal with my tourism pass and my first anniversary. \\n\\n Now, first of all the whole thing was a little intimidating, I had spend the first half of the day in Stanley park so I was wearing comfortable, beat-up shoes and some faded dress pants, the rest of my outfit, however, was pretty classy if I do say so myself. When we walked in I nervously mentioned the pass and she was happy to stamp it... not realizing we wanted to get in on the dinner deal, too. Although when she did she was very sweet and welcoming, apologizing as she showed us to our seats.    \\n \\nBefore we knew it they brought us a beautiful starter of a variety of delicious breads and oh my god, roasted garlic! They took the time to explain each of the breads and then left us to devour it. Somewhere in there they took our orders as well. Really, I could have sat there with the breads and roasted garlic all day. \\n\\nThe meal came right when we were done nibbling on the platter. Perfect timing. Damn, was it good. Perfectly cooked salmon on top of greens and potatoes in that fancy round presentation typical of high class restaurants. It was surrounded with bits of honeyed bacon and topped with crispy salmon skin. The skin was gorgeous, I could eat that skin like potato chips. I'm serious, bag bits of salmon skin like that and sell it to the masses! The salmon itself was rich and hearty and delicious. The potatoes melted in my mouth. Even the greens were awesome.

While walking on Plant Street, a wonderful smell caught my husband's attention. It was the scent of good barbecue, something we rarely smell since moving out of Houston seven years ago. This place looked like a little hole in the wall, but the smell said it all. My husband asked for a small sample, and when the brisket had the appropriate smoky flavor rather than tasting like roast beef, we opted to get lunch there. We got a family meal for $34. It consisted of 1 1/2 lbs of the meats of our choice, two sides, and six slices of Texas toast (which we didn't eat since we're trying to avoid wheat). For meats, we got the brisket, pulled pork, and the sausage. All of the meats were very tasty. For sides, we got their baked beans and fried okra. The baked beans were a mix of several kinds of beans. It tasted like a little meat was thrown in there, and it had a good smoky flavor as well. Different, but very good! We were disappointed with their barbecue sauces and feel there is definite room for improvement in that regard. However, the meat is good enough to eat without it. Tbh, I feel that for that price, you should get more meat-2 lbs would be more reasonable. If my daughter and I hadn't had a late breakfast and not been all that hungry, there would not have been enough food for 3 people, therefore negating the validity of calling it a family meal.

I will assume that was to hide the fact that it was bad fish. I felt sick later that evening and have been sick the entire next day. My friend had the Caesar salad with salmon. She barely ate any of it because the salmon was not cooked to her liking. Perhaps that could have been rectified if the waiter had cared to ask how our meal was. Instead, he was busy hanging out playing around with his pals by the bar. My friend didn't have a knife and when we finally got dude's attention, and asked for a knife, he looked around and just grabbed one off the table next to us. Our plates sat for sometime before being cleared and then once they were, the waiter literally tossed the check on the table. No eye contact and he didn't even break a stride.

Not bad at all. Went with a korma with lamb, tikki masala with lamb, and a garlic naan, both medium. The lamb meat is proper and tender; I rarely order chicken out as it's too easy, and this spot does not have goat, and shrimp I don't care for in Indian-style curry, Thai-curry though, for sure. \\n\\nThe rice is very similar to Clay Pit, which is my #1 in town in terms of Indian food. The tikki masala was legit, closer to Teji's than Claypit or G'Raj Majal, but still better than other spots in town. Roughly the same level as Trader Joe's, which has surprisingly good Indian frozen foods, making any take-out option in town lesser than Teji's a total waste as one can get 4 TJ's Indian dinners for the price of 1 out. The korma at Tarka is close to Claypit but lacked the cashews, so on the level of Nasha. The naan is good, better than Claypit, worse than Teji's, the #1 naan spot I've tried still by a long shot. \\n\\nSo in summation, yeah, this spot is tasty and you won't regret the purchase, plus its close to Core Power Yoga so you can get your korma on after some vinyasa."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wowee!!!!

After another 45 minutes two of us finally received our meals and the third meal arrived  10 minutes later.\\n\\nIt was obvious they were terribly understaffed but unfortunately it wasn't limited to the front of house staff.  My chicken wrap was VERY dry and the limited amount of fries I did receive were lukewarm.  So apparently they were understaffed at both front and back of house positions.  Antonio, our server, was very polite and professional and I did give him a good tip, but I hope he is looking for other places of employment because his talents are wasted here.\\n\\nI have been frequenting Taco Mac's since they started in Virginia Highlands and this is the WORST experience I have ever had.

Me and the man go in there every two or three days, whenever the level of pho saturation in my tissues dips below a comfortable level.

Delicious, fragrant broth, the meat sliced just right, a generous amount of onions, perfectly-textured vermicelli and a TOWER of bean sprouts alongside. The bean sprouts in here always seem really, really fresh to me - never wilty, like they've been sitting out, which is what I've experienced at other places. The meal begins with a pot of tea, and the temperature depends on the weather. On a sweltering day the tea will be iced. On a chilly day, it'll be hot and soothing. \\n\\nI'll be straight with you, I've never had anything other than pho tai and pho ga in here, but both of them are spectacular. People I've been with have ordered other dishes and they've always been amazing as well. The bun with pork and Vietnamese ham is particularly delicious. The avocado shakes are wonderful, and the limeade is very sweet, tart and satisfying. If you want to try something different, try the guanabana or jackfruit shakes, which are tangy and yummy (but avocado with pearls is still my fave). \\n\\nAnh Hong is consistently very clean, which pleases the little obsessive-compulsive gremlins that live inside my head. Service is usually really, really fast unless you go in there on a weekend evening when every table is full. I've never had to actually wait for a table, but the service can slow down a little bit when the restaurant is jam-packed (which is totally understandable). The waitstaff are always very kind to us, and street parking has never been a hassle. \\n\\nI really want to try the Bo 7 Mon, the seven-beef dish, but every time I go in there I become like a pho zombie and it's like I'm physically incapable of ordering anything else.

We weren't seated until thirty minutes after our reservation time.  The scene in front was absolute chaos.  When we were finally seated at a hibachi table, one of our fellow diners was in a fighting mood,  yelling at my fiancee to scoot down using words I can't repeat here, despite there being no room to do so.  After this near brawl and a lackluster salad, our spirits were not high, and our patience was wearing thin.  We were thinking of going someplace else.\\n\\nThank God we didn't.  Things started turning around after I started drinking some delicious cold sake.  Our hot-headed friend cooled off and kept quiet.  Then the chef arrived.  The food was outstanding.\\n\\nScallops, shrimp, chicken, beef -- all noticeably fresh, perfectly seasoned, and entertainingly prepared.  I've eaten at hibachi restaurants before, but I've never had it cooked so perfectly.  My fiancee had never had scallops before.  This meal turned her into a believer.  In between preparing dishes, our chef spiced things up and squirted sake into everyone's mouth.  Normally, I'd write this off as a cheap stunt, but it was fun, it lightened the mood at the table, and tasted really good.\\n\\nHopefully, once Osaka gets more settled in, its front-of-house staff can keep things running smoothly.  Maybe Osaka will even make its salad a little more interesting.

The service is excellent as well."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I live about an hour from Orlando, so every time I go out there to eat I try a different restaurant since there's so many options popping up all the time. \\nHawkers is one of the few I have visited multiple times though.\\n\\nA friend of mine recommended this place as being a good option if you have tried authentic asian food. They have a tapas style menu with smaller portions, but it's actually quite affordable and provides a wide selection of dishes. Their drink menu is also pretty good with a decent selection of beers, though I usually end up sticking to water or tea when I go here. \\n\\nEvery time I go here it's always busy, but service is quite good and prompt. I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table, and once you order it doesn't take them long to bring out the food. \\n\\nThis is truly one of my favorite spots in Orlando. Food is great, service is great, atmosphere is great. The only downside they have is parking, as their lot gets full quickly since they're always so busy, but that won't change my rating of it. I love this place!"},{"name":"Apothecary Cafe & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd, Ste 450","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We were thrilled to have found Apothecary on our last trip to Austin.

Comments below:\\n\\nEdamame (3 stars) good edamame, tough to differentiate one from another\\n\\nCrab Rangoons (5 stars): These were a highlight, delicious\\n\\nVegetable Tempura (4 stars): Very good, lightly fried, included esparagus\\n\\nVolcano Roll (5 stars): Highlight of the meal, delicious roll topped with warm and spicy seafood.  Awesome!\\n\\nHalloween Roll: (2.5 stars) This roll is very popular but not very good.  Pass.  Boring, fruit accents, a lot of tasteless fillers.  We didn't bother eating all of it.\\n\\nPhilly Roll (4 stars) One of the best Philly rolls I've had and the price was right!  Definite recommend.\\n\\nManhattan Roll (4.5 stars) Our second favorite!

The last time i visited, there were two incidents of note.  At our table there were little ants crawling in and around the grill.  At another table, the overhead vent hood crashed down onto the grill table right after the chef finished cleaning it.  It gave the patrons at that table (and the whole restaurant) quite a start...and left some debris in some people's food.  We noticed that they gave everyone at that table a free drink but I hope the bill was discounted as well.\\n\\nYes you should expect families and tourists and no you should not expect fine cuisine.

Room temp water on a not night is not refreshing. Would also be nice if the bread were served warm.\\n\\nMenu is interesting, but a bit pricey for the quality. We ordered the fried stuffed zucchini flowers, but they came extremely greasy and we would not order them again. The chicken rolls stuffed with mozarella and pesto sounded delicious, but was small and tasted fairly ordinary.

It was by far one of my best experience at a Japanese restaurant. Please be advised that you need a reservation to dine here. This place is uber popular for a good reason. Umi has a sophisticated and understated decor in a cozy (smallish) dining room. However, their sitting arrangements are pretty smart so it does not appear that your neighboring diners are ogling at your sushi (although they often do). We decided to go for Omikashi ( semi pre fixed) dinner. It's a decent deal for $120/ per person (without alcohol). My citrus-basily cocktail was just ok but everyone else in our party went for warm sake and loved it. We got to choose 4 appetizers (we went for 5). I loved all of them . We ordered shishito peppers, jalape√±o-yellowfin salad, crispy rice topped with spicy tuna, otoro tartare (could have been more flavorful) and uni tempura (delightfully surprising). This course was followed by a warm shrimp appetizer ( very generous portions) of two different styles. I loved the simple tempura with its uzu-ponzu dipping sauce over what appeared to be shrimp tempura doused in sambal sauce, but that's only because I have had too many sambal shrimps in my life! The sambal sauce is bold and spicy and the uzu-ponzu is refreshing and fresh. This was followed a super generous sampler of delightful sashimi and then warm fishes ( really good quality sea bass and cod but I am not a particular fan of the sweetish miso glaze, everyone else loved them though) and absolutely amazing nigiri platter. My favorite ones were salmon and wagyu ( I am not a uni fan, I trying to like it right now, but success has been limited so far  however those who were, were swooning over it). We decided to have the famed green tea souffl√© for dessert and this mildly sweet, delightfully tea-ish souffl√© made us smile for a very long time. I love  pampering fine dining experiences, but I have never seen such humongous portions that Umi lavishes upon its diners. Umi is pricey for sure, but I'll go back on special occasions with my loved ones."},{"name":"Gators Dockside","address":"5275 Red Bug Lake Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Always good service and excellent food no matter what hour.\\nGreat place to sit down and have a couple of cold ones while watching the fights.!!"},{"name":"Perkins Restaurant & Bakery","address":"6813 Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Very good place to eat!

The seating might not be convenient, but it's an intimate, attractive space with a decent menu and wine list with relatively reasonable prices for a concert venue.  \\nBUT.  Our first, and last, experience here was dismal.  We arrived ten minutes before showtime, were seated quickly, ordered food and drinks, and the show started.  No problem.  Twenty minutes into the performance, someone tapped me on the shoulder and whispered to me that she needed my last name, without explanation.  She walked away, and came back a few minutes later to inform me that we were in the wrong seats.  After a few beats she realized that, since we hadn't just seated ourselves incorrectly, IT WAS THEIR MISTAKE, we might need some help carrying the massive wooden charcuterie board or plates or wine glasses to our actual seats, which were at the table directly adjacent to us.  \\n\\nThe most confusing thing was that this was totally unnecessary.  The only other people at our table were a large group and a pair or women, so we wouldn't have been splitting up a party, they could have just seated the party (WHO WAS LATE) in the seats originally intended for us.  But instead everyone was inconvenienced, the occupants at our new table miffed and so the intimate, friendly vibe evaporated.  We didn't finish our food and tried to enjoy the rest of the show. \\n\\nAt the end of the night, we asked to see a manager. A nice young lady whose name began with a C came over and listened to our tale of woe, apologized, and left.
