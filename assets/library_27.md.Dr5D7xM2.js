Maybe because it was a Friday and the bar area was full.  \\n\\nFor the food, yes it is on the more expensive side but it is a fine dining establishment and the portions are generous.  Each dish was cooked perfectly.  For appetizers we had the foie gras and the amberjack which was sliced thin.  Both were delicious.  The standout though was the soup.  It is a maple butternut squash with shrimp and pumpkin seeds.  I highly reccomend it.  \\n\\nFor our mains we ordered duck cooked two ways and the slow braised beef shank.

This is supposed to be the whole reason to go to the casino. I WANT TO GIVE YOU MAH MONIES! And there are no open tables. Plenty of empty tables, just have to walk around for an hour or so before you can find an open slot at a table. ANNOYING\\n\\n3. Piss poor attitude - The people who work here, OBVIOUSLY hate their job. Our waiter actually said to us, within 1 minute of greeting us, that this is the worst place to work. They do not pay well treat you like crap. WOW.\\n\\n4. Food was ok. typical bar food. Carrot cake was outstanding! Pizza was fair.\\n\\n5. Plenty of parking on a Thursday night.\\n\\n6. The 4 mile radius of the casino is GHETTO SCARY. Kind of depressing. An oasis in the middle of a nuclear bomb testing site.\\n\\nSeriously disappointed. I wish they were better to their people, so the customer was happier. Companies like Hollywood clearly do not understand fundamental customer service. Treat your employees like you treat your number one customer, and your customers will be thrilled.\\n\\nI love to play blackjack with a few buddies, however, I will wait for the next Vegas trip.

Lunch buffet especially offers fried dough, fresh fruits, little cakes, and chicken fingers, but the atmosphere along with the sushi bar says business.  In my younger days it would have also offered an intimate opportunity for a nice date.\\n\\nHours: Monday through Thursday 11 AM to 10 PM, Friday and Saturday 11AM to 11 PM, Sunday 12 PM to 10 PM.\\n\\nExpense Account: Moderate. Figure about $10-$25 each without alcohol.  Pay your server at meal's end.\\n\\nFood: There is an extensive menu here but we chose the lunch buffet.  We are not Chinese buffet aficionados, however, we have eaten here several times on visits to Massachusetts and never suffered a disappointment.  Any buffet tempts you with overeating, but other common buffet faults include drying out on the steam table, a tendency for all the dishes to develop the same savor, infrequent dish rotation, and a tendency of purely American dishes like pizza and French fries to creep into the selections.  Feng Shui keeps small supplies of each dish on the line yet speedily restores fresh quantities when the line overwhelms the groaning board.  Vegetables remain crispy, the sesame chicken crunchy in spite of twice frying, sauces smooth and clear rather than congealed and lumpy.  Unlike other Chinese buffets, several appetizers took advantage of their varied preparations for contrast and reminded me of some fine dim sums in Chinatown.  Steamed dumplings contrasted with their fried cousins, crisp crab Rangoon boasted thin crunchy skins without a drenching of oil. Egg rolls came full of flavor and stuffed with veggies and bits of pork.  Small pots of hot and sour and egg drop soups assured they wouldn't solidify if slow business kept them uneaten.  I prefer a spicier version of hot and sour, but this one comes thick with bean curd and crisp vegetables.  I sacrificed and added my own pepper.  Even the chicken teriyaki on a stick had it's on sweet flavor distinct from the crunch salt and pepper shrimp with its jalape√±os.  The standard fried rice thick with pork, veggies and egg carried a sharper instinctive flavor from the lo mein.  Everything was good and special in itself so that I intentionally took very small portions so I could enjoy every taste.  Feng Shui offers many of the pleasures of a Chinese buffet and few of its pains.  If the buffet is this good then ala carte should be great.\\n\\nFor Non-Carnivores: The buffet boasted lo mein, egg drop soup, a vegetarian stir fry, crispy scallion pancakes, and fruits and salads.  The extensive menu had many options.\\n\\nDifference Dividend: Try the sushi and if you aren't already a fan it could make you one.\\n\\nAdult Beverages: full bar."},{"name":"Pepe's Cantina","address":"120 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for a quick drink before the Rock Hard Review at Hamburger Mary's  Smallish space, but cozy, dark and intimate.

Making a point to only come in with a  buy one meal get one free coupon handy, a coupon I believe can be found in every trash can in any Safeway or King Soopers in Boulder - they're on the back of every grocery receipt, it's tough not to be satisfied with the food and price. Trip one - I powered through a stack of stuffed french toast (dessert inside a breakfast) and country fried steak. I was pretty hungry but I have to confess that this country fried concoction was so good while I was eating it, the gravy was on point, and mixing it with the hash browns and eggs, then the stuffed french toast (it comes with a choice of filling, I think I chose lemon custard) it was truly a great way to end a night. It was around 10:00pm. After the 1st round of debauchery, I ventured into my IHOP partner's pancakes, blueberry, which were pretty tasty too. Gave each syrup a try. I think I'm a traditionally guy, the other ones tasted like a factory. The pancakes were topped with whip cream, as was the stuffed french toast. As I'm typing this, I'm thinking I'm sure they would be happy to put a weird amount of whip cream on your food items if asked nicely. Next time. There was a communication mishap between our server and the cook wherein we received a blueberry pancake instead the strawberry we ordered.

This place is amazing and pretty much every thing I've ordered (which is quite a variety, they have quite the number of options for vegetarians and non-veg alike) has been so good. My absolute favorites, in no particular order:\\n\\n-The Veggie Street Noodle Soup (also available with meat): I haven't been able to find another soup like it anywhere else. It's sweet and a little spicy and peanuty and so, so good.\\n-Sriracha Pad Thai: Honestly I'm not the biggest fan of sriracha, but this is some of the best pad thai I've found in this city. \\n-Garlic Udon: Pure umami deliciousness\\n-Aloha Noodles: Because how can you go wrong with noodles with curry powder?\\n-Bermuda Triangles: These are soft triangles made with chives and even better with the provided dipping sauce!\\n-Triple C: Like a vegetarian crab rangoon filled with cheese and corn. Who even knows where this came from, but they are so good.\\n\\nReally, you can't go wrong here. Word to the wise that the soups are huge (I've pretty much never been able to finish one) but the noodle and rice dishes are pretty much perfectly sized to leave you feeling full but not sick. And as I mentioned in my original review, the lunch special is an absurdly good deal and great for sharing.\\n\\nAlso, the family that runs this restaurant are all so lovely and sweet. Once I ordered delivery and it arrived about 10 minutes late so they threw in two slices of cake to make up for it! Talk about going above and beyond.\\n\\nSo yeah, this place is the absolute best and has more than earned all five stars."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"Yet another place found through Yelp that looks like it's going to be a keeper! \\n\\nFirst things first: the lunch special is serious bang for your buck. I know that's the whole point of lunch specials, but Twelve Hours seriously blows it out of the water. Especially if you get a soup, because they are HUGE. As in, let's-throw-the-whole-pot-in huge. Throw in two appetizers, a salad, and a drink, and you've got yourself more food for 10 bucks than almost anywhere else will give you. I was hungry coming in, but after barely being able to finish half of my soup, I had to admit I may have been better sharing one and just getting a second drink or appetizer. \\n\\nAs for the food itself, it's definitely more than solid. Their menu looks like such an Asian Fusion mishmash with so many options, it had me worried, but both meals I've eaten there have seriously delivered. The Tofu Falls Ramen had a delicious savory broth with veggies and fried wonton skins to give it that extra delicious flare. The noodles themselves were pretty much your standard packaged type, so nothing to write home about. The half an egg in it was hard-boiled, which was a bit of a let down, but at the end of a day an egg's an egg (or, you know, a half of one). I thought the Green Bermuda Triangle would just be your run-of-the-mill scallion pancakes, but they were actually much thicker and fluffier. Definitely my favorite part of that meal. The fried veggie dumplings were also great - I know it's hard to mess these up, but these definitely hit the sweet spot. I also tried a bit of the Street Noodle Soup which was HOT, but delicious in a Thai peanuty sweet goodness way.\\n\\nI came back about a week later for dinner. It's still worth it - especially if you get a soup, but your $10 will only get you an entree after 4. I had the aloha noodles with tofu. I love the combination of noodles and curry spices, so this dish made me very happy. The slightly charred udon noodles gave it an extra edge. Portion size aside, I definitely preferred these to the soup, but I would still love to try other soups, especially since all their selections have vegetarian alternatives. \\n\\nThe one thing I'm definitely avoiding in the future is the boba. The housemade Thai Ice Tea was great but the texture on the boba was just all wrong - too dense and not chewy enough.\\n\\nThis won't deter me from coming back, but being the party pooper that I am, I'm not too into their gorey Halloween decorations. Plus, they were one thing on my first visit the Friday after Halloween but then this weekend they were still up.

I also understand, from my local dining companions here, that Davio's is considered a very good Italian restaurant in Boston. It's obvious from the atmosphere here that they would like to bring a high-end style of dining here to Logan. So for that reason, even though I enjoyed dinner here, I'm going to be a little picky, because I'm sure they want to make a good place better.\\n\\nI had very few problems with my meal. My only comment is that the strip steak I ordered, medium, came out \\"not all medium.\\" The two pieces that were obviously from the end were well done, and the piece from the inside was closer to rare. Again, not bad, just a bit inconsistent. The Brussels Sprouts with bacon were a bit more done (and softer) than I like, but the flavor was good.  I thought, at $16, cocktails were a couple of dollars higher than they should be, but for a few dollars less, a nice pour of wine was fine.  The bread \\"cubes\\" that came with the meal weren't anything special, but the olive oil accompanying it was really good.\\n\\nService overall was very professional, but since this is a place where there will be a focus on service, I offer a couple of comments that I admit are nitpicky. I noticed when you ordered steak here, you have options for sauces and garnishes. I think my server should have asked if I wanted any. I remembered a couple of minutes after I ordered, flagged her and told her, and it still didn't come with my meal (but I got it when requested - horseradish - and it did enhance the taste). Finally, I don't know if the rules are different at an airport, but I thought that if they were going to offer you seating at the bar or in front of the kitchen area, they were supposed to ask you if that was okay.  But at least seated there, you got a coat hook and an outlet. \\n\\nUpdate: A couple of days after writing my review, I removed my original comment regarding a lack of a steak knife. Since this restaurant is beyond TSA, they probably can't give customers steak knives. So for that reason, I'm glad my steak was tender enough to cut with a table knife.\\n\\nWould I eat here again?

He then proceeded to presumptuously ask everyone what they were going to eat. When most of us said we were just drinking or we weren't sure yet, he addressed us one by one with sarcastic jokes like \\"are you on a diet?\\". At that point we told him to go take a hike. We were celebrating and had already spent $400 at Sapore. We were more than prepared to keep the party going and they lost out on a large bill because of snobbery and rudeness. And the best part of the experience was that the AC was broken so not only did we get to be disrespected but we also got to sweat through our shirts. Awesome. The one item I did eat here was the guacamole which was beyond spicy yet had absolutely no flavor. Pain on a chip. Just awful. I will admit however that the mango margarita was really good. But that's not nearly enough when you have Temazcal right down the street. They have the best Mexican food in Boston. Trust me, go there.

I have been a patron of Petunia's for years as I am often in the neighborhood and a long time Portland resident. I stop in for coffee / tea because they don't charge extra for dairy substitutions, and I really appreciate that. Especially when someone across the street charges $1.50 for for almond milk. \\n\\nEach time I step foot in the door I can't help but feel a little happier at the cheerful colors and the cute pastries in the case. Even when I just want coffee I often have a little treat, because who can resist?\\n\\nCome back off that cloud though, because they are rarely friendly here. Largely impatient and seemingly unhappy. No smiles, and sometimes even rude. Where is sunny, happy Lisa the owner who boasts about wanting to help people? Who knows! \\n\\nSo, I have a birthday dinner I am hosting for a vegan friend. Against my better judgement - I call up Petunia's and place an order for a cake that is a little expensive but fine - I was quoted half the price at Sweetpea Baking Company but opted to go with Petunia's as it was closer to me for pick up with a busy schedule.\\n\\nWhen on the phone, I say that it's a little difficult to see the end results of their custom cakes as they don't have them online and there are only a few on instagram. I tell them I want the cake to be pretty, and they assure me it will be so. I believe them, since the ones in the case look so nice.\\n\\nWhen I pick up the cake, I am disappointed as it looks unfinished. I sent the picture to a friend of mine who owns a very successful GF/Vegan bakery in Vancouver Canada to ask her thoughts / make sure I'm not overreacting. She agreed it was \\"underdressed\\". I'm not a dramatic person, and it's not the end of the world, totally fixable. It's just cake.\\n\\nI go back in and calmly let them know I was feeling it was a bit lackluster and asked if they could help to fill it in with more fruit or icing between them. I am informed the bakers have gone home for the day, which makes sense as it's late afternoon. I am also informed this is the style of cake. I completely understand whimsy and simple design, but I think this fell flat. In any case, can you please just add more?\\n\\nAfter some impatient back and forth and a trip to the back room, they hand me back my cakebox with the lid closed and a little reluctance in letting me view the fix.

We arrived at 5:30, 2.5 hours before close, and there were just a few sweet pickles left, no garlic or otherwise pickles. Some okra, some carrots, but PICKLES, quickly 0. They were out of sweet by the time our food arrived. The pickle bar was a big reason we came, so that was a huge downer. \\nHalf a star for the fried pickle appetizer being $7 and being basically one small woman's handful of chips. It was also advertised as being 3 kinds of pickle, and we could taste only one. I suspect the entire kitchen was running low on pickles for the day and we received probably a worse version of this app because of that.\\nAnd half a star for the CC terminal defaulting to 18% tip or more. If you want to leave less than 18%, you have to calculate it in your head. That is not only suuuuper tacky, but also highway robbery with 18% on $7 1/3 full basket apps. I custom calculated because f that noise but it was obnoxious. \\n\\nThe food? It was great. I'd pay $12 for the chicken sandwich or the pickle fried chicken in a heartbeat. I'd pick a different side for the PFC, as the green beans were meh, but $12 no problem, particularly if the pickle bar was stocked. I'd have paid $4 or less for the amount of pickles in my appetizer, so that I won't be getting again. \\n\\nKind of a mixed bag, great food at an ok price but we had driven out specifically for trying the pickle bar, and finding it not only empty but remaining empty the whole hour or so we were there was disappointing. If you love fried chicken, it's worth a stop. If you love pickles, maybe call ahead and see where they are on pickle supply before you go. And come prepared to do some math if you don't want to tip 18% on sight-unseen service right as you order."},{"name":"Bangkok Bistro","address":"433 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"delish! their delivery minimum is only $10 and i think delivery is $2, which is cheap compared to other restaurants nearby. this is one of the only thai places around that has kua gai, which is my favorite thai dish. and they make it with chicken and squid, which is amazing! the taro custard is out of this world, too. you can also get a sizable container of garlic rice for $2, which is great for a snack or a side to salmon/chicken at home. my roommates and i frequent the laundromat across the street and sometimes pick up a container to nosh on together with some thai tea. one of my go tos in the area!"},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great happy hour with $5 margarita pizzas and discounted beer.

When the dish came out, the portion size was certainly much smaller than we expected and we quickly realized these were pork tenderloins (OBVIOUSLY... how did we not pick that up?). In terms of flavour, it was good but to be quite honest, its hard to make pork tenderloin particularly incredible (just my preference). I definitely wouldnt order this dish again, especially at its price point of $23. \\n- Carnitas taco 5/5: Well this is a surprise! I did not expect a whole runny egg to be in this delicious taco. This was a flavour explosion. Lots going on with an incredible parmesan queso sauce, tender pork, and runny egg. \\n- Flourless chocolate Truffle cake 2/5: We were told this was a dense chocolate cake that had a consistency of mousse. I was intrigued with this oxymoron of a description, and as a chocolate lover, I decided to take the plunge. THIS WAS DENSE. Almost too dense that it takes away from the chocolate flavour. I love the bitterness and complexity of chocolate, but when you have a cake thats this DENSE, the texture takes over.

BUT, I don't feel that my review should be discredited, as I love trying new things and am a pretty amenable person. I have been to the casino 5+ times since it opened; mainly because my parents are huge fans and also to see a few free shows. Visually, this place is amazing. I was happy to come here the first few times just to check out what the inside looked like. Those crazy ball lamp things hanging from the ceiling are so cool! Oooh, shiny. Over the course of several visits, here are the pluses and minuses that stick out in my mind:\\n\\nPlus: FREE MUSIC. I have seen En Vogue and Blue Oyster Cult here for no monies. If you are coming to see a band, get here early and stake out a good spot. Don't even think about trying to get a drink though, because the lines will be crazy. The stage is kinda small. \\n\\nFree soda. Drink your brains out. Insider tip- they don't check your bags at the door, so maybe bring some booze in your pocket? You didn't hear that from me. Also, free parking!\\n\\nLots of cheap slots. I don't know much about table games and I'm generally miserly/paranoid about losing money, so I just play the slots for an hour or two. \\n\\nCons: Decline in the quality of the food. I've eaten at the Oh! Grill a few times, especially when they had their Thursday night pizza deal (haven't been in about 6 mos so I'm not sure what the status is). I would say that it has declined in the quality for the price. I did once have small plates in the bar area of The Final Cut, which at the time was a nice way to try some of the higher end food for less than a million dollars. Their bar menu has become much shorter since then. \\n\\nAbysmal booze situation. The beer is expensive, and while there are plenty of little beer stations dispersed around the venue, you can only get one beer per person. Oh, and the bar? There only seems to be one. So, if you want a mixed drink on a weekend night you had better try to elbow your way through the huge crowd and spend 30 minutes waiting for your drink. \\n\\nPricey table games. Looking to check out a new game? Never played poker at a table before? Don't even bother. It's cost prohibitive to play if you don't know what you're doing. \\n\\nOverall, I would say it's worth coming here at least once if you have yet to check it out.

Our server noticed he didn't like it and had no issues with removing it from our bill. He got the crab cakes instead and was much happier.  For dessert we split the pecan pie ice cream cake.

I had to immediately rush to the computer to quickly write this review in case any other poor soul would have to sacrifice their taste buds and well-being by walking into this restaurant.\\nThe food sucked. It just completely sucked (I will elaborate later on). The service was beyond horrendous, I've never actually been in a restaurant where I was afraid to ask the waitress for help. The waiting time took approximately 1 hour. One whole freaking hour for a burnt burger and under-cooked day old fries .\\nI ordered their veggie burger which consisted of two portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, and \\"max's sauce\\" whatever the hell that is. Waited about 15 minutes for a coke and a chocolate milkshake (probably the only edible thing there). The burgers finally came and to my dismay the buns were burnt to a crisp, I took the first bite in hoping for something wonderful, boy was I ever so wrong. All I tasted in my mouth was burnt charcoal like tasting particles, sorry I can't call this food. The whole veggie burger was made of two pieces of black burnt mushrooms, and burnt tomatoes. My poutine was ice cold, even the gravy was cold! And to top it off the fries were under-cooked, stale, and old.\\nI finally mustered up the courage to ask the raging asian looking waitress (super slim girl with knee high white socks??) to kindly reheat my fries. She gave me a look of death and grabbed the poutine off the table. Maybe they should name this place Nazi Burgers instead, because it sure felt like I was under that regime. About 20 minutes later she returned with a new poutine, the fries were still old, undercooked, and stale, the gravy was actually hot this time but the cheese curds were yet again ice cold. Have they ever thought about defrosting the damn things before serving them? Mmmm, are cold cheese curds with your warm fries and gravy suppose to be considered good?\\nThe one hour wait time was the final cherry on top of this regretful visit to this restaurant. I don't mind waiting for food, especially if the quality of it means you would have to wait 1,2, or even 3 hours. But this was just unacceptable.

There are only two sizes, regular and bigger than regular. But the regular is actually a substantial size. Compared to Kung Fu Tea'a medium (which I personally consider small), it's significantly bigger. I like switching between the Honey Jasmine Milk Tea and the Honey Milk.

I was amused that the bartender was warning every new customer about the prices of the beer, and since they are a little higher than your average Irish Pub, he was probably trying to help customers avoid the sticker shock when they got their bills. Of course being in a hotel near the airport you can just expect this inflated price. They did have a special, so I just went with that one.

I'm obsessed with their veggies, so it's perfect for me. I have gotten this entree at other locations and the portion of veggies is huge and very satisfying. However, I think the chef made a mistake and unfortunately I had to suffer the consequences. One of the people at the shared hibachi table ordered her meal with NO veggies, extra of something else. So when they portioned everything out, I believe this was accounted for. Well, even though the chef stated she was getting no veggies, he gave her a big portion instead. I then got a whole portion less than I was supposed to get (honestly it looked more like I just got my veggie side). Look, they give you a lot of food, that's true, but this was my entree, not my side, so if I'm paying for it, it's what I want to receive. \\n\\nNo, I didn't say anything to management, I considered it, but I really didn't want to make a scene in front of the table (especially being there alone). \\n\\nThe food was good, don't get me wrong, but I just think the other locations do a better job.

Then tragedy occurred and my cup was broken so I brought it into Jamba with me. They replaced it BUT I was told they no longer had my lovely screw lid. I got their red Pacific NW cup with a pop on lid, no straw and I hated that damn thing from the getgo - plus, it legitimately fell over two different times (while full) at my gym and the lid just popped off....ugh...\\n\\nI was honestly a bit happy when the stupid thing turned tragic and cracked (and I only every handwashed it etc). I needed to run an errand at another mall spot and thought - oh hay, might as well see if Jamba will replace my cup and I will drink my lunch! The sweet gal was super and checked with her manager but what I was even more grateful for was the under the row of the crappy Pacific NW red cups were a simple screw lid cup that said Jamba on them with a straw.

Possibly the best take on Taiwanese fried chicken I've ever had in Texas. It tastes pretty close to the original flavor you would get in Taiwan and the portion is pretty decent. \\n\\nMilk Tea with tapioca: The best thing about their milk tea is that you can actually taste the \\"tea\\" part of the drink. Many places use powdered milk tea and it just doesn't taste the same. Their tapioca is the right amount of chewiness and really delicious!\\n\\nBrick toast: It looks super sweet, but it's actually not!

When our food finally came out it was lukewarm at best. Mary's wings tasted like Crisco. My bbq turkey wings didn't taste like bbq turkey wings. Their only point was the fact that they were tender. I couldn't even find one other good thing to say about them. The mac & cheese was bland, It would be nice if I could actually taste the cheese in it.

The meal itself was flavorful, chicken wasn't too doughy, and even though I can eat a lot, I had a dinner and a lunch the next day.

I never knew before reading the reviews here and checking out Mongolian Grille's website that the price was only for one trip through the line.  I've always gone back for seconds and never gotten charged extra.  Go me?\\n\\nSo I was about to compare this place positively to buffets, but I guess I really can't since it's apparently not a buffet.  Still, it be good grub.  The price is a bit stress-inducing, now knowing it's only for one bowl.  Tip:  If you can't get there for the \\"cheap\\" M-F lunch, go for lunch on a weekend day when it's still less than $10.\\n\\nOkay, so I was going to make funny about buffets, and I'm still going to.  You can, actually, get as many plates as you want at Mongolian Grille, but they supposedly charge you an extra $3 if you get more than one plate... unless you're me, I guess.  (FYI:  Get one of their Lucky Seven cards.  Once you've eaten there seven times, you get the eighth meal free!)  \\n\\nI really hate buffets, not because the food usually sucks eggs, but because I can never eat my money's worth at one.  Much akin to a Simpsons episode, my uncle Gary once got booted out of a buffet for eating too much.  I obviously did not inherit his gastric prowess.  Uncle Gary was the one who introduced me to Mongolian Grille.  We went to the one at La Frontera.  He ate a respectable amount but didn't go overboard.  I absolutely fell in love with the food; it was a whole lot better than I'd imagined it would be.\\n\\nI actually dislike the fact that I live so close to this 183 location because I am very tempted to go there as I drive home from work every day.  ...will power...   The few times per year that I dine there, I typically walk instead of drive so that I can, y'know, walk off them calories.\\n\\nI always know exactly what I want in my bowl... until I get to the sauce area.  Yeah, I've seen their recommended sauce recipes, but I'm one of those independent people who thinks she can do it just fine her own way.

Bad thing for a diabetic, but I figured I'd followed my diet all week like a good girl, so what the hell.  Ohhhh, those Belgian Cream Puffs!  I'm sure those things are bought in bulk at Sam's Club, rather than being made on-site, but they're still good.  And when they're free, who cares if they're not made in house?

The service was friendly  and quick, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. \\n\\nThat all being said, later on that same afternoon, I started having atrocious sausage pizza farts while on the way to the coast. While, the pizza from Pizza Caboose had been quiet delicious and satisfying, it was almost certainly also the culprit that caused some of the worst bowel pain I have had in years. And the experience was no more pleasant for my brother, whose passenger side window was unfortunately out of commission at the time, and would remain in the \\"shut\\" position for the 90-minute ride. The farting continued and it was awful, until eventually, about midway through the coastal mountains, I got a little more than I bargained for, and with a mighty push, I sharted in my pants. As a result, I had to throw out my underwear and donate the pants to Goodwill. And my brother may still be suffering from PTSD after experiencing the horrors of that eventful trip, as he still seems jumpy whenever I let out a fart during a car ride.\\n\\nAnd once again, I cannot reiterate enough: superbly friendly service and deliiiicious pizza.

The spicy chicken is spicy!! They do not mess around with spice here. Hot means HOT! I went with the beef option which was very thinly sliced pieces of beef that were very tender. They also offered pork and regular chicken. Nothing compared to Chipotle or anything like that.. this is one of a kind! Then you get as many toppings (cold veggies) as you want!

One of our tables did not like the salad that much, but the rest of the party loved it. \\n\\nFor the luncheon entree selection, there were salmon, roasted chicken, chuck steak, and pork belly option. My favorite and a lot of people's favorite was the Pork Belly dish! I was glad I had asked the waiter as he recommended it before I ordered. The slice of pork was juicy and flavorful. The fat just melted into our mouths as we devoured the dish. Other guests also liked the other options as well, but the pork belly stole my heart!\\n\\nAs a final star of the event, the berry custard cake was also very good. It looked gorgeous, and the berry tasted very fresh. It was a nice blend of custard and fruit, and served as a light touch to end the lunch!\\n\\nThank you again to Salty Sow for hosting my graduation lunch. Thanks to the staff, waiters, and all the chefs who were there making the event so spectacular!"},{"name":"Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen","address":"230 West Mitchell Hammock Rd","city":"Oviedo","stars":"2","text":"Saw this on the way home from work on Sunday.  Never saw it before and figured it was a new store.\\n\\nWe love Popeyes, much prefer them over the other fried chicken places.  We especially like their side items, their mashed potatoes are awesome as is their cajun rice.\\n\\nWe stopped in here late, it was 9pm.  We were immediately greeted.  We could see they were still in set up mode and I asked the cashier if they were new.  She said yes, that today was their first day of business.  We could tell as they still didn't have everything fully functional just yet.  Had to get the sweet tea from the back (sweet tea and fried chicken is one of the best combinations of food-drink ever!) as well as the sporks.  Looks like they were still getting their systems in place.\\n\\nWe ended up getting tenders, a 3 piece and some sides.  The food was consistent with what Popeyes has become known for and that's a good thing.  I believe one of the biggest things about eating at a chain is the consistency of the food.  Great flavor to their mashed potatoes and cajun rice, it has been for the 25+ years I've been eating Popeyes.\\n\\nIt was a great friendly attitude displayed by all the employees at the store.  I think with that attitude, they will succeed.  We will definitely go back unless it takes a 180 turn for food and service.  Surprisingly, this is the only Popeyes we have been to in recent memory where the AC wasn't blasting us to the arctic.

The only complaint is that she didn't split the bill like I asked - in fact, she was the first to ask 'whose bill' the shots would go onto.  There's was no auto-gratituty for our table of 8 - but in the confusion of calculating and spliting the bill, I think I way over-tipped her.  Not a huge deal - but it was not fun trying to do math with a few beers and several shots of liquor in your stomach.\\n\\nNot sure if I dig the vibe of this place all that much (it has the character of a big-box electronic store) - but with relatively easy and free parking nearby and $4 daily specials, it's not bad.

The decor is pleasing and the place is kept clean. The restaurant seems mall on the outside but can seat more people than I expected when I went in.\\n\\nThe food here is fantastic. So far I've had their shoyu duck ramen, hamachi truffle, and pad thai. I also got to try a few bite of a friend's seafood ramen. My favorite was definitely the shoyu duck ramen. It included an egg even though it wasn't listed on the menu. The duck was amazing with the perfect amount of crisp on the skin and a layer of fat right underneath it. The broth was rich and flavorful. After reading all the good words about the hamachi truffle, I decided to split one with my friend as well. It was ok. Not really a fan of raw fish so maybe that's why I didn't go crazy over it, but I still appreciated it. Like everything else, the hamachi truffle tasted fresh. The pad thai was good and in the top percentile of pad thai that I've had but it was not my favorite. I would stick to the ramen instead. Even though I thought my friend's seafood ramen was good, I still liked my duck ramen better so I highly recommend getting that. \\n\\nThe reason why this place is a 4 star instead of a 5 is because of the service (3/5). The server was friendly, but it just took so long. I didn't time myself the first time I went, but the second time it took 45 minute from the time we were seated to the time we got our food, and this was before the dinner rush hit. The first time we had some people in our party that were in a rush and asked to pay early, but it still took them a long time to get their checks. \\n\\nOverall, I think the food is a great value.

Deep-fried to perfection, the prawns were coated in a light and crispy batter.\\n\\nThe Chicken Teriyaki ($9.95) was prepared exactly how we like it - perched on a large bed of bean sprouts and served on a sizzling hot plate. I love when chicken teriyaki has a nice crispness to the skin.\\n\\nThe Sockeye Salmon Oshi ($10.95) was seared which gave it a nice rich, oily, and buttery texture. I like that they don't use too much rice in their oshi sushi pieces but this also means they're a bit on the small side.\\n\\nLoved how the Sockeye Salmon Carpaccio ($12.95) was presented. Their sashimi pieces are pretty solid and this dish had a bit of a kick from the jalape√±o slices but it was tempered with the mayo drizzle that they use.\\n\\nLast up on our first visit was the Gommae ($3.95) which is a simple appetizer of boiled spinach with sesame dressing. I think they might have overdone it a bit with the dressing though.\\n\\nI found myself in the area about a month later and dropped by for lunch again. It was pretty hopping here and it seems like they do a lot of takeout orders as I could see a number of delivery drivers coming by to pick up their orders.\\n\\nRemembering how good their oshi sushi was, I ordered the Unagi Oshi ($9.95). As previously mentioned, their oshi sushi tends to be on the small side but I do like that they don't use too much rice. This dish was nice and creamy with just a hint of spiciness.\\n\\nI also decided to order their BBQ Salmon Kama ($4.95) which is the neck or collar area of the fish. While there's a bit of work involved with all of the bones, the meat here tends to have a lot of buttery oiliness (which I enjoy). For the price, these were really large pieces."},{"name":"Bravo Pizzeria","address":"531 Washington St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is awesome!

Well everything except the Brussels sprouts. Literally come here for them. Anyways...today I decided to go with Bacon scallops, poutine, and a butterscotch boudino.\\n\\nBacon scallops were perfectly cooked scallops wrapped in bacon on top of chicken liver, and the most amazing honey truffle apple salad. I did not think the chicken liver was a good addition to the meal but the apple salad was the perfect touch of sweet and refreshing needed to balance out the meal. \\n\\nThe poutine on the other hand was a little bit of a let down. It was a good change from the usual duck fat fries but not as good. The beef on the poutine was slow roasted and good but the chicken neck bone gravy was not reduced enough. It was a little too watery for my taste. \\n\\nNow on to the butterscotch boudino. Think of the sea salt caramel frap from Starbucks but more Carmel and with a chocolate almond biscotti. The slightly bitter biscotti balance out the dessert wonderfully.\\n\\nThis place is always a joy. Great service and great food.

The chili on the chili dog was basically like sauteed ground beef with a little salt and pepper.

Somewhat slow service, but you could walk up to the bar and order, too.

I've met some awesome people, done some embarrassing things that were caught on camera, and become more prone to trying out new places...to Yelp them.\\n\\nAnd so I came to eat at Rock Sugar noting weird little things.\\n\\nThe decor is nothing special.  Not grungy or anything, just sort of meh.  There's an aquarium which I thought was empty until the one sad little fish moved around, a cooler, sad broken plastic chairs, and eensy plastic tables with pictures of food on them.  Add to that the lackluster AC and I wasn't planning on eating there.  \\n\\nThe ordering set-up is rather odd since the place is so small.  You walk in and there's a line of people waiting.  So I waited, only find out that was the line to get the food.  You have to wade through them to get to the cashier first.  Oops.  It's not a big deal but the layout could be better.  \\n\\nI ordered the vegetable curry with brown rice and a tangerine white tea.  $13.  I looked at the price of the curry on the board $8. Wow, rice and tea are $5, but whatever.  After 15 minutes standing and sweating I was back on the street.  The wait was a bit much (mainly thanks to the heat) but I am a firm believer that good food is worth waiting for.  Now it was just about finding out whether or not the wait was worth it.  It was.\\n\\nThe curry was sweet and spicy, not overwhelming in either respect though.  Damn good.  Rice was cooked to perfection, still a slight crunch to it and sticky enough to stand up to a good drenching of curry.  Even the vegetables managed to stay crisp and lively all the way back to the office which was great.  Over all the food was damn good there just wasn't very much of it.\\n\\nAssuming the tea was $3 my meal was $10 and came in a small container.

There's a band on a decent size permanent stage. The island bar has about 5 bartenders and a bar-back keeping folks quenched. The staff was friendly, and un-alienating to a new guest. I grabbed an open bar stool(chair) at the end near the entry door. 3 TV's directly ahead of me over the liquor. I could see edge to edge TV's ran both lengths of the same display. Along with a few scattered about the outside perimeter, there must be about 18+ TV's showing sports and follies. \\nThe stage is positioned in the rear right. Professional light and sound set-up. Easily visible from anywhere in the bar. The quartet looked comfortable on stage, without crowding each other's space. 5 may be tough, unless someone(keyboards) may have to stay in the back by the drummer. The cover band(Alternative Nation) was very entertaining with their 90's Hits. Many of the crowd were singing along. I liked that I did not have to scream, or close talk the bartender to order. Don't get me wrong, they were rocking out with volume, but perhaps my seat in the back was ideal for me.\\nSpeaking of the back seat... I wish there was a door windbreak. That wind or chill rushed through frequently as the door was in motion. Other points of interest include one pool table, one pinball machine, one video arcade game, a jukebox, and Keno. A large chalkboard wall on the far wall seemed to display nightly specials, happy hour, and taco Tuesday. To the side I noticed patrons coming and going through an exterior door(without the breeze). If I had to guess, I would say an enclosed, heated patio for smokers. I can not answer if there are TV's out there also. *A unique note of interest was the power stations posted around the bar top. Charge your devices. Cords provided. Is this necessary because patrons leave when their device is dead?\\n\\nAre you wondering if this is your demographic? I saw young people that should be carded before every drink. Middle age, and older couples were all hanging around the 20 somethings. This must be the kind of place where all are made to feel welcome.\\n\\nI did not sample the food, but saw standard hot bar snacks coming out from the back. I tried a pint draft that lacked a head on it. A different brand pint gave the same results. I observed this was common to every pour that night. One taste confirmed that they they were serving less than cold drafts. Thank goodness that neglect does not follow into drain stench. These two usually go hand in hand, but I did not get that whiff. I was denied A chilled Cabo Wabo tequila. They weren't out, they didn't even know what the bottle looked like to know if they ever carried it. I will say that the staff was attentive enough to ask if I needed another, after another had recently done the same, and gone to remedy the quench. Switching to a mixed drink, based on the observation of free pouring. Not overly strong, just more on the generous side, than short. Again with the neglect. Please Brix your soda guns. The vendor can, or with a simple device(provided by vendor) and screwdriver, you can maintain your own. The ratio's were off.

Or, at least all the components that make it up.  I HAVE to have the prepper in the kitchen that de-leaves the brussel sprouts.  That's got to be a tedious job removing each tiny leaf perfectly and then cooking them to tender crunchy goodness.  And for $4 at happy hour???  I picture a tiny little brussel sprout sweatshop back there.  I could take you away from all that, baby.\\n\\nI wanna marry the bartender, who made me all those tasty French 75 type drinks (I forgot their porcine name on the menu) and who also thought to stuff blue cheese in pickled okra for Bff's Tito martini, AND who made such a fantastic Old Fashioned made with maple flavored bourbon, orange rind and of course, the one perfect large ice cube.  I can't stand whiskey or bourbon.  I won't even let Hubby kiss me with a whiskey mouth.  But not only did I smell this drink and immediately wanted to dab it on my pulse points and maybe put it in my sock drawer as a sachet, but I tasted it and it was DELICIOUS!  None of that super sweet bourbon taste.  It was almost like a spiced tea.  And all those wonderous drinks were $6 at HH.\\n\\nI wanna marry the meatmeister (what girl wouldn't?).  Anybody that can make chicken liver pate palatable to ME has got skillz ya'll.  I was convinced that pate of any sort was nasty.  But I could no longer ignore the groans and squirmings coming from BFF after tasting this pate in a jar.  I dipped my fork in and lo and behold that was literally like a mousse, the herby chicken flavor just melts on  your tongue.  Would I eat a whole jar of it?  No, but I did eat a few bites and Bff ended up taking the rest home and HE ate a whole jar of it (again for $6. What??!) \\n\\nWe also ordered the charcuterie plate, another area where the meatmeister shines.  I told Bff ahead of time that he could have all the chicken liver mousse (we already know now that didn't happen), the country style pate, and the head cheese.  My daddy used to make me eat head cheese growing up....this is the man that would try to float squirrel by us in stew.  He told me head cheese was cheese so of course I tried it.  Spoiler Alert:  it ain't cheese.  In fact this was Oscar Meyer head cheese so I remember it being almost like one of those pimiento loafs or something equally disturbing, with little jellie pockets and crunchies in there.  But at the Salty Sow, THIS AIN'T YO DADDY'S HEAD CHEESE.  It was another little mound of herby tender meat, not at all processed or pressed.  And it was served with spicy mustard.  Quite tasty (I can't wait to tell Dad!).  The STAR on the charcuterie board, tho, was the pastrami salmon.  Very rare, melty, briny salmon coated in pastrami spices.  Next time we go back we getting that on its on as an app. \\n\\nI wanna marry the dessert chef.  This person is brilliant.  When you go, and you MUST, always save a little room for the Popcorn Pots de Creme.  A sweet little pot filled with a creme brulee style custard, topped with salted caramel and popcorn.  It was like Cracker Jacks and Sugar Smacks had a love baby in my mouth.  I literally did the When Harry Met Sally orgasm at the table, banging my spoon down, groaning, flipping my hair side to side (much to Bff's eternal embarrassment).  \\n\\nFinally I wanna marry our waitress, Kara.  She was so friendly and efficient,  made me wanna sing \\"Kara, you're a fine girl.  What a good wife you would be!\\"  I did in fact propose to her when she brought out dessert.  I told her, if she just got me one of those pots every day she'd never have to work again.  I think she was tempted.  She also very sweetly brought us out some champagne to celebrate my birthday.  She got extremely busy as the evening progressed but all I had to do was flash a smile at her and she'd be right there for us.  \\n\\nI wanna marry the whole package.  Everything that nite was perfect and I can easily see us celebrating our 25th anniversary in Spain, the Capital of Jamon.  Hubby won't mind this new marriage.  He knows my love for salty meat and he can't hold it against me :)\\n\\nSalty Sow, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.  a kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh......mmmjghjakjlksaltysowjjjsshzzfjljaljsaltysowzzzzzzzzz"},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Surprisingly very tasty treats that didn't have the typical grainy/dry texture that is usually found in GF treats.

The negative reviews below don't take into account that Tuscan Hills apparently just opened a few weeks ago, and with any new restaurant one needs to expect modest hiccups and a grace period to \\"work out the kinks.\\" Also, we're not in a prime spot on Washington St. in Salem or in Downtown Boston, but rather a modest shopping plaza next to a Dunkin Donuts on Route 35. Overall, wait-staff were very friendly, dishes were flavorful, and everyone at our table left satisfied with their varied dishes of pastas, pizzas, and chicken. \\n\\nThe menu is classic Italian fare, though both the menu and waitstaff boast of homemade pastas. I dived straight in for the classic Chicken parmigiana, which if an Italian restaurant messes this dish up is a serious red flag. However, I was very pleased with the two large (read: huge) slices of pan fried chicken that were cooked just right. It was served over angelhair pasta, with a nice red sauce. Others ordered the Chicken Florentine in a white wine sauce served over freshly made fusilli. Pizzas were also well-prepared in a brick oven in view of the dining area. Bread could have been better with a rather boring basket of rolls and olive oil. For appetizers, tomatoes on the bruchetta were excellent, calamari without lemon or sauce was standard, and antipasto just typical.\\n\\nTuscan Hills has a full bar with a wide ranging drink menu. The only downside was a beer list, which was quite limited, especially on the draft side. Hopefully, this will be expanded as the restaurant grows. \\n\\nIt's not a romantic place, especially with pop radio blaring overhead with commercials and all, but Tuscan Hills fits the bill for a local neighborhood Italian restaurant with a solid meal, good value, and friendly staff. There are also several large TVs in the bar area to watch a game or catch the news. The open kitchen concept reminds me of Bertucci's and it's great to see the chefs at work."},{"name":"Sejuiced Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1958 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"What do I love about this place?

The interior of this place is very modern and very spacious. There's lots of seating and lots of open space. Great place to do work/study. There are tables, pod like tables, tables in the back, sitting area where you can sit on the floor. \\n\\nFor my first time I got the matcha cookies, sesame cookie, and the honey matcha soda. My boyfriend got the Japanese iced coffee. Tip, all drinks come unsweetened, but you can sweeten them at the simple syrup/honey station closest to the back. The soda was god awful, I couldn't get myself nor my boyfriend to finish it. The matcha cookie was just alright but the winner was definitely the sesame cookie. The consistency is unlike anything I've ever had. These were baked to perfection.\\n\\nI recommend getting a seat first before sitting if it's packed. You'll thank me later. The second time we came was a tad less crowded. I got the iced matcha latte (much better) and added simple syrup to my liking. My boyfriend got the umami green tea and he liked mine better. This time we got the yuzu cookie and the special chocolate and matcha pound cake. Yuzu cookie was equally amazing as the sesame. Both the perfect balance of consistency, sweet, and flavorful.

I reminded her that I had ordered the cab.  Soon the meal and the cab arrived.  The salad was beautiful with very nicely marinated peppers and mushrooms over a bed of spinach.  It wasn't until I had already eaten half that I realized it had neither goat nor blue cheese on it.  Honestly, the salad itself was so good I would have easily overlooked this one minor issue.  Unfortunately the steak was overcooked, at least medium, perhaps edging towards medium well, and the big kicker for me, the cab was served nearly ice cold.  It was unfortunate too because it had a good flavor and would have been much better at or near room temp.\\n\\nI was already slightly disappointed when the bill arrived, without being asked if I wanted coffee (which I did) and I realized I had been charged for the phantom pinot that they don't even have in addition to the glass of wine I did get.\\n\\nI'll raise a cold glass of decent cab and toast to a better go next time, Davio's."},{"name":"Vino Volo","address":"Austin Airport","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Food was ok.

Bread rolls (which I found to mimic filipino pan de sal, probably because of the Spanish connection) and butter are served at the beginning of the meaI.  The bread is super fresh and fluffy.  I ordered the carne frita and also tried their seafood paella.  The carne frita was delicious and came with fried plantains and chimichurri which I could not get enough of.  As for the seafood paella, it was surprisingly moist with plenty of seafood.  I should note that I've had seafood paella from Spain and while Latin Quarter's paella can't exactly compare, I thought the paella had overall good flavor.  I also ordered a Pina Colada which interestingly, I learned from the menu that the drink originated in Puerto Rico.

The halloumi was deep fried, the tabbouleh was basically a tomato salad that was also very bland and oily. The grilled chicken was ok, but the rice was bloated and soggy. Finally, the baclava that I live for was so mediocre I didn't eat the second piece. \\n\\nSo, all in all, this restaurant is ok. It's not horrible but it's not great.

My gripe is that turkey on Thanksgiving is often dry and bland. However, this turkey was different.  It was flavorful and tender. It also helped that there was a bunch of gravy poured over my plate. \\n\\nTurkey is such a holiday oriented food in my mind, and I'm ecstatic that I'll be able to get my turkey fix year round at a deli that roasts their own turkey in house, everyday.

Now keep in mind, I grew up in Houston which has a gigantic Asian community and I currently live in Chinatown Houston.  So my experience with Asian teas is pretty good.  There are only 2-3 that I love in the Houston area and the rest are mediocre or they just over sweeten their drinks.\\n\\nSo I order a Jasmine Milk Tea with Tapioca and their signature Strawberry Brick Toast.  The tea was served promptly while the toast took about 10 mins to prepare.  I took one sip of the tea and it was velvety smooth and sweetened just right!  I could taste the tea blend and jasmine without the sweet overpowering the whole thing but the best part?  The boba tapioca.  My goodness, I thought I'd tried the very best before but whatever it is that they do here to the boba I hope they stick to it.  It was PERFECTLY chewy, soft centers and they were sweetened unlike any other tapioca I had tried before.  Now don't get me wrong, other places are good too but Tea Haus' boba has something special going for it and I can't put taste buds on it but I fell in love!  Best Jasmine Milk Tea ever!\\n\\nThen the brick toast was called.  I walk to the kitchen window to get it and I was amazed at the presentation!

Perfectly toasted and sweet with some sort of buttery texture and the strawberries just made everything pop perfectly together.  You just have to try it yourself.

Split it with a friend if you're worried about calories lol! \\n\\nMy only complaint is that now when I do have milk tea or any sort of dessert toast I am gonna compare it to this place and it's just too darn far for me to drive to every time I want my milk tea fix!\\n\\nBut if you're local, you should check it out.

The mountain of bonito flakes added another level of umami, and provided a entertaining dance as well.  CAUTION: The inside of the takoyaki was extremely hot! \\n\\nOkonomiyaki was decent overall.  The main difference between Hiroshima and Osaka was the content.  Hiroshima Style was made with a thin crepe and yakisoba noodles, while Osaka style mixes everything into the batter without yakisoba noodles, then made into a pancake.  Flavor was decent, and they also put a lot of sauce.  Osaka style put mayo on top with the sauce, but Hiroshima only had sauce.  The sauce was a bit overwhelming, but worked well with the dish since the inside was not flavored.  \\n\\nMy only issue was the price.  Okonomiyaki was not that large, with mostly cabbage and yakisoba noodles, and cost $13.50.  Takoyaki was $9.50, about 3 times the price of ones in Japan.  Too expensive.  \\n\\nIf you don't mind paying the price, I recommend you come right after they opened to ensure freshly-made tacoyaki.  They would make extra, and put them in a warmer.  I rather have freshly-made if I'm paying $9.50 for one."},{"name":"Tom, Dick & Hank","address":"191 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food and drinks were great, and service was excellent.

We occupied two tables and ordered dishes like lobster, pigeon, peking duck, etc.  Although the food itself was acceptable, the service was HORRIBLE!    We waited close to 2 hours for our food. It was ridiculous!  We had children with our group, all under the age of 8, and they were famished!  The 3-year old was actually crying from HUNGER! We complained several times to the manager who simply told us:  \\"Well, we've got a party tonight!\\" Apparently, there was some kind of event in a separate room going on that evening. But that isn't our problem.\\n\\nOur original reservation was at 7pm and we didn't get our food until close to 9pm.  The food came at erratic rates:  One table would get lobster and the other peking duck.  They served the lettuce for the minced duck at the beginning but the minced duck itself did not appear until the end of the meal when the noodles were served. By then, the lettuce was wilted and disgusting.  Between the hour of 7-9pm, we were served water and a soup we DID NOT ORDER but had to accept considering there as nothing else to eat.  We ordered a Winter Melon soup, but this ginseng concoction came out instead.  It was bitter and held \\"assorted\\" meats.  A friend of ours happened to be at another table, and they ended leaving before their food arrived because they had been waiting for two hours as well.  Actually a few tables left before their food came.  I've never seen this happen in my life. \\n\\nMy sister has booked her wedding rehearsal dinner at this restaurant. They were present at the meal and have now decided to cancel their booking.  \\n\\nMay I note as well:  The bathrooms were disgusting!  It made you forget you were in Canada for a moment.\\n\\nI think the problem stems from poor management - they overbook and understaff.\\n\\nI would not recommend anyone to come here if they are planning on eating.

What a gem.\\n\\nMy friend and I piled up the tray with all the meats. Here's the verdict.\\n\\nBrisket is very tender and delectable. Irresistible flavor. Despite my praise, I'd be remiss to say this is not the juiciest brisket in town, there is one place that does it better but the wait is two, maybe three times as long.  \\n\\nPulled pork is rich and smothered in sauce. Soft and moist. Not too greasy.\\n\\nSausage is arguably the best in town. It has smokey, savory and spicy nuances. Juicy. And the skin has a nice tight texture and bite.\\n\\nTurkey is bland and rubbery, I'd recommend skipping this item. \\n\\nPork ribs are moist as hell, falls off the bone, melts in your mouth. Fatty and savory. Lots of rub creates an addicting complexity. The best ribs in town.  \\n\\nThe beef rib is even better than the brisket. Succulent, melty, perfect amount of bite. Slightly charred skin and rub add incredible complexity. \\n\\nThe sides are satisfactory. Potato salad is reminiscent of mashed potatoes. All the ingredients are mashed together and doesn't have a chunky potato bite. The creamy flavor is good along with pickle nuances, but the textural issue is hard to get past.  \\n\\nThe coleslaw is a peppercorn and tomato based one rather than buttermilk based. Because the BBQ is already so heavy and loaded with pepper, the coleslaw does not offer the creamy respite I needed. I do not recommend getting the coleslaw. \\n\\nThe beans are satisfactory. On the watery side, I would have prefered a thicker sauce. The beans are soft, with some onions adding crunchy nuances. The cumin provides a needed change in pace from the pepper rub on the meat. \\n\\nThe rub at LA BBQ seems to be a very heavy and coarse salt and pepper rub. Simple and effective. The pork and beef ribs and sausage are absolutely the best I had during my stay in Austin. The brisket is great, but not the best I had in Austin. The sides are satisfactory. Turkey is a pass.\\n\\nI highly recommend visiting LA Barbecue."},{"name":"Mamma Maria","address":"3 North Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We had a wonderful dinner here.

I could have spent half that much if I wanted to, but I dug deep to try to spend some money.\\n\\nWhen I first got here, I knew it was order at the counter, so I got in line and then I couldn't find the menu!

However, there were a couple posted on the wall near where I was standing.  I noticed the majority of the dishes was between $5 and $10.

I loved that the side salad had avocados with sour cream on top.  The sour cream tasted so fresh.  I didn't realize it was sour cream at first.  The fish was amazing!  I absolutely destroyed it.  The rice was very good too.  Overall this dish went above and beyond.  Who knew I would love fish at a Mexican restaurant?  The horchata was also amazing.  I made the mistake of googling nutritional information on horchata while drinking it.  It made me pause, but it was so good I kept slurping it down.

I found the food to be great, but the atmosphere is questionable.\\n\\nPho Green Papaya has been around awhile and has a lot going for it.  They've converted a trailer into a restaurant.  It feels like a glorified food cart in the most positive sense.  They have an impressive menu of Vegan options, which is great for veggies like myself.  I opted for the Veggie Delight.  Great mixture of fresh veggies including string beans. fried tofu, and a delicate sauce over rice.  Perfect for me.  Not the best portion size for the money, but I'm sure their rent here is high.  Meals are $10-12.\\n\\nWhere it loses steam and stars for me is that it feels cramped and rickety and old.  They've made due with what they have, but when I'm eating and the waitress is busy stapling plastic to the inside of the windows to keep the cold air out, it's rather off-putting.  For such a small place there's too many extras gathering dust, like a greeting card rack in between tables.\\n\\nOverall, not a bad option for a quick lunch stop.

Accept it for what it is, and don't let it ruin your dinner.\\n\\nAs for the food, I'll quote Susan R's review since we went together:\\n\\n\\"We decided to eat family-style so we could try a little bit of everything.

My family and I arrived after calling and finding out that they were not taking reservations, but the wait was only ten minutes, so we headed over right away. Since there were only four people in our party, we waited less than ten minutes and were seated upstairs. \\nLast time that my family and I went to La Famiglia Giorgio's, we were seated on the first floor and I think that it is a bit more traditional Italian. The upstairs has a bit more of modern flair to it, but still has a great ambiance that does not detract from the experience. \\nAfter being seated our waitress came over right away to give us water, and to take our drink orders. I agreed to let my little brother order my drink, and I was very impressed by the amount of soft drink that they have. They not only have the typical pops, but they also have Shierly Temples, Roy Rogers, Hot chocolate, tea, and more! My brother ordered a Shirley Temple and ordered me a Roy Rogers. When our waitress came back with our drinks I was shocked at the size of the drinks. They came in large hard plastic glasses, and I knew right away that I wouldn't be able to order another. \\nThe menu is incredibly large, with traditional Italian food and popularized modern dishes. They also have a challenge section of the menu, where if you eat all of the food from certain orders you receive a special shirt.  \\nI ordered penne pasta with marinara and chicken, and just like the other dishes that they have, it was incredibly large. There were four chicken breasts on the plate, and while I was not able to finish it all in one seating; the pasta dish was just as delicious the next day. \\nMy parents also enjoyed their dishes, and my fathers only complaint was that the portions are too big. The food was just as I remembered it, delicious and the perfect Italian food!

Score: 4.25\\n\\n3) Spinach Fritters- Usually the fritters (fried balls of whatever kind of vegetable you want) at Indian buffets are not done very well- not crispy, just lots of breaded gunk to serve as filler for the stomach.  But these fritters definitely hold their own.  Deep fried, but didn't taste loaded with grease.  Just the right texture.  Score: 4.25\\n\\n4) Chicken Korma- Again, sounds like a simple dish.  They used chicken breasts sliced into strips, so the chicken was a bit overcooked- but that's to be expected.  The sauce that covered the chicken however, was great!    On the tangier side, which kept my palate in good spirits.  Sometimes Indian buffets go too heavy on flavor on multiple dishes. Not here. Score: 4 \\n\\n5) Goat Curry- This is the standard thing I look for at any Indian buffet- I'm not the 'glutton for mutton' for nothing.  The curry wasn't too greasy, and the meat was tender.  Flavor didn't overwhelm, but it was solid.  Score: 4\\n\\nIf I don't stop now, I'll end up talking about almost all the dishes offered at the buffet- so I'll just say that the veggie dishes were done adequately, and again, were not soaked in oil as they typically tend to be. \\n\\nI'll definitely be bringing my wife here in the near future.

There may be some other restaurants in Boston that offer Okonomiyaki along with many other menu items, but this place is really Japanese and specializes in one thing...and the rule in Japan is that shops that specialize (whether ramen, okonomiyaki, sushi, tonkatsu, or whatever) do the best job.  It's a small place, with a decor that closely resembles one of those little fast-food shops are so typical in Japan.  You order from a menu of about 4 or 5 different kinds of Okonomiyaki, and it's cooked on-the-spot.  Wait time is maybe 10 minutes for a fresh, hot, filling meal (take-outs or doggie bags are common).  It was simply delicious and authentic-tasting...there are so many regional variations of Okonomiyaki in Japan, and the ones we had here were just like the ones I ate regularly during a week in Hiroshima a couple of years ago.

When I saw this little El Salvadorian spot, I had to check it out. This place is on Michigan Avenue in Kissimmee in a little nondescript strip of shops. It is a very small restaurant quaintly decorated with Salvadorian decorations and pictures of the food. Spanish music was playing and everything was clean and homey looking. We were promptly greeted and I saw that they had Atol de Elote on the menu. I was so excited because I had it once before and it's so delicious. Basically it's a drink they make out of fresh corn. Think of it as a thinner corn porridge with hints of cinnamon and vanilla but in a cup so you can drink it. It came with a piece of corn on the cob on the side. I thought that was pretty interesting since it was about 10 in the morning but you know I ate that corn for breakfast. the drink was creamy and so delicious. I'm sure was very high in calories as well but worth every bit of it.\\n\\n I also ordered two pupusas. One filled with chicharon and the other with cheese and black beans. They came out piping hot crisp and delicious. You could tell that they were made fresh and with loving care. They came out with a red sauce and a typical cabbage slaw to go with them. The slaw cuts the richness of the pupusas and accompany it so nicely.\\nMy husband got the seafood soup. I was surprised that all the soups of the day were ready so early in the day and he took advantage of it. It came with a side of rice or plantains. It was a great big bowl filled with a rich broth and lots of seafood. He was feeling under the weather so this really hit the spot even if it was soup for breakfast. Everything we ate tasted like someone's grandmother cooked it.\\nThe service hair was very quick and so friendly. The waitress I had did not speak any English but I'm sure others in the restaurant do. Regardless there's lots of pictures in the menu and also things are in English and Spanish so that should not stop you as I'm sure they would be very accommodating to anyone that did not speak Spanish.\\n I really had a lovely experience here and we'll come back for sure."},{"name":"Gantetsu-Ya","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 4","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Gantetsu-Ya is located at 318 Harvard Street in Brookline, MA. It is located in the neighborhood Arcade Building. The restaurant specializes in Japanese street food, particularly two well known dishes, takoyaki and okonomiyaki. The restaurant is also owned by the same company as the very popular Ganko Ittetsu Ramen, which is also located in the same building. I having been reading that the restaurant would be opening up in September in the same building but to my surprise, they are located directly across from each other. \\n\\nThe close proximity is strategic as the two restaurants will bring customers to each other. You can't help but see the other restaurant. If the wait for ramen at Ganko Ittetsu Ramen is long, patrons can easily grab an order of takoyaki at Gantetsu-Ya. \\n\\nTakoyaki is a very popular street snack in Japan. I have had takoyaki at several restaurants in the area. Gantetsu-Ya is definitely in my top three. One order came with eight doughy squid balls. When I say doughy, I mean the inside is not cooked through. And this is how it should be, somewhat oozy on the inside and with a nice chunk of tako (squid). If a restaurant serve this dish cooked through, it's kind of like passing a fully boiled egg off as a poached egg? \\n\\nOkonomiyaki, another Japanese Street food favorite, is a savory pancake that is filled with vegetables and meats. It usually has lots of shredded cabbage for vegetable and usually pork for protein. There is also a layer of noodles too. Everything is typically wrapped in a layer of egg and common toppings include otafuku sauce, Japanese mayonnaise, scallions, dried bonito flakes, aonori (dried green seaweed flakes). \\n\\nAs for the okonomiyaki options at Gantetsu-Ya, you can choose from five versions. They vary slightly but all have some common ingredients such as sliced cabbage, noodles, and an egg layer. The original version contains sliced pork belly and sliced cabbage. The Mayo-cheese version has American cheese. The Negi-Mayo version is kind of like the original but with Japanese mayonnaise as one if the toppings and extra green onions. The Veggie version has mushrooms. And lastly, the seafood version has shrimp and yari-ika which is a type of small squid. Definitely look over the ingredients and pick what you like. \\n\\nAs for myself, I tried the seafood okonomiyaki. This was only my second time having okonomiyaki. The first time was at another Japanese restaurant (Ittoku). The okonomiyaki at Gantetsu-Ya was definitely more filling. I don't know about others but after finishing a bowl of ramen from the ramen restaurant across the store, I only had room enough for one takoyaki ball and a teeny bite of the okonomiyaki. If you want to try these two items first before heading over to try the ramen next door, there might not be enough room for ramen after. It's a tough decision. Or maybe just bring a friend. \\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is designed to look like you're in Japan. Very small, with about three tables for seating. The wait for one takoyaki and one okonomiyaki was about 15 minutes. There was no one waiting before us so I am unsure what other people wait time was. The service was polite. Price was fair.

Just as everyone states, the restaurant was super empty. We wanted to order a deep dish pizza but the waitress told us that it will be 45 minutes for the cook to complete. I will give her the benefit of the doubt that she was honest. But the deep dish pizza was the reason we decided to come here. We decided not to order the deep dish and instead we bought a Yelp deal that gave us $50 credit and it only cost $25 for the credit. We decided to order a thin crust pizza and appetizer of wings and a chicken Parmesan sandwich. By the time the food had arrived there was one other couple that came in to visit. We are now sharing our waitress with one other table. By the end of the night I believe we only saw our waitress two times as she only had one other table to attend to. When the waitress came around with the bill she told me that I owed $7.79. Keep in mind that I have a $50 credit from yelp. The total of the meal was $43.30. So to my understanding right now I need to order seven dollars worth more food. The waitress told me that I owed $7.79 as my balance was due. I try to dispute this with the waitress as it did not seem fair to me as to why I would owe $7.79. After speaking with her for several moments she confessed where she had applied her on tip. That was the shadiest action I had ever experienced from any restaurant and I've been going to restaurants for a long time. She offered to refund me but I told her because it was 1 AM in the morning and I was tired she could keep the extra money that she wrongfully charged me for.

I then asked him again; he says, \\"Ummm, you're going to have to ask her her name?\\" I realized the level of education that I was dealing with and left the sandwich and the two of them to figure out the answer to my question. I sat in the parking lot for about 15 minutes, the guy goes back outside to sit in a car next to the side door, and then she comes out and sits on the ground next to the car with the door open. In the meantime, why they are outside, two customers are sitting inside the store. I then drove through the parking lot with my window rolled down. Let us say I didn't smell them smoking roses.

Has the service been commensurate with the prices and quality of the food, I would have given it a 5 star eating. Unfortunately, in comparison with other restaurants with comparable prices and menus, the level of service just isn't up to par. There was nothing wrong overall and it would have been unremarkable at lesser priced establishments. We had to request more if their delicious bread twice and waited too long to order dessert for a mid week dinner so we all passed on dessert (which all looked amazingly appetizing). Service was not quite attentive enough and expectations at this level are high.\\n\\nEnough about the service as I tend to ignore reviews that focus on that over the food. We had wonderful appetizers of oysters, scallops, duck leg and lobster pasta. Each dish was delicately prepared and quite delicious. The menu changes daily and our waiter was quite opinionated about what were the best choices and which were not up to par, an honesty much appreciated and too seldom encountered. His recommendations were spot on.\\n\\nWe had a variety of entrees from veal porterhouse to filet of beef to osso bucco to rabbit pasta, each dish carefully prepared, seasoned and presented with fresh local sides. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed every bite and, like the appetizers, we shared and got a good sense of the caliber of the menu.\\n\\nWould have loved to try the desserts and hopefully we'll have an opportunity next visit.\\n\\nMamma Maria's sounds like an old fashioned red sauce Italian restaurant in one of the classic red sauce Italian neighborhoods.

Coal Fired is unique as it seems to heat the air around the pizza creating a sort of \\"light airy crust with a somewhat salty wooden taste\\" at least thats my take. Now Anthony's does a similiar job but more of a \\"if you ever wondered what it would be like to chew on a Tempur-pedic foam mattress\\" like density. Be prepared to chew and I say chew 8-14 times. They also have decided to do what I like to describe \\"The Picasso Affect\\" with there tomato sauce.  They dont spread sauce and then lay down cheese-what happens is they 'dab chunky italian plum tomato sauce and then fill in the gaps with a thin layer of mozzarella cheese. The cheese has an intense flavor that adds a moderate level of saltiness to the pizza. You will also find that unless you are absolutely famished that you leave crust. I do not like to waste but I found myself after the 4th slice leaving about 2inches of the crust uneaten. I rate pizzerias based on their Cheese you see, if you can't make a decent cheese pizza well.. Your specialty entrees and premium pizzas better be the real deal.

They have seating around their prep area that would be great for kids to sit and watch. There is a outside area that can fit probably an additional 10-15 people that is setup as a fully functional balcony.

Yuck. \\n\\n   You can order the meals in three spice levels:  Mild/Med/Spicy, and we got \\"mild\\" so maybe their interpretation of mild spice means there's nothing on it? lol  (The cook in the back called out to the owner that there was no soy sauce... so maybe it normally has that? There was plenty of soy sauce on the dining room condiment cart though.) \\n\\nWhen my friend mentioned to the counter guy that they forgot the squash, we got handed a little dish of 5 thin slices of RAW zucchini to split between us.   uhhhh.... ????    * note the picture is the actual portion minus one slice.    lame. \\n\\nFortunately, the (vegan! yay!) kimchi was delicious and had notes of sesame oil and the table-side hot sauce made the noodle catastrophe at least edible.  But only because the noodles were served warm.      \\n\\nIn the past, their bibimbap has been good (except that it shows up in various states of either being chilled or hot depending on who is cooking) and they have a nice assortment of boba teas, healing teas, fruit teas, and other drinks.. so maybe I'll give them another shot. But not in a hurry to go back. \\n\\npro-tip:  there's only one person making the food so give yourself plenty of time and order one of the rice crispy treats"},{"name":"Kokoro Tokyo Mazesoba","address":"100 1st Street E","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Tried their signature Mazesoba at the downtown location several times, so we finally decided to try the regular Tonkotsu ramen at this location.

The mood was romantic feeling with dim lights but I had a hard time reading the menu or even seeing what I was eating due to that. I want to be able to see my food! All the tables had restaurant branded plates already there when we got in, although we didn't end up using those plates when we ate so that was interesting. They took them away. \\n\\nSeems like the menu options might change? If you look at the menu about a month ago, there were no vegetarian options but there were 2 when I went. I had the tofu in opor sauce and the dish came out by itself. It didn't come with rice or anything and the waitress asked us if we wanted steamed rice. I didn't expect to just eat tofu and sauce by itself unless that's how it's done in Indonesia...I have no idea. We also had the vegetable lumpia, which tasted a bit too oily for my liking. The food overall was very filling though but for the prices charged, I expected better tasting food, I wasn't really blown away.\\n\\nLooking at other peoples pictures posted on yelp it looks like they had free crackers and sauce brought out to them.

While waiting for the food, we took a second glance at the menu and noticed lamb as a meat option... so we HAD to try a lamb taco as well. The asada and chorizo tacos were good but paled in comparison to the lamb taco, which ended up being our favorite! The burrito was smaller than we were used to for a \\"spot\\" but it was still good.

I was in Boston briefly on vacation and thought I'd make my way to the North End for the first time for a storied bowl of pasta.  Seeing Giacomo's may now be somewhat overrated, I opted for Yelp's very first option, Carmelina's, where I was met with a 45 minute wait on a weekday night.  I dropped by a couple of other places to play the wait list lottery, and Carmelina's called first, 40 minutes in (kudos for correctly guessing the wait time).  Accepting the call was a mistake. \\n\\nProblems were limited to the food--service was attentive, friendly, and unassuming--but problems abounded.  The spaghetti in my carbonara powered well beyond al dente into soggy and limp territory.  The seasoning of my lamb begged the question as to whether the kitchen mistook the similarly-shaded lamb shank for a pepper grinder.  Bread was stale and seemingly starchless upon arrival; perhaps it had been replaced with Revolutionary hardtack from the Paul Revere House close  by.  Credit, however, where it is due: gnocchi were as they should be, plush and velvety like a summer Nimbus cloud, and everything I ordered came out promptly (and the food piping hot). \\n\\nNow, as this was my first time in the North End, it may well be true that Carmelina's is truly the best option.  But, if it were, I'd have to light a candle for the Bostonians who have never encountered truly superb Italian food. \\n\\nMore likely that my visit was just an off-night.  On the small chance, however, that the off-night was representative, it is worth noting here that Carmelina's is definitely not worth a 45 minute wait, much less the number one spot on Yelp for Italian in the North End."},{"name":"Al Wadi","address":"1249 Vfw Pkwy","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4","text":"I do not recommend this place.

You see, Helen's was a big family favorite of ours. The food is fantastic! Their Szechuan cauliflower was so good I'd dream about between visits. Then there was this kitchy sense that you're clearly in a dining establishment that was once a strip club, which only contributed to its odd charm. But the highlight, above all, was the owners. Helen would approach our table with a genuine hospitality toward our dumpling-obsessed kids that really sold us on the place. Then there was her husband, who would sometimes settle down at the piano that sat at the middle of the room,  entertaining diners while singing opera in Chinese.\\n\\nThen it changed ownership. Without Helen herself running the place, we were in no hurry to return.\\n\\n1 year later, we decided to test the waters. I can't decide if I was hoping to find the same awesome food I longed for (oooh, those peppercorns!) or if I expected to that without Helen's special touch that the place had fallen apart. Do you now what? The most cheerful, friendly, helpful, kind woman greeted us at our table and guided us through the menu, invested in ensuring we ordered exactly what we would like. When my son dropped his knife, she sprung to her feet and came to see if he needed a replacement. Moreover, she cooed over my cuties gobbling up their dinners and complimented their diverse palates. Way to flatter this mama!\\n\\nThey made some improvements in the dining space. While we didn't mind the dive-y nature of the place before (think picnic table plastic unrolled on the tables), I have to admit the wooden booths and uniform tables do look nicer. And the bathroom, which doubled as their storage perviously, which was clearly the strippers' dressing room before that, is now cleaned up and presentable. If you look closely, you can find some sparkly heart stickers on the mirror, obviously placed there by one of the girls in its former incarnation. They have really done a nice job with the place, without making too drastic of changes. \\n\\nSo, the service and the restaurant itself were no worse. Better even! But the food...Also even better!! The kids enthusiastically order vegetable dumplings. They were never palatable before, but they liked them. The new dumplings are handmade and seriously yummy! We ordered a few Americanized Chinese standards, like shrimp and tofu with vegetables and they were just how you'd want them. The broccoli and peppers were bright and crisp, proteins cooked just right. A great new addition is the Korean banchan they now bring out. All 4 were outstanding! So much flavor! She even brought out seconds for my son, who loved the \\"spicy pickles\\" :) And I tasted the cauliflower last. I remembered it SO fondly and was reeeally hoping it was still going to be the same. Guess what? It was just like I remembered. The flames beneath the dish made it sizzle and the hot, Szechuan spiciness and depth of flavor were just how I recalled. I am so grateful Helen's 2.0 rocks.

Arrived at 4:30 for an early dinner with co-workers on Thursday, June 13, 2019 with reservations.  Surprisingly, the parking lot was full and we took the last spot. What happened to the parking lot attendant?   We were seated and our waitress who was training a new waitress came right over.  From there it went downhill.\\nIn the past I have eaten at Conrad's Norwood several times and reserved rooms for functions, so I expected the same good service and huge portions as in the past.  The waitress was very serious, not sure if it was because she was training someone, which did not make us feel very welcomed.  When the food came and was delivered by a kitchen server, one person in our party asked for more tartar sauce, we waited, but no one came to deliver the tartar sauce.  I saw our waitress and waived her for attention, she seemed to look at me, but ignored me.  I had to get up and ask her for more tartar sauce.  The portions were on the smaller limited size, not the huge portions you used to get.  When all was said and done, the waitress wanted to bring our check and I said we want dessert do you have a dessert menu.  Odd, restaurants usually want you to have dessert to raise your tab. Then some tall,  woman stopped at our table, not introducing herself took, my empty dessert plate and talked about dessert and what she liked.  I asked her was she a dessert person.  She didn't respond or tell me if she was a manager or what.  We stayed past our welcome and was asked several times was there anything else that we needed.

She said that I would love the ambiance, there was tons of natural lighting, and that the food was also fantastic.\\n\\nShe was 100% right.\\n\\nGen Sou En is (was?) one of my favorite places to eat. They have a bakery, so you're definitely going to get a great selection of asian flavors that you don't typically find in Boston. I'm a huge matcha fiend, so I was quite excited to try their matcha latte.\\n\\nI ordered the:\\n\\n- Matcha latte (with almond milk)\\n- Omu-udon\\n- Matcha tiramisu\\n\\nWe had made reservations, so were seated pretty quickly. The design and set up of Gen Sou En is absolutely breathtaking. It's spacious, you don't feel cramped, and is styled very modernly. The area we were in had a skylight, so we had very soft natural light coming through. It didn't feel too bright. Absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\nOnce we put in our orders, we had to wait a few minutes for our drinks. The matcha latte was great and I enjoyed it. I personally like my matcha lattes a little sweet, but I didn't find their matcha to be overbearing or too bitter.\\n\\nThe rest of our food came out in a pretty timely manner. They timed it so that the dessert would come out when we were ready. The omu-udon was AMAZING. Holy shit. I loved it so much. The omu-udon is pretty much a Japanese omelette with chicken, udon noodles, cabbage, and tonkatsu aioli.\\n\\nIt was to die for.\\n\\nWell worth the cost ($16), imo.

From the poorly run restaurant, mediocre food at best, to absolute nightmare of service. This is just another pretentious restaurant in Buckhead that pops up and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for authentic Indonesian food. Tempo Doeloe in buford highway is way much better than this place in terms of food and service.. it's not an upscale restaurant but i'll take that place any day over this pretentious wanna-be restaurant. This is the worst culinary experience we have ever had before. \\n\\nWe had a reservation here Fri night for the William Wongso, one of the famous chef and culinary expert from Indonesia. I was born and raised in Indonesia, so i was very excited with this experience.\\n\\nThis restaurant markets itself as an upscale Indonesian restaurant.. but upscale it is not. Another Indonesian friend of mine already warned me about their food, bland and just not good. But since it's an event and the chef is different, I really have high expectations. It was so deeply disappointing from the beginning to the end.\\n\\nWe arrived and were seated towards the corner end of the restaurants. There were 4 of us but my boyfriend and I arrived first. There was no host so we were just standing there watching the chaotic scene in the restaurant. 3 days prior to the dinner, I called ahead to inform them in advance that my boyfriend is allergic to chicken, they said it's not a problem, they'll note it down and asked me to inform them again upon arrival. When someone finally came to us, i informed them again that my boyfriend is allergic to chicken and that I called ahead already before this. He acknowledged that and brought us to our table which was at the corner end inside the restaurant. \\nIt took them 15 mins to serve us water and that's because we were actively raising our hands until someone noticed. \\n\\nWhen they asked us if we're ready for the food.. i informed them again that my boyfriend is allergic to chicken. For the main they have 2 options: baby back ribs or beef rendang. All of us chose beef rendang. Since my boyfriend was allergic to chicken, they said they'll give him extra piece of rendang but that of course didn't happen.\\n\\nThey served us our appetizer & before we even finished.. they hurried to serve us our lukewarm soup. We had to stack the empty plates ourselves, they didn't clear it for us until we asked them to. Even then they only cleared some of the plates and left the others on our table.\\n\\nAfter the soup, we waited for our main dish but we were again forgotten by them since we were in the corner end. The chef came out and started talking to tables, when he arrived at our table and asked my Malaysian friend if he likes the rendang.. my friend said he wouldn't know since it's not served yet. The chef was confused to my friend's answer so i chimed-in in Indonesian that the food hasn't come out yet. He was surprised and went back to the kitchen. \\n\\nWhen the main dish FINALLY came out with small plates of dishes. They brought chicken for each of us. I told the guy that my boyfriend is allergic to chicken (the youngest man who was part of the serving crew that night). He was in disbelief and looked confused and we had to tell him again about the allergy. He laughed at my boyfriend in front of us.. apparently he thought it's ok for to ridicule someone with chicken allergy. That's effing rude and not how you treat your customers. \\n\\nMain dish was horrible. The grilled fish, the rendang, the rice, everything was cold on that plate. We told the chef the food is cold, and asked if it was meant to be served cold. The chef basically told us it's not meant to be served hot. I didn't know what to say by then. I don't know which Indonesian restaurant he has cooked before for it to be ok that main dish can be served cold. I don't think it's in our culture to serve COLD food. That didn't go well with us. The chef then asked if we want to send it back to be warmed up. We did send it back and asked them to clear our plates too. They microwaved it for us. When they brought back the food to us, the chef was standing behind my friend and dropped his food on the table and said that \\"i hope the food is hot enough for you now\\" and then walked away. Just like that. \\n\\nObviously the chef was offended but he didn't handle it well. Apparently once you're famous culinary expert, it's not ok for us to criticize his sub-par food. The food came back out warmer but my friend's beef rendang was barely edible because the meat was so hard like a rock. The highlight of the main dish was sadly the pickled pineapple. The rest was just horrible. \\nDesert was just ok. \\n\\nI was honestly embarrassed to have brought my friends here. This place is in no way a representation of our culinary.

You can really taste the jasmine tea in the drink, where as some other places the true flavors of the tea is suppressed by all the sugar. Their \\"standard\\" recipe is excellent a nice balance of jasmine and sweetness. Not to mention their boba is ON POINT! When I saw on point the boba is sweet and has been properly cooked and soaked in honey to deliver that sweet taste that most places in Austin just fail to accomplish.\\n\\nAlso don't fear my fellow tea sippers, you can adjust the level of sweetness to your level as well so you can taste the tea flavors more or just more sugar! \\n\\nI also suggest you try some of the foods, either the basil chicken if you are craving something salty, but if you are feeling that sweet tooth, check out the brick toast which is a delicious toasted piece of bread drizzled with condensed milk and topped with strawberries. I recommend getting a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!\\n\\nAnyways if it is your first time here: I would recommend the following depending on your mood:\\n\\nSweet Tooth:\\nJasmine Milk Tea with Boba (Standard sweetness) and The Brick Toast\\n\\nThe Balanced:\\nMilk Tea with Boba (Standard sweetness) and The Basil Chicken"},{"name":"The Morgan House","address":"5300 Glick Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"This place has a lot of history to it.

With the Yelp reviews for said locations being generally good, pizza being boyfriend's favorite thing, and a MOD pizza location being near boyfriend's house, it was clear that we were meant to try this place. \\n\\nThe concept is simple: you choose what size of pizza you want. The sizes range from 6\\" in diameter for a mini to 11\\" for a mod. There's also a mega mod, which is apparently two 11\\" crusts (or something like that). Upon choosing your crust size, you choose your sauce, cheese, meats, and other toppings as you walk through the line. If this is too overwhelming for you, you can choose from some of MOD's pre-set combinations and modify it, or not. Note: you only pay one price for the size of the pizza and can add as many toppings as you want for free. Freeeee! It's like a subway/how do you roll/freebirds type of place for pizza, but they don't charge extra for toppings. What's not to love? \\n\\nThe lovely pizza creator lady and the nice man that checked us out were both extremely friendly. The staff seemed to genuinely enjoy working there. This isn't usually something that is important to me when going to a food establishment, but it was certainly nice to see. Generally, as long as servers aren't blatantly rude to me and don't spit in my food, I'm cool with them. \\n\\nOn to the pizzas - I got a mini with white sauce, mozzarella, chorizo (yes, chorizo!!), Rosemary, basil, Gorgonzola, and feta. It was downright phenomenal. I mean, I figured it would be good, but it was seriously splendid. On the MOD pizza website they claim that if you don't like your pizza (due to all of the crazy toppings you went overboard with, which, trust me, can be really easy to do) they'll make you a new pizza at no charge to you. This seems a little crazy to me. I mean, people gotta learn restraint with their toppings. Boyfriend ordered a barbecue chicken pizza and it was really delicious also. We then split their garlic sticks (mini pizza with garlic topping and cheese) and red sauce. Boyfriend also ordered a chocolate shake. It was good, but I'm more of a malt girl myself. \\n\\nOverall, (if you can't already tell from my overly excited and excessively long review) this place is glorious."},{"name":"Helen Asian Kitchen","address":"1070 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"A great neighborhood place for Asian food.

I had to wait a bit in the small foyer area for about 10 minutes even with my reservation--but, due to my 'long' wait time, I was offered a free eggplant app which was so crispy and warm and made me feel right at home.

The meatballs are so ridiculously good here, packed with enormous flavor without being overly salty or spiced.  Definitely get any dish with meatballs as it's SO good.  I enjoyed the meatballs more than I enjoyed the house-made sausage, which was kind of dry.  The Lobster Fra Diavolo was divinely good, but the Bronx special stood out more to me because of those meatballs.  The pastas itself was also heavenly as they were clearly homemade and cooked to my liking of al dente-ness.\\n\\nService was excellent; waters were refilled and it wasn't too hard to get a waiter's attention.

In a nutshell, this is a pour your own wine (but more automated). Customers come in, preload a card, and then use it to get one of 3 wine pours. It's a neat concept and in theory allows us to try many different wines. \\n\\nIn practice, this does not work simply because of the cost. I stopped in and loaded up $20 on my card. In the end, I was able to sample 4 cheaper wines, and probably had 1.5-2 glasses in total. That's a terrible return on alcohol, especially because a couple of the cheaper wines were completely mediocre at best. \\n\\nNow sometimes the ambiance and atmosphere of a bar can outweigh the cost. For instance, Hofbrauhaus was an awesome place to go back in the day when Herb was up there killing it on the keyboard (he gone now). Similarly, specialty cocktail places like the Bottle Shop offer up unique cocktails. Could I get drunk for cheaper? Of course, I could go pound $1 Genese at Local Bar, but sometimes you want to class it up and sip on a yummy gin drink. Unfortunately, Tastings is nothing remarkable. It is clean and bright inside, but there is no atmosphere to think of, and once you pour your wine once, you realize all you're doing is pressing a button. \\n\\nAs an alternative, I have a couple suggestions:\\n\\n1. Hit up one of our cities many X pours for $Y. My favorite is 20 for $20 held at the end of each month at wine on high. Significantly more samples and you can ask questions about each wine. If you can't do 20 samples, consider donating them to me. If you don't like me, look for 10 for $10 events at places like serendipity. \\n\\n2. Go to Costco or your local grocery store and purchase some random bottles and a brick of cheese. Go home with your friends and drink said wine and stuff your face on cheese. \\n\\n3. Go to Forno for HH. Wine is half off and you can try many FULL glasses for $4-5. Which is literally the price I averaged for just a small sample here. \\n\\nI guess what I am trying to say is that this is a great idea, with some interesting technology but falls short on price. In Cleveland there is a bar called Wild Eagle that lets you pour your own pint. A pint of beer is $4-10 depending on what type it is. This is consistent with normal beer pricing and on top of this, they have tons of games there to enjoy. Tastings started with a great idea, but fails to execute. It needs a HH and price adjustment to remain competitive in the short north."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is an absolute haven.

The sturgeon was their special feature for the night. It is the firmer fish out of the three and was my mom's favorite.

Today was the day that we decided to try it and I wasn't impressed.\\n\\nWe walked in and noticed the entire space was very spacious. It was quiet and there was no music.  There was no hype from the cashiers at all. Is it because Grand Opening is over? It was almost like they were there just to do the job but not interact with customers until the transaction. We were greeted with \\"hello\\" and that was it. There was only a few customers in the store. I expected more on a Sunday mid-morning time frame. \\n\\nAfter walking in, to the right, there was 2 large tables and the line of pastries (in glass displays) inches away. To the left was refrigerated to-go food such as sandwiches, beverages, cash registers and some additional pastries. \\n\\nThe concept of self serve is fairly easy but for first timers it may seem confusing. I'll do my best to explain in so if anyone happens to read this review or other ones you will be prepared. There is a rack of tongs up against the wall area, followed by a stack of plastic trays and a piece of paper on each for sanitary reasons.  There are glass displays of all pastries. \\n\\nInstructions and additional information:\\n\\nFirst grab a tong, followed by a tray, scan the glass displays and hunt down what you want to try. Some of the glass displays has prices/small descriptions and some don't at all. The staff should really stay on top of the labeling and descriptions. You may need to ask a cashier of your inquiries. \\n\\nIf you see a pastry that peaks your interest, lift up the glass window, grab your pastry with the tong (squeeze from the bottom) and bring the glass window back down to keep the remaining pastries fresh. Once you have hunted down all that you want bring the tray up to the register to pay. The cashiers will ask if you want to eat it there or take it to go. If you eat it there, they will put it on a white ceramic plate and to go would be placed into a bag.\\n\\nWe decided to eat it there, so I took the tray of goods (Matcha Pan, Custard Cream Pan, Kare Donut & Oyatsupan Dog to register) while my husband returned the tongs to area of tongs. While I was paying the lady who rang me up (possibly like the owner) had a strange reaction when my husband returned the tongs to the tong area as if we shouldn't have done that. There was no sign whatsoever ever to return the tongs to a certain area of the establishment. She didn't say anything to me so I left the situation alone. After I paid, she asked if we wanted water and I said sure. Shortly after we sat down, she brought the water to us and informed us there was a orange flavor to the water. I tried a bite of each pastry and out of all them the Custard Cream Pan was the the better one. I have outlined all the pastries below and what I thought of them. \\n\\nOrdered the following:\\n\\n-Matcha Pan for $2.50 - Japanese's version of a Chinese pineapple bun but is green tea. It was lacking flavor. This bun was rather boring in my opinion.\\n-Custard Cream Pan for $3.00 - the custard was way too runny but the bun was good.\\n-Kare Donut for $3.00 - basically deep fried dough with curry filling which was way too salty.\\n-Oyatsupan Dog for $2.50 - sweet bun with hotdog which was okay. I didn't care too much for it because I tasted mustard (not a mustard person at all).  If there was no mustard this particular pastry would of been still okay but not great. \\n\\nOverall, I was disappointed in the pastries, price, quality and service. The pastries are definitely marked up more than it should be. I paid $11.00 for 4 pastries which I know I could get so much more at other bakeries. The service was not top notch nor was it bad. It was just blah - nothing special about it either. This was my first time and last time. I don't plan on returning.

I've only gone for happy hour, and I've tried almost everything on the happy hour menu, which is a $4 menu, by the way. That's right, everything- both food and alkyhol- is $4 during happy hour. The restaurant is built in an old house and has a very cozy feel. They also have an outdoor patio. \\n\\nOk, now for the food. You know a place is wonderful when food you aren't usually a fan of is delicious.  Brussel sprouts? Not a fan. I order a serving just for myself every time I go to Salty Sow- no sharesies. Deviled eggs? They are okay. Amazing at Salty Sow- O-M-G. I've also had the fried goat cheese balls and both of the pork tacos on the menu. The pork tacos aren't my favorite thing to have, but they are still good. This last time I went, I also ordered an non-happy hour menu item, fried green tomatoes, and they didn't disappoint. They were served with guacamole and were oh, so heavenly!\\n\\nDrink selection is pretty good. My only recommendation would be to offer a light option for us dieters out there. \\n\\nService is pretty fabulous.

She was rolling balls which were supposed to be burritos. They were ripping and she was going over to heat up another tortilla and double rolling each each burrito . I know this isn't right even the people behind us notices how poor train d this girl was. Not one employee smiling you can cut the energy with a knife. The one cook was really sweaty and chopping away trying to keep up the pace. The 3 girls in the front where scrambling around getting in each other's way. As I approached the front I placed my order and said it slowly and patiently for each girl as my bowl and salad went down an assembly line. At the last girl which rolls burritos, I told her what I wanted to finish off my order. I told her to smile and that things will get better, just be happy. She did smile . Then a young man checked me out but before that one won man was there that wanted to see the manager so he left my order in there on the counter while to go orders were being stacked up and the line started to stall again. I'm still waiting and see the manager come around the corner a different customer talked to her off the side of the register complaining so I hear the young man that was tending the register say she wants to talk to you too. So something was said in Spanish then the manager walked away. I'm still standing there waiting for my order to get bagged up and paid for. I asked the lady waiting, was your order messed up? She nodded her head with a look of anger. The manager came back and they conversed  Spanish again and the lady went back to her table meanwhile the manager took her food order that was next to mine and rolled her eyes and walked out to take her break. The guy finally bagged up by food and checked me out. I was in shock how this restaurant is run. I am retired and I use to manage restaurants so I can see this restaurant is not managed very well. I use to live here a couple of years ago and ate here frequently and it ran sufficiently. This time I was here visiting family and decided to go out to grab dinner to go.

You need to come here if you're into silk worms. (WHO'S INTO EATING SILK WORMS!??) I know, right? That's why it's so interesting!  (Seriously though: any one interesting in eating silk worms, please contact me so I can join you here sometime and try them with you) \\n\\nNot to get toooooo off track.... if you aren't into silk-worms, this place is also for you. The vegetarian ravioli looked incredible, and for me these were the best lamb chops I have ever had in the United States. This and I should say I used to live in the Patagonia, where lamb is on the dinner table weekly, if not daily.\\n\\nThe one thing I didn't really like about this place is that the food entree options are pretty extreme in price and options. You can get either a $40ish/plate of lamb or steak, or vegetarian (which are both gluten & dairy) options for items in the $20 range. I wish there could be something in between, maybe in the high $20s or $30 range that was meat-based rather than carb based.\\n\\nBEVERAGE\\nSuperb. The waiter we had was also bartender and he really took care in what we ordered, what we intended with our order, and tailoring the craft to meet our every need and desire.\\n\\nAMBIANCE\\nA delight! The sunroom is cozy and modern with soft lights, hard benches, and sitting pillows strewn about. It was pretty cold in here temperature-wise, as well as in the main dining area, but it is winter after all. Bring a sweater.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nThis is what really puts it off the charts. You will feel like you are being cared for in an extremely professional and well tended to way. This was the best service I had in Portland in as long as I can remember.\\n\\nThank you, Chameleon, for being so great!"},{"name":"Oyatsupan Bakers","address":"16025 SW Regatta Ln","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"Oyatsu means snack in Japanese, and pan means bread. So here we are at a bread snack shop! I can't get enough of the curry pastry ($3.95) here. I ordered two of them this time. The outside is nice and crisp (even if saved and lightly microwaved later!), While the beef curry on the inside gives great flavor and adds moisture to the doughnut. \\n\\nI also ordered the matcha green tea cookie pan which I thought was just meh. Your can't really taste the matcha, it was just a cookie for ~$2.50. I wouldn't order it again. \\n\\nThe matcha cornet is a matcha flavored custard filled inside a cornet shaped dough. I really enjoyed this - you could really taste the matcha flavor! It's like having green tea and biting into bread, but all in one. I will admit however that the taste/texture did get repetitive about halfway through.\\n\\nOverall, I'd come back and recommend oyatsupan to others.

I've never eaten a steak at Hy's that wasn't really good, but the 20 oz., bone-in, 60 day dry-aged Canadian Prime rib steak I had recently was in a class all its own. It had a concentration of beefiness and tenderness that only extended dry aging can achieve; it was my favourite large cut of beef tweaked to the pinnacle.\\n\\nI was hoping to get one of the older male waiters in keeping with the old-fashioned charm of the place. We were initially disappointed that our server turned out to be a young female. This disappointment lasted a mere few seconds as she immediately proved herself to be absolutely top notch: attentive, knowledgeable, smart, funny, and honest. When we asked a question she couldn't answer, she said she'd ask someone and get right back to us. She was perfect!\\n\\nI fell in love with this place when it was definitely showing it's age. It might have been worn at the edges, and badly in need of a make-over, but it still had the quality of food and service that made it a favourite.

Okay, that's something I can get behind. But why then is everything else single-use plastic? They don't even have ketchup and mustard bottles on the tables, so you have to fill little plastic (not paper, - PLASTIC) ramekins with all the condiments you'll want. Same with plastic cups and straws. Sides (fries, tots, etc) are served in disposable paper bowls instead of washable, reusable bowls. None of these practices are too unusual for a fast-food restaurant these days, but disappointing for Portland, especially since they're really tooting their own horn about the cloth napkins. \\n\\nLastly, I was irked by the request for tips as I paid with credit card. The tip screen started with 15%, then went up from there.

We didn't make reservations anywhere and started shopping around on Yelp for recommendations.  One of the first places to pop up was Carmelina's.  After looking at the 4-1/2 star ratings, the menu and prices, we decided to try it for the first time.  We managed to get in right on time before the rush and were seated righr away.  The hostess and servers were very polite, professional and were on top of everything.  We ordered drinks and a few apps and off we went!\\nWe started by ordering the calamari and the meatball apps.  Both came out within 5-10 minutes and were hot, fresh and delicious!   The meatballs were spot on, homemade and some of the best I've had outside of my mom's homemade!   They were perfect and the sauce was also perfect.   Nicely seasoned and great tasting.  The calamari was cooked perfectly.  Nice and crispy but tender and delicious.   The apps were terrific. \\nFrom there, we ordered pasta dishes.  Two of us ordered the Bronx Tale special.  The third ordered the Rigatoni with gorgonzola cream sauce.  The wait between the apps and the main course was PERFECT!  There was plenty of time to eat the apps, enjoy our drinks and have a conversation without being rushed.  This was a refreshing change of pace to most places.   Especially considering that the room was now filled and people were being added to the waiting list that was almost 30-45 minutes without a reservation.  Both dishes came out nice and hot and fresh.  The pasta was homemade and some of the best in the North End.   Nicely cooked with the right amount of \\"chew\\".  The sauces were delicious and the sausage and meatballs were great.  Apparently all of their meats come from the Sulmona meat store in the North End.   So you know its top shelf. \\nOne thing to mention, the main courses that passed me by while we waited for our meals looked and smelled incredible!

She liked the Pina Colada. I hated the steak because the meat itself was of poor quality.  It came as ordered - medium - and it was cooked in a nice sauce - but the meat itself was tough as leather.

I prefer bowls that have granola, some sort of nut butter, and banana on/in them, and I figured you couldn't go wrong with original! The base with banana, raspberry, and coconut was incredibly refreshing and thick, yet simple enough to allow me to enjoy the flavors without being overwhelmed. The vanilla granola on top had the perfect crunch to accompany the smoothie, and they loaded the top with the PB (pretty sure it was homemade!), which finished off the dish and added the protein to keep me full for a while. This bowl was so delicious and truly felt so healthy - and upon reviewing the nutrition info, can confirm that this is a good health-conscious choice for a meal or snack.\\n\\nZest is a great option for smoothie bowls in Columbus. Coming in at $10, they are a little pricey, but considering the size of the bowl, how long it will fill you for, and the goodies inside/on top, it is well worth the price.

I hope they hung it up somewhere. \\n\\nThey even closed up the patio area and it's air conditioned. It helps keep most of the flies out. Much better since the last time we went. \\n\\nNow the reason for my 2 star review. We ordered the fried pickles and they seemed a bit over done. Still tasty. They brought out my Chi Cheng and it was not the tastiest burger I remember. The onions were hardly grilled, the Wasabinger spread was hardly there, and the goat cheese was not even close to stuffing my meat. The fries came out and they looked like the  jersey shore kids all dark and tired. \\n\\nIt turns out my first guess with the fried pickles was correct. They needed to change their grease and in a bad way. The way you need to change that shower curtain liner you keep staring at every morning when you are in the shower and you think to yourself...Yikes! \\n\\nI love your Mom's burgers and I know they can do better.

They have normal milk teas, handcrafted lemonades, and cold press juices. I've had their boba milk tea, and it's pretty dang good. I really like their boba pearls because I like my pearls chewy and Tea Haus makes their pearls a good chewy consistency. Also, if you don't like your drinks too sweet like me, ask for half sweet (but usually they're pretty good about asking you if you want it sweet and half sweet). Their new summer flavors are really good! I've had the passion green tea and the lychee green tea, but I prefer the lychee because the passion green tea is a bit bitter for my taste. I also recommend the blueberry mint mojito flavo! It has a weird taste at first, but after the first sip or so, it gets really good. I've also had the grapefruit lemonade (?) tea drink, or something like that. Has some grapefruit pulp, but not exactly my favorite here. If you get it, I would recommend full sweet instead of half, because I think that was the reason I didn't like it too much.\\n\\nJust had the basil fried chicken, which has a nice strong (but not too strong) basil and garlic flavor. I like how they use dark meat to make the chicken juicer and more flavorful, but definitely not meant for people on a diet. Also, their food isn't the cheapest, so if you're poor make sure you're ready to scrounge out some hefty change outta the good ol' wallet.\\n\\nGreat place to study because nice big tables and FREE WIFI! And if it's available, they have 3 nice lounge chairs near the entrance/exit.\\n\\nThis is a great location, because it's on Anderson along with Walmart, Hopddoddy, Alamo Drafthouse, etc. Nice place to stop by after eating lunch or dinner!\\n\\nFYI, they do stamp cards now!!

Hopdoddy is a chain that started in Austin.  I feel like the gourmet burger thing is getting a bit overdone, but who doesn't love a fabulous burger and fries so we decided to check it out.  \\nFirstly, it is located in Pointe Orlando.  It is right by the Valet stand, but they don't validate for valet which is currently $12.  So I decided to park in the garage which ended up costing me $6 and I had to get the stroller out for the little one so I guess I should've valeted.  The point is it sucks to pay to park for an upscale fast food burger.  \\nOnce inside the restaurant you go to the counter and place your order.  You tell them what table number you are sitting at and they bring your food out to you.  So I would say the set up is similar to something like Tijuana flats.  Many of the tables inside are high tops which are not conducive to the high chair I need and it was 90 degrees outside so I didn't want to sit out there though they were mostly standard tables.  So our options for a standard table inside were limited (maybe 4-5).  Luckily one was available so that's where we sat.  My friends and I ordered one right after another, but there was a pretty significant difference in the timing of our food.  However,one of us had a normal order, one had a cocktail and one had an allergy so that may account for the difference in timing.   \\nThe burger was very good, but by no means the best burger I ever had.  I had the primetime which was kobe beef, brie, arugula, tomato, and aoili. The brie and aoili made the bun a bit soggy.  The burger was a bit underdone for me, especially since I was sharing with my young son.  The fries and sweet potato fries on the other hand were out of this world and far superior to Burger Fi, Five Guys, Shake Shack, etc.  I would come back here for the fries alone (if I was a the Pointe anyway.  I'm not paying to park for fries).  I had a margarita which was also quite good.  I didn't have enough room to try a milkshake, but I loved the variety of milkshake options they had available.  The banana foster one sounded awesome.  \\nFinally, it was pretty pricey as well.  I had the most expensive burger since it was made with kobe, but my burger, fries, and margarita was $27.  The cheapest burger is over $7 and again you have to pay to park.  \\nIf I were at the Pointe for a movie I would absolutely come here to grab some fries and a milkshake, but with these prices and the parking situation I can't imagine I will make a trip just to come here again."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is a joke.

It's extremely filling, and honestly you could probably eat it just by itself if you wanted to. \\n\\nKeep in mind that when you order pretty much anything to eat in the restaurant that one order is large enough to feed at least two people. So either split it or rest assured that you're going to have leftovers. \\n\\nOnly reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because we were waiting for our check for at least 10 minutes.

There's about 15 options for your protein, including Katsu Chicken, Beef Bulgogi and others. Both of these are great, but who wants to settle for great when you can curl your toes?!? The spicy squid and pork belly is a combination made in heaven. The afore-mentioned pork belly is *still* cooked to perfection and, when combined with spicy squid, will deliver a culinary treat that will set a new benchmark.\\n\\nThere are plenty of other menu items... I've tried the Pad Thai (made with fish sauce) that I was hoping would be great... I like meals made with fish sauce but this didn't work for me. The Ramen was heartily recommended to me and was good-not-great. The Bulgogi Bento was up there but can't keep pace with the Spicy Squid and Pork Belly.\\n\\nThe decor is nice, the staff is friendly and service is prompt *if you ask for it*. You can be in and out in 45 minutes if you mention that you're on a schedule. The price is a little ritzy for lunch, but worth every cent when you're eating the best of the best."},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I want to move to Portland and eat at this bakery every day.

Just when I gave up hope we got a text that there was a cancellation and my night was saved. I grinned from ear to ear as we walked in and the place did not disappoint. I got a glass of Sauvignon blanc, fried calamari, and crazy Alfredo (extra spicy). As I am not a big seafood eater I was a bit concerned that the calamari came with no sauce to dip, but that calamari did not need anything (besides lemon) to distract from its tender, juicy, deliciousness. The crazy Alfredo is earned it's rank as my new favorite pasta dish in Boston. It has chicken and sausage in it and a the most exquisite kick of heat. The fresh pasta was perfectly cooked. And the sauce... could move mountains. I stared at the picture I took of it for the next week. The atmosphere was just what I wanted in the north end. It's a pretty tiny restaurant with only a few tables, and the staff seems to have known each other all for years. \\nThe only con I have is that there's a very limited cocktail menu.

They were large, head on, and fried crisp in a light corn starch dusting.  I enjoyed eating the entire shrimp including head, legs, and tail.\\n\\n- Fried cauliflower - Dry fried with hot peppers.  Simple and sichuan pepper mouth numbing.\\n\\n- Tofu:  I don't recall the style.  Pre-fried and then added a slightly sweet sauce. \\n\\n- Tofu and fish:  Funny, this is the entree I chose for the group but the one I ended up liking the least.  Soft tofu and soft fish fell apart together into a soupy mess.  It was also bland compared to the other entrees.\\n\\n- Fish and pickled vegetables: stew type of meal.  Not as pickley as I expected, but very good.\\n\\n- Szechuan pork:  Pretty good, didn't stand out among the other dishes.\\n\\n- Frog legs:  Fried with sichuan peppercorns.  For some reason they cut the legs up splitting the meaty thigh from the bony leg.  The meat was still tender and moist.\\n\\nI think I'm still forgetting one or two things.  It was an overall amazing lunch.  I consider myself very lucky to work alongside such an ethnically diverse group of folks that can point me out to wonderful dishes that I would otherwise never have a chance to try.  Oh yeah, this is an old strip club next to a Waffle House which brought back memories for me of stopping by (Waffle House) after a night partying at The Continent clubs back in the day...good times."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm sorry to say, I don't believe the hype.  A restaurant very rarely gets 4.5 + star reviews on Yelp so my expectations were high.  The place is a bit hipster-y with a \\"too cool for school\\" vibe.  It was also balls hot inside.  Not cool, heh heh.  The first disappointment was that it took 20 minutes to receive a glass of beer and wine.  Then, my friend I was dining with didn't like her wine and the waitress was a bit lack luster in her response.  If you're paying that kind of money for a glass of wine and food you should be gracious and just replace the glass without an attitude, in my opinion. \\n\\nWe had the tempura okra as an appetizer and it was actually very tasty.  I would give that 5 stars.  We also had the crispy Brussels sprouts leaves which were tasty as well.   For dinner I had the crispy chicken thighs and she had the steak which was a flank steak special.  Neither were worth the price or 5 stars in my opinion.  They were dishes I could easily cook at home for a fraction of the price and have a better taste.  It was so hot in there in fact we totally opted out of dessert, which was not the norm for me especially since it was my birthday dinner.  We also asked a random waiter to tab us out since we rarely saw our waitress.  Disappointing.

Waitress was sweet, but she went missing a few times. Dirty dishes just piled up at the end of our table which is really annoying. When the table was finally cleared (we had been done for a while), we still had to wait for almost 10 minutes to get our check. At this point, there had been only 1 other table the entire time.

It was served at room temperature with cold rice. The black beans were hot and probably the best thing that I ate here. The shredded chicken had no real flavor to it, just seemed a standard unseasoned protein left to cook in a slow-cooker for 24 hours until it completely breaks down. It was just disappointing. As soon as I went to pick it up and felt it was cold and limp, I wished I had at least gotten one of their burritos.\\n\\nThe fresh salsa was good, although very mild - between the complimentary chips & salsa and the black beans, easily the 2 best things I had.

The beef rib was quite pricy (market price and she paid ~$40) so would recommend getting it with someone to share if you want to try other meats. The brisket was really flavorful as well. It wasn't as tender as I've had at other places but was still good. The pulled pork hit the spot. I like the taste of the coleslaw but wasn't too big a fan of the potato salad, too much celery for me.\\n\\nThere is free parking in the lot and in the neighborhood behind the restaurant."},{"name":"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen","address":"875 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"The whole experience was subpar. We have been to Cheddar's before in other parts of the US and never had this bad of an experience. It started out with our booth or the carpet in the area where our booth was, smelling like pee. The smell was overwhelming. Our waiter was nice, the other staff that bring the food to the table were rude. \\n\\nThe food was not fully prepared and was cold. We ordered buttered croissant and the butter that is supposed to be melted was hard. I ordered fried chicken with gravy and they did not give me enough gravy. On top of that, the chicken was undercooked. I gave some to my wife to try because it tasted weird. My son tasted it too because we thought it might be me. But when I cut into several areas we could see the pink. We all went home grossed out and with a belly ache. \\n\\nThe manager came and apologized and even offered to give us something else, he took the chicken took off the bill.

There are many restaurants in the area, so the SOLE purpose of attending this restaurant was because we knew our allergies would be accommodated. I had been to the 110 grill before at another location, and the server was very proud of the fact that it was a scratch kitchen, so virtually any item on the menu could be personalized for my allergies. \\n\\nI am disappointed to report that this wasn't the case at all last evening. The gluten free flatbread tasted like cardboard. We have a diabetic in the family, so a pasta dish was requested with vegetables instead of pasta and the server seemed so confused and annoyed by this request that it was truly uncomfortable. A person in my party even tried to make a joke about it to cut the tension and the server didn't even look up or crack a single smile. His body language expressed that he was clearly annoyed. \\n\\nThe crab dip was mediocre, the parmesan garlic wings were undercooked, in my opinion. \\n\\nIf you're going to advertise that you cater to allergies, you truly need to follow through on that claim. I think we had too many people in my party disappointed in the experience to ever return, which is a shame because the menu looked incredible and the idea of your restaurant has so much promise for a person who can't generally dine out at many places. What you offer is unique, and would make a person choose your restaurant over others.

I mean, seriously, how badly can you f*** up a burger? Well apparently this place is great at it!\\n\\nFirst of all, I have to sympathize with all the other yelpers here - the place is confusing. I stood for a few minutes trying to figure out if I was supposed to seat myself, or wait. \\n\\nI had the supreme pleasure of being told by the asian burger nazi where to sit. Thanks, you sweetheart you....that dirty table next to the garage door window was awesomely cold, thanks to an extremely drafty garage door. It would have been no problem had I not had to wait 25 minutes (more on that coming right up). \\n\\nI really had my heart set on a delicious, juicy, well-made burger. This is never-frozen Grade AAAAA+++!!!!11 Alberta Hippy Beef they are selling, right? Wrong. Think disgustingly chewy, too-lean, cold meatloaf. Yeah, just like mom used to reheat for you cause she was too tired to cook.\\n\\nSo, 25 minutes for a burger. Why not give a warning? Or an explanation. This looks like a fast food joint, feels like a fast food joint. And if it takes itself that seriously, there is no reason to not tell people there is going to be a wait. Just set the expectation, that's all. It might be forgivable if the food is worth it. People wait for food all the time, but a burger isn't in that category. It is, by very nature, a fast food item! And seriously, what are you guys cooking them with? Matchsticks? A solar oven? When I asked the other server who brought my basket--of-garbage-disguised as-a-meal why it took so long, she just shrugged, and went to clean another table. \\n\\n- The meal -\\nMy cold, disgustingly soggy burger that was overcooked, and bland beyond belief, was the WORST burger I have ever had. The bacon was the only highlight. The extremely glutinous chinese bakery bun (gross) was charred, and I could not taste anything else except for it, and bits of peppery rubber.\\n\\nThe fries - oh dear. Fries that tasted like they were scraped off of someone's sneakers, and then were frozen, and then microwaved. Soggy, cold, super-starchy mush. Fries that rodents would turn their noses away from. I was so upset with the experience that I dared not even try more than one bite. \\n\\nI promptly decided I was done. But had to wait - again - for the servers to pass by me three times before I could get my bill. Passed my card, she didn't know how to run it. Amateurish, but not surprising considering everything up to this point. \\n\\nAsked \\"why the wait was so long and if it was normal\\". \\nShe said that \\"it was really busy, and atypical.\\" \\n\\"Okay, but the food was terrible, and no, I'm really sorry, a manager can't help us here now.\\" \\n\\nThe place was nearly empty when I went there (which should have been a red flag in the beginning. I said that I would not be returning, and that there was nothing that could ever be done to salvage my business again.\\n\\nWhew - OK, I think we're done here, and I'm still hungry and mad about the experience here.

Once a month we find a new place to try.  All different foods from different countries.  We stumbled across Celeste and said let's go.\\n\\nThis place is small, maybe 21 seats I think,  so best to have a reservation if going for dinner.  I called on a Wed and was able to get a table for the following weekend.   If going for lunch though, a walk in has a good chance of getting a seat.\\n\\nAs mentioned this place is small.  Not sure how they would even be able to accommodate a group of more than 5 people.  And even though I know this place is small, my one pet peeve is a servers backside in my face.  It wasn't too bad here but it happened enough to mention.  Besides that the decor is very lively, it's bright, open kitchen, clean.  Everyone there had a smile and was friendly.  When it got busier, service could have been a little more attentive, I honestly think they could have had one more server to help but it was....ok.\\n\\nOn to the food....most of it was good, some was really good and maybe one thing was just ok.   We started off with a ceviche dish and it was ok.  It could have used a bit more seasoning, so a little bland.   We also got from the specials menu something made from yucca that was filled with vegetables and then baked or fried.  It was good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with not too much stuffing.  For the entrees we ordered again from the special menu.  My friend got the artichoke stuffed ravioli in pesto sauce with mussels while I got the scallops with squid ink fettuccine.  Both of these dishes were really good.  The pesto wasn't overpowering, the mussels were plump and cooked perfectly.   There wasn't too much sauce with the fettuccine.  The scallops were a smidge bland but overall enjoyed both dishes a lot.   Lastly dessert, there were only two options so we went for both.  One was this caramel mousse and the other, my apologies can't remember the name, pumpkin flavored almost like panna cotta dessert.   The mousse was very good, not too sweet and a really nice texture to it, light.   The other was a bit too sweet and I think it should have set a little longer as it was a little runny.  \\n\\nOverall my friend and I thought this place was really good.  We would definitely go back if we were in the area.  The only thing we did not like was the little pre-dinner 'snack' of pan fried corn niblets?  They were complimentary and was in a little salt dish.  These niblets were very dry and had no taste at all.

Although small Asian Markets have existed through out the east side of Orlando for a while now, the newly opened Eastside Asian Market is the largest one to open to date and is a welcomed addition for those living on the east side who need to buy their Asian goods without traveling far.\\n\\nEastside Asian Market sits just east of the 408 exit on Colonial Drive in a newly built plaza next to the BP gas station. The market is sparkling clean and new, stocked with the essentials of Asian cooking from soy sauces, noodles, rice, dried mushrooms, and more. The even have a large selection of ramen for those of you who are on a tight budget or going to UCF. Though they are not as large as the ones downtown or on the west, their selection should be sufficient for most shopper's everyday needs.\\n\\nEastside Asian Market is owned by a local family here in Orlando who are devout Buddhists and vegetarians. You will notice that they have a large variety of vegetarian items at this Asian market including the veggies and fruits, they have tofu products and \\"faux\\" meat items that spice up the typical vegetarian diet.\\n\\nThey also quartered off a section of the market into a cafe with a developing menu specializing in Taiwanese dishes and, all of course, vegetarian. At their cafe, they currently serve boba milk tea, taro slush, flavored black tea (passionfruit, mango, strawberry, lychee), shaved ice, fruit slush, fruit smoothies, special buns, egg rolls, dumplings, egg pancakes, and are still adding items as time goes on.\\n\\nOn a recent Friday afternoon, I had the chance to try the famous vegetarian \\"special buns\\" (2 for $4.99). The recipe is a secret and has been made by the owner Ronald's father for over 20 years at home as a treat. The special buns were delicious, spicy flavored slices of tofu and mushroom in sweet \\"mantou\\" wheat buns. I also had the deep fried dumplings (6 for $3.95) and they were also vegetarian and pretty delicious, not unlike the korean mandoo dumplings that I have had served in New York. I washed everything down with a nice cool cup of flavored passionfruit black tea.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I think Eastside Asian Market is an awesome addition to the life on the east side of Orlando and hope they continue to bring fresh produce and food to Orlando."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The 4 stars is solely for the brisket and atmosphere.

Maybe the world? \\n\\nI discovered Veggie Galaxy when I moved to the Boston area 6 years ago. Life has never been the same. I love that they serve fully vegetarian (and easily made vegan) food that is...not healthy! Sometimes we want fried food too! And protein besides tofu and lentils! \\n\\nYou can order soups and salads here, but where Veggie Galaxy really shines is in their ability to deliver diner food that just so happens to be vegetarian. They take traditionally meat-only dishes (chicken & waffles, meatball subs, buffalo wings, fish & chips, fried chicken, reuben sandwiches...I could go on) and make them vegetarian, and I love them for that. No, these things do not really taste like their meat counterparts, but a) I can eat them! and b) they taste delicious! The food can be heavy, but to me that's the point - I don't need yet another restaurant to serve me a grain and vegetable bowl with tahini. I can make that at home. And their menu is quite large, so lighter options are available too. \\n\\nVeggie Galaxy is for mostly everyone. Those who expect vegetarian meat substitutes to taste exactly like meat probably won't like it much. But Veggie Galaxy offers \\"weird\\" vegetarian things like seitan and tempeh for the more adventurous, and \\"safe\\" vegetarian things like tofu and veggie burgers. They also serve breakfast all day! \\n\\nFor me, their desserts (which are 100% vegan) are good, but not great. It's hard to compete with butter and eggs. But I really enjoy the chocolate cake and the sheer fact that they offer a seriously impressive array of tasty vegan desserts makes me happy. \\n\\nWe moved out of state and this is probably the place I miss most.

You just have to change your expectations when you go to a Chinese restaurant and ask whenever you need something.\\n\\nFor our group of four, we ordered the Szechuan style fried fish filet, green beans with eggplant, and chicken chow fun. It's a bit annoying that you also have to order rice separately, but at least it's only $1 per serving. I understand the rationale since a lot  of people don't eat rice and it reduces waste. We got three servings of rice which came in one big bowl. It was perfect for the amount of food we ordered. Everyone enjoyed the food. I thought the chow fun was a little too oily but the family liked it. The portions are large since it's served family style - I would say three dishes for four people was perfect and I don't think our whole meal was more than $60.\\n\\nNext time we come, I would definitely get the Szechuan spicy fried fish filet and the green beans with eggplant again, and then choose a new dish to try.

They didn't even seem to understand what I was asking for.  Our waitress didn't speak any English.  As in not enough English to explain it was a new owner and new menu.  Another employee came over to explain and we sadly picked other items.  We ordered two appetizers and three mains.  Two of the three never showed up. We told them we were still waiting for two dishes they said it would be out shortly. 20 minutes later I asked again and they said that they delivered the two dishes to the wrong table.  We gave up and asked for our check since we had already been there an hour and a half.  They also had coupons for a free dish which I gave with our check but they didn't give us a free dish!!  They should have given us something free for the mix up, and/or the coupon, but we got nothing.  I didn't have the energy to try to explain that our whole meal should have been free and we left.  This was such a disappointment. I can't believe they kept the same name but none of the dishes are the same.  The food we had was pretty good and I am sad we didn't even get to try most of what we ordered.  We also had our 15 month old with us, so an hour and a half meal and not getting most of our food at a basic Chinese place just doesn't cut it.

Of course we said we'd wait, we were fine with that.  But then the hostess comes back a few minutes later and asks us if we would rather sit at the table right on front of the kitchen.  Some people may have liked that but it was hot in there and we didn't want to be seated right in front of the hot kitchen.  The party that was at our table didn't want to leave so we felt like we were being pressured into going to that table so as not to ruin the other people's night.

To be clear, the food wasn't terrible; it was \\"just average\\" in that everything we ordered missed the mark slightly. This \\"just slightly missing the mark\\" was frustrating to me because it meant that nothing was bad enough to send back to the kitchen and have redone, and this, therefore, resulted in a dinner where each dish was slightly disappointing. And this culminated in a dinner that was quite disappointing. \\n\\nWe ordered the cheese bread, oysters, and the table side caesar salad to start: The cheese bread was very straightforward--nothing to rave about. To be fair, I can see why some people love this item: It's a mixture of butter and three types of common cheeses (cheddar, swiss, and something else I can't remember), spread on dry french bread. It is then toasted. It is slightly greasy and could benefit from a fresh element. \\n\\nThe oysters were fresh but absolutely tiny. \\n\\nThe caesar salad just missed the mark in that the salad was over powered by the condiments. It was a salty salad. I loved that the taste of the anchovies came through, but this coupled with an excessive amount of cheese completely overpowered the lettuce. \\n\\nFor the entree, my partner and I both ordered the steak neptune with the jacket potato. The potato was great with the toppings. The steak might have been good were it not completely over seasoned and then slathered in hollandaise sauce which was also too salty. The crab was inedible because it was too salty. The steak might have been slightly undercooked, but again, nothing on the plate was bad, but it definitely wasn't anything to rave about.\\n\\nFinally, comparable steakhouses in Seattle, where I'm from, tend to offer at least a free dessert or something comparable for special occasions. If dinner had been absolutely perfect, I doubt I'd mind this, but after a mediocre dinner, it's hard to want to pay out for/get excited for a dessert that is most likely to be just average. We ended up getting the chocolate ice cream because it wasn't worth paying out for the other desserts at that point. \\n\\nWhen a restaurant is on the pricier side, I expect each dish to be good and exciting."},{"name":"Kokoro Tokyo Mazesoba","address":"100 1st Street E","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm a ramen fiend, so the minute I heard that there was a Ramen place opening up in North Van I was READY.

If you don't know this place, it's very easy to miss, b/c they plaster 8x11 sheets of specials all over the window, and only in Chinese too. So unless you looked inside, you just won't know how busy & good this place is. And I will be honest, the interior decor is outdated, even for China's standard today. sSrvice is very fast, but they also clean off the tables super fast & loud too. This is not a super classy place, but don't judge the food on the looks of this place. This place also reminds me of a seafood place I've been to in China (http://www.followmefoodie.com/2010/06/china-busiest-restaurant-ive-ever-been-to-famouslocalfresh-seafood/). \\n\\n\\nI've been here many times, the Salt & Pepper Soft Shell Crab is fantastic all year long. And guess what, you can ask for your food to be cooked MSG free too! For $12 bucks, you get a whole dish of soft shell, much better than any spider roll with 1 claw  you can get for the same price at any sushi joint in the city (ok maybe slightly exaggerating here). \\n\\nThe twin-lobster dish is also very good. However, there have been some variation in the size of lobsters, mostly due to what season you come here. Typically in the late summer/early fall, lobsters are huge. It really doesn't matter for me, the price is fantastic and if you want more, just ask for another plate or ask for bigger lobsters. \\n\\nAlso in the summer, they have freshly boiled live red shrimps. Those are expensive (as expected), also they're the same kind that the japanese eats raw. If you haven't tried this, you're missing out big time. Note this is not an all season dish though. Another excellent dish is steamed fish, you can choose quite a few variant, from cod halibut, grouper etc, quite healthy choices. \\n\\nI've also tried several non-seafood dish here too, and they were all very good. Mostly this is a Cantonese style chinese food place. And if you've ever been to Shenzhen's fisherman's village (forgot what it's called exactly, but they had a lot of fish tanks, including fake boston lobsters), it reminds of that place a bit. \\n\\nIf you don't know what to order, I recommend looking at other ppl's table and just point.

Though I normally frequent the one in Maitland, this Lake Mary location is close to work and breakfast for lunch is always an option to me. So what makes this location stand out from the rest? The size. This location was so much bigger than the other ones I've visited which I'm sure helps on those busy weekends. Monday through Thursday lunch time is usually quiet. Fridays however are a bit crowded as if it were already the weekend. Lord knows I wish I could start the weekend early myself. They stick to the same menu as other locations so yes, you can indulge in the Million Dollar Bacon here! I love their Italian omelet with fresh potatoes and wheat toast. I would post a picture but I forget and eat my food too fast. I've told my husband to remind me next time. You can't go wrong with their lunch either, I love the open chicken salad sandwich with broccoli cheddar soup. It's my go to when that's the soup special. My only downside is the sweet tea and small entrance. The tea every time I go is never sweet, I've given up and just started ordering water, I know the horror!

The crazy alfredo really impressed me. It's flavor was unique to Carmelina's and unlike any alfredo i've ever had before. I enjoyed that it was cheesy yet very light, in comparison to the typical dish where your pasta is swimming in alfredo sauce. There were bits of tomato, chicken and sausage mixed in, and it also had a bit of a kick. \\n\\nThe FOOD is FIVE stars, and I would highly recommend !!

This BBQ establishment has been migrating around Austin from its old days on South 1st @ Elizabeth St, to East 6th and the spots it had on Cesar Chavez.  Now established in this new building, this is a change from the previous setup.  You are no longer waiting in a lot under the hot Texas sun with some open picnic benches.   The new LA BBQ digs are certainly an upgrade for the better. \\n\\nSo now in a building, biggest difference is now air conditioning.  The line wraps around the inside of the building where there are multiple tables to sit at.  Quickie Pickie is a semi grocery store.  They have all sorts of drinks, fruit, chips, wine, and other food for purchase.  The building has an shaded bench area outside in the front, then a gravel bench area on the side of the building.  There is now a walk up window to grab your to go orders.  One thing that has now been added is the large selection of draft beers on tap.  Plenty of local beer is available here.  An employee will go through the line, take your beer order and bring it back to you.  Also there are TVs inside that will have sports telecasts playing.  The line of LA BBQ still moves at the same pace,  I would say the average is 2min per person ordering.  I was 20th in line showing up on a Saturday 10am, service starts at 11am and got served around 11:40am.  If you arrive and are waiting in the line outside the doors, you probably have a solid 45min - 1hr wait time. You can drink beer in the parking lot from the server or just go inside and grab some yourself. This is one of the best BBQ places in town, so a wait should be expected!  They serve till sold out which is usually sometime after 3pm depending on the day.  \\n\\nI have been talking all about the location, what about the BBQ?  Well like I said in the former review, LA BBQ is one of the best spots in the state for Texas BBQ.  Brisket, sausage, beef & pork ribs, pulled pork, turkey, meat sandwich combinations, and then the sides.  If you are with a group of people, just order some of everything.  It is just how Texas BBQ should be cooked and taste. The $30+ beef rib is expensive but it is for sure the best thing on the menu (just realize they sell out fast).  You cant beat the strong pepper and slow cook that LA BBQ is known for.  Its kinda hard to decide on what you want since everything is made great.\\n\\nNow if you are ever in Los Angeles, make sure to look out for their new location on the west coast.  LA BBQ has grown up over the years.  The days of John Lewis running the cooking has changed, and now Ali and Leanne now have their own crew making the same quality BBQ.  I will say it again.  The best BBQ in the entire country is located right here in central Texas.  You can go to Lockhart, you can go to Taylor, Driftwood and then all the spots around Austin.  If you are not from this area, just realize if you appreciate the greatness of BBQ, you need to make a trip here.  LA BBQ is on the Texas Monthly magazine top 50 TX BBQ list.  I would advise ordering a little of everything.  If it is still available, try out the beef rib!  You will certainly wait in line, so be prepared to make an event out of it.  Order some beers while you mingle in line.

The interior has a minimalist feel to it with neutral colors and wooden looking tables. There are five tables for six people in the shop and it seems that a lot of the people who come in get their orders to go in large shopping bags! One woman just filled up two shopping bags! \\n\\nWhen you walk in you will see the selection of what is available for sale today on the right hand side. They do not have a huge selection but everything they have is great tasting and will not disappoint. I just wanted to get one matcha melon pastry and it was so good I tried several others and I had to get another matcha to take home! Unlike some of the other bakeries that make matcha melon pastries, they only use high quality matcha. You can always taste the difference. The matcha does not have a bitter taste to it at all. It is as smooth as I have had in Japan. \\n\\nIf you like Japanese style curry you have to try the  Beef Curry pastry! I generally don't like fried pastries but I could eat this everyday! It's not too heavy or soggy from the frying and the breading is light. When you bite into it you can not only taste the beef but you can actually see the pieces of meat inside! \\n\\nYou can look into a part of the kitchen and can see they are making everything fresh. While I was there several new pastries were coming fresh out of the kitchen. My curry pastry was still hot when I got it. \\n\\nI decided to purchase several other pastries to take home including the Melon chocolate chip, the Sweet Mount Hood, An Pan and another Melon Matcha. By the way, if you didn't know, the use of the word melon is a reference to the appearance of the pastry since it looks like a small melon. They are not actually flavored with melon.  \\n\\nSome of the other baked goods available when I went were the Custard cream pan, Sea salt butter roll, Azuki (red bean) an pan, Fruite boat pastry, Strawberry pastry, Croissants & Choco hats just to name a few. \\n\\nThey have hot tea available including Matcha, Oolong, English Breakfast, Earl Grey and Peppermint.\\n\\nJulie at the counter and all of the staff were polite, friendly, professional and willing to engage in conversation with the many questions I had. \\n\\nAs far as the hours go, since they just opened they have been trying to find what days and times work best for them. Julie said they open daily at 8:00am and close at 5:00pm but will be closed on Wednesday. \\n\\nOyatsupan is a great little bakery and well worth the trip in my opinion.

We both have Horseshoes, not Hollywood Casinos, so I was def excited to check out a different casino. I love that this Casino is in the middle of a high traffic, shopping area. The casino itself is HUGE with plenty of FREE self serve parking. There's also valet if you'd rather just do that and be right at the front door. Like I said, this casino is huge. You walk in and you just see open space filled with people, slot machines, tables, bars, tvs, etc. The center of the casino is one of their bars/restaurants, o.h., which we ate at. Attached to this sports bar-y restaurant is a circular area that is lined with huge projection screen tvs and there's a stage where they have live music- pretty cool (unless you're sitting trying to wait for your food and the drummer sits down and just bangs the drums once every 3 seconds like a metronome - NOT so awesome..... - and yes that DID happen to us lol)\\n\\nAnyways, everything is nice and spread out which is great, you do not feel cramped even by all of the slot machines. We were there to grab dinner and play craps, so that's all I can review on. There are a total of 8 craps tables in the entire casino. When we got done with dinner, only 4 were open. The nice thing was two of them were a 10 dollar minimum when the night started. (two were 15 dollar mins). I know a lot of the reviews talk about the high minimums here, so they must have lowered them after hearing from the public, which was nice for sure. The tables were super crowded- like so much so that there were groups and groups  of people waiting around the 10 dollar minimum tables. We spoke with one of the employees who was walking around and she said they were going to open two more an hour later, which was good. And, they mentioned minimums would all be 15 dollars at that time. Not horrible though. \\n\\nMy actual craps experience at this casino... sucked. mainly because my luck sucked that night. I quickly lost everything I had brought to gamble with - which I'm usually ok with as long as I've at least had a good amount of game time, which I didn't :-\\\\ but it's gambling. For the people who write poor reviews b/c they lost money... please understand that you're GAMBLING.......\\n\\nThe players and the dealers usually MAKE the game. And, at hollywood, unfortunately the dealers weren't that great. It's gotta be so hard to keep track of everything so I'm ok with the fact that they were slow. But, most of them just stood there with pouty faces. Dude, have some fun, interact with your table and make sure they're having fun!! It just kind of put a damper on the moods at the tables. \\n\\nOverall, this casino is pretty good, not horrible at all. It's gorgeous, huge, spaced out, has good food (from what I've had), and is well-kept. \\n\\nWill I be back though? Probably not, since I'm not from Columbus, unless I'm meeting my friend like I did this particular day. Do I think you should check it out? If you like to gamble, definitely.\\n\\n(ps I love you with all my heart yelp, but why are you asking if this casino is good for kids? haha)"},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I keep bragging to all my friends that I found the best Italian restaurant in the North End.  No, really.\\n\\nThe food and experience here is so amazing. When you first come in, they get you bread to dip in oil and parmesan cheese.  The bread isn't stellar but everything else more than made up for it.  I highly recommend the appetizers as they are both gigantic and amazing.  I loved the bruschetta which came with huge pieces of toast and lots of fresh ingredients piled on.  I have been there three times this summer alone and ordered the same entree every time: pasta with eggplant sauce.  I don't even like eggplant but the great Italian Gods were steering me towards it so I took a risk.  I wish I had better ways to describe the meal but it arrived on a large oval plate covered in pasta.  The pasta was smothered with a thick layer of the eggplant sauce which was a tomato based sauce with strips of breaded and fried eggplant.  It was so good that I ate WAY more than I should have and STILL had two extra meals out of it.  The prices are more than reasonably, even doubly so if you compare them to other North End restaurants.\\n\\nDon't just take my word for it... I first experienced it with two friends who ALSO agreed it was amazing and we made immediate plans to go back later in the month.  I took my very picky mom here and she said it was the best Italian she has ever had.  This is truly a significant statement from her.\\n\\nHowever, there are signs that this experience may not be for you.  If you go at a peak time (dinners during tourist season, lunch on weekends during tourist season), you're going to wait.  It may not be the longest wait in the North End, and likely other comparable restaurants also have a wait, but you're going to wait.  They don't have a waiting area so you just cluster on the sidewalk outside waiting for them to call you name.  While I didn't wait at all the two times I went for lunch during the week, I waited 40 minutes on a Friday night.\\n\\nIt's also not the fastest service.  If you have somewhere you need to be, I wouldn't count on this place to get you out in time.

Decided on Foley's after reading reviews in Yelp and Hobomock Swamp FB group.\\nWe arrived shortly after opening, 4:15. Seated immediately. By the time we left there was a wait.\\nHostess led us to a booth when a woman came over and said we couldn't sit there because \\"waitress name\\" wanted to eat, she was here all day. We said, no problem, we'll move. Hostess says no, no its ok, \\"waitress name\\" said she'll take care of you.\\nWe should have run for the hills but we stayed. I need to rely on the signs the universe sends my way. \\nWaitress came over, took drink orders. Brought out house made chips, they were good.\\nOrdered the Sampler plate for apps. Came out quickly. Buffalo chicken (4)tasted a little off, vinegar it bbq sauce with it. Potato skins (2)had a weird cheese in them, I did not like them at all. Ribs were ok. On the bottom was a ton of onion rings. Rings were delicious and crispy, very good.\\nServer brought out rolls and cornbread. Rolls were warm and good, had similar at other restaurants.\\nUnfortunately the butter was frozen, solid! Normally I can warm in my hands but it was that frozen and wouldn't thaw quickly. The cornbread, soft and moist just not my taste, it was a little too sweet for me.\\nSon ordered clam chowder, it was hot. Taste was ok.\\nMy husband and I split the Fisherman platter. We were informed they were out of clams but would add extra of everything else to make up for it.\\nPlatter had 3 scallops, 4 shrimp, 3 pieces of very thin fish and a huge bed of onion rings. Left me wondering where the extra was! Fries were served on a small side plate. Fries were hot and crisp but a weird taste that I didn't care for, maybe it was the oil, not sure. \\nServer brought the food to the table. When\\nShe put the Fisherman Platter down, a not so good smell of fish was now at our table. The fish was very thin and a pink color inside. Waitress said this is haddock, I'm thinking not! Fish tasted as bad as it smelled. Scallop was actually good. I know, I know, why and how could I even try it while smelling that fish, all I can say is I did. Shrimp, had one bite, not the whole shrimp, one bite. The onion rings on the bottom were absolutely inedible. So, so sopping in grease. Now remember, the onion rings in the app were great.\\nSon ordered steak tips, medium rare. Some were cooked properly, others extremely well done. The taste of the steak tips, not a fan. My son is 18 and eats anything. He only managed to eat 2 steak tips.\\nHe didn't like the taste or the texture. Served with butternut squash that was good.\\nWaitress was friendly however she never came to check how our food was. We were long done eating, she was at the table next to us chatting for about 15 minutes before checking how we were doing. She saw the full plates and brought our check. Put the check on the table and said, \\" I'll take that when your ready unless you want coffee or dessert.\\" We declined. I let her know my thoughts on the fish and sopping greasy onion rings while complimenting the great onion rings in the app, she said, \\" I'll pass your opinion along\\".\\nMy opinion is, I will not give Foley's another chance and it's a shame, I really wanted to like this place, my maiden name is Foley.

It is different from most other places around. Definitely a little more on the expensive side. I would not recommend for simple mexican food. \\n\\nAgave has several nice things going for it. The food is all amazing, served promptly and is designed beautifully. All the dishes are a work of art. If you go, get the table-side salsa and table-side guacamole. They do not give you free chips & salsa which is unfortunate (again not  like other places) but they make this salsa exactly how you want it before your eyes and it is insanely better than any salsa you get at other places. The gauc is also a must. The non table-side is served cold, and while it is still better than most it still loses some freshness. The table-side is made to order and is fun to watch. Both are a must!\\n\\nIf there for lunch I recommend the Poblano chile soup. It is on the cheaper side, smaller size good for lunch, and the preserve on the bread is amazing. Otherwise their burritos are good, and not all served at dinner. For the evening meal I recommend the Agave Tamales (gorgeous presentation). Well balanced between the dry corn meal, the black beans, and the light sauce and veggies. Quite a lot of food as well. Otherwise the spinach enchiladas are great. Made with fresh spinach (not very common I have found).\\n\\nThe place is usually busy and waits can sometimes be long at dinner. Lunch is usually easy to get in, and later evening as well. While waiting venture upstairs to the lounge. You can order drinks and appetizers while waiting. Make sure you are in the LOUNGE part with the couches and not the tables. Here is it is happy hour from 7 till 10 and the appetizers are all cheaper, as well as there large selection of Tequilas.\\n\\nGreat food & service.

Out of all the dishes we ordered, the chicken liver mousse was my favorite followed by the brussels sprouts. I love how the brussels sprouts dish just consisted of the leaves. They were so crispy, it was like eating a brussels sprout leaf chip. Do note that the happy hour portions are smaller than the regular portion. That being said, it's still a very generous amount and if you're super hungry, two dishes per person should be enough. \\n\\nThe drinks were fantastic! They were tasty and boozy enough.

I got the garlicky mussels with pasta and they were so good!  I don't like to take seafood home so I ate the mussels and left the pasta portion of mine behind. Literally, there must have been an entire box of pasta on my plate. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and was moderately loud.

The food was fresh, authentic and delicious. The fatoush (salad) and Cornish hen are musts. The lentil soup and vegetarian platter were excellent. The hummus was outstanding. the kabob and shawarma were pretty darn good but not as good as the other dishes.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and patient. No one seemed to mind that the kids were making a mess.

Immediately when I walked in, I was seated. My server took my drink order and she came back within 5 mins to take my order. I did not have to wait for my food for a long period of time. The service was really fast. I feel like the food was okay. The eggs were bland, nothing great about it and the pancakes were okay as well. Bette off going to IHOP because the eggs tasted just like IHOP and at least IHOP has numerous types of pancakes and syrup option. I gave it three stars because 1. The food was not worthy of 5 stars and 2. I did not like my server at all. My server seemed a bit off. Not once did she smile or made me feel comfortable for being there. When I was finished with my meal, she gave me the receipt, came back to take the payment, and then when the payment was paid she turned and left without saying a word. Not even have a great day or nothing. I only wished I had another server to make my experience better."},{"name":"Joy Teriyaki","address":"8136 SE Foster Rd, Ste 280","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Ordered to go was great!

We had a reservation because we had more than 15 ladies and were seated in a special area. Though it was a little removed, we had very attentive service. I'm sure it wasn't easy to handle a party quite like ours, but our dinner was seamless.\\n\\nWe shared a bunch of food items and drinks. The drinks were good but I found them a little sweet so I then stuck with my usual vodka soda.\\n\\nI recommended this place to a few friends who found this place too salty, but I think if you're sharing food with a group you don't notice.

We knew from the name and reviews that Gladys Knight's would be more of a tourist trap, but we also knew for sure that it would have chicken and waffles and that it had to be somewhat palatable - and it was.\\n\\nThe restaurant is decked out in pictures of celebrities and album covers and winnings of Gladys Knight - it is a theme restaurant after all.\\n\\nWe got the Chicken and Waffle (aka midnight train) and the Shrimp and Grits and a side of southern corn. We asked the server if we should get the fried shrimp version and he told us grilled is better - I dunno if it's better since i didn't compare, but it was definitely delicious. The fried chicken was soooo good but i didn't think eating it with waffles and syrup added to the it. If I ever go back, I'd stick to the fried chicken without the waffle, although my bf might disagree.\\n\\nThe corn was terrible. It looked nothing like the colourful stuff in the pictures, and didn't taste like anything.\\n\\nEach dish was about $13 each so the total after tax and tip was about $45 - not too cheap.\\n\\nIt's definitely a safe bet, but I'm guessing there is probably better places for soul food in Atlanta."},{"name":"Community Smith","address":"866 W Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I was in town for the football game and decided to eat where I was staying due to the weather. This was one of the best things I could have done. \\nI started off with lunch. I had the signature Smith burger. It consisted of a chargrilled burger with melted cheese and the topper was a tender short rib on a toasted bun. Wow! This was one of the best burgers that I've had ever. The burger was cooked to my liking. I was a little skeptical about the short rib but it was so tender and full of flavor. The fries were hot and just the right amount of salt. The burger will fill you up!\\nSince lunch had me stuffed throughout the game, I wasn't ready for dinner until the game was over. I started off with the appetizers. I wanted to try a little of them all so I did. The peach habanero wings, deviled eggs, bacon mac & cheese, meat and cheese tray, tuna nachos and the scallops were all amazing. My entree was the Asian grains spicy stir fry with blackened shrimp. Make sure you have your server make the shrimp blackened because they don't come that way automatically. The stir fry was amazing. Also on the side were nuts, cilantro and sriracha. I used the bits and it added the right texture to the meal.\\nOk, after sleeping all of that off, my brunch was the pancakes wit sausage and eggs. The pancakes were fluffy and the edges had a crunch like I like them. \\nThe service I received was outstanding. Carolyn, the manager and our server Tony, went above and beyond to make sure I had everything that I need for a great experience."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],j={key:0},D={key:1};function G(s,e,n,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,N)):w("",!0)])}const L=u(O,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-ffd0be74"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/27.md","filePath":"library/27.md"}'),F={name:"library/27.md"},Y=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(L)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
