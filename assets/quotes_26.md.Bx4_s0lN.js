This seemed to fit the bill nicely as their menu features all kinds of dishes, fit for all palates and at a reasonable price point.\\n\\nSo I took my hungry self there, accompanied by Erick H. on a nice, spring evening for some dinner and was starving upon walking in. We didn't have a reservation and were gambling on them having a table and the gamble paid off. Our hostess seated us within a couple of minutes and our waitress Jennifer arrived and presented us with some menus. I tried to order a local beer from Slumbrew but they were out. I picked another one... and... they were out. I then decided to get a Chimay beer because I noticed on a blackboard right outside the front door that they had a deal going on where you got to keep the glass for every Chimay ordered. I figured that they'd at least have that one in stock unlike the previous two. \\n\\nAs I ordered and took a quick glance around the dining room one thing hit me: this place is spacious. It's not huge but they didn't overcrowd it by trying to jam tables next to one another. We had a ton of elbow room which was great. It wasn't all that quiet in there, actually it was surprisingly loud considering how many people were present which was a bit annoying. However the decor which featured vintage printing-related materials of all sorts was neat and somewhat distracted from the noise.\\n\\nAs our beers arrived we decided to share an appetizer which, in our case, was their black bean hummus ($7) which comes with some pita chips, some grilled tofu and some cilantro lime sour cream. It arrived a few minutes later, served in a giant, hollowed bread bowl and was served not just room temperature cold but very cold. Actually I found that surprising because I associate bread-bowled items to be warm or hot and when I took my first bite I was rather confused by it. I guess it tasted okay but wasn't all that great or memorable. The side of tofu added absolutely nothing to it and was bland as all hell; I wasn't crazy about the dish or the way this meal was starting but had hopes for a redemption through a solid entree. \\n\\nThe entree that followed by a plate of wild boar carbonara ($21) which was average. It was pretty cream heavy (like most carbonaras) but the seasoning seemed a bit off. It lacked real depth of flavor and the boar was hard to dissociate from the rest of the dish; it probably could have been a sausage or something else and I would have never noticed. The pork belly wasn't noticeable either but the spring peas added a nice texture and freshness to the dish that lightened it up a bit. It was okay. \\n\\nThe one thing I did like a lot about First Printer was their extensive menu. It's not like the Cheesecake Factory in size but it's pretty damn long and is all over the place. All kinds of flavors, ingredients and price points. That being said, it's also a very confusing direction making it difficult to people to get the venue's identity. It's not Italian, it's not American, it's not French. What is First Printer? International?\\n\\nOne last point I do want to make is that our waitress flat out sucked. Jennifer was slow. Very slow. And she didn't speak up at all, reminding me of a Seinfeld episode featuring the \\"Low-Talker\\". We both held our breath every time she approached, desperately trying to hang on to every word she said but most of the time just nodded not being able to discern even half of what she said. It got pretty frustrating. \\n\\nAll in all the place seems promising but the lack of identify makes them cook all kinds of dishes which turn out to be average. I'd rather see fewer but better items and more focused direction cuisine-wise. That being said, the diversity isn't all bad. They have everything from pasta dishes, salads, sandwiches, seafood, pizza, you name it. I'll return at some point I'm sure, in search for a much better experience...

I'm not a huge fan of honey (I prefer agave) but that's fine because all you have to do is tell them and they'll make it more to your liking. You can also come up with your own concoction and they'll make it that way if you'd prefer.  \\n\\nThey recently started punch cards so you can work your way toward a free smoothie every once in a while.

These were insanely good with the perfect combination of dense, cheesy polenta with the crispy, sweet bacon and the subtle addition of honey and cheese. It was seriously one of the best things I have eaten in a long time. I could barely finish one of the two polenta cakes on the plate! You know that I took that home for leftovers later and it was still incredibly tasty. This is one of those dishes that you might be like \\"Eh, well, sounds good in theory but it's just some polenta\\" but no, at least split this was some good, worthy friends. \\n\\nThe Upside-Down Smile: My boyfriend got the ham and cheese omelet that came with hash browns and an english muffin. The omelet was fine; filled with a lot of ham and seasoning was on point. The hashbrowns were pretty terrible--so bad in fact that we each had a bite and decided that was more than enough. The top was nearing burnt and the bottom was underdone. \\n\\nThe Scary: The waitress (very nice, great service all around) suggested that I get the fried chicken with the polenta cakes (I had overlooked it already came with bacon apparently) so, of course, I say \\"Sure! Bring it on!\\" A nicely sized fried hunk of chicken came out on its own plate and looked very promising. I picked off a piece of the perfectly crispy crust and it was well-seasoned. My boyfriend took a big bite and thoroughly enjoyed it and I was a bit more dainty in my knife and fork approach. Upon slicing into the chicken, the middle looked strange; pinkish, juicy but not sure if it was \\"succulent\\" juicy or \\"undercooked chicken\\" juicy. My boyfriend took another bite and it was fine but I was definitely put off by the look of the chicken after that one cut. I did sample a small piece but something was just a-miss with it. \\n\\nOverall, the decor and menu of The Original is very appealing. It seems like a great spot in Downtown to bring a bit more traffic to as well. I feel like there might be something missing from making this place great but I can't quite put my finger on it. I will definitely come back to try some more unique dishes."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Not as great as I thought it would be given all the hype I hear about it from around town.

Example: I had an Ohio honey and vanilla latte. That's just not  a combination you see that often, but it was very yummy. The honey made it sweet, but not cloyingly sweet and the vanilla brought a lot of warmth. One big flaw with the coffee was that it was served to me in a glass. Like, a water glass. If you're a coffee shop, you should probably serve your beverages in the proper vessel, like a coffee mug! That is a big pet peeve of mine(the same when a Mexican place serves a margarita in a tiny little glass instead of a margarita glass). \\n\\nThe food was pretty good. I had the fresh mozzarella sandwich and as many other people have stated, it was really good.

But we only got seats indoor, must go back for the outdoor before it gets too cold.\\n\\nThe waiter said that he preferred for us to tell him our appetizers and entrees all at once. At the time we were a little confused, but we realized later that this allowed him to orchestrate the meal for us.We ordered 2 starters, a shrimp one and a salad,The waiter looked at our starter selections and brought out the salad second as it would double up as pallet cleanser too. I have not seen this much thought and attention before.\\n\\nSTARTERS:\\n\\nShrimp Stuffed Calamari with Spanish Chorizo, Crisped Tentacles  and Laurel Aioli  - This was such a well-crafted meal, and they served it in 2 separate portions seeing that there were 2 of us! The soft spice of the chorizo,wrapped in the grilled calamari skin provided the body while the tomato and basil puree added that bit of moisture and sweet/tartness. And the crispy fried tentacles added crunch while the laurel aioli finished the mouthfull with its unbelievable aroma. What a beautifully complete and well-thought out dish!!\\n\\nMarinated Golden and Red Beet Salad with Whipped Vermont Goat's Cheese, Candied Walnuts and Basil Oil  - when we ordered it, i thought twice about ordering a completely vegetarian starter, but BOY was I pleasantly surprised!! This was among the best things Ive eaten in a long while..picture this, a perfectly round bed of goat cheese, topped with pickled red and gold beet cubes with candied walnuts and surrounded by circle of bright green basil oil dribbled with red beet juice. An incredible visual treat of white,red and bright green... The smooth yet pungent goat cheese was cut by the freshness and sweetness of the beets with the walnuts adding the crunch and the basil oil for an intense yet fresh mouth-feel..Brilliant concept and amazing execution. Tiniest of criticicms is that i thought there was a little too much cheese. But trust me, you WILL be blown away by this dish.\\n\\nENTREES:\\nDuck Breast with a Grilled Romaine and Duck Sausage Cr√™pe and a Pistachio-Blackberry Compote - I got my duck done medium and it was cooked perfectly. It was a beautifully prepared duck. The compote was a very good sauce to cut the richness of the duck. I dont think i was blown away by the duck sausage crepe. But a fine dish nonetheless.\\n\\nLocal Roasted Chicken with a Summer Tomato, Thyme and Goat Cheese Risotto - This was a dish of 2 beautifully roasted chicken pieces on a bed of risotto. The risotto was truly delicious, one that will stay with us for long time.strong flavors from the goat cheese and the sundried tomatoes and with the aromatic hint of thyme to complement it. The chicken was moist,super tender but with a perfect brown skin  and seasoned perfectly. Lovely.\\n\\nDESSERT:\\nNew pastry chef  Sarah Koob's signature dish is the popcorn ice cream but we were so full, we ended up getting the Creme Brulee Trio of Meyer lemons, Sweet Basil and Vanilla bean. It was very good. Perfectly caramelized top with the strong yet smooth and rich flavors of the creme. Also the concept was well thought out, as the three flavors had different levels of richness with the vanilla being the richest, the sweet basil for lighter but sweeter change and if u felt overwhlemed by the creamy richness, you always have the light tart lemon flavor that would cut down the heaviness. Very nice.\\n\\nOVERALL:\\nI had a tremendously satisfying experience here, and would not hesitate to come back again or recommending to my friends.

I expected BAR FOOD and a decent portion of it. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered their $3 margarita and I had a patron margarita. Guess what? Same sized glass for both --tiny!!! When you go to a bar and order top shelf liquor, you expect a higher price than for wells liquor. I've worked at many a bar and I know and understand this very well. What we didn't expect was a $9 Patron margarita that didn't even taste like it had triple sec in it, let alone Patron.  Fine, whatever, I'm waiting on my food! \\n\\nWhen the fish and chips came out, we should have just got up, paid for the drinks we had and left. They charge $9.99 for the F/C and what came out was utterly appalling. The guy handed us our two baskets with a moderate amount of french fries and the smallest piece of cod ever. We were so hungry we ate it anyway but I was furious. At least load up the fries if you're going to completely shaft your patron. It couldn't possibly cost you that much to load up on the fries.\\n\\nWe left in a hurry and we were angry. The whole reason we came was to pound their $3 margaritas, have some bar food and head home. Instead, we left beyond disappointed. I highly doubt we'll ever walk into this bar again. I'm utterly shocked that they've been in business there as long as they have."},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I'm glad that other people are bothered by the loud music - I was feeling old.

Figure a 4.5 average star rating (for the Vancouver spot) is pretty convincing. \\n\\nOnce you get inside, you're basically right at the counter with certain appetizers and dessert items to make you start pondering what to get. That's before even getting the dang menu with some 100+ more items to pick from. Fun....\\n\\nYou can either dine in or take out, and being on a time crunch, I just opted to get my food to go. Everything here is very affordable, especially the various banh mi at $3.50 apiece.\\n\\nThe BBQ steamed bun, a.k.a. char siu bao ($1.50) was very well executed, but I wish I could have had more pork in mine. Sure, I could wish for a larger portion size as well, but maybe I just need to eat three at once.\\n\\nThe #1 Special Banh Mi Tan Tan ($3.50) has Vietnamese-style ham, lean pork roll, fried pork, and head cheese. The usual banh mi veggies and condiments are also added (liver pate, homemade mayo, picked veggies, cucumber, cilantro, onions, and sliced jalapenos).\\n\\nI liked that there was just enough mayo to make me realize it was there, none of this \\"would you like a sandwich with your mayo?\\" I might see elsewhere. Fresh vegetables, crunchy pickled veggies, and wonderful flavors overall. The meat and head cheese were good, but didn't scream \\"amazing\\" to me. The bread, while decent, was a bit chewier than I would have liked it. Perhaps there's an option to toast (or further toast) the bread?\\n\\nThe apple pie pastry ($1.75) has an amazing golden brown exterior. The puff pastry was buttery, yet very flaky and fairly light. They stick a small pretzel stick on the top, and the puff pastry itself seemed to have pretzel-like aftertastes. It indeed got messy when I tried to eat it. I also thought the balance of puff pastry to apple pie filling was a bit off (hoped for a little more filling for the amount of puff pastry received). Shouldn't complain though, since it tasted great.\\n\\nThe Pate Chaud ($1.25) is a pretty tasty appetizer. Pork meatball in puff pastry. Again, for me, probably a bit too much puff pastry, but the meatball inside had nice flavor.\\n\\nSince the panda is not one to shy away from anything deemed edible, there's a fresh durian smoothie on the menu ($3.25). Add tapioca bubbles or lychee jelly for 50 cents more.\\n\\nI admit that I got the durian smoothie more for the experience than anything else. It's not something I'd get again, but one can't fault the panda for being adventurous.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back to try their pho, as much cooler weather returns to the Pacific Northwest.

First was a special for the nite...coquettes of parma ham and manchego cheese deep fried.  I can't remember what the sauce was called, but it was tasty.  We just wish the fat in the deep fryer was newer.  It cast an old grease taste to the dish.  We also had the forest wild mushrooms on toast that was nice.  The server suggested we try the Sturgeon and my date and I almost decided against it, but we went with her suggestion.  It was the best dish of the evening.  The lemon, garlic sauce with a wine reduction was so good we ordered bread so that we wouldn't leave a drop of this sauce on the plate.  Our final entree was the seafood paella.  It was good, but I have rarely seen such itsy bitsy teeny weeny scallops and manilla clams.  It did have two nice shrimp also in the mix.

Tokyo-style sushi in the heart of Buckhead!!\\n\\nIto-san is super cool, accommodating, yet still very serious and devoted to his art.  He imports a lot of his fish from Japan, and those pieces that may not be in season he steers away from or will purchase some farm-raised, of course, from Japan!\\n\\nFresh wasabi, individual nigiri pieces at omakase (so perfect temperature), and even an old-school WWII Rising Sun flag show you this is a man dedicated to Japanese cuisine.\\n\\nUmi is more traditional style than Tomo, in that there is less emphasis on cooked dishes although Ito-san does that in spades too.  The space is very modern but still in a warm and inviting manner.  The woods are all soft colors and the energy of the packed crowd is infectious.\\n\\nService is top-notch, attentive and pleasant, and some of the servers are Japanese which I prefer!  Ito-san even introduced me to his wife who helps with some of the creations, which I thought was very thoughtful.\\n\\nI did the chef's omakase of course.  Here's a rundown:\\n\\n1) Edamame -- perfectly cooked, just a little sweet, the right touch of salt.  Very good (Southern) portion.  ;)\\n\\n2) Avocado salad -- this was OUTSTANDING.  Half an avocado which is cored for you yet left in its shell and there is a delicious, light dressing in the center.  Served with lemon and onions.  Perfect awesomeness\\n\\n3) Sashimi course -- a lot of standouts here.  The O-Toro was buttery smooth, the live scallop and Mirugai were also great.  Super premium hamachi was buttery as well\\n\\n4) Miso black cod -- I like that he listened to me and included a grilled item.  This is a hefty, 6 ounce portion, perfectly cooked with a crispy skin, nice miso marinated sweetness, and buttery (sorry to use the same adjective, it works) fish.  Served with a ginger stem\\n\\n5) Nigiri -- served edomae-style, so one piece at a time with soy sauce already applied.  I was very pleased with the selection and variety of fish.  The pacing was fairly brisk, but I told Ito-san I was ravenous.  I did about 15 pieces, no joke.  Some were very traditional such as Kampachi and Toro (can't go wrong with that), while others were a little more eclectic such as Amaebi with Uni on top, seared Uni, etc.  Takko was served as a sashimi portion, and he did not give in to the Salmon fixation, since he knew I was a serious connoisseur.  The best sign was that the Kohada was wonderful -- oily, a touch of sweet, and oh so tasty\\n\\n6) Bean sprouts / veggie handroll -- I told him I am a health freak, so he went green at the end which was much appreciated since I devoured a lot of fish.  The greens had some good bite to them, and the nori (seaweed paper) was crisp and high quality\\n\\nA few other notes -- Umi serves pressed sushi, which is unusual and very cool.  Essentially you're getting a mix between nigiri and maki without the nori.  Pressing the sushi and rice allows the piece to melt in one's mouth.  Awesome. \\n\\nThe only ding was that the ginger served with the sashimi and nigiri was the low-quality red kind.  Good-quality ginger should be a pale yellow.  This may be only a minor oversight, and I'm sure it'll be rectified.\\n\\nWhat a great addition to the Atlanta culinary scene.  Now you have three top-notch, maybe four sushi restaurants (Umi, Tomo, Hayakawa, and Taka)."},{"name":"Houston's Restaurant","address":"3321 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious spinach dip.

Tex-Mex burrito + chicken, 2. Buffalo salad + chicken, and 3. Pangoa bowl + steak. \\n\\nThe ingredients did seem fresh, and I'm a fan of their healthy food fast mission.  Although I did experience what others seem to have mentioned about how they mix up orders or forget ingredients.  \\n\\nOne thing that impressed me was their perfectly cooked chicken in my Tex-Mex burrito and Buffalo salad. Dry chicken is my biggest fear, but not a problem with Freshii. Not sure if I got lucky, or if that's a consistent thing as I'd ordered all of my dishes at once for breakfast lunch & dinner on a busy day. I suppose I'll have to repeat my orders to tell.\\n\\nThe Buffalo salad was pretty standard: lettuce, shredded carrots, a sprinkling of tomato, aged cheddar, lots of spicy buffalo sauce and a touch of ranch nicely tossed to save me the extra work. Their menu lists celery, but I don't remember there being any in my salad.\\n\\nWhile I know to expect an actual dish to differ from their perfectly modeled food pictures on their website, there is quite a huge difference in the amount of ingredients (besides the cheap fillers like rice or lettuce) that you actually receieve vs. what is pictured.  It's almost enough to call false-advertising (based on my zero years of legal expertise) Or maybe it's just creative placement of all the ingredients on one side paired with a slanted camera angle. (If salads took selfies, Freshii would be hashtag-InstaFamous)\\n\\nMy Pangoa bowl didn't have the lime wedge or hot sauce (listed on the menu) which is basically the essence of its flavoring.  This wouldn't be an issue usually, except I had it delivered and couldn't go up to the counter to ask for the missing sauce, so my first impression of it was that it was a tasteless dry bowl of rice. A dousing with my own bottle of Cholula made it right though. The steak was tender enough for mass-made beef.\\n\\nOverall, I would give Freshii another shot."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place had an excellent caramel macchiato!!!

Great for Vegan (look for the tiny bunny rabbit pic next to the offering on the menu for vegan-cool right?) or Meat Eaters (look for anything with meat in it, lol!). This is delicious food \\"through and through\\"; many offerings of uniquely made salads...I had the Jicama Salad with shredded carrots, shredded Jicama, shredded cucumbers, bean sprouts topped with roasted peanuts, cilantro sesame seeds along with this outstanding orange sauce which is their own special pasember dressing; as a side, were what they called \\"hawker croutons\\" which are sliced & pan seared tofu.

There is also a good mix of northern and southern Indian foods.  Many dishes contained meat of some form, but a few vegetarian options were available as well. \\n The set up for and near the appetizers is especially impressive by the way, with bowls of chutneys, spices, fresh fruit, and sliced vegetables nearby to create your own perfect combination.  I had quite a bit of fun with that.\\nOther hightlights would be the tandoori fish, idli with coconut chutney (though I found it tasted very good with almost anything), and the absolutely amazing desserts.  One was a variation on the typical gulab jamoon (the name is evading me at the moment) which has a green interior and a submarine shape, along with the usual fantastic taste.  The other item was a form of halwa I believe, with raisins, nuts, and a great gooey texture. ...I actually got seconds I liked it so well.  Alas, my waistline grows...  \\n\\nAs to things to watch  -I would mention there was a third dessert available that looked like rice pudding... and I want to say it was labeled as such (I should keep better notes)... but it tasted more like raita than the typical Indian rice pudding (salty with a hint of cucumbers).   Refreshing in its own way I suppose, but not a personal favorite. \\nAlso, if you try the tomato dal and do not like spicy things, do not chomp into everything haphazardly.  That particular dish is made with full chilies whose heat creeps up on you after a few moments. I confess, I was busy watching the Bollywood music videos and did not notice my error until I was dearly wishing I had ordered a lassi for the sake of my tongue. \\n\\nSpeaking of music videos, the restaurant (which is quite large, and even has a separate banquet hall you can reserve) has 4 TVs in the main dining area.  When I was there, two were dedicated to kids shows, one to some sort of entertainment news, and the last to Bollywood videos to which the soundtrack was synced.  Always entertaining.  Otherwise, the decor is typical for an Indian restaurant - simple yet relatively elegant, with warm colors.  \\n\\nService is also fine - polite and efficient. \\nDo note that if you order the buffet, they might not bring the check to your table.  Apparently the method is to go to the host stand when you are finished and tell how many were in your party.  Not realizing this, I did sit around quite a bit longer than I had planned (and ate more than I really should), which I didn't mind.  However, I would note that the place gets exceedingly busy during the buffet (at least on a Sunday) so it's probably best not to linger without reason.  \\nWhen I first arrived around 11:30, I was alone.  By the time I left...about 12:30 perhaps?...every table was filled and people were waiting.  This, despite the dining area being fairly good sized, with one long table to accommodate big families.  \\nNeedless to say, come early.  I believe you can reserve a table as well, either online at manaa's website or by phone.\\n\\nPrices seem a bit higher than a lot of Indian restaurants, with many meat curry dishes in the $12~15  range.  The buffet itself is $12.99 on weekends and $9.99 on weekdays.  However, it is quite extensive and does come with a drink (soda, iced tea). It is certainly not a bad deal compared to standard menu prices.  \\n\\nBy the way, take-out appears to be available, and you can order online.  Manaas is also available for off-site catering.  \\nThings to keep in mind."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"It can a bit of a wait since the restaurant is small, but that is totally worth it.

This donkey was hungry!\\n\\nBehold, about two blocks from the $1 airport bus stop I chanced by Blue Ribbon.  The interior kinda reminds me of your typical fast-casual in LA-- it was simple, clean, and they had few big screen TVs (that happened to be showing the Lakers lose, too).  The place was empty on a Saturday afternoon; looks like they probably never fill their 30-something capacity.\\n\\nThey have a full array of Barbeque goodies, so I got a half pound of brisket to go.  The attendant (who was super down to earth and kind) grabbed a big hunk of lean brisket out of a heating container and carefully sliced me off a share.  With just meat, sauce, and fork, I tore out of there like a bank robber.\\n\\nThe brisket was a little chewy and not too hot in temperature. I definitely had better while in town (at e.g. Sugar Shack). The meat was still very moist, fall-apart fresh, and had a little golden shine to it.  Had it been marinating in a sauce (like pot roast), I think there's potential for some 5-star food there.  \\n\\nI shoveled down the $8 half pound of meat in about 2 minutes while running to the bus, so don't take my criticism too seriously.  I'd definitely go back (especially while on my way to the metro 100), but for a serious sit-down lunch I'd probably try somewhere else near by."},{"name":"Shut Up and Eat","address":"3848 SE Gladstone St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Good sandwiches!

After living in Austin for nearly ten years, I figured it was time to give you a shot.  My friend was playing a show there this weekend, so a girlfriend and I made a date to go see her sing and eat some Mexican food.  And I guess that was my first mistake: going to the restaurant hungry.  If I had just eaten a snack at home or if we had just gone to eat somewhere else before going to the show, my night would have been so much more enjoyable, listening to some sweet music and munching on chips and salsa.  But instead, let me describe what ensued:\\n\\nAfter a (needlessly) confusing time navigating the parking lot, we made our way inside where we were instructed to seat ourselves.  Ok, easy enough.  About 15 minutes later the waiter-- or was he the host? I'm thinking maybe both?-- brought us some menus.  I was pretty much ready to order before the menus came because I'd researched their menu online and knew that I wanted the one vegetarian option: cheese enchiladas.  Not my favorite entree, but how hard are they to screw up?  10 minutes later, the waiter/host shows up again to take our drink orders, but all 6 of us were ready to order food as well, considering we had been there almost half an hour already.  At this point my blood sugar levels are dropping, and I'm beginning to get hangry.  Fortunately the chips and salsa arrive as the waiter/host takes our orders.  He writes nothing down, but I don't question it, I'm just impressed by his memory for all of our requests.\\n\\nIt takes 30 minutes for the first plate of our order to come out.  My friend receives her beef tacos which are cold, but we urge her to eat now, not to wait for the rest of the food to arrive.  10 minutes later, my plate comes out, with the incorrect order, wrong enchiladas, sauce, and sides.  So he apologizes and returns to the kitchen, or the bar, or the door.  I'm not sure, because I don't see him again for another 20 minutes when he returns again with a more correct version of what I've ordered, though the sides are still wrong.  At this point, I ask for silverware, as none of us have received any yet-- an hour into our visit.  Meanwhile, no one else at our table ever receives their entrees (--ever).  The waiter/host returns 10 minutes later with my correct sides, advises me my food will be half off.  Ok.  Can I please get some silverware.  20 minutes later, silverware arrives with another apology, and now my food will be free. \\n\\nSo I finally taste the cheese enchiladas.  They're greasy, cold, and the sauce is sweet.  Sweet ranchero sauce?  That's a new one for me.  I don't eat more than the one bite. \\n\\nWe wait for another 20 minutes so my friend can pay her bill.  We sit with the credit card and receipt on the table, but he never returns.  We leave.  In total, time spent: almost 2 hours.  \\n\\nNever again, Jovita's.  Never.  Again."},{"name":"Herons West Coast Kitchen + Bar","address":"900 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Friendly and  Attentive Service by Ciara and Arvin - Thank you.\\nGood lighting from the windows surrounding the restaurant.\\nRelaxing, good place for meeting people and talking.\\nFood was delicious  - Arctic Char fantastic, Rack of Lamb perfect, Beef Tenderloin tender, Scallops delicious, Apple Tarin - Yum, Ciabatta bread warm and fresh.\\nFood presentation was pleasing to the eye and palate.\\n\\nEverything we ordered was absolutely scrumptious and the staff was warm and inviting!!\\nDefinitely recommending."},{"name":"Freshii","address":"24 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"So on the basis on the food alone I'd give this place a 5.  The food is fresh, tasty, and has lots of variety.  I got a make your own salad.  They had lots to choose from, but buyer beware, almost everything tasty that you can add to your salad costs more, want tofu, advocado, olives, and goat cheese?  That will cost you about an extra 5 bucks on top of your 6 dollar salad.  Then want to try some awesome organic juice?  Ok but it will cost you about 3.99.  My salad and drink wound up costing me a whoping 15.99 that is a lot for lunch, even if it is really good, so on the basis of price this place gets  a 3. \\nNow to get to the ordering system.  I can't tell if the choas is caused by the ordering system or by the general layout of the place being bad.  You walk in and they give you a clipboard to check off what you want, then you turn it in at the counter and go to the register to pay.  Something in this process seems to not really flow right and you wind up with this huge mass of people standing around the register.  I think they need to tap into the poorly used space in the back and have a seperate area for pickup and payment so everything flows better.  That should help.  So 2.5 stars for the really poor use of place and bad layout.\\n\\nOverall, I'll be back to try out more because I really like the food, but only on days when I'm feeling like I have some extra cash to spend and feel like dealing w' the choatic layout and confusion of this place."},{"name":"The North Star Coffeehouse","address":"7540 N Interstate Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This cafe is a cozy little haven for relaxing and working in the noisy, busy area of North Portland.

He then left without giving us menus or water and didn't return for a while. Let me emphasize this place wasn't busy at all, there were plenty of open tables. Eventually a different waiter brought us those things.Throughout the dinner we awkwardly had two waiters half-appling it so I never knew who our waiter actually was. \\n\\nWe ordered a sausage appetizer, and they brought and left it without ever giving us silverware. We then stared at our food and waited 5 minutes for someone to walk by so we could get silverware in order to eat the food sitting in front of us. The waiter didn't even recognize this fact or apologize, he just looked annoyed that we asked for something... I couldn't believe anyone could drop off food without realizing we never had silverware! That is the rudest thing you could possibly do as a host/waiter/server, because we had food sitting in front of our faces and no way to eat it.\\n\\nI could keep going on but you get the point.

I think the bartenders are good at what they do and the waitresses are good at hustling (food, not the corner of Stuart and Tremont).

They usually ask for a credit card which is fine. \\n\\nI think most of the sandwiches are tasty.  Their turkey burgers are SO yummy but they come pretty stacked, so open up wide! The blue cheese fries with sweet worcestershire reduction are a bit of a let down but you can get them on the side of your sandwich for a little extra moola if you're interested.

No matter the mood you are in, you can find it - from Vietnamese to Sushi to Pizza and everything in between (and of course Jeni's Ice Cream). \\n\\nI absolutely love the dining area, which is on the second floor and overlooks the hustle and bustle of the North Market. Such a cool spot. Sometimes tables can be a little hard to find because it gets busy - especially Saturday lunch - but there are worse places with longer waits. \\n\\nEven if you aren't hungry it's a fun place to spend an afternoon. Try smelling the various spices at the spice shop. I never go to the North Market without stopping by the salsa booth. They always offer free samples with such a great variety of salsa. \\n\\nIf you need a ton of groceries, probably not the place for you, but if you are looking for a few fresh items - definitely make a stop here.

My friend ordered the rigatoni bolognese and the pasta came out crunchy. Our waiter tried to tell us that's what \\"al dente\\" is. If you can't pick up rigatoni with a fork without it breaking, it's probably not cooked.

Maybe I'm picky because I lived in Italy, but I really don't think it should be that hard.

We passed the time looking at the menu written on the large mirror until someone came out and told us that it was 'just for show.' Oh. Alright. \\n\\nIt was cutely decorated for sure, and there were some interesting looking menu items. My mom ordered the Cuban sandwich, I did a lunch special with the house salad and the soup of the day, which was supposed to be a \\"pork and tomatillo stew.\\" Please note the quotations, I will be getting to that later. I ordered a coke and it ended up being a Mexican coke, so I was well on my way to being pleased. \\n\\nThen things took a terrible turn.\\n\\nFirst the salad arrives. Yuck.

It looked that unappetizing. \\n\\nClassy woman that I am, I find myself at Taco Bell quite often. They recently introduced green sauce packets, and I very much like squirting one onto my burrito. Well, this was basically a bowl of Taco Bell green sauce that a bunch of seeds thrown in, and I quickly learned that it can only be enjoyed in moderation. Needless to say, I didn't finish anything, and the gnat parade quickly grew in size. I guess they should be able to enjoy the food if I wasn't going to eat it, but it still grossed me out. My mom had to put a napkin over her sandwich while we waited for a to-go box so they would stop crawling all over it. \\n\\nThe server was friendly, and asked me how I enjoyed my food. I simply muttered 'good' and looked down at my hands so he couldn't see I was lying. I am also weak and non-confrontational.

The Waitress seemed like a nice good person not like a liar at all so I'm assuming the kitchen here just REALLY SUCKS!! \\n\\nMy father said the Vegetarian Gyro was over flowing with sauce and extremely salty, the Garlic knots were CRAP, no sauce, no olive oil, just plain small bread with some cold raw garlic on Top (if they served that in NY they would be shot). \\n\\nThe Avogolemno right away looked funny, the color was totally off. Once I tasted it I realized what the lazy and cheap idiots in their kitchen did. They dumped Campbells Chicken Soup Broth into a cup with some shitty Orzo pasta and called it Avogolemno. NOT COOL AND REALLY SHITTY!!! My parents tried the soup as well and agreed it tasted just like Campbells Soup. \\n\\nOnce I opened up the sampler I realized something was even further wrong when it looked like I received a childrens portion of food for $16.00, WOW WOW WOW.

My only reservation is that they seem to come up a bit short in terms of value, when there is now lots of  competition.  I've happily paid more for a pizza in Portland than what I paid at Via Tribunali, but overall, when I look at the total cost of two salads and a smallish pie that my wife and I shared for lunch, I'm thinking that it was not the best value in town, though the texture and char of their crust was exceptional.

My friend and I got there around 1:30pm and were waiting for 2 other friends to show up.  Since we wanted to sit together, we were told we had to wait for the other 2.  Which I find kinda dumb since seating is community-style.  (Another thing is the people next 2 us had a person join them twice while we were there, bringing their party to 4 by the time we left.  So basically - if you go and are just waiting for 1 or 2 people to join you, don't tell the hostess.  Just go get seated and have your friends join you when they get there.\\n\\nAnyway, the main reason for the 3 stars (and I'm being generous here) was the food.  On our 1st visit right after they opened, everything was outstanding!  The German potato salad was yum, my house sausage on pretzel bun was great.  Good curry wurst.  And our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and drinks and was a really friendly guy.  Today's waiter was none of those things, but may have been new.  He barely convinced me to try the Sunday special -- roast suckling pig.  Mistake on my part.  The outside set-up was pretty unappetizing and I should have turned back around, gone inside, and changed my order.  \\n\\nA sweaty, albeit friendly employee was cutting up tiny (literally bite-size) mushy pieces of bland pork while talking to random gawkers who stood there sampling the very pig I'd paid $10 for.  Who the hell gives samples for a special menu item while paying customers wait their turn.  I felt like an idiot.  After he put a fairly small mound of pale meat on my tray, he proceeded to scoop out my cold German potato salad from a barely covered plastic container (and yes there were some flies in the area) and some boring shredded cabbage slaw (nothing but cabbage and vinegar, mainly) next to that.  I was so disappointed in this \\"special.\\" \\n\\nI plan to go again because I want the Banger's experience I had on the 1st visit.  I will not get the special.  I also will not get the Thai Peanut sausage that one of my friends got and hated, saying the texture was comparable to mush.  I will get one of their exotic offerings, or one of the brats, or something like that.  I'll get a jar of WARM or if I'm lucky HOT German potato salad.  I will get a beer (maybe that's what made the difference the 1st time???).

Joy Cafe had been on my list of places to try out, and I suggested it when someone declared a preference for dining in Midtown. Our party of 4 had to wait roughly 20 minutes even though it was about 1 PM Sunday. We were placed at this semi-private 6 seater table off to the side on the patio so we pretended we were VIPs. Nice!\\n\\nOur server was cheery and helpful, though it took her a while to show up initially. When one person couldn't decide between strawberry or blueberry pancakes, she came to the rescue when she offered up both as an option. Perfect! Real maple syrup too, for the win.\\n\\nI went with a brunch staple, the eggs Benedict ($10). It'd be a plus if the portion was a tad bigger, and the giant plate didn't help trick my mind into feeling full. The hollandaise wasn't the best I've had in Atlanta, but it wasn't bad, definitely more mellow, and I liked how attractive the whole deal was. The serving of bacon was reasonable too. The fruit cup was lovely to see and eat. I was pleased that it wasn't 99% melons, and there was even a bevy o' berries: blue, straw, & rasp. \\n\\nEveryone else seemed pleased with their entree selections. I was definitely giving the biscuit & gravy the once over several times. Might be getting that next visit to Joy Cafe. Well, if good enough for Guy Fieri....\\n\\nAt one point, a man came over to ask how everything was and jokingly asked if he needed to go into the kitchen and slap people around. Uh, awkward?\\n\\nParking is one reason why I infrequently venture to Midtown. There are some spaces but there's a lot across the street, MARTA, Uber/Lyft, and those Bird scooters I see all over the place now. Bathrooms (one single for men and one single for women) were fine.

I don't want white/clear snot - I want some yolk, some cooked egg, and voila. UGH.\\n\\nYes, the beer menu is impressive.

It was nice that even on a busy night, my party of four was able to get drinks and grab a seat in the bar area while waiting for our table.

There weren't a lot of people, and we were treated so kindly. There was basically one guy taking care of everyone in the restaurant. \\n\\nThis time, we came with a group of 10. We called ahead, and upon arrival were told there'd be a 20 min wait. After an hr, we told them we were fine if they split us up if that meant we could eat. So they told us they had a table for 6. I went with half the group to the area. There were 2 tables in the area, and the hostess standing with 2 servers near the table that had seating for 6. I pointed at the 6-top & asked \\"is this our table?\\". She just gave me a look like I was crazy for asking. So I'm pulling the chair out when a group of 3 people come up and another hostess puts her hand on the opposite chair & tells them it's their table. Ok, so I look over & a gentleman shows up to tell me the booth is ours. The booth that normally SEATS FOUR. Did I mention one of the group was my 8-month pregnant sister? And we had our elderly parents with us? We picked Local Roots because we were so excited for our dad to try their calzone. My dad loves calzones, so we wanted to see how he'd like them here. \\n\\nSo, anyway, I went back to the waiting area, as there's no way we were fitting more than 4 people & a toddler in the booth. A couple mins later, the rest of our party was seated. Now here's the thing - as they took us to our table, we walked past 2 other tables right next to where my family was sitting. They put us at the far end of the restaurant. Did I mention I had planned to share food with my sisters seated at the other table? So now I'm walking across the restaurant with my plate to get the apps, then back for my piece of calzone. \\n\\nI'm a foodie, and was so excited to come here today. But after all that, even the food doesn't taste good anymore.  :(\\n\\nFirst, why did they tell us 20 mins if it obviously wasn't going to be? Then, why did they say they'd split us, but keep us near each other, but then put us at separate ends?\\n\\nI left the worst for last. The hostess. She was so rude to us. And when we were told a table opened up by someone else there, we asked her if that was our table, she *snapped* \\"NO!\\". Really? Your co-worker told us something, we were checking with you; you don't need to snap at us.\\n\\nBasically, everything would have been fine if that horrible hostess wasn't there.

Wasn't hard to get tea, menu, or server at all.  So it felt like they cared (or wanted to rush people through quickly to get another table seated!).  \\n\\nTried out two staple Shanghainese dishes.  The rice cakes ($9.95) and xiao long bao ($4.95).  \\n\\nService was very quick, and the items arrived almost too quickly.  In fact, perhaps the kitchen should have spent a little more time and care in folding the xiao long bao. They were sloppily folded, and thrown into the steamer in such a way that they got steamed together. This made it absolutely impossible to take them out without them sticking to each other and ripping.  Boo.  The skins were varied in thickness so in some parts they broke too easily and in other parts they were clumpy.  The meat and soup were packed with flavour and of good consistency. The broth was on the lighter side, but extremely flavourful. If they had just put a little more care into the folding and placement into the steamer these could have been really good.

However, if any business is every rude to me I will always give them a 1 star rating on principle, so here it is.\\n\\nBeerFeast 2012 was $33.  $30 for the ticket, with a $3 convenience fee.  The $30 got you in and allowed you 12 2-ounce samples.  Doing the math, that's 1.5 pints, meaning you're paying $20 a pint.  Pretty ridiculous, but they gave you the option of buying another 12 samples for $6, which comes out to a much more reasonable $4 a pint.  \\n\\nThe problem was that I never got a chance to get another ticket.  I never finished mine because they decided to end the BeerFeast an hour early.  Despite the ticket saying the event lasted until 7:30, the staff kicked everyone out at 6:40.  \\n\\nFS claimed that the tickets were misprinted and the event was supposed to end at 7pm.  Maybe that's true, but they handled it VERY poorly.  For people like me arriving late, they should have mentioned at the door or somewhere that the posted time had been changed.  If it ended at 7pm, why did they forcefully eject everyone at 6:40 when the exit is no more than 30 seconds from any point in the entire area?  \\n\\nThe thing that really bothered me was that one employee had a hand-cranked siren which was INCREDIBLY loud which he was putting next to people's face/ears trying to flush them out.  That siren was so loud it very well could have caused some temporary hearing loss or even some permanent ear damage.  A senior employee had to tell him to knock it off after he enraged multiple people.    \\n\\nIt would have been a lot of fun if it wasn't for how it ended.

The menu is thoughtful and seasonal. And even though the menu isn't huge, it's both accessible (e.g., burgers) and interesting (e.g., head cheese). I especially loved the burger, which arrived a perfectly-cooked medium rare. And the moussaka has been haunting my dreams. I've also tried several of the cocktails; the fennel martini was great.  \\n\\nThe wine list is excellent and the selection of beers on tap is small but perfect. Every time I've asked for a wine recommendation the bartender has made a thoughtful and well-chosen suggestion. \\n\\nFinally, I can't say enough about the wonderful service I've had at Cakes & Ale. Every time I've been in the hostess, bartender and servers have been attentive and knowledgeable. So many times bad service can ruin a great meal, but Cakes and Ale has the whole package.

It underwent renovations and reopened officially under the TWG Tea brand. Walking in, it was beautiful with hundreds of teas to choose from, a wider variety of tea sets, teapots, tea accessories and more.\\nBecause we didn't have a reservation, we asked if there was space for the two of us and a stroller, and luckily for us they had some space in the back.\\n\\nWe settled for two teapots (of course, at least 1 tea per person) the 1837 Tea Time Set, 4 macarons and some ice cream. I wanted to try the ice cream because it was infused with TWG Tea, and the macarons were also infused with TWG Tea as well. I know that the macarons were directly imported from TWG Tea (so probably Singapore?) so I assume the ice creams are directly imported as well.\\nThe scones here are so delicious! I had found the tea-infused jelly and cream very delicious before when I visited the Urban Tea Merchant, so I was delighted to find that the scones had stayed deliciously the same at TWG Tea.\\n\\nWhile my husband went for the Cream of Earl Grey as he always does, I had some difficulty choosing my tea as usual. When I finally made my choice, our server told us that they were unfortunately all out of the one I had wanted. I guess I chose a popular tea! So I asked for some recommendations as I wanted something similar, and I chose one of the few that she had recommended. She then came back a few moments later saying that that tea was also sold out. Sigh. So, for the third time I chose something, but this time she suggested that I try a blossoming flower tea; I took her advice and luckily(?) it was in stock. As for the tea that I had tried? Unfortunately, I forgot. But there aren't very many blossoming flower teas, and there is a whole list for them so it should be quite easy to find.\\nWhen my tea was brought out, I was mesmerized by the teapot first because it was so pretty, then the blossoming flower was very visually pleasing as well.\\n\\nWe chose 4 macarons - the flavours I don't remember at the top of my head anymore because the ones that I wanted were sold out. I believe I ended up getting the ones that were still in stock. The whole list of macarons are on the menu and as they're permanent, they should readily be available.\\nHubby and I had tasted macarons at TWG Tea before in Seoul last year so we weren't too surprised by anything. They tasted the same, which was good because they should as they're from TWG. They were well preserved; the shell wasn't too hard or crunchy (good texture), and the tea flavours were subtly tasteful throughout the macarons.\\n\\nIt was our first time trying ice cream at TWG and I was very pleased with it, except for the fact that it took a very long time for my ice cream to come out. It came out much later than our macarons and tea set did, and honestly, it came out so late that I was on the verge of cancelling my ice cream order to leave. But I patiently waited and I'm quite glad that I waited to try it because it was delicious. I believe I tried the Vanilla bourbon tea, after asking our server for recommendations. She said that it was one of her favourites and I could see why! The tea flavours were not too bold but still strongly there throughout the ice cream and it blended well with the vanilla. I would love to try other flavours such as the Camelot Tea, White Night Jasmine Tea, and Napoleon Tea. I highly recommend the ice creams.\\n\\nAll in all, it was great to finally visit TWG Tea in Vancouver! I always wished that I could visit TWG in Canada, and so when I was finally able to, it was a great feeling as a tea lover. I do wish that the service could've been better. Our orders didn't arrive promptly (ie. ice cream); it would've been nice if everything had arrived at the same time for better enjoyment. The teas were of course good and well brewed, as it should be. It would be nice to enjoy their special Tea Sets, such as their West Coast Tea Set and Sakura Tea Set. The tea sets come with a great selection of foods, not just desserts, so the tea salon isn't just for the tea lover.\\n\\nI didn't like how the teas that I had wanted to drink were out of stock, two of them too! What are the chances? Perhaps I had come at a bad time, but no one likes seeing things on the menu that aren't order-able, right? We also had to wait a long time to order in the beginning and also to pay for our bill at the end. As much as we love TWG, they could use some more servers!"},{"name":"Mezza Luna","address":"1669 Spring Rd SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4.5","text":"I had great dining experience with the fiancee here during a late lunch.

One staff member was working on the day of my visit and she was extremely kind. There was a slight language barrier that caused the ordering process to be lengthy given the one-drink order but the tea was presented exactly as ordered.

They'd be extremely convenient to access via MARTA, since they're almost literally right next to the Buckhead stop's entryway, but this is probably the kind of place where you might not want to be seen in your nice clothes, approaching from the oft-maligned MARTA, and instead go want to rent a Silver Car Audi (Zipcar, pfff), so you can pull up to valet parking looking like you dine at this place with regularity.  That's how classy this place is.\\n\\nBut really, Niko Bistro is actually a very nice establishment.  It's clean, and does its best to have that Parisian bistro feel, without going overboard with theme; it's like they mimicked as much as they could, but stopped before they started throwing berets and baguettes on the walls.  But the tiling of the floors, to the cramped seating felt kinda Parisian, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant is sophisticated yet relaxing.  They even have a functioning cigarette machine that dispenses cancer sticks at $7 a pack.\\n\\nService was outstanding throughout the evening, and our server never hovered yet was always well timed with water refills, when to take the next orders, and the occasional check in; little things that make diners feel well taken care of but not overwhelmed.\\n\\nWhenever I go to a nicer restaurant, I'm often skeptical about the food being a letdown, generally believing many restaurants tend to spend so much on appearance and superficial things, that they forgot to actually produce quality food.  Niko Bistro does not fall into such a camp.  I ordered a seafood pasta dish off of the menu that was expansive but not overflowing, and I found it to be fantastic.  Not a bowl full of noodles with an errant shrimp, scallop or calamari piece, but generous in the proteins while even managing to keep the winter peas from not losing their flavor.\\n\\nHonestly, in spite of all the passive-aggressive things that try to make the place sound like it's trying to be an expensive eatery, Niko Bistro really isn't.  The food isn't exactly like ordering food at TGI Friday's, but with nothing that I recall exceeding $40, it's really not that bad of a deal for a nicer dining experience.  The closest I can remember was like $35, and that was for three-course options.\\n\\nFrankly, at this point, the only thing that comes close to a knock is that the parking isn't free, which is a common thing in this part of Buckhead.  But even that was rectified by faulty payment gates eating tickets, resulting in the valet guys having to let us out without having paid.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that this isn't the kind of place I'd think about going to in the first place, much less be so willing to give it five stars.  But with a fairly good location, clean and comfortable ambiance, great service and excellent food, it's definitely one of those reviews where I had to think about how absolutely nothing went wrong with my experience and a five stars is justifiably earned."},{"name":"Cha Shu Coffee and Bubble Tea","address":"62 Summer St","city":"Malden","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for bubble tea during regular hours and they took my order said, \\"ok\\", started to ring me up and then said \\"sorry we are out of bubble\\".

She promised she would. She came back within a few minutes-- with the SAME tempura! How did I know? The mark from the single bite I took before sending it back was still there! It had just been re-fried, and obviously in oil that had been used many times because it reeked. The smell was stomach-churning, not to mention the taste of the tempura, which had been thrown in the fryer cold and subsequently absorbed a huge amount of oil. At that point, I was so turned off my food, I asked for the check.\\nI want to mention that I have been to Oga several times and never have I had such a horrible meal. What a huge disappointment.

I asked why, and was told that some came back more than once and the promotion lasted longer than they thought.   Well some thoughts on that:\\n\\n1.   I see the place was just sold to new owners. Attn new boss, you should investigate any outstanding promotions at what your buying. You are not changing the name, the public doesnt know, you had better be ready to honor what you bought.\\n\\n2. If it wasnt an outstanding promotion and you yourself did sign up for it you should have done your homework first!  Go talk to establishmenst on the program first!  Dont just do it and then refuse it!\\nIt creates ill feelings, and reviews like this!  Did you actually think you could pull something like that and NOT have people post their feelings?\\n\\n3.  Put the notice square in the center of the front of the menu. People should not have to review your door for notes of the day to see what you have now decided not to honor. That way we can at least bail out before we order. \\n\\n4. If people do come back more than one time using the same promotion, nicely inform those you recognize doing this that you can not allow it another time before they order. The Scoutmob printed sheet or phone msg  doesnt say only one time per person. Maybe its in their webpage rules(dont know)  but it's  not on the printed sheet. Regardless, you should not take out on a first time visitor what others have done before. Your customers are individual people and should be treated as such.\\n\\n   Times are tough out there and stunts like this sure don't help your online ratings!"},{"name":"Ebisu On Robson","address":"827 Bute Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I've only been there once but I really liked the restaurant.

I don't get it. \\n\\nThe bad: The food was really bland. The special BLAST BLT with sprouts was really boring and dry. They only put 3 slices of avocado on the whole thing and didn't provide mayo unless you asked. The provided mayo was in frustrating small packets. The sandwich itself was just forgettable: not enough avocado, bland tomato and super dry.  The curried lentil soup was bland and watery. It was under salted and tasted like they threw curry powder in at the end to mask the lack of flavor. The ambiance here is lacking and the interior feels tired and not super clean. I know it is downtown, but still.  The bathroom is through this creepy stairwell in the basement. The layout of the eating area is very long and narrow which makes it difficult to maneuver around and the ordering stream with separate food then coffee and pay is not intuitive. \\n\\nThe good: the maple latte was actually tasty. \\n\\nI would not return. I left hungry because the food was so in satisfying I could not finish it. The food reminded me of stuff I would have been served in the late 90s at a natural food store in the worst possible sense.

The woman that normally does my eyebrows is out of town so I decided to try a new place out because I was in dire need and couldn't afford to wait another 3 weeks for her to return. I had already had a bad experience at another location 3 days before (wait for that review) but since I ended up not getting them done that day I yelped nearby locations from my house and found this place. I got my eyebrows threaded and the lady that did them did a fantastic job. She asked me first how I wanted them to be, took her time, and ensured that I liked the final result once she was done. I went up to pay and should've just done that but instead I decided to get a pedicure as well since I needed one anyways, 2 birds 1 stone... Let me tell you that if this review were solely based on the pedicure, I would give this place -5 stars. Yes, NEGATIVE 5! It was the slowest, most uncomfortable pedicure I've ever had. You would think that a longer pedicure would be good; you'd get really amazing looking toes and a great massage, but no. The whole time the lady did the pedicure I was looking down at my phone watching every minute go by. She was clueless!! She didn't cut or file my nails squared like I asked, removed my cuticles as if she was gold mining, just rubbed some lotion on my legs instead of actually massaging them, and painted my nails like a 5 year old. How a person is going to charge $35 plus tip even after I pointed out how bad the paint job looked is mind blowing (refer to picture). I paid and left because after an 1+ hour pedicure I didn't have any more time for an argument. I should've redeemed the free glass of wine offer I got once I checked in because I definitely needed it after all this frustration...

I went for the opening last night and it was just incredible.  Huge outdoor area, mini dog park, live music stage, 103 beers, homemade and incredible sausages, boiled peanuts, fried pickles, etc etc.  \\n\\nWe had an incredibly friendly server named Christine last night who was just as slammed as every single staff member in the house but managed to keep it together with a smile.  I ordered the Real Ale Devil's Backbone Tripel and some Boiled Peanuts.  The beer was amazing, the boiled peanuts were not.  Let me state that i'm originally from Florida so i've had tons and tons of boiled peanuts and am a huge fan of being able to get them anywhere in Austin as quite a few folks have no idea what they are or flat out just don't like the texture of them.  My gripe about Banger's boiled peanuts is that #1 - They do not have a 'cajun' or 'spicy' option for them, (which only requires throwing some cayenne pepper in the pot whilst boiling), and #2 - They are charging $3.50 for about 30 peanuts.  RIP!  Peanuts cost, whaaaaaaaale... PEANUTS!  So c'mon guys, for $3.50 they should serve a nice big brown paper bag of them like we get in the Southeast and add a cajun option to boot.  \\n\\nThe sausage selection is overwhelming with amazement.  I ended up getting the Wild Boar sausage on a pretzel bun with caramelized onions and the delicious Olaf sauce.  5 stars for this sucker, hands down incredible.  Which leads me on to my only gripe number 2, the American fries.  I wanted them with my sammy obviously but they charged me $5 for a side of fries.  These fries are not amazing, and the nerve they have charging 5 bux for a small side of these things is absurd.  I wont be ordering those again.  However, the sausage, beers, service and atmosphere made up for both of those gripes but i sure hope they change the boiled peanut options and price.\\n\\nOverall, i cannot wait to go back.

It is very clean, very large, and has an extensive gift-shop area. The lodge-theme here is done well, and it almost feels like you stepped out of Frontier Town at Disney World and into a brewery. All of that aside, this is still Portland, and I still like beer, so this place already wins some stars. We have eaten once in the bar and twice in the dining room. Be ready to wait for the dining room, and find the bar packed - but as I have already stated, it's a huge place, there are a ton of tables, and the turnover is pretty quick. Our longest wait time, on a Thursday night, was about 10 minutes (after being quoted 25). Our other visits have been at lunch time on Sunday. Granted we are a party of two, and they have seated us at both large and small tables. As for the beer - it is good. I prefer the familiar taps to their seasonal beers, but they are fun to try. I have even tried the gluten free beer, although thinking back on it I have no idea why! They have samplers, 300ML and pint sizes, and a $5 beer at a theme restaurant seems like quite a deal. The best part about Deschutes for me is the FOOD. It is delicious, even for a vegetarian who does not count \\"french fries\\" as a vegetable. We have tried the Falafel wrap, the house-made Veggie-Burger, the Spicy-Sweet Mac & Cheese, and the Tortallini Salad - all were amazing. The real stunner however is the pretzel. I know what you're thinking - salted or unsalted, either way it's coming from the freezer and is the same quality that you'd find at the multi-plex. Oh no, not at Deschutes. They make their own pretzel ring, cover it with delicious high-quality salt, and accompany that with a dish of melted white cheese with their Black Butte Porter stone-ground mustard. The mustard is IN the dish with the cheese. Not mixed in, but in a ring around the edge of the cheese. This. Is. Amazing.  I now crave this at all times and no other pub pretzel will satisfy me.

I had the shrimp fettuccine and it was fine.. my friends had a field green salad (she loves it) and the pork tenderloin (she loved that, too), and we topped it off with some actual AMAZING dessert - a chocolate cheesecake with berry drizzle, and the chocolate torte -- both very impressive.  \\nI would go back.

I'll be focusing on the beer, and possibly sitting in the bar area that looks to be a lot of fun during a game on TV of some sort - and focusing little on the food, which is probably the less exciting call to this place."},{"name":"Quincy Market","address":"4 S Market St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is a great indoor food market!

My brothers and I flew in from around the country and surprised our parents with a dinner at what I was led to believe was a nationally acclaimed restaurant.  An experienced diner, I make allowances for mishaps, mistakes and less than perfect events but by the end of this night I was absolutely fuming.  I cannot warn people enough to stay away from a place so clearly resting on past laurels.\\n\\nEarly in the afternoon I dropped off an expensive, custom made \\"wedding style\\" cake we had had made (see a separate review of Cakes by Darcy / Roswell, GA.  Fabulous.) --- pursuant to the directions given to me by a hostess the day before.  I told the person who received it that it needed to be refrigerated and that I would like it placed on the table immediately prior to being seated.  She appeared confused at first and then subsequently 'bothered' or 'annoyed.'  \\n\\nArrival was fine; the grounds are lovely and well kept, and cocktails along the Chattahoochee were pleasant.  It was after being seated that things went south.\\n\\nOur original party of seven had dropped to five before arrival.  I called the restaurant and informed them of the change.  I again told the hostess of the change upon arrival, before spending time at the bar for pre-dinner cocktails.  When we were brought back into the restaurant, we seated at a table for seven.  As the waiter was filling water glasses I told him our party had changed to five and he expressed surprise.   Two settings and two chairs were subsequently removed after we were seated and the party shifted.\\n\\nThe cake had been placed on the table, but had been left unrefrigerated; the fondant was glistening in sweat as it appeared to melt to the side.\\n\\nWe ordered appetizers, soups and entrees.  Appetizers and one order of soup were served simultaneously (to the same person), while another was served separately as a separate course (after the first individual's double course was finished and removed.)  The first soup was served cold and was sent back.\\n\\nEntrees were standard fare and served cold.  I mean, really cold.  The plates were hot and the food cool, as if they sat under an insufficient heat lamp for some time.  A steak ordered \\"medium\\" came to the table \\"rare\\" and even after pointing it out to the server and re-fired, it was still underdone.\\n\\nFour of the five entrees needed to be sent back for different reasons.\\n\\nService in general was slow and inattentive; food, with the exception of the signature rabbit dish, was underwhelming.\\n\\nAfter being seated the cake was taken away and later sliced for desert.  The vast majority of it was left over and was re-boxed to take home.  And this is where a less than mediocre night became infuriating.\\n\\nDespite no managerial comment or table visit during the repeated mishaps and although my family requested nothing, at the end of the evening our server told us the entire meal was comped.  The entire night was a remarkably slipshod, amateurish experience but our family is a positive one and we enjoyed our time together despite the overwhelmingly disappointing food and service.  We accepted the restaurant's response; we weren't looking for a 'freebie' and between the three sons we tipped our waiter a total of one hundred sixty dollars ($160), and left.\\n\\nThe specially made cake was a beautiful creation from Cakes by Darcy in Roswell, Georgia.  An edible copy of my parent's wedding photo from fifty years ago was mounted in a fondant frame above it.  Five slices were taken from it.  When we received the boxed leftover from our server, I noted that the box was excessively taped shut, on all sides, top and bottom, which I thought odd.  It wasn't until we got back to my parents' home that I found out why.\\n\\nOpening the box at home I found the fondant frame broken in pieces with the photograph itself literally shredded and the remaining cake placed on top of it.  This was not merely a mistake or slip up; the photo was actually torn in pieces, the frame broken up and the cake placed on top by either our server or someone in the kitchen.  (See the attached photos.)  I was infuriated.\\n\\nI called Canoe immediately and asked to speak to a manager.  The hostess requested my name, which I provided, and then placed me on hold.  After a moment she came back and told me a manager was not available.  After explaining the circumstance, the hostess apparently tried again and a manager again refused to take my call.  I was, and still am, furious.  \\n\\nIn short, the place is mediocre at best; service terrible and vindictive at worst.    A once in a lifetime event was enjoyable solely because of the blessings and good nature of my family.  Canoe did nothing but work to thwart that --- even after the fiasco was over. \\n\\nAbsolutely terrible."},{"name":"Grano Neapolitan Pizza","address":"8 Cypress St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"They have new owners as of just a few days ago and wow, the difference from the previous owners who really had made great pizza is palpable - the new version is terrible pizza, hardly any sauce, I asked for a large and they delivered what looked like a small.

Two men were just sitting around watching TV and texting near the tables, and the two waitresses who were on duty did a horrible job. \\n\\nThe best thing I can say about the Taiwanese tapa menu is that it has variety. There were several items that I had never seen before... Which isn't such a good thing when there aren't any descriptions. I didn't feel like risking it, so I asked for a regular menu. I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup and pork Moo Shi. I was really sad when the soup arrived. It just looked like an Egg Drop soup, with a lot of egg and pepper and nothing much else. It lacked the complicated flavors I often taste in other restaurants' Hot and Sour soups. I did, however, really enjoy the Moo Shi. While I highly doubt their Chinese pancakes/crepes were actually made on site, it was very chewy and not too doughy. The pork was seasoned nicely and it was a nice big serving. \\n\\nMy family friend ordered some type of noodle soup whose name that I can't remember, but my mom and friend both enjoyed it. As for the rest of the meal's service, it was bad. We were one of TWO parties dining there, and there were two waitresses. I mean, how busy can you be?

My group ordered the \\"nutrition\\" broth, which is a light, mild broth, and a \\"spicy broth\\" which in my opinion was very flavorful, but not overwhelmingly spicy.  Items are broken down into meats, vegetables, \\"main items\\", and items that you have to pay more for.  You check off what you want, give it to your server, and then wait for the raw food to come out.  Items are pushed out on a cart.  The broth comes out pre-warmed, so you don't have to wait too long to start cooking.\\n\\nFood items range in quality.  My group mostly ordered the sliced beef, which was good.  I also enjoyed the beef tripe.  Lamb meatballs had an okay texture.  There are also cuttlefish balls, sliced chicken, sliced lamb, and slices of fish filet.  I liked the selection of vegetable items - everything from taro to bok choy and napa to sweet potato.  Main items were so-so.  I liked the handmade noodles, but thought the meat bun was a little tough.  Wontons tasted better than the lamb dumplings.  The chive pancake is worthwhile to try if you like chives.\\n\\nService was friendly, but disorganized.  Items were sometimes forgotten from our checklist - their system is to give you a different color pen for each time you order on the same sheet of paper.    Water - both our drinks and water for the hotpot - was refilled frequently, though. The restaurant was very warm -  which isn't surprising because there are a good thirty hotpots running at the same time - but almost too warm.

We arrived at around 10am on Sunday morning with a reservation for 8 and found the place quickly filling up. Our table was right next to the buffet line overlooking a serene bayou with trees and grass, the perfect little overlook on which to peacefully gaze after stuffing ourselves silly. \\n\\nThe main Sunday brunch event here is a large buffet line ($16/person), with almost every dish being able to stand alone as its own breakfast dish - that's how good they are. No wimpy filler dishes here. Biscuits and gravy and mini pancakes are made to order - just let your server know.\\n\\nMy favorites were:\\n- the tomato basil egg pie (the tomatoes in this perfectly seasoned pie shined through instead of becoming a gloopy mess like they usually do and the crust was a crumbly foil to the soft egg; I could have easily eaten a whole pie of this!)\\n- the grilled veggies, especially the brussel sprouts (this is a shocker - who goes to a buffet for vegetables? certainly not me, but in this case I'll make an exception)\\n- the mama's chicken (this was a pot-cooked chicken that was so juicy and flavorful that I actually preferred it over their fried chicken)\\n- biscuits with jalapeno gravy (oh my goodness. normally I wouldn't eat more than half of a biscuit at a buffet because they're so filling, but I just couldn't resist...the biscuit was a perfect southern biscuit with crispy outsides and a thick, pillowy inside and the gravy was so tasty!)\\n- from all the sweet options, the pecan apple strudel was head and shoulders above the rest - the crust was flaky, airy, and sweet; the filling was reminiscent of a slightly sweet pecan pie filling, and it was topped with crunchy apple strudel bits. Also, try their strawberry butter - amaaazing.\\n\\nBesides the food, I would come back for the service alone. This restaurant had the kindest, most helpful and friendly servers I have ever met. Our waitresses' name was Stephanie: she took time to answer all our questions, she cleared plates and brought out new orders quickly, and she even took us to the bayou in the back to get us a group picture because the lighting inside was a bit dim (this was her suggestion, so kind!). Lastly, we were there celebrating a special event and wanted to pay for our guest of honor's meal; without even asking, she split up one order into 6 then added it onto each of our separate checks. I've never seen \\"1/6 of an orange juice\\" on my receipt before but it's possible at Jack Allen's. \\n\\nIn conclusion, do your tummy and well-being a favor and please eat here for Sunday brunch.

You'll thank me, trust me!  The people who rated this restaurant with 4-5 stars are either FAKE reviews or they just have no idea what is considered to be a good Korean BBQ restaurant because they never been to one before.\\n\\nFirst of all, the food is OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED.  $40 per person for all you can eat Korean BBQ.  GIVE ME A BREAK!!!  There are plenty other Korean BBQ places in Mass with better food quality and service that charge less than this greedy business owner's restaurant.  Try looking for a restaurant in Medford or Brighton, you'll thank me!  Even their separate order Korean BBQ meat choices are OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED TOO.  Service is super slow and sub par as other people said.  \\n\\nI think the only positive from our experience about this place that I can think of quite honestly is the sushi chef.  He was nice and courteous and was the only employee who actually cared to get our orders in and flag a server to get our bill since apparently we were invisible to their waiters.  \\n\\nWhat made me most angry about this place was the fact that the host who seated us was extremely rude and not empathetic whatsoever.  When getting the bill, he apparently gave me a weird look as if I was a lunatic and as didn't know what a \\"restaurant.com\\" certificate was.  Rather than being empathetic and truly apologizing they they no longer accept these and potentially offer an alternative discount of some sort (didn't have to be much at all really), instead he was more argumentative with me and made lame excuses saying \\"it's been over a month since he's last seen this and thought they took it down\\".  He instead blamed restaurant.com and told me to \\"take it with them\\" rather than making the situation right for me in offering some alternative discount.\\n\\nWhat makes absolutely no sense to me is, why did these people even bother advertising on restaurant.com when after 1 month since I bought the gift certificate, it all the sudden it becomes \\"no longer valid\\". \\n\\nNow IF this restaurant owner actually had some brains, they could've easily posted a very simple 8.5 by 11 piece of paper with a sign in their front waiting area entrance saying that they no longer accept this as of a certain date.

I guess at 6:45pm on a relatively warm night in Boston, surrounded by a bunch of college campuses, that should be my first alarm.\\n\\nWhen we took a seat, the only waiter/server, who was an older man, took a few minutes to give us water or ask us if we wanted to drink.

The two parties that came AFTER us had already gotten their plates by then. When we finally got our food, it came warm, rather than hot. The yellow rice and beans I ordered had some burnt rice to it (hard and crunchy), the oxtail was okay, and the plantains that came with it were barely warm. After we were done, we had to wait some time before the server came and took our plates away.\\n\\nWe waited for our check. Told him about it, to which he responded that he was on it. And we waited. The two parties that came after us had already left. After he gave the check to us, we paid with card, and waited some more. The only time we got speedy service was when we had to sign our checks, when the older man STOOD and WATCHED and WAITED till we were done. Before we even got ready to leave, he turned around with the signed checks and looked at what we had tipped him.\\n\\nAll in all, next time, I'd rather spend two hours of my time eating someplace else with better (and actually, hot) Jamaican food.

No one came back to see if we wanted our drinks refreshed or to take our order.  I know some people exaggerate, but I am not when I say an HOUR passed by with no one checking on us.  The food sounded delicious, but at that point we were over it.  My friend had to get up and ask the server for our check which came another TWENTY minutes later.  From the time we got there, got a drink, got our check and cashed out an hour and forty five minutes had passed.  In that time a server came around to us once to take our initial drink order.

It hasn't been open long, and you can tell - it's still packed and you'll find about a 45 minute wait for a table soon after they open.\\n-\\nWe sat at the bar - which I recommend because you can order food there as well, and you have a captive bartender to wait on you!  It's actually better than a waiter - no waiting!\\n-\\nWe ordered a couple drinks - glass of wine and a sidecar.  I love sidecars.  You probably don't know what they are because you drink pink things that end in \\"-tini\\" that have nothing to do with martinis.  Neither did the bartender, because I had to tell him what was in it.  It was - ok.  I got wine after that.\\n-\\nThe food - I got to try the food finally!  We got calamari to start and it was GREAT.  Far better than I expected.  At first glance I thought there wasn't enough - but I would say it is a fine size for an appetizer for 2 people.  You know what I mean?  Not too big - leaves you wanting more - the very definition of an appetizer.  It was cooked great - not too greasy or anything and it came with a side of that awesome spicy red sauce that you sometimes see.  It's great - really one of the best fried calamari's I've had.\\n-\\nDinner - Steak Tips and Fish & Chips.  The fish and chips were GREAT:  That fish was awesome - so fresh and clean tasting - not oily or greasy at all - wonderful.  Nice big slab of fish too.  And the fries that are served with it have a little kick to them - almost like they splash truffle oil on there or something - really nice.  No ketchup needed.\\nSteak tips were pretty good - they have that nice sweet marinated thing going on - a little fatty and about as good as what you'd make at home if you bothered with marinades.\\n-\\nThe kicker - and the reason for the -1 star, was that the two sides that came with my dish were stone cold.  I had broccoli and onion rings.  It was depressing how utterly cold those onion rings were.  The steak was fine, thank god.  The broccoli was hard - like hardly cooked.  I didn't get that.  I did speak up and the bartender apologized profusely and had the kitchen send out another (hot) order of both.  The new hot onion rings were good - they are those really thin kind - but nice.  I wouldn't get them again.  The new dish of broccoli looked freshly-microwaved, and it was still undercooked.  It's a giant head of broccoli - really I think they should cut that up smaller - it's hard to attach this huge thing of broccoli.\\n-\\nAnyhow - the bartender offered us a free desert because of the screw-up, which was nice but we did not take him up on it.\\n-\\nI would say they are still ironing out the kinks here, but overall the food was really very good.   I recommend that calamari and fish & chips.

I confirmed the order and he gladly obliged.  Management also offered to move us to a larger table due to the large order, so +1 for that.  The bowls of pho came out in less than 5 minutes and the bo 7 mon shortly after.  The food was a delight especially on a grey dreary day with drizzle and accompanied by hot tea, the experience was amazing (and delicious!).

Hailing originally from southern California, it hasn't been difficult to find a legitimate Japanese sushi bar in Cali.  However, when I first moved to Massachusetts, I was greeted by a lot of \\"Japanese\\" places that also served Chinese and/or Korean food.  All of these places were owned by Chinese and Korean owners.  Not to say the food wasn't good--the food was good ... for being a fusion place.  I really missed authentic fresh sushi/sashimi; I actually ordered uni nigiri when I was living in western Mass, which was a BIG mistake ... fishy and slightly off.\\n\\nI was so happy to read reviews about Junji and I had to give the place a try.  Following recommendations from fellow Yelpers, I opted for the omakase.  The omakase was a little more expensive than I anticipated ($70-$90), but well worth it!  To note, Junji only does omakase when the restaurant isn't too busy.\\n\\nMy first course was monkfish liver.  It doesn't sound really appetizing, but oh my .... ever since that taste of monkfish liver, I've been dreaming about it.  It's so good--fresh, creamy, sweet, and tasting of the ocean.  I forgot to take a picture of this dish, but this will be added to my list of go-to dishes along with uni.  Simply delicious and delightful!\\n\\nMy second course was marinated and seared baby octopus.  This was also very good.  The appearance of this dish did frighten my more tame boyfriend and friend, who both decided not to taste this.  It's reminiscent of the jellyfish from Chinese cold platters and also kind of like the japanese seaweed salad--fresh, springy, slightly crunchy, and sweet.\\n\\nMy third course was seabass sashimi.  This was also really good--fresh and sweet, with just the right amount of (ponzu, I think?) and a fresh shiso leaf.\\n\\nThe fourth course was an assorted sashimi platter that included: tuna, fatty tuna, salmon, uni, calamari, and two kinds of white fish that I forgot.  The sashimi was very fresh and delicious.  I'm usually not a fan of salmon sashimi because it's a little too fishy for me, but the salmon here was very good.\\n\\nThe last course was an assorted sushi platter that I also forgot to take a picture of.  There was black cod nigiri, a tuna roll with radish, tamago nigiri, and tuna nigiri.  By this time, I was already getting full, but I still managed to finish everything!  The black cod nigiri was something I'd never had before and it was really tasty.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend trying the omakase--you'll be guaranteed with something prepared special by the chef that is tasty and highlights everything good about the establishment.  Definitely give the monkfish liver a try.  My only regret is that I didn't compliment the chef before I left--I think next time I'll sit at the bar."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place is okay.

I noticed how CLEAN the kitchen was and the gorgeous butcher block in the center. \\n\\nMy business colleague showed up and we were shown to our table ( it was crowded).  Since I waited tables in college, I am a tough customer - I don't think guests should have to wait long to be greeted.  And I didn't!  A gentleman immediately got us water and our server Jenny greeted us.\\n\\nOne thing I should mention is I am Gluten Free. Jenny took the time to not only walk me through the menu but to triple check everything.  Example - Gazpacho is usually safe, but upon double checking with the chef she let me know they use a touch of flour to thicken it.  Many severs wouldn't have done that and she saved me a very painful discovery.\\n\\nI ended up having the special - a brisket sandwich ( sans the bread of course).  It was TO DIE FOR.  Perfectly seasoned, melty gruyere cheese and the SAUCE.. I think it was called maria rosa - DIVINE.\\n\\nI cannot remember what the dessert was called - but I devoured it.  It was meringue, with toasted almonds and a vanilla bean sauce.  Light, sweet and the PERFECT way to end the meal.\\n\\nI am a firm believer service can make or break an experience.

However, it moved really quickly and we got seated as soon as we reached the hostess, so no actual wait. \\n\\nIt was a gorgeous October day so we were thrilled to sit on the backyard patio. My friend brought his dog who enjoyed running around with the other pups in the enclosed doggy area. Great that they can play while we play! \\n\\nYou sit at long picnic tables which is fun because you end up having funny conversations with your neighbors. The front of the patio has a stage with an AWESOME band playing! They play instrumental versions of pop songs. Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls with a trumpet solo, a jazzy rendition of Party in the USA...so much fun to sing and dance along. \\n\\nIf you are making this a boozy brunch (which is what Bangers is known for but certainly isn't a requirement for a good time), obviously order the Manmosa. 1 liter for 10 bucks is a great deal even if you can't finish, and it sure is fun taking photos with the ridiculous, Oktoberfest inspired stein glasses. Good way to pregame for an afternoon of Rainey Street bar hopping.\\n\\nAwesome service. Server was the nicest guy with fun stories to tell. He apologized because it was busy and the food might take awhile, which I always really appreciate. Because of this, we were pleasantly surprised when our food came super quickly :)\\n\\nOk now for the delicious food!!\\n- BACON STEAK: I can't remember how it's made but the waiter described some crazy process. You can get it with biscuits and gravy but I recommend ordering a side so that everyone at the table can get a taste of it's decadent perfection. Served with a sriracha maple syrup.\\n- Bangers Benedict: A nice slab or pork belly instead of the typical toppings. Eggs poached perfectly. Vegetarian friend got basically a whole avocado instead (yay generous restaurants). Only complaint would be not enough hollandaise, so I ended up needing some ketchup.\\n- Steak and eggs. Juicy, large portion of steak!!\\n- Grapefruit br√ªl√©e basically just a grapefruit with sugar on top. Only thing I probably wouldn't recommend.\\n\\n\\nThe best part about Bangers is the feeling that everyone on that back porch is there sharing the common goal of having a wonderful time.

Perfect for sharing with a date.\\n\\nThe Hail Mary Wings - They're just the right amount of heat where your lips start to burn until you dip the next bite in some bleu cheese. If you like it hot, these are definitely for you. You only get six though. \\n\\nThe Bisque - So far I've tried the Crawfish & the Pumpkin Lobster. Both Phenomenal. The Pumpkin Lobster comes with some little crab crostinis that really set it off. The other night they had on special a Thai Red Curry soup and whaddya know......THAT was pretty tasty as well. \\n\\nThe Cheeseburger - I had the cheeseburger once here (a new addition to their menu) and I remember thinking how it tasted better than most bar/pub burgers in this town. Served with crispy, lightly breaded onion rings, I'm definitely going to order this again in the near future.\\n\\nA bar with a chef who has an imagination can be a beautiful thing.\\n\\nAs far as the beers on tap go, one could make an argument for or against the selection. I like the fact they have Hennepin, Trumer Pils, & Young's Double Chocolate Stout. If you have a suggestion I think telling the bartender would be a good idea as they seem to be tweaking things here and there. Russell has always been helpful when trying to select a beer, always offering a sample if you're having trouble deciding what beer to enjoy. \\n\\nI want this place to stay open and things are looking like I might get my wish. Every time I go it always seems to be busier than it was the time before. I heard that they were hiring more people, so that should alleviate some of the long wait times that other yelpers here were concerned about. The prices are on par with most others pubs who sport this kind of selection on tap (Drafthouse, Dog & Duck, etc).

I fell out of love with the Rustic Kitchen when it opened in Stuart Street and I discovered Carmen of the North End.  Also, this is an Opentable.com restaurant.\\n\\nFOOD\\nHas been inconsistent.  I am fairly stubborn when I find a meal to die for.  The first time I ate the shrimp spaghettini dish, I was hooked.  The shrimp were plump and flavored well, but the real kicker was the homeade spaghettini.  It was garlicky and buttery and tender and tasted homeade.  So, being such a fan of this one dish, I continued to get it...  Sadly, some days the shrimp was fishy and overcooked.  In fact 3 out of 5 times I ordered the dish, it was overcooked.  This is not what I consider a good record for the restaurant.  \\n\\nI have also tried dishes ordered by friends: the pumpkin ravioli was way too sweet and could have passed for dessert and the veal was unexciting.  On the other hand, the agnolotti dal plin is an excellent dish to try and the baked rigatoni will last you a week.  The fried calamari is an excellent dish as well.  And the pizzas...  \\n\\nMENU ISSUES\\nAnother thing I noticed is that their online menu is never the same as what they have at the restaurant.  Maybe the menu changes at the venue but isn't updated online, who knows.

Now, you can order a breakfast sandwich at anytime, but you cant order the other sandwiches before 11:30.  Why not? That would be the only change I would suggest.  Full menu from open to close. \\nNow, the meaty sandwiches were tested on another day.  The broad street bomber with hot peppers was extraordinary. Who would not love this. It oozed goodness.  The sausage and peppers is another east coast standby that they have perfected.   All I can say is that if you want a satisfying sandwich you gotta come here. Please open a store on the West Side, right next to the west side Lardo.  Then I can ask my cardiologist to open up an office around the corner as well.  Also, I made the mistake that after finishing a whole sandwich I could try to finish the remnants of another sandwich at the table.  Big mistake.  One sandwich is filling, and literally one bite more will put you over the edge into over-indulgent purgatory.  You will wallow in recovery for a little while after.   Please take my advice and do not attempt to finish more than one sandwich, not even one bite more.

The \\"skillet potatoes\\" aren't really what I would call skillet potatoes, more like a baked potato that was smashed and put in a skillet for a couple of minutes.  Tasty though.  My wife is an excellent cook and therefore a little picky as well, (\\"If I can make it better, why would I want to go pay for it somewhere else?\\")  She had the poached eggs with hollandaise over crab cakes, and said it was pretty tasty.

It deserves all the glory and praise it gets. Parking wasn't too bad. Valet space was full of Bentleys, Benzes and what have you. It was a Wednesday night. We had no reservations. The place was packed to capacity and we were told  the wait was about 45 min for a table. We were determined to see what the hype was about so we stayed. Sipped some wine at the bar while waiting and watching the giant tv screens. Finally got seated after almost an hour. Got some spinach dip to share and it was marvelous. Put my favorite from Applwbees to complete shame. The 3 of us cleaned that bowl of dip faster than a Batman disappearance. Then I ordered the ribs with fries and slaw. It was a whole slab of rib.  See picture. I shamelessly devoured every single bit of meat on that rack with the utmost quickness. In my defense, I had a super light early lunch and by the time my dinner came it was close to 9:45pm. Plus the fact that the ribs were just some of the best meat+ seasoning I've ever had. They don't even offer you additional bbq sauce on the side. That's how confident they are in the perfection of their ribs...

Not off to a good start as they seemed well staffed.  Our server was a very nice young Asian woman who was very helpful and accommodating.  We ordered drinks and four plates to start.  Fifteen minutes into things, we were all complaining about the godawful chairs.  You have to weigh less than 100 lbs., have no butt or be comfortable perching.  We did not qualify for any of those choices.  On to the food.  I LOVE Asian baby bok choy.  This lovely veggie was both cooked whole (no knife) and was overly done and leathery to bite.  Epic fail.  The wings were delish and the soup was very ample in portion, but bland. Next came the fried cod, BBQ pork tenderloin, a noodle dish, dumplings and the mashed potatoes with curry gravy.  Those were tasty with the mashed potatoes being my personal favorite.  The real deal.  The 3 stars are due more to the uncomfortable seating and very loud noise, rather than the food.

I could go on and on and on!\\n\\nIt is actually funny to remember how I found out about this place.  The first weekend I set out on foot with my friend after we both transfered from different schools to the Ohio State University, we walked all the way from Lane Avenue to Spruce Street, not realizing that we could have taken the COTA bus for free.  I was excited when I saw this odd farm/factory looking brick building tucked away behind some restaurants with a rooster on its sign because I knew it had to be an awesome place.  My stomach never lies.  I think I went there almost every weekend after that until I graduated!  No wonder I never saved much money.\\n\\nAnyhow, the food...you just need to try everything, although the one place I am not a particular fan of is Mozart's.  I am not sure what they put in their desserts, but something always tastes wrong/funny to me and it makes me feel a little sick when I eat them.  Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream is a MUST.  I love the coffee at the A Touch of Earth and they have organic coffee, so there's a plus.  My favourite place to eat is the Pastaria; I always end up eating there, even though I try to eat somewhere else, and I always get the Sundried Tomato Artichoke & Gorgonzola Sauce with Wheat Pasta.  Their sauce is heaven and their garlic butter actually has real garlic in it; I treat it as a double negative, garlic good, butter bad, cancels out and so it is okay to slab the whole pat they give out on my bread for my heart.   Mmmm....salivating....\\n\\nUnfortunately, I do have complaints.  I always end up smelling funky bad when I leave from what I can only assume is due to the Flavors of India.  Originally, I thought the Chinese stand made me smell, but it is longer there; so it must be the Indian place, right?  Also, on the weekends and during the special events, the North Market gets so packed, I worry constantly about losing my kids or that they will be trampled by the crowd.

I like to get the Okanogan Black Ale, and my wife likes the Northern Light.  The fact that you can get growlers improves matters considerably.\\n\\nFood: What I've had falls into a narrow range, but it was always great.  The spinach and garden salads are excellent (actually worth getting as a meal), and the pizza is good.  The ridiculously decadent Cedar Plank Salmon is one for special occasions, with an intense wine sauce and rich blue cheese scalloped potatoes.

I really wanted to have a great meal at Passport but there were so many missteps.  \\n\\nThe location is nice - the decor is pretty though the back dining room is a bit too bright - perhaps due to the beautiful hanging lanterns. It felt a bit cafeteria.   I wasn't a fan of the maitre' d asking if we were 'ready to apply for our passport' - ugh - so cheesy. \\n\\nWe are very well traveled and after living in Chicago for many years, have in addition experienced many cuisines while living there. \\n\\nSadly, the authenticity of each item was lacking. I get it when something is inspired by but at each turn dishes were so far off the beaten path, it could hardly use the same name. \\n\\nWe ordered fish tacos. They came rolled up (i.e. flautas/taquitos, not tacos) in flour tortillas (dry). The fish wasn't particularly hot, or flavorful - nor was the salsa. The 3 sauces were bland and oddly flavored against the cilantro spread on the taco (which tasted as if it had a curry flavor almost).  The avocado sauce (forgot the name but not called guacamole) was brown (but green in the middle) and far too spicy as it overwhelmed the flavors of everything else.\\n\\nAlso ordered was cajun shrimp & grits. Literally. The shrimp & grits were barely touching and each were each lacking in flavor. The grits had visible chives but no detectable seasoning. White Grits. The shrimp were aside and may as well have been eaten separately.  Atop the grits was a single fried okra. All alone. The whole dish was so disconnected. It needed something to bring the flavors together and to unify the dish. Please guys - take a look at the Crooks Corner Chapel Hill, NC recipe - the shrimp & grits need an identity. \\n\\nBacon & Scallops:  The scallops were good but mine was very sandy. the 2 flat, hard chips of bacon that were in the center of the dish were not easy to eat in a way that would again, unify the flavors of the total dish. Instead it was scallops, then bacon, then below the scallops was a mash of something (not identified on the menu and bland).  \\n\\nSteak Frites. Were ok - the fries were 5 stars...truffle garlic parmesan - hard to go wrong there. The steak was undercooked and needed seasoning. \\n\\nWe love fat cat. We've been going since they opened (and again went last night) - I will continue being one of their best customers but it will be a while before I go back to Passport - except maybe to sit at the bar.  Speaking of that - the front bar area looked very cozy and it had a great beer selection (except the country of origin for Duvel was misidentified - it's Belgian guys).  \\n\\nThe mussels looked great - maybe I'll try them next time. I'll give it another chance - hopefully they'll work through some of the flavor kinks.

It's right next to st. Regis hotel and you could valet park on the first level. You could either walk the stairs or take the elevator to the upper level.  We went on a Saturday night at 6:00 which was a pretty good time. The restaurant was not very big so it's not very crowded during this time. The service was excellent. \\nOur waitress was very knowledgeable. She knows exactly the ingredients in each dish. They had people walked around filling your water glass and collected your dishes as soon as you finished one dish.\\nThe sashimi was pretty fresh, they asked you if you'd like fresh ground wasabi ($15 per oz)I wish they could tell us there was a charge beforehand. However the fresh ground wasabi did taste better but I don't think we would ask for it next time. \\nWe ordered the fish collar and miso sea bass. Both dishes were impeccable. Especially the sea bass just melted in your mouth, and the miso they created for this dish was right on the spot. \\nWe also had the lobster roll which was good but nothing to write home about. However they did a really good job with the sushi rice, just the right amount around the roll.\\nWe asked to see if we could have a sushi rice with Umi and tie on it. They were really accommodating and made them for us. The uni was delicious.\\nThey brought out the dish one at a time. So it would take a while for you to eat here. They also were very considerate about  the order of the food that came out. We ordered what we wanted at the beginning. They brought out the light dishes first and sent out the roll at the end. \\nThe last but not the least was their green tea souffl√©!! I heard so many people have been talking about it. Make sure you order it at the beginning because it took awhile to make it. It was the best dessert we had for a long time. The crust was light and crispy, and the green tea was excellent and it did not have the bitter taste the green tea usually had.\\nWe had a wonderful experience there. One thing the could improve will be their bathroom. Japanese is known for their cleanness everywhere.

The waitstaff was also super accomodating, giving us HH prices when we'd walked in 2 minutes before 7 pm (we hadn't expected or asked for that, but I appreciated the gesture and quality service!).  There was also plenty of space to sit, and parking is fairly easy with the large lots.\\n\\nOverall, this place offers really good food and options.

The prices are based on the color of the plate so it doesn't take long to drop a quick 20 to 30 dollars here but if you are selective you can get out a little cheaper.

After enjoying the refreshing salads on the hot summer night we got ordered our entrees.  I forget which seafood dish my dad picked, but I remember I got the rabbit and it was phenomenal.  To be honest I had never had rabbit before - but this dish turned me into a big fan! I have had it several other times but this was my favorite.  We also ordered a bottle of pinot noir to go with our entrees and I remember my dad was impressed with their wine list.\\n\\nI look forward to coming back here - whether it is just for drinks and appetizers at the riverfront bar (to save money!!) or if I feel like splurging for the whole dinner (when I have visitors in town!).

The clincher? Brunch. After arriving in the Rainy Street Nebula on Sunday at noon, my BF and I took a deep breath a prepared to fight about where his car might wedge into along the narrow streets. Less than five minutes later, we were sitting in the car, under a shady tree. Not too shabby. When we returned to our car at 2pm though, this typically interstellar cloud of dust and young good for nothings and begun to swell and are spot was wanted by someone else. The past couple of times we have gone, we haven't had to deal with an unfriendly, rude crowd at Banger's, so we are pretty happy.\\n\\nWe had a small group and were seated immediately. They need umbrellas because that sun beat us down like jalapeno on a habanero. Our solution to cool off was the MAmiso, a humungous mimosa. Don't you hate it when you go to brunch and are offered a mimosa which has only a tablespoon of champagne? Not here. My friend and I split this monstrosity because it had a liter of champagne in it. Yea! The o.j. was good too. I couldn't decide between the eggs Benedict with pork belly or the huevos rancheros. Next time, I will order the eggs Benedict because the huevos rancheros was too much food and too spicy for my threshold. The huevos rancheros were piled on chips that were overdone, but the ranchero sauce was all over the place which was good because no chip was dry but also bad because no chip could cool the river of heat seeping into every pore of my tongue. The avocado on top of the well-prepared eggs made these one of the best dishes I have had in a long time. \\n\\nThe service is always good; orders are taken correctly, no tickets are mixed up in large parties, and while they aren't with a happy-happy-joy-joy attitude, they are nice. Our server for brunch was friendly and attentive. I will say that I think they get spread too thinly. We had a good 20 minutes during which we couldn't find him to freshen our drinks, but we could tell it was because he was running around to other tables. The band playing was really loud, so it was difficult to even hear the persons next to me; however, they were smoking! They played such a range of hits, and we played, \\"name that song\\" at our table.   \\n\\nI have been here for sausage and beer a couple of times before and found the sausage and bun choices delicious. The first time was with a very large group of Yelpers. The pretzel bun sounds like a good idea, but is a bit stiff so getting a nice bite with the juicy sausage is a bit iffy. Mind you, I love pretzels, but it just doesn't work. The salad is fresh and a refreshing addition to the meal. In addition to being a pretzel lover, I also come running when I hear \\"housemade pickles,\\" so I couldn't wait to eat the entire jar that was offered on the menu. However, when I heard from the server they would fry them, I knew that was a good option; after all, I would have to share them. They were a big hit for the table. The beer selection is expansive and the servers know their beers.\\n\\nThey have a big pig roast, which I hope to try next time it rolls around.

For a started we ordered the fried cheese curds. I completely forgot we ordered them until the manager came over and said they would be out in 2 min and he was sorry the order got lost. When they did come out 2 min later the manager also brought us fried pickles...OMG these were the highlight of the night. Never have I had a fried pickle this good. They were real dill pickles that were big and crunchy and flavorful and the breading was also crunchy and good. We inhaled these and basically fought over them. You must order these if you go. For our main course I got the duck and fig banger(sausage). It came out on a super soft, big fluffy bun that melted in your mouth. Not only was the banger huge it had caramelized onions and fig chutney on top, delicious!

The Pad Kana Moo Grob was frigging amazing, stir fried just the right way with a smokey taste.\\n\\nThe Kaang Som is a non-coconut milk based curry, which makes it a million times healthier. It's tart and maybe a little exotic tasting for those out there that aren't up for a challenge. The Pad Kana Moo Grob is perfect for those who like... fried meat and veggies. The fried pork will remind you of fried pork skins, if you are into those.\\n\\nThese dishes were on the Thai menu.

Are these the same people who order hamburguesas at Mexican restaurants? If you're going to go to a restaurant called the Texas Chili parlor, you order the chili. If you don't like chili, don't go to the Texas Chili parlor. It's not a difficult concept. Although, on second thought, if you don't like chili, you actually totally should eat at TCP, because it might make you a convert. Their chili isn't the gross stuff from a can that resembles dog food. It's more like a really flavorful, spicy beef stew. This is Texas, so it doesn't have beans. They do, I believe, have some options that do contain beans. Don't order them. They are only there to pay service to vegetarians and northerners. You have a choice of X, XX, or XXX, the only difference being the spice level. I've only ever had XX. It's pretty serious. My dad, who has a better spice tolerance than I do, thought that XX was sufficiently spicy. So don't order XXX unless you like things absurdly spicy. I've never had X, but I would guess that if you don't have much of a taste for spicy food, it is your best option. When you receive your chili, you will note that it is made with chunks of beef rather than the ground sort that lazy people use when they make chili. There is no comparison. It is much better this way. Again, there are no beans. Beans are what lazy northerners put in chili. That's not how we do things in Texas. Again, it's better like that (and I like beans).

Food is consistently good. You get great value for a place that is just a few steps from Robson. \\n\\nI usually come here during the lunch hour and 80% of the time I order the shio ramen with cha-shu pork (which is an extra $1) and get a chicken karaage for only an extra $2.99. I love the soup base that comes with the ramen and it really hits the spot when it is cold out. The karaage is also fantastic...crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The karaage combined with the ramen is quite a bit of food and I end up sharing with my coworkers.\\n\\nToday I went there for an early dinner at 5:15pm which is in time for their happy hour which runs daily from 3pm - 6pm. The service was pretty good as the waitress came by twice to refill our green tea (which by the way they charged $1.50/pp - not sure if this is new or in effect during Happy hour). We ordered a few of the Royal Miyagi raw oysters which were $.99 each. As this is only the 2nd time i've had raw oysters, I can't really provide too much insight.

In the Mediterranean, we all wait a whole year for 3 weeks of green plum craze. They are extremely tart, super crunchy and very refreshing. Dip it in salt and fire away until you can't feel your teeth. After moving here, I kinda forgot about them, until one of my relatives reminded me it is the season. Saturday task; head out to North Shore and sniff around.\\n\\nI do not know the restaurant part of the whole deal, I think they moved it to a new location. This review is just for the supermarket. The place looks clean compared to other middle eastern stores. If you know what you are looking for, they have it all. I asked for the plums. The gentleman at the cash register was very kind and helpful. He went to the back and brought a box out. I was pretty pretty happy. They have an array of middle eastern products which is very standard. \\n\\nWhat struck me was their lamb on their (and pretty much this is why i am writing this review) meat display. Well it is local lamb, just by looking at meat's dry quality in the packaging, it has never been frozen, and very very cheap. Buying local lamb in this city is kind of ridiculously budget gauging, the alternative is Australian, which is somewhat decent quality, but just do not like the idea of it being slaughtered, god knows when and frozen in blocks.... New Zealand version, I am not a big fan, the breed must be smaller, not meaty enough. \\n\\nThe whole lamb shoulder rack was $11, lamb kidneys (acquired taste, but i grew up with it), 2 in a package, $0.80, 2 meaty shanks $7, whole lamb' neck to cook mom's Kekek, which you can not get anywhere again, dirt cheap.Annnnnddddddd!!!!!

Think of the French version of what you get at Fogo. You have to ask, they aren't on the menu, but so worth getting.\\n-French Onion soup - a classic, but done so well by BN. Full of rich beefy and oniony flavor. I had it in April and had to order it again.\\n-Magret de Canard Roti - My mom was thrilled with her duck breast so much she asked if we could come back again. Sold!\\n-Braised short ribs bourginone - If a short rib is on the menu, odds are I am going to order it. And this did not disappoint. Falling apart, no knife needed. Rich wine sauce that just had me savoring every morsel.\\n--Profiteroles and ice cream - this is their complimentary dessert. For my Mom's birthday they brought it out without almonds on top so I could share it. Not so much for Tom E.'s. That's okay, I ended up with my own dessert in November.\\n-Mushroom and fontina flatbread - You had me at mushrooms. Every Earthy bite just sang in my mouth. The funkiness of the cheese along with all those delicious mushrooms, I could have eaten this all myself.\\n-Croque madame - so the one thing they messed up. It came out without the egg. I had to wait for James to ask him about it. By the end sandwich was cold. Also, not enough bechamel on the sandwich for me.

LOL.\\n\\nI have yet to really be disappointed. Sure, my sandwich was not the greatest, but I was mostly full by then anyway and everything else has been so spot-on, I can't really complain.

Tequila selection seemed rather limited for a bar that advertises itself as \\"Tacos and Tequila.\\" Girlfriend said her burrito bowl was decent but nothing special. On the plus side, the tortilla chips appeared homemade and were fresh. Both salsas were tasty, but too runny for my preference.

The first was about a year and a half ago. The bar was set high and they have delivered the same remarkable food and service each time.\\nI have done the appetizer happy hour once and numerous dinners. The happy hour is a great way to sample their delicious starters at a great price. Get two and you won't need to order the main course!\\nMy favorite has got to be the crispy salmon. I've tried other menu items and have had a happy tummy with each of them. The only criticism I've heard on the food from anyone I've eaten with was that the Chorizo tenderloins were a touch spicy (this coming from someone who is almost spicy averse). I have found other Jack fans in my circle and each of them also LOVE Jack's. I recently took my cousin from Alabama to Jack's on his last night in town. He said Jack's was the best experience he had while in Austin. Food, service, atmosphere (great night on the patio by the fire).\\nDesserts: the options change seasonally. I'm not convinced that Jack isn't rotating them just so I am left wanting more. For instance the Key Lime Pie. I had it once, fell in love, and then it went off menu. You see I am still talking about it. Well played Jack. There are plenty of other options. The apple cobbler when in season and the always faithful blondie.\\nThe staff has always been great. I've come to recognize a few waiters and hostesses by name. They are very helpful, knowledgable about the menu, and never pushy.\\nSo all smiles and hugs? I have one suggestion that has nothing to do with the food. In my opinion the entrance (front door) to the restaurant says \\"shhh, welcome to jack's.\\"  I think it could be redone so that folks get \\"HOWDY! WELCOME TO JACK'S!!  WE ARE DOWN HOME COOKING! WE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR TASTE BUDS PROPOSE TO OUR FOOD AND YOU'LL WANT TO COME BACK THE SECOND YOU LEAVE!\\"\\nSo, there it is.

I hate to say it, but I'm on the verge of a 2 star rating here. I've gone to this location for a few years, frequently enough to see the changes. The wings are okay, but nothing terrific. They have a lot of sauces, so there is a flavor or mix that everyone can find. If it's not a wing day, the wings are a little pricey. The rest of the food is not that good & often bland, unless you add sauce to everything. These traits are generally consistent with all other locations, so if you have been to others, you know what to expect with the food. Knowing that, let's talk about service and people... The severs and bartenders are generally pretty good and some are terrific. This place has had a ton of turnover in the past months and they have gone down hill fast and losing long time customers. The closest location has closed, so they absorbed some of the staff, which is not the issue. I would imagine the issue is with management. Ignoring the enormous turnover, things are disorganized, slow, and rare to get food that is hot. On too many occasions I have sat at the bar while the bartender is working the inside and outside bars, to have a manager come right next to me and see I needed help and ignore me. Recently I found out a manager actually told someone to chat with us to distract us for a few minutes, instead of getting a simple draft brew. \\n\\nConclusion - mid of the road wing joint that needs to get on track fast.\\n\\n\\nUpdate November 2017 -\\n\\n- Always short staffed on bartenders during happy hour. \\n- Specials continue to change frequently and are getting worse. \\n- Some of the management stays away from customers and food issues are not addressed well. \\n- Turnover is high and you can see unhappy employees \\n- Most servers and bartenders are still extremely friendly."},{"name":"IL Mondo Pizzeria","address":"738 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"UGHHHH! the most delicious pizza on the face of the planet.

Anyone who is a sucker for packaging will love the bento box. The food is presented so orderly and it almost looks too nice to eat.

We went on a busy weekday night during the evening. We had to wait a while - they said 20 minutes - and 15 minutes later, we were sitting down. (Aside: I really like restaurants who overestimate time for sitting - if you wait longer than they say, they usually do not have their act together!) \\n\\nThe atmosphere is lively and simply amazing for a brewery. One thing I loved about the restaurant were how spacious the tables were. I had to look to see if we were just sitting in an abnormally long table, but all of the tables were very spacious (from what I could see.) It made for a great relaxing environment. There were a few TVs, nothing overpowering, which were nice touches. I happened to catch a college football game during the meal, but the TV was small enough and high enough that it would not distract myself and the rest of my party throughout the evening (unlike a sports bar or Buffalo Wild Wings).\\n\\nOur waitress was very personable and very kind. Throughout the night, she was great. The one knock (which actually wasn't on her) was that our food was not brought out together. I had to wait several minutes for my flat bread before the rest of my party could enjoy their meals. \\n\\nI chose the meaty flat bread pizza, reasonably priced at $13. I have to say, it was honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life. The quality of the ingredients were high and the pizza was cooked to perfection. Each bite melted in my mouth. It has been a real long time since I've had a pizza this delicious. If I come back, I might try the spinach flat bread.\\n\\nFor beer, I chose the Black Obsidian Stout. They called this stout \\"very approachable,\\" which I would agree with. It definitely had very woody undertones, but for a stout, was very controlling in its flavor (not too powerful, but not weak.) They had this on nitro tap, which certainly improved the quality of the beer greatly. I've had their Black Butte Porter as well in previous occasions, which I'd say is a top notch porter.\\n\\nI highly recommend Deschutes Brewery, and will absolutely return when I find myself back in Portland. Overall, my party and I had an excellent evening with fantastic service, fantastic food, and fantastic beer.

Also, when you know people probably want to order lots of small dishes over the course of the night, they should check up on you a little more often.

When the MIT student center had a prime piece of vacant retail in late 2004, they put up a vote to the student body over what potential eatery they'd prefer there. It wasn't binding at all, just wishful thinking, but students overwhelmingly wanted an Anna's. Did anyone believe we could actually strike a deal with the franchise and make it happen? I didn't! It was as big a deal as the Sox winning the world series that year, and I'm not exaggerating.\\n\\nIt was incredibly cheap, filling, and convenient. I probably wasn't the only student to flip out over super burritos that following year. I ate one every damn day. Carnitas, steak, al pastor would each go in there depending on flights of my mood. I would've bought their merchandise (T-shirts, foam hands) if they'd had any. These days, I just shake my head at the abundance of enthusiasm I had for Anna's and how defensive I got if anyone even hinted they weren't all that.\\n\\nSomething in the attitude of the student body collectively turned by the end of 2006. It wasn't backlash; it was a honeymoon ending. It might have been triggered by the greasy stink that permeated the entire ground floor of the student center and tested the patience of people trying to study. People also realized that, oh yeah, eating an enormous burrito can make your gut feel disgusting for a couple hours afterwards. \\n\\nStill, people kept eating because the value was unbeatable. Where else could you pick up dinner in two minutes as you rushed for an LSC movie you were late for? Or eat and finish your lunch while you walked to lecture? Stockholm syndrome is real.\\n\\nI'll bet many others in my graduating class had a similar conflicted relationship with Anna's. I now see the saga as an allegory for the kind of marriage I hope I don't have, where you stick around mainly to preserve status quo.

Our beer sampler came out and we jumped right into it, trying what we had picked. All of the beer were excellent. We ended up taking our time drinking the sampler because the waitress mentioned the desert menu and it sounded amazing.

It's a great alternative to fighting the crowds downtown or down South. My previous opinion on the parking situation was mysterious. There is PLENTY of parking. I think at the time, my fat ass was lazy and wanted front step parking. Ignore the Tony B of the Summer of 2011. The proverbial cherry on top has to be the service.

Lamb Gyro - much larger than expected. They are definitely not cheap because they put looots of meat in it!! You better have a lot of napkins and a fork while eating it because it will get messy.

Not many others did as well.  Price for two sides and two sandwiches with drink $45.  Not really great value.

Rarely do you experience the worse service at a restaurant with so many of your friends at the same time. \\n I was the first to arrive and ordered what they called Root Beer, since I personally have a mission to try every kind of Root Beer I can get my hands on I was quite excited to give it a try. Well when the tan liquid arrived I was surprised to find it tasted nothing like Root Beer and was more akin to water from a river after a bear used it as a loo. When I told the server it was bad she simply shrugged and moved on.\\n Once my friends arrived we all looked over the menu to place out orders. Half of the table decided on biscuits & gravy being it was the first item on the menu and were told it is the best thing there. Well as a sign of things to come they ran out of biscuits. One thing to stress is the place was not busy in the slightest so this was a shock. Our waitress after taking our orders proceeds to only come by the table once more to check on drinks, we order more drinks and ask for water none of these arrive. Attempts to find our waitress are unsuccessful. When we asked about the service we were blown off. For about the last hour or so we were there we could not find the server. It was only when it was time to pay the bill that she finally appeared. \\n We can say the food was quite good but the awful and rude service was not worth the hassle.

We started with the short rib arancini - they were good but really rich so make sure you're hungry if you start with these. Then we tried the soppressata pizza, which was delicious. We got a half order of the bolognese - the sauce was really nice but a little on the salty side - and the chicken parm which was awesome (fyi - it doesn't come with pasta). Even though we were stuffed, we were talked into ordering dessert so we decided on the cannolis - great choice! The filling was so good and there were plenty of chocolate chips. Great first visit and definitely won't be the last."},{"name":"Nick's Food To Go","address":"240 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Perfect place for a lunch or a quick affordable bite.

He went up to the bar to order drinks and food each time, he said the bartenders were pleasant and very helpful. BUT the hotdogs were terrible. The kolache bun they came on was soggy and could not hold together. I got the duck sausage and he got the rabbit. They were dry and came with little condiments.

While dining in the restaurant I noticed something on the menu that was not marked vegan, but usually is made vegan.  I asked the waiter what was in the dish that was not vegan.  Not only did he not know, he had no idea what vegan even meant.  If you are going to mark your food as vegan you might want to train your waitstaff on the concept.

Cut into shoestrings and with a thick batter, they stayed crunchy to the very last one. And yes we devoured the giant plate down to just a few morsels. The lumpy housemade marinara it came with only made it better. At $9, it was a huge portion that could have been shared with 3-4 people.\\n\\nWe ordered entrees which were decent but not as good as the zucchini fries appetizer. The regular menu of entrees is kind of expensive (over $20 and most on the the higher end of the scale) but the specials of the day menu was surprisingly inexpensive by comparison at around $12/14.\\n\\nWe ordered two specials of the day: blackened chicken with mushroom risotto and crab cake sandwich. The blackened chicken was about what you would expect, and the mushroom risotto came with a huge portion but was overly cheesy and there were hardly any mushrooms in it. It would have been nice to have the risotto balanced out with more flavors from the mushrooms. The housemade crab cake was not heavily fried which I liked but not too memorable. The sandwich had thick red onions which were seared but should have been grilled more thoroughly, arugula and a nice mayo sauce. It came with housemade chips which were cut thick so pretty hard to bite although my companion liked them.\\n\\nOther than the zucchini fries, the entrees were a 3-star experience but my overall rating is 4 stars because the atmosphere is great, service was attentive and friendly, and their happy hour is pretty darn good. Happy hour is dine-in only until 7pm throughout the whole restaurant, not just the bar, and local craft beer is half price and you can get $1.50 domestics (Bud, Miller, etc). There are a handful of half-price appetizers too, but not the zucchini fries. If the zucchini fries were on the happy hour menu, you know where I would be every day at 6pm!\\n\\nTIP: Located in a nice part of downtown Powell, across from Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams, which is worth a visit after dinner."},{"name":"B.J.

I decided to go for their oxtail stew that comes rice and peas, cabbage and fried plantains (http://bit.ly/1psbxFh).  I may be overhyping it when I say this oxtail stew is the best I've had but it really is a panty dropper!!  Meat easily falls off the bone and that sauce... oohhh that SAWSE.

I asked for a manager HE REFUSED TO GET THE MANAGER. Instead he threatened us \\nEven though we had done nothing but sit at the bar and pay our check. Two other employees surrounded us and began to harass us even though we were literally just sitting at the bar finishing our drinks (well a drink because Chris refused to give my friend back his unfinished drink that we paid for) Chris asked us to leave because he would not acknowledge that he was being racist and prejudice. He accused me and my friend and I of saying and doing things that we did not do. When we tried to explain to him that we did not do these things he was very dismissive and rude. His way of rectifying the situation was to ask us (The only black people in the bar) To leave, and embarrass us, all because he could not apologize for assuming we were upset. We were drinking Jag√´r!!! Who's upset when you're drinking Jag√´r????!!!! not to mention we STILL paid our $95 check and tipped him a $20 bill on top of the bullshit :)\\n\\nI'm not one to believe the hype but this bar caters to the Caucasian crowd and that's OK if that's your demographic, but I've been here twice and myself included I've witnessed the only African-Americans in the establishment treated hostly.

The food was good and very well presented, and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. It's on the small side (although there does seem to be a good-sized patio) but they make the most of the space that they have.\\n\\nThe menu is tapas style, so all small plates for sharing. There are ~10 plates on the menu, and we shared 5-6 between the two of us. Our waitress mentioned that she has seen many couples just eat their way down the entire menu, and after eating, it definitely seems possible. The food is very creative, and the kitchen finds very unique ways to use different ingredients. That extends to the cocktail menu as well - we thought the options were unique to the restaurant and very good!\\n\\nOne thing that really stood out from beginning to end was the service. I had mixed up my reservation, and the hostess was incredibly patient and accommodating while I figured it out. Our main waitress answered a ton of our questions when we first sat down, and every waiter/waitress who brought a dish was very knowledgeable and gave us a very detailed explanation of the dish.\\n\\nReservations - Just so you know! Reservations open on something like the 2nd Friday of the month at noon for the next month's set of reservations, and they go QUICKLY. You are charged $20pp to make a reservation, but that charge is credited to your bill when you dine. If you can't get a reservation, there are ~7 bar seats that are open for walk-ins, although I would recommend you come in very early to snag a seat.\\n\\nThere is valet parking, but you can also normally find plenty of street parking in the area depending on the night (maybe not as much on the weekend). It can be helpful to do valet the first time because the entrance can be a bit tricky to find, so the valet can help direct you."},{"name":"The Soda Fountain","address":"2525 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Had a scoop of caramel sea salt ice cream and Corey had the root beer float.

Tomato:  the sauce was like eating a can of three day old tomato paste.  Basil:  chopped to holy hell and not visually appealing at all.  Mozzarella:  not so bad, but nothing great.  Crust:  hard, dense, heavy...like microwave pizza.  So bad. \\n\\nThe other pizza, I forget what it was called, had large globs of goat cheese (ew),  huge clumps of sun dried tomatoes (ew), and what I was told was prosciutto, although it looked like shredded deli ham.

He would decide our courses but if we wanted something specific we were more than welcome to order it at an additional cost. \\n\\nHe started us off with some sashimi appetizers. Just look at my pictures for reference because I don't know what they were and I don't want to mislead you. They were a great start to a greater evening. \\n\\nAfterwards we had some sashimi. It came with an assortment of goodies including scallop, otoro (fattiest most $$$ fire flame best part of tuna), salmon, tuna, octopus, and some other fishes that I don't know the name of. \\n\\nChef Ito was chatting us up and mingling with us the whole time. Super knowledgeable and interesting guy. \\n\\nAnyways, back to the food.\\n\\nSo afterwards he gave us a hot plate. On that hot plate was some of the most buttery delicious lobster I've ever had. If this was the only thing I ate tonight I still would have left satisfied. \\n\\nThen came some other kind of fish with some root that you only eat the pink part off of. Once again, look at my pics for reference. The fish was delicious and cooked beautifully. As expected of this restaurant. Was it the star of the show? Not at all but I liked it a lot anyway. \\n\\nMy brother had been here before and I've never had wagyu beef so he put in an order for some. I didn't believe in all of the hype up until this point. You telling me that some drunk cows that eat some magic grass are going to taste better than any other cow? WELL YOU RIGHT! \\n\\nWagyu beef was sooooooo good. The lobster and wagyu beef were my favorites of the night if I'm just being perfectly honest here. Yes it's a sushi restaurant but there is a reason why they serve these dishes. \\n\\nNext was the sushi platter. Man. This was the next favorite of the night. It has been a while since I was there but if my memory serves me correctly he served tuna, yellow fin with truffle oil, otoro, salmon, wagyu, and I forgot what kind of nigiri. Each and every single one of them was just perfection. They also make you eat them with your hands so you better use those wet cloths they provide so as not to taint these jewels with your dirty savage hands! \\n\\nAs an extra service Chef Ito dropped a gigantic mutant shrimp nigiri on the same platter. Use the picture of the other nigiri compared to this shrimp for a size comparison if you please. This monster shrimpzilla was meaty and delicious. \\n\\nFor dessert I wanted to try this chocolate ball but they didn't have it so we got a chocolate bento box instead. It came with a lava cake and green tea ice cream. They both blended very well together but it's not the best dessert I've ever had. \\n\\nNeedless to say, the whole meal was so great that nothing can really make me give this place a bad review. \\n\\nIt cost a little more than $350 for my brother and me so if you have the money to spend I highly highly recommend eating at Umi."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I come here every time I come through Atlanta.

That's all.\\n\\nAs the name suggests, they have a mean chili. Real hearty chunks of beef, yet it falls apart in your mouth. And let's not forget the frito pie!

I grew up eating congee whenever I was sick, and the beef rice soup is the same consistency, so it's like the ultimate comfort food for me. The grilled beef with butter is really good too, but I get too lazy to grill the meat sometimes. :( \\n\\nThe avocado smoothie is everythingggggg.

As someone new to Portland, I am always excited to try a new restaurant.\\n\\nThe space was easy to find and very well decorated.   I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant.  We were seated promptly with no wait and our drinks came fast.\\n\\nWe ordered the Pigs in a Blanket, which tasted all right.  The kobe beef hot dog was great, but I found the cheese fondue to be really bland.  It was billed as a cheddar fondue.  When I think cheddar, I think sharp! Like it actually has a taste! This just felt like something wet to help you choke it down.  So that was the beginning of our disappointment.\\n\\nFor dinner, we decided to split some of their lobster mac and cheese.  The lobster taste completely overpowered it, in my opinion.  Which is weird, really, since there were only two minuscule pieces of lobster on the top of the dish.  The orzo was cooked well and I didn't mind the taste of the full dish at first, but after about six bites I found it to completely oversaturate my palate.  It made me kind of sick.\\n\\nHonestly, after a few minutes, I couldn't even stand smelling it so I pushed it to the middle of the table.  I mean, I had hardly eaten any of it.\\n\\nAfter I had done that, our waitress looked right at our table several times but seemed to avoid us.  She never asked how we liked the meal or anything!  I felt like she was trying to avoid a confrontation.  Since it was that I simply did not care for the meal, I would have appreciated offering to replace it with something else or perhaps comping us for it.\\n\\nTo just completely disregard a customer's obvious displeasure with the food is a HUGE service faux pas. \\n\\nWe will not be going back."},{"name":"Pho 2000","address":"198 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"Order their \\"7 courses of beef\\". \\n\\nIT'S SO FUN! \\n\\n++~$35 for a 2 person set.

Everything is DIY. \\n\\nWith each different course, you take the beef that you cooked and place them on rice sheets that are normally used to make fresh Vietnamese spring rolls. A mountain of fresh herbs, vegetables, and vermicelli are provided for you to stuff your fresh roll to your liking. \\n\\nOutline of the courses: \\n1st course- beef dipped in a clear broth + vinegar \\n2nd course- beef that is cooked in a baby wok with a simmering block of butter \\n3rd course- raw beef that is lightly marinated. I was a little ambivalent eating raw beef but as long as you're not immunocompromised, you should be okay right?  \\n4th, 5th, 6th course comes on 1 plate- one gigantic ground up beef ball and 2 variations of ground beef on skewers \\n7th course- beef congee/porridge \\n\\n--The 4th, 5th, and 6th course beef had too much pepper corn in them that weren't finely grinded- so expect to bite on chunks which is not pleasant. I stopped eating them because I do not like pepper corn. My man on the other hand was picking them out to make it bearable to eat. \\n\\n++The most fun comes out of the first 2 courses and getting to tailor your own rolls.

We navigated here from hotel to arrive at 11:15 and business was closed. I tried the phone number to no answer. We decided to try another veg place and I decided before we completely left area to try calling again, this time to an answer! The other end apologized and owned she was late. We turned around and drove back.  Like many other reviews mentioned , the service is slow. The establishment is a little dark and outdated as well.  My friend also had ordered at least 3 items that they were out of! All this being said, it was still worth the wait! We loved our chicken fried vegan steak, yummy Mac n cheese and I had broccoli as well. Delicious gravy on the entree! No alcohol here and just some specialty sodas or juice to drink.

BAMM!!!\\n\\nMy Family is in town and Mom wanted breakfast at night from somewhere in SW Portland area but I couldn't find anything. So yelp a list of other restaurants including The Original Dinerant and it looked the most creative and original. When we arrived it was 2/3 full with people laughing and enjoying themselves (good sign). We sat down and noticed that everyone on the staff was smiling. That doesn't happen much anymore in the service industry (good sign #2). The Hostess was smiling and it was infectious. Then within 10 seconds she was back giving us water and asking if she could get us anything we already knew we wanted to start off with (not very common and good sign #3). Looking around, the design and ambiance was \\"Diner\\" but it was a fantastic mix of classic and modern in its appearance and feel. Not too edgy or homey.................... Comfortable. It was definitely comfortable, and that's what matters most.\\n\\nThen....................the menu. WHOA! Creative and inspiring and full of enough different savory and sweet choices that I honestly couldn't make up my mind. Well into the the creative and \\"experimental\\" taste combinations, but not so far out on a limb (as most restaurants have gone) as to leave you disappointed and thinking \\"Hmmm? That really wasn't as good as it was built up or supposed to be?\\"\\n\\nWe started off with the Chocolate Cake Shake. I could have made a meal of this thing alone. Little bits of thicker chocolate in the mix with an almost cake like texture to them made me keep spooning until I got throat-freeze. A great combination of chocolates and little bits of hard chocolate mixed in made it truly amazing (I think I will start off with this tomorrow for our 11:30 Brunch reservation). Our server Anna was super nice and had a warm quality to her that showed through as she took the time to tell us about the items on the menu and why she liked them, and then she related them to other flavors or tastes we might know. We were only at the point where we were ordering drinks and finding out about the menu and it was already apparent that we had found a place that fully represented what service is about! I don't know everything, but I know good service when I get it, and this was it! While we were waiting for our food, our assistant server Alison brought out a small \\"one-bite\\" size square ramekin of their Cobb salad and it was fantastic. Light and creamy dressing that was flavorful but still let the natural flavors of the bacon, chicken avocado, sweet mini tomato, and egg to come through clearly, all in one bite. BAMM!!!!\\n\\nI had the Creme Brulee French Toast and a side of Bacon. It was truly an experience. The toast was 2\\" thick with powdered sugar caramelized on top of it, then more sprinkled on top of that. Inside it was cooked just right  with a slightly sweet taste and it started to melt in my mouth before I could start chewing. Then their house-made Marionberry jam and Honey-Butter were equally as much of an experience. I suggest a equal drizzle of each on top and you'll be wondering how hard it would be to make this at home, or if you even could.\\n\\nMom had the Caprese Panini and thoroughly enjoyed what she was able to eat of it. Luckily she has a small stomach and I got to lightly re-heat it this morning and have the rest. WOW! Great mix of flavors and textures, with a thin house-made Focaccia bread that was soft and chewy, and added flavor instead of taking it away from the sandwich as many overly thick breads do.\\n\\nAfter all of the great food and wonderful service, I stopped Max, the Manager and asked him a question about the definition of \\"up\\" for a cocktail, and about Absinthe. Without hesitation he went and grabbed a small shot of Absinthe so that we could experience the smells and aroma of the liquor as well as take a few sips to experience the flavors and slight bite that permeates from the start to the finish of drink.\\n\\nTo Anna, Alison, Max , and the Hostess that greeted us - Your TOP Notch service is half the reason we are coming back tomorrow for Sunday Brunch.\\n\\nTo the Chef - Your Creative, TOP Notch flavor combinations and well made foods are the other half of the reason we are coming back tomorrow for Sunday Brunch.\\n\\n\\nWhat can I say but AMAZING?
