Their sides aren't too impressive, they call them wagon style sides because they are the same recipes from the old days when there were no refrigerators so they are meant to be simple, still good though!

No reservations, cash only, wait on sidewalk in single file so pedestrians can get through. I stood 45 min in the light rain and don't regret it! The only thing that had me wondering was the negativity regarding the \\"rude blond waitress\\". Let me tell you Rose...Rose something is her name Rosealea....Rosealynn..Roseann?? Not sure...is not rude. She is a busy organized lady with an awful lot to do. If she comes off as rude you might be Whiny or expecting more pampering. She is straightforward and no baloney. She made suggestions and described the menu well. Her style allows her to slap food on your table in record time. The seating area is approx 25' square with 13-14 tables and a bar where they seat singles like me and a nice lady from California on business. Rose manages the 25-35 people standing in line on sidewalk, every 3D or 4th trip out she writes down how many in your party. Reminds everyone to stand in single file. On top of all this she waits on tables. Service is fast paced. No computers in this place. Cash is king. Change is made the good old fashioned way of peeling them off a wad. Come to think of it I don't think I saw a cash register. Super good food.

The restaurant seemed to reach it's peak in popularity shortly after it moved to it's own brand new building. The food is just as good as always, and the same people work there, but I think the popularity has gone down a little because there's a certain type of people who walk into a building, see a few chips of paint missing or some build- up of grime in the corners from years of mopping and they just won't eat there. They feel more comfortable at a homogeneous corporate chain where everything is predictable. Well if they judge Super Burrito based on the fact that there once shiny new building has a few dings then they're going to miss out on some of the best authentic Mexican fast food in the area. They have good prices, gi-huge-ic portions, and consistent quality. Everything i've tried at Super Burrito has been super good. Try the Chimichanga plate. It's ridiculously good.

I looked up reviews around the area and Pocha Korea Bistro had some good reviews. I always drove by it when I had to go up Blue Mountain and it always looked a little bit off but the reviews say otherwise.\\n\\nGoing in, it had quite a lot of space, very open and very friendly staff.\\nWe were seated right away as there were a few tables opened but overall it was pretty busy in there.\\n\\nLooking at the pictures on yelp we already had an idea of what we wanted to order.\\n\\nWe ordered the sweet soy fried chicken, sweet soy crispy rice cakes with peanuts on top, beef tartare bimbimbap, and the beef soup with noodles.\\n\\nEverything came out at a pretty good pace. I think we waited maybe only 10 minutes before the first dish came out.\\n\\nWhen the chicken came out, it was quite loaded but you'd expect that for 16 bucks. Biting into it, it was crispy with a good amount of sweet soy flavor. However, the one thing I didn't like was it was too battered. It felt like maybe 50% of it was batter and 50% chicken. Though the flavor was good, the texture and amount of chick was definitely bringing it down. 3/5 stars\\n\\nThe next dish was the crispy rice cakes with sweet soy and peanuts. This was interesting..as my wife and I love rice cakes. This was crispy on the outside as I assume it was deep fried with the sweet soy and peanuts on top. This was not bad, but I wouldn't rave about it. I'd rather actually have boiled rice cakes or pan fried, not deep fried. I'd rate this a 3/5 stars\\n\\nThen we got the beef tartare bimbimbap. There was a lot of toppings on this one, and it looked delicious. We mixed it thoroughly and added the sauce, and then we waited for the bottom to crisp up. Unfortunately the taste didn't match the aesthetic look of it. The bowl wasn't hot enough that the rice crisped up..which was unfortunate, and for some reason the flavours just didn't work out. Compared to other bimbimbaps elsewhere..this bowl just wasn't that great. I'd rate this a 2.5/5.\\n\\nThen finally the beef soup that had slices of beef, rice cake, and also sweet potato noodle came. This was tiny for what I expected it to be. I also expected rice but they didn't give us that. The soup was pretty good, the beef was tender, and the noodles were cooked well. The only downside was the lack of size. I'd rate this a 3.5/5\\n\\nOverall the experience was not bad. Would I come back again anytime soon? Probably not, but it's definitely a good option for Korean food (but in this area there is so much competition)\\n\\nFood 3/5 Value 3/5 Service 5/5 Ambiance 4/5\\nI'd give this place overall a 3.5/5 but yelp only does full stars."},{"name":"The Cup","address":"705 Town Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"The cupcakes here are scrumptious!!

Most of us ordered the cowboy ribeye (as this is what was suggested).  The steak came out cooked to perfection; however, the cut was extremely fatty.  Now I understand a ribeye is a fatty cut, and I'm totally cool with that, but when 3/4 of your steak is ginormous globs of fat, that's not ok (I've had similar cuts at Abe & Louies and there were marbled, not like this).  Decided to give this place another try last night, sat at a table in the bar area.  Our waiter was nice and suggested the specials (bone-in strip steak).  I had the bone in strip, medium rare, and the girlfriend had the bone-in filet, medium rare.  Again, the steaks were cooked to perfection, but the cuts were extremely lack-luster.  Whoever is cooking the steaks here is right on; however, whoever is butchering them doesn't know what they are doing or just doesn't care.

He reported back to us that the tables indeed were not reserved but just that the kitchen couldn't handle any more traffic at the moment. Nevertheless he invited us to sit at a table and promised to come by and take our order as soon as he could.  Maybe this situation waiting for the table would have seemed annoying if I had a specific timeline, but I like to enjoy my drinks, and I like to enjoy my food and thus, I was happy to have a long and leisurely meal - particularly in the name of serving quality food.\\n\\nIn any case I am not a pork person ever- really - but for some reason I felt inspired by the pork dish on the menu that night - I believe it was pork served three ways.

The house BBQ sauce was different to say the least,  a bit of a sweet and tangy kick, that I found to be very useful.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was hip and trendy and they have several tvs with a bar.

My girlfriends meal then came her French Toast was still light- undercooked, and her Egg Whites were beige with specks of brown almost as if cinnamon had been sprinkled on them. She ate some of the French toast and when she attempted to try the egg whites she was saying how scared she was. She took a bite and immediately spit it out. She said the eggs tasted sour like sour milk. I went to try it and began dry heaving. They were so nasty I knew they had to be rotten.

This is a nice place to meet up with others for drinks and eats....[BUT...read and find out why]\\n\\n  I came here with friends for an after work meeting. There were about 7 of us and we order Happy Hour drinks and appetizers..so we were a worthy table with the quantities being ordered.\\n  The place was not over crowded and maybe had about 40+ people in the place.. good business for a mid-week at 6:30pm.. but not so many that the service was impacted like it was.\\n\\n  The beer selections were plentiful and cold while the food choices were good and served well, but there were some things that kept this from being a 4+ Star review.\\n\\n  The whiskey and waters ordered were diluted almost to the point of being clear. To validate our point to the waiter Evan... we simply ordered: 1 shot in a shot glass, one glass of ice in a whiskey glass (as it came previously), and a separate glass of water at the table.\\n  We proceeded to: pour the whiskey shot into the whiskey glass of ice and then pour water into that whiskey glass to fill it up (to replicate the original order)\\n  Ta-Dahh!  We held the two separate orders up (the original & the one we blended ourselves) against the light and the one we blended with the [reportedly] same ingredients and ours was DARKER.\\n  This showed that the original orders were diluted. The waiter admitted defeat and removed the other 2-3 diluted ones off of our tab. (we ordered our whiskey that way the rest of the night)\\n\\n  Point to note: we are not persnickety drinkers, we were there to meet, talk about topics, have a good time, and just try out the place for the first time. \\n  When we got our drinks.. they seemed WEAK and that led to the path of conclusion that the \\"Happy Hour\\" mixes were done that way to comp back the costs discounted by Draft Pick for their \\"Happy Hour.\\"  [True statement or not.. That is how we felt]\\n\\n  Needless to say, the future whiskey drink orders were okay since we mixed them ourselves, but my first impression was not good.\\n\\n  Through the next 2-3 hours there.. we placed drink orders and food orders, but the wait service was slow... to the point where we needed to find Evan (our waiter) to get it resolved; not cool since we wanted to hang out with each other and not chase wait service for orders.\\n  He did apologize at the end of the night stating that he was \\"training\\" two new hires... I hope they were in the kitchen, because we never saw him on the floor training people.\\n\\n  Lastly in the end, when we were closing the tabs... it took a while to once again find our waiter and then we got the tickets and they charged full price on the \\"Happy Hour\\" food and a few drinks... so, we naturally had to correct that AND wait once again.\\n\\n  Overall, I like the Draft Pick. I like the location, the menu choices, and the selections. It is a good sports bar and meet up place, but when we get there, place an order, and \\"right out the gate\\" we are debating with the staff if our drinks are what we paid for/diluted..... that's not a good first impression.\\n\\n  We were a table of seven, we ordered quite a bit and we definitely made our stay worth it. \\n\\n  In the end our waiters tip may have suffered some (YES, we still tipped.. they still deserve it for the work performed.. I am not a heartless Yelper) and they got a review that is not that pleasant as it could have been.\\n\\n  Would I recommend going there? Yes.

We ordered the fried pickles and corn fritters and both were super mouthwateringly tasty! And to top it off, our service was great! We decided to just sit at the bar since we were having only appetizers and drinks, but our bartender was very kind, talkative, and made us feel right at home! It was an overall great experience!

Oh, I also forgot to mention that they donate all net profits to local food pantries!! \\n\\nUPDATE: As stated above I planned to update my review once I attended brunch here, and I kind of wish I hadn't made that statement. I came here yesterday for Brunch with a group of 5 before Promowest Fest and was disappointed with our overall experience. There was a wait when we arrived (no big deal, everywhere was packed this weekend) but luckily we were seated in less than the 30 minutes that was anticipated for our wait. We all ordered Bloody Mary's and they looked fantastic but the flavor was lacking. It tastes more like vodka and a lot of spice but not much actual flavor. Next, the ordering process was kind of rough. Our server didn't seem to grasp that one girl was trying to order a side of biscuits and gravy and told her that wasn't an option, so she had to point out that he could just ring up a side of biscuits and a side of gravy, and then he understood. Next, we tried to order a side of Mac n Cheese and were told it wasn't an option on Brunch days, but Mac n Cheese is a meal option on brunch days, and we saw another patron order this exact thing while waiting at the bar. I'm not sure if our server was new or just wasn't familiar with what can and can't be ordered and how to fulfill customer requests.  Next, once we were seated and ordered our food it took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive. The place had cleared out except for a few tables and unfortunately due to the delay my boyfriend had to have his food boxed prior to bringing it to the table so he could make it to work on time without being able to enjoy a single bite. Two in our group ordered chicken strips and one was brought out with a side of ranch (which is actually AMAZING) and one was not. It seems there was a lack of consistency throughout our entire visit. We all ordered biscuits and all agreed that they were too starchy and very dry. Overall this wasn't a great experience from the service, to wait time, to food quality. \\n\\nWith so many amazing brunch options in our city, I doubt I go back any time soon."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Hubby and I had breakfast here the other day.

There were two guys playing acoustic guitars and singing in the background which was nice for the ambiance.  The waiter was nice, efficient and helpful with recommendations.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes from seafood dishes to chicken and fries for the kids.  I had the grilled pork chops with mofongo (this Puerto Rican wasn't in the mood for rice that day).  The pork chops were deliciously juicy and flavored.  The mofongo was perfectly moist and garlicky...melts in your mouth.  My mom and I shared an alcapurria... wow, tastes just like my mom's.

My hubby, on the other hand, puts ghost pepper sauce on everything he can. My short review is: if you like hot, you'll like this. I did not. The problem was the menu. It really needs to be rewritten by someone for whom English is the primary language (if, that is, the proprietors want to have a menu for non-Chinese speakers. Maybe they don't, and that's fine, too.) At any rate, I ordered basil chicken. The menu description for this dish didn't have one of the little red chili peppers next to it, indicating heat, nor did the description mention the presence of jalape√±os. There were so many jalape√±os that it was inedible for me. Hubby took it to go and ate it over the next few days. I should also mention...portions are enormous! We also ordered two mai-tais...several times, as we seemed unable to communicate this desire for drinks to our waitress. Unfortunately, when they finally arrived, they were undrinkable.

In the entrance of the restaurant are his books and the on-screen promotions feature him and the staff. The Exec Chef Anthony Sanders is known in the Atlanta food community and struck gold with his one. They are known for staying connected on social media and winning awards for BEST breakfast. \\nThe food speaks for itself! I met a fellow diner who was visiting from Augusta, but made it her business to stop in for the peach French toast. I enjoyed the salmon croquettes with grits and a huge cinnamon roll. Service was impeccable and super attentive considering the crowd and nearly 45 minute wait. I arrived at 10:30a, seated at 11:12a - lesson is to arrive early!\\nMy only feedback is that traffic in the restaurant is odd. The entry is small, there's a hostess who uses a tablet to put you on the list. Not to mention people going in/out for to-go orders by the kitchen.

I was a little worried about having to back out (and getting ticketed for parking there) but luckily all the surrounding cars had left by the time we were done with dinner. \\n\\nI had the plum wine to start which was too sweet for me. But everything else was perfect. We started with the Yum Woon Sen because I love glass noodles. When it came out, it looked like it was going to be bland because it was very clear and it didn't look like there was any sauce on it. I noticed that there was a puddle of sauce at the bottom of the bowl so I scooped an extra serving of that on my plate. Holy heat! I was NOT prepared for the amount of flavor and spice on this dish. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE spicy food and always gravitate straight toward the spicy dishes on any menu. But this thing needed more of a warning label with how spicy it was. My date was coughing after the first bite because he wasn't prepared for the heat level. Spiciness aside, it definitely had a lot of flavor and had those fresh, clean flavors of lime juice and fish sauce that I love in Thai salads. \\n\\nWe split the Bangkok pork and the red curry chicken as our main dishes. Thai curry is my absolute favorite thing about Thai food and their red curry is GOOD. There was tons of curry sauce to soak into the rice and the veggies were bright and crisp. The Bangkok pork was good, but it paled in comparison to the red curry. There was a ton of food between the two of us but it was just so good we couldn't stop eating and stuffed ourselves silly. \\n\\nThe service was great, if anything too attentive. The waiter came over a few times before we could even make up our minds. We told him how insanely spicy the Yum Woon Sen was and he just smiled at us and told us that it wasn't THAT spicy.

Not a big fan of running out of beer, especially when we're part of the early dinner crowd (this was between 6 and 615pm). \\n\\nSecond, the entire escapade with the Tony Rocco pizza. Originally they brought out just the Fig pizza and said they had screwed up the Tony Rocco, but another one was coming in just a minute. No big deal, we had the other want to eat while we awaited that one. \\n\\nHowever, once it got there, they had obviously been in such a rush to get it out to us that they didn't cook it all the way. When you bit into it, it was so raw you still felt the granular texture of the flour. So I asked them if they could pop it back into the oven for two minutes. They told me, no big deal. \\n\\nA couple minutes passed and our waitress came over to tell us that they, yet again, screwed up the pizza that they had just thrown in to heat up. I'm not entirely sure how they messed it up, but they did. \\n\\nAnyways... it finally came a few minutes later and was pretty good. The big misstep was in the middle of the pie. The other pizza wasn't like this, so I'm not sure why they struggled so much to figure this one out, but the center was almost see through it was so thin and was kind of soggy. \\n\\nThe taste of everything (aside from the center of the Tony Rocco pizza) was five star, no doubt. Price was decent, especially since it's set up for sharing amongst people.

The silverware is plastic, the napkins come from brown paper rolls on the table, and the pizza is served on big trays.  People share with strangers, stand and eat if there's no space, and everyone is so happy with their meals they don't mind the (now) long lines and slightly high prices.\\n\\nThe San Gennero is my favorite.

The service left nothing lacking either at the bar or at our table. There are 5 or 6 choices of chardonnay at decent prices as well as other wines, an array of cocktail choices, and lots of beer offerings.\\nWhen we sat down at our table we ordered 3 appetizers: Bang Bang shrimp, Ahi Tuna sashimi, and coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp are large, crunchy, and delicious. The Bang Bang shrimp are smaller and there are plenty of them - more than enough for our party of six, just spicy enough and wonderful. Again the tuna sashimi was more than plentiful, had 3 sauces, along with ginger and wasabi. The tuna itself was excellent.\\nOnce we finished appetizers, 3 of us were not that hungry and just got small bites, but the others had filet mignon, lamb chops (delicious and I'm coming back for them) and cod. Everyone enjoyed his or her meals. The vegetables were freshly cooked and not overdone. The bread is fantastic.\\nWe finished with creme brulee and coconut pie with rum sauce for the table. Both were great, especially the coconut pie.\\nSomeone is trying to get their act together at Bonefish. We had no complaints and will all go back.

I look around for a relaxed setting for evenings such as these, since I'm eager for the tension of tough labor negotiations to disappear.  This was on my way home, seemed warm and relaxing, and so appeared to fit the bill.\\n\\nThe place has a relaxed, warm, pub-like feel -- as you enter with the bar on your left and the dining room spread out on the right.  The place only seems to seat about 45 or so folks (at least in the room I saw -- perhaps there are other seating areas elsewhere).  The mood is relaxed, though the staff are everpresent and attentive.  I was immediately greeted at the door with a smile, asked where I'd like to sit, and promptly given a menu, water, and some bread with flavored olive oil.\\n\\nI had the salmon with asparagas and some kind of seasoned rice.  It and other entrees are very reasonably priced.  I asked to sample their Brown Ommegang Ale, which they had on tap.  They obliged with a small sampling glass.   It was the great Ommegang Abbey that I had grown very fond of -- so I had a pint of that as well with dinner.\\n\\nAfter a glitch with my first piece of slam, caused by a corn dressing with onions (when i had asked for a meal with no onions), I was brought out a second piece of salmon.  It was spectacular -- crisp on the outside, moist but not raw on the inside.  The rice was delicious.  The asparagas properly tender without being mushy.  Aside from an obsequious waitress who apologized 9 times for the onions in the corn topping, I had a marvelous meal.

With the tvs going, surprised they had music playing since this is a sports bar.  This bar is a few steps above your typical sports bars, thanks to the metered beer taps on the tables (no need to ask for a refill).  They do have a bonus room downstairs that my company has rented out before (pool table, darts) but not sure if it's still there.  Pardon me for not checking again.\\n\\nWe sat down and got queso dip for the appetizer.  The queso was great but the chips were semi greasy and the salsa was not anything spectacular.  My food, Jorge's Nachos, was massive.  For the price, you get a ton!  However, I was not thrilled with the taste.  Lackluster and average for nachos.\\n\\nOur service was stellar, especially for a group of 15.  Can't say I've had bad service yet here so that's a huge plus.  Parking is tricky, as you will have to utilize the parking deck across the street and I don't think they validate since this is smack downtown.\\n\\nOverall, great place for beer and atmosphere but the food isn't the greatest.

Instead of biting down through soft bread and then hitting a sweet spot of meat, you're instead left to tear and rip away the dry dough like a dog gnawing on a pig's ear. \\nThen what happens when you're busy doing that?

It's not uncommon to wait an hour for a table.  Once you're in there, the service can seem rushed (although the staff is helpful and entertaining), and they don't  encourage lingering, so it might not be the best place for a romantic date, but it's definitely lively and most importantly, the food is out of this world.  Their pasta is homemade, their sauces are excellent (also homemade) and they have fresh seafood and meats as well (although their menu is more seafood-oriented and I would recommend going that route if you like seafood).

They weren't willing to do anything to help us out.   All of their bread comes with an egg wash, and he was unwilling to offer us something without the egg wash.  We would have waited.  They didn't even have any of the delicious prepared vegan pastries they could get down the street at Whole Foods.  This seems outrageous to me, especially in a place like Austin.  I boost to my non-vegan friends that I've yet to run into this problem.  Even Cover 3 which is an upscale sports bar whipped up some vegan lettuce wraps for me one day.  So my friend and I left Sweetish Hill (forever), and went to The Steeping Room.

Finally, BBQ that wasn't miles away!  But having now been to Paulo's three times, well...overall it's unremarkable.\\n\\nTo be fair, most of the meat is \\"average to slightly above average\\".  Which is good since that's why BBQ places exist.  Portions are kind of weird.  I once ordered the pulled pork and got a huge portion.  The ribs seemed kind of small and anemic however.  Portion size seems really inconsistent.  But overall the meat is pretty good.\\n\\nThe side dishes are all pretty much forgettable.  They're all unusually bland.  I will say the hush puppies are quite good, but they're just screaming for some hot melted butter, or something to add some additional flavor.  Surely they can do better than this with the sides, no?\\n\\nPrices are a little on the high side considering portions and overall quality.  It's not super expensive or anything, but I've certainly had better BBQ for the same or less money.  I suppose I'd say that \\"value\\" is lacking here.\\n\\nService has always been friendly, if not a little confused at times.  \\n\\nAnd finally, my pet peeve: they don't have a website.  Come on guys...it's almost 2013.  To put up the time, money and effort to open a restaurant, but not think a website might be a good idea, is just bizarre.  I mean, even a computer novice can use a \\"what you see is what you get\\" website building service and create a decent looking website in under an hour, for less than $10/month.  It's not as if they'd need to spend $3,000 to create and maintain a website.  And aside from listing their menu (which is why I was looking for their website to begin with), a website could be a potentially good marketing vehicle, giving them a good opportunity to tell their story.  EVERY business has a story, and when told well, it can become a great marketing platform.  In this day and age, I see having a website as sort of a \\"duh\\" thing for restaurants, so Paulo's not having one just strikes me as profoundly odd.  If they plan on staying in business for more than 12 months, they might want to consider letting the world know they exist via a website.\\n\\nI'd give Paulo's 2 1/2 stars if Yelp would let me.  But since Yelp considers two stars to be \\"Meh, I've had better\\", then two stars it is.  I probably won't go here again unless I'm REALLY craving BBQ, and am feeling entirely too lazy to drive another five miles for better 'Q and sides.  If Paulo's would just tweak a few things (better sides, better value, having a website), the restaurant would be much better than it currently is."},{"name":"MAD Greens - Lakeway","address":"2011 Main St, Ste 400","city":"Lakeway","stars":"4","text":"I was very impressed with this establishment.

I have a droid phone here and I am scrolling through trying to find someone to call.  What is your name? (I give him my name).  I don't have it in this pile of lost things but that doesn't mean it isn't here.  Have you checked your bank account?  If you would like, I can take your name and phone number and call you back if we do have it?  You may just want to go ahead and cancel the card though.\\n\\nFor a place that serves pizza to drunk people until 3:00 a.m. and chains (yes - chains) the parmesan and red pepper to the counter, that was some pretty accommodating customer service.\\n\\nI've seen the Onion a million times, but I had never gone in until this SXSW.  It was late at night and while the line was long, it moved fast.  \\nAs I sat there eating my slice with pepperoni, sausage, and an assortment of vegetables I looked over and realized that all of the slices were the same price ($3.75 if I remember correctly).  Some quick mental calculus revealed a very important lesson - a plain old slice of cheese pizza is less of a value than slices with super-duper toppings.  \\n\\nBefore becoming obsessed with reading and thinking about food, I grew up eating cardboard pizza from the school cafeteria and enjoying more than my fair share of the low-priced store-brand frozen pizzas.  As a result, I like pizza in many forms, from thin crust to deep dish and from fancy to cardboard style.    \\n\\nThe Onion falls into my category of pizza that I will be pleased to eat if I am in the neighborhood.  It is not pizza for which I am going to go out of my way.  Don't get me wrong though - the Onion has some devoted fans.  In fact, I had SXSW guests who went out of their way to have pizza from the Onion on as many nights as possible.    \\n\\nWhile I find the crust to be more in the cardboard pizza category, the spicy sauce is pretty exciting.  In fact, as I was zooming down an alley on my bike headed toward Red River just after leaving the Onion, I could still feel a pleasant little burn in my mouth.  My SXSW visitors were pretty sauce-smitten too.  \\n\\nI recognize that some like it (as in the sauce) hot, and others not, so this is one that you're just going to have to try for yourself and see what you think."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"This is are fist time in Texas and the wife and I drove all the way from Huston just to eat here.

Great beer, unique vibe for the area, outdoor seating and a fun comfort-oriented food menu. I'm just tired of going here and the service being really, really bad.\\n\\nI've been here about 30 times. When I moved here, I was excited about being in the neighborhood and coming here a lot. Now that I've been here for a while, I have little to no interest in Lower Depths. It almost seems like the people working there revel in being a subpar bar.\\n\\nThere's one guy at Lower Depths capable of decent service. It's the guy pretty much everyone knows. The guy with the beard. He's not always warm and friendly at first, but in the end you're pretty happy with the experience. He knows his beer and takes care of you. Pretty much everyone else here makes me question why they're in the industry. \\n\\nRecently, I brought a large group over after a conference for an after party. We're talking 20+ people on a slow Tuesday night. There were 5-6 people in the Lower Depths when we got there. I talked up Lower Depths as my neighborhood spot that had great beer and a fun menu. I thought it would be a great place to bring everyone. The reception we got could be pleasantly described as frosty.\\n\\nWe ordered a few plates as appetizers, and when the nachos came out there was a pile of brown crap on top. Not pale olive, not off-green, straight brown.  Deep, deep brown through and through. I thought for a second that it was a pile of bad jalapenos. No, it was hours old guacamole. At best, it had been sitting in a container for four hours. Probably longer. I wouldn't be surprised if it had been prepared twelve hours earlier. The server came back, and I told her there was something wrong with the guac and asked if she could she bring a new plate. This was me being nice and giving her an out for serving a pile of disgusting brown shit. She instead took the low road and said, no joke, \\"What's wrong with it?\\". Really? Are you fucking kidding? I've got a pile of day old guac that looks like a deer shit and you're playing fucking games. That absurdly disgusting pile of rotted vegetables in front of me should be thrown out and you're negotiating like it's a subjective mishap. I didn't say that of course. I'm pretty damn friendly even when service is bad because I can't help being sympathetic with people who don't know what they're doing. The rest of the evening was like pulling teeth. My great idea of bringing people from my professional circles to \\"my neighborhood spot\\" ended up a huge disappointment.\\n\\nMore recently, I was there with three other people. Three just happens to be the number of times that the server interacted with us in any way. We were there for a little over an hour. We had service from our server THREE times. When we sat down, when we placed an order, and when we asked for our check. He was a fucking ghost otherwise. It's just so sad. I could see beardy guy, the only good server there, managing the bar and looking over at us looking around for our server and our server just being so incredibly incompetent, like he was wrapped up in a hipster daydream. \\n\\nUnfortunately, all of this happens all too often at Lower Depths. Great beer menu, great pretzels, great tots. Disinterested service, inconsistent food, and stony waitstaff make for an extremely... EXTREMELY disappointing experience. I really, really wish this was better. I live in the neighborhood and I can no longer take friends here."},{"name":"Daedalus Restaurant","address":"45 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"In terms of value for money this restaurant is superb.\\n\\nThe wait for the rooftop deck was at least 35 minutes, fortunately they could serve us dinner downstairs immediately.

At first we were a little hesistant as the dishes sounded similar but the taste were completely different. Importantly, both pieces of fish were cooked perfectly. The fish was moist and just tore away perfectly with a fork. Having just eaten at Atlantic Fish (and paid twice as much) our first response was why didn't we come here! The blackened haddock was rich in spice. We absolutely loved it. The beans and mango salsa were nice palette cleansers. The mango was firm and tangy.\\n\\nThe cajun spice special was much lighter in flavour but this allowed you to enjoy the perfectly cooked fish. They were generous with the mash potato (made with lots of cream and butter and pushed through a sieve so not a lump in sight). Again, the mash was so much better than the mash at Atlantic. The broccoli was yum (possibly too much butter for some) but hey you're eating at a restaurant. Of course it has much more salt, butter and cream than you would use at home - that is why it tastes so good. \\n\\nWines by the glass were pretty ordinary.

Nice juicy chunks of white chicken and prosciutto with a fantastic layer of quality melted mozzarella. The fettuccine Alfredo was tasty and well seasoned. Plus, there was a nice pool of Alfredo sauce underneath (am I the only one who thinks many places skimp on the sauce and it ends up being much drier than necessary?). The chicken marsala was nicely done, good flavor, with a pasta that had good texture. The bread was a little bland, but freshly baked. The gorgonzola salad was apparently tasty (I hate all stinky cheese, though). The tap water had a slight smell that turned off my daughter. The service was very good. I did like Buona Vita and had a wonderfully memorable meal back when. And the name Scugnizzi just sounds nasty compared to La Buona Vita.

Fortunately, I am quite familiar with Japanese food and know the good from the bad and the right from wrong pronunciations. Talking to the chef about everything from location down to their shari (sushi rice) preparation was reassuring and confirmed the chef's knowledge of their craft. I felt lucky to be able to feel the sushi with my hands and have refreshing gari to eat in between.\\n\\nAfter chatting with the chef a little bit about his preparations, it made sense that he's accommodating the taste of the locals here.  I get that. I respect that. And I'm in no place to complain about it. I could have used a little bit more of a subtle finishing to each piece as I felt they had a little bit too much soy sauce on it. The chef, I am assuming knows about this and again, is trying to accommodate the strong flavors of the local cuisine and what the people here like.

I decided not to order from the charcuterie-type menu because so many of the other items looked good too.\\n\\nFOOD:  I ended up trying the Arugula Salad, all 3 pastas (Spaghetti, Gnocci, and Pappardelle), the Butchers Cut, Brussels Sprouts, and 2 desserts (the Chocolate Torte and little black-pepper donut munchkin things -- I don't remember what they're called). The salad was tasty and generous -- I ordered it for myself but we ended up splitting it. The pastas were the only problematic thing because they might've had too much salt in the water. I started with the Spaghetti, which would've been fantastic but it was inedible (way too salty) to I sent it back and asked for the Pappardelle instead. Pappardelle was exactly the same -- way too salty -- so I sent that back too and ask them to just take the pasta off the bill (everything else was so good!). The water was probably too salty or something. Gnocci, which my friend had, was tasty and not too salty at all. The Butchers Cut, a rotating cut of pork, was just the right combination of meat and fat, and it came with accompaniments (pistachio, etc.) that complemented it very nicely. The Chocolate Torte was really interesting (though on the small side for the price), and the donuts -- which we didn't order but which they brought over because they felt badly about the pasta -- were light and flavorful (the hint of black pepper went nicely with the caramel dipping sauce, and they weren't greasy at all).\\n\\nSERVICE:  Friendly, prompt, and polite. When I sent the pasta back (which I hate doing), the manager came over immediately and apologized, etc., which really wasn't necessary at all but makes this place stand out as being a cut above.

We were actually planning to have brunch at First Watch next door but the line was so long we decided to go to Roccos Tacos instead next door! Its a good thing we went because there was no wait to get seated and we had a great meal! We were delighted to get comfy booth seating with a view of a pretty lake! Rocco's tacos restaurant is filled with really cool Mexican statues and wall art. We were happy to see that we got a free shot of tequila with yelp checkin to Roccos tacos! The tequila shot we got was more like a double or triple and was pretty strong so we got a margarita mix chaser and pretty much got a mini margarita! We ordered pulled pork and ground beef tacos and carne asada steak empanadas. The marinade on the ground see was the best of any mexican restaurant I've ever had and thats sating a lot because I've been to many Mexican restaurants. Usually the ground beef is very dry but this one was quite tender juicy and flavorful. The marinara sauce for the carne asada steak empanadas really complemented the Empanadas perfectly and was unlike any other sauce I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant! Hats off to our server who told us of some tips and tricks for ticket discounts and was very generous with our drink pours! Great service, great view, great decor, amazing marination and flavors! Can't wait to come back for more soon!"},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"ATMOSPHERE:  Modern yet rustic.  High ceilings and full glass windows makes the restaurant seem so open.  Everything about The Salty Pig also exhibits a personal touch, from the chalk drawings on the black pylons to the after-meal booklet handed out with the check that contains weeks of customer doodles.  Extremely clean too, crucial for their in-house charcuterie.  Very heartwarming and a great place for all occasions:  family lunches, birthdays, and ESPECIALLY dates!  5/5\\n\\nSERVICE:  Friendly and highly considerate.  The first time I came here I carried a big book with me and I was seated in the corner so I could be left alone.  Server checks in often but not too frequently, and he certainly knows how to keep our glasses full of water.  They know the menu well too, and are happy to talk about recommendations.  5/5\\n\\nPLATING:  This is without a doubt my favorite part.  The food in The Salty Pig is served on wooden paddles/cutting boards, which really expresses the theme of the restaurant.  Each lunchtime platter (I got The Domestic, a friend took The Salty Pig) is decorated with a smear of whole-grain mustard, a bunch of mild pickle slices, and slices of pork done in neat arrays or gorgeous piles surrounding a magnificent salad of greens and sweet herbs tossed in a light vinaigrette.  Also note that the portion sizes don't fill you up, but they are satisfying, which to me is absolutely perfect.  You also get slices of cheese, bread, and in some cases a small dish of olives.  The plates on the lunchtime menu really showcases the rich variety and deep thought that went into the food, and places a high emphasis on vibrant and savory elements that keeps your eye wandering and mouth salivating.  5/5\\n\\nFLAVOR:  The Salty Pig lives up to its name.  Each individual element is simple, and yet so well-crafted, from the house-made pork pate to the salami and cheese, and sitting down to one of the lunchtime specials makes you feel like you've been instantly transported to an Italian countryside.  Everything balances out:  salty fatty pork against crisp, vibrant salad, with tangy mustard and pickles against pungent cheese.  I would urge you to take everything in small bites, and to savor each element on its own before mingling with the others.  I had lunch here with an ex-navy dude and I had to keep urging him to slow down and really take in the quality (seamen have the worst eating habits).  My only complaint is the way they toast the bread:  it leaves a slight bitterness on the palate.  We also tried the Salty Pig Pizza, and each bite holds a wonderfully different flavor of cured pork, covered with fresh, sweet arugula, and drizzled with droplets of caramel to accentuate the sweetness of the pork.  Normally beef is my go-to meat, but The Salty Pig is beginning to change my mind.  5/5\\n\\nOVERALL:  The real brilliance of The Salty Pig is that despite how clearly well-planned and thought-out the menu is, the artisinal mastery of the food is well-hidden by the playful and casual d√©cor.  The minds behind the restaurant clearly could've gone for greater pretension, but instead they've decided to make a more personal, casual restaurant for everyone from urbane college kids to older professors, an excellent decision indeed.  In today's culture of convenience and packaged franchises, The Salty Pig brings in a more personal attitude, and a taste of the countryside planted right in the middle of Boston.  Everyone who visits the city HAS to visit this restaurant.  It's located right across the street from the Back Bay Orange Line T-station, so there's no excuse.  Be sure to come in before 2:30 or so on a weekday, since that's apparently the only opportunity you'll get to try the lunch menu I just described.  Perfect scores across the board!  5/5"},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've eaten here twice; once grabbing lunch during the week and once for brunch on a Sunday.

We had a wonderful meal: started with Mozzarella di Bufala e Pomodori, split the Bucatini alla Amatriciana, and shared the Bistecca. I don't recall our wine choice but our server, Andy, recommended it and he nailed it!  The food was photo worthy but we were both freezing and starving. It was amazing.\\n  \\nFast forward four months, and we are deciding where to have our final meal in Boston. It seemed appropriate to return to where our romance (with North End food) began. This time, we started with the Frittelle di Aragosta. Hubs went with the manly Pappardelle alla Bolognese and I opted for one (of only 3) menu item which has stayed on the menu since the restaurant opened, Raviolone Aperto. All were delicious, yet again. The Pappardelle won the prize though. Wow. \\n\\nBonus features of our most recent trip: We had the same waiter as the first time we were there - Hello again, Andy! With our mix of seafood/steak, we asked for his recommendation on wine and it was a show stopper. I must find this wine, Terrabianca Croce Riserva (Chianti) at home! We also splurged and got the Tiramisu for dessert. It is the best. EVER. I can't believe I waited until the last night in town to try it. Ah well... just another reason to head back to Boston!\\n\\nThe restaurant is charming and the place has a very nice feel. Giacomo's is like eating at Grandma's whereas Terramia is like eating at a fine dining establishment.

Whether it's a planned group dinner or a spontaneous stop after a walk, this place gets it right, always.\\n\\nI'll focus on my most recent visit: A group of about 12-15 of us went here for a friend's birthday. A reservation was made, of course, but the birthday girl really wanted to sit by the fireplace. Unfortunately it is first come, first serve -- we were told. However, upon arriving for dinner, we were all escorted back to the fireplace seating area where everything was ready for us. I don't know if this was planned and they always intended to give us this section or if it just sort of worked out, either way, the birthday girl was very pleased. Once we were seated and everyone was taken care of, the waitress actually made a point to ask if anyone in the group had food allergies! WHAT!? This never happens. As a foodie with a food allergy, I can tell you, tapas dining can be a bit difficult to navigate, especially with a large group. But they were completely and unbelievably accommodating to me and the other girl with food allergies. Not only would she tell us what we could and couldn't eat whenever a new dish came out, but if something came out that one (or both) of us couldn't eat, they would bring an alternate version that we could. Amazing! Never have I ever...we were just so blown away.\\n\\nThroughout the evening they continued to take such good care of us, so good in fact you start to feel like the only people in the whole place. Now that's service. I it's not just this last visit. It really is above and beyond every time. Without exxageration.  Every.

The menu was correspondingly broad -- smoked salmon, burgers, Caesar salad, with a few nods to EIre fare included like Shepherd's pie, beef stew with stout, bangers, and so forth.  Even with a reservation I was handed a beeper and waited in adjoining Irish gift shop to be summoned.  Incredibly noisy, dark.  I ordered risotto and server persuaded me to add scallops.  The three small scallops added a $10 surcharge to an $18 plate of rice and peas.  It didn't say so but there was garlic in it, too much, and the two cheeses were barely present.  My companion's beef stew was rated so-so.  Nothing bad but nothing to rave about.  Service was polite but indifferent.  Treated to some authentic Irish dancing (coming from Irish Dance Nationals earlier in the day, I can attest to the fact that these were very good dancers!).  Overall, a sort of canned experience in Disney fashion.  Food just okay and very pricey.  Lots of families with kids, strollers, and we had no desire to linger.  On a quiet night, if you're doing the Disney \\"thing\\", it could be fun. There was another band playing music outside on patio.

I used to brag about how awesome it is.   My in-laws from Iowa can't wait to come down every year a have some \\"LICK\\".  Unfortunately, the last time I visited, which happened to be April Fool's Day, 4-1-12; I was flabbergasted at the poor quality of the brisket and the ribs.  I give it a solid three stars, because most of my visits have been 5 star.  The last two have been spiraling downwards.  April Fools Day was a solid 2 star feat from \\"the Lick\\" and I am very disappointed.  I try not to be one of those Austinites/Central Texans that complains about the loss of charm and character due to the shear masses that have moved in and gentrified our area over the past few decades; but alas, I guess I am one of those.  I knew something was wrong when the original entrance had shifted and the lot was the size of a Sam's club.  It also took no time to be seated on a packed Sunday; which is weird to the \\"old Lickers\\", because we are used to waiting a little while with our BYOB to enjoy excellent BBQ.  The ribs were tiny and had no meat or flavor whatsoever.  The brisket was dry; then we requested \\"wet\\" or fatty brisket, and it was dry as well.  The sausage was excellent as always, but, come on, people want ribs and brisket at a BBQ joint; that's the draw, baby!  For out-of-towners or out-of-staters, this still may provide a pinnacle in your BBQ quest.  People from this area know that places like Llano, Luling, and Lockhart provide BBQ joints that can definitely equal or surpass the Salt Lick as it is now.

Although I'm not a huge fan of cured meats (I've always found them fatty, I learned from a toxicology that nitrates and nitrites are bad for you, and that salami often gives you a funny breath), the Salty Pig was the restaurant I was most excited about while planning my trip to Boston--it seemed to have an edgy originality and swanky classiness, and during my visit it exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nJust like any twentysomething tourist n00bie foodie wannabe who is rather clueless on gourmet cured meats and cheeses, we asked our server for recommendations, who was helpful in pointing out the popular no-fail items, offering detailed descriptions, describing portion sizes, and suggesting wine pairings.  This is the photogenic and memorable deliciousness we ended up with:\\n\\nProsciutto di Parma, ITA aged 16 Months ($8): These thin slices are so delicately complex, it almost puts bacon to shame.\\n\\nChimay a la Biere, Trappist, Belgium, cow, washed rind, soft & strong ($7): For some reason it tasted exactly as you would expect a \\"Chimay\\" to be, bold but nothing exotically bizarre.  (Yeah... I have a very limited and inaccurate jargon for describing cheese)\\n\\nSmoked Shallot Marmalade ($2): I know onion jam sounds strange, but it added a nice dimension, balancing savory with sweet.\\n\\nComplimentary charcuterie board items: I like the grainy mustard, and the pickles are good too.  The Crostini bread is mind-blowing... even though it's the type of crusty bread that's tougher to chew, the bite-size pieces are perfect, especially for putting everything on top (not entirely sure this is how you're supposed to eat high-end cured meats, but it is so delicious that I cannot describe it)\\n\\nMargherita Pizza, Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil ($13), + arugula ($1.5): I am usually not a big fan of margherita pizza because it's basic to the point of being boring, like the plain pizzas you used to get for lunch at elementary school.  But the pizzas here are pretty on point, with the fresh puffy crust and all, just like at Italian restaurants that claim authentic secret-family-recipe pizzas. The arugula was great on the pizza and partially disguised it to be along the healthy lines of a salad.  I'm sure adding the egg would have been delicious because that's what eggs do to everything, but we had already splurged enough for the night to warrant another topping.\\n\\nWe were classy and got zinfandel, but personally I think beer would have gone great with Salty Pig fare.\\n\\nThe ambiance was expected: to use the same words as I did above, it had indeed edgy originality and swanky classiness, rustic like BBQ but dressed up ultra fancy.

My problem with the place is that it just didn't seem to feel like a true \\"gourmet\\", high-end restaurant. The decor seemed a little thrown together with no warmth, no character or sophistication. The room was loud and noisy and not very comfortable with bare tables, heavy chairs and dull silverware. Remember, this is an expensive place - and if I'm parting with this level of cash, I really want the immersive experience.

Brunch every Sunday. It was friendly, chill, a big improvement over Precinct in terms of atmosphere, and the food was good.\\n\\nThen something changed. It was clear that Brass didn't want to be a neighborhood place anymore. My friend and I were walking in for the usual brunch when a frosty maitre d' stopped us, made us wait for a few minutes so she could be sure there was \\"space for us.\\" When we got in, the place was empty, but okay, we thought, maybe she's new. The service wasn't friendly anymore -- more like exasperated. Slow.\\n\\nDecided a couple weeks later to bring a bunch of people here for dinner and drinks. We had been looking for a new place to hang out, drink, and be pretentious academics. Called ahead just to be sure -- and was assured that they could handle 12-15 on a Tuesday night. We showed up that night, and management was PISSED. They again \\"weren't sure they could accommodate us\\" -- in the TOTALLY EMPTY DINING ROOM. I ended up talking to three levels of management before getting approved to sit down, each of which seemed upset that I'd brought in several hundred dollars of business on a slow night.\\n\\nIn the end, none of us from that crowd went back again, mainly because the people running Brass clearly didn't want us there. (Still don't understand why. We were polite, well-dressed people.) We still talk about how awkward the maitre d' and managers were. We had a good time, but Brass made sure our evening was uncomfortable, and we all knew it.\\n\\nThe food: pretentious but insipid. The cocktails: syrupy. At least they can't mess up the beer.\\n\\nBut that could all be forgiven, Brass, if you would just tell us: what do you think you are? A dive where you can watch the game? (Because you have a TV!)

I usually get (for lunch) either the Cubanito or the Chicken, both are very, very tasty, but I always add extra pickles and extra mustard to the Cubanito and I always add extra onions to the chicken. Another 'pro tip', their lunch specials end at 3 p.m. and I recommend you going around 2:30 because that's when their chicken tastes the best (it's been sitting in the juices and seasoning for a while). I have tried their empanadas which are good too. To be honest, I haven't tasted anything that I haven't liked with one minor exception. I ordered something (I don't remember the name) that was a large serving of rice with seafood, fried plantains mixed inside and we added the chorizo and something else for a small fee. It was a bit too salty for my taste, but not unbearable. If you want a dessert, try the Tres Leches, it's delicious.\\n\\nThe portions and availability has been hit and miss with these restaurant. There have been times when they were out of a drink for weeks (Malta), there have been times when I ordered their delicious Tres Leches cake and it was half the size of the portion I got the last visit (which was a huge difference). Of course I complained and was given a free Tres Leches cake on my next visit; although an inconvenience, it hasn't stopped me from going because their food really is excellent.\\n\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\n\\nThis is where they get huge credits! The place is very nice, like someone else said it is definitely a club wanting to be a restaurant (during the day), but the food is good enough that they can get away with it. Friday and Saturday nights between 7-9 they offer free Salsa lessons, however I stayed one night to see how that was and I wasn't very impressed; during the whole 2 hours of 'free salsa lessons' they only gave one lesson and the lesson was rushed and not very easy to learn from. I didn't take the lessons because I have taken professional salsa lessons which is why I am 'rating' their lessons.\\n\\nThe only downside for some people (not me) is that they usually have latin dance music playing (even during lunch) and it can be a bit loud sometimes, making conversation difficult. I personally enjoy the music, but if you like a quiet lunch, this may not be the place for you.\\n\\nService:\\n\\nThere have been issues with them running out of something or not being consistent with portions, but if I had a complaint they fixed it without question, each and every single time, so the 'service' is truly great. Carmen, Abel, Cruz and Sarah have all been great with customer service. The female manager has been very friendly and nice too.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nI only gave them a 4/5 because they tend to run out of things and they are not consistent with their portions. If they fixed these issues they would be a 5/5 without question!

It's macaroni with beef-veal-pork meatballs, fennel sausage, and shredded pork ribs with their \\"old fashioned Brooklyn tomato gravy.\\"\\n\\nThe noodles were perfectly cooked with a little bite to them (al dente).  The meatballs were delicious and moist, the fennel sausage was awesome, the pork ribs were tender and had a nice flavor and the sauce was really delicious.

Their prices are right on target.  My dinner cost me around $8.00 and I have leftovers for tomorrow.  It's also a great place to have lunch for those of you who work in the downtown area.  It's quick service.  You order at one end of the counter, pay at the register and pick up your food at the other end and then sit down at a table or get your food to go.\\n\\nThey also have weekly specials.

Its loud, there is a DJ booth, and plenty of people standing around your dinner table. Ive been here for lunch on a Sunday, which was nice and quiet, but the food lacks flavor and the drinks are weak. If you decide on a pitcher of margarita, expect a pitcher full of ice, and maybe 4 glasses of margarita. Don't forget the ice already that's in your glass. The tamales are a joke. I expected some corn husk wrapped goodness, but what I received was a heaping pile of bland shredded beef, covered in pickled red onions. Underneath the heaping pile of meat was the masa, and the husk underneath that. I was definitely confused as to what I was eating. It would have been much better if the meat was actually flavorful, but it unfortunately wasnt. The Sangria I had was watered down and the tacos were way too salty. The fresh made guacamole was good. I asked for super hot, but it was more mild for my taste. The price point is also way to high. I can honestly say Ive never spent more than 100 dollars on Mexican food until I went to Rocco's.

My boyfriend and I visited Craigie on Main for brunch yesterday morning.  It was very busy, but we considered ourselves lucky for snagging two seats at the bar for brunch.  Not so much.  The bartender provided a horrible customer service experience.  We were invisible to this man.  I had to get up and walk to the other side of the bar to ask for anything (water, the check, drinks he forgot about).  He spent most of the time looking at himself in the mirror behind the bar and obsessively shaking bloody Mary mix for minutes.  I'm not kidding.  It was crazy.  I kept looking at my boyfriend like, \\"Are we on candid camera?\\"  Now keep this in mind when I make my next comment: I am happy to pay more for smaller portions of good quality food.  I prefer to do that honestly.  However, the serving sizes at Craigie are absurd.  I ordered the 6.00 yogurt to start and was given a Dixie cup portion of yogurt with a few cashews on top.  It was insulting for the price.  The polenta dish was admittedly good, however, not even close to being worth 18.00.  If you're going to charge prices like this, the food must be out of this world and the customer service top rate.  Neither of which were the case.\\n\\nIf the bartender's service wasn't so poor, I probably would have given them 2.5-3 stars.

I really enjoyed the sweet glaze that they coated it with and it definitely separated itself from other restaurants. 4.5/5\\n\\nEntree:I ordered the special (bone-in New York strip). My expectation was that it should be held against steakhouses like Del Frisco. Typically, I get the Oscar style at del friscos (crab and a bearnaise sauce over the steak) which was also offered here, but chose against it for once. The steak came in sizzling hot, apparently their signature, soaked in butter, salt and pepper. Note: this is not the healthiest meal... I ordered my steak medium (cooked on the outside and a little pink in center). It definitely came out closer to the rare side. As the steak is a little thicker, I would recommend cutting through the center when you get your steak to make sure it is cooked to perfection. The steak could have been a little leaner but overall, I would have to say it is comparable to del friscos New York strip. Overall, the del friscos wagyu probably tops this but that is comparing apples to oranges in many ways. (To start, wagyu is $89 whereas this was $50/60). \\n\\nSides: lobster Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Lobster mac and cheese was pretty good. The lobster was not the greatest quality and the Mac and cheese was a little too basic for fine dining, but it was alright all things considered. The asparagus was fairly disappointing. It was overlooked, making it stringy and soft with little flavor. I would look towards another veggie if you're trying to add a healthy component to this meal. \\n\\nService: the service was fantastic. Waiter was kind and caring. Definitely seemed interested in making our experience the best possible. Came when necessary but wasn't a burden on the experience. \\n\\nOverall: apps, entree and service were fantastic, but sides left something to be desired. Definitely among one of the favorite spots.

I was actually pleasantly surprised and happy that there wasn't any vegan cheese in there and it was just a delicious blend of veggies stuffed inside. Bravo to you! I loved the feel of this place.

Lunch (in the past) has been great - they have some pretty delicious subs that come in 1/2 foot and foot long sizes. I have gotten eggplant parm and a chicken caprese styled sub in the past. They have both been very good.\\n\\nOnto dinner... My family and I went here the other night (May 2013). We were looking for a good meal but didn't make reservations anywhere so this was the only place that was ready to seat us right away.\\n\\nThe food was very tasty. I ordered a salmon with asparagus risotto and a lemon / citrus sauce. The risotto was some of the best I've ever had. The salmon was cooked well and had a decent amount of flavor. The issue I had was that the portion sizes were pretty small - I felt that my meal was more of an appetizer than an entree. With that said, however, I have had big meals (at other restaurants) with no flavor and I think I'd rather a small dish that tastes good. But it does leave you wanting more.\\n\\nThe prices are reasonable - $17 for salmon. The entrees come with a small salad which was a nice surprise. The restaurant itself is very casual which I enjoyed, but that's a personal preference. \\n\\nOverall, I give this place a 7 / 10. The pluses are good tasting food and a laid back atmosphere.

So my wife ordered the Greek Wings, and I ordered the Louisiana Sweet.  The selection of flavours was pretty good.  That much I will say.\\n\\nI was a bit surprised when both orders were served on one plate.  Not a big deal since I was planning to share with my wife, anyway.  So I let that one go.\\n\\nThe plan was that my wife and I would each have half of each flavour.  I choose the Louisiana Sweet because it was not supposed to be spicy.  I realized there would likely be a small kick to it, but that was no problem.\\n\\nSo imagine my surprise as the first wing grazed the tip of my tongue and I could literally feel a bead of sweat instantly form on my brow!  Wow, that's hot!  But I shrugged it off thinking that maybe the first bite just caught me a bit off guard.\\n\\nI tried to finish the first wing, but I soon realized I could feel a hole forming in the lining of my stomach as the spices were attempting to eat their way into my abdomen.  Something wasn't right.\\n\\nWe were with friends who had also ordered the Louisiana Sweet no more than 10 minutes before me.  Not wanting to be out-done by the ladies at my table, I was starting to get worried.  So I asked one of the girls if they'd try one of my wings to see if it was the same as theirs.  As the 3 girls passed the wing along the table, each one of them were very quick to acknowledge my fears were justified.  There was no way this was Louisiana sweet.\\n\\nSo I went to get our server, who also grabbed the manager.  It took my several minutes to convince them that the wings on my plate were not what I had ordered.  The manager was trying to tell me that I had the Louisiana sweet on my plate, but sometimes they just tastes spicier.  I wasn't buying it.\\n\\nThey finally took the wings back to the kitchen were it was discovered that I was, in fact, accidentally served some of their spiciest wings on the menu.  Surprise, surprise!\\n\\nThe excuse I was given is that the sauce bottle for the spicy and the Louisiana Sweet look the same.  Here's a tip for you, Wings... don't use bottles that can be mixed up.  If you were dealing with a customer with allergies or ulcers, you would have a big problem.\\n\\nNevertheless, they were quick to bring me my new wings, which were quite good.\\n\\nAnother point to remember, be sure to read the fine print if you go in for cheap wings.  Apparently you only qualify for cheap wings if you order a beverages.  So if you don't drink alcohol and can't have a soft drink, you're S.O.L.  Maybe that sounds weird to some people, but you'd be surprise at how many people don't drink booze or soft drinks.\\n\\nWhen time came for the bill, I was dealt another surprise... they still charged me full price for the wings that nearly gave my 1st degree burns on my mouth.  Maybe I'm old school, but in the restaurant biz, if an order gets screwed up, you usually want to comp the customer at least something to try an make up for the mistake... especially when you have already admitted to the error.\\n\\nSo I questioned the waitress, who again needed to get the manager.  I feel that some form of reimbursement was in order.  As I mentioned earlier, Wings saved themselves a star hear because the manager did take my wings off the bill (even though I'm not thrilled that I had to tell them to do it).  I don't feel I was being cheap.  I feel that I was giving them a lesson in proper customer service.\\n\\nSo there you have it.  Wings is OK.  Just read the fine print and make sure you get what you ordered."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great pub in the heart of Kenmore Square.

The food and drinks are pretty solid, decently priced (~$5 each), and I love the atmosphere.  With that said, the service REALLY needs work.  It takes quite a bit of time before someone acknowledges that you are waiting, as well as getting served and receiving your food.\\n\\nI had guests in town, so inquired about there Sunday brunch.  The server said \\"It's phenomenal\\"  Well, since I am the first review, I had to take her word for it.  So I called, was hung up on, called again, told that no one was available to take my call and left a message stating that I wanted to make reservations for brunch.  I was told I would get a call back to confirm, but that did not happen.  OK, no big deal, If they didn't have my reservations we would go somewhere else.\\n\\nSo Sunday comes around, we go in and we actually had a table for 4 reserved. Great start.  The brunch is $34.95 with all you can drink champagne and mimosas.  The Bloody Mary bar is extra.  I think $6 per Bloody Mary.  One thing to note is that the \\"buffet\\" is relatively small and contains some peel and eat shrimp, thawed out mini bagels, cheese a few dessert items, and a carving station that was not manned with cold meat.  You also get to order one item off of the menu (omelets, fish, chicken, etc)\\n\\nThe server came over took our order, and returned promptly with our drinks.  Well, 3 of us got our drinks, the unlucky fourth got her drink spilled on her..ouch!  The waitress apologized profusely, and proceeded to clean it up.  While it was funny, I was expecting a manager to come over and apologize.  Nope, not until 45 minutes later when I complained about how long it took for our food to come out.\\n\\nI get it, people make mistakes and spill drinks, but I would expect that this would be handled immediately.  When he finally came over he did comp us 2 of the 4 meals.  Great gesture, but this should have been done sooner.  I will definitely be back for happy hour, because, hey it's cheap, but will probably avoid brunch i the future.\\n\\n#Yelp100"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"At first, I thought the restaurant was crazy for having us order at front then sit everyone together at a big table.

There were two servers who were more concerned with chatting it up at the POS systems rather than checking on their tables.

My wife further commented, \\"Oh, this is not good\\".\\nDessert was better though. Especially because the wait staff brought out a cake to a table and sang happy birthday, to which the woman with the birthday promptly responded \\"Shut up Shut Up Shut Up\\", i really enjoyed that. \\nYour experience may vary, of course. I, however, would not recommend going here even if you were being held Hostage. I didn't bring any of these observations to the distinguished gentleman on duty because I'm happier just knowing I never have to go back.

Scratch serves incredibly fresh, creative, non-pretentious, and delicious food -- which happens to be gluten free. Bonus!\\n\\nFirst off, if you plan to go here, you'll need a reservation. We booked our table for early on a Friday night, and not long after we sat down (the place is small, and was still pretty empty), we heard one of the waiters tell a couple they would have to sit at the bar for dinner, as all the tables were reserved.\\n\\nWe started with triple cream brie with candied walnuts, cranberry, apple, and tarragon crisps. The wedge of brie was perfectly warmed, not too gooey, but still spreadable. The cooked cranberries were still whole, soft, and perfectly done. This was a delicious start to the meal -- note that it's not listed as an appetizer, but rather as \\"cheese,\\" right above the dessert section of the menu.\\n\\nFor dinner we each chose the roasted chicken, which was tremendous. Served on a homemade red sauce with paprika, basil, red pepper, onion, and garlic, with a side of broccoli rabe and what the chef described as \\"ricotta donuts,\\" (see below for more info on this little gem) this dish single-handedly erased my belief that restaurant chicken entrees are usually \\"throwaway\\" dishes. More, please!\\n\\nNow, to those ricotta donuts. Imagine, if you will, ricotta and parmesan cheeses, onions, egg, all swirled together and quick fried to create a piping-hot tiny torpedo of cheesy goodness. Holy mother of sides....dredging those puppies (and yeah, they are kinda like hush puppies, only not really....they're better) through the red sauce was divine. \\n\\nFor dessert we split the panna cotta with meyer lemon curd, pistacio mousse and ginger cookies. The taste was great, but I found the panna cotta to be a bit stiff...\\n\\nThe only beef (ha! punny) I have with Scratch is the way their menu describes their dishes. Take the roasted chicken -- here's how it's written up:: Roasted Chicken, Paprika, Basil, Red Pepper, Onion, Garlic, Ricotta, Parmesan, egg. \\n\\nIt's all there...it doesn't sound boring... but it doesn't do the dish justice at all. No reference to the ricotta donuts (how much does just that name make you want to order the dish?), or the fab red sauce? The only explanation I can think of for the overview-heavy terminology is that Scratch shops daily for their offerings, so perhaps the dishes change everso slightly?\\n\\nWhen the chef visited our table to thank us for coming (very nice touch!), he specifically asked what we thought about the donuts -- so I encouraged him to call them out on the menu. \\n\\nThis chef is talented, people --  the staff is polite, accommodating, and low-key friendly. The menu is a bit pricey, but hey, it's Lake O, something to be expected when you consider their rent is no doubt astronomical.\\n\\nSo get thee to Scratch and dive in -- so worth it!"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Hopped over here for a quick lunch.

My parents and I drove about 25-35 miles each way from our Austin location to sample bbq greatness. I ordered the all-u-can eat, 3-meat entree of pork ribs, sausage, and brisket. They were all very good. My parents ordered the beef ribs entree and 3-meat entree. They ate it up also and said that the beef ribs (I only was able to get a small sample from them so I have to order that the next time I'm here in October) were very good. GREAT BBQ. Potato salad was good, slaw was good/OK, and beans was mediocre. Sauce was sweet and tasty. I would give Salt Lick a 4 and half star rating if there was 1.

Mee-WOW-Lola was not only a delight, but a beautiful sight in a Carmen Miranda costume riding a float high atop a pile of  oversize fruit. (You can see her on several First Night Austin YouTube clips.) \\n\\nSimply said, Miss Kitty was hooked after that-and couldn't get to Lola's place fast enough. I wanted friends and family to come too. So 10 of us (6 adults plus 4 kids-aged 11, 8, 5 and 4) descended upon Lola's. I was thrilled everyone voted for the \\"Lola's experience\\" as I wasn't sure that the other family, very new to Austin, wanted a culinary adventure, but they enthusiastically agreed. I even told them it could be a long wait in a tiny place in a slightly funky part of town. The clincher was the fact that despite all that, I could promise them there would be great food. \\"Dad\\" wisely stopped by the liquor store and grabbed a six-pack of Red Hook ESB (worked perfectly with the Cajun food) and some wine, so that helped to pass the time while waiting for our dinner.  Brought some kiddie drinks and Goldfish to keep the kids from going bonkers, so we were prepared. \\n\\nWe also called Lola to make sure she could handle a party of 10. No problem, said she, we were \\"a gift\\" to her on a slow night. Mee-wow-you can't beat that for a welcome! And welcome we were-Lola greeted us at the door, kissed the kiddies, hugged us all then gave us the lowdown on what was available for dinner. There was plenty and we ordered something of everything. We settled in and Lola went into action. The kids enjoyed the fun decor and played with the crazy NOLA-meets-funkytown knickknacks. The adults chatted and dinner started to arrive-pretty much in batches of three at a time. No problem-everyone sampled and shared. FYI-Shrimp Po'Boys arrived first, then gumbo, pork chop dinners last. \\n\\nSeveral ordered the Shrimp Po'boy, including Miss Kitty...Mee-WOW! It was the BEST she has EVER eaten in all her nine lives. It was delicious with tiny fried strips of onion, crisp lettuce and a tasty sauce. There was an abundance of shrimp falling onto the platter-two could share (or take half home)--but this hungry kit ate the whole thing. The side of green beans (one side comes with) was excellent, home-style cooked and fresh. Other sides were equally praised-yams glazed and soft, red beans and rice and a very tasty cooked cabbage. I am decidedly not a cooked cabbage fan, but there was so much raving I tried a bite-and now I love cooked cabbage. Lola's cooked cabbage that is.\\n\\nOthers ordered the Gumbos-crawfish, and chicken and sausage-they ate every bite-loving it. And then there was the cornbread-perfectly crusty, sweet and tasty. The kids particularly enjoyed it, begging the adults for scraps. Meanwhile their \\"Tia\\" tried to figure out how it got that distinctive tasty crust (heat your oiled-or bacon greased-baking pan first, then pour in the batter) while she ate yet another piece. Lola kindly continued to bring out more and sent some home with \\"Tia Nina.\\" \\n\\nSadly, there was no catfish in-house that night-so we'll be going back soon for that. Now we know when we call to ask Lola exactly what items are available on a particular night. We lucked out in that she had plenty of a wide variety of things-except catfish. \\n\\nTen of us ate for $93 and some change. We left half again as many $$s in the spirit of Lola's remarkable weekly feeding of the homeless. Hopefully others do the same-Lola can always use the extra support.\\n\\nTowards the end of the meal, two film students interested in shooting a documentary about Lola came in. Lola's been there, done that, twice, actually, but said \\"Sure, why not.\\" She then proceeded to bring out a videotape of one of the documentaries and pop it in the VCR. It was a film about Lola's experience of putting her life back together after a flood left her homeless, along with scenes of her restaurant, and her every-Sunday meals for the homeless. I looked around the restaurant during a scene where Lola is pedaling along on her bicycle delivering food to hungry folks. Our happy crew,  tummies full of food cooked with lots o' soul, were entranced, and I saw tears welling up in more than one set of eyes.......Well, heck, this was more than just dinner. This was dinner and a movie........This was a moving experience. Yes, that's it. And the kids are still talking about it.  Okay, I'm picking up the phone......Lola?

From the charming owner discussing a little bit about the business and how they searched for their chef, to the chef that won't cook foods unless they are local, fresh, sustainable, to the bartender that makes such exotic and scrumptious cocktails, and to the server who will try to explain what the items are and treat you like royalty. \\n\\nI know all this because the owner came to our table and did just that. She then introduced us to the chef who promptly told us what's important to her about her cooking, or should I say - her art.  \\n\\nThe menu itself speaks in a word - authentic.  They have \\"Latin American\\" food - which does not mean rice and beans. This is cuisine, Argentina, yes Mexico, and other Latin American choices. \\n\\nI really did want one of everything and by the time I was through I might have had too much, yet still wanted more.  I started out with a pisco sour and that was how it began.  I'm drooling just writing this. We ordered an appetizer which was the Oyster Natural - 4 FAT local raw oysters with black hawaiian salt and small slices of peppers floating in a salty sauce for dipping.  Nectar of Gods of course.  I then ordered the Enchiladas with mole and asked for shrimp which is white wild shrimp from Mexico. The secret is in the details!  But.. but.. the mole, I'm not one of those that speaks about complexity or layers of flavor.  Maybe because I did not know where that might fit when explaining a dish. Found it!  The mole is just rich with cinammon and other spices, and of course chocolate.  This sauce's recipe has to have been conjured up only by a lover of her art, or maybe it's been passed on by family.  The tortillas are even something to discuss because they just blended in enough to not be distracting. I asked about them and of course she buys them locally made.  I had to try another drink and went with the Manzanita Agria.  I regret that I did not take a menu so I could give you the ingredients but trust me these cocktails are legit in a word.  Unique and different flavors with every choice we made. And finally, I just had to have dessert.  Doug chose the pannacotta guava and I, the Alfajores. The pannacotta guava is a unique mix of flavors and textures of fruit and flan with honey and nuts on top. The alfajores cookies were like shortbread with a sweet jam inside.  Just heavenly, and they even added their divine vanilla ice cream. Everything seemed to be done with such purpose and with such care.  I feel like I just walked into a dream here.  I don't know if you ever watched the movie \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\"  but that pretty much sums up the experience. Unusual, and a wonderful experience of the senses. \\n\\nFinally, yes they are in Gresham, and are like the diamond in the rough here. And at the same time, they are not in a \\"hole in the wall\\".  They took over a huge restaurant space and they should be buzzing with business if they could be appreciated for what they are.  They actually fit in this neighborhood because there is a huge Latin American base right here.  \\n\\nThey also have a special on Wednesdays  through August, where you can get 2 meals for the price of 1. Ask them which items. \\n\\nSo, take a walk on the wild side, a cat walk perhaps and indulge yourself here."},{"name":"Simplicity Wine & Eats","address":"4801 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow, perhaps some reviewers didn't read the sign outside.

FYI, we were served about twice as many for $3.95 than we were at J's for $6.50!  Next, they seem to have had a menu adjustment because the Croquettas that we had were crunchy crisp on the outside with a delicious and flavorful filing.  Nothing resembling \\"hush puppies\\" were found here.  We ordered the Manchego Cheese and a piece of Brie the size of a slice of pie...both for just $3.95.

Some nights, though, I know I need to get out of the house because otherwise I will lose my reputation as a gregarious gal. Then my friend, who reads my mind, will say, \\"Hey, I know we both want to sit around, but let's change it up. Let's go to Simplicity.\\"\\n\\nAt Simplicity, we do \\"get out\\" but we also get to sit on a couch and share a bottle wine. In some ways, we get to be even lazier there than if we stayed in. For one, we don't have to get off the couch and grab the hummus out of the frig and dump some chips into a bowl. Simplicity has delicious, strangely chunky, hummus and spinach-artichoke dip, also chunky, but in a good way because they are not skimping on the artichokes. The food has improved vastly since my visit a year ago.The second reason we can be lazier here is because someone else refills our glasses when they are empty. Well, most of the time this happens. One time our server never refilled our glasses; since our laziness had piqued, we grumbled about reaching over, picking up the bottle, and then straining to tilt it just right so that the wine went into our glasses. Sigh. Overall, the staff is attentive and nice, especially when they have few patrons. The music is great because it ranges the spectrum from classic rock to obscure electronic which may sound jarring but the noise level is perfect for catching unexpected songs.\\n\\nThe happy hour is from 4-7 and the starters are 1/2 off. They aren't generously portioned and sometimes the combinations are a bit odd; for example, cheese with fruit mixed in it. The drink specials seem as though they aren't that much; however, since the bottles and glasses are so moderately priced it is a nice bargain. Many bottles at full price are close to $20.

When you see a line pour out the door, it's bound to be somewhere reasonable to explore for lunch... It's the same at Umberto's and Chacarerro... Okay, so it's not as bad as the 45 minute wait at each of those places. The same owner with the same demeanor, pumping out food at his insane speed. I used to get falafel sandwiches with tabouli and hot sauce. The setting was just as sketchy, but the crowd is increasingly less-so. Now, working a few blocks away (and no longer a vegetarian), the food and service is just the same as it was. It's reasonably priced for what is offered. The line seems intimidating, but it's always quick. The plates are always loaded to the brim and more than a meal for many. The prices are reasonable and they do not skimp. I like the lamb more than the chicken dishes, the lamb a little more complementary to me for the tahini and rice. The chicken is tender and well-grilled / roasted, but not as strong for the complements. I've loved the grape leaves in particular, having just enough of a citrus kick. The food is extremely consistent and I've never had a bad meal here over the years.\\n\\nMy only issue is I wish the pitas were hot and fresh, like this one dark hole-in-the-wall in the Boonies of upstate NY I went to regularly in college, but for what they offer, Falafel King is a *filling* meal every time.

I then called and spoke to Walter, the manager who told me the only thing he would do is remake out meal if we drove all the way back. He told me there was no way he would compensate for the loss of our time or money on gas it would take to drive back because of their mistake, I began to get upset and Walter decided to hang up on me.

Of all the barbecue places I've been to here in Texas I think this is the one I would take visitors too. Granted it's not perfect in every aspect but it's the best all around barbecue place I've been too. \\n\\nThe pork ribs are great here. Very well flavored and good. As for the brisket, while it's tender and tasty, the smoke flavor was hardly detectable. So if you're hard core on lots of smoky flavor, the kind that fills your nostrils just from taking a bite, you'd probably rather go to Black's or Smitty's down in Lockhart. The sausage here was my favorite that I've tried so far and as for sides, hallelujah for real homemade potato salad and slaw!\\n\\nNow the potato salad is not what you would expect. It's got some kick and it isn't mayo based. It's more along the lines of warm potato salad, vinegar based, but it is delicious and it compliments the meat perfectly! The slaw had the unexpected addition of sesame seeds but it still fit in with the meal and I was scarfing it. \\n\\nI also loved the whole layout of the building with the wine cellars nearby, the grapevines around the property and the comfortable, open, rustic and casual dining area. Great experience and great food!\\n\\nOh I almost forgot. Get the cobbler while you're there. Honest to goodness cobbler - no crisp passed off as cobbler and no powdery cake mix blah sprinkled on top. Just melt in your mouth divine biscuit and fruit! We tried both blackberry and peach.

There is no reason to wait in line for any restaurant in the North End, there are plenty of Italian places. It seems this whole area just has been turned over to tourists (like us) anyway and we believed all the hype about this place. So after waiting in line for 45 minutes we were seated at a 2 top up against the wall, immediately another couple were seated next to us and our tables pushed together. A bit awkward. Then a young couple were told to sit at the counter behind us. That wasn't where they wanted to be but the server/hostess told them there or nowhere. So we were all just about sitting on top of each other at this point. It had been pleasant outside, but was hot and stuffy inside. There are no menus, it is written on a large board on the wall, not easy for me to read the whole thing as other heads were in the way. They obviously want you to order quickly, eat quickly and leave quickly and I felt rushed from the moment we sat down. Most people go for a seafood over linguini since that is most of the menu, but I chose Chicken Marsala. It was actually pretty good, but a tad too sweet. My husband got clams and linguini which he said was good. (everything is served over linguini, but they also have some ravioli). I asked for a glass of wine. You get to pick, \\"red or white. Merlot, cab, Chianti or Pinot\\" Who knows what it was. I got the Pinot and it was also a bit sweet, but ok especially since it was only $6. The second you put your fork down they are picking up your plate. Don't even think about asking for coffee or dessert, I don't think they serve either since they need your table. The prices for the regular entrees are around $15 to $17 and the portions are large so they get a star for that. They do offer 5 different sauces, but not a meatball or a meat ragu in sight. I really don't get what the appeal is here with so many other choices for a nice meal on this street. I guess decent food for a cheaper price than other places, but still no time to really enjoy your meal.

Tea Forte is overpriced even for drinking at home, so $2.50 for a cup is a bit outrageous especially when it's a large cup and you're only getting one sachet. Luckily I picked out an herbal tea so I let it steep all the way home to have something decent, but the English Breakfast I'd been eyeing would have been a disaster. The water temperature is also WAY too hot for green tea, so if you want a green, definitely ask to put the bag in there yourself or ask them to drop a couple ice cubes in the cup first.\\n\\nAs for the cupcake I tried...I'm glad I only tried one. I thought a Peach Ciroc cupcake sounded interesting, so I got it. The cake was horrible, it tasted stale if I didn't eat it with some icing. The icing was really the only thing with a flavor. I'm not even a big fan of icing, so it pains me to say they could use more on there...like I would hesitate to even call what they do a 25% frosting/75% cake ratio.

If you want to sit at a table, I strongly encourage you to make a reservation early.  If you want to sit at the bar, then try showing up a few minutes before opening (depending on the day).  \\n\\nTheir menu changes daily and every single ingredient comes from local farms... every, single, one.  They are also big on being environmentally friendly, so they encourage deliveries of produce to the restaurant by bike, etc.   \\n\\nAlthough the menu is always changing, you can count on their delicious hamburger to be available and for at least one amazing pork dish (they really love pork).  Let me emphasize this hamburger: Craigie's hamburger is without question the most delicious hamburger I have ever eaten in my entire life.  I recommend trying it out sometime at the bar.  \\n\\nI've been here for the tasting menu, and it blew me away.  I had the ultimate/extreme/top-of-the-line tasting menu with my fiancee and we were amazed at the beautiful flavors we experienced.  I could not contain my excitement the entire night.  Every plate was perfectly prepared and lived up to expectations.  Even the desserts were fabulously tasty and unique, and I'm not a dessert person!  \\n\\nA note about the tasting menu: Craigie generally does not provide wine pairings for their tasting menus, so you will need to choose the wines yourself or ask your waiter for help.  This did not appear to be an issue for my fiancee who generally always has wine with her tasting menus.\\n\\n\\nI haven't been to L'Esplalier or Menton yet, but Craigie definitely has beaten my experience at No. 9 Park (in case you were contemplating between the restaurants).\\n\\nDo your loved one a favor and take them to enjoy a tasting menu at Craigie.  Also do yourself a favor and add yourself to their mailing list so you can reserve a table for special events like the Mason-Dixon Line dinner (the James Beard best chef winner for the south east region will be cooking with Tony Maws)."},{"name":"Jimmy Hula's","address":"11556 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Food less than average -- we didn't finish it.

This is confusing because there were a couple of tables almost being done and there were only two tables of people in front of us. Odd overestimation of time? It only took us 15 minutes."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"3.5 stars.\\n\\nMy friend and I went to Antico for lunch today.  We ordered two San Gennaro pizzas so we could eat our fill and each bring some home to our respective spousal units.  It was really crowded, but we were able to find a spot at one of the kitchen tables.  Despite the large number of patrons, our pizza came out rather quickly.\\n\\nOne thing I noticed this time that I didn't notice on my first visit is that the staff seemed a bit...  surly.  I see reviews every now and then that refer to a Soup-Nazi-esque attitude at Antico, and I sort of see what they mean now.  The woman who took our orders just didn't seem too pleased to be dealing with us.\\n\\nMy pizza was pretty good.  I would have liked to see more buffalo mozzarella and I wish I had remembered that there is supposed to be garlic on the table, because I would have liked to add some garlicky goodness to my pizza.  But the sausage was yummy (I wish there could be a little more of it) and this time, my crust wasn't overly burnt like it was the last time I ate at Antico.  I understand that a nice char is good, but last time, my crust was black and the burning taste overpowered everything else a bit.\\n\\nThis time, my crust was fabulous and I could finally see why people rave about it - nice char, soft and moist on the inside.  Unfortunately, my friend's crust had the issue mine had last time.  I feel like it's really hit or miss as far as whether you get the perfect crust of your dreams or a crust that's blackened to the point of tasting unpleasant.\\n\\nThe other disappointment for me was that my pizza this time didn't have that wonderful moist and oily taste that my first Antico pizza had.  I don't know if the San Gennaro is just inherently less oily than the Margherita is, but I liked the oiliness.  It was like a beautiful, delicate, oily (but not heavy or greasy) sauce.  And this time, it just wasn't there.\\n\\nWe also ordered a regular cannoli each.  I didn't get to eat mine until 5 or 6 hours later because I took it back to the office with me, thinking I'd eat it as a snack.  Unfortunately, I had the craziest Friday in the office that I've had in many months, and I ended up eating it at 7 pm after I finally made it home from work.  It was still yummy.\\n\\nOn my two visits to Antico, I've definitely seen some of the elements that make everyone here on Yelp bow down to the pizza deities when they eat here.  But on each occasion, I've also seen enough flaws to prevent it from being the pizza perfection that most everyone describes.\\n\\nSometimes I wonder what Kool-Aid everyone is drinking on the way in the door to make them freak out about this place.  And why the heck aren't they sharing it with me?\\n\\nI'll probably be back because I really still want to try the Diavaola.  But I still just don't quite get it.  I'm not the type that believes that Domino's or Papa John's is real pizza.  I'm just not as wowed as I'd expect to be given all the glowing reviews.\\n\\nCome on, Antico...  make me a believer."},{"name":"Coco Cabana","address":"4073 Lavista Rd, Ste 323","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"Everything here is delicious!!!

Came for lunch on a cold day, and they offered indoor and outdoor seating with heaters. Service was prompt and we only waited 10 minutes for a 2 person table on a very busy day. I have no complaints about the service, it was the food I wasn't a fan of. We both ordered lunch salads, which were served (not kidding) on half of the plate. The other half of hubby's plate had tortilla chips, the other half of my plate had nothing. Why not make a full-sized salad? I have been to American eateries before that kill it at lunch salads, and this place really didn't. We weren't really full, so decided to order a belgian waffle for dessert. The entire thing was crunchy, like a cracker. At first bite I thought it was supposed to be that way, but after consulting hubby we both agreed it was overdone and likely should have been served soft if it was done correctly. Got out the door for $34 for two people, with food we weren't really stoked on. It's a bummer because I really wanted to like this place - lively vibe, good menu choices, bright atmosphere, and could have been a hidden gem.

They are actually nice when you order over the phone too and make the food really quick for take out. The inside has 2-3 tables too if you want to grab a slice and take a seat.

First off, I love Papa John's pizza, but this specific franchise provides horrible service.\\n\\nThey initially messed up my order, causing my friends and me to wait over two hours for the food, with the end result being that the pizza was NEVER even delivered. I called the manager, and he assured me one free large pizza the next time I ordered to compensate for the mess-up.\\n\\nTonight (a few weeks later), I decided to claim the free pizza. I talked to the same manager, and he said he would honor the aforementioned deal. I placed the order at around 7:20 pm. By the time it was 8:30 pm, the pizza still had not been delivered, and I called the SAME manager. He outright DENIED that I had placed any kind of order that night, and that there was no record of there being an order placed from my phone, even though I had literally spoken to him one hour earlier. I asked if I could place another order and receive the free pizza, and he said no and rejected my order.\\n\\nOverall, this particular location has no etiquette, manners, or respect for their customers, especially the manager. The manager seems to believe he can deceive college students (I am a student at UT Austin) and get away with it.

Ok well I have never had this happen at a hibachi place so not sure what he was referring to. Gas poisoning your customers is not normal so not sure what he was talking about.

First thing i ever had from Rocco's was the Combo Mocajete (chicken, steak, chorizo and shrimp!), think that's what it was called. its was big, delicious, and filling and came with the tortillas and fixings on the side. Although it did cost a good $24 it was almost worth it.

All served the same, on a flour or corn tortilla, with lettuce diced tomatoes and cochita cheese (looks like really fine feta but taste kinda bland like its not really there). My favorite had to be the Steak tacos, which are made with skirt steak, YUM. The pork taco was ok, chicken was ok kinda dry, and the shrimp was probably my 2nd favorite. If it was up to me i would keep ordering the steak tacos just to eat the meat part because the tacos as a whole aren't all that to be honest. I've definitely had better. The steak was clearly the best part of the tacos. The tacos came out 3 at a time, i think i had 3 orders total.

The taste is off. Things are more mushy. Blanders. Dryer. More burnt. Perhaps different chefs, different recipes, perhaps... reason #1 is more important = customer service. \\n\\nSo they always did good food for the most part. People were nice, expedient, smile, helpful. It's been a busy joint. \\n\\nBut they know me. We know them, by name. It was a homey comfortable place... until they tried to kill my mom. Reason #2.\\n\\nYou see my mom is a WORLD traveler. My mom is a global survivor - in third world trekking, trips, places without the bounty we have in America. Places that smile that don't speak english. Places where it might be dog, not chicken. Oh, and my mom also WORKS IN A THAI restaurant. \\n\\nCatch is... She has food allergies and has printed laminated cards to give to the waiter/chef/owner which are very straight forward. No peanuts. \\n\\nWe politely ask, discuss, confirm, reconfirm, they go to the kitchen, ask, double check, come back and assure us they won't put any on. They owners comes of to say no problem. The chef comes out to triple check. \\n\\nThey send the food to the table covered in peanuts and give her back her \\"no peanuts\\" laminated cards (which are also written / translated in numerous languages).  Did I mention, my mom is a WORLD traveler. My mom WORKS IN A THAI restaurant?  \\n\\nSo for 3 people/employees - waiter, owners, and chef - to all make this one little mistake... it's, bottomline, UNACCEPTABLE. Because, WHY? you ask.

You can definitely see the influence Eastern Standard had on Tom, the beverage manager, and he brings that style to a completely new level in my opinion.\\n\\nThe greatness of the bar actually made me a bit wary of the dining experience because I feared it would be downhill from there. Much to my surprise, I was wrong. Given the excellent price we both decided to get the three course prix fixe meal. At $75 for an amuse bouche, first course, entree, and dessert paired with a dessert wine this is probably one of the best deals I've seen. \\n\\nI started my meal with the sweetbreads -- something I had been dying to try -- and I was not disappointed. The texture was buttery and melted in my mouth. It was also seasoned very well. My boyfriend decided on a salad made of greens, mushrooms, and an egg on top. Separately these are not things he is really wild about but together he loved them. Before I could even get a taste it was gone! The bread was plentiful and our water was never empty. \\n\\nFor my meal I decided on the Hangar Steak √† la Po√™le and was blown away. The only hitch in the meal was that the puree was maybe a little to earthy in taste for me. The boy got pork two ways and enjoyed both of them though he does think he will get the chicken next time. \\n\\nFor dessert I decided on the Gingerbread Pain Perdu and he ordered the Peanut Butter Parfait. Both were well prepared and presented and enjoyable. The ice cream that went along with mine was absolutely delicious. Both wine pairings were perfect. \\n\\nI went there expecting it to be another run of the mill stuffy, snobbish, fancy restaurant and pleasantly found out I was wrong. The waitstaff was knowledgeable but not preachy and very attentive. There were varying levels of dress; from extremely dressed up to Friday business casual (jeans and a nice shirt). Both the bar and dining sections were hopping but there was a definite difference between noise levels which was great. In the bar you can be in a \\"bar scene\\" and once you are in the restaurant it's dining at it's best -- not too quiet or too loud; enough noise where you do not feel like you are offending others by talking to who you are with but not so loud that you need to shout to be heard. \\n\\nTheir menus are printed at the latest possible moment and all the ingredients are fresh from that day.

Let me start by saying this was pre-planned stop on our Texas escapade driving from San Antonio to Austin. Once you exit the major highway you're just kind of driving in the middle of nowhere to get to Driftwood where Salt Lick is located. Thankfully when we arrived there was no line and seated immediately, contrary to the other reviews which insists to anticipate a wait. We came on  Friday around noon time, which might be a better  timing compared to the weekend or even Monday? So the actual restaurant is a sit down where a server comes to your table, I was expecting something a little different. The building itself was an outdoorsy wooden type, very appropriate for a Texas BBQ joint. And upon walking in, right behind the host is the infamous grill with the sausage hanging and ribs- this is definitely a site to see which makes you think you're in meat heaven aka picture opportunity for any foodie.\\n\\nOnto the food, we ordered brisket (lean), sausage and ribs (pork). I know Texans live for this stuff and BBQ here is practically its own religion but I did not feel like the brisket or ribs lived up to the hype. Maybe my taste buds are indifferent since I'm Asian American from the west coast? But I think I can differ what's good and just acceptable. I honestly think my dad's ribs and brisket from his traeger tasted better. Although maybe we ordered the wrong items, especially since we had the lean brisket with hardly any end parts. Our sides were potato salad and beans which were nothing spectacular either. I do recommend the single severing size for a party less than 4 because the portions are pretty big and I'm sure you would rather eat more meat. If everything else failed, the sausage saved Salt Lick. They were tasty and the casing added the perfect snap in each bite.\\n\\nOverall it was a good bucket list restaurant to try and experience. However, as mentioned in my review the food did fall short. Prices were on the cheaper side and service was prompt and friendly.

Its a small place so be ready to be squished while your eating (not a great place to have a date), and be ready to wait a very... long time. The wine bottles are very well priced .. $20.. im normally cannot find that at any restaurant where I live unless its happy hour. We got the calamari which was well crisped and very fresh. We ordered the garlic bread but it never came. Honestly, I don't think this place exactly cares about what kind of service they give. They know they will get business either way. They are very sarcastic and can be somewhat rude- but their food is good so it won't stop me from going there . I ordered the half lobster with mussels and clams and linguine special. WOW so good !!! The sauce was amazing too, and for $22 you really can't beat it ! All the seafood was super fresh. The only bad part was they didn't crack open the lobster and it was soooo difficult to try to crack after its been drenched in the pasta sauce.

We reserved a table for 12, which included its own TV and two taps of beer. Mind you, you can't choose what taps you get or whether or not they will work properly- Ours (420 and Stella) decided to produce foam all night so we ended up having to order from our waitress. This would have been a major bummer if it wasn't for two great aspects of their costumer service- our waitress never left us thirsty (and this was super bowl, so she gets double kudos) and the manager came to apologize and comp us for the 40 oz of foamy beer we had tried to consume before giving up. So definitely a win concerning costumer service (thus the 4 star as opposed to the three, which I would otherwise give this establishment). They were also offering a limited menu due to the game but what we ordered was pretty good- nothing revolutionary, but solidly executed bar food staples such as buffalo wings (12 for $10) and nachos (huge plate, around $10 also). Others ordered entrees such as sirloin tips or fish and that looked good too. I was super happy to see desserts on the menu so ordered a brownie to celebrate. Once the game ended they started rocking out some top 40 songs so I am guessing this becomes a little bit of a club after hours.

Luce is just the perfectly judiciously mixed tincture of delicate and spice, careful and whimsy--and those pleasant surprises are all served in a space that is charming as it is intimate and practical. The unfussy storefront serves as a perfect backdrop to showcase the simple sophistication coming from the kitchen.\\n\\nMy friend and I shared a few dishes--a salad, two pastas, the hanger steak, cabbage, and the semifreddo. The escarole salad with bagna cauda was simple and outstanding: garlicky dressing over crunchy and warm escarole. The bitterness of the escarole was challenged by the garlic and butter of the bagna cauda. Delicious! We had initially resisted the temptation of house-made focaccia, but upon lapping up our pastas, found that the spongy bread came in handy to soak up all the delicious sauces at the bottom of the bowl. The hanger steak was perfectly sized--a rich, herby take on steak. It was a fantastic steak flavour--and tenderly cooked, it arrived hot and juicy and oozing with rosemary and a touch of sea salt.\\n\\nFor desert we had the semifreddo which was a refreshing finish to what was, undoubtedly, a flawless meal. Much drama has been made about Andrew Knowlton's listing Luce among America's best in Bon Appetit. I'd have to agree; having eaten at others, I'd say Luce comfortably and capably holds its own as an unassuming, confident star among the very best in food this year."},{"name":"Volare Restaurant and Bar","address":"388 Broadway","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely fantastic place.

At Panera, I can have 2 customers in front of me, and it still takes 5 minutes to get up to the register.\\n\\nSome of the issue is Panera's habit of having one register open while twelve people wait in line, and some of it is that their cashiers act as if they are contractually bound to making sure that every single transaction comes with a 30-second explanation of the Panera club card, and how they can fill it out or register online, or yada yada. \\n\\nI have a Panera card.

All were great.\\n\\n2. Appetizers were several of the house-made donuts and the granola and house-made yogurt. The yogurt and granola was good, but didn't knock my socks off.

I only had a bit, but the veggies were awesome and the eggs were ridiculously creamy.\\n\\n4. My friend got the beef cheek and tongue hash. An egg an crispy onions completed the dish, and from what I could tell by my single bite, it was delicious. The cheek and tongue were melt-in-your-mouth tender.\\n\\n5. My dish... oh my... my dish was the shrimp and hominy. On the menu it's scallops and crab, but mine was rock shrimp instead. The hominy is from Anson Mills and in itself is a nearly transcendent experience. The shrimp were plump, plentiful, and delicious. The egg was perfectly runny. The red chili broth/sauce was super flavorful with just enough spice, and the radishes offered a nice textural changeup. To make a relatable comparison, this dish was the best pozole I've ever eaten, but with shrimp instead of pork. It. Was. Insane. If it's available, you need to order it.\\n\\nThe legends are true.

A common blunder in some of these northern places is the so-called \\"salsa\\" that is mainly liquid. I have noticed this in other Mexican restaurants in the Arlington area too. Acitron serves the most watered down salsa I have ever seen. The red liquid served in a small bowl barely had two pieces of diced tomato in it, total. On top of that, they served round Tostitas tortilla chips, the kind from the grocery store. Mexican food usually features the tortilla prominently in native dishes. How can you not serve homemade tortilla chips? How can you serve obviously store-bought, factory manufactured fluff? Why not just plop down a bag of Fritos?\\n\\nThe chicken enchiladas were nicely constructed, but they lacked seasoning. I could tell the chicken had not been seasoned when it was cooked and you noticed how bland it was immediately.\\n\\nThe taco appetizers were odd. They were supposed to be pork tacos, but one had mushrooms instead of pork. They actually tasted pretty good. However, I ordered a different taco dish as my entree and it was the same pork taco they had as the appetizer. The waiter might have mentioned that. Perhaps the cook just wasn't thinking. The pork tacos were nicely seasoned. They were served with a side garnish of pickled onion slices, which I found strange. Overall they were good to eat, but nothing to write home about. Mexican tacos are usually served with fresh cilantro garnish and lime wedges.\\n\\nThe service was friendly. The refried beans were excellent. The side request of habanero chile sauce had nice heat. The rice was white and bland. It lacked the traditional onions, carrots, and tomato paste in the background. It was just dull. The Mexican music that was playing was actually the most authentic aspect of the experience. I am still looking for a really good Mexican restaurant in the Boston area. Whenever a restaurant describes itself as \\"fusion,\\" it seems anything goes. I have been to a Mexican/Cajun fusion restaurant the was off the mark too. I am not sure what the strategy of this restaurant is.\\n\\nThe name of this one, \\"Mexican Bistro,\\" should have been a tip off. Who ever heard of a Mexican Bistro anyway?

Our waitress did not explain the specials without being asked, didn't refill water glasses, didn't check if we wanted a refill on our beer and other drinks, and was nonexistent through most of the meal, so needing actual sauce for the kids' meals or drink refills was hard to manage. Actually, the host who finally sat us was MUCH more welcoming and helpful than our waitress.\\n\\nI will reiterate: the show was great. The dancers were super-sweet to our kids and invited them to dance with them after the show, and gave them stickers and signed sheets that they danced at Raglan Road, which was really nice. We definitely appreciated that touch and that's actually where a lot of the stars are coming from. But if I went back?

When you walk in, it's tough to find someone to give your name to when the restaurant is on a wait for seating (and they usually are). You have to hunt someone down in order to get your name on the list. Then when you are seated, the service is very slow and sometimes non-existent.

I have been in the industry for a while and I find this disrespectful and not showing great character.\\n\\nI may give Daedalus another shot, but the chances are unlikely."},{"name":"Maria's Pastry Shop","address":"46 Cross St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I've had Mike's Pastry before and thought they were pretty good (a little on the sweet side). My friend came to visit from L.A. and told me she had to try Maria's. So we ventured out towards the North End and found this amazing pastry shop. I was not sure how great of a place it would be seeing how it does not look like a pastry shop from the outside. When we entered, I was a little intimated by the woman behind the counter. Still, she recommended us some pastries, and (*Janice's voice) OH MY GOD. Everything was SO incredibly delicious. We ended up sharing a lobster tail with vanilla custard, 2 cannolis, and 2 cakes (banana chocolate and rum). \\n\\nThe lobster tail was so flaky and crispy while the vanilla custard was so smooth and sweet (not too sweet though). The powdered sugar on top makes you look like you've been dipping into white snow, but still, so so so good. \\n\\nThe cannolis were fantastic, great crunch, chocolate was not overly sweet, and just melt in your mouth amazing. We tried both the ricotta and chocolate fillings for the cannolis. Get them. You won't regret it.\\n\\nThe cakes were great (even after 2 days in the fridge). I love how they are not just sugar. Instead, you can taste the rum mixed into the fluffy cake.

Quite literally! To think this was just a blank warehouse canvas just a few years ago and now, it's amazing what they've done with the space.\\n\\nHonestly, I've been following the opening of The Brewer's Table since it was announced 2 years ago. \\n\\nThe concept is quite clutch - zero waste restaurant where they use the barley, malt, hops, yeast left over from the brewing process and incorporate these elements into their dishes. Additionally, if you do any of the feasts, they give you the entire chicken or fish for the table (meant to be shared between 2 and 3 people).\\n\\nThey've got quite an extensive menu of cocktails and brews. I was thrilled to see a Dry Rose on draft! The beers they're brewing will be ready starting in June, so just hang on if you're going especially for those. They do have a tremendous selection of Craft beers from other well-known breweries both local to Austin and around the country.\\n\\nWe started with the Preserved Artichoke Dip and Spring Pea and Barley Salad. I enjoyed both of them as they were light and flavorful and a fantastic start to warming up our taste buds.\\n\\nWe shared the Ranch feast - it's a whole roasted chicken that comes with the 3 sides on the menu that day. We had the roasted brussels and blackberries, stewed beans and peas, and the charred sourdough panzanella. \\n\\nThe roasted brussels were a hit at the table! The blackberries in there are hardly noticeable but they give the dish a perfect bit of tartness which paired well with the spice from the serranos. \\n\\nWe ended up dipping our chicken in the stewed beans instead of the black garlic jus because it actually married well with the chicken. \\n\\nDon't get my wrong though - the chicken by itself was extremely juicy and well-marinated with the herbs and other magical ingredients they used. It truly was delicious and we talked about the flavor of the chicken the entire meal!\\n\\nOverall, I'm thrilled they're open and will definitely go back! I'm interested in their happy hour and lunch! And they have a spectacular covered patio.\\n\\nCongrats on your restaurant, The Brewer's Table!

This time she was more pleasant, looked at me even, and offered cheese and peppers as she got out napkins and a bag for the food. She thanked me for coming in and I took off back to work. \\nThe breadsticks were perfect, just what I remembered, and the sauce was just right, seems it's a better choice than the other chain places because they actually heat it and put it in a tub instead of just giving you a prepacked container. Pizza was very good but greasy, more so than usual but still tasty.

Their location across from Brighton Music Hall is great, especially if you want to pop in for a bite before a show. Location is a bit small and they're strictly cash only so remember to hit the ATM or get cashback before coming in. I had a Sapporo and a miso ramen. Both were okay. Not a fan of the metal cups that they serve the Sapporo in as it gives the beer a funny taste, made me wish I had just stuck with water. \\n\\nPork bun starter tasted fine as did the ramen but there was no magic to either of them. Get some hot pepper sauce on the side if you order anything that doesn't come with it automatically. Food is very under-seasoned and bland so hot sauce at least gives their food a little kick.

Sadly, we were too tired to spend an entire evening out, but we had the chance to eat at Daedalus. We read some mixed reviews on Yelp, but loved the idea of the roof top outdoor eating. \\n\\nWe arrived around 9pm so the dinner rush was clearly over. We were immediately seated. I only got to glance at the downstairs bar, but it looked like a slightly fancier neighborhood pub. Pretty cool and laid back. We then went upstairs and saw the lounge area... very cool. Seems like a place I would like to hang out... a bit more \\"posh\\", but not too over the top. \\n\\nWe then were seated on the outside rooftop. I liked it... VERY cool spot for a date... or having a nice dinner with a friend. my co-workers are slightly older and had a harder time reading the menus because of the dimly lit dining area... but nothing a little light from my cell phone couldn't fix.\\n\\nOK... let's get down to the meal... I ordered the pan seared scallops... the dish came out and had a somewhat nice presentation, but it also did look a bit sloppy. It didn't seem like the chef took the time to dress it up at all. As for the taste, the scallops were good... not great, but good. The cream sauce added a little bit of zing, but not too much that you lost the flavor of the scallop.\\n\\nThe risotto was pretty darn tasty. I'm used to a thicker risotto, but what are you going to do? It tasted great... no need to add salt or pepper.\\n\\nI ordered my staple \\"Bacardi and Diet\\" and it was great. I've been to so many places as of late that has watered down drinks. This was nice and had some kick. I then ordered another drink... \\"On the(I forget the name)\\".... not good at all... it sounded good, but tasted more like an espresso vodka drink or some kind. I still drank it though... I don't want to be accused of alcohol abuse. =P\\n\\nAll in all, I really liked the restaurant. It seemed perfect for college life... not too pretencious, and had just the right amount of character. \\n\\nI'd recommend it if you were going out on a date... good times!!!!"},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have been to the Charlotte NC location alot over the years and loved that location, we moved to Atlanta and decided to give them a try.

Bacon -- If it's not crispy, I won't eat it. So I always ask for extra crispy bacon and this is literally the only breakfast place where they know what EXTRA CRISPY means.\\n\\n3. Scrambled Eggs with Cheddar -- They know what it means to add cheddar cheese to their scrambled eggs. I don't have to hunt for the cheese I'm paying extra for. And, their eggs feel/taste like real eggs.\\n\\n4. Fresh Fruit -- It's usually an assortment of melon, grapes, and maybe strawberries.\\n\\n5. Breakfast Potatoes -- This one's iffy.  It depends on who your server is, so even now, I honestly don't know if this meal is supposed to come with the potatoes or not.

They're so yummy.\\n\\n*The only reason I'm not giving this place a full 5 is because of their coffee. I'm not a Starbucks junkie, I never go there actually, but I do know what a nice fresh quality cup of REAL coffee tastes like.  Their coffee is basically just brown-tinted water.

The food is always amazing and satisfying. Today I had an experience with customer service/ management that left much to be desired. In fact it left me extremely uncomfortable and I will probably never set foot in there again. A non issue was blown out of proportion by management and long story short the female manager or owner was extremely rude, embarrassing and treats her customers with the utmost disrespect. I ordered 2 sweet potato biscuits as a side not realizing it came with bacon and egg. As my waitress was confirming my order she asked if I wanted all the ingredients on there. I didn't realize she was referring to the biscuits because she didn't say biscuit and I assumed it was a plain biscuit. A mistake on my part and her part. I assumed she was referring to the chicken curry soup that I ordered and so I said of course I want all the ingredients. Its my favorite soup afterall. Shocked that the biscuits arrived with all kinds of stuff on it I told the server I just wanted the plain biscuit. Realizing there was a misunderstanding: Without incident I was quickly brought 2 plain biscuits no questions asked. Service was great the food was great. 5 minutes into me and my sister enjoying our meals the manager approaches our table literally in a huff and all sorts of attitude on her face. First she slammed both hands on our table and leaned in with a very serious and aggressive demeanor.  She questioned me in a very accusatory impatient tone about my waitress asking me about toppings on my biscuit. Me and my sister individually explained that it was simply a misunderstanding and that I did not understand what the waitress was referring to. She still insisted that I should have known the biscuit came with toppings and that my waitress specifically asked me about the biscuit toppings. She was trying to argue with us and make a scene and was basically implying that I was lying and intentionally being illogical and difficult. When I tried to calmly explain to her that I would not have said yes to all the biscuit toppings if I thought the waitress was talking about the biscuit. Me and my sister asked the manager if that made any sense. She says, \\"Not Really!\\" and then walked away from us. So first we are hassled and questioned as if being interrogated by the police and then we are dismissed as being liars. Our appetites were immediately gone. It is such a shame that the food is so great and waitresses are so sweet. If the management doesn't know how to treat customers it's hard to enjoy the food. She should really think about anger management or seeking better customer service training to improve her management skills. Not to mention our impromptu sister date was ruined with the manager's negative energy leaving my sister and I aggravated and extremely disturbed. Needless to say my sister paid for everything because it was never our intention to waste food, but we did not need to be talked to like children or delinquents. Me being 30 and my sister 38; good law abiding citizens."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is easily my favorite restaurant.

Looked up halfway through it and saw that the restaurant was full.   About this time my Scallops with Linguine with fra diavolo sauce came.  I was like huh, thats a little fast, but ok.  Parents got their dishes soon after, but by that time it was packed.  Now I eat fast, but I mean, within seconds of finishing (BTW excellent), they picked up my plate and then dropped the bill off...

I'm inclined to think that those reviewers just want to bring the place down a notch.\\n\\nEverything that can be said about this place, good or bad, has been said dozens of times. No, it's not the best pizza ever, but guess what? What you think is the best pizza isn't really. Yeah, not every pizza that comes out of Antico ovens is equally good, but guess what? That's true at every pizzeria that doesn't standardize their product to an achievable lowest common denominator.. Yeah, in New York it would be one of a hundred places, but guess what? So would the other ninety-nine places.\\n\\nThe idea that Antico is not \\"authentically New York\\" or \\"authentically Italian\\" is equally absurd. Not all New Yorkers or Italians make food the same way. Anyone who has been to either place knows this. (There isn't even one officially recognized style in either place, either. New York has at least two \\"New York Styles\\" and Naples has two as well, one of which has no cheese.)\\n\\nIn short, GTF over yourselves and your pretensions of delicate culinary sensibility. It's a pizza, not a painting of your gold-plated ziz on the ceiling of the freaking Sistine Chapel.\\n\\nLet's address a hard cold fact: Atlanta has no right or reason to expect any good pizza. You'd need both hands to count the number of very good pizzerias that Atlantans have let die on the vine during just the 15 years I've lived here. Not one of them was measurably superior to Antico. So even if your hipster self-loathing complex feels the need to denigrate all the Antico hype, you'd better hold onto this place like grim death. Because even if Antico isn't perfect, it's probably as good a pizzeria as Atlantans will ever have within their borders. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying to you, and tearing down Antico to build themselves up. \\n\\nWhat Atlanta needs is not someplace better than Antico - it needs MORE places that are as good. If you really care about good pizza, and want Atlanta to be a better pizza town, you'll pack up your ego, tolerate the hype and support places like Antico, Varasano's and others. All you achieve by trashing what you KNOW is very good pizza (just to work out your resentment of hype) is to make it harder for other good pizzerias to flourish in this town.\\n\\nSorry for this rant.

Those good things include a vast beer selection and an interesting and well executed menu. \\n\\nI've been a few times now and on my last visit we had the best server yet!

The beer menu rocks EXCEPT it would be nice to have some standard brews available for those times when you just don't want to dick around with the unknown. I too get into unadventurous moods. Please cater to me in those moments. Thank you. \\n\\nThe noise level in this place is out of control.

If I had to pick one word to describe my experience at Circa 1926, it would be uninspired. Despite a pleasant staff and ambiance, Circa 1926 falls so short with its menu that I left with the distinct impression that I would not be returning any time soon. \\n\\nI went to Circa 1926 for lunch on a recent Thursday. I'd driven by many a time and was drawn in by its proximity to where I was parked as much as anything else. Hard wood and Moroccan influences are immediately apparent upon entering Circa 1926. I felt that I was either walking into a Montana lodge built by a North African or a North African establishment built by a Montanan. Either way, the ambiance and atmosphere was excellent. \\n\\nService was quick and attentive--perhaps because there was only one other table occupied in the restaurant. I was dining late (for lunch) so the emptiness of the restaurant did not set off any warning signs. I wish it had. \\n\\nI looked over the menu and settled on Vegetarian Pad Thai. Normally I will not order ethnic meals in restaurants that do not emphasize the specific cuisine of that ethnicity. I broke my own rule in this case because, well, I am old enough to break my own rules! That said, to be fair to Circa 1926, what follows may be an indication of its kitchen's skill with Thai cuisine more than it is a commentary on the full menu. \\n\\nFor whatever reason, the Pad Thai was uninspired. It had a surprising and unwanted sweetness and packed neither heat nor any discernible flavor other that the rather cloying sweetness. The dish emphasized noodles and lacked nearly enough vegetables, although the vegetables that it did have (various summer squash for the most part) were fresh and not overcooked. \\n\\nIt is easy to write about good food and perhaps even easier to write about bad food. Writing about boring food is not at all easy and boring food is what I found at Circa 1926. Having now read the reviews of people who preceded me at Circa 1926, I know that I am not the only person to have had a bad experience there.

So if it's busy, you've got people waiting in line to order and everyone entering or exiting the building is breaking into that line...again and again. Not a good first impression.\\nWe had queso (ok, nothing special) and tried the taquitos which were the special of the day. They were floating in what looked like chicken broth, which is new for me, but we gave it a shot. I only bothered with a bite of the chicken and a bite of the beef one. Literally, the only thing you could taste in them was the fried corn tortilla. Why is the filling so bland that it's overpowered by ground corn? How is that possible?\\nNext, I had a chicken \\"fajita\\" taco. Not only did it appear to be boiled chicken (it was grey!!!) but the only part of that with flavor were the chopped onions on top. My husband had the verde burger (the reason for 2, not 1 stars for this review) and he said it was good.

And the curry, instead of being a nice rich sauce, was basically some brown bits floating around in some yellow cornstarch and water.  Just wrong.  Other attempts have been even less successful.  Be wary when the guy on the other line pronounces it \\"MOOOO GOOOOO GAI PANNNNN\\".\\n\\nSo, while I'm generally pretty Pollyanna, Beijing Cafe gets negative stars for being the worst waste of restaurant space in Boston."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This was our second visit, and it did not disappoint.  \\n\\nLet's start with, if you aren't prepared to spend a couple hundred dollars, this is not the place for you.\\n\\nHands down our favorite steakhouse.

Martin our waiter, recommended my fiance an excellent drink (ginger lemon drop martini with Grey Goose) and tended to our needs without interrupting conversation or neglecting us, a delicate balance.  Our steaks were both prepared beautifully (8 & 11 oz. filets) along with the creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin, everything was perfect.\\n\\nMy fiance turned to Martin once again, and asked that he please recommend him a chocolate dessert...once again Martin rose to the occasion.  Chocolate lava cake paired with a chocolate mousse.  \\n\\nWe each had two cocktails, plus all of the above for about $200...which if you ask me, is WELL worth it.

My girlfriend and I went with the 6 course tasting menu. After a while, we realized we had more than 6 courses, we had a total of 10. The Chef came out to explain one of the courses to us, which was a nice gesture. Thank you! \\n\\nIt seemed that each course was better then the last, even down to the dessert, which was incredible, and I don't have much of a sweet tooth.

This place, and many of the Italian eateries in the North End, are tiny, and if you're not prepared, you can wait over an hour. This seems to be standard practice in these family owned establishments - no name taking, no beepers, no text confirmations - if you want to eat at Giacomo's, you wait your turn in line out on the sidewalk.\\n\\nAfter a midday Saturday Sox game, we trekked home to the North End, and we were starving. I called ahead trying to make a last minute reservation, but it didn't work. I was told the wait was about 25 minutes. \\nWhen we arrived, the line of about 20 people was completely daunting. As we explored other options, we realized that given it was the peak dinner time, in one of the hottest neighborhoods, on a beautiful Saturday night - we would be waiting no matter where we ate. Our party of two split up. I waited at Giacomo's and my friend stood at another restaurant. We decided whoever sat first, that's where we'd eat. After about 40 minutes, we got to skip ahead of larger parties and snag a table for two. If you're coming here with more than two people in your party - DEFINITELY make reservations, or you could be waiting over an hour.\\n\\nWe sat at a table with another couple. Good thing they were friendly - that woulda been awkward! Lots of yummy things on the menu, but after seeing our table mates order the Fried Calamari and Burrata appetizer special, we decided to follow suit. Since we ordered two appetizers, we decided to split an entr√©e. There's good variety of pasta, sauces, and proteins, especially seafood. And the prices are amazing! $15 for Shrimp Scampi? Yes. We split the dish, and I'm glad we did. After the two appetizers, some AMAZING warm bread (on the house), the perfect portion of Shrimp Scampi left us happy and satiated, but not uncomfortably stuffed (my usual state when departing an Italian place.) \\n\\nThe food was made quick and fresh to order. The service was quick, efficient, and friendly, especially given the tight space and crowds they deal with. The restaurant was stuffy and loud, but my water glass was never empty. (If you're claustrophobic, look for a different place to eat) \\n\\nThe scampi was fresh, light, and savory, and the Burrata and Calamari was flavorful. We ordered a small order of Calamari, and it was a heaping platter. I can't imagine what a large is meant to feed. It was the perfect amount of food. My only regret is not wearing a bib. I've decided I'm not allowed to order Scampi anymore without one - I always get butter down the front of me!\\n\\nOverall, GREAT value and amazing prices for what you get. Just do yourself a favor and make a reservation. Additionally, I'd avoid driving here at ALL costs, especially on a weekend.

I had the McCoy's signature burger, which I ordered rare - it came out medium rare as I expected, but was delicious nonetheless.  The other entrees on our table were also good - especially the fish and chips that one of my daughters ordered.\\n\\nI would have rated it a little higher, but the server wasn't knowledgeable at all.  He was a nice guy and was attentive most of our meal (the first 3/4 of it), but he just didn't know his stuff.  Linse asked about the wines, and he didn't seem to understand that chardonnay is a grape and not a brand.  She asked about a signature cocktail as well, specifically wanting to know whether or not it was sweet (which she didn't want).  He said it was not sweet, but in fact it embodied sweet in our opinion.  He encouraged us to consider the sushi, which we appreciated but declined because we were on our way to Hawaii and would be eating sushi all week.  He said that made sense, but that they had fresh mahi mahi at the sushi bar, which of course we couldn't get in Hawaii.  (I thought he was joking at first, but clearly he wasn't.)  Mahi mahi, of course, is the original HAWAIIAN name for the fish, which remains plentiful in the Pacific and on the plates of sushi chefs throughout the islands.

The new space is a lot more open but that being said there is a lot more room for larger tables, which they need to obtain quickly if they insist on keeping their plating sizes. My table of 4 became a game of Tetris as soon as the appetizers were delivered to the table. The boeuf et champignons (petits plats) was served on a platter that was a square foot (in measurement) and could barely fit on the table itself let alone the rest of my parties appetizers. The food took up less than a quarter of the plate (causing me to suggest they rethink their 'unpretentiousness' edge). After, what took about 5 mins to actually find it's way to an eventual resting place on our tiny table, staff became oblivious as to retrieving the plate once we were awkwardly complete. This same fiasco took place again when the entrees were served but this time, times four. The plates again were ridiculously oversized given the portion size and there was tons of dead space on the plate. \\n\\nThe food deserves 5 stars but the disaster of  a service (the plating, the staff and the table size) all created a very uncomfortable dining experience for a very common seating of four.\\n\\n***To boot, they were out of their famous Mussles, which is unacceptable given that we were there for an 8pm dinner service."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"What a fab place!

Of course the longest line at the event. I stood in line, while my wife went to Ed Mitchell, so we could attack two lines at a time. \\n\\nNow onto delivery. We had some friends over, who we invited to the block party, but couldn't make it,  so we ordered a family package from Salt Lick. It came with a 4.3 pound brisket, two full racks of ribs, two sausage rings, and a bottle of sauce. I also ordered three bottles of dry rub. And first, I must say, order more sauce. After the brisket and ribs get basted a couple times, not much left to dip in. I realized this and made a close replica. It was great, but  it's much much easier to order more.\\n\\nThe ribs were my favorite. They had more meat than any restaurant rib has ever had. Good quality meat and a huge cut. It's not that fall off the bone crap that chain restaurants think we like. It's great, smoky meat. And the outside tastes like a good peppered jerky. Amazing!\\n\\nThe brisket got the most compliments from the guests. I served it with the traditional white bread. I also made slow cooked baked beans, and coleslaw just to have the traditional real barbecue experience. It was tender, juicy, smoky, incredible. You can taste the wood, the bark, the smoke... I live in NYC where you can't have an open pit, so this was a good escape for us all.\\n\\nThe sausage was again, amazing. I liked the sausage at the block party better because it came straight out of the smoker, and not my oven. If I had a grill, may have been better, but none the less, still amazing.

I ordered the chicken pad Thai level 3 out of 5 on how spicy I wanted it to be. The spice was right on- perfect! Did make me sweat though but it was really good. My only complaint is that the noodles were a little bit over cooked. I don't like when the noodles are a bit mushy but overall this was really good pad Thai. \\n\\nOverall this place is great! Staff was super friendly and accommodating but sometimes we were confused on who our server was because there were multiple people coming to our table to get our order- a little bit unorganized but it was a Friday night and it was busy. The portions are huge so either split with someone or ready to have lots of yummy leftovers! The food is delicious and we really enjoyed our time here. Can't wait to come back and try the curry and other dishes."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was good, but not a big selection.

They give you two of their signature sauces to choose from, one with habanero and one regular.  I was particular to the habanero, but don't worry, it's not too hot.\\n\\nSalt Lick is a must visit if you're in Austin and want an authentic Texas BBQ experience.  Keep in mind that even though they have one at the airport, it's not the same.  If you can, take the 40 min drive to Driftwood and eat the best stuff they have to offer on a Texas ranch/winery.

I've been here a good five or more times while I work down the street on Granite Ave on occasion.  Many of the servers I have had, especially at the lunch hour.....have been superb.  But the food.......\\n\\nAnd it's not even the food overall, it's the accoutrement that shouldn't even need to be mentioned and yet, has failed me several times.  We're talking here about the (usually) delicious rolls that are brought to each table before you are served.  How can rolls be tough yet warm?  Where is the disconnect in terms of the ingredients used and them almost ripping my teeth apart?  You're so moist in the middle....yet so stale on the outside, blegh!  If anyone that works at this location ever reads this, please just fix your recipe issue with the rolls.  I've never said anything while I was there because I'm not a complainer in restaurants....but I'll tell you here, it has been awful within the past few months.\\n\\nAnother thing that somewhat irks me is that they hide their really GREAT cheaper lunch options towards the back of the larger, dinner menu.  I don't like they are pushing the $17 pastas and pizzas on me when all I want are unlimited salad/bread and a smaller portion of pasta or a sandwich for like 8 bucks.  Is it too much to ask to have two separate menus for different times of the day?  If mom/pops can pull this off........so can Bertucci's.  \\n\\nI have had every rustic sandwich they offer and not been disappointed once....unless the bread comes out somewhat stale.  The basil mayo on some of them is a great choice to compliment the ingredients, from chicken to portabello mushroom.  The flatbreads are equally as good, my favorite being the roasted eggplant.  More pesto dipping sauce please!  \\n\\nClean, comfortable atmosphere from what of the chains that still do it better than the rest.

I was visiting Portland last week and had to try it.\\n\\nThe food cart is now painted aqua blue instead of black.  I like it.   Portland is already dark and cloudy all the time.  The aqua blue color brightened the food carts environment, IMHO.\\n\\nMy favorite turned out to be the Couch Bowl.  It is pronounced 'kooch' and not 'couch'  (the furniture you sit on) like I thought it should be.  I guess it is named after a famous sea captain John H. Couch, a pioneer at Columbia river in Oregon. I like it because it is spicy, a bit sweet, and a bit tangy.  The sauce is made of gochujang, a Korean red pepper paste, combined with other secret ingredients. The vegetables tasted fresh and the sesame tofu was savory good.   This bowl  definitely doesn't taste like something that Captain Couch would eat though.  Unless Captain Couch also went to Korea, learned the cuisine, and took the red pepper paste home with him to Columbia river.   Hence, kooch was so delicious!\\n\\nI ordered a small Couch Bowl and a small Mississippi Bowl.  It's not that I am a pig but this may be once in a lifetime experience being I live thousands miles away  from Portland and who knows we all will be vanished in 2012 as the Mayans predicted.  :-)\\n\\nMississippi Bowl was also delicious!  The bbq soy curls were nice.  If you like bbq and ranch dressing, this bowl is for you.  \\n\\nNow, what I think COOL was the cylindrical Chinese-take-out bowls they serve it with.  That was a fun bowl to eat from!  You definitely have to use chopsticks(provided at the food cart) instead of a plastic fork.  Otherwise, it won't be fun at all.  My method was to plunge the sticks to the bottom of the take-out bowl and then pulled out the rice, tofu, and sauce while trying not to spill the veggies on top (you won't be able to do this well with a plastic fork).  Then, I ate what I dug out  to make some more room while I stirred and stirred until the veggies, rice, sauce, sesame seeds, and tofu were all mixed together.  I would not recommend eating the bowl like licking ice cream cone from top to the bottom.  The wonderful morsels are in the bottom and middle of the bowl so work at it until all combined together, you will be rewarded with yummy morsels.\\n\\nI bought several coconut macaroons to-go since I had no room for dessert.

Every year we try to make sure we get to new places - but every year there are 2 places that we MUST go to while we visit. Raglan Road is one of them.\\n\\nTo start, the atmosphere is fantastic. They have live Irish music (if you don't like it loud, just request a place further from the stage to sit) and live Irish step dancing (I believe from former Riverdance members). Once you're seated, they have an extensive beer & whiskey menu - complete with sampling flights - for you to choose from. After the waiter takes your drink order, they bring you this amazing Irish oat bread with a Guinness Reduction/olive oil dipper. Good night - it's freaking amazing. Truthfully if the rest of the food was mediocre - which it's not - the atmosphere, Magner's cider on draught, and this bread/dip is enough to keep us returning there. Just sayin'.\\n\\nThe food is quite good, I've found. I typically get the Kevin's Ham which comes with cabbage and this potato/apple stack thing that's pretty tasty OR the Bangers & Mash which is 2 sausages (homemade at RR), mashed potatoes, and a spoonful of their Guinness beef stew instead of gravy over the top. I can never finish it; the bangers are pretty filling and I need to leave room for dessert (get to that in a second). My husband ALWAYS gets the \\"It's Not Bleedin' Chowdah\\" which is a seafood dish served with a thin cream broth. He's always said that the seafood is cooked perfectly when he gets it; I'm not entirely sure what's in it but I think there are 5 kinds of seafood including mussels and scallops. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that from the moment we book our Disney trip every year until we arrive, he talks about getting this dish. It might be one of his favorites at any restaurant we've ever been to.\\n\\nThe desserts are also quite good, and though I've tried a couple of them there's one that I always end up going back to - their bread pudding. It comes out baked in a large coffee mug with 2 sauces on the side - a butterscotchy sauce and a white chocolate sauce. You make holes in the bread pudding, and then pour it in there SLOWLY to let it soak in. What you're left with is this delicious, gooey, pile of awesome that is rich, amazing - and big enough to share (there, I warned you). This dessert is my driving menu factor getting me back there every year (outside of the atmosphere, bread, and Magner's). \\n\\nThe one con that I've noticed here is that while the waitstaff is definitely friendly, they are a bit on the slower side. We've been known to wait a while for water refills, check-ins for bread/our meal, and having our order taken. For us it's not a big deal (usually) because we're on vacation, but I know that for some people that can be a bit of an issue. If you're aware of it going into it, then at least you're prepared. It's the ONE thing that holds Raglan back from getting 5 stars in my book.

So I ordered out tonight I got the braised beef,  empanada, scallops,  bbq chicken and roasted Potatoes...  To start the Empnada is literally 2 inches long good luck with trying to figure out why this costs $5.50, but anyway my real issue  is with the scallops..... When I opened the scallops I literally received 2 1/2 scallops (pictures uploaded)  pretty disappointing especially when this is supposed to be a tapas restaurant.  That's not much of a small plate  they might as well just advertise them selves as a sample restaurant... As I'm familiar with their sister companies Dali a day tapeo I decide to call (big mistake) as I was sure they would fix this instead I am greeted by a very unhappy  (miserable) maitre d. I simply asked if I could forward a photo of the scallops they prepared for me.  He says he's not interested and says I'm getting a bang for my buck as I'm getting scallops for $12. (hahahaha) so then I ask him if it's a common practice to send out  2 and a half eaten scallop for $12 he replied with they weigh the food and says they prepare the food by weight and that the scallops are 3oz well actually mmmmmm no!!  I happen to actually own a food scale and the weight of the scallops are a little less than 2oz.. Well of course I'm hoping he meant with out the sauce but now I'm assuming he meant with the sauce (I should have ordered more bread lmao) anyway moving forward on the phone conversation I asked again if I could forward the pic again as I was convinced (silly me) that if he could just see the pic he'd understand my case BUT instead shuts me down  AGAIN...  I let him know I wouldn't be ordering again and that I was leaving a yelp review based on my experience literally was like \\"yeah, yeah, yeah!!\\"  so here I am....  Basically if you're into over paying for sauce and enjoy stuffing yourself with bread (bread that will cost you $3.50 just a FYI) well then you have found your place :-) NOW if you enjoy actually eating a good meal no worries because there are plenty of amazing restaurants in the area!!  Kika is just not up to par"},{"name":"River Maiden","address":"5301 E Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome! Vancouver + good coffee = a rare and special find.

The charcuterie is honestly inspiring. After eating here I wanted to run home and start curing my own meat, must like how one would want to start a band after going to a concert. They have a creative selection of meats and cheese, and are quick on the draw to bring more toast for your selection.\\n\\nThe bad is that the service was generally lacking and not up to par with the food. While competent, the service felt more like a point of obligation rather than a pleasure. With food that good, it felt disappointing that the service wasn't as excited as the adventurous kitchen was.\\n\\nThe ambiance is slightly tacky, but it gets the point across. This place is excellent for dates or a light meal where quality rules over quantity.  Absolutely delicious. Despite any shortcomings, the Salty Pig is definitely worth the night out."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],L={key:0},D={key:1};function H(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",L,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-96708093"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/5.md","filePath":"people/5.md"}'),G={name:"people/5.md"},V=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
