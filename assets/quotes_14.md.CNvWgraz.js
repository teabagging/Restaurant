Setup was easy enough. But the $25 non refundable fee to rent a bay in NON busy times seemed like a \\"gotcha\\" type fee you encounter at simply TOO MANY businesses. Admittedly, my friends were a bit careless not to read the fine print, to know that it wasn't money applied to the bill, but solely a fee to get on a priority list for an available bay. Maybe a smart system should be in place to show the availability on the same screen so customers can judge for themselves if it makes any sense to pay $25 just to get there and find numerous open bays at an uncrowded Topgolf. It's not about the money, but it certainly left a bitter taste in the mouths of my friends we felt it to be a bit unethical.

Mike's was my first cannoli so back then I couldn't really criticize much; maybe cannolis weren't my thing. After having tried another cannoli I could totally taste the difference. I don't have much to say about the shell but the filling is grainy and way too rich. Compared to the other one I tried that was light and creamy, Mike's was thick, heavy and tasted too much like ricotta. Also, for what it is, their pastries are pretty expensive. Secondly, the service was bad. The cashier mocked us for asking a simple question. I don't usually care for service either but their employee was plain rude.Overall, even if the food and service was bad I recommend you check this place out since it's so popular."},{"name":"Mother’s Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Our first visit to Mother's was last Saturday and we all enjoyed our breakfasts.

We were upgraded to a balcony room which had a great view of the city and river. It was rainy when we were staying in Austin and the management put out small umbrellas and towels in the lobby which was a nice touch. \\n- Location: walkable distance (about 20 min) to SoCo and even closer to downtown. Right next to the congress bridge where you can view the famous bats. Cons: \\n- WiFi: did not work for me at all. I probably spent about 40 min in total troubleshooting with the hotel's IT call center but to no avail. My iphone/iPad couldn't connect and when it finally did connect, the connection would keep dropping or be so slow that it would be unusable. I ended up giving up and telling tech support that it works so I wouldn't have to stay on the phone with them. \\n- Noisy: because of the way the hotel's building is designed, the sounds from the lobby (and restaurants downstairs) travel up atrium and into the room. There also doesn't seem to be very good sound proofing on the balcony windows so there was a lot of noise (music/talking) coming into the room on the weekend. \\n- Dated: though the rooms seemed to have had some updates (new bathroom fixtures), it still felt pretty dated and the most annoying thing was that there was no master switch so each time I left the room, I had to go through the room to flip off each light (pretty sure there were 10 in total). The water pressure was also pretty weak. Other:\\n- Cleanliness: the room and balcony was very clean but I noticed a lot of random black marks on the sheets and pillowcases. Not sure if they were just stains but either way it was a bit disturbing."},{"name":"Torched Hop Brewing","address":"249 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place for happy hours.

The protein portions are generous, always fresh, and the mango is surprisingly great. No canned crap here!If I can give one critique -- maybe offer some different protein options, even if it's on a rotating basis. I see cool stuff like eel, scallops, etc at other Poke joints, so it'd be keen to have it here as well. Some other base options, like steamed veggies, zucchini noodles, etc would be wondrous as well, but that's realllllyyyyy searching to find a flaw, and it's rare to find that stuff elsewhere.

The vibe is smart causal, pretty trendy, and expect a bill over $100 for two.My husband and I came to Little Donkey opening week, and were definitely glad we made a reservation. When we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and escorted to our table. First thing I noticed was the really aggressive air conditioning. It might not have been so bad except we were seated under a vent that was blowing out hurricane force winds, so beware, tie your hair back, and bring a sweater! For dinner, we started with the ceviche, which was delicious! The flavors were so clean, but beware, it is SPICY! We then moved on to the silver queen corn - the highlight of the evening! Think Toro corn but slightly more savory and already cut off the cob. Next was the burger, which was great, but too rich to have finished on my own. Maybe because it came right after the corn...? Very tasty but I had enough after my half of the burger. Next up was the wok fried chow fun, which sadly to say, was a big letdown. They were substituting udon noodles for rice noodles, and the noodles were perfectly cooked, but the flavor was unremarkable. There was also a really bitter/burnt taste that would linger in your mouth after each bite - I was not a fan.Still hungry, we went for ordering round 2. Black pepper popovers were tasty, octopus was also tasty, but don't expect more than a single tentacle for that $16. Wanting to try some dessert, we ordered the cookie dough. While good, it seems like something you could make at home. Lastly, and maybe we can blame it on opening week, but the service got progressively worse throughout our meal. When we were seated, our waiter appeared immediately to take our order. He said he couldn't give recommendations because he just loved everything so much, blah. Food came out quickly, everything was explained well, but when we wanted to order food round 2, we had to flag down a busser... and then a host... and then a third person to find our waiter. Wait some more... try to find someone to give us a dessert menu... wait... flag down anyone you can possibly find to place that order... By the time we were trying to track down our check, I was just frustrated.

We cashed in on our check-in offer of a free order of garlic Broadway Bites & they were piping hot & full of flavor. So good! & I love their pizza. The crust is nice & thin, with just the right amount of crisp. It isn't the (pleasantly) greasy, foldable NY style but it's delicious, nonetheless.

I couldn't decide btwn a regular cannoli and a chocolate covered one so I got both (mistake, I actually couldn't finish two). Had both filled with the regular ricotta cream. The good thing is here the cannoli are filled when you order so the shell isn't getting soggy. They looked lovely when I opened the box they were provided in. The bf thought the cream was too sweet. We both thought the lobster tail pastry that he bought tasted better (and had better less sweet cream inside), but it was so ginormous that even after sharing it with my friend, we were unable to finish it especially with lunch looming on the horizon. Oh and the bf also ordered a coffee to go and we waited 10 min or so for it since there was only one person preparing coffee who was lazily chatting with someone as he did it and didn't check if we needed anything until we had been waiting for quite a while.

We had friends in town and we were staying on the Lake for the weekend so figured it would be a perfect place to take everyone. We got there and used the valet which was only $7 and since we had a big group and a newborn, this was greatly appreciated.We went up to the restaurant and they informed us it would be a 45 minute wait. We expected this and went to the Oasis Brewery for a drink while we waited. The brewery (which has absolutely no connection to the restaurant we found out) was amazing. The drinks were superb and the view was beautiful. I saw that they had food and almost suggested we stay there. I wish I had.After we had ordered our drinks, about 5 minutes into our wait, we got a text that our table was ready. Hard to complain about getting let it 40 minutes sooner than expected so we chugged our beers and headed over to the restaurant.We were sat at a long table with plenty of room for us and a great view for almost everyone in our party. The view truly is stunning but so was the view at the brewery.I asked the waiter which of the Oasis beers they had on tap and if the lineup was the same as the brewery. That's when everything began to go sour. He acted absolutely indignant that I assumed they had their beer and he pointed out vehemently that they have no association with the brewery and in fact were not on good terms at all with each other. I found that very strange and was disappointed that I couldn't enjoy any more of their beers. The beer selection they had in the menu once he pointed it out to me was mediocre at best. Seemed so strange they wouldn't serve the beer from their very close neighbor.Our waiter up-sold many of my friends on the drinks, clearly pushing them to the top end drinks. That wouldn't be an issue if the drinks were even decent, they were not. They were not even close to the premium we paid for them.It just got worse from there. We had two friends ask to split the Fajitas for 1 since they were leaving to go home and couldn't use the leftovers. The waiter, Marcus, was not pleased what-so-ever by this. He began treating us like he wanted to have nothing to do with our table. My friend even mentioned that we would still tip well despite not ordering a ton of food. Knowing my friends, they really would have had the service been even decent. From this point on we barely saw our waiter. He came out once to give us more chips. My friend politely said we were good on chips. We had eaten plenty and appreciate it. He then made one of the most sarcastic and passive aggressive comments I have ever heard a waiter say. He said \\"It's ok you barely ordered any food anyways\\". I had to confirm with my friend next to me that he actually said that. I was shocked. Multiple times we tried to find a manager. Our food had not come, Marcus was becoming visibly aggressive and upset, and we were just ready to leave. It was absolutely miserable.Finally our food came and the disappointment even got worse. The fajitas were cold. All of the food was pretty crappy and not even close to worth the price. The next time we saw Marcus, which took quite awhile, we asked for the check so we could leave. We just wanted to go home and put this horrible experience behind us. We got the bill, which was not small and included an enormous tip. At this point a couple of us wanted to remove the gratuity but the rest just wanted to go home and knew it would take a long time to actually find a manager and get the check corrected. We paid it and tried to put the whole ordeal behind us. I love leaving positive reviews and really supporting the businesses in Austin. There is almost nothing positive I can say about the Oasis restaurant other than it has a really amazing brewery walking distance from it that has just as good of a view. I recommend going there instead."},{"name":"Taste of Punjab","address":"4980 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Ste 192","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"Thought it would be better.

We ordered 3 rolls between the two of us: the maple (spicy tuny with spicy salmon on top), the scallop magma (spicy tuna with chopped scallops and black sesame sauce), and the rainbow roll (real crab meat cali roll with assorted sashimi and mango on top). The scallop magma was my favourite simply because I liked the spiciness of the tuna with the sweetness of the sesame sauce. Otherwise, the rolls are kind of simple and not very exciting. I hope they'll have a few more options to their menu soon, I probably should've tried some of their plain rolls (which are okay priced at $4 to  $5 for things like a cali roll or a dynamite roll)."},{"name":"Hawaii Grill & Sushi","address":"4423 13th St","city":"Saint Cloud","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything looked so fresh and delicious I wanted to try it all!

On opening the unlocked restroom, I was treated to the remarkable sight of the restaurant manager sitting on the toilet; he was half naked. We ordered palak paneer, butter chicken, some hot wings, some chicken tikka masala, and a few garlic naans. They had nice TVs which were playing the Bluejays game; it was our only form of entertainment since the food took at least a half hour to come. The waitress first bought the naans which were stained yellow and tasted terrible and had no flavor of garlic at all. The food came 20 minutes after by which we had choked the naans down because we were so hungry. The palak was vile and the paneer tasted very old. The butter chicken was OK but there were only two chicken pieces swimming in a curry oasis. The chicken tikka was very small but was alright. After we had finished our food, the man asked if we still wanted the hot wings. He offered to bring the hot wings (an appetizer!!) after the meal. We obviously said yeah cause we didn't want them to go to waste. They came and they were disgusting. The smell was revolting and we couldn't get one of them down.

Think about it, how can they maintain quality on a restaurant of that size?  Both of us had the seared ahi tuna salad. First, it was served cold.  Direct evidence of the \\"too big for quality\\" issue.  I didn't see any sear marks, though it was cooked just a bit on the outside, as it should be, other than being cold and not truly seared.  The liberal use of black sesame seeds tried to obscure any details.  The menu mentioned a chimichurri sauce.  Not sure where that was. It was never seen or tasted.  The tuna was not fully cut into large slices, and they did not provide knives.  The vinaigrette was pretty tasty.  The mixed greens were sparse, but fresh.  The mango made a strange combination of flavors.  It would have been a decent dish, if it had been served fresh off the grill.  When ordering, we asked the waiter what the \\"mixed greens\\" were.  \\"Uh, I can tell you that it doesn't have any iceberg in it.\\"  Wow.  But it did address our main fear.  I get it.

Now - we'd have been OK if they had flat out told us that dim sum wasn't available - but when we enquired at the entrance, the lady at the bar counter told us that their entire dim sum menu was available for ordering, save for the durian puffs. My friend had originally wanted to come for the durian puffs and the cheong fun, and I had wanted to order the lotus buns and custard buns, but we decided that the rest of the menu would suffice (and the lady said that the cheong fun, custard buns and lotus buns were still available), so we walked in and were seated. Once we sat down, a waitress came over and plonked menus and a dim sum ordering chit on our table. We marked off items that we wanted on the chit. Several minutes later, she came over with a dim sum cart and picked up our chit, and told us that most of the items we'd ticked off were unavailable, including the cheong fun and lotus buns. When we protested and said that the lady at the entrance had informed us that ALL the items save for the durian puffs were available (which is why we agreed to be seated in the first place), the waitress rudely cut us off and insisted that many of the items were unavailable, including the cheong fun. She thrust only three items which we'd ticked off (shrimp dumplings, custard buns, and steamed spare ribs) on the table, and marched off. As we were extremely hungry, we ate these three items while contemplating whether to order other non dim-sum items instead. Here, I will be fair and say that the standard of the food items was OK - nothing out of the ordinary, but perfectly acceptable. But the waitress' surly attitude and the blatant dishonesty by the lady at the entrance with regard to the availability of the items we'd specifically enquired about led us to ask for the bill instead. The waitress was surprised (why on earth!) when we asked for the bill so quickly after being seated, and quickly scribbled some numbers on the bill and handed it to us. The total (for three items, mind you), came up to a whopping $25. At this point, we were fuming inside. We left $25 on the table and walked off. The waitress saw that we hadn't left a tip and ran towards us, exclaiming angrily in Cantonese, \\"why no tip?\\". The cheek! We replied something to the effect of, \\"Non-existent service and non-existent food (as well as a generous dose of dishonesty) doesn't deserve a tip - you should be thankful that we even paid for this meal!\\" We took our business to Winsor Dim Sum Cafe directly opposite, and had a SIGNIFICANTLY better experience food-wise (cheong fun and lotus buns included), at a much fairer price - service was spotty, but that's pretty much the case at most of these places in Chinatown). TL;DR: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE -- DISHONEST AND DISINGENUOUS. Go to Hei La Moon or Winsor for dim sum instead!"},{"name":"Carrie's Winter Park Cafe","address":"240 N Pennsylvania Ave, Ste 101","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Went here with my friends to wrap up our trip and the restaurant is so chill, aesthetically pleasing and amazing!

Next, there are four different heat levels you can choose. Be aware for the faint of heart that even the second level (warm) can be quite hot. My friend was sweating just eating the warm chicken. Now, onto tasting the actual food. It is AMAZING. The dry rub is perfect and the mixture of crunch and moist chicken is amazing. Just know that you will make a mess. so maybe don't pick this as a first date spot. Luckily the big tables in the space feature paper towels though. The Mac n cheese is also delightful. Some of the best I've ever had. I loved the cheese that they used and how creamy it was. I'd recommend getting a meal here but the portions are biiiig so either come hungry or split with a friend.

Now? There are several places around town to grab a donair. So how does it hold up? The Good: Menu is what you expect from a donair shop, and they also sell beer the last time I checked. The daily specials are a really good deal.The 'Meh': The food can be really good to really terrible, it's inconsistent. I wouldn't grab a platter from them because their rice isn't the best, but I would grab an actual donair. The prices are competitive with the other donair business around town.  The Bad: The place looks filthy, and like I said the food is inconsistent. The staff (except for the actual owner) isn't the best either.The Verdict: Two stars which means \\"I've experienced better,\\" if I could it would be a two and a half, but honestly a place that is \\"A-Ok\\" in my books has to be consistent in something, which Donair Affair isn't in service and/or in the food. Yet, like I said, there is an odd time that you get something very good from the place.

The only two dishes I would order again were the ten veggies ten spices and the pineapple fried rice. The ten veggies ten spices was definitely the MVP since my mom even started the experiments at home to recreate this dish. That, the desserts and the service speed were the reasons of my 5/5 review. The portion size was pretty decent. My boyfriend and I both have a crazy appetite and were full afterwards. Also, the desserts were super good. I would recommend the durian black rice more if you don't hate durian. My family loved both desserts.

Not bad!  Just not as good as our previous 3 visits.  Here's why:First, they've changed the menu.  They got rid of the crepes!   Cafe Intermezzo has branded itself (correctly!) as a European cafe; crepes are standard fare, so why remove them?  Oh well.  So why 3 stars and not 4?  Mostly because the food is just OK.  My wife and I each had the classic American breakfast.  Eggs (poached) were slightly under.  Chicken sausage was tasty.  Potatoes were on the cold and greasy side.  Coffee was good, but the side of Kahlua I got was a super anemic pour (like a splash in a little silver creamer cup).Overall - not bad.  Just not what it used to be.

Maybe that's just the hipster way: apathy.The donuts themselves were alright, kind of like crunchier Hostess donuts with toppings.

The only things a good coffee shop should be serious about is quality product, quality value, and quality service.  Kick Butt coffee is unparallelled in all three.Now, I understand that Master Gohring's taste is not for everyone.  I'm ok with that; for people who can't lighten up a little and have no appreciation for the small businesses that are the backbone of America, you can find a Starbucks on nearly every corner.  Some intersections have two Starbucks; I was once in a town in Florida where THREE corners at the same intersection were occupied by a Starbucks.  But I digress....My point is that, in nearly half a century of patronizing small businesses, of getting to know small business owners, and yes, even briefly owning a small business myself (which taught me that 1: I'm not cut out to be a small business owner and 2:  that small business owners don't get enough respect),  I have never met the owner of a business (of ANY size) who is more accommodating of his customers than Master Thomas Gohring.  He takes the reviews and commentary of his businesses to heart (some would say \\"too much so\\") but that is what makes Master Gohring and Kick Butt coffee so special and so beloved.Kick Butt coffee is a winning 1-2-3 punch:  great product, great people, and a great place.

The food comes out on metal cafeteria style trays so not the best presentation but great food nonetheless. The few drawbacks, albeit small are, the food takes a while to come out on weekends when there is a long line if you are dining it and the seating area is limited downstairs. Upstairs there are rooms with seating but somewhat awkward since they are cramped and almost feel like an apartment room so very quiet.

It comes with a side of Parmesan chips which can be substituted for fries or a salad if you add money. The chips itself tasted like Ruffles with some Parmesan sprinkled on. Nothing special. The portion is also very large so even though $10 might seem steep for a sandwich you get a good amount of delicious food for it. My BF tried their Sunday all you can eat brunch buffet and that was super good as well. It cost about $14 for that and well worth. They serve Szechuan chicken with Belgian waffles, corn dogs with a homemade honey mustard sauce, fruit that's soaked in this ginger sweet like sauce....(thought it was weird but it cut the fat), eggs, bacon, and also a tattertot casserole. I don't eat red meat so that's the only downside of the brunch. If youre vegan or vegetarian the brunch is a no go. Another great thing about this food truck is that it's part of gibsons bar.

Our cocktails were very nice, the Taoseño in particular was interesting and refreshing. We started with the queso, which was delicious. I loved the pepper jelly and the pepitas,  which really elevated the dish, although I do think if it was cooked in a deeper bowl so that there was more of the gooey interior and less of the crispy broiled sides/top I would have liked it even more.My husband ordered the burger and absolutely loved it. The one complaint about the entire meal is that we both really hated the tater tots that are served as a side. All it tasted of was fried breading-you could not taste potato at all. It was like empty balls of fried nothing and they were left uneaten so I recommend substituting these for another side. With that in mind, I am still giving Santo 5 stars because everything else was really that good. My vegetarian enchiladas (Christmas style with both red and green sauce) were outstanding! The winter vegetables went so well with the dish and provided a lovely brightness underneath the sauce and also some texture. The sauces must take forever to cook because the depth of flavor achieved in both the red and the green was sheer perfection. Please don't ever change this dish-it is heavenly. The black beans served on the side were also incredible-the amount of smokiness in them was wonderful and they were addictive-I wish the portion was larger because I was scraping the bowl for more! This was definitely the best meal we've had in Colorado and I cannot wait to return to try more of the menu."},{"name":"Linh Café - French Cooking","address":"2836 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We came in for some take-away sandwiches.

Everything on anyone's table looked amazing whether it was the Vietnamese items or the French. I overheard that the chef is from Hanoi but trained in France.How was the chicken sandwich?

We walked around in the freezing weather and grabbed a drink at margaritaville and then headed back to the chocolate emporium when we were near the end of our given wait time. We got the text that our table was ready pretty much on the dot of when they told us - I was very impressed!We were quickly sat and our server came over to us to take our drink orders. We looked over the menu and decided to split a burger after having a delicious flatbread. The burger came out perfectly cooked which we were very surprised about since most places over cook your burger if you order it medium rare - this was nice and bloody! For dessert, we did the brookies,cookies and cream. We were eyeing their crazy milkshakes, but decided we didn't have the stomach for them that night (some of them had entire pieces of cake on top of them!). The dessert was in existence for probably a minute at most because we inhaled that thing.We enjoyed our visit to the chocolate emporium, everything from the food to the characters wandering around the restaurant.

I'm not one to call a beer \\"Delicious\\" but I think this one was.  As an entree I had the Dry-Aged Bone-In Rib-Eye.  This thing is huge.  The disadvantage to that is that you are probably not going to finish it, so you are going to have a steak with you to take back to your room.  It never even got finished because of that.  This certainly isn't a knock against the restaurant, but more as a warning to patrons.The service was good, but a tad bit slow. Its very busy and because of that the one tip I can really offer for this place is MAKE A RESERVATION.  You are very likely not going to walk in and just get a table.Also, it's not cheap.  Probably one of the most expensive places at Epcot. If you are on the Disney Dining Plan it will consume two meal credits (at the time of this review) so do plan accordingly.

And they don't skimp on ingredients for the price you pay.  The one thing I did find is in their oxtail pho (which they charge a bit more for), the oxtail bits were extremely overdone and you could barely bite any meat off of it. Unless you had horses' teeth.

If that doesn't convince you, I'll explain...The food is very average or below average. You're much better off eating at any other restaurant nearby. You're in Orlando. I'm sure you can find good restaurants. The pricing of the food isn't too bad compared to other restaurants, but the quality is comparable to eating microwaved food. The drinks are pricey and honestly not worth the money.Out of the two desserts that they offer, my friend got the brownie one. It was literally two small brownies (the kind you can buy in a plastic wrapper for about a dollar per pair) with a tiny scoop of ice cream about the size of a golf ball. Yet, they put this on a huge oval plate and made fancy chocolate syrup patterns on it. $10 for this garbage? Glad I didn't buy that...The service was terrible. Our waitress was never around and we didn't even get to order until we had been there for like 20 minutes. I don't think I've ever had service this bad before.

Despite the fact that it was supper time I had no trouble getting seated quickly.  In fact the restaurant never seemed to get too crowded while I was there.  Apart from that the service was reasonably speedy (and friendly to boot) so I was in and out in no time.  Like I said before the burgers are why I love White Spot so much so I had to get myself a hamburger.  The burger could have been a little juicier but apart from that it was just as awesome as I remembered it to be.  There was a generous serving of cheese and I love the Triple O sauce.  When combined with the fries the portion was more than enough for me.The prices weren't so bad considering we were at the airport and it was a sit down place.  The burger was $15 and I added a beer to that for an extra $6.  I was expecting worse but I was pleasantly surprised.

The only upside to this establishment was the decor and our waiter. Everything else was a giant disappointment and yes, even the desserts were bad. For starters, having never been to Toothsome's before, we asked our waiter for suggestions. He suggested that we try the chocolate almond bread with the caramel butter. When it arrived at our table, it was hard as a rock and very crumbly, as if it was made days ago but just thrown in the oven to be warmed up. It was very strange and not at all good. Very stale.There was 7 of us and no one enjoyed their food. NO ONE! 3 of my kids ordered the chicken fingers off of the very small (4 options) kids menu. The chicken was sooooo dry and over cooked that the minute it was put on our table, we could easily see how overcooked it was. The tenders weren't golden brown, they were DARK brown. The kids enjoyed the fries thankfully. My niece ordered the Caesar salad with shrimp. Her salad came out on a HOT plate! How does that even make sense? Her lettuce surrounding the bottom of the plate was hot and wilted. Her shrimp were so over cooked that she couldn't even swallow one down and there was barely any dressing on the salad. Such a shame. My mom ordered a burger and it was tasteless. The cook of the burger was nice, which she was thankful for, but a bland patty on a hard pretzel bun is really underwhelming and upsetting. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo. The sauce was bland, the parmesan cheese on top was low grade, probably a $3 bottle of kraft brand, as it felt like sand paper in my mouth and didn't melt with the warmth of the alfredo sauce, instead just sitting on the top of the over cooked noodles, turning a yellowish color the longer it sat. Again, very disappointing.The most upsetting part of our meal was the dessert. Being as we were at a Chocolate Emporium, we HAD to get dessert. We were all excited and hoping to feel some-what satisfied with one of their most famous shakes. 3 kids ordered the cookie jar shake and the other 2 ordered the brownie shake. I will admit that they were beautiful and looked very appetizing, but they were nasty! They were so gross that as soon as we left the restaurant, we found the nearest garbage can and dumped the shakes out, making sure we saved our cups, being as each shake was $15 alone! The shakes themselves were warm and runny and very very bland. Also, their menu describes every shake is finished with a homemade whipped cream, but sadly that wasn't true at all. They use COOL-WHIP  That's how they're able to hold all of the stale cakes and cookies in place. Real whipped cream would melt, this was fake cool whip and clearly the cherry on top to a TERRIBLE experience. Thankfully we weren't visiting from out of town, as we're locals. I would have been even more upset if I traveled from neighboring states just to pay $300 for plastic shake cups. I ended up spending an additional $60 on a second dinner, at our hotel food court because we were all so hungry. If you're at all considering this establishment for dinner and/or dessert please be warned that the food is just meh and the over priced desserts are even more meh. You'd get a better shake at a cheaper price from Steak n Shake.

I would also recommend making a reservation through Yelp (they are not on OpenTable) just to be safe as there were quite a few tables with \\"reserved\\" signs on them.  Our waitress was professional and cold; she had zero interest in being there and kind of hovered as we talked and took our time deciding on what to order. I will say that the complimentary rolls were decent and the garlic dipping oil was fantastic! What we ordered: \\nChips & Salsa- The chips were from a bag but the house-made salsa was decent. It is so easy to make tortilla chips so getting store-bought ones was a disappointment.Pear & Bleu Salad- This was so boring.

They are out of the ordinary taste-wise.

I wanted to order from a different Indian place and decided to give Mt Everest a try. Unfortunately it wasn't great, or even good.The Masala was very uninspiring. The salmon was alright though there weren't a lot of pieces. But the real disappointment really is the Masala. It was spicy enough but had very little flavor, and the consistency was rather greasy. Good Indian food has the spice and the flavor, and this place just doesn't have it. It certainly cannot compare to Curry N Kebob or Yak & Yeti's Masala.

Even though I was pretty full from lunch at Quincy Market, I could always make room for some dessert. Besides, this was right across the street and along the way on our Freedom Trail journey. My friends told me I was lucky because usually there are huge lines that go outside this pastry shop. It was almost 4 and there was no wait and we got our pastries pretty quickly. I opted to get two mini cannolis, so I could try two different flavors, but I guess if you just order two cannolis, the default flavor is ricotta filling. No matter because I scarfed down both pretty quickly and they were delicious. The pastry shell was crispy and flaky and went wonderfully with the sweet creamy filling. My only complaint as always was the powdered sugar. As I tried to take my first bite, it went everywhere all over my sleeve and pants. I realized I really don't need powdered sugar for aesthetics or taste on my desserts - they are great as is. Anyways, I wanted to try Mike's on the way back, but we were so tired from the walk that we bussed it back and skipped Mike's all together. I think the general consensus among my friends are that Modern Pastry Shop is the better place for cannolis. I think they have an advantage because they sit right along the Freedom Trail. I heard Mike's is close too, but I didn't see it along the way. If you want just a taste, the mini cannolis will run you $1.50 each.

Mike's Pastry didn't quite convert me, but I'm glad I got to try such a statement shop in Boston.Mike's Pastry makes no boasts of its popularity because the crowds speak for themselves. The inside is simple with its display glasses stacked with goodies along the walls, a smattering of tables along one side, and more pastriristas (excuse my made-up word, but.. get it?!) than I've ever seen in one shop. I wasn't really a fan of the mechanism of ordering; there were no real lines, but instead just a mass of people swarming towards the front trying to get the attention of one of the servers (think: crowded club bar on Saturday night minus inebriation). The lady who helped me seemed worn out with the job, and she merely waved at the display case when I asked if she could tell me what was inside a certain cannoli. I did like the trademark boxes and handy spools of string descending from the ceiling though; and I thought the signature string wrapping was neat.Florentine cannoli:\\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mikes-pastry-boston?select=v0gO-MaUKqTBp3BYImqIcw#uYOmgJz6hn7uXBwpW5_Zxw)\\nI felt that this cannoli was cavity-inducingly sweet, with both the shell outside and the cream inside being the definition of sugar overload. I'd read that the shell outside was crunchy, but I felt that the particular one I received was downright hard. It was hard to bite into, pretty thick, and a piece even stabbed me in the side of the cheek. The cream was fragrant and thick, but combined with the mini chocolate chips, I couldn't get farther than two bites before the sweetness became too much. The mini chocolate chips were also a tiny bit stale, which made the ends much less enjoyable.Hazelnut cannoli:\\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mikes-pastry-boston?select=v0gO-MaUKqTBp3BYImqIcw#-5OLi8Uz_TELpDWxVU1M8Q)\\nOut of the two, I enjoyed this one a little more than the Florentine. I didn't get a whole lot of hazelnut flavor, but the shell outside was flakier and not so thick. The cream inside paired well with the shell pieces, and the absence of semi-stale mini chocolate chips helped. Mike's is such an iconic shop, and the varieties of pastries they have is just awe-inspiring. I didn't love my visit here, but I'd be interested in coming back to try some of their other pastries, perhaps just not at peak hours."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing.

As soon as we walked in I felt welcome. They have clear instructions on the wall: grab a menu, order, take a seat and they will bring out your food. The menu is quite large and has pretty much any Mexican dish you could want; tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, enchiladas, and chimichangas. I spent probably close to 10 mins looking everything over before going up to the counter. I ordered a duo with a chipotle chicken quesadilla, carnitas burrito, and chips for $10.99. The girl ringing us out was super friendly. There were a ton of options to customize each dish. She knew everything extremely well and took the time to patiently go thru each one with us. I even got to sample the lemonade, which was the most perfect combination of tart and sweet. I highly recommend!Since it was our first time there they gave us a free appetizer of chips with salsa, guac, and queso. By the time we finished ordering and before we even sat down they were already bringing it out. That's how quick the service was. And the chips were still warm from the fryer! The entrees came out maybe 5 minutes later. Everything looked and tasted great.

Their mini donuts are made to order and are absolutely delicious. They're super airy on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside. I've tried Pip's a few times in college (my university would rent their mobile cart for campus events sometimes) and I was really craving the taste a few weeks ago. My partner's never tried Pip's before, so we decided to stop by the store for a bunch of donuts and chai. The line here is annoyingly long, albeit expected for how popular and delicious Pip's is. We came on a Sunday around 3 pm (they close at 4), and there was a 20+ person line. Luckily, the line moved quicker than I expected (around 20-25 minutes), and we were able to get our cute little donuts within 10 minutes of ordering. If you're in a hurry or trying to stop by Pip's before a flight home, however, don't. I particularly enjoy the Dirty Wu donut, which is their original cinnamon sugar donut with nutella and honey. It's my favorite since you get to try most of what they offer (minus their seasonal flavor and associated toppings) in one donut.

A tip is that they will not seat you if your entire party is not at the restaurant. My first time coming to Mother's we came for my bachelorette party and had a party of 7. We waited to get seated like 5 minutes (because of our party) but once we did we were sat at a table in the very back behind a wall. It was next to a trio of tables that the staff was using to hang out at while they were doing things like folding napkins. Normally, I wouldn't give a darn but the staff were very loud and raunchy. It made me really uncomfortable to hear such personal or sexual things coming from people who are supposed to be in a professional environment. Next, while our waitress was very nice she forgot different orders twice and also took a long time to get back to us. Because we showed up at 2:30 we had to order from only soups, sandwiches, and salads. Which normally wouldn't be a bad thing but several people in my party kept talking about how bland and dry their sandwich was. Finally, once we wanted to pay we probably waited 25 minutes just sitting at our table waiting for our waitress to come back with the check. I paid for 2 hours of parking and used over the 2 hours. Several people in my party (myself included) had to run out and add 15-30 minutes to our parking meter.  So that experience was a one star. The next time coming to Mother's was for our morning after the wedding brunch with family. I wanted to give them another shot because I heard great things. We came with a party of 13 and was seated effortlessly and in a much better spot which was really nice. We had the same waitress I had before but she was much faster this time and not forgetful (off day perhaps?). Plus the brunch food was wayyyy better than the sandwich menu.

I thought maybe it was a one off but we were wrong. Our tofu goreng was also absurdly spicy. Our nasi goreng was also spicy. It's either the chef was pissed off that day, our waiter ordered our food with the spices kicked up, or they simply upped the spiciness of their food without informing people. I have never had an issue with the spiciness at this restaurant before except on this visit. Overall it was a very disappointing meal. When we left, we both said we wouldn't be coming back for a long time, or we'd just go to another one of their locations all together. The service was abysmal and the food took awhile.

All they had were shops and Earl of Sandwich, plus the Pleasure Island section that I was not old enough to enjoy.After renovating Downtown Disney to Disney Springs, the place is stunning! There are so many places to eat, shop and be entertained. I would usually dine at Earl of Sandwich (which is so delicious do not get me wrong) because that really was considered the cheapest option for food compared to other higher-end seated restaurants like Bongos or Wolfgang Puck.Now there are restaurants like Blaze Pizza or D-Luxe Burgers to choose from which are equally as delicious. If you're looking for other moderate-high end restaurants, there are places like Paddlefish, Boathouse or even an Asian-inspired restaurant called Morimoto.I also like how Disney kept part of the old Downtown Disney side (where Earl of Sandwich is), along with the classic locations like the World of Disney store and Ghirardelli!I am truly amazed at how much this place has changed, but it is for the better and it is beautiful! I have heard that Disney modeled the designs of the stores and atmosphere to be like Worth Street in West Palm Beach, Florida. It truly does resemble it!As for the shops, Disney Springs has incorporated places like Lilly Pulitzer, MAC, Pandora, The Art of Shaving, etc. There are shops for everyone in the family to enjoy.Lastly, the entertainment around Disney Springs has been the most noticeable for me. Whenever I go, no matter the time, there is always something happening! Whether it is a musician playing an instrument or singers performing popular songs - it happens all the time and at different sections throughout Disney Springs.Don't forget that there is also a bowling alley called Splitsville and an AMC movie theatre (plus a separate dine-in theatre) that the whole family can enjoy one evening or on an afternoon when you are taking a break from the theme parks!

I was immediately drawn to Mike's Special Scramble which includes 3 eggs scrambled with prosciutto, fresh whole-roasted garlic cloves, tomatoes, basil and lots of provolone cheese. I love prosciutto and you don't often see it as an option. I also subbed the tomatoes out for spinach which was a great call to get those greens in there. The garlic is plentiful so keep in mind that you'll be tasting it all day, but this is a scramble with tons of flavor.Their roasted breakfast potatoes were hearty, tender, and well-seasoned.

What a mistake!! I'm furious!!! My husband and I went to Bia Bistro for date night over the weekend. We live in the neighborhood and walked over fairly early, around 6pm. There were a few tables seated outside and since the weather was cool but nice we decided to eat outside on the patio as well. We received menus promptly and our server took our drink order. That's where the service fell off the wagon. Hard. Our drinks (a pimms cup and a cucumber mojito) came out a little slower than I would have liked but I was excited because they came in very large glasses and at $12 each it seemed reasonable. I am pretty sure each drink lacked all of its liquor and was just a ton of mint in soda. I ALWAYS get two cocktails when we go out for date night (it's a splurge!) but I didn't even bother. We ordered our dinner, I had salmon with a caper cream sauce and mashed potatoes and my husband had \\"tiny meatballs\\" with gnocchi. Both were fine, not great, but fine. They were both overpriced for what they were- my salmon was almost $30. Our server, Kathleen, checked on us exactly once, when we were about 75% finished with our meals. And then nothing. Nothing. We sat at the table with empty dirty dishes for 30 minutes. We saw our server many times as she walked past us on her way to tend to other tables. She never even bothered to look at us or to gesture that she'd be over as soon as she could. The restaurant was a little busier at this point, but by no means slammed. They had no wait for a table. Other servers and the hostesses walked by our dirty dishes without clearing them. We had to flag our server down to get the check and we were so afraid of losing her again rushed to give her our card before she could even leave it with us. She never asked if we wanted another drink, coffee, dessert, or asked how our meal was. The bill for two drinks and two entrees was $103.79 and I've had better service at Denny's.

Oregon, let me introduce you to Rigoberto's. This has to be the most legit Mexican food in the greater Northwest. I am a native from San Diego as is my son. It was him who discovered Rigoberto's. Sunday night everyone is hungry for Mexican food and we make the 20 minute journey from Tualitan to Rigoberto's. For pick up we choose the drive through, wade through the extensive menu and make our order. Food is ready in a short time and we are on our way. Order includes 2 Oregon burritos, Taquito's with and without guacamole,carne asada fries, beans and chips with salsa. The taquito's are crunchy and have enough meat to qualify for So Cal status. The only thing missing is shredded lettuce and tomatoes. The Oregon burrito's are big with carne asada, fries and cheese. It is missing pico and guacamole but otherwise good and the carne asada fries are massive and could feed 4. Chips come covered in salsa which left them mushy and a bit uneatable. Rigoberto's has room for improvement and therefore the 4 star rating. But for Oregon, this place is the bees knees.

While you do have the occasional tasty salad option, watching everyone else eat other dishes isn't always fun.Fortunately, Greenbeat, which is located on Orange Avenue near the BOA building, decided to do something about it. Like with other \\"custom selection\\" restaurants, Greenbeat makes salad interesting my providing lots of options and giving you control over what you eat.When you walk into the restaurant (which IMO looks like something out of California), you see a very modern look, with an interesting wooden decor to the right, a row of nice small woods tables (they also have a few tables outside), and a modern looking bar to the left. The way it works is you walk up to the bar and pick out each part of your menu, whether it is the green (i.e. lettuce, spinach, quinoa, etc), the vegetables, the fruits, the toppings, etc. While they have various suggested combinations that you can do, I usually like to come up with my own idea and see where it goes. They also offer meats that you can put on top of your salad for a few extra dollars. I would highly recommend trying some of these meats because I believe they are steamed and just generally taste healthier.When I visit, I usually order a spinach salad and have them add some cabbage, nuts, maybe a fruit, balsamic dressing (they also offer some type of dressing enhancer for free to go along with it), and chicken. If you remember to ask, they will also give you a piece of bread. While I don't normally order sodas, I do order it here because they have a Boylan soda fountain (something I haven't seen anywhere else in Orlando). Since the place is fairly new, I've also noticed that the entire staff is very very friendly and eager to talk to you about the restaurant or hook you up with little things to get you to come back. This place also has a rewards system (I think it is something like Buy 5 get 1 free, but don't quote me on it) that makes this a great place for someone to grab lunch if they work downtown or have to be there for an extended period of time (aka jury duty).Overall, Greenbeat is an awesome healthy lunch spot with a unique salad ordering system, excellent ingredients, a clean and updated interior, and an overall healthy and friendly vibe. If you are looking to eat healthy, this is a great place to do it."},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Best pit-stop of any Metro-Airport I've been too!

Well, it makes me wonder if had ever seen one before, because the setup was small & disappointing for what they advertised. Next disappointment was the skaters, cuz none of them could land any of their tricks whatsoever. Then sadly it started raining, so they cut the demo off, and everybody moved inside. Since it was raining, they moved the bikini contest inside, and decided the close down the main bar so the \\"contestants\\" could walk around it. Yes I said they closed down the main bar. So on top of starting the contest 40mins late, the waitresses were absolutely horrible at doing what they were suppose to be doing. Before the contest started, my buddy had gotten two beers, and they'd be the last at that. Once the contest started, he had asked at least 3 different waitresses if he could get a beer, and all had forgotten. Shortly after the contest had started, it just got boring. Once the contest was over, he went to go pay his tab, which is something I'll get to in a minute. But I sat down at a table waiting, and normally, you would think that the waitress who is assigned to that section/table, would have come to at least ask if I was doing ok, or needed anything - afterall, I am a customer.  Um yea, about 6 different waitresses walked back & forth, looked down at me, and just kept on. Heck, one even came to push the chairs in, and looked at me as if I was taking up space, but never offered any service. Now here comes the best part, when my buddy went to go pay his tab, and remember he had just gotten 2 beers, they charged him $20+. I don't recall the exact amount, but it was over $20 - FOR 2 FREAKIN BEERS. Reality, i think they cost $3-4/beer. But that was just ridiculous. Needless to say, he spoke w/a couple of the managers that were there about all the issues and bad service we had received, or lack thereof. And in regards to the \\"scenery\\", personally it is nothing to brag about, or return going to see.

I only ever ordered crawfish each time I go and as far as just the crawfish, when they have live ones, I would rate that a 3. HOWEVER This past Monday I went in with the boyfriend to get crawfish. WELL... they ran out. (3 lbs of frozen were left but another table took it). So we tried ordering anything else on the boiling pot menu, but they were out of everything except shrimp. They did manage to order some KING CRAB LEGS for us. We ordered the shrimp and steak as well as 3 lbs of King Crabs.KING CRAB LEGS: Way too salty if you dip it in their seasoning. I recommend tasting the meat before the dip. But overall this was a miss..there's nothing special to the way it's prepared cause it's the same seasoning as all the other stuff that gets boiled in a pot. AND YES I know they are naturally salty to begin with, but I'm guessing they boil it in the seasoning which ALSO has salt in it so then the flavor just taste like a block of salt. STEAK AND SHRIMP: Ordered a medium rare steak, got a medium well. The steak was SO CHEWY AND SALTY that I didn't eat more than two bites and I had to chug my water. The service was slow but they only had 4 tables to wait on that walked in 3-5 min apart and they had 3 waiters. By the time she came by to check on us, my boyfriend had already finished half of the steak not that it was good but he didn't eat the whole day. SO oh well, can't return the nasty salty steak.The shrimp was actually the best part of the whole entire meal. Corn meal battered fried jumbo shrimp that comes with some sauce (DONT RECOMMEND THE SAUCE). \\nI've been going to both of the locations for 6 years and the business is just getting more and more inconsistent with the taste and quality of the crawfish and service. I've introduced multiple friends to this location BUT now I don't think I want to go back anymore. Service to me means a lot, especially because I'm a server myself, I know what it's like to be in the weaves (bombarded with customers), but you do not ignore your customers to talk to your co-workers.  We paid $90 for our meal (around $20+ a pound for the King crab legs) and all we got was a nasty steak, 4 pieces of good shrimp and the saltiest king crab legs ever.  \\nOH and I've told the managers at both location that their menu is wrong about SHINER BEING AN IMPORT. ITS A DOMESTIC, it's made in freaken Texas. They still charge me the import price each time I go there."},{"name":"Meskel Market","address":"839 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I worked briefly but closely with an African American gentleman who had served for the UN in Somalia in the time of Black Hawk Down. He was the assistant ambassador in the embassy on my project initiated by the ambassador. It was one of my greatest privileges to work on a high risk project with him and the ambassador. It was not Somalia, it was worse. That project was one of my most intense experiences because of what started horrible when I was there worsened to unspeakable horrible in opposition to our work. Hey, you have to take the risks!The 1993 Somalia incident was brought to the screen in a harrowing military action film. It's well worth seeing. The event soured America's taste for humanitarian intervention. I actually talked to Susan Rice in recent time about it and she was evasive. That says something. The result is that the US did not intervene in the 1994 Rwanda genocide. He related that in Somalia, when two men meet, casually armed with AK-47's, it is the custom for each to recite their lineage back through several generations. If there was a conflict at any point between the respective family trees, it is the duty of each to kill the other. \\nThe North East subcontinent of Africa includes Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea, even adjacent parts of Kenya and Sudan. There are many people there, and the food, people and cultures cross map boundaries.\\nI have an interest in Ethiopian food, one of the few distinctive African cuisines transplanted here. I was recommended to this market by two Ethiopian restaurants as a source of Ethiopian spices. First entering the store, I thought I was in the wrong place. It's a convenience store, packed with coolers and candy. The coolers brimmed with beer, soda and energy drinks. They had more candy than I knew existed. Wandering a bit, I came across two shelves seemingly out of place with the rest. One had fifty pound sacks of barley and Ziplock bags of green coffee beans (unmarked and unpriced, by the way). The other side had spices packaged in half pint and quart plastic containers. About this time a charming woman emerged from the back of the store to answer my questions.We had a conversation about how to cook with the berebere powder, never mix it with onion powder, but fresh onions, olive oil, meat and vegies are fine. They had ground fenugreek which she explained is good for ulcers when mixed with honey and taken before meals. Turmeric she explained is a natural treatment for arthritis. How interesting. I asked her if I could take a few pictures of the spices and coffee beans and she said fine. Exactly the flow of conversation on everything and nothing I've engaged in Ethiopian restaurants.\\nThen the man at the cash register intervened. \\"You can't take pictures here without permission\\" (somewhat true, though a gray area, the problem is more in publishing them; but hey, I can accept that.) I explained why I was taking the pictures - to write a review on the Internet that would be good for business, and that the shopkeeper had given me permission. He continued, somewhat agitated, that it was like coming into someone's home and taking pictures. After a few more minutes of trying to explain, I gave up.\\nWhat I would expect is more like. \\"Hello, is this the first time in our store. How did you hear about us? We have these items. Can I help you find anything. Let me tell you about these spices. We get these green coffee beans from ..., do you know how to roast them? I noticed you taking pictures. Tell me more about the website. Well you know I am concerned about XYZ, so I would appreciate you do or not do ABC...\\"\\nI'm really not sure how this new business survives. Though the markup of convenience items is high, you need customers to make it work. Maybe they are the only convenience store convenient to PCC, no, actually not. At the prices of the spices, I doubt that they can sell enough berebere powder to support a store.So it's still a mystery to me how one might be a customer of this business. I'm sure the owner is proud of his store. Not sure what land mines I stepped on in my visit. Maybe the lady should be in front and the gentleman in the back room? Your mileage may vary, but I'll keep you posted on my quest for another source of Ethiopian spices, especially in smaller quantities, besides Amazon."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Prior to our visit, I was aware of all the poor reviews about the quality of food here.

It's located inside the Victorian era themed Grand Floridian hotel and is a casual dining cafe. It's an open atmosphere that is decorated beautifully, not exactly casual looking; yet it was perfectly acceptable for us to wear shorts and flip flops (I specifically asked because it looked formal). \\nThe food was excellent. I ordered the NY strip steak which was juicy and delicious. It's not a thick cut so you need to order 1 notch rarer to avoid overcooking. It came with mashed red potatoes and broccoli rabe. The mashed potatoes were fluffy, creamy and smooth. Broccoli rabe was also tasty. We also ordered the sirloin and scallops which came with potatoes au gratin and asparagus. The steak was a little thicker than the strip steak and was very juicy. The asparagus and potatoes were delicious too. \\nFrom the kid's menu, we ordered the miso salmon and also the pasta with sauce. My kids never finish their food and usually just picks at them but they finished everything here and commented that we should rate the food 5 stars. \\nFor drinks, I ordered the lemonade with wild berry foam on top. When slowly mixed in, the combination of the fresh but slightly bitter-sour lemonade with the sweet wildberry foam is fabulous. Unfortunately, our server thought I was done and cleared it but I still had 1/4 left!\\nWe also ordered a berry smoothie, also very good. \\nOverall, our server was great. He was very knowledgeable about the food and even told us there are a lot of locals who come here as well as repeat customers who make it a point to stop in the restaurant when driving through Orlando on their trip.

The store was about to close so I only ordered the doughnuts. You can order the following quantities: Four ($3.95)/Six ($5.95)/Eight ($6.95)/Twelve ($8.95). A dozen is the way to go if you want to try everything. When I went, there was cinnamon sugar, raw honey and sea salt, nutella and sea salt, candied bacon maple, the dirty wu (cinnamon sugar with nutella and honey - a combination of three of the flavors) and a seasonal flavor (meyer lemon pear was the seasonal flavor when I went). The sea salt is a great touch to these donuts, while the cinnamon sugar isn't too overwhelming. The dirty wu is one of the best donuts I have ever had, so even if you do not get a dozen, you must get this. The bacon can be a little salty, but it has a sweet maple tasty! The store is a bit far off from central Portland, but it is close to the airport, so you can always order some before your flight. The lines can get pretty long during the weekends, so I suggest planning ahead of time. If you are going to eat them, try to eat the fruit based ones immediately as those can go bad quicker.

Needless to say, the food here is just not that great. Similar to Gueros, the only thing this place has going for it is being on Congress/SoCo--relying on the tourists to stop by. Although substandard, this area has enough foot traffic that it can sustain itself in the competitive Austin food market--regardless of the quality of the food. If you live in Austin or have been here before, you certainly know better.We recently gave Vespaio another go after a prior disappointing experience. I ordered their lunch panini and I am not kidding, it tasted much like what your socks probably smell like after one of those HAM work outs. Vespaio gets a two star rating--as opposed to a one, as they \\"nicely\\" offered replace my order with alternate as it was clear I didn't eat my food. By this point, I had already lost my appetite and thus chose the option to have the item removed from our bill.If you're on Congress, there's plenty of way better options for food on including some of my personal favorites, Perla's (seafood), Home Slice Pizza and Botticelli's (Italian)."},{"name":"San Remo Restaurant","address":"3008 Flint Street, Suite 108","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"3","text":"Pizza is awful.

They also have a sweet check in system where they text message you once your lane is ready. The cost is decent. We paid about $45 for a lane. The cool thing about Topgolf is they let you split the cost up into separate checks SO it was literally around $6 bucks per guy and we played for an hour!

She was expecting a more contemporary pulled or shredded pork. Sadly for her it was a roasted then quick deep fried pork cuts with IMO really nice texture of the crispy outer crust with the juicy rich fattiness of the pork. I order the mesquite wood grilled skirt steak...  now my steak was prepared properly and made to order. However, I was found wanting. I felt the steak was a little on the under seasoned side. Minimal mesquite flavor. Mainly, just the char of the filling and not much else. The seasoned butter was certainly needed to give this steak that next level of flavor. But still I felt it was missing. Maybe I'm just very partial to the \\"real\\" Tex-mex flavor of lime marinated skirt steak. I had my steak accompanied by two lackluster cheese enchiladas.

The food always sucked. I got married here (2nd time) in the late 90s as well. We had about 35-40 people in a comfortable private room. No one expects great food for a wedding but our simulated chicken was inedible for the most part. With the excitement of the event and great company, I wasn't terribly hungry and didn't pay too much attention to the lousy food. The sunset over the lake was fabulous though. My son-in-law, who works in the restaurant business called The Oasis a day or two afterwards and politely explained what was wrong with the meal (everything). To their credit they gave us a nice refund for the meal. Years later when I heard that it burned down, I forwarded the article to my 2nd ex-wife. Like our marriage, The Oasis didn't survive. When it was rebuilt, I heard rumors of a new chef and better food. I've brought some out of town friends here, let's face it, there isn't a better view in the Austin area. Alas, the food still really sucks. I mean you can't even get decent chips and salsa here. Chips are usually stale. Sad that they've been able to keep this sad excuse of a restaurant open only because it has such a great location.

The part of the restaurant we were in was very large and nicely decorated.  It had a fancy/Victorian theme mixed in with a NYC-style loft ambiance (exposed dark pipes/vents that ran above).Need to give our waiter, Jason, a shout-out here.  He was extremely nice, upbeat, and friendly.  He was genuinely happy and that shows when you're working in a customer-service job.  He was very patient with our group of seven, and had recommendations for us also.  A few of us got coffee and he recommended we get two french press pitchers, both of which were amazing (a dark style and light style).Being in Portland, and with more then half the group vegetarian, we weren't worried about finding something to eat.  This place has a ton of veggie options and my friend and I split two brunch entrees:Tofu Hash - unique concept and tasted great.  It's listed under the Eggs section, but there's no eggs in it...it's roasted/grilled veggies and tofu, but their spices and flavors make the veggies and tofu taste delicious.  They were a bit dry, so I added some ketchup and hot sauce to bring more flavor into it.Migas - this dish was huge and super filling.  There are a lot of eggs in this dish and I added jalapenos to it to give it an extra kick.  The chipotle sour  cream was a nice touch.  I also substituted the toast for a biscuit, but I wasn't impressed with it - really chewy and dry.

Everything that we ordered for dinner was bland and lacked flavor. Overall, Toothsome was a wonderful experience and one that is worth going to. Make a few trips to try a few desserts and appetizers, but maybe save your stomach for other food items and skip out on dinner."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"View and atmosphere?

The restaurant gets most of its business during lunch, presumably from workers at the hospital and other nearby businesses.  It's slower in the evenings and weekends.During the daytime, the glass display case next to the ordering counter is filled with various Mediterranean foods such as salads, hummus, baba ghanoush, and dessert pastries.  In my experience, these foods are cleared out at least 1-2 hours before closing time each night (8:30pm).  This sometimes means there will be a limited selection in the evenings.  The restaurant is closed on Sundays.The space is compact and the atmosphere is casual.  The restaurant looks like it's got some years on it.  There's sort of a fast casual setup with a self-serve fountain machine, but if dining in, plates are served to your table.  There are multiple tables on the uncovered sidewalk patio and take-out seems to be a popular option.Fresh 4 U has a small menu, but it manages to capture many Mediterranean staples such as the aforementioned hummus and baba ghanoush, tabbouleh salad, stuffed grape leaves, Greek salad, pita wraps, lamb and chicken gyros, beef and chicken kabobs, and desserts like rice pudding and baklava.  They also sell chicken wings.The menu is affordably priced with no single item over $8.99.  The gyro combos are $8.99 and come with a side and fountain drink.  The pita wraps are mostly $5.99 or less and come with a side.  The food is filling and indeed fresh.I like the Beef Kofta Wrap and the Veggie Falafel Wrap.  Beef kofta consists of ground beef meatballs that have been mixed/marinated in certain spices and onions.  The kofta balls here are big, hearty, and a tad dry with a noticeable smoky flavor from the grill.  The falafel are deep-fried balls made of ground chickpeas and are flavorful and satisfying.  The wraps are neatly packed and presented inside foil wrappers and come with shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, hummus, and tahini sauce (made from lemon, garlic, and sesame seeds).As for sides, I really like Fresh 4 U's tabbouleh salad (\\"tabouli\\" on menu).  I like this salad, commonly made with parsley, tomato, cucumber, mint, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil, in general.  The parsley in Fresh 4 U's version seems to be coarsely chopped, making for a thicker, chewier tabbouleh salad.  It's interesting and a nice change from the more finely minced tabbouleh I'm accustomed to.  The baba ghanoush, made from roasted eggplants, isn't bad either.Service is very good.  The food arrives in a timely manner.A free parking lot is located in the back.  To get there, turn at the light near CVS onto Brighton Rd. and follow it behind the shopping center.While Fresh 4 U isn't as big as a place like Mediterranean Grill or other similar restaurants, it does just fine as a simple cafe.  I give them 3.5 stars rounded up to 4."},{"name":"Nutty Brown Cafe","address":"12225 Hwy 290 W","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Nutty Brown is what it is, SRO, did not expect much from the venue.\\nBut paid $140.00 for 2 tickets for a 70 minute show.

My 99.999% vegetarian friend wanted to go here for her birthday because the chips (with malt vinegar, of course) and onion rings are so bloody good. We had the battered mushrooms for starters, also wonderful!  They even mixed me up a side of Colman's mustard from the powder on request when I branched out and tried the K9 (corn dog) dinner.  As my English friends insist, it is the ONLY mustard.  The fish and chips are also superb, in a humble, traditional way (order to go and you'll get them wrapped in brown paper). Yes, there can be a bit of a wait for your food, especially on Dr. Who trivia night, but  the convivial atmosphere and nerdy charm of the staff (and simple greatness of the food) make it worth the wait.

The presentation of the food is amazing. The drinks are about $12-$14 for a martini but they pour a stiff drink. You get what you pay for. I had the Dancing Eel sushi and my date had the Lobster sushi. Both were amazing. I wish I could describe the flavors given in these rolls. Every ingredient is accounted for and tasted. It was great. The Lobster roll had a small spice kick to it which was great. Not overpowering. Not wasabi hot. I would recommend these two rolls for sure. I had the Cherry Orchard martini & the GA Peach martini.

This is my second time there, and the first time was about the same experience.The only thing that was good about the restaurant was the waitress. She was excellent. Also the atmosphere, very romantic and away from busy crowds etc.The food was such a disappointment this time as well as the previous time. We ordered their signature cheddar bacon soup and poutine fries. The cheddar soup  had a strong bacon taste to it. One of our party members could not finish the soup due to it being so strong. The poutine was very salty.The entrees were the big issue. There were 2 filet mignon ordered, another steak. All the steaks... ALL THE STEAKS were overly salty.  We were shocked. We were even able to notice the chunks of salt crystals. My fiancee steak was undercooked and had to be taken back. Lately with Disney it has been either HIT or MISS with restaurants. We used to have consistent meals accompanied with service, however lately it has been one or the other.So we did not order dessert because we were disappointed with both courses. The other issue was the price. Now, we knew the cost when we got there so we didn't really didn't mind the amount. The issue is where you place the VALUE. This is one of Disney's top steak houses yet our meals where horrible and to value this meal at our satisfaction would offset the price 5 folds. Needless to say, we ate at a local restaurant Cheddar's when we were back home. We got a steak. They cooked it perfectly an the rest of the food was great and it cost us 1/5 of the price (20%).

They still let us in and happily served us a couple icy beers while the kitchen was finalizing their prep.  The owners and other staff are the nicest, friendliest people around.

We ordered a couple pounds of shrimp (mild) and 4 pounds of crawfish (regular).  The shrimp are served \\"head-on\\" so don't let that surprise you when you order them.  I think they're sweeter because of it.*begin rant*  A note to people from Louisianna...no, this is not the way they do crawfish in your home state.  This is Austin, not New Orleans - it's gonna be different, so don't come here expecting it to be the same and don't complain that it isn't.  Get over it or go back to LA for your crawfish.  Just like Austin's Mexican food is Tex-Mex, think of their Cajun food as Tex-Cajun. *end rant*The crawfish and shrimp here are dripping with a spicy, salty, garlicky butter sauce with fresh onions and a touch of celery flavor.  It will be running down your arms all the way to your elbows by the time you're done.  Hot tip:  Don't wear a good shirt or, if you do, take them up on their offer of a bib.The steaming food brought to the table smelled so incredible and our mouths were watering big-time.  Hubby kept trying to behead his shrimp before letting them cool a bit, repeatedly burning his fingers and cursing but it sure didn't stop him or slow him down much.Our shrimp and crawfish were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I ate 4 lbs of crawfish by myself, that's how amazing they are.  Each 2lbs comes with a small potato, ear of corn, mushrooms, and a few slices of sausage.  Some places serve more but I'm not really looking to eat potatoes and vegetables when I go out for crawfish so it's fine with me.  I usually give them to my husband anyway.Did you know it takes a woman approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes to eat 4 lbs of crawfish?  The great part is that they were brought to the table piping hot and in a plastic bag, so that the last crawfish was actually still warm.We left (rolled ourselves to the door) around 6:40pm and the place was getting pretty crowded with only a couple tables left open.  I'm so glad to see their business is booming as I hope to keep coming here for many years.Unemployed or not, there's no way I'm staying away from the Crawfish Shack for so long ever again.

My sister, who lives in the area, and Yelp both suggested Mike's Pastry as a place worth paying a visit.  I'm not big on many pastries, but I succumbed. I felt that I just couldn't be in the North End of Boston without sampling some of the famous pastries. When we walked in, we were overwhelmed. There were people taking pictures of the vast selection of pastries. There were tourists getting their pictures taken in front of the vast selection of pastries. I may or may not have given in and done the same. It wasn't terribly crowded at 6 PM on a Saturday, which surprised me; I was expecting a long line.The way it's set up is you walk up to any of the many people behind the counter. You say what you want. You give them cash (it's cash only). They package up your sweet goodness into a box and use string/twine from these globes hanging from the ceiling to securely wrap up your delicious pastry present. After some hemming and hawing, I decided on the mint chocolate chip cannoli based on my sister's recommendation. She decided to get the chocolate cheesecake. Mint chocolate chip cannoli. Omg. It was heavenly. Also, it was really quite large! It is easy to share (that's what my sister and I ended up doing). The crust is flaky and the filling is what made it really stand out to me. Mint perfection with a very liberal amount of mini chocolate chips smushed onto both ends of the pastry. I felt genuinely sad when I finished eating it. This was the best cannoli I have ever had! On my last day in Boston, I almost took a bus and a train all the way back here just to get more.Cheesecake. It was really big, which was exciting. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed by the taste. It definitely wasn't bad at all--just average. Maybe I was expecting something outrageously delicious after having had the mint chocolate chip cannoli. So, despite the slightly disappointing cheesecake and the fact that it's cash only, the amazing cannoli I had keeps this place at five stars. If I ever find a better cannoli, maybe I'll update this review. Until then, Mike's Pastry is crowned cannoli king."},{"name":"Torched Hop Brewing","address":"249 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Haley is an OUTSTANDING bartender, and Barry manages bar like no other. \\nWe were in town for the Shaky Knees festival, but after 3 nights coming here for a post-festival drink, it's safe to say that this spot was equally worth the trip to Atlanta.

They have fully embraced a steampunk theme and chocolate can be found on every page of the menu, not just in desserts (of which they have many, of course). That combination makes them extremely popular, so you can expect long waits at busy times. On our first night there we stopped in to take a look and wound up strolling through the gift shop/candy store and bought a mini chocolate cake to take back to the room. So rich we kept going back to it for a few days.When you sit in the dining room you can probably expect to be visited by the loquacious owner and her steampunk robot for a greeting and chat. Kids will love them and they are an entertaining duo. We found all the waitstaff and bartenders to be just as personable and friendly when we visited.When we had dinner I didn't want an iced cocktail due to the cold weather, and our server recommended an Espresso Martini, which was as tasty and satisfying as it sounds. My wife ordered a flaky Sole Almondine which she kept thinking about several days later. She devoured it so quickly she felt guilty for not offering me a bite. I had the Gnocchi in a Mole sauce (an easy go-to for the chocolate theme) which was delicious.We never managed to stop in for breakfast, but we did swing in for a milkshake to enjoy in the parlor up front.

Then other improvements would be the boat house, the new areas, the shopping area and the friendly cast members pointing out attractions and things to do for you and your family.  Disney Springs is a complete say in itself and it is free to walk around.  They have the worlds largest Disney store, lego world, shops that sell Disney merchandise no matter what you are looking for and some of the hottest restaurants and bars are all located right in this area.  Some of my favorite restaurants are T-Rex, Wolfgang Puck and the Boathouse, but no matter what you are looking for they have it here!

There is easy parking since it's in a strip mall, the restaurant is clean, and I've always been seated quickly. The space is handicap accessible, but the tables are a bit cramped inside if you have trouble navigating around smaller spaces. The staff there are WONDERFUL though and I'm sure they'd be very accommodating to support you in anyway needed. My favorite place to sit is up at the bar. There are TV's to keep you occupied, and you can watch everything going on in the kitchen. If you're eating solo, there is always at least one seat at the bar ready to go regardless of what time it is. My go-to order is the Pho with Rare Steak. The broth has a great depth of flavor, and even though I always add in a TON of spice to make it super spicy I always take a few sips to savor the original broth. Everything always comes out really quickly, steaming hot, and the servers consistently provide great service. I haven't tried many things on the menu other than the Pho but I do like all the different Pho's, the Beef Bahn Mi, and the spring rolls. If you need anything substituted out the servers are also super helpful and will do anything to make you happy.

I'd always been allured and curious by its glimmering signage, the gold capital letters, dark interior, and the many patrons snacking on brunch food beneath the various patio umbrellas. It wasn't until recently that I had the motivation to try out the menu with some friends on a Sunday morning. My review is based on two experiences with Cambridge Common, one as less positive dine-in brunch and the other as a positive catering order.In my first experience at Cambridge Commons, I ordered the french toast with chopped potatoes and a side salad. What I didn't expect was the french toast to be overly sweet, with several mounds of whipped creme, and potatoes to be big and less flavorful with each bite. I left feeling disappointed because I had wanted to like Cambridge Common.My next experience came not too shortly afterward during a catered meal. Upon sampling the orders, I quickly concluded that the catering order was delicious: we ordered Mac and Cheese Bites, Caprese Wraps, Sliders with Thousand Island sauce, and Tater Tots. My personal favorite were the Mac and Cheese Bites fried outsides with creamy cheesy insides (think Kraft Mac and Cheese).After these two experiences, I believe Cambridge Common functions as a late-night spot for favorite bites and bar food, but as a brunch spot, it doesn't quite live up to some of the other businesses around Harvard and Porter Square. I, for one, will be ordering takeout soon and definitely hope to be reunited with their delicious Mac and Cheese Bites."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"672 S Gaines St, Ste 2","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Everyone seemed extremely excited to be having donuts in the area.

They fresh as well but I really didn't like the taste. The staff was extremely nice and appeared happy and helpful.  I do believe that $3.50 plus per donut is high.

Zaftigs is a name you hear all the time in the world of Boston-area Brunch.I brunch a lot. Maybe too much, in the eyes of some. Naturally, when my Long Island raised mom came to visit, I figured Zaftigs was the place to go. The most important thing any potential customer should know is there will ALWAYS be a wait. I have gone on weekdays, weekends, peak hours and non-peak hours, and have always waited for a table. On this fine Sunday morning, we waited for about 45 minutes, which is easy to do with the good amount of local shops and attractions in the general vicinity.It was a particularly cold day, so we were extra excited when we were finally called inside. We sat at a nice corner booth right by the bakery case, and were greeted by a very friendly server. We started with the potato pancakes (of course), and followed up with some corn beef hash and eggs. All of our food was quick, cooked well, and fresh. Service was fast and friendly.I am torn between 3 and 4 stars for Zaftigs, only because I do not think that it always lives up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, the brunch was good, the service was good, the ambiance is good, but nothing stood out to me as to why I waited almost an hour to sit down.

Laughable is that they offer 1/2 sandwiches, I guess some people are looking for finger sandwiches.  Making things worse is that the price for these thin sandwiches is plus sized. The decor is nice and newly redone, but doesn't feel like you would want to linger around and BS with your pals.

It's a shame because it could actually be a fun place with some changes.Tried it once on a Saturday night for drinks and the service was pretty bad.  It took forever for our drinks to come and there was some mix-up cashing out where they brought us someone else's tab and the waitress disappeared for an eternity to fix it.  Not sure what happened, if she took an impromptu trip to Guam or fell down and was concussed but after a while she finally brought us the right check.  I went back again for Sunday brunch and it was empty -- I'm talking there were maybe six people in there -- yet some how the service was even worse.  You must suck pretty hard if you offer bad service on a busy night and even poorer service on an empty morning.

A couple nights ago my friends and I were followed out of Keegan's in Vinings by Sean (the manager/possible owner of this location) and falsely accused of not leaving a tip.  He asked us about our experience of the service because his server had not been tipped.  We were immediately taken aback and confused because everyone in our group had tipped the waitress.  Once we explained that we did in fact tip on our food and drinks, Sean went back inside.  The fact that he followed us out of the restaurant with this false accusation was highly disturbing so we decided to follow up and seek further clarification.  I spoke with Sean again and requested that he pull our receipts to help us understand why we were accused of not tipping. We explained that we felt uncomfortable about being followed, approached, and falsely accused, particularly when tipping is not a requirement to begin with.  Upon pulling our receipts he apologized and stated that we did in fact tip the server.  He clarified that one of my friends (who had multiple tabs throughout the night) did not tip on one of them which consisted of a couple of beers.  We spoke at length with Sean about his decision to follow us out of the restaurant regarding this matter and how uncomfortable it made us feel. I have never in my life been followed out of a restaurant and quite frankly found it disheartening with us being a group of Black patrons in a predominately White setting.  Sean attempted to reassure us that his actions had nothing to do with us being Black and offered to take care of us the next time we came in.  My husband and our friends were excited to have a bar with karaoke within walking distance from our homes but after the way we were treated we will NEVER be returning.  We will take our business to McCray's Tavern, our other neighborhood bar who also has Karaoke Thursdays and not to mention much better food and service.

The problem with my plan was: (a) I really dislike lines and after three attempts, I pretty much gave up ordering a cannoli from Mike's. The crowds were that big and loud during the morning, noon and night. \\n(b) I'm no cannoli expert, and even though I have a huge sweet tooth, I couldn't even finish one cannoli from Modern. After spending time in both shops, it was funny to observe that Modern actually feels quite a bit more old school than Mike's. When I arrived there was only one clerk behind the counter. Passing by later one evening, the line was out the door, so since it is a smaller place, you may actually have to wait longer here, since Mike's is better set up for crowds if you can tolerate the chaos.Rather than being pre-made, at Modern your cannoli is filled to order once you select the type (I went with chocolate dipped).

We came right when they opened around 8ish and there was a short line already. I was reading their Yelp highlights and saw this \\"Dirty Wu\\" (same as my last time Wu) and instantly wanted to try it. Me and my BF shared 8 mini doughnuts. We got every flavor ( Candied Bacon & Maple, Raw Honey and Sea Salt, Lemon, Dirty Wu, and Nutella) and extra Dirty Wu and Raw Honey&Sea salt. My favorites are Raw Honey&Sea Salt and Maple Bacon. I am not a big fan of honey but I really enjoy this flavor. The saltiness of sea salt balanced well with the sweetness of honey. The honey was also not overly sweetened. one thing I notice is that honey is not spread all over the donuts so you can still taste the original flavor of donuts while enjoy the honey flavor on the bottom part without getting messy. I also love their bacon donuts. There is this bacon jam in the middle of donuts and a crispy bacon strip. I do not even eat bacon that much and I was worried that donuts/bacon combo would be gross since I had a bad experience before in other donuts shop. However, bacon donuts here were definitely phenomenal. Must Try. I also ordered their matcha latte and I really enjoyed it. It is not too sweet so you can still get to enjoy your donuts. When we finished eating around 9am, there was already a long line waiting outside the shop.

I should start by saying that we came here because my friends were visiting from out of town and heard that the cannolis were fantastic. I could not eat any myself because I practice a vegan diet, but they said that it was delicious. The shell was crispy and flakey, and the filling was creamy and not overwhelmingly sweet. I had asked a woman at the front if there were any vegan options (out of curiosity, I had a feeling that the answer would be no but I thought it was worth a sho!) she said no but then proceeded to go on a tirade of why veganism is flawed and began berating me about my diet and that I must be sick, etc etc. I felt very uncomfortable and stepped out so avoid any conflict."},{"name":"Zeta Bar & Sushi Lounge","address":"14100 Bonnet Creek Resort Ln","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I came to Zeta for their magical dining menu. This restaurant is located in the Hilton hotel near Disney, so there is complimentary valet parking if you get the restaurant to stamp your parking card. For the magical dining menu you do get a 4 course meal of starter, appetizer, entree, and dessert for $35! We got the ginger salad, the dumplings and sushi's, bimbimbap, and key lime creme brûlée. Our server was Christine and she was so friendly and attentive to our table!! The ginger salad was very refreshing and they even make the ginger dressing homemade in the kitchen. The dumplings and sushi were incredible and so flavorful that we devoured it within 5 minutes. (We even ordered more sushi after) I've had bimbimbap at authentic Korean restaurants and the short rib bimbimbap here was subpar, I felt like it could be a lot better. What I thought they can change with the dish is to make it less saucy. There was too much sauce from the kimchi mixed with the red sauce you use to top off the bimbimbap. The sauciness made it too salty for my taste and almost felt like a rice soup. To finish off, the key lime creme brûlée was glorious!! I am such a fan of creme brûlée in general and they made this dish flawless, even the presentation was beautiful. The combination of key lime pie and creme brûlée was very neat. The service was amazing and made the experience so smooth. My family would definitely come back for the sushi and creme brulee!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"4615 N Lamar Blvd, Ste 307","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I think that I've previously reviewed Hopdoddys but at the S Congress Location.

They didn't have the terlingua burger that I had always adored. So I tried the habanero burger since I like spicy stuff. It wasn't as spicy as I had liked, but the base of the burger is amazing. Great meat, right proportions, exact seasoning, and a bun that does not crumble. We tried sweet potato fries this time instead of the truffle fries and they were amazing as well. The dipping sauce wasn't my cup of tea, but they were good on their own.

So I called the phone number listed on the menu. Well now a young lady with an ugly attitude came out of the bathroom.

Add chicken for an additional charge).  I'm not sure if they just don't care about the quality of delivered food, but this was not good for multiple reasons. 1) For the price I expected actual Tuna, not imitation Starkist.  After re-reading the description I realize this was my error, but still.  The tuna was terrible.  I would've been better off cracking open a can of Starkist and using that instead.  Since I couldn't eat that I moved on to the egg.  Pretty hard to mess up a hard boiled egg, right?  Wrong.  They managed to do just that.  One part of the egg was so rubbery I couldn't easily bite through it.  So now I have tuna scrapped to the side, and egg spit out.  I thought a safe bet would be just lettuce and green beans, but I was wrong.  The green beans had some giant brown spots on them.  I don't know what this restaurant looks like from the outside, but the quality of the salad was less than what you would expect from a \\"Tony's Pizza\\" restaurant.

The next dish that arrived was the beef and broccoli which is one of my favorite go to dishes. I enjoyed how they prepared the beef thinly and it was very tender and cooked with semi crunchy broccoli. My issue with this dish was that it was okay, it needed some Chinese style oyster sauce cooked in to bring in that sweet flavor.

I clearly told the waiter twice we did not need any drinks or tea as we already had tea/coffee. When we got the bill at the end, I felt I was overcharged but it was difficult to figure out what we were charged for on the bill as there were no descriptions.I learned that they charged me $4+ for tea, even though there was no tea on our table, they charged for a take out bag which I had never asked for, etc. The manager finally corrected the bill, but somehow she added mysterious few more dollars before tax. When I informed her the calculation was incorrect, she replied that she was charging me for water (tap water!). It was unbelievable, so I told her she could not charge me for tap water when I was paying for the entire meal. Overall, it was a terrible dining experience with horrible customer service. The price for most each dimsum cost about $5 and up, but there is no menu or price for dimsum unless you ask. The manager was sneaky and dishonest about charging customer. There was no apology but only demand for more money for things we did not consume and tips for horrible customer service. We will never return.

Someone came over a few minutes later staring at us weird. I asked them if they would like to sit as well. They then brought over another friend to tell us the spot was reserved. There was no indication that it was reserved and since this was my first time here, how were we to know? A few minutes later, the bouncer came over to tell us the spot was reserved after we were already up and had moved to stand by the bar. There seemed to be a lot of attitude there. Why not put a sign down or is this something all first timers are supposed to know?So now as we stood by the bar, we were not acknowledged for roughly 10-15 minutes. I guess we did not have a prime spot but we were still standing there with our drinks on the bar. The drinks we had were not very good either. I had a vodka soda and it tasted like the soda was a bit old. The draught beer was nothing exciting, which I thought was interesting since they have samplers.We finally gave up on drinks and asked for the check, which took another 20 minutes to get and they already had my card.Overall, I was super disappointed.

I have picked it up on several occasions for game night and it has always been a hit.  And, I love how cooking it at home fills the house with Italian smells!So, a couple of nights ago I was at a friends house to help pick out the flower arrangements for her wedding and was surprised to smell the heavenly smell of pizza cooking.  I did not want to ask \\"what the hell are doing eating pizza on your Lose 15 More Pounds Before the Wedding Diet?\\" But, she must have read my thoughts because she explained that she had picked up a Papa Murphy's deLITE Pizza - \\"a thin crispy crust with 1/2 the carbs and calories\\".  I was pretty apprehensive until I tasted the first bite. We had the Hawaiian with Canadian bacon and pineapple and it was just as good as the regular just with a different crust.  I actually like more toppings and sauce ratio to dough; so, I think the thin crust is my new favorite. I looked up the nutritional value on the website and it says only 150 calories for a slice of the Hawaiian.  That means I can eat a whole pie!  Right?"},{"name":"The Living Room","address":"101 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Where do I begin? Let's start with the fact that 3 days later, I still don't know what was more offensive, our waitress's outfit, or that she gave herself a 25% tip and then disappeared. Or maybe it was when she awkwardly snarked that she refuses to work weekends because the place is so packed with drunk people that she gets annoyed she's sober which parlayed into her complaining that it was so slow that night they had to send one of the other girls home and she still wasn't making any money. Well, I'm glad we're besties here lady, but oh, that's right, WE JUST MET, so can I order my beverage now? If you didn't want us to sit in the back (empty) section, you should have just told us that. We would have squeezed in at the bar. But since you DID let us sit back here, maybe you should be a little bit more proactive about making that money you seem to be so pissed about. Like, maybe offer more beers when the glasses sit empty for a while. It's a start. And while we're discussing appropriate behavior, may I remind you that the whole premise of your workplace (of choice) is \\"lounge\\". There are comfy couches everywhere. Couches that are lower to the ground than barstools. Much lower to the ground. So much so that maybe you should rethink the whole mini skirt/fishnet stocking look you had going on. I'm glad you're exercising your right to wardrobe freedom, but thank god we didn't work for the health department. Or the FCC. Now that I've got that off my chest, I'm aware that I can't let one waitress dictate my opinion on an entire establishment. But truth be told, The Living Room has always been just a 3 star establishment in my eyes. I've never gone out of my way to go there, but whenever I found myself in the North End, we'd always invariably end up here post dinner, and I was ok with that. As long as it's not packed, The Living Room is actually a pretty good place to let your carb filled belly relax, while pouring just a little bit more wine down your throat. So this will bring me back to our waitress. The rant above touches on attire and table side manner, but honestly, those are things that would have been completely overlooked if the end of the night hadn't wound up the way it did. When it was time to get our bill, we asked for the 4 beers to be run through on a card, and stated that the $26 bottle of wine would come out of the cash. She left with 1 debit card, and $40. A few minutes later, another waitress dropped off the check presenter. Inside was only the debit card. Ok, that's a little strange, but maybe she was confused by what we meant and deducted the cash from the WHOLE bill, then put the rest on the card. A quick scan showed that the card was charged for all 4 beers. Still strange, but maybe she had to find change. So we finished up our wine while happily watching the Olympics. Ten minutes later, still no sign of her.   A walk to the front, still no sign of her.  Apparently, she thought she deserved a $14 tip on our $56 check. I'm going to stick with that thought, rather than assume she also wanted the boys to have tipped her on the credit card. Because while I'm a little peeved about the presumption of a 25% tip, I'd be livid about the presumption of the 53% tip she actually took out of our cash. Unless she is using the money to buy a longer skirt. In that case, I take this entire review back!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was headed to another bakery and the overdriver said you should try Mike's.

The spice killed the flavor and there was not much as far as texture which is soo big for me. \\n- octopus. Tasted very good but I've had better. Maybe grill a little longer so it has more texture?

If you go only to Jarra's, ornever get off Broadway, you're missing a LOT.For North African food - Egyptian dishes - I like Mummy's downtown, and it's a 2 for 1 dinner with an Entertainment Card - but it's SO distinctly Mediteranean, in comparison. The food is nowhere as stunning, nurturing, and memorable as any Ethiopian specialities.  The favorites usually presented are inspired by spices historically traded by Ship (and Camel caravans) between hemispheres,  The spices are highly prized and traded between all Asian nations...including India.  Visiting Spice Markets is a great thing to do when traveling.  Ethiopian is excellent take-out food; but I like eating in.  The simple, gentle-spirited  hospitality settings are peaceful and your Hosts enjoy seeing you discover the superb flavors. The beauty and serenity of the Hosts kind of goes with this comfort-food.

Linger for Tea and conversation after dinner.\\nEnjoying tea and sharing smiles are African traditions.How to eat it:Spoon a generous portion from serving bowls - onto the tray lined with Injera (if it's not already that way) - in the middle of the table so all can share.  Eat with your clean right hand...by tearing a small piece of soft bread first.  Use it to scoop a modest bite,, and tap an edge of bread in a skiff of sauce, so that's first to touch your tounge.At Jarra's and one on Broadway - ASK for Family Style - or you may get a boring western plate and fork presentation...which is just NOT Ethiopian eating.   I promise you'll like Family style better....\\nunless you are trying to keep MY hands off your food!Feel free to use a fork at home, however, as the juices in your leftovers may be mushy in the Injera, and you'll still want to eat it all, even if it's falling apart.  (I leave NO sauce-infused Ijnera on the serving tray, no matter how gooey or messy.  It's just TOO good!)Use the #6 Bus.  MLK Blvd has it going on.Where else to get great Ethiopian...In Washington DC.  Great Ethopian cafes were near my former Howard U RowHouse. You'll find several in Adams Morgan. notably The Red Sea, and another right across the street (go upstairs in both)  Also I like  U Streets - Twins. They do lovely Saffron Rice dishes, downstairs, with flavors more delicate than the hefty Ethiopian Berbere spices.  Live Jazz, and an oddly-Americanized bar menu are in the upstairs bar...if you are too boring or too cheap to buy a full dinner, $12-20.

The hubby and I decided to visit Austin and were told to go visit the Oasis. As we drove towards Lake Travis, I immediately started noticing and enjoying the surroundings. Surrounded by greenery and some beautiful houses, the Oasis is a fun destination and totally a must for those who visit Austin. Whereas downtown Austin lives up to it's 'Dirty 6' reputation of being somewhat grimy and overcrowded, Lake Travis and the Oasis was beautiful. The staff was super friendly and helpful, and were fast with food and drinks. There's a huge selection of craft beer and tons of good eats - we opted for corn bites, beer queso, and the mixed vegetables which were absolutely delicious. The Oasis is a series of shops and restaurants - we went to the brewery, walked around and noticed a lot of shops are closed and vacant - so don't set super high expectations. The reason I'm giving this place a 5 is because of the fun time you can have on the patio. If the weather is nice outside, you HAVE to sit on the patio. It's the view that's totally worth it. My husband and I had so much fun hanging out, enjoying the fresh air, and having a few drinks in the sun.

I walked in, and the decor was the first thing I noticed.  Very cute and true to the martial arts theme.  It was a bit messy, though.  There were only about 3-4 tables that were occupied but the front of the shop had chairs strewn about everywhere.  I'd already had some coffee for the day, but I really wanted a sandwich.  There appeared to be two employees working who either didn't know what they were doing or they just didn't care.  It took me quite a while to get through the line even though there were only two people in front of me when I walked in.When I finally got up to the counter, I ordered, and paid, and the guy walked away.  Not having been there before, I wasn't sure what to do.  Do I stand here until they make my sandwich?  Do I go sit down?  I decided to go find a table. One of the employees brought out my sandwich in a plastic clamshell.  \\"Oh, did you want this for here?\\", he said. \\"Yes,\\" I replied.  He said he'd go get me a plate.  He returned with a saucer that did not even fit the sandwich and a cocktail napkin.  On the flip side, the sandwich was pretty darn good.I guess I would maybe stop in again before I leave town, but my expectations are pretty low at this point.  I also agree with the previous reviewer who said that maybe the grumpiness of the employees stems from the silly outfits that they have to wear."},{"name":"Panda Express","address":"11192 SW Barnes Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"When it comes to Big chain fast food, I don't give many 4 star reviews.

And I'm not sure if the Beef was cooked in the soup.

Seriously! The quality of their food is on point, their customer services goes above and beyond, and the space is cool and hip. When it comes to their location at Easton, there's no exception. Even before you walk in the main entrance, you know it's something awesome. There's a fireplace that's on during the colder months, which helps a lot when there's a line out the door. I mean, the place has to be something special if there's a line out the door in thirteen-degree weather or six inches of snow.  As you inch closer to the register to place your order, you walk by their mouthwatering baked goods. When your gut instinct says to get one of those chocolate chip cookies with sea salt, trust it! If your mind won't let go of their fruit filled scones, just get one. Treat yoself! After placing your order you can grab a beverage and a seat, they will bring your food to you once it's prepared. The dining room is pretty much shaped like a circle, with seating all around it. There's also a second level that allows you to look down over the rest of the dining area. The bar is really nice too. See folks, they have alcohol here! I recently told my dad that and he got really excited about visiting Northstar again. He had no clue. As a vegetarian, I love the variety of different entrees I can order here. Their Buddha bowl is amazing. Rice, fresh veggies, and tofu covered in a thai peanut sauce. The broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower are always steamed but with a little crunch to them still and the texture of the tofu is spot on. Their veggie burger is also a huge hit. You seriously can't go wrong. Same goes for any of their salads. It's all so simple but every bite leads to a dance party on your tongue.

Don't know if the bread is made in-house, but it was fresh and delicious, and the basil-oil complemented it perfectly. The shrimp scampi were excellent. So many places add too much garlic, such that the garlic overwhelms, but the Parma version allowed the shrimp to shine, with only a hint of fresh garlic nicely accenting. And the olive oil/garlic sauce itself was so good that we consumed nearly every last drop of it. The meatballs. For years I've said that the meatballs at Riffs are the best in the greater Boulder area. They are fantastic, no doubt about it, but Parma's meatballs are even better. (Hadn't thought that possible.) The meatballs arrived in a bowl filled with sugo. That sugo. Happy thoughts just thinking about it. A little cup of that same sugo was served with the fried calamari. We often order calamari, ubiquitous as it is, at various places, because it usually offers a good litmus test for the rest of the food. The calamari at Parma was only very slightly breaded (excellent!), cooked perfectly so that it was perfectly tender, and served piping hot. Best fried calamari we've had in quite a while.A truly excellent meal, a lovely experience. We recommend it without question or reservation."},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I went here with some friends during my birthday weekend. There was an hour wait for a bay so we went and sat at the bar and ordered food and drinks. I would definitely say it's extremely over priced but the food is amazing and the drinks are weak. I spent over $70 on my own for two drinks.I had the Top Golf Margarita and I would not recommend. I then tried the Don Julio Pineapple Mint Margarita (2) which was stronger than the first but still weak.Let me preface by saying the menu looked so good I ordered a few items, and they were all fantastic I just wish the prices were a tad bit lower so I didn't have heart palpitations when I got the check.I ordered the Bacon Mac n Cheese Spring Rolls, Buffalo Chicken Sliders, and the Cheddar Stuffed Sliders. Funny story, of course I couldn't eat it all so I left it in my car and ended up throwing 75% of it out. I hate my life, lol. When we got the text that our bay was ready we just received all our food. Did I mention my friend ordered some items too!Thankfully our waiter helped us bring everything to our table.  A staff member walked us through everything and introduced us to our hostess.I don't know if it was the patron shots or if I should've been a professional golfer because I didn't do bad for my first try.This place is expensive so I wouldn't make it a weekly thing but it's definitely a lot of fun and different from the usual."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came here on Wednesday at about 9PM.

I like that the doughnuts are small, so I can eat more and it's enjoyable. This is speaking from someone who is not really into sweets. They had seasonal special: chili mango.

It was a Saturday, early evening, so we knew there would be a wait but we didn't mind. There was a line just to get to the hostess stand. When the couple in front of us reached the hostess, we heard her offer them immediate seating in the bar area  next to the restaurant where there was live music, or they could wait for a regular table. Then when my boyfriend and I got to her she just handed us a pager and asked for the name. We were both a little weirded out that she didn't offer us any options....we probably should have asked but decided we really didn't care that much, it just seemed very odd. We got some drinks and took in the view which was lovely, however, the place was so busy it kind of took away from the ambiance of the view. I had a margarita, which was really delicious.At our table, the service was HORRIBLE. this was probably the worst service I have ever had. Our server was not rude, but just very un-attentive and slow. He never took our drink orders and never brought us chips and salsa (after I saw ALL the table around us with some I flagged him down and asked for some). He took forever to come back over to take our food order and our food took forever to come out. By this time the restaurant had slowed down quite a bit.  I am really understanding if servers are busy, what bothered me was that lack of communication. He could have at least come over to apologize for the wait and see if we needed any drinks, but instead, he seemed to just ignore us. Finally our food arrives, and the food was terrible. I got the fajitas, which for around $18 I expected to be really good. I know you pay so much at The Oasis for the view, but I do expect a decent meal. This, however, was pretty bad.  When we were about halfway through with our meals and clearly still eating, the server came over to ask if we wanted any dessert or anything else........I usually like to finish my meal before deciding that. Finally, the night is over and once again we have a long wait for our check. Theo only good thing about this place is the view and the margaritas. However, the view you can get  at one of the other restaurants nearby with much better service and food. I have been to Soleil which is excellent (I don't know if it is the same owners or not but it is by far a much better experience)."},{"name":"Cartopia Food Carts","address":"1200 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is by far my favorite food cart pod in Portland.

This used to be the best. It's still excellent, as long as you stick to their best dishes. The steaks are star. Avoid the poutine, and do everyone a favor on the wake up call for them: Send the bread back if it's stale and/or dry. They fall down more on Canadian staples like the poutines. What's a poutine? French fries smothered in gravy and cheese curds that are as Canadian as, well, not Apple pie, but, yeah poutine. Theirs is too arty, and the fries, lifeblood of the dish, would make a Québécois want to pull a pomme de terre from their Disney bag, run in, cut it, fry it and then haughtily wipe their hands, muttering \\"paysons\\" (peasants) as they satisfactorily strut back to their table of limp fries and ancien, non-squeaky-wonderful cheese curds.  Their beer cheese soup, when first introduced, was so good that it became their hallmark dish, served to the paysons (See, you learned some French reading this. Like Rosetta Stone, with reviews!) paying for tiny sample cups at Food & Wine Festival outside the restaurant in the Fall. Today it is a gritty, lifeless shadow of its former self. Even the pretzel breads seem more Disney-Park-Stale and less authentic. When you're paying Five-Star restaurant prices, you should get five star food. Relative to their other restaurants on property, this is still the best for atmosphere and a few winners on the menu, but the Japanese hibachi place has better food overall. If you had one to pick, I'd go there until they kick the cobwebs off of this place.If you're hankering for great steaks on your Mouse meal plan, the best in the system remains Shula's at Swan & Dolphin Hotel. This is still one of the top ten restaurants on the properties.

As Yuna mentioned, they do Russian/French cuisine here. I sat down for a 9 course meal.Here's the thing: when you eat a 9 course meal (one you pay $90 a plate for, not one you construct at home by snacking from boxes the way I do many nights a week) you don't eat much at each course. I went here for my senior prom so I don't really remember a lot of specifically what the courses were. There was a cheese course, with a bunch of weird cheeses. The main course was a pheasant or a quail or something and I remember not eating much of it because there wasn't a lot of meat. It was damn pretty, but not a lot of meat.These waiters are beyond pro. For each of the 9 courses, there were 3-4 choices that each person at the table could select, all of which were itemized before the first course was served. The waiter explained each dish to us one at a time and memorized what each person chose for each of the 9 courses without pausing or writing anything down. We had 8 people in our party. So one guy remembered 72 specific choices. I don't remember anyone complaining they'd gotten the wrong thing. Some Houdini shit, brah. I'm sayin'.Every time you take a sip of water at Nikolai's Roof, someone comes to reach over your shoulder and replace the sip you took. YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE A FULL WATER GLASS AT NIKOLAI'S.Also, when you get up to go the restroom, they come behind you and take your napkin and refold it into a little hat, so it's waiting there for you when you come back. Furthermore: women get roses when you come in. There is a dress code. These things must tell you something. For dessert (this I remember vividly) they brought out these huge tiers towering with all kinds of super-rich desserts and pastries, from which you could choose which one you wanted. I think there were like 9 choices. I wanted one of each, but did not get them.I think after we left here, after the 9 courses, I was still hungry. I think I tried to make us go to McDonald's before the dance. You don't really go to Nikolai's to get full like a fat American: you go for the strange experience of the courses they bring.I started to give this place 4 stars, but how can you give a 9 course meal 4 stars? It has to be a five. Bring your wallet."},{"name":"Kneeland Cafe","address":"75 Kneeland St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Joe at Kneeland Cafe is seriously the best!

On my latest trip, my friends and I were going to Drink Around the World in Epcot and what better place to end up then in the final country of Canada and dining at Le Cellier. Le Cellier has always been a tough reservation to snag, that usually must be made the full 180 days out from your trip. So plan accordingly! Even with a reservation, my friends and I had to wait about ten minutes to be seated.Le Cellier is one of those places after dining you think to yourself, what took me so long to eat here!? They are known for their steaks and cheese soup, but really everything we had made our palates happy. Our server was very accommodating and checked in on us at just the right pace & just the right amount. This restaurant can get a bit loud as it's a lot of tables in the semi-crowded dining room, but it was a good mix of families, couples, groups - a little bit of everything. Being who I am, I had to get the Beer Trio Flight for $12.50 to start things off for dinner....And finish things off for Drinking Around the World! This flight came with samples of Ephemere, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles -  a good mix of ales with surprisingly strong potencies. Highly recommend this flight if you're a beer person! Again, being who I am, and having to try the 'popular and hot' item at new places I visit, I went for the Cheese Soup. A bowl of this soup ran $11 made with Moosehead beer, Nueske's Applewood-smoked bacon and a whole lot of cheddar cheese! The portion wasn't huge for the pricetag but was a bit more hearty than I expected. I liked this but am not sure it's worthy of the endless raves it receives. Honestly, I'd opt to try new starters on my next trip to Le Cellier than get this again.I had the Seasonal Salad Appetizer as my main dish for $14 as I don't have a huge appetite and it was just the right amount of food for me. It had a great balance of fruits and sweets - just loved it. This item will change quite frequently so not getting into every ingredient but know they married together nicely.I tried some of my friend's Le Cellier Signature Coffee-rubbed Black Angus Rib-Eye ($54) and we all agreed it was quite tasty with great accompaniments. Another friend had the Le Cellier Signature Poutine ($10) and it was classic with the twist of some truffle oil giving it a great flavor. Another friend got the Smoked Mac & Cheese ($10) which I liked but didn't love though it was adorably served in a little pan!All in all, loved the service, liked the food and wouldn't hesitate dining here again. However for four of us this meal ran us $300 for 4 adults with drinks, no desserts. So to answer my initial question, what took me so long to dine here?! I would venture to say the price put me off a bit! ha! It's a good meal and we enjoyed our time here, but familiarize yourself with the costs to avoid sticker shock."},{"name":"Merguez Restaurant","address":"11951 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"It is good for I-drive area that tends to be overpriced and poor quality.

Fries are frozen not fresh. Wraps are close, but should be chopped and tossed together w sauce before wrapping. Fried food is bland. It's all bland. Uh, seasoning?  Pizza is very solid if fresh (slices can get old as they sit out in back). Meals such as chicken tenders and pasta dishes are frozen and then fried or boiled, can be done well, but just not a B as they're not fresh or tasteful. Also there is a poor choice of chips and such for lunch - a bag of lays? Really?This place would rock if run right, but these guys don't have it down. It's averaging 2-3 stars for a reason.

I asked where the second slice was and the girl said they only had one slice left. I mentioned to her that i was told that there were a few pepperoni slices too and I even watched the guy go check.

First off, the line gets long and busy at lunch so try and go outside those traditional hours.  What I loved most was their mission and values (in addition to the chicken!) A staff member approached us and informed us that all employees were all in some form of recovery/rehabilitation and it translates into the amount of pride they take in their work and food.  So besides that...the food is truly on point.  The chicken is better than anything I've had in New England.  They also gave us cole slaw and mac n' cheese...this was just TOO much food.  I recommend getting sides which you can share.

Food (8/10)(8/10) Roasted Red Pepper Hummus\\nWith warm pita, basil, olives and Aleppo pepper. This appetizer was delicious. The hummus was very flavorful and where was a generous amount of it. We enjoyed the bits of real red pepper in it, and the presentation was pretty too. The pita pieces were perfect - soft and moist. Each bite of hummus & pita resulted in a very happy palate. Start out with this one but save some room for the other menu items!(6/10) Smoked Chicken & Goat Cheese Crepe\\nWith artichoke, red pepper, and tomato coulis. This was a solid crepe, but nothing to write home about. The chicken and artichoke were cooked well but lacked in flavor. The goat cheese was a nice, tasty addition, but was only placed on top of the crepe, not throughout on the inside. The cold tomato coulis was lost on the crepe, and didn't add much. The side salad that came with the crepe was fresh and complemented it well.(9/10) Prosciutto & Sliced Mozzarella Panini\\nWith sun-dried tomato and basil pesto. Quite possibly the best panini ever. The bread was hearty and slightly crispy. It was grilled just right. The inside of the panini was delightful - fresh mozzarella, delicious basil pesto, and prosciutto that was bursting with flavor. This panini is large enough to feed a hungry adult, and if you are still hungry there is pasta on the side. But we suggest ending on a panini bite! The pasta is ok, but the panini gets an A+!Service (6/10)We dined on a weekend evening. Apothecary is a seat yourself cafe. We waited about 10 minutes until a table was available, and the waiter came out a few minutes later to clean the table. Our waiter was curt and efficient, but not friendly and barely made eye contact. He brought everything out in a timely manner. We requested to-go boxes but he did not bring out a bag to put them in. We were waiting a while for the bill, so we ended up paying at the register. overall, the food and ambiance impressed us but the service could use some tweaking.Ambiance (8/10)Apothecary is located in a strip-mall, with a parking lot at the back of the restaurant. It is a mix between cozy and cramped, yet classy. The interior is dimly lit, woodsy, and has beautiful light fixtures and decor. There seems to be an appealing Moroccan/World vibe. The bar area has a nice feel to it as well. This cafe is better for couples or small groups as seating can be a little challenging. They offer live music several nights a week. East Austinites have Blue Dahlia, and now North and Central Austin residents have Apothecary. We prefer the latter!

The idea of \\"global tapas\\" didn't alarm me at first, but glancing at the menu I quickly realized this may be an issue. When we were going over the cocktail menu, we realized that the ingredients listed under an item just throw in a little Spanish and French without any disclaimer. If it wasn't for my super cultured friend who knows 3-4 languages, we would've just blindly guessed what was in each drink.- DONKEY PUNCH: This cute cocktail in a grapefruit half looks like it'd be super sweet and refreshing, but really is just straight tequila. You have been warned!\\n- FARRO KIMCHI FRIED RICE ($13): The farro did not work as a fried rice dish, because it was too big and grainy to stick to any of the flavors. The kimchi was probably too sour because it was paired with Thai herbs and green curry. None of these flavors meshed together at all and it was way too salty!\\n~ ORGANIC HUMMUS ($12): The yellow beets were a little bit too large, but the hummus and barbari bread together were great. However for a $12 price tag, I'm not sure this dish is worth the price.\\n~ TEXAS SMOKED SHORT RIB ($16): This dish was presented with a single short rib, two slices of pickles, and a side of grits/collard greens. The short rib itself was very flavorful and tender, but a single short rib for $16?!!\\n+ BURGER ($15): My favorite of the night! The burger was presented on Hawaiian bread that was not toasted - the soft texture contrasted well against the jalapeno chips, thick burger patty, and foie gras. The burger also was smothered in an onion soup mayo jam that added a lot of flavor paired with American cheese. Overall, I think that the restaurant should try an specialize in a couple global cuisines, but not all. I didn't like the kimchi fried rice version they presented, but their burger was very good. The waitstaff are very helpful in trying to help each party determine what they like, but a lot of the confusion in the beginning could be reduced if they were more clear in their menu descriptions. Also, the open kitchen concept is intriguing, but the dining area immediately becomes smokey after 5:30 PM and you will walk out reeking of barbecue and smoked flavors."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Although the bakery is filled to the rim with cakes, macaroons, and all other types of tarts and sweet goodies, we came for the cannolis and that's all I got.

They come and take your drink orders and you can enjoy a fresh cannoli with it. We ordered a chocolate chip cannoli and a pistachio cannoli. Both were flaky and crunchy on the outside, and creamy on the inside. The inside is actually a cheese...I think ricotta and something else. They are quite large, so we only got 2 to split between 4 people. The only difference between the two is the flavor chips on the end.

The second floor has a nice view of the CityWalk lagoon and we dug the overall steampunk vibe.For drinks, the Chocolate Old Fashioned and the Too Chocolate Stout seemed like no brainers. The girlfriend loves her old fashioned cocktails and I'm always on the lookout for unique local beers when we are out of town. Both were absolutely delicious!Even though we typically try to get different items, we both ordered the Classic Sole Amandine.

This is not a complaint; just an observation.We finished our late night meal with their Flourless Chocolate Cake. By no means am I an expert in this dessert. It was so rich and smooth, I almost questioned if this was how it was supposed to be.

We were told it would take 20 mins to get a table so we thought what the heck.  They didn't have a proper waiting area with seats and away from the diners but we thought what's 20 mins if their pizzas were as good as some people say they were.  (Some of the diners must've been getting uncomfortable when we started getting real hungry and we were staring at them to will them to leave!)  Eventually 2 big tables left but it still took them awhile to clear and set it.  We waited so long that my legs were cramping!\\nI finally checked the time when we sat down and it was just over an hour since we arrived!!!

The wings were crispy but may have stayed in the fryer a bit too long as it was a bit dry and wasn't tossed enough for the sauce to coat it properly.  The hot sauce was perfectly spicy for me but someone at my table wanted it a bit more spicy.  The pizza is your typical Greek-style with the thicker crust and deeper than a NY-style but nowhere near as deep as a Chicago-style.  The ingredients were nice and fresh; the tomatoes were still surprisingly fresh despite being under the cheese and gone through the oven.  It had lots of onions which I like in a pizza.  I'm pro pineapple so was pleasantly surprised there was plenty and sweet which was a nice foil to the spicy pepperoni and complemented the ham.  The crust was bland so we left a lot of the ends on our plates.\\nOverall the pizza was above average but not life changing (like the pizza we had in Chicago!!!) and would definitely rethink dining in -- at least between 6-7pm on a Saturday.

I'd keep in mind, though, that I've heard this place is great from several different sources, but I can only (and prefer to) write a review on my single experience.The first mistake my party and I likely made was that we visited on a weekday afternoon.  This was likely NOT their \\"A\\" team of waitresses, and I mean that in the most objectifying way.  Granted, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I'd be hard pressed to find a heterosexual pirate with only one good eye who's been in the company of men for the past 3 years who would willingly prevent death via scurvy by doing a body shot off one of these women just to get to the lime.The setting is that of a generic bar.  Alcohol advertisements line the walls where space isn't already taken by photos of more attractive women who apparently don't work the Wednesday afternoon shift.  There are plenty of stool-height tables, which never really did much for me (I'm not at a bar, let me sit on a chair).The food was mediocre, at best.  If the prices were reasonable, I wouldn't mind... but unfortunately you'll end up paying a lot for a dish that really doesn't make this bar stand out.  That's on top of the 18% included gratuity, which my server did not earn.  I ordered the fish and chips.  If you've been to Long John Silvers, you've had the meal I had the distaste of eating here.

The vibes inside and outside are completely different; In sitting outside you completely forget that the place is also a bar.The fried plantains were absolutely incredible-- although it is hard for plantains not to be. I had the pancake breakfast because it offered me a breakfast with a bit of salty (eggs and sausage) and sweet (pancakes).

The selection of sauces and toppings isn't extensive, although they have all the standard offerings... usually I go with a thin crust pepperoni, garlic, and green pepper. Recently I tried the white pizza (it's an alfredo sauce) - to be honest, I didn't notice a lot of difference in flavor between that pizza and ones with the standard tomato sauce... but it was good, nonetheless. I appreciate that greasiness isn't an issue. Non-meat toppings can be a little sparse, as other reviewers have mentioned.It's not the best pizza in the world, but it's a lot better than most I've tried locally... and part of the issue may be that I'm cheap and don't get the specialty pizzas; I usually go with simpler pizzas, which can be a little bland. I really like that I can order online and avoid human contact until the delivery person comes. I've ordered during the 5-6pm hour and have had to wait maybe an hour and 15 minutes maximum, which is great. Again, there's consistency.I've also done catering orders with them (it goes through the head office, not this specific branch, I believe) and have had great experiences.A star docked because the pricing is a little steep - usually around $25-27 for a large pizza with a few toppings, delivered - and because they no longer offer potatoes as a topping. Those potatoes were amazing and should be brought back!"},{"name":"Pizza Bruno","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is the local place that you want to find, loving returning to, and always want to share with out of town guests.I quickly heard the hype about Pizza Bruno... finally made it in (after drooling over the pics people were posting) and loved every bit of it.The ATMOSPHERE is small local and not over-the-top, but still trendy and comfortable. Unfortunately, we ended up waiting quite a while for a table of six because it was a Saturday night and they only have one or two tables for big parties. (In my book, that's not a huge deal and is kind of expected for a new popular place on a weekend.) Once we got in the smell of the delicious pizza we'd be enjoying and the friendliness of the waitress made us forget about the long wait.The SERVICE was great. Our waitress was really friendly but you could tell she was busting it and was having a really busy night. (Like I said - this is something that's kind of expected on a weekend at a new popular place.) She kept up with everyone's drinks, offered some recommendations and did a great job for how busy she was.The FOOD... oh the food! After visiting Italy for almost a month a couple of years ago, I decided one of my favorite parts about being there was the food. I've only found a few places that satisfy my Italian pizza craving as I've travelled all of the nation since then. In my opinion Pizza Bruno is definitely some of the best pizza in Orlando and brought me right back to eating pies in Italy. While the pizza is worth the price of admission alone (try the Crimson Ghost - wow), ALL the other food was fantastic too! Our table shared apps and a salad and I was impressed with everything I tried (mixed salad - they were out of kale, meatballs, cauliflower, wine, etc). I was particularly impressed with the cauliflower dish. So delicious and had a tad bit of sweetness to it. All-in-all I'll be back to Pizza Bruno. Hopefully frequently. The price point is so reasonable for what you're getting and the \\"small town local\\" vibe is just right for taking people from out of town that don't want to go to Touristland on i-drive.

I get to the restaurant and my new burger is ready. At this point I just want a refund since my whole family has eaten. The woman at the counter tells me she can't do that because door dash handles the money. She tells me to take it up with door dash. I say I will dispute it and then she takes my new food and says I can't have it. At this point I start to explode as another customer comes walking back into the kitchen. She has a problem with the same woman and her attitude. The manager comes out and attempts to defuse the situation but the woman at the counter continues with her comments. At this point the whole encounter is literally becoming violent. The whole experience was a disaster and a nightmare. I left with my burger and I have no idea have the obese white woman at the counter has a job. Literally the worst and most ignorant customer service representative I have ever dealt with.

It broke apart upon picking them up. The xiao long baos were some of the worst I've had. There was no soup at all, the skin was thick and tough, and the pork stuffing was mushy. The beef noodles were tasteless and the beef was tough to chew. I did enjoy a few things. The fried crab balls were exceptionally good - fried to a golden brown crisp and filled with crab flavor. The Hong Kong pan-fried noodles were also good and tasted much better compared to the beef noodles.

Even better, the line went by super quick while we determined the combination of mini cake donuts and chais we wanted to try. Ultimately, and hungrily, we ended up with a dozen of the donuts- 2 of each available flavor- and a flight of the iced chai. Our donuts were warm upon arrival and we quickly gobbled them up- my favorite was the raw honey and sea salt, bae enjoyed the cinnamon sugar. We also had a blackberry lavender one, one with bacon, Nutella and sea salt, and one called the \\"dirty wu\\" which basically had a bit of all the classics.

Aside from the mediocre things I've heard of it, I wanted to be able to voice my own opinion and give it a try! Starting off with the ambiance, it's very simple and quite small. Few flies buzzing around that personally bugged me, but it's that time of year? I suppose.Service.. not great to be honest. We ordered the pho, with an addition of bone marrow and egg - but when our order came, the bowl contained the rare beef which we hadn't ordered. We had to ask where the bone marrow was and one of the servers added it in. Keep in mind, we didn't bother to check if we got charged extra for something that we didn't order.. but after doing the math after leaving - we noticed we did get charged for it. It wasn't even busy so there's no reason for the staff to be inattentive.. we had to ASK for our water to be filled, even after placing our empty cups visibly on the edge of our table.We also got declined of a larger table when it was clearly a struggle to fit the food that we ordered onto the table.. I kept dropping my phone and cutlery because the table LITERALLY had NO ROOM.Onto the food. The mussels were delicious - the sauce was rich, flavourful and more enjoyable than most places. The escargot on the other hand was placed on an extremely hard, overly buttered bun. I think this could have been executed way better.. but to each his own. And lastly, the pho. Bone marrow did not taste fresh whatsoever. Broth was saltier than most. I feel like the only thing that made it worth my while was the side of chilli sauce that is offered with it. My verdict is, if you want French food, go to a French restaurant. And if you want pho, go to Victoria drive. I'd return to be fair and try more things on the menu, but the service there isn't worth my time."},{"name":"Abide","address":"317 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down the best boba I've ever had.

It's no Fritti or Maggiano's who are classier and also can get away with charging for bread and salad - so something has to give. The worst part is the last couple of times we gave it a try, it took them FOREVER to greet us and sit us down. The waiters were not friendly and came across as arrogant. The restaurant basically needs to figure out what their niche is - friendly/family or trendy? It can't be both. It's my birthday this month and they sent me an email offering free desert.

This is hands down one of my all time favorite pizza places in the United States and even the world.  Since I grew up eating this stuff, I learned to love it from a young age.  This is thin crust pizza, so thin that it is basically paper thin on crackers. The owners of Iacono's have changed several times over the years but they have stayed true to the pizza and service.  One of the best deals in town is their lunch buffet.  The pizza buffet currently cost $10.75 for all you can eat salad, soup, and pizza.  This is a great lunch deal.  The cost of the buffet over the years has changed and sometime the service is not the best but I will always love this place.

Food:  4.25 stars- We ordered Vanilla Latte, waters, jasmine tea, egg and cheese crepe and petit crepes dejenuer.  Food came out hot and both meals were good..no complaints at all.  Both tea and latte were also good.  We ordered, second round at bar, ginger Roobois tea and Mexican got chocolate.  Again both were very good and no complaints.Service:  4 stars-  Hostess welcomes us and seated immediately.  Kanea was our server and took our orders within 5 minutes of seating.  She did a good job. At bar, served by Jose with good service.   Environment:  4 stars-  Out of the main hustle and bustle of Concourse B.  Had classical music playing in background that provided a good distraction.

So, thus I enjoyed my meal. The restaurant is nicely done. A decent amount of tables. I met John M. for dinner on a Thursday night, and there were still tables open, so we got seated right away. I thought the Beef Egg Roll Salad (Bun bo cha gip) was quite good. The fish sauce that is spread over the cold noodle dish enhanced the flavors that much more. I did put about a fourth/half a cup of hot clear wonton broth to give it more moisture (a personal taste/texture thing). This was a large dish, definitely enough for left-overs. I'm incredibly intrigued by the menu pic of the Pho.

I skipped breakfast here but did order dinner which was just about average. The first red flag was how long it took for the food to get ready. It was around 8, the restaurant was nearly empty and it took over 30mins. I ordered some pan seared salmon from their \\"healthy\\" menu and  it lacked any flavor at all. It didn't seem to have any seasoning at all, not even salt and pepper.  You can pick a sauce and I went with the garlic butter, which I thought would be on top of the salmon. Thankfully it was on the side because it wasn't that good. The best part of the meal were the two sides, the mash potatoes and the cauliflower. The mashed potatoes were fresh, and honestly had more flavor than the salmon. The cauliflower had some type of seasoning/herbs on it (go figure), which was overwhelming but was bearable when scooped with the veggies.

The occasion to go just never came up, and after awhile I had heard so many reviews of that soup and the steaks that I figured it *had* to be overrated. Turns out, it wasn't.  I finally went for the first time this year for lunch with my fiance and two friends, and we all shared a charcuterie board and each got our own entrees. As for the charcuterie, I have only this to say: whipped pork fat. *drool* It was amazing on the toast points, and was sprinkled with a tiny bit of sea salt that really set it off just right. The whole board was lovely, but that pork fat was the star.My fiance and I shared our dishes of stuffed chicken and a filet, and both were just wonderful.

The Mowie Wowie was 100% my favorite - a mix of three different tropical fruits including mango, passion fruit and guava. They also have a list of delicious looking cocktails that I'll have to come back and try. At first glance, I thought their menu was kind of bar food mixed with the usual southern dishes like shrimp and grits. However their menu is actually got tons of unique dishes. They have the infamous Impossible burger which is a vegetarian burger that's been modified to have a heme containing protein so apparently it bleeds and tastes like meat. (Thank you Buzzfeed for that fun fact.) They also have some asian dishes including steam buns, bahn mi, fried rice, bone marrow.- Avocado toast - Not your typical avocado toast! It has diced tofu added in. This was fantastic and a great light brunch!\\n- Southern breakfast - Wow! Took my cousin here to give him a southern experience and this was absolutely it. It's got fried chicken, eggs, bacon and your choice of potatoes or cheese grits.\\n- Grilled cheese and tomato soup - Just always so good. You cannot go wrong with this.\\n- Impossible burger - Not quite sure if I was 100% impressed by this burger. Definitely tastes more like meat than any veggie burger I had.

Sadly, the shirts were unable to be found, but one out of two ain't bad. Can't really say no to fried chicken, especially of the hot variety. The space was pretty no-frills, with a few large communal cafeteria-style tables in the middle. However, the space is fairly large, as it inhabits an entire section of the top floor of North Market, so there should be no problem finding a place to sit. When we arrived around 12pm, the line was already wrapped around the edge of the room, as expected. However, the line went relatively quickly, and we weren't in line for longer than 15 minutes. Not to mention, when we ordered, the staff greeted us and made sure we were comfortable and happy, and the cashiers were very patient in explaining everything, even if it took them a little longer to ring up the transaction. They definitely have the customer service thing down pretty pat. Once you make your order, you can grab some water or Ma's sweet tea (both free of charge), as well as some of the house ranch (also free of charge). Then you can grab a seat, and wait for them to call your name. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you can get a free banana pudding.I ended up getting the hot dark meal, which was a thigh and drumstick, accompanied by pickles, two slices of white bread, mac & cheese, and coleslaw. The chicken was delicious, hot as advertised, and juicy in the middle (heh). The mac & cheese was great, although the coleslaw was a little disappointing, since it lacked that nice crunch and acidity. I also tried the boneless hot chicken, which was fine, but it really required a lot of the house ranch, since it was a little dry in the middle. The banana pudding was excellent, full of crushed vanilla wafers, and a great end to the meal, especially since it was gratis.  As previously mentioned, the service was excellent, and very helpful throughout our visit. The prices are a little expensive for an over-the-counter lunch, but it is filling, and that hot chicken is one of the most satisfying comfort foods out there.There seems to be some very polarized opinions on HCT, and I really think it depends on what you order. Overall, I really recommend getting dark meat meals, and paying the extra for double macaroni and cheese and forgoing the coleslaw. As it currently stands, I've yet to try Hattie B's in Nashville, which is apparently the golden standard, but will hopefully have the opportunity soon, so I have something to compare to.

I am not kidding you at all, they were completely sold out of wings before it hit 1. Needless to say I was heartbroken and disappointed, but because I had stood on the line for 30mins (Yes, THIRTY!)? I decided to order the breast in warm heat. The breast was on top of some bread and was served with Mac and cheese and cole slaw. I found the skin to be very crispy and the warm had just the right kick of spice for those of us who don't like super spicy food. The outside parts of the chicken were juicy but I found the inside to be less tender and juicy. I opted out of cole slaw but the Mac was pretty good. It isn't your grandmas souther Mac, and was a little too cheesy for me, but overall it was bearable. They also offer sweetened and unsweetened tea at no additional charge, which is amazing. Seating is a punch of community style benches so be prepared to sit very close to others. Hopefully I can come back and try the wings the next time I'm in Columbus.

Their trailer is parked in a gas station lot across from Hoovers on Manor and they do not have any seating so you get it to go or eat in your car. They are working on a new location that can provide seating. The prices are comparable to grocery store sushi without the cold rice. The rolls are made after you order and there are 4 different sauces you can add for 50 cents extra. The prices range from 3.50 - 12.00 most are around 5.00. Their lunch box sushi served all day is 10.00 except for the Tuna 12.00. The edamame is only 1.20 and the seaweed salad often sales out early. Today was my second visit. I was actually headed downstairs to Wholefoods for their sushi when I team member invited me to join her at Sushi A-Go-Go -YES! We picked up our sushi and brought it back to Whole Foods - much cheaper and no cold rice! Edamame 1.20 Sunshine Roll 6.00 - Super fresh Salmon on the inside with mango and avocado BBQ Eel Roll 4.50 - with avocado, cucumber and eel sauce on top.

I am a lover of all things local and fresh and after he saw the portion of the menu that focuses on farm fresh goodies he knew it was the kind of place I would like.He was completely right!  We each ordered one of the 5 course tasting menus with wine pairings.  I ordered the Farmer's Menu and he the Chefs Tasting Menu.  We would each eat half of the plate and wine then trade.  I would highly suggest other couples do the same thing because each menu had its high and low points.  Neither menu that we actually had is currently on the website.The Farmer's Menu started with a cold melon salad.  It was one of those moments where you take a bite and think wow I've never tasted anything like this!  It was both sweet and tangy.  Very good.  The second course on this menu was a cold smoked corn soup - this was by far my favorite part of the entire night and I have been thinking about this soup ever since.  The smoked flavor was so full and delicious and there were little peppers within the soup that brightened up the entire dish.  AMAZING.  Seriously Zoot, bottle that so I can buy some!  The next two courses in the Farmer's Menu I really enjoyed - risotto and then a mushroom ravioli.  They were rich and tasty but SO incredibly salty that I had difficulty finishing even half.The Chef's Tasting menu started with a ceviche that I wasn't crazy about but my boyfriend really enjoyed.  Then came basically a deconstructed BLT - iceberg with thick pieces of braised bacon and a horseradish dressing.  It was really good but I wished for more heat from the horseradish.  Next was a fish dish (snapper maybe?) with a Chinese 5 Spice broth.  This dish was another of my favorite of the meal.  The broth was just to die for and fish was perfectly cooked.  Again, a bit salty.  The main course was a beef tenderloin with mushrooms - it was very earthly and perfectly cooked.  Both menus finished up with a flourless chocolate cake with an orange sauce and raspberry sauce on the side and a little caramel/salted praline on top.  Seriously delicious dessert.  I actually had a dream that night where I was eating it again.Overall review of the food is that it was delicious, unique and seemed so well thought out.  I loved seeing the vegetables that are currently in season so well treated on the plate.  I just think that they need to watch their salt levels.  I'm not generally sensitive to salt (in fact, I love it excessively) but parts of this meal were nearly ruined by a heavy salting hand.The location is a bit out there but it was a pretty drive.  The restaurant is much too quiet - they had no music playing or anything and there were only a few other couples in the dining room so I think we all felt like we had to whisper to talk to each other.  Also, they could definitely work on the decor.  They have some gray painted canvases on the walls but sometimes they were too small for the wall they were on...the place just needs a minor redesign to feel more inviting.  I think Zoot could be a real contender in the Austin restaurant scene.

And the hash! There's a reason everyone orders it. One of my top brunch dishes for sure. The mimosas are very good. Heavy on the OJ, light on the champagne, but I'm a lightweight so I'm not complaining. Their claim to fame is the added strawberry syrup. You can see the nice effect it has in the glass, but to be honest I couldn't taste it.

Flavorless and plain like \\"boiled beef noodle in water\\" rather than the beautiful Bun Bo Hue dish I know. Please don't serve this dish if you still don't know how to cook this right, sorry but I have to say that... Broken rice with grilled pork is ok only. The rice was still quite not soft and fish sauce is not quite flavorful. Their \\"banh bot loc\\" was awful, super chewy and does not go well with the fish sauce neither.

I love shopping at the wine and beer isle. Great selections and carefully crafted displays of the variety of red cabernet which is a favorite  type of wine I prefer. One plus is the catering menu so if your interested I do know in fact many friends used the catering service and  five star rating at that. Several negatives are the fact they had little selection on fat free milk a brand not familiar with which left me scratching my head wondering why would the Whole food chain not be more competitive with the other  grocery down the street. Another problem was zero assistance finding help to find a certain brand of mayonnaise but left buying a brand unknown to me. As you know Whole foods is sort of an upscale grocery pricy but produce is the freshest I ever seen. So off I go into the sunset heading home finally arriving home I take the bags down and fell to the floor because the handles of an over packed bag ripped reason why I gave 3 stars overall. So unfortunately I come here to buy items HEB doesnt carry that I enjoy. Next visit I hope they have staff that can help me with my shopping needs.

The super cool thing is that you can see the cocoa beans in pipes/tubes close to the ceiling. That was pretty much the highlight of the outing. We stood in line and perused our options while admiring the beans moving in the pipes. We chose the PB&J shake and the birthday cake shake (?). They come in plastic mason jars, with a TON of whipped cream on top, with whatever flavor you chose on top as an actual solid food item as a topping. Kudos for paper straws! The shake wasn't even chilly, and definitely not cold. The toppings were somewhat stale, and it was honestly just too much. They got the taste right, but a couple of sips in and we had our fill. 3/4 of our shakes went to the trash, sadly. For the price, not worth it.

I read the sign, times, and take my self over to the drive up window. It was late, dark, cold, and we were starved after a 12 hour drive from Houston, Texas. I saw were she hesitated giving me the two pizzas that had been sitting on the counter from when I was parked at the store front. She even asked, and he shook his head in agreement. How terrible could they be? In our Hotel, us moms were disappointed that even our daughters didn't want the pizza. My daughter snub her nose at a Little Caesars pizza for the first time ever, and let me remind you she has it weekly on Roller derby practice night. As hungry as we were, I think we all ate a slice just so we could get some sleep. The other one we left for the trash because the birds wouldn't want it either.

I tried to start a conversation about knowing the owner, having worked a place that inspected his truck.  The bearded wonder then grilled me about if his truck would pass inspection with an ABS light on.  Am I on the clock or you?  Unfazed, I decided on a 16 oz. drip coffee.  No different roasts?

The place wasn't crowded (I discovered they mainly do take-out orders), but the restaurant was cozy and clean, as always. This continues to be my favorite little restaurant to visit, but there have been some changes recently to the menu and prices. For those that are loyal customers like myself, this won't make you change your mind about continuing to go. They upgraded their utensils/dishes/etc and re-vamped their menu with new prices by about $1-2, which now reflect $10-$15 per entree dish (I knew the old prices were just too good to be true)! But even with the increased prices this little restaurant STILL has my business because of the consistent quality and taste in every appetizer, entree, and dessert that they serve. One thing that I would recommend about them is that they need a soda machine so customers can get free refills (like most restaurants do). You pay for the soda and get the can/glass and once you're out, you're out and have to buy another which makes it more expensive than most restaurants. They do make up for this by continuing to be BYOB (no corking fee or anything and they provide the glasses!)

But tonight, due to unsurprising popular demand, they were out of 2 of the 3: pulled pork and cold slaw. In fact, they were out of all pork and ribs. All they had left was a big hunk of brisket. And while I considered ditching my plan and walking fifty feet to Subway, I decided to stick it out when I found out they did in fact have bread left to make sandwiches.My decision was good. The brisket was truly excellent. Now, I'd still pick the pulled pork if they're both around, but there was no step down here from PP to brisket. It was delectable. The meat was tender and juicy, and the BBQ sauce was drizzled and dripping all over me. I can still smell it two hours later. As for sides, I got the beans, which are awesome, and I decided to try the collard greens. Never had collard greens in my life to be honest, and to be frank, I wasn't into 'em. I think they're just not for me. Because if Ray Ray's made it, I'm sure they're top notch for collard greens. And it was just not my scene.As I placed my order, I noticed behind the dude cutting my meat was a real, charcoal-blackened pig's head on top of a mantle with a 2 dollar bill in its mouth. I couldn't think of a more perfect representation of how legitimate this place is. Let your inhibitions slide.

My recollection was that a couple rolls from the menu were particularly good, but otherwise it was another unremarkable sushi restaurant.Then, wandering through Watertown and craving sushi one night, I went back.And WOW, I didn't realize what I was missing! First, New Ginza is beautiful.  The space is bright and clean and very nicely decorated.  I really dig the light wooden furniture.The food was very impressive.  The quality of the fish was definitely noticeable (in a good way), and I was impressed with the list of fish specials - the wild Hamachi, Blue Fin Tuna and O-Toro were outstanding.My recollection of the maki was correct; the selection of house maki was extensive and very creative.  While all the rolls I tried were very good, I absolutely fell in love with the Volcano Maki (baked scallops and shitake mushrooms over a spicy tuna maki).  It was simply AMAZING.But the best part of my experience at New Ginza was the customer service.  New Ginza demonstrates the epitome of what customer service is all about: they genuinely appreciate your business (or at least, they treat you like they do).We were greeted at the door with warm smiles and welcomes, like gracious hosts excited by the arrival of their guests.  As soon as we settled at our table we were greeted by our friendly, personable waitress, who offered us hot towels and beverages.  Throughout the meal she remained engaged in our experience, ready to field any request.  As each dish arrived, she was careful to introduce the dish and answer any questions.  The manager stopped by and seemed genuinely interested in our satisfaction.  Even the sushi chefs behind the bar made sure to catch our attention and wave goodbye as we left.I left New Ginza feeling uplifted and energized (if not incredibly full).

I've been pleasantly surprised with Big City Burrito's offerings.  They have a wide range of choice for both sizes and types of tortillas as well as fillings.  Their chicken was tender and flavorful and the potatoes are right on.  I was even blown away from their \\"green sauce\\", which for me should be roasted green chile (from Hatch, New Mexico) and that's it, but this one was really good with poblano and some other peppers in there.I'll agree with what some others have said that the way they present their menu is a bit cluttered and confusing.  They'd be better off with a menu board and a number of popular \\"pre-built\\" named burritos and a make your own with a list of ingredients, but i figured out their grid system eventually.  Once you've been there once it doesn't really matter anyways.I had quick and friendly service from individuals who seem to be excited about their products and are proud to talk to you about them.  Try and find that at Chipotle!  I was even given a free sample of their habanero sauce.  Not a big deal, but when you're trying to win over new customers that can make a difference.The inside could use a little more attention, but honestly the decor looks no different than most local burrito places I've ever been toom that aren't full blown restaurants.  A cooler for random drinks, soda and coffee machines, a TV to keep you occupied if you have to wait.  A few tables.  I don't think they are super concerned about their dining experience since I'd imagine 95% are taking their stuff to go and it's not like they are in disrepair or disgusting.People are calling it a chain, except that they have only 10 locations and 9 are in CO.  That still is pretty local and for me, demonstrates the success of the product.

This is probably not the place for me to get into that, so I won't...Anyway, I had heard a lot about Mike's Pastry, whether it be from my fiance or my friends who liked to travel to Boston. When I mentioned going to Boston, several people chimed in and said that I had to eat canolis at Mike's. I had not realized there was such a strong Italian presence in Boston.We walked in and the place is like a madhouse. There wasn't a line, which from what I hear is pretty abnormal. It was a cold morning, so I guess people stayed home. We decided to get four desserts (because we're fatties like that) and picked: the florentine canoli, the caramel canoli, the profiterole, and the chocolate chip cheesecake.The florentine canoli? Fuggedaboutit. Okay, I have no idea how to spell that phrase. I'm sorry I tried. The hard, florentine style cookie on the outside added the extra texture and flavor to the otherwise boring cream (not that the cream is bad, but that it gets old fast when there's so much of it). The caramel canoli, on the other hand, was too soggy and the cream didn't taste like anything. It was my least favorite dessert.My fiance was obsessed with the profiterole. She loves whipped cream in general and gobbled that thing right up. I wasn't as huge of a fan and would have actually preferred the lobster tail or the cookies that had whipped cream. The chocolate chip cheesecake was very rich, creamy, and tasty, but again suffered from the texture problem. The crust was soggy and the chocolate chips, oddly enough, were melted and extremely soft. It felt like I was eating a block of cream cheese.Most of the choices we selected were not winners, but it looks like they have a ton of other desserts, and so many that looked delicious.

Back in the day, my wife and I used to goto Pleasure Island and have a blast at all the clubs.  Now, that they've removed all of the clubs and added more restaurants and shops, Disney still keeps all of the magic inside this little area in Lake Buena Vista.There are so many places to eat, there's a bowling alley, and luckily they kept the House of Blues, so if you're looking for live music, that's the place to go.  Ghiradelli has a shop where you can get an incredible milkshake or ice cream cone.  There's the Rainforest Cafe which goes over good with the kids (along with the Lego store).  You can also take a ferry ride from one side of the propery to another.For the past year and a half, Disney Springs has been under contstruction.  Until then, parking was a nightmare - you were always better getting public transportation.  Now, they have a new parking garage (and building a second), with easy access from I-4.  Just get off Exit 67 and veer to your right and you go straight into the parking garage.  Luckily, parking is still free.Morimoto Asia just opened if you're into Asian cuisine along with Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar if if you're looking for a cold one.  If you get a chance, and want your wallet to feel lighter, visit the Boathouse and a cast member can take you on a ride in one of these rare ampicars.I always look forward to going to Disney Springs and spending an afternoon or evening there.

While the food was good, this review is mainly about the service (or lack thereof). I tend to be a fan of local business, and try to frequent them whenever I can, but all my normal spots were either closed, or crazy busy with it being breakfast/lunch time on New Year's Day (and I was STARVING). I saw the old Mangia spot was now a curious little thing called Another Broken Egg Cafe, which as first I assumed was an Asian place, and also a local place. It was neither, but no sweat, I'm not pretentious enough to not give it a chance. I realized this was a chain when I walked in. The decor is fairly chainy-y, but I wasn't too concerned. The place is only open till the mid afternoon which seems odd that they would have such high rent, and expect to make enough money off of breakfast/lunch crowds to survive. Esp around the north campus areas. It took a while to get our seats, but we ordered fairly quickly. Then we waited.... and waited......... and waited some more. It was approx a 30-35min wait. Did I mention I was famished? I understand that is not their fault I was hungry, but assume if someone is going to a restaurant to eat, they are probably hungry. After about 15 minutes we tracked down and asked our waitress if there was an update on our food, and she said, 'Sorry it's taking so long, it should be out soon'.  Then we wait some more.... When we finally do get our meals, I'm so hungry I barely notice what I am eating, but it must have been decent enough for me to scarf down. I got the french toast, and my companion got some kind of omelet. Again, both weren't bad. From a customer standpoint, here is what I'd like to see the waitress/manager do. \\n1. ACKNOWLEDGE!!!!! Please let me know that the kitchen is backed up, or they messed up my order, or whatever, and that it is going to take longer than expected. Bonus points if you can give me an estimate of how long that might be. \\n2. Bring me something to munch on. Bread, muffins, anything\\n3. Check on me a few times during the meal to make sure all is well, and comp me something. The manager did finally come by and apologize for our food taking so long, and offered an order of free beignets, but it's doubtful I'll ever go back.

I got the lamb saagwala with a side of missi roti, and all for around $10. The lamb in the spinach was superb, and the rice was excellent as well. The bread was a tiny bit more oily than expected, but no matter, it was delicious anyway, and the naan that my friends ordered was very good.

The line went out the door and we were told there weren't any availability for the rest of the night but luckily someone cancelled their reservation and we were able to get seated. We were seated in a boat shaped booth where we had to take off our shoes before entering.  The booth could have seated 6-8 people but we were only having dinner for 4.This placed looked very appealing in photos and the idea of eating all you can eat Japanese BBQ alongside sushi for around $26 CAD seemed very promising. Sadly, the food was only mediocre. The sushi was the kind you could find at sushi land and the meat was not marinated well except for the peppered steak which was our favorite part.  If I had to suggest a few things to order, it would be the peppered steak and the corn cake. The corn cake was sweet and tasted similar to Che bap which is a Vietnamese corn dessert. There wasn't anything I wouldn't suggest but keep in mind, the meat and sushi were only mediocre. It was also very annoying to order with their menu. You had to order the sushi and appetizers per piece which we did not realize until later. So when you write one next to the scallop roll, you would literally only get one piece. It would have been easier and more efficient if they offered portions per plate instead. The service was also not great.  The workers don't pay attention and they don't check up on you either. We had to waive down the waiter every time we wanted to order more food but after we placed our order, the food came out immediately.

Between this and Mi Li Cafe, there's some great food happening here. I don't eat a lot of pho, and I'm not really a huge fan of what I've had, so I really wanted to give this place a shot, since I've heard it's some of the best broth in town. First off, we brought one of our Vietnamese friends to help us decide on some menu options, and she guided us toward the Vietnamese coffee to start. Where has this been all my life? My girlfriend and I loved it so much, we went across the street to Saraga to get the filters and coffee to make some at home. It filters right at the table and what your left with is a really strong and delicious mixture of condensed milk and coffee. I could drink this everyday.So judging by the pictures, the banh mi looked enormous (and it was), but I wanted to try it, so we split one among the three of us. It's well over a foot long on delicious French bread and only $5.75! That's the best sandwich deal in town. It comes with the pork on it as well as a yellowy mayo looking sauce that was tangy and delicious. The veggies comes on the side, so you can add as much or as little as you like. Everyone loved this.For my main entree, I went with the Pho Dac Biet, which has basically all of their beef options, including tendon and tripe. I liked the broth, but I think overall, it wasn't my favorite dish in the world. It was kind of skimping on some of the beef, and the flavor combined with the noodles wasn't my favorite. I didn't actually see any tendon, and the trip was pretty miniscule. Our friend ordered Bun Bo Hue, and I think she liked it? It was a bit of a mixed reaction.I think I need to stop getting pho, because I'm just not the biggest fan of it, and I feel like an outcast! The thing is, I love every other dish I've tried at Vietnamese restaurants, so it's time to start sticking to those. I'd definitely want to come back for the vermicelli and the rice cake dishes. We were here on a Sunday for lunch, and it was pretty packed. The service is a little slow, but it wasn't that big of a deal.

This place is very un-typical in their vegan options in that they use no fake meats at all.  But they do some mean veggie tacos that are some of the most inovative I've seen in a while.Have you ever heard of rapini, fava leaf or sunchokes? How about radish tops turnip greens or romenesco?  This is what you are going to find in these awesome veggie tacos.  Well you must wonder how does this guy gets this kind of produce? I asked that question and..he quickly told me about Spingdale Farms that locally grows organic unique veggies and whatever is in season he creatively uses them in his tacos.  Sounds good to me..How about the tortillas?  These are way better than what you see at your normal taqueria, these are handmade from beautiful bright yellow corn he sources organically, grinds them in his mill and whala!  How about the hot sauce.  No siracha crap here they ferment locally grown peppers like habaneros, Peruvian aji and others and blend them all together to make a wonderful flavored hot sauce.  I think he should sell this stuff.As far as the food and what my favorites are on the menu.  Any taco with the black beans are a must.  He hand makes them from scratch and they are vegan and o so tasty.  I got the fava leaves tempura one and it was so unique and good.  They are pretty good sized and they have a great crunchy texture and really mix well with the beans.  Next comes the shitake mushroom with sunchokes.  This has no beans and the smaller of the 3 tacos I had but if you like mushrooms they are really good.  This one goes really good with the hot sauce.  One lady was really running up to the owner saying how much she liked them.  I kinda agree.  I was going to go with the cauliflower/romenesco as my 3Rd choice but they just ran out so went with the brussel sprouts with orange and cilantro w/black beans.  The Brussels he uses are this giant sized ones that start to make leaves so they don't taste like normal ones you get at restaurants.  Way way better. Slightly crispy tasting and together with the beans is really pretty mind bending.As I mentioned before the guy who owns this stand is super chill and informative. He buys local and organic  He's kind of a Jack of all trades so please ask questions??If you are a veggie head like me this is a must stop.

I got the shrimp basket & corn fritters and, though it was pretty good, my stomach started to really hurt about 4 hours later. Mind you - I had only eaten about half of my food and was saving the rest (thank god) so it would have been much, much worse if I had finished my food.And in hindsight, I'm really not surprised - the truck looked extremely dirty and the shrimp I was eating had a grainy texture to it so it was probably not cleaned properly. I feel like cross contamination is definitely a problem at this truck...Closing thoughts: don't eat here. If you want good Cajun/New Orleans food, there are much better places you could go. Seems like other people who have left reviews got sick too so I doubt my case is an anomaly. You've been warned!EDIT: \\"Wade G.\\" replied and told me I don't know what food poisoning is. It's been about 24 hours since I ate here, and I DEFINITELY know what food poisoning is now.

We went as a group of 7 and my daughter called and found out you can do a reservation for $50. Upon our arrival we observed the price of $45 an hour which seems high but when you think about the price of a theme park visit then this is not a bad deal. I asked did the reservation fee get applied to $45  bay fee and the person said  no. I was shocked and expressed my lack of understanding and it was explained that sometimes there is a several hour wait thus the reservation fee. I asked if there was a current wait and he say no so I requested my $50 be applied to the per hour fee and a manager was called and she graciously agreed.So buyer beware... I would not pay a fee and not have it applied to the overall cost. I do not agree with that practice. Moving on we went to our bay and we were greeted by a helper to show us how to sign on and get started. The process involved a $5 fee per person for a lifetime  membership which seems wasteful when part of party does not live in FL. So some initial bumps for the newbies. The bay was nice and essentially you are outside with a cover and lots of fans. You can practice by hitting balls or do that the entire time and rotate hitting balls with your party. Or play a real golf game somewhat with par and everything.  There is instant replay of your balls and a timer to let you know how  much time is left. It is to  fun to just watch. It is a big beautiful three story facility.  The menu items looked good and this go around we just had appetizers. A beautiful pretzel with cheese, nut, sausage, prosciutto, and fruit in the pretzel holes. This appetizer was beautiful and delicious.

I ordered the Enchiladas Queso (two cheese enchiladas topped with chile con carne and chile con queso), along with a Mexican martini.The enchiladas were wonderfully cheesy enough to get a gold star in my book, but then I made the mistake of tasting the chile con carne.  What dreck is this?!  The chile con carne tasted exactly like Wolf brand chili.  Hey, I like Wolf brand chili when I'm eating... chili.  Or Frito pies.  Call me crazy, but Wolf brand chili and enchiladas belong on two completely different platos.The refried bean paste was decent, but the rice was better.  The salsa, however, was disappointing.  Personally, I think salsa should have vegetable chunks in it.  Y'know, something to prove it's actually salsa.  This salsa looked and tasted like it only had tomatoes and cilantro in it, and it wasn't the least bit spicy. And the Mexican martini?  'Twas too sour, somehow.  I don't know what they did -- or didn't do -- to it, but I've never had such a sour Mexican martini before.  But I drank it anyway, 'cause I'm a trooper like that.Okay, okay... so why three stars, you ask?  After all, this sounds like a definite 2-star review, does it not?

When my mom is in town, some of my closest friends practically make reservations to come over for dinner. It has gotten so bad she specifically asked me to tell my friends (before she arrives) that she's not cooking.  She has a great palate for seasoning foods, yet even I was surprised at how much she enjoys coming to This Is It. Since she first dined here last year, she now always wants to make them the first stop after picking her up from the airport. Her last three visits were an immediate detour to the Memorial Drive location.  Her meal of choice: Catfish w/cole slaw, chitterlings and green beans.In the past year I have brought some of the pickiest people I know to try the food here and most have found the food to be pretty darn good. My most recent trip to This Is It was with my cousin whom hated his one and only encounter with chitlins as a kid. I honestly didn't think he would find the experience to be any better, but to my surprise he not only enjoyed them... he cleaned his plate!------------ - - - - - -T H E   F O O D  G U I D E\\nI've been to This Is It now about 10 times since I wrote my previous review 1 year ago. I've tried several things on the menu and have found only a few items to be less than 3 stars, but there are some real 4 and 5-star standout items:The catfish fillet is my favorite entree. It is by far one of the best and most flavorful catfish dinners anywhere! (4.5)Oxtails and gravy are hit or miss. When they are a hit, they would rank in my top 5 favorites. Unfortunately, they aren't always consistently that good (3.5)Chitterlings are something I can only eat when I'm in a certain mood. I have actually NEVER craved this soul food delicacy until trying the ones on the menu here. Prior to discovering This Is It, I had eaten chitterlings a handful of times my entire life. I've had them 6x here in the past year. I know they aren't for everyone, they certainly weren't for me, but I've sort of developed an addiction to them now that I've found these. (5)The RIB TIPS (not the ribs) are really good when they are hot and fresh. The problem here is sometimes they sit on the line for hours and overcook under the constant heat of the warmers. (4)My guests love the buffalo shrimp (4.5).Sides like the green beans, rice n' gravy, smashed yams are excellent. I really love the spicy grits with cheese and corn.MENU ITEMS I THINK ARE 'MEH'\\n* The ribs are not the best. but are much better when fresh (2 stars)\\n* The fried chicken leaves a little to be desired in  terms of flavor (2.5 stars)\\n* The smothered pork chops are good, not great (3 stars)\\n* The WHOLE catfish (1 star) is bland and not flavored the same as the catfish fillets; Not sure why.

I guess this means that even if it wasn't Disney, this place would be worth going to, but not a place I'd be a regular.I know people write a lot about having a hard time getting a reservation, but I didn't think it was that hard.  I had to book far in advance for restaurants such as Be Our Guest and Akershus, but I only had to book a couple weeks in advance for Le Cellier.  We did eat at 4:15 p.m., which not everyone is willing to do, but at least we didn't have to wait months, like we did with the aforementioned restaurants.We checked in exactly at 4:15 p.m. (I made my husband power walk to make it on time).  We had to wait a little bit for our table, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Inside just looks like a cellar type steakhouse.

The bread bowl comes with other types of bread, but the other two pale in comparison to the pretzel bread.  I would ask for just the pretzel bread.  I also liked that the butter came topped in brown sugar.  I'm a sweet and salty type of person.I ordered my filet very rare and it came cooked to perfection.  The risotto it came on was actually too cheesy for me.  This may be the first time I've ever said this, but overall I found the meal too cheesy.  The poutine was covered in cheese and it was too much for too strong a cheese.  It overpowered the french fries.  In the end I had to pick out the french fries.I'm glad we came so I can say I tried it, but it did not wow me enough to come back.

Service was quick. \\nWe ordered the Bourbon roll, the sushi chef made a specialty roll because my friend was a friend of his, and we each ordered our own bowls of the Tonkotsu ramen. \\nI must say, this place is my go to especially for the sushi. I enjoy that the rolls weren't doused in your typical spicy mayo, eel and sriracha. They've ventured to other toppings and experimented with flavors. I truly enjoyed the bourbon roll and it left a great impression - I'm definitely ordering it again. The other roll was amazing, it had old bay seasoning as a flavor to carry it - very delicious. I'll have to drag my friend to go just for this roll honestly. Their chefs are very creative, innovative and polite. \\nNow, the ramen - I'm definitely particular when it comes to ramen. I'm not saying I'm a pro when it comes to them but I do look for specifics especially with Tonkotsu ramen because it's my favorite. Seito did a great job representing the Tonkotsu ramen with the exception of the bone white broth BUT other elements of the ramen made up for it. The chashu was amazing! The meat was tender and the fatty parts of it were deeeeelicious - way better compared to other places that serve the meat chewy and over-charred. \\nOverall, I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend whoever is reading this to go. \\nThe service here was wonderful. We only had one server that came by (who wasn't ours) forget the spicy mayo my friend ordered but other than that the manager, our main server and sushi chefs were wonderful to interact with. \\nDefinitely make reservations. This place is popular for a reason!"},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food! Wait staff a little dry.

Victoria Drive is full of local Vietnamese businesses but I'll let you in on a secret: the local Vietnamese here in Vancouver are the ones who recommended this place, so you know this place has street cred!Of course, coming here doesn't mean you can just order anything. One dish that Hoang Yen is well known for is bun rieu, a type of crab flavoured noodle in soup dish that is rich in flavours. Another item that was brought to my attention was the bun cha ca dac biet, a special fish cake vermicelli noodle and soup.As someone who unfortunately cannot make Vietnamese food, this shop has a nice local \\"mom-and-pop\\" vibe so you know that the owners are cooking up something that feels close to home. And to remind you of the food culture in Asia, the tables are shared (a very common practice there, especially in busy restaurants) so get ready cozy to the stranger next to you. Coming here during peak times will usually mean sharing because the restaurant isn't too big. Just don't forget to bring cash because this place does not accept debit or credit.

We happily joined at the end, but little did we know that it would take 1 hour to get to the front of the line. Despite the shivering and freezing cold wind, everything was completely forgotten as soon as we sat down with our donuts and chai. Between the 3 of us, we split a dozen ($6.95) and we each got our own chai. The donuts are made to order and are so warm and delightful. It was the perfect way to start off a cold day. You have the choice of topping the donuts with a selection of flavors, and I was very happy with the ones we got. RAW HONEY AND SEA SALT: I loved this one. The honey wasn't overly sweet and it was balanced nicely with those little sprinkles of sea salt. The salty and savory combination is always a great flavor. \\nNUTELLA AND SEA SALT: Another one of the salty and sweet combinations, this donut is just so good. How could you go wrong with these toppings? \\nTHE DIRTY WU: Probably my favorite flavor I got! This one is a cinnamon sugar base with both nutella and honey! And yes, this is just as good as it sounds! \\nMEYER LEMON PEAR BUTTER (seasonal): I enjoyed this one because of how unique it is! But comparatively, it lacked the same kind of depth as the other flavors. I was glad I got it though because it's a seasonal one! \\nHEART OF GOLD: Wow, this chai is amazing. I got it with coconut milk and I was blown away by how incredible it was. First of all, nothing beats having a warm spicy drink when it's raining outside.

Opening the first napkin rollup with my knife and fork - fork was filthy - had to open a second setup to get clean utensils - OK, so the kitchen missed that one.  A few minutes a young waitress stopped by for my order - meatball sub and water.  She brought the water, dropped it fast and ran off - no straw, no offer of bread, no nothing.  She had some other tables with more than just one person at them, so I guess they get precedence.  Took about 15 minutes before my food arrived, meatball sub accompanied by pasta salad. She did stop long enough this time to give me a straw. The good - the pasta salad was good, I'd give it a 6-7 on a 1-10 scale.The bad - the meatball sub.  The meatballs are definately frozen from either Sysco or Sofo.  These are the small 1oz meatballs that you would serve at a cocktail party on a toothpick.  You get 4 of them in a very lightly applied amount of sauce - maybe if there was more sauce there'd be some flavor but all there was was the salty taste of packaged meatballs. - YUK!!No more waitress since dropping off the sandwich, no refill of drink, and this also seems to now have expanded to the table of 2 ladies to my left - they're getting mad - just plain no service.The waitress drops off the check - $7.50 for the sandwich plus 0.53 in tax.  I put down a $10. bill - she says - 'Do you want me to bring back the change?' - DUH, HELLO - you want a 27% tip for no service!!I'd avoid this place if I were you and go for a great hamburger across the street - and, wait in the line if it's long.

It's less then 10 minutes from my front door to sitting at a table, plus I love sushi and the Asian fusion items on the menu...well at least how they are described. Unfortunately, I just can't get down with Kona. I went a few months back for a birthday party and honestly can't remember what I had, but figured I give it another try Thursday night for their reverse happy hour. I left $30 lighter and with another unmemorable experience.First off- I had weak drinks. The whole purpose of happy hour is to get a good drink at a reasonable price. I had 2 cosmos and a lady margarita (totaling $14) in a span an hour and a half and left with only a slight buzz. Maybe not a big deal, but if I'm going out for happy hour, I want to be able to enjoy a decent drink or two and not pay out the nose to do so. (Sidenote: I'm a struggling 20-something so it's my mission to find good happy hours where I can get a few drinks for $15 or less). I will give them kudos for having a good tasting cosmo.Second- The sushi rolls. I had the crab special and spicy tuna. I know- I know- I know- EVERYONE says in their reviews \\"I've had better sushi at HEB!\\" Well, I really don't like the sushi at HEB, but I will say I've had better sushi at Randall's - for real, the Randall's in Lakeway has some pretty decent stuff. I work out there and it's my go-to for lunch once a week. Kona's however? Not much flavor at all. I was just a big blob of rice with some mush in the middle that tasted vaguely tuna-esqe. Now my friend got the crunchy crab roll that I managed to snag a bite of that was pretty decent. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe I just picked some of the lesser-quality rolls, but a sad time for my taste-buds indeed.We also split the ahi wonton chips. It's seared ahi tuna, place on fried wonton chips and finished with a sauce. Sadly - again - my taste-buds were left searching for the flavor. It was beautifully plated and looked like it would taste amazing- but just fell short.Overall- I feel like this whole place is beautifully plated, but doesn't follow through where it matters. I all looks and sounds good, but nothing I had made me want to come back for more."},{"name":"New Mei Garden","address":"954 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"2.5","text":"Worst chinese food ive ever had in my life and thats saying alot because everyone knows chinese can be hit or miss sometimes.The chicken fingers were wwwwaaaayyyyy over cooked.

The service is usually pretty good and the atmosphere is nice, dark, and intimate albeit a bit stuffy. The real issue I have is that I feel some menu items are overpriced and for a small portion. Maybe I've eaten in too many Italian homes, restaurants in other cities, and in Italy where the portions were generous and flavors amazing. Here though, I haven't experienced that. For example, their tuna tartare appetizer was $19 and it was only ok. Their full order of spaghetti pomodoro e melanzane dish is meatless and it's $20. Unless you're a bird, I would be shocked if it would fill you up by itself.I remember they make sure to tell you how their pasta is all made in house which is great and I'm a big fan of that. However, while I prefer it that way, making your own pasta in house is not exceptionally difficult; it's done all over. I worked for an Italian restaurant in Chicago that made their own pasta in house, I helped. Maybe they feel they can charge more because of that. They may also feel being on South Congress justifies a higher price too. I'm speculating, but that'd be my guess.I hate to complain about price. There are places where you pay a lot for a small portion, but you felt it was worth it. I just don't feel that here. As my dear Fabiana, a born and bred Roman has said to me, \\"You should never pay more than 10-12 euros tops for a great plate of pasta.\\" I realize this isn't Rome, but you get the point. Some of my favorite legitimate Italian places in other cities don't have pasta dishes for more than $16 and they would blow what I've had at Vespaio out of the water and you'd be full afterwards. Their food here is good, their lasagna in particular is tasty, and their service is solid, I just feel there are perhaps some delusions of grandeur over what they feel their food/dining experience is worth."},{"name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"4105 SW 117th Ave, Ste A","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"I got the Italian mini sub.

The ambiance is classic and elegant.Once seated, we had the option to order from the Chef's Nightly Special, which is served Tuesday - Friday from 5:30-6:30 PM or to choose from the Chef's Seasonal Menu. My heart was set on the herb crusted lamb so I opted for the seasonal menu.To start, we ordered the brussel spouts with candied blue cheese, beets, bacon, poached pear and dressed honey mustard. It was a delightful surprise - light, refreshing, and I appreciated the beautiful preparation. Anytime that I ear raw vegetables, I feel healthier - added bonus. Next, we were served the grilled lamb belly with caulini (think a sweeter cauliflower), soft egg, and crispy shallot.So, I wasn't sure if I was going to like the crabcake with blueberries and I was right. Honestly, it wasn't the blueberries that threw me off, but it was actually the texture of the crab cake that was mushy instead of crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I actually sent this item back and they returned it to the table with a better texture, but I would pass on the crabcake.For our entrees, Ken ordered the seared crusted halibut with lentils, celeriac pinenut mousse with mushroom & bacon jam. I knew there were lentils, but in my heart I wanted them to be capers. The halibut was perfectly cooked.

I really liked that dish, but it was way too small to be considered a dinner. My fiance ate the penne tricolore with the bufala mozzarella, mushrooms, basil and vodka sauce. He enjoyed his, and said the pasta was slightly al dente. I also had a glass of the chianti (which was a bit buttery/dairy tasting for me), and our total bill was about $40. Gotta love it.

The restaurant was super crowded at lunch time but my friend and I were able to grab two seats immediately. My friend ordered the Norwegian poke bowl while i was debating on Dan Dan or House Ramen (ordered latter). The dishes came super quick, fantastic for those who only have an hour of lunch break. Very generous portions so my friend was able to finish half and took the rest home. The ramen was cooked perfectly, not soggy at all. Fatty pork chunks that melted in my mouth. The shredded pickles helped balance the saltiness of the broth. It was a poached egg instead of Ajitsuke Tamago (half egg with runny yolk). I mixed them all together as if i was eating bim bim bap. Similar to other yelpers, the service was meh. Server took our orders and disappeared. She resurfaced when we asked her to pack the rest to go.  Payment process took a while and we were so tempted to bring the bills up front to pay. We asked our server about the unfinished entree that she boxed but she was confused and said in an unapologetic tone \\"can't find it, probably tossed\\" She told us to wait and asked the chef to put in the same order but it came out in a super tiny take out box (obviously less than what my friend didn't finish). The box probably can fit 4 tiny shumai!The menu prices need to be adjusted online.

The combo would be a better deal as you get rice with 2 dishes for $8.95. The dishes looked very appetizing and the staff was quick to describe each item.

Brie said it's the one thing that shouldn't be skipped in this restaurant. And I totally agree with her. That crust, so so good, so well seasoned and flavorful. The garlic bulb was roasted to perfection that you can squeeze it out and spread it like butter. Yup, Brie said spread it all over the ribeye. This was the first time i finished the whole garlic bulb in one seating. It perfectly complimented the ribeye. Steak was awesome on it own, or with a dab of the hot and mustard sauce. I never had ribeye in the states this good. Salivating now!The brisket: Brie gave me a few complimentary  slices of brisket to try it out since it's my first time in town to have a taste of Texas BBQ. (Did I say I love Brie??? I love Brie!) Brie did recommended the pull pork over the brisket though. I should have listened to her. Brisket a little dry. And after I tasted the ribeye, nothing else really matters.The salad - Classic iceberg wedge: only me so I asked for half size. Came out in just right portion for me but looked so cute in a tiny plate, made me laugh. Not a lot of real estate to maneuver but the taste was spot on and very yummy.

My lunch companion at Kona appeared to enjoy her \\"Bama\\" roll, but I'm not even going to try to describe what it was, since I just can't think of that stuff as sushi. Incidentally, we asked what the roll was named after, and the reply was \\"Alabama.\\"  Her crème brûlée dessert did look and sound great, especially if you're into crackling sugar -- why am I thinking \\"Men in Black?\\" For me, the best thing about Kona Grill is their staff -- since I arrived early, the hostess and I reviewed the entire ARW lunch menu while I was waiting, she did it with complete charm and candor, and I regret not getting her name. And how should I put this: Our server Mandy was just flat out fantastic. I admire people who appear to enjoy what they do and excel at doing it.

A restaurant that was visited by Guy Fieri from \\"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\\" (Food Network). We typed the restaurant into our GPS and we were on the way. **Parking: As we drove up Peachtree Street Northeast we saw the restaurant and a parking garage. We headed into the parking garage and asked the attendant if parking was free for restaurant customers. The attendant stated yes, but we had to obtain a parking validation from the restaurant. In addition, we were only allowed free parking for one hour. We maneuvered through the parking garage to the restaurant. As we walked in the hostesses stand was immediately to the left of the door. The hostess took our names and we sat in front of a pastry display. Our names were called in less than 15 minutes and we were seated and one of the best tables on their front patios. Our waiter, Adrian, quickly came to table to greet us and ask for our orders. *Entree: Shrimp and Grits \\nThe playing was visually stunning, yet the plates were rather large in comparison to the actual meal. Nonetheless, the grits were seasoned to perfection and they were velvety smooth. The plate was garnished with a twist of lemon and just the right amount of green onion. The shrimp came served tail on and they even decorated the top of the grit bowl. *Entree: Chicken Burger with Home fries (from the Brunch menu)\\nI ordered the chicken burger with a side of home fries. The chicken patty was mixed with spinach and feta. The burger was topped with bacon, provolone, and jalapeño & chipotle aioli. The chicken patty was a few inches smaller than the bun. The patty and toppings were delicious, yet the patty was a little dry and called for more aioli to relieve the dryness. The home fries were also seasoned well but in my opinion they called for a dipping sauce. Overall this restaurant deserves a B. The location of the restaurant is excellent for an after meal walk, parking is free for a hour in the parking deck, the outside patio is great for nice days, and the seasoning of the two items we tried were good.

My favorite shops, such as the chocolate shop, lego store, big mall area, and soap shop, are all on the eastern portion of the property, while the aforementioned Cirque du Soleil, movie theater, bowling alley, and DisneyQuest are on the western portion. While everything down at Disney Springs is fun to visit, I rarely actually make it down there because everything is wildly overpriced, especially the restaurants. While a few of the restaurants are worth it (Lave Lounge, T-Rex Restaurant, Boathouse), most of the restaurants serve fairly generic food that isn't worth the trip. While it is great to have an AMC Fork & Dine here in Orlando, the tickets and food is astronomical when compared to other similar options in Orlando and even throughout other parts of Florida. Furthermore, while the stores and outdoor musical acts are fun to see, most of the stores in general don't rotate their inventory very much, so there are only a handful of stores worth checking out if you have visited previously.

I found the skin to be very crispy and the warm had just the right kick of spice for those of us who don't like super spicy food. The outside parts of the chicken were juicy but I found the inside to be less tender and juicy. I opted out of cole slaw but the Mac was pretty good. It isn't your grandmas souther Mac, and was a little too cheesy for me, but overall it was bearable. They also offer sweetened and unsweetened tea at no additional charge, which is amazing. Seating is a punch of community style benches so be prepared to sit very close to others. Hopefully I can come back and try the wings the next time I'm in Columbus. And hopefully the line isn't 30 minutes long"},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Outside, this looks something that you would see in a movie.

I didn't see any desserts with hot fudge, and when we asked the sever, he said they didn't carry it, just chocolate sauce. I found that very odd for a place that specializes in many different sweet items for sale. Oh well. We ordered a custom dessert, warm brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce on the side.

My fist visit was 6/12/09 and I was really concerned that they really were not open yet to public and just using me as practice for when they were actually open and it was a very bad and clumsy practice and I felt uncomfortable the whole time even though my sushi was delicious. I was driving home from work and starving since I had not taken a lunch break and looked over and saw the Coming Soon sign was down but no Open sign yet. I saw that the hours posted on the door was 5:00 - 11:00 so I opened the door and stood there and waited and waited until a young man finally came out and looked startled to see me. I asked if they were open yet and with a yes he led me to the sushi counter. I was the only customer that night at an early dinning hour and blame that experience on first day open jitters. After reading Stephanie's review I new I had to try it again and armed with a 10% discount coupon that they gave me my first visit I headed over with a neighbor who was also anticipating their opening. My neighbor and I walked over (less than 10 minute walk from my house = sweet/or dangerous to my wallet:) and were immediately and graciously seated at the beautiful curved sushi bar by a sweet young Asian woman. The decor is typical minimalistic Asian decor with pretty painted windows. The fish on both visits was super fresh and flavorful. They have a great selection of traditional rolls and some great unique rolls that are their own creations that are all beautifully plated. Last Tuesday we started with a flavorful miso soup each and shared Salmon Sashimi, 2 pieces each of Unagi, and super fresh yet richly flavored cucumber roll filled with smoked salmon, avocado and cream cheese ( I absolutely loved the outside crunch of the cucumber). As of Tuesday they were still without a liquor licence; but, you can BYOB. I want to give them 5 stars because they are within walking distance from my house; but, that would not help anyone who does not and simply they are not \\"as good as it gets\\" as far as sushi goes.

I still stand by the statement that this place is on the pricey side, but given the location of yuppies it's not unusual. This is not the best place to go for a very warm day. They have an open air set up in the front, but the back booths receive no circulation between the exposed brick walls. I appreciated that they had some non-alcoholic drinks to help cool off. I ordered the beach comber since I didn't want to start sweating. They also gave us a bottle of room temperature water that I proceeded to dump into my generous helping of ice remaining. One of the other people ordered a glass of wine and they originally under-filled the portion because they ran out from the bottle... That's never fun.For dinner I went with a group of 5 so 2 dishes per person yielded 10+ options. To start off we ordered 2 of each of the oyster options as well. Perhaps I'm not an expert but they all tasted rather similar... for $3.50 a piece that adds up quickly. Afterwards we tried the BLT wraps, Tuna Poke (spicy), Smoked Kielbasa, The Manti x2, King Crab Fried Rice, Kalbi Short Ribs, Mahi Mahi Nachos. I really enjoyed the BLT wrap (the bacon was so hot!) and The Mantis! Our waiter described it perfectly that the Istanbul Meat Ravioli (Manti) tasted like the perfect last morsel of a taco. Sadly the King Crab Fried Rice disappointed me and it was one of the few dishes left unfinished. Also very strange that they gave us the Kalbi Short Ribs on a wooden cutting board, but no steak knife! We had to use our regular butter knife to cut through. The various kimchi sides were nice though.Even though I was nearly bursting at the seams, we ordered 2 desserts to share. The Chocolate Mousse and the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough served on a mixing spoon. Seriously strange it looked like it was removed from a KitchenAid standing mixer... It was inconvenient using a spoon to try and maneuver the cookie dough off. I'll admit both were good. The condiments to mix with the mousse weren't introduced very clearly so some of my dining companions added way too much salt which they probably thought was a candy."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Solid place for breakfast if you're in the area.

Staple house is like two restaurants in one.  The very casual back porch, soon to be winterized, is first come first served and has its own menu and kitchen, located in a shed in the back yard.

You can eat on the porch for less than $30 each.The gorgeously renovated dining room with $85 prefix menu that changes almost daily is reservation only.  There are five courses.  Couples can get just one meal and share.  Also, the bar takes walk ins, if you're lucky enough to get a seat.  At the bar you can individually order the items on the prefix menu.

I enjoyed it so much more then the previous time. Our hot food came out in a timely manner and it was hot!  We got wings and potstickers in this department. Very happy that we came back!\\n--------------------------------------Our sweet friends treated us to a yummy lunch here last weekend. We enjoyed it very much!  Our friend ordered nearly all of the appetizers: the special French fries with sauce, the sishito peppers,  the dumplings/potstickers, the pork bao, and both the soy garlic and the spicy chili ones. The wings were very crispy and the sauces were good. I enjoyed them a lot except the chili ones were cold. Not room temp, but cold throughout. If the sauce is what made them cold then they wouldn't be cold by the bone - they were. We enjoyed them so much we didn't care that they weren't hot but I'm still perplexed at how they were crispy (fresh) yet cold. The soy ones were not cold. They were perfect. The sishito peppers were bitter and not quite crispy the way I like them. They were my least favorite bite of the day. They are topped with bonito (which I don't like) *suggestion to the owners, make the descriptions on the menu a little more detailed please. I would have asked for no bonito had I known it was part of it. The kids enjoyed the potstickers/dumplings very much. I didn't get a chance to try the fries or bao because I eat Keto and I splurged on the wings but the table seemed to enjoy them. For 2 of the kids we ordered chicken and beef bulgogi. Though they were the very first orders put in, they were the very last items to come out. Had we not had appetizers the kids would have gone crazy. We were done with our poke bowls (more on that below) before their food came out. When it did, it was hot, plentiful and they really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the poke. It was fresh and tasty. I haven't experienced a poke place that charges so much for additions. You only get 2 or 3 things from each category and you have to pay $1+ for extra stuff. The last place we went had just as many choices but no charge for anything once you buy the bowl. I didn't like that. I didn't want to add a bunch of stuff because our friends were treating us and I felt like it was unnecessary. My bowl was delicious and fresh as I said. So, consensus is we really liked it. I would have given 4 stars if the kids food hadn't take so long, the peppers weren't bitter, the wings on the cold side and them allowing a few more topping options without charging more (ie: I don't want to pay $1 each for a sprinkling of cilantro and green onion).

After being seated we were completely ignored by all servers. We were not greeted and told they would be right with us or anything of any nature. We sat for another 25 minutes and watched as the server helped people who were seated after us and were completely ignored. We even flagged down a server who held up one finger to us to wait then proceeded to ignore us.

We sure were!All these fun waits, in addition to the hour and 10 mins they told us we would be waiting to be seated. An hour and ten mins on a Saturday is completely reasonable, but the extra 50-60 mins was a little obnoxious when all we did was keep standing in lines.Josh, the manager offered us two free appetizers, which they forgot to ring in when they brought the check. The food took almost an hour to get to us, even though we ordered the second we sat down. The moment our food came, we ordered shakes. Those took at least 30 mins to come, and they honestly were a waste of money and calories. They tasted like Splenda mixed with shaving cream.After all of this hassle, the manager offered to comp the entire meal after they had already swiped our card, and my family was so ready to get out of there, we passed on the free meal.

Also, everyone in our group is part of the service industry, so we always try to give places the benefit of the doubt when things go wrong but we most definitely know what to expect when we go eat. Walking up, everything was absolutely stunning. The view was wonderful, and the line outside the door was moving very quickly, shortly to find out there was a wait. Of course, it's sunset time, we didn't expect much less. We went to the bar and ordered drinks- the margaritas taste like straight lime juice which we were so disgusted with we sent it back (which we felt awful for being \\"those people\\"). 30 minutes into waiting to be sat i noticed there was at least 15 open and clean tables on their patio, and no one is being seated even though the busser was continually yelling to the host there was clean tables. We finally got sat, and we had to ask the family next to us to remove their purses and belongings from our seats. Assuming this table had actually been open long enough for a whole family to put ALL of their belonging on the table. Kenyan came and greated us and we ordered a tea and water the Chicken Diablo appetizer, which came as the same time as our meal, and before our tea and water. Too add to it, we did not get the Shrimp Diablo that was ordered, we got the shrimp tacos. We asked him nicely to fix it, so another 15 minutes later we finally got the $25 5 piece shrimp, average rice, and undercooked vegetables we ordered. There was no prebussing done until the next last second of our meal, empty glasses and plates everywhere even though we stacked them for him trying to help (again, our whole group was full of servers. We do those things). 10 minutes later he came back from dropping off our plates in the dish pit to get our checks. Lastly, after all the trouble and apparent misunderstanding from the server, I asked him why if he had messed up why he didn't discount our food. And yes, we were being those people again. Knowing myself, when I make a mistake on a table, I try to make it up to them. He told me he couldn't discount a table unless they asked for one, which made me more frustrated. You can't walk up to your manager and say \\"Hey, I messed up pretty bad and they're a little upset. Would you mind discounting their ticket for me?\\" After we finally got THAT taken care of, walking out we heard a couple screaming that they're never coming back and we asked why. Apparently, this restaurant closes right after sundown and wouldn't serve a couple that flew all the way from Virginia to have a nice romantic get away and wouldn't serve them at 8:40 in the evening, which is wild. I've never heard of such a \\"high-end\\" place closing so early.

They offer a range of sweets from traditional fruit pies to individual pastries. I've tried a number of their offerings and have to say their scones are probably the best item on the menu. They often run out by 12pm, so you have to get there early to snag some. Their pies are good too, but they are fairly pricy ($25+ for a large pie) and not that distinguishable from a pie you can get at your local grocery store. Don't get me wrong, they're usually better, but only marginally. The scones, though, are heavenly. Not too sweet, very light, and rich with flavor.In terms of the pies, the traditional Pecan was by far the best we tried. Chocolate Pecan was okay, and mixed berry was our least facorite pie we had. I also had the double baked almond bread and was amazed. It isn't always available, but when it is make sure to try that too. Petsi is definitely a local favorite, so lines can get long.

I thought service was fast, we were seated immediately, got drinks quickly (there is also complimentary hot tea in carafes already on the table), and the food came out earlier than expected.  Pricing on the dishes is kind of steep. $19 on average for an BBQ meat dish seems like it is on the higher side but one can feed two and you do get four complimentary Ban Chan side dishes (kim chee, turnip kim chee, Korean seaweed salad, and sweet soy potatoes) as well as rice.  I caution everyone on the spice level, you can choose of how spicy you want it and \\"spicy\\" is two degrees more than spicy.  The hubby and I love spice but this was on the higher end of hot and we needed lots of white rice and beer to calm that fire down. Through all of that spice the chicken we ordered was delicious though.   I can see of why others think that you don't get the value for what you are paying with the meat dishes. There isn't a lot of meat, and they do sub in loads of onions, mushrooms, zucchini slices, and those Korean dumpling circle noodle like pieces.  Our total bill came to $29 which is fabulous for lunch and I can see of why this is a popular place to get your Korean bbq fix.#VanCity #Vancouver"},{"name":"Yanagi","address":"4404 W William Cannon Dr, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Large restaurant with over 24 tables, a sushi bar and regular bar area.

My husband and I were in the North End looking for an Italian restaurant that got great reviews on Yelp for being gluten-free. After trying to find it for fifteen minutes in the cold and rain, we finally call only to have them tell us that they have moved and are closed anyway. So defeated and starving, we pass by Massimino's. The man at the door tells that not only do they have gluten-free pasta, but they can make any dish I want gluten-free. Sold!However, when we get inside it is quite a different story. The waitress informs us that the only gluten-free pasta they have is linguine. Okay, no problem, I order something with linguine. Then she comes out and says that it will be a $5 additional fee. Five dollars! I've been charged $1 or $2 before, which I get because gluten-free pasta is slightly more expensive and you have to cook it in a separate pot. But a $5 fee says to me that this place is only interested in taking advantage of its customers with food allergies.At this point I normally would have walked out, but we were cold, wet, starving and not sure where else I could find something to eat nearby, so I agreed to it. But when the waitress brought the food out, it was awful. The pasta was almost mush it was so overcooked. And the sauce itself was not good either. It was at that point that I sent my food back, the one only time I've ever had to do so. It was at this time, when I'm without food and starving and pissed off, waiting for my husband to quickly finish his food so we can leave, that the violin player comes up to our table.

They had told me they were going to make a reservation and I am glad they did. We saw multiple people come up and ask for a table who did not have a reservation and each time they were turned away! When we arrived we were told they were running about 10 to 15 minutes behind on all the reservations. Thankfully they had some water so that we could get a drink and wait for the table.Once we were finally seated we had a lovely waitress come to our table and get our drink orders. My friends I was with were on the Disney Deluxe Dining Plan and they found out this would count as 2 of their meal allowances. The Deluxe Dining plan is awesome! They each received an appetizer, entree, and desert and 1 drink alcoholic or non-alcoholic. Also the portions were huge! I unfortunately was not on the dining plan so I had to pay, but it was okay! My friend who was on the dining plan decided she did not want the appetizer so she offered it up to me! I had her Beer Cheese Soup! The Soup was phenomenal! It was pleasant and airy and had some back on top! They give you complimentary pretzel bread on the table and it was mighty nice to dip in the soup!For my main course and pretty much everyone's main course at my table we got the fillet! The Filet was a AAA Canadian Tenderloin and it came with mushroom risotto, asparagus-tomato relish, and truffle-butter sauce. It was really good. But was it the best steak I have ever had. No way. It was an expensive cut of meat, but the steak alone did not have a ton of flavor! For Dessert I did not oder anything, but my friends got the Carmel Cream Brûlée. It was really good and I had a few bites of his!  Overall it was a good meal, but for sure was not my favorite meal at Epcot! I have now ate at every restaurant in Epcot and am proud of that!

This is one of the best places I've ever been to eat.  I split a whole bird with my friend, so we could each sample the dark and white meat.  They offer four different spice levels: cold, warm, hot, and holy.  To experience true hot chicken, we got it \\"hot\\"- and it is definitely very hot, and very delicious (I may consider ordering it \\"warm\\" next time).  The chicken may be the best fried chicken I've had (close competition with Mya's).  The skin is perfectly crispy!  They offer housemade ranch sauce at no extra charge, and it's the perfect dipping partner for the fried goodness/chicken (and it helps tame the heat).  The sweet tea is also complimentary, and it hits the spot.  We ordered sides of mac and cheese and slaw.  Both of them were out of this world, especially the mac and cheese!  To end on a sweet note, I tried the banana pudding- you should do the same!The food is amazing, but what makes Hot Chicken Takeover truly special is the community feel.  The owner/Head Fryer, Joe, is super friendly and generous.  He checks on all of his guests, and is happy to chat.  He made me feel very welcome, and even remembered my name.

My brother and sister-in-law came here last night for a date and loved it. So today we all came back as a family with the kiddos, and we didn't have nearly the same experience. My nieces were playing with the toys quietly and calmly. They weren't being \\"those kids\\". They weren't running around or being obnoxious. They were just playing with the games, entertaining themselves as we ate. The first issue: the manager approaches the children - not one of the three adults present, and says, \\"Give me that, now,\\" in the most rude voice after my nieces played with the can phone - again, they didn't do anything wrong.The second issue: the manager approaches our table and asks if we can get our children under control so that they're closer to our table and not so \\"spread out.\\" We asked if they were bothering anyone, as we were the closest table to the game table. She said that people were \\"giving her looks,\\" and that she didn't want them to lose pieces of the games. The games were fine, all in one place, and they weren't combining the boxes or anything that could be perceived as messing up the games. At this point the children are heartbroken thinking they did something wrong, and our Sunday is going in a direction it shouldn't have gone at a \\"kid friendly\\" brewery. The third issue: my sister-in-law, the mother, is fuming because her children did nothing wrong, nor did we as the adults in charge of them. She makes her rounds to the few customers (it's noon on a Sunday, it's not exactly packed) to apologize if her children bothered them and she was met with nothing but kindness. Everyone raved about how cute the kids were and how sweetly they were playing. So my sister-in-law goes to the counter and tells the manager that nobody is bothered by her children, and she says, \\"You intimidated them to say that.\\" This couldn't be further from the truth. The fourth and final issue: We ask to talk to the manager, not knowing it was her the whole time that was being so unprofessional and so rude, and she just says, \\"It's me.\\" We ask for her name, and after giving it, she condescendingly says, \\"You're so welcome,\\" repeatedly as we are walking out the door.

Blueberries were sweet and boba was perfect consistency. Didn't love the flavor combination. OVERALL\\nDefinitely recommend trying their drinks! Slightly pricier than other boba in Boston, but their quality is better. I wish they offered drinks in different sizes and had longer hours.

We have hit most of the places at easton, but she had never been to Adobe Gilas so we stopped in. The waitresses we very polite and told us to sit anywhere right away, and she came over within a minute to take our drink order. My daughter ordered a plain cheeseburger (her safe fallback) and fries. I ordered the grilled chicken quesadillas.Her burger was a pretty impressive size, and was brought out just as she requested, just cheese and fries. Most places will still add the lettuce, tomato, onion etc.. She said the burger was pretty good, but not the greatest in the world. I tried a bite and could tel it was most likely a frozen premade patty that they just threw on the grill. But like I said, it was a pretty decent size for $7.00.My quesadilla on the other hand was not so big. It had plenty of cheese and chicken in it, but the size of it was more on scale of an App, not an $8.00 entree. It tasted ok, but the flavors were just basic. Resembled something you could whip up at home in the microwave.One of the bigger issues was the cleanliness of the tables. The table itself was mostly ok, had a few sticky spots here and there, but the condiments were as my daughter said..\\"disgusting!\\". The ketchup and hot sauce bottles were all less than half empty and covered in stains and dried sauce. The cap to the ketchup was pretty much sealed up with gunk the looked almost green.Again, the waitresses were nice and prompt.

Nice Marriott flanked by two shopping malls and conveniently located in the heart of Back Bay.Great service.  The only problem I had with the room was that when you're out -- or asleep -- the thermostat cuts off.  If there's activity in the room, it'll stay on, or periodically come on.  But if there's no movement, it senses that you're out, so to conserve energy, it cuts off.  It gets hot at night!  GREAT view from the 32nd floor.Also, the bathroom doesn't have a fan.  Gets humid after a shower, which I hate, because you start to sweat.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  And the pocket doors take some getting used to, even though they're great for space-saving.The elevators are REALLY slow, especially the set for the upper levels.  They're supposedly fixing that.The on site banquet food service is not great, either.  None of the meals provided for the conference were all that great -- one of them being filet and what looked like homefries.  For a fancy dinner?  Terrible.  The chicken and asparagus provided for a luncheon was also tasteless.Adequate gym (didn't seem to be too full or not be able to accommodate all who were there when I was).  Great Dollar Rent-a-Car right on site.  Pricey, but convenient to drop off with the valet.The tech folks for the breakout rooms were really fast and accommodating.

Sometimes you want to do that in sweatpants and a t-shirt with holes and know you're in a safe place. Pizza Bruno is not a grungy place by any means, but an excellent hole in the wall to come exactly as you are. First thing to know: this place gets BUSY. If you're feeling risky on a weekend night, you could be in for a bit of a wait for a table. But fear not, you can still live it up with a drink from the bar. Inside is definitely a little dark, but not in a creepy way. The staff is really kind and friendly, and talks it up with everyone like they've been coming in the door for years. They make sure everyone fits in right away. Now let's talk about the real MVP of this place: THE GARLIC KNOTS. If you want to know what love at first taste looks like, take a bite out of these. You will forever be changed. The dough is soft, it's perfectly smothered with garlic and cheese, and the marinara is truly a bonus. I will go there and order only a side of knots and not think twice about it. Next up: kale caesar salad. I know, it feels like a sin that I even said that. But guys, it's worth every single bite. The kale isn't bitter, and the golden raisins and candid nuts is a perfect addition. The pizza is also a crowd pleaser! Personally, it's not my favorite in the city nor does it draw me in to go there for it. But if someone is going to offer me a slice the answer is ABSOLUTELY yes. What does stop this place from getting a perfect 5-stars from me is that I want the desserts to be stepped up a notch. I wish I had a suggestion, but it's just missing something. The cannolis are good, but the Nutella pizza pie is a little much after such a carb heavy meal. Seasonal dessert pies are an option as well! Whatever you're doing this weekend, abandon those plans.

My server just didn't seem to be too bright. I had a lot of trouble explaining what I needed for some reason.

She came over several times to take our orders when we weren't ready and she definitely showed that she wasn't having it... Nice very friendly of her, not sure what the deal was. At first she came around often and then she didn't come at all, she didn't check on us and the food nor did she made sure we were good once we got our food. Definitely didn't have a good customer service experienceDollar\\nIt was a pretty dollar. A slice of Salmon sashimi was $3 and you had to order at least 2 pieces. I thought I had to order at least 2 pieces of sashimi of any kind but it was 2 of them same kind... My drink was 12 and it tasted like juice....Yes?\\nI am personally not a fan of fancy expensive sushi places. I definitely had better experiences at different sushi restaurants.

All were really good, and I REALLY liked the chutneys, even better than Dosa House. The Dosa itself, different but equally tasty (I'm undecided which I like better).What our service lacked in spit and polish (which did not bother me), was made up for by genuine effort to connect with the customer and share knowledge about the food.  Our waiter gave us a free dessert for being new and it was awesome, some sort of donut ball floating in a spiced honey mixture.The decor is less ghetto than some Indian places, but 2 odd things struck me: 2 TVs running infomercials and the cash register \\"table\\" takes up 1 of the 2 prime window spots! Please move that, so more people can coax in customers! (it also served to darken the natural light).On the downside, is price.  Dosas can be cheaper elsewhere but when you think of the size of this place and neighbourhood, it isn't that bad,.. these things are huge so sharing is an option (at $15 not so bad),.. but there is an even better way to approach Masala Dosa: specials nights.

They truly don't give a [--]. When your food is badly prepared they do nothing. When your server ignores you to the point that tables sat after you are eating before you and you have to get your order to go, they could care less. When your delivery order takes well over an hour, and a manager lies to you on the phone telling you it's on it's way to have it still not arrive 20 minutes later (and you live seconds away) they do nothing and show you attitude when you call back. Worst customer service I have ever had in a restaurant. They are busy now because they just renovated and have a new space, but restaurants are a dime a dozen and crap customer service like that means it won't stay busy for long.

A couple blocks down is another shop, Modern, also known for cannolis, which are actually filled-to-order so it's guaranteed fresh.  However, we opted for Mike's, trusting the long line of people that was trickling out the door. Once inside, the cannolis were visible front and center so we could tell they were the signature item. There are about 20 flavors to choose from, all of which are displayed high above the back counter. Considering the crowd, the line did move pretty quickly, but also provided us with enough time to decide on our order. I tried the traditional Chocolate Chip cannoli, so I could taste the true flavors and understand what the hype is about. The ricotta filling was very creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness with a slight tang. Although good, it was quite heavy and became a bit too much (I \\"cannoli\\" eat about half, haha). The outer shell was crispy but I would have liked it to be flakier if possible. Each cannoli is about $4, but they are of substantial size. It may even be enough for two people. Keep in mind that the bakery is CASH only.**TIP: I would say the cannoli is worth it for a occasional treat, but don't overlook the other desserts, which all look amazing!  The variety that Mike's offers is huge...with countless trays holding everything from cookies, to lobster tail pastries, cakes, and even marzipan shaped into fruits!

Arriving at Mike's Pastry you'll see about a million people haphazardly lined up under harsh fluorescent lights all vying for a chance to order like it's The Hunger Games.

Apparently it's all part of the Mike's Pastry experience.I have never seen so many cannoli flavors in my life. I have never seen cannoli so giant in my life. I have never seen human arms turbo wrap a string around a box like they do here in my life. The menu is vast if not overwhelming and yet it's hard to come away impressed by anything. The pistachio cannolo I had was mediocre at best, reliant on overly sweet filling for most of its flavor. There was something weirdly whipped about the cream which, aside from the saccharine taste, was sitting in a dense exterior that had already moistened and lost its flake. Lest anyone forget the primary flavor in this classic dessert should be CHEESE. Cannoli are supposed to have a rich yet refined taste and should not be sweet enough to send you into hyperglycemic shock. Bakeries in the USA use cow's milk ricotta and overdo the powdered sugar to thicken it up, leaving little of the ricotta flavor in the process. This creates something that's cloyingly sweet, compared to cannoli filling in Italy where the sheep's milk ricotta is denser and has a bit of tang, allowing it to balance well with any added sugar. Sometimes chocolate morsels are mixed in or there's a candied fruit applied to the outer ends for added flavor and texture. The shell should be thin, light, and flaky, just formidable enough to hold the silky filling within. Shells and filling should be kept separate until an order is placed, ensuring a crunchy outside and a cold smooth inside in every bite. Doesn't that sound great? You won't find any of that here.All the people raving about how these are the bestest cannoli in the universe have yet to experience the delight and taste of real Italian cannoli. These are sugar, pure and simple, and far from the best dessert you'll find.

Another review from the skinny guy with a fat guy heart. Sooo...does the food at this place wow me...nah. Is it still a solid four star experience...yep!This place is located pretty much right across from Piedmont Hospital. It is park of a retail plaza that includes a CVS, a couple other eateries and some other stuff I honestly didn't pay much attention to (my stomach was growling). The BEST thing about this place is that it is one of few affordable \\"lunch\\" places I can think of in Midtown/Buckhead where parking is not really an issue. Sure you don't have a parking issue at Houston's up the street either but who wants to spend $20 for lunch. Not I!! This plaza has a parking lot in the back and usually has at least a handful on spaces available.OK..now to the service and food. The service has always been consistently friendly. Nothing particularly memorable but nothing that would stop you from coming. The prices on the gyros, kabob plates and wings are absolutely exceptional for this part of time...particularly when considering the quality of food you are receiving. Portion are also a reasonable size. I have never had leftover but I have not left hungry either.This time I ordered a Tilapia Gyro with fries. Came to $7.71. Now a couple of things. Of course I doubt is it really a part of their cuisine. Perhaps someone will correct me but this is the first time I've EVER seen a fish gyro offered anywhere. Not at any Turkish, Lebanese, Palestinian, etc...place I've ever been to. But while maybe not authentic I appreciate the fact that they offer some assimilated offerings that you may just be craving as I was. As a matter of fact I don't even eat Tilapia (google it and you'll understand why). The fries were fresh, hot, crispy and golden brown. Pretty much perfect. Personally I could have used a bit more seasoning salt..but the fact that I didn't ask (didn't want to OD on salt) probably means that for most people its sufficient. The pita was fresh. No hint of staleness which is a huge pet peeve of mine and can definitely ruin a sandwich/gyro. The tartar was tangy and creamy. The tartar actually saved the sandwich in the sense that the fish imho could have been seasoned a little better. But the tartar served as its seasoning. The lettuce tasted a touch old but it could have been just a lack of leafy lettuce. Most if not all the lettuce in this sandwich was iceberg. Would have been nice to have something with a bit more weight. All and all for the food you get; in the location you get it; with the ease of parking I cannot give less than a 4 star experience. However, if you're looking for REALLY REALLY good Mediterranean (I believe Israeli) head to Aviva by Kameel.

Paying ~$6 for a cup of cinnamon flavored bathtub water that barely had the Smokey flavor of an unwashed spatula certainly fell short of what I was promised. Moving onto the not-so-Star of the show, the donuts. I didn't realize that the base of all their donuts would be the same, and it's simply the toppings that differentiate the flavors. We got candied bacon, mango chili (seasonal), Nutella, honey and sea salt, and a dirty wu (combo Nutella, sea salt, cinnamon etc). The candied bacon was the crowd favorite followed by the dirty wu as they both had more going for them other than the boring donut underneath. The batter had a nice subtle spiciness to it, and they were cooked very well being crispy on the outside and softer and cakey on the inside, but this is barely just a level up from your mini donuts and your local county fair; nothing revolutionary or to write home about in the world of craft donuts.

I think they purposely are making the food terrible so that people don't stay and eat as long. The sushi and sashimi quality is pretty bad all the fish tastes extremely fishy, but hey, I guess its AYCE so can't complain. The fried dishes are mediocre, either everything is generic frozen food or it's so heavily battered you can't even tell you're eating protein. The BBQ (which was what I was most excited for) failed me the most. The meat wasn't even put in a marinade so it was basically putting raw unflavored meat on a stove. I was so sad, even a sweet soy marinade would've been nice, but no.  Service was rushed and they missed a few items we ordered although I'm not too bummed because I probably wouldn't have liked the food anyways.

So first thing's first, I'm weird and generally judge a restaurant by its cleanliness - the eating area, kitchen, and restroom. This place is well maintained and organized, even the restroom. We decided to get Bun Bo Hue, which is the Spicy Beef and Pork Lemongrass Soup on the menu, and the Pho With Us Special. Both dishes were really good, and dare I say the best I've tried in Austin, TX - comparable to Houston's noodle scene. We ordered another set to go and can't wait to eat it again tonight. On the drinks side, I also ordered the Vietnamese Iced Coffee which was prepared in a set of 9 (you can see this). This is actually a good thing because if you add the hot coffee over ice, the ice will melt too soon. Instead, the ice was added to dripped coffee that had time to settle. Overall, coffee was as good as any other place and was made via the traditional drip filter as oppose to powder (yuck).I'm glad we found this place and look forward to making our monthly trips down here when we're craving pho."},{"name":"Cruzteca Mexican Kitchen","address":"5207 Brodie Ln, Ste 125","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is the best Mexican food in Austin.

I eat pho at least once a week, and this is the place to go, I never go to other pho places anymore! Buckeye pho is good too, but their prices are too high and they don't give you enough meat or noodles. Huong is very generous with their portions of noodles and MEAT!! I love #23, which has rare steak, beef brisket, and tendons. I ask for the rare stake on the side uncooked, and like to put some hoisin sauce, siracha sauce, and lime juice on it. Then I put the thinly sliced meat into the soup, which cooks it right away!! This way, the meat is never overcooked and is tender!I also get here spicy beef noodle soup. The flavor of this broth is a little different, it has lemongrass in it. Anything with lemongrass in it makes it taste better. The noodle is the vermicelli rice noodle. This has beef brisket, pork blood chunks, pork cake, and pig feet. I don't eat the pig feet so I ask them to hold it. I have also gotten here their chicken based soup noodles!! It's sooo good!!! I think sometimes I prefer the chicken soup over the beef pho broth!! The chicken soup noodles come with dried garlic and onion flakes in there which makes is tastes 100x better!Their vermicelli noodle salads with eggrolls, shriimp skewers, grilled pork is also good. It's a lighter meal. It doesn't have soup, although u can get a side of soup if you ask with this dish. It comes with a side of sweet fish sauce that you pour into the salad!! very refreshing during summer!Their grilled chicken rice dish and their grilled pork chop dish are also sooo good I would recommend them! Their sandwiches are also very good! The best thing there is probably their fried chicken wing appetizer!!! The wings are flavored to perfection with some type of slight sweet soy and lemon grass!!

What do you people who rated this place so well see in this place? Admittedly, we came here at 7:30 on a Tuesday night in a celebratory sort of mood. It was bustling but a line was not coming out the door. Most of the people eating here seemed like families or college aged kids. Ok we thought...lets try something new. My boyfriend had done quite of a few things to help me out that day and I felt grateful and wanted to take him to out to dinner. It was a \\"something new\\" night and we were between Sonora Dog and this place. Sonora Dog would have wiped this place away...and that's saying something because it's a hot dog joint. Service is fast. We were seated in 2 secs. Waitress came out, Jeannie I think was her name. She was very short and curt and asked what we wanted to drink. Drink orders in. Once they came out, she clarified that all they had was King Crab and crawfish under their \\"boiled\\" section. Bummer. We were wanting shrimp...not feeling that the work to benefit ratio was high on the crawfish we saw walking in, I ordered the crab and he ordered the jambalaya. I mentioned to the girl that I wanted to get an order of bread too. She didn't ask if we had been there before (we hadn't) and we didn't know the minutiae for ordering. But great...you can point out for me that you either have crawfish or crab. For 2 lbs of crawfish, you get a potato, blah, blah....But if you're ordering king crab...I figured...well...it's king crab. The most expensive thing on the menu. You know, when you go to steak joints, they typically will serve two sides with it. It's hard to find a steakhouse actually that will just give you the meat. By. ITSELF. Smith and Wollensky come to mind...but hey, aged beef is no joke and I get why you only get the steak by itself.This place...you have to ask for all the extras unless you order 2 lbs. So 2 lbs of crab would have come out to 44 dollars. That's how much I would have had to pay to get a potato. An ear of corn...part ear. I bet it was formerly frozen. Maybe a mushroom...you get my drift. Unless I asked for each of these components separately.So food comes out in 15 minutes. His jambalaya has overcooked rice. This tells me several things. Their food is old. They are cooking it and reheating it because the rice is broken down and is mostly rice mash. Because they keep mixing it to warm it up. They are a cajun themed place who doesn't know how to cook rice. They are also predominantly staffed by Asian people as well...who eat this...and are OKAY with it?! They even charge for a scoop (emphasis on 1 scoop) of rice!!!! My boyfriend mentioned that I was being pretty critical about the rice....and you're damn right I am. I didn't just pay $8.95 for me to \\"treat you to dinner\\" to some smutty rice that tasted awful, was overcooked, and barely had any shrimp or sausage in it. This is slop. This is not ok. Crab was ok. Overcooked. Methinks it either wasn't thawed properly prior to firing or it was just overcooked. For shame. The seasonings were good and it had garlicky flavor...which I enjoyed. A tad salty. That's why they're getting 2 stars. And not 1.Did I mention that it took 20 minutes later after we got our food before we were asked if everything was ok?! My boyfriend's drink was empty. I told her I had asked for bread but to never mind since I was almost finished with the meal. She had this glib smug response that she went ahead to the back and had them \\"cancel\\" it. It's bread. It gets put on the toaster. You tell me somewhere back there you can boil water and get me an order in 15 minutes for king crab but then tell me you have to have them cancel toasting my bread? Let me bet something. You don't bake the bread in house. Not to mention the horrible shame I felt for having opted to go to this place to \\"treat\\" my boyfriend. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed. My fault. I think we were mistaken because we had had a wonderful experience with seafood at Garbo's previously in this Well's Branch area because ordinarily....I would be reluctant to go to a place in the 'burbs for seafood. Garbo's was excellent and I'll go back any chance I get. The caliber there is unparalleled.

Once you get inside, the tables are SUPER CLOSE TOGETHER.  Ok...this isn't Manhattan...a few more inches would be nice.  It was almost impossible to not bump into someone, and in general sitting that close to other patrons is not relaxing, or kid friendly for that matter!  Haha. Not that other patrons want to sit that close to your kid, either.  They do have a tiny kid area for play but it was far away from where I was seated and I did not think the adults seated beside it would care for a kid playing there.  Idea for the servers: save that table for someone with kids!  I would have liked to sit there!Their coffee and breakfast were delicious, and made up for the lack-of-kid-friendly-atmosphere.

The fact that despite being so crisp and huge, they don't completely fall apart after you bit them is an underrated, but appreciated quality. I've tried cannoli at other local bakeries, at other cities, and even in Italy. What can I say, I like Mike's. My advice: don't deviate too much from the classic. Dip it in chocolate, chocolate chips, pistachios, hazel nuts, etc. The classic shell is better than the Florentine or chocolate shells, the classic filling is the best.

First of all, the food is amazing.  IF you are feeling indulgent and you are a Russian Jew, try the caviar sandwich.  It is perfection - the potato bread bun gels so well with the caviar and makes that tiny bite fully worth it.  It's a bit pricey but it's good ish.  If you are feeling spicy, try the chick pea stew.  Goddang it's orgasmic.  For a lighter and refreshing bite, try the cucumber feta salad.  If you want to be satiated and spend about $20 on food, tops, try the following: Ramen and the cheeseburger.  For a price of a tapa, these things will definitely fill you up and you won't want anything else.  Ramen is a generous size bowl of gorgeousness and flavor.  The cheeseburger is a play on a kid's fave, McD's.  The fluffy but flat bun, the skinny patty recall a simpler era of Brookline high school, when my friend Bella and I used to split a happy meal that had two cheeseburgers at a Brookline McDs (not there anymore).  The foie gras and a complex flavor of the mixed beef patty make it fit for a fancy adult who may not be ready to fully adult (sorry, that word seemed to fit).  The chips add a satisfying crunch.

During a recent surprise birthday trip to Columbus, my honey, our son, and I hit up North Market for lunch/shopping. First, the bad part (and this was the ONLY bad part, and it has nothing to do with the market). There was a train expo at the convention center and it had snowed, so traffic getting to the market was horrendous. We worried a little about parking, and the sign said full for the market, but we got in and were able to find several spots. The parking lot across the street handled all the convention parking. Now that we know the area a little better, we could have gone around the front of the market and to the other lot entrance. So it ended up being no biggie and was worth the wait once we got inside. I don't know what I was thinking, since the reviews here are awesome, but I thought it would be dead inside. Especially since it is January and it had snowed, but boy was I wrong! The hustle and bustle was going strong. (After reading other reviews about strollers getting the stink eye, we left ours at home and just held our kiddo's hand. I don't know which was worse, being blocked by a large stroller or a slow-walking toddler, but I think an umbrella stroller would have been a good idea. The large travel systems are way too big and block off an insane amount of walking space, so if you are using a stroller, I recommend the umbrella.) Once inside, we just stood in the doorway (yeah, we're those people) and took in what we saw. Our first stop was the Barrel and Bottle. It was awesome, and the boy enjoyed the samples they had for $1 each. Then we walked around and checked out all the stations. Everything looked so good! We wanted it all, so we'll definitely be back. We settled on Vietnamese pho bo and a sampler plate with naan from the Indian stand. Both were fantastic. They'll be getting their own more in-depth reviews later. Even though the market was busy there were plenty of tables available upstairs, and high chairs (needed, since we didn't have a stroller and the kiddo is too big for a sling). A man was near to clean off the tables as soon as someone left and organize the chairs. There were plenty of trash cans and recycling bins, as well. The people at each shop we visited were extremely nice, despite the volume rushing in and out of their areas. They were quick to say hi and ask if we needed any help. Our visit to North Market made us want to open a market of our own in our town, and we will definitely make the trek back to Columbus just to get some yummy food."},{"name":"Kick Butt Coffee","address":"5775 Airport Blvd, Ste 725","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yesterday was another great experience at KickButt Coffee (at the Triangle).

We had great service by two waiters.  The main server was a friendly woman who has a funny habit of putting her arms around your shoulder while talking to you and the other guy was our Ninja waiter.  He would just silently emerge during the meal and refill our glasses and take care of us.  My only nit is total agreement with Laura N's review about the little miscellaneous charges.  The waitress asked if I wanted avocado with my scramble and I said sure, not realizing this would be charged separately.

Although we thought the flavors could have been bolder, overall the atmosphere was wonderful, the server was AMAZING and the food was delicious. That night, we noticed we had been charged twice. We thought (at first) it was just an additional hold on the credit card - TONS of bars do this downtown, so we weren't worried. But days passed... a week passed. The charge was still there. My husband then decided to call and ask a manager to go through the receipts collected the night we visited. They found the additional charge. It was a forged receipt - signature, tip, everything. Our bill was around $80 said and done (1 drink each, an appetizer and two entrees). The additional bill was for $100. I have a full time job, my husband has a full time job. $100 isn't make-or-break for us but COMEON, $100 is a lot of money. It's unacceptable. There are two scenarios (I want to believe the first but I don't): The first option is the innocent option - The waiter, G_____o, simply mixed up our bill with another table and accidentally used our card for their charges. The patron who signed the bill, also has a signature that MIRRORS my husband's. Unlikely but still, slightly possible. The second option is unfortunate - The waiter, G_____o, charged our card twice. He KNEW that he charged our card twice. \\nHe KNEW that he tipped himself.\\nHe KNEW that he forged my husband's signature.\\nHe smiled when handing us our bill(s),\\nHe handed us customer comment cards (which we responded with \\"You're awesome!\\" and, \\"Thank you!\\") I'm not sure why anyone would do Option 2, since they would SURELY be caught - like waiving a little white flag, \\"Please fire me!

I really appreciate the markings on the menu of what is gluten free and/or vegan, due to my allergies (not many restaurants that are not a chain do that nowadays). I decided to go with the Bollywood wings with mild spice, and they were wonderful! Not overly sauced, cooked just right, with enough flavor, and a little crisp. I also went with the medium spice chicken tikka masala. It was super good, although I would've went with the mild instead. Good portions; enough for two people to share.

I will give it a 3 for now and come back and review later. The knock on this place isn't the food, it's the service. This place is severely understaffed. They had one waitress manning about 20 different tables in both the indoor and outdoor setting. I felt bad bc she was trying as hard as she could but the lack of checking in and refreshing our drinks, asking for napkins, silverware etc are all part of the hospitality experience. So for those reasons I need to knock it down a few stars. The food on the other hand was really good. We came here for lunch and were lucky enough to get a spot outside in the nice day. We began our order with some hummus. The hummus was really good. It was creamy and had a nice little pool of olive oil in the center. The pitas that came with it were really yummy as well. For my lunch I had the roast turkey panini. Beware the only draw back is that it's massive! It's a huge panini. And that's not even a bad problem bc it was so tasty and I was able to get two meals out of it! The bread came out nice and crispy out of the press with the cheese nicely melted. This place is great for lunch with the specials, you get good quality food for not too much money, def check it out."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place. It's so fresh and flavorful! I came here on a rainy day in Columbus for lunch and saw the line coming out of the restaurant, but it went really fast. Standing in line I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to order. I ordered the white meat breast, Hot, which i thought was very spicy, but delicious! My friend got the dark meat and it was very tasty as well. Check-in with Yelp gave me a free banana-pudding, which was actually very good, even though it was ultra-sweet. Their sweet-tea was incredibly sweet and I could feel the sugar coating my teeth so I had to wash it down with water. The slaw and the tortillas that come with the chicken were awesome compliments to the chicken. i just wish they gave more of the slaw because it's nice to cool your mouth off with after eating the hot chicken. Don't waste your money on the waffles, because they are sugary and some kind of microwave waffles, very cheap, and very spongy. The dining area is very spacious and you sit at picnic tables to eat, which is fitting for a place like this.Overall: Simple, flavorful, and sweet encompasses what this place is about. I would definitely come back to eat this delicious chicken, but I may get MILD because they weren't kidding around about the HOT."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I like this place a lot.

No one comes in here to be wowed by the interior design or trendy address. We're here for the delicious fried food, friendly service, and cheap drinks!Chicken wings: fried whole (with all 3 segments), juicy inside, crispy & perfectly rendered on the skin-side, and tossed with some kind of salty magic dust. You can add the spicy wing sauce, but these wings are excellent just as they're served.Fried shrimp: lightly battered with tails still on, these plump & very clean shrimp are cooked just enough to have that good snap to them. Ask for cocktail sauce if you like.Fried catfish: Ahhhhh, I could eat about 5 pounds of this tender, perfectly cleaned filets of farm-raised catfish. If you are from SETX or Louisiana, you are going to feel like you've found a portal back home with a bite of this fish. They'll bring you some tartar sauce if you want, but you won't need it.Waffle: custardy & sweet, typically made with buttermilk, a bit heavy but still quite enjoyable, especially after adding the table furnished bottle of syrup. They sometimes also have a red velvet waffle version, too!Collard greens: smokey, salty, porky goodness just like Mama used to make. Watch out for hidden bones (from the salt pork).I've not yet gotten around to trying the oxtails and pork chops, but judging from the rest, I'd expect they're good!Your best bet to sample it all is to have everyone at the table order a different combo plate variation and share. Or, just go hog wild and get yourself the 2 wings, 2 fish, 2 shrimp, mac, & greens $18 with an added waffle for $4.Now if you're on some sort of low salt or another restricted diet, this place is probably not going to be the best spot for your next meal. But if you are looking to indulge in some good ol' homestyle Southern soul food,  Rolling Rooster will leave you more than satisfied.Oh, and about those cheap drinks... They have a full bar and there are different specials throughout the week (like a recent Monday Madness special with $3 cocktails).

The awesome thing about HCT that makes me love them more is their dedication to offer those who have experienced barriers to employment a job (i.e. homelessness, previous incarceration, and etc). We need more businesses in our city that are willing to give back and its great to see HTC taking the lead.Anyways, back to the food. If you are going to HCT for the first time and want to full experience, order your favorite cut of meat + the HOT seasoning. The seasoning is spicy. However, it is NOT the type of spice that burns your mouth and leaves you regretting your choice. It's spicy enough that you feel the heat in your mouth and you want to take another bite. If it is a little too spicey, fear not! The mac n cheese comes in clutch to cool down the spice with its cheesy, buttery goodness. If you come to HCT on the weekend, ask for the waffles and thank me later! The waffles are the perfect match for the hot chicken with a drizzle of hot maple syrup on top. The waffles are thin, little crispy vehicles of carbs to complete your HTC breakfast. :)Columbus is deficient is chicken joints.

My friend lives in the North End, and I've heard recommendations from plenty of people about this place.The process of ordering can be a bit crazy. Generally, you walk into the shop and there are people all over. The rule is that, when you're ready to order, just get up to any woman at the counter with the string in front of her. There aren't really lines...you just need to get through the people and up to the counter. I've had the pistachio cannoli and the florentine cannoli. Both were delicious. I'd love to get back to the shop and try more of the delicious desserts (red velvet cake, anyone?), but it's all a bit rushed and the counters are pretty crowded. It's not like you can wander a bit and inspect all the different options. I guess you could... but you'd have to time it just right in order to avoid the crowds.If I remember correctly, each cannoli is $3.50. Perhaps a bit overpriced, but they're pretty large.

This is a place I have raved about for years and likely directed a pretty large amount of traffic to, going so far as claiming they had the best grilled cheese in the city. They don't anymore. The first time I had an issue here I assumed it was a fluke, but third times a charm and I am now at a point where I doubt I'll be coming back. When I first ordered their sandwiches they were rich, large, full of ingredients so much so they melted all over the plate and needed a handful of napkins to each. They were amazing. Now I receive a pancake squished panini missing two of the ingredients listed on the menu (I am not joking when I say the entire Melted Morrison was less than half an inch thick WITH ADDED TOMATO I REQUESTED and flatter than most pancakes). When I received this is was missing the cream-cheese spread or if it was included it was in such small amounts I could not tell it was there. I also received no pepper jack, so basically what I received was a squished to a pancake $9 cheddar grilled panini. To top it off I dragged my partner there because I'd told him how great it was, he ordered the same and while his had pepper jack, same, smashed to pancake and no cream-cheese spread. On top of that he ordered his grilled cheese and an appetizer side of macaroni salad which he also paid for as an appetizer. They gave him his grilled cheese to go, got home, and instead of the normal chips he should of received they shoved in a half cup round container of macaroni salad. So not only did he pay full price for a $9 squished to a pancake grilled cheese but he was shorted his included side and charged for an appetizer passed off as his side in a half cup bowl. He'd never bee here, I wanted to show him my favorite things, but this place is now crossed off that list and that makes me sad since they are a block away, I used to be a regular customer, and I have recommended them to NUMEROUS people over the years. Guys, get your shit together, hire a new chef and take note because this is not what I paid for, not what he paid for, and there are many other great options opening up all around you. -----------My Original Review----------- A cozy dive joint, minus the divey! I first went here a couple years ago and remember trying their AMAZING grilled cheese (The Melted Morrison).  So lately was getting a craving for it again and decided to go back.  It was just as good as I remember.  The atmosphere is very casual and comfy without being dank or dirty.  Great for a friendly catchup or date.

There were only 2 other tables dining. We started off with empanadas, which were filled with chicken and raisin.

And we never, ever had to ask for more water as someone always anticipated the need.Portions were small-ish, but that was fine as we were stuffed by the end. Tuna sashimi was super tasty. Bro ordered the pork belly - omg, fatty, tender deliciousness and everything Diary of a Foodie promised and more - and t'was the best. I got the skate and it was flaky and light and the spice crust was purrrfect. I've never really been a fan of quinoa, so that was only so so; Bro kept calling it \\"birdseed\\" and nearly had to be restrained from pecking my plate. Desserts were alright - strawberry terrine was light, ice cream cookie sandwich was heavy.Coup de maitre was the $33.08 gift certificate as a 'thank you' for trying out Great Bay during restaurant week.

As much as I wanted to like Lomo Saltado, the meat was a bit disappointing and small in portion compared to the price. Also tried the Jalea - where I did love the corn and lime marinated onion salad, which reminded me of the ceviche flavors from Lima. Lastly, the pisco sour was just okay.

After a few years of living here, Mike's has consistently proven why there's so much to talk and rave about. If I ever dine in the North End, I never order cannolis at the restaurants I dine in because I know that I'll be making a stop at Mike's before heading back to my apartment with half a dozen in hand and passing out from a food coma.While there is much debate and loyal fan bases revolving around Mike's vs. Modern, just know that both of these places have followings for a reason. I won't take a particular side since they both serve quality products and the cannolis are out of this world. Going back to Mike's - don't be intimated by the long lines because their service is really fast. Just keep in mind that it's cash only and the likelihood of getting a table indoors is highly unlikely. If you ever have to enjoy your cannolis outside, take a walk down to the Paul Revere Statue or go back to the front of Hanover street. Whatever you do, just don't congest the entrance. Why?

My first Vietnamese meal is welcome with someone who visits frequently. Why I don't see his review here is a mystery.\\nMy first impression was the water brought to the table. The taste was a bit off. All I could see was that all the cooking and washing was being done in this water. The egg rolls came out right away. 2 egg rolls come in an order. The slice of pork was only in the middle 2 bites. The shrimp was whole and large. It was easy to see both pieces. Again, the shrimp did not reach out to every bite. \\nMy Vietnamese salad was my first. It has a base of starchy noodles, that reminded me of cooked bean sprouts.  I must say that when it first arrived, I could see that the pork looked dry, and undercooked. It was. There was a large quantity of pork. I quickly chopped it up into manageable bites to spread out into each bite of salad. Now comes the Fish sauce. I've probably had a great deal of food prepared with fish sauce and never known it. I was a bit skeptical of sauce named for fish. John told me that separately it's OK, but added to the salad, is a fantastic marriage. I did enjoy the choice in such a different take on salad.When comparing notes on our meal, John admitted that this was not their best showing. It was as if their B team was working. I will return to give them another tasting. At least 2 more times to sample some delicious food that passed by my table. The service was just fine.

After visiting both (several times) during our vacation to Boston, I took the on the much talked about challange of who may be the best of the best of Boston... Mike's or Modern? We went to Mike's first and tried the much recommended cannoli. It was another hard decision just to figure out which flavor to try, so we tried many. Amaretto, Expresso, Florentine, Caramel Pecan, Peanut Butter, etc. I have to say these were the most amazing cannoli EVER! All the flavors were tasty, but my winner was the Caramel Pecan and my hubby's favorite was the Expresso. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the 18 options. The other pastries and cookies we tried were also very tasty, but the cannoli was the stand up winner here.Modern Pastry on the other hand, had some of the best cookies and cakes we tried on the trip. Everything in their display case is tempting as you wait for your turn in line to order. We tried the Black & White cookies which were soft and delicious. The cannoli and Lobster tails are filled when ordered. This means the shells remain light and crispy which is key reason for this being favored by many. I still prefer Mike's. However, Modern Pastry takes the cake on the cookies. Hands down, the best Rainbow cookies EVER! OMG! Thanks for making me crave these little bites of heaven! Seriously, one of the best little cookie cakes I have ever put in my mouth. They are PERFECT. So, It has been determined that perfection has been found in the North End of Boston.

Next we got Shrimp & Grits that they served with a delicious white wine.  It was somewhere between a Rielsing and a Pinot Grigio.  Not too sweet and great with the shrimp. The next course was an Endive Salad that they served with a sparkling Robert Mondavi.  The salad had sweet squash which was complimented with the wine.The third course was the Pan-seared Red Fish with grapes and almonds.  They paired it with a really fresh and fruity red wine.  It was an amazing combination.The fourth course was a NY strip and Yukon potatoes.  We had a choice of a Cabernet or a Petite Syrah.  I went with the Syrah and my boyfriend had the Cab.  Both were really delicious.The fifth course was a fig bread pudding.  Instead of getting two of those, we asked for one bread pudding and one blackberry cobbler.

Come for the beer, stay for...well, more beer. Then get some food.The doorman was surly, in that fun if you're from Boston kind of way. People had apparently given him lip about having to show two forms of ID because they were out of state. I later saw them tied to a tree, naked, and covered in cheese. Not really. We saw a booth open up but decided to roll the dice and belly up to the bar. We asked for food and beer menus and were on our way. Being a bartender myself, I get that there's a little \\"warm up\\" period sometimes for new customers. I have to say, the bartender we had was at first a bit put out that we were the ones who decided to take the empty stools. We sat between what seemed to be a \\"regular\\" crowd and most of the attention was paid to them. It's fine. I usually don't come for the pleasantries even if I'm by myself but until we showed that we were there to both eat and drink, we hadn't made the priority face time list.  The beer selection is fantastic. Lots of great bottled (and canned!) beers to take a gander at. Word to the wise, don't just get a higher booze content beer just because it has a higher booze content. Take your time with the menu and go for what you like or at least what you think you might like. Grab a glass of water when you order too. As the night wore on it was promptly filled without asking. A huge bartender scoring point for me.The food was good. Buffalo tenders (kind of a staple when I go to a new pub) were decent. Nothing to write home about. The hot dog was amazing. Fries cooked perfectly and this was no dinky store bought Market Basket brand dog. Stout and juicy. As the beer flowed like wine we decided to try the White Trash Cheese Dip. It was okay. The chips it was served with...umm, I mean the salt triangles it was served with were a bit to be desired. My partner in crime loved it. Scratch that, the beer inside my partner in crime loved it. My point? The food is decent at best but if you travel through the beer menu for more than a couple, or you're a lightweight, you're mouth thinks you're eating at the Ritz. Decent pub food, great with the beer. The music that was on while we were there was good. Punkish, indie post rockin' stuff...like Interpol...big points scored there. The open air seating looks nice and adds a nice breezy air to the place even if you're not seated right next to the window. For a Saturday night in the summer it was busy but not general admission concert busy. We never had anyone standing behind our seats at the bar singing Neil Diamond or screaming \\"I swear to god I know yous guys from somewhere\\". Chill crowd. Upon leaving they even gave us directions to another bar (gasp!) without verbally abusing us first. Overall a success. A beer drinker's dream, and a food lover's beer drinking dream. I'm not sure I even understand that but it works.Oh, as disturbing as this may sound, try the Old Chub in a can."},{"name":"North By Northwest Restaurant & Brewery - Stonelake","address":"10010 Capital Of Tx Hwy N","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I started frequenting NXNW on a regular basis and were some of the first customers when they opened back in '99. Because of convenience as much as out of routine, we were regulars throughout the years, going for HH and for weekend lunch or dinner, up until later in 2009 when we'd had enough and decided to stop going there entirely. If you look at Stu R.'s review, he pretty much sums it up, spot on, in two short paragraphs.Sure, they have a great building and nice environment (\\"Watch your step!\\"), but that's about all they have going for them. Everything else IMHO seems to be working against them.NXNW brews have never been even 1/4 as good as other local breweries (remember Waterloo Brewing Company on 4th @ Guadalupe? Or The Bitter End on 4th @ Colorado? They knew how to do microbrews right! They are sorely missed!). They have a couple of brews that I would drink and some of their seasonal brews would work out, but the brews have always been sub-par and as others have said, a bit watery tasting. Definitely NOT prize winning brews or good examples of the styles they are trying to recreate. Over the years they've increased the prices of their beer, too. HH Pints used to be $1.25, now they are $2.50. And the regular pint price is $5. Either way, unfortunately the beer is not good enough to justify either HH or regular price. And I LOVE a good beer, so this has always been a disappoint for me with NXNW. From day one their menu has contained expensive and mostly bland foods. And over the years, they menu has changed very, very little. The best value for your money and for a successful meal has always been their Burger, which they always have been good about allowing you to swap out sides (salad, mashers or scalloped potatoes instead of fries? No problem!) . There are some sandwiches and pizzas to choose from as well (some only at lunch and not at HH, so at HH it's either Burgers or Pizza - ugg). But consistency is a huge problem. I don't know how many burgers I've had that were served to me brown on the outside but literally uncooked inside, or overcooked, over seasoned, under seasoned or containing flavors that don't belong in a burger at all. They used to season their fries with garlic, but at some point in the last few years they changed to some other seasoning that doesn't contain the fresh sticky garlic, and their fries have only been average or less than average since then - great, I just lost a reason to order their fries. The calamari is very poorly executed time and time again; greasy and not tasty. Their shrimp is almost always so rubbery you gag trying to eat it and give up (cocktail shrimp and shrimp in the pasta - either way). Undercooked pork on many occasions. Undercooked and overcooked salmon. Wilted greens in salads. Almost everything on their menu is bland and overpriced. Half the time the manager asked if everything was okay (before he stopped asking), and when I had a complaint, many times he would just laugh and walk away as if I wasn't serious, getting out of dealing with the issue entirely (and we were regulars that he knew, unacceptable regardless, however). The biggest problem with eating here is that no matter what I eat (and this happens to my wife, too), and regardless if we drink their brews or not, we seem to *always* get side effects from eating here: stomach issues and headaches. I believe they use some seasoning that is causing the problem, because it happens no matter what we order. I suspect they are using MSG in their house seasoning. Because of the inconsistency, lack of menu options, and side effects from their food, I won't give them my business again.I've always thought that NXNW had so much potential to become an Austin institution by producing high-quality brews and delicious reasonably priced brew pub food, but unfortunately, they've changed very little about their operation and offerings since they opened 11 years ago - boring, bland, inconsistent service and food execution, overpriced food and generally unsatisfying in every regard. The managers know me well and used to ask how everything was, this even stopped in the last couple of years - they just don't seem to care if people are satisfied or not, same with the wait staff. The valet parking should be removed entirely and HH should be restaurant-wide and not just the bar area. When you add all of this up, it's easy to see why we stopped giving these guys our hard earned money: no value and no satisfaction, moved on.NXNW's management and owner are obviously very much out of touch with the realities of what makes a fantastic brew pub. They do have a great building and a good location as far as NW Austin goes. Austin needs a few really good brew pubs again and I would be so very pleased to see NXNW bought out by a successful brew pub visionary, allowing them to start over (new name, new management/staff, new brewmaster), doing it right this time! One can always hope... but I'm done with NXNW."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I love the flavors at Hawkers, not to mention the buzzing atmosphere and the eclectic crowd always found there.

The tomatoes came straight out of a can. It was a VERY disapointing dinner. I like spicy food. But it takes skill to use spices so it does not overpower the rest of the flavours.

The fries never seem to be that good. They're either cooked in oil that's too old, or there's some seasoning on them I don't like.

That's right, ACROSS the STREET from a BREWPUB. I think the subjectivity of my intense desire to love Deschutes and have it become my new regular pub is cancelled out by the incredibly high expectations I developed while daily following the pub's construction.Thankfully, Deschutes did not disappoint on my first of many planned visits. The restaurant is open, light, and seems enormous. I wondered for months how in the hell that nasty old auto repair garage was going to be a shiny new brewpub, and the crew responsible did a fantastic job. The building still feels old and industrial, but the whole place has been transformed into an Oregon-y mountain lodge of a brewpub. From the green plaid carpet to the intricately carved wildlife, the whole place just gives off a warm, inviting, sit-and-drink-awhile vibe. Perfect.Service was great- really attentive, very friendly and thoughtful, without being overbearing in the slightest. It's a small touch, but I loved that when the boyfriend and I ordered clams and a pizza to share for dinner, our server asked if we would like them to come out separately or together. Like I said, thoughtful. That's very appreciated. The food was delicious, too- the goat cheese and pear pizza was on a housemade crust that was delicious and unique, and the clams were perfectly sized for an appetizer and tasty. I actually didn't have any beer (stupid hangover) but I am familiar with Deschutes's brews and can't wait to go back in better shape sometime soon. The one detractor from the evening was that the bar was too crowded to sit in, and the hosting staff seemed completely clueless. As in stare at you and ask, \\"oh, did you want a table?\\" Seriously? Oh well. If one part of a restaurant is going to be off, I suppose the hosts are the one I'd pick. Prices are a little higher than you would pay on average for a burger (around $10 or so) but seem to be in line with Rogue and Henry's, the nearest competitors in the brewpub department. And the atmosphere is way less douchebaggy than the latter. I am pleased as punch to have Deschutes next door, and will write a bit of an update after a few more visits to see how consistency works out as things go along in this relationship between me and my new brewpub."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Little plates, big taste.I don't know where this place has been hiding but it's now on the regular rotation for eating out.

Staff was friendly and patient while we pondered the expansive menu and always had a recommendation ready for us if we needed it.  The roti canai changed my life. Apparently the curry this is served with is so popular they now sell it by the quart.  It is a definite must. Also had mussels which were superb. We also ordered a noodle dish and shrimp skewers. The shrimp was a little overcooked and the noodles were a little greasy so keep this in mind when ordering.  Although this is a tapas place, the portions are pretty generously sized for tapas.  They also have an extensive beer menu. This is definitely the type of place where you can just chill and eat, and eat, and eat , then drink and drink and drink. The waiters aren't rushed to get you out, and since it's tapas you can linger on dish after dish for hours on end."},{"name":"Soul Vegetarian No  2","address":"652 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I found Soul Veg.

We made reservation earlier the morning of the actual day and it was fully booked. However they managed to get us a table and arranged for us. We ordered food in advance over the phone to avoid shocking bills since it was a treat to close friends and made special arrangements for our desserts.It is a beautiful restaurant with great lightings and valet parking. Unfortunately, it was rainy when I was there and couldn't enjoy the view. The ambience of the restaurant is quite cozy, the lights are dim, and service is great. The waitress that was in charge of our table mend to us at all times to check if we need any assistance. The plates were changed when every meal was served just like any other fine dining restaurant. First we start off with ordering beverages, I ordered sparkling water, however, one of the servers actually refilled my sparkling water with tap water, making my drink taste really awful. I've ordered Jumbo lump crab cake for appertizers. The crab cake is juicy, but what I disliked was there were shells in it which was a NO NO, making it hard to enjoy over a fine dining especially when I was all dressed up. For the taste, I would give it a 7/10 but because of the shells making it unpleasant to spit them out quite a few times, I give it a 6/10.As for the entrée, I ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon. The portion of the entrée is quite filling, the salmon is a little over cooked and dry. Needs more sauce and taste to it since it was dry and bland. I give the rating of 5/10.For dessert, I ordered Chocolate Grotto and their signature Popcorn ice cream. The portion for dessert is too much for me. The Chocolate Grotto is extremely sweet, not recommended for non sweet tooth. As for the ice cream popcorn, I would highly recommend it, it is by far one of the best ice cream I ever tasted. The popcorns given were generously enough. The desserts are enough for two person to share a dish. Chocolate Grotto, I would give it a 3/10 and Popcorn ice cream a 8/10.Overall for price wise, it is quite expensive because the entrée I had was not satisfied. I would visit again to try other dishes but not Salmon and Chocolate Grotto again.

Our waitress was great and very helpful with recommendations and cautioning us about ordering too much food.  Thank goodness I cancelled the side of risotto b/c we were thoroughly food coma'd before we could even finish the rest.  Appetizers came in the form of Calamari and The Crimson Wedge.

Oh and the portions for both were very, very generous - always a plus.Next up was the Texas Brisket Sandwich.  Tender meat encased in an airy bun and smothered in sweet and tangy BBQ sauce.  Good stuff.  The main course was the special for the night - lobster fra diavolo with linguini that ended up being a pesto-based dish per the chef's whim when we found out that they had run out of ingredients for the fra diavolo.

The food was competent, but unispired.  The service was a little slow and the waitress overhyped the food a little.  Decor is aging, but decent.  All the first hand reports I've heard convey the same thing: nothing awful, nothing special.  It's surprising it has lasted so long when there are so many more interesting places to go to, many for less money.For Korean in Cambridge, Seoul Food (a cosy little Mom and Pop halfway to Harvard Square from Kaya) and Koreana (between Inman and Central Square) are much better choices.

It was enough food for us which was great and the BBQ meats were delicious. There were 4 side dishes with lettuce wrap for the BBQ. It was nice that you can refill the side dishes once but I found it a little problematic when it came to the lettuce wraps. I enjoy eating my Korean BBQ meats in a lettuce wrap, but there were only 1 refill for the entire table. After everyone got 1 leaf (by the way they sliced the leaf in half, so really it was more like 3 lettuce leaves per basket/plate/refill) we were out of lettuce and had to get our refill.  This was slightly ridiculous since we were a table of 5 with 5 different plates of BBQ meats. In any case, it was great food at a relatively reasonable price.

Nothing is more frustrating than trying to flag down an inattentive server for your check after sitting there waiting for what feels like an eternity. You order in the front and are given a card with a number on it. You can sit wherever in the place, which was also a plus.I ended up ordering the naan and the chicken vindaloo. The naan was your standard, run of the mill naan you would get at an Indian place. Nothing really special. The vindaloo was good! Very flavorful and they didn't skimp on the meat, which a lot of Asian places are guilty of unfortunately. The bell peppers and potatoes didn't taste bland, which was also a plus. Nothing is worse than eating bland vegetables in my opinion. The portions were decent for the price. This location is in the Domain, which is super convenient because you can go and walk off the calories from your meal.

To be honest, I think it looks more interesting in photos and was somewhat disappointed in person.  Since I'm a decent home cook, I often like to go to restaurants where I can order things that I either can't or won't make at home.  For me, while my meal was filling as I was nearly comatosed following lunch, the kaiseki meal didn't display much culinary depth to me.  The most interesting thing on the platter was the chawanmushi which had shrimp and fishcake in it and definitely presented umami.  Everything else on the plate was either raw or cooked with barely enough seasoning to it.  I can go buy my own sashimi and blanch seafood and put onto a platter with sesame seeds and mayo.  So, my take on the kasiseki lunch sets here is that you are paying for the variety and labor involved in putting together lots of different things onto a platter, not so much about flavor, which is more muted here.  Tempura was okay, but I didn't care for the type of udon served.  My husband wasn't impressed with his chicken teriyaki lunch set.  I understand this is a more traditional style Japanese restaurant and wonder if my expectations are colored by my frequenting Chinese owned Japanese restaurants where there is more flavor put into the food?  Service was slow, but the restaurant was fully sat.  I give Shiki 3 stars and would return to try other things on the menu like the Hokkai donburi lunch set.

The order contained plantain and vegetables as well with my beans and rice. It would be super awesome if they had brown rice and beans, just a recommendation. Also the patties were the best part. They were a little overpriced for me, being $2, but it's reasonable for such a yummy appetizer. I love how authentic it feels too, the music they played and all the servers had a super cool accent.

A lot of bang for the buck!I also had a cup of the chicken and leek soup and it was divine. I loved it. And their cup size is pretty big...The decor is really cute...there are a few tables and a bar downstairs and upstairs (where we sat) there were 2 sets of bathrooms (which had the best soft towels ever) and the seating is kind of like a U shape...with windows facing newbury street..The waiters were all dressed nice and neatly... very handsome waitstaff. I saw an old friend who was a waiter here and it was a nice treat to see a sarcastic gay man crack jokes while I'm waiting for the bathroomand  I saw a lot of managers in suits walking around making sure everyone was happy...also when they give you bread, they have someone in one of those suits come over and plop down an array of bread for each plate...it was cute...the total for both of us for the burgers, my soup and 2 rounds of iced teas was $42...not bad for really good food in a nice environment...I would def come back with my bf again..I could do without some of the snobby clientele though...LIGHTEN up, it's the frikkin' holidays, bitches!"},{"name":"Bistro Niko","address":"3344 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place was good, not great.

It was impossible to have a conversation without yelling. We celebrated when the band said they'd take a break, but then they just turned on music from their playlist which was just as loud. :(The service was also very, very slow.

Was 10 mins late to the wrong reservation time and we were greeted by the hosts last Wednesday evening on the 19th and when I say \\"greeted\\" I mean greeted in a very unfriendly, aggravated, unprofessional rude manner and neither of them paid attention to my explanation or complaint about their new reservation system being glitchy as they both stared at the computer screen as if our being 10 mins late messed up the entire flow of the restaurant which was not even half occupied.The only reason we returned to this establishment was to show my 9 year old the beautiful views of this restaurant for the end of summer. And what do you know, the management, service has not improved 4 years later. We were sat at a table with 4 chairs next to the window but since my 2 year old had fallen asleep I was holding him and when my husband asked to be seated at a booth the host who sat us came back to tell us there was a 30 min wait. To be clear, we were staring at about 6 empty booths next to us. As we felt mistreated from the moment we walked, the awkward vibe, and obviously neglectful customer service we decided to walk out. As we were walking out I counted a total of 12+ EMPTY booths. Lol. This is a joke of a restaurant and I'm starting to think maybe they're even racist? Considering the last visit we couldn't even get a birthday dessert and now this time we can't even get a booth...maybe they just kiss ass and cater to Americans.

The northern lights was basic and light as advertised, and the amber beer was flavorful and matched up well with the fried foods we had ordered.  The beers didn't blow me out of the water but they tasted fresh and had flavor, and its always nice to have beer brewed on site.The appetizer sampler platter was interesting.  The wings, first of all, were really good.  Juicy, well fried, and smothered in a sweet and spicy sticky sauce that really impressed me.  The stuffed mushrooms were undersalted but ok.  I had never had fried artichoke hearts before and really enjoyed them.  The fried calamari was bad- undercooked.  Overall the platter was good, but the one major problem was that it wasn't hot, merely warm, when it arrived.  If the plate had been hot it would have made a huge difference.We also ordered the skillet corn bread, which was fantastic.

The mere idea of waiting in such a long line to sit in a cafe and eat breakfast goes against everything I believe in. As it stands, the line is enough to make me hesitant to even order, just to avoid the awkward feeling of just walking in while everyone else stands outside and glares at me. So why endure the awkward feelings of jealous patrons and feeling like you're committing some grievous sin by cutting in line? Because the food is delicious, obvs. I usually go the Fit for a King (or Queen) breakfast plate, because it gives me the most options and then I can eat as many amazing things as possible. My favorites are the tri-berry pancakes and the banana and nutella-stuffed french toast, and the veggie sausage. Sometimes I'll change it up and get the Broadway Blues, because a blueberry muffin sliced in half and grilled, with so much butter it's practically dripping, is amazing, and the only thing that can drag me away from the pancake/french toast options. I still don't understand why people wait in line for this, though. I can't imagine standing outside for so long just to sit in and eat this food that I can bring home and enjoy just as well curled up on my couch. The interior seems chaotic, and I don't think I could relax the way the servers fly around the dining area. As it stands, it's hard enough just to pick up food while dodging around the servers like a drunk in a Wild West saloon being told to dance by a guy in a black hat.I would love to eat this food every single morning for the rest of my life, but I would be have a very large belly and a very small wallet.

The Shrunken Head is one place that really gets me, and I really get it. It caters to the eccentrics, and different crowds in Columbus be it rockabilly, goth, or alternative.     Located near the heart of Victorian village in an old brick building, which held historic store fronts, The Shrunken head looks dim, and dark from the outside looking in. Once you step in, you'll wonder \\"Am I in a haunted house?\\"-- Blood red walls, dim lighting, a stage in the corner with a rockabilly-esque mural to keep your attention--Paintings of Ozzy and Johnny Cash hang on the wall in salute to the greatest of the great that music has to offer. What kills the spooky tension for most is a bar with some of the nicest barkeep in town to keep you company, and keep you from running dry.    Drink prices are typical for any dive bar in the short north/campus area, but they offer drink specials all the time. $3-5\\n   \\n    One thing I will commend them on is their new pizza joint, \\"La Galleria\\" --be sure to check out my review on them! It's FABULOUS! There are plenty of tables with seating beside the bar, so grab a seat and a fresh pie. Not THAT hungry? They also offer pizza by the slice! (Somedays even for a $1 a slice!)   Every night has a theme here from Monday night movie madness, to Karaoke Tuesdays, and Honky Tonk Happy Hour on Fridays, so they always give you a good reason to come out, and not experience the same boring drabby bar experience.   While I can agree that not everyone will enjoy their experience here, and some may just not \\"get it\\", but this is one place that my friends and I constantly find ourselves coming back to all of the time for the friendliness of the staff and owners, and all around great times. This is definitely a place you'll see me around on a Saturday night free from all the Jersey Shore bimbos and rejects that litter the campus bars spewing vomit, and slurs all over each other.

None of us had been before so we didn't really know how the restaurant worked, and the staff wasn't really helpful. It was actually quite awkward trying to figure out what to do.BUT their vegetarian version of steak was the only 'fake' meat that has ever actually tasted like meat to me. I've tried various meat imitations and none compare. The mac'n cheese was also delicious. The rest of their food is very good, even my non-vegetarian coworkers enjoyed their meals here."},{"name":"Oudom Thai & Sushi","address":"100 S Eola Dr, Ste 105","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh, what a great new place! Combining sushi and Thai food in one place usually a bad idea, but they've actually pulled it off quite successfully! I've been twice now and both times were quite good. First Trip:\\nTheir Pad Thai is definitely not one of my favorites, it was too soupy and sweet.  My friend, who had never had Thai food before, liked it, so at least her Intro to Thai Food session was a success.The summer rolls were middle of the road too - not bad, but nothing spectacular either. Their peanut sauce was also a little too sweet for my taste; the granules of sugar hadn't fully dissolved and it was a little gritty.The Tom Kha Chicken soup was pretty good. Again, not the best I've ever had, but definitely not the worst. Middle of the road but good. My new-to-Thai-food friend liked this one also, which was surprising.We shared a few sushi rolls, which were all excellent. I wish I could remember which ones they were so I could order them again!Our server was nice. Attentive, nice, funny - she was good! She walked into the wrong part of a girl conversation and then each time she came back to the table, the jokes got even better. Something about growing and showing... lolOverall a solid experience leaving me to want to return.Second Trip: \\nI was excited that a UYE was planned for this place, since I enjoyed it the previous time. I opted to go just the sushi route this time and ordered a volcano roll and (I think) the yakuza roll. (It was either yakuza or Stetson - I caught grief from the table when I asked them to leave the fried stuff off the top. Lol). Both rolls I got outstanding! I am not usually a volcano roll kind of girl, I like more raw fish, but it sounded good at the moment. It was honestly the best volcano roll I've ever had.We had the same waitress that I had the last time and she remembered me, so the grower/shower jokes continued. She's a hoot and I'm glad she was there again!I really like this place and it's definitely on my top 10 sushi list.

Well, each time I brought a group from out of town, the comedy of errors got worse.  The last time?  One person's omelet wasn't brought at all.  Instead, his omelet filing was brought into another person's omelet along with her omelet filling--in other words, she was brought a mega omelet that contained the ingredients she ordered as well as his.  If that wasn't bad enough, at that same time, someone else at our table was given an omelet with cheese (which she cannot eat) and tomatoes (which she had asked for them to leave off).  One person at the table did have a correct order.  When the waiter went to correct all of these things, only half of the corrections were made.  Confused by reading this?  Me, too.

We made reservations, used the valet parking, and were seated on time at a hibachi table upstairs.  It was a lot of fun and the food was great!  I ordered the chicken and filet mignon, which comes with vegetable fried rice and three shrimp...and don't forget all the sake that your chef gives you/shoots all over your shirt.  The second time I went to Osaka, I booked a surprise party for my boyfriend for 15 people initially.  I ended up calling back about three times to add more and more people, and the staff was accommodating every time.  We had a very close call- the guests who were seated at our reserved table stayed almost 45 minutes longer than anticipated.  Yikes!  I understand that's not the restaurant's fault, though.  The staff helped keep the surprise through that and made sure my boyfriend didn't know that it wasn't just a party of 2, but a party of 20.  I'm not sure why there was no valet- I didn't understand if it was just that night or if the restaurant got rid of the service entirely.  I wish they had it that night for sure.  We were all seated at one large hibachi table (2 chef stations) downstairs in a private room and it was great!  I ordered the chicken and filet mignon again, as did my boyfriend, and they gave us our entrees and a birthday dessert free of charge.  The food was very tasty yet again.  Considering how...excited...our friends can get, Osaka did an excellent job serving, cooking, and entertaining us, as well as helping me out with the surprise and reservations!

And I'll say that I was not immediately overwhelmed by my first experience. It was a little thing here, and a little thing there, but what I can offer that both the brisket and turkey were excellent. (though cut a bit thick, and the cutter could have trimmed a little extra of the fat off the brisket).What I was most impressed by, was the way I was contacted by the staff and offered another meal at their expense. This is above and beyond, and more than unnecessary. BUT very appreciated. They (Micheal) took the time to agree that some of my concerns were legitimate, genuinely listen, and offer to make it right, while seemingly taking my suggestions to heart.  While I completely understand that every place can have an off night, the thing that always makes or breaks the experience for me is the service. And this type of service exemplifies my love of Austin, and the BBQ experience. It didn't take 24 hours for this place to want to ensure that I would not only come back, but have a good experience.While I would like to thank Micheal, it would not be right of me to take another meal at his expense, although I will definitely be giving BR BBQ another opportunity (on my personal dime.) As I can easily tell, there is a genuine love of the establishment, and a passion to satisfy their customers. This is what Austin and a true Texas barbecue experience is. I have edited my initial score to reflect not only the food, but the service, and the appreciation of their efforts.  We'll update this again as soon as I get a second plateful from this joint. Right now, since I can't do like 3.5, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt, and go with four."},{"name":"SPITZ","address":"2103 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My toddler and I loved this place!

The loukaniko was salty enough, but then you served me potatoes that tasted as though they had been soaked overnight in salt water, and then roasted with salt and herbs, and then sprinkled with salt before serving, and then finally served with a side of what amounts to a thick, liquefied salt solution.If you're one of those people who lick the salt from pretzels, then you might like this place.

Place was a bit dead at about 9pm.  A couple of tvs going above the bar.  Sat down at one of the tables next to the bar, figuring a server would come over, right?  NOPE!  They just looked at me?  Went to the bar myself at the end where the server actually gets the drinks themselves and does the ordering.  Heavy set bartender came over, greeted me ok.  I asked him for a Toasted Almond.  Pretty simple drink right?  He asked me if I wanted it in a martini glass? WHAT?  Or on the rocks?  I said, on the rocks.  He puts ice in the glass, then adds what he figures is amaretto and kahlua?  Then he asks the server to get him some milk.  What, no milk behind the bar?  Meanwhile I am looking at  my drink with the ice just melting into the liquor.  The liquor also was a light color?  Hello, did you add ANY Kahlua?  Ice melting, he is sitting their awkwardly just looking at it melt.  She brings him a big gallon of milk.  He pours the milk into the \\"short\\" melted ice glass, realizes it is too small, now dumps it into a tall glass that looked like a Chinese cocktail glass!  He fills the drink up with milk and it is PURE WHITE.  I am not kidding.  I'm saying to myself, is this guy for real?  Do you know how to bartend?  Do you know how to make a drink?  It was embarrassing.  Do you think I want to drink a big MILK drink in a bar?  The drink spills all over the tall glass, then he pours it back into the messy drippy short glass.  I look at it dumb founded and say, can you put some KAHLUA in it?  So he says sure......the drink was still white?  Then he asks me if I want the tall glass that had a bit in it and said he's just going to toss it.  I say sure as I am just amused and confused at this sloppy mess he is handing me and charging me $9 for.  What am I ordering? A freakin' milk shake at Johnny Rockets?  I pay it and gave him at $1...stupid me.....but it was just that awkward.  The ambience of the bar contained about 15 people if that, maybe less.

And while I am not accustomed to spending as much as I put towards groceries during a week night, I'm very glad I did since it was a truly delicious meal.Located in German town, parking is, of course, a nightmare.  One of the participants actually got a ticket for being just outside of the safe zone.  G Michaels does have valet parking for $5 (plus tip, I assume), but if it's after 5:00, apparently it is safe to park in the lot behind the hobby store.  Two locals to the area, including the hostess, confirmed this, and I didn't have any problems.  Otherwise, just be careful of all the many parking-related signs I guess.The place itself is very pleasant, with a lovely garden area, and dimly lit upscale feel.  Our group was seated in the back room near the kitchen, where there was enough noise that we couldn't make out conversations next to us (and I presume they couldn't hear ours), but not so loud as to make it difficult to hear.  There is also a long bar when you first walk in that can be tight if two people are trying to move opposite ways.  The rest of the seats are well spaced and sufficiently roomie, though.Now, the leader of the group insisted we had to try the shrimp and grits, and ordered up a plate. ....yeah, I could easily have made it my entire meal, not only for the sheer size but also the tastiness.  The shrimp tasted very fresh and were perfectly cooked.  And the grits....  Yeah, they were amazing.  There was almost a coconut flavor to them though I'm not sure any coconut milk is involved.  ....slightly sweet, wonderful creamy texture.  The sausage and ham are also very good, and add a bit of salt and tang.  So, definitely worth trying.  You could easily make a meal of it if you're trying to budget a bit.  As to main courses, well, with the Restaurant week special, we had to give it a go.  For my selection, I went with the Low Country crostini, yogurt marinated lamb, and lemon gingersnap tart. \\nThe crostini was very nice, with some sort of tangy sauce in the micro salad that I loved.  Like the shrimp and grits, the seafood aspect was delicious and meaty, and it went well with the pimento....of which I'm not normally a big fan.\\nThe tart was also good, though I tasted lemon far more heavily than gingersnap.  The texture was rather interesting...   This sounds so ...inappropriate... but it reminded me of apricot baby food.  You know how super silky and smooth that is? Anyways, it was a bit unusual, with good flavor.  I especially liked the passion fruit sauce that came with it.  \\nThe best part of the meal (aside the shrimp and grits) though was definitely the main course.  Two large skewers of super tender, flavorful lamb that just melted in the mouth, with the meat spread by roasted tomatoes and onions.  Now, I'm not a huge fan of either of these vegetables, but they were very nicely done here, falling apart in a bite and full of both their natural flavors and the delicious sauce. All this was served on a sizable bed of well roasted potatoes and other vegetables with the crunch of almonds.Service was terse but polite.  Drinks were refilled before we had a chance to notice they were empty, even though we were all drinking water (we all drove separate).  No problems here.And prices... well, the $30 prix fixe really was a good deal since you get a nice appetizer and dessert. Otherwise, prices for an entree alone are $17~32.  \\nFor a nice meal out or special occasion, though, I would definitely say it's worth giving a go based on this experience."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Biggest selection of draft craft beers I've ever seen.

I really, really wanted this place to be good. We went to the establishment that was there a few years ago and just love the spot. Great location, great views. Unfortunately, we should have known better based on what happened when they were under construction...way back before the restaurant opened, they were promoting the restaurant on Facebook/social media/online and one day I checked to find an opening date but could not. At that point I went on to the reservations link on the website to see when they were taking reservations and to my surprise, they were taking reservations for that Saturday night. (this was a long time ago, before it opened)  We made a reservation and arrived at Mission on the Bay (40 minutes away) to find that though the building *seemed* done, it was not, and they were not yet open. I sent a Facebook message and whomever it was that responded basically said - sorry - that was our beta website and those aren't \\"real\\" reservations. Ok. Great. We moved on.  Fast forward, we haven't had an opportunity to get over there.  \\nWe decided to make reservations days in advance for a birthday, on Sunday night of labor day weekend.  We arrived on time for our reservation and the hostess said she'd check if our table is ready. We waited about 5 minutes and she came back to seat us. She sat us at probably the only table in the restaurant that you COULDN'T see the view. It was right next to a pillar, in a small 2-person table tucked in the corner. Because it was my birthday and we made reservations so far in advance and there were tons of open tables, my husband decided to ask if we could move. They did move us to another table, not on the windows but in the middle row. We waited over 10 minutes for our waitress to come and take our drink order, and she arrived with an attitude. We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  She never came back until we flagged her down, then she brought our drinks.  We then waited another 30 minutes for our appetizer, asking twice if it was coming out.  The waitress informed us that the kitchen was \\"really busy\\" but she would \\"do her best\\".  We had noticed that other tables got bread, so we asked if we could have some bread while we waited.  The mussels we ordered finally came and we could barely eat them because they were so spicy they were lighting our mouth on fire. We are huge fans of mussels, it's our favorite dish and this is the first time we haven't eaten them. \\nNext, clam chowder. Not good. Thick, bland, and served without crackers.  \\nI ordered the Hanger Steak au Poivre...it said it was served with au gratin potato and cipollini onion balsamic sauce. First off, the steak was overcooked. Next, the potatoes were crunchy, not even cooked through. Lastly, the cipollini onions were non-existent. \\nMy husband got the steak tips and they were just ok, but better than my meal.  \\nMost importantly, the service of this meal was so awful that had the food even been stellar, it would have been ruined by the service. Not only were we there for 2 1/2 hours for dinner, but our waitress was rude, slow, had an attitude with other tables and genuinely did not want to be there. I will say, the server did send over a manager who ultimately comp'd our appetizer because we waited so long for food in general. Really too bad, this could be a good place!"},{"name":"Jovita's Mexican Restaurant","address":"1619 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Here's a tip for you if you're planning on visiting Jovita's to see music:\\nIf they've still got the \\"Servers Wanted\\" sign out front (as they did last night), then be sure and do your eating and drinking before you get there. Seriously. We went there last night to watch a friend's band play. It was a Sunday evening, early, so although there were people there, it wasn't what I would call crowded at all. But, because they only had 2 servers working, it took us nearly TWO HOURS to get our dinner order taken and be served our meal--we had a table of four. At one point, our waiter got so frustrated with his situation (and the fact that we wanted to split our check), he literally threw his order pad on the ground and stormed off in the the middle of us trying to (finally) place our order after waiting to do so for over 45 minutes. Wow. He eventually (like after about 20 minutes) came back and apologized for his behavior and finished taking our order, but still...And when our food DID arrive, the food was okay (although only warmish), but we probably would've eaten anything by that point. Jovita's needs to decide if they want to be a restaurant that has music and drinks or just a music venue. If this Austin institution wants to continue to serve food (which, given all the Tex-Mex options within walking distance doesn't really seem necessary), they need to step it up significantly or risk pissing off their staff and customers and ruining everyone's experience."},{"name":"Nick's Food To Go","address":"240 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The best gyro I've ever had the privilege of devouring."},{"name":"Bistro Niko","address":"3344 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ordered a steak and it didn't disappoint.

Most of the time the food is  good, but this night it was spectacular!  I had their house smoked salmon w/ crispy potato cake and chevre - divine and plenty for two to share.  I have had their crab cake on another occasion as an appetizer, and loved it so much I asked for two as an entree.  I'm from Maryland and am extremely picky about crab cakes, and this is the best I have ever eaten.  Perfect.  The only thing was that instead of adding another side, it only came with the slaw they serve with the appetizer.  Not a problem - that slaw is very good.  I forget what my husband had for an app, but his lamb shank was excellent.  As always, we were too full for dessert.  A couple of tips:  do not be more than 10 min late for your reservation (and call even if you're going to be 5 min late) - they will give away your reservation.  I am also picky about where I'm seated, so I always ask to by a window, to be away from a busing station, away from the exterior door, and preferably away from large groups; sometimes it works, esp. if you have the first reservation of the evening at 5:30.

But from my one lunch experience at this location, I feel like there's a lot of room for improvement. My burger and fries was nothing special, but they certainly priced it that way ($11 once I added cheese and grilled onions, which was nothing more than a lightly browned slab of red onion). I usually eat out to get something I couldn't make myself at home. And finally, their menu isn't very large, especially when you compare it to Henry's.

We finally went out for dinner here on a Friday around 5PM. Street parking in the front and private lot in the back.Brought right to a table and immediately ordered spring rolls before we figured out what we were ordering:-7 course beef (swapped out beef rice soup and beef salad with butter beef)\\n-1 seafood pho with pork\\n-1 deluxe pho\\n-1 black bean fish claypot\\n-1 bowl of rice for the claypotAs one of my fellow diners said \\"It's like a buffet, but not!\\"Primarily focusing on the 7 course beef, it was so much food. You get a plate of veggies (carrots, cucumbers, apples, pickled daikon, leafy greens), rice wrappers, a bowl of hot water for the wrappers, and vinegary/appley dipping sauce. I was a total newbie with rice wrappers but you take the round disc, dip it in the water, and still holding it, rotate it until every surface is wet and set it on your plate to get wrapping! Don't gotta soak that rice paper.The beef fondue was a great start to the meaty marathon, wrap your own spring rolls galore or just eat the meat. The butter beef was amazingly good, flavorful, and you could eat it alone or wrapped up in a roll. The beef wrapped in Hawaiian lot leaf was interesting and good. I didn't know onions could be so sweet but the onions in the grilled beef were almost sugary sweet. The steamed pate beef was a delightful middle ground.

With around half of those from craft brewers right here in Texas.  The bartenders are really accommodating when it comes to allowing you try several beers.  They have some really interesting ones on tap, like a jalapeno infused beer.The sausage is really good and the apps and sides are all amazing.  For apps - be sure to try the poutine, a Canadian spin on chili cheese fries.  The German Potato salad is amazing as well, easily embarrassing the one at Salt Lick.It is unfortunate though that they got rid of the Executive Lunch.  I suppose it was too good to be true.  Any traditional sausage, any side and any Texas pint for $8.  A group of us went the other day and ordered the same thing and our bills were about $17 a piece.  The waiter said they had to get rid of it because it was costing them too much money.My only question is, why not just increase the price?  As it stands I will not go back for lunch.  Even though the food is good, $17 is a lot for lunch, especially when the main item is sausage which is relatively cheap everywhere else in the world.  My recommendation would be to bring back the lunch special but make it $12.  Or get rid of the side, $8 for a sausage and a beer.

Our waitress wasn't rude, she just seemed to be thinking about something else (maybe the ten top next to us?) the entire time we were there. I think it would have been better if she had written our order down, because my coworker's house salad came out with chicken, which she did not request. She graciously didn't throw a fit about it, and our waitress took it off the bill, no problem. My chicken sandwich was spicy, but had too much mayo. I'll request less next time. The chicken also was about twice the size of the bun, which made it awkward to eat as a sandwich, but I got over it. The parmesan fries were delicious and very thin-sliced, which I really enjoy but don't find very often.\\nFinally, when we paid our check my coworker asked the waitress for a box for the chicken she didn't eat, and she just reacted poorly. She kind of challenged the question for a while and I think my coworker got embarrassed, because she said nevermind, but our waitress finally said \\"what am I thinking, I'm going to throw it away anyway, of course you can have a box.\\" It's totally something that I would do, but it threw me and my coworker for a loop.

Locally-acquired antiques and other nostalgia decorate the dining room. There are upwards of a dozen local teens are on the job every time we walk in, probably even more than are really needed to run a small pizza shop.  Clearly this is a business that is dedicated to and invested in the community, and it pleases me to see that the community returns the favor by filling the parking lot every weekend night. They don't accept credit/debit cards, they don't deliver, and you'll eat your pizza on styrofoam plates if you opt to dine in.

I don't disagree that they are a quality pizza, but its also a parlor with a serious identity problem.  When the first opened up, they were this bizarre shop offering gourmet pizza in a grungry storefront.  They've upped the decor with a lot of kitsch and some weirdly dim mood lighting, but its still just a facelift on a mediocre space.  Yet, they still insist on presenting themselves as a gourmet option.  I guess dropping slices is part of that, as before they'd keep a slice pie sitting in a low-rent light box to keep it warm like they were a concession stand at a college arena.  Still, the fact remains that they are sitting on Mass Ave in a fast-food footprint.  Just deal with it and do slices right, already.I do like their pizza, but its kind of weird all the same.  Its not like anything else I've ever had, really.  Just something unique about it, in good and bad ways.  Its thick, but not thick enough to seem purposeful.  The sauce is more than your usual smushed tomatoes.  The cheese browns up oddly.  It just looks cheap, you know?  But the pie is tasty, I must admit.  I haven't ventured into the fancy faire, but friends who have seem pleased.  Still, with Crazy Dough's just around the corner, I rarely feel the need to stop here any more, so I'm not missing the slices.  I mean, it is good, but not quite as good as it thinks it is, either.

Proteins, the ribeye was good, close facsimile of bulgogi. I added the spicy chicken and found too many rubbery pieces parts in it. The kimchi looked bland, no colorful pop and the flavor matched. Maybe they were looking for something not too spicy and thus left out the hot paste, but kimchi is kimchi and it should be a hallmark of any place which slaps Korean anything on the wall. There were plenty of veggie toppings along with sauces. I ended up trying the magic sauce which was more like the siracha mayo on sushi but was way too sweet. The kimchi sauce didn't leave any memorable flavors to make me say it was good. Bland.

First things first. The food is simply amazing. It's always hot and fresh as they don't wait for the whole order to be ready, it comes as it is made available. Hubs and I have never ordered anything we didn't love. \\"Drinks\\" - Hubs usually gets a beer or sake. They have an extensive selection of both. I prefer a stout or porter and sadly, as is with most places, they had neither or just the obligatory milk stout which I'm not a biggest fan of. I opted instead for sweet tea which I think must be a green tea blend as it wasn't your typical sweet tea. It was still good, just not what I was expecting. If you order water, it comes out with an orange slice in it although I think I was seeing some tables with Lemon slices as well.  I will say that we ended up with a hair in one of our drinks and it was too dark to be any of ours. The manager did come over and apologize and let us know they took the drink off the check and that all the Girls are required to wear their hair pulled back. That said, there are several boys their with longer hair and it could have easily been one of theirs. Maybe instead of it being a gender based policy, it should be based on the length of the hair regardless of gender. Just my thoughts. I also felt a little disenchanted by her apology as I expected nothing less than to have the hardly touched drink removed from the bill. \\"Appetizers\\"- The wings that are finished off on the girl are delicious with the different sauces you can choose from. I personally like mixing the sweet Thai chili and the Sriracha sauce together. The spring rolls are packed with fresh veggies.  The ultimate must have on the menu is the Roti Canai. I could probably sit and eat just that all day. Simply amazing. My kids (4 and 13) also loved eating the Roti. My oldest said that it tasted similar to a croissant. I can see that. The curry sauce is spicy, spicier than I remembered it, but still oh so good. We ordered some fries as well for the kids and they come out with a black seasoning. My first thought was that it was pepper but the waiter assured me it was not. The kids would touch the fries, so next time we'll order them without the seasoning for the kids, but otherwise they were really good. They come with a side of sweet Thai chili sauce for dipping. This was another dish that I know I could sit and eat the whole time. \\"Main meal\\" - Hubs loves the basil fried rice with beef and usually orders this when we come. I'm not big on basil and the fried rice has somewhat of a specific flavor associated with fried rices that I just am not fond of, but again, my Hubs loves. So if you love fried rices, I would definitely recommend it. I on the other hand, am a noodle girl. I can say without a doubt this is the best Pad Thai food be ever had. It's just the right amount of spice and it's not dry like some pad thais can be. It never ever disappoints. That was my leftover I finished today and it was just as good as it was yesterday.

The pretzel is fluffy and the bratwurst slices are nice and salty. The scallions (green onions for the unaware) also add a nice crisp light factor to cut the grease.

We were ignored by the staff for a good 15 minutes until I flagged down a server. The server that handled us wasn't even working our table, but she felt bad after we told her no one had come over to check on us. After that, she did a nice job of checking back with us and making conversation along the way. Before that, my wife wanted to get up and leave, but I told her that the place has really good ratings so that we should give them a few more minutes. They weren't that busy, but it seems like the staff is either new or not super experienced (on that night).We ordered the coconut chicken soup as a starter and I had a volcano roll. I have to say, the soup was excellent and the volcano roll was absolutely delicious. They put generous amounts of smoked krab on top that gave it a great taste. My wife order two other rolls which were very good as well. Not only that, the rolls are reasonably priced and the portions are just right.Additionally, the server gave us a 20% discount due to us having to wait extra for a server on that evening.

This joint has been a fixture in Vancouver for years, but it is certainly not a four start place--well, maybe by Vantuckey standards.  I should have known when we arrived and the place was essentially devoid of other diners on a warm evening. It also smelled strongly of cleaning product. In any case, the positives first:  Wife's carne asada bistec (steak) was actually cooked well, was tender and delicious.  The service was attentive if not paying attention (forgot guacamole side, request for hot sauce, and one other thing I don't recall).  The food, overall was ok and seemed fresh and the salsa was very good.  So, why only 2 starts you ask?  Mainly because the food came out barley warm, more like tepid and one dish (birthday girl's) was entirely cold in the center and had to be sent back.  Whenever Mexican food comes out quickly it's usually a sign of microwave production and I think that's probably the case here.  Taco shells were also cold, though the filling was warm.  Also, what kind of 4-star Mexican restaurant doesn't have a selection of sauces on the table--one had to ask.  The $10.99 giant margarita hardly had any liquor in it and was half melted on arrival to the table.  Finally, I informed the waiter about the birthday, expecting as in most restaurants for the birthday person to get a complimentary dessert, perhaps Flan with a candle in it---nothing.  My guess is he forgot or doesn't know that custom.Was hoping for more.  The local taco shop chain, \\"Thank you very much\\" is better than Lindo Mexico.  I shouldn't think we'll return--there are much better full-service Mexican restaurants in Clark County.  Oh, the obese couple who came in after us was a good floor show, as the man read the news of the day to his companion, especially about the school-shooting tragedy of the morning--very nice conversation to overhear at dinner, let alone during a birthday.

Bistro Niko is luckily a good choice for French fare! One of my gal pals and I were driving down Peachtree on a Friday night after shoe shopping at Phipps. It was a cool summer night, the sunroof was open, and we were gabbing on about the wonderful deal we got on our shoes, when this wonderful aroma slammed our senses. I immediately turned into the driveway and made our way in. When I pulled up we had the choice of valet or self parking. I tend to shy away from valets when I can because of some horrible past experiences, so I pulled up to the parking deck. There was no signage as to rates or parking validation. That was a minus. Regardless, we parked and walked in. As a few of the posters mentioned the hostesses looked like they were going to \\"da club\\". They also seemed quite confused as to how to seat 2 people. They had a few tables available, and we asked to sit close to the patio. Between two of them, we ended up doing a loop around the restaurant until we pointed out the table. Because of the parking and the confused hostesses, I am dinging them a star. Our server was adorable and attentive. We weren't super hungry so we decided to split everything. They were very accommodating. We couldn't decide between two wines, so our server brought a tasting of both. For an appetizer, we ordered the escargot. Loved the puff pastry shell with it. They even brought us more warm bread to sop up the the yummy herb butter and olive oil sauce in the bottom of the dish. For dinner we split the steak au poivre, which melted in our mouths. For dessert, the profiteroles! Vanilla ice cream sandwiched in crispy pastry shells with a warm dark chocolate sauce and sliced almonds. I went to bed that night with a happy belly and some decked out feet."},{"name":"Mario's Italian Restaurant","address":"1733 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Lexington","stars":"4","text":"Chicken and eggplant parm are great!

The wait was only about 30 minutes, which was good considering it was a Saturday evening. The wait was made easier by a cocktail waitress who frequently came by to see if we wanted anything while we waited.\\nOnce seated, our very friendly server, Joe, greeted us promptly and explained the evenings specials in such a manner that wasn't rehearsed, but simply indicative of the fact that he was quite knowledgable. He even went over some of the back-story on the restaurant as a farm-to-table style place that supported locally sustained product, which I always appreciate.\\nThe interior of the place was well-designed and led to the feel of a fine dining establishment without all the expectation of the patrons to follow suit (I felt completely at home in my jeans and flip-flops).\\nFor the appetizer, we chose the chef's special that night of Fried Green Tomatoes on a bed of corn relish and topped with Ricotta. My partner had never had fried green tomatoes and discovered that he was not a fan, so I dutifully (and with great pleasure) cleaned off the whole plate. ;-)\\nFor our entrees, he went for the NY Strip which was served with some extremely wonderful jazzed up version of mashed potatoes. They were fantastic!\\nMyself, I chose the chorizo and jack cheese stuffed pork medallions. They were drizzled with some sort of chipotle cream sauce.  All in all, I found this entree to be extremely bland and would not recommend it.\\nWe finished our meal with \\"Da Chocolate Bomb\\", which needs no further elaboration.\\nIn short, some of the menu items were hit or miss, but I definitely saw the potential.

Nestled right next to the Chattahoochee River, this is a the perfect spot for brunch or a romantic dinner.We revisited dinner there on a cool summer night and it was great. We started with the oysters on the half shell and their signature starter - the house smoked salmon on a crispy potato cake with goat cheese. So tasty! We also enjoyed a special heirloom tomato salad, love that they offer seasonal plates.One of the dishes they are most known for is the slow roasted Carolina rabbit, but we went with two seafood specials since they were in fresh, but there are so many tasty entrees on the menu to try out from Rainbow Trout and Halibut to Quail and Duck breast. For dessert we indulged in the Popcorn Sundae, which was absolutely amazing and definitely big enough for 2-4 people to share. It comes with house made cracker jack - which is really tasty.We sat outside on the covered patio, which was really nice. After we enjoyed a view of the river from the lighted garden.

The decor is a fusion of modern minimalism and Japanese sensibilities.  Decorations are pretty sparse but one notices the bamboo, Japanese stone lanterns, etc.We were seated in one of their private function rooms.  You actually sit on the floor and rest your feet in a hole underneath the floor here.  We ordered many things to try out.  To start off, I would recommend you skip the Beef Tataki and the Hotake (Baked Scallop).  The beef is too thinly sliced and the flavor is just not there.  This has to do the quality of the beef because raw food does not conceal the natural taste of foods.  I found the Hatake lacking in actual scallop but was instead replaced with a lot of imitation crab meat and squid.  There is also too much mayo on Oga's version of this classic.  The sushi was pretty good.  I wouldnt say that their sushi stands out but.definity on par with the better sushi establishments around Boston.  I would say the same of the maki rolls with the standout being the caterpillar.  We also ordered the Tepanyaki of beef rib eye and chicken in teriyaki sauce on a sizzling platter.  The beef here was obviously the better choice coming out tender and flavorful whereas the chicken was a bit more dry and flavorless.  Still, this dish was very good served on a bed of onions and a side of rice.  After the food, location, and decor I would rate Oga a strong 3 stars but the 4th star was for the excellent service we got from our waiter all night long.  She was just impressive bringing new cups of hot green tea before I even ask for it.  Refilling water consistently.  She gave us very good recommendations and was just on point with everything in general.  She switched plates after every course so the sauces and flavors won't be mixed and she cleaned our table each time she switched plates.  She earned that 1 final star for Oga.  Overall, I would recommend Oga's Sushi.  My only negative of the night is if you get seated in the private dining area, the sound really carries.  We were seated next to this large, drunk, belligerent table and they annoyed us most of the night.  I understand that Oga had no control of this so no stars taken off."},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Went last night and the food was fine.

Well not so new. Brian's Restaurant was the long standing keeper of where the newly opened Elliot's Public House now occupies. The Orlando Sentinel Newspaper carried an article which stated that the former Executive Chef of Rollins College bought Brian's Restaurant and will be the new keeper of this neighborhood space.Recently in Orlando, the new buzz words in restaurant names are Gastro Pubs and Public Houses. But these names or references are not new. These are old English terms which depicted establishments in the ole country. Granted, the new generation of restaurateurs are actually trying to build a business around the concepts after their names. Most of these businesses seem to be doing well. If there is anyone out there who thinks that a Gastro Pub or Public House should be an exact replica of Great Britain, then so be it. As evolution would have it, everything old is new and everything new is old. Where that lies, Elliott's Public House takes a bold step catering to this neighborhood.The current restaurant space is two interior rooms and an outdoor patio. The patio faces busy North Orange Ave. Some may be bothered by this, but look across the road to beautiful Lake Ivanhoe and watch kayakers slide across pristine waters. Or enjoy the energy movement brings. There is a fantastic wine bottle wall art on the patio that immediately starts a conversation. Both interior rooms are well appointed with nostalgic art. The ornate lighting sets the mood and almost brings the space to another era, if that is possible with light. Soft modern colors warms and wraps the space as a good neighbor would. There is a work permit on the outside wall facing the parking lot, which suggest more expansion. Could an actual bar be in the making?Breakfast, lunch and dinner is served here. The menu hints of European in keeping with the Public House nod. Portions are ample and enough to share or gobble down alone. Having to serve three meals, of course, there are items available for dinner only. There is even a Happy Hour from 3pm -7pm daily. I'd venture to say that drop in anytime there is something that will quench your beak. Full food reviews are on my blog\\nApart from little service glitches, this was a wonderful meal. As in every new place there will be misteps. That's expected. How they make adjustments in the future will be the true test. Nothing to go crazy about, just a little polishing. Parking in the little lot is tricky. Not a lot of room to maneuver. Business around Ivanhoe Village and Mills 50 seems on a rise. With construction at Mills Park on Mills Ave in full swing, there is a big boom in development. I can't wait to see what else is going to paint the dining scene in this area.

Even though it's a small cafe, our wait time wasn't too bad.  It gave us time to get to know the manager( who was the one taking customer names and seating them).  He is such a nice guy!  After being seated, he stopped by our table more than once to check on us and give us his personal food recommendations.  FYI, the shrimp and corn chowder was absolutely delicious!  However, this chowder isn't on the daily menu, it's one of the specials and not served on a regular basis.  We also had various tacos which were also very good!  Cafe Java has excellent service by waitstaff and very reasonable prices as well.  Cafe Java is definitely a place we'll choose again when passing through Austin."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Never lets me down.I came back to Canoe recently on a diet.

The toppings were great with a really delicious tomato sauce. I found the crust a bit chewy for my liking but the flavour of the wood-oven really made it taste authentic (the oven is actually inside the food truck!) The only downsides I found were the price ($11.50 for the individual sized pizza - $11 + tax), the length of time it took to get our food (which is understandable since each pizza is made to order, so the quality of the food is there), and the lack of cutlery available if customers need it (since the pizzas are hot out of the oven, the toppings don't have time to 'set' before eating so it was messy trying to eat it).

I had a rather large party and we got there earlier than I had planned because Star Lanes was so busy.  Arrived around 7pm on a Saturday night so I knew we would have a wait - was told wait would be around an hour.  Totally fine so we found space at the bar and got some drinks.  Two hours later, the hostess asked me if we would be fine with 3 tables that could be pushed together.  Two tables were already open and the one in the middle had 4 people that the hostess said \\"are about leave.\\"   It sounded good to me and we had already been waiting twice as long as we were told.  She told us that we could go ahead and sit at the 2 open tables.  So as I was trying to get part of my party over, another hostess attempted to seat another party at one of the tables.  I got that straightened out but my party was completely divided - 1/3 at one table, 1/3 at the other table, and 1/3 at the bar.  The party in the middle were cashed out but continued to sit there and would not leave.  Other larger tables began to open up and other parties were seated first - while my party continued to be separated the entire night.  The manager came over once we were about to leave and basically did nothing other than say \\"we can't control how long people stay.\\"   I understand the staff has no control over how long a party stays but they do have control over telling me the party is \\"about to leave\\" when clearly they were not AND they have control over seating other large parties at tables that would have accommodated my party even though we were sitting, divided the entire night.

I'm way more relaxed and understanding than most guests and will typically still over tip for mediocre service if I can see our server is swamped and doing their best. This girl made us feel like she didn't want us there. Acted as if she knew we weren't going to tip well. Well she was right.

It was creative and appealing to both the eyes and taste buds.  They made combinations of food you normally wouldn't think of.  The best is to go with 4 people so you can order the whole menu and get a taste of everything.  My favorite of the night was beef tartare and aged spinalis.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A PROBLEM!!!First of all, I LOVE DESCHUTES. They're one of my top three fave breweries. I have always loved the Mirror Pond and was extremely happy to learn that it was in the Pearl District (when I moved to Portland), which was a hop and a skip away from my place. I have gone to Deschutes numerous times and I have always had a good time there from watching March Madness games, getting late night drinks on a Friday night, or grabbing a brewsky after bar hopping from Henry's, Rogue, etc. I have tried a lot of their beers. I must have got the sampler about 4 times, which is a steal btw. I have to admit that some of the beers aren't my cup of beer, such as the Organic Ale but most of their beers are great. I especially love the Red Chair, Black Butte, Mirror Pond, Hop in the Dark, and the Inversion. Most people don't know this but they have this contraption thing on their wall that you can throw coins into. If you get the coin into the contraption your coin will spit back out. My girl friends and I have tried numerous times and failed. But it's extremely fun to sit at the bar, throw some coins, watch a few games, and munch on some deviled eggs. Everyone who is visiting Portland needs to go to Deschutes. Seriously!!! It's a block or two from Powell's so you can buy a few books and then a few beers... and then hop on the streetcar back to your hotel. P.S.

I was sent here by a friend who totally recommended them for their extensive Gluten Free options. Honestly, Gluten Free doesn't mean I will have options because I don't eat meat either, so I was a bit skeptical about how many actual choices I would have.Let me start though with the service.  We went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't impossibly full and it was a gorgeous night as well, so outdoor seating was an option.  The hostess was very nice, sat us outside as requested and told us Sumner would be our server.Sumner was sweet as PIE, but not only that, once I explained my two issues he told me that he understood completely being vegetarian himself.  The relief I felt by not getting the blank stare and/or roll of the eyes just made my evening.I perused the menu and is it EXTENSIVE.  I had chosen a few things I thought may be both GF and Vegetarian and he came back with a list of items just for me.  So we figured out what would be best and we happily waited for our food.I had the Tom Yum Soup w/o the shrimp, it was so ridiculously tasty I kind of didn't share with my hubby.  A noodle dish and a fried rice that is regularly made sans soy sauce.  I apologize but I don't remember the names of those two dishes.  My hubby added the wok cooked lettuce and fries.  He swears they were both equally delish.Sumner (not named after Sting, I asked), kept on coming to check on us.  Had the biggest smile and took a moment to chat about music after the query about Sting. I just want to put him in my pocket and keep him forever, but since that would not only be completely inappropriate but insane, I shall not.  But I will be requesting a table that he is taking care of for sure next time I go."},{"name":"Vinito Ristorante","address":"4971 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"We stopped in to grab a quick lunch while doing some shopping.

Good: You can tell that everyone who works here is really trying to make it work. The owners are personable and friendly. The food is a good value. On the weekdays they have a $5 burger and fry deal that's really good since the burger is quite large. Their fries are really tasty. I haven't been for breakfast yet, but those look to be a good value too. Dinner options seem a bit pricey, but I haven't been for dinner and don't know how large the portions are.If you're going to a cheap, \\"home-cookin'\\" place for lunch, chances are you want something filling, not a salad or sandwich on white bread. It seems like everything for lunch is a sandwich and it would be nice to see some of the dinner dishes moved over to the lunch side.    Bad: Salad bar looks terrible. Its not lit well and everything is just sitting on ice covered in plastic wrap. The waitress is a little scatterbrained. She didn't know the price of the daily special and seemed irked that it was taking me a little while to decide what to order. She took my drink for a refill and didn't come back for 10 minutes then laughed and said \\"I forgot about it\\". I was eating a spicy chicken wrap and really needed a drink. Perhaps its just a personal peeve since I work as a chef, but seeing the cook with long hair out of a cap, unshaved, and with piercings in was...not appetizing. In Florida, every restaurant is required to have one chef/cook who has completed food safety classes on the line at any time.  One of the first things you learn in that class is to put your hair up--all of it-- and remove piercings.  Seeing such a disregard for this aspect of cleanliness, I can't help but wonder what else they slack off on, and because of this I don't think I'll be back again.   My suggestions: Lose the salad bar, lose some of the religious stuff on the walls, get better lighting, dust your ceiling fans, and give your cook a shaving razor."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti�?Restaurant","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"They had a Korean BBQ special with short ribs and fries.

I'm not a die-hard UFC fan, but this was a fight I wouldn't mind watching.  The sign was black w/ red fluorescents, no visual as to what business it belonged to, so I proceeded to exit and put on my Inspector Gadget hat on.    So right where Target is located (near Peyton Gin) I run into Mister Tramps - a place I've never seen before.  From the initial glance of the darkened windows I thought \\"no way - a gentleman's bar next to Target?!?\\", but as I pulled in and read the sign - - it's a sports bar!  I wonder if they'll still take $1 bills..?  The UFC pre-card fights were about to start, they were charging $7 admission.  Other places charge $10-15, so $7 was somewhat reasonable.  It wasn't that packed (yet) but I was delighted to see their massive big screen TV in the back.  Since everything's negotiable I politely asked:  \\"how about 2-fer $10, and I'll buy some food?\\".  After some discussion, they agreed.  Wow, now I'm really happy!  I called my friend (who's a big UFC fan) and told him to get his ass down here asap!The place filled up quickly, and in the back they had 3 sections / rows of long tables facing the big screen.  I grabbed a good seat next to a couple who had been there for a while.  I asked them how the food was, they surprisingly said that it was exceptional - especially the soups.  Really?  The last time I every heard someone recommending soup was on Seinfeld (Soup Nazi), okay, I'll give it a shot.    The Thai Red Curry Soup (Roasted Red Peppers and Mushrooms in a Red Curry and Coconut Broth) for $6.99 a bowl was really good!  There's more broth than stuff, but it was very tasty and spicy.  The Club (Chicken, Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Presto-Mayo and Provolone) w/ fries were pretty good too, although I would have liked more bacon in my sandwich.  Overall the food here is better quality than I expected for a sports bar as I was impressed.  Service was good, but my water filler tapered off at times.  The cool thing is that the whole wait staff helps each other out, so you can ask anyone for help.   Got to watch Shogun knock out the undefeated Machida for the title for a nice price over some good food - - that's definitely a 4-star experience."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place lives up to the hype for brunch.

Just the Swiss cheese and wine concoction I remembered. We also ordered lentil soup to get our vegetables in and it was just as delicious as ever. Nothing is too overbearing and the texture is the perfect mix of smooth with some small bits of veggies still in tact. Now I remember why I went nuts for this stuff as a kid. The chicken schnitzel was amazing. It was quite literally fresh out of the pan when it came to our table and it paired very well with the subtle Madeira sauce. We got some spaetzle on the side instead of cabbage and it was a great basic spaetzle. A bit browned from being sauteed in butter with some parsley lightly sprinkled on top. The mashed potatoes were good but nothing to write home about. Overall, the food was right texture-wise and flavor-wise.

The online happy hour menu lured us in. We were the only 2 people in the bar and the restaurant side had 2 patrons. 4 people total in the building. This should have tipped us off. \\nWe think of happy hour menus as getting a good deal on food and or drink to draw people in during slower hours. We both ordered The Minion. A burger with fries for $5.50. What we got was a \\"burger\\" the size of a slider and 7 fries. The burger was very good. But it was about 4 bites of food. With 7 fries. Yes, we had 7 whole fries.  For $5.50. This is not a good deal. And the fries?  They were almost cold. Not warm. No crisp. Very soggy and very dark.  Almost black. Limp. Greasy.  It is almost as if some other patron didn't finish their fries and the cook took their leftover fries and threw them on our plates as an after thought. The fries we received definitely had not seen a fryer in at least 30 minutes before being thrown on our plates. Yes, they were as bad as you can imagine.\\nThe menu states their draft beers are regular priced as $3.50 - $5.50 with $1 off during happy hour.  For the beer I had during happy hour, I was charged $5.00.  Not sure if they raised the prices from $3.50 - $5.50 to $6 and I was getting a $6 pint for $5 during happy hour or if they forgot to take $1 off during happy hour.

In this case, a tight and chewy noodle!Don't come here too late, it is crowded! My party was the first seated on a wednesday night. As the very gracious waiter/son brought our dishes out, the restaurant was overrun with patrons and take-out walk-ins. YIKES! this is a popular place!They don't serve a table full of ban chan like their neighbor, but they do make fresh noodles! I've sampled hand-pulled noodles from various establishments and these are about par for the course. Their fresh kim chee and pickled daikon was delicious. The dishes were prepared well, however all noodle/stir fry dishes are basically the same tossed and wok-fried with cabbage, pepper, carrots and celery. I think sticking to the dishes where the noodles are the prime star would be best here. The teiji bulgogi (spicy pork) was excellent, served hot on a cast iron plate full of onions. \\nI was not really impressed with the mandu here, it was hand made but was lacking in depth and flavor. It needed to be soaked in the vinegar-chili oil sauce for enhancement.I'll be back to eat the eel and a bowl of noodles, we all enjoyed eating here!"},{"name":"Soul Vegetarian No  2","address":"652 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Ever since going vegan two years ago, all my Atlanta friends have been telling me to go here if I ever visit.

Before I even get started, Chipotle isn't owned by McDonald's; McDonald's financed them. This place serves great burritos with high quality ingredients. Before the animals are slaughtered they're treated humanely and not pumped full of those strange things agribusiness is experimenting on us...they die with a smile on their faces, translated to smiles on our faces and stomachs. The guacamole is pretty damn good, too, and vegetarians can bypass the corpses in favor of the farty fruits. Oh yeah, and they use romaine lettuce!Too bad this chain originated in hateful Denver, but I can't fault the food for it.

Recently moved into this area and was excited to have a Chinese food place fairly close.\\nFinally got the chance to go today for a late lunch.There was only 1 table of customers, but it was late, so I didn't let that worry me. The owner was VERY attentive. I explained that I had not been there and asked for his recommendation. He suggested the Triple Delight, I think..I told him that I enjoy my Asian food very hot. Like crazy hot. He said they could make it extra spicy for me. Food was finished fairly quickly and looked good. Headed home excited for the meal. Not only was the food not at all spicy, like I even used the cup of hot chili oil he sent with me, and there was really no spice at all. Further, the food itself was really bland. The veggies tasted fresh, but everything lacked seasoning and flavor. The brown sauce was watery and loose...not thick. The eggroll was fine. The hot and sour soup was alright. So, I may try it again at some point. But more likely that I'd go in the other direction and go to IM Thai instead."},{"name":"Greg's Pizza Roast Beef and Seafood","address":"296 Shawsheen Ave","city":"Wilmington","stars":"4","text":"Have tried the pizza, Steak & cheese, pastrami, BLT subs as well as the antipasto and never been disappointed.

A pretty brick pathway weaves amongst grass, hedges and flowers, making this place truly delightful, especially when Kendall really is all business.

I saved the leftovers and i still never finished them.  Now, a word about the falafel.  The falafel here is PHENOMENAL.  It is different than Nicholas in that it is a little bit crispier and have a little more texture.  I would be hard pressed to say which is better - although I might go with Karam. It was mind blowing.  And, knowing this I asked for 1 extra falafel, but the man over the phone said I would have to order a side order in addition.  I thought that would be too much so I passed on that. But low and behold he threw 1 extra falafel in for me when I went to pick up the order!  Now that's pretty sweet.Also, the atmosphere and decor in the actual restaurant are really cool.  You really do feel like you might as well be sitting in some place in Beirut.

The Lincoln Group never fails to deliver. Capo is a great alternative to Lincoln, as it specializes in Italian cuisine. The pasta and pizza dough are made in house. Like Lincoln, portion sizes are generous. The entrees do not come with a side, but are an Ok price for the size of your meal. We got the assorted olives, marinated in house. They were delicious. I had to get the chicken parm, as that is how I rate any Italian restaurant au debut. Hands down one of the best chicken parm dishes I have ever had. It was even better than any restaurant in the North End and it was less expensive. The chicken was so tender and the breading was perfect. The cannoli and coffee were both amazing. Ambiance was also awesome. It felt very homey (real wood fire, Italian touches, etc) yet stayed with the modern industrial Boston scene (high ceilings, brick, metals, etc). Overall, a great first experience. Will definitely be back."},{"name":"Hanako Japanese Restaurant","address":"15135 101 Avenue","city":"Surrey","stars":"4","text":"I am revising my last review and giving this place two more starts because I tried it again and it won me over. The service was better (we were the only people in there so I guess it kind of had to be). But O.M.G. This place is so amazing. It is unassuming - it's in a little strip mall set back from the street on 152. It doesn't look like much even when you get inside. The decor is simple and stark. It is pretty pricey compared to other sushi you can get in the area. But the food is so good, it completely blows away every other sushi place in the area. They have things on this menu that you don't even know what they are. I challenge you to, just this once, forsake the generic rolls you always get and order something you've never tried before- you won't be disappointed. The Salmon Battera (pressed salmon sushi) is so fresh, light and delicious I now have to order it every time I come. This time we tried the stuffed baked oysters on the lunch menu, and they were heavenly. They are made with egg yolk and lemon- kind of a Japanese-Benedict style oyster if you can imagine that. I wish we ordered more of them. We will be back - very soon!
