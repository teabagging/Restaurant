We sat at the bar. It's a lively little restaurant and I think it was designed to truly make you feel like you're dining at someplace in Thailand. \\n\\nThe bartender chatted with us and was nothing but friendly and great. We decided to go with the famous wings (of course) and we also got a catfish noodle dish, that I'm sure the name of was far too much for me to recall. Well aside from that it was super delicious. There were crispy yet very fresh and tender pieces of catfish atop a salad of rice noodles, lettuce, mint, peanuts, and a couple of herbs I don't think I've had before. I'm sure that in the sauce/dressing there was fish sauce, lime juice, curry. It was a bombass flavor combo and was a lovely dish.  I definitely could have eaten more of that. It was just very refreshing and very bright. \\n\\nThe wings were pretty good- we ordered them spicy but they weren't really spicy. They were more savory. Full of fish saucy/garlicky flavor. I WISH they would have been spicier as I could have handled it and almost wished for it in every bite. They are good wings, but I think if I could go back I would have opted to try another dish instead. \\n\\nIf I find myself in Portland again, I would most definitely return. Living in Denver where there is such a lack of food diversity and culture, I definitely admire establishments like this.

The beef cheek was more of a short rib, but was served in a tasty sauce. The statler chicken was a generous portion, but barely any polenta on the side. This disch could have used a vegetable in it to vary the texture and flavor. Lastly, ordered the mascarpone beignets and the flourless chocolate torte. Beignets were pretty good, but the flourless torte was surprising. We were expecting more of a cake, but the tort came out in a skinny rod form and had rasberry cream on top; a dollop of caramel ice cream came on the side.

It really ticked me off how rude she was. I got an Uber and went to Ray's in the city and we had a excellent dinner there.

I work in the customer service industry and you do not talk to patrons the way this girl felt that it was acceptable to.

I'm a sucker for potatoes but in the same breath am very picky and particular. These were fried but not drenched in oil; first plus. They were also just the right thickness so you weren't chewing for days to finish one chip. That also made them more on the crispy side which we both really like.

Our server, though friendly enough, nearly forgot we were there as he focused all his attention on a larger party. The menu had more pork dishes than anything else.  Definitely not enough variety for those that don't eat pig.  Maybe pork is a staple in Northern Thailand, but in Portland it would be nice to see more seafood and vegetarian dishes on the menu. The few choices we were left with just weren't that good.   Small portions and large prices. They charge for steamed rice.  Really?!  And for soda refills. Are you kidding me? Our rice noodle/catfish dish was overcooked and oily, and the lemongrass stuffed cornish hen was flavorless.  We left disappointed and probably won't be back.

Even the simplest recipes are bursting with flavor, tickling my tastebuds in ways that aren't safe to describe on yelp.\\n\\nThis place is bursting authenticity not just in the awesome quality of the food, but in the service and atmosphere. For some reason Italian restaurants in America have become the de-facto fancy restaurants. Do people in Italy only eat in fancy restaurants? This place is authentic.

The presentation of the drinks actually looked better than how it tasted. I've had better. The main reason why we will not be returning is due to the discourteous service we received and the inappropriate presentation of a hickey displayed on one of the staff's neck. While this young lady unhappily put in our orders, her love mark was prominent and just caught our eyes. Miss, if you are servicing in a family friendly-children ambiance, please leave your love marks at home! The staff did not smile and looked saddened the whole time we were there. There were no display of friendly customer service hospitality. When I questioned them why the milk tea bulb was not filled to the top like the peach flavor bulb, they looked at each other with a sense of smirk on their faces and replied, \\"because that's how it's supposed to be.\\" With so many other Boba tea competitors blooming around the city, it's disappointing to know their service was not up to par.

We ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza, some beer and a salad.  The restaurant was not busy.  We were not really in a hurry but we eventually came to realize more than an hour had passed since we placed our order.\\n\\nWhen I inquired about the status of our order it was determined by the employee I asked that she had cooked the pizza and it had mysteriously vanished.

Only when we had left did I realize all they gave my girlfriend was $27 cash for the beer, salad and sodas.  THEY DID NOT REFUND THE $20 GIFT CERTIFICATE OR EVEN GIVE IT BACK TO HER!  They seemed to be much more concerned with establishing who among them was at fault then with dealing with the situation at hand.\\n\\nI'm disappointed I never got to try their pizza, which I've heard for years is very good.

The authentic food is the best, but even the American Chinese dishes (e.g., sesame chicken) are really great.  Their fried rice is top quality when compared to the average standalone Chinese restaurant -- which for the most part, you have to add salt or put your entree's juices onto the rice to give it any flavor.  We usually get the combination rice or shrimp fried rice.  Both are great, depending on your mood.   Also, the best part of our meal is always the shrimp wonton soup.  Probably the best shrimp wonton soup I've had in a restaurant in America.  There's actual flavorful meat in it -- usually there's no meat, or hardly any, or the wontons have been stewing so long they're falling apart.

When we told her we had not ordered wine, she looked dumbfounded at us and said she was told we had.  She then realized she should have taken it to the table next to us.  I cannot understand why she would not have seated the reservation at the table she seated us at.  It was an identical table five feet away.  What a way to correct error on the restaurant's part!\\nWe decided to just order an entree and leave.  We were done by 7:00 PM, but it took another half hour to get and pay our bill.\\nThe food was pretty good and reasonably priced.  Usually, good food with poor service would get 3 or maybe 4 stars, but this is absolutely no way to treat customers."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"What isn't there to love about a city of books?

Their bowls are satisfying, unique, and wholesome.

It seems no matter what time of day, the lines are incredibly long, but usually move reasonably quickly. My biggest complaint is when dining in the food always arrives at the table well before any drinks or smoothies. I've been nearly done with a meal before receiving my beverage, which is disappointing. I know there's likely a higher volume of drinks to be made than meals, so I understand their challenge.

Man the oysters of course are always incredible.  The decor is very cool, hip aesthetic with a bar in the middle, whites and grays for the decor which makes the place \\"pretty\\".  Service has always been excellent.  The food is prepared with much detail and they can repeat excellent dishes without variance.  Always great.\\n\\nMust order dishes:\\n1.  Fluke Crudo is outstanding\\n2.  No shell mussels are also outstanding, you miss the presentation of the bowl of shells but it's very convienant... I'd compare it to pistachio's that are shelled, makes it easy to cram down a bunch but you do lose a little of the entertainment of shelling them.\\n3.  THE KING AND MUST ORDER....Cripsy Oyster slider... even if you do not like oysters try this as several people I know had it even though they do not like oysters.  This is the signature dish on the menu.\\n\\nThe crab cake is solid along with the fried clams, just not to the same decadent level as the 3 items listed.  I hit a little bar in Newberry that had clams that were as good but much larger order and a much smaller price.  These are good but I think you are over paying.  Lobster roll is solid as well.  Neptune's is better but this is a solid choice.  Didn't try any of the \\"Land\\" items.\\n\\nThe fish selection is always excellent and changes on a regular basis.  Personally next time I go back I may just make a dinner of the above three items.\\n\\nI chow down on Island Creeks back in Chicago at Shaw's and the Island Creek guys take care of my buddy in Cleveland who has won the national oyster eating contest a couple of times (Jon).

Our reserved table was ready the moment we arrived. Upon entering, I was a little taken aback by the very noisy after-work bar crowd. It was tough just making our way through that mob as we followed the hostess to our table. But once you're past the bar area, the din dies down considerably...the place must be designed to absorb the noise. The dining area is spacious, not crowded at all like the bar.\\n\\nFrom the raw bar, we ordered 12 oysters (3 each of 4 different varieties), and 4 littleneck clams. No sense in mentioning the varieties of oysters, because what they serve changes every day...all you need to know is that they were AWESOME. All varieties were huge! They serve them still swimming in briny saltwater, it tastes like someone just picked it out of the ocean, shucked it, and handed it to you. The cocktail sauce they came with was way too mild and \\"ketchupy\\" for my taste, but that's okay because we got a generous portion of horseradish, too (and an impressive selection of various hot sauces). I tried a few without any condiments at all, and I'm glad I did. The littlenecks were kinda so-so...the raw bar prices are very reasonable so we got our money's worth on the clams, but they were disappointing compared to the oysters. Frankly, I would have appreciated it if they'd simply told us, \\"the clams our distributor had today weren't up to our standards, so they're not available today,\\" rather than giving us what we wanted when it was slightly mediocre. But don't misunderstand, the clams weren't terrible...just not up to the standards this place seems to set.\\n\\nThe entrees were delicious, but a bit small. She had the seared sea scallops (always a favorite dish for her) and I had striped bass. She only got 5 scallops on her plate! That was a little disappointing (there wasn't even much veggies or starch to fill the plate), but we both agreed they were the most delicious scallops we'd ever tasted. They were so creamy and delicate, they really felt like they melt in your mouth. My striper was a little more filling, and just as delicious. I don't usually care for eating the skin, but this place does something magical to it where the skin comes out all flaky and crispy...I could eat it every day for a week (if I could afford it!).\\n\\nTake my advice: fill up on raw bar. If you only get entrees, you're going to be hungry after. And while the entrees are very expensive, the raw bar isn't so that's a good way to round out the meal.\\n\\nWe split a chocolate tort for dessert (excellent) and I had some coffee that was fantastic. It's hard to find a good cup of coffee in this town (even at fancy restaurants) because most New Englanders prefer under-roasted watery drek like they serve at Dunkin'. But this place has coffee you can actually TASTE.\\n\\nThe decor was nice...they have an entire wall that's basically just piles of oyster shells. It's not too dark, so you can actually see your food. It's the kind of place where you can class it up if you want to (I wore a sports jacket), or go casual before a Red Sox game (guy at the next table had a t-shirt), and nobody looks out of place or over- or under-dressed."},{"name":"Mumtaz Curry & Kababs","address":"16755 SW Baseline Rd, Ste 102","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Super delicious biryani!

The Brushfire is how I got hooked on Torchy's a few years back when (I believe) the only 2 were both on South 1st Street. I like a taco that has some bite to it. What I mean by that, is, when I bite into a taco, I like for it to bite back. And the Brushfire does just that. I love the slow Jerk Jamaican burn. It doesn't start out hot but when you take that 1st bite, it makes you go, \\"mmm, that's goood\\", and then you sort've \\"ease\\" on in to the heat and the heat slowly increases as you go along, and by the time you're finished with it, you got a real nice slow burn going on in your mouth, that's not overwhelming or overpowering but just enough heat that you can really taste and enjoy the flavor that lingers long after the last bite."},{"name":"Zed's","address":"501 Canyon Ridge Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The restaurant looks really nice.

I expected a lot but it wasn't all that people had raved about. We wanted too order some Pad Thai, but our server said it was only available for dinner time which is odd because most restaurants would've accommodated off the menu dishes even if its at a different meal time. I ordered the Tamarind whiskey Sour and it was ok and nothing spectacular as expected. It tasted just like a Whiskey Sour should taste but with a slightly different taste and I'm guessing its the Tamarind, but it didn't taste like tamarind to me. Being Filipino I know the taste of tamarind as our country has tamarind candy and a tamarind sour soup called siningang and it didn't taste like tamarind. My God Son asked for a refill for his soda and our server informed us they do not have free refills which blew my mind because most, if not all restaurants have free refills especially at $2-$3.

We try to get his attention, and by this point my boyfriend is fed up with how things are going, so he gets up and goes to the counter to ask if we can get 2 glasses of water.

That's why even though they're small mistakes, the fact that I've experienced these small mistakes so many times is frustrating, especially from a chain such as chick fil a.

Our server was prompt and thorough, explaining all of the choices and then reappearing with my wife's wine choice. The choice of wines was extensive and price points were excellent. I, on the other hand, was limited by a Doctors order of \\"no alcohol\\". When I asked if they had a non-alcohol\\" beer they said \\"no\\". Oh well, this is a Italian restaurant.\\n\\nWe searched the menu, and found some great options. We ordered the antipasto appetizer: it was awesome. We we ordered our main courses; I ordered the Linguine alle Vongole, and the Boss ordered the Papadelle allle Cinghaile. The prices seemed quite fair.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting, my wife saw me squirming in my chair, and asked: \\"What's wrong\\"?  I said \\" this is the most uncomfortable chair that I have ever sat in, in a restaurant!\\". I called it a a \\"clown chair\\"; way too short, and too small for an adult. My wife (who is a lot smaller than me) remarked \\" I agree; it IS small and uncomfortable.\\"\\n\\nOur main courses arrived. I took one bite of mine and noted that the pasta was cooked perfectly. My wife said the same about hers. So many pasta places overcook their pasta; but this was perfect. But ....then we noticed that the sauces were not up too par. Mine was waaaaay too salty. When you add clams to any pasta dish it is important to thoroughly rinse or soak them; this had not been done to my meal. Consequently the salt overwhelmed the awesome pasta. My wife was even more upset. She said her sauce tasted exactly like her teenage memory of a Chef Boy-ar-dee meal. I tasted it, and agreed. \\n\\nWe had been expecting a romantic Italian dinner, but we were pressed together like sardines in a noisy restaurant with lousy chairs, and food that was not up-to-par.. My wife could not handle sitting in her chair any longer. She asked me to pay the bill, and we left before she could finish her wine. There are much better Italian restaurants in our city; ones  that know how to cook a great meal, and treat their customers to a relaxing and enjoyable experience."},{"name":"Weather Up","address":"1808 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I came to weather up on a Monday and was a little disappointed because I found out after my second drink that they don't serve food on Monday (the kitchen was closed.) it made for a very drunk me.

So I'll write this review for the sake of my future self.\\n\\nI wish I'd done that after I ate there 10 years ago. I found myself on the patio again today, trying to recall what I'd eaten back then and whether or not I liked it. I think it was something cajun? Etoufee? Shrimp and grits? Hmmm...\\n\\nAnyway, there I was, up pretty early on a Sunday. But not early enough to avoid a 40-minute wait. What? Yeah, and we got there at around 9:40. I think the wait would have been shorter if the hostess had written that we were a party of two (which is what I told them we were). When it was finally time to be seated she asked where the rest of my party were. \\n\\nSmall misunderstanding. They were accommodating in finding us a table outside after we realized that the indoor air conditioning would make my wife's breasts do amazing things that she for some reason didn't want them to do.\\n\\nSo we started eating. I can't eat a lot at once without feeling gross, so buffets are not my favorite way to dine. But that's just me. But once I'm in the game I play to win. If you're not filling your plate at least five times and leaving with severe stomach cramps, you can't hold your head high, right?\\n\\nThis brunch deal is about $18 per person but doesn't come with anything to drink... I had to pay extra for my coffee while I was waiting for a table; not sure if it would have been included if I'd ordered it at our table. Mimosas and bloody marys are $4. Since tomato juice tastes like vomit, I got a mimosa and was very happy with it.\\n\\nThere are several buffet stations. One of them had a pretty long line at one point (maybe 30 people) and took over 10 minutes to get through. Which may not sound so bad until you realize that half of the things you want are at another station, so you have to go get at the end of THAT line and wait another 10 minutes to fill up the other half of your plate (while the items you got in the first line get cold).\\n\\nSo how about the food? Our waiter was correct in saying the King Ranch casserole and broccoli rice casserole were standouts. But the maple ham, the tiny buttermilk biscuits, and the cornflake-crusted chicken tenders were great. \\n\\nDouble up on the green chile cheese grits. I'm gonna disagree with Keri B this one time ... I'm a Mississippi boy, so I don't accept shit grits. These I could eat with a spoon in each hand. Damn.\\n\\nThe bread pudding was great, but I tried to stay away from all those breads. It's a buffet, you know, and those carbs will sink your ship real quick. \\n\\nThere were little bagels and granola and pancakes. Of course I had none of that (see my sunken ship analogy above). The kolaches were disappointing (and that's something you won't hear me say often). Though the bread around the sausage was good, the meat was a cheap little sausage without much flavor. \\n\\nStay away from the deviled eggs. I've never met a deviled egg I didn't love until I met these. Dry and flavorless filling.

Yogurt (although there was an odd poppyseed yogurt sauce to drizzle over the fresh fruit).\\n\\nMan. I'm making this sound disappointing. Did I mention that everything was $18? It's really a fine brunch. Just get there before 9:30 on a Sunday if you don't want to wait.

The Parlor and Phara's are closed.  Salons and vintage stores are of no use.  So even a blue vegan cart that's only open Thu-Sun can bring some local anticipation and excitement to a non-vegan like myself.    \\n\\nWe tried two sandwiches.  The 'Philly Seitan' - which is seitan, cashew cheeze (sic), onions and peppers - didn't transport me back to Philly....unless, by that, you mean the biblical middle-eastern Philistine as the cashew cheeze tasted more like hummus than cheese.  The seitan texture was fine but it isn't reminiscent of any meat I've ever had.  That said, I was fairly satisifed with the sandwich.  Just more falafely than Philly.\\n\\nThe BBQ Jackfruit sandwich rates slightly better than the Philly Seitan.  It's not going to swear a carnivore off pulled pork or brisket but it could do in a (or if your pants) pinch.  Other note - the sauce has this weird tang I seem to taste in many vegan BBQ attempts that reminds me of McRib sandwiches for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe caesar salad w/ kale and carrots was solid.

The kale was a nice alternative to the same ol' romaine. \\n\\nThe sesame quinoa salad w/ mango is a better source of protein than satisfaction.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a cart that I can see vegans raving about (see some of the other reviews) but isn't much more than an emergency fix for anyone else."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Be ready to spend some serious money on a sandwich! yes, it's pretty expensive, but the sandiwich is the size of my head and has some serious flavors.

Unlike some other reviews though, my complaint was in no way with the service, as my waiter was very good. I thought the food desperately lacked flavor, and from a former chef at Le Bernadin this was a surprising deficiency to me.\\n\\nI really loved the atmosphere (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4179881165/in/set-72157622864759653/) of Bistro du Midi, especially where I was dining, just next to the fireplace (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4179882501/in/set-72157622864759653/) and with a decent view of the park below at night. I can imagine this is a stunning scene in the summer months when there is still some daylight to be had at dinner hours. My biggest complaint with the layout of the restaurant is that they failed to put a bathroom upstairs, so if you want to go wash your hands you have to go back downstairs and navigate through the bar area and the giant wine tower (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4180644776/in/set-72157622864759653/) just to do so. As I noted earlier, service was great for me, but I was somewhat surprised by how little clothing the Sommelier was wearing. It looked almost like lingerie masquerading as a dress.\\n\\nAfter an interesting presentation of bread (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4179881467/in/set-72157622864759653/), I began the meal with the trio of barbajans (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4180643112/in/set-72157622864759653/), as I definitely live by the creed that frying things makes them taste better, and the assortment of fillings sounded quite tasty: goats' cheese and honey, lamb and tomato, and pumpkin (which I suppose is the seasonal rotating one). I would say that while none of them really struck me as impressive, that overall they were good, and a relatively inexpensive first taste of the cuisine here.\\n\\nThe ingredient list for the pissaladi√®re (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4179882193/in/set-72157622864759653/) hooked me right away, even though I had no idea what this strange sounding item was. Apparently it's a type of pizza which is common in Southern France, especially around Nice, and the main ingredient is always anchovies, and traditionally also includes caramelized or sauteed onions and olives, all of which were featured in this version. My biggest complaint here was that the pizza was not cooked all the way through, so the crust was not firm, and considering it's coated with onion paste it caused it to be really flimsy and droopy. Also, the amount of anchovy that was included was so minimal the flavor was hardly there, and that should be the main focus of the dish in my opinion. As a result all the flavors wound up being pretty muted and were horribly imbalanced.\\n\\nThe highlight of the night for me was definitely the saffron chitarra & seafood dish, featuring mussels, clams, and calamari. The saffron is actually worked into the chitarra pasta (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4179882665/in/set-72157622864759653/) so the flavor abounds with each bite, one of the few times I was able to say that during this meal. The amount of seafood included in the dish was also quite generous, so you got some in basically every bite. Unfortunately I decided to also order a side of ratatouille Proven√ßale (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4180644204/in/set-72157622864759653/), just because this should be the hallmark of a good Southern French restaurant, but it was a terrible disappointment. Although the presentation was rather cute, in its own little cast iron skillet, the herbal flavors and melange of robust vegetable flavors were both absent, causing the dish to taste very generic and unimpressive.\\n\\nI see no reason why this restaurant can't become one of the better ones in Boston, the foundation is mostly there, they just really need to work on improving some of the fundamental things that make great restaurants stand out from good ones."},{"name":"Cup & Saucer Cafe","address":"3746 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"Worst service ever in Portland.

So, my wife was somewhere (I don't remember), but I figured I'd try it since it's probably not her cup of tea.\\n\\nSo, let's start with the fact that it's weird.  Literally never have seen chili served on spaghetti.  I wasn't starving, but I wanted to try their full wares, so I settled on the smallest portion of 3-Way (spaghetti, chili, cheese), and a Cheese Coney.  First off, I think I ate about a block of cheese with those two items.  Seriously, they must keep some dairy distributor VERY happy with the amount of cheese they put on their food.\\n\\nThat being said, it was really good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the odd combo of the chili/cheese/spaghetti.  Not something I would've EVER come up with on my own (and I experiment; I once ate an entire loaf of fresh french bread with a jar of Tostito's Salsa con Queso).  The thing that really got me about it was the chili; it has this sweetness and other flavor to it (I think it might be cinnamon or nutmeg or something), and it just somehow works with the cheddar and other flavors.  The Cheese Coney was also good, and really worth a try; nothing amazing, but just good.\\n\\nReally, at minimum, it's worth the experience, especially if you're not from around this area.

Here for a conference, brought the family along for a vacation.  Reserved two rooms; one for my husband and 12 year old, the other for my daughter, son-in-law and 18 month old granddaughter.  Beautiful hotel!  The pools and lazy river are incredible!  We were here over Labor Day weekend and they had many activities available for the kids.  The water was the perfect temperature.  The grounds are beautiful and we enjoyed evening walks.\\n\\nThe conference provided a continental breakfast and snacks, which were okay, nothing special.  \\n\\nThere are restaurants onsite, but they are extremely expensive.  We had dinner at the Citrion.  Wonderful staff and service.  Way over-priced!  Fortunately our son-in-law rented a minivan, so we found other dining options in the city.  A large dinner for five adults with appetizers and drinks at Hard Rock Cafe was less expensive than 2 burgers, a kids meal and soup at the Citrion.\\n\\nThe staff is extremely kind and polite.  We used the concierge service to get tickets to Universal Studios.  They are less expensive if you book online.  You can use the shuttle service to the parks, but be warned that they need a minimum of 1 hours notice to book you on a shuttle.  They have scheduled pick up times to and from the park.\\n\\nThe negatives:  We were given incorrect information by the Marriott reservation staff. When we booked, we asked for a refrigerator in both rooms.  You have to ask again at the desk upon check in, and they had one available at the time.  They sent may daughter's up the following day, but we shouldn't have had to remind them and ask twice, since we made arrangements ahead of time.  We received the beds we requested, two doubles for us and a king for my daughter, so we were pleased with that. My daughter called a couple of days before to request a microwave in each room.  She was assured that would be noted and that we should remind the desk at check-in.  We get to the desk and are informed that \\"they do not have microwaves at this hotel\\".  Would have been good to know when she called, before we bought frozen meals on the way from the airport.  They need to learn to communicate with the Marriott phone staff.\\n\\nWhen I booked both rooms, I specifically stated that my room would be charged to my employer's credit card and my daughter's to mine.  I was told at booking that would be fine.  So my daughter arrives first, and they will not accept my card as payment until I am physically there to sign.  My daughter has to pay for one night on her card, which was a debit, so she had to make some transfers to cover that cost.  That should have been communicated prior to arrival, when I booked the room.\\n\\nSame problem with my reservation.  When I arrived, with a copy of two cards from my employer, one of which was used upon booking, I was told I could not use either since my name was not on the card.  I understand the need for security, but again this should have been communicated prior to my arrival.  They provided a third party billing authorization form that I could fax to my employer.  Great!  Tried faxing from the Fed Ex onsite....fax would not go through.  Others had the same problem, so it had to be on the Fed Ex end.  Was able to scan the document and send through Fed Ex.  There were some technical glitches, so that process took 40 minutes and cost $12....just to send this stupid form!  My employer receives it, confirms by email and assures me that she will fax it back immediately, that afternoon, California time.  Emails me a copy of the completed form, with the quoted group room rate.  Two days later I check at the front desk to ensure the room was being billed to the third party card, and I am told that my employer had an issue with the room rate and they were awaiting a second fax from her with confirmation.  This stumps me, so I email my boss, who emails back that the HOTEL staff would not confirm the rate, or fill out the tax rate on the form.  She was able to get someone from Marriott on the phone to confirm the quoted group rate and a total tax cost.  She then faxed back another completed form.  The front desk assured me they never received the second form.  By then both my boss and I are throughly convinced that administrative staff at the front desk cannot complete the simplest tasks without alot of handholding.  Finally, my boss has to go into the office, on a Saturday of a holiday weekend, and get the hotel staff on the phone, to ensure they receive the documents and will bill as agreed upon at booking. This process took 4 days!!!!!  So frustrating!\\n\\nSo.....in short...beautiful grounds, the lazy river is amazing.  The rooms are okay, above average.  The separate shower is the best part.  The food is outrageous and other than cereal and cup of noodles, it is difficult to offset the high cost of meals at the resort.

My partner had roast chicken (with veggies and brown rice) and enjoyed it very much as well. I am excited to come back and try the various salads, burgers, and other fare.\\n- The value is great! We got tons of food and drink for quite cheap and with a lot of enjoyment.\\n- They cushioned seats along the windows (the windows also have really cool coverings that make for good atmosphere) \\n\\nThings that they are [hopefully] working on:\\n- The customer service flow hasn't found it's groove yet.

I guess Vancitybuzz didn't over-expose this place like others... no matter, when she looked at the menu it was handwritten on a piece of paper and eventually ordered the chicken, $17 for an order, steep from what I was thinking, but maybe it's due to the high rent of Yaletown, eventually the food came to me not too long after.\\n\\nYour stereotypical styrofoam sectional box packed with the food that this place made for us, it had hefty weight, that is before seeing the prize inside. When we opened this box in my car, 4 small quater pieces of pita over a small container of hummus, a small serving of Greek salad, and the main portion, two big long skewers of chicken over a bed of lemon pilaf. Everything looked right, except one interesting thing was the salad, where I'm used to seeing the feta cheese broken up, and spread out amongst the greens, this was in one block, and then we dug in.\\n\\nStarting with the pita, nothing really special about these, but the hummus was smooth, the texture wasn't as grainy as the stuff I had at other places, a good balance of flavour kept me always trying to cover up my pita bits. I then moved on toward the salad, and interesting how they actually took care on cutting the cucumbers in a swirl, very thin, not the big crunchy chunks I'm used to at other places, well olive oil'd... and eating a bit of salad, and being able to pick at the feta, the amount you wanted to intake in each bite actually worked.\\n\\nFinally we arrive at the main course, meaty sticks of chicken nicely grilled with some blacking, more on some pieces than others yet the all the meat chunks were moist, no dry bits here... and amazingly enough, the rice had such a good lemon zest taste it made me come back for more, each grain or rice, nice plump, with bite, and only after I finished eating the meal did I realize I didn't even use the tzatziki sauce????

The chef of Pok Pok, Andy Ricker, won the James Beard Award for Best Chef: Northwest in 2011 and this place also appeared in an episode of \\"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\\". The Oregonian also named Pok Pok \\"Restaurant of the Year 2007\\" (http://www.oregonlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2009/06/restaurant_of_the_year_2007_po.html). Later I learned that Pok Pok currently have two additional locations - one in Los Angeles Chinatown (October 2015) and one in Brooklyn, New York (December 2013).\\n\\nI came here really early (like 5:15 PM) because I heard this place is always busy. And guess what? The restaurant started to reach the full capacity by the time I got here! Luckily, I didn't have to wait at all because there was an available bar seat (can serve up to 5~6 customers at a time).\\n\\nMost of Pok Pok's dishes are meant to be shared (or family-style), but there are some single-serving entrees like noodle soups (e.g. Khao Soi) that you can still enjoy all by yourself. The meal started with a small sample of spicy peanut and somehow I really liked my cup of iced water. The staff was pretty attentive.\\n\\n***\\n \\nKhao Soi (Beef, $15.50):  The coconut milk & curry broth had slightly sweet and savory aftertaste. Since pickled mustard greens, shallots, and chili come separately with the noodle bowl, you can add as much or as little of ingredients as you want. I highly recommend this noddle soup. (5/5)\\n\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (Pok Pok's signature dish, 6 whole chicken wings, spicy - $15.50): Excellent and very refreshing fermented vegetables (cabbage, carrot, and cucumber). Wings weren't as spicy as I thought and fish sauce was pretty good. However, saltiness began to build up and I had to peel chicken skin by the time I got to the 4th piece. Wing quality was great - juicy and tender chicken meat. (4.25/5)\\n\\nDrinking Vinegar (apple flavor, $5): Literally half of my drink was filled with ice; tasted like a Fanta Apple Soda.

One was like a squash gnocchi which was delicious, and the other dish had sunchoke in it which was tasty and refreshing. \\n\\nWe also ordered the \\"Slow Roasted Bison Ribs, Spicy Tomato Glaze, Charred Green Onion\\" ($20) which was the most expensive thing on the menu.  It was good and off-the-bone tender but I thought it was overpriced compared to the rest of the items on the menu, which were more unique.   \\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was dessert.  My boyfriend and I love apple crumble / apple pie so naturally we ordered the \\"Salted Caramel Apple Crisp, Bitter Almond Yogurt\\".  (He was so excited about the dessert, he wanted to order one each so we didn't have to share.)  The wait for the dessert was at least half an hour (which is fine, we assumed they were making it from scratch which is fine with us) and when it came we were drooling over how hot and fresh and delicious it looked.  The small scoop of vanilla ice cream scoop was deliciously creamy.  But then we got to the actual apple crumble and it was salty. Like WAY too salty.  Every time I chewed down on a soft, warm, apple piece, the after taste was salt.  We must have had three re-fills of water each while eating this dessert.    This was the first time in my history of eating apple crumble/pie/crisp for dessert that was did not finish it.  I really really hope this isn't what the apple crumble is supposed to taste like, and I hope we were just served a one-off bad batch.

All the people sitting in my area immediately became cold (it was only 8 degrees out there after all). I asked if the door could be closed and she replied that the kitchen had no ventilation and the kitchen staff were hot. Now I'm sympathetic to the kitchen staff in this scenario - but maybe they should get some kind of ventilation system in the kitchen?! Anyway, she said she would leave it for a few minutes and then close it again. As she walked away the guy at the table next to us asked if the door could be closed (he must not have heard us talking about it). She said to him 'You're cold as well. Fuck, fine', then proceeded to roll her eyes as she closed the door. So incredibly rude.\\n\\n- We had a groupon to pay the bill. We were told that we couldn't use the groupon as groupon had made a mistake on the terms and conditions and it was meant to say it was only valid after 4pm. We showed her the groupon, and how it did not say that, and we were entitled to redeem it now. She went on to give us this big long story about how she'll get into trouble with her boss if she puts it through before 4pm, etc etc. Frankly I don't care about any of that, the terms say I can use it whenever I want and I wanted to use it then. They should take the issue up with groupon, not with the customer. She FINALLY put it through with the groupon, however not after telling me many times about how she was going to get into trouble with the boss. Ordinarily, if I liked the place and the servers were personable, I would have been more than happy to pay the full price and come back another time with the groupon.

He just seems like a stand-up dude that loves food and makes questionable fashion choices but at least he stands by them. So on my recent visit to Portland I decided to check out some of the places that he's been to in town. This is how I ended up going to Arleta library bakery cafe. This cute little south east Portland stop was definitely worth the trip over the river. The staff was super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. My friend and I started out with the special coffee cake of the day (rhubarb) and coffee which was made in a French press and was bottomless at the price of $3. My only trouble here was picking out what I actually wanted to eat because everything sounded so delicious. I went with \\"Portland's Best Biscuits and Gravy\\" and was not disappointed with my choice. The dish came with 2 sweet potato biscuits which had a great level of moisture (sometimes I feel that biscuits can be way too dry), rosemary pork sausage gravy (this was a dreamy thick gravy with huge chunks of sausage that covered my plate!), and strips of pork loin over the biscuits and their house potatoes. We also got some homemade ketchup to eat with the potatoes which inspired my friend and I to try and make our own. The meal was delicious and a lot of food! I heard the waiter say to another patron that you could half an order which might be a good idea if you aren't absolutely starving.

While the sauce and favor is really unique and tasty, the wings were over fried.  Is it to get the wings extra crispy so the skin won't get soggy when mixing in with the sauce?   or we just ran in a busy night and kitchen doesn't' have a timer when flying the wings?! anyhow, the left over wings tasted kind of like the\\" best ever chicken jerky.\\"   we ended up eating them all at our hotel room. \\n\\n- Muu Paa Kham Waan (Boar Collar Meat) $12\\nthis is my favorite.  it served with ice cold mustard green.  odd right... they literally put crush ice on top of mustard green to keep it crispy, best fresh mustard green!     \\n\\nI know the mustard green is not the star but it went so well with the boar collar meat and the sauce.  the meat was so juicy and tender, and the sauce is soooo good.  i used the left over sauce to mix with mustard greens and coconut rice, yummy.  i cleaned the whole plate almost all by myself.  \\n\\n- Khao Soi Kai (Curry Noodle Soup) $12 \\nI like this curry creamy soup although the flat wheat noodle got soggy.  If they changed to skinny rice noodle, it would be perfect.  rice noodles can  soak up the flavor much better and it is what they serve in Bangkok mostly.\\n\\nthe condiments were a great addition to the already tasty soup, but please cut the pickled mustard in a thinner slice, a little goes long way.  however, I might not being fair since I am compare it to the Chinese version of \\"Pork & Pickled mustard noodle soup.\\"  maybe the pickle is meant to eaten in big chunk in Thailand?\\n\\n- Mango Sticky Rice $7\\nthis is the dish that my bf and I can't agree on.   you see, for the 2 weeks while i was at Bangkok, I went to get \\"mango Sticky Rice\\" and \\"papaya salad\\" form different street vendors, restaurants, mall vendors, so i could get a feeling of what a good local mango sticky rice and papaya salad should be.   \\n\\nnote: In Thailand, they are mostly still farming in a old-school way (organic), and fruits are picked when they are supposed to (tree ripe). In the US, it's become the norm to pick fruits way ahead.  although some fruit will continue ripping after being picked.  some won't! and those fruit can't never grow into their full potential, really sadden me.. what a waste!\\n\\nthe mango you get anywhere from Thailand are rank from great to OMG by US standards!  \\n\\nso i would have to say, the mango at pok pok is better then what we have been getting at bay area, they are ripe though a bit mushy, but full of mango favor. \\n\\nhowever, the sticky rice is over cooked, mushy.  the balance of sweet and salt of sticky rice was drowned by the \\"cream/ sauce.\\"\\n\\nnote: when sticky rice (or other type of rice in general) is cooked right, they are a star by itself.  I guess because I am a Taiwanese and the first thing I've learned to cook is Rice!  I take this subject seriously.\\n\\nwhile my bf love the dessert and this is the only dish we can't see eye to eye...  but i guess he made a very good point when he asked me, \\"does it taste good?\\" \\n\\nme: \\"yes, it taste good! BUT that's not how mango sticky should be! \\" \\nhe: \\" who care!  as long as it taste good!\\" \\nme: ' ahhh... i guess, but it almost tasted like a mango rice pudding...\\" \\n \\nfine, I will rest my case for now.. \\n\\n- coconut rice $2.5\\nbest coconut rice i ever have.  smell nutty and taste a bit creamy at the same time.  \\n\\n- Water, FREE\\ntheir water taste better then most of the water I have to pay for it.  Oregon is blessed with quality nature water out from the pipe!  tap water never tasted so good at home.  I don't remember the last time I drank so much water at once.  \\n\\n* Pok Pok flavored their tap water with: \\n\\"Pandanus leaf, as is done often in Northern Thailand, which gives it that toasted rice/vanilla/grassy flavor.\\"  \\n\\nI wish they have more 2 bathrooms for their busy restaurant and Double please NOT to clean up the dish literally 2 inch right by the bathroom door.  it is not appetizing being forced to watch them clean up the dish while you waiting. \\n\\noverall, this is worth the visit.

The catfish was lightly fried and placed on top of a stew, very flavorful. The pork belly and french toast seems to pair off really well together. No idea why I even doubted it. Pork belly goes with everything! The tagliatelle pasta tasted freshly made and the light cream sauce enhanced the homemade noodle's texture. The salmon was done perfectly over a peach salad. The waiter informed us that they get the salmon from Alaska flown in on Tuesday so its super fresh. The catfish was caught in GA. Only con I have is the portions. I don't eat a lot, but the dishes were on the small size even to me. We ended up getting a giant ice cream elsewhere to be truly satisfied.

We had to wait an hour for our table which was expected so we had an upside down dinner, and went to Salt N' Straw across the street so was there was no concern of not having enough room for desert. This worked out perfect as by the time we were done standing in line there a table was ready. Our server greeted us fairly shortly after we were sat, but only took three of our drink orders. He later returned and took the remaining parties drink orders. The half of the party that ordered later got their drinks but they forget the other 3 people in the parties drinks. Then after taking everyone's order, one of the girls in our group got her food fairly quickly while the rest of us stared and salivated at her food, while it took another 30 minutes for the rest of the dishes to arrive. \\n\\nThen the icing on the cake, was I told our server that I did not eat meat, and he said it was not a problem to make it without. Upon digging into my dish I discovered it was covered in meat. The server and a manager did apologize for all the problems.

Just when we thought our dinner was going to get turnaround, it was then obvious that the manager did not communicate to the server he was going to take care of desert for us.

Although we can't comment too much on the authenticity of the food, our experience was spoiled by several factors:\\n\\n1. We asked for a bottled beer (the Full Sail lager from Mt. Hood), and when it was brought to us we noticed it had expired almost two months ago. We demanded for another one in exchange and were brought another one, but it was not a good start for us.\\n\\n2. The duck leg stew we ordered supposedly came with a duck egg, but we are pretty certain that the one we had was a regular chicken egg, and it was pretty bland and tasteless to boot.\\n\\n3. This isn't a major thing as this happens everywhere, but the serving sizes are a bit on the small size for the money. \\n\\nOf the four items we ordered, we only really enjoyed the boar collar. Even though it's a bit expensive for the small serving size, the meat is jam-packed with flavor that I had expected from Pok Pok. The other three dishes were quite meh and were not the same as the sweet, sour, and spicy that we expected with Thai food (we've been to Bangkok before) and were a bit on the salty side. It could be that we simply did not order the right dishes, but we were not impressed with our trip to Pok Pok."},{"name":"Luc√© Enoteca","address":"3499 Market St","city":"Powell","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been wanting to come to this place for quite a while since looking over their menu for Restaurant week and seeing lamb on it (when your family raises lambs, you find yourself looking for it everywhere!).  But, I have to say the location has been the deterrent.  Not that its in a bad part of town, but rather that its 40 minutes away from where I live!  When I'm hungry, I'm not looking forward to a 40 minute drive!  But when a friend and I decided that we needed to schedule a friend date or else, we thought that this would be a great place to go especially to take advantage of their beautiful patio!\\n\\nFrom the 1st second of walking in the door, I was impressed with the staff.  The hostess was really friendly, confirmed the reservation, and offered to seat me whilst I waited for my friend.  She had just texted that she was almost there so I decided to wait by the door.  The hostess took another group to their tables when a couple walked in and one of the servers, rather than just tell them that the hostess would be back soon to seat them, took time to chat with them until the hostess came back.  I thought that was such a nice way to make people feel like they were really wanted at a place.\\n\\nWhen my friend arrived and we were seated, our server was also very friendly, letting us take our time with our order (actually we just started talking and forgot to look at the menu!).  We both ordered the tomato bisque (AMAZING) and my friend ordered the Luce Salad and I the mushroom pizza.  The bread that was served whilst we were waiting was nice but the dipping sauce was the best part.  It was olive oil with what I believe to be pureed pepper in it and we went through 2 helpings of it.  Again, our server made sure we were well stocked!  The pizza was OK.  The toppings were fresh but it would have been so much better with fresh mozzarella buffalo.  Instead its consistency and taste was more along the lines of that shredded stuff that you can buy in a package at Kroger.  Still tasty, but lacking some potential flavor.\\n\\nAll in all, dinner with a glass of wine and tip came to $30.  Pretty decent for a good meal and I'll have to make it back sometime for the lamb!"},{"name":"Smokin' Betty's BBQ + Bar","address":"94 Lafayette St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"Let me start off that I'm a little biased about southern cookin and bbq as I'm from TX.

Although the use of double tortillas overshadowed what hint of flavor might have been in the filings leaving me only tasting corn tortilla, despite good tasting corn tortillas.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the taco of the month (The Tokyo Drifter) was delicious.  It was a beautiful mix of Asian flavors that was the highlight of the meal.

As simple as the flavors were, the consistencies of the dish stood out--the pasta had a nice chew to it and was not overly oily, and the calamari was meaty as well.

My hubby and I had late brunch there on Saturday and \\\\we enjoyed it very much. The decor was light and airy and I liked the touches of orange used in the stools and decorations.  Tables all have grills to fix your pancakes on.  I think this is a fun idea, but parents may want to rethink if you have young children. Although they can cover the grill for you.  We decided we wanted a bit more then the pancakes so I got the Slappy Benedict, poached eggs on spinach and prosciutto over english muffins,served with breakfast potatoes.  I  very much enjoyed the Benedict, the hollandaise sauce was nice and light, but the potatoes could have been a bit spicier.  My husband got the chicken fried steak with eggs and potatoes.  This was a hardy looking breakfast and he said that it was very good.  We will partake of the main attraction, Pancakes, on our next go round.   Prices are in line with most of the independent  breakfast places in Portland, our dishes were $8-11, 8 oz of Pancake Batter is only 5.00 + any extra fixings.  So in a group of people you could get a bunch of different batter ( pumpkin, buckwheat) and fixings and put together a nice mix of pancakes.   Service is a bit sketchy.  I did have to wait about 15-20 for my Latte, which came with the meal.  Seemed the bartender does all the specialty drinks and there was a large party that had come in before us.  But all new restaurants have to go through a bit of a start phase before they get the rhythm going.  I will say that the meal was served right a way and was nice and hot.  The bathroom was clean. We will most definitely try it again.

For example, southern comfort sauce or coca cola wing sauce are some of their popular ones. If that isn't enough for you, they have huge fishbowls filled with liquor. Service was great also. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I would probably not return to The Nook. At the end of the day, I was just not a fan of coca cola wings or southern comfort wings. Both are very sweet and made me wish that there was more sauce selections to pick from for somebody who isn't a fan of sweet food. The portion wasn't very filling either given the small size of the wings used, so I left hungry despite getting the larger size plate on the menu."},{"name":"The Warren City Club","address":"818 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I bought a discounted membership last year through a deal site to try it out, and it has been worth every penny.

The staff is beyond courteous and prompt, and the service has been consistently good.\\n\\nThe food is amazing as well. I've eaten at a lot of places in ATL, and nearly everything I've gotten here has been the best version I've had of it, hands-down. My husband and I went for dinner and a comedy show last night and had a great time. It was his first visit, and he was very impressed by the service and the food. He thought I was being silly paying for a supper club membership before even paying for the food, but now he's a believer as well, and even said we should bring his parents next time they're in town!\\n\\nThe only issue I've ever had was the Web site and events/calendaring functionality, which in the past has been hard to use, but they just released a revamped site that seems much more intuitive, and the newsletter events have been clarified as well, so that problem looks like it's been fixed. Facebook has also been helpful keeping track of what they're offering on a given week (though often does not provide quite all the info one would need to act on the event, and then I have to look it up in the newsletter).\\n\\nIn summary, this has been a great experience.

I'd highly recommend the meatballs with guava sauce, the yucca stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon, and the fried oysters.

There were only a few other tables of people. I ordered the quinoa burger which was very good as were the sides. I also got one of the special non alcoholic drinks and it was tasty but not sure if they are worth the $$ ($4-$5). Today I met a friend for lunch and I'm docking a point for the parking situation. There is a parking garage but it's only free for the first hour and I spent a good 20 minutes looking for a spot. Half of the parking lot is designated for Trader Joe's and while I was planning on picking up a few items after my meal I am a dork when it comes to rules and couldn't bring myself to park in one of those spots. So around and around I went with my screaming baby. Finally stopped to ask one of the Trader Joe's employees where to park and he found an open (non-TJ's designated) spot for me but by that time I was almost in tears. Anyway, on to the meal-this time there was a 25 minute wait! Jeez, how did that happen? In 2 weeks this place blew up! I ordered the heirloom tomato appetizer and it was amazing. For my main course I had the spicy curry with tofu which was also very good. I think in the future I will stick to ordering my curries at more authentic places. It was good, don't get me wrong...maybe just not $15 good. So yeah, the prices are steep but the food quality is amazing. Oh, one other thing-we sat outside which was pleasant enough until the train passed by and everyone on the patio winced as it screeched down the tracks for what seemed an eternity.

These thin and crispy tendrils of corned beef with shredded carrots and tiny potato morsels are that of irish boy's dreams. The eggs on top were caressed over easy with real butter and were full of drippy yolk goodness. Oh and then there were the rosemary potatoes,  these thin silver dollar potatoes were so perfectly seasoned that I dared not to dip them in ketchup. Rather I surgically opened my egg yolks with the tip of my fork scooping out all of the yolk with these large rosemary potato slices. \\n\\nIf this restaurant were a person, our Facebook status would read: deep-deep like.

I do like the place and will keep coming back if only for the beer selection and stylish yet comfortable atmosphere. Plus, they are dog friendly with an awesome patio and bike friendly with nice bike racks out front. \\n\\nThe beer selection is usually great, offering more craft beers than the crappy regulars - 20 taps to choose from with seasonals. The wine list is decent, not fabulous but good enough for local tastes. They also host tastings from time to time. However, every cocktail I've had was simply terrible, making the beer and wine your best bet. I'm not a fan of Cuvee coffee but I hear the coffee and espresso drinks are good from others. \\n\\nThey offer no real food but they do have coffee type desserts and meat & cheese trays, small snackage items. I have seen them handle ready to eat food without gloves, not good. Even with gloves on, I often see gloves touch things they're not supposed to, increasing the risk of cross contamination, that is unless the food will be cooked right after. Nates has no kitchen. So be prepared to have a close food option to go to after you've had your fill.\\n\\nThe service: Some days the service is great, other days you have to wave at the bar to get their attention. However, they're usually polite, especially if you're a regular, which doesn't speak so well for new customers. The husband is always gruff with attitude, a complete turn-off - the wife is better. The regular staff is hit & miss as far as being attentive. Also, they are not knowledgeable about the beers & wines they serve. You'll see that the owners/operators never address the low review raters on Yelp, also not good if you care about customer satisfaction. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is what shines here. The inside and patio have very nice stylings. The bathrooms are clean and stylish themselves. The seating is hard and heavy however, and the noise level inside can get really loud when it starts filling up. The patio has a small stage and a fire pit with hanging metal stars from the huge tree out front. If they can overcome all the short comings in the lower rated reviews, this place has a lot of potential to be a really great establishment.

Unfortunately the price tag that comes with the dishes was far too high when I feel you can get the same good food at 1/5 or 1/4 the total price at Rod Dee or Dok Bua.\\n\\nParticularly, the Laab/Larb was great. You don't find it many places or have to ask for it off the menu as many don't like the funk/putrid element to their dishes. \\n\\nThe other mainstays we ordered included papaya salad (decent -- very spicy and savory but not blowing your top off like at Rod Dee), a very generous portion and much more nuanced version of Tom Yom Soup than surrounding Thai restaurants (the highlight besides the laab), and a disappointing Grilled Chicken Green Curry (the charred chicken distracted heavily from the subtle, delicate green curry sweetness).\\n\\nDropping the prices a bit might get their business up.

Maybe it depends on what you order, but everything I've had was fine for the price, very filling and exactly what I ordered.\\n\\nAs for service, I've been here many times and not had a problem. I mean, the servers aren't gushing and hovering over you the whole time you're eating, maybe that's the experience some people expect from \\"good\\" service, but I'm eating and having a conversation, leave me alone and refill my empty cup/glass when I put it to the side. That's all I'm really looking for, and they do that.\\n\\nI've decided that if I visit a restaurant once, and had a bad service experience, I'm not going to give a low rating just because of that. I'll either review other aspects or come back again before reviewing -- and if I never come back, I simply won't review. The server will be punished anyway by getting a bad tip, no need to hold the entire restaurant accountable because one person was having a bad day.

This dish looked cute and the bed of vermicelli on the bottom but there wasn't anything special.  The curry was too spicy and the fish balls were ok.  Probably because i'm used to eating really good ones in Asia.  \\n\\nCoconut rice- good and like your normal coconut rice, nothing too special, but still good.\\n\\nOverall, i wasn't impressed by this place.

Now if I want frozen pint glasses I go to Hooters and order a Coors Light or a Bud ... But not a Pils. Ok well I just let it rest for a bit. Then I ordered what according to Yelp where good dishes. I started with the octopus. This had Serrano ham. Ok first off I couldn't taste any of the nutty Serrano ham flavor, second the two tiny strips of it looked like someone slapped them over the octopus as an afterthought. Then there were a ton of mushy peppers and some blobs of mayonnaise. Now the octopus itself was actually pretty well grilled with a nice char on it but everything around it made me forget about that.  This was a typical less is more situation.  No need for the ham and give me 1/4 of the peppers, and it would have been something I would remember. \\nOk that was the first course. Second course lamb shoulders. Now again nice piece of not too fatty piece of lamb, cooked until it falls off the bone by itself ... But what they forgot was flavor.  Now usually lamb itself has a wonderful flavor by itself. Now this was so bland I couldn't even tell it was lamb and that was not because there were other flavor no there was nothing.  How this is possible is beyond me ... Just adding some garlic and maybe some red wine, salt, pepper to the pot when they made it would have done it but with what ever they did I was stuck with this piece of meat that tasted like nothing. \\n\\nOk so average at the most. But the reason I write this review is not so much the place and the food, but Boston. Boston if this place gets four stars out of more than 400 reviews, if this is more or less as good as it gets (because lets face it there are always some people that complain that something was too expensive or they didn't get a seat ...) then I am really for a loss of words. I don't want to offend anyone from the mid west here but this is what I would expect to see gets four stars in a place like Indianapolis or Denver, or Saint Luis ... But a place that wants to compete with the other large cities on the east coast? Sorry nope, you barely make it to Philly level if this is four stars to you and you certainly are behind New York and DC and Miami.  So please up your game Boston this was a disappointment and I don't blame the restaurant so much for this but the many Bostonians who think this is 4 stars."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The bartenders were very helpful in choosing a wine for me and a bourbon drink for my husband.

I can count - hang on, I have the time - 29 of 32 people in here contemplating a complete absence of chicken. \\n\\nNow, I'm not going to assume that it's easy for a KFC that's open until 1am in a major tourist destination to keep up with a Thursday night rush of hungry people.

Something's wrong, though, and all I have is time to sit here and think of reasons why, when you think of the name of this place, the only thing I identify with is the fact that my brain is fried. No, not the chicken. No, not Kentucky. I hate fast food and my brain is fried from waiting almost 90 minutes now. Extra crispy. No food. \\n\\nSomeday I know this entry will be found on the floor of this KFC by an archaeogist who will refer to us as the modern Donner party.

I do like the fact that they text you when your table is ready, so you don't need to hover around the entrance in fear of missing your name being called. They also have a bar across the street (Whiskey Soda Lounge) where you can hang out and get drinks / appetizers before your meal, which really improved the wait. I had a pineapple drinking vinegar, and I loved it. Would definitely love to try some of the other flavors. When we were texted that our table was ready, the bar also notified us and gave us our bill at the same time, so that system is well coordinated. \\n\\nAt the restaurant, we were seating in a back, outdoor section at a picnic table with a metal tabletop. We ordered the Vegetarian Papaya Pok Pok (very spicy!), Da Chom's Laap Meuang (very spicy!), Kaeng Hang Leh, and Muu Sateh. \\n\\nDa Chom's Laap Meuang came with the most actual food (it was sort of like a pile of minced pork). \\n\\nThe Kaeng Hang Leh had really good flavor, but the number of pork belly / pork shoulder lumps in the sauce was pretty limited. \\n\\nThe Muu Sateh was 6x pork skewers that came with a really tasty peanut sauce, a spicy cucumber salad, and small squares of toasted bread. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 sides of rice at first (one Jasmine, one sticky), and then ended up needing to order another side halfway through the meal (for 4 people). \\n\\nOverall, everything was good, but nothing blew me away (except for the drinking vinegar).

It also seemed a little bit expensive for a Portland restaurant, especially considering the size of the dishes. \\n\\nThe bathroom was really gross and needed to be cleaned.\\n\\nService was good, and they gave us hand wipes with our napkins, which is a nice touch considering how messy some of the food they serve can be.  \\n\\nThe ambiance was \\"Christmas lights\\" and \\"squished,\\" which, according to some other reviews is authentic, so take that however you like.

I could definitely do without the wall coloring. It  reminded me of an old school cafeteria. Thankfully, they have a patio that brought relief to my eyes.  Although, there's not much going on outside, it's refreshing to enjoy a great meal in beautiful 70 degree weather. \\n\\nAs for the food, I had the Raw Bruschetta, and the Thanksgiving sandwich with jalapeno cornbread and Texas Caviar. This was my first time every eating seitan and I LOVED IT. I loved it so much that  the next day I went to another local favorite and tried 2 different seitan wraps then decide to hit up HEB so I could make my own. Can you tell I'm hooked? Anyway, back to the sandwich....the gravy was a great compliment to the seitan. Needless to say,  I had poor conversation skills while stuffing my face. As for the cornbread, it wasn't bad. It tasted exactly what I envisioned. The jalapenos didn't add any heat to it, so no worries there. The Texas Caviar was a bit of a disappointment though. I wouldn't say it's bad, I think it's more of a preference thing with me. The black eyed beans were cool, so it lacked the warm mushy feeling that I expect from any bean. I know the dish is suppose to be cool, but it didn't quite work for me.  As for the Raw Bruschetta it was very delicious. I was a bit disappointed when I didn't see French bread, but the flax cracker worked well. I only wish we could get 3 or 4 of those suckers per plate, but then it wouldn't qualify as an appetizer.\\n\\nBottom line: Give them a visit. It's well worth it and I'm sure you'll become a return customer."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was staying at the Hilton Back Bay and stopped in for a quick lunch.

There is so much to do here on the premises and it is connected to the Ritz Carlton which you are able to take full advantage of their amenities as well! \\n\\nNOTES:\\n- Pool. Ritz Carlton is a little more relaxing and more adult friendly. They have cabanas too and when split amongst a group of people it is reasonably priced. Great escape from the sporadic rain showers FL is known for.\\n- Hammocks along the river for an afternoon nap. Check out the 8ft gator that hangs out under the terrace behind the Ritz pool.\\n- Definitely recommend the guided eco tour via kayak of Shingle Creek (headwaters of the Everglades). Was my favorite part of the whole trip! The tour guide, Carlos, was so knowledgable and was just a great way to spend the afternoon.\\n- To save some money on food, there is a Walgreen's within walking distance and there is a small bodega on the first floor. You can also pick up tubes for the pool at Walgreens.\\n- The lobby lounge at the JW is a lot of fun at night. You can bring your own beers and sit on the balcony around the bonfire. Dress attire: upscale, loungy. Fun to get out of the pool attire and into a nice dress at night!\\n- Must try next time: Yoga classes at the Ritz.

They seemed to revolve resulting in unnecessary delays in an already sizable line.\\n- Prep time. While the setup implies that one would order and then pick up a la a quick serve sandwich shop, that's just not realistic with burgers. Make the seating more inviting (why do the booths move when you stand up?!) and get patrons used to a brief wait, especially since it took over 20 minutes for our order to come out and that seems to be the norm.\\n- Grease. It doesn't make tummies happy. 'Nuff said.\\n\\nThe reason I won't be returning is simple: I watched a middle aged male staff member deliver a pair of shakes, one small and one large, to the table next to me where a thin girl and a larger guy sat. He placed the small in one in front of the woman and the large one in front of the man saying \\"I assume that the lady gets the small one, right hon?\\" I could go into all the things wrong with this from a human perspective but I'll just call it terribly poor form.

What is nice about Burton's is that it is the first restaurant in their space, as the building is only a few years old.  The space seems designed for Burton's versus shoehorned into a space that has been restaurant space for the past 50yrs and seems disjointed.   Burton's is a good alternative for Red Sox pre- and pst-game drinks as it is just far enough away from Fenway to skip the masses but is still only a 5 minute walk to Fenway.  This makes it a good meet-up spot for a group coming from multiple locations.  Aside from Red Sox Nation, it is a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood.  I mainly sit at the bar.  The bar tenders are attentive and the service is very good. The food is also above average.  I mainly stick to burgers and sandwiches, which they have executed flawlessly on my many visits.

It has a great location, solid menu items, and a welcoming venue. \\n\\nWhat can I say after 500+ reviewers? I think Pho Basil is great, but its not without its weaknesses. \\n\\nWhat are my favorite menu items? Dac Biet, Com Suon (a pork rice plate), and Bun tom thit cha gio (vermicelli noodle bowl, SO GOOD!). I could go into more depth of the greatness of these items, but I'll just quickly summarize: fresh vegetables and ingredients, well executed standard items, and great flavors.\\n\\nTo be honest, the pho and noodle soups are all really great: Dac Biet, Xe Lua, Duck noodle soup, tom yum noodle soup, bun bo hue, pho sate are all great on a cold night. \\n\\nI think the weaknesses are really in the other dishes. The curries are lackluster compared to the other richer and more savory Thai restaurants in Boston. Whenever I venture into the specials menu, I tend to get burned. I think the menu at Pho Basil is just too large and most people order standards like the noodle soups and pad thai. The specials just don't seem as well practiced nor well executed. Many of the appetizers are overpriced and not that great.\\n\\nMy biggest pet peeve of Pho Basil is in the middle of winter. People LOVE to keep both the front and second doors open in the entrance creating a polar vortex of cold air rushing into the restaurant. There isn't a good system for people waiting for tables. \\n\\nLong story short, how can I really criticize Pho Basil, when I have come here so often for so many years.

Today was my last trip. The workers never seem to know their products or the register.  They are often too busy chatting to care and it seems like there are new people that need to be trained on the register every time I go in.  They barely toast the bagels here.  The station with the milk and sugar is always really messy. Last week, I ordered a Chai Latte that was all milk. It was lukewarm and barely tasted of chai.  I don't think they gave the tea any chance to steep. Today, I ordered a London Fog and the guy helping the girl who took my order made it with English Breakfast.  When I informed her that it's supposed to be made with Early Grey, her response was literally, \\"OK\\" as she was walking away from me.  No, \\"sorry, let me remake that.\\"  I didn't ask for it to be remade because I didn't want the hassle, but a modicum of customer service requires an apology and an offer.  Also, she had a really hard time taking my order to begin with (issues with the register and with remembering my order).  It's always little things that wouldn't bother me if it was once or twice, but I've never gone in there and had a smooth ordering experience resulting in me getting the exact items I ordered.

Look at the pool and multiply 1,000 rooms time multiple occupants  in each room - then look at that pool area again.  It is not sufficient for the size of the hotel.

Several phone calls with one of the most pleasant hostesses I have ever talked to and a courtesy meeting with one of the managers to get into the details of the night.  Yes, this was already looking to be good, but I had no idea what I was in store for.\\n\\nSo, last night, a friend and I get there about an hour early to go over the last minute details of the dinner, which was also good to check out the bar.  Bartender knew his liquors like none I had ever seen and we ended up trying several selections, some of which we'd never heard of before, which were all amazing.  His recommendations on the appetizers was excellent (neither of us had eaten, and we weren't about to go another hour on drinks alone); as stated in the previous review, the Ahi Tuna Poke is an absolute, you must have it, no questions asked, part of any meal in this place.  It is simply amazing.  We also did an order of Oysters on the Half Shell and these were some of the cleanest, tastiest oysters I had ever eaten; the best word I could use to describe them was \\"refreshing.\\"  \\n\\nDuring this time, we also planned some of the family style portion of the meal with the waitress taking care of us, and her recommendations were right on.   \\n\\nNotable appetizers were:\\n\\nAhi Tuna Poke -- Again, a must have.  \\n\\nLobster Fritters -- Lightly battered/fried, juicy, tender, and were gone almost instantly.\\n\\nHeart of the Ribeye Carpaccio -- You know carpaccio is good when people who don't even like it are asking if there was more.\\n\\nAsian Style Meatballs -- I originally thought these sounded a bit bland, but the taste is, well, without description.  Additionally, the sauce is amazing for dipping the bread in.\\n\\nFor my salad, I chose the Spinach Salad; nothing overly complex, just a very enjoyable salad which complimented the meal very, very well.\\n\\nSteak: Dry Aged Cowboy Ribeye, though I also tried portions of the other aged steaks, the Filet Mignon, and even a friend's burger (yes, I wanted to slap him).  Seven words:\\n\\nTHIS IS THE REASON YOU COME HERE!!\\n\\nFor notable sides:\\n\\nO-Rings -- just what they should be, light, fried and tasty.\\n\\nGarlic Spinach -- If you are a spinach lover, and like how garlic or red bean spinach is prepared Asian style, this is for you.\\n\\nGarlicky Green Beans -- tender, juicy, and a very light flavor which is a great compliment to the steaks.\\n\\nJalapeno Creamed Corn -- One of my two favorite sides and I could have made a meal out of this alone.  The taste combination of sweet corn with a kick of jalapeno just makes this dish.\\n\\nScalloped Sweet Potatoes -- Originally I wasn't planning on trying this as I am not a big sweet potato fan, but this ended up being my other favorite side.  This is a rich, cheesy, gooey, mix of heart attack is something that you just can't stop eating.  \\n\\nNow, as if we had any room left (I actually had to take the rest of my steak home and I just got done eating the rest for a snack), dessert came, family style trays of the chefs/waitresses selection.  I'm getting tired of writing, but the key lime cheesecake was my favorite and definitely a must try if you care for either.   \\n\\nFinally, and probably something that gets overlooked in the shadow of the amazing food was that the staff was just simply amazing.  The recommendations and portions were right on.  The delivery of the food was impeccably timed.

If you're running out of toppings, I completely understand - but that plate never should have gone out.  Also, I'm not sure if they have air conditioning at all or if it just doesn't work, but it's always warm in there!

I got vegetarian spring rolls, and my parents got their beef carpaccio appetizer. They LOVED their appetizer, to the point where they decided to save a little for me to take home for the husband. The spring rolls were good too, but vegetarians beware: even though they advertise them being veg, all the spring rolls come with FISH vinaigrette. Thankfully our waiter was really nice and told me they'd prepare a soy sauce vinaigrette instead.\\n\\nI got the vegetarian bun, which was pretty good, mom got the flounder bun, which she loved, and my Dad got some sort of curry chicken dish. I believe he said the chicken was almost overcooked, but he really loved the sauce, so he was still pretty pleased.\\n\\nTheir dessert menu is kinda bizarre. All the desserts sounded yummy, don't get me wrong, but none of them struck me as particularly Vietnamese. Their wine menu also looks pretty reasonable too, and I think there was a Vietnamese beer there that was supposed to be decent as well.\\n\\nWhile this isn't the kind of Vietnamese I traditionally think of (they didn't have a single Pho dish on the menu), it was still pretty good for what it was."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Tried one of their specials and the mac n cheese - WOW.

While I'm not expecting extremely high quality raw oysters at a buffet, it is absolutely inexcusable and dangerous to be serving raw oysters to the public that aren't even refrigerated properly. A room-temperature raw oyster is a hot breeding ground for bacteria -- putting out something like that to serve to people when it can seriously make them sick or, in some cases, kill them is no light matter. I don't know how they're storing these oysters for them to be coming out warm onto the buffet.\\n\\nThis makes me sad because I really used to love this place when it first changed its name.

The sausage had a good flavor without being too salty and had a lot of snap to it- which is something that I look for when I eat sausages.  The potato salad tasted like how I imagined potato salad would taste like- not to eggy or sour and was a good compliment to the meats.  The coleslaw also again was as good as I thought coleslaw is- sweet, tangy, and crunchy.

Everything we ordered came out to $26 but we ordered more than enough for 2 people.\\n\\nService: \\nRudy's had the best example of Southern hospitality that we could have experienced in our first visit to TX.  As we walked up to the front, the cashier welcomed us and introduced us thoroughly to Rudy's briskets, sausages, ribs, sides, desserts, and drinks- describing how they made each of their meats.  Bc we were newcomers, she gave us free bite size samples of the brisket, turkey, and creamed corn.  Such hospitality!\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nWe didn't arrive during their prime hours (we came at 330p) so there was probably 4 people in the restaurant, but as we were near the end of our food-ganza, a line was forming with ~20 people waiting.  The ambiance was picnic-style.  They had tables/ benches were laid out in rows and covered with the checkered tablecloth.  Food was placed on wax paper and served to us in old plastic soda crates.  Sauce and condiments were already on the table.

I'm very fortunate that Boogie is pretty well behaved as the little people go but I kid you not, I saw a woman stand by and let her child pour almost an entire bottle of syrup onto the griddle.

Look man, I don't care if you give a f*** or not. But seriously, if you go here and don't order the lavender honey? Your taste in food will be suspect and chicks (or chicos) will no longer flock to you like geese. I went with one of their suggested combos: Granola, Green Apple, and Lavender Honey (because I'm a big hippie), and I strongly rate it in my list of fantastic life decisions (which granted, is a pretty short list so this one's really close to the top). I don't even like honey as a regular rule but figured I'd give it a shot. The only bummer was it was so f***ing good I didn't get around to trying the syrup.\\n\\nNUTELLA NEEDS AN ENVELOPE. My bestie in the Northwestie was with us and ordered their homemade nutella as a toping option, if you're going to put it in your batter (heh, heh that sounds dirty) make sure to put a little extra batter on top so it doesn't stick to the griddle (otherwise you're going to be like the syrup-griddle kid and chicks will no longer flock to you like...well you get the idea)\\n\\nDON'T BRING A BOOK. Our waitress was really nice and didn't make us feel rushed at all, but there's no denying the silent pressure that a line of waiting diners outside can provide. \\n\\nHAVE A FUN TIME. Seriously man, it's a pancake breakfast with your little person that you don't have to clean up after.The options are way fun, little people dig it, and if you're really lucky, you may score on...\\n\\nPANCAKE INDUCED NAP TIME.

The Korrito was solid, containing Korean-style marinated beef and soybean hummus.  Also had the jap chae, a traditional Korean noodle dish, the calamari with kimchi tartar and the mung bean cake, which was similar to traditional pajun.

They have two locations, one in Kits and one in Gastown. I've visited their Kits location several months ago and decided to check out their Gastown location. During the latter visit, I had their Big Mountie and Southern Belly Biscuit. While neither dish was perfect, I quite enjoyed both, in particular their French toast and pulled pork. The food was very hearty and filling, and the prices are quite reasonable. Service-wise, the staff weren't the most attentive, but they are quite cheerful and friendly. All in all, this is a place that I'd recommend checking out for some tasty, hearty American comfort food.\\n\\nBig Mounties ($15.50):\\n4/5\\nThis consisted of three slices of French toast sandwiching a layer of pulled pork and a piece of fried chicken, and was topped with two eggs. I LOVED the French toast: they were soft and fluffy with a wonderful sweet fragrance of cinnamon. The fried chicken was not the greatest: even though it was reasonably juicy for white meat and well-seasoned, the breading was quite soggy. I did really enjoy their pulled pork however, which was very tender and juicy, and d a nice sweetness, which I like in my pulled pork. Personally, I'd go with their Pulled Pork Monte Cristo, which is a similar dish but missing the top layer of fried chicken.\\n\\nSouthern Belly Biscuit ($13.50):\\n3.5/5\\nThis consisted of bacon, an egg, cheddar cheese, biscuits, and two sausage patties, all topped with gravy and slices of jalapeno peppers, and came with a side of hashbrowns. I found the biscuits themselves to be a bit too soft and soggy, without any discernable flavour; I actually preferred the ones from Jethros a bit more. The gravy was not overly thick/gummy, but was also a bit bland for my taste. The meat was tasty however: the bacon was quite crispy and the sausage patties were tender, juicy, and had a nice spicy flavour. The jalapenos also helped lend more flavour to the dish. I also really enjoyed their hashbrowns, which were shredded and very crispy on the outside and was also quite well-seasoned.\\n\\nSummary:\\nFood: 4/5\\nPrice: 4/5\\nService: 3.5/5\\nOverall: 4/5\\nRecommendations: Pulled Pork Monte Cristo, French toast"},{"name":"Pinky's Famous Pizza","address":"165 Main St","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"Pizza here is very unimpressive, although they probably broke laws of physics in order to get ours to us as incredibly quickly as they did.

The place is simple, but the food complex. I was delighted and amazed by that meal. I should have taken photos, but once I put the first fork-full into my mouth, I couldn't/wouldn't stop for photos. This place was featured on \\"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\\" (http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/diners-drive-ins-and-dives/videos/dv700/you-can-say-that-again.html) for the chicken wings that we got to-go for my sister and bro-in-law, who said they were fantastic. But let me start at the beginning: the wait staff were cheerful, attentive and accommodating, which included the personal guide to the patio area. This was needed because the place is a delightful maze, with many opportunities to observe with both eyes and nose the food creation process. The patio consisted of long picnic benches covered with bright tablecloths that would be shared with other diners. We were there early and had a table to ourselves though there were diners at almost all the other tables. The patio is covered so you can eat there even during the rain, which we did and of course, it rains a lot in Portland. You can also eat at the fully stocked bar downstairs. Now that we've covered the service and ambience, let me get to the main event. The owner travelled around Southeast Asia for a decade learning his craft, especially the critical spices featured in this food. You won't find the typical pad thai on this menu, and you'll never miss it. My sister got the kai yaang, which is charcoal roasted game hen with lemongrass, garlic, pepper and cilantro. It was served with spicy/sweet sour and tamarind dipping sauces. This spicy/sweet cleaned out her lungs and sinuses after just a few bites. I tried it on my sticky rice, and it was fantastic. She loved every bite. I got the neua naam tok, which is spicy Issan flank steak \\"salad\\" with fish sauce, lime and chili powder dressing, shallots, lemongrass, mint, cilantro and toasted rice powder. I can't think of enough superlatives to describe it. Every bite made my mouth dance a jig. I can't wait to return to Portland a sample other items on the menu.

Your menu items are relatively delicious, however the prices are astounding per the portion sizes, flavor and creativity.  Which is to say, the food tastes pretty good, but in ordering one of everything on the menu as my friend and I are prone to do, we were discouraged to find that nearly everything, with the exception of the pad thai, was based on cashew cheese.  I'm sorry, but I was really hoping for some great variety, not to order several portions of the same thing.  Not even the desserts were exciting enough to yield great commentary.\\n\\nAlso, all of the items are so heavy, salty and full of fats (cashews to be exact).  After eating, we came away feeling like we had bricks in our stomachs, a most uncomfortable feeling.  I have eaten at other raw food restaurants from which I felt mild discomfort for a while, but was satisfied enough with the quality of the meal that I did not mind so much.  Here I was just uncomfortable and felt as though I had spent too much.  If you would add a few lower fat, unique items, I would come more often and not feel badly about the extraordinary pricing (low fat is cheaper for you to make anyway).  But until then, I must tend to the serenity of my digestive organs.\\n\\nThat being said, the coconut jerky is amazing, albeit so salty that I literally felt nauseous after eating it.

Was not impressed at all and didn't understand what's the hype about because of all the food I had, everything was so terrible along with bad services. I heard there is a typical 1 hour wait so we went at around 2 PM. The restaurant literally only had like about 10 people sat at the tables and they made us wait 30 mins while I saw all the waiters there walking around doing nothing. You don't even get this kind of bad service in a tiny NYC restaurant. \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated, We ordered their famous chicken wings and it was freaking salty like they poured a whole bottle of fish sauce into that plate of 6 wings. I was chugging down water like the fish in the Columbia river! The wings wasn't even crispy it was soggy sticky wings. Then we proceeded to order the pork rib satay based on the waiter's recommendation, the wing bean salad, 1 chicken khao soi, and 1 beef khao soi and my friend said this place has the best khao soi. The pork rib was dried up and hard like the land in California during the drought. The flavor was weird and salty too. I took 1 bite and proceeded to throw out the rest of the rib. Then I tried my chicken Khao soi and it was cold and tasteless. It was pretty much a bowl of cold creamy coconut milk and noodle with some crunchy fried wonton and over cooked chicken. I had to pour in the fish sauce they put on the table to get some flavor to it beside the coconut milk. The only decent thing I had there was the wingbean salad. It was not as salty or bland as the other dishes probably due to the lime juice in the sauce and the wingbean was interesting. Overall this place was horrible and not worth the hype. On top of that, it was pricy too for crap foods! Like they charge you average price of $15-$20 for an entree and don't even give you rice or the sticky rice to eat with the food. You have to order rice separately and it's $3 for a small baby portion of rice/sticky rice. What a way to rip off your customers.

Then Bunk changed all of that...\\n\\nWell here we are about 9-10 years later and Pizza Jerk has filled the void that Bunk left.  I looked at the layout and the walls and still reminisced about my many visits to Bunk, but I also was surprised at how a few little differences made Pizza Jerk stand out.

I also mentioned that I was instructed to have a manager look at my order and know that I was placing my order, to which the woman responded \\"ok I will let my manager know\\", double sweet! When we get to Torchys a man helped us and began to repeat my order, he read everything back and says one of the taco of the months is on flour, ugh. At this point I'm frustrated from this place and ask the man if he is the manager, he responds yes, I then ask if he was told about my order at all or if anyone informed him of me placing my order, his response? No. Now I am super frustrated, I corrected him on how my order should be and explain to him the conversation I had with Ricardo, the other manager. He acts surprised, apologizes, and grabs my order and \\"checks it out\\". I was expecting my meal to be comped since that's what I was told on the phone last week, nope, instead I got a discount and still paid almost full price, which I just wanted to leave at that point so that's fine. We get home and begin to open our tacos when... You can't be f****** serious, the two tacos of the month are missing HALF OF THE INGREDIENTS, and one of the other tacos was ICE COLD. I swiftly call Torchys and speak to Chris and informed him of the mistakes, he chuckles and replies \\"you've got to be kidding me ugh!\\" and gives me a refund.\\n\\nFast forward to today and I still have not gotten my refund on my bank card. My fiance decided to get a breakfast taco the other day, trashy and in a bowl, like usual and there was no queso on his taco when he got to his office, typical though at this point. I am officially done with this location. It sucks because this location in convenient and we love Torchys, however, it's not worth the headache of always having an incorrect order, being made promises that don't follow through, and dealing with incompetent employees and management that can't even communicate with each other in an efficient manner to make sure things are being done the right way. The managers did try though, even though it didn't work out the way they intended and I love their tacos, hence, the two star review."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is good, but when you wait an hour for a table on a Sunday afternoon whilst standing in the rain, you expect to get a server who at least pretends they like their job.

That definitely seems to be missing. \\nWhen I was a young toddler, I would've loved to have nourished my growing body and soul with the Yam Kai Meuang soup with it's bright flavor of lemongrass mixed with the floral flavor of banana blossoms and the broth also has a floral flavor but the shrimp paste and chicken allow for heartiness. The soup is aromatic, healthy, and beautiful tasting that as you feel it travel down your stomach it feels medicinal. I feel like this is the kind of soup that would grant us longevity to our short time on earth. Our waiter told us that this soup is found in certain villages around Thailand and is rarely found in Thai restaurants.  This soup is served piping hot as it is delivered in a stone bowl with a bed of coals underneath to keep it hot, so you can savor it through your meal as you taste other delights. \\nCareful the Yam Makheua Yao is spicy! I have a pretty good tolerance for spice, so I was surprised at the level of Thai-chilis involved in this dish. I wish my waiter would've given me a heads-up.\\nDon't forget to ask about the infused water. The water that is served is usually infused with something...a leaf? I forget the name. But, the water can have a nice calming effect on your palate as you're tasting your dishes.

Their cocktails are also always reliable. If you are really jonesing for something you can't quite name, the bartender will usually make something based on what you seem to be in the mood for (based on your description, of course).

To start... order a biscuit right out of the gate this way you can snack on it while enjoying your oysters/appetizers and dinner.  This buttermilk biscuit drizzled in honey is large enough to share with a lover or friend.  Raw bar baby!  There is always a wide selection of local oysters which of course includes Island Creek and Wellfleet as well as west coast oysters.  If you are visiting from out of town you must go local.  Add a crudo if you have the room and you must have at least one oyster slider.  This fried oyster treat is smothered in lime chili aioli and layered between a sweet brioche bun.  Definitely a can't miss item.  \\n\\nBorn and raised in Boston I love lobster.  I could it everyday for every meal.  There are indeed a couple of lobster options on the menu; the lobster salad, Ethel's lobster roll and the lobster roe noodles.  But having tried them all there is only one clear choice and that is Island Creek's signature dish, the lobster roe noodles.  This decadent dish features braised short rib and grilled lobster on top of pasta/\\"noodles\\" made of lobster roe.

Not a true vegan establishment but they have a variety of raw, vegan, vegetarian and even dishes with eggs that are very good.  The biggest difference I think that I can state between this place and other places like it is that I don't think I can duplicate most of the dishes, wraps and drinks that they make here.  I got a wrap with Quinoa, beets, carrots, cucumbers, it was not something that I would ever think to get but was amazing.  I think the fact that the quinoa was warm really put it over the top.  I also had a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, kale and other ingredients that I weren't sure what they were and it was easily the best breakfast sandwich that I have ever had.  The smoothie type juices were good, I also got a ginger drink that was just too strong but still very good.  Unfortunately we don't live close to this location or I would go probably once a week or more if I could.  I think the one draw back that I can see is that the service was slow(er) and it took a little while to get our food.  Most of this is because they get very busy but part of it also is because they have a very laid back atmosphere.  I would say if you are going here you should be open to taking to go, if you are pinched for time you should call ahead as a pick up order.

I thought it was odd that on lunch hour during a weekday during the school year it was dead, but I guess it's probably more popular for drinking at night. I liked the chips and thick, chunky salsa pretty well. The chips were thick and the salsa was spicy. I had the salad with lime cilantro dressing which is more like pesto than a vinaigrette. I also thought the salad was pretty good and I was looking forward to the burrito. I was really let down by it though. It was huge and almost all beans and rice for like $8. Just a drizzle of mediocre sauce and the shrimp I bit into every once in a while were really off. I probably wouldn't have minded the shrimp if it had a little more flavor, but it just tasted like cheap heat, and that's about it.\\nThe only reason I'm giving Mad Mex 3 stars is because the service was phenomenal.

Fried up to a crunch in the batter then tossed for a long time in fish sauce and spice. The wings are not cut, so you get a whole three section of the wing. There is this \\"dead\\" saltiness taste to the wings that really just numb your taste buds. It's so salty that you have to savor there after taste to even recognize the fish sauce. Wings:  star. If you're really curious then try it, otherwise don't waste your money and time. A lot of Portlanders say they're the best wings they've every had, but if you're like me who is from California and have traveled to Thailand, then you're not missing out. \\n\\n\\nBeef curry noodle soup- beautifully done. The curry flavor is not too strong so it's very delicate for your mouth to taste every piece of flavor. But maybe because my taste buds were numb from the devious wings that's why I couldn't taste it. Anyway, the dish is served in a noodle soup bowl with seems to me like red paste curry. The beef is oh so tender and just enough pieces to compliment the noodles. Don't expect a protein diet out of this dish, for from my understanding, Thai food is small portions, fresh ingredients where balance of flavors is more important than getting best bank for your buck. The soup is served with a plate of red chilli paste, pickled bok choy, crunchy tofu (I think) and fresh shallots. I love that even though the red chilli paste looked dangerous, it didn't kill the flavor of the curry. The curry taste had the right amount of coconut flavor with dash of Thai spice. you'll see later on when I try to save my tongue from the papaya salad heat is when I needed the curry to cure my tongue and life. My rating: 5/5 stars. Will order again. \\n\\nPapaya salad- this sh*t is SPICY. If you can't handle heat or want to test your burning hole limit, then be my guest. The dish itself is delicious. The ingredients are fresh and this salad is mixed with baby blue crab leg that is raw I believe. Suck on their crab feet to get a party of flavors. Flavors include lime, the freaking sour seed called mam or something, papaya, cherry tomatoes, fish sauce, and some other Thai stuff that I don't know. Anyway, the flavor is just straight from the beach of Phuket or chang mai. \\n\\nThat's another thing, I might be bashing on those wings because I've never been to Chang Mai, so if I'm wrong then please correct me!\\n\\nMango Alexander- it's like a Thai style Mango Lassi. If you like Mango Lassi, then do you this! You don't get a lot for $11, but the flavor is good. I wouldn't get it again unless I'm really craving, because it literally is like lassi. The menu says its made with vodka, coconut cream, and mango juice. \\n\\nPrice- more expensive than Thailand and southern California price. \\n\\n\\nService- it was a tad less than mediocre. We got seated outside and had to ask for water 3 times and the utensils werent ready and never ready so we had to be real Thai people and eat with our fingers. All waiters are white, so don't stereotype too fast. I would like it if our waiter explained more about the menu to us. Whatevez service 2.5/5\\n\\nDecor/ambiance- I don't know what the Thai lady was singing but their music was good! It sounded classy and cultural. The table cloth is a simple Thai street style cloth that has lotus flowers on it. Reminds me of any hood Asian outdoor decor. The walls are strung with simple yellow lights, Like any other Portland hip place. Theres a heater outside above each table so you don't eat and freeze.

My 2 siblings and I ordered the large calamari, 2 entr√©e sized aglio olio, and an entr√©e sized seafood combo pasta dish. Here's the rundown:\\n\\n- Calamari: For a large size, this cost us $24 + extra $$ for marina sauce. What the heck? I don't remember them charging extra for sauce so this must be new or I really wasn't paying attention before. The portion was also very small to be considered a \\"large.\\" I used to think the calamari here was top notch but this time, taste was bland. Seems like they don't use any seasoning in their batter anymore.\\n- Aglio olio: Squid ink pasta, specifically this dish (they have 3 variations), was the main reason I kept coming to the Daily Catch because not many other places have it. Thank god this dish didn't change taste-wise. Still rich in flavor thanks to the excessive olive oil and garlic used. I love my pastas al Dente and somehow these noodles are always perfectly cooked. The only change is that they cut the entr√©e size in half and charge you the same price. \\n- Seafood combo pasta: My siblings and I decided on this dish because it is basically the Fra Diavolo without the lobster and we didn't want to get our hands messy that night (they were headed to CT right after dinner via the Peter Pan Bus). The waitress told us the dish came with clams, mussels, squid, shrimp, and scallop and spicy tomato sauce (you can choose your sauce). This was the only dish that they did not skimp on in terms of proportion. There was a good amount of seafood on the plate except that there was exactly one shrimp and one scallop in the entire thing which my sister hogged because she doesn't like clams or mussels. The dish again proved to be bland because the sauce fell flat- I did not taste the sweetness from the tomatoes nor did I taste any heat that I was promised. \\n\\nI'd like to say I won't return but the aglio olio is too addicting to stay away from. It's so good that even locals like me not only overlook the disheveled appearance of the restaurant and subpar service but are willing to wait ~1hr outside just to get our hands on it.

No need to be ushered into a seat. So I sit at the bar and am faced with the woman behind the bar who seems completely overwhelmed/confused/maybe she just snapped? She doesn't acknowledge my friend or I for a good 5 minutes. She doesn't acknowledge anyone, for that matter. She was maniacally labeling bottles behind the counter while mumbling to herself. I looked around the dining hall to see 2 different tables looking rather bored and unfed; they had been there longer than me and still seemed to not have received any attention from the ONLY server in the place.\\nShe finally seemed to notice us sitting there, quickly gave us water and a plate of bread, and ran off into the kitchen, without asking us whether we wanted a drink or an appetizer. \\nAfter a quick run around the entire cafe, she came back and continued to talk to herself behind the counter until I finally interrupted her to place our order. She was incredibly nice, but seemed to be functioning on a completely different level. Our food was served by the cooks, who were attentive and friendly. Again, delicious food. While we were eating, I noticed a couple come into the cafe and stand there (I dont think they saw the seat yourself sign) for about 5 minutes. There was also a table waiting for a check. And two tables waiting to order. Lady behind the bar looked up, mumbled something, and kept unloading the dishwasher. Oblivious. The couple ended up leaving. A girl from one of the waiting tables came up to the bar, but the woman didn't seem to notice, ran off into the kitchen, and came back with ice water for the tables. \\nDinner and dessert were done in less than 40 minutes. When we walked out of there, there were still several tables that hadn't been attended to and they had been there longer than we had. \\nSummary: awesome food. weird vibes. horrible service."},{"name":"Lisa's Family Pizzeria","address":"2312 Main St","city":"Tewksbury","stars":"4","text":"Lisa's is an office lunch staple.

This place is perfect for that. \\n\\nAs a Yelper, I did my due diligence and read up on Java Monkey before going. I was alarmed at the reviews saying that it was dirty, but was also kind of intrigued. To my surprise, my first impression was a positive one. The barista who got my coffee for me was very friendly and welcoming, and right off the bat, I liked this place. On top of that, the coffee was good (smooth, not burnt, not too acidic) and the soy milk I asked for as creamer was free of charge! \\n\\nVegan options besides the coffee drinks include: Arden's Garden smoothies, bottled waters and sodas, pie (it was apple pie today), banana carrot muffins, chocolate cake thing, and other sweet treats. They also had Zapp's chips in various flavors. I'm not sure which are vegan and which aren't because I didn't read them, but just know that's an option. In terms of real food, they had salads which I am sure they are \\"vegan-izable\\" and I believe I saw a vegan panini on the menu as well.\\n\\nIn terms of the atmosphere... the space felt cozy and was a bit grungy. I wouldn't say \\"dirty\\" because it wasn't dirty. It's a kind of a nomadic retreat... or like a cafe setup you might see at Coachella without the scantily dressed people and desert heat, if that makes sense (which it probably doesn't). Anyways, it was grungy and reminded me of the cafes I used to frequent in Berkeley (California). The chairs inside were wobbly (I tested two of them) and I was worried that if I leaned back too far, they would buckle... so I didn't lean back at all.

I went to Neptunes first then a week later here to Island Creek. \\n\\nI'm from California so pardon me and my touristy lingo. And BTW Quincy and Boston thanks for having me. It was an awesome trip. \\n\\nI took the subway there. The stop is roughly 30 feet from Island Creek. Island Creek is in the nicer part of town it felt like. I get inside and the place is nice. Nice decor and lighting. They have a giant bar that wraps around the whole side of the place. So I get in and I said Id wait for a spot at the bar to open up. I ended up waiting around 15 minutes. But one of the bartenders noticed and I had asked him if he could let me know when a spot opened up. I forgot his name but this gentleman was very helpful with all things behind the bar including the food and beverages. He was very friendly and really just made my day. I dint know if he still works there but he had a pony tail and had more of a tan skin tone. But if he is bravo to you sir! So after a spot finally opened up the bartender let me know and I sat down. \\n\\nI just pretty much let the bartender know that I wanted. That was a dozen oysters of his choice, appetizer, main and beer to go along with them. So he picks out the oysters. I have the list at home. I know I had some Kumamotos, blue points and malpeques. All the oysters were of the highest quality and the freshest. All there tastes were distinctive from the other. The garnishes were good too. The bartender was informative on how the oyster would taste. So the dozen was a home run. I had an Allegash White to go along with them and it was superb. Next up was the clam chowder the bartender suggested. It was very good. I remember it having bacon and it went really good with it. It clam chowder was not overwhelming either. In my opinion it ranks high up their on my list of clam chowders (falling short of the Cannery Row chowder over in Monterrey CA and no I'm not being a biased asshole its just what I think). So after engulfing the chowdah the bartender brings out a complimentary app which was a sort of pork belly bite with sauce. That was delicioso! He also threw in a beer. A red I believe told me it was on him since I wanted to keep going with the belgiums. It was tasty. I enjoyed. So then out came the main. He ordered me the halibut with risotto. Man oh man. This fish was the dish. It was perfectly cooked. Very light and buttery. The fish couldn't go better with that risotto than peanut butter and jelly. Risotto was perfectly cooked and tasted excellent. So after that I told him one more beer and I went with (his suggestion) Seison Dupot. Now Delirium Tremens is my favorite beer of all things holy. Saison Dupot is a close second. This was my first time having it and it it was delicious. HE even poured it into the glass then swirled the last bit of it for that extra creamy head. This bartender was firing on all cylinders. No dessert cause I was stuffed at this point. But this was by far a 5 stars."},{"name":"What's Brewin' Cafe","address":"198 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"CASH ONLY! really?\\nThe cappucino was ok, not a whole heck of a lot of espresso flavor.

I gave them two stars just because I know it's the same owner and the ambience is .. cool. Now everything else about this review won't be so cool. I have been a server at many low-end to high end sushi places so I'm really patient and understanding with service when it comes to these places, butttt this was awful. \\n\\nI made a reservation for a birthday and since we were seated at the high tops in the bar near the entrance I had to sneak the cake into the place without him seeing. I told the hostess this and that the birthday guy was right by the stand. She said okay. So when our bill came, I looked over at my boyfriend wondering where the cake was. He went to ask and she attempted to hand him the cake in the bag as if for him to bring it over, light it up and serve the table. He obviously asked them to do it. Because, who does that? On top of that, the table was filthy when they bought out plates and soup spoons. Yes, soup spoons for cake. At this point, I was over this place. You don't charge $$$ and treat your customers like an inconvenience especially on special occasions. There were many hiccups like this through the night, like when we said we ordered 1 salmon skin roll and the runner told our server, he yelled out behind the bar, \\"Yeah, they ordered 2 but whatever just put it back on their table\\". Rude.\\n\\nSo there's my essay about service now here's the food review. If you're wondering if the value is worth the drive up north to Cedar Park, it is. They charged 14$ (that's like charging 14$ for an eel cucumber roll) for a salmon skin roll that I didn't finish. Server said it's not on the menu but they could whip it up, wished he would have said no because it was overly salty with no crisp and for that pricing, dude just take my arm instead. We did all the rolls on the menu, the Uni pasta and some appetizers. In general, more on the saltier palate but nothing special in general. The truffle tuna roll is good, definitely would recommend. The Uni pasta didn't have truffle on top but this is their most consistent dish, very rich and savory. \\n\\nHonestly, I wanted to support this establishment but it was one thing after the other.

The decor is simple but very nice, and we had good service. I liked that they had a variety of options of savory and sweet breakfasts. I ordered the salmon eggs benedict, and they were just alright. The hollandaise tasted like it was made from some type of mix, it did not taste fresh and rich, and the English muffin wasn't toasted enough which made it get soggy from the egg and sauce very quickly. If you're a big fan of eggs benedict like myself, I'd invite you to look elsewhere.

If you don't care for all of the extras, then I recommend just going for the lunch as the sushi variety is great.\\n\\nI wasn't a huge fan of the sushi, I'm not gonna complain about the size, because it's all you can eat people, and picky people are wasteful (like I can be sometimes). The sushi flavors were cool - like the rainbow roll has fruit in it and was very refreshing. Th other rolls, not really my favorite. I don't know how to describe it accept it just doesn't meet my standard for amazing sushi. But again, it's a buffet.\\n\\nBefore you judge the rest of my review, please keep in mind, this place is only a BUFFETT. :) they do make some special rolls for you as needed, but you come here to eat your sushi, lobster, crawfish, crab leg, Sashimi loving soul food! \\n\\nThe ginger soy sauce was awesome - Definitely recommend you try it. They also have their own spicy mayo which was quite tasty.\\n\\nThe veggies are lacking here. Unless you go to hibachi or like them raw in a salad, not really your go to for variety.\\n\\nThere were at least 30 different types of sushi and the fish variety was great. There was also a good bit of vegetarian rolls.\\n\\nThe sushi line is usually the longest. The next would be the meat section where you can get fish variety and crab legs.\\n\\nJust as the other reviewers have mentioned, the place stops serving at 8:30. They do not do to go boxes, and they have signage everywhere to tell you their rules, so no need to question it. \\n\\nI had the crab legs, which were great for a buffet, and I definitely tried the crepes, they weren't the most amazing crepes ever, but the bananas are fresh and they do chocolate and whip cream :)\\n\\nThe service was great at the beginning. We did not have to wait long even with a line to be seated. Once we were seated, our server brought us water and asked for extra drinks. After that - it got crazy and I understand why we didn't see our server.\\n\\nAll in all, for the price and variety, plus quality of the food, I say do it.

The chicken was tender, curry broth was light with enough spice to it.  I was the only one in my party to have tried kao soi before so I was happy others enjoyed this dish as well!! \\n\\nGreen curry with fish ball - this hit the spot- the curry was perfect, noodle and fish cake were good ..awesome with some sticky rice.  \\n\\nYam Tuna and Steak Salad - the portions of both of these were small, they were a little pricy, and I could have done without both.  They did have a nice flavor  - the yam tuna reminded me a little of a papaya salad.  \\n\\nTamarin seafood soup - the table was split on this one - a couple really liked it, others found it too sour / spicy to be able to savor and enjoy.  It definitely helps to cleanse the palate!\\n\\ndrinks:  Everyone was very happy with their cocktails, beer IPAs and drinks.  I was curious what a \\"drinking vinegar\\" was and decided to try a pineapple one.

I ordered a teriyaki chicken rice bowl, and being a newbie to Freshii, I asked for it to go.  The cashier told me that all items were in to-go containers, so I inquired if they are able to warm up the food, and the cashier assured me that they are.  Since it was during the lunch rush, I patiently waited for at least five minutes for my food.\\n\\nWhen I received my food, the plastic top of the container was warm, misleading me to believe that the contents were also warm. The contents of the bowl, which mostly consisted of rice soaked in \\"teriyaki\\" sauce,  resulting in a gooey, mushy texture, was barely lukewarm.  The Gew√ºrztraminer I had at the Libra Room was warmer than the slop in the bowl!\\n\\nNot impressed, I went up to the cashier and asked for it to be warmed up again.  They took my food, and 30 seconds later, it was \\"ready\\".  Suspicious, because there was no way that they could have properly heated it up in that short a time span, I took my food back to my table, and surprise surprise, the food wasn't any warmer.  So I asked for them to warm it up \\"again\\".  Well, same result, as expected.\\n\\nSure, I could have simply taken the food back to the office and heated it up in the microwave in the lunch room, but I refuse to pay $8 for something that is cold and disgusting.  And after my experience at Arturo's the week before, I was in no mood to pay over $8 for cold food [that has a reasonable expectation of being warm].\\n\\nSo I went up to the cashier and politely, but firmly demanded a refund.  She said she'd get the supervisor/manager to issue a refund, but instead she came back with a card for a free meal.  Um, NO.  \\n\\n1. I wanted a REFUND.\\n2. She said she'd get a manager to issue a REFUND.\\n\\nMaybe I'm mistaken, but isn't a REFUND when you GET YOUR MONEY BACK?  Getting a voucher is not a REFUND.  And how would it be a \\"free\\" meal if **I've already paid for it?!**  It would be a \\"free\\" meal if they issued me a REFUND and then gave me a voucher.  Also, I had no desire to ever eat there again.  I stood my ground and once again, demanded a REFUND.  The cashier went to get a supervisor, presumably, and came back with a guy sporting a neck tattoo.\\n\\nNeck Tattoo couldn't comprehend why I refused the voucher for a \\"free\\" meal, and only after repeating myself several times that I wanted MY MONEY BACK, did he comply.  Trying to stall and make things as difficult for me as possible, he asked me for my receipt.  Because I had paid in cash, I didn't bother getting my receipt, nor was it even offered to me.  He said that he \\"needed\\" a receipt to issue a refund.  Seriously?! \\n\\nI told him what I had ordered--surely he could punch 1 x teriyaki rice bow into the fucking cash register and hit refund, right?!--but he made a big production of having to find the transaction in the computer since I didn't have my receipt, asking me several times what I had ordered.  *sigh*\\n\\nAfter several minutes of stalling, he finally figured out how to issue me a refund/realized that I was not going to back down on my refund, and issued me my refund.\\n\\nThe rice bowl was $7.89 + tax, for a total of $8.28, so I had given $10.30, and received $2 in change.  So I was confused when Neck Tattoo gave me a refund of $10.30.  Now, I should have just taken that and left, pocketing the extra $2, but annoyed at the whole situation and taken aback by the utter stupidity, I told him that my refund should be $8.30.  He didn't quite understand the concept of MATH, and said, \\"but it says you paid $10.30, so your refund is $10.30.\\"  OMG.  I'm not fucking kidding you.

Why? Mad Mex has one of the BEST specials known to mankind. EVERY night of the week after 10pm, food is half off. It's one of those beautiful things that you only find once in a great while and hold on tight when you do. We had practice on South Campus every Wednesday conveniently from 7 UNTIL TEN. We were hungry. It was 10. It was a match made in heaven. \\n\\nI've heard a lot of mixed reviews from friends outside of our Mad Mex Cult Circle, and quite a few aren't psyched on the food but to them I say, you are a crazy maniac. They use refreshing ingredients from the normal greasy, canned, limp fare found at many Mexican restaurants. Mad Mex is modern and inventive with their cuisine (yes, CUISINE) plus they draw a cactus on top of your burrito in hot sauce so if that doesn't say ART to you, then you're a lost cause with no appreciation for the finer things.\\n\\nBut seriously, they have a delicious crispy tofu appetizer sprinkled with peanuts, portabellos as a protein option, and BLUE cornbread that is to die for. The wingo wrap takes your favorite finger food and puts them in a wrap with other tasty things and they even take their tofu and toss that around in your favorite buffalo sauce if you're not a chicken wings kind of guy. Or girl.\\n\\n$6 frozen (or on the rocks) margs and they always have an exciting special flavor (right now it's passion fruit!), but that's not say exciting always equals...good. Typically the waiters have warned against certain flavors and even let me sample before ordering a tall glass and learning the hard way. They've really got your back at the Mex.\\n\\nMy friends have been known to take shots of the ranch dressing as well as buy tubs of it to take home. I am not joking. We always order a side of ranch with our chips and salsa. Speaking of which, sit at the bar, and the chips and salsa are complimentary SHHHHHHH.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is just the right mix of not-crappy music (not Mexican either) and I'm often SoundHounding one song or another. This is where I discovered Gary Clark Jr before he hit the big time and went on tour with Kings of Leon, folks, so it was a pret-ty big deal. The lights are low, the candles are lit, and the wall colors are bright.\\n\\nThe bathrooms are fun - when are bathrooms fun? But they are.\\n\\nThis is turning in to a love letter to Mad Mex and I don't care, they've done so much for me. They've taken me in after seeing Blackfish at the Gateway. They've fed me when I had a long day. They've given me happy juice when I turned in 8 job applications.\\n\\nI love Mad Mex."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"For our 1-year wedding anniversary, I turned to the Yelp community for their recommendations on an appropriate place to celebrate.  I got well over a dozen suggestions of fine eateries in the metro-ATL area.  After reading through reviews and looking over menus, we selected Kevin Rathbun Steak.  We were very excited for this and made reservations (being sure to mention that it was for our 1-year anniversary).\\n\\nOn our arrival, we valeted our car and checked-in at the hostess station.  To our dismay, we were seated at a table right next to the bar, where we spent the remainder of our dining experience conversing over the drunken shouts of patrons as they watched the Georgia Bulldogs football game.  Bummer.\\n\\nOur waiter was lackluster - with the personality of a cardboard cut-out... not sure if he was tired, depressed, or simply bored.\\n\\nAt least the food, which we had heard rave reviews about, could save the night, right?  Not so much.  I really could have had a better steak at national chains like Longhorns or Outback (and for a fraction of the price) - not exaggerating.  I've had excellent steaks from affluent steakhouses before... this wasn't even close.  The twice baked potato?  Boring.  The peppercorn (au poivre) sauce?  Very bitter - I sent it back.  At least they were so kind as to give us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary - and THAT was tasty.  Oh, and the wine selection was just fine - we enjoyed the wine.\\n\\nOverall, we were left unimpressed, out well over $100, and wishing we had gone elsewhere.

We ordered the Kai Yaang (whole bird for $11) and the Papaya Pok Pok ($8) for the main meal with sticky rice and ate everything with our fingers.  We had a wonderful polynesian desert but unfortunately that's not on their online menu for me to share here. We split the food and ate \\"family style\\".  The Papaya Pok Pok was nothing like I'd eaten before and had a lovely, lightly fishy taste to it with an added pow of spicy.  The game hen was cooked just right, moist, and was just amazing in their sauce.  The portions are fair and it's clear that for Pok Pok presentation is just as important as taste.  A wonderful experience overall.\\n\\nI would have given Pok Pok a 5 star rating except it was somewhat confusing getting a table (was told the wait would be fifteen to thirty minutes; when I went back fifteen minutes later to ask I was told the same thing).  I was also a little frustrated because I was thirsty (after an afternoon of hard work in the garden) and asked for some water while I waited, \\"Could I grab some on the table there?\\"  \\"No,\\" she answered, \\"That's for customers.\\"  I said, \\"We are going to be dining here,\\" but she wouldn't allow me to even serve myself a cup of water.

At first, I couldn't buy anything.  I was just too overwhelmed by the place.  How do you pluck ONE book off of some random shelf when everywhere you look there are more books than you could read in a lifetime?  How do you even FIND a book if random isn't going to do it for you?  I found myself grabbing a magazine or something with a cover blurb promising that it was in the New York Times bestseller list, and then retiring to the coffee shop in hopes of fortification, where I was surprised that the service was substandard every time (barristas who are not exactly surly but definitely uninterested in their customers is nothing new; I just expected more, somehow; lots of fevered book talk, maybe, standing as we were in the bookstore to end all bookstores?).\\n\\nEventually, I learned that the coffee shop is staffed as an independent business and that, by contrast, Powell's information people are sincerely interested in providing information.  It got easier.  And then began the phase during which I overbought.  It seemed that a book was special just because it was IN Powell's and I'd get it home and wonder what had possessed me to ever buy it. \\n\\nNow, years later, I'm a more seasoned and happy Powell's customer.  I bring my used books down from Seattle to sell and go home with just a couple books that I have every reason to expect to be interested in.

Nothing to write about here except that the staff is knowledgeable and quick, service is attentive and clean.\\n\\nFood: 4/5\\nIs it authentic? Yes, for the most part it very much is. The flavors are very similar to what I remember from Thailand. Is it the best Thai food in the states? Not close, that food is in Chicago but that's far away. Is it the best Thai food in Portland? Perhaps. I haven't made the effort to try everything Thai in PDX as I have for Mexican food, but I'll get there someday.\\n\\nIn short, my gripes are not with any of the above. The food is good. The service is excellent. My gripes are with one thing: the price and the plates one receives for said price. In essence, Pok Pok is absurdly overpriced. \\nTo illustrate why this is a fact I will offer you a single dish, the \\"Sai Us Samun Phrai\\" (Chiang Mai sausage). This dish costs $12. It consists of the following: ONE (1) sausage (a normal sized sausage, perhaps an inch thick and five inches long), two thin slices of squash, approx. six crispy pork rinds each the size of a nickel, approx. six small green beans tied into knots each the size of a quarter, a slice of cabbage and a bit of green chile dip.\\nI will repeat this as it bears repeating: for twelve dollars you bought a single sausage. O.n.e. sausage. And some nibbles. No rice. No nothing. It's almost like the folks in the kitchen wanted to put at the very least a second sausage on the plate because no one in their right mind would pay twelve dollars for a single sausage but the Pok Pok god was like \\"NO!, one sausage for twelve dollars! What do you think this is, Thailand? Put some mediocre nibbles and a piece of cabbage on that plate! Basic green cabbage! Ta da! It is full of food now! Oh... no rice! Make them pay $2.50 for sticky rice. Excellent...\\"\\n\\nBut people will pay nearly anything if they think it's worth it. Unfortunately, the cuisine at Pok Pok is simply not worth it anymore. It was at one point, no doubt, but that time has passed.

I'm so amazed by how much Tech Ridge has really expanded in the past few years- and Zed's has the potential to be truly amazing. The location is great- lots of parking, a great water feature in the front and back, beautiful patio (can't wait for the cooler weather to give that a try!!) and ample seating inside. We made a reservation for Sunday at 11 am on Open Table. When we arrived, the restaurant was not that busy and had maybe 2 other tables seated. By the time we left they had started filling up a bit more and the jazz band was setting up. The service was great and friendly.\\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered spicy bloody marys and my parents ordered mimosas. We were all happy with our drinks- although let me tell you now that if you order a spicy blood mary, they do NOT play around- it will be very spicy!! I enjoyed it but I could see how it might throw someone else off. The coffee was also very good.\\n\\nWhere Zed's loses stars in my opinion is the food. I found their brunch menu to be a bit all-or-nothing in that you can either order something savory, or something ridiculously sweet, but not something that's fairly balanced. I'm a sweets gal but the waffle and french toast options just sounded a bit too sweet. I was intrigued by the Pecan Street Bananas Foster Toast but felt that might work better as a dessert for the entire table to split. I went ahead and ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken and Waffles. The waffle was pretty good and the TX Whiskey\\ncream sauce was delicious. But I just could not eat the Chicken Fried Chicken. It was overcooked and rubbery. The breading slid off as I tried to cut the chicken into bite size pieces and it was really hard to enjoy with the waffle. I barely ended up eating half of it. My parents both ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and loved it, and my husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs, which he enjoyed but was not crazy about the gravy.\\n\\nOverall, we had a great time and will be back, but I would say this is a place you come to enjoy the drinks and ambiance and not necessarily the food."},{"name":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews","address":"250 Granite St, Unit 1094E","city":"Braintree","stars":"2.5","text":"Food is ok, service is pretty slow, and I found a hair in my drink.

They also were out of Titos, Grey Goose, and Ketel One and considered Absolute their top vodka selection.  I would also like to thank the bartender for adding a wedge of lime and lemon when I ordered no fruit.  Similarly the bartender knew nothing of tequila and my buddy needed to point out the proper bottle of Milagro tequila.  At least he could properly serve a bud light and mix cranberry and soda water.

I don't know how often the menu changes, and on the off chance that it's no longer on there, it's Benedict using crab cakes topped with one of the creamiest and perfectly spiced hollandaise sauces I've ever had.  I say spiced because it's a Creole hollandaise and that little bit of extra heat sets off the light and flaky bits of crab and crisped edges of the cakes incredibly well.\\nThe Dutch baby is wonderful as well.  A tremendous portion for one person.  I can honestly say I remember the two hour sugar high from it more than almost any other part of the brunch.  \\nI'm not the sort to drink lattes, I prefer black coffee, but their foamy coffee drinks are good enough to tempt me away from coffee so thick you can chew it.\\nThe customer service I've always gotten there, from the first time, is what has kept me going back.  The only hiccup was when the staff thought our food was taking too long.  We were chatting and enjoying ourselves and our drinks when our server brought us a plate of dried fruits (strawberries, figs, other delicious things) to munch on and offered genuine apologies.  At no point had we indicated that we were in a rush, impatient, of felt as if anything was wrong.  The staff took the initiative and ensured that there would not be a problem before one ever occurred.

Noodle was softer and thinner to compensate for the suitableness of the soup flavor.  \\n\\nI had to ask the manager about the soup and the noodle after my Ramen, and he told me that they cook the soup for more than half a day, which was a great insight since every Japanese knows that Ramen soup is incredibly difficult to make from scratch and takes a long time, some over 1.5 days.  Noodles are custom made using the Kukai recipe of Japan by a company in Cali, and delivered up here, non-frozen. Fantastic.\\n\\nI will be coming back here for my Ramen fix for sure!  Hats off to Kukai for bring authentic Japanese Ramen to the Northwest!"},{"name":"Wei Wei Pan Asian Eatery","address":"9226 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place.

I had a small celebration with a group of friends here over the weekend and truly loved the atmosphere, sevice and food. One friend and I arrived early, around 3pm, sat at the bar and ordered from their bar lunch menu. We started off with their fries which were fabulous: right out of the fryer and crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. They were coated in a light dusting of chili powder. Excellent! We also enjoyed some wine by the glass which was decent. For a lunch entree, I ordered the cheese burger, which was served with pickles and more of the delicious fries. My friend very much enjoyed the lamb canneloni. The portion was quite large and it was presented in a beautiful cast iron skillet. As more friends began to arrive, we sampled more from their menu and half way into our meals, the bar menu transitioned from lunch to dinner. With the transition to dinner the servers brought out delicious baskets of breadsticks to line the bar. These were excellent, with a light cheese flavor. We also ordered the selection of sausages which everyone enjoyed and the cheese plate. While I greatly enjoyed the fries and my burger, I was a little disappointed with the cheese plate. It included only three cheeses (one a blue cheese, one  soft cheese and one hard cheese similar to manchego along with a membrillo like chutney).  The portion was rather small (unlike everything else we sampled). Also,  the  cheese plate came with cranberry and walnut bread (just a note for those like myself with a nut allergy). I wish they had mentioned this on the menu or before serving it because of my allergy. I would have liked the option to order another type of bread. However, plain bread for all was also provided with our entrees.  We were served by two waiters/ bartenders who were great, always checking in with us and allowing us to linger at the bar for sometime without rushing us along. Around 3 it was fairly slow but things started to pick up as we were leaving around 6:30. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back. The atmosphere is great with mirrors lining the walls and some French posters, but it's not over-done or cheesy. Prices were fairly reasonable for the lunch and dinner bar menu selections with few entree selections over $15.

The restaurant itself is very tastefully decorated, and the wait staff are all dressed in beautiful authentic Thai outfits, which is a really nice touch.  The food was awesome.  I tried the Thai Pad Thai and the Jungle Curry with Fish. Pad Thai is usually not my favourite dish (I usually find it too sweet) but this version was amazing - it is Tamarind (not ketchup) based and well spiced. Before putting our order in, the waitress warned us that the Jungle Curry was VERY SPICY and tried to steer us toward another option, but we could not be swayed and ordered it anyway.  It was delicious, but she was not exaggerating when she said it was much hotter than your typical Thai curry - if you do not have an incredibly high spice tolerance (luckily I do) you'll want to skip this dish!  For the quality of the food I thought the prices (average $12-16 per dish) were fair, and the portions were appropriate (though I would have liked a larger serving of rice for the curry).  Service was overall excellent too.  I will definitely be back."},{"name":"Velas","address":"7316 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down, the best tacos in Portland.

When we tried them there we had no idea that they were a growing chain and everyone had a great sub so I was excited when we found out that they had a location near us.  My wife and I loved our subs in NMB and my son and daughter both were in love with the custom drink machine where you can mix coke flavors together.  I believe he used the phrase, \\"greatest invention ever.\\"  Our subs in NMB were tasty and filling and none of us were hungry again for hours.\\n \\nSo one day I was near Polaris and thought I would give the local Firehouse Subs a try.  With their commercials playing constantly on the radio I was in the mood for a nice lunch.  I could get a nice bite to eat, support former fire fighters... that's a win/win... right?\\n \\nTrying something a little different I ordered a steak and cheese sub with green pepper, a little bit of tomato and some mayo.  When my sub was brought to me and I pried open the bun to review the ingredients, I noticed that there was as much green pepper as there was steak.  Huh?  I had ordered a steak sub.  Had the steak fallen out somewhere?  I checked my table, the floor around me... nope, no missing steak.  I was probably served 2.5 oz of steak on a full length sub.  There was so much green pepper that most of my sub looked green instead of meat/steak color.  So I scrapped off about 75% of the green pepper, pushed the steak all to one side of the bun and had a tasty one-third sized steak sub.\\n \\nI considered complaining but it appeared that every Firehouse employee was a teenager.  I didn't see an \\"adult\\" in sight.  I had trouble believing that they would care I felt the steak sub was mostly steak-less.  And that's when I noticed that probably 90% of the people eating at Firehouse was also in their teens.  And everyone was making trip after trip to the custom drink machine.  No one was really paying much attention to the food but the custom drink machine was getting a work out.\\n \\nSo, I may or may not try this Firehouse subs location again.  The food preparation area was clean, the employees were friendly enough, and when I scrapped all of the steak to one end of the sub what I had was tasty.  But there are better choices locally.  I'm just not sure that this location is concerned about people my age, with kids, who want a good, filling sub that is worth the money paid.  But if you want to go all freestyle mix-master on your Coca-Cola... this is your place."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Warm raw food with their variety sauce.

We asked for oyster recommendations from the waiters both times. Zack, our waiter the first time I went, was great and friendly and I was happy with everything he recommended. The second time our waiter (never knew his name) suggested we try the west coast oysters (I forget the exact ones) that are plump and taste like chicken...wasn't crazy about those, but everything else was delicious. The menu changes from week to week, but over my two experiences had-- clam chowder, lobster rolls, corn meal crusted cod, scallops and the oh. so. amazing. cider donuts. Seriously delish.

The wait was estimated to be about 30 minutes and so we decided it was reasonable. At the time there were a few people at the counter behind the check in booth were finishing up. After waiting about 15-20 minutes, I noticed that the counter was cleared and ready for someone to be seated. I was expecting us to be called-- were we? Nope. What happened instead, you may wonder? A couple went up to check in and the hostess gave them the estimated wait time and then offered the counter to them-- which of course they took because that meant they didn't have to wait. That was one major annoyance I had especially because I went to inquire about the time when one part of the counter was being cleared and wasn't offered that spot! (it's cold waiting outside! grr.. ok done ranting) At least we had time to decide what we wanted so that we could just order right away.\\n\\nWhen we were finally seated inside, we waited longer than we should have to be visited by our server. The server wasn't very friendly either, didn't make much eye contact or even looked like he wanted to be there. We ordered the fish sauce wings, eggplant salad and pork stew. While we waited for our food to arrive, it was an interesting scene to observe. The servers were literally running from the dining areas back to the kitchen-- when someone tried to get their attention they would give them the \\"one second\\" with their finger and proceed to run off-- a tad unprofessional in my opinion. I understand if it happened once, but every time? running? brushing off the needs of patrons? \\n\\nOur food arrives, a different server brought our food and mumbles under her breath what the dish is-- really did not seem to care to be there. As she tried to quickly scurry away we stopped her and asked her if she could bring the rice we ordered. She comes back and nearly drops the bowl onto our table as well as a box of sticky rice that we didn't order.  \\n\\nEach dish came as they were ready, which I was completely fine with since we were starving and on a time crunch. First came the wings and the pork stew. I tried not to have exceedingly high expectations for these mythically delicious wings, but alas it was hard not to from all the reviews and websites talking it up. The verdict: they were ok. I was actually a little hesitant when I read \\"fish sauce\\" because fish sauce is so salty. My boyfriend reassured me that with all the other ingredients it should balance out-- but you know what? they were too salty.  The pork in the stew was very tender and with rice had a good flavor. I say with rice because the stew itself was so salty! I tried to avoid it really, and outside of the stew, the pork was good and the rice helped to soak up the saltiness. My favorite was the eggplant salad. The eggplant itself didn't look very appetizing but it had a great texture and flavor. All the flavors in the dish went very well together. \\n\\nWhen we were all done we tried to flag our server down, but he wasn't around! We waited and finally saw him and got his attention, but he merely patted my boyfriend on the shoulder and proceeded to run off. We didn't see him again for another 5-10minutes to flag down again. \\n\\nOverall, the food wasn't as great as it was hyped up to be and the service really needs some revamping."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"While the oysters are delicious and the bartenders are attentive, the service staff, if you sit at a table, is a bit slow and inconsistent.

My sister had ordered a drink at the bar and her martini was up right when we were being sat, so a waitress brought it over to our table. She then spilled a third on the table and a third  in my sisters water glass with no apology (to their credit she said it was an amazing dirty martini but too bad she didn't get to enjoy 2/3rds of it). We met our server then ordered the rest of our drinks. I got a tequila and strawberry martini of sorts. The waiter then spilled half on the table as well when he set it down. He said it was \\"his bad\\" but he never got another drink or refilled my now half empty drink (that cost $12). I awkwardly stared at a red drink stain for 97% of my meal. \\n\\nAdditionally my other sister (also celebrating her birthday) ordered a dirty martini because of the taste of my original sisters. When it arrived it didn't have blue cheese stuffed olives. When the second sister inquired, the waiter said they don't have blue cheese stuffed olives. My original sister interrupted and said yeah they did she had some in hers. He said they were out. He eventually admitted they were making more and he could bring some \\"if she really wanted\\" she said yes considering that was a big reason she ordered what she got. They eventually came halfway through the meal. Ugh.\\n\\nIt's not that I haven't had bad service before but when you are spending $150+/person (as our bill rounded out to with food and drinks, not including tip) you expect some semblance of service. I have been to similarly priced restaurants and have enjoyed this quality service and many lower cost options that have excelled in this area. It baffles me that a spilled drink by staff doesn't merit a fresh one and a towel down or some attempt of clean up of the table linens. For the record the restaurant was not swamped by any means. Personally as a former server in a restaurant that had reasonable expectations, I was appalled. Additionally toward the end of our meal all of a sudden our waiter was more on task. That last minute, before the check push felt very disingenuous (saying the birthday dessert was \\"on him\\") and didn't save our meal. \\n\\nI can barely reference the actual food because it was overwhelmed by the mediocrity of the service. The food was good, but for that price tag I want to be treated better. Not asking for an extremely high barometer, just a typical amount of  customer service that didn't exist tonight.

Fully understanding we had no reservation and no expectations, we inquired if they could kindly accommodate us for a 'quick' bite (it always helps to let them know this, all things considered). The man who spoke [down] to us, his oversized frame bloated with self importance, told us in the haughtiest tone he'd have to check and see, then stood looking down his nose through his reservation book, as the minutes passed (yes minutes). Now picture this; the restaurant had 4 tables occupying  the entire place. Very uncharacteristic for any decent restaurant on a Saturday night. However, this did not impede or dissuade what was to manifest into the worst type of snobbery and arrogance I've had the misfortune of witnessing. He stood there in front of us, not saying a word -aaawkward- perusing through every pixel of the reservation book, as we glanced back and forth to each other, fidgeting, and then back to \\"Him\\", the gatekeeper of ALL those empty tables. Eventually, he gestured that he could squeeze us in. When my guest asked where he might be seating us, he looked deadpan at her and replied \\"inside\\"... as God's my witness. Not surprisingly, at which point, I said to my guests I think we should leave.\\n\\nMaybe 'he' explains why, that on a Saturday night at the peak of 7:30, they had only 4 tables occupying the whole restaurant, while Steveston Seafood House and everyone else were packed full, standing room only. One thing's for sure, after 15 years of patronizing them I will never cross their threshold ever again. \\nEPIC FAIL Tapenade!!!\\n(And she told two friends, and they told two friends, and so on and so on...)"},{"name":"Rubino's Pizza","address":"2643 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Straight old school from the staff to the layout to the food.

Prompt, relaxed service. Saw the 'Triple D' episode, so, having a day-off, and a rainy one at that, I thought I would find out for myself. Ordered coffee, which was Stumptown - the best grind in town - and the Portland's Best Biscuits n Gravy. First thoughts were the portion - which was good sized - was not as gigantic as on camera. Next thought was, since I normally like a nice, liberal black-pepper presence in country gravy, that I thought it was shy on the pepper a bit. But then I realized that the rosemary was actually very well done and complimentary to the nice portion of sausage. The savory biscuits (sweet potato I think) would do well by themselves, had a nice taste as well as very light and fluffy. They did not take away any attention from the dishes identity.  The tenderloin pork slices were a nice addition, though could have been a scosh thicker. Again, it meshed well with the overall dish.  Overall, I still like a bit more pepper.

She recommended Island Creek because of its stellar rating & it's proximity to my hotel. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I was underwhelmed (as I believe was my friend). There were moments where it was quite good, but there were also some major misses in my book. \\n\\nOverall, things were a bit off when we walked in. I had a reservation for 8:30. We weren't seated for about 10 min. so they offered us a high top. The way that she framed it was just a bit off & this sense of something just being a bit off continued throughout the meal. \\n\\nOne service point that I would like to commend however was that after I ordered everything for my friend & me, the waiter actually noticed that we were going to share & made sure that all the plates were presented in a shareable format. They always had extra plates ready & the lobster roll came out on two separate plates. \\n\\nThe famous Lobster roe pasta was not available, which was a disappointment. I'm sure they get asked that question from basically every person that doesn't see it on the menu. \\n\\nThe meal starts out with free bread & butter. The bread was quite interesting. It seemed to be a more oily, foccacia-type bread, but it was also quite fluffy & a bit sweet. It was an enjoyable start to the meal. \\n\\nFor our appetizers, we ordered the oyster sliders and the special for the night, skate cheek. The oyster sliders were completed underwhelming. The brioche bun dominated the flavor profile, followed by the breading on the oyster so that you couldn't even really taste the oyster. We both eventually took the top off the bun & finished it that way, but the oyster taste still didn't come through. \\n\\nThe skate cheek was good overall. We were not  warned that we were getting the actual jaw & that there would be bones that we would need to pick out. It would have been a nice tip. There was also a nice slaw & umami-based sauce that accompanied the dish.\\n\\nThe two mains we ordered were the lobster roll (with mushrooms not fries as the side & the monkfish. \\n\\nThe lobster roll was one of the worst that I've had. The lobster filling lacked flavor or punch. The bread completely overwhelmed the lobster. It was quite hard to eat the bread with the lobster, while the goal should be to get a mouthful of all the flavors. The coleslaw was also not good. I left a fair amount of bread on the plate, which says something given the rate at which I normally devour baked goods. Given the high price point and better offerings elsewhere, I would recommend skipping this. \\n\\nThe mushrooms however were quite good (although the unmentioned onions were the standouts).\\n\\nThe monkfish was the best note of the meal. It was salted well and cooked to perfection with a golden crust on the outside. It was almost like having it melt in your mouth. The risotto underneath however can be skipped. The rice hadn't been boiled long enough and lacked flavor.

One more couldn't hurt. =) \\n\\nI LOVE reading books...it is one of my favorite pass times aside from eating and sleeping. If you find me outside of work you can bet that I have my face snuggled between the pages of some sort of book intently reading and ignoring all that is going on around me. On my recent trip to Oregon my friend recommended Powell's stating it was the most amazing book store ever. Enthusiastically I rubbed my hands together and with bated breath approached the doors ready to spend the next several hours basking in the ambiance of shoulder to shoulder books...old and new. \\n\\nWell...by the 3 star review you could say I was less than impressed. Sure they have a HUGE assortment of books. More than anyone could possibly peruse through in one day. To save myself time and some sanity I made a bee line for the orange section that housed my favorite genre of books...food. \\n\\nI guess the part I was least impressed with was the selection of used books. Every time I found a book that was interesting I found out that it was not only new but full priced as well. In search of more used books to satisfy my desire to learn the cuisine of the past I found myself lost in a sea of Rachel Ray and Giada deLaurentis. I found one book...an old Hawaiian / Japanese Buddhist Church cookbook from 1987...but that was it. \\n\\nOverall there was a good selection of books...but I was looking for more used than new and that wasn't what I found. The plethora of books also makes navigating the sections somewhat cumbersome. Due to sheer amount of aisles and shelves even though you comb over a certain section time and time again you can't help but feeling you missed something.  Perhaps with a better navigation or sorting mechanism one wouldn't feel so lost in such an abundance of knowledge."},{"name":"Casa Arandinas","address":"9001 Brodie Ln, Ste A3","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This must be the best Mexican food restaurant I've ever been to- and I owned a Mexican Restaurant."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The garlic tonkotsu is delicious af! 50% off tacoyaki every Tuesday.

Once he read the reviews about Pok Pok, specifically their Fish Sauce Chicken Wings, it's all he talked about FOR WEEKS! (It's true, you can't get pad Thai but I don't even LIKE pad Thai so it's no big deal.) \\n\\nWe arrived around 7pm on a mizzly, cold Thursday night to find a place that looked like \\"tent city\\" -which I learned is the Chef Andy Ricker's (a white guy) REAL house, yard and driveway, kinda like the rickety eateries you'd see along the road in Thailand- with a wait of about an hour and a half. WHAT? We were told we could go over to the Whiskey Soda Lounge, about a block away, and they'd call when our table was ready and YES, we could order the Fish Sauce Chicken Wings, so we ordered drinks and waited in anticipation. The menu says the recipe comes from the Vietnam home of Pok Pok's daytime grill cook: chicken wings marinated in fish sauce, garlic and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Phu Quoc fish sauce and garlic, and SPICY, holy cow, are these things FIERY!!! All you other Yelpers were right, DO NOT leave without tasting these wings. \\n\\nThe hour and a half passed quickly and we were finally seated back across the street at Pok Pok's, given menus and water. My niece commented about the water having a different flavor. It did taste to me like it had been filtered through something, like toasted rice maybe? Just a guess. Our waiter, Willie Dee (it said so right on the bill), was very busy but friendly and told us about the specials, took our drink order, and left us to drool over the menu. We decided to share four different dishes, plus rice. \\n\\nWhen trying a place for the first time, I usually like to try \\"signature dishes\\" and the Kai Yaang ($11) was perfect. A whole roasted game hen rubbed with lemongrass, garlic, pepper and cilantro served with a slightly spicy sweet and sour dipping sauce. This dish was voted second favorite by our group of four. I also ordered the sticky rice ($2) as suggested on the menu and it was equally as excellent. My only regret is that I didn't have the nerve to *cough* steal *cough* the cute woven container the rice came in as a souvenir. \\n\\nWe also shared a large bowl of Khao Soi Kai ($11.50), a mild curry noodle soup made with a (supposedly secret) curry paste recipe, natural chicken and house-pressed fresh coconut milk. This was accompanied by pickled mustard greens, shallots, crispy yellow noodles and roasted chili paste. We all agreed that this was the best dish of the night and wished we could take home a gallon container of just the broth. Warning: EXTREME DELICIOUSNESS! \\n\\nOur third dish was the Kaeng Hung Leh ($12): sweet pork belly & pork shoulder curry with ginger, palm sugar, tamarind, curry powder and pickled garlic. Except for the fat (which was a large portion of this dish) the flavors were classic Northern Thai. Got the coconut rice ($2.50) to go with it. \\n\\nLastly, my nephew-in-law, ordered the Muu Sateh ($8.50): pork loin skewers marinated in turmeric and coconut milk, grilled and served with a peanut sauce, cucumbers and grilled bread. Yes, grilled bread! It was good but not great. \\n\\nVery reasonable prices, total for all four of us (plus drinks, wings, & tip) was about $100. It was a hoot to take my niece and her hubby to a place 15 minutes from their house that they'd never been to! When we go back to Oregon -hopefully soon- Pok Pok will be another must visit again (and again & again) kind of place."},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"Totally average Italian food at an overpriced cost.

To say the Polaris location failed me on both accounts is a gross understatement.  When my wife and I walked in, there were a few indistinct murmurs that I think were supposed to be a greeting, and the famous cherry limeade tastes like Cherry NyQuil.  (I eventually added three times the number of suggested lime slices and it became palatable, but still left a medicinal aftertaste.)\\n\\nFortunately, the delicious pastrami sandwich saves Firehouse from one- or two-star territory.  I love pastrami, but it's pretty hard to find at delis around here, save the amazing Katzinger's.  The sandwich is pretty great here, with a rich mayo and toasty bread.  My wife loved her corned-beef sandwich and commented especially on the quality of the brown mustard.  I'm not sure but I think chips are the only side dishes offered; the selection is nothing special, similar to Quiznos with Miss Vickie's kettle chips, which are top-notch.\\n\\nThis isn't really a comfortable place to eat, I didn't think.  Our table was soaking wet, as if it's been cleaned and left to air-dry.  It felt kinda clinical with the black-and-white tiles.  The staff were friendly but didn't really seem like they quite had their stuff together.  One weird note:  I tried the men's bathroom door and it was locked, and while I was waiting for it to open up, a male staff member exited the women's restroom.  I hope he was cleaning it.\\n\\nAnyway, to sum up:  Great sandwich, bad drinks, weird environment.  If I get a hankering for pastrami and I don't feel like driving down to German Village, I might give Firehouse another shot.

Sometimes. Their quality is definitely not consistent. Being from Southern California, I don't think ANY of the Mexican places in Columbus are authentic. Anyway, Madmex has great vegan options. They offer vegan cheese and vegan sour cream, and both are delicious.\\n\\nThey have a pretty decent bar. If I am with my boyfriend only, we will often sit at the bar for dinner. We have received free chips at the bar occasionally. Actually, last time we went (last weekend) we were at a table and the waiter forgot to charge us for chips and salsa. I'm not sure if this was on purpose or not.\\n\\nI've had only a few of the items on the menu, but I always get the same thing now-- the tofu tacos, crispy, with no bean sprouts (they are always slimey), avocado, vegan cheese and vegan sour cream. It comes with black beans, which are spicy and delicious, and rice. It's usually quite tasty, but the last time I had it, it was eh, and it kind of made me sick. The amount of tofu they give you really varies. Sometimes I get a LOT and other times hardly any. \\n\\nIn general, the service is pretty good. I've had a few bad experience though. Last year my boyfriend tried to use a free birthday burrito coupon for an entree and they wouldn't let him! Super rude. They should have just taken $8 or whatever off our bill. \\n\\nThe front room (to the right when you walk in, and in front of the bar) is super annoying.

There's been so much hype surrounding this place (and my husband remembers when Pok Pok was a food cart and the food was amazing) that we had to go. \\nThe first time we went, the place was packed. We were seated at a really uncomfortable table outside where guests and servers were coming and going, coming and going. It was awkward and unenjoyable. Rule number one to all restaurant owners/managers--make every seat in the place comfortable at least. I don't want to have bad thoughts about your restaurant simply because I keep getting elbowed by people as they walk past.\\nService was, in my words, standard Portland service. Meaning: not particularly friendly, sort of begrudging, as if they had better things to do and more interesting places to be than helping you. I get it. I work in the foodservice industry, too. It can really suck. But that doesn't preclude being nice and professional.\\nWe had the lemongrass chicken, the fish sauce wings, and papaya salad. I can't say they weren't good, and maybe I wasn't blown away because they're the specialties of the house. Maybe the have to make so many of these dishes every night that the execution suffers. But to be frank, we've made better chicken at home in our crappy oven. Again, it wasn't at all bad, but when I go out I really want to eat something that I can't prepare as well at home. \\nThe fish sauce wings were pretty delicious. Can't deny that. But at over $2 a wing I felt a little taken advantage of. I mean, I'd pay that much for oysters, but for chicken wings? Maybe they're extra special free range organic or something. The menu calls them \\"natural\\" which as far as I can tell means approximately nothing. We also went home and recreated this dish to our satisfaction--of course it's going to taste amazing. Fried chicken coated in palm sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and lime wonderfulness.\\nThe papaya salad was also pretty good. I'm not going to tell you the food is bad here. That's not my beef with this place. My ultimate issue with Pok Pok is that along with fame and multiple incarnations and outposts of this place, just going to the restaurant, getting a table, and ordering food through crabby servers is really unpleasant. I almost get a \\"we don't want you here\\" vibe. And I don't expect every restaurant to be fine dining or have super comfy, secluded booths or anything. That's not the world we live in, and those things aren't terribly important to me. But to be made to feel like an imposition at your restaurant? Not cool."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Sat at the bar here recently and was so impressed with the knowledge and service level of the bartender.

We're not usually huge fans of Tex-Mex, largely because it's overhyped for the type of flavors you get. You don't generally enjoy EVERY single part of your meal at a typical Austin Tex-Mex place (don't lie: some of you only go to certain places for the queso), but Vivo completely broke our own stereotypes of what Tex-Mex could be.\\n\\nWe started with a couple of margaritas off the happy hour menu for $5 each (top shelf, no less), and were served some of the best tortilla chips and salsa I've ever had. Puffy, crispy and with the perfect amount of salt (my boyfriend usually pre-salts tortilla chips at restaurants -- no need to do so for these), they paired perfectly with a red salsa that had a nice kick. \\n\\nWe were able to sneak in one more round of drinks before our food came out: another top-shelf marg, plus a Vivo Ria -- their take on sangria that I'll admit confused me for a minute with the tequila and juices, but once squeezing a lime quarter in it tasted divine.\\n\\nMy boyfriend got the shrimp enchiladas, which were nicely sized shrimp with a green sauce that had a tiny bit of sweetness, plus retried beans and white rice with vegetables. I had the Cameron's Choice, which was a complete steal at $11.50 or so, with one chalupa (veggie) and one enchilada (chicken verde), plus retried beans and brown rice. The chalupa was crisp with a hefty serving of guacamole on top; the bean sprouts were really the star of this dish and gave it a beautiful texture. The enchilada verde sauce was something I could pour over anything: spicy, but mildly so, and complemented the chicken and rice perfectly. I love that each entree comes with different rice combinations -- they know what they're doing with pairing!\\n\\nFinally, we ordered dessert (and my boyfriend got a nice smoky mezcal shot). Our server, who was gracious and kept the water refills flowing our whole meal, in addition to checking on us for the end of happy hour, mentioned one of the desserts would be great for sharing. We opted for flan, which I don't think was on his \\"share\\" pitch, but was huge! It came with some blueberry and strawberry garnish and was the perfect end to our awesome meal.\\n\\nThis is one of the longest reviews I've ever written, but we had a great time at Vivo!

We arrived at around 7:30pm and there were three parties of three ahead of us. It was cold and wet out, which led us to be unsure about waiting on line, but we were seated in about a half an hour. A rude couple almost skipped us in line because they were too impatient to wait with everyone else once arriving at the restaurant.

If my friend and I weren't as hungry as we were, we could have done without the calamari. While lightly crispy and well-cooked, the amount we got was grossly overpriced. We both agreed we've had better from other places and cheaper too for an even bigger amount.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the shrimp, scallops, and broccoli which came with linguini in white sauce ($24). It was served right in the pan it was cooked in. She had nothing but good things to say about the pasta dish and recommends it.\\n\\nI ordered the Sicilian-style mussels ($10.75) off the appetizer menu to go with my appetizer portion of black pasta aglio olio ($14.50). I was surprised by how many mussels came in the bowl. It was super flavorful and the wine flavor was strong. Daily Catch is definitely known for their black pasta. While I liked the squid ink pasta dish, I probably wouldn't get it again because I found the oils to be overwhelming. \\n\\nOverall our experience at The Daily Catch was good and the restaurant does offer some unique items on its menu.
