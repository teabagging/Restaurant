The fried chicken was thin, almost transparent with dry pieces of freezer burned chicken patties cut in 4's and laid on top of odd pieces of lettuce that looked like yard clippings. The cheddar cheese was no where to be found on the salad and there were 3 tiny cubed tomatoes, that looked like they were meant for a taco, arranged on top. There was no egg or cucumber as listed on the menu. This salad was $13.00. \\n\\nMy friend got the BBQ sandwich and while he liked the cole slaw on top of the sandwich he would have loved having a choice. The slaw had a very sour vinegar taste and even though he scraped it off the sandwich the BBQ that was left on the bun had an odd milky white consistency.

Zucchini with enormous gashes, apples with big brown spots and holes, practically naked onions, heads of garlic torn apart and clearly missing several cloves. Most recently I was in on a Saturday afternoon. The apples were all but gone and the bananas were COMPLETELY wiped out. No employees to be found within the whole department.\\n- The prices.

There's also no AC, so I usually take my good on the go whenever the weather's a bit warmer. I would choose to go here over any other restaurant around Chinatown that serves similar items. I hope their business strive, but I just wish for a bit more meat!!

While we sat there, patiently waiting and not complaining, all the tables around us were seated, served and left. Finallllly, our food came out almost 2 hours after we placed our initial order. The food sucked & that is that. My friends & I were just soo over it, we ate a little bit of our food and just asked for the check since we wanted to get the hell out!! \\n\\nWhy am I giving this place 2 stars vs. 1?

It definitely wasn't worth it when I realized I had waited 25 minutes for the green beans to come out. The ambiance was bustling and noisy but that may have been due to the ongoing trivia night.

The lines were very manageable, and we were seated after about 15 minutes, which ain't bad for the weekend. This place is pure Portland, with a very casual, rustic vibe, mason jars everywhere, and a push for local/fresh ingredients. They really push the comfort food at an astonishing pace, and the menu is really stick-to-your-ribs-type stuff. The inside is sort of like a diner, but if it were inside a log cabin. There's some outdoor seating, which is nice, and there are tent covers and space heaters for when the weather's too cold, so you can still sit outside.\\n\\nWe each got our own Reggie Deluxe (fried chicken biscuit with gravy and an egg), and shared the hash ups with steak, which were like a bed of hash browns with onions, mushrooms, and thinly sliced steak. The Reggie D was everything I like in a fried chicken biscuit sandwich. The gravy was just the right consistency, the fried chicken was crispy and flavorful, the bacon was salty and rich, and the egg was the perfectly cooked. And the biscuit! The flakiness and buttery texture is really perfect, and the sheer size is enough to send you into a coma instantly. The hash-ups were great as well, and the thinly sliced steak and mushrooms were a perfect complement to the super crispy fried hash browns. We were just so full by the end of it that I'd actually recommend getting just getting a regular order of hash browns, without all the stuff on top. \\n\\nService was very attentive and friendly, and even chatted up with us a bit as we sat down outside. I'm pretty glad that PSB has expanded to other locations, so that the fabled lines have more or less died down. The prices are incredibly reasonable for the portion size, and I actually highly recommend getting the cider or orange juice, because I think the cold, sweet flavors pair well with the rich, delicious food they have. \\n\\nWill definitely be back to try the other things on the menu like the Chatfield or shrimp and grits, if I can tear myself away from the Reggie Deluxe. This was a place that really did live up to all the hype and is easily the very top of my list when eating in Portland."},{"name":"Jong Ga Korean Restaurant","address":"4333 North Road","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"Pork bone soup was pretty good compared to a lot of other places.

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner to celebrate Valentine's Day and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dishes. \\n\\nWe started off with drinks and decided to share a Gimme the Tea which was delightful. It tasted like a sweetened iced tea and went down very smoothly. I'm someone who prefers sweeter drinks so this one was perfect for me. \\n\\nAs scallops lovers, we just couldn't pass up the live scallop crudos and let me just say they were AMAZING. I was a little hesitant at first when the dish came out but wow was that scallop heavenly. It was served with tangerines which provided a sweet citrusy kick that balanced out the scallops perfectly. I had a hard time holding myself back from ordering 10 more plates but I'll probably do it the next time I come back!\\n\\nFollowing the scallops, we tried the mushroom crostini and Spanish octopus which were both solid dishes. The duck egg on the crostini was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms were extremely flavorful. I personally found the octopus to be a little bit on the saltier side however, it still had a great crunch to it which made it different from other version of octopus I've tried. \\n\\nFor our entrees, we decided to split two pasta dishes: the pappardelle and the paccheri. I'm going to be quite honest, these two dishes were actually the least favorite of mine for the night however I think I'm just an anomaly because my boyfriend enjoyed them both so much he happily finished both for us. The horseradish flavor was prominent in the pappardelle and unfortunately, it's just one of those ingredients that I personally cannot handle well but for those who enjoy horseradish, this is definitely your dish. Between the two, I enjoyed the paccheri a little more however I found the lobster flavor to be a little overwhelming after a few bites. Nevertheless, from an objective standpoint these dishes were both cooked perfectly and their flavors were well executed. \\n\\nTo end the night on a light note, we decided to grab their affogato which was great. The espresso was served nice and hot and was strong in flavor which I enjoyed. There was also a complimentary self-serve candy bar towards the front of the restaurant which was set up for Valentine's Day. Upon receiving our check from our server, we were given a little clear bag which he invited us to fill up at the candy bar. It was a cute little touch that I really appreciated. \\n\\nOverall, I can't wait to return.

The server we had was named Rodney. He did not introduce himself (only saw his name while paying for my bill at the front where the hostess was) he his greeting was \\" do you know what you want?\\". Very bothered by the fact he had to serve us. Clearly showed all over his face and with the casual one arm leaning on the table. After grabbing our order.

The female server came over and answers what we needed. Moments later we see her approach and talk to our server \\"rodney\\" to attend to our table. The female server comes back to our table with the plate and just tosses it at the table. We felt that the servers lacked engagement and acknowledgement. We tried to flag down our server once again for water replenishment and the drink that my friend ordered to be refilled. Our server never once came by to check on how we liked our food or what so ever. The only eye contact that I could get a hold of was once again that female server that tossed the place.

Few minutes later he returns in attempts to refill our water. At this end point of my dinning I was pretty much fed up with lack of service. My friends and I left our table and walked to the front and asked the hostess for our bill. The hostess was taken back by the fact I was up at the front asking for my bill and was concerned with why I was there. I said I was not happy with the service and just wanted to pay for my bill. She went and talked to the manager and returned back saying the manager will come to the front to bring the bills. NO MANAGER came to the front. It was our server (Rodney) that brought our bills and a terminal upfront. He did not ask if everything was okay and seemed to be unphased by the reason of complaint.

You choose your meat then pita, rice, hummus or salad then you choose your toppings (Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Cucumbers, Banana Peppers, Cabbage, Pickles) then choose your sauces (Garlic, Tahini, House, Tzatziki, Hot). What was good was they cooked the meat fresh, but if you need to go quick and go, it wasn't going to work for me.  They also have other Mediterranean food on the menu. The food was good, but there was confusion on how ordering works. There were many customers who came up after the fact to say they were never asked about a sauce or other things."},{"name":"Mo Better Chicken","address":"3929 Flat Shoals Pkwy, Ste 101","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"The guy who works there is rude, impatient and incompetent.

After OVER 30 MINUTES of waiting with no acknowledgement from the staff (even though they could clearly see us and everyone else waiting in the lobby!) we decided to leave.  From the time we entered until the time we left, no one was seated and as far as I know those people are still waiting in the lobby.  \\n\\nNow don't get me wrong, I understand that there is the potential for long wait times before you are seated, especially if it is at a popular restaurant.  However, There were plenty of empty tables.

The scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy and the bacon was good, but could have been crisper, it was bit too limp for my taste. The lemon ricotta blueberry pancakes were ok, but we're absolutely tiny and I don't think worth what they cost. The best part of the french fries was the dipping sauce.

The ceviche I received was little more than marinated veggies in what to me looked And tasted like Kroger-quality krab (as in fake crab, Pollock fish, ready-to-eat) that I could do at home, myself.  And that is not ceviche. Doesn't even come close. \\n\\nI was not impressed.  No, I retract that. La Casita did impress me enough to remember this visit 2 years later.  Only one other place in the Columbus area is worse, in my opinion.  \\n\\nSimply put, proper ceviche is this:. Raw seafood (your choice) marinated in line or lemon or some other tart citrus (my favorite is pineapple) juice until the seafood turns opaque. Add that to marinated veggies and choclo (Peruvian corn, not sweet corn), to taste. Whole dish takes about 10-20 minutes if done properly.

Locals know Redbones for solid barbecue in the dearth of barbecue that is Greater Boston. You can get swindled by the Coast Cafe or travel to the boonies (ahem, suburbs), or you can fork over $$$ for \\"BBQ-fusion\\" in Boston, so we're stuck with Redbones, and this is not a bad thing. The cheery, no frills interior, extensive beer list, and tasty ribs and brisket at this Davis Square institution meets all of your BBQ cravings. \\n\\nBoth the St. Louis Ribs (entirely blackened, but no have fear, they have a nice wetness to them), and the Baby Backs (the name evokes memories of sticky BBQ sauce, but they are served dry as well and you need to add some sauce to sweeten them up). The brisket was your average brisket - tender, with decent flavor. I would suggest ordering a combo so you can pick and choose between 2 or 3 BBQ items and 2 sides (roughly $23.00). For sides, the vegetarian beans are a highlight - as is the Mac n'cheese. I would recommend finishing things off with a slice of chilled pecan pie (~$6.00).\\n\\nThe interior is barebones with a colorful array of signage and plastic chairs. Seating is both upstairs and downstairs - we had no wait on a Wednesday at 6pm, but the place fills up quick on the weekend. Not a great place for a date unless she specifically requests barbecue and is wearing a t-shirt - or is your significant other and doesn't care if you get sauce on your face. \\n\\nOverall, Redbones covers all the bases and serves up the barbecue for your Greater Boston cravings."},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been here three times and each time is has gotten worse.\\n\\nMy husband and I really enjoyed our first experience with drinks and an appetizer at the bar and were excited to return.\\n\\nWe went again for two special occasions and were very disappointed.

However, the fish and chips came out much earlier than the taco, so my husband had to sit and wait for me to get my food - it was a good 10 minute difference in timing. My taco arrived and the presentation for both was great. They had said my fish taco would be two pieces of fish, but it was actually only 1 square piece of fish. If you can try to picture that on a taco, it made it very awkward. It was the same size and shape as the piece in the fish and chips. So two inches or more on each end of the taco had no fish and then I couldn't actually fold or wrap my taco. I ended up cutting the fish in half and reconfiguring out. Unfortunately, the sauce on the taco had soaked through the shell (the shell was tasty!) and my taco fell apart. I finished it with a fork. There were a lot of flavors, which was great, but the fish was way over cooked and lacked its own flavor. Fries were best part of it all.

We arrived around 3:30 PM so we had no problem getting a table. Upon notifying them that we had a groupon, they brought over a menu with all the food we would be getting and the suggested cooking time for each item (but follow them at your own risk - chicken definitely took more than the suggested time of 2 minutes). We had the half original and half spicy broth. The spicy was not as spicy as I expected it to be but it had a nice kick in the beginning. The spicy broth definitely lost its kick when they refilled it with the regular broth. You get to mix your own sauce at the sauce bar, which had soy sauce, vinegar, chilli oil, chilli paste, satay sauce and peanut sauce.\\n\\nI liked the szechuan-style kimchi becaused it was appetitizing and it had a very nice crunch to it. The meat were quite good considering we had a variety of different items like beef, lamb, chicken, prawn, and fish. I was actually surprised at the size of the prawn because they were much larger than I expected. The assorted meatball platter consisted meatballs made of shrimp, squid, pork, and beef. Although they were on the smaller side, they had a nice texture to them. I especially liked the shrimp balls. The pork and shrimp dumplings and the fish tofu were bland. The fish tofu tasted very fake. The udon was the regular udon anyone could get from the grocery store. I personally thought there was very little leafy vegetables in terms of variety and portion (and would be even less to share between 4 people). Lastly, the dessert (lychee goji berry pudding) was very refreshing after a heavy meal like this.\\n\\nThe overall experience was good considering the food served was exactly what we expected. Even though the groupon was for 4 people, the three of us had no problem finish the food. We also ordered sesame bun and we all agreed that it was a must try. The bun was cruch on the outside and super fluffy on the inside. There were also green onions on the inside which added more flavour to the bun. One thing I would like to point out is that there wasn't a time limit, so we stayed there for about 3 hours. The restaurant started to fill up around 5:00 PM and there was a line up when we left at 6:30 PM. There were also shrimp crackers, fortune cookies, and some sort of noodles on top of the sauce bar. These items only appeared during the latter part of our stay. I only had the fortune cookie and it was stale. Service wise was quite non-existent, except when they came to take empty dishes away and give us the bill.

If someone is standing in an isle way you cannot get through as well.  Right after we sat down a server dropped a wine glass and the pieces went flying.  He then proceeded to walk all on top of the glass and walk across the restaurant spreading it everywhere.  It was a good few minutes before they \\"cleaned up\\" the glass which they left huge pieces that patrons were picking up with their hands and setting on their tables.  I'm 100% sure there are strict codes on how to clean up glass and none of the staff knew what to do.  \\n\\nTo drink I had the southern sangria, it was very good but VERY strong.\\n\\nTo eat (there was three of us) for appetizers we had the octopus appetizer and the lobster corndogs.  The octopus was okay but not evenly cooked and some pieces were over cooked.  It wasn't anything special.  For the lobster corndogs everyone agreed that the stick just got in the way and they fell apart really easily.  This is for sure an appetizer for more than one person as they give you at least five corn dogs.  For entrees we had the swordfish, filet, and pork chop.  The filet was okay we were all impressed that it was cooked well since it is a place specialized in seafood not steak, the portion was huge though I think a 6 oz would be plenty.  The pork chop was really good and the swordfish was meh.  The fish was a lot smaller than usual portions and the waitress described the veggies it comes with as VERY spicy and none of us got the least bit of spice at all.  \\n\\nOverall, don't need to come back and since they were only using a tiny portion of the whole restaurant I'm not sure this place is going to be here long."},{"name":"PONKO Chicken","address":"2896 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I had never heard of Ponko Chicken until they were at vendor at my office and now I am obsessed.

I really love and enjoy the concept of farm to table, and am always excited to support this.  Also, the main reason I wanted to come here was due to the plethora of guidebooks and reviews stating that THIS was the place to eat at.  I was aware that long lines could form so I practically dragged my companion here in on a Friday morning, about 30 minutes after opening.  We came at a good time since we were seated quickly.  The hostess and waiter were very friendly and explained the concept of the restaurant (served tapa style).  We got the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and Cowboy Breakfast (the beans were amazing).  The food was very good, and the other entrees passing by looked really appetizing as well.  One thing I was disappointed about was the fact that the portions were tiny compared to the high-ish prices.  I was prepared for the prices; I was NOT prepared that portions would be smaller than a typical restaurant portion (yes, I am aware that the pancakes would would be smaller than their entree size although I didn't realize how much smaller).\\nAlso, when it came time to pay, I noticed that there were two tip lines: one to tip your waiter(ess) and another to tip the kitchen staff.  This really confused us and there were no explanations about what the kitchen tip was (e.g. are we tipping them for making the food tasty???).  Since it was the first place we ate in Portland, I wondered if this was a Portland thing, but the other places we ate had no kitchen tip.\\nAlthough it was good to try a place that was highly recommended, I might try other places in the area before returning."},{"name":"Rising Son","address":"124 N Avondale Rd","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"4","text":"What a cute find in historical Avondale!

And once again, predictably, I found myself picking a place based on truffle scale-tipping. \\n\\nMultiple items on the Lincoln menu beckoned and I couldn't resist (well I'm sure I could but why). First up though, it's about the foreplay. Apple bacon Brussels sprouts filled that role perfectly. Crispy like they should be, these had the right amount of sweet and *bacon*. \\n\\nKeeping things upbeat with Allagash White also on the menu, things were settling in nicely for an enjoyable evening.\\n\\nNext up, the double-order strategy which almost came back to haunt me--more on that later. I decided to carb-load with truffle mac & cheese and mushroom pizza (yes with truffle). \\n\\nAs the Brussels were vanishing, the wood fired pizza arrived. Wait--where is the mac??? Somehow, amongst all the food-tastic-ness, it was never ordered. Panic attack. Probably need another Allagash. Crisis averted: they could still put in an order. \\n\\nAnd these must be kept on tap because they arrived barely post-Brussels and with only a slice of pizza done! So thankful for that because the truffle wasn't skimped in the mac. It was a little lost in the mushroom pizza but I'm not complaining. \\n\\nDespite the 6-mile run around Pleasure Bay, a new discovery for me in the South Bean, I still hadn't room to finish more than half that wood-fired cheesy gem.

And the pickled vegetables were a perfect balance of spicy and sour with a fantastic sesame sauce. Pickled yellow radish will be your new BFF - who knew?! \\n\\nPlates - We were full after the apps but managed to split the grilled chicken with fries.  The chicken is obviously fresh and juicy and the grilled flavor is so good. Again, the pairing of their sauces with veggies (this time avocado) was perfect.

I've had restaurant salsa down here in Texas that was much spicier.\\n\\nFor my entree I had to try the Thurman Burger since it is \\"the thing\\" to try here. I ordered mine cooked to \\"medium\\". When it arrived I could tell it was well-done. The sauteed onions and mushrooms were a nice touch but the 12 ounce doorstop of a bland and flavorless burger patty was a huge disappointment. The patty didn't have any charring on the surface either. They must throw a cover over it while cooking on the griddle to steam it.\\n\\nThe onion rings were good though. They were crispy on the outside and the onions stayed intact inside the ring when you bit into the rings and pulled away.\\n\\nThis place has a definite \\"dive bar\\" or \\"hole in the wall\\" vibe to it but the food just didn't taste good or had much taste at all."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I like this place!

Others just lacked flavor. I was surprised to have a slice of porkbelly so utterly bland. I recall one plate of truffled chicken that simply didn't taste like much at all, and was unimpressive in texture, too. The chefs at Bondir failed to push their dishes to excellence, or really to anything actually remarkable.\\n\\nOn a whole, based on my trip, I conclude that Bondir is massively underperforming.

Last night I did some research on Yelp and found the reviews on Tsuki, which is just a few blocks away from my hotel. Today I waited for them to open at noon so I could have lunch there.  I really wanted some combination sashimi. One of today's specials was \\"Slug Roll.\\"  This probably doesn't sound appetizing to some people. It has tuna, cucumber, and BBQ grilled eggplant. Eggplant happens to be one of my all time favorite vegetables, and I love grilled eggplant, so I decided to go for it. I also ordered a couple fresh oysters and crab chawanmushi. \\n\\nBoth oysters and chawanmushi were quite good. It had spinach, mushrooms, big chunks of crab and fish in the chawanmushi.  The oysters were super fresh. \\n\\nWhen Slug Roll came, I was pleasantly surprised how pretty it was. You don't really associate \\"slug\\" as something pretty.  The grilled eggplant had perfect crisscross grilled marks on it. When I put it in my mouth, the eggplant complements the tuna and crunchy cucumber well. It was harmonious.  I understand this probably doesn't work for people who JUST DON'T LIKE eggplants, but it was perfect for me. The eggplant was grilled perfectly and NOT mushy. I really wanted to take some photos of the beautiful dishes, but I was the only person in the restaurant sitting at the bar and felt too self conscious to take photos of their food. \\n\\nAs I finished my slug roll, the waitress asked me if I'd be interested in their homemade desserts - Earl Grey ice cream or creme brulee. That was a tough choice as I like earl grey tea and creme brulee is my all time favorite dessert.  I picked creme brulee. Little did I know this creme brulee had a Japanese twist to it. First, it had a thick layer of crunchy caramelized sugar on top. It immediately got my approval. I also noticed the black sesame seeds sprinkled on top, and when I tasted it, it had black sesame paste blended in the creme brulee. As most of Japanese desserts, it was not overly sweet. For everything I had, the check was less than $25. This was definitely the best meal I had so far during this trip.\\n\\nI want to go back for dinner.

My boyfriend and I waited several weeks to enjoy a romantic dinner together & we read the wonderful reviews for this restaurant. We work different schedules so quality time is very scarce, so we made a reservation weeks in advance. Upon entering La Grotta, the atmosphere was very quaint & comfortable. Much like the restaurants I had gone to in little parts of Italy. However, I feel as if we were stereotyped by our young age and that was reflected in the service we were provided. It was somewhat busy, but it was a Monday. We were easily the youngest people in the restaurant and maybe the only few people under 40-50 years old that night. The tables around us seemed to have been given prompt service, but it took 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence at the table. We each ordered pasta and spent time enjoying each other's company and enjoyed our dishes, wine, and martinis. We wanted to save room for dessert, so we decided to save half our pasta to take home. We started to feel like maybe it was rude or inappropriate to take home leftovers because our server kept ignoring us for another 20 minutes after we were done eating. When he finally came over, he scoffed and asked if something was wrong with our food and why we weren't eating. We told him that the food was fabulous and we wanted to save room for dessert. He then took our barely half eaten pastas dishes and stacked them impatiently on top of each other and strode off annoyed without even hesitating to ask us if we wanted to take the rest home with us. We confusedly thought maybe La Grotta wasn't a place you could take leftovers home with you, but saw other tables around us had to-go boxes. For $20 something dollar dishes, it would be have nice to take the rest of the food we paid for home. The careless and rude manner the server treated us with over the course of our visit made us decide we did not want to have dessert and a second glass of wine. Needless to say, we left & it was not the anniversary dinner we wished we had of experienced. We will not be back.\\n\\nEDIT: Upon reading other reviews, it seems that this scenario has happened with other patrons regarding a server mocking them for not finishing their meal and ignoring their table as well. Maybe because they were seen as less important than the older, regular crowd in the restaurant? I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and in fine dining, and for the amount of money spent and the average ticket price being high, you should not be labeled less sophisticated or be serviced less then any other customer."},{"name":"Himitsu","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"If you can get in you must go !

I LOVE their crust.  It tastes so fresh and homemade.  \\nThat being said, we ordered a large caesar salad and a large combination pizza.  \\nThe salad was excellent,  crunchy fresh romaine and enough dressing and parmesan shavings to make it perfect. \\nThe pizza was just as we wanted it.  \\n\\nMy complaint is, the owner lady (im guessing here)  was there and was sitting behind the bar chatting with our waitress so she didn't notice that we needed our drinks refilled, more napkins and i wanted a ranch to dip my crust in.  So we waited awhile.  The waitress brought it all over with a smile :) \\nNote that they were finished talking,  the owner proceeded to go into the kitchen and start cussing out one of the employees.  Loudly.  I mean, she's yelling louder than the football games so she's PISSED.  I kinda felt bad for the guy, that's got to be embarrassing and publicly humiliating when the customers can hear. And yes,  i stared. \\nI understand her frustrations as a business owner and all,  but save that shit for a private time.  You will only mess up your own business by yelling and cussing your employees out in public. \\n\\nAll in all i was VERY pleased with my food,  and the cleanliness of the restaraunt.  5* for that.

I am done being burned and left starving by this place. I will reiterate that they are a fantastic visit, but delivery service is pathetic. I still don't get it. I have had several issues prior, and yes, they have worked to correct those issues, but without the owner and manager breathing down their neck, they simply can't get this right. This evening I ordered two pizzas for $60 online ( - which, wtf?). I completely checked out, got a confirmation page and delivery quote. Waited the hour, and realized I never got my receipt. I called, and they had no record of my order and told me I had to wait another hour for my order. Additionally, they did not have calamari to add onto my large pizza, though it was listed as an option for my small pizza. Is this one particular employees fault? Hell no - but it doesn't make it any better. We're starving so I reordered, full price. Y'all should really just cancel the deliveries and focus on dine in service. Makes me so upset every time. When I received my order this evening, it was missing sauce for our appetizer, and took longer than the quoted 45 minutes. The girl on the phone offered to refund just for the sauce, which should be included with the app.... I explained my entire experience this evening and she got defensive and cut me off when I tried to speak. Not sure why she didn't offer to put me through to a manager - wishfully thinking she wasn't one.... thank god she refunded me $7!!!!!\\nBye flying saucer :( \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI've been here several times, and I will admit the customer service can be a little spotty (though I've had more mediocre experiences than bad, that I can remember). Food is always great though - There's definitely some interesting combinations here, and I love that they have copious vegan and gluten free options. I don't follow either dietary restriction so I can't vouch for the quality of those options, but I do love that they exist because it makes this a great spot to take visitors without worrying if they can find something on the menu.

I understand the restaurant was getting really busy and there was a huge line forming, but she needs to learn how to keep it professional too.

I grew up eating cajun and creole food. I never imagined I'd find a little piece of home in Columbus, Ohio. Let's start with their beignets. They'd make Cafe du Monde proud. They're soft and light and served warm with plenty of powdered sugar. I had the shrimp po-boy for lunch today. The shrimp was plump, the breading perfectly seasoned and crisp. The sauce was delicious. The bread wasn't exactly like you'd get in New Orleans, but it was close enough. Large portion size. I got the house potato chips instead of the fries, and was happy with the choice. You don't get a chance to eat homemade potato chips often. They're a little spicy, but oh so good. The crawfish etoufee tastes like my dad's always did, dark and spicy and full of flavor. I got them to make it as spicy as they go and wasn't disappointed. This cajun girl RARELY sweats, but that etoufee certainly got my brow wet. I loved every bite. And you guys. The gumbo. Chef Butcher gets his roux JUST RIGHT and you can tell with every spoonful. Today's gumbo, chicken and andouille, made me want to cry happy tears. A lot of people make \\"gumbo\\", but it's never gumbo the way I know it. Creole Kitchen's gumbo brought me back to my childhood, with my dad cooking a big pot of gumbo on a cold, wet day.

A tomato at that time of year should be a glistening, ruby red slice of heaven, acidic and sweet, soft but not mushy, its innards silky and slick, an oyster of a fruit, almost sexual in its texture, and aggressive in its evocation of summers past when a ripe tomato, still warm from the sun, reminded you that you are loved and the earth yields miracles.\\n\\n3.)

This cafe was a big disappointment. My fianc√© and I came here for breakfast after I had seen some delicious-looking photos of avocado toast, which I was craving. When we arrived, there was only one other person in the cafe and one person working. After seeing the photos of the sandwiches and avocado toast advertised at the bar for $7 and change, we decided to order that. The photos showed generous slices of avocados, gruyere cheese, bacon and egg, which is what we thought we were getting, especially since we pointed to the photo and said \\"we'll have this\\" and our barista confirmed. Two other people came into and out of the cafe for quick take away orders, and another worker joined and began preparing food immediately upon her arrival. I didn't see her wash her hands before handling the food, but perhaps I missed it. \\n\\nOver ten minutes later we were finally served our avocado toast sandwich, which, to our dismay, was a tiny piece of toast with three small slices of meager avocado and one soft boiled egg with a barely-there dusting of gruyer cheese (see below photo). We were shocked and thought perhaps they brought us the wrong dish. For over $7, we expected the food to at least match the photos advertised both on yelp and in their cafe! There was even a card on each table advertising avocado bacon breakfast sandwich for $5, which we found out was actually more expensive and that the $5 was a completely different sandwich than the one pictured. This place really needs to get their advertising straight, or at least picture the photo of the price that it matches. \\n\\nI brought this up to one of the girls who served us and I asked if we could at least get some bacon and more avocado for the price we were paying. She said she had to text her manager to find out. I would hope that in cases like this where if a cafe has an upset guest, the management team would give their staff a bit more empowerment to make their own judgment call. It doesn't cost the cafe that much to be able to give a few more extra Ingredients to meet the expectations of their customers. \\n\\nIn the end, we received a small bowl of a few tiny pieces of bacon and a bit more avocado. This was appreciated, and the girl was very nice and understanding of our frustration, but I was honestly ready to take the untouched food back to the register, request a refund and leave. \\n\\nI do not recommend this cafe, at least not for the food, because it's a total ripoff and you don't even get what you think you're ordering. We also ordered a matcha latte, which was so-so. \\n\\nA note to the management: your staff is nice, but give them the power to make a good judgment call if a customer is upset for right reason. Also, please change your photos of food and corresponding prices and description as they are extremely misleading. Either lower your food prices to match what the customer gets, or increase the ingredients to match the price they are paying. I get that Vancouver is expensive, but for $7, I expect more than a piece of toast, soft boiled egg and three tiny slices of avocado.

Lobster is from Maine, crab is from Rhode Island, and shrimp is from Quebec.  They moisten the seafood with an excellent melted lemon butter sauce and slight spice.  I also got a clam chowder bread bowl.  It was good, nothing spectacular stood out in my mind though.   \\n\\nAs a consumer I like to feel satisfied and just don't feel like I got my money's worth here.  More bread than seafood.

When I went on a weeknight it was for Taco Tuesday. $2 tacos that were a pretty decent size and delicious! Also had $2 coronas making it an all-around great deal. It wasn't busy so our server was pretty attentive and kept our drinks full!

I read the mixed reviews on Yelp and figured I would find out on my own. Very nice interior, comfortable space, good sized bar.  Limited tap list, and I mean limited. They had one, count 'em one, craft beer on tap (I don't count Yuengling, Sam, or Shocktop as craft). If there was a can/bottle list, it wasn't offered to me. The waitress was nice, and very attentive, she stopped by several times to ask how I was doing, can I get you anything, etc., so I had zero complaints with the level of service.\\n\\nThe food was okay, and just okay. I had a side Caesar salad to start, and that was pretty good; a little too much dressing, but pretty good. Chicken Florentine was on the specials list and so I ordered it. Meh. Serious meh... The chicken had very little flavor to it, neither did the sauce. The spinach looked fresh, the tortellini was good that it sat under. But the cheese that topped it was the shredded kind you find in the supermarket, because it hadn't fully melted. I ate it, because I was hungry, but it was nothing special. \\n\\nI'll try a burger the next time I stay here and update my review."},{"name":"Manuel's","address":"310 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent food awesome Mole sauce.

Did they open somewhere else? Did they retire?\\nI keep thinking about this place of all places that I liked / didn't like.  Yet as memory moves to remembrance and the fondness of Cambie Cafe and it's owners makes me think of the times when the food was good.  Our entire family still misses their killer minced beef on rice with a fried egg on top.  We keep trying other places but none have had the impact on us like this place.  It was a flavour from Chinese restaurants from the 70's and just like how Wonton restaurants are slowly dying away for the more modern Chinese foods, we are constantly finding ourselves missing out.  What used to be known as Chinese food is becoming no more.  Like the Cantonese language and the ways of the old Chinese dishes, fading away slowly.  Without getting into politics on what's happening currently overseas, it's just such a sad feeling that the things we remember fade away over time.  And so, if you happen to know of a place, anywhere in BC that has minced beef on rice like how the folks here used to make it.  Please send me a message.  Especially if it's still being made by the original chef.  More importantly if the family is doing well.

Hard to get a bad meal here, it really scratches my mexican food itch when it's bad.  Wish I lived closer, but it's about a 1/2 hour drive from my house, so from a caloric standpoint, it's probably better that it's a destination rather than a convenience.\\n\\nI have had and love the Efrain's Burrito.  Get it smothered with the green chili and don't mind the heat scale on the menu -- if you like spicy, it's great!  This is two meals (and large ones, at that!) for me, so I love it heated up the second or third time, as well.  It's packed and very flavorful.\\n\\nWhile I'm usually driving, I've not partaken of the maggies as yet, however EVERYONE who has had one when I'm around raves about them.  They are a good pour and very tasty, apparently.\\n\\nI really like the salsa.  Usually restaurant salsa is pretty wimpy and  not super-flavorful.  This, however, has a LOVELY heat and we always end up eating a load of chips and have to get more of the tasty yummy goodness that resides in the salsa.\\n\\nOrdered the Green Chili Plate the last time to give the Efrain's burrito a break and attempt to explore the menu a bit more.  It was every bit as good  as I expected, the green chili has such a wonderful heat  but not a aggressive bite, it's a bit of a slow roast after you eat it.  The flour tortilla was perfectly charred in a few places and tasted fresh and wonderful.\\n\\nThis is my favorite mexican place in the north west Denver area.  I'm sure there are some wonderful places elsewhere, however I may never get to them as I'm here in Efrain's!\\n\\nFor the downsides:  Service can be a little slow, especially when they are packed.

Better suited for a casual date night without the kids (unless you have deeper pockets). \\n\\nFirst - our server Chris was top notch. Excellent guy. All the servers were very friendly. Chris was just fantastic though. \\n\\nWe were a party of seven.  My father went with the standard Salmon Teriyaki which looked good. My wife, my mom, and myself went Omakase style where you set a budget and the chefs decide what you will be served. My wife likes mangos and salmon, and oysters and eggplant not so much. With those guidelines we had a five course meal \\n1. Scallops, golden kiwi, raspberries in a citrus sauce served cocktail style. So divine. The blend of some salt and some citrus with the scallops and fruit were incredible. I wanted to drink the entire thing \\n2. Seasonal dish. Zucchini blossom stuffed with mascarpone cheese, mushrooms, and prawns. My wife's favourite of the dishes \\n3. prawns done three ways including a popcorn prawn roll. Delicious \\n4. Sushi platter included \\"stuffed tomato\\" which was ahi tuna wrapping scallops, pressed sushi with mango, and a combination of seared and spicy sushi. The pressed sushi with mango, the amaebi sushi, torched toro, and jalape√±o seabream weren't favourites. \\n5. Finally a yakisoba seafood dish. \\n\\nWe were celebrating my wife's birthday. The Birthday girl treat was poke tuna in a mini ice cream cone with edamame hummus. I love that they customized the dishes for my wife. She's generally not a fan of prawns but really liked all the prawn dishes she was served. \\n\\nThe only down side was the kids. Our Kids are big eaters and had edamame, agedeshi tofu, two x salmon roll, two x chicken teriyaki roll, the sablefish entree. Also came with a strawberry \\"slushee\\". For the kids, given that they eat pretty standard fare, it was a bit pricey. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back and would definitely recommend Omakase style here. Be very clear on what you like or don't. Better yet would be to call a day before, say that you plan to go Omakase style and give them a list of what you like and don't. For $60 a person, you will have a great time and experience. But it's best to leave the kids at home if you don't want them to eat you out of house and home.

If the heat omelette is too hot for you, you can ask for a side of sour cream and salsa to tame the heat. The sandwich had a honey glaze added to it which made the sandwich that much more amazing.

We ordered our steaks medium, but they barely qualified as medium rare, I have pics. For me it was eatable, but for her she just ate around the outside. To compound the problem, I mentioned to our waiter, the food is ok, but could you mention to the cook if a person orders a quality steak medium, they should take a little more time and cook it medium. It was just my opinion as the paying customer, just takes message to the cook, then the poor service started, the waiter did not listen, and just started to grab the plate to take the food back and reheat it. NOT what I was asking for, but I guess it's just standard operating procedure, serve the food wrong, then reheat the food to make sure you toughen it up and say you give good customer service and come back again soon to ruin another important dinner.

They've made mistakes in the past but they are small mistakes like forgetting silverware but I'm not very picky. But the other day when I ordered lunch for 4 people they made a mistake by sending me a Cheeseburger sub instead of a cheeseburger meal which is what I asked for. When I called, the woman who answered the phone had no time to discuss the mix-up so I asked to speak with the owner who had an attitude as if I was disrespecting his wife by asking for him. He fixed the mix-up at that time. So tonight we ordered again from them. Ordered a plain cheeseburger meal, a chicken strips with fries meal (which comes with a salad), teriyaki chicken strips, and an order of onion rings. When the food arrived, I was missing the salad and the onion rings I had ordered. When I called them to let them know, the owner (once again with an attitude) answered the phone. I begin to tell him I was missing the onion rings which he said I never ordered. He began arguing with me telling me he took the order this time and that he doesn't mess up unlike the time prior. I hadn't gotten the ability to ask if I was charged or not because of said attitude. I decided if I wasn't charged, I wasn't gonna order them now because of his attitude. The conversation never even got to the point to let him know I was missing the salad that came with the meal as well. I'm not someone who looks for something for nothing or a way to get free food from an establishment.

The garlic crab claws were a great selection for an appetizer. All the food came out boiling hot which I love. Husband ordered the house special prime rib and I ordered the Shrimp D'Angelo. My husband really enjoyed his meal. I enjoyed mine as well, but would probably select another dish next time being that there wasn't as much flavor as I hoped there would be. The reason for the four stars is because the cheese cake we had was just OK. the crust had an unusual taste for some reason. I would give it another chance if we ever visit again.

None of us could compare it to any other craft beer we had ever tried and after we each had finished a pint we thought it stood up to any great Double Wit we had tasted before.  \\n\\nThe service was great, and it seemed every passing employee could answer every \\"crafty\\" question we threw at them.   One of the coolest things is the assortment of board games which is another reason we plan to go back; just to drink good beer and play games for hours. \\n\\nThere was a line when we showed up and two hours later the line was still there but it seemed to move quickly as we noticed the tables around were turning on a regular basis.

I saw the reviews weren't great but it was late and we hoped the reviews were off. Nope.\\n\\nSo for $40, we got chicken tenders that weren't chicken tenders the way most people expect (deep fried, fully seasoned, breaded, strips of chicken breast). They basically were coated full size boneless chicken breasts that were fried whole, then sliced and cooked again (no breading on round two). We can eat pretty much any chicken but this was dry, greasy and only the sauce made it last for three to four bites because we were starving. Even after that, we stopped and left 2/3s of a large order uneaten.\\n\\nSteak and cheese was better. That actually was cooked OK. Meat wasn't Philly style but I'm in Boston so they got it as close as possible. Alot of grease left on the plate but overall, 20x better than the chicken.\\n\\nGarlic bread and cheese..... Not even sure how to categorize it. Terrible is the consensus. It was basically like this..... if you are stoned out of your mind, have some oat grain burger buns, toast 'em with garlic butter and then try to turn it into a grilled cheese using a shredded cheese blend. Then in your stoned state you imagined you made the most awesome garlic cheese sandwich. Again, we love anything cheese. Especially my GF who is the Queen Czar of cheese eating. But even this made her gag.\\n\\nOh, and we ordered fries which we never got. I actually called back after initially ordering and asked if they could include ketchup with the fries. Guy on the phone said yeah, they included ketchup with the fries. Neither made it into the bag. \\n\\nSo final score: Chicken tenders - 1 (cause we ate, 3-1/2 pieces only cause of the sauce), Steak and Cheese - 7, garlic bread and cheese - 0 (two people, two bites, one stopped, one gagged). Fries - negative 1 because they missed it and had a chance to redeem themselves when I called back about the ketchup.\\n\\nGood luck.

We were seated at the bar upstairs right away because our dinner decision was spur of the moment resulting in having to wait for dinner.  The bartender was charming and  genuine filled with helpful suggestions.  She asked what kind of drinks I like and I settled on one she described that wasn't on the menu.  Our drinks took a little longer than expected simply because all their stock was low and they were constantly bringing up new bottles (we were watching the whole time), which wasn't a big deal but they gave us our drinks on the house.  Free booze is always an awesome start.\\n\\nWe were seated as soon as a table was free and our waiter was charming and very attentive.  He took our orders and gave us our bread immediately, freshening up the plate as soon as it was empty.  We ordered the carne and pesce platter for 3 and it was, once again, an abundance of delicious food.  When the waiter asked if I wanted another drink, I asked for the custom concoction from the bar upstairs.  The girls at the bar downstairs didn't know how to make it, so the bartender upstairs gladly came and made it for me downstairs.  Damn!  What was next?  Table side bar service?  The 5  stars now applies to both Italian Kitchen's food and service.  I look forward to going back!\\n\\nAs for food, I think the pasta platter was still better.  It was more filling, which pasta usually is, and tasted better in my opinion.

This milestone is dedicated to the most heavenly of baked goodness -- the BISCUIT.  The fourth stop on my recent 24 hour trip to Portland had me chasing a seat at this uber-popular spot devoted to biscuit sandwiches.  I caught a bus from downtown and took an easy morning walk along this arts district to get here.  Having read reviews about the wait and seating, I came as early as I could on a Sunday morning.  At about 8 am, the line wasn't too bad, but the place was already packed.\\n\\nYou order/pay at the front and then find a seat.  I sat at the counter right by the guy assembling it all.  He kept it moving along...plating the biscuits, layering them with toppings, gravy, etc.  As he completed his masterpieces, he'd place them on top of the narrow counter shelf and call out patron's names.  This part was confusing and a bit hard to hear, so I'm glad I sat so close to him.\\n\\nI decided to go for the much-hyped REGGIE DELUXE, cholesterol be damned.  It's the Reggie, a fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with a crispy and well-seasoned piece of fried chicken, thick-cut bacon and melted cheese topped with a generous pour of gravy.  The deluxe means an added egg.  It's incredibly messy and surprisingly filling.  I actually didn't finish mine, but it was so good!

It wasn't until a friend of ours dined there recently for a work dinner that it reminded me. He mentioned something that I had forgotten.\\n\\nMost important, the food. It was...okay. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. My husband and I are steak lovers so our expectations are pretty high. We both had steak and it was...fair. Not memorable at all. The server was good, I will say and did her job well.\\n\\nNow here's why we haven't been back. When we were waiting for our table, I literally asked my husband what happened to the hostess' pants. She was literally wearing what appeared to be a silky black top with spaghetti straps and high heels. It barely skimmed her panty line. Had she bent over even slightly, she would have given the world quite a show. Our particular server, thankfully, had more coverage. \\n\\nMind you, I am no prude. I don't think female servers have to be in buttoned up high collar blouses with floor-length skirts. I've seen the gamut of server attire in my lifetime. Short skirts are often the norm. But the lovely young woman was wearing what appeared to be a nightie in public. It was that microscopic. The male servers, however, were in formal dress pants, long-sleeved shirts and ties.\\n\\nMy friend told me when he and his wife had dined there a year a few years ago, the server was wearing a pink bustier as a top, much akin to a bra. When he asked someone there later why the server attire was so scant, he was told the manger actually encouraged the female staff to wear clothing like that because they wanted to give a \\"Tilted Kilt\\" vibe. My friend has had to return a few times for business dinners but not because he wanted to.\\n\\nI don't know if this has changed in recent months, but I can tell you that's mainly why we have not returned to try it again. And we dine at a lot of high-end steak houses. I really don't need to see that much skin when I'm dining.

It also seemed odd that the meatball parm had provolone cheese instead of the traditional mozzarella. The provolone was not bad, but tasted different than a traditional meatball parm hero.

My love affair with that steaming hot, roll-yourself, bell peppery meal is usually satisfied by my own cooking.  Often though, I get a hankering for a chicken fajita that actually taste good. (well taste great, I can cook 'good') La Casita is a great choice for this. \\n\\nLa Casita is a master at Margeritas, of which they have several versions on menu, including one that comes with an upside down bottle of Corona inside the glass. I recommend the strawberry flavor Margee, though I didn't get it this visit in favor of tres Dos Equis. \\n\\n It resides in a small, kind of quaint brick building off Bethel, an area abound with indy and/or ethnic joints that are often unsung. It has a nice patio that fills quickly during happy hour or on the weekends.The interior is pretty cool too. It has colorful chairs with seemingly mezzo-Native American designs. The sign out front claims authenticity which is augment by Mexican music and ESPN Deportes on the single LCD at the bar.    \\n\\nService is industrial, welcoming and fast. They had my order up in a snap and replaced my beer timely. There is a team spirit that is perceptible here. On the other hand the bar is very small and the staff gathers around that area, waiting for orders, drinks, or commands from management. Though it was that bad, I do not recommend sitting there in peak times or with a party more than two. \\n\\nMy fajita was really good, a party in my mouth of fully charged flavor, nothing was underwelming at all. The chicken wasn't greesy nor overcooked and steamed with the right ratio of tasty onions and perfect bells. The sour cream was fresh, the lettuce correctly green, the guacamole had a thick, sharp taste. The tortillas were hot, fried correctly, and delicious. They were small though, and they only gave me three, which was not enough to roll the plentiful ingrediants on the plates. This is my only complaint. \\n\\nLa Casita was once the king of auntentic Mexican in C-town but has fallen, from what my cultural antennas have tuned in on, to pedestrian status. Although I am unable to give an opinion on this because of my  general dislike of the cuisine, I speculate that the rise in food culture here in the last decade has rendered the once top College Basketball player of Mexican to secondary in the emerging NBA of the stripmall geniuses like the one across the street. ( Whose pastor has me planning a culinary adventure; a test to see if age has expanded my pallete.) This I think is the main cause of the perception La Casita has fallen. \\n\\nI don't think it has; It is 4-stars for what it does, at least whete Fajitas and Margaritas are concerned."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"1650 28th St, Unit 1224","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"The 2 stars is for the food, which never disappoints.  \\n\\nThe way the food got into my hands is another story.\\n\\nIt started off with the question \\"white or brown rice.\\"  My answer to that  was brown rice.

The employee attempted to shake the cilantro off their hands, then proceeded to get cilantro fingers all up in my burrito.\\n\\nThe burrito made it's way to the employee who was to wrap it all up.  This turned out to be quite a fiasco.  Sure, I order a hefty burrito.  I like both beans and veggies.  This burrito was a monster.

I could see the pressure building, so I told the employee at the register, that it would be fine if they double wrapped the burrito with the extra tortilla that was on the way.  What happened was, the mound of unwrappable burrito contents was dumped half-hazardly onto the next tortilla, the tortilla and probably 1/10 of my burrito ended up in the trash, and I was left wanting to write a yelp review.  \\n\\nChipotle!

However, the art of coffee for me is in the taste, and this is where Artigiano misses their potential by a mile.

A very sweet young lady helped us with our selection and then let us know to pay at the counter. We went to the counter and noticed another young lady, a young man and a little girl were sitting off to the side but still behind the counter. We originally thought they worked there but after standing at the counter with wallet in hand for a while without being acknowledged whatsoever, we figured we misunderstood. So I went back to ask where to pay. The first young lady looks up from helping a large group to say again , \\"pay at the counter, Ally can help you\\". So back to the counter I go. My husband who stayed there still had no acknowledgment whatsoever from either of the couple. So now we're almost sure the couple are customers, and this Ally is going to show up from the back at any moment. NOPE. The guy eventually goes in the back, and the girl looks reluctant as if she's expecting the other girl to come over and ring us up but I don't know how since she's got a line of people going out the door. So this girl who I assume is Ally reluctantly gets up and ambles over to the computer. Mind, she has yet to say a word to us. We have to ask her how much we owe after several moments of watching her twiddle with the mouse. Finally, speaking to us for the first and only time, she tells us how much.

I had heard of Imperial Fez but had never dined there before so I was open for a new experience.  The Groupon provided 2 Five-Course dinners for us.  We went on a Thursday evening at around 6:30 p.m.  Parking is very easy since complimentary valet is provided.  We parked and went inside.  We stood up at the front of the restaurant waiting on a host to come seat us...it never happened.  We stood up front(along with a few other guests) for about 10 minutes before we had to go find someone who worked there to seat us.  I should have known this was a bad sign.  Anyways....we get seat finally and the server comes out to greet us right away.  (Sidenote:  All the tables and seats are very low to the ground.  Taller people will struggle to be comfortable.  It's part of the culture tho...so just be advised.  -The 6'3 guy),  We started our 5 course dinner and the food was decent.  The bread and soup they gave us was great and I ordered the Lamb as my entree.  The lamb was very tender and nicely flavored.  No complaints there.  The only thing I can complain about was big though....it took them FOREVER to bring out each portion of the dinner!  We arrived at 6:30 and wanted to get back home by 10(Tryna watch Scandal! lol).   It was a lil bit after 9 by the time they brought out our entrees.  We asked the server to box up dessert for us b/c we didn't wanna be at the establishment until forever and a day.  He gladly did so.  We then asked for our check.  This is where the nightmare starts.....the server leaves and takes 20 minutes to bring our check.  He comes back after another 10 minutes and we give him the credit card for us to pay.  They never come back with our credit card.  After about 15 minutes, we ask for our card so we can go ahead and leave.....these fools have no idea where our card is.  I'm a very patient guy so I tell em to find the card asap.  I was more pissed that they were already holding me hostage and i'm missing my favorite TV show b/c of slow service and then you tell me you have no idea where my CC is?! Oh ok...gotcha!  They finally find our card after about 15 minutes.  They apologize and we pay and leave.  \\n\\nI probably won't ever come back here again not because of the food b/c it was decent...but b/c of the service and the unorganized fashion of how everything here went down.

I've even brought friends, family, and co-workers here, and they've all loved it. This is a loud, fast paced Vietnamese restaurant- you don't go here for ambience or the decor. You go for the pho...huge, steaming bowls of delight, featuring the tastiest broth you will ever have, noodles, and an assortment of meats, seafood, and vegetables. It doesn't get much better. The spring & summer rolls are also quite good, as are the regular Vietnamese menu items, but it's the soup that is the main attraction. Get seated, place your order, the food will be brought to you within moments and then slurp away. You'll be in and out in well under an hour, and the bill will be so affordable you will question if it's correct.

And, the shrimp were so small I could barely differentiate them from the Crawfish. The shrimp were less than half the former size, about the size of popcorn shrimp. The boudin balls went from a 6 piece to a 4 piece and they tasted different - bad, mushy and pickley. Usually, you can see the pieces of rice stuffed inside and you can taste the rice. These looked like pink mush inside, with no hint of rice...yuck. We didn't even finish them. When the manager stopped by it was a very condescending, lack-luster, well if you want six we'll give you six type of attitude, so we declined. I'm not looking for handouts or freebies. They created an expectation of 6. $8 for 4 small rice balls is ridiculous! They also tried to tell us that the they made them larger but that simply wasn't true in my experience. I've had them too many times and this is the approximate size that they've always been. I'm not sure what is going on, but I won't be back. Honestly, Long John Silvers would've been better. And, that's saying a lot."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Pine State Biscuits really hits the spot when you're craving some delicious comfort food. Obviously the Reggie is recommended. If you can handle some spice, pair with the aardvark sauce as the kick really mixes well with the gravy. Personally, I thought the sausage gravy was more flavorful than the mushroom gravy. Mushroom gravy just reminded of a cream of mushroom type gravy which kinda makes sense. Cajun fries are really crispy but eat them quick since they're mixed with gravy too. My only gripe with the fried chicken was it could have been more crispy since it came out a little soggy."},{"name":"Monkeys Subs","address":"12194 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"This is a great sandwich shop close to Whole Foods and mod pizza.

We are now at our anniversary dinner at L'Espalier. Into our 3rd course, the effects of food poisoning had kicked in for me.

We did ask to speak to a manager several times, but didn't see him until right before our food came out and he never checked on us again. Our waitress didn't check up on us often either.

Usually there would be two people making orders and one at the register. This location had only one person making orders, so I guess that's what caused the delay.  However, on a Saturday afternoon where it could get busy, you would think the manager would make sure they were properly staffed or assist in servicing customers.\\n\\nFood:\\nI ordered a chicken bowl with lettuce, corn, mild salsa, vegetables, and white rice.

By the time we got back at 11:15 the line was by the polkadog treat shop. We were cut off from first round seating. Boo. Second time, we arrived at 11:20 and again lined up by polkadog treat but a little closer. Again, we got cut off first seat. Double boo. Each time we waited a little under an hour and they're usually pretty efficient and accurate in their time count. \\n\\nFood wise the raw bar is always a treat. I like any oysters that say buttery finish because who doesn't like butter? They average around $3 an oyster and vary in size. I've also tried the clam chowder which was delicious but definitely more liquidy than other clam chowders I've had. They're really generous with the seafood they add it. It's also a significant portion so definitely a good idea to share. The lobster roll is always a favorite and what basically everyone orders. It can be ordered as either a hot roll with butter or cold with mayo. SO GOOD! Also fries on the side. My absolute favorite dish here though is the ciopinno soup. Literal dreams. It comes with clams, mussels, shrimp, a variety cuts of fish and the most bomb ass soup and rice combo. \\n\\nThe location itself is tiny hence the crazy wait. I don't know if I would every wait 2 hours for food here but would be okay with 1 hour. The service is pretty decent considering how tiny the space is and how many people they serve.

I assure you, this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This happened awhile ago, but I think it's finally time to share the story. \\n\\nMy friend and I met up in the Winter Park area which is known for having good restaurants, and being a very upscale area. This restaurant had amazing ratings and looked up our alley - we like being able to order many small plates and share so we can try many different things. \\n\\nFirst, it is a small place and feels a little cramped when you sit. The menu apparently changes daily, so you can never be sure what will be on it; that night, there was very little that looked appealing, but we found a few things that sounded good. We ordered their signature broccolini dish (one of the few stationary menu items), and a charred toast dish. I figured by charred, they didn't mean charcoal, but that is what we got. It was completely black, inedible, and bitter. How did this leave the kitchen?\\n\\nNow for the broccolini drama: I was really excited for this dish, but when I tasted it, it was the SALTIEST thing I have ever eaten in my life. If it's possible, it was saltier than salt. When the waiter came over and asked us how things were, usually I don't complain. This, however, I could not hold back. We told him it was inedibly salty, and of course he took it back and promised to bring us another. Ten minutes later, he came back and told us that the chef tried it and agreed it was too salty, and gave us the explanation that it must have been accidentally cooked in the salted pasta water. He then went into a speech about how the chef is super awesome and all the food is the best and he was on Hell's Kitchen, and just give it a chance because it's the best. More time passed, like 20-30 minutes. At this point, we were done and wanted out; we didn't even want the broccolini. We finally saw our waiter, got his attention, and asked for the check; we said we didn't want to wait anymore for the replacement dish. He then told us that he accidentally gave our replacement broccolini to another table and ours would be out in a minute. Seriously? We paid for the other dish, and the waiter kept coming over and pressuring us to wait for the replacement, that he would put it in a to go box and we don't have to even pay for it, just take it and eat it! As we were signing our checks and trying to get out, he came to our table with the broccolini in a to-go box. We told him we said we didn't want it, we just want to leave, and walked to the door. Suddenly, the waiter was behind us, and FOLLOWED US out of the restaurant trying to make us take the broccolini. \\"No means no\\" was apparently meaningless. We ended up literally running away.\\n\\nI gave this restaurant one star for the staff believing in the food and the chef's vision. I am assuming this was a combination of a bad night and us choosing poorly off the menu based on the fact that others love this restaurant, but it was one of the most expensive disappointing meals I have ever had."},{"name":"Ba Shu Szechuan Food","address":"4500 Kingsway, Suite 2138","city":"Burnaby","stars":"2.5","text":"Not the best.\\n\\nWe walked around the food court and looked at all the food places.

They also had a smaller menu with handwritten dish names in a sign at the front, with more \\"specialty\\" sichuan dishes.\\n\\nOf course, since it's my first time there, and looking for spicy sichuan food, I tried to order something off the specialty dish--the lady tried really hard to persuade me to avoid the specialty dishes on the small sign, and to order the \\"standard rice combos\\", which was kind of a let-down. Why put up the small sign if you don't want people to order from it--just remove it from the offering.\\n\\nIn the end I ordered the \\"fire-noodle\\", the first item on the specialty sign, because I wanted spicy Sichuan food.

For $8. That was not even spicy.\\n\\nCan you imagine that?

PONKO features Asian crispy chicken tenders and fresh sides - I settled on the spicy-sweet sauce with a side salad and brown rice. The food arrived at the table in about 15 minutes quite hot or cold if appropriate. \\n\\nI thought the food good if slightly pricy - too early for beer but I could see this as a great, convenient option to hit before a movie or other event. Service amounts to food delivery at your table. - those behind the counter were quite knowledgeable and make recommendations if asked.

I was spoiled growing up by an awesome Moroccan restaurant, so coming here the bar was set high. Everyone (unless you're a tot) must order a five course meal. So you order your entree of choice and the rest comes family style.\\n\\nHere's the breakdown:\\n-Harrira/lentil soup: This is yummy and a nice way to start the meal. It'll come with a bowl of sweet shredded carrots and a gravy boat of spicy sauce, not to mention bread. Drink your soup (no spoons!) and dip the bread.\\n-Salads: There's a nice bean spread (similar to hummus), carrots, eggplants, greens and so on. Also good when scooped with bread. \\n-B'stila: The best part of Moroccan food. This version is cornish hen, baked with almonds and spices inside phyllo dough and dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon. This one you will need forks for, and it's just divine.\\n-Main entree: Yes, it's pricey here. But you're getting a lot of food, so don't be too dissuaded by the costs of the entrees. Compared to other five course Moroccan places, Imperial Fez has a very large menu loaded with options. The fact that every person gets their own entree instead of doing a family style main dish is a plus as well. Just note that the waiters will try to coax you into a more expensive dish. :)\\n-Dessert: Honestly was overwhelmed by a large plate of fruit and baklava. Would've much preferred they stuck with the tea and a smaller dish. We were all way too stuffed by this point.\\n\\nTheir food was pretty tasty but not the best ever. Bellydancers were also neutral in my book.

The chicken biscuit was dry and lacked flavor. The Cranford chicken was kind a hard I wish it was less batter and more soft.

We started with the shrimp and alligator cheesecake, which as described by the waiter would be a nice melty chunk of cream cheese with gator, shrimp, and breadcrumbs. What we got was a lukewarm brick of bland semi-solid cheese and indistinct chunks of meat. It seemed like it had been pre-made then set under a heat lamp for quite a while. There was melted cheese on top, but it had since re-solidified. The bread rounds with it for dipping were soaked in oil and were very greasy and unappetizing. We next both got fried shrimp po' boys. The breading they used on the shrimp was very heavy and formed a dense crust. It seriously reminded me of chicken McNuggets. Beyond that, the shrimp was flavorless. We also had sides with the po' boys, a cup of gumbo that was actually pretty good and a side of cheddar grits with andouille sausage. The grits had a nice cheese flavor but only tiny bits of sausage. That's really too bad because bigger chunks to add that spicy, smoky flavor would have really made that dish great. We ended with beignets, since as my girlfriend said, \\"how can you screw up fried dough with sugar?\\" They were good and the only thing that redeemed the dinner. Maybe we had the wrong dishes.

They factored in the strong taste of shitakiis to create a mushroom gravy was pleasantly mushroom-y and umami wihtout being overpowering. As for the biscuits, they were fluffy and good.\\n\\n- The Reggie Deluxe. Good, but honestly the fried chicken got in the way of the biscuits and gravy. It was missing a certain something until I spread some apple butter on it. The apple butter completely changed the sandwich and brought it together as a dish. So if you get a Reggie, that's how I recommend eating it. \\n\\n- Chicken pot pie. Stellar! With a tender biscuit brust on top and balanced pot pie filling, the dish felt warm and comforting. Inside, the gravy was just the right consistency, salt, and savory taste. I appreciated the peas and carrots mixed with chicken - gotta get some vegetables in LOL.\\n\\n- Lemon ricotta cornmeal pancakes. Delicious. The texture of these thick, fluffy pancakes were offset by crunchy cornmeal. Each bite sweetened with real maple syrup and fresh whipped cream was heavenly!\\n\\n- Pecan pie. A waitress offered us an extra slice of pie they were trying to \\"get rid of\\" (probably because we were fatties).

That's rocket science at work.\\n\\nI needed an East Side surrogate for the cheap lunch specials at the Happy Fortune, a Chinese restaurant on the better side of 3 stars located in SW Portland near Barbur Blvd. and Capitol Highway.  I looked at the Yelp reviews for Golden Dynasty and they appeared to be mostly positive.  That said, I was charged about going and determined to like this place.\\n\\nInside, Golden Dynasty is more understated than Happy Fortune.  It's more \\"woodsy\\" looking.  Also, there aren't many windows.  I motioned toward the back of the restaurant, where there are some windows onto the parking in the rear.\\n  \\nI looked at the menu and the lunch specials were numerous.  I spotted some reliable cashew chicken kew.  When asked what I wanted to drink, I mentioned that I wanted a glass of water and it was brought out to me.  I also wanted the usual eggroll.  It turns out that you can't order just one.  That platter comes with 3 of them!  The food arrived.  The cashew chicken was very good, as were the crispy egg rolls.  I then realized that the tea, which comes with the meal deal, never came, so I asked for it and it arrived.  That was a first, in terms of experiences at a Chinese restaurant, and the tea is usually there in no time. Again, everything was good.\\n\\nAs for the service, the server never checked back and she had to be motioned over several times ... and the restaurant wasn't even crowded.   I had to ask for more water because, when food is hot, your nose may run.  I then had to ask for more napkins, and only got one.  The bill was reasonable, at under $10, and a fortune cookie came with the tab.  However, the fortune cookie was more stale than any I've ever had.  To add insult to injury, there was no fortune in it.  I then had to ask for another fortune cookie and the fortune contained in the new one was just plain weird.\\n\\nThe name Golden Dynasty says Colorado to me.  You see, Golden is a suburb of Denver and \\"Dynasty,\\" the TV series, was set in Denver.  Once I saw the opening credits and vistas of Denver, I never bothered to watch a full episode.  However, the location is neither golden nor fit for a dynasty.  Across the street is an ARCO station, to its west and across the intersection is a Plaid Pantry, and diagonally across the intersection is one of the grande dames of Portland auto junk yards.  Actually, this led me to perceive it as a \\"good dive\\" type of place.\\n\\nNow, I am confused.  At Golden Dynasty, the cashew chicken, for which \\"no MSG\\" must be specified, was great and lunch specials run until 4 p.m., 7 days a week!  On the flip side, you need to load up on egg rolls, to the tune of 3, which tip the meal toward being too filling, get service which leans toward the pert side, and possibly even get a fortune cookie without a fortune.  I am so damn confused that I will give them a balanced 3 stars.  I don't know when I'll return, even though that cashew chicken was good."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Been coming here for years.

Man, are we glad we did! From the time you enter this whimsical space, you're surrounded by all things New Orleans, and particularly Mardi Gras. The walls are covered in beads,  colorful paintings and masks, as well as some reminders of the struggles the city endured during and after Hurricane Katrina. The vibe is festive, and that vibe extends to the cocktail menu, which includes a Hurricane and one of the most proper Sazeracs I've ever had outside of the city. We started with Fried Green Tomatoes and Crawfish... perfectly seasoned and breaded with corn meal and spices, and fried to a golden brown. This excellent starter paired well with my cocktail with its delightful tartness. For entrees, the kid and i had Po-Boy sandwiches (mine was oysters and crawfish, his was catfish and crawfish) and the lady had the Chicken Ponchatrain. Her dish consisted of two perfectly sauteed chicken breasts with a rich cajun sauce served on top and she had dirty rice for a side. The chicken was full of flavor and the rice was well prepared and very tasty. Unlike many restaurants that scrimp on the main ingredients, Tibby's Po-Boys were stuffed and messy and absolutely delicious!! I ordered a side of \\"cheddar grits\\", and as cheese grits go, they were very good, with a ton of flavor and perfectly cooked. For dessert, of course we had to try their beignets and folks, if you've ever wondered if anyone makes a beignet as good as Cafe Du Mond, the answer is yes! It's Tibby's!! We tried their bread pudding, which was also a terrific bite of sweet surrender. Paired with a cup of chicory coffee, our meal's ending left us feeling as though we'd just made a quick trip to The Big Easy for the afternoon. To top it off, the service staff was awesome and the manager was extremely friendly. If you find yourself craving some exceptional cajun faire, do yourself a favor and head to Tibby's.

The waitress explained to us that the dishes were designed to be shared so we decided upon two smaller plates and three large plates: one chocolate potato doughnut ($3), a half serving of Auntie Paula's French toast ($7), a large serving of potatoes bravas ($8), tasty steak & cheddar eggs ($16), and tasty hangtown fry ($14). All were very good but the winners were the French toast and steak & eggs!! The French toast was light and not too sweet but was perfectly complimented by the berry sauce. I could've easily polished off a full serving by myself! The steak & eggs consisted of steak and scrambled eggs served over a cornmeal pancake. All elements worked together very well. Honestly we could've been satisfied with only 4 dishes because servings were pretty decently sized, but it was enjoyable to taste more dishes. \\n\\nOverall, hype/wait was justified.

I absolutely love the oatmeal raisin cookies. Flour does other things well, too.  \\n\\nFlour has an easy and convenient ordering system in which a server takes your order on a handheld device. So as you're looking at the baked goods in the case, the server talks to your from the other side of the counter and takes the order. Then you're treats are run up at the cashier and served up a few minutes later. \\n\\nThe staff here is outstandingly nice and efficient. They work extremely hard and keep the growing lines moving well. My family and I came in a sunny Sunday morning and it did not take long for us to get out treats. They package everything perfectly and make sure you're set to go as you pick up your treats. Our server was so nice and very helpful in completing our order. \\n\\nWe got several types of cookies--oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, and peanut butter--along with an apple muffin, a sticky bun, a slice of lemon meringue pie, a vegan chocolate muffin, and a brownie. We also got coffee and a fiery hot chocolate for drinks. Everything was very fresh and delicious. The oatmeal raisin cookies have such an amazing flavor and texture, which chewy goodness on the inside and a nice crunchy crust along the outside. The peanut butter cookies tasted exactly like peanut butter, and again had a perfect texture. The chocolate chip cookies have a bittersweet chocolate in them, so not everyone may like it. The meringue of the lemon meringue pie was perfectly done and the lemon had a perfect tang. The fiery hot chocolate, too, had wonderful flavor and was very satisfying and not overwhelmingly chocolate. Oh, and did I mention the oatmeal raisin cookies?  I tried one and then went back up to get more!!\\n\\nThe only downsides: crowds, availability of goods, and price. It can most definitely get crowded and it may be difficult to get a seat with the limited number of tables. There are seats along the window, though, so if you're coming in alone or with one other person, you'll likely find something. \\n\\nAnother downside is that you have to time it right if you're looking for certain treats. My family and I came in the late morning and only a few things--mainly bread--were out. As we enjoyed some cookies and hot drinks, more was being brought it. I wanted to try the fruit tart and a cupcake of some sort, but a pleasant staff member told me they don't put those out until later in the day. We also had to ask if the chocolate chip cookies were ready since they weren't out yet.  \\n\\nFlour is a pretty pricey, too. However, you do get what you pay for with great service and fresh treats. \\n\\nIf you're willing to spend a little, then you definitely need to check out Flour. Grab an oatmeal raisin cookie when you do!!"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Their food is absolutely delicious !

Perhaps by the time we got there, he was ready to go home. Our reservations were after 9pm. We were hardly greeted with a friendly hello. Ok, maybe the other parties he was serving weren't pleasant. I can understand that it takes a minute to shake off unpleasant people. I deal with unpleasant people every time I work, but that isn't a reason to be rude for the duration of dinner. \\n\\nI'm a pretty picky eater, so before arriving I did my research to ensure there would be something I liked. We knew straight away what to order. The waiter came to our table and asked what we wanted to drink. I didn't get his name until I looked at the bill because he never mentioned it. We both ordered water, which apparently wasn't the correct choice, because that response resulted in an eye roll. I let him know we were ready and he, again, rolled his eyes and took our order. I guess he wasn't ready for that. Or maybe the extra 45 seconds he had to take to get our order was inconveniencing him. I asked for stuffed chicken, but inquired if I could get it without prosciutto. Nope. It's already stuffed. Which was fine. But there was no other option given. He stared blankly and slow blinked me. As though my inquiry was the most irritating thing ever. We ordered, ate our food (which came out in a decent amount of time), and then decided on coffee and dessert. When asked, \\"can we also get two coffees?\\", he let out a grumble and said \\"ugh yeh, of course\\" and ended it with a chuckle and another eye roll... because now that was the most ludicrous thing he's heard all night. \\n\\nWe got our dessert and coffee, ate half (if that), paid our bill, and left. I was so disappointed by the attitude, I didn't want to be there anymore. He was friendly to the couple sitting beside us and to a party of three across from us, but treated us as though we just punched a puppy. I expect some sort of respect if I'm polite, not making the waiter run back and forth all night and demanding silly things, and I'm paying over $100 for dinner (again, no drinks).

It's one of those Asian Fusion/NW/Sushi/Steakhouse/etc. places. I dig restaurants that focus on one cuisine and do it well. Our group ordered a variety of items from the happy hour menu, bar menu, and dinner menu. Since work picked up the tab, we didn't scoff at the outrageously overpriced drinks and fare. There were a few very decent selections of wines by the glass, including a couple great local Pinot Noir, and a great if not egregiously overpriced champagne. The cocktails were boring and somewhat laughable, like the \\"homemade Cosmo\\" one woman ordered. Way to squeeze that lime, man. Did you guys make the cranberry juice? Methinks not. \\n\\nThe food. In a word? Confused. Another? Extra. Everything I tried from the bounty of dishes we ordered had far too many flavors on one plate or were obscenely saucy.

Upon us flagging the waiter down multiple times to indicate the mistake, he was unapologetic, stated that there was a kitchen mix up and continued making us wait, which was particularly egregious for the vegetarian who simply had to watch everyone else eat.  After it became clear we weren't happy, the waiter avoided us for the rest of the night, and we had to chase him down just to pay after having spent two hours in the venue, only a fraction of which was spent actually eating. \\n\\nThe food is decent enough, but certainly not worth the exorbitant fee (ten dollars for broth?

Bar Mezzana automatically adds a 20% gratuity for large parties, however it would have been nice to inform us ahead of time. I know most restaurants do this and since my previous career was as a server, I always tell the guests ahead of time about the added gratuity. But, not this time! Did they not think we were going to tip 20%? And, they also charge a 3% Kitchen administration fee, which is mentioned on their website, menu, and at the bottom of the check. On a more positive note, the restaurant had a nice ambience to it with and an open kitchen concept. Our server Chuck was extremely helpful in suggesting plates that we all could share. I highly recommend any of the crostini's, meatballs, and dates. Advice for large parties: make sure you ask your server if there will be an additional 20% gratuity added on before you even sit down or better yet when you make the reservation so that you can avoid the same situation I encountered.

However, this afternoon when I went to have my leftover, I noticed that only about a third of my food was packaged up by the waitress. I was extremely confused by this, as well as angered.

Overall though, super yummy!\\n\\nThe butternut squash pizza is a MUST HAVE - the combination of roasted butternut squash and bacon bits is amazing. The pizza is also pretty large, probably enough for 2 people. The steak and eggs was a good dish as well, my friend really enjoyed it. Best part was the bacon cheddar hash brown, it was SO GOOD!\\n\\nThe french toast has got to be one of my favorite dishes. Two large, thick slices of warm french toast, covered with fresh berries and butter and served with a side of maple syrup with pecans inside!

Ordering\\nTrev and I split the Bacon Cheese Burger ($8.99) - 1/3 lb. angus beef topped with pickles, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, mayo & mustard, bacon & American cheese. Served with fries or tots: we chose tots!\\n\\nWayne and Sumana split The Dude ($7.25) - 1/3 lb. angus beef topped with pickles, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, mayo & mustard, +cheese ($0.50). They upgraded to side salad ($1) with jalapeno ranch dressing. \\n\\nII. The burgers\\nThe patty had a great sear, but was cooked well done. It was meaty and flavorful. The bun was nice and gooey. My bun was too big for my burger patty, but Wayne and Sumana didn't have that problem. This may be because the patties are hand formed? The toppings were all good. I liked the chopped onions and lettuce. The mustard was on the top bun, which tasted great! The bacon on our burger was excellent. As Trevor said, \\"This is a great backyard burger.\\" I enjoyed it quite a bit.\\n\\nIII. The Fries/Sides\\nSumana really liked the fresh salad. She was surprised how fresh everything seemed since this is a little place inside a bowling alley. She mentioned the jalapeno ranch dressing was really great and spicy. Our tots were good, nicely fried. \\n\\nIV. Miscellaneous\\nThis place is located inside the Highland Lanes bowling alley. They only serve pepsi products so if you prefer Coke, you're out of luck. Everything is cooked to order and they have a great looking griddle back there. \\n\\nV. Value\\nWe have a new way to measure value. I ask the members how much they would pay for the burger they ate. We would pay anywhere from $6 to $7 for this burger. So this burger is a little on the high side since it's priced at $7 to $9 (including fries/tots). \\n\\nVI.

How does one share a biscuit sandwich or a single poached egg?

I liked my cheese pizza but I feel like you really have to actively try to mess up cheese pizza. \\n\\nThe tables come stocked with shakers filled with red pepper flakes, Parmesan cheese, oregano, and what we believed to be garlic salt. \\n\\nSomething I enjoyed about this place is that they really had an option for everyone. They offered gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian menu items. They had a create your own pizza option and offered a slice of the day. Unfortunately the slice of the day during our visit was not vegetarian but I'd visit again to see what creative pizza dish they come up with next. \\n\\n\\nBathrooms are in a hall way they share with another establishment.

Yes, it's THAT much of a difference.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\nInterior decoration. It's literally like you just left buckhead and landed somewhere far and exotic.\\n\\nThe music - even though between the arabic tracks they somehow mixed in some latin-american songs, spanish flamenco, AND a reggaeton track. \\n\\nThe dancer. It was a Tuesday night, so there was just one. My understanding is that they have more on the weekends. Dance with fire. Dance with the sword. Dance with those little bells on her fingers. Just cool and very skilled. She also pulled up every birthday boy and girl in the house to dance with her, and put on a great act with the tips and everything. definite 5 stars plus on that.\\n\\nThe experience. You take off your shoes, sit on the floor or pillows, and eat with your hands. Come on. Doesn't get much better than that :-) They wash your hands for you at your table twice for a three course meal, and three times if you get five courses (third time is with rosewater and orange blossom, which smells fantastic and you get to make a wish). \\n\\nThe Salad part of the pre-set 5-course dinner. It's 5 different veggies, fresh, cooked, or pickled, two pallet-cleansers, and a traditional hot sauce. Regardless of your salad preferences, you will find something you like.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nWine. I have never seen a wine list that poor for a restaurant of this price range. Ever. The two moroccan wines they offered have a \\"dessert wine\\" nose and taste pretty bad. Definitely too sweet and fruity to go with the food. Other wines were just not good brands, period. We ended up ordering their $40 Spanish red, which was tolerable, and OK for the price at best.\\n\\nTo top that off, they DO NOT ALLOW your own wine. Not with a cork fee, not any way at all. So even though we unknowingly brought a bottle of champagne to celebrate a special occasion, we ended up buying wine - because decent sparklings started at $90 and up.\\n\\nThe tea/dessert ceremony. Set-up and enthusiasm around the tea ceremony made us expect something outstanding. But the hot tea was lukewarm, and as sweet as simple syrup, and there was not an un-sweet or less sweet option. There was no choice of dessert - it was a pre-set pastry that was nothing to write home about. And the tea glass was tiny, smaller than an average coffee cup. I did like the pieces of fruit that came with dessert, that was a very nice touch.\\n\\nThe Ugly.\\n\\nFood. Yes, the food was way, way, WAY below expectations. The five course meal only allows you to pick your entr√©e. The \\"authentic\\" lentil  soup tasted like chili, but with lentils in it. The appetizer was a pastry with chicken in it, but covered in sugar and extremely greasy - so greasy that it made me nauseous just to smell it. Our main courses were simply amateur. The lamb shank that was so very recommended and oversold by our waiter was a big bone, covered with so much salt and spice, that we could not taste the actual meat on it. The other lamb entr√©e we ordered (Lamb Tajine or something like that) was extremely sweet, with sweet glazed onions and almonds, and tasted like it had at least a cup of sugar on top of it. It was also very bony, so there was not much meat to eat - not that it was good enough to be eaten anyway.\\n\\nOverall, my wallet is $200 lighter (dinner for two), I am 5lbs heavier after the ridiculous amount of sugar and fat I consumed, I am completely mesmerized with the belly-dancer performance and atmosphere, and utterly disappointed with my meal. The only way I go back is if they have some kind of buffet option, and not the preset meals - avoid those at all costs."},{"name":"Precision Pours - Coffee and Bakes","address":"1030 East South Boulder Rd","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"Great coffee, delicious pastries and a variety of teas make this cute little family-owned shop a personal favorite.

I got the low country boil which had corn, taters, shrimp, little onions and the andouille sausage that they put in everything. It would have been better if they had left the sausage whole instead of slicing it into disks but my intestines quickly turned this meal into soup anyway, so it doesn't matter.\\nI must say that they have the best bloody mary ever!

Let me explain...\\n\\nI love a good meal with all the bells and whistles; however, when I sit down and experience sticker shock at brunch, I then will ultimately expect food that will overwhelm my senses. I went with my friend and her daughter for brunch and a movie fully expecting the higher \\"ambiance\\" surcharge that seems to be present whenever I visit Atlantic Station. In fact, it has been awhile since I went back- so I was willing to try again. \\n\\nWe liked the menu and ended up ordering two delicious drinks (no pics sorry) - a coconut margarita (made with coconut tequila which was good) and my friend, another concoction of goodness. It was a good tumbler size but I suspect that one cocktail helped skyrocket my bill before we even ordered food.\\n\\nI ended up ordering a shrimp quesadilla- it actually was one of the lower priced options, and as you can see it was very pretty and filled with lots of shrimp and vegetables, my friend ordered a ceviche and her daughter got a gluten-free dish. We also had the guacamole which was good. Here is where I began to have my doubts- the dishes didn't send me into food ecstasy though. That \\"wow, you MUST try this/unbelievable can I have this again\\" reactions. All in all the dishes were prepared well, cooked, and presentation was good. The sides were ones her daughter couldn't have so my friend and I ate the corn and beans. Again, good.\\n\\n I was glad I enjoyed the meal, the conversation and the service. When our bills arrived our meals went well over $100. I am not complaining and certainly not a cheapskate when it comes to foodie fun and splurging - I just couldn't shake that weirdness of the meal feeling \\"that was all?!?\\"  As someone who will travel and try new dining options around Atlanta and seek out to enjoy authentic Mexican, Tex-Mex, etc. I kind of felt like the meal was just meh. Compared to the authentic taquerias, the stands, the hole in the walls, and local family run options- Rosa unfortunately has designer duds on good food, which falls a little short on value. \\n\\nThe pros- great atmosphere,  decent options, dietary flexibility for our dairy-free gluten-free/celiac youngest diner. Good service.\\n\\nThe cons- value shock, slight feeling pervades the meal of overpricing average food. \\n\\nI struggled to even post this because nothing was wrong with the food or the restaurant, but I left Atlantic Station knowing - Bottom line: it is a tough competitive restaurant market in Atlanta, and when I price comparison Rosa with the higher-end Midtown, Fourth Ward, EAV shining restaurant stars and on the other spectrum the local, family run Buford Highway and cultural area hidden gems, I am more apt to head there knowing the superstar meal is all around worth what I will get for the same price tag, or stronger meal for even less.

The meat cooked perfect, and just enough black pepper sauce to actually taste it and get a slight feeling of hot on your tongue. \\n\\nMy favorite Dim Sum dish was next, chicken feet in black bean sauce. The sauce was great and the chicken feet soaked up the correct amount of marinade to provide the ultimate tasty chicken feet.\\n\\nLastly i needed to have some noodle so I opted for the steamed beef rice noodle, the beef inside had a nice mixture of beef and spice, the noodle itself was a bit over cooked and a tad bland, Good thing I like sauce on my beef rice noodle as it arrived at the table with the sauce already on it, unfortunately I would have preferred more sauce as I did not have enough to soak all my noodle.\\n\\nThe service was top notch, but a little on the slow side, no fault of the servers.

Our first try, a group of us each ordered about three different items to try. Big mistake. They seem like small portions but boy do they fill you up. Let me try and think of them all. \\nCeviche- I wouldn't necessarily classify what they served us as ceviche but that's because I make a mean ceviche. To start, it was shrimps which I think is the worst kind of ceviche but i knew what it was when I ordered it. It came in some kind of red sauce with a very slight hint of lemon. The shrimp was most certainly cooked before being added into the sauce which defeats the point of a ceviche. It had minimal flavor and was my least favorite of what we tried. \\nFried pickles- yum. The breading was light and flavorful and not overbearing at all. Hip hip hooray. \\nClam chowder- crowd favorite. Good taste, too watery for my liking, but still comparable to a good creamy chowder. Way too much bacon on top which took away from the chowder itself but that's an easy fix. \\nFish taco (breaded)- wow that sauce. The fish was good, could use slightly more seasoning but the sauce is tasty enough I could see why they don't. The tortilla tasted homemade but ended up just picking at the fish since it was impossible to eat the taco without it falling apart. A good problem to have. \\nLobster taquitos- yum, but probably wouldn't do again \\nPower bowl- a LOT of food (and a boiled egg?) but a generous amount of seafood\\nLobster roll- yes. All the yes. The bun was so delicious on its own I could eat just that. But the lobster was great that day. So flavorful and substantial that it made sense it was lightly dressed.

How?\\n\\nSo, I've been to CK a few times before today. We made a special trip today because we just got back from New Orleans, where we found out that beignets are like crack. Seriously, we are addicted to them. And Creole Kitchen? Has beignets for breakfast. So we went.\\n\\nThey were legit as hell. I would have liked a couple of mine to be just sliiightly more fried, and I mean maybe a total of 30 seconds longer. They were puffy, which I like in a beignet--I've had some ones that were more dense, the puffy ones are good. Honest to goodness? I think I might like CK's beignets more than Cafe du Monde's.\\n\\nYeah, I said it.\\n\\nThe coffee isn't bad either, but if you like real dairy product in your coffee, be prepared to be disappointed. Fake creamer only--but the coffee seems to be super cheap and it's definitely drinkable.\\n\\nAs far as other food, I've had the \\"muffuletta\\" po-boy; let's be real, this is not a muffuletta at all, BUT, it is a delicious Italian sub and I will order it again. Hubs had a burger once that was passable but not delicious (it was cheap, though, so there's that). The house-made chips that come with the sandwiches are tasty.\\n\\nI would like to address the po' boy issue. I don't really feel like you can ding someone for not having the right po' boy bread because you can't get that bread in Columbus without having someone make it special for you (which would drive up the overhead considerably at a place like Creole Kitchen). Po' boy bread isn't nearly as chewy as a baguette, and I honestly think that a softer sub roll is probably a more palatable substitute for this type of sandwich. \\n\\nBecause of some food inconsistencies, and because their customer service is not exactly friendly if you're not a regular (although the chef himself is nice; he had us put powdered sugar on our own beignets so we got the right amount--the counter staff is often curt with us, but not *rude* or anything... we did have friendly service when we, erm, went back for lunch this afternoon), I'm only giving CK four stars. HOWEVER, this is definitely a place to hit up if you are in the King-Lincoln district. It's good, cheap, tasty take-out. Definitely superior to the Wendy's down the street.\\n\\n(Also, in a place like this, I think it's much more likely to run out of stuff because they are trying to keep their overhead really low, so they likely err on the side of under-ordering. It's one of those places where you have to be a little more patient to help keep the prices low, y'know?

Lobster Rolls were very high on my list to eat whenever possible. We ate Luke's Lobster on our last day in Boston and it ended up being my favorite meal! I thought that I would be sick of seafood by this time but everything we ate at Luke's was absolutely delicious. I also really loved how Luke's wasn't a fancy sit down place that overcharged for seafood. Instead, Luke's is a small and casual fining restaurant where you eat and leave within 30 minutes or so. You simply order up in the front, find a table, and then wait patiently for your food! Prices were very reasonable also I thought. \\n\\nWe ordered the Luke's Trio (1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll, 1/2 shrimp roll), some New England Style Clam Chowder and 1/2 a lobster tail (chilled, served with lemon butter) for an additional $5. Out of the three rolls I sampled, my favorite ended up being the crab roll! It was truly fantastic with just the right amount of seasoning so that the crab flavor really came through. The shrimp roll was also equally delicious. Nicely cooked and seasoned perfectly once again. The lobster roll was different in a sense that it wasn't drowning in mayonnaise like some of the other lobster rolls I've tasted. I loved it. I think Luke's technique of truly letting the taste of the product shine through is one worth noting. You're here to taste the seafood, and not the sauce that accompanies it. I didn't care too much for the actual lobster tail that came with our meal though. It didn't add anything and I thought it was a little over done. I did however love the clam chowder here. Nice textures running through the chowder and a decent amount of clams. Delicious and went along nicely with the rolls. \\n\\nLuke's Lobster is something special. Everything tasted fresh and we really enjoyed our last meal in Boston. I didn't even like lobster rolls all that much until my recent trip to the East Coast and Luke's easily fall into my top 5 for seafood rolls. The only downside is the portion size. Definitely order more because you won't want to share! I'll be back when for sure when I'm in the area!

My husband's was the right temperature. Mine was well done. Explained to the waitress. She stated she would have the burger cooked again. The second one came out, as overlooked as the first one. The hostess stood by for me to check. She saw it was over cooked and took it back. She comes back to say they would cook a 3rd time. I told her we didn't want to a 3rd try. I asked for a GM. She said there was not one there. She also stated she would not charge me for the burger I did not eat. Really? Did you think I would? So a \\"manager\\" comes over and asked if I wanted a dessert. He insisted he would speak to the chef. Really? What's difficult about cooking a medium well burger? He/she got it right for my husband. I turned down that option and asked for our check. So I didn't eat. I sit there while my husband eats and they come out with a bill for my husband's meal. So we paid for my husband's meal. I got a sorry. \\nSTAY AWAY FROM HERE!

Everything came out super hot which was a big plus. I had the linguine and clams which was excellent and a nice sized portion. My husband had the king crab which was also delicious.

They did a really nice job with the space. I enjoy how it's set up with different sections (rooftop deck, upstairs bar, downstairs bar, and large open space in the back. Somewhere to comfortably sit for everyone depending on what you're looking for. I do wish they'd put some large TV's in the back room for sports games. There's a seriously lack of good sports bars in PDX, and this space would be perfect for it, while others not interested in sports can enjoy any of the other lovely areas. \\n\\nAnyway, to the food and spirits - at first glance at the menu was little uninspiring, kinda the same ol' bready and fried pub grub. But in-person the execution is definitely elevated. I had a Po'Boy special the night I was in, along with a side salad. The sandwich was excellent, and the salad greens super fresh, not just the same old mixed greens you see thrown on a plate at every other joint. The pickled onions and dressing were also a step up. I'm happy to see a housemade Veggie Burger on the menu, and look forward to trying it. I really wish they'd offer a decent GF bun for the sandwiches so I could come here more often with my wife. \\n\\nThe drinks were tasty, though I wasn't able to try their own spirits, which I believe they're now serving.

I've been here a few times since my first encounter, most recently just last week for lunch with some friends and I must say the food is pretty good and fresh tasting! There's limited competition in the Puerto Rican food department here in Austin, but I can recommend this spot with high praises. \\n\\nI've had the Fricase de Pollo, this is slow beer braised chicken with rice. The chicken was very tender and tasty, would have been perfect but it needed more salt. the rice was very fresh in taste and the accompanying mixed greens was green and fresh! I', putting this in the rotation\\n\\nAlcapurrias, this is a beef in a fried plantain dough mixture. This very unique tasting to me. If you like fried sweet plantains, this is definitely a go! They way they cook it together is very appetizing no pun intended as this is an appetizer.\\n\\nTostones, this is another appetizer, these are fried plantain chips that are crispy but not sweet, not bland either and the the dip is very complimentary in flavor.\\n\\nCarne Frita, this is fried pork with rice and beans. This dish is pretty good the beans are also very delicious you get a choice of red beans or black beans. the fried pork was very delicious and plentiful. It was little dry, but the flavor was great.\\n\\nChicharron de Pollo, this is fried chicken with rice and beans, another delicious dish the fried chicken was a little dry but very well tasting everything else was 2 thumbs up\\n\\nMofongo Aniversario Relleno with Fricase de Pollo. Chago's serve this classic Puerto Rican with your meat or seafood of choice very well done as close to the real deal without being in the island or the BX!\\n\\nI haven't got around to trying the desserts but I definitely recommend this spot.

They give it to you in aluminum container whether your order it to-go or not, and the amount of sauce they drizzle on the top (not sure what the red and white sauces are called) is generous.

Not even the 'most important' kind of games.  And from what I understand this is never going to happen because their system isn't rigged for that.  What this means is that while you are watching your sports game you have A: no subtitles and B: indie pop rock blaring in your ear like Foster the People.

It was also really big, possibly even enough for sharing with another person if you got an app for starters. My boyfriend got the chicken wings, catfish po'boy and gumbo.

Today, however, was an exception. It started with our waiter not being able to get my wife's order correct, then our appetizers were served to the wrong table. Though the potstickers were fresh and the eggrolls crispy, the sauces seemed recycled; the dumpling dipping sauce looked and tasted old, and the sweet and sour sauce for the eggrolls was congealed. Didn't know it could do that. Before we were served our main course, our server brought us our check, and was yelling to the staff in the back all the while. When the entrees arrived, they came plateless and I had to ask another staff member to bring us some. House of Louie usually serves delicious and spicy General Tso's chicken. Today's was off. Way off. Something that smelled an awful lot like liquid smoke cut through the air over my dish, and the sauce seemed more like a tangy barbeque than the sweet-hot I've come to expect. My wife's scallion beef was overloaded with onions, overcooked to the point that they retained little flavor. After waiting for our server to come back and seeing no sign of her, I flagged down a bus boy and asked for some to-go containers so we could get out of there. We boxed it up and went to pay. The lady at the front was rude, and before I even had a chance to sign for my bill she rushed off mumbling.

Everyone always starts their reviews with \\"I wish Yelp did half star ratings\\" but I really really wish I could for this place. Food was great, but for the price point, the service could definitely be improved.\\n\\nI came here as a solo tourist on one of my stopovers in Boston. This was the first place that popped up on Yelp, so I figured I'd try it. I didn't know it was such a popular place. I checked out of my hotel early so by the time I got to the restaurant, it was about 10 minutes before opening time on a Tuesday. There was already a long line! There was a family in front of me, and they were told they would have to wait an hour before they could be seated. Yikes. \\n\\nLuckily, I was solo, so I got the last seat at the bar! \\nThe place is very, very small... especially by the bar area, since I was on the end close to where the staff go in and out, staff members were always brushing past me. It was also very busy, and although you could tell the servers were nice and were trying to have good manners, they came off as dismissive and missed a lot of things, which affected the service. Now that was why I wanted to take off a star. Particularly, I saw on Yelp that they had an uni crostini and I asked the server about it. She said they didn't have it that day. After I ordered my food, the man two seats down from me was served an uni crostini... what the heck??? I mean by that point I had already ordered something else so I was pretty disappointed.\\n\\nHowever, the food and the beer were seriously awesome. I was seated next to another solo traveler from California, and we got the same ale, which was great.\\n\\nI had a Katama Bay Oyster which was SO good. It was buttery, delicious, and not too briny.\\n\\nSea urchin bucatini (which was the daily special) was delicious. Think a lighter, more ocean-y pasta carbonara topped with uni. I completely cleaned my plate. It was amazing.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come here again if I was in Boston, and definitely to take friends and family out. In my opinion it is a must experience here because it's the quintessential New England seafood joint.

Antico's opening at The Battery coincided with the ballpark's opening in March 2017. As a big fan and longtime neighbor and customer of the original Antico that opened near Georgia Tech and Atlantic Station in 2009, I think this new Antico at The Battery is just as good as, if not better than, the original location thanks to more seating and ample free parking.\\n\\nPark in The Battery's Red Deck at 2565 Circle 75 Parkway. Parking in this deck is free for the first 4 hours. You'll want to park and exit on level 3. You won't have to walk far because Antico is right next to the deck.\\n\\nThis Antico location is spacious and bright. It's got an open kitchen, a fully built-out bar with TVs, a dining room with large communal tables, bench seating, and high-tops, a cafe and gelato bar with cafe/bistro-style seating, and a nice, covered patio. Naturally, the stars of the show are the two Italian-import, hand-built, wood-burning Acunto ovens. The ovens are named San Giovanni and San Nicola and they burn at upwards of 700-900 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nThe menu at this location is the same as the original location. There are five red pizzas and five white pizzas, one size only, priced at $20-22 per pizza. There's also the special Sophia pizza (bufala, cipollini onions, roasted mushrooms, white truffle oil) for $27 and three calzones priced at $18-19 each.\\n\\nI tried a couple of my favorites, the tried and true Margherita D.O.P. ($20) and the San Gennaro ($22). They were just as delicious as the pies baked in Westside. D.O.P. stands for \\"denominazione di origine protetta\\" or protected designation of origin, an Italian certification ensuring the San Marzano tomatoes used in the pizza are genuine. Other ingredients in the Margherita include bufala (buffalo mozzarella), basil, and garlic.\\n\\nEvery pizza is made-to-order and cooked fast. The pizzas have thin, floppy crusts with the bottoms and outer edges slightly charred. The Margherita is a simple pizza and it tasted great. The San Gennaro is made with salsiccia (Italian sausage), dolce piccante pepper (sweet and spicy peppers), bufala, and cipolline (onions). It was awesome. The small red peppers and chunks of sausage burst with flavor. And of course, the tomato sauce and buffalo mozzarella cheese, both on this pizza and the Margherita, were very good. The crusts (on both) were delightfully chewy as well.\\n\\nNext to the hand washing station, fountain drink machine, water dispenser, and disposable eating utensils is a small self-serve condiment bar. I love it. It's got different types of olive oil (spicy and regular), a small bucket of Calabrian chili peppers, grated Parmesan cheese, freshly minced garlic, two types of red peppers (one is a paste and the other is dried crushed red pepper), finely ground black pepper, and salt. I especially like the mildly spicy Calabrian peppers and the pungent raw garlic.\\n\\nThe cafe has a simple menu with coffee drinks like espresso ($3), cappuccino ($3.50), macchiato ($3), and iced beverages (e.g. iced coffee for $3.50 and iced latte for $4). The gelato bar offers a dozen different flavors in single ($5), half/half ($6), and cone ($6) servings. Flavors include cioccolato (chocolate), Fabbri amarena (Amarena cherry), vaniglia (vanilla), fragola (strawberry), limone (lemon), caramello salato (salted caramel), pistacchio, biscotti e crema (Italian almond biscuits and cream), cappuccino, stracciatella (gelato with chocolate shavings), nocciola (hazelnut), and cioccolato menthe (mint chocolate).\\n\\nService was good.

It's a large amount of food, so I would recommend sharing dishes to try more things. Their oysters are FRESH, it's like you can taste the ocean for real. I LOVE the shrimp actually lol.  When I went there with two of my friends, we ordered the usual above, and fried clams & north end cioppino. To be honest, I think while the clams was fresh in the clam chowder, it was still missing something. I would say that for the cioppino as well. I do love the variety that it comes with though. The fried clam was pretty good and finally, the lobster roll is fresh and satisfying. I'm not an expert on tasting lobster roll, so I don't want to say this place has the best one.

The good things: the space it well designed and very inviting, our server was excellent and the food came out very fast.

The Benedict was very good and the bacon was incredible. I don't know how they flavor it that way with sriracha but my husband and I just loved it. The biscuits were also unique and delicious, fall apart flaky. The bad: we were very disappointed in the coffee and the place is half coffee house. Perhaps it is different if you order a dark roast at the coffee bar but what we were served in the restaurant was extremely weak. There is also no decaf option (other than espresso) which I get seems to be a boutique coffee thing these days but it's pretty disappointing to a pregnant woman. It was also virtually impossible to have access to creamer. There seemed to be only two pitchers that were passed around the entire place. The confusing: the menu says that coffee is bottomless but we were told that it was $1 per refill (our server did comp ours though when we pointed this out). A few ppl have raved about the eggs but mine was just not good and almost cold. They didn't taste seasoned and there was no salt or pepper readily available in a slammed brunch spot.

In addition to their own taps, they have a quite a few guest taps. They had a fantastic selection of local craft brews - you can tell they have a respect for everyone else's craft in the area. They had something for everyone: several different IPAs, lagers, stouts, sours, and ciders. There was also a nice mix of easy drinking beers and bolder beers. Even ignoring their own beers (which were awesome), the selection of guest taps alone makes it likely the best craft beer bar in Oviedo.\\n\\nTheir bartenders are super friendly.

This location is ALWAYS busy once they start dinner service at 5:30pm. I find the check in process to be a bit rough and (to my knowledge) do not take reservations. This could be easily solved with a POS system upgrade. One that allows for online reservations and an online waitlist. If they were a restaurant who only got busy on weekends, I could understand keeping the system the way it is but frequent 45 - 75 minute wait times on weekdays demand some attention. They could also use a better space to keep up with demand but that would be a little more costly. The question on everyone's mind- is the wait worth it? Well that depends. Is your party 3 or less? Are you hungry but not starving? If your answered yes, wait for a seat. If you answered no, go somewhere else. The popular items are great but they are served family style which is meant to provide a slightly bigger portion with no side item meant to share. Here it seems more as a greedy attempt to charge more to provide a decent meal. Side items are expensive and main items all came in fairly small portions. Not quite a tapas bar, as the prices don't support being called a tapas bar in my eyes. The worst part? The food is actually pretty good. You feel the soul of Portland slipping away and more of a New York greed start to infect the small, locally owned restaurant and it saddens me."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"39 John F Kennedy St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I am writing this as I just walked back to my car in below freezing weather after the employee by the name of Harley tells me their closing 20 minutes early. \\n\\nI find this ludicrous as there were still 15 or so people eating, lettuce still in the bin, and what appeared to be quite a few people (young employees) just \\"hanging out\\" around the back counter. \\n\\nThis is one of the most poorly run establishments I've been to in quite some time.

Only thing was pad Thai noodles a bit over cooked and very soft and the kombocha squash also bit too soft and over cooked. Other than that great food. What I do is roast the pumpkin or squash first in the oven with a glaze of brown sugar ( just a bit) and let it carmelize and add it towards the end to the curry and it is the bomb!

Sure, it has the staples -- pad kee mao, pad thai, chicken satay. It even has some great imported beers: Chang is a great pairing with just about everything served here. However, all the food is prepared in a very American, rich, fat-fried style. This is not to say it's bad, just that you should expect that, when you order chicken, for instance, you'll get chicken strips. This approach has the distinct advantage of being more filling, meaning the value for money is exceptional here -- every entree would hapilly satisfy two to four adults. This is not the place for a light, traditional thai dish, but if you want a fresh take on those same dishes with heavy American influence, Gin Thai is definitely worth a visit."},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Hmm. Pricey for small portions, long wait, and mediocre food.\\n\\nI've been wanting to try Patrizi's for a long time after hearing rave reviews about their fresh pasta. I even made two trips here before getting to try the food because of how long the lines are. I finally went on a week-day, and got their Pomodoro ($11.50) with a meatball ($5). My boyfriend got The Great Leopold ($11) with Italian sausage ($5). While in line, there was someone passing out free samples of a sliced zucchini topped with Parmesan and olive oil. This was the best thing I had all night. \\n\\nWhile ordering I observed that the pasta might not be made to order, as I saw a large batch of pre-made pomodoro plates in a large metal cabinet. It puzzled me as to why despite the pastas being pre-made in batches, it still took ~25 minutes for our food to come out after we ordered. After waiting in line, and waiting for our food for almost an hour, we were disappointed to find how small the portions are when our food arrived. For $10+ dollars a serving from a food truck, I'm wondering why it was so expensive to make a serving of pasta that looks like it's for a small person. I understand that part of food overhead cost can be attributed to ambiance, but we were literally served in an outside area with old/minimal decorations from a food truck. Also, the $5 meatball... it was the size of 2 regular meatballs combined. Despite all this, I was still optimistic about the food. 5 stars on Yelp for a reason right? \\n\\nWrong. The meatball was extremely typical. I genuinely prefer the taste of HEB pre-made meatballs over these. The noodles... instead of being al dente, the texture was this weird combination of firm but limp. I tried the Leopold and it was no better. The sauces on both pastas were unremarkable and slightly bland. I liked the Italian sausage though, but once again it was no better than what you can find anywhere else. \\n\\nI usually try to chalk up bad restaurant experiences to an off-day, but just so much was off about this experience that I am not willing to come back again. $16 and $16.5 for two small plates of pasta with protein... not worth it!"},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Try and get yourself seated downstairs so you can enjoy the amazing and unusual wall art (make sure to check out the downstairs bathroom too, its pretty damn cool).\\n\\nAside from of having plenty of different kinds of beer on tap, ensuring that you'll be able to get your favorite brew, a trip to Redbones also will usually entail a wait to get seated, eating too much, and very sticky fingers when you're through with your meal.

Usually when I'm writing a review it's because the place is out of this world amazing or depths of hell horrible. This place is neither.

In fact I hope one day I get to change this review to 5 stars, but it's not there yet. I think it was underestimated how in demand the sushi would be because the wait is so long. They get backed up quick, which would be fine if when you call for a takeout the phone was actually answered or you were given any indication of wait times. After trying to call in twice I rushed over thinking they might not take phone orders. Come to find out when I get there the girl behind the counter is taking one. I order 4 rolls to go and wait, and wait and wait. This poor mom who had her infant and was successful at ordering a togo was left waiting an unreasonable amount of time. Three guys ordered food after me. Two ordered ramen and one rolls. The ramen came out promptly and the two finished way before I walked out with my rolls while the one guy still hadn't gotten his food. They really need to work out the kinks and timing, but more so they need to open their mouths and tell people how long the wait will be. I waited 45 minutes and I got there 10 minutes after they opened. I'm glad they are doing well, but for that wait time I could drive downtown, get sensational sushi and get back to the office.

I know the potential was there for me to be detained at the door since I regularly dress like an unmade bed and most of my references come from decades before the clientele here was even born. But make no mistake: I enjoyed my two-hour visit here, and I think if you come with an open mind and the ability to try food you may not immediately be familiar with, you'll have plenty to enjoy here.\\n\\nBut let's also address the ominous-yet-delicious elephant in the room: there are a few rules to play by here. Food is brought out when it is brought out, as the backlog of dishes to prepare from the culinary team dictates, hence why your party of four may be eating in shifts. That's why they recommend you order plates the majority of your party would like to share because you are kind of eating in shifts. It sounds jarring, but believe me, it is manageable. Really, the only other point of contention for the masses will probably be the bit about substitutions being \\"politely declined.\\" And I can understand that: the chef made the dish one particular way, and to switch stuff out is kind an affront to what they may have been going for. If you're fine with both of those stipulations, wonderful! Tasty n Alder will see you now, provided you get here before they go on a 90-minute wait.\\n\\nWe arrived on a Monday night a little after 6:00 and got one of a handful of tables remaining in the dining room, with the patio outside running one wall and around the corner to the next already at capacity. (By the time we left around 8:00, the wait to get in was bordering on the two-hour mark.) The dining room is made up of tables and banquette-style seats, plus a bar near the back wall by the kitchen area. There is not a lot to really look at, which is perfect for people watching. And you will want to people watch at this place.\\n\\nWhile we had numerous food runners and cocktail runners helping us out, our server, Greta, took outstanding care of us. She walked us through the way the restaurant operates (since only Dad had been here before, and he had nothing but praise to say for it) and was gracious with our questions and deliberations that stretched nearly 15 minutes.\\n\\nEventually we got it figured out, though not before a round of cocktails made by a team that does not mess around. I started with a Meadowlark before moving to a Kilt Lifter, which left me not so much in a state of being lifted as it did in a state of bewilderment by how good BBQ bitters can be. The cocktail menu is extensive, as is the regular menu, and even if you are the world's pickiest eater, I have no doubt you will find something here that is right up your alley.\\n\\nWe opted to go with the pork chop, Baja tacos and gaucho ribeye, plus some sides. And while they were delivered in shifts, as cautioned, it's not like they were brought out with 20-minute gaps between dishes. All told, we had everything we ordered on the table within seven minutes of the first plate being dropped off. And wow, was it good. It's rare for everyone to agree on the overall quality of taste and cooking preparation, but Tasty n Alder makes it look easy. With food this mouthwatering, it is easy to see how the waits to get a table here climb into the stratosphere.\\n\\nBut before we could free up our table for other hungry guests, we had to have dessert, right? Right. And that's when the lemon tart showed up. My folks loved it, ranking it up there with the best they have had, while I nursed a scotch from the surprisingly varied after dinner drink menu.\\n\\nAll in all, you can label this place as relying on too many gimmicks, or trying to create an air of demand with limited seats. But I sincerely think you would be selling this place short. Sure, they do things differently, but if I learned anything from those \\"Police Academy\\" movies, different can be good. Come with an open mind, an empty stomach and a thirst for something out of the ordinary.

The worst part was the wooden board it came on which has black mould In the grain that I could scrape off in a paste with my knife. The fries I ordered as a side had obviously been re-fried as they were chalky. My girlfriend's cheese dog took an extra 15 minutes to come out. It was ok, nothing to write home about.

Definitely different than you're like likely to get elsewhere, and well worth the gamble. The FOS was excellent. We aren't quite \\"connoisseurs\\", but we eat a lot of FOS. The key to the Lion's Table FOS was that they didn't try to do too much with it. In our opinion, the place where people fail at FOS is when they try to get too inventive. FOS, in its simplest form, is nearly perfect, so having a good FOS is about executing the classic as it is intended, not about re-inventing the wheel.

We got bread right away. We ordered two shared plates that he recommended: the crab cakes and the duck. Incredible!!! The crab cakes were unique, not dry at all. Jeff recommended sopping up the butter sauce from the crab cakes with the break. The duck dish was amazing. He gave us the tip of stick our fork into the duck piece and turning to pry apart the meat. Then you add it to the bun, add the sauce and Kimchi and dig in! We ordered two more cocktails - old fashioned for my husband and sazerac for me. Our entree was the lamb which was split on to two plates and was still a large amount of food. The carrots were a little overcooked for my personal preference, but the mashed potatoes were amazing and the lamb itself was very, very good. We'd asked for it the way the chef prepares it - so medium rare. It definitely seemed more on the rare side - but it was very delicious.

Nay nay my review reading friends.\\nIt all started with a romantic trip to the mountains with my Valentine. We randomly picked a Food Network episode from Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives featuring Guy Fieri and Atlanta Uber Chef G. Garvin. They were featuring a (seemingly) nondescript hole in the wall called Yakitori Jinbei. As we prepared to yawn and watch a Law and Order rerun, we were suddenly impaled with images of homemade sauces and marinades requiring up to 24 hours to perfect. Korean fried chicken, pork katsu ramen, and spicy chili wings made us salivate so much, a small towel was needed. When we heard the fascinating story about Chef/Owner Dr. Choi, we planned our pilgrimage to this Korean/Asian fusion House of Food for the very next night. We grabbed three of our foodie friends and promised them a unique dining experience that only an optometrist could deliver. Yes, your eyes don't deceive you folks, Dr. Choi went from dilating peepers to preparing panko pork and the world is a better place because of it.\\nWe started off with some house made pineapple Sake which was insane. \\nThe good doctor/restaurateur  appeared like an angel from culinary heaven and chatted with us about the Food TV episode and what he would recommend. Not one to argue with a \\"sight specialist\\",  we filled our table with the most amazing Asian flavors.

Mochi is an acquired taste but everyone at our table \\"acquired\\" the taste lickety split. \\nBack to the low Yelp score... Dr Choi never changed the name of the place when he recently took over,  so the old reviews unfairly bring down the new restaurant's score. \\nIf you want an extraordinary dining experience and don't mind driving OTP, race on over to the NEW Yakitori Jinbei and allow this former optometrist to blow your socks off.

Not too saucy, not too oily, and the right amount of crispness.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the rest of the dishes were all begging us for reasons to really enjoy them. The grilled octopus was far too salty and prepared to that rubbery texture that turns many off of octopus. The lobster sliders came on really dry...like, falls-apart-in-your-hand dry...bread and were also quite salty.\\n\\nThe bigger struggles were with the entrees. The risotto was undercooked, so the texture was a little too far on the al dente side and became a real distraction. Flavor was fine, though. The grilled bavette steak was cooked to a nice medium, but was hardly the preparation that you feel happy about experiencing at a restaurant. It tasted essentially like a steak with Worcestershire sauce that anyone could cook up at home. The same underwhelming experience was the signature of the arctic char. Skin-on (no problem there), and overcooked, but saved somewhat by the curry lentils underneath. As you can see, every dish had redeeming qualities with lots of potential, but just couldn't pull it all together.\\n\\nOverall, the inconsistencies across dishes and within dishes, themselves, leaves Porto as just another run-of-the-mill Mediterranean restaurant. The location likely adds to the steeper prices vs value on the plate, but it's the cost that requires us to be more critical of the dishes. Smaller portions, higher prices, and unpredictable results on the plate? I can't see any reason to rush back, as we can get a comparable experience at tons of places around the city...or around the same block. There are tons of high ratings for Porto on Yelp, though, so perhaps we experienced an off night. Regardless...for us, on that night, we had an unfortunate 2-star experience."},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Such a great spot for drinks and dinner!

I will stop my review right here because I've gotta plan my next view visits here.\\n\\nAlso, if you're a student, I highly recommend coming here for breakfast and coffee, and then go to the Boston Public Library to study.

Before I go on, let me caveat this review by saying that I am by no means a doughnut connoisseur. I've been to a number of \\"great\\" donut shops and often times a doughnut tastes just like a doughnut. \\n\\nI tried the crunchy mister and the orange pistachio. The crunchy mister (&3.50) is a savory donut with cheese and ham but it has a sweetness to it. I really liked the slightly sweet and savory combination. The orange pistachio donut was a yeast donut. I have no idea what that means but it was a lot more dense and breadlike. I thought the orange glaze was too sweet. \\n\\nLocated in a small strip mall with some parking just outside. Went on a weekday and there was a minimal wait and we got our order almost immediately after we ordered. I definitely recommend the crunchy mister. There are also a lot of other items that look very yummy!"},{"name":"JJ's Fresh From Scratch","address":"2950 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious! \\nFor starters this restaurant is in walking distance from my house which is alway a plus! My husband had been before and enjoyed his meal so he recommended we check it out together this evening. I know most of the reviews compare it to that other place with bowls and salsa, but this is actually really different! They have different rice and bean options and even offer eggplant! My husband ordered the pork and rice bowl and I had a salad bowl with steak. The portion sizes are perfect! I ate my entire meal without feeling stuffed but still completely satisfied. The only thing I would change would be the salad mix. It was fresh, but for my personal taste I prefer all green mixes. We will definitely be visiting here again soon!

As soon as we arrived to Boston we checked into the hotel took a shirt nap and headed over to Neptune's around 2pm thinking the wait can't be that bad since it's an off hour. Wrong.. 1.5hrs wait said the host but actual wait was a bit more than that. We got the $75 dollar oysters appetizer platter with shrimp cocktail, Dungeness crab meat, lobster, clam and mussels. chowder, Johnny cake and both kind of the lobster roll. Everything was great. I'll be honest. None of these menus will blow your mind. If you are spending this kind of money on seafood anywhere else, my experience tells me that you will get this quality of fresh seafood or delicious lobster roll else where. Yes there lobster roll consist a lot more meat than your average Yankees or else where but keep in mind that the price is higher than most of the places by $5-6 maybe even more. However they are seasoned to perfection where it accentuates the lobster very well compared to others. Does it make it significantly better than others worth the 2hr wait? Not really.\\n\\nThe wait isn't Soo bad since you can put your name down and walk around north end or even walk a little to quincy market area.\\n\\nWhy the 5 stars? \\nTheir freaking Johnny cake!!!!! This is probably the best thing I've eaten in Boston. Enjoy your seafood while you are there but make sure you get the Johnny cake!!!! It's a explosion of flavor in your mouth from sweet, savory, briny, smokiness.

Food not coming, so we checked on the food.  Did not see the food that we ordered.  The waitress said she had the food.  I looked and it was not what I ordered.  She had an alternative suggestion.  I said I wanted what I ordered.  I wanted a fish taco with beans and rice.  Simple, huh?  Not for these guys.  So I told the supervisor what I ordered.  It came out correctly.

You take the elevator downstairs and the restaurant is quaint and authentic. The food is delicious, the wait staff is energetic and wonderful, and the restaurant as a whole feels like a hidden gem in Atlanta. \\n\\nThings I like: The food at La Grotta is authentic Italian food and is fresh and delicious. All of the pasta is homemade and the dishes are all delicious. They also have homemade limoncello! I have never had a bad meal here. One of my favorite dishes to order is the Gnocchi. The staff at La Grotta is also amazing. The waiters at the restaurant are often Italian and they all have big personalities that make you feel welcome. You will not be let down by the food or service here. \\n\\nThings I didn't like: Nothing! I have always loved my experience at La Grotta. However, it can be difficult to get a reservation here at times since the restaurant is small. I would suggest calling to make a reservation, some of the online booking sites are not accurate as to what their availability actually is on a given night. \\n\\nOverall, La Grotta is the place to come for fresh and authentic Italian food in Atlanta.

I am starving and I know he is also. So I tell the Hostess that there will be 2 of us. For the moment it would be me and I was going to have a drink and some appetizer or 2 while waiting for him. There were many open tables so it shouldn't have been a problem.....right ??? Wrong !! This young woman told me, now get this as I've never been told this at ANY restaurant in Boulder nor anywhere else I've ever lived UNLESS it was waiting for a large party of people.....that I could inform her as to when my husband arrived and SHE WOULD SEAT US AT THAT TIME.

Their Facebook page is so friendly and has shared the story of their restaurant as it was opening and now, as it adds new elements to its menu.\\n\\nThis was my first \\"real ramen\\" in a ramen restaurant so I got the Kokoro Tonkotsu Shoyu which is pork broth, cashu, bamboo shoots, seaweed, green onion and onion. My friend got the Creamy Deluxe Chicken Ramen which I was excited to see added to the menu! It comes with chicken broth, bamboo shoots, cashu, pumpkin, broccoli, seaweed, corn and green peas. They had a promotion for their flavoured beverages so I got the lychee fruit pop and a free katsu. \\n\\nMy Kokoro Tonkotsu Shoyu was beautiful! Oh my goodness, look at that seaweed heart! If you have not had a soft poached egg in your soup, you have no lived. Divine. The broth was so earthy and heart-warming. It reminded me of miso but also had the extreme super power to feed your soul. I instantly felt better. Amazing!\\n\\nMy friend's Creamy Deluxe Chicken Ramen came I thought they also brought the free katsu. Little did I realize that I had stolen a piece of his fried chicken for his soup! How mortifying I did such a thing but we laughed about it. Wayne also found his soup quite delightful.\\n\\nThen the ACTUAL free katsu arrived. Traditionally made with chicken, this cutlet was made with pork and served with a sriracha aioli. Delicious! I wrote to Kokoro Ramen directly about their noodles. They do not currently make them in-house but they do get them from a Japanese ramen noodle company. I can attest to their eggy deliciousness! They want to make their own noodles in the future which is very exciting.\\n\\nI hope Kokoro Ramen has a long and healthy foodie life at 5695 Victoria Drive. Now that I have been in there, tasted the fantastic food and been served by the lovely staff I can not wait to go back. The golden lights that hang in the window make this quite eating oasis in South Vancouver.\\n\\nFor full review check out my site: http://www.suziethefoodie.com/restaurant-review-kokoro-ramen-victoria-vancouver/"},{"name":"Coco Hut Restaurant","address":"8328 Capstan Way, Suite 1118","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"When I arrived, I wasn't greeted and I had to wait around for 10 mins before the waitress even acknowledged my presence. \\n\\nWhen a table finally cleared up, the waitress apologized for the wait and ushered me to take a seat. After I sat down, a older waitress came over and barked at me for sitting at that seat because that table was reserved. I didn't mind getting up but the way she said it was really rude, especially considering that I had already waited for so long to be seated.\\n\\nI told her that the other waitress seated me, she went into the kitchen and I overheard her saying to the other waitress \\"Why did you tell her to sit there?\\"\\n\\nWhile I was waiting for a seat I also witnessed the older waitress roll her eyes in annoyance when a group asked her where their rice was. Their chicken had already arrived but their rice hadn't. She answered impatiently \\"It's coming, okay?\\"\\n\\nAfter I had finally secured a table, no menus were brought over to me. Instead the waitress just asked what I wanted. I had already looked up reviews online so I told her I wanted a curry beef combo. \\n\\nWhen the food arrived,  the younger waitress was very apologetic about the table confusion, which I appreciated.\\n\\nAnyways, the curry beef was pretty tasty! It's not as creamy as some other places, it was on more on the watery side, but it was still good. The beef brisket was tender, with the perfect ratio of lean to fatty pieces.\\n\\nOverall, come here for the food, not the service.

The food was the highlight -- broccoli and cheddar lived up to its advance billing. I got the risotto with chicken and arugula. Be warned if you order this -- it's not risotto. More like an Israeli pearl cous cous. I didn't mind because it was delicious but it wasn't what was described on the menu. Dessert was a hazelnut chocolate cake that was good but the least impressive of the 3 dishes. Oh. And it took 30 mins because they forgot to place the order.

I told them on which app I made it on and it took them a hot minute to find it. They did and we were promptly seated. I should have told them that I preferred sitting up by the bar on the 3rd floor, but I was perfectly fine with sitting on the 1st near a window. We were able to see Rainforest Cafe clearly and watch the Aquacars drive by. We waved to a few passengers and they happily waved back.\\n\\nThe food was delicious for the most part. We had already decided on ordering the Charred Octopus (cannellini bean, chourico, smoked paprika oil ) as an appetizer since my boyfriend and I love it. Nothing wrong here. I had to get on his case as he attempted to put an entire tentacle in his mouth. Geez. We both agreed on sharing the seafood Tower which to me was just a raised platter. A tower would indicate that there's multiple levels to it. Also the menu said it served 4 but we both plowed very easily through the whole dish, not that we're huge eaters. The \\"tower\\" consisted of oysters, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, lump crab ceviche, and ahi tuna poke. He really liked the poke as it had a little bit of a rich kick to it, especially when eaten with the hot sauce that came with it. I liked it as well, but I really loved the crab legs. I couldn't tell you the last time I ate them so this was a real treat. Everything still had the briny taste from the sea except for the oysters. Those tasted as if they had been sitting in regular water too long. I was still hungry and opted to try the crab fries, french fries with lump blue crab and louie dressing. They were ok as an after meal snack but the ratio of crab with dressing to fries was unbalanced as I still had quite a bit left over. \\n\\nI sipped on Moscato by the glass while he tried the Not Everyone's Margarita. The title alone was a fair warning. The Mezcal was sitting waaaay on the bottom ready to attack as soon as a straw creeped in. I wish I could have taken photos of his face when he got to it. I tasted it and immediately felt drunk. He changed it up to a Sangria made with blackberries. I tried it and liked it as it was much lighter than a regular Sangria while he wanted something stronger. He drank it then wanted to try their \\"push-pop\\" alcoholic popsicles in mango flavor. I'll admit it was pretty good but at 15% volume in a little package it's quite a punch to the gut. \\n\\nService was good as our waiter was attentive and kept checking on us.

The first time they said it would be almost a 2 hour wait... That was way too long for us as we were already starving, so we decided we would come back the next morning right when they open. Next day, we arrived about 10 minutes or so before opening and there was already a line! By the time we reached the front, they said the wait would be 45 minutes. However, we got extremely lucky as we opted for the last outdoor seating! Yes!\\n\\nWe ordered the Duck Duck Steak and the Korean Fried Chicken. Both were amazing and definitely worth the try. The Duck Duck Steak was juicy and tender. The potatoes were amazing and the egg was on point! The Korean Fried Chicken was also delicious. Definitely had some heat to it, but the egg and the pickled cucumbers helped to balance it out.\\n\\nOur server, Jerry was very nice. However, service was a bit delayed, but not surprised since it the house was full. Also, they serve the plates as they come out, which they call family style. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes after the first one to get the second dish, which wasn't our preference since we were hungry, but it is what it is.\\n\\nOverall, Tasty n Alder lived up to the hype! I enjoyed our brunch and would love to return when I am back in Portland, but the wait slightly discourages me from doing so.

Our Uber driver, who is a born and raised Bostonian, told us if we can't get in to Neptune throw a rock and you'll have a great meal. It was packed with diners and a few people waiting at the door. After a few minutes of standing at the door, Kirk went up to a waitress, to get on the list. She had told him to wait at the door she would be over (Rule #3 - they see you at the door, they are not ignoring you - they WILL get to you). When she came over, I gave her my name and number, she said about an hour and I will call you. We left and walked around this charming part of Boston to see what other options we had for dining, which many had long lines. We decided to just wait our turn. I checked my phone many times to make sure I didn't miss the call, about 45 minutes later I looked down and had 2 missed calls (Rule #2- do not miss THE call). I called back immediately, as we walked back into the restaurant and was told, you were called twice before I moved on to the next person on the list. I apologized for missing the call (stupid new phone, not operator) and said we are here now and she said it would be about 15 minutes - which during that time I held my phone, watching it! \\n\\nWhen we were seated at the bar the magic began - Joe, served us and immediately took our drink order - we selected 2 French Rose's - which tasted like summer in a glass and paired perfectly to the oysters, crab claws and octopus cocktail. We chose a variety of local oysters from regions in Massachusetts and Martha's Vineyard. It was hard to say which oyster was my favorite, other than the one I was currently enjoying. I am not an oyster expert by any means, but to me a great oyster has to be SUPER fresh (freshness is obvious, but you can tell when they are NOT as fresh), skillfully shucked and with a fabulous addition of mignonette, lemon and hot sauce - and the local Sweet Reaper Hot Sauce, was the perfect touch of heat/vinegar/yumminess to enhance the oyster flavor. They hit it out of the park for all my oyster requirements. The Jonah crab claws from Maine were sweet, firm and paired deliciously with the mustard. The oyster cocktail was a delectable balance of octopus and citrus/vinegar flavors - the best way to describe it is a lemony-ceviche! \\n\\nWe also ordered clam chowder, Spanish Octopus, Scallops and the Monday night special - lobster spaghettini. The clam chowder had a delicate broth that was the perfect balance of stock and cream with big chunks of clam, potatoes and herbs. The Spanish octopus was extremely tender and cooked in a flavorful tomato-herb sauce. If it was not rude to lick a plate in public - I would have done it! My scallops were cooked perfectly - let me repeat PERFECTLY. They had the most amazing sear on BOTH sides of the very tender, sweet, plump scallop. I was stuffed at this point - but no scallop would be left behind! The lobster spaghettini was filled to the brim with chunks of lobster prepared in the most delicious tomato-garlic sauce - which I believe was adding to the wonderful aromas that filled the restaurant. He was going to finish every bite of that dish - even if I had to roll him out of there. \\nWhen you taste fresh superb-quality food - the way food is supposed to taste, it is hard to eat it any other way - Neptune Oyster is the epitome of this. \\n\\nFinally, Rule #1 - commit to waiting and eating here and be patient! The staff of 5 (Jes, Joe, Matt, one other really nice waitress and the Oyster-shucking Goddess - when you shuck oysters like that - you are a goddess!!!) in the front of the restaurant -  HUSTLE. They are very knowledgeable of the food, wine and sharing their love of all things seafood. They will make this an unforgettable dining experience, from the food, wine and conversation while never making you feel rushed. I will be back to Neptune Oyster, and will follow my 3 rules to enjoy another one-of-a-kind dining experience!"},{"name":"Taco Ranch","address":"517 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Super cheap tacos and the quality reflects that.

Twice I asked what the happy hour was. Both times he said \\"the happy hour WAS 4-7\\". (As if we had missed it.) Since it was 6:45 at the time, we wanted to order something from happy hour. So I tried elicitjng more information from him by saying \\"WHAT EXACTLY is being offered for happy hour\\". He acted annoyed and simply said, \\"That\\"...and pointed to one of the smaller menus. No other explanation. Just, \\"That\\". A little later I asked if they had any drink specials, since only a few drinks were listed on the menu. He said \\"No\\" and walked away. This happened twice. I was really looking forward to a unique cocktail from Bootleg.  In fact I later saw a listing about the \\"scorpion bowl\\". We would have ordered that as a group.

The picture of scallops in the lobby looked so inviting. But having stayed at the Embassy PDX for 3 nights already, it wasn't easy to ignore that Waters wasn't drawing a crowd. But I thought to myself that whenever we have dinner out at a Hilton, it's been good. Got married at one! \\n\\nSo I told my son I'd be downstairs investigating the Managers Reception. You know, just to make sure the choices of beer were ok. The day before, the Bud Light was flat. Couldn't figure out why they were pouring from a pitcher instead of out of the tap. Maybe they had to run it over from the other bar in the lobby. When I stayed there 10 years ago, that bar held the Managers. Anyway the IPA on tap was good. The munchies provided weren't so attractive, some veggies with dips, spicy pretzel mix and very fresh tortilla chips and salsa. But hey, it's free. \\n\\nSo sitting there for 45 mins, I did a in depth study of the IPA, I looked over at Waters and saw like 2 tables occupied. This is at 6:30 or so, prime time for dinner. I really felt like cruising through and checking out their plates. \\n\\nBut my son came down and I figured, let's just go, it's gotta be edible. We walked in from the Reception side and were immediately greeted and seated. Very nice staff. Our waiter came and we ordered calamari, a Prime, and the scallops. \\n\\nThe calamari came out pretty fast and was delicious. Even though it was served with a drizzle over the dish, it stayed crunchy. Then the mains came out. Nice. \\n\\nThe scallops were just a little under done but were seared perfectly. Love that texture. Then we split the prime which was really done well. Personally I like when they offer up some real mans horseradish, but their creamy stuff was ok. The roast itself was good. \\n\\nOverall I found Waters well worth the price. In fact they even had 10% off coupons all over the lobby. Another thing that raised my food radar. You don't usually see that in big hotels. \\n\\nI actually spoke with some of the staff after the meal and expressed that if not for the free grinds and booze 20 feet away, they should be packed. They said thanks but that's as much a ES policy as the free breakfast. Good enough. \\n\\nYou know I don't give out 5 stars all the time and this time it's because of the over the top sound of the waterfalls in the courtyard.

Then try the potatoes they called 'red bliss' when it's better named as 'direct from freezer' .

I will say that the chips were warm which is always great in my book but the salsa left a little to be desired. My biggest problem was my vegetarian burrito. The menu clearly states that I would be getting peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, beans and rice in my burrito which sounds like something I would love. But my friend and I watched my burrito sit in the heating window for 20 minutes and I had to ask for guacamole that wasn't brown and warm and the worst part was the broccoli and cauliflower the burrito!! There were humongous trees of brocc and cauli which made the burrito not so enjoyable. Had the menu stated that, I would have ordered the fajitas. Maybe they didn't have peppers and onions??

Mopac Expressway","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Taking a cue from Sophia Petrillo here...\\nPicture this: two friends in Provincetown, MA. It's the morning after a long night out,  and both are a little worse for wear after downing several magnums of champagne at a lesbian hotel, bar hopping since dinner, and ending the evening arguing with a rotund drag queen over whether or not it was appropriate to randomly charge them $5 for a photo with her. The only thing they could think of to fix the current situation was to have lobster rolls for breakfast. And they did have lobster rolls for breakfast. A LOT of them. Dear readers...one of those two friends was me. And the other one...was Adam Levine. \\n\\nYou probably don't believe the last part. But I assure you, all the rest was accurate.     \\n\\nSo--as someone who quite literally could eat lobster rolls for breakfast--the promise of a roving food cart in Austin offering up one of my favorite meals was a Siren song I was not about to pass up. \\n\\nThanks to their handy-dandy website, I discovered that they would be slinging the oh-so-coveted shellfish treat outside of the Echelon Building off MoPac. Lunch for Nathan was served. \\n\\nWhen I pulled up, I noticed the owner, Heidi, was manning the cart, and her smile and fabulous personality was evident right from the start. She seemed like the kind of person who would be fun to go out nightclubbing with...and then have her fix lobster rolls for everyone as a hangover cure (see above).\\n\\nI chose the $16 Maine-style Lobster Roll with chilled, fresh Maine lobster mixed with homemade mayo, celery, special seasoning over bibb lettuce and served on a Sweetish Hill toasted bun (A local food cart using a local bakery's bread--that's like, on the way to being so meta.) Keep in mind, there's always Connecticut-style roll with warm lobster brushed with lemon tarragon drawn butter and sprinkled with scallions. But really, I don't like to mess with the classics. Plus, I'm not too emotionally invested in drawn butter, or the state of Connecticut.  \\n\\nMy meal was rounded out with coleslaw and a Maine root soda. It's a simple menu, but awesome.  \\n\\nThe lobster roll was fantastic: Creamy, delicious, and the perfect light, springtime lunch, especially for people as far away from the New England coast as we are. Huge, decadent chunks of lobster claw paired nicely with the toasted bun, and I was literally planning my return to the cart about halfway through scarfing it down. The strong Maine root soda washed it down nicely. They even perfected the side of coleslaw, which is usually a part of the meal I don't comment on. So, amazing, all around.  \\n\\nHeidi and I talked for a bit while her brother (also super nice) prepared the lunch. She explained she had lived in Key West for a time (which explained the seasonal frozen key lime pie dessert), and also how much she enjoyed New England. She asked what I did for a living, and I told her that specifically, I work at a luxury department store at the Domain selling handbags; but generally, I run around town eating and drinking my way through the city of Austin with my friends, and then writing reviews about everything. She asked that if I enjoyed my meal, to please make sure to write her a glowing review. Fair enough.\\n\\nAnd since I absolutely love Garbo's and the owner...I hope this review makes them proud. It's well deserved. \\n\\n5 Stars for Garbo's Lobster Truck!"},{"name":"Cielo Bistro Mexico","address":"7032 Wood Hollow Dr, Ste 101","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"A few bright spots, but a long road ahead in this tough restaurant market.\\n\\nFirst of all, I would like to start with a positive comment for our server, Max. Admittedly, the menu and standards are new to him in the past few weeks. He had a great attitude and really seemed to enjoy being there. The overall delivery will surely smooth out over time. One critique? Don't just drop a carafe of water and glasses on the table. While introducing yourself, go ahead and pour a glass for the guests. \\n\\nThe room was a bit cold for me. Minus the really stunning chandelier, the cement floors, putty colored walls and plasti-wood tables really did not seem warm or inviting (nor do white mini-blinds). Some artwork that pops or a nice table cloth in orange or red would change the dynamic significantly. As of now, if feels a bit like a cafeteria. \\n\\nThe first food related comment is for the chips & salsa. My dining companion and I debated whether either were made fresh in house. He believes at least the salsa was; I think both come from an outside source. While admittedly fresh tasting, the salsa was devoid of any spice. On a scale of 1 to 5 peppers, maybe a 1 at the most. Something - onion, jalapeno, cilantro, garlic, salt - would be a nice addition to the tomato puree.  \\n \\nThe cheese enchiladas with guajillo sauce were nice. Certainly a good sized portion with plenty of melted cheese. The sauce when tried on its own was somewhat rich and smoky. However, paired with the cheese enchiladas, it was a bit lost. As well, no spice here either. Some pico or jalapeno slices on top would have been nice (or even fresh avocado slices?) ($14)\\n\\nThe rice was prepared adequately, but with basmati as the rice option. Not my preference as I don't associate basmati with interior Mexico, but will allow the chef a bit of indulgence here. Not to sound like a broken record, yet the black beans had no spice or discernible seasoning.\\n\\nMy colleague had the short rib and really enjoyed the tenderness and flavor of the meat. The potatoes were crispy and plentiful. This was the standout dish of the night. The one nitpick? It was plated on a very small plate, maybe one that would be used for a salad or side dishes. Seemed very crowded and made the act of cutting the meat a bit of a functional challenge. ($26)\\n\\nThere are a few nice options for specialty cocktails. The margarita was perfectly acceptable. There are beers and a few wines available as well.\\n\\nOur wait time from order to service was only about 20 minutes, so great job on that end. That said, we had nothing that would have been cooked to order; those ribs had been deliciously braising for hours.\\n\\nWill I rush back? Probably not. However, would not decline if invited. There is some good potential in terms of food and service. Hopefully Cielo will decide what it is aiming for and make it work for them. 3 stars for the overall experience. The server receives a 4th."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Very disappointed!

There were quite a bit of clams in it and they weren't too chewy, but I thought that it lacked flavor overall.\\n\\nFor my meal, I decided to go with the monkfish. The monkfish was slightly overcooked, but the meat was still flaky and went well, especially when paired with the lentils. The lentils may have been some of the best I've ever had--a great pairing with the beef tongue.\\n\\nOverall, this place served up some quality dishes, but I can't say I was overly impressed, with exception to the lentils.

This dark, upscale restaurant offers an eclectic cuisine served by friendly and helpful staff. We came here for dinner on Christmas night. It was really packed. Probably because so many places were closed for the holiday. They did take us on time, as we had 7:15pm reservations. We asked for a window seat and we did manage to get one. Definitely try for this. The menu is not huge. It's somewhat limited in my opinion. We shared several starters and an entree: The Peking duck and steamed buns, mac & cheese, beef short ribs and the spicy crab and yellowtail sushi. Everyone agreed that everything was really delicious. Portions were generous but not overwhelming. My only complaint would be the amount of time it took for our food to be served. It probably took about 45 min from the time we ordered to the time we actually got our food. I realize it was a busy night, but come on; this place must be used to being busy and I could not believe that it took so long.

One time can be forgiven, but perhaps I'm sadistic by letting myself return and setting myself up another disappointment.\\n\\nThe meals at our table were completely wrong one meal. The correct order followed a good half hour later, and the manager came to us and apologized, saying that our meals \\"would be taken care of\\". We did what any sane human would do; graciously accept the offer and promptly ask for the drink and dessert menus, and commence the good times. When the bill arrived, the total was even higher than the original amount because the Wednesday burger and beer special was not discounted. \\nLong story short, our waitress told us we were wrong and finally agreed to mend the bill. When it all added up, a one dollar discount was applied to each person's meal. I mentioned the issue and she re-affirmed that it had been fixed, and asked if I wanted her to fix it again.

I sadly opted for the Wednesday burger and beer special, which was common to most people our table of 6. When the bill arrived, the specials weren't applied to everyone's order. A manager stated that the deal only applied to the basic and veggie burgers, and that it said so on the menu. I asked for proof, and he proved himself incorrect. How could he possibly argue something written on the menu? Again I heard those magic words: \\"Sorry, I'll take care of the drinks\\", but the revised bills were returned with the originally expected $14 charge. Nothing really \\"taken care of\\".\\nHe also insolently said \\"It's only the basic burger that applies. Just so you know for next time\\". \\n\\nJust so you know. There won't be a next time. \\nYou sir, are a true Charlatan.

We went the house recipe which tasted like teriyaki sauce (yummy by the way).\\n\\nWe started with the \\"Sunomono Assortment\\" which is a vinegar-ish salad with cucumbers, imitation crabmeat, squid, & seaweed. I enjoyed this one, and would order it again. Price $7.80.\\n\\nNext we got the \\"Yakitori 15-pc. Combo\\" which included 5 skewers of Negima (chicken with green onions & Japanese jalapenos), 5 skewers of just chicken, 3 skewers of chicken wings, and 2 skewers of chicken meatballs. I loved them all but thought the $35 price was a little steep. Chicken was very tender, loved the charcoal grilled taste, and well, we were still hungry and decided to order more. \\n\\nSo next we tried the \\"Shiitake Mushroom Stuffed with Meatballs\\" (2 skewers) for $7. Very tasty, and mushrooms were nice & juicy.\\n\\nAlso ordered the \\"Jinbei Pork Roll Combo\\" which included 1 skewer of asparagus rolled in sliced pork, 1 skewer of green onion rolled in sliced pork, 1 skewer of Shiso rolled in sliced pork, and 1 skewer of Japanese jalapenos rolled in sliced pork.

The staff was very nice about refunding the cost of the pancakes. \\n\\nThe shrimp and grits lived up to my expectations. It really was good! The portion was generous and quality was excellent. Hub was very happy with his chicken and biscuit, his standards are fairly low. He was happy it was better than Chick Filet. \\n\\nThis was a really fun spot to show off Portland to our friend.

The name, the decor, the outside facade, everything about it says it must be a lamp shop or something.  Anything but glorious pizza and ice cream.  Inside the orange and off white decor gives no indication of the amazing wood fired oven in back.  However, when the menu arrives, watch out, because you are about to be shocked.\\n\\nMy friends took me here for an amazing dinner.  I haven't explored the Mississippi area too much in North Portland.  So many great places to try.  We settled on Lovely's and thankfully so.  We started with a polenta and ratatouille mix.  Not well seasoned, but still fresh and the eggplant mixed with creamy polenta was a great start.  Next came our three pizza pies.  Holy moly.  We had a Margarita, one with ricotta and greens(bacon on half for my meatatarian friend), and another with fresh chewy chantrelles.  All three were amazing.  The crust has a perfect chewiness with just the right amount of char.  As often happens with wood fired pizza, you can get a pie that is way too thin and the cheese and gourmet toppings just slide off.  Not here, they have thought that one through and everything stays right there and makes each bite sizzle.  You'll pay $18-20 for a pizza, but you get your money's worth in my opinion.\\n\\nNow I wish I could make this review just about pizza, but Lovely's makes a great selection of homemade ice creams as well.  You'd never know it of course. I would come here just for the ice cream alone.  We tried four kinds on offer.  Cantaloupe, fig pistachio, anise straciatella, and the highlight was a plum and rose sorbet.  There jut aren't words to describe the perfect texture and taste.  It's as good as gelato in Italy, I highly recommend not leaving without at least one scoop!!!!  \\n\\nService is great, very friendly and always there to see if you need anything or any questions answered.  Very clean restaurant, and everything is one big efficiently run place that you'll find very satisfying.  Negatives?  It can get busy and loud in a hurry.  The old building doesn't lend itself to a nice quiet date, and you had better get there close to opening at 5pm, because there will be a line and tables fill up quickly.  However, these do not distract from the overall atmosphere and quality of Lovely's.  I'm keeping it at five stars based on my experience.

You go inside and it has a home feeling, i felt like i was in someone's living room but cute. Once you go in the main dining area it's actually very cute, dim lighting, low chairs (they had the option to sit on the floor with no shoes for the full \\"Moroccan experience\\" but in our whole trip we never witnessed that) very Moroccan vibe decor (that did seem legit). \\n\\nThey also had someone come with towels and a bowl with a pot for us to wash our hands at the table, also a tradition that we never saw in Morocco but maybe it was from somewhere else. They did have Berber Whisky, which is mint green tea, and we ordered 2 rounds because YAASSSS it's so good. When we saw the menu we instantly searched for Tagine plates, or skewers, or their delicious salads but sadly did not see it, most of the plates we saw we didn't recognize at all. \\n\\nWhen we were in Morocco our tour guide took us to eat at many different places and they all had similar DELICIOUS plates: they started with Berber Whisky, of course, a salad of sorts with great seasoning, bread, tagine, and fruit as a desert.

BUT the server was kind enough to make the exception. It took a long while for our food to arrive and honestly... we were not a fan, nothing (in the food department) resembled Morocco at all... it sucks because i had high hopes, i was really hoping to find a Moroccan place here in my town versus having to book a flight to eat that amazing food again lol. \\n\\nAside from the food the place is very beautiful inside, they had a belly dancer who was very talented and super entertaining, and the servers/service was amazing!! Super friendly and very attentive. \\n\\nThe ambiance, the service, the decor, the entertainment was all A++ but the food that was most important for me was a fail, so sad. BUT!

Wish they did a tomato broth or something. Aw well.\\n- I was not impressed by the Uni toast -- perhaps because it's not uni season in July, but there was barely a trace of uni flavors in the toast. Don't get me wrong, I love my buttered and salted toast... I just struggled to finish this one because it was just so darn salty... \\n- I wouldn't recommend the cocktail shrimp.

Needless to say, I will never return."},{"name":"ThoroughBread","address":"1709 Bluebonnet Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"I am really picky about my baked goods. As in, most places are not good enough. If it's not that great, I am just not into it. And wow.. totally hooked now on ThoroughBread! The best chocolate chip pecan cookie ever. Just sweet enough but not too sweet, and just delicious. Big enough so that 1 cookie feeds 2 people comfortably. Also, the best bread ever. Have to say the white sourdough is better than the whole wheat one though, in my opinion. Normally I like wheat better, but the whole wheat is more dense. The white sourdough is just more airy and delicious. Hope this place has great success, which I am sure they will."},{"name":"Thai Pasta Cuisine","address":"11461 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"While the name doesn't seem to shout authenticity their food is fantastic! The best calamari in the city- it's so tender. Masuman and yellow curries have been fantastic."},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We came here a while back for our anniversary. Its on the grand Floridian property and overlooks magic kingdom. We made sure we made reservations during this fireworks. We came a couple minutes before our reservation and were sat within 5 minutes. The service was great and our server went above and beyond for us. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came our perfectly. Very nice seasoning and I can honestly say this is the best steak I've had at Disney and I've been to a lot of places. My wife ordered the shrimp pasta and she loved it. The best park was the fireworks. They play the music to the fireworks in the restaurant and it was magical. The gentleman next to us proposed during the fireworks and it was very exciting. Dinner was fantastic and we will definitely be back. It is pretty expensive so we'll only do this place every once in a while. But for a nice occasion I'd highly recommend this place. It's our favorite restaurant in Disney."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],L={key:0},F={key:1};function D(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(y,null,w(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",F,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",L,"See more"))],8,j)):m("",!0)])}const H=u(E,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-32127638"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/19.md","filePath":"quotesmag/19.md"}'),G={name:"quotesmag/19.md"},V=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(H)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
