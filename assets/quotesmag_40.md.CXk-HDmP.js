This was at the Suburban Lanes near Decatur.  Fast forward to 2016.  The same bowling alley was being refurbished/re-purposed as the Comet.  Their opening got delayed, but I had intended to ask the 2 remaining local guys who were in the team to see if they wanted to check it out.  Sadly, one of them died in the fall before we could stop in.  Later, this past February, the other guy + some mutual high school friends (one visiting from Europe now) wanted to meet up.  So we ended up at the Comet.\\n\\nI wanted to like this place.  We stopped in on a Saturday around 6:30 p.m.  There was 'up to a 90-minute wait' for lanes!  Wow.  We got on the list and hung out eating dinner.  The food was pretty standard pub-fare, though it appeared they had a semi-extensive beer selection.  Thankfully, a lane opened up and we were able to bowl.\\n\\nMaybe it was just our lane but there seemed to be frequent issues with the ball getting stuck.  Also, you do not bowl by the game but by time (that is also how you are charged, apparently).  So waiting on ball-returns was costing money...  They did credit us some time back, but I'd rather just be allowed to bowl a complete game on my own schedule.\\n\\nAt the end of the evening, the total for our food and bowling (for 4) came to ~ $150!  I was unpleasantly surprised at the total.  I'm certain that I could visit a bar and a bowling alley separately for much less than that.\\n\\nThe only other knock was that the place seemed to really have an over-representation of hipsters.  It got to be sort of a running joke.\\n\\nI would be very unlikely to return here for bowling, and the food isn't a draw on its own.

We dined at Basta's on a Saturday night for husband's birthday.  We had a marvelous meal and fantastic wine.  We started with the calamari friti and fennel salad. Both were ample starters and delicious.  The birthday boy had the rack of lamb, which was prepared to his liking and was full of flavor, he enjoyed it immensely!  I ordered the gnocchi with mushroom and pork, it was incredible with enough for lunch the following day.  I'll give their wine list a B+ to A (very high score) for price range, regional variation and multiple varietals (there's something for everyone here).   \\n\\n***Our one complaint with this meal was the timing of the dishes.  Our main came immediately after our starters and being a special occasion we really wanted to pace ourselves.  We felt as though they were needing next seating.  We were in and out in 1 hour, which we NEVER do on a weekend (even at home).  So, upon returning we will order starters and \\"ponder\\" our mains until we are truly ready and have had time to enjoy our wine.  Had they not rushed us, we would have ordered another bottle of wine and dessert.  We took our half bottle home to enjoy in our own time/space.  Recommend this place, but do make reservations and may need to specify if you want a Private table vs communal table.

A friend ordered the special ahi poke which she raved about and other friends ordered the fried chicken to split which they said was really good.

Tonight has to be by far the worst customer service experience I've ever received. I waited in the the drive thru for 25 mins. (10 mins of waiting before I got to the window and 10 mins of waiting at the window) While waiting for my food at the window the cashier notified me that I had to wait an additional 15 mins because they didn't have any chicken ready. I told her that, that was ridiculous, she never gave me an option for anything else, I had to ask her if she had any other parts of the chicken that were done, she stated that she had chicken tenders ready. I told her I would take that, at this point I was just ready to go. Once she came back to the window, she told me that the chicken was done and handed me a bag with my order in it. I asked to speak with the manager on duty. Once the manager on duty by the name of Patrick came to the window, I begin to voice my frustrations, I could tell he didn't want to hear what I had to say because his demeanor showed it. Patrick even fixed his mouth to say that I was slowing up the flow of the drive thru because we were having a conversation about my complaint, he's didn't care about my complaint, he even told me that he's not the one who cooks the food, when I asked him why was the wait so long and why they didn't have any chicken. He told me that he's the manager and it's his job to drive the team. I explained to him that this isn't the first time that I've had to wait for a long period of time at this location. He continued to look frustrated with me, never trying to come up with a solution. He told me that I was being combative. Once I saw we weren't getting anywhere after a 5 min conversation, I decided it was just best to leave. Once I arrived home to feed my family, we opened the bag only to find raw chicken in both of my children's kids meals, both my husband and I had dried out pork sandwiches, and all of our fries were hard and over cooked. I proceeded to turn my oven on to up cooked my children's chicken, because I was just over Pollo Tropical at this point. But I was so upset with everything that took place tonight, that I decided to get me whole family together to go back and return everything. Once we returned to Pollo and asked for Patrick, to explain what was wrong with our food, he made us wait for about another 10 mins before he came to see what the issues was. He barely looked at the food, not even acknowledging that they served raw chicken in 2 kids meals. He offered to remake everything and give me a refund, I told him that we didn't want a remake, we only wanted a refund. I will never return to this location. I'm totally disappointed with the service I received at this Tucker location. I really hope to hear from upper management very soon.

Not my wheelhouse. Except it is. I probably eat more black bean tacos per week than any human should. Here we've got grilled queso fresco, black beans, avocado lettuce and tomato. I liked it on wheat. The queso fresco brought a cool kind of texture and acid, the avocado is creamy and the black beans hold the show together. I'd sub the lettuce/tomato for pico next time. Pair with Dona.\\n\\nThe Vaquero: Breakfast taco. Eggs, roasted peppers and corn, jack cheese. My grievance with their breakfast tacos is not unique: I wish there was more. The serving could've been 25 percent larger and fit just fine. That said, I inhaled this ala Kirby. I haven't turned into a flour tortilla yet, but I also haven't checked a mirror all day... (Also, pair with Rojo)\\n\\nChicken Mole: Some days you get lucky. This corn tortilla (maybe their best variety) was stuffed with big chunks of straight-up authentic chicken mole, with some cilantro and cotija to round things out. I took one bite, then saved this for last, cause I knew I'd be replaying this awesomeness all day. No salsas need apply. Don't dilute the flavor on this beast taco. \\n\\nIt might be worth noting that I'm a mole nut, and can't really say I've ever had a bad version. But still, an everyday mole taco is rare.

The food is outstanding.  I had their Goat Boy:  portabella mushroom, egg, sweet onion, sun dried tomato, spinach and goat cheese.

Granny's Tacos really does it well as you can tell she puts a lot of love into her food.  \\n\\nThere's so many great things about this place, let me lay it out; \\n\\n1.  The Breakfast Tacos ROCK!  My favorite ones are the Veggie Taco (with egg) and the Spinach + Egg + Cheese.  I always get them on corn, the tacos are always large with plenty of egg and toppings, it's just really good and doesn't bog you down.  \\n\\n2.  The Chicken Mole Taco is AWESOME!  I love love this taco and get it on every visit, always on corn, it keeps well overnight, and lots of chicken and the mole is very flavorful.  It's definitely one of my faves.  \\n\\n3.  Her salsa selection ROCKS!  She's got 4 of them and they're all so very tasty and carry some heat.  The green rivals the Dona, her red salsa is more robust and carries extra heat - - I love the flavor.  She has a pot of fresh salsa you scoop out with a ladle - - omg it's really flavorful.  The bright orange is their habanero - - for which her husband created and she perfected.  It's really hot but packs a lot of flavor.  \\n\\n4.  I love her homemade corn tortillas!  I'd describe it as a thicker yellow corn, very robust, not the thin and flimsy corn tortillas I'm used to, and it's really flavorful.  She does a superb job in putting the tacos together and packaging them. \\n\\n5.  Great bang for the buck - - I think you get a great quality product here, with her tacos being larger than some places, for a great price.  You can't ask for more.  Some taco places leave you asking for more, but her tacos are filling and quality good.  I usually buy a few and store a couple in the fridge for the next morning - - they all keep very well.  \\n\\nI can eat her awesome food and never feel bogged down afterwards, and that's how I know she uses quality ingredients.  The service here has always been very friendly and courteous.  This lovely husband and wife couple are always really nice as we love to talk and catch up on the latest, and I always remind the hubby how lucky he is to have someone who is such a great cook and makes exceptional food.  He definitely knows and appreciates it."},{"name":"Arepazo Tapas & Wine","address":"93 N High St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife has been here several times and always mentioned how great it was.

Their fries are really good and are oddly light and crispy. I think maybe they baked the fries first, before they were fried to order.  Nothing was greasy. I wasn't impressed with the calamari, batter needs to be lighter. Their house sauce, boom boom sauce I think it was called, was a perfect 10!  Taking order speed was very slow; they need a way to take orders faster and without timely errors. Hopefully, this was just an off day in that area, but really, the calamari and the speed issues were my only two minuses.

The best part... our main dish. We had the specials... a surf and turf and a veal with risotto. The food was UNREAL. Hands down, no comparison to any other Italian restaurant we have been to. This is definitely our new favorite restaurant! Our bill was on the high end for two people... but we were expecting that... with appetizer, two glasses of wine, and two of the most expensive meals on the menu... I would pay that again in a heartbeat. We could have very easily eaten there for half the cost we did though; the range in menu items is wonderful, but the menu size is perfect.  Oh ya, and can't forget about the tiramisu ..

I joined 12 of my family and friends for dinner this past weekend and it seemed that service issues went from bad to worse beginning with the moment we were seated.  As a result of two servers processing our food orders, half of the table was served and the other half waited for their food to arrive. One of the servers that was flagged down so that we could check the status was hostile and very condescending. No explanation was provided, and she seemed annoyed that we had bothered her about this issue. The second server arrived approximately 10 mins. later with the rest of the food order, however two of the orders had to be sent back, and another - well-done steak order request - also had to be sent back because it was bleeding inside. Feeling extremely sympathetic for my dinner party, I placed an order for two bottles of liquor - Ciroc and Hennessy. The server with the infamous attitude returned shortly after informing me that my card was declined, so I sent the Hennessy back and asked the server to try again. When the server returned with my bill, I saw that she charged me over 18% gratuity (almost $100) for one bottle of Ciroc, for which I was charged $350! This server deserved ZERO dollars for gratuity; her attitude towards our entire party was absolutely horrible!! She was clearly aware that due to the size of our party, gratuities would automatically be added to our bill. After several attempts, this issue was finally directed to an actual Manager at the Buckhead location. At this time, I was informed that 18% gratuity (the maximum) was applied to my credit card in addition to 8.9% tax (18% gratuity was also applied to the entire bill without any authorization, approval or consent or from myself or the other dinner guests).  This was a completely different explanation from the others I had received from the restaurant staff that I had spoken to in the days prior.  Clearly this Manager had been advised and prepared for my inquiry, however even with his creative explanation, the total amount STILL did not match the amount that I was charged.  My advice to future patrons of the Sage Woodfire Tavern in Buckhead: be sure to verify pricing (including tax and gratuities) of wine, champagne and especially liquor bottle purchases BEFORE placing an order.  Doing so will save many hours of argumentative, hostile and unreceptive conversations with staff & managers who seem to lack integrity, and obviously have no conscience about using deceitful, unethical and underhanded tactics to fleece its customers.  Lastly, future patrons should definitely lower any expectations of satisfactory service and eating experience. This ain't that.

I'm no adonis either. This place is the proverbial meat market - if going here doesn't get you laid, then nothing will.\\n\\nFood: The menu is predominately comprised of casual American bar fare, including appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and wraps. I'm an ardent fan of their nachos, which are sizably portioned and loaded with enough cheese to give you resident status in WIsconsin. I've also had several of their sandwiches, which are edible, but not particularly memorable. The restaurant is part of the Metrotainment Cafe group - as such, they sell Metrotainment Bakery desserts, most of which are quite good. \\n\\nService: The servers are not necessarily the epitome of speed and efficiency, but they're usually friendly. The staff turnover is fairly high, so you'll rarely see the same face during successive visits. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The only real enticing aspect of this place is the outdoor patio - the interior is dark, dilapidated, and reeks of something ungodly. Smoking is allowed at all times, so I can rarely tolerate sitting inside. The clientele is mostly gay males and the general vibe changes with the day and time. However, regardless of the day, the people watching opportunities are simply unparalleled. \\n\\nCost: Inexpensive. Appetizers are $5-$9, soups are $3.50/cup and $4.50/bowl, salads are $8-$12, wraps are $7-$9, sandwiches and burgers are $7-$10, wings are $9.50 (10) and $17.95 (20), and entrees are $7-$20. All major credit cards are accepted.  \\n\\nOther: Joe's on Juniper features various events throughout the week, including Movie Night on Monday's, \\"Crazy Bitch Bingo\\" on Wednesdays (8PM), Trivia on Thursdays (8PM), Theme Night on Fridays, \\"Blunch\\" on Saturday and Sundays (11AM-3PM), and 1/2-priced desserts on Sundays. Parking isn't easy, but I typically have luck on Juniper or the surrounding side streets. Otherwise, your only other option is to pay for valet ($5) or the lot across the street. Per Georgia state law - since smoking is allowed, children are not permitted at any time."},{"name":"Story Book Dining at Artist Point with Snow White","address":"901 Timberline Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Compared to other times that we've eaten at this restaurant, this experience was disappointing. We started with the mussels appetizer. There were plenty of mussels but the liquid in which the mussels were served added little flavor and the mussels were overcooked. The entrees weren't any better. My son and I each ordered the cedar plank salmon. The salmon was $41 but a smaller piece than at other restaurants for that price point. It was good but overpriced. My wife had a salad because she didn't like most of the entree options. However, I think we were most disappointed with the duck tubers that we ordered as a side dish. We've had potatoes fried in duck confit elsewhere and they were decadent and wonderful. These fell far short of that standard. The tubers included potatoes, sweet potatoes, and sun chokes that had been roasted then coated with duck fat. None of them were even peeled. This was quite disappointing as I expect more from a so-called \\"Signature\\" restaurant at Walt Disney World. Dessert was OK but not particularly memorable. The service was fine but the ambiance was ruined by several crying babies. I realize that this isn't Disney's fault but I was surprised to see at least 5-6 children in booster seats or high chairs in a \\"Signature restaurant."},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm sold, and I only came in for a cup of coffee.  As someone who thrives on surprises, I didn't read any reviews before coming here - I just knew I had to come to a coffee house named after one of the Russian Five. Hell, I even had a cat named Rimsky.\\n\\nWalking in the door was quite confusing for me. I expected a bar, maybe some post-romantic expressionist music, or maybe event some Mozart Quartets to create some ambience.\\n\\nOpening the door, I encountered a staircase, a couple rooms with tables, an awesome classical guitarist. So after walking up and down the stairs in search of the bar, I sat myself down and waited a few minutes; enjoying this hybrid of Viennese Coffee House (slow, kurt table service) with the \\"weird\\" Portland artsyness (in an old house, local/handmade decor).  With the exception of the server, everyone here is just happy.  \\n\\nI only had coffee (which was terrible and could only be taken with cream and sugar) took quite a few minutes; something normal in Austria, but undesireable in the States. At first I was bemused by the service, but after enough time waiting for a refill, and 10 minutes to get my check for ... one coffee ... I grew disappointed with the scatterbrained and aloof server, though a cute drawing was included with the bill.  Also, please ALWAYS assume that customers need change; I felt like the server took extra time to see if I would leave without getting change.  Instead, I nearly left without paying the bill.  The difference between a couple bucks is good, honest service. I'm so tempted to leave no TIP, but that's against my principles.\\n\\nMenu is handmade, hard to read, but still rad. No one really listens to the classical guitarist. Watching the server, I see the desserts look awesome.\\n\\nWhen I flipped the light on in the bathroom, the \\"decoration\\" scared the shit out of me... loved it!\\n\\nThis place is all about mood; be prepared to spent a LOT of time here.

Hampton Bay and other chains alike have microwaves and refrigerators and their rooms with two ply toilet paper. The toilet paper in this alleged five star hotel is super thin as if I was in Home Depot. The maids do not do a very good job. See my photos. Hair stuck on bathroom ceiling, just about every surface has dust. Dust on the wall, REALLY couldn't believe that. Mildew in shower area. Almost all of the room outlets are loose. Your device plug falls out. I just can't believe that they consider themselves as a 5 star resort. Unbelievable. You should \\"NEVER\\" find dust in a 5 star resort or mildew in the shower or 1 ply toilet paper. 1 ply toilet paper c'mon really. Kinda sad. If it is 2 ply its super thin. One of the reading lamps attached to the headboards was broken, floor lamp missing the light diffuser, and there's no ventilation in the bathroom at all. Our beds were pretty comfortable a little softer than we prefer but no bed in any hotel will be just like your bed at home. For the cost of this room and the amenities the hotel offers the rooms do not keep up with the rest of the hotel. Yes there's a TV in the mirror. I'm not impressed it's a cool feature but money could have been spent on other things. We reserved our room for 3 people. The room was prepaired for 2 people. 2 towels, washclothes and 2 bottles of water. If you are going to have complimentary items they should accommodate all guests checking into room. Do it right or don't do it at all. The grotto pool is great, has a little slide and cool lighting at night. Plenty of dining and 24 hour snack options. Parking is $25 a day. Why? There is a $25.00 a day resort fee. Why? Room is already an overpriced at $259.00 a night. And you would think for having a separate parking garage it would be attached at some level to walk across a catwalk or airbridge to the hotel. Especially if it's raining there's no real covered walkway. The staff was impeccable in my opinion. Each one I encountered had the information I requested and was pleased to share it. Staff is . I do not think I would stay here again unless it's on someone else's dime. I have stayed at many hotels in my time and have had better rooms at 3 hotels.

But when I stay in a hotel I evaluate mostly on the basics and this place didn't do well. There was no cold water in the bathroom sink. Yeah, that's pretty weird, right? *Both* faucets ran hot water. Not a total buzz-kill but particularly in hot Orlando one may want to run some cold water to wash hands or use after shaving. Then there is the desk and chair height. I can't get up high enough on the adjustable chair to work comfortably on my laptop (which I'm doing now). What the heck is that? Do they test their design choices? Next, not enough outlets and no USB ports that I could find. Not very business friendly, or even consumer friendly for that matter these days. There is no place to hang a hand towel. (!?) On the plus side, there are terry-cloth robes, but on the frowny side there are no cheap slippers for walking down to the pool. Pack your own flip-flops, I guess. On the major plus side, the bed and pillows are good. However, I found it difficult to get temperature-comfortable at night. The fan seems to blow constantly and sort of keep you cold, but eventually the sheets heat you up to a near-sweat. I had an injured back when I arrived and that contributed, I'm sure, to my challenged sleep. The curtains do a good job of blackout and there was no noise issue even though I was close to the elevator. I interacted so little with staff that I can't really comment, though check-in was efficient and pleasant. I think the hotel is close to major Orlando tourist attractions but be advised of the second largest convention center in the USA, of which the Hyatt is a part.

Like some of the other reviews have indicated, the food itself was pretty good, but other aspects were disappointing.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated right away, and the waiter then presented us with menus and offered his take on the best dishes to order.  I appreciated that he didn't pick the most expensive things on the menu, as sometimes happens in such situations.  However, he then disappeared for a long time; after we figured out what to order, we were sitting there for five minutes with no service in sight (and the restaurant was only half-full, so it can't be chalked up to a busy night).  We also noticed that several other tables received bread and butter right away, but none materialized for us.  We eventually ordered the seared ahi tuna as an appetizer, the strawberry salad, and the pasta with prawns, tomatoes and snap peas.  The tun was good and came with a cabbage slaw in peanut sauce, though there was a lot of salt on the fish, which masked its flavor.  The salad was refreshing and tasty with nice, sweet strawberries complemented by creamy goat cheese.  The pasta was also very good, with well seasoned prawns and a tasty sauce.  However, both the salad and the pasta portions were small for their prices -- perhaps not surprising for a restaurant located in a hotel, but still unfortunate.  Once we finished eating, a different waiter cleared our plates and asked if we were interested in dessert.  Having plenty of room left from the small dinner portions, we indicated that we were, but then no one came with a dessert menu for another 5-10 minutes.  Nothing stood out from looking over the menu, and the prices were again quite high ($9-12 for each dessert), so we skipped dessert.  Instead, we received the check, which charged $3 more than the listed menu price for a glass of wine my girlfriend had ordered.  We pointed out the error and it was corrected, so we paid and departed.  Overall, I'd say that Swank has good food, but notably poor attention to detail.

I have spent $26 for much better all you can eat buffets in NYC, but since is the only all you can eat hot pot in Boston, can't complain too much. The meat and produce are reasonably fresh, the place offers a good (but not great) number of options, and the broths can be bland. I am frustrated, though, about the amount of food they give you. Granted, this is all you can eat, but every time we fill in one of those slips of paper for more Fuzhou fish balls or taro slices, we literally get 2-3 pieces of each. Sure, this limits potential waste, but it also makes the place look stingy. Not bad, but will only come here if I'm desperate for all you can eat hot pot in Boston."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"So, here's the thing about Tin Shed ... the food is yum, the vibe is Portland, and the side room is dog friendly.\\n\\nThe bar is small and the draft beer & wine selection smaller, but we still found a couple drinks to enjoy.

Don't expect anything fancy cause Tin Shed is comfy.\\n\\nWe started with a Mini Mac-o-the-Day ($9) for some cheesy pasta and a bowl of Roasted Brussel Sprouts made modern thanks to Bacon. Another cool discovery was the Creamy Polenta for some creamy carbs. A \\"must order\\" we tried was the Buttermilk Biscuit Board ($6.50) with a pair of thick 'n heavy Portland-style Biscuits that were filling though not flaky.

Most of the ramen places in Austin focus on the broth but usually overly salt or put in more fat to thicken the broth. This place uses subtly and finesse to get the flavor profiles of each soup right. We got the spicy ramen and the signature ramen and each bowl was unique in flavor and texture of noodle. The signature is the typical ramen egg noodle with a smokey sweet flavor that didn't cost your mouth with a layer of fat. I know a lot of places don't skim the fat off their broth for more mouth feel but I'm not looking for a heart attack in a bowl. The owners wife said they purposely skim the fat off the soup to focus on the flavor and they wanted to make a healthier soup for their daughter to eat. I prefer my daughter eating that soup too. :) The spicy ramen tasted like my two favorite things: ramen and queso. I thought it sounded weird to put cheese in the soup but it works. It's so delicious and had more of a Korean feel with the texture of the curly ramen noodle. I really liked how they put a lot of meat and toppings so every bite is new and exciting without you having to order extras like corn and garlic.  I would come here more than once a week if I could afford it."},{"name":"Kneaded Pleasures Cafe & Pizza","address":"3573 Far W Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Place is amaizing, best pizzas and sandwiches I tried so far.

He asked for another set, or even for them to warm those up. At that time, I ordered another set of Jack Daniels since those were gone in three minutes. Waited 45 minutes for them to bring out my brother's next set. Another 15 before I just cancelled my next set - even though they were 'on the way'  An hour in between servings of an 'unlimited' wing order is ridiculous.

I've been so excited for this place to open since it is so close to me, but unfortunatly, I was not wowed. I think over time they will start to work the kinks out, but a few things that bothered me:\\n\\nNo one's seemed to mention this yet, but the menu is expensive. I think too expensive for what it is. Entrees are in the mid-high $20 range. The problem is that the quality doesn't seem to stand up to those prices. \\n\\nWhile we're on the subject of prices, the oysters were $2.50 each, which is pretty standard for some high end places in Boston. This is not a high-end restaurant. The quality was more less the same that I usually get when I go for $1 oyster happy hours. They were alright. At least they were freshly shucked. Maybe they can start happy hour deals themselves?\\n\\nAnother issue is that they are way too rigid about substitutions. If someone doesn't want to go overboard with calories when they're ordering a burger or sandwich, don't expect to be able to sub those fries for some veggies or a side salad. They don't allow substitutions. Period. I think this is total BS.\\n\\nNow that I got that out of the way, I will definitely be back, but not for dinner. The main dining area seems stuffy and uncomfortable. This is a great place to sit at the bar, have a few drinks and watch the game. They've got huge TVs all over the bar area and really friendly bartenders. The place was packed on a Wednesday night, which is great.

I have been to some amazing Sushi Bars/restaurants in my travels around the world and have had some wonderful experiences, but I finally have tasted my absolute worse sushi at Ginza.  We parked in the rear and made our way in - our 1st observation was the odor of this establishment. It was just awful and enough for us to walk right out, but we were invited to meet some friends for a birthday dinner.  We arrived early and made our way to the bar. There is no Happy Hour and no drink specials. We ordered the house wine and a beer. no issue with the service at this point. The party trickles in and we find ourselves seated around a Hibachi grill. I ordered the 3 roll sushi special for $14.95. When I inquired about the sushi I was immediately cut off and told to read the menu. Normally I would have closed out and ran out, but I was there for a friend's birthday dinner. Okay - the sushi was BLAND - no taste or attempt to make it appealing. The fish was NOT FRESH, the rice hard, a  drop of wasabi with the 3 slivers of dried out ginger,  coupled with the smell of the establishment made for a horrific dinner experience. Being a \\"Japanese Steak House\\" I did try the grilled meats - again - BLAND!! The service did improve and the cook was entertaining, but save yourself the time and money and find somewhere else to eat sushi.

The Steamed Pork Dumplings ($5.96) had a thin dough wrapper encasing the tasty filling/soup inside.  Not the best I've had, but second only to Din Tai Fung (I live in California so I'm partial to Din Tai Fung's magically thin wrapper). We also got the Shrimp & Pork Shao Mai ($8.50) - they were good, but nothing too special. The Beef Noodle Soup ($5.95) was excellently prepared and featured many pieces of soft, tender beef; al dente noodles; and a flavorful soup. The Daily Vegetable (\\"A\\" Vegetable) ($7.95) was saut√©ed in the usual Chinese style - simply with a bit of oil, garlic, and salt - and was a needed green to balance out the meal. We ended the meal with the Red Bean Paste Dumplings which I enjoyed thoroughly (and more than those at Din Tai Fung)  - the wrappers weren't as thin as the ones for the savory steamed dumplings, which was appreciated as otherwise the red bean v. wrapper ratio would have been too heavily red bean. They had a wide array of other delicious looking options on their menu so there's bound to be something for all eaters. If you're looking for a delicious meal, I'd look no further than Dinesty. \\n\\nAmbiance (5/5): Modern d√©cor - mainly neutral colors everywhere in the form of sleek stones/tiles with dark wood tables and black leather chairs. The place was packed when we got here at 7:00 pm for dinner with groups, large and small. The noise level was lively, but not too overwhelming and my boyfriend and I could still easily converse. For those looking for a slightly more private dining experience for a large party, I did see a enclosed off space in the back (in back of a cool, teapot shelf wall). \\n\\nLocation (5/5): Located right in the thick of things in the bustling West End. Conveniently accessible by walking or bus. You can easily do a bit of shopping or just walk around after dining. \\n\\nService (4/5): The staff was friendly and efficient. You can see them zooming around, some with their headsets in, but they're still courteous and willing to get you what you need. We made a reservation, so that drastically cut down our wait time - I definitely recommend making a reservation here. Once we got our order in, the food came at a fast pace, but halted suddenly at dessert, which took a good 10 minutes to come out after everything else had been cleared form the table. I didn't mind the slight delay as it gave me time to digest, but it was a bit strange given the expedited pace of the rest of the meal. \\n\\nOverall(4/5): Good food; fast service; like it!"},{"name":"Bob Evans","address":"5205 New Albany Rd","city":"New Albany","stars":"3","text":"Server mikella was great at suggested items to go with my meal.

Two tacos add up to about $10 when a \\"filling\\" lunch would be three tacos or so -- but I'm not trying to spend $15 dollars on eh tacos. \\n\\nOver the course of the summer, I tried the tikka chicken, cuban pig, annatto shredded pork, slow roasted angus brisket, shrimp and grits, and ahi poke. The tikka chicken was the most consistent for me and was usually a solid order. The cuban pig was actually too salty and I only ordered it once. The shredded pork was a solid order, but wasn't mind blowing. The angus brisket was good -- my guy friends think the beef tacos are the best/most consistent. The shrimp and grits was usually good and a fun play on the traditional shrimp and grits, except for the part where sometimes an order would be lacking on the shrimp part (don't be trying to skimp out on me!!). The ahi poke is good but a small order for the price, and of course, you can get better poke/raw tuna at an actual poke or Japanese restaurant.\\n\\nAlso, watch out for lines around noon on weekdays aka when all the tech people migrate out of their offices for lunch.

Excellent Chinese food, but a brand new Chinese food experience. What I love about this place is the way they stray from the traditional Chinese way of doing things, and yet still manage to keep the soul in their dishes. I like that, because most Chinese restaurants just look and feel the same to me nowadays...\\n\\nThese guys have a very modern space that's packed with people. Make reservations to save time! We were a big group, so we were very fortunate to get the private room. The private room was filled with miniature teapots in glass casings, which was a nice touch. Loved everything about the atmosphere of this place. It set the mood for us, and we were very excited to eat! \\n\\nFOOD: Like most dim sum restaurants, we ordered many small plates for us to share, but we also ordered some of the larger dishes. Great selection and loved all the food. They have so many fried rice options  I left Dinesty with a big ol' belly and a hell of a food coma.. \\n\\n*Xiao long baos (Chinese soup dumplings) - Dinesty specializes in these xiao long baos so be sure to order some while you're there (there were even some helpful instructions on how to eat them properly on the menu). They were absolutely delicious and I loved eating them while they were hot and fresh. Love the feeling of the warm soup bursting out of the dumpling. It was a pleasant surprise for those who have never tried them before. We made three orders, and it was enough for all of us to share plus a little extra. \\n\\n*Shrimp and pork shaomai - I've never seen shaomai made like this before. It had a unique design which was fun to look at, and it was equally as delicious. I love shaomai so I have no complaints about this! Wish I had soy sauce and chili oil to dump it in though...\\n\\n*Mongolian beef - This one really surprised me. It tasted so freaking good, almost like crispy Korean wings (except without the bone). It had some crunch, and a honey chili glaze that gave it a sweet and savory taste. This one was my favorite out of all the dishes I've had at Dinesty.\\n\\n*Salted pork fried rice - This one was just right (tastes like standard Chinese fried rice and not anything too amazing). Dinesty had so many fried rice choices though and I just wanted to try them all. The salted pork fried rice was delicious, rich and slightly salty on some bites. \\n\\n*Green onion pancakes - Delicious, but meh compared to most other green onion pancakes I've tried. Would have liked it if it was more flaky, and slightly crispy. This one was more on the soft side.\\n\\n*Steamed and fried buns with condensed milk - Our dessert option. I wasn't able to try the steamed buns with condensed milk, but I was able to try the fried ones. I used to eat those as a kid so the first bite felt more nostalgic than anything. Very delicious and slightly crispy as you bite into the crust - then it gets really soft, tender and delicious. I really wish they included more per serving...\\n\\n*Noodles - We ordered a large plate of noodles too, but they were more forgettable compared to all the other dishes and they were also my least favorite of the bunch. More of a filler than anything. I don't even remember what noodles they were exactly but I'll edit this later on when I find out.\\n\\nOverall, this was an amazing lunch experience. Loved the modern feel of dim sum, and every bite was delicious. For a large group like ours, everything was worth the price and the bill turned out relatively inexpensive. I wish they included just a little bit more in their servings, but I wouldn't go as far as to sacrifice their quality.

Goat cheese Madrona with filberts and two kinds of rhubarb, fresh and leather. The Tawney was worth the 14 years of aging. But what brought this eclectic meal together was the service Korey provided.

The average cost of an item is $7.99 and you can pick from sushi, rice bowls, noodle bowls, curry, soups and Bento boxes. I decided on the Tempura Udon, to the basics: it's a broth with noodles and tempura shrimp(3) and veggies on the side.

Right, a place to go and have a burger. Too bad though if most of the ingredients are out. Too bad as well that there is only one staff working the whole restaurant on a Wednesday night. Oh and before I forget, having the customers waiting on the table for 32 minutes to bring the good news is not putting them in a great mood either.\\n\\nWhat is this rant about? Well the above should give an idea but here is the sequel for those interested.\\n\\nWent to this foresaken place tonight (Wednesday) to have a dinner with my friend who was visiting from Seattle. We agreed on burger earlier so I decided I would take him here. I can't probably sit all too well because I'm kicking myself for hours for this attempt.\\n\\nWe entered the restaurant, it seemed to be pretty busy. One girl was working and seemingly that was all there was on staff. Oh well. The welcoming words? 'Find a seat it will take a little while till I'm with you.' Huh? Ok whatever.\\n\\nAfter getting the menu and a soda with a carbonation level of tab water, it took another 20 minutes to order. Mind you, this is a BURGER restaurant. If this is the main thing you sell, is it too much to ask to have at least the basic ingredients in stock? So after ordering the girl came back and nonchalant told us they are 'out of cheddar'. We shall try something else... Again, whatever. We picked another cheese. 2 Minutes later she comes back 'oh we are also out of bacon.'\\n\\nAlready on edge from the whole situation I looked at her and asked if this is actually a burger joint because two of the main ingredients for burgers out at 7:30p for sure does NOT look like it. Her reply? 'There is no need to be rude!' Thinking to myself... Lady if I was rude then you would for sure notice it another way.\\n\\nI looked over at my friend to see if I should really go all in and cause a scene (and that would have not ended well) or just leave that disgrace that calls itself a restaurant. I decided we leave. Good decision, certainly a better one than coming here in the first place. We went to Milestones and has a pleasant experience. And a substantial bill by the end of the evening.\\n\\nIf there was a way to give a place minus stars or boot it altogether... this would be it.\\n\\nThis experience doesn't seem to be normal given all upper scale reviews here.

WOW! I've had this dish once before and when I saw it on the menu I had to order it. Ermagherd. I asked for MORE bread to dip in the squid ink sauce.\\n\\nThe bravas were prepared differently. Instead of being fried and then tossed in the sauce, they used a fresher approach. Downside? The potatoes were so hot that the allioli started breaking apart and the tomato wasn't very spicy.\\n\\nThe chorizo was average...it didn't have a wow factor but it wasn't bad. I was not a fan of the garbanzo beans.\\n\\nGrilled beef heart was absolutely DELISH! Super lean and not tough at all.

And with our numbers having reached 20 plus, we follow the reservation route. Over the years you have clearly aspired to attract and more importantly accommodate such gatherings via the table arrangements, family style menu, and servers who do not run for the hills when there are similarly sized groups throughout the restaurant.\\nI'd like to start with what I've unfortunately seen decline. - Is it just me or has the overall Buca di Beppo experience been set aside? When we used to arrive, the host would explain why we were walking through the kitchen, point out the various themes, wave to tables, and explain the \\"history.\\" Cheesy? Yes. But it served to set a fun, more inviting mood. Most recently we were simply shepherded to our table and left to wait for our server to appear. Thought you all marketed a vibe?\\nSo I know cooking large quantities of Italian dishes is a feat. And I used to love quite a few of those dishes (calamari, pizza, and ravioli). This leves me to dislike honestly feeling as if flavor has been set on your back burner. Sure our recent round of dishes were all good (yes, even the no-cheese veggie pizza made for my vegan cousin) and no one left hungry...but nothing was memorable. Sauce, which should be your backbone, needs revamped.\\nNow onto the reasons we return. - The larger portions and their presentation encourage sharing and interaction. \\nGenial and efficient service that still manages to not feel rushed.\\nAnd of course the kitschy decor which ensures you will continuously find new things to discuss.

My group and I were extremely lucky to have came in before 4PM (that's when they start charging dinner prices). With that being said, lunch was pretty cheap, should've been less than $18 per person, but we ended up paying $20 per person because tip was added in. In my opinion, I don't think they deserved that much tip, because of the service we got. \\n\\nAfter we ordered and got our food items, we still had to wait an extra 10 minutes for our drinking water. That should've been given right away. I usually stay away from water at Asian restaurants, in fear of things floating around in my cup, and that fear came true. There were bits and pieces of things in my water, and I stopped drinking my water after that.\\n\\nWe also weren't given the same plating, meaning that one table got all the utensils, while my table didn't, even though we had asked for them. The wait staff wasn't that great, and they seem to ignore most requests that you have when it came to refilling drinks/broth/food items. \\n\\nAs for the food, it was average, nothing that made me want to order more and more. The vegetable portions were huge, especially the Chinese Broccoli, too big. The plus side of it was that we didn't have to finish everything, like of the other buffets where they make you finish all your food or else you pay double. \\n\\nOverall, my experience was meh this time around. But if you're craving for some hot pot, and you're in the area, this would be the place to go to.

For the main course I went with the seared duck breast with creamy polenta and roasted Brussel sprouts; rich, succulent and to die for. Dessert was a butterscotch custard with whipped cream and a salted sugar cookie. Holy crap. My taste buds are still in shock. The restaurant manager came by at least 5 times to make sure everything was satisfactory. Customer service all around was 5 stars, as was of course the food and atmosphere. I really felt they appreciated my business and did everything they could to ensure my return. And boy did they! The cherry on top is the fact that my entree alone was normally $25, but the special dining month pricing put all three courses at just $29 (plus a $10 upgrade fee for the duck since it wasn't on the dining month menu). I will go back and pay full price because of their excellent attention to detail and quality in all categories. Thank you Swank for your exceptional hospitality. Until next time.

It had a slightly sweet sauce that paired well with the portabello mushrooms. My friend had a steak special, which was SLIGHTLY overcooked but otherwise quite good.  I highly recommend the pork loin, but my friend said he would probably get a different entree if he went again.\\n  We finished the meal with the banana tart which was basically heaven on earth.

We headed out and over to Ranch 616, parking for free in back (if u can get it, not a lot of spaces) or park on the street and pay.  We went on Sunday at 5pm, so the place just opened and not busy at all.  Chane told us to come on in, take a seat and grabbed us some drinks while the kitchen was prepping to open.  Wife had ranch rita, good stuff, really taste liquor and prickly pear puree.  Started with fried oysters...came out super quick and......most fantastic fried oysters ever, buttery soft, perfect deep fry...if I wasn't eating anything else, I'd order 3 plates and a Pacifico and call it dinner, but there are a lot of items on the menu.  \\nWe went with the specials\\n- Quail, Filet, and Flautas over pablano mash and string beans with blue cheese:  Perfectly cooked filet, quail was crispy and meaty, and flautas were great...awesome dish\\n- I had filet, scallops, and crab...started eating and Chane comes over and informs me that he thought the filet was too small and went ahead and fired another filet medium rare....I got a side of 12oz steak for free.....i've just hit a pinnacle of dining experience... Customer service. \\n- Fried Pies for dessert,  really good, but you have to like fry bread.  The pies tasted like medium sweet navajo fry bread with a few peaches...perfect for me because i don't like super sweet cobblers and this was the perfect creation for me...if u like super sweet peach cobbler then you'd be disappointed. \\nAny gift certificate commands an automatic 18% gratuity on the original bill (which should always be the case) so all those cheepos out there beware.  If u use a gift certificate, the tip is figured prior to the price drop.  \\nEverything was stellar, loved the space, loved the music, the bartender and server were great...I can't give anything less than a 5 because frankly nothing went bad.

Our waitress was attentive and nice. But the food was just not good. I ordered a quarter white meat chicken with potatoes and green beans. The green beans were clearly from a can and they were covered in this weird bland tomato sauce. The potatoes were three brick-shaped mealy blocks. I didn't even finish them and I love my carbs. I've never met a potato I didn't like until today. The chicken was okay, forgettable, but not bad. The little triangle of pita I got was cold and it was soggy from sitting in the potato grease. The hummus was also fine, but forgettable. \\n\\nIn addition to the disappointing food, the decor in there is super outdated. Time for an upgrade. I was also a little surprised when the waitress brought us a bottle of Great Value (i.e. Wal-Mart) ketchup.

We first came in last summer just for drinks and enjoyed the bar atmosphere. While the beer selection isn't huge, it is still very good. They also have a full bar and I find the bartenders knowledgeable and friendly. The colonial burger is very good and the burger is always cooked the way it is ordered. Their lobster specials in the summer are a great price and although it's not the best lobster I've ever had, it is still very enjoyable and well priced. I found their lobster roll well done and worth the the price - big chunks of lobster meat and not a lot of mayo. We've been several times and I'd agree with other reviewers, the place is full of locals, but I think that's part of what makes the character. On our most recent visit we tried the nachos and they were the best nachos I've had in a long time - the chips were layered with toppings so you didn't end up with just a pile of chips with nothing on the them and all ingredients were great.

Renovated, redecorated, and ready to serve.... wonton soup?  Lol  Interesting to see a Japanese restaurant offer miso or wonton soup.  So now I get skeptical....  The staff looks different... I think.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I had Shrimp Sunomono, Volcano Roll, Spider Roll, and a lunch special.  Good thing about the shrimp sunomono is that they used rock shrimp and not the little baby shrimps.  The bad?  Vinegar was too sour and the dish was too bland.  They have lunch specials there for 6.50 and you choose 1 item from column A (Teri beef, chicken, curry, etc) and B (rolls).  I ordered Curry Chicken and Spicy Tuna Roll.  I got Chicken Teriyaki instead....... I guess she didn't hear me, but I was too hungry to care lol.  The chicken was good and so was the veg (warning: veg was heavily peppered if you are sensitive to it), also came with a side of rice which was perfectly cooked.  The  spicy tuna roll that came with it was actually 8 large pieces and not 4 dinky ones that I was expecting like most other places.  Okay, spicy tuna is pretty easy to make and you can't go wrong, but my problem was the rice.  Rice was slightly over cooked, gummy and lacked seasoning.  The spider roll was the same, loved the inside and not the rice on the outside.  Volcano roll (I guess is their signaiture roll), was a bit dissapointing.  The menu had no description of the roll, but we ordered it anyways.  Crab, well done tuna, rice, nori, deep-fried and then drizzled with cock sauce (aka sriracha), mayo, teriyaki sauce, and topped with green onions.\\n\\nGood portions, great price, so-so quality and if you go now they offer 20% off for their Grand Opening.

Not so much a fan of Taco Mac, but a fan of beer. Thanks to Taco mac though my beer taste buds are ever so happy. Being a part of the Passport Club and being encouraged to try new flavors every time you come has made me quite knowledgeable on the subject of barley and hops. Not sure if that's a good or a bad thing... \\n\\nSo Lindbergh.... I'm sorry, but you just have to get your act together. If you're going to be in such close proximity to my dwelling station you're just gonna have to sit back relax and get your stuff in line. It's not really all that hard to function in a corporate atmosphere. Dust off that big manual they provided you, read it, and go. When you're busy, have more staff members available to your patrons. When you run out of a certain beer, take the tap off of the wall so I'm not tempted to order it. \\n\\nI've never been a huge fan of dining in corporate restaurants, but I'd like to continue to build up my beer list and try them all. I mean, let's all be honest here, nobody really comes here for the food with the exception of maybe the wings. Taco Mac, you have got to be better at something... please!   \\n\\nIf not for the beer, I don't think I'd come. It's a great place to watch sports with the massive amount of TVs, but in the end, how many bars are there within 2 miles that can provide me with the same thing. Come on Lindbergh.... step it up... if people aren't out spending money you need to take care of the ones that do visit your establishment. Provide better service, and attempt if you can to not seem like an over sized corporate bar that is trying way too hard to be something it's not. Have better staff members that understand the reason behind the word hospitality. I love feeling like I belong and that I'm wanted when I dine. I like to have a bartender or server who cares enough about me and my friends. At least ones that understand you're required to do that to earn a living in this industry and attain repeat business.  Maybe it's just me, but even though you are a huge bar I still feel that each person that enters your business should be made to feel like they matter.  I'm finished.\\n\\nWell....Thanks for the beer... I appreciate the knowledge and thank you for many years of giving me a reason to go to the gym.

Unequivocally 5 stars.  These are hands down the best tacos I've ever had in any US State, including California where I grew up.  Their food manages to be original while hitting all the right classic taco truck notes.  A close second to the awesomeness of their food is the homemade salsas they have chilling in the cooler by the window.  I tried (and loved) all of them.\\n\\nThese guys took 35 mins to make me 3 tacos and I was late for class.  No doubt in my mind they deserve 5 stars.

No one checked on us, 15 minutes later we asked the manager when the other 2 meals were coming. She came back to our table and said they would be out shortly, our guests asks if she knew what they had ordered. She rambled off items that were incorrect. They gave her the correct orders and she went back to the kitchen to have them made on the fly. She then came back to the table and handed one of our guests the steak and eggs he ordered, she said \\"im sorry, this was ready we must have missed it\\". So he received a cold meal, much like ours were after 30 minutes of waiting with our food in front of us. Our last guest finally received their meal and we all ate.

The rice for this dish doesn't taste sweet, but it's more of a slightly salty savoury taste to it. It's wrapped in banana leafs and it will be unwrapped once it arrives to your table. The outer layer is covered with delicious sticky rice. Inside, there are yellow beans, pork, chicken, and a salted egg yolk. I always ask for it without soy sauce poured on it because I find it unnecessary for it to be added.\\n\\nTheir sliced beef in soy sauce with fried rice noodle was very good.

I highly recommend getting the appetizer plate featuring duck, chicken, and both types of pork when eating with a larger group. \\n\\nThe flavors are quite different than a lot of the Chinese places in town - they don't really adjust for American palates and I think the food is the better for it. \\n\\nHot pepper oil (REAL hot oil, not sesame oil with some pepper flakes in it like most places), pungent mustard, and duck sauce are provided on every table to adjust dishes to your taste.

I live 30 minutes from here with a million sushi restaurants nearby, and always make the trip to come here instead. If you do end up going, ask for Khiet. He is the most patient server and remembers to bring me things I forget to ask for. His memory is wonderful. He remembered my full order by my third visit. If you're near- you gotta visit this place.

Rooms are well appointed, though somewhat dated, yet very clean, spacious, and well kept.  Extras like small flat panel tv built into bathroom mirror are a tad over the top.

Towels are plentiful, but rough, not soft and luxurious as they should be.  Room service is pricey to begin with, then add $3 delivery charge, 24 percent service charge...not a gratuity mind you, because the bellhop is also waiting with his hand out...outrageous.  Beds are very comfortable and big flat screen hdtv with hbo is a nice but expected perk in a hotel of this caliber.  One of the better in room wifi connections I have experienced.  Reliable and fast.  I find it annoying that there is a charge to use the fitness center, so I protested and ran outside in the sea of humidity known as Orlando.  And finally, the bullshit $10 day resort fee is not appreciated.  Apparently it covers your two daily complimentary water bottles and high speed internet.

The salsa that is complimentary with chips is thin (not my preference) but tasty. Enchiladas are ok, while tacos are better. Actually, the tacos are pretty darn good. You can choose sides of rice and beans with most dishes; we like the black beans a lot, but have noticed an odd taste in the pinto beans. Pick the black beans. For starters, I thought the guacamole was really good, and relatively reasonably priced (about $8 for a huge serving).\\n\\nThe beers list is adequate. They have around 6 beers available on draft; I usually order a Dos Equis Amber, which comes in a frosty mug with a lime wedge. There are also Mexican beers available in the bottle. I like that they have a few Mexican beers on draft. I have not tried the margaritas, but from seeing other diners order them, they look like they're worth a try.\\n\\nThe atmosphere and service are where Cactus Club starts to fall apart for me. When you enter the restaurant, you're in the dark bar area, which is usually more crowded than the dining room and features several tvs. If you're eating, you go to the very large dining room painted in Southwestern strips and pinks. The acoustics in this room make it seem loud even when it's not particularly crowded. I feel like I always end up paying a lot of attention to other people's conversations here because they're easy to listen to.\\n\\nAnd oh, the other people. The proximity to Berklee and maybe even BU and Northeastern is evident in the people here. There are usually large groups of students (most often female, for some reason). The \\"older\\" crowd tends to be couples in their mid-20s through early-30s. There's nothing wrong with the crowd particularly, but I definitely do not go here for the people. I guess maybe my issue is that Cactus Club doesn't seem to have a crowd so much as it attracts a certain age group who don't have much else in common. I will say that the groups of college students make for some entertaining eavesdropping.\\n\\nFinally, service is intermittent. We've never had truly bad service here, but it's sometimes significantly lacking. Most recently I was served chicken tacos when I ordered fish tacos (I just ate them--they were good and to be honest at first I thought they were just really mild-flavored fish). Sometimes service can also be slow during the meal, but almost always I feel rushed to pay. Once they know you're done eating, it's time for you to go.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to sitting outside in the spring and sipping some drinks--I have a feeling that might be the best thing about Cactus Club, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet!"},{"name":"Whitewood Mediterranean Grill","address":"1 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I enjoyed this place while being in downtown Orlando!

I only just retried the xiaolongbao and it tasted better than the ones I've eaten here before. My new favourites are the mapo tofu, mongolian beef, and spicy wontons. \\n\\nMapo tofu has that classic Szechuan numbing spice and the tofu is really soft. This dish goes great with rice. One of the better Mapo tofus i've had. \\n\\nThe mongolian beef here resembles ginger beef. Deep fried beef coated with a dark sauce. It tastes like sweet and sour sauce but made with brown sugar and tastes more savoury. I can finish this dish on my own most of the time because it's.so.good. \\n\\nThe spicy wontons are pretty good here as well. The wontons are served hot with chilli oil and what I think is Chinese rice vinegar. Only complaint is that some of the wontons stick to each other which is a hassle to pick apart. Overall, the flavour is good and acts as a good appetizer. \\n\\n--\\n\\nAlthough food has gotten better, the service is one of the worst i've encountered. I can never make a reservation the day of because they don't allow it? Very strange. During busy hours, the front of the restaurant is almost always unattended which is the worst because with their almost non-existent waiting area, it gets very crowded. Waitresses are usually attentive, but it is one of the head waitresses that yells at other employees in Chinese in the crowded restaurant while not knowing that 50% of the diners can understand what she is saying. As well, some waitresses act like they don't wanna be there, with grumpy looks on their faces and the way they talk. The male host I encountered the other day forgot who I was 5 minutes after taking down my name on the sheet! \\n\\nOverall, service definitely needs some improvements, food has gotten better and I probably will go back whether or not changes are made. Hopefully I will see things improve in the future."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"4351 13th St","city":"Saint Cloud","stars":"2.5","text":"The food didn't even taste the same.

You know when you clean the floor with a moldy mop? Something like that so it smelled like moldy soy sauce; it was kind of a put off, even more so when we walked into the restroom; it was disgusting. One of the toilets had overflowed, and the other was just; I don't even want to go into detail, there was only one decent stall and we had to wait just to use a reasonably acceptable toilet. \\n\\nThey were not busy on this particular night and we had to wait well over an hour before we were finally fed; granted, we were a rather large party but people who had arrived after us were already finishing up by the time our cook arrived at the grill.\\nI ordered the calamari and chicken habachi combo and the cook had forgotten my calamari and it was the last thing to be cooked so by the time I got the calamari, the rice and noodles were already cold.

When I want coffee I go to whatever is close by which usually turns out to be Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts.  But every now n then I am in the mood for something a little bit different.\\n\\nEnter The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf! One of the things I love about their iced coffee is that it doesn't taste as mellow as Dunkin or McDonalds but it's also not as strong like a punch to your face like Starbucks either.  In my opinion Starbucks coffees are a bit more acidic, so I drink those sparingly.   \\n\\nBut here the iced coffee has a great balance.  You got perfect notes of coffee and the flavoring of your choice.  I can't stand when a shop over sweetens their drinks and that's something I've never had to complain about here.  I recommend their hazelnut flavoring with hot or iced coffee.\\n\\nNow let's talk about their Caramel Espresso ConPanna!  Starbucks makes a similar shot called an undertow(minus the cool hwhipped cream)but here it's made and presented beautifully.  It's espresso layered on top of hot caramel topped off with cool hwhip cream on top, served in a small glass with a spoon.  You can shoot it or spoon it or mix it n sip it.  If you're tired of sugary drinks and just want a quick boost with a sweet kick, I highly recommend it.  Just don't let it sit too long.  Espresso flavor doesn't improve the longer you let it sit.  \\n\\nTheir Thai teas ain't bad neither.  Not as bold as say an original Thai restaurant but a very nice emulation of it.  \\n\\nI love visiting this place whenever time and convenience permits.  \\n\\nTreat yourself!"},{"name":"50 Plates","address":"333 NW 13th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My Lady and I have been itching to try 50 Plates for a while now, but after the glut of Yelp reviews (seeming to peak about 2 months ago) that were really all over the place, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We took my parents there for their last dinner in town and all I can say it this place is FANTASTIC!\\n\\nI'm guessing part of the reason yelpers either love or hate 50 Plates is because it is the very definition of an experimental \\"concept\\" restaurant.  Yes, it's part of a \\"chain\\" of local restaurants, but nothing about 50 Plates is corporate or cookie-cutter.  In fact, 50 Plates is one of the most unique and enjoyable dining experiences I've had in PDX, bar none!\\n\\nThe \\"theme\\" is best described as American Tapas - they have a bunch of reasonably priced small plate dishes, all inspired by different regions and flavors of the good ol' US of A.  As such, many of the dishes tend to be on the small side so you'll probably want to mix and match a few if you're going to 50 Plates for dinner.\\n\\nYou also have to be open minded enough to enjoy creative twists on a lot of traditional favorites, often made with decidedly \\"un-gourmet\\" (but oh so delicious) ingredients.\\n\\nMy Lady, my parents, and I all shared about 9-10 dishes, and not ONE of them was a disappointment.  Here are some of the highlights:\\n\\n+Castroville Artichoke rolls: like little spring rolls, these crispy little buggers were amazing!  I would never have ordered them myself, but damn they were great!\\n\\n+Dirty Rice \\"beignets\\": Not sweet cajun donuts, but savory andouille sausage, veggie, and rice fritters that were very tasty, but could have been spicier (though they do have comically small bottles of tabasco on each table to kick it up a bit).\\n\\n+Shrimp & Grits: perfectly cooked shrimp, the grits on their own would have been bland but blended nicely with the spicy ragout.\\n\\n+El Paso (or Santa fe, I forget which) Silver Dollar Sammy (slider): what an amazing flavor combination - I never would have thought a chorizo beef patty, with refried beans and \\"cheeze whiz\\" could be so delicious!\\n\\n+Rosco slider: a nicely fried chicken strip drizzled in sweet coffee maple syrup and sandwiched between two half-sized waffles.  Once again, non-gourmet ingredients come together to make something special.\\n\\n+Pan-seared Swordfish (the fish of the day) and Succotash: Oh, this was simply to die for.  Perfectly cooked, firm, fresh swordfish in a marvelous bouillon of grape tomatoes, hominy, lima beans, and corn.  Fragrant and nicely spiced, this succotash had a little kick and would have been wonderful even on it's own!\\n\\nWith such wonderful food came great service, as everything was delivered to our tables with expert timing - we never had to wait long for anything, but our server didn't keep piling plates onto the table; he waited until we'd finished the first round of dishes before bringing the rest of our orders.\\n\\nI really can't say enough about our server - for a young chap he really did a great job of chatting with us, making personal recommendations, and even basically chose both our bottles of wine.  The wine can be quite spendy; our \\"mid-priced\\" Oregon Pinot was nearly $50, but it was very, very good.\\n\\nWe finished off with a couple of desserts to share - bananas foster and the humorously named \\"Faux Hos\\" (their version of \\"ho-hos\\", served with a glass of chocolate milk!).\\n\\nThe decor is comfortably elegant - most tables for four feature 2 chairs opposite comfy leather loveseat, and everything is done up in tasteful black and white.  50 Plates manages to find that elusive state of being where you can feel comfortable eating chili with a milkshake or a Kobe beef fillet with a fine Pinot Noir.\\n\\nIt was a great experience from beginning to end, but what will really keep us coming back is the terrific Happy Hour (M-F, 3-6pm) and daily drink and food specials.  While their regular dinner menu features daily fresh fish and \\"Meat & Potato\\" selections, over in the bar you can enjoy:\\n\\n+Manhattan Mondays: cheap Manhattans, cosmos, and New York-style hot dogs\\n+Fat Tuesdays: cheap Sazeracs, Pomegranate martinis, and Po' Boys\\n+Whiskey Wednesdays: cheap Old Fashioneds, Whiskey Sours, and Roscoes sliders\\n+Thirst Day Thursdays: cheap margs, Moscow Mules, and fries w/gravy\\n+Fry Day Fridays: classic Martini, fries, and \\"Cheese wings\\"\\n+Plus 5-6 little plates priced between $1.50-$4.50, during HH all week long\\n\\nSo it's possible to drink and dine on a budget during happy hour, or make a dinner of it and try a bunch of things.\\n\\nSeriously, 50 Plates is a real gem and I plan to make it one of my Happy Hour mainstays in the Pearl!"},{"name":"American Fresh Beer Garden","address":"301 Canal St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Ever since they popped up a few years ago, Slumbrew has been a standout favorite among local beers.  For one, the beers are absolutely top-notch; even the ones i don't care for are great examples of their type, but i could spend a weekend locked inside with a case of their porter (i was lucky enough to request for it to be put on tap at my wedding, for instance) and come out happy.  Beyond that, they're always showing up at festivals and races and things and seem to have quickly become an institution.\\n\\nWhen we heard they were opening a beer garden at Assembly Square, we were super-psyched, but it was a surprise to find that, the summer having gone, they improvised with a heated tent.  \\n\\nIt's awesome, comfortable and warm for people who are not me, plenty of tables to loiter around and set down your drink while still being a standing-around-friendly place.  The pints seem big and on the generous side, and are inexpensive by local standards at $6.50ish.  The whole thing has a cheerful ad-hoc feel to it, especially considering the owners/brewers were there ready to talk at length about their craft while you made your choice.  On a Thursday night, soon after they opened, it was busy, but not overwhelming late into the evening.  It's like a more chill version of the Harpoon brewery's festivals.  \\n\\nThe only downside is that as Assembly Square becomes increasingly overrun, the secret will be out in a hurry.  Summer afternoons might become competitive.  Or, alternatively, they can take over the whole darn parking lot.

I expressed to him that for the amount of time we waited it's unacceptable to be served cold food.  He offered to reheat the food, which is absurd, you just brought it to me! Nonetheless we were hungry so we proceeded to suck it up and just eat the cold food.  After paying the bill I asked to see the manager, he comes over, I begin to tell him my frustration with the service from tonight and he made it worse. He first attempted to justify the wait time, which I don't mind waiting if Im being served hot food, but to wait that long and receive cold food, not right! He says, well I told Aaron to offer to reheat your food, and I'm asking him how he would feel if he went out to eat and was served cold food, would that be acceptable, he says yes because he likes cold food.

Date night:\\n\\nWe ordered from the Wagyu beef menu (for 2) tonight and let me tell you, if you are a beef enthusiast, or even just a foody, this was an out-of-this-world experience! Of course, because of the richness of the Wagyu and its fat content, you can only have a small portion (5-6 bite sized morsels), but boy was it ever worth it! Word of warning - savour it, chew it and really taste it! Don't waste it! It literally melts in your mouth, no matter the done-ness. Seasoned perfectly and just felt/tasted like beefy butter. I had mine done rare, and my boyfriend went with medium; they both tasted very similar in terms of texture and flavour - very delicious and you almost can't even tell the difference between the two. It was my first time having Wagyu too and we were not disappointed in the slightest.\\n\\nThe meal also came with an appetizer sushi plate (2 pieces of salmon sashimi, 4pcs aburi sushi - 2 pcs of 2 different kinds, 1 was chewy with kelp on top and the other was a crispy one), 4 scallops, 2 chunks of cod, veggie stir-fry (zucchini, onions, mushrooms), fried rice and stir-fried beansprouts.\\n\\nThe appetizer sushi plate was tasty; the crispy one though, I wasn't a huge fan of but that could have just been personal preference. The scallops weren't done perfectly (a tad undone), but they were still good and tasty. The portions were good (I saw some reviews of people complaining about the portions - there was plenty!) The veggies and rice ended up tasting really good mixed with the ginger sauce they give you in a little dish with teriyaki sauce on the other side.\\n\\nI've been to numerous teppanyaki places before, and would have liked to see this place clean their grills the way I see the other restaurants do... When we sat down, it was dirtier than I am used to (it's usually spotlessly clean elsewhere and ready for the cook start with a quick wipe down with a clean wet towel), and they did clean it before the cook started while we had been seated for at least 10-15mins, but I would have preferred it to have been spotless before I sat down, so that it wasn't getting potentially splashed onto the appetizer plate that was being eaten while they were cleaning the grill with splashy wet soppy methods (this was the only part I took a star off for). The splashy wet soppy mess clean-up usually happens at the end...\\n\\nIn summary, the food is amazing here - come here if you want high quality Wagyu beef and a really good flavour profile in a multiple course meal with variety - everything that is grilled is seasoned very perfectly tasty! The service was also very friendly and the environment was comfortable and colourful - I loved the interior style and the choice to have a regular Japanese meal as well without the teppanyaki (the menu looked like they had a lot of high quality sushi and sashimi too and would love to try it out the next time I am here!

However, the service is not good: in the best case scenario they are slow and seem more interested in chatting among them than in paying attention to the customers. We asked for a table inside one day in which we only wanted a beer and the waitress only told us that inside it is mandatory to ask for something to eat once we were seated.

We started with the appetizer sampler and although the empanadas were nasty, the taquitos, nachos and wings were not as good. The presentation could have also been better. I had a bulldog margarita which was good. The worst part of the experience was waiting for the entrees. We waited 45 minutes to an hour from the time we ordered our entrees to when it was actually brought out. I ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas. The wait was very disappointing. The waitress and manager kept saying the food would be out soon and that they were very backed up in the kitchen, but by the time the food came, we weren't even really hungry anymore. The only thing they offered us to make up for the wait was free dessert. We decided on the fried ice cream, but the fried dough shell was cold and didn't have a fresh taste. Overall we had just an OK experience."},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is a sad review for me to write. We live in the neighborhood and have been to Barlata many times and have taken quite a few folks when we have visitors. Over this past weekend we had 5 dear friends come in to town and made reservations for 7:30pm on Saturday. We walked over and arrived at 7:20 - We were told there was going to be a 15 -20 min wait. Being Saturday night and our party being 7 people, that was understandable. We grabbed seats at the bar and ordered drinks. An hour later we went up to ask and were told that the people at our table had paid and the staff was waiting for them to leave. The hostess and manager said they would let us know when they could seat us. We go back to the bar. Shortly after we notice a different table being bussed and set up for 7 people - Naturally we think they have moved us since the other table was still occupied. At this point we have been at Barlata for 1 hr 15 mins. - The manager sees us looking at the table being set up and comes over to tell us that is for another party who had just arrived. When we asked why we were being made to wait even longer we were told that those people were from out of town and had made their reservation a month or so ago, compared to our reservation we had made 5 or so days ago. It was too late to go anywhere else so we stayed and watched the other party be seated. About 10 minutes after that we were finally shown to our table...While I like the food we will never go back. We had talked up Barlata to ou friends only to be met with an hour and a half wait. This is not how you treat customers and not how you manage expectations. In a city full of wonderful restaurants, no one needs to put up with this type of behavior."},{"name":"Flippers Pizzeria","address":"80 W Grant St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I always love some good pizza and service.

With all the traffic and road blocks downtown, delivery came in a good time for the circumstances and we very much appreciated that. \\n\\nNow onto the food, it was pipping hot and good. We ordered the Buffalo chicken pizza and a make your own pizza with pepperoni and half bacon half onion.

They say chitlins are available during the winter months so I am sure we will be back so he can try them, he even said he was gonna bring the coleslaw. We had a good time with the server too. My dad said he couldn't decide what he wanted cause everything sounded good. So we ordered every meal on the menu except for the ham hocks and oven baked chicken..the server couldn't believe that we really wanted all of it.. My dad told her unless they have a sampler plate where you get bout four of the meats on one plate, we getting all of them..not sure where to start..I must say we were impressed. We dove into the fried fish first. It was cooked great..was satisfied with the amount too,( sometimes I never order fried tilapia cause it is really cheap). The smothered chicken hands down is some of the best I ever had. My dad is a dark meat liker so I ended up with a breast, praying it wouldn't be dry..far from it, could still see the juices coming from the moist inside. The ox tails must have been wonderful too, even tho I didn't get to taste them. By the time I got to that plate it was only bones left..lol. The pork chops were basic, nothing too spectacular..didn't get to too many sides, was too full..will make a effort to save room on my next visit.

I don't treat myself to dessert very often and so it is a big deal for me when I do. When I arrived, I there was a couple in front of me so I knew there would be a little wait, but the hipstery guy behind the counter didn't even acknowledge me with a \\"hello' when I came in, or for the entire 5 minutes I was waiting. When ordering, I was torn between two items and asked him what he would suggest. He recommended the Summer something pie and so I went with it, and a chai. By the second bite I knew it wasn't for me. It was dry and the frosting was hard. Granted, it was the end of the night, but it just didn't taste good. I sat there for a few minutes ruminating before having enough courage to kindly ask for a replacement. I figured since I spent $12.50 (because of uncomfortable and obligitory feeling 15% min. tip line they have you sign right in front of them) it would be worth asking to replace it with something else I had before and knew I would enjoy. My chai was good and so when I went up to him I complimented him on it and told him how I don't often get to treat myself and would he mind replacing it with the other option I was originally toying with getting. He looked at the situation as if I was asking for his first born child. He waivered a bit and then reluctantly said \\"Umm...we don't really do that...I mean, you ate some of it and so I can't sell it now.....I will do it just this one time, but only this once.\\" Mind you, the item I replaced it with was almost $2 less, and it was the end of the night and probably soon to be tossed. The fact he even said that they can't resell it felt as if he was trying to school me on business or like because of this exception it is now drastically jeopardizing their bottom line. It is a super reasonable and customary practice in the food industry to offer to replace something if it doesn't taste good. Most places even replace it AND offer compensation for trouble. I wasn't asking for anything above and beyond the norm, but was made to feel like a troubling nuissance. \\nAs I sat down to eat, I watched the next guy go up and wait at the counter. Mr. hipster just blatantly ignored him. The customer shrugged at his rudeness and finally looked back at me and asked if \\"I\\" knew where the water refill area was. I pointed to it, and he shot me a knowing look and whispered sarcastically \\"Great service huh?\\" as he returned to his seat.\\nSo much for relaxing \\"me\\" time, instead, I sat there with tears in my eyes as I hurried to finish so I could leave.  \\nI'd been in once before and had a good experience from a peppy & nice man who had the air of either owning or managing the place. He was also there this evening, but in the back most all of the time. It was a night and day difference between the two visits. I've read the other reviews and it seems that there is a common theme. Although I won't return, I really hope they listen to these reviews and consider either drastically reviving the attitude of their apathetic and demeaning staff member(s) or hire some new people that understand customer service and know how to at least fake a smile."},{"name":"Gabriela's Downtown","address":"900 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Gabriela's immediately popped up in the Yelp app when we were looking for Mexican food for lunch - and I'm glad it did!\\n\\nTiny paid parking lot outside which yes will cost you money but will also give you an outstanding view of the Austin skyline.

Separate from my party, I can't help but feel it's pretty much just me and a whole bunch of cougars.\\n\\nThe Wine Bistro, as its name implies, features more wine than I can imagine drinking in a lifetime, offering something for lovers of any fermented grape variation. There is a small set of beers for non-winos (coughmecough), though you shouldn't have high expectations for this given the venue's focus.\\n\\nThe food ranges from just acceptable to very good, the flatbreads being the winner among tasters. The kitchen's signature bistro meatball pops up under almost every menu subheading: have it on a baguette; have it sliced up on your flatbread; have it alongside your favorite pasta; have it in your chocolate pot au creme. (Or not.) They call it out in the pasta section as the \\"giant, soon to be world famous braised veal meatball\\", and while the hyperbole isn't justified, it is a tasty, tender thing. For spaghetti dishes, the marinara is passably good, while the pomodoro simply tastes like the marinara cut with too much evoo (if you don't say it like Rachel Ray, it doesn't count). Overall the menu is of sufficient quality and variety to please any palate. The pot au creme and berry desserts were both very good; the former is definitely better without the meatball.\\n\\nService varied in my trips between highly alert and \\"Oh, that's right, you guys are my table!\\" [insert hybrid bubble gum pop and Houdini-esque disappearing noise] Food prices are reasonable --  I don't agree with the current $$$ rating on here. $$ is more appropriate.\\n\\nHave a glass, have a bite, admire all the wicked ways to get inebriated.

I can tell that the ingredients they use are fresh and high quality and my take out food is always hot and never soggy.

Except if you are driving around at 2-4am. At which point, you cannot get a burrito, or anything else, I'm pretty sure, at Chipotle. This is no fault of the business, it just makes it a pain in the ass to get in and out of the storefront. No big deal. I'm a tough Cambridge kid, I got it covered. \\n\\nIt's a chain restaurant. Something that I usually shy away from, but I came here with somebody who worked in the area for lunch, so we couldn't go far. Cheddar's was closed - seriously, closed on Sunday! Hmmm. Note to self, don't plan on that on a Sunday in the future...\\n\\nWe walked in, around noon, the place was fairly empty. There is plenty of seating, tall bar type tables - that are oddly separated, making a whole VERY TEENY table. Some counters in the windows with tall stools, and regular (also fairly small) regular type tables. We ordered, and as soon as I'd spoken, they started making my carnitas burrito. \\n\\nThe dude pulled a bay leaf outta my tortilla and started to explain what it was - I often cook with bay leaves, and was not skeeved out at all, but it's not a pretty looking thing once it's been cooked to death. Most people wouldn't be all that cool with it being picked out, methinks. I got hot salsa, lettuce, and guac on my burrito. It was SO MASSIVE that the tortilla broke upon rolling. The guy apologized ALOT and made it again, adding more guac. HOLY CRIPES! \\n\\nThe thing was almost the size of a football by the time he was done making it. I'm not positive how much it cost, cause I was being treated to lunch - almost $7? \\n\\nIt was ok. I don't think I'll be going back though. It was not good enough to try something else, either. The spicy salsa wasn't even spicy. Weirdly enough... They don't have hots for their burittos either. No bueno!\\n\\nI found the notes about recycling really nice all over the condiment bar. It was a wee bit confusing to me as to WHERE the recyclables really went, until my friend explained it to me. \\n\\nNote: The employees were really very nice here, but I already know I like other fast burritos joints in the area.

I ordered the Don Combo, fried oysters and calamari, and OMG, those were the best fried oysters in memory. Crispy on the outside with a very light breading and soft and succulent in the middle. The calamari was cut in longer segments than I've had other places which helped them seem meatier. That appetizer came with a couple of dipping sauces that were chipotle pink and jalape√±o green. Both had just the right amount of heat. I had intended to share the app with my friend but by the time she arrived I had eaten the whole thing. She ordered it, too, and made it her meal.

Time to update Miel one more star (still not 5... yet...) for a wonderful dinner, with impeccable service.  Fred was our server for the evening, and he is a \\"maestro\\" in pairing foods and wine, and guiding you through the Miel olive oil tasting experience.  Each and every one of his recommendations were SPOT ON, and if he feels honestly about something, he will walk you through choices.  The meal - hit and miss.  Some dishes were flawless, others were, eh.  Lets start with appetizers of delectable oysters - creamy, briny, bursting with flavor (as opposed to the anti climatic experience at the Union Oyster House several weeks prior).  Oysters and champagne for starters in this beautiful restaurant on a snowy evening, got the party started on a very elegantly.  For the table of 5, we also ordered the scallops which were flavorful but a tad over cooked, the tar tare and the escargot Provencal.  The tar tare was over salted, a dish that could have been but wasn't a hit...  The escargot... lets call them THE escargots! A must have with a side of the decadent and addictive pomme frites.  Add a beautiful selection of wine and OMG, the party is just warming up!!! The Manager explained to us how they have been working on their rendition to the snail, and definitely they have come up with a combination that highlights the rustic character of the crawler, and not in the super garlicky fashion (OK, nothing wrong with obnoxious amounts of garlic butter), but accompanied by a flavorful and well balanced bed of lovely vegetables and a dressing of their fabulous olive oils.  A small round of puff pastry adds crunch and butter, but allows for the filling of perfectly cooked critters and their earthy guests to take center stage.  Wonderful dish.  We opted for the duck nestled upon a confit hash, that quite frankly, I would've had by the BUCKET full.  At $32 for this entree (Yes, I shared it) - it was very well executed and full of flavor - hash meets coussolet with a proportioned balance of confit... EXCELLENT.  (I could have that hash with some poached any breakfast of the week).  The vegetarian ravioli were overwhelmed by too much stuff going on, and the rib eye was as good as any aged beef can be.  We were presented with a medley of desserts - CREPES AND TARTIN people, you can't go wrong, with a beautiful desert wine that Fred swore by (I hate it when he can be SO right - he took away the pleasure of beating on him!!!).  \\n\\nStaff is lovely, restaurant is beautiful, and dinner was charmingly festive.  The GM is relatively new and he is young, with a vision for his restaurant that is surely coming together with a subtle elegance, a French experience that clearly accounts for the New England palate and a down to earth enthusiasm for his guests to enjoy their culinary experience.

To be fair, it was pretty pricy because we ordered so many different dishes, but to me it was totally worth it.\\n\\nAlthough we made reservations in advance, when we arrived (on a Thursday night at 7:30pm), the place was more than half-empty, so we obviously didn't need them. It was refreshing to not wait 30+ minutes for once at a highly-acclaimed restaurant in Portland.\\n\\nWe started with drinks, \\"the sake\\" and \\"the tequila\\". Both were strong but delicious and we would have had several if it weren't for the $8 price tag.\\n\\nFor our meal, we ordered a hodge podge of small and large dishes from the menu:\\n\\n-Oysters w/ fish sauce, cilantro & lime: These were fantastic! $2 per oyster, but they were fairly large oysters and had a great kick to them. I probably could have eaten a dozen or so of these as my meal.\\n\\n-Fried kale w/ candied bacon & fish sauce: Wow! I am not a big kale fan, but this is tempura'd kale with bacon and fish sauce! I don't think I would be able to come back and not order this dish. It is a must have if you go to Smallwares.\\n\\n-Carrot gnocchi w/ mushrooms: This was actually the last dish we decided on, but I'm glad we did because it was the best thing I ate that night, even among all the other gems on the menu. The carrot gnocchi was silky smooth with just the right amount of sweetness and the mushrooms provided enough saltiness to balance out the dish.\\n\\n-Chicken Lollipops: These were pretty much what you'd expect, fried chicken on a \\"lollipop\\" bone with sriracha mayo, which is always good. \\n\\n-Pork Belly Ssam: I personally love pork belly, so I had high expectations for this dish, which is basically make-it-yourself lettuce wraps with the perfectly cooked and seasoned pork belly and two types of sauces. It wasn't as memorable as the gnocchi or the fried kale, but it was delicious and would probably be a stand-out at many other restaurants.\\n\\nBy the time we were done with our food, there was no room left for dessert, which we'll have to try next time we go to Smallwares.\\n\\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention the service.

My BF got the Beacon Hill burger, with bacon, and sweet potato fries on the side. He said is burger was good, though it was, despite the bacon, a regular burger. Nothing too special, I guess. \\n\\nThe beer was more limited than expected. We were both disappointed and settled for some Sam Adams variety. \\n\\nThis place is huge for Boston. Inside, it definitely feels like a chain restaurant. Nothing spectacular about the decor, though, as my BF pointed out, the outside is misleading. You may expected a hole-in-the-wall gem (like Bukowski's) but, instead, you get a pretty average place. Well, I guess there can only be one Bukowski's, right?\\n\\nAs for the service, it was great.

There's something about grunge that is very appealing to me (in regards to food places, sorry not into the Jessie James type). The seating is in a long narrow hallway which kinda reminds me of NYC. It's a hot spot for younguns, but don't worry about them and their shenanigans...they're quelled by the anticipation of delicious Colombian cheeeeeburgers. \\n\\nIt's all or nothing for me...so I definitely recommend getting everything on your cheeseburger. Take a stroll over to the sauce bar and enjoy an array of incredible flavors. I have developed a forceful liking to the green chutney-like sauce...I am South Asian so the taste was fairly nostalgic. As soon as we received our burgers all conversation was out the door. The only improvement needed was the burger patty, but what do you expect for $5...kobe beef? pfffft get out of hea! Just try not to get into a drag race afterwards...number 1 it's illegal and 2 if you have a bumpy ride you might not find a restroom in time...I say this because you will be stuffed from possibly ordering a second burger, not because their food gives you diarrhea (it doesn't and it didn't...tmi?...I don't care).\\n\\nDo not question the chicken...it is just as delicioso."},{"name":"Earls Kitchen + Bar","address":"905 Hornby Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I usually drop in to the Earls on Robson between Thurlow and Bute.

Great space, very open and airy.\\nWe sat in the lounge and waited a little long for someone to approach us for a drink order. A manager actually stepped in and got the drinks punched in before our waitress could get to us, but she was busy settling 3 tables at once. I had the chicken and Brie sandwich with fig jam and my friend had their Sicilian Pizza. The food was average, although I couldn't help but think that Earls has really upped their prices a little too much for the fairly casual dining establishment that it is. $24 for a chicken pasta? $32 for a fish entree? Really? Their prices on wine are pretty lofty as well for the caliber of wine they are pouring. In general I feel that Earls is charging about 25% too much on just about everything. \\n\\nThey are also very directly and very apparently competing with the Cactus Club as some of the items on the menu are straight up knock offs of Cactus Club standard items like the Cajun cheddar chicken sandwich and the Parmesan crusted rocket salad which is a Rob Feenie item at the Club.\\nOn the positive side, they bake their own pizza dough every morning and use it for the pizzas and for their Naan that accompanies their chicken curry dish (which is kind of awesome, but a tad spicy for those without the constitution for a little heat).  \\nIn summary - too pricey for what you get and trying too hard to be something they are not."},{"name":"Au Comptoir","address":"2278 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The food is good but the waiter that I had was arrogant.

When you walk into Santorini Cafe, the environment is very charming. The walls are decorated with photos of Greece I'm guessing, and the place is relatively bright. It has a nice vibe. The woman behind the counter was extremely friendly and warm and made us feel very comfortable. In general, I really enjoyed the ambiance of how it felt like we were walking into her home and she was welcoming us. I like how the menu wasn't loaded with different options because it means that they focus and care about the food that they serve. We ordered lamb gyro wraps, meatball wraps, lamb and feta fries, and pita with hummus. The gyro wraps had a creamy sauce accompanied with fresh lettuce and tomatoes that had a slightly vinegary dressing. The meat itself was delicious as it had a nice bite to it, but it was still very smooth and tender. The flavor blended extremely well with the sauce and veggies as nothing was overpowering. As for the sides, the fries were pretty normal but had a great crisp to them. The feta tasted fresh and the topping of lamb tasted excellent just like the gyro wraps. I guess one minor complaint stems from the long slices of lamb on the fries. I would've preferred smaller pieces but it's not too big a deal. Finally, I don't know what they put into the pita and hummus but it was absolutely addicting. The pita came in slices and had a slightly crisp exterior but a soft and airy interior. The hummus itself was amazing. It had a perfect blend of flavors with a texture that gave a very rustic feel. Unlike other restaurants that serve hummus, the hummus here was plated with care. To top it all of, our cashier gave us beignets on the house! The beignets was quite crispy on the outside while airy on the inside. Flavored with honey and cinnamon, the beignets were not overly sweet and had a nice subtle sour after taste. Overall, Santorini Cafe took my friends and me and sent us on an adventure to Greece with fresh flavors and a charming atmosphere."},{"name":"Karl's Sausage Kitchen & European Market","address":"1 Bourbon St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4.5","text":"Drove by this place for 30 years and never checked it out.

The waiter informed me that the recipe had been changed. It was tolerable so I ate about half of it and decided to take the remainder home for leftovers. When I prepared it to reheat the next day, I found that the cut of meat was terrible, loaded with gristle and fat. Most of it was a waste. I warmed it took another taste and threw it away. My wife tasted the pork and did not like it either. The pork just had a weird unappetizing taste. I also found the creamed greens, not to my liking. However, my wife really enjoyed the snapper.

Would definitely order from here again"},{"name":"Henri's Bakery & Caf√©","address":"56 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Even though it's a bakery, I've always come here for lunch. And always for the same thing: a chicken salad sandwich on a croissant with provolone, tomato and lettuce. Usually I'll also pick up a bag of Zapp's chips and a Dr. Brown's black cherry soda, mostly because it's one of the few places where you can.\\n\\nNow Henri's does have other sandwiches--and several sound good--but the chicken salad has never let me down. Thus, it's the only one I've ever ordered. And at $7.30 for the way I build it, it's a little pricey, but worth every penny. I love how it's just a good, no-frills chicken salad. There are no nuts, no grapes and, most importantly, no dark meat. It tastes just like the chicken salad I ate growing up, which is probably why I like it so much. \\n\\nOf course, that's not the only way Henri's pushes my nostalgia button. It also reminds me of a bakery my Dad took my brother and I to as kids. It was about as old and had the same types of baked goods. I remember a good Sunday morning was Dad taking us to Wohlleb's, where we could grab some pastries and a carton of chocolate milk.\\n\\nWhile I don't hit Henri's for breakfast much, I will say I've enjoyed the fritters I've gotten here over the years. And I'm a sucker for their gingerbread men. Again, like with the chicken salad, Henri's makes them just the way I had them as a child. Theirs are very soft, have a strong ginger flavor and are dotted with raisins. I hate those hard, break-a-tooth gingerbread men and I was so glad to not find those here. \\n\\nReally, if you're looking for a sandwich or something sweet in Buckhead, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better place. Be warned though that Henri's gets packed at lunch and will run out of things quickly. Also, during the colder months, there's really no place to sit (unless you're lucky enough to grab one of the few tables in the adjacent coffeehouse). During the warmer months, however, there is a large patio with plenty of seating. \\n\\nOh, one more thing: Henri's is old school. If for some reason you're expecting some haute bakery like Joli Kobe, this isn't it. But if you don't mind lunching with some ladies who lunch, give Henri's a try. Honestly, I can't even say that it's retro, because that would imply they're trying to be that way. I just think part of Henri's charm--from the building to the food to the clientele--is that it's remained virtually unchanged over the years. And to me, there's something appealing about that."},{"name":"Coven","address":"281 Essex St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"A great cafe in the middle of salem,ma..."},{"name":"La Boite Caf√©","address":"1700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My roommate is doing a class project on Austin trailers.

I only had my credit card, and La Boite had a $5 credit limit. Shucks, it looks like I HAVE to get that almond croissant!\\n\\nBefore I attended to the croissant that was awaiting me, I took a sip of Lala's Lavender Lemonade. Lala knows what she's doin'! The lemonade was cool, refreshing, citrusy, and really concentrated. None of that watered down stuff you get sometimes. I couldn't really taste the lavender all too much, but the lemonade was still delicious. There's definitely more too it than just water, white sugar, and lemons. I'm not too sure about what they put in it, but it seems like they put in different types of citrus other than lemons and use honey or something... eh, who cares? It's delicious!\\n\\nThen, my attention was entirely focused on the croissant. YUMMM. Any good croissant doesn't skimp on the butter, and this one certainly had it's fair share. Crisp on the bottom.

(Meat, seafood, vegetables, etc) Love the spicy broth and the dipping sauce. Other broths are kind of bland to me. The quality of the food does not seem to be the greatest either. For example, the prime ribs meat that they use tend to have a lot of fat in it. And seafood is not fresh by any means. I've had hot pot at other places and the food quality is, hands down, waaaay better. I guess it's similar to any other buffet; buffet food is usually not up to par with regular restaurants where quality of the food is actually appreciated.

But I take my yelp reviews seriously and it's important that I provide information, even when it's not so great. \\n\\nThat being said, here goes. I visited with family on 7/22 - their first time here. I raved about how great this place was and how much I loved the wine and blah blah. Their first impression? We walked in and a different person that I'd seen there before (maybe the owner? Middle aged guy, not sure) was counting money at the register and said \\"Sit wherever. It's gonna be a while.\\" \\n\\n...........................\\n\\nOkay, then. Not off to the best start. There are many other ways he could've conveyed that it would been a hot second before he could get to us but that wasn't it. We sat outside and waited. And waited. 20 mins later we were brought menus and he apologized saying that they had a billion people come in at once that they weren't expecting. Okay, but still. He crossed off what felt like the entire menu, stating they were out of stock, and left to let us look over the menu. Another 20 mins later, a younger girl returned to take our order. She did mention she was in training, so I'll give her that, but she wasn't totally knowledgeable about everything and had to run back inside to ask questions, so that made the time take even longer. 15 mins after that we received our wine. We were basically there an hour before we were even served WINE. Something you just pour into a glass. The worst part is even though he said they were busy, or had been busy, or whatever, there was hardly any one there when we were seated. \\n\\nThe wines, thank goodness, were still good. But I was so turned off from the customer service that I just didn't want to be there anymore. I guess I just have really high expectations for that and I totally get being overwhelmed and surprised with customers but you've got to remember that we came to your establishment to give you money for goods and would just really appreciate if you could treat us a little better. \\n\\nI hope whenever I decide to return that that experience is positive again."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow!!!

I used to live really closeby, so I'm kicking myself for never going in there before. If I had come here back when I used to live nearby, I would have been in that restaurant DAILY lol. Anyway, the yelp reviews made me a bit nervous, Chinese restaurants do their food differently and despite being Chinese, I still get treated horribly at Chinese restaurants. Cathay Pacific was a great surprise hit for me all around. All of the staff were beyond courteous and friendly (SO rare in Chinese restaurants!), even the ones at the cashier thing were really nice, there was another staff just standing around and he was very courteous too lol, he saw we were leaving so he quickly moved out of the walkway and politely said goodbye and to have a great night. So any bad service yelpers disliked in the past, I don't know if it's true anymore so maybe give Cathay Pacific another try? Also, there is a slight issue of the minimum charge requirement or whatever (it's explained in the menu), but really, it's not difficult to end up doing more than the requirement so it's almost insignificant (I don't know if they even enforce it or if it's valid still). Anyway, it was nice to have a water constantly refilled, the bread they give was good too, and the general decor was a bit cheesy but had some visually appealing bits to it. I do wish the table was bigger though. The pupu platter alone really made space difficult for 4 place settings (plus 3 other dishes!), so  a bigger table with a lazy susan in the middle would've really helped us! I ordered a shirley temple, it was yum and very decorated lol so I'd love to get this each time. \\n\\nThe food we got:\\n1. peking raviolis (btw, I LOVE this version of peking raviolis where they're doughy and stuff, so rare that a restaurant does it this way!)\\n2. pupu platter (also good)\\n3. shrimp fried rice (we should've gotten the pork fried rice, the rice was dark brown and tasted better when I put the pupu platter pork with it lol, the shrimp was pretty bland and ended up being insignificant in this dish when it's supposed to be the star. It doesn't help I'm  used to a very different version at other restaurants)\\n4. chicken lo mein (close enough to what I'm used to so it was fine). \\n\\nOther yelpers aren't lying, the portions are big lol so despite being a party of 4, we definitely had a lot of leftovers. The waitress was really so great, she was very attentive to the drinks, she constantly made sure we were satisfied with the food, and she was quick and efficient with everything she did, as well as giving us extra of anything she could. Another nice bonus is she was really sweet to my brother who is special needs. Even though she couldn't understand him, she was very nice to him once I translated what he said and she talked directly to him instead of to me, so that was a rare bonus in her humanity we don't experience often.\\n\\nOverall, I have been wanting to go back ever since, it's only been a few days lol. I was so thrilled when I saw the peking raviolis were the doughy version I love so much lol. Sure the food as a whole may be very Americanized or whatever, but it all tastes good (minus the shrimp fried rice in my case lol) but I'm still eager and willing to try my other fave dishes and hopefully they're done the way I love. At the very least, I know that going to  Cathay Pacific, I'll end up with my peking raviolis, a yum Shirley Temple, and great service."},{"name":"Blue Basil Thai Cuisine","address":"3801 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I don't speak Thai and can't remember the name of my entree, but it was really good.

We found this odd as we had made an Opentable reservation and had no issues with it as they advertise the reservations on their website.\\n\\nAgain, we sat outside in an extremely sunny seat by the street. The ambiance on the porch is really nice with a casual vibe that is truly inviting. Inside the restaurant is more classic Boylston restaurant/bar esque with traditional bar seating. \\n\\nThe food at Dillon's is pretty good. They have a decent amount of options; however for my vegan friend she had trouble finding a lot of options outside the salads. She actually did end up ordering the Strawberry avocado salad which came in a large portion and was extremely tasty! I got the heuvos rancheros sandwich, which was, surprisingly, vegetarian. It was ok; the bread was really too much given there was very little guac or pico on the actual sandwich. Also, the egg was served over hard which kind of killed my brunch mood as the option wasn't even given to have the yolk runny. The tator tots though are killer, they were definitely the best part of the meal. Also, just a word of advice, they don't have iced coffee so if you are gonna sit outside make sure to get a cold drink too.\\n\\nIn addition to the kind of \\"just ok\\" food, the service was reaaallyyy slow. There were probably only 15 other people in the restaurant for the hour and a half we were there and we waited over half an hour for our food.

We got the last table and it was good to see this place cranking out the business early in the week. Our overall experience with the food and drink was a mixed bag being either disappointing or excellent. First, we ordered some Cadillac margaritas. When we tried them, we both looked at each other in wonderment. \\"We did ask for Cadillac, right?\\" They tasted like mixer with a hint of lime....nothing else. Worst margaritas we've had sadly. Then they delivered some chips and salsa which brightened things up. Both were fantastic....maybe the best salsa I've had. Next were two apps, Queso Funido and Shrimp Ceviche. The former was fantastic but the latter had virtually zero flavor. Last we had the Street taco flight. The host delivered these and walked away. What I didn't like was there was no explanation of which was what? When I order a flight of anything, it usually comes with a card or the server explains each. That said, they were all very good. I'd probably order some of the full size if I only knew what they were. Lastly, the service was very utilitarian. She took our order and delivered most of it. No small talk or suggestions. Too bad because I think the restaurant has more to offer than what we experienced. So, with all the choices we have in Portland for great food, I'm just okay with the Matador.

We felt really uncomfortable. \\nThe food was delicious.\\nWe received the check, paid with a credit card (after the $40 coupon) and as the bill returned we saw that 20% service was added, without it being in the original bill and without letting us know. Thinking it may be related merely to the size of our party we looked at the menu, but the rule they had was for party of 6 or more.\\nI asked for the manager and told her I think there has been a mistake. She answered in a very unpleasant way that this is how the system is set up. If you use the coupon it adds 20% tip and there is nothing she can do. Either cancel the coupon or pay the tip. I asked her to bring the coupon, and we read together the note saying \\"Tax and gratuity not included; tip on the full value of the meal, not the voucher price (average tip is 20% of the original value).\\" There was nothing about automatic tipping. \\nWe tried to understand, how and why should money be charged with no apparent reason. She was extremely rude and literally walked away from me as I was explaining our surprise. \\nIn the end I asked her to cancel the credit charge, and we paid in cash and left no tip.\\nShe had the audacity to come to the table and ask us to wait while she counted the money in front of us!

I've experienced better\\" - and that's exactly how I feel about this place. For a girl who loves coffee shops & cute, independent stores, I'm totally unimpressed by this place, and I can tell you exactly why:\\n\\n\\n1. Speed of Service:\\nHOLY heck is this place slow! Since I work close by, it's convenient to come ... but I regret it every time when I'm twenty minutes in, and still food- and coffee-less. In fact, my team - which has been around here for years - has stopped going in the past few months, because they really just didn't have the time to wait around.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. The Stock - or Lack Thereof:\\nMore often than not, the real culprit behind the speed isn't the person making the food or coffee, but the fact that they don't have the things they need. Even though it's 3pm in the afternoon - aka that time when everyone starts to fall asleep at their desks - they'll be out of coffee, and have to brew a fresh batch. It's worse with food; here's my experience from yesterday:\\n\\nI wanted a chicken caesar salad for a quick lunch. Hardly complicated - but literally fifteen minutes after my colleague and I had ordered and paid (she got the same thing), we are informed that the store doesn't have any romaine lettuce.\\n\\nNo ... lettuce? in a place ... that sells all variety of salads?!\\n\\n(Why do I always seem to have problems with lettuce, in the bizzarest of situations?! Seriously.)\\n\\nThanks to that hiccup, my \\"quick lunch\\" takes 30 minutes just to procure (sigh)\\n\\n\\n3. Price/Quality Ratio\\nI'm not saying that every place has to have stellar service or always be on top of their game. But if you're not going to be top-notch, don't charge me accordingly. Mohr & McPherson Cafe is, from what I can tell, the most expensive cafe in this neighborhood ... and not only is the service slow, but the portions are small, its baked goods are often dry/stale-tasting ... not really a bargain.\\n\\n\\nBottom Line: If you're nearby and too lazy to walk elsewhere (and also need to kill some time), then this place may be what you're looking for ... but if you're just a normal person who has a job to get back to, this detour may prove to be too costly (in all senses of the word)."},{"name":"Main Event - Atlanta","address":"3101 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 104","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I just want to ask..

The least expensive dumpling choice we got cost $7.50, and you only get 6 small dumplings. For this price, you would expect each bite to be delicious and worthwhile. It's not. We tried the Taipei Ravioli, Dumpling Room dumplings, and Soupy dumplings. Taipei Raviolis had the least amount of meat and tasted just like the Soupy dumplings. The small difference was the shape and that the raviolis were more pan fried. Should have read the other reviews before buying the Soupy dumplings... just not soupy at all! Not even a little juice when you bite into one. Name change required immediately. The only redeeming quality of the Dumpling Room dumplings was that each one had a small shrimp inside. The waitresses seemed frazzled and uneducated about the menu items. One waitress had to look at the sign on the wall to tell us what was the special dumpling of the day. Water cups looked dirty and they tried to sell us one bowl of dipping sauce per dumpling order for $1 each. We opted to just try 1 sauce with 1 order of dumplings. Turns out the amount they pour you was more than enough to use for the 18 dumplings we ate. We felt like the sauce offered more flavor than the dumplings themselves. The chef came out to the dining room multiple times.

I've had home cooked meals in people's houses that were better than this place. My first issue, how does 3 chicken legs w/3 sides come to $19 at 12Noon??? Like really! If their food was delicious I don't believe in putting a price on it but for a lunch consisting of small childlike portions, the food wasn't worth the $. I ordered fried chicken with mac&cheese,collard greens,and candy yams. When my order came out I knew something was wrong when I wasn't shown my food before it was being placed in the bag. So I went out to the car and immediately I saw the mac sitting in a pool like amount of oil. Where did these ppl learn to cook?? I have simple rules if you can't cut it with the mac and fried nothing else is worth trying. I simply walked back into the restaurant and asked them to change my mac because it's running. The waitress did it w/no problem. So I got rice w/gravy instead. So I when back to the car and started to sample the food. The collard greens sucked, I don't if it's because they used turkey instead of pork but they were blan. The rice w/gravy was decent and so were the yams. The chicken looked good at sight but once you bit into it, any decent cook could tell the chicken wasn't cleaned properly. The cornbread wasn't edible. Honestly GA isn't know for the best country food but I would have believed the food was going to be decent.

Lucky us! \\nThe menu appeared promising. We ordered:\\n- a salad (had avocado, pickled beets, radishes, lettuce, etc). It was good, but too salty.\\n- the bone marrow risotto (green risotto, bone marrow foam). It was ok, but something was off. There was not enough of the bone marrow rich fattiness and the foam seemed to be more for visual effect. It was again, too salty. \\n- whiskey & rye papardelle pasta with cherry meatballs (came HIGHLY recommended). But again, it just fell short. The pasta was too dense and heavy. The sauce had whiskey and rye beer cooked into it, but it seemed like the alcohol wasn't cooked off enough. It tasted sharp and sour, and not in a good way. It almost brought out a tinny or metal flavor in the tomatoes. It was quite disappointing. \\n- venison 3-ways was good and bad. The 1st way was sausage (they give you a half of a half of a sausage) and it was SO SO SO dry and kind of flavorless. It was barely warm. The 2nd way was blackened and seared to a medium rare, although it was more on the rare side, but I didn't mind. Beautifully seasoned and wonderfully cooked to a tender goodness. Lastly, it was the braised venison, which seemed to be an afterthought. I actually thought it was just a blackened brussel sprout, which means it would not have been missed as it was barely noticed. There were 2 little pieces; and it was nothing memorable. There was a puree with some brussel sprouts and cauliflower and mushrooms. It was all just OK. \\nOverall, really cool looking spot with photo framed ceiling and awesome d√©cor. There was a great selection of beverages, but we weren't in the mood for it that evening, so I can't speak to how good their drinks are, but the food was just always missing the mark. $95 for dinner for 2; no dessert and no drinks.

Obviously they could not stay in business if that was typical.    \\nFOOD: \\nYeah, it's house baked pie. Of course it's good. How could it not be? But it's not great. Just better than what you'd get at the bakery case at Freddy's or Safeway. \\nPecan pie is a gloppy brown-sugary mess, but still better than most junk pecan pies that look like they're just thickened corn syrup and color, with some pecans on top. Pairs really well with coffee (it's usually been my experience that pecan pie doesn't).

Provolone, roasted red peppers, basil, egg, on Pearl ciabatta. Fantastic. Clean, simple, classic, and yet unusual. Wish it had been a bit moister though. A tomato slice or some aioli or something would be an improvement. \\nThey offer muffins, and I think I saw a quiche, but not the array of baked goods you might expect. Better be in the mood for pie when you come here, if you're looking for something sweet.  \\nPRESENTATION:\\nPlate. No paper-lined plastic basket here. Thank you, RO, for respecting my dignity.  \\nPRICE/VALUE:\\nKinda steep, but pie seems to be that way. I hear people gripe about Loretta Jean's too. \\nOVERALL:\\nThe main reason I don't come here frequently is because I'm just not that into pie. I know, weird.

It is not the most fancy/clean/organized restaurant, but if you can get past all that, you just might enjoy your dining experience here. \\n\\nThere are three main tips that I think you will find extremely helpful.\\n\\n1. Broth - For the base broth, I highly recommend doing the split between house special and their spicy broth. The reason why I find this combination the most efficient is because you can get the best of both worlds by getting that deep herbal taste from the house special broth AND the hint of spiciness from the spicy broth. \\n\\n2. Stay with meat and avoid seafood - I highly recommend staying away from their seafood selections. Every time I ordered their seafood options, they were not fresh at all. It was very concerning. However, they do have pretty good quality of meat so I would stay with their meat selections. Beef, pork, and lamb. They are all pretty good!\\n\\n3. Avoid dinner. Go during lunch time - I had an unexpected snow day off from work so I was able to go here during lunch hours which I find it to be a much better deal than dinner. Its about $16 per person and the menu isn't that limited compared to their dinner menu. I would avoid going here for dinner because you can pretty much get everything you want at a much less price during lunch hours.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, do house special/spicy broth combination, order only from their meat selections, and go for lunch, not dinner."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Orlando","address":"8963 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place and great atmosphere.

I always forget that this place is here.  Most people not in the know don't even know it exists.  That was the case with the group I was with.  \\n\\nSue and some of our friends were out celebrating a birthday and after sushi we wanted to get some dessert.  We were trying and trying to figure out a place on Division as that is where we were and Division is a mecca of eating establishments these days.  We came up with the usual suspects, but the birthday girl wasn't feeling any of them.  After a quick Yelp (you saved the day again) search, Rimsky-Korsakoffee came up and I said a hearty \\"yes\\" to that one.  I sold it to the birthday girl and all of us headed over.\\n\\nIt was very busy on a Sunday evening.  The place is not large.  Set in what looks to be a former house, you walk in the door, grab a menu and take a seat.  There is a piano in the main room and there was a gentleman playing.  It brought some class to the joint.\\n\\nThe dessert menu (I think that is all they have here) is dominated by ice cream type dishes.  Things like brownie sundaes and banana splits.  They have carrot cake, cheesecake and other things on special.  You can also get coffee drinks, hot cocoa or hot cider.  Everything one would need to satisfy their sweet tooth.\\n\\nI went with the Raspberry Fool ($5.75) as that is apparently the dessert they are known for.  On the menu it says they run out early so I didn't expect they would have it on the night we were there as we got in the door a bit late.  I was happy to find out that they did.  There are raspberries involved (in this and a few of their other desserts).  There is pot de creme involved.  There are more raspberries.  There is cream.  There is heaven.  I am glad I tried it first.  It was very good, but next time I think I'll try my luck with one of the ice cream dishes.  Sue had the brownie sundae and she enjoyed it, but it was a bit on the big side for her.\\n\\nThey are cash only.

I'm not a wine drinker so I ordered a whiskey sour which was, delightful not too strong as in some and not all syrup either.\\n\\nAs for the food to come, let me just say you're in for a treat. \\nThe garlic bread is Fantastic, and they will keep bringing it out.\\nWe all started with salads, the waiter suggested the caesar as he should have because it was great, a little on the smaller side, but the dressing was made from scratch and tasted lovely.\\n\\nI ordered the Chicken Francese with a side of Raviolini, Pomodoro. It was heavenly, the chicken was so tender and the sauce was something to write home about, Not too buttery as you get with some places. The Raviolini was stuffed with Goat Cheese, dill, and fresh herbs and tossed with a fresh tomato basil sauce with artichokes, Oh it was good.\\n\\nMy boyfriend got the Shrimp Fettuccine with mushrooms, the cream sauce that came with it was like something sent down from the heavens. it was not thick and heavy, and was an explosion of flavor with the shrimp and mushrooms, I will probably order it next time.\\n\\nMy friend, got the spaghetti, which was a huge pile of pasta covered with meat sauce, which was packed full. But Dustin is a big guy and he ate every bit of it. Said it was wonderful.\\nHis girlfriend got the Tortellini, with spinach and cheese. And holy mackerel it was tasty, I love me some tortellini and this was like nothing I had here-to-for experienced, It was so tender and the cheese was so fresh, the tomato sauce had such a wonderful creamy flavor, so Scrumptious I asked her for a second taste.\\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the Tiramisu and the ricotta cheesecake for the table. \\nthe tiramisu was so light and fluffy  but lacked the coffee flavor you typically look for, more cocoa and marscapone than anything else.  The cheesecake stole the show. with the interesting texture and the flavor of the liqueur combined with the surprising bits of chocolate chips it was sinful but not heavy like most cheesecake.\\n(Now if you're a traditional cheese cake lover this is not for you. Riccotta has an entirely differently texture and taste, therefore it doesn't cream the way you expect cheesecake to be,nor is it as sweet.) \\n\\n\\nOur water glasses never ceased to be full, and the staff was quite attentive.\\n All in all it was a fantastic experienced that we wish to have again and again.\\n\\nThe last few notes are just some critiques on pricing and service.\\nOur waiter was lovely but was very sneaky, he never once  told us that anything was extra, he made it sound as if the salads came with the meal and that the pasta sides were not extra. Make no mistake nothing here is free and they will add-on for everything. \\n(and as lovely as the salad was, It was not worth the price.) \\nthings got a little weird after he brought the bill because he insisted that we tip him in cash, unfortunately our side didn't bring any, he didn't seem too pleased. Said it was \\"better for him\\" as if the boss man skimmed off the top.\\nAwkward.\\n\\nAlfredos is a true Italian joint with great food and excellent atmosphere. a little pricey, but if you don't mind spending, then you are in for a treat."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"We ate here last weekend to celebrate our 2 year anniversary while on vacation in Orlando.

We first ordered drinks, I got the gin and jam which is one of my favorite gin drinks I've ever had and my husband got an old fashioned which was strong and delicious. We started with the bread board and steak tartare. The bread board was good, not amazing. The steak tartare came on a blue cheese tart...AMAZING! For our main entree I got the lamb leg and my husband got the pork porterhouse. While both entrees were delicious, we both agreed that mine was on another level. The lamb was cooked sous vide style which automatically makes it more intriguing to me, but the flavors and texture were also incredible. We finished the evening with the pig tails and they gave us a complementary dessert which tasted similar to a lemon bar, which you can never go wrong with.

Their service has always been lacking with a very disorganized staff. There is no assigned server and no one really knows or cares if you've been taken care of because  they are busy or chatting.  You often get forgotten  or ignored and you really have to advocate for yourself to get someone to come place your order. Just don't get discouraged. Going to Asian restaurants all my life i will have to say service is a very low priority here.  So if you want to eat here just be prepared  to ask for the menu and check on why certain dishes haven't come because most likely it was forgotten. I saw a confused table that was waiting for 15to 20mins without menus and another politely waiting for a server to come get their order. You kind of just have to get their attention  or you  wont get service after they seat you. The congee at this place have been of good flavor and quality and their fried wontons are a must try.  This place opens  late but i would suggest you skip  the Chinese donuts and the rice roll with the donut inside when you  go in the evening because  they are not fresh.  The server told me  it  was made in the  morning but it was cold, dry and stiff like it was from the previous day. He offered to take  it off our bill and we ordered  a beef rice roll but that never came and we just cancelled it when we paid our bill. They serve a daily Chinese soup for $3 a bowl and i like to get that when i miss my moms cooking.

On this date we went because a friend suggested we go there.  It is pretty consistent and hasn't changed much over the years.  \\n\\nFirst, the good.  We were there on a Friday late afternoon/early evening and it was not crowded so we were seated immediately and this has usually been the case over the years.  The chips and salsa are good and fresh.  My wife and I both had the Old El Paso Enchiladas (cheese) and my daughter had the Shrimp Enchiladas; we found all of it okay but nothing to rave about. The El Paso Enchilada plate came with beans, rice and a shell full of Pico De Gallo.   They do have some interesting menu choices which I would like to return and try.  The waiter was friendly and pretty attentive.\\n\\nNow the bad.  This started from the time we received our menus which were disgusting.  Three menus and we probably could have made our food choices from the dried food or whatever it was that all over the menus, all three of them.  Note to owners, when the host/hostess isn't doing anything else have them clean the menus, please have someone clean the menus.  We ordered the bean and cheese nachos for appetizers and got five nachos.  Five, really how did you pick that number? just to make them a dollar each?  The nachos are large tortilla chips but only one of them was fully covered with cheese and the beans were in hiding cause we had to look for them.  My cheese enchilada was a typical tortilla with internal cheese, covered with sauce and more cheese.  The cheese filling was pretty sparse and the tortilla was a flour tortilla that was not fully covered in sauce.  The tortilla was difficult to cut with a fork and the end that was not covered with sauce was crisp, as in cracked when I put the fork to it.  \\n\\nThe beans and rice were standard stuff and didn't add or take away from the meal.

I ordered a Blue Agave Margarita and it was tasty I love Apple Bees reasonably priced drinks and they are always well made. We arrived 30 minutes before the half off appetizer menu started so I opted to get the trio appetizer which included better items than the half off menu.  I had the Spicy Chicken Wonton tacos, Sarachi shrimp, and a side house salad. The Spicy Chicken Wonton aren't spicy at all but they are very tasty.

The woman who answered the phone was nice and polite, however she was unable to offer me a reservation before 8 pm (I was hoping for 6:30 due to time constraints...no, I am not on the prune juice...yet.). So I took it and hoped for the best.\\n\\nScuba Steve and I met our other party there at 6:45 pm on the nose - the place is actually really easy to find and has GREAT curb appeal - if you are into dining al fresco I would recommend their little sidewalk patio (although not in the middle of August). \\n\\nWe told them we were going to have some drinks, but they offered to seat us right away instead - SCORE...WINNING (sorry, had to, couldn't help it...trying to be \\"current\\"). \\n\\nThe dining room and bar are parallel to one another with a wall separating the two. Ambiance is great, and lots of room between tables, so no claustrophobia there. Our server, Katie, was extremely knowledgable and friendly and gave us the rundown on the menu and was very helpful with suggestions.\\n\\nNow on to the meat of the story - no pun intended. The MENU. Wine: awesome. Had the Momo Sauv Blanc and LOVED IT. Scuba Steve had beer and was quite a fan ( I think he had 2-3 of them). \\n\\nWe started with the suckling pig and scallops (OMG, I DIE), the pretzels, and the gruyere biscuits. I think the menu is very forward southern-style cooking...if Chez Panisse and your favorite southern dive had a baby, this would be it. Menu and restaurant are upscale but casual and comfy at the same time. \\n\\nAnyway, I digress. Biscuits were perfect - pretzel was a nice hybrid between what you would get at a baseball game and what you would buy in a bag at the grocery store...not too soft and doughy, but not too hard either. Served with grainy mustard and a cheese sauce. And the only complaint we had about the suckling pig and scallops? THAT THERE WASN\\"T MORE OF IT! :) But finer dining always has more controlled portions, which I look at as an opportunity to fill up less so I can try more!\\n\\nMy entree was the halibut (latke and lima beans rounded out the veggie portion) and Scuba Steve got the duck with lentils. Oh did he ever get it - it was AMAZING! Apparently the way they raise these particular quackers creates more flavor in the meat, and they weren't lying! The rest of our party got the steak frites and pork porterhouse (it's HUGE! And perfectly JUICY - not one dry morsel...how did they do that?!?!) respectively, which were equally impressive. \\n\\nFor dessert (I know, we ate a ton - thank goodness my skirt had a little give or things could have gotten downright indecent!) we had the strawberry/rhubarb/praline crisp. Divine. \\n\\nI can't say enough wonderful things - service, food, ambiance, our entire experience was incredible. I have to say I was surprised to find such a gem in Orlando, FL of all places, but I wish them all the best and the next time I am in the 'hood I will hit them up for another shot of DELICIOUS!"},{"name":"Jac's Cafe","address":"29 Crest Ave","city":"Winthrop","stars":"4.5","text":"BEST BREAKFAST PLACE!

The menu slightly changes daily and also monthly, the menu get revamped.  There are a few signature items, like the Lobster Tacos, that they keep on there basically because all of Winter Park would be very upset if they took them off...haha.  The salads are out of this world.  The Farmer salad is particularly good.  It's like a cob salad with thick chunks of bacon, a light caesar dressing and a boiled egg on top.  When you break apart the egg and liquid yolk gets spread throughout the salad, it's amazing!  The entrees are very good.  The meat dishes are all quite extravagant and taste delicious.  The lamb leg I had in April was incredible.  The pasta dishes have also been very well prepared.  The desserts are pretty amazing.  When you go, don't leave without getting a dessert.\\n\\nThe drinks:  The beers consist only of microbrews which change out regularly as well.  Each beer is usually served as at pint.  The only liquor drink I've had is the Bacon Infused Old Fashioned.  It's exactly what it sounds like.  Was very good.  It is their signature drink.\\n\\nThe atmosphere:  The bar area is pretty neat.  It's not huge but there's seats available at a long bar while there's also a few tables and booths set up in that area.  First come, First serve in this area...be ready to pounce!  The dining room is nice.  Any seat in here pretty much requires at least 1 week ahead of time reservation for a decent hour.\\n\\nThe price:  Yikes!  Every time I end up coming to this place, I spend roughly $140 for two of us.  We tried to go and keep it cheap by getting a burger and we still spent like $120.  To split a $12 salad, they charged me $2 more dollars.\\nBeer: $7 each\\nLiquor Drinks: $12 each\\nAppetizers: approx. $10\\nSalad: approx. $12\\nEntree: approx $25\\nDessert: $7 each\\n\\nI love everything about this place except for the price.

Its by no means a culinary masterpiece but they work hard until WAY late into the night making their food. Admittedly, some of the more complicated dishes arent always spot on - but you need to realize what your getting: youre ordering from a place at 2am. If you order a crazy complicated dish at 2am (when you're incredibly drunk) and complain that its not exactly what you expected, then youre misguided at best. Everytime I order from them, theyre kind, courteous, and speedy as hell. They kick people out after one because people after one are drunk and most likely loud. If they kick you out after 1 and youre not being loud - thats not the point. Its one in the morning and they dont want people drunk as hell eating in their restaurant.

With the help of Yelp, we decided to go to \\"Bonnie Lee's Fried Chicken.\\" When we arrived, we found that they had closed not twenty minutes before. We were sad, but it turned out alright because that's when we found the unassuming \\"A Touch of Basil,\\" tucked away in the strip mall right behind Bonnie Lee's. It's not the most beautiful restaurant: there are those awful red and white checkered tablecloths that, I believe, are mailed monthly to every Italian restaurant in America; the kitchen takes up almost the entire floorspace of the unit; and I picked up a tan while walking past the blazing neon signage of the grungy Chinese place next door. I wasn't expecting much. We ordered a whole Sicilian pizza and an order of garlic bread. Quickly, though, we found out why the kitchen was right there in the middle of everything: the guys make everything fresh, right in front of you and right after you order it. When I ordered the garlic bread, I was expecting something resembling those frozen Texas Toast things to come out in a red, plastic basket. I was wrong. The garlic bread (which cost about $1.25) turned out to be a whole load of French bread cut in half, doused in hot garlic butter, parsley, and Parmesan cheese. It came with marinara sauce and it was fantastic. I watched the guy pull our giant pizza out of the oven: it was a hot, bread-y rectangle of browned cheesy goodness. The crust was a little too brown, so I was very afraid that we had ordered the kind of Sicilian pizza that is so crunchy that it cuts one's mouth all up -- worst feeling in the world, if you wondered. Again, I was wrong. It was cooked perfectly: simultaneously soft, chewy, and crunchy. The pizza cost $11.00. With the sodas, I payed about $17.50. A pizza half the size of the one I got here would have cost me more than that at Pizza Hut. \\n\\nI was disappointed when I saw that this place had no review on Yelp. Well, now it does.

Noodle-ism is owned by the owners of Bistro 88, which is one of my favorite restaurants, so I was expecting it to be fantastic.  I don't remember what I ordered the first few times I was here, but none of the things I ordered rose to the level of fantastic.  They were just mediocre...so much so that I didn't go back for over a year, even though I work downtown.\\n\\nSo I was a little apprehensive when two of my friends - who are both also Asian - suggested that we meet here for lunch.  I ordered the salmon, which was served with a pretty large pile of mixed greens tossed in a vinaigrette dressing that was quite good.  Both of my friends also gave their meals a thumbs-up - high praise coming from three foodies who are particularly picky about Asian food.\\n\\nIt's definitely a Westernized version of Asian food, but if you can look past that, it's still pretty tasty (at least, some of the items on the menu are).  I did have an issue with the service (the woman at the register answered a couple of questions I had about one item on the menu; after I finally ordered it, it took her several minutes to figure out that the item I had ordered was no longer available - not just on that day, but ever, according to her), and the prices are a bit on the high side for what you're getting - a quickish meal, counter service, and they don't even have napkin dispensers on the tables!  \\n\\nAnyway, it's basically a 3-1/2 star place in my book - I knocked it down to three stars since I was so totally unenthused on my first few trips there."},{"name":"Au Comptoir","address":"2278 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"- Loved my hamburger\\n- The pate was more like chopped duck than pate, which was good for me\\n- Good service\\n- Nice place to stop for lunch\\n- Liked the wine, although I'm partial to French wine"},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Heard about this restaurant from friends.

They have a big garden type area with tables and benches that you can wait in, so it wasn't terrible to do so. I think it's weird that you have to get your own water and coffee, though. I thought that it was one of those things where you can help yourself if you're waiting because it's just thoughtful to have beverages if you expect customers to wait for two hours for brunch, but not while we were already seated.\\n\\nSo we sit and, when our table asked for water, the server cheerfully informs us that we could get it ourselves and motions to the self-serve station. A couple of people in our group asked for ice, and she did bring that, but (and correct me if I am wrong) wouldn't it be as easy to fill the glass with water and ice if you're already getting the ice? It was a bit confusing.\\n\\nI had the grilled cheese with the blue cheese wasabi salad with hazelnuts. The salad was fantastic, but the grilled cheese was huge and a bit too rich for me (it's creamy artichokes plus cheese). My partner had the Salm I Am and said that it was decent, but nothing incredible. The best was the prickly pear lemonade, which was refreshing and delicious. I could drink gallons of the stuff. I initially ordered it because I didn't want to navigate the crowd to the self-serve water station and was very happy that I had made that lazy decision.\\n\\nWe were with friends with kids and they had a kid friendly menu and were very accommodating in regards to alterations to the dishes for food allergies, etc. One lady who was waiting lost her temper and was standing right by our table, so it made for a strange situation.

This review will summarize my two experiences in one.\\n\\nMy first time was a pretty nondescript Sunday. I was going there with some members of my fraternity, and, since it was kind of windy we'd really wanted a set of tables out of the shade. We'd gotten our wish somewhat, but it ended up being not so unpleasant. We did have to request stabilizing feet for our tables because they'd kept rocking on the uneven brick patio, but the ambience was friendly and mirthful.\\nOne could see the semi-salacious, pun-filled banners from our vantage, and the light campiness of the brunch menus was fun to see.\\n\\nI vacillated between some ahi tuna dishes they had and my general off-pescatarian diet, and ended up going with the spinach skillet: an egg and spinach dish they top with Swiss cheese. As a huge fan of carbs, I had to have their potatoes which came out pretty warm.\\n\\nThis first experience was nice.\\n\\nMy next one was a bit less so.\\n\\nThis next one was on Pride Sunday, which might have been a mistake. I'd gone with four friends and, though they'd just opened, they recommended we have a covered patio seat in order to get better service. We'd found a table, dragged another to make a larger one, and sat.\\n\\nDuring the next half an hour we'd sat initially, three servers passed by asking if someone had helped us, or that they'll take our order shortly. We ended up with a well-meaning server called Michael.\\n\\nHe'd explained the drinks, took our orders, and, 10 minutes later on the busiest-probably day of their season, we got our drinks. After nearly two hours being there, we'd finally gotten to order our food, with just enough time before the parade to wolf it down (I went with my spinach skillet again), requesting the bills at the same time we were eating. Despite our forward-thinking, we'd still gotten our bills after another 10 minutes.\\n\\nThankfully, we'd made the parade just in time. And that was partly because of the NCR virtual payment option.

Not only is this bad boy located in a great location (next to Bank of America, across from a great Roche Bros/CVS/Starbucks), the traffic here indicates how much the locals and college students love this joint.\\n\\nThe food is always fresh. You see them prepare it. They customize your every order just how you want it. They always ask the same questions (unless you are a regular then they \\"know\\" which is always great) to make sure they didn't leave anything out. The people that prepare the food have been there for years and are awesome.\\n\\nIn terms of traffic, try to avoid the lunch and dinner traffic because the line can back up all the way to the door. You'd think most people would leave but they don't. You can't leave when you know that 650 calorie burrito of deliciousness waiting for you (yeah, I love Mexican food). Besides the quality of food, low price, and excellent service, the thing that tops it off is the Cholula sauce.

I tried the chicken tikka masala, the chicken biryani along with several other dishes ( a pakora of some type, a sort of pancake with cheese, two spicy (not hot) chicken dishes).  The waiter brought me a mango lassi, my first.  I wish I could provide more detail, but I wasn't anticipating reviewing the place, so I didn't gather the information I should have.  Suffice to say, everything I tried was excellent.  I especially loved the the basket of naan which was so fresh it was still sizzling a little.  The service was very attentive and polite.  When I asked for the check I was actually encouraged to make another trip to the buffet - I hadn't eaten enough!  I was stuffed, else I would have.

If it's a bistro or cafe or restaurant or even at home.  It hasn't been bastardized like Japanese food has.  Nowhere will you find \\"all you can eat\\" unless you count French Fries.  And THAT doesn't count.  \\nFrench food is about the sauce and the perfection of the food in its preparations that go with the sauce.  Au Comptoir expands upon that in the very French tradition of style, flair, service and a tinge of arrogance that is flattering.  Should you find yourself in the whimsy of wanting to dine in the proper fashion.  I recommend French food a l'Au Comptoir.  Their food is tres mian mian.  Bonne appetite is fine, but mian mian was the exact phrase needed to describe tonight's meal. We were all satisfactorily filled with no room for desert.\\n\\nI had the halibut.  A decent portion of properly crusted boneless filet, smooth and silky butter sauce accompanied by asparagus, gnocchi and peas.  Worthy of a 4 star.  Maybe even better if I had wine with it.  You must have wine with French food.  Because the sauces need to be followed with a sip of opposing wine.  Like a yin and yang kind of thing.  Like oil and vinegar.  \\n\\nFor my starter I had the soup de jour which was a buttery and creamy green pea voullet, garnished with 4 croutons, a drizzle of olive oil and it was near perfection.  A bit salty, but that went well with my salad pairing.  Slightly bitter endive and nutty arugula and lettuce tossed in a dressing of wine vinegar and oil, emulsified with a nice mustard.  Everyone thought the salad was a masterpiece.  I understand why all the Yelpers post pics of their salads.  \\n\\nSteak tartar was glorious. 4.5 star worthy, maybe a bit more bread to spread it with. Again, near perfection that when complemented with wine became perfection.  \\n\\nNothing seemed amiss and everything was just perfect. I want to come back again.

I then told our original server to please just take away our plates as that we were now scared because of stones found and In my mom's salad and also because it made me think of how thorough the salad greens are being cleaned,  she said she had no clue what we were talking about and I told her to go ask the other server and the chef, because she claimed this sort have thing had never happened before. She asked if we wanted to order anything else or if we just wanted the bill at which point I said no thank you just the bill please. I saw her take our plates to the kitchen talk to the other server and the chef and then she came back with the bill and said sorry this happened  and handed us the bill. \\n\\nI fully understand that mistakes and certain things happen that can sometime be out of the norm/ human control. I feel like when these things happen the manner in which an establishment deals with customers and the situation says a lot about their service and business ethics. My bill came and we were charged everything at full price. My moms omelette was 21 dollars which she didn't get to fully enjoy because of the pieces of rocks she spat out and the fear of there being more. I feel at the very least the restaurant staff could have given her a discount and or even offered for her salad to be remade at no charge. Neither of those things happened. Instead the staff seemed more defensive and almost as if they questioned our integrity. The chef even acknowledged that the stones came from watercress but didn't do anything to rectify the situation. Overall I found the service to be pretentious.\\n\\nSadly we didn't take any pictures of the stone debris before the server took them to the chef."},{"name":"Patty Chen's Dumpling Room","address":"907 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Great dumplings.

If you like fish and Indian flavors, you'll enjoy it! \\n\\nOverall, I think this place isn't super authentic. I appreciate the creativity that went into some of these dishes especially since Indian restaurants don't go this route usually.

The egg was fried perfectly, and there was a nice crunchy crust on the outside, but the yolk was still runny. The chinese mustard also gave it a good kick at the end.

The pancakes had good flavor and were still fluffy, and it went really well with the creme fraiche. A must order!\\n- 1/2 Lemongrass Pork Sandwich, Carrots + Daikon, Cilantro ($5, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smallwares-portland?select=oz4sx9dW_i1K47PrfYdrLQ#MVsiyksdfud1-Jh0FwVMvQ): So-so. Skip the lemongrass pork and get a double order of the pork belly.\\n- 1/2 Pork Belly Sandwich, Kimchi, Hoisin ($5, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smallwares-portland?select=oz4sx9dW_i1K47PrfYdrLQ#ymj-vqGC8naUMzX4uoNgIQ): Make sure you get one of these for yourself! I was sad I had to share mine since the pork belly was tender and yummy.

We also had to wait 15 minutes for this to come out after we had finished our other dishes, and remind the server about it. I didn't think it was worth the wait or the price. Skip this and order more of the smaller dishes!\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed most of my meal at Smallwares, and the total bill wasn't bad at all. If you enjoy Asian fusion food and tapas style dining, Smallwares is the place to go. However, make sure you keep on top of your server to bring out your food quickly if you're in a rush- they should really work on the pace of the meal!

But if you were born and raised in Hong Kong and grew up eating dim sum (or just an experienced dim sum lover), I'd suggest you ignore the hype and stick with your current dim sum restaurant of choice). \\n\\nWhile the food is authentic and for the most part on par with other dim sum places in town, I felt that the place was pretty pricey. (Yeah, $8/head is pretty cheap when I go get dim sum, but I don't usually only get 1 or 2 things when I go get dim sum.) So it should be noted that I ordered off the \\"a la carte\\" menu and not the \\"combo menu\\" that is $8/head.\\n\\nAn order of \\"har gaw\\" (steamed shrimp dumpling that most dim sum parlor gets judge by) is $3 for 3 (on the a la carte menu) - not only does that seem a bit pricey to me, the skin (it's all about the \\"har gaw\\" skin) is overcooked and soft. Out of the 3 dumplings in the order, 2 of them broke. While I can write this off as an unfortunate event in most places, this was something that was pretty disappointing at $1 a piece.\\n\\nThe \\"siu mai\\" was good, fresh and hot. It was probably my favorite thing I had. \\n\\nThe steamed rice noodle roll with shrimp, was good but hella expensive considering the fact that it is about 2/3 of a regular order at all of the dim sum places I've ever been to. \\n\\nThe turnip cake \\"law bak gao\\" tasted ok but was warm at best (normal dim sum places will have a fryer cart that will fry the cake right in front of you).\\n\\nThe steamed pork bun should be called steamed bun with a little bit of pork (think 85/15 bun to pork ratio, it's usually at least 70/30 where I come from).\\n\\nOverall, here's how I'd rate the different aspect of their dim sum:\\n\\nTaste - 4/5\\nTexture - 3/5\\nTemperature - 3/5\\nPrice - 2/5\\n\\nWhile I'm glad that this place might unveil the art of dim sum to people who're not familiar with it. To me, dim sum is an experience (yes, even the waiting for a table) - When I want dim sum, I go to a place with a few of your friends and order a lot of different things (think tapas). I think that this place totally robs the group experience by trying McDonaldize the dim sum experience that I've grown to love and enjoy.\\n\\nEDIT: I'm reading the other reviews and seeing a few ironic \\"Panda Express does Dim Sum\\" comments - I'm pretty sure this space used to be a Panda Express."},{"name":"Silver Star Saloon","address":"6718 NE 4th Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The owner clearly put his heart and soul into the remodel to the Silver Star Saloon and it shows.

If not, consider yourself informed. We feel that it is our special calling in life to find the perfect breakfast. We have found a few places that come close, and Tin Shed can now be counted among them. How do we love Tin Shed? Let us count the ways...\\n\\nOne: Tin Shed is one of very few dog-friendly restaurants in Portland. Abbe brought her canine companion and she enjoyed a tasty meal with us. Dogs are allowed both indoors and out, and there are dog-specific menu items. We oohed and ahhed over myriad adorable puppies before our brunch was up.\\n\\nTwo: The food and drinks are delicious, and the menu is varied. We are fans of cruelty-free meat, and so are the folks at Tin Shed. The prices were more than reasonable, the portion sizes were just right, and the food is mouthgasmic. In other words, Tin Shed has fulfils every aspect of our trifecta of awesome. The cocktails we ordered were as well-crafted as the food. We decided to split a Snow White after lunch, and it was warm, boozy and creamy - perfect for a cold day like today. We highly recommend it. The coffee is Portland Roasting Company, which is always good, and is self-serve, which is also good, because Abbe and I like hecka refills.\\n\\nThree: The staff was friendly and attentive, but not too clingy. I have a feeling that hiring prerequisites are: former owner of a fashion mullet and 50% or more of apparel must be purchased full-price from Urban Outfitters, but you shouldn't hold it against them\\n\\nFour: location/d√©cor/physical space. This may just be the best part about Tin Shed. The restaurant features an outdoor patio with plenty of heat-lamps and a little shed full of blankets for patrons, making it possible to enjoy a warm, cozy meal outside while watching the customary Portland drizzle. The patio fence is a work of art, and the milk-bottle lights lining the patio are cute. \\n\\nWe would and will absolutely eat here again and again and again for the rest of time.\\nRead our full review of our individual meals with pictures on our blog!"},{"name":"Noor Mediterranean Grill","address":"136 College Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Doesn't follow the hours it has set for itself.

If you love sour cream on your tacos like I do, they don't have sour cream here but they do have a tomatillo sauce with sour cream mixed in and it was delicious. The restaurant itself was very cool. It gave me sort of a western vibe. The water glasses were candle holders it was really unique. All the animal heads on the walls were wearing some kind of hat it was so funny. The atmosphere was just overall great. We got there right when it opened and good thing we did because by the time we left it was completely packed and I understand why.

Vij's had been on my bucket list for years.  Not only did I get rave reviews from friends who seemed to make it north of the border from Seattle more often than I, but I read much about the international acclaim, including Mark Bittman's (Former NYT Food Columnist) proclamation of Vij's being among the finest Indian restaurants in the world.  Needless to say, I read and heard plenty about the legendary lines to dine at this renowned restaurant.  So I planned my two separate dining visits at off-hours so I could minimize wait times, but also was happy to hear that they had relocated into a larger space with a rooftop terrace and expanded lounge area (for waiting).\\n\\nMy first visit, in June 2016, was during the yearly kid-free weekend getaway that hubby and I take within driving distance of Seattle.  We choose Vancouver this time, and Vij's was one of the first places to be put on the itinerary!  Since this was a Saturday summer night (last weekend in June- 6/25), my goal was to arrive about 15-30 minutes prior to opening at 5:30pm, in case of any lines so that we could enjoy an early dinner before an evening stroll in the summer solstice-late daylight.  We ran late, and didn't make it into the restaurant until a few minutes past opening.  Despite this, we walked right in and were able to be seated in the dining room without a wait.  I think the warm and sunny afternoon worked to our advantage, however, since many people were opting to sit on the rooftop terrace.  \\n\\nWe started with steaming mugs of Indian chai (complimentary), which had a good mild blend of masala and milk, lightly sweetened, and a tantalizing aroma!  We also loved the chai cups, which were pottery pieces resembling brightly colored slightly crumpled Dixie cups :)  To go with our appetizers, I tried the Perfect Pear cocktail (Belvedere vodka, pear, ginger, lemon, $12.50) and hubby got a glass of Pink Elephant rose ($12).  All prices are in Canadian Dollars.  The two appetizers we tried were Samosas (filled with lamb and beef sauteed in fennel and sumac; 2 in the order, $13.50) and the appetizer feature that night, Spot (local) Prawns (with shredded coconut and tomato masala served on a bed of grilled coconut kale, $15.  This was served with a complimentary naan and 2 chutneys.  The naan was about 1/2 the size of naan you find at more traditional Indian restaurants, but still had the same amazing taste and texture that makes naan a worldwide favorite!!  The naan was so good that we asked for a 2nd order to go with our main, which they also provided free of charge.  The appetizers were incredible- full of unique flavor that zinged our tastebuds!!  We each ordered a 2nd drink- a glass of the same Pink Elephant rose, before tucking into the main dish we were sharing together.   Our main dish was Lamb Popsicles (wine-marinated, in fenugreek cream curry on turmeric and spinach potatoes (1/2 order, $19.75). Wow!! Two expertly butchered pieces of frenched loin cutlets were draped on top of a bright yellow pool of sauce.  Served with a bowl of white basmati rice, I made sure to consume every single last drop of the golden liquid deliciousness via either spoonfuls of sauce drenched lamb, mixed with the rice, or sopped up with the glorious naan.  I left contented and thoroughly believing the Vij's hype!\\n\\nAlthough Vij's comes with a higher than usual price tag for Indian food ($106.44 before gratuity on this first visit), to me it is worth every penny for the innovative and unique flavors, colors, and textures."},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went there today for lunch and the broth is really good for a cold day like this.

In order to accommodate my staff I called the hotel a week in advance to make sure I could bring my own food and beverage into the pool area. The front desk informed me this would not be an issue and shared some minor restrictions which I abided to. Once at the hotel, everything was thrown out the window. I was called a liar for letting them know I had called to verify and the \\"manager\\" Christian was absolutely no help. He made up rules during an argument and didn't really offer any solutions to the problem. I will never stay at another renaissance after this experience.

This is the dining experience for you. \\n\\nMy momma raised me on REAL (read: dirrrrrty, if you wish) dim sum that you had to drive way out to West Houston to get. The kind of dim sum where waiters - who usually do not speak English - roll carts around the restaurant, and you have to point at what you want and hope for the best. The kind where you're sometimes served chicken feet, and you have to be polite and try some. \\n\\nGet Sum is decidedly NOT that kind of Dim Sum, but for once in my life of harping on about inauthentic food experiences, I don't mind at all. \\n\\nThe set up is as follows: you go up to the front, pick up a laminated menu, and mark your choices in dry-erase marker. You take this to the cashier, who adds it all up for you, then you pay. The order goes in, you find a place to sit, and your food is brought out to you. It's pretty minimal service, but I didn't mind, as this is probably what keeps prices down. \\n\\nI will admit, I over-ordered...but this is nothing new. A great man once said, \\"LAY OFF ME, I'm STARVING!\\" Get Sum has a wide variety of dumplings, and i have to say I thought they were all pretty good. I would describe them as being \\"in the Chinese fashion,\\" but they're still pretty Americanized. However, the restaurant also does traditional Dim Sum dishes more or less as they are in other dim sum restaurants. I was quite happy with my (law mai gai) sticky rice in lotus leaf, my egg custard tart, my (char siu) bbq pork bao, and the aforementioned sesame balls. They also have things that I haven't had at other dim sum places, like shrimp-stuffed eggplant, which were very good. Everything tastes very fresh, which is perhaps the benefit of all these dishes not being rolled around on carts for half an hour, plus you can pick exactly what you want without worrying about accidentally ordering chicken feet. \\n\\nThey also have steam tables up front with a variety of \\"main dish\\" options, if any dining partners are not interested in dim sum. And if they're not, scorn them. The prices are decent, certainly in line with other dim sum I've seen around town, and everything seems to be made with better ingredients. You can get the combos, which are more cost effective, but because I was \\"so hungry,\\"  and also introducing a friend to the wonders of dim sum, I went the a la carte route and ended up spending about $15 for lunch. So next time I'll probs get the combos.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is a little chain restaurant-ish, but that's perfectly fine for what I see as mainly a lunch time spot. I also love that it's dim sum time ALL the time here, because sometimes I get random cravings outside of the traditional saturday/sunday brunch dim sum schedule. So...authentic? Not exactly. But Get Sum offers a non-threatening intro to what can be one of the tastiest cuisines ever, and they do a damn good job."},{"name":"Goldies Pizza & Beer Lounge","address":"605 W Pender Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely the best pizza in Vancouver!

The mac and cheese was perfect. A lot of times I have to salt my mac and cheese to make the flavor come out, but this was already seasoned perfectly.

Biscuits were fine, but gravy tasted more like potato soup than any gravy I've ever had. Home made for sure, but bland. Could use pepper or a spicy sausage. Loved the fried chicken at Cask and Larder so I ordered the chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was the same great chicken that they had at Cask and Larder, among the best in the southeast, but the \\"waffles\\" were horrible. The \\"waffles\\" were not waffles at all, but moist cornbread molded into the shape of a waffle. In addition to this deceptive labeling, the portion was literally a half of a waffle.
