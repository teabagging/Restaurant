So lets start off with what my friends and i got. We got a full rack of ribs, half a bbq chicken, and half a pound of pulled pork. We also got the pecan and pumpkin pie. So let me just put it out there, WE unanimously agreed that you get more food for the money at Sam's BBQ 1 than at Fat Matt's. With that being said, we still enjoyed our food very much. Especially the ribs\\n\\nThe Ribs: moist, juice, the meat was falling off the bone, and it had lots of flavor and smokeyness. We all enjoyed it A LOT. it was prob the highlight of our meal. \\n\\nThe chicken: the dark meat was very juicy and very tender. However, once you got to the white meat (aka the breast) it almost immediately lost some of its juiciness. It was still moist enough to eat, but you had to put bbq sauce on it to give it enough moisture. Almost like it was left under a heating lamp for a while.\\n\\nThe pulled pork. It was pre bbq sauced, and pulled very thinly, not like the pulled pork that I've had before. I wasnt a big fan of it. \\n\\nSo basically, if you go to fat matt's ribs, get the ribs. DUH. \\n\\nNow onto the sides and the desserts. We got the baked beans and the mac and cheese. The baked beans were pretty good. everyone was a fan of it, and in my opinion theyre better than sam's. \\n\\nThe mac and cheese was kinda thick, not as cheesy as sam's still pretty good, but i like sam's a lot better. Sorry matt\\n\\nNow onto the desserts, the pecan pie was warm with a cinnamon and milky flavor. it was pretty good. not very sweet. \\n\\nThe potato pie honestly was very similar to a pumpkin pie. in fact, imagine a pumpkin pie except less pumpkin-y and thats wat its like. \\noverall neither of the desserts were as good as Sam's banana pudding. \\n\\nSo youre probably wondering, if its not as good as sam's for most things, why the same rating. well we wanted it to bea  3.5, but we cant rate like that. and honestly the difference wasnt big enough to warrent a drop to a 3. so 4 it is.

That was my first impression almost 20 years ago when I was last at Tsim Chai Noodles. I haven't been there since my university days when my boys and I were always on the hunt for the best bang for the buck. And, while the wontons may not be as big as I remembered, they are still quite large and the menu still represents good value. \\n\\nThe wontons were filled with high quality pork and prawns.  They were tender and juicy; some places overcook wontons until they are rubbery, but not this place. The serving of beef brisket was quite generous in quantity but many of the pieces in my order were tiny fragments rather than larger chunks.  And the pieces had a meat-to-fat ratio of approximately 7:3 which in my opinion is fair-good. Brisket was well marinated and generally tender.  The noodles were the only letdown because for some reason, they were all cut into short segments making it difficult to eat spaghetti-style without a fork. I ended up having to fish out individual noodles using my chopsticks which is not the most efficient way to eat noodles. I also wished there were more vegetables but being in the middle of winter, I understand that it's probably expensive right now. \\n\\nThe black-bean beef chow mein was good in presentation and texture.  In terms of taste, it was as good as most other places.  Not the best, not the worst. The only weakness was again a shortage of vegetables although there were lots of onions. \\n\\nThe deep fried wontons were large, crispy and juicy. Be careful eating them as they come out super hot. Using the vinegar sauce provided, they taste amazing. They cost just under $9 and there were 10 wontons. They make a great appetizer or even a meal for one person, although that would be unhealthy. They are best ordered for sharing. \\n\\nService was quick. We were served food in under five minutes of ordering. Waitresses were courteous and prompt.

There's always a line up by 9:10pm and late-night starts at 9:30pm. Generally everyone who has come by 9:20pm gets seated and the ones who come after that may have to wait until the first wave of AYCE diners have finished. \\n\\nOnce seated, they are quick to give you your wasabi, tea and menu with a pencil to start checking away your feelings of hunger. 2 orders (4 pieces) of sashimi max per person. The sashimi is not the best but it's average in taste and generally cut a little smaller. Nigiri has better sashimi slice sizes - the sushi rice is hit or miss at times, sometimes it's warm, soft and fresh and other times it's hard and cold. The hand cones are not too bad, I always get the Chopped Scallop Cone and there's usually enough creamy mayo, Tobiko, scallop until the end of the cone. \\n\\nThe pieces of Tonkatsu (pork and chicken) are usually really thin, it's mostly fried batter you get but the sauce is flavorful and good. All their meaty dishes are pretty good and the portions are moderate - Chicken and Beef Teriyaki can be a little oily but usually it's tender and good. Gyozas are average, I could probably make them better at home but they still taste decent. Fried gyoza is a nice twist, but it's mostly fried skin you'll get a small pork portion but the sweet sauce that comes with it is a nice tangy touch. The Korean BBQ Pork is pretty good and has a slight spicy kick to it. \\n\\nMy favourite is the Oyster Motoyaki. I usually order 6+ orders and there was a time I ordered 12 and they only honored 6 orders for me, maybe because they didn't think I'd eat it all, but I would have if they gave it all to me! Anyway, I just love the baked Japanese mayo and if you're lucky, a few pieces of corn is mixed in with the half piece of soft, cooked oyster hidden in the light orange sauce - it's served in those aluminum cups egg tarts come in! Always have to add in an order of Rainbow Jello before we leave, a nice little throwback treat as a child.\\n\\nService is adequate considering all the hecticness that occurs with AYCE, only thing they can be more aware of is topping up water and tea but they're good at clearing away dishes (it helps if you stack them up for them!) and putting in your orders. \\n\\nIn the end, if you're looking to get stuffed with a little bit of everything and you can handle lowering your quality for quantity, then drop-by Ninzaku. The parking lot can get full quick, but there is free side street parking after 9pm and Ninkazu is located up the stairs (an elevator is available as well)."},{"name":"DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana","address":"8000 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The atmosphere is great.

Is it worth the wait? Depends!\\n\\nI'm going to be completely honest -- after reading about Franklin BBQ and watching CHEF on Netflix (who makes a stop in Austin), I knew I needed to make my way down to Austin to check this off my bucket list. \\n\\nSo after a night of adventures on both Rainey and Sixth street, I dragged my butt out of bed around 7AM and tried to wake up my friend to no avail. Faced with waiting in line for four hours alone or never realizing my dream of eating delicious BBQ, I grabbed a book and made my way down.\\n\\nIt was raining in the morning a bit so when I got in line, there was only six people ahead of me, which honestly surprised. Soon the rain dried up and more people started to arrive. I didn't grab a chair as I had a cozy spot on the ramp leading up the entrance. I solely regretted this about 3 hours in because my butt started to get sore on the concrete so I really do suggest finding a chair. Otherwise, the wait wasn't too bad because soon I could smell the barbecue that kept me going by itself.\\n\\nAbout an hour before opening, I was asked what I was expecting to order and I honestly had no idea. Feel free to kind of guess at how much you'll want because they'll still ask when you get inside to order. Looking back on it, I completely over-order and went for about a pound of each meat (no links) for there and a quarter pound for myself to eat inside. Everyone either took it to go, eating with friends or family. I had traveled all the way from Chicago, drove down from Dallas and sat down to enjoy the meal by myself. As lonely as that sounds, the food more than made up for it. As soon as I bit into my first bite, I wanted to share with everyone how amazing the taste was. I've had Salt Lick, Rudy's and a bunch of other BBQ places from New York, to Missouri to Illinois. Nothing compared. \\n\\nMy only regret was I got so full so quickly - I guess I'm not used to eating big meals at 11AM in the morning, and wrapped up my remaining food with my take home. I opted to take some of the coffee hot sauce to go too.\\n\\nBeing the great friend I am, I immediately tried to share with everyone I knew in Austin (so, like, 3 people.). I took immense pleasure in their very first bite - the ways their eyes got incredibly wide and the sound of pure enjoyment that escaped their mouth afterwards. For me, waiting the four hours was perfectly worth it because I was able to share afterwards. Will it be worth it for you?

I had the roasted stuffed chicken breast, which was incredibly tender, with some decent mashed potatoes and vegetables. My wife had a very good French onion soup with a potato skin appetizer.

My friends has never tried Brazilian BBQ before and so I was explaining to them about the salad bar and how the meat system works and then in the middle of my conversation, that same RUDE waiter just popped in and cut me off and started saying how the whole system of it work in a very fast, matter of fact tone and manner in no regards to first being intrusive to our own table's conversation, being rude again in cutting me off in mid sentence and 3 being RUDE again in rushing out the information to my friends with such UNINTERESTED tone and manner.  What is this guy doing as a WAITER??  he literally does nothing to help out the tables other than just cruising around being rude and ignorant and doing what he wants and what pleases him while hold that stuck up look on his face like he is above all others when clearly and sadly, he is ONLY a waiter who is MEANT to serve the customer's needs.  So seriously, get off your high horse or get out of the customer service industry dude.  We were there with a groupon as it was how we found the place as I am visiting from LA.  However, it isn't like we were being cheap with our orders of drinks and made no contest to the tip being included  and has been great customers and good sport to all our servers even when THIS dude decides to be otherwise to us.  What a jerk.  A restaurant is not only about the quality of the food served, but it is also about the comfort level and the ambiance in which this guy gets an F for.  Our poor waiter, being pull down but stupid people like him and having to work with such an ignorant idiot.   Our awesome waiter has dark hair and i think i vaguely remember this RUDE dude has lighter shades of hair and also a slim slender build.  Maybe he is just a DIVA and just being very GAY?  who knows."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Is it crazy to revolve your whole day around one meal and wait 5 hours? When it is for Franklin's BBQ, I can honestly say, \\"Yes! It is!!!\\" We arrived at 7:19AM and were probably the 30th person in line; it didn't take long for the line to exponentially grow from there. \\n\\nSince we knew we were in for the long haul, we came prepared with a cooler, chairs, and stand-up umbrella.  Luckily, since we got in the line at a good time, we never had to use our umbrella as we were in the shade the whole time because we were in front of the building. Others did not come as prepared and we seriously contemplated renting out our umbrella.\\n\\nAround 9AM, two girls started walking down the line and asking what everyone intended to order. This allows them to get a good estimate of where to cutoff the line so people don't wait hours in line only to be turned away because they ran out of food. They were also considerate and setup coolers with ice water and cups for people to stay hydrated out in the hot Texas sun. \\n\\nWhen they opened the doors at 11, it took us about an hour to finally get to order. The butcher was generous with the portions and let us samples the brisket before we ordered. When the brisket touched our lips, I think my eyes rolled to the back of my head. I knew were had made the right decision to wait. \\nOn Fridays and Saturdays, they offer beef ribs along with the pork ribs. We purchased the beef rib (2 ribs), brisket (2lbs of all moist with char), sausage (1 link), one of each side, the pecan pie, and the banana cream pie. The total cost along with two child size t-shirts ($12 each) came to about $150. \\n\\nWe sat outside on the patio since we had our dog and dug in. It was fabulous! The hubby and I both agree that it was the best thing we have ever eaten. I almost feel like using sauce on their meat is like using soy sauce on your sushi in front of Jiro. It's sacrilegious!!! \\n\\nIf you know you want to eat here a month ahead of time, you can pre-order online and avoid the line altogether.

It compares favorably with anyplace else in Austin (For the record, in town, I like Rudy's and Texas Rib Kings.)  The ribs are above average, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nHere's the negatives.   First, for trailer food, it's danged expensive -- not quite County Line prices, but higher than most BBQ places, let alone trailers.   Second, the side orders are meh at best.  (Guys, how much would it hurt to have some small bags of potato chips you can buy at Sam's Club or Costco?)   The drink selection is also pretty crummy.  You're limited to canned soft drinks, Sweet Leaf Tea, or bottled water.  Almost every BBQ joint I know of has giant containers of iced tea.\\n\\nI think what annoys me the most is the pretentiousness of the too-hip crowd that floods this trailer -- and floods Yelp with praise. (Which by the way is contributing to the ridiculous lines!)  Let's face it, if Franklin's was in a strip center on 183, it would get nowhere near the love from the hipsters on here.\\n\\nIn short, good BBQ that's above average for Austin.

Bartender was very friendly and took my drink order pretty quickly, ordering a local beer. Ordered a Southern Hospitality burger (since they had 86ed both the ribs and the chicken...) and spicy mac and it came out quickly. That's where the good part ends. When the burger got to me, I took the first bite, and the bun just fell apart. Not soggy, but dry and just stale. I waited a few minutes, ate the mac and cheese which was spicy, but lacked salt or any seasoning. Finally the bar tender who had gotten pretty busy with drink orders from the waitresses, asked me if every thing was good. Explained to him about the bun, and he mentioned it to the manager who came over to me. I told him the bun was very dry and stale, and he said he would go check it and get back with me. That was the last time I saw him. I ended up eating it without the bun, which wasnt much better because the party was bland too and the pickled okra just added nothing. They never offered to take the burger off my check or even give me a discount.

The food has a southern flavor, yet prepared with local produce from the pacific northwest. They are open on the weekends from 9am to 2pm for breakfast and lunch, and reopen at 5:30pm for dinner. Screen Door is a very popular restaurant all around, from the locals, to the tourists from all over the world. My girlfriend and I came around 1:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon and we waited a good hour or so. If you want to visit, I'd suggest coming on the weekdays, or during off meal hours. There is a Starbucks a couple of blocks down, so that's where we hung out for awhile as we waited for a table. Here are a few details:\\n\\nFood: I ordered the fried chicken and waffles. You have the choice of ordering 1, 2, or 3 pieces of chicken with your sweet potato waffle. Since I wasn't too hungry, I ordered the 2 piece and it definitely filled me up. I had to take some home. Portions are generous here. The sweet potato waffle was a hit. It had a hint of sweetness, and didn't give you the \\"heavy\\" filling after eating it. Definitely recommend this dish. My girlfriend ordered the St. Helens natural beef brisket hash. I didn't have enough of it rate it, but I thought it was tasty and filling. \\n\\nService: The waiter was helpful and did his job of making us feel comfortable. As far as waiting in line for a table, there is a host/hostess waiting for you as you walk in and you'll give him/her your name. He/she will provide you an estimated time, and we ended up just waiting around 15 minutes before the ETA, just in case. \\n\\nAmbiance: It was pretty loud inside the restaurant. There are plenty of tables and the restaurant is packed! If you don't like crowds/waiting a long time for food, or sitting close to the table next to you, I wouldn't recommend Screen Door. With an established restaurant as Screen Door is, the tables are always going to be filled. \\n\\nOverall, I don't think I will come back, unless it was with a friend who hasn't been before. It's a restaurant you need to experience once, but I thought the food was above average. My preference isn't so much into the type of food Screen Door offers, so that's why I wouldn't wait 30+ minutes for the food they have to offer. It's a definitely gotta try though, so go if you're hesitant. :)"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Not just best BBQ, but one of the best MEALs I've ever had, period.

It did not disappoint and my husband is a diehard Georgia boy who has sampled many a plate of fried chicken. This has incredible flavor with a bit of spice and zero grease. Awesome dish. The only reason I give four stars is because the bread before dinner was so lackluster. It was from the usually amazing Easy Tiger bakery but it was dry and bland and needed some crunch.

Also, I am going try to make it through this review without cussing, as I've realized some of past reviews involve the frequent and casual use of the f-word. \\n\\nFirst, the decor and space is totally beautiful.  It's warm and inviting, you'll  feel happy from the moment you sit down.  The bar is a very nice place to sit if it's crowded, which it can get on the weekends.  The tables are these awesome butcher pieces that fit really well with the rest of the atmosphere.  Ooh! and there's an open kitchen.  You can go up and watch the chefs work their magic.   \\n\\n We got a bunch of appetizers, drinks, wine, and well, you get the drift, we got to try a lot.  Everything I ate was just absolutely incomparably fantastic.  I am a moderately adventurous eater, and I got to try something I have never eaten before.  The charcuterie plate, the sweetbreads, and the compound butters.  Again, it was all so tasty.  The charcuterie plate had a potted chicken liver which was unlike anything I've ever tried.  Rich and slightly salty it goes perfectly with the accompanying bread.  The sweetbreads are also fantastic. I've never had them before, but both times I've eaten them at Cocotte they've been delicious - fatty and soft velvety texture,  and complimented perfectly with the nice big piece of pork belly.   Oh and the cheese plate.  A great variety, with sheep, cow, and goat cheeses, in a variety of soft and hard cheeses it was super delicious. \\n\\nI'm not really sure where to go next, but I'll go with the cocktails.  I've tried a few of them, but the Nella Moda and the Sazerac are my favorites. It's unfair to call the guy that makes the drinks just a \\"bartender\\" because it's really closer to artisan in his ability to make drinks.  If you're not sure what to get, you might just tell your waiter or him what you like, and he'll make you something fantastic.  \\n\\nI've also clams, which were absolutely amazing.  I'm not particular a clams fan, but these were so great.  They are cooked in a lemon white wine sauce that's absolutely divine.  It came with a large portion of delicious bread, and the sauce is a perfect dipping option after your claims are done.   \\n\\nI've also had the butternut squash gratin.  Long, delicious thin cut pieces of squash, lovely cream sauce, with bread crumbs, wow, it was something special.  \\n\\nThe soup - which changes frequently, if I understand correctly - was amazing.  It was a steelhead chowder, made with potatoes, and included a delicious helping of steelhead roe.  It was so delicious.  It was thick and creamy, but not overly rich.  The salt was perfect, and the roe on top was a perfect compliment.  \\n\\nOkee dokee, now onto main plates.  Order pretty much anything on the menu, and you'll be happy.  But make sure your dining companion(s) order something else, so you can try it too.  The halibut was among the best I've ever tasted.  The lamb was delicate and melted as soon as I ate it.  The bison was amazing, a perfect steak.  Oh goodness, I ramble too much.  I am serious about trying anything on the menu.  I promise you will not be disappointed."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I kid you not when I say this restaurant has some of the best food I've ever had.

South City Kitchen is your place. I had originally wanted to rate this place back when I came here the first time.... 3 years ago. Anyways, better late than never as they say!\\n\\nSouth City Kitchen-Midtown as the name implies is located in Midtown. There's a parking lot across the street that isn't expensive at all. Better to make a reservation but most weekday evenings around 6pm they are pretty open. They have both upstairs, downstairs and outside seating a long with a bar that has a pretty nice list of alcoholic beverages. So I was able to go with family members and the BF and we had a jolly good time.\\n\\nWe started out with the old time favorite of fried green tomatoes. These were served on top of a beautifully done marinara sauce which perfectly complimented the tomato itself. It comes with three pieces so perfect for a table of 3. We also opted to try the pork belly which was needless to say a very nice addition to our appetizer selection. It melted in your mouth. Additionally this was served with a side of kimchi collared greens which was an unusual blend of Southern and Korean tastes which I'm beginning to see is a recurring theme here in the food scene in Atlanta.\\n\\nThe three entrees that we selected were the duck breast (amazing!), catfish (perfectly executed), and fried chicken (juicy!). All three were items that I would get again. They are known for their fried chicken and it certainly did not disappoint. Even though I am not a fan of white meat, I would eat the entire chicken because the way it was cooked, you had no idea what was white and what was dark.\\n\\nTo top off the night we ended with the hand pie which was kind of like a strawberry hot pocket. The crust was made to order and the dessert was served with a side of vanilla ice cream.\\n\\nThis is a beautiful restaurant with excellent food and service. If you're coming to Atlanta to try out the food, this most definitely should be one on the list!"},{"name":"Boca Grande","address":"1728 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"An iteration of the Chipotle model of Mexican fast food, but so much better!

Wanted to try a new place so we came in quite randomly and not knowing what to expect. I saw some specials of BBQ fish on the board above me so I chose that. The little one wanted to eat ramen so I added extra noodles for $2 and had the tempura ramen. When my tempura arrived with my ramen, I was happily surprised. It looked so fancy, with bonito and all like a takoyaki... And it was delicious! Not oily and crispy with the right amount of batter. Then my BBQ salmon came and it was above my expectations for a $3.45 side dish. The fish head was very fresh and the skin barely had any scales. The soup base broth wasn't greasy and salty...$2 added to get the extra noodles was worth it! We also order the BBQ Saba and  that was delicious too!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"For all the years I have been coming to Austin, I have never braved the line for Franklin's. For some reason I thought that I could get something similar at one of the many trucks around town. Nope. We came on a Friday and arrived around 7:30 am. I read lots of reviews and Reddit threads on arrival time and such. By the time we settled in we were seated under the stairs in the shade about halfway down the side of the building. We didn't end up getting our food until 1 pm. The line went well into the parking lot. One of the staff came out and began chatting with everyone about the rules, etc. No smoking in line, don't get plastered, be a nice person etc. Then shortly after someone came to get an estimate of what we would be ordering. Once they made their way to the parking lot people, they had run of potential BBQ and cut the line off. This happened by about 10 am, but people continued to arrive and line up well after that. I don't know if they actually got any food or not? We were able to snag coffee from Legend Coffee right around the corner and beer from the CVS as well. They sell koozies in line and begin selling beer at 9 am. You can bring your own cooler and drink your own stuff too. We ended up trying the brisket, pork ribs, sausage and turkey. Sadly they only do beef ribs on Saturdays. The sausage had a nice casing, good snap and was well seasoned. The turkey was easily the best smoked turkey I've ever had. The brisket was fatty with a great flavor, melt in your mouth deliciousness. The ribs are a bit sweet with crispy skin, again delicious. I would easily waste another 5-6 hours of my life waiting for this food again. I was even able to snag a selfie with Aaron Franklin himself.

After shaking off my self-consciousness of being underdressed and single in a huge Chinese restaurant in Boston, I looked around and noticed quite a lot of non-Asian folks enjoying themselves in the front of the restaurant where I was; but I also noticed the Asian patrons walking past me to the dining room in the back.

It was the first thing out so I polished it off before anything else came.  The Ron Swanson Brunch Special of the day was Hannukah themed.  It was beef brisket with a potato latke-like brick and some caramelized apples.  This brisket was tender and moist and had a rich, red wine flavor.  It worked perfectly with the potato brick and apples.  Despite not liking mushroom and tofu I dabbled with the Mushroom Tofu Burger.  It was really good.  A lot of flavor and it gave me some insight as to how people could be vegetarians.  I'll stick with the meat though.  Lastly, the side of Corned Beef Hash was easily the best corned beef hash I've ever had.  It was unique in that it was more of a straight seasoned corn beef plate versus a mix of corned beef, onions and other add-ins.

Honestly what is there left to be said about the awesomeness which is Franklin Barbecue??? This place has a devout, almost religious following and for good reason. My buddies and I made the trek out all the way from Cali and decided to make Franklin's the main attraction for the weekend. Based on the reviews I read here, getting in line at 7am was supposed to be a solid bet for being one of the first ones in line. We arrived at 6:40am, confident we would be able to secure a top spot in line. That optimism soon evaporated when, much to our chagrin, we found roughly 25-30 people already sitting in line! We didn't let this discourage this however, and despite the fact we were running on only 3 hours sleep from partying on Dirty 6th the night before, we grabbed a seat and sat down patiently waiting. \\n\\nFast forward to 6 hours later and we were being seated and about to be beastin' on all this feastin'!!! I chose to devour 1 lbs of fatty brisket, 1 lbs of pork ribs, 1 beef rib, and 2 sausage links. First off, this place is famous for their brisket so I had to try that first. It was ridiculously tender and juicy! I was able to slice it easily with my plastic fork. My mouth began to water in anticipation for that first delectable bite. *Chomp chomp chomp* Omg, it was so rich, tender, and juicy!!!....for once the hype was spot on!!! All the while I thought the brisket was the main attraction when it was the beef rib that really stole the show! The beef rib is a special treat...they don't offer it all the time and when the do it's only on Saturdays. This thing was huge and looked like a freakin brontosaurus rib out of the Flintstones!!...lol. But make no mistake, the flavor and juiciness from all that fat being rendered down from hours of smoking was damn near euphoric! And lastly the smoked sausage. This was also very tasty and extremely flavorful! Aaron Franklin says his secret to these are adding a bit of beef heart in the mix, but I did not at all find an off putting iron or gaminess in the flavor profiles. Well I can sit here and rant and rave about how awesome Franklin BBQ is but you of course already know that. So grab your cooler and your favorite lawn chair and make a day of it. Treat it like a tailgate and the time will fly...yes it's an extremely long wait but it's also an experience.

They have an okay sized parking lot with more spaces around the corner and the back that we did not notice on our first visit. Also be careful where you park, make sure it is in their lot because their neighbors towed a car parked in their lot while we were there. The line was stretched outside but we would come to find out this is normal. We assumed it would be slammed but we were told a 15 minute wait and it turned out to be closer to 10 minutes. \\n\\nThe basic set up is a wait outside, uncovered, in the sun/elements where they hold you until you can slip inside to order at the counter. Then you get your food and find a place to sit. They have some tables inside and outside under some half cover. It is fully covered, but the way the sun was angled (we were there at like 11 AM) only like half the seats were under cover. \\n\\nWe were handed menus outside and told the specials change weekly. One page was dedicated to these specials, the other page to the typical stuff they have for breakfast/brunch. Once we got inside we only waited another five or so minutes to order at the counter. Both the lady outside and the woman at the counter were friendly and informative. My wife got the 7th Trimester  and I got the bacon sloppy jo special they had. I also got a blackberry sangria that came in a mason jar.\\n\\nThe 7th Trimester was a biscuit, egg, bacon, and mac and cheese with potato chips. It was pretty incredible, actually. We ended up sitting outside because there wasn't much seating and I felt like the mac n'cheese chilled out relatively quick but I'm not really complaining. The taste was pretty great, I love flavor combinations and everything mixed together really well.\\n\\nThe sloppy jo was even better. Just deliciously flavored meat and bacon on a real thick bun with egg perfectly cooked so there was some yolk to mix in with it all. It was way too much food. I could have had half and been fine. Even my wife and I splitting it we left probably four or five bites (also having eaten all of her meal). \\n\\nThe blackberry sangria was good. Flavorful, had some pulp that I didn't expect, but was refreshing with a little bite to it for those that like the taste of alcohol. I certainly enjoyed it. For all 3 it was $37, with a tip. About what you might expect from fresh food and the taste certainly made it worth it. \\n\\nIn addition to all that, they also have a bake shop inside! It is separate from the place you order your food but it looked like you can also order drinks there if you so desired. They had a wide assortment of small pies and large slices of cake along with some other homemade dessert recreations. We got a swiss roll and an oatmeal cream pie. I believe for both it was around $8 which is a little pricey for the swiss roll which was decent but not worth $4 to me. The oatmeal cream pie, however, was twice as good. Great filling, excellent oatmeal cookie-like sandwich. We ended up taking most of that home and eating it later in the day. \\n\\nDuring our stay, because of the craziness of tables and the sun mentioned before we did have two people ask to join our table which we allowed because we aren't monsters. I got the feeling this may be more of a normal experience in this place, so if you're friendly and chatty it might be great for you.\\n\\nOverall, the food was excellent, the service was friendly. Waiting outside in the sun isn't awesome, the seating is just okay. So we would be back if we are ever in the area, totally worth overlooking some tiny flaws for great food. Much more of a home style feel than what you might expect in a chain restaurant.\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\nCame back during the week for lunch (which was basically brunch because the specials were more breakfasty) and was not disappointed. Good flavors in their specials, of course. Solid 4 star food and big servings. Not as impressive as the meals we had last time but still great.\\n\\nHad more desserts, though. The moon pie was not my favorite, their signature cookie is pretty decent, chocolate peanut butter pie-type cookie (name is escaping me) was really good, and the salted caramel pecan pie was okay. Always hoping for these desserts to all be WOW but for me they mostly land around good, which is not a bad thing I suppose.\\n\\nAlso had the peach sangria this time and it was just as good as the blackberry one, in my opinion. Great flavor, goes down easy. They have the drinks figured out. Also, no wait whatsoever. Easy seating inside. Guess the trick is to come when no one is there (aka not the weekend)."},{"name":"ARI Celebration","address":"671 Front St, Ste 100","city":"Celebration","stars":"3.5","text":"We love to come here for the sushi rolls.

A manager came over and asked if our server had been over (no) and apologized and sent one over.

The other reason for the mediocre 3-star review is that after my meal I used the women's washroom. Had I used the washroom before hand, I would have completely lost my appetite. There are paper signs indicating that customers should be cleanly but it's probably the most disgusting bathroom I've seen in a restaurant so I'm not sure where they get off thinking customers are the problem.

Since you only have a choice of Medium or Well Done, I asked for Medium.  Now, I like my burger juicy and pink just like any other real burger lover, but this burger may have touched the grill for about a minute and then was served to me.  Not Medium.

I literally just watched a big truck, drunk driver, try and pull out of the back parking lot. Along the way he hits TWO parked cars. He then gets stuck between two cars and a bollard. A customer (whose car he hit) comes up and tells him to stop (because he is hitting vehicles), and he proceeds to flip her off and KEEP DRIVING through her! The bartender comes out, convinces the guy to get out of the truck, backs up the truck, and takes his keys. Apparently she knew the guy, because after some whining she hands him his keys back, tell him to leave before the cops come, and he DRIVES OFF! He refused to even give the owners of the other two cars his information. So...public safety is not a concern to the people they serve. Also...I waited at the table for 45 minutes without someone coming up to me, and was totally ignored at the bar. So...drunk guy in a hurry gets more consideration than hungry sober guy.

I was once drinking here alone doing some reading and an older man was harassing me for a long time- the staff noticed and so the bartender came over and started talking to me while another staff member approached the man and asked him to leave.

Nope. We waited over an hour, which was fine because we were prepared for it. I already knew what I was going to order because I had been salivating over the menu for weeks. We were starving so we started with the chicken strips, and they were great. Perfectly crispy outside and moist inside. For dinner, I ordered the catfish, mac and cheese, and red beans and rice. My husband ordered mashed potatoes, red beans and rice, and jambalaya. It was fine. It was even good. But it was not great. The mac and cheese was delicious and I have no complaints about cheese that oozes over the sides and down the bowl. The catfish was also good, but not as good as I could get at my aunt's house. I know that's a nebulous criteria, but if you've eaten in the south, you're going to compare all southern restaurants to that. The red beans and rice, which we were most looking forward to, were bland. Like, seriously bland. The jambalaya was dry and not brothy as we expected.

We didn't wait for a seat on a Wednesday morning. The dining experience was just OK. \\n\\nPut in short: In all, I was disappointed with the signature fried chicken and waffle. The soggy outside of the chicken and the waffle indicated lack of thoughts into the plating of the dish and lack of technique in making a proper battering of the chicken. Flavor of the chicken and waffle is good, but as fried chicken and waffle, which are supposed to be good, the dish I had in Screen door was just regularly good. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Surprisingly loud, even for a casual environment. Not sure if it was because of the big party in the restaurant that day, or it was the regular noise level in the restaurant. I have to shout out loud in order for my friend across the small table to hear me. Personally I'm not a fan of this noise level. \\n\\nFood: We ordered three pieces of chicken over sweet potato waffle, plain grits, praline bacons, saut√©ed veggies. \\n\\n    1. The waffle itself has a good texture and taste good, not exceptional, but good. The problem is with the warm fried chicken piled on top, the waffle got really soggy. I cook a lot and I was actually afraid of this after I saw how they plated the dish. I separated the chicken and the waffle immediately after I took several pictures. But still both chicken and the waffle got soggy very badly.\\n    2. The fried chicken was cooked well, again, not especially good, just regularly good for a fried chicken. In my opinion, fried chicken is supposed to be good with such heavy flavoring and high oil content. So my expectation for fried chicken will be higher than just \\"good\\". The chicken is too salty to my taste, which I do understand, because most people would probably like to taste some heavy flavoring when dining out. The meat was fried to the right texture, not so juicy, but not dry either. The real problem is that the crispy batter layer on the outside got soggy with piling up together, and the crispy layer peeled off entirely from the chicken, which is unacceptable and a sign of lack of technique for a fried chicken, imao. \\n    3. The plain grits was good when warm. \\n    4. The saut√©ed veggie is too salty for me again. Flavor is good. \\n    5. The praline bacon. First time having this dish. It tastes to me like a thick layer of peanut butter over a thick layer of bacon, with additional sugar balls on top. Not a fan of this combination, but my friend liked it. \\n\\nService: efficient and professional."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Worst ramen experience.

Unique atmosphere.  \\n\\nThe ribs are very moist and saucy, grease everywhere.  It's just slightly charred, and very sweet with the tomato-based sauce.  I like the sweetness, but will gladly admit this is probably a bit overwhelming, too greasy and sweet for a lot of people.  My favorite thing about the ribs here is that they are extremely tender, with lots of cartilaginous bits, and very little bones or dry meat.  It's very guiltily indulging to me, when comparing this to equally great BBQ that are done in a drier, less sweet more vinegary manner.  The chicken here share similar merits:  plump and soft, sweet.   I mean I am not tasting much chicken, but seems like not a problem.  Sides are just okay, with the beans being the exceptional highlight though still, not the best I've had.  \\n\\nI really like the atmosphere.  It's a combination of the place and the people that come here to eat.  It's small and dim, not exactly clean, but there is a personality to this shack.  The customers usually seem very excited to be here, and Fat Matt's being comparably accessible location-wise, the crowd demographic is diverse.

I called ahead for reservations, and I'm glad that I did because when we arrived, there seemed to be a significant wait.  As we walked through the restaurant into the main dining area, we were quickly overwhelmed by two things:  a strong aroma of broccoli and a humidity and heat as if we were in the Caribbean!  Honestly, with each step we took, we felt that we were walking deeper and deeper into Dante's 'Inferno.'\\n\\nOur hostess sat us at our table, and I quickly began to pour buckets of sweat.  I looked frantically for our server, who eventually came.  She seemed curt and hurried, so when she handed us the drink menu, I quickly chose a concoction.  I have to say, it was easy to narrow down the list of items because the drink menu has a fair selection of drinks with pureed foods...a little too weird, even for me.  The server soon poured us water, and I felt like I was trapped in a bad dream...no ice!?!?\\n\\nWhen the server came back with our drinks (which were pretty average) we placed orders for a few of their plates.  Most of the menu seems to be shared plates, which I was pretty happy with--I love to try lots of different things!  Clearly, because of all of the reviews, we had to order the chips and three onion dip.  It definitely lived up to it's reputation!  It was amazing.  We also ordered the charred broccoli (I know where the smell was coming from when we arrived), the bean succotash, and the corn pancakes.  I have to say that the food was overall delicious.  The corn pancakes, as others have commented, were a little bit strange...but good.  They came with a delicious sauce and were garnished with popcorn.\\n\\nOverall, the food was great.

I had a kiwi mojito and loved it.\\n\\nThe calamari appetizer was a sizable amount, and over all was above average.\\n\\nThey served us bread and butter while we waited for our meals, and THANK GOD they did, because our pizzas were incredibly late. And by late, I mean I got my pizza 20 minutes after the rest of my table was served their pasta dishes. In fact, my friends had FINISHED their entire dinners before I even got mine! \\n\\nFinally my pizza came out, and it turned out to be amazing! I got the mushroom pizza which had mushrooms, brie, and caramelized onions. It was pretty big, so I didn't finish the whole thing. It would have been good to split with someone if you're not too hungry. \\n\\nSince two of us were served so late, the manager came to our table and apologized for the service, and the pizzas were not put on our bill. We were very pleased about that, although the whole situation made the dinner a little weird. \\n\\nOverall, this place is nice, the servers are pleasant and knowledgeable, and my food was great. I wish the menu was a little more extensive, but I was pleased with my pizza...when it eventually came."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Awesome cocktails and good food!

It doesn't. It equals, at best, imitation Mexican- we're talking Tex Mex/Gulf Coast o' the U.S. o' A. (I made America sound Irish there, weird).\\n\\nThere's nothing wrong with that, but I generally don't favor this style over more authentic Mexican. \\n\\nWith that being said, Border Cafe in Harvard Square (and I assume every other link in this chain) serves the former. The chips are decent, salsa is super chunky but reminds me of something out of a bottle, and the margaritas are reasonable and worthy. \\n\\nThe last time i was there I ordered the catfish and it was well cooked (even though it was sorta fried the inside was still moist while being, well, cooked). \\n\\nThe prices are reasonable. The place is loud, but in the way you'd expect a place serving fairly cheap margaritas in the middle of a bustling square named after its host college (I guess it could be named after John Harvard but whatever) to be. The decor is Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville all the way. \\n\\nExpect long lines in the evening, particularly on weekends.\\n\\nI don't really have a whole lot to say. The place is A-OK as the 3-stars implies, meaning nothing glaringly wrong and nothing stands out as particularly awesome. \\n\\nI'm putting it in my Mexican list just cause that's what people expect (like Fat Cactus) even though it's sort of a lie."},{"name":"Fuji At WoC","address":"1420 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

Coming from SE Pdx to L.O. I'm shocked at how many places use the zip code difference to charge insanely high prices for so little quality.  Not at all the case with Hunan Pearl.  We ordered appetizers, four alcoholic drinks, two main courses with a side and walked away with a bill less than $50.  We also customized our orders to the right taste level for us (super spicy please!).  The end result was a quality meal that tasted great with classic Hunan flavors.\\n\\nBeyond just being my go to Chinese food place, it's my go to place period.  The quick and attentive staff and amazing drinks alone (the Scorpion is awesome!) make it worth stopping in.  \\n\\n*Quick note:  My four star rating is based on the quick service, the clean atmosphere, the good food quality, reasonable prices and ownership by locals which I always prefer to support over big chains.  The only reason it didn't receive a five is due to a lack of any real ambiance.  If you're looking for an all encompassing remarkable dinning experience this maybe isn't the right place.

I'm normally not a fan of super creamy mac & cheese (I usually like the kind with shredded cheese baked on top) but that mac & cheese was divine. The chicken fried chicken was a juicy piece of chicken breast that was pounded flat. It went so well with the gravy, green beans and mac. I didn't try his baked potato, but I don't see how you can mess that up.\\n\\nI ordered the french toast with wheat bread and apples for the topping. The french toast itself... well, I'm guessing it would have been tastier with sourdough bread but I was *trying* to be healthier. It was a bit dry for me, but with the apples it was pretty delicious.

There's parking across the street but it is not very convenient.\\n\\nThe food was good and the desserts are very good.  The menu to me seems quite large and makes you wonder if they scaled it down, they might end up producing better dishes instead of offering such a large array of things.  The entree portions, in general, are expensive for what you get.  I had the cod fish and chips and it was good but you don't get much unless you like a lot of french fries to fill the plate.  Others at our table ordered the crab cake (seemed like a small portion), the Frickin Huge Chipotle Fish Burrito and the Willapa Bay Fried Oysters which they all enjoyed.\\n\\nThe best part of this establishment are their desserts.  We ordered three different ones for all of us to share but only got two of them since the third one was \\"being sliced\\" in the back and after 10-15 minutes we ended up canceling it since we were almost done with the first two that came out.  I couldn't understand why it would take that long to cut a piece of pie and bring it out with the first two desserts, but whatever.  The first two that we all nibbled on were great.  \\n\\nI would have given 4 stars but the downside to this place is the service.  I've seen comments on here about this issue.  Our server was very nice but there was another person there, that seemed like she might be a manager, that had an attitude and it showed.  We caught onto this right at the start.  \\n\\nA suggestion for this establishment is to hire a person to go around and refill customers water glasses, ice tea, coffee etc.  We had to ask over and over for refills and even then it would take a while for it to actually happen.  I don't think this was the fault of our server.  She was working quite hard with multiple tables.  \\n\\nAs you can see, my review is half good, half not so good.  If the overall service was better, I'd definitely go back and my rating would have been better.  At this point, I don't know if I would since there are so many other places in town with great food and service.  Now I understand some of the mixed reviews I've read online.  Oh, yeah, the place is kind of dumpy and not sure if it would fit the retro 80's comments I've read but I think it is more like grandma's house if anything.

So, managers, if you're reading this, please take note because I think this place has loads of potential!\\n\\nFirst, the food options all deserve 5 stars. PDX Sliders is incredible, as is FOMO Chicken and the sushi I've had there (sorry, Tight Tacos, never tried your cart and now you're gone.) I heard that they're going to begin rotating food vendors, so based on the previous quality, that'll be awesome!\\n\\nUnfortunately, the customer experience is just not great (and I wonder if that's why some food vendors aren't there anymore). My overall impression is that a couple of AMAZING food cart vendors decided to open a brick and mortar but are still playing catch up on how to meet their customers' new needs and expectations.\\n\\nThis place could be seriously improved with:\\n- Better directional signage from the moment you walk in. The layout is so confusing that no one would be able to intuit where to order, where to pick up food, etc. without it. Also, bc you pick up food at different places depending on if you order from the carts or sushi, it's just very frustrating to try and figure out what's going on. Everyone just stands around looking confused. Last time I was there, there was some new signage but still not enough / not out in the main area.\\n- Someone working the floor! I've seen people come in and walk out because they didn't know what to do and there was no one to greet them or even acknowledge that the place is legit and open. Also, the water and utensil station is usually neglected. Again, it's one thing when you own a cart. But this is a brick and mortar - the expectations for a good experience are wildly different.\\n- Better atmosphere - wish they'd made more updates from the old Little Cooperstown bar/grill look. Maybe that will come in time. Also, music is a little douchey...but that's subjective:). When the weather changes, the patio is going to be amazing.\\n\\nAs for the bar, they've made major improvements. Last time I was there, they had two new bartenders that were working their butts off and doing a great job. They had a Pyramid tap takeover and a raffle + free swag that added to the bustle. There are TVs to watch a game, big couches that face a giant TV (which are cool if your game is on, but go unused if not bc of how they're arranged - like movie theater seats).\\n\\nAnyway, I want this place to make it - the food is fantastic and, CartLab, I love having you in the neighborhood.

Food isn't terrible, but it's not great either. I will say, as a veggie person,  I enjoyed the food much more than my bf (he said the fried rabbit dish reminded him of Mickey D's chicken nuggets at four times the price). We also ordered some weird pancakes the waiter recommended, and though the presentation was pretty cool and neat looking, for all the color  bells & whistles was just bland. And they were EXPENSIVE! Oh, and their famous burger that is available until they run out(which they won't let you forget because our server must've mentioned it on three different occasions), it was pretty lousy, to be honest. OK maybe I'm not being completely fair - my bf liked it well-enough, but certainly not well enough to go back. \\nService was good, but we heard from friends of friends(only after we had eaten there) that the restaurant and Chef talk a good game (about love for their restaurant \\"family\\") when in reality they fire people at the drop of a hat without reason and without cause. \\nPlus, they have a silly sign on the wall that reads \\"DRUGS\\", not sure if they think it's cool or what but the woman running the floor (who I assumed was the manager) was so unfriendly I couldn't really tell what kinda drugs they're promoting and/or taking because she never smiled, reprimanded the staff in front of guests, and came across as icy cold and, like the Chef, full of herself.

Get here early and just tailgate with some of your friends.  While in line, one of the servers will start asking everyone roughly how much bbq they will order.  Because they only smoke a certain amount a day, once they are out you will have to come back another day.  The last person that is guaranteed their order will have a sign to let other people know that they might not get any bbq at the end.  There is a tiny coffee trailer at the parking lot if you need a little pick me up.  They have port o potties and you can use the restroom inside as well if you need to break the seal.  After a few drinks and just chatting it up with your buddies, 11 o'clock will hit and they will be ready to serve.  \\n\\nOnce you reach the front of the line and you are about to order.  They will hand you a little piece of the burnt end.  It is AMAZING!!!  If you do not know what the burnt end is, it is the end piece of the brisket that is equally fatty and meaty at the same time.  It will melt in your mouth and you wish they sold it so you can take it home.   The server is friendly and will prepare your amazing plate to go or for there.  I usually get half of pound of lean and fatty brisket each with a few spare ribs and some turkey.  When you go here, do not forget about the beans.  It has good flavor and has a little kick which I like.  If you like your potato salad on the mustard side, you will like it.  To me, the potato salad has too much mustard but I've talked to a lot of people and they enjoy it.  \\n\\nYou will not be disappointed if you go here.  I've never had a bad experience when visiting and the staff is friendly.  When you finally decide to visit Franklin BBQ, savor every bite.  I've tried smoking my own brisket before and know how much work it takes to just smoke one.

With a table of 13, I think the menu was very well represented but I will focus on my end of the table because wow oh wow. I went basic with chocolate chip pancakes. But at Masa the Jalisco Chocolate Chip Pancakes (with mango butter and maple syrup) are to die for. I don't consider chocolate chip pancakes basic anymore. They are an art at Masa. However, the Crispy French Toast outshined them. \\n\\nThis Crispy French Toast is LITERALLY what my dreams are made of.  The description of the Crispy Texas Toast is as follows: Cornflake Crusted Brioche, Stuffed with Caramelized Bananas, Served with Jalepeno- Scented Bully Boy American Whiskey Maple Syrup. This Texas Toast was crispy on the outside with an incredible softness to its center making for the perfect combination. Lucky for me, there is not many bananas in the mix and I could barely taste them. I didn't have the bravery to try the Jalepeno-Scented Bully Boy American Whiskey Maple Syrup but anyone at the table that did, loved it. \\n\\nOn top of this incredible food, there was also a great variety of drinks to get that good good brunch buzz going! \\n\\nTHIS IS A MUST TRY!\\n\\nSome highlights: \\n- Creamy Scrambled Eggs with Chorizo and Mexican Farmer's Cheese (Southwest Home Fries and Multi Grain Toast)\\n- Crispy Texas Toast (Cornflake Crusted Brioche, Stuffed with Caramelized Bananas, Server with Jalepeno- Scented Bully Boy American Whiskey Maple Syrup)\\n- Jalisco Chocolate Chip Pancakes (with Mango Butter and Maple Syrup)\\n- Southwest Home Fries\\n- Caramelized Plantain Empanada / Mexican (Cinnamon Cream Cheese )    \\n- Great Waiter \\n- Accommodating staff\\n- Beat my expectations after only looking online at their menu before arriving."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"After hearing a girlfriend talk on & on about this place, we decided to take them up on it and see what all the hype was about.

Based on other Yelp reviews and word of mouth, Hei La Moon seemed like a sure bet. Unfortunately it was not a match made in heaven. \\n\\nWhen I first walked in, I was filled with hope as I was greeted by the scent of various dim sum dishes. The shrimp dumplings (har gow) were sold out but more was coming which seemed promising. If it wasn't good, it wouldn't sell out right? Boy, was I ever wrong. The wrapper was thick and soggy, the filling tasted heavily of MSG, and fell apart way too easily. \\n\\nI ordered other dim sum staples such as shrimp in rice noodles, Phoenix Claws, steamed pork ribs, and egg tarts. None were much to write home about but most notably, many of the dishes didn't seem very fresh. The egg tarts were probably the most atrocious ones I've ever laid eyes on or tasted. The crust was too thick, too heavy, and the filling was nearly non-existent. \\n\\nI realized too late that someone had taken me to Hei La Moon many years back when I was visiting from out of town and I wasn't very fond of it then. Not much has changed in the intervening years except the har gow wrapper isn't nearly as soggy as it was five years ago and the filling was tastier than it is now. \\n\\nI am determined to find a great dim sum place in Boston because I refuse to believe Hei La Moon is the best Boston has to offer.\\n\\nOne of the things that might have completely turned me off to this place was the bathroom odors.

So, in between the recent snowstorms, my wife and I adventured out and made the short trip down to the North Shore.  The restaurant was easy enough to find, but parking can be somewhat of a challenge.  I later learned that there is a small parking lot across the street for restaurant goers.\\n\\nEntering the restaurant reminded me of being at someones home; it was cozy with an open kitchen.  I love watching the food being prepared and the commotion going on in the kitchen.  The hostess was nice, as was our waitress.  If we weren't meeting another couple, we would have sat at the bar where I would have sampled a few of the micro-brews offered on the menu.\\n\\nAnyway, my wife and I started with a Caesar Salad.  It had the right amount of seasoning and was freshly prepared.  As the main meal, my wife ordered the Panko Crusted Haddock and I the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  The haddock was covered in the perfect amount of Panko crumbs, and the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My Pulled Pork Sandwich had the right amount of sweetness and spiciness, and the French fries were fantastic.  The best part of the sandwich was the grilled artisan bread used to contain all the pulled pork.  Topping it all off, we shared Wood Grilled Bananas for dessert.  I've never had wood grilled bananas, but anything paired with ice cream and caramel syrup will be tasty, and this certainly fit the bill.\\n\\nI will definitely be back to sample more of the items offered on the Casual Fare menu, along with some of the others beers."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"7809 E Ben White Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"While our waitress was doing her best the cooks really let her down.

Soon, a guy with a clipboard did the brisket and ribs survey. Then, promptly at 11, the doors opened. I placed my order of 1/2 lb of fatty brisket, 1/2 ribs, and 2 sausage links, and K ordered the 2 meat plate with brisket and ribs. When I eat BBQ, I don't waste my time with sides. It's meat, meat and more meat. \\n\\nMy meat by the pound was wrapped in butcher paper, and they gave me a more than generous amount of bread and BBQ sauce. I added more onions and pickles though. Was it the best BBQ I've ever tasted? Let me tell you about my philosophy on BBQ. There is no \\"best\\" BBQ; you have good BBQ and you have bad BBQ. It's either good, or it's bad. There is no BEST. I will say that I enjoyed their brisket and ribs; they were as tender and seasoned as everybody claimed. Their espresso sauce is interesting but not really my cup of tea. The sausage casings were really tough to chew and I wasn't a huge fan. \\n\\nTo sum it all up: I enjoyed the Franklins experience and the food, but it requires too much planning and time for me to just go there on a whim.

Their Santa Fe Style Eggs Benedict is INCREDIBLE.   The runner up, in my opinion, is the Nut Crusted Texas Toast Stuffed with Caramelized Bananas and Dulce de Leche Syrup.  This is more a dessert than brunch, but it's filling and delish.  If you're going with someone, it's a good meal to split because it is so sweet.  The corn bread they serve before your meal arrives is almost as good as the meal itself.  Whatever they put in their butter is heavenly.  On Saturdays they have brunch specials where for about $8, you get any of the regular main courses, PLUS coffee and a small appetizer.  Really can't beat it!\\n\\nMasa is also a great hangout at night.  The bar is chic, though small, and at least their mojitos are excellent.  I'm a purist, and very picky, when it comes to mojitos but their citrus mojito passed the test.  Their sangria is also amazing.  \\n\\nTheir $1 tapas, while good, are very, very small.  Don't go in hoping for a deal--you will end up spending more than you would for a meal at a nice restaurant to fill up.  So if you're not wanting to break the bank for a full feeling, I suggest going in at least somewhat fed.  My trick here was also to pin point the larger tapas, such as the empanadas and ordering multiple of those.\\n\\nSo on to dinner (can you tell I frequent this place?).  The meals are expensive (expect to pay at least $20 for an entree and often you have to add on for sides) but very good.  I had their salmon and was very pleased.

The waitress didn't seem very happy to even respond to this request but begrudgingly put in an order of wontons for them to snack on. Which did not come out until the rest of their food delivery order, so that made it pretty much pointless. Back to us, though: after a long wait, we got our food, and dug in. The dish I had ordered was specifically labelled as NOT spicy, which I chose due to a stomach issue. It came out doused in chili oil, and honestly I think I wasn't even given the right dish as it didn't look like the menu picture at all. But we were so hungry from waiting that I ate what I could and took the rest home to my roommate. I also did not have the drink I ordered for almost the entirety of the meal, and could not flag down the waitress or anyone else even though at this point we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant (finally another family came in as we were finishing up, and I took the opportunity as the waitress finally emerged from the kitchen to get my drink and guzzle it into my poor spicy mouth). \\n\\nThe Weird: They have a video poker room (which we did not visit), and I assume it had a \\"Pharaoh's Fortune\\" machine. I say \\"assume\\" because the only sound we could hear (besides the cooks and waitress talking to each other), was a strange ringtone version of the chorus of \\"Walk Like An Egyptian\\". On repeat. Playing very loudly. For our entire meal. I think they must have had it stuck on demo mode or something because I have never heard a machine do that nonstop without even switching up the tune a little. We couldn't help but laugh because it was both annoying and just plain odd, since there was no other music and it was otherwise dead in there.\\n\\nI am hoping that we just came on a bad night, which is why my review isn't lower. The upside is that the waitress did comp me for my drink, as I think she realized how much distress I was in from having no relief from the spiciness I did not ask for. Maybe we will visit again one day since my boyfriend did enjoy his dish, and hopefully it will be better!"},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Excellent beer selection and the Oktoberfest burger was legendary.

My bread was rock hard and the cheese from my sandwich wasn't even melted because it was so cold. My kids meals were even worse than mine but I wont bother getting into that. The owner or manager at the time had family dining there at the same time and was allowing their kids to run all over the place. There were more than two instances where I felt someone pulling on the back of my chair and when I turned around it was their kids. This was so unprofessional.

Yeah South City Kitchen!  And double yeah to gorgeous weather!!!  First off, what was great about brunch today - despite the place being full and there being a line to get in, we did not have to wait!  Thanks to the ease of online reservations, even for smaller parties, we were able to lock in a reservation and had no problem getting seated.  After going to so many brunch spots where it's customary to wait for at least 30 minutes, it was great to avoid and get right in.  \\n\\nSo let's talk about South City Kitchen.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is energetic with lots of movement and lots of people.  Fortunately the acoustics work and for the volume of activity you don't have to shout.  The space is modern and bright.  Wood floors, and tables covered in white table cloth, and the restaurant is enveloped with a whole wall that has plenty of windows.  As someone who feeds of off vitamin D, I LOVED the amount of natural light that came through, it was fantastic.\\n\\nNow the most important part.  The food.  We got off to a superb start with the complimentary basket of biscuits and corn bread that come with what tasted like their own home made jam and butter.  Every single item in the basket was fresh, warm, soft and tasted like it was brought straight from the oven.  Score!  For our entrees, because I'm vegetarian, I had their eggs benedict with collard greens substituting the protein, and it came with grits.  Delicious!  My friend had their signature chicken and waffle dish and she inhaled it in minutes.  I heard more than once that it was the best waffle she had ever had!  We both asked for sides of hot sauce and it gave our food the necessary heat that we like.  I particularly loved the grits and thought the portion size, texture, and flavor all worked excellently.\\n\\nButtermilk Kitchen is still my #1 brunch spot in the city, but I'll give South City Kitchen a close second.  Very strong first impression!"},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"For an extended period of time, visitors to the Apr√®s Diem website were treated to one of those nasty Go Daddy landing pages. On a whim, I decided to re-visit the page.  To my surprise, that Go Daddy sprawl has been replaced w/ a fully functional website. This rejuvenated effort prompted me to pen a review of this midtown hotspot. Though I find the food a universal failure, this tres chic hot spot is a magnet for tattooed hipsters, couples out for a late night, and those coffee bar lovers who would never dare set foot in a Starbucks.  The failures of the kitchen aside, the vibe/crowd keep this place on my map.\\n\\nDiem Industries is comprised of Apr√®s Diem, Carpe Diem, Carroll Street Cafe, and Village Pizza Company. While restaurants belonging to the Buckhead Life, H2S, and/or the 5th Group tend to grab more headlines, Diem's restaurants have carved out a nice niche across the heart of Atlanta.  Unfortunately, each one of Diem's restaurants seems better suited for hanging out than for eating.  As you might assume, if you temper your expectations prior to a visit, you are likely to have a solid time at any one of these places.\\n\\nApr√®s is located in the Midtown Promenade adjacent to Midtown Art Cinema.  As the Highlander is next door, and the Independent is upstairs, Apr√®s is prime for people watching.  The foot traffic to all three of those places help to keep Apr√®s occupied more often than not.  At night, especially the weekends, they enough of a crowd that the atmosphere teeters back and forth from lively to packed.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant relies upon the styling's of European cafes for its inspiration.  The color scheme is of the dark wood, burgundy, and burnt orange variety; meanwhile, the dimly lit interior, while nice for the intemacy factor, makes it hard to really appreciate any of the local artwork that adorns the walls.  All this helps to further their goals of being that trendy European cafe.\\n\\nYou enter in through the bar, but it blends itself nicely w/ the dinning area found to the right.  The lounge area is offset towards the back left.  There you will find a handful of tables as well as couches.  There are two outdoor patio areas.  The first is a grouping of tables situated outside.  The second area wraps the building.  During the summer months, these seats get filled pretty quickly.  In the winter, the tables that wrap the building are encased in one of those plastic drape thingies.\\n\\nThe service here is fairly hit or miss.  There are always a few competent members of the wait staff and a few that spend more time worrying about how they look.  As I have stopped eating here altogether, for reasons I will elaborate upon in just a sec, my experiences lately w/ the service have been fairly par for the course.\\n\\nThe one saving grace w/ regards to their kitchen are the desserts.  Everything else is a major fail.  On its best days, I would call the food mediocre.  Most of the time I'd call it weak.  Their website claims \\"that they serve \\"traditional continental cuisine w/ an updated edge.\\"  Though I believe that saying the food has an edge is like saying my butter knife is good for cutting steak, I will give them a pass on that.  What I will not excuse is the laughable execution.  The product used at Apr√®s is freezer grade.  I doubt anything is really made in house, and if there is something made in house, they'd be best to keep that to themselves. About the only thing I can swallow is the avocado split.  The turkey burger usually comes out like a hockey puck.  Of the number of times I've had it over the years, I can count on one hand the number of times it has been executed properly.\\n\\nLike everyone else and their mother, AD has stolen the word \\"Tapas\\" from the Spanish vernacular, grabbed a few appetizers, and shoved them at the top of the menu.  Unfortunately, the prices do not do much to help the cause.  Everything is overpriced based on the quality delivered.  The appetizers and sandwiches run in the $10-$12 range, while the entrees come in around $20.  Yikes!\\n\\nI do not often order dessert; however, this is the one saving grace.  I am not sure if they make everything in house, I suspect they do not...but I have no way of confirming that.  The selections change daily, so I suggest you just order whatever catches your fancy.  Some of them are blah, and some are good.  None however, warrant a trip to Apr√®s Diem absent another motivation. \\n\\nApr√®s Diem is most useful as a peaceful coffee shop during the day (free WiFi) & as a spot to drop in for a drink during the night. They often have a DJ spinning and on Wednesdays they offer up live Jazz.  Some of the DJs are straight out rookie league, but whatever. Stick to the drinks and the bread and you will be okay. I don't think I would feed the food here to my pets, but b/c of the circumstances, this is one of the few times where food is less of a factor in the overall score than is the vibe.

The place was packed and it smelled like heaven.  We waited for a good amount of time to be seated but they offered us drinks during the wait.  There was a blackberry something or other that was pretty much better than life itself.  There were 5 of us and we were seated right in the middle of the restaurant.  Our waiter was wicked fast with his attentiveness and despite how packed it was, we never felt neglected.  And he was hilarious.  One of the fastest talkers I've ever seen in the food industry.  And that's saying something.  Great experience, amazing food, a true summer delight.\\n\\nSecond time:  Brunch on a Saturday.  Wow.  The line was enormous.  We decided to wait it out because of how great dinner was the last time around.  We drank coffee and waited outside because it was just too packed inside.  Every time someone opened the door, the flavors wafted out and enticed us and then as the wait time grew, it teased and tortured us.  There were only two of us this time around and we ended up waiting for close to an hour.  Ouch.  We were starving.  Our server was right there though.  She also was very attentive despite how crowded it was.  Our food finally came and it was not the blow-me-out-of-the-water breakfast I had been salivating for.  I had the blackened tofu scramble and my boyfriend had the cajun scramble.  My eggs were a little runny and both of our potatoes tasted like they had been sitting there all morning.

To our surprise, we were told that they would not seat \\"partial\\" parties. \\n\\nOkay, I understand that many restaurants like to have the majority of the party present before seating.  However, like any good restaurant that knows customer service, sometimes, you need to make decisions to keep your customers happy.  In this case, the dining area was practically empty save for two tables with people.  There was still 30 minutes before our reservation!  Their bar area was full - where would we order tapas and eat?  Yet, despite those circumstances, they made us simply stand in the entry way with nothing to do.  If they let us sit at our waiting table, we would have already started ordering off their main menu.  Where's the logic in this restaurant policy?\\n\\nOnce our entire group arrived and we were finally seated for our 7pm reservation, we ordered pretty promptly, yet our entrees took FOREVER.

First impressions first. This place is huge. As much as it seemed over the top and cacophonic while viewing it from outside, it was exactly the same from inside. Reminded me of a huge banquet hall booked for a wedding reception of sorts. Went there for dinner the other night (Friday) around 7:30pm and only one part (level 1) of the restaurant was open. It seems like a norm of sorts. Weekends are supposedly the busiest. We went in with the goal of feasting on the dim sums. Was just not meant to be. We were told only part of the menu was being served and many items were for day time only - especially anything fried. So on one hand, my calorie intake was going to take a big hit (happy face), on the other hand we decided to go for a non dim-sumy meal (sad face). Life as we know it... So let's break this down and compartmentalize as swiftly as I can. Starting with bad news first\\n\\nService - 1.5 stars\\nNot happy. This simply - as I should blame it on - was fate. From the time he walked up to place the tea pot on our table and flipped open his pad and uttered \\"ready\\" (and it almost sounded like a plain word being taught to a kid - just - \\"ready\\", and not a question being asked - \\"are you ready?\\"), I knew we had the very special waiter! The chosen one actually. We were not asked for drinks of any kind - almost as if it was written on our faces \\"we don't drink anything when we eat\\" - I was wondering why did he even bring the hot tea? That's liquid too. But I guess that was part of his ritualistic mechanics. During the 30 minute wait between placing the order, and watching the fun party happening a few feet away from us (a group of some 42 or so Asian kids celebrating something with lots of food and booze), i noticed the other 2 waiters who were in our area were not as dazed and in their own world like ours was. But again, I can easily rate the service as 5 - I might as well - maybe because it didn't seem like patrons who were dining really cared about service at all. So. I pretty much wanted to focus on only the food and my non dim-sumy adventure here. Service can take a hike and sure it did. I just told myself - \\"hey, you are dining somewhere out of this continent. Just enjoy!\\"\\n\\nFood - 3.5 stars\\nWe ordered 2 main dishes - given the mind set; No Dim-Sum, No Apps. \\n1. Tender beef chunks with black pepper in sizzling plate: Although this dish had a dazzling red chili next to it on the menu, I told our fun dude, \\"Very very spicy\\". He wrote it down. It came out looking very promising. Overall I rate it a 4/5. It was NOT 'very' spicy (blame my extra hot taste buds). It had a spicy touch to it. But the beef was tender and the sauce was very flavorful. i liked it!\\n2. House pan fried noodle special with shrimp, chicken, roast pork and vegetables: We asked this to be medium spicy. And it was as bland as it could possibly be. I had to flag down our favorite waiter of all times and uttered, \\"Hot chili paste?\\". A nod and he swiftly returned with my most favorite dish of the nite in a small white crucible (pic attached). Maybe I should rate the service a 4.5? Never mind. Lesson Learnt. Next time ask for - very very very very very spicy.\\n\\nAmbiance - 4.5 stars\\nLOVED IT. I wish this was a self service place. The crowd spread across the entire grandness of the hall was having a blast - of some sort or the other. And so were we. With no body to answer any of our queries about the special card on our table written in mandarin (pic attached), we were left to our own devices to enjoy what we had on our table, transform it to our tastes, and enjoy the ambiance as it was - Huge, lively, everyone having a pretty good time. So did we! SPECIAL Mention: Men's room - Again, much Huger than what we expected, very clean and basically hygienic. Impressed!\\n\\nOverall - 3.75 stars\\nWhile leaving, we concurred, we came in at a wrong time. We didn't get a chance to try what this place is really known for - the Dim-Sums (the fried, the steamed and the in between). We didn't get a chance to see the carts rolling down the hallways by other fun waiters handing out orders. We decided - we liked what we experienced, even the service, and in the words of the Arnold, \\"'I'LL BE BACK!\\""},{"name":"Tokyo Japanese Steak House","address":"250 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"Very nice hibachi place!

I went there last night with three other people. \\n\\nWhen you first walk in, you come into a very cramped little area, with metal beads hanging to separate the bar. The hostess will either seat you if you are with the last members of your group to arrive (as I was) or lead you through the metal beads into the bar if you're early, as my dinner companions were. The bar is small and dark, but seemed nice (I didn't sit down). From the bar, you enter into a very nice dining room.\\n\\nThe menu changes regularly, but what I had to eat was very, very good. I had the jumbo prawns as an appetizer, which were very good, served with a roasted pepper, and some greens. Very good. As an entree, I had corn meal encrusted pompano, which was perfectly cooked. Someone else at our table also had the pompano, while another had the short ribs, and the final person had two appetizers as a meal. One of those appetizers was a lobster cocktail, where the lobster had been cooked entirely in butter, rather than in water. For dessert, I had the pound cake, with a lemon sauce, and it was very good.\\n\\nNow, where this restaurant both shines and limits itself is in the wine list. It is extensive. There were lots of good choices (we got a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir), but there are few inexpensive bottles. The permanent\\" wine list started above $100.\\n\\nThe service was great; we hardly knew the waiter was there, but we never had to look to find him. It was exactly the kind of service I like - you don't realize you have a waiter at all.\\n\\nSurprisingly, the crowd seemed to be more dressed up than you would see at comparable restaurants. I may have been the only man in the dining room without a jacket (which is unusual for Atlanta). I did not feel out of place in clacks and a button-down shirt, but it was definitely a dressy place.\\n\\nIn the end, I liked this restaurant. It didn't scream out for me to come rushing back tomorrow, but I will go back, and I enjoyed the place a lot. Nothing particularly special, but very solid.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"It is, generally speaking, not a good sign when you go to a restaurant for the first time and step out of your car and straight into a rather large pile of vomit. It tends to persuade one that perhaps the choice of eating establishment might not be entirely a positive experience. In fact, I might go so far as to say it would be sort of detrimental.\\n\\nThat is, of course, precisely how I was greeted tonight upon arriving in the oddly-shaped parking lot of Fox Bros. That said, we went ahead and soldiered on into the restaurant. You smell the wonderful smoked meats while walking in, and the place when we went was completely packed. There was no wait, but the lot was full as was the patio. \\n\\nOnce entering, you're greeted, as others say below, with a noisy cross between a cool hangout and a Texas-themed rib shack. It has all the BBQ standard decorations - rusty signs, neon, old concert posters and beer case condiment holders on the table. The staff are friendly and attentive and helpful, suggesting several things to go for on the menu. I wanted to go for the ribs, of course, but naturally, as is my luck, they were sold out completely. The other choices on the menu instead are sandwiches, platters and salads - all fairly standard combo types - and I opted for a combo plate of pulled pork and the chicken wings, which no less than three servers recommended. For the two sides I got the mac and cheese and baked beans. My 7-year-old got the kid's pork sandwich with fries. We also opted for a piece of the jalape√±o cornbread.\\n\\nThe pork was simply excellent. It had a lovely smokey flavor and was as juicy and tender as I've ever had; it honestly doesn't need any sauce, it's so good. As for the BBQ sauce, for me a lot of the experience is about the sauce. Sadly, we both found the one sauce available to be pretty disappointing. It's a bit watery and my son thought it was a little too spicy. Granted, he's seven and therefore likes sweet, sweet, and more sweet, but honestly the sauces at Williamson Brothers beat this place hands down. It complimented the meat, which I suppose is all you can ask, but I've had much, much better.\\n\\nThe wings were very tender and perfectly cooked, but I didn't really love the flavor as they all said I would. They are cooked in the same sauce with more heat, but to me they just tasted a little more bitter. I won't order them again. If you like hot wings (which I don't) you will probably love them.\\n\\nThe jalape√±o cornbread comes in a giant slab which looks far better than it tastes; as others here have said it is very dry and not as spicy as it should be for some odd reason. I would avoid it.\\n\\nThe sides...oh the sides. Too often in barbecue joints they are neglected and you get mediocrity piled next to perfection, but that is certainly *not* the case here. The mac and cheese is completely sublime, the baked beans were perfectly spicy sweet and the fries...damn, were they excellent. I don't know what they put on them but my son TOOK THEM HOME. He even wrote on the container \\"My fries. DO NOT EAT.\\" They are that good. Have to be - he doesn't *ever* take food home! They also had fried okra on the menu if you're into that; I am not.\\n\\nAll in all it was a solid four stars. The decor is a bit confusing - is it a hot spot or a country rib shack? But the service was excellent and friendly, the prices were reasonable and the food was overall pretty good. I didn't necessarily like everything I ordered, and the sauce is fairly disappointing, but we'll return to eat here again.

The pulled pork was by far my favorite thing here, and perhaps my favorite pulled pork in Boston! It has South Carolina vinegar sauce on it and the meat was nice and juicy and the bread was nice and soggy. SOOO good!! The Ribs and Brisket were okay, but nothing special. Brisket way too fatty for me. The mac and cheese had potato chips crumbled on it, it was okay. The mashed potatoes and gravy were plain and nothing special, and the baked beans were DELICIOUS. The corn bread was also really good- with bits of corn in it, and very moist! For dessert, we had the chocolate pecan pie to go, and when we finally ate it at home, it was still delicious-- a little too sweet, but perfect to share with someone.\\n\\nThey have BBQ sauces on the tables and set up in a station in the back for to-go orders. The sweet BBQ sauce is the best- the others were all very good too though!!\\n\\nSo if I came back, I would get pulled pork sandwich with baked beans and side of corn bread. \\n\\nIt's Cute inside, we had Decent service, and I was impressed by the huge portions and low prices.

This is a corporate chain restaurant so I'm not going to comment about the food.  It tastes the same everytime...with only one minor difference this visit...but we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\nSo...we put our name in.  We get seated after about a 15 minute wait.  As they are leading us to our table, we notice there are SCORES OF EMPTY TABLES.  So...............what was the wait for?  The waitress eventually comes over and takes our drink order.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria but a server from the bar brings us a glass of sangria.  So we sent that server back to get a pitcher and our waitress comes with the salad.  She expresses her suprise that our sangria had not arrived and we explained to her what happened.  Whatever.\\n\\nEventually the food comes.  In our party of four, 3 dishes were luke warm (bordering on room temperature) and one was piping hot.  Now as previously mentioned there was one variance from the corporate uniformity with my dish.  The sauce was burned.  It was the end of the day, I'm sure the sauce was in a big warm pot all day and sometimes the sauce toward the bottom burns.  It happens everywhere.  I LOVE IT.  NO JOKE!  That slight burn flavor really does it for me.  For most this would be a negative but this actually made the meal for me.  Its the cause of the second star on this review!  I realize I'm in the minority on this.  \\n\\nSo we EVENTUALLY get the check.  We open the little thing the check comes in and there is someone else's bill AND their CASH in it!  LOL, I've never been paid to eat before!   So while waiting for the waitress to show up, we check to see how much tip those other patrons left....and they left like $2 !! hahaha.

Normally, in these situations, I feel like the server says \\"Sorry, we don't have malbec but here's a sample of a shiraz,\\" hand over a small quantity of the shiraz to taste, and wait for my friend to try it and see his reaction. She just gave him a full glass and said \\"let me know what you think\\" and left. He turned to me and he didn't really like it and was like \\"hey is it a douche move to tell her I don't like this and want something else?\\" totally not!\\n\\nIn the end, we didn't get charged for the malbec, but at a nicer place like Ward 8 I would expect the server to not put customers in positions that make them wonder if they're being a jerk. Also, you just wasted a pretty full glass of shiraz. I guess it's because in my dining experience, the scenario I listed above is one that I've seen many times and consider it to be \\"normal behavior\\" so when the server deviated from what I consider normal, it threw me off. \\n\\nALL IN ALL -- SOLID PLACE.

He thoughtfully asked if this would be a no pork table, and when we confirmed, the sausages steered clear. They were also pretty cognizant of the cards being red or green... so two things they do better than Texas de Brazil.\\nThe meat is pretty tender, but is minimally seasoned. Flank steak seemed to have more flavor than the garlic sirloin. The top sirloin was the other standout cut of meat during the evening. I did not see any filet mignon. \\nThere was a long space of time where my card was green, but I guess I don't look like I can eat that much, so the meat sailed by to a table further back. Once it was noticed though, they spread the word and the guys all made rounds again. \\nUnfortunately, it's a case of a small independent restaurant with stiff competition from a big powerhouse chain, and Texas de Brazil is able to provide a higher quality of meat with a larger salad bar for $25 less per person .

Lately, I have been having less-than satisfying experiences there with some of the new staff being rude and unappreciative. I work in the industry, and I've also worked for coffee shops myself, and in my book you should always thank the customer, especially when they thank you and tell you to have a nice day. Most of the time, the response I get when I say thank you and wish them a great day is \\"Yep\\" (if any at all). They are also not grateful for the tips I leave, which range from $0.50 to $1.50 (for the work they put in and attitude/rudeness they exude, that's about $0.50 to $1.50 more than they deserve sometimes). \\n\\nThe staff that has stuck around since I first started coming here is at least friendly, but that sadly only covers two of the several employees working here. Appreciate the customer's business and don't be afraid to smile and use your manners, which I can only hope you were taught when you were younger.

Let's be frank -- in Austin, and most of Texas, you have white-guy-Mexican food and you have Mexican-Mexican food. Each has it's place in our society. The former is usually called Tex Mex. The latter is cheap as hell. The former isn't. The latter can sometimes get bogged down in tradition. The former can sometimes get a little too \\"fruity.\\" Then you have the bizarre cross breeds like Taco Cabana that exist for most everyone only because of its sheer generic nature. These don't warrant much discussion.\\n\\nI bring this up because for some reason I always thought this place was an authentic Mexican style taco spot. I don't know why. Something about the Burnet reviews on Yelp: I always imagined a cramped little hovel and a large 48 year old Hispanic woman witholding that delicious green hot sauce unless you ask nicely. Yet the reviews always imbibed such a sense of creativity, of progression in the food and the ingredients, that I became more and more curious.The whole scenario to me seemed utterly appealing, and I had to check it out. Maybe the Burnet location IS more like I originally thought it'd be, but the Lamar store totally is not. I was really blown away when I arrived and saw the store --- this is fancy white-guy Mexican food --- and IT'S REALLY GOOD.\\n\\nI got two tacos, some chips and queso, and a drink: $11. Are you really surprised? Yeah. I had the sirloin, cheese, and egg, the one everyone recommends, and JESUS it's good. The Otto (bacon, egg, avocado) was extremely fresh, but dull and not captivating. I have no idea why, but those three delicious items just don't form a strong team. Sucks. My girlfriend got the sole Bison taco on the menu and it was great albeit understandably rich. Their salsas are out of this world --- the creamy cream Dona and the fruity habenero that is. They occupy the \\"medium\\" and \\"hot\\" spectrums of the salsa-verse. So there you have it --- really-good white-guy tacos that will pinch your wallet but soothe your soul. Torchy's watch out my friends. I'm coming back next weekend for the Cowboy and the weekend pork loin special taco. I'll do my best to go without ordering chips and a drink. I will eat 5 ounces of the habanero salsa."},{"name":"Tacodeli","address":"4200 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love Tacodeli!\\n\\nI've only been once, but it was incredible!\\n\\nI loved the Puerco Borracho.\\n\\nI just wish it was open for dinner, as I would have dined there again."},{"name":"Ristretto Roasters","address":"3520 NE 42nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Back in the day , Starbucks was like this, before they went corporate.

I agree with other reviews about the food being okay but not outstanding. Everything lacked cohesion and nothing really stood out enough to get evangelical about. The ambiance/atmosphere was very cool, underground with mason jars packed with house pickled stuff, etc. The food sounds amazing and was generally executed well, but almost every dish felt like it was trying really hard but missed the mark. Almost nothing to write home about or come back for. The highlight of the night was the broccoli. \\n\\nHouse pickled green beans: came out complimentary to start the night. Not great, would have rather had bread, olives, or something that tasted good rather than just sounds cool.\\n\\nCorn pancakes with popcorn and maple cream sauce: cooked in lots of butter which made it good, but overall didn't do much for me.\\n\\nChicken fried snails: really dense balls and the seasoning in it didn't remind me of fried chicken batter at all. Great concept, not great execution (and I generally love snails!). Served with ramp aioli and pickled ramps- sounds amazing and I'm happy to see seasonal food in the menu, but overall the dish wasn't all that great.  \\n\\nMorel something: I love morels, my wife and I have foraged for them ourselves last year with a mushroom club and I pretty much love everything about them. This dish had three fresh morel halves, and did not highlight the earthy, umami taste of the morels at all. Total let down.\\n\\nCharred octopus: finally a great tasting dish. But it was particularly small. We should have ordered at least one of these per person. Shared between three of us we each got a single 1-inch piece of octopus. I'm fine with small plates to share but this was almost amuse bouche sized. Again, disappointing because the one bite we each got was actually very good. \\n\\nMackerel: way too much smoked fish flavor in the puddle of cold cream sauce it was sitting in. The pickled something with it just made for a weird flavor overall. The smoked fish sauce overpowered the dish and made it unappetizing.\\n\\nBurrata in puff pastry- good, would maybe get again but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nCharred broccoli- awesome, the best dish we ordered and the only thing I would definitely order if I were to go back.\\n\\nService and atmosphere were good.\\n\\nIn summary: I don't think I would go back here except I'll probably go by myself early some night to try the burger.

It didnt seem that busy and we were right near the bar, I couldve gotten up and grabbed it/made the drinks myself.  When they would finally arrive they were very good, strong enough and cocktails not too fruity, except the mango puree martini thing was like straight juice but besides that the rest were good.\\n\\nThe fig goat cheese and caramelized onion pizza was AMAZING and perfect size on thin crispy flatbread.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and well seasoned and the brocoli rabe it was served with was addicting (couldve been all the butter but still delicious). My friend had the veal saltimbocca and I assumed it was great because it was gone within minutes lol.  The warm spinach salad was also very tasty and great for sharing.\\n\\nThe bread was good once it finally arrived, after our second drink.  They put too much balsamic vinegar with the oil for dipping which was kind of a bummer.\\n\\nSo if you're not in a rush to go anywhere and dont mind sitting and enjoying the scenery and food and drinks when they finally do arrive, Pazzo is a good choice.

She looked like she had something better to do when she finally took our order. Waitressing 101 make eye contact and listen when taking someone's order. Our food came out surprisingly fast (normally a good thing). Unfortunately my daughter got a piping hot cheeseburger when she ordered a hamburger. She hates cheese. I know what kind of  person hates cheese? I told the waitress she had ordered a plain hamburger. She then said no I heard her say cheeseburger. This is the kind of thing that happens when your waitress doesn't pay attention when taking your order. We sent the cheeseburger back for a  new hamburger. Two minutes later said hamburger arrives. Being suspicious at the quick turn around my daughter inspects the burger. Yup new bun no cheese on it. Top of the burger has no cheese. Ahh the bottom of the burger.. Yup cheese in the cracks of the burger. They had just made an effort to scrape off the cheese and throw the burger in a new bun. Total fail Arlington Restaurant and Diner.

Table-mates ordered enchilada plates (i.e. a pile of sauce, rice and tortilla that would be barely passable in a family-style Mexican restaurant in Bellingham at twice the price). \\n\\nThe $9 agua fresca -- i.e. fruit-pulp-and-water that they charge 1/4 the price for at Whole Foods -- was buoyed by good (if barely discernable) Mezcal.

During busy seasons it may be hard to find a place to sit as there's only a handful of tables. Most guests seem to wait in line at the bar and get their drinks to go (which you are more than welcome to do), but I find it fun to sit down for a while and take in the atmosphere.\\n\\nMake sure you try the frozen avocado margarita.

I've had similarly amazing steaks at Ocean Club, but the steaks at the rest of the Cameron Mitchell restaurants that I've had weren't quite deserving of the \\"prime\\" designation.

The last time I went the price had been raised to $32. I can't blame them, since there was still a 45-minute wait to get in even at $32 for the signature dish that was $17.95  a few years ago. I came to Marco's based on the Yelp review that said 'My mom got lobster ravioli - it was excellent'. Uh, no. Your mom has apparently never been to Rino's. The lobster ravioli at Marco's treats lobster as an additive. At Rino's lobster is the focus. Though Marco's is cheaper, the quantity is less. To get the same quantity of lobster ravioli as Rino's you would have had to spend $32 or more, and you would have a vastly inferior product. So even at $32 Rino's is a bargain. I don't know why a restaurant doesn't reverse engineer Rino's lobster ravioli and have itself a hit.

The place is very comfortable, and has a fantastic atmosphere. The music is good, not intrusive, and when you sit down it just feels good. It's not smoky, but you can smell the BBQ, and if that doesn't get your appetite in order, you may want to consider becoming vegan.\\n\\nThose good feelings are bound to increase when you consider your options for drinks, ranging from some really excellent beers, to lemonade that I cannot recommend enough. That lemonade is created by pressing the lemons, and combining with homemade simple syrup.. and they are truly, AGGRESSIVELY bottomless. I mean, when we were getting ready to go, our server asked if we'd like to have some lemonade to go. \\n\\nStill, this is a BBQ joint, so lets get down to it. We ordered the Pit Boss Sampler, which has something of EVERYTHING. Hoo boy, it was good. \\n-Pulled pork is in the true Carolina style.\\n-the Spare Ribs are... the best. The BEST spare ribs I've had above the Mason-Dixon line, period.\\n-Baby Back Ribs are succulent, smoky, and off the bone in a heartbeat.\\n-The Fried Chicken: EAT IT. Seriously, this is some of the best you can get, period. Unless you feel like making a pilgrimage down south, you will not find better.\\n-The Hot Link is tasty as hell, meaty, and spicy without being overly aggressive.\\n-The Sweet/Spicy Wings were just that, and really good.\\n-The chopped brisket is good, beefy, but I've had some better, albiet not in this state.\\n**Sidenote: The brisket and pork are placed on a slice of Texas toast, which soaks in the juice and fat.. and it's just... yum.\\n\\nThe sides were (almost) universally the best I've had in a BBQ joint anywhere in our Northern lands. The exception was the rice and beans, which sadly just were not very engaging.\\n\\n-The cornbread: Oh god. Yes. So good. So. SO.. good.\\n-The coleslaw: crunchy, fresh, tangy; it's what you want in colesalw. \\n-The beans: Smokey, porky, and LOADED with molasses... so good.\\n-The Mac & Cheese: Not a huge fan in general, but this was very nice, creamy, with a topping that adds great textural interest.\\n-The Collards: I don't like collards, but I like these! A generous addition of mollasses cuts, but doesn't totally eliminate the bitterness. Most importantly, the green flavor is still there, and the greens have great texture; no sulphuric mush here. \\n-The Potato Salad: Best there is... and I'm a deli fanatic. Really... REALLY special.\\n-The Mashed Potatos: Fantastic, creamy, rich, with a fine gravy.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that this is a place you can enjoy for the atmosphere, but above all this is truly great food. You can create your own platter from an essentially endless variety of choices, and the set menu is a winner. \\n\\nIf you like BBQ, you'll LOVE Soulfire."},{"name":"Papa G's Vegan Organics","address":"2314 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food!

I find a lot of baked beans to be a bit bland...not so at Fat Matt's.  These beans have just the right amount of kick to hold their own on a table full of flavor-packed pork.

I live and die by my intense cravings. Today I needed Old School BBQ brisket to soothe the beast - I was denied... No bus on MLK! Where the hell was it? I had to call - seems that they were booked for a last minute biker party...Dan (one of the owners) told me to come back and remind him of my heartbreak and he would hook me up with a discount...very sweet but not necessary. \\nAlas this is about how Franklin's rocked my buds today so back to the story... \\nIt seemed like a less than perfect to start to my very rare day off. Then the sweet angelic voice of my beloved said \\"We've wanted to try Franklin's...You game?\\" I'm pretty sure I said yes but on the short drive I must have made 10 other suggestions so obviously I wasn't enthused. The buds want very specific things and they can be pretty unforgiving when they don't get it. So we park and there is a serious line (waited 45 minutes at high noon). 6 minutes in Mark (whose voice is far less angelic at this point -I might even say demonic due hunger) is ready to bail because of the heat and sun. Hell we're here now! So we hold hands (sweaty hand holding before a plate of ribs?) and try to show patience. \\n30 minutes a warning is issued \\"We're getting low on brisket so there may not be any when you get to the window...blah blah blah\\" We are not deterred. The guy behind us starts talking about lobbying folks ahead of him to skip the brisket so he could get it for himself and his lady. Needless to say he was ass-out. I thought about ordering it all just to teach him a lesson but two wrongs don't make a right... I even convinced Mark to share my brisket in the hopes that poor guy might get his fix. \\nRibs had a great flavor and were fall of the bone juicy and tender. The brisket a gorgeous crust and bright pink smoke ring...flavor and tenderness great. The sausage was just OK. The pulled pork was flavorful and succulent. All had a distinct peppery flavor without bitterness. I thought all the sauces were good (some more vinegar than I prefer) but not necessary. The flavor of the meats didn't need the enhancement. Make sure to ask for jalapenos there not out for general consumption like the pickles and onions. The sides were lacking for me. I know it's about the meat but sides should compliment any meal any place not be an afterthought. I'm certain they could be improved with a little thought. The beans need salt and seemed to be dry. I'm not going to discuss the potato salad...I'm going to send them a batch and the recipe and pray (it's an easy fix if they care). The slaw had good texture and wasn't over dressed and soggy-it simply lacked any distinctive flavor. \\nTo sum it up: GO NOW! YOU DESERVE A TREAT"},{"name":"Fazenda Cafe","address":"3710 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"Maybe I just came on the wrong day (reading all the 5 star reviews).\\n\\nRUDE F--ing service.

Keep an eye out for this area if your party is small; then you won't have to wait as long.\\n\\nWe shared the chopped brisket sandwich, collard greens, mac and cheese and the frito pie. The brisket was on the fatty side, and the roll was SUPER buttery (or oily.. gross) - we split the sandwich and each took off the top of the bun and didn't eat it. I liked that the brisket was chopped. The collard greens were excellent, the mac and cheese was okay, and the frito pie was great.\\n\\nThe bartender was on the mean side and was short when she talked to you, but while we were there and the place got less busy she became nicer. Maybe she just had a bad day.\\n\\nWe took the MARTA train here and walked to get here; not a bad walk especially if you're about to stuff yourself with BBQ.\\n\\nSo, while I enjoyed it, I wouldn't say this place is amazing. I've heard Fat Matt's is great, but mainly for ribs. Maybe next time."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Recently brunched here a trip through Portland and loved it. \\n\\nThe place is pretty big and busy so there is a wait, but things do keep moving. I had a good view of the kitchen from my seat and everything looked so amazing, fresh, and quality coming out of the kitchen.\\n\\nThe most amazing thing anyone at our table got was the fried chicken and waffle. \\n\\nThe fried chicken alone is awesome. They do something great to the batter and it's a little spicy and the chicken is perfectly cooked. \\n\\nThey present it with three pieces piled on a sweet potato waffle with a knife stuck through the top, through all the pieces, and into the waffle. It's served with maple syrup and is a big portion.\\n\\nFucking yum.\\n\\nOne thing I'm deducting a star for is the biscuits. I am a biscuit kind of girl and was really disappointed. I like a biscuit that melts in your mouth and is crispy/flakey on the outside moist on the inside and ready to melt butter. The biscuits at Screen Door are kind of dry and flavorless, square cut out from a pan, and not butter melting temperature.

I had a halibut dish and the hubs had etoufe. I loved my dinner - fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was heaven...oooh...mashed potatoes were incredible! I personally did not care for the etouffe, but it wasn't my dish and the hubs thought it was outstanding so...there you go.

And I love Brussels sprouts anyways so yay for doing it justice~ \\n3) Pork belly - I remember this dish being very oily and fatty. I've had pork belly many times before, but this is the first time I had it and thought it was too much. The outer crusty layer does help absorb some of the oiliness while eating, but still, a bit too much for me. But when I cut a bit of the fat off, it was perfect. \\n4) Wine steamed clams (forget the name of the dish) - so rich and buttery, but so good. I almost asked for another slice of bread so I could have more of the liquid... probably not good for my body but oh so good for my mouth. \\n5) Grilled octopus leg - this one was also rather salty, but it had this perfect crusty outer layer that I didn't expect until I took a bite of it.\\n\\ni heard that they change their menu often, so if I am back in the area I'd definitely visit this place again.

I tend to think of Stubb's as music venue first and BBQ joint second, which is a little ironic, in that I've been to the original Stubb's restaurant (RIP) in Lubbock.  The back story on Stubb's is a compelling one:  CB Stubblefield (also, RIP) cranked out some amazing BBQ in West Texas back in the day.  So friendly was his manner, so good was the food, and so lucky was the placement of the restaurant that traveling bands would stop in and play sets on long legs of their trips that took them through Lubbock.  And in between, the Lubbock Mafia was coming of age:  Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Butch Hancock (The Flatlanders) and many more carved up tunes onstage while CB made prime eats. Eventually CB took the craft down to Austin, where the place expanded on his legend.

I moved out to Portland back in July and have been attempting to find decent but affordable eateries in the different neighborhoods. The Yelp reviews for Lorenzo's were pretty good, so I said, \\"What the heck, let's give it a shot.\\"\\n\\nThe first time was okay. Our server was nice and knowledgeable, but seemed like he didn't want to be there. We shared the baked brie for an appetizer, it was standard baked brie, nothing special. Then I got the puttanesca. Also fairly standard. I used to work at a restaurant that served puttanesca and I prefer the place I used to work's much more. This one wasn't tangy enough and the noodles seemed a little undercooked. The only good thing about it was the olives.\\n\\nThe second time was not good. We had to sit at the bar because we got there just right after everyone sat, which is fine, they can't help that. The bartender was our server, but also seemed like she was other tables' server? It was hard to tell. Anyway, she was about like the waiter we had the first time. Nice, got our order, and then checked in like once or twice. Standard service, but the attitude was very much like she just wanted to get off work and go enjoy her Friday night.\\nThen the food. I will not go back again because of this. I got the cheese tortellini because it had artichoke hearts with it and I love artichoke hearts. I do not however love undercooked tortellini that tastes like it came from one of those \\"heat and serve\\" pasta packages at the grocery store. These were then dumped into chicken broth with a couple artichoke hearts and a ton of caramelized onions (aka, onions soaking in chicken broth all day). I could've made the dish at home and it would've tasted better, and I'm not an amazing cook. It was bland, I couldn't taste the artichoke hearts at all, and I only ate it because I was very hungry. My boyfriend got the potato gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce. It was very much the same concept as mine, except that Gorgonzola cheese can't be bland simply because of what it is. That said, it was too rich. He left feel queasy, and I had some of his sauce and felt a little the same way. Too much of a good thing is still too much.\\n\\nBefore the meal they give you bread and some olive oil is on your table to dip it in. This is the only good part of the meal. Also, they have water (room temperature tap water) in wine bottles on your table. This is a cute idea, except the tables are rather small, especially the 2 person tables, and there's already 2 glass things on them you are worried about knocking off and breaking (the olive oil and balsamic vinegar containers). On top of that issue, the water tasted like chlorine last night. I understand it's tap water, but the tap water in my house, which is the same tap water in their sink, doesn't taste like chlorine. I don't get it. Perhaps an issue with dish washing?\\n\\nSo, I wish I could agree with all the positive reviews, but mediocre service, less than mediocre food, and disgusting water all lead me to say, eat in before going to Lorenzo's.

Well, it was Saturday around lunchtime (in other words, we waited, and waited... and waited).\\n\\nAfter an hour, we were finally seated, and I quickly put in my order for their famous fried chicken and sweet potato waffle.  My hubby said it was the best fried chicken he's ever had.  And that's coming from a non-foodie, \\"food is food\\" type of guy.  The chicken is perfectly crispy with just the right amount of batter, and a pretty good kick to it.  The chicken was also super moist.  Oh, and I just have to mention that the leftover chicen we brought back was still pretty darn crispy the next day.  And unless you're sharing, you will most likely be taking some home.  You get 3 ginormous pieces of chicken piled high on the waffle.  The sweet potato waffle was very tasty.  The sweet potato added a nice savory component that went well with the chicken.  I did wish the waffle was a little crispier though... I guess after supporting all that chicken, something's gotta give?  My hubby got the cajun scramble with a biscuit.  The scramble was pretty good and the potatoes were very flavorful.  The biscuit was just eeh.  \\n\\nThe prices were very reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get.

They have an extensive drink list with lots of Mezcal and amazing tequila choices. I recommended you ask lots of questions if you are not familiar with tequila. The staff is 100 % knowledgeable and friendly and will steer you in the right direction. I had the Palomo which has IPA beer in it, and my friend had their house margarita that's on tap! Me and my friend shared 2 tapas, The Ceviche and The Empanadas. I can confidently say this is the BEST ceviche in Atlanta. The fish is sliced and not diced , it's fresh and has crunchy cucumber ; seasoned to perfection ! The empanadas are made in house: flaky, cheesy and filled with Rajas which I'm a total sucker for. For dinner we shared the molcajete which was grilled steak, chicken, cactus, cheese, and onion all in a stone mortar. It comes served with tortillas so you can make your own tacos, yum. Last, but not least, dessert was absolutely perfection. We had an a warm empanada filled with Arroz con Leche served with a cold scoop of ice cream on the side. Unique and really hit the spot! The only negative was not having enough room in my stomach to eat more. \\n\\nThis place is unique and unlike any in the area.

Since I'm so indecisive, a meal with a little of everything is perfect for me.  That's why I love buffets.  But I actually hate buffets because the food served up is usually of lesser quality.  However, Punjab Cafe had some interesting looking choices so I did end up opting for the buffet.\\n\\nI started off with the samosa and vegetable pakora.  Really good.  Actually, I think the appetizers were the best part of the buffet.  I gave one samosa to the boy, who had actually ordered a regular meal.  Normally at buffets, you can't do that because they'll either yell at you or charge you or both.  But the boy had my buffet samosa and there were no bad consequences.  Total plus for Punjab Cafe.\\n\\nAfter that, I settled on a lamb and chicken dish, though I forgot what.  They were both really good, though I wish they were more spicy.  I understand they have to appeal to the bland American taste bud, though, and in buffet, it's easier to go bland than spicy.

I don't know why that is, but I do. As a result I often find myself commenting on other reviews.  This is no different so, a brief tidbit, while it is only open for dinner during it's opening, a full lunch, dinner and late night service is planned.\\n\\nWhen a friend who bartends at Surly Girl told me this place was finally open I made plans to give it a try just two days later.  I was told a few things going in.  1) The food is cheap. 2) The drink names and concoctions are unique and hilarious, and many of them feature slush because they have a slushie machine. 3) The walls are adorned with kitschy paintings of '80s pop culture icons done by Lessner's brother, Thom.\\n\\nThose were my expectations going in.  I also anticipated the place to have a diner feel.  Originally I had no idea the restaurant was going to include a full bar. It would certainly have been a diversion from the normal Lessner approach, but a hot dog diner doesn't exactly conjure images of a place to go have a drink. \\n\\nI was excited to learn they did obtain a liquor license though.  When I got to the Hot Dog Palace one of the first things that I noticed was how scaled down it was compared to other Lessner joints.  It really is a diner atmosphere.  The seating is very, very limited and the food is served very, very fast. It isn't the kind of place that would appeal to campers (service industry slang for patrons who sit at a table all day/night).\\n\\nThe decor is very flashy compared to other Lessner joints. Many of the aforementioned paintings feature Chicago Cubs players, while the rest are mostly musical icons from the '80s, including Michael Jackson, The Ramones, and Thin Lizzy, to name a few.  Inside it is bright and lively.  The walls are all bold, big colors, and the windows are huge and let in lots of light.\\n\\nUnless you regularly buy hotdogs at ballparks and movie theaters $3 ought to seem a little high for a normal ole hotdog that can be purchased elsewhere for much closer to two dollars. However, those dogs won't have the creative toppings and combinations available at Dirty Franks. Considering the quality, amount and inventiveness of the dog selections $3 seems about right.  It is definitely worth it to upgrade your frank though.  I went for vegetarian brats.  \\n\\nI had the Beano and the T-Dog.  I must say, the T-Dog, featuring Srirachi mustard, roasted red peppers, bacon bits and sharp cheddar was fantastic.  I asked for it to be made vegetarian, and apparently they use real bacon bits, not the cheap kind that are actually made with soy because I got no bacon, fake or otherwise.  The beano (veggie refried beans, tomato, onions, mustard and cheddar) was equally enjoyable.  The combination of the beans and the frank was amazing.  Both dogs were overflowing with cheese. \\n\\nAs for the drinks, the menu did not disappoint. Much like Lessner's other joints, which feature drink names like the Surly Temple or the Shady Lady, Dirty Franks had humorous drinks with names worthy of trivial pursuit questions. A few examples: The Rick Astley, Ride the Lightning and Reign in Blood.  When you have drinks named after 80s metal, you have won my approval, even if the ingredients include citrus vodka, 7up and lemonade (as opposed to say...whiskey, cocaine and/or heroin).\\n\\nThis is no Hillbilly Hotdogs, but if this place stays as fast paced of an eatery as it ought to, it will be a big success. I hope that turns out to be the case."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Its Medieval Times with Pirates gggrrrraaahhh!\\n\\nThe food was actually pretty descent, and the show was entertaining.

The decor was really nice.  Nothing too fancy, and nothing run down or cheaply made.  It brought the feel of a ramen shop without being overbearing.  A really good balance.  And I realize this might be a strange thing to boast about, but their bathroom was badass.  I won't spoil as to why though.  Just be sure to go wash your hands, and you'll see :)\\n\\nAt the order counter was a display of all the different Japanese drinks one could order.  Ramune, oolong tea, green tea, etc.  They even had a set of Japanese imported beers.  Not to mention, they even had Japanese snacks.\\n\\nI was really impressed by the crew.  They were very helpful and friendly.  Really cool and chill people.  They would check in and actually stay briefly to hold conversation.  I enjoy this because I feel more like a person than just a customer.  They were also patient enough to answer any questions we had, even if we felt dumb asking them.  I came in with a date who knew absolutely nothing about Ramen, outside the $.12 noodle packets at Walmart, and even she loved the place!  They even had a little instructional sheet to help you enjoy your ramen that gives you insight to the culture.  And, like any good restaurant, they have comment cards for any suggestions or comments you might have.\\n\\nI've been there twice now, and I definitely plan on going back again.  The first time I tried the Tonkotsu Original, that way on future visits, I know what to compare the basic taste to.  The bowls themselves are about $8.50 - $9.  I thought it was really cool that they had the option to add more things to your bowl.  And the extras weren't very expensive either.  Most of them were only an extra $.50.  They have fish cakes, bamboo, extra pork belly (amongst others) and things they call \\"bombs.\\" This changes the texture and/or flavor of the broth.  If you like it creamier, you can add a corn/butter bomb, or add a spicy bomb if hot is your thing.  And even more thoughtful, it comes on the side, so you can moderate how much you want to add.\\n\\nEverything about it was awesome.  The portions are huge, the broth was amazing, noodles fantastic, and the meat was tender.  And I don't know what they did to my egg, but it was most excellent.  Haha.\\n\\nThe second time around I wanted to try the Mi-So-Hot, but I wasn't sure if it'd be too spicy for me.  So they suggested trying the spicy bomb, that way I could moderate how spicy to make it.  I can handle some spice, but not too much, and that ended up being just enough for me-- where it's not too spicy on the first bite, but I'd have to pause after several.\\n\\nOne thing I really liked is that they only have chopsticks.  No spoons or forks.  I know there are some people who may find that problematic, but ultimately, it immerses you into the culture more.  I'm not a fan of the \\"You're in America!  Do it American!\\" mentality.  I feel those people should be more open minded.  And of course, if you don't know how to use chop sticks, they can teach you upon request.  My date had never eaten Japanese cuisine or used chopsticks, and she learned how to use them there.  She loved her experience there as well.\\n\\nI feel like I wrote an essay about this place, but it was worth it.  I truly enjoyed my experience there.

On the app, I even had my allergy settings on (I'm allergic to dairy, specifically a protein in all mammal milk). Super convenient and easy; I was really looking forward to this darn sandwich. \\n\\nWell, I go to pick it up and bring it back to the office. Find out AFTER two bites into this sandwich that it is NOT the French Breakfast Sandwich that I ordered, but instead one of the other ones which had CHEESE (which I am allergic to) and tomatoes (which I also try to avoid due to dietary issues). Realizing by bite 3 that I had the totally wrong sandwich and guesstimating in my head if 2 bites was going to kill me (thank god for Epipens), I basically spit everything back out and hoped for the best. Needless to say, I trashed the rest of the sandwich.\\n\\nThat said, Clover is actually a decent establishment -- though I would be cautious about making sure the right order is in the right bag. And I'm definitely put off from that place now.

These were legit. Like melt in your mouth legit. An order comes with three Pierogis covered in sauteed onions with sauces on the side. I kept it pure and just had them with the onions - no sauce required. We then split the PORTER BURGER and the flavors and textures mixed together were great. Thankfully, we saved room for dessert and had the BAG O DONUTS. These were good - not my favorite on the menu (although three cheers for the caramel dipping sauce!), but three highs and one low still gives Porter Ale House a four-star review in my book. Our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing. He was patient and helped guide us through our menu choices - letting us know house and his favorites as well as portion sizes to expect so we could order just the right amount without leaving hungry or too full. I wish I lived a little closer to explore the menu more easily in the future."},{"name":"Flat Patties","address":"33 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Great European Burger!

When I called them they told me it had just been completed and had to be turned over to a new driver since it wasn't ready at the time to be delivered. The new driver was a good distance away so I'm worried that my food may be cold by the time it arrives. And when I called the restaurant to see if I just need to pick it up, they hung up on me! I was very upset because I'd had a long day, and this was not what i'd asked for. When I finally got my food it was the sorriest wateriest, vinegary plate of wings I'd ever seen.

One of the waitresses tried to make it better saying the app I ordered from doesn't always send out drivers when the food is ready and they have a hard time getting food out because of that. But that didn't make up for the overall poor quality of the wings and the pizza itself. Also I got all this information from a different waitress, the one I spoke to, a smug light-skinned one with short brown hair, was just going to tell me I couldn't return it and that was going to be it.

Ever since the tender age of 7 when I was eating entire Medium pizzas on my own, to now where I eat pizza for breakfast lunch and dinner a few times a week and will terrorize the local cici's buffet.\\n\\nI was so excited to try Edgewood. I'd heard so many people tell me how amazing it was and that they preferred it over a few of the other pizza joints I frequent. Now, I was expecting absolute gold. Pizza crafted from the heavens and placed onto a plate by the hands of God. Instead, my experience was absolutely underwhelming and I was so disappointed.\\n\\nI rode the street car and took a bit of a hike to get here during my lunch break at work. I walked in with 2 coworkers and took a booth close to the kitchen. There are maybe 6 other people in the establishment and 2 staff (1 host/waitress and 1 cook). Now, I am not difficult to please when it comes to being waited on. Wait staff work hard and I always make sure to tip above 20% even if I feel like my experience isn't that good. However, this girl is just standing around and seemed to mindlessly wander throughout the kitchen and the front of the restaurant. It took 10min for her to come over and take our order and mind you, she wasn't helping any other customer during those 10min. The entire time we're waiting for our food, both the girl and the cook look so disinterested in their jobs. If they weren't seen in the back of the kitchen, you could have mistaken them for random customers in the restaurant. A few people came in after us and received their food before us. Finally after 40min we flagged down the waitress and asked if we could take our food togo and if we could get the checks. She saunters over to the register and brings us our receipts which she places on the table next to our cards and walks away... WHY WOULD YOU NOT TAKE OUR CARDS?! At this point she hurries to the kitchen she starts boxing our pizza. I am praying to God she will bring all our food out, charge our cards so we can be on our way back.  But then I notice she has just started on our wings! In all, the staff is completely disorganized and don't seem to know how to work a restaurant. Our food took an hour to make it to our table, I can only assume they raised the cow from calf to adulthood and milked it to make cheese and other ingredients during our time spent waiting.\\n\\nAlso, the pizza was not worth all the hassle. It was not a bad pizza, I won't judge the pizza for the shortcomings of the staff, but it just wasn't that good either. It was also a little overdone and burnt black on the edges. I can see why their main customers are drunken patrons of the bars down the street. I don't believe I would ever go back because it is just not worth the wait and frustration.

If you want to judge the authenticity or experience the true flavor of an Indian Restaurant/Cuisine, taste the Malai Kofta (traditionally made with two varieties of sauces - Red Masala Base or Brown 'Nutty' Sauce). Saffron's Malai Kofta is the Red Masala Type and the sauce is very Rich, coming very, very close to the Authentic Taste, Texture and Consistency. The \\"Kofta\\" or Dumpling was Cooked almost to perfection - the dish was overall Tangy, Evenly Spiced and Hospitable - inviting me for more and more. Concerning the Rice, it was not Clumpy, Oily (as most restaurants like to add oil to Basmati - that is not traditional to do) and Textured Well (not too Soft, not too Al Dente). The Garlic Naan was also cooked/baked almost to perfection - excellent blend of Garlic, Butter & Fluffy Naan. The Overall Portion Size was acceptable, can't say generous (3-4 Kofta). Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhni) was excellent with tender, Tandoorized, Marinated Chicken. Traditional Butter Chicken is Bone-In by the way with no food coloring. This Butter Chicken is not traditional, but the Flavor was on point and finished with Kasoori Methi (a secret ingredient: Fenugreek Leaves, used instead of sugar). \\n\\nTHE HIGHLIGHT OF THE ORDER: THE MANGO LASSI is one of the Most Authentic I've had & the Mango Flavor Favors that of the Pakistani Mango Type. \\n\\nMind you, this was a Take-out/Delivery Order.

The accolades are deserved. We have a little place in Wimberley and sometimes make the trek to Austin to shop and relax. I'd recently read the review for Franklins in A food magazine and suggested it when we started getting hungry on a Saturday trip to Austin. We got there around 12:30 and saw a line out the door. With no other alternatives near by we decided to take out luck on the line. First idea that we were in the right place was when a server came out on the line offering cool drinks and samples of the sausage. Brilliant! Second idea was that at the \\"sold out\\" sign went up a short time after we got in line and people still stayed on the hopes that there would be something left. We stayed too and - although the wait seemed forever - were rewarded for our persistence.\\nThe brisket is spectacular. I can honestly say that I have never tasted anything this good before. We've been to Salt Lick and a number of other BBQ places in the area and there is simply nothing else in this league. The brisket is moist and flavorful. We tried both the lean and the fatty cuts and they were both moist, deeply flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The sausage reminds me of old Polish kielbasa (sp?) from the east coast with a wonderful crunch to the skin. The owner was generous with the cuts we received and he even threw in two ribs since it was my wife's birthday. The meat does not need sauce but I tried it and was impressed with the taste.\\nSince we were one of the last in line I was unsure if there would be anything left but took a chance and asked for a pound to take home. Again, the owner was more than happy to pull an order together and I know we had the better end of the bargain. We just finished it off for lunch today and it was almost as good as fresh. The day in the frig really helped concentrate the smokey flavor. \\nI'd recommend Franklins to anyone. But I'd tell them to hurry to get the full experience. With food this good, i'd be worried that success will change them over time. Get there now before this changes one bit and then you can always have the memories. \\nIn short, Franklins is now the measure I will use whenever I eat BBQ."},{"name":"Cosmic Ray's Starlight Caf√©","address":"1180 Seven Seas Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Wow!

Sweet tofu (dau fu fa) is also very nice for warming your inside especially in conjunction with the sweet ginger syrup. The less appealing part of Hei La Moon is how infrequent some of the carts with the popular dishes (ha cheung comes to mind immediately) make the rounds such that they are out by the time they actually reach your table or you might have to track down the carts on your own if you need to. Occasionally, you will need to split a table with another party, so be prepared. Also, be aware that some of the servers cannot speak English and even Cantonese sometimes, so bring a friend who knows some rudimentary Cantonese and/or Mandarin.

I first read the reviews on yelp but decided to give it a try because it is close to my house. First off I am surprised to read all the reviews regarding the tip being added on to the bill. If you read the coupon it cl;early states to present the coupon before ordering-which i imagine is to allow the server to explain the coupon and it clearly states an 18% gratuity is added pre-discount. I have worked in the restaurant business a long time and enjoy eating out to experience new places to eat as well as pay attention to the service if only to provide better service to my guests.\\n\\nI initially called to make a reservation and was informed that because they are a small restaurant they do not take reservations for dinner but were very pleasant and willing to take down my information so they could try to accomodate us as quick;y as possible. I went out on a Thursday night at 7pm and fully expected there to be a decent amount of people out to eat.\\n\\nAs far as I could tell there wasn't a hostess but instead I was greeted and seated by a perfectly pleasant waitress that was happy to seat my boyfriend and I in a booth for 4 instead of a 2 top. The restaurant itself is small and the decor is a bit dated but quite cozy and comfortable. The lights are low with candles on the tables that create an intimate and warm effect. The tables are quite small-especially the tables of 2 and the dining room isn't very big either so the tables tend to be close together.\\n\\nUpon being seated, our waitress immediately offered to hang our coats and umbrellas to dry as it was a rainy night. She returned right away with a water pitcher and introduced herself. That night she also had a trainee so we were fortunate to have 2 servers attending to us. The trainee came over with delicious homemade and still warm bread with a wonderful tomato and garbanzo bean dip9I know this because after introducing herself she described the dip)\\n\\nWithin a few minutes both servers were at the table-making small talk-and asking if we would like any drinks while we looked over the menu. Upon delivering our drinks the main waitress informed us of the numerous additions to the menu from memory. She was happy to repeat and explain the entrees we were interested in. Also was quite pleased when she informed us that everything on the menu is made from scratch(nothing frozen or pre-prepared-how rare is that???) and that she would be happy to accomodate any requests for changes to our meals. \\n\\nI am a bit particular with what I eat but she was happy to modify my entree to suit my needs and also repeated the order back to me to ensure our orders were corrrect.\\n\\nWas happy she mentioned the portions are large and suggested we split a salad instead of getting two. We had the appetito salad which was split for us and was delicious. I am glad we had the salad because it did take 40 minutes from the time we ordered for our dinners to arrive. But, while we were waiting the girls continued to stop by the table, keep our waters full and entertain us a bit during our wait.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Sirloin Special that was cooked to perfection wioth spinach and shrimp topped with a delicious cheese fondue. I had the most lovely pumpkin flavored risottowith the sweetest scallops and served inside a pumpkin. We were checked on throughout our meal and completely enjoyed it.\\n\\nWe were offered coffee, espresso and dessert but just couldn't possibly eat another bite.

The pork is tender but low on flavor, not nearly as good as at Anna's Taqueria in Davis. Moreover, the burritos need more bright flavors and more salt - with the rice, beans and pork on the bland side, the salsa or veggies need a punch and brightness that they just don't have. A mediocre burrito, albeit with good texture. I also found it irritating that my sour cream (2tbs, at most) cost 1$.

The salad was nothing more than lettuce mix; calling it a salad is a travesty.  The chicken was a huge portion but overcooked, the rice/veggies were... food. The veggies were the best part of the chicken meal (we had no other choice).  Whipped cream does not make a brownie (which was actually German chocolate cake) ala mode.  \\n\\nThe set is pretty awesome and while extremely basic the show itself was entertaining enough.  We don't have kids but wanted to hit up a dinner show; this is definitely one for the kids and next time we will likely go to a murder mystery.  If you want to drink, expect it to cost you a fair bit (you have to buy a souvenir glass for your first mixed drink.. at a large premium of course).\\n\\nNo one pulled me in to take a picture as I walked in, but have you ever been to any tourist trap?  They do the same thing at every amusement park in the world.  \\"No thanks\\" works just fine.\\n\\nYes, it sounds like a bad experience.... but I felt like it was appropriately priced for a tourist show and that I had gotten what I paid for.

The tortillas were actually hard and crunchy as if they microwaved them too much.  The server inquired how our meal was and I said way too spicy but he just walked away.

Finally, my husband went to ask if we could order (but really, to remind them that we were even there). It still took another 5 minutes or so for our server to come over, with no apology.

Again, the restaurant was NOT busy. \\n\\nThis would have been less annoying if the food was good. Everything was dry and overlooked.

Went to China pearl for years and saw the ship sinking for years so I had to find a new gem.  Their Shu Mai are easily the best, much bigger and succulent with black mushroom.

I must say that when you hear you choose what you want on your pizza or calzone for only $6.99, I was expecting a Cici's type pizza. Was I ever mistaken. As others have said, it is a Subway type line to make the pizza, but the results about 10 minutes later are quite different. Every item that you choose for your pizza is fresh, including the vegetables. Their cheese choices are mouth watering. The crust is a New York style thin crust that also has an excellent flavor. And the best part is there is no limit as to what you put on the pizza. My wife and I have been there a few times now and cannot tell enough of our friends to try it out as well. Their concept is simple, thus the low price. Trust me when I say you will not be disappointed. We will be back next time with some more friends.

It was definitely a sandwich I had to eat with a knife and fork but oh so tasty.

I was saddened when each night I would drive by the line was literally outside and around the corner.\\nIt is surprising how many people pour into this building each night. It is in such huge demand it made me very more curious about the soup.\\n\\nThen I found out they were serving lunch and this is when I got lucky enough to dine here. The decor is simple and rustic; they have counter service and a limited menu for lunch. Do not let this detour you, it is worth it. Once I placed my order, I sat at a table and was quickly served my lunch. The broth was flavorful and steaming hot. \\nI was offered a soft-boiled egg but skipped it since I have an aversion to under cooked egg. Everyone else that ordered it seemed to love it. So if that's your thing you might want to make sure you add it.  I made sure to ask for extra garlic and to my surprise, I was given a garlic press and fresh garlic to season my soup. \\nThe soup was great but just a little on the salty side and honestly, I prefer it that way. It might not suit everyone's taste. I do think I need to return for dinner to be able to give a more robust review. I will make sure to to try to get this done ASAP."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Never disappointed!

When we arrived at 7:25 on a Monday (for a 7:30 reservation), it was packed.  The maitre d tried to seat us in an empty room in the back, and was noticeably agitated when we asked to be seated  somewhere else.   (There was a table for us by 7:30, and by 7:45 the place was half empty).  The waiter didn't explain how the menu was organized, or the specials, until well after drinks came out and after we had already spent 10 minutes deciding what the order.  Drinks came out sporadically.  By the time we left there were only a handful of people and the busboy was vacuuming near our table.  (Bad, bad, bad.  That should never happen under any circumstances).  \\n\\nThe food was done well, but the style was very old school.  Big portions, not creative, and heavy on the starch.  And the prices are very high in light of the standard fair and quality.  (One  main dish was $37, and our crab cakes were $27).  \\n\\nOh, and they didn't have any crawfish.  Isn't that false advertising?"},{"name":"Bisq","address":"1071 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Very chill place.\\nWe really enjoyed counter seating and our interactions with the chefs.\\nThe steak tartare was one of the best I have ever had.\\nIt comes on a grilled sourdough with horseradish and sun chokes.

Well, I'm less understanding of the service side issues now. I think waiting an hour and a half to have dinner is okay IF either the food is prefect or the service is spectacular. \\n\\nThe service is often slow and stuttering. The last few times we had the famous fried chicken, the three pieces were stacked on top of each other and the middle piece was tough and overcooked. \\n\\nEvery single time. \\n\\nThat makes me think that they are plating early and letting the food sit and the middle piece of chicken is getting overcooked by the heat from the top piece and the bottom piece of chicken. A huge bummer and completely unnecessary! Just don't stack the chicken and you're good. Or don't let the plate sit out so that the chicken continues to cook!\\n\\nBecause, you know. Meat continues to cook as it rests. This is something you can learn from culinary school. Or an episode of Top Chef. \\n\\n4 stars because we still find ourselves going back. But my level of excitement has tapered.

My mind is still reeling from the experience.  It's a HUGE conference-center-like space packed with tables for 10, 6, 4, 2... Very little wait time. Every corner is filled and not every corner is accessible or accessed or ever seen by those rolling steam and flame filled carts.. I missed several apps that I would have loved to have had..\\n\\nWhen you enter, it's nuts. Give the lady at the front the number of your group and they'll just start calling you by number, not by name.. I did like the fact that they had tables for two.\\n\\nThis place isn't for shy people.  You gotta know a thing or two about what you're ordering because it's not easy to understand what's being offered without a menu and without servers who can deliver the ingredients to you in language that you can understand.  Best approach: ask waiters stuff like, \\"is that shrimp?\\" rather than \\"what is that?\\"\\n\\nBut I was successful in receiving a total of 5 dishes.  I was 5 for 5 in terms of food I would have ordered anyway, including (not the Cantonese version): \\n + soybean braised oxtail with rice noodle, \\n + braised pork/shrimp wrapped in bean curd, \\n + steamed shrimp dumpling in like a rice wrapper,  \\n + u-choy (greens), \\n + shrimp and chives fried dumpling.  \\n\\nWhat I would have liked that I didn't get but saw from afar: \\n + congee w/ thousand year egg\\n + pan fried turnip cake\\n + soup dumpling\\n + other pork dumpling\\n\\nLessons learned in one visit: get up and follow the carts and grab what you want? (asking nicely of course).  I saw the same four carts about 5 times, but didn't see the dishes that I really wanted.. ever.  So, ask for what you want.  Pay at the front.  Come with as little as two peeps and as many as 10!

The workers are very approachable and friendly; as we were deciding flavors, the person assisting us made sure to clarify which were vegan/had gluten/used dairy, and although my boyfriend and I do not have dietary restrictions I know it would have been super helpful to those that do! And, while I paid for a mini scoop, the worker gave me a very generous portion haha, so you definitely get your money's worth! \\nOverall, our experience was great, the store is adorable and fun to take pictures in, and the ice cream is yummy! My only problem would be parking, as street side can be difficult on busy days, and the parking garage nearby charges $12! Of course, it's to be expected as the store is nearby Lake Eola, so I would try to come early in the morning or during a lazy afternoon :)"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Perfectly smoked and pulled pork lends to both great texture and flavor.

After an hour of waiting, we were seated outside in a cute garden area and we ordered our food; however, it was another hour before our food arrived. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles after reading about how good it was, and hoped that it would live up to the hype after waiting for so long. After taking one bite, I understood instantly why people raved about this dish. The seasoning on the fried chicken was delicious and tasted unlike any fried chicken I've had; however, my boyfriend thought it was too overpowering, and I agreed after eating it for a while, but I still thought it was so good! The waffle was also delicious and complemented the flavor of the chicken perfectly. However, I ate too much too quickly and felt stuffed, so I would HIGHLY recommend sharing this dish with another person. I ended up taking half of it as leftovers, which was still delicious the next day.\\n\\nOverall, Screen Door deserves 4.5 stars, half taken off for the long wait times which made me enjoy the experience of the restaurant less than I would have otherwise. I would recommend everyone to try this place once, but I'd only want to come back when there's not as long of a wait."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

That is a fatty piece of meat but the fat is nearer to the bone and ends of the rib.  BBQ sauce was tangy and just right. Collard greens were pretty good, but I don't have much of a frame of reference as I only really get them from one other place. The Frito Pie is simply delicious as well.\\n\\nYeah, Fox Bros is absolutely 100% worth the hype."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Not the best place in my opinion. The steak was good and I've heard good things about the secret burger, but the portions on most of the dishes are waaaaay too small for the price you pay. I went with a friend and we each got the steak and split a rabbit dish and still left hungry (after paying $40 each, before tip). The steak portion was alright but the chicken fried rabbit or whatever was literally the size of my thumb (not worth $15 just for that if you ask me) and tasted like a breaded pork chop. They also had the gall to charge $15 for a single square of ravioli.

The tacos and quesadillas were soggy and dripped lime juice and watery salsa all over the place, the bottom of the taco was falling through because of this. The rice was meh and the black beans lacked flavour. Portions are pretty mediocre and plate presentation looked sloppy and honestly, a little depressing.\\n\\nFor $16-18 entrees, I was hoping to be impressed but was left hungry and unfulfilled.\\n\\nALSO, the restaurant uses these super uncomfortable, creaky school chairs. For a $$ restaurant, please invest in proper seating! Where the heck is the money going?
