The place was not busy at all when we arrived a little before 7.   It quickly filled up as the evening progressed.  The inside is spacious enough that it doesn't get too loud on the inside when it's full.  There are plenty of tvs with sports playing scattered around the place.\\n\\nThey bring out a platter of pork rinds to your table shortly after sitting down.  They were a big hit with our group and the server kept bringing us more.  I'm not a fan of pork rinds so I didn't try them out.\\n\\nWe started off with two orders of the mini sausage corndogs for the table to share.  They are served on a stick with the Carolina gold mustard sauce for dipping.  The corndogs were pretty good and I liked the mustard sauce.  It went nicely with the sausage.  This was actually the best thing I ate during the meal.\\n\\nI went with the pulled pork sandwich and baked beans for my meal.  The sandwich comes with coleslaw on top of the pork.  Our table had some of the savory sauce and Carolina gold sauce in jars.  I put the savory sauce on my sandwich.  It's a sweeter barbecue sauce, which I like.  The pork itself was just ok.  It definitely needed a lot of the sauce to make it taste good.  The baked beans were just meh.  One thing that was slightly annoying was that we didn't realize they had a large number of different sauces on one of the side tables.  We got through most of our meal before realizing this.  A few others at the table sampled some of the other sauces and really liked them.  So, if you go, check out the sauce bar before starting your meal.  You can get a variety other than the two that they put on the table.\\n\\nThe peanut butter pie piqued my interest so I ordered it for dessert.  It was very peanut buttery.  I really like peanut butter pie, but this was probably my least favorite of the ones I've eaten.  A friend ordered the banana pudding.  It was served with strawberries (?!?) and looked like baby food.  I didn't actually try any because the consistency did not look appealing to me.  I have no clue if it was any good or not.\\n\\nService was good and friendly.  We did have a small hiccup when two of the people at our table were served each other's food.  They were halfway through their meals before they realized the mix up.  The food runners did not know who ordered what so it was a bit of chaos when the food started coming out.  They should know who ordered what and put it at the right place without having to ask us.\\n\\nThe best thing about this place is the parking.  It has ample parking so you won't have to hunt any down."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The location is obviously very nice, and I feel like you are paying to be on the water more than for the food itself.

We tried three main courses and three sides.  Overall the experience was disappointing.  \\n\\nI don't know anything about their cooking methods, but from eating at many BBQ places in my day, I can take some guesses.  The meats were smoked.  To me this is usually a good thing, but the Rib House smoking process seems a little off...I can't quite put my finger on what is wrong...maybe it is the type of wood, maybe it is the smoker, maybe they don't smoke for the entire cooking process, but something was not right and it was consistently not right for all three meats we tried.  The flavor was TOO TOO SMOKY...the crust was minimal except for the boneless beef ribs, where it was more of a burn than a char (there is a difference).\\n\\nWe ordered Tracy's Famous Illegal Baby Back Ribs:  these were not good.  No carmelization or crust on the ribs.  They were tender, but there was still a lot of nasty connective tissue between the bones which caused me to question whether they smoke for a short period of time and use some other quick tenderization method like pressure cooking to do most of the cooking (which will not disintegrate the connective tissue like the traditional low and slow 24 hour smoking method will).  It there was a rub on the ribs it was not prominent.\\n\\nWe tried Mike's Turkey Leg:  my wife loves turkey legs, so we had high hopes for this.  It was actually TOO TENDER.  She grabbed the leg and it fell completely off the bone.  Like the ribs, the bone was white and there was still a lot of tough connective tissue in the meat, suggesting pressure cooking or boiling was involved in the preparation.  The leg was really smoky.  Again, too smoky and not in a good way.  The skin was not crispy.  Bummer.\\n\\nThe Boneless Beef Ribs were probably the best of the three meats, but also not good.  Burned to a crisp on top, too smoky, adequately tender.  Not much else to say about these.\\n\\nThe sauces were ho-hum.  We had the XXX and the medium.  The medium had no tang.

If facing Trader Joe's, Ah-Ma's is to the left in the space formerly occupied by Rice Box. The restaurant is a small, family-owned business that serves authentic Taiwanese street food. It didn't take long for this place to become popular.\\n\\nWith a limited seating capacity of roughly 20, don't be surprised if there's a wait during your visit. The dining room has a long table that seats 12 (often used communally), a few smaller tables that can be moved around, and three booths. The interior has simple, modern decor highlighted by Oriental light fixtures, bamboo plants, and a beautiful cherry blossom mural. A narrow opening in the mural allows customers a peek inside the kitchen.\\n\\nAh-Ma's has a simple menu featuring small plates (snacks), soups, bao (buns), and rice plates. Most dishes are only $3-5 each, though there are some exceptions such as the beef noodle soup, braised oxtail, and Jade Tofu, which are priced between $10-14 each. This is a great place to order several different types of dishes to try. Bao might be the quintessential Taiwanese street food. Ah-Ma's has five different varieties of bao including traditional pork belly (gua bao), fried chicken, slow-braised beef tongue, tofu veggie, and shrimp.\\n\\nI've eaten through quite a bit of the menu. Here's what I've tried so far:\\n\\nSnacks (good for sharing):\\nCup Sticky Rice - sticky rice, pork, dried baby shrimp, black mushrooms\\nFried frog legs with thinly chopped scallions\\nTaiwanese chicken nuggets with five spice\\nFried pig ear strips with chopped scallions\\nXiang Chang - Taiwanese sausage with thinly sliced garlic\\nCaul Fat Roll - caul fat, chicken, fish paste, onion, housemade sweet chili sauce\\nEgg Pancake Roll - flour tortilla, egg, scallion, pickled daikon radish\\n\\nSoups:\\nBeef Noodle Soup - slow-cooked flank steak, pickled mustard greens, scallions, vegetables\\n\\nBao:\\nPork Belly Bao - pork belly, pickled mustard greens, cilantro, crushed sweet peanuts\\nDirty Bird Bao - Taiwanese fried chicken cutlet, housemade wasabi aioli, pickled daikon radish and carrot\\n\\nRice dishes (also good for sharing):\\nLu Rou Fan - slow-cooked minced pork over steamed rice with egg and pickled daikon radish\\nJade Tofu - fried egg tofu, straw mushroom, Chinese vegetables\\n\\nIn general, I think the food here is quite tasty. It's hard to pick out favorites because every dish tastes good. However, I do favor the frog legs, pig ears, and Dirty Bird bao.\\n\\nThe Cup Sticky Rice gets its name from how the rice is served -- it's in the mold of a cup. The rice comes with a savory sauce plus pork, dried shrimp, mushrooms, and a bit of cilantro. The best way to eat this dish is to mix all of the ingredients together.\\n\\nThe frog legs, Taiwanese chicken nuggets, and pig ears are all similar because they're deep-fried. All are crispy, nicely seasoned, and flavorful. Two frog legs come with each order. There's not a whole lot of meat on each frog leg, but what little there is \\"tastes like chicken.\\" The light breading on each leg is delightful.\\n\\nIf you've ever had the chicken nuggets at Quickly or Sweet Hut, Ah-Ma's chicken nuggets are the same thing. The addictive little morsels are garnished with crisp fried basil leaves. It's hard to go wrong with these, along with the egg pancake roll, and I think even the simplest of palates will enjoy them.\\n\\nThe fried pig ear strips are tastier than they sound. Crispy, crunchy, and sometimes chewy, I can easily envision eating these out of a bag like potato chips. You can see the deep-fried coats of fat mixed in with the batter, which is one reason why these things are delectable. It's kind of like eating some variant of bacon and chicharron (pork rinds).\\n\\nThe Taiwanese sausage is basic. One link is served per order with sliced raw garlic. There is no seasoning on the sausage. All of the flavor is in the sausage itself.\\n\\nAs adventurous of an eater as I am, I can't say I'm a huge fan of the caul fat roll. Caul fat is the membrane which covers the stomach. In this case, I believe it's pork. It has the same unique and unpleasant odor/finish as intestine and should be considered an acquired taste. It's not bad, so if you want to try something new, go for it.\\n\\nThe beef noodle soup is hearty. The broth is rich with tender chunks of flank and thick yet soft noodles.\\n\\nThe baos are excellent. If you've never had Taiwanese bao before, go with the classic pork belly bao. The Dirty Bird bao is pretty much perfect to me. The ingredient combination is superb. I really enjoy the wasabi aioli.\\n\\nThe rice dishes are comfort food. The Lu Rou Fan is served in a bowl while the Jade Tofu is served on a plate. The ingredients are simply fresh and delicious from the pickled yellow daikon in the Lu Rou Fan to the supple Chinese mushrooms and green baby bok choy in the Jade Tofu. All around good stuff.\\n\\nService is terrific.

I placed my order with the woman at the end of the line and she radio'd it to someone else. But that was kind of pointless because someone else took over and asked me what I wanted again. I picked the two entree combo with a side of chow mein. For my entrees I selected the orange chicken and the grilled teriyaki chicken. \\n\\nThe orange chicken didn't have a ton of flavor and it didn't appear to be white meat. It also had a weird flavor and texture, as if something was a bit off with it. If you want good orange chicken, cough up $100+ to buy a ticket and go to China in Epcot. The grilled teriyaki chicken had a good flavor with the sauce they drizzled on but again, not white meat. Maybe they should offer both a white and dark version for people who prefer one or the other.\\n\\nTheir prices aren't unreasonable but they bill themselves as \\"America's favorite Chinese\\" or some such nonsense.

I promise, I have valid reason for such a bold statement. I've been baking and seeking out gluten free, vegan, nut and refined sugar free baked goods for almost 5 years now. \\n\\nSo we were super excited to give this bakery a shot. I didn't think I'd find a bakery so close that would be able to accommodate T Money's food allergies. But lo and behold, I come across Erin McKenna's on a website about Disney Springs. We were already going for dinner at T-Tex, so we thought we'd stop in for some treats after. \\n\\nWe finally find the storefront and walk in. It's small, with one refrigerated glass case and a small secretion of un-refrigerated baked goods next to it. The young man who was working behind the counter was less than pleasant retorted with irritated answers when being asked what's what. I mentioned we hadn't been here before so that there might be some understanding as to why I had to ask what items were, as the labels were non existent or the description on the tag was 3/4 of the way rubbed off.\\n\\nThere's a semi-decent selection in relation to the time of day and size of the storefront. Tea cakes, loaves of sweet bread, a few different types of cookies that looked like an amateur made, 3 different types of cupcakes as well as cupcake tops, a couple muffins and 3 or 4 different cake donuts. It was in the evening though, so it's easy to understand why the donuts and muffin selection is limited.\\n\\nSo we pick out a wide variety of things- chocolate dipped vanilla donut ($4.99), French Toastie cupcake ($4.95), chocolate frosted chocolate cupcake ($4.95), a chocolate mounds ($2.25), mocha frosted chocolate cupcake top and a cinnamon roll (five freaking dollars and 50 cents). We find a bench outside and dig in. I can't believe I paid $5.50 for a small, dry cinnamon roll. T, who loves decent baked goods, took the tiniest bite of the chocolate covered donut, looked at me, and didn't touch another thing out of the box. My mom said her French Toastie was also dry but the flavor was decent. The chocolate cupcakes were also dry and IMO, the frosting was lacking in flavor but the highlight of it all. The mocha frosting tasted just like chocolate with zero coffee notes coming through but on the upside, the chocolate frosting was decent- like I said, frosting was the highlight.\\n\\nI get people go to Disney Springs to drop money, and that it's a \\"specialty\\" bakery. I've done A LOT of baking myself, which included a lot of failure. Unfortunately, a few of my failures were reminiscent of what I tasted at Erin McKenna's. Vegan and gluten free baked goods don't have to be dry and lacking flavor. It doesn't mean that your cookies must overly spread due to improper ratios in the recipe. \\n\\nWhile I may come across as harsh, it's only because I'm very aware of what gluten free and vegan baked goods can be. And unfortunately, this is definitely not the best representation of it.\\n\\nI seriously am still in shock I paid $4 for one of the most unappetizing donuts I've ever had. Wtf. Seriously...

I went to a networking event at Level, had a delicious chocolate martini, and met some new people. As three of us who had just met were leaving, we realized we were hungry and decided to go over to Bakersfield. \\n\\nAt some point, one of the other two said he was going outside to smoke. Quite some time elapsed, and we kept wondering where he was. We kept chatting until we both were ready to leave. When giving our cards to pay, the bartender asked about the guy with us and we said he went to smoke and we had no idea where he was. \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes later I asked why we had not yet been cashed out, and I was told, \\"the other bartender said you told him you wanted to wait to cash out until your friend got back.\\" This, of course, was an extremely lame lie. We had said we had no idea when the guy was returning, and that we wanted to leave. I'm not sure what game that was supposed to be. We were then told we were responsible for his $50 bill. This resulted in a back-n-forth with us trying to explain that we didn't know this guy and simply were not going to pay for his bill. \\n\\nAfter a couple of minutes arguing with this lady (who was already pretty obnoxious and rude the whole time prior to this), we asked to speak to the manager.  When the manager came out, I was shocked by his attitude and the manner in which he spoke to us. He kept going on and on about how we were responsible for this other guy, repeatedly trying to outsmart us with *gotcha* comments and questions. I simply couldn't believe how this whole ordeal turned into some spectacle in the middle of the bar.  Being 38, I have to say I've never been talked to like some juvenile delinquent, and that is exactly how this whole debacle played out.  The manager's snide reply when we said we barely knew the guy and weren't responsible for him was that \\"well, you sure looked like you had a good time with him.\\"  When I asked if I was liable for the bill of other people sitting next to us at the bar--to whom we also spoke that evening--he seemed deflated a bit. Finally, the lady I was with literally started screaming at the manager to let us pay so we could leave. Eventually, it seems we wore him down and he reluctantly gave us our credit cards so we could leave (with continued attitude and commentary).\\n\\nFor the life of me, I cannot understand how people running a business think they can treat customers like this...especially ones who weren't drunk or rowdy or anything other than wanting to pay for what they ordered and go home."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Got Uber Eats delivery and this food is bomb!

They then proceeded to teach us some simple eating customs, and suggestions towards how to eat the food.\\n\\nWe started with the Gizzards (spicy but good) and the Vitumbua. I have never had Vitumbua before, and I was surprised by how tasty/flavorful rice can be! For our entrees, we tried the Peanut Butter Soup with Fufu and the Jollof Rice with Chicken. The Peanut Butter soup tasted nothing like peanut butter, but had a very complex taste with a savory spice. We used the Fufu to soak up the soup and scoop out the beef chunks. The chicken was super tender, and both my Fiancee and I ate all of the Jollof rice within minutes. \\n\\nOverall, this restaurant knocks it out of the park with their food and also provides a unique experience.

Clyde Common is reasonably priced (particularly at happy hour, 3.50 drafts) and comes with the bartender of my dreams.  I may not know his name, but I can say a liquor and have something delicious dropped in front of me--pure skill.\\n\\nThe real charm behind Clyde Common is all in the ambience.  Here we have a bar that is reasonably affordable and is perfectly comfortable for hanging out with friends or for an afternoon with visiting parents (Not to get them tanked, mind you.  Your parents don't need to know about your frat party ways.).\\n\\nHe may live on the west side of town but Clyde and I have forged a friendship that spans...well, it spans rivers, but the love is there."},{"name":"Schlotzsky's","address":"500 Canyon Ridge Dr, Bldg G","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Had a terrific meal here tonight.

You can enjoy it as an adult and the jokes will go over the kids heads, yet there are enough kid jokes that they will love it took.\\n\\nBut, I think there are faults and its not one I will be running back to until I have kids. You know, if it's still around by then. \\n\\nFirst, they really cram you in there. The tables have no room to move around them and the waiters are constantly having to push through. I had my camera backpack and had to keep it tucket nder my legs as there was no room to put it on the back of my chair between me and the guy behind me. Two full sized men will not really fit sitting back to back in most places. The tables are small and crowded by the fact the meal is served family style - which means you're adding even more plates to the plates you have to eat on. I was half temped to try and convince the family to chuck the plates until the table and just eat straight from the buckets.\\n\\nThey do have free sangria, beer, and house wine. The sangria is good, albeit primarily fruit juice, but you know, it's a fairly expensive meal so I'm going to drink what it comes with I suppose. Why not right? Refills are slow on drinks - I'm more talking water/tea, not that I'm downing my wine at Disney, but service is difficult with the waiters being so obviously overwhelemed by tables and a tiny space.\\n\\nI'd pass on the food. The cornbread is okay - I think I mostly ate that. The corn is fine too - I mean it's just corn. I didn't eat any of the meat - the ribs were fatty, overcooker, and bland, and I just don't do fried chicken. That's on me though honestly. Most of the food is just meh, and it is definitely not the reason you should be there.\\n\\nStrawberry shortcake was good, but it's not to die for like some people seem to think, but it's good enough. It's erved family style again, so someone is going to end up taking all the strawberries (hahaha! Never pass me the plate of fruits first)\\n\\nIt's a pretty cute show.

I notice a bag with her name but don't see mine - seems logical to hunt around to see if my bag is ready, too. I receive a rebuke about customers rummaging through the bags. I take my hands off bags but hang out front and center in front of the delivery area with my eye on each new bag. When mine came out they were able to pair it with hers, but nothing gave me the hint that they'd have the ability or inclination to connect the two bags placed under different names on the same order. Hell, Mighty Fine, if you don't want reasonable customers milling through the names on bags for their orders, take some freakin' responsibility to not create that chaos and confusion.

The halibut was served with a heavy sauce, as was the sweet breads - both have a very delicate flavor and the pairings ruined them.

Or would you rather sit inside and be even closer to all the stereotypes? Plus, given that the climate makes using a patio for most of the year a pretty unappealing prospect, Rontoms' major selling point only really works half of the year.\\n\\nIn spite of that, it's not the clientele or the lack of indoor seating that irks me about the bar. It's the bar's insistence on trying to be a live music venue. With its series of free weekend concerts during the summer, Rontoms puts forth a commendable effort. But like I said, the space is basically a warehouse that was equipped with a bar and a few 70s throwback sofas. There are few, if any, measures to enhance any sounds that might emanate from an amplifier. So when a musician like the Tallest Man on Earth plays his acoustic guitar, the typically warm and soft timber sounds tinny and out of place. Conversely, a much louder band's acoustics get super loud in the drums and guitars, but you can't hear the vocals or anything else. To top off that aural irritation, the live music happens in a sunken part of the floor instead of a stage. Hi, band, let me peer down at you like you're busking on the bottom steps of a bus station.

The seating can be a little odd so i wouldn't recommend a group bigger than 4 (6 at most as there are only 6 booths that seem to accommodate that many peeps).\\n\\nThe menu at first was an over-zealous attempt at a seafoody reputation but it failed to deliver on anything other than the oysters (which I've been told are quite tasty).  The refinement just wasn't there (indeed, the fried food do lack flavor at time).\\n\\nBut i will say that if you live in the area (Grant Park, Cabbage Town, Reynoldstown) that means that \\"low-budget photo shoots\\" and \\"homeless guys with funyans\\" (sp?) come with the territory and - dare i say - are the personality of the nachbarschaft (that's German for neighborhood - you learned something today!

There are apparently Groupon and other deals floating around so this place was packed around dinner time. We could tell because the other diners had wine bottles (which was included in our Groupon deal).\\n\\nYou first start off by picking how well done you want your meat to be. You will be given a card according to your preference. Food will come around to you, and you can either opt to have a sampling or pass. The servers will make sure to bring out meats that are cooked according to your preference. \\n\\nThere were all sorts of cuts: rib eye, fillet mignon, garlic steak, the house special, etc. The non-steak items included chicken wrapped in bacon, lamb, pork ribs (delicious), and chicken hearts. For the chicken hearts for instance, you have to request it so that an order is put in. The cheese rolls were delicious! Sadly you can only obtain some from the servers when they're maneuvering around the tables. There was also an extensive salad bar with pastas and such items. \\n\\nThe Crane Lake wine was good. For the amount of meat you're going to consume, sharing this bottle of wine with another person won't do anything. Even though I had a little less than half of the wine, my guy friend and I were super fine after leaving the restaurant. Granted we chilled a little bit with coffee and dessert, but still, do enjoy some wine with your meal as the red meat will soak up all the alcohol. Oh. You can't opt to get one expensive wine versus two separate ones. For this, you cannot alter the coupon deal. You just have to choose two wines under $40. You can def take the other one home though so it's not at a loss.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere here was okay. The inside was def much more fancy versus the locale of the restaurant. This would be a nice place for a special occasion dinner. The service was friendly. The servers came by pretty often with food. If you're stuffed, just flipped your card over so the \\"No thank you\\" side is showing. The quality was okay. It wasn't ranked high with the other Brazilian places as my friend and his parents stated. And by the way, if you're using a coupon, the tax will be based off of the pre-coupon price.

I have a soft spot for spicy seafood noodle soup and I must order it when I see it on the menu, no matter where and when, so that was my first experience with Lily's.  Unfortunately, the soup was a bit of a disappointment... some of the taste profile was there, but it was somewhat watered down and not quite complete if that makes sense... Luckily, my smart friend who realized that the owners were Indonesians, ordered an Indonesian item - Balacan fried rice with chicken.  Tasting his food turned my disappointment into new hope as the rice was so very delicious with a smokey, well-seasoned, mysterious and complex flavor that was different from any other typical chinese fried rice I ever tasted!  So the next time we visited, I went with their Indonesian offering, Ran Dang - think slow cooked marinated, saucy roast beef chunks.  I don't quite know what kind of primary spice they use in their marinade and sauce, but boy, Ran Dang is a winner!  The meat may appear hard, but it pulls apart very easily and is very well infused with awesome flavor.  I like to mix the hot sauce they give you in a little container with the rice to make my dish more spicy.  Portion size is large and justifies the price (around $11-12).  Another successful dish I tried was the marinated fried steak which again looks a bit dry, but, the meat just falls right apart with a fork and is absolutely delicious!  This dish comes with a side of tofu curry that I like to pour over my rice - this not only adds mosture to the sauce-less entree, but also adds another level of complexity to the flavor.  Their Thai Curry is also a winner - it's a little more gingery and sharp than typical, but it has nicely balanced and deep flavor.  Love it!  I  think that Lily's could benefit from de-diversifying their menu and just concentrating on what they do so well - Indonesian and Thai offerings... The chinese offerings and other noodle dishes I tried there have been just ok... if not below average.  I haven't tried their sushi rolls, so I can't speak for those items.  \\nLastly, be sure to pick up their punch card - 15% off carry out orders with each punch and when full, you can get a second entree for half off."},{"name":"Cavino","address":"Residence Inn Vancouver Downtown, 1234 Hornby Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The food was great.

Over the winter while out with her family she visited Wagamama in the Prudential Center.  Upon coming home she eagerly told me about her experience and how she believed she found a suitable replacement.    \\n\\nFriday afternoon we decided to have a pre-Valentine's Day lunch at Wagamama in the Prudential Center's \\"Fashion Court.\\"  Through the large plate glass windows diners can be seen sitting at long, simple, IKEA style, blonde color tables chowing down on elaborate noodle or with their faces in large soup dishes.  \\n\\nThe waitstaff here is mostly college-aged sporting modern day haircuts, tattoos, piercings and bright red t-shirts with black slacks or skirts.  Once seated at your table waiters will begin taking drink orders on Palm devices and ask if you have any questions.  They'll explain how the menu is broken up into different sections, that everything is made to order and sometimes entrees may arrive before appetizers. \\n\\nFor my visits I decided to start with deep-fried duck dumplings and for an entree have the ginger chicken udon teppan noodles.  The dumplings were very tasty, packed a lot of flavor but were smaller than I expected.  Five dumplings just isn't enough to satisfy and I was left wanting more.  However, the main entree was a large mound of thick noodles intertwining with various other colorful vegetables.  At first impression the noodles are so thick and slightly chewy I thought they were undercooked but I soon realized it was a different style of noodle I had never tried.  Slivers of ginger, bean sprouts and red onion enhance the flavor of chucks of white chicken.  The portion was very large and I honestly wish I came in a smaller size.  I didn't take the remainder home and felt bad that the rest had to go to waste.              \\n\\nService here is very good, everyone works together as a team and food moves quickly throughout the restaurant.

I'd always wanted to go back and finally made a reservation when the 30% discount for AP holders was announced. Our reservation was for 8:40 and when we arrived we were told things were running about 20 minutes late. We enjoyed a delicious and refreshing cocktail called the Victoria Fall Mist while waiting.\\n\\nAfter being seated we were offered warm, rosewater-scented towels which was a nice touch. We ordered another cocktail to share, the Jungle Punch, which we ended up not liking quite as much as the first one, but it was still good. The complimentary rolls came with a fennel citrus butter that was incredible. We also ordered the wild boar tenderloin and summer corn soup as appetizers. The presentation of the soup was fun because they set down the plate first with the pork belly, poached egg, and herb jam artfully arranged, then poured the corn soup over the top. And it wasn't just a measly cup of soup but a whole pitcher. We loved the soup and couldn't stop raving about it all night. The boar was amazing too. Very tender and flavorful. We enjoyed the African-inspired spices in both dishes. If the meal had ended after just the appetizers this would've been a 5 star rating.\\n\\nWe weren't quite as happy with our entrees, which were the Durham Ranch elk loin and the Karubi barbecue pork ribs. At our server's recommendation, we ordered the elk medium rare. The way it was prepared, the outer edges of the loin were dry but the middle was nice and tender. With the different textures there was a lot going on in each bite. If I was to have elk again I'd probably try ordering it rare. The celery root puree was a nice accompaniment to the dish. I'm glad we tried the elk because it's something different and unique, and even though I didn't love it I'm happy with the choice. The pork ribs were the most disappointing dish. The rub and the sauce on the ribs was good, but it couldn't make up for the meat being too tough and dry. What they call \\"Jiko slap chips\\" on the menu ended up being roasted potatoes. It was a huge portion of food, but nothing really wowed us or left us craving for more. I understand they were going for an African take on BBQ, but the ribs, beans, and potatoes combined were too heavy of a meal for a fine dining restaurant. They'd be better off pulling back here and giving a smaller quantity of higher quality food.\\n\\nSince we didn't love our entreees as much as the appetizers, we felt a little let down at the end of the meal. We skipped desserts, but were given a couple complimentary chocolate cookies which made for a nice ending food-wise. But we were left on a sour note because after dropping off the check our server disappeared on us. We started talking and realized that throughout the meal our server hadn't checked on us once to ask how the food was or if we needed anything else. Usually service at Disney is super attentive, so I presume our server was just having an off night.

There is a bar on the right rear wall and seating everywhere.  Groups of all sizes will find someplace to sit without a problem.  To the left of the entrance is a shopping area to buy all sorts of Joe's stuff with funny sayings.  The restaurant appeared very clean.\\n\\nStaff:  our waitress was friendly and personable.  She did a decent job of checking up on us, though wasn't the best.\\n\\nFood:  we ordered calamari for an appetizer and it was very good.  We didn't expect the amount of calamari we would receive, so we were pleasantly surprised.  My girlfriend ordered the fish and chips and loved it.  I ordered the fish and clams and didn't like the fish.  I have no idea what kind of fish it was, but it just didn't taste good.  It was a different type than what the girlfriend ordered.  The clam strips were good though.  Our portions were huge so we weren't able to finish our plates and took it home.\\n\\nOverall, this is a chain fish restaurant in the middle of the nation (read:  far from the ocean).  If you have a hankering for seafood and don't have many options, it's an okay place to go.  If you have other options (that aren't chain) you may want to check those out first."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely love this place!

I was exhausted as it was 12:30am and starving so decided on going to WaHo before hitting the hwy to head home. I walked into an empty Restaruant and decided to sit at the bar as no one was there. I was greeted with attitude by Asia the waitress which stood up claiming me as her server. I smiled and sat, instantly feeling awkward by the unwarranted rudeness she gave me right off the bat. She proceeded to take my order as well as the gent's order that was with me. I noticed she rolled her eyes at me when I gave her my drink order and after that decided I would not be looking her in the eyes moving forward. Well next thing I know my dude comments on how nasty she was being to him and at that point I couldn't take it anymore and decided to leave this review. It was almost comical how nasty and outright rude she treated us throughout the entire meal. I even heard her coworker say offhandedly to her, \\"your attitude...\\" Never have I felt more uncomfortable during a meal than I did at the Waffle House on windy hill. The food was good but the service was terrible. Needless to say Asia should NOT be in the service industry.

So of course he tried it and gave it the thumbs up. Our shawarma was really good and it had tzatziki in it so I probably shouldn't have ordered the tzatziki appetizer because the sandwich combo also came with hummus, which was also delicious.

It started with a light drizzle turning into torrential down pour which isn't Disney's fault but when you go to the entrance and they are packing up the equipment to check people in so you go the the front doors. Only to be told to grab a buzzer. You go back in the rain and they tell you to go inside. I always wanted to know what wearing wet clothing straight out of the washing machine felt like. Once seated a restaurant that took us months to get a reservation at was practically dead. Although with that being the case you would think that the service would be a touch faster but it took almost 15 minutes from being sat to receive our drinks. The server was helpful in our dinner selections.  I had the sauteed chicken breast with macaroni gratin and green beans. The macaroni was on point as good as any homemade baked macaroni you'd find at a neighborhood bbq. The rest of it unfortunately was drastically under seasoned and over cooked. This being disappointing because it cost a shocking $24 which is a tad high for a chicken dish at Disney. My wife had the shrimp and scallops in puff pastry. Which had promise but it was as well over cooked and under seasoned.  The lobster cream sauce that it came with was less lobster flavor and more like raw wine with no cream. This dish was $27 and for a couple of scallops  and shrimp not that impressive. Stick to lunch if you want to dine here.  As for decorating Disney is always fantastic. I can't help but feel like I'm dining in a fancy school cafeteria. I've eaten at quite a few of Disney's restaurants and this was my worst experience to date. Also what I forgot to mention is know what time the fireworks go off.

Well, for the most part the staff is ok, excluding a couple of episodes i'll get into that wont be too \\"tasty\\",  too savory, unfortunately. Now that i've made that perfectly clear, i do wish that this review site would have a separate rating heading for service/staff. I wont give the place a 2 or three because bagels have feelings too.I used to go to a certain bagel shop in Chelsea some will know of w/o mentioning by name. This blows them out out of the water. Not much i can add to the amen chorus here, the breakfast bagels, the specialty sandwiches are in a class of thier own for this area. The prices also leave you smiling when you leave, this is rare, old fashioned value that you hardly find nowadays. Have been going to this place for a year now, always thru the drive thru. As everybody knows, most of the time you have to camp out and hunker down for the long haul. Going thru virtually every post, i wondered why nobody brought up one of my service function beefs; no speaker system ordering. Someone help me if i'm way off w/ this criticism, but it seems downright primitive not to have one. I'm amazed. Now i realize they can garble speech and so on, but it seems things would move a little faster, wouldn't they? Yelling out a car window while the order taker sticks his/her head out seems very ungainly, gauche. I have no idea what a system would cost, but if the lack of one helps keep prices down to the value they provide here, i can live w/ it. Ok, now to the staff. Having read the reviews i can see the breakdown is a mixed bag.Most of the time they maintain a decent attitude in spite of the maddening crowd they face every day. Others, not so much. Others make you seem like you're a bother and are glad you're gone, so i'm blind to thier tip jar! Seems this group comes as a tribe, most seem to know each other and i think that many of them moonlight together at another business, i wont mention, just sayin'. I have never been rude or nasty during any of the times i've had to wait in the penance line at BW, so this episode puzzles me. I'm always business like. Can someone explain to me the reason that while waiting at the window interminably,  after staring straight ahead, i turned and glanced at the  woman bring my order and she SPAT in the trash bucket while thinking i did not see her? I realize that every culture has its odd idiosyncricies, but cmon', wrong place, wrong time. I can also attest to the fact as many have said, that the staff seems to spend an inordinate amount of time in chat n' horseplay while Rome burns. A suggestion would be that the low tech answer to no speaker ordering they occasionally use, namely, one of them pops out and approaches the first 4 or 5 cars to get orders, be used more frequently.

And, \\"Clyde Common\\" is no exception. The menu here changes daily and it features locally grown and raised quality ingredients. There are lots of vegetarian options. And, everything is prepared with an understated level of perfection.\\n\\nThree of us dined here last night for my birthday (yay me!!) and all of us were very happy with the choice. I started with a wonderful glass of the \\"Charles Jouget Chinon Rose\\" and it was perfectly dry and had a wonderful (and unusual) floral nose. Fantastic focaccia bread with the most flavorful olive oil was brought to the table.... and we practically inhaled it.\\n\\nFor an appetizer I had the \\"Seared Stone Fruits with Mead, Mushrooms (well, I had them omit those.... yuck), Cabot Cheddar, and Hazelnuts\\". The fruit was perfectly ripe and the quick sear brought out its juicy sweetness. The cheddar (if that was cheddar) actually tasted more like a creme fraise. And,the hazelnuts were ground to a fine power (surprise). The mead was a perfect flavor enhancer and I enjoyed this dish. I tried my son's \\"Radicchio Salad\\" and found the balance of slightly bitter greens with candied walnuts, ch√®vre, and sherry vinaigrette to be wonderful.\\n\\nFor my entree I chose the \\"Beet Green and Ricotta Ravioli with Corn, And Summer Vegetable Pur√©e\\". Those pasta pockets were just the right density,but I found the filling to be a bit heavy on the greens and light on the ricotta. I would have preferred the flavors to be more balanced. My son's \\"Steak with Marinated Tomatoes, Padrons, Buffalo Mozarella, Grilled Bread, and Basil\\" was as beautiful to look at as it was delicious to eat. That steak was tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. And, our friend's  \\"Salmon, Summer Squash, Black Rice, Torpedo Onion, and Bay Scallop\\" was another lovely and tasty dish! The side we shared of \\"Creamed Summer Greens\\" was delicate and flavorful. When a 15 year old boy practically licks a vegetable plate clean, you know it's got to be good.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and efficient. But, what makes this a 4 star rather than 5 for me (apart from the couple of flavor tweaks on the dishes I ordered) were the noise level (it's very, very loud and echoey inside) and the seating practice. This place doesn't take reservations. You go in, give your name, and wait. Then you're seated at long tables with other diners (which is all fine). They pace the seating to keep things running smoothly in the small (open) kitchen (which is also fine and understandable) , but it leads to many  to many, open seats and lots of people standing around waiting and wondering why (I asked). I think it would be better to have fewer seats at each table (they were placed very close together). That way people waiting wouldn't look at empty areas, people sitting would not be squished next to empty chairs, and the kitchen would still run smoothly. Just my suggestion. Still....

Kinda pricey - a little bit more expensive  than what I think is appropriate.  -Dirkie\\n\\nAs stated before, the advertised price is a bit much.  However, you've already spent thousands of dollars to come to Disney World, so a few more dollars won't make much of a difference.  The food here is average, however the way it's delivered and the atmosphere and talent are what you're really paying for.  The comedienne actresses are very VERY funny!  Be sure to make a reservation beforehand (months beforehand, if possible) by calling the Disney Dine Line, or booking it online.  Don't expect the food immediately - there's about a 30 minute pre-show before you are served.  Save room for the best strawberry shortcake EVER!  Be sure to tell the Disney folks what you're there to celebrate, because the characters will interact (and embarrass the heck out of) those who are celebrating.

I may have been mistaken but I was under the impression that there would be sandwiches there, all the time. The plan was to eat some cheese and have a sandwich for dinner.\\n\\nThey were busy, however there is probably room for just 20(ish) people.  We were told we could sit anywhere and we did, but the server took a long time to bring menus, as in 7ish minutes, to bring menus.  I'm sorry but bringing menus is a pretty quick task to perform.  Now I could give some room on the service, IF he wasn't stopping to check on other  tables, which were mere feets away from us. There was a couple that sat down after us (5 minutes or so), that received their plates before we'd even ordered.  \\n\\nThe menu is small.  There are four cheese plates ($14 each) and a charcuterie board ($18).  You may add pate, for an additional charge ($3 or $4?).  We ordered a cheese plate, charcuterie board w/pate, and a bottle of wine.  (But it looks like they forgot to charge us for the pate.)\\n\\nAs Nick M mentioned, (yes,I was there with Nick M), the plates are small in comparison to the price and size of a standard cheese plate.  See my photo. The mark up seems high for what you get.  They are not making the cheese or meat.  Speaking of the meat, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between two of the meets apart.  The cost of both totaled $32.  I cannot think of anywhere that two appetizers costs $32.  With a bottle of wine, our tab was $60.  We picked a $22 bottle of wine and it was very good. Most of the other wines are much more expensive.\\n\\nWhile, the night we were there had an obnoxiously loud table which is very much noticeable in a small location, it very well could be a place to relax.  I can't imagine their intent is to be the waiting room for Barley Swine though, as other reviewers mentioned. \\n\\nCould I have asked to talk to the manager?  Yes.  However, this is the value they have placed on the items they provide and clearly their opinion is different than mine.  Also, after seeing the email one of the employee's sent to Nick M, I was able to see a taste of what probably would've happened if I had.  It wasn't pretty and the owner did apologize for it.  I don't like to cause a scene and if that employee was who I'd have talked to... yeah. \\n\\nBottom line is, we had to go eat dinner somewhere else.  \\n\\nPerhaps, you love Henri's' which clearly some of you do.  At the time of my check in, it was all 5 stars from 7 or 8 people.   \\n\\nMy opinion is based on a combination of quality, quantity and service.   I wanted to like Henri's and had even waited for Nick M to return from a business trip to go there. (We LOVE cheese.)\\n\\nNote:  Full disclosure, I didn't tip and  I ALWAYS tip.  Actually, I over tip.  However, the profit margin was clearly high and the service was ridiculously slow.... I had a hard time justifying adding an additional $6 to my tab.

I tip very generously everywhere I go to the staff that deserves it, this bar and experience was not exception.  However, it is important to know, that if they run specials, what they call shot and picture specials, really means, \\"we are going to serve you less, and are going to charge you less\\".  While I have no issue with this bait and switch technique, it should be communicated when the order is placed, not when the bill is delivered.

I ordered the vegetarian Vietnamese crepe with tofu and shiitake mushrooms. What I got was about 95% bean sprouts, maybe 3 small pieces of tofu, and a few small slivers of mushroom...no way did I even get the equivalent of one mushroom. The crepe itself was cooked perfectly, but bland. It was essentially just yellow-coloured flour, nothing like the deliciously pungent and eggy Vietnamese pancake from the spot I go to near my home in Toronto. For $18.00 plus tax, an absolute rip-off. My friend ordered a noodle bowl, and had a similar complaint. Extremely chintzy on the nice ingredients, very generous with the cheap, in her case vermicelli noodles. She liked the flavour of the one tiny piece of chicken she got, the one small prawn, and the one bite of spring roll. And she loved the sauce that came with it, So not a total loss. And by coincidence, which made me think that mine wasn't an isolated case, the guy sitting at the table to my right complained about the meagreness of choice ingredients to the server as well. But he was smarter than me and did so before he finished his food, so he got an extra little bowl of tofu, I assume on the house.\\n\\nThe place was packed. Why?

We ordered 2 bowls of noodles and 1 order of the small pork dumplings. Our server, a young Asian guy, said that they were out of pork dumplings and started to suggest other things which we simply replied no to. I then said to the server \\"It's fine, we'll just have the noodles\\" but really my girlfriend wanted something else. So after the server placed the order, she called him again to order some other type of dumplings, to which the server replied \\"But they're making it right now.\\" So we said to him that we'll just add on our order, we know the noodles were being made. So the noodles came out and we weren't impressed, they tasted just OK. To our surprise, the next item brought to our table was the pork dumplings that they originally said they were out of. So we were happy and we enjoyed the dumplings. After a little while, the SECOND dumplings arrived (the ones that my girlfriend ordered after). So we were confused and then we called the server. We explained to him that we only ordered that because we thought they were out of the pork dumplings. The server looked at me cynically and he was just quiet. So I asked him if it's possible to cancel it because we haven't even touched it and he said yes. After that though, he started yelling (yes, yelling) at the other server in Mandarin saying how he hated \\"the customers\\" because he said he knew that we wouldn't be able to finish all food we ordered and that's why he warned us that \\"it\\" has been made. Unfortunately for him, I am a Chinese descend so even though I didn't understand 100% of what he said, I understood enough to call him back and confront him. So I told him that if the item wasn't returnable, I would just pack it to go and pay for it, because I told him I didn't like the way he tried to talk behind my back in Mandarin. He tried to avoid it by saying he was talking about other customers (what a server! talking about how bad other customers are in front of HIS customer!). I then forced him to give me the dumplings packed up to go and forced to pay because I didn't want him to blame me on his mistake. If the owner reads this review, I just want to tell you to watch over your staff and try not to hire young people to be servers because they tend to be emotionally unstable (our server looked like he was 18-19 years of age). In conclusion, the food was decent but unfortunately the service really turned us down and we never will come back. We've been telling our friends not to go either. Think twice before you go!

The girl gave a huuuuuge sigh and looked very pointedly at the clock, like it was the BIGGEST request in the world. \\n\\nProbably the best example of terrible service was earlier this summer. They had a few tables setup outside. There was a bit of shade under the awning, which is where everyone was sitting. A girl had finished her meal and was sitting at a table reading. Granted, this isn't a very considerate move in a tiny restaurant with limited table space. I think an appropriate response would have been for the staff to come over, nicely explain the 1 hour table policy and point out that other people waiting, and ask her to either order another drink or let someone else use the space. Instead, this is what happened: a staff member came outside. Said \\"excuse me\\" to her. Lifted the table and moved it 2 feet away from everyone else's so it was out in the direct, afternoon summer sun. Then went back inside. WOW. The girl moved her chair to the table and sat for about 2 minutes, then left. It was an effective technique. But SO rude, in that way that they can really only nail at Crema. \\n\\nThey unfortunately took my favorite sandwich, goat cheese with honey and walnuts, off the menu. I tried to order it without realizing it was gone. They wouldn't make it special order. So really, that was the only draw for me to go back... with that gone, I'll skip the crappy service.

(This is no mean feat in ATX where it's more hit than miss if you avoid the chains in favor of smaller family-run places.) We had tacos de nopales--so salty and savory they could have been meat. They were rivalled by the tacos de pollo, which quite literally were meltingly tender, and the al pastor--just enough tooth to the pan-charred pork to offer suitable complement. Their guacamole was fresh, creamy, and thick with chunks, and the white corn tortillas were non-pareil--roughly formed around the edges, not cut with a mold, and a fine substitute for those who can't decide between flour or corn tortillas. Service was quick-- though I speak Spanish, and the portions were ample, and as affordable as the cuisine should be, not gentrified into fine dining prices as many places do now. These are good people making exceptional food cheaper than one can make it at home. Additionally, their posted hours on the front door claims they are open until midnight Friday through Sunday.

Similarly, Teatro creates a remarkable Chicken MIlanese, also the best version of this classic dish that I've ever tasted. Expect both, like other entrees to be served hot and fresh from the stove. \\n\\nBut while the food at Teatro excels on so many levels, it's the people  that may be the most impressive aspect of the Teatro experience. GM, Seth Weisman, sets the pace with his gracious and welcoming manner. Bartenders Rebecca, Nadia and Danny are personable, efficient and professional. The waitstaff is experienced and attentive.  Among this seasoned group is Eduardo who, for years, has delivered smiles and fantastic service.\\n\\nIf you are looking for Boston's best Italian dining destination you won't find a more delightful experience than that provided by Teatro.

I remember standing outside in the frigid London winter trying to get into their shop in Covent Garden.  I also remember liking the long communal tables (which results in the line moving a tad faster), the way the servers scribble a number on your paper placemat, and the thick broth and chewy noodles.  \\n\\nFast forward a couple of years in another part of the world, I nearly peed my pants when they opened one in Sydney's King Street Wharf.  Again the place proved to be popular and the food was just as good as I remembered it to be. \\n\\nSo one can only imagine my excitement when, after getting kicked out of Saks Fifth Avenue because they were closing, I stumbled upon Wagamama in Boston.  Why, hello! Apart from a smattering of diners, there were lots of available seats.  \\n\\nThe communal tables are still the same, and so is the practice of scribbling a number on the placemat after you place the order.  But I didn't know what happened to the food - the curry was bland and the katsu was overcooked (I did like the sticky rice a lot though so, at least that's a plus)! \\n\\nI left the place a tad disappointed, but oh well."},{"name":"Waypoint","address":"1030 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Maybe there's something wrong with me. It seems like everyone else I know who has dined at Waypoint loves it and raves about it. I so, so want to be one of them! I REALLY want to regard Waypoint as highly as I regard Alden & Harlow, Little Donkey, and Craigie on Main. But I've visited Waypoint twice and just don't find the food to be tasty or many of the esoteric flavor combinations to be appealing.\\n\\nI tried Waypoint again last night. The service was top-notch -- very attentive -- though I'd suggest telling your server not to bring too many plates at the same time. Otherwise you're likely to find yourself with far too many items getting cold in front of you.\\n\\nSo, the food...\\n\\nThe high point, by far, was the Bigoli & Clams pasta dish ($21) -- mainly because it was loaded with dairy (egg & cheese). It's an alfredo sauce with clams. It's a heavy dish that was really tasty and nicely balanced. This is THE dish to get! Portion size was quite good for the price, too.\\n\\nThe Chickpea Gemelli ($18), another pasta dish, was lacking in flavor (other than salt -- salt dominated this dish -- too much of it) The ingredients didn't seem to go together very well. Disappointing. Portion size was similar to the Bigoli & Clams -- generous -- but I didn't eat much of it because I didn't like it.\\n\\nThe WP Fish Sando ($16) was really disappointing. It's a small piece of white fish, with unremarkable batter, on a much larger toasted roll with some chopped lettuce on top and bland aioli (something white, anyway) on the side. I couldn't see any fish when the plate arrived, so I had to take the top off the roll to make sure some fish was really in there. About half of my bites were just bread, and the other half (towards the center of the roll) included fish. The texture of the chew was weird, like on the rough side (I think it was the bread, not the fish, but I'm not sure). In my mind I kept comparing this dish to a McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich, because it's the same fish except McDonald's is tastier. I got no hint of the cheddar dusting (but maybe I wasn't supposed to notice it at all, since it's a dusting?) or anything else here. I ate about a quarter of it. Avoid this sandwich.\\n\\nWe got the Crab French Fries with the fish sandwich. The fish sandwich normally comes with regular fries, but our server suggested we upgrade to the crab fries (for a $5 upcharge). The portion size of crab fries was huge, but again the flavor wasn't especially inspiring -- not the kind of thing I'd ever order again. They tasted like standard seasoned fries. They came with crab & chili mayo, which I ended up spreading on the fish sandwich to try to flavor it a bit.\\n\\nThe Grilled Asparagus was tasty -- I'd say the second-best dish next to the Bigoli & Clams pasta dish -- but it was bizarrely overpriced. For $16, you get a few small spears of asparagus. We were expecting something twice this size based upon the prices and portion sizes of the other dishes we got. If this were an $8 side, I'd recommend it.\\n\\nAgain, maybe it's just me. So many other people seem to love Waypoint that I felt compelled to return after thinking it was mediocre the first time. But my opinion of the food is now solidified rather than changed.\\n\\nBottom line:  If you visit Waypoint, expect great service, order the Bigoli & Clams pasta dish, and steer clear of the WP Fish Sando and Chickpea Gemelli pasta."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"As a new Portlander, avid singleton and internet dater, and woman-about-town, I'm unfortunately looking for places to have a good drink and an awkward conversation - places where the service is friendly, but impersonal enough to ensure I'm not recognized as a regular. \\n\\nI don't think I need to say anything about the food or drink at this point.

Broadway clearly stands above the crowd for both food and service. One thing I consistently notice is how clean the place is. It always looks like they just finished cleaning when we go there - and this includes their bathrooms. When you go to a place numerous times, often you start to pick up on little things. However, we've been to Broadway probably 20 times in the past two years and it is always extremely clean and inviting.\\n\\nWe normally sit in the bar because they have televisions and always have sports showing. FYI it is a UF Gators fan spot but the staff is more than welcoming about our alternate team choices. The bartenders and staff are extremely friendly. They actually appear to enjoy their jobs and the food they serve. Beers are very reasonably priced at less than three bucks for a 16 ounce draft.\\n\\nThe pizza is arguably the best we can find in this area. It is extremely fresh tasting, and always cooked perfectly. Their sauce is something special and the pizzas are always fresh out of the oven hot. We've tried several different kinds and they are all equally enjoyable. \\n\\nThe only heads up I would submit to readers is that on most Saturdays they have some kind of entertainment. Due to the smaller size of the place, the wood flooring and taller ceilings, the music/entertainment will dominate the room. You won't be able to have a normal conversation if you are sitting in the dining area when they are playing (another benefit about the bar). However, the talent is all local and actually helps bring people to the place so it isn't necessarily a bad thing. \\n\\nWe thoroughly enjoy the Broadway Pizza Bar and will be back soon.

But my husband loves this place and I love the casual wine-in-a-can vibe so I kept hunting.\\n\\nOddly my favorite thing here is the Carrot Tomato soup. It's SO good and different from the cream-laden bisques or basil topped varieties most restaurants have. There's a underlying note of something kind of exotic, a curry spice perhaps? Either way, the soup paired with a toasty Hawaiian-style sweet roll really made me happy.

Ran into an old friend on my way in, and based on the fact that he was eating here this place must be plenty trendy. Monday night, and the place was not very crowded so we were seated and taken care of quickly. The sauerkraut balls were pretty darn good, but the fried pickles were spears, not chips, so people that have serious preferences in this regard beware.\\n\\nI had the pirogi and sausage and they were just okay. The pirogi were a little dry and the sour cream and onions didn't quite take care of it. Best pirogi I ever ate were made by a Polish guy in a pan over an open fire, and I am pretty sure he used a fair amount of bacon grease on top of them to keep them from being dry, but they were also wild mushroom and not just mashed potato filled, so perhaps that contributed to the moisture content. Or maybe I am holding pirogi up to an unfair standard created by Voytek. They were certainly not bad, either way.\\n\\n I don't remember what my wife got, but my mom got the wings and she is still talking about them, so I will have to try them next time. The Bloodthirsty craft brew was pretty good (made with blood orange). Gave my leftovers to a homeless man who was \\"selling\\" junk mail in the north market parking lot behind the bar.

I don't know why, but I am just not a fan.\\n\\nSo, our first full day there the coach wanted the girls to have a team breakfast, and since the Holiday Inn Resort in Lake Buena Vista was our host hotel (we actually got a great deal elsewhere, I just had to be a taxi getting my daughter back and forth-last time I do THAT) and the Applebee's is connected to the hotel this is where we had our breakfast.  They do a decent little breakfast buffet and it was cheap...the girls loved it, they bonded a little more, and I got to have my first bowl of grits in quite some time.  Actually a very good deal for breakfast...and the Manager was great.\\n\\nThe night before, when we had our initial team meeting at 8pm it was before we had even gotten a chance to eat, so rather than go search for something we started our trip with a dinner at Applebee's. My daughter wanted to hang with her teammates so we ordered her food separately (chicken fingers-that's my athlete...healthy food all the time).  Anyway, my wife and I did the 2 for $20; I had the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp and she had the small Sirloin...we also had the mozzarella sticks and my son actually ordered a burger with cheese and bacon (healthy, right!?!).  The mozz sticks were fine-standard fare, probably pulled from the freezer, but my son loved them (another shocker...).   My meal was ok, chicken was done and seasoned well, but the shrimp were a little chewy-nothing wrong with them, just a bit overdone.  I didn't like the potatoes...also underdone.  My wife liked her steak, but it wasn't anything special.\\n\\nI just can't wrap my arms around the food here.

My visitations with my dad every weekend was at his restaurant since I was able to walk. I basically slaved away most of my life working the restaurant and would never treat anyone the way we were treated at this place... I left the restaurant business about 8 years ago because I won two Grammies in the music industry and that became my life and no longer in the restaurant business... Now that being said, I was at this bar Sunday night  and I have to say the food was really good, the server and bartender were incredibly nice! The place is beautiful and the atmosphere is really pleasant. This bar closes at 2am, its 1:50 and people at the bar left and said to us \\"watch out for the manger he is a real asshole\\" and as they were walking out this manager \\"James\\" (Average height, dark short hair, African American male) he followed them to the door was starring them down the whole time leaving like he was starring them down waiting for them to do something. I said hmmm maybe they did something wrong... well the server was cashing out our credit cards and while we are waiting for her to come back he says in a very disgusted tone, \\"you guys have finish those drinks and leave.\\" And I said politely, \\"our serving is running our credit cards we will be out of your hair once she comes back.\\" he said \\"ok\\" with this attitude and walked away. Now it so happened for some reason my card that I used all vacation didn't work and I said to James \\"I'm so embarrassed my bank does this to me often bc I travel a lot\\"  I said  \\"I'm so sorry I'm going to call them right now but in the mean time I'm going to get my emergency credit card out of the car.\\" Btw my bank decided to cancel my credit card that I've been using all day and vacation and they said they sent me a new one a month ago that I did not know of or receive and after 30 days they cancel the card, being that it's 2am I guess that's the 30 day mark... no problem... I walk back in from the car with my other card and my wife and friends say, \\"we have to get out of here now bc the manager is being a real asshole and telling us we have to leave!\\" and as I look over he is starring me down like he wants to fight me or intimidate me! Lol I'm a man of respect and that fucking bs! I was nice and respectful and polite to this prick and did everything as fast as possible to resolve the situation. Between the bar and the table we had we spent over $300! I said to James, \\"am I an inconvenience to you???\\" I said out loud to the server after she ran my other card  \\"here is a 40% tip but tell your manager to learn some respect\\" and then I turned around and I told James that was still starring at me with not a smile in his body that \\"I've been in the hospitality business most of my life and you do not treat people that way! treat people with respect! And be kind! It goes a long way!\\" This fuck says  \\"goodnight and bye bye\\"  He needs to learn some fucking manners and smile and be respectful when you're talking to customers that are nice to you!

They bring out a plate of chopped veggies with a delicious herb sauce instead of bread. LOVE that. So far I have only tried the Tom Yum soup and the Tiger Shrimp appetizer. Both of these had amazing flavors. The Tom Yum is actually a little spicier than any others I've had which isn't a bad thing...just something to note. \\n\\nFor entrees we tried the Steak Tips which are seasoned sooo well, the Glazed Duck Breast which is delicious and beautifully presented on a bed of mango chutney and the Lamb Loin Chops which were succulent with a wonderful peppery kick.

From placement of steak knives to drink service, their staff is unbelievable. Both times I have come I have been blown away with their waiters. \\n\\nPrice?? Did I not mention how affordable this is? Steak tips were like $15 dollars and come with a healthy side salad and perfect portion of sticky white rice. That's what you pay at Whitehorse! Ohh booze is also very affordable. They have an awesome wine selection with bottles running as low as $28. \\n\\nDessert....well there really isn't any. That's why I am not giving it 4 stars. They have one option of a coconut pudding but that's it.  While they do offer plenty of ports they really don't have a dessert menu. Even though I rarely order dessert, I do like the option of at least looking. \\n\\nOK....ALMOST done. They have 2 unisex bathrooms. Yes, I am seriously writing about the bathroom in my review.

Although the pretzels tasted fresh - the cheese was lumpy, watered done and not worth the $11 for the 4 pretzels. \\n\\nI will say if you are looking to toss back some local brews - Barleys has some creative flavors and its worth a stop.

The hash browns took me completely by surprise. I can't quite put my finger on what they were seasoned with. Nutmeg, perhaps. My girlfriend suggested cinnamon, but I'm just not sure. Either way they were kind of sweet and it was a flavor that threw me off, for better or for worse, I'm not entirely sure. Because there is a certain sanctity to the potato. You put sour cream or butter on it. Ketchup, or even cheese, if you're feeling adventurous. But sweet things (I realize ketchup is sweet, but I don't make the rules) don't seem to fit.

I didn't think it was possible, but everything on our table was dry. I had to spit out the chicken after chewing it a few times because it was starting to choke me. The ribs had to be eaten with sips of water because it was hard to swallow too. The turkey leg tasted dried out and flavorless.

The turkey leg only had a few bites taken out of it, and the rest of the food was practically untouched. The manager said he was sorry and informed us that he'll take some things off the check. That was after informing us that ribs are never dry and the meat shouldn't have been dry either. Do you want to take a bite of it and see how long it takes you before you have to take a swig of water or spit it out?! It's like he didn't even believe us. 10 dollars. 10 dollars was all he took off. That turkey leg alone was 10 dollars. We didn't want to get a free meal. We didn't even eat the meal or pack it up to go. The service and quality of the food was a huge disappointment.

My expectations were low since I just moved from San Diego, which I think is kind of a burrito mecca (filled with very fattening lardy goodness and even french fries!!) But, Laughing Planet has managed to be super tasty, fresh, and healthy (not to be confused with non-fattening) all at the same time. I've had the \\"black bean and spinach\\" burrito and the \\"southwestern green chili\\" burrito. On both I poured on the medium salsa (very mild) which is pretty awesome if you like garlic and cilantro - its got tons. Also, I love that brown rice is the standard instead of the rare exception and they also have whole wheat tortillas at no extra charge.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that they charge a steep $2.25 to add a TINY bit of chicken to a burrito - and I mean tiny (was halfway through before I found any.  They also change that for sour cream and guacamole, which I haven't done so I'm not sure if they skimp on those or not.\\n\\nAnyway, great place for great food!

Kind of run of the mill type of sushi that seems to be developing here in Vancouver. For over 20 dollars a person for all you can eat dinner, I don't think it was really worth it.

However, this place appears to cater to large parties (they have several party rooms). We had a variety of dishes and while the pork tenderloin was overcooked it still had good flavor. Mashed potatoes were gluey but had a great flavor. Chicken marsala and no-meat lasagna (gluten free) were pretty good for banquet food (nothing special, but pretty good). Mixed veggies were probably the frozen kind, but tasted fine. Salad and fresh bread were delicious. Carrot cake was dense but good. \\n\\nNow all that said, if I was served this same food in the dining room I'd probably be giving this place 2 stars at best.

A few pointers if you are going would be to make a reservation and then you can pick your food before you get in. I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the quiche. We both really enjoyed our food and we were happy we ordered ahead cause we pretty much went right in. They confirmed the order, where if you want to change it that would be the time to do it, and then we paid. Went in sat down they took our receipt and verified what we had and our food was there 10 mins later.

Also, I'm not typically a big fan of buffet desserts, but they had some really delicious cakes and cookies! \\n\\nThe service was about what you'd expect for buffet--just kinda there.

All of the food was delicious. We are long-time fans of El Vaqeruo and the food was exactly what we expected, just a little disappointed in the service.

I was the only person in line at the time I ordered, but within minutes after my order was taken and I was handed one of their buzzers that would alert me when my order was ready, a line was formed with about 5 customers in it. \\n I stood waiting for my food for about 10 minutes before I began to wonder why things were taking a bit, after all, I'd only ordered fries with chili and cheese dumped on them. But whatever, I wait another 5-7 minutes. I've noticed that a lot of people who arrived after me have been served their food, but I've yet to receive mine. Looking through the food window, I can see a container with chili cheese fries sitting on the line to be served, and employees walking by it, looking at it, the counter girl even got chili on her elbow when she almost knocked it off the counter, she moved it further on the counter and continued serving food to others!! \\nDuring my wait, I had time to observe that no one was wearing gloves, and everyone felt comfortable touching their noses, mouths or running their hands through their hair, as I witnessed everyone of them exhibiting this unclean behavior. Very alarming and just downright nasty! I was seriously getting grossed out while watching this!\\nFinally I walk up to the window I'd been looking though and ask if those fries, the cold ones sitting on the line are supposed to be for me. The girl looks up and says \\"oh yea, your buzzer must not work.\\" Then proceeds to hand me the cold fries, as if to say \\"it is what it is\\". \\nI calmly explained to the very nonchalant little hussy that I had been standing there for 20 minutes, waiting for my food, like literally standing right in front of her. \\nThe blonde at the counter just looked at me with contempt. Just looked! She seemed very annoyed when I told her that I no longer wanted the fries, but a refund instead, she just walked away, mumbling under her breath that she'd get the manager. \\n NOT ONE APOLOGY WAS GIVEN. \\nNo one offered an apology. No one made eye contact with me as they handed me a receipt stating that the transaction had been canceled. I will most definitely NEVER go to this establishment again! Unclean, Incompetent, unapologetic and far from friendly.

When we arrived there was a line outside the door and when I eventually got pass the door the aroma was so pleasant. We ordered the Reggie, Mcisley, and a side of hash browns. The Reggie was biscuit, fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and gravy. It was amazing. Perfect comfort food on a cold day. The chicken was moist and the flaky biscuit soaked up a lot of the creamy gravy. The Mcisley was biscuit, chicken, pickles, mustard, and honey and perfect for anyone that loves pairing their chicken with honey. Mcisley was delicious but I preferred the Reggie. The hash brows were your typical hash that had perfectly golden brown crust. Eat your hash and biscuit with hot sauce, specifically the aardvark habanero sauce.

Our bartender Sam was entertaining and informative as with his chemistry expertise and wit, he explained fabulously the aspects and character of the different varieties offered and how it was achieved in the their brewing process, to create Slumbrews unique styles and flavors.

I inquired about which wines were included in the half price happy hour, and she said all of the wines were half off.  I tried three reds while I was there and I didn't care for any of them.  I actually had only heard of one of them before.  There is lots of room for improvement on the wine list.  \\n\\nMy husband is a beer snob, so he was happy to have 6 beers he would actually drink on tap.

It used to be worthy of the Yaletown prices it was charging for its sandwiches.  Now it's no Meat and Bread, that's for sure, even though it charges as much for a sandwich, but it used to be in the ballpark. The ingredients are fresh, the meat is spectacular - succulent pork with cracklin' skin, juicy duck, all you would expect from a high-end sandwich shop.\\n\\nNot anymore.\\n\\nYou see, a couple months ago DD Mau got greedy.  They weren't making quite enough money on their $10 sandwiches served on exquisite artisanal rolls.  So they changed one ingredient... the bread.  They switched from rolls worthy of the $10 price tag to standard Vietnamese buns, the same kind you get a $2.50 sub on in any other Vietnamese sandwich shop in the city.  And the sandwiches suffer.  They aren't even in the same class anymore.  Bread is bread right? Water, flour, salt, yeast... what's to it!?  Well I wish I could put a DD Mau sandwich from 2 months ago next to a DD Mau sandwich today and show you.  You would be as disappointed as I that they got so greedy that they had to pull this switch.  Several other folks in my office stopped going to DD Mau since the switch.\\n\\nMaybe they don't know how to run a restaurant, maybe they negotiated their lease badly, not sure why they did it but this isn't the same food and it isn't worth the price they're charging.  \\n\\nAre the sandwiches still good? Yep, the meat and the rest of the ingredients haven't changed, just the bread.  If you're ordering one of their specialty meats, then you're still doing ok eating here.

The flatter dishes that are common in other places tend to cool down by the time I reach the end.  This was hot to the last bite.  Nice.  The pork chop itself was also a slightly different style.  Instead of the thicker version which is quite common this was a pounded version more reminiscent of a good schnitzel.  A good schnitzel covered with tomato sauce and served on fried rice, of course.

I've gone in early in the morning, mid afternoon, and evening. No matter the time of day their options are very limited. They might have a few donut flavors, only one cupcake flavor, and maybe two breads. Or two cupcake flavors and one donut. The case always looks so empty. Overall, this bakery is just OK.

Pretty great deal and comes with basically all the accompanying bread you need to scoop up the food, and they ask if you need more.  It was SO flavorful, quite spicy though.  But, if you ask them to tone it down before you order they can likely do so, I just didn't realize how spicy some of them would be.  #10 - the mushroom dish, was exceptionally good.  I also LOVED the okra one, but that was one of the spicy ones, so beware!  \\n\\nMy fiance ordered a chicken dish which he loved and said was spicy, though he loves spicy food.  \\n\\nThe restaurant was very accommodating at separating the veggie dishes from the meat dishes.

I can just see two people ordering 2 meat dishes and it not being enough food for you to feel satisfied.  \\n\\nThey had a pretty decent beer selection - none that I was a fan though.

The prices were so cheap I almost didnt want to order beause I'm so used to thinking you have to pay an arm and a leg for good take out food, and I am a bit of  snob when it comes to dinning out. To my surprise the food was amazing. I ordered a side salad and cajun chicken with penne, I ordered the small portion and still had lots left over! My boyfriend ordered a huge make your own pasta salad and a side of french fries and the order came up to 15$. I wouldn't have even been able to make all that stuff for 15 dollars. I was surprised to see that they also offer a breakfast menu. We will definitely be ordering from here more often! :)"},{"name":"Cantina Laredo","address":"201 W 3rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I put together an impromptu birthday outing for myself and had an all-around really good experience last Saturday night.  Cantina Laredo first got major points with me when they were enthusiastically willing and able to accommodate my party of 10 for a Saturday night with a same-day reservation.  They were also un-phased by the last-minute addition of two more people.   (I love it when I don't feel like I'm inconveniencing a business I'm trying to patronize!)\\n\\nThe atmosphere at CL is modern, energetic and cozy but not crowded.  The acoustics are good and it is easy to carry on a conversation.  The margaritas are excellent and everyone was very pleased with their meal.  I don't agree with other reviewers who commented on small portions.  It is not a heaping platter smothered in cheese, but a just-right, refined, and tasty Tex-Mex meal.   The food is fresh and flavorful and it was fun to have guacamole made table-side.  \\n\\nMost of all, I have to compliment Chris, our waiter.  He was on it from the time we sat down to the delivery of the bill.  I appreciated that he took the time to ask (and remember) my name.  He was very attentive, sincere, and happy to accommodate all our requests.  \\n\\nInitially I was a little wary about a restaurant that had reservations for a large group on a Saturday night but I think there are two contributing factors to this-the restaurant is very roomy the crowd picked up as the evening went on.  I think its location makes it more a later-in-the-evening eatery.  \\n\\nAlways happy to find a solid restaurant that will accommodate big groups and thrilled to discover Cantina Laredo!"},{"name":"Chaat House","address":"1850 Lawrenceville Hwy","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"A new place in the plaza with Cafe Istanbul.

I went back to my seat and fortunately I was with a Vietnamese-speaking friend. My friend listed to them and literal translation, \\"that girl is lucky I am not going to throw this bowl in her face and cut her eyes out.\\" This isn't the first time they've yelled at customers (mainly the woman at the counter), my Vietnamese-speaking friend says he hears them talking terribly about customers all the time, including inflciting violence on them. I don't see how food should or could get so violent!\\n\\nSo, minus the craziness of the place, let's discuss the food...the pho is decent and it doesn't seem like they use MSG which is why I kept coming back. However, the soups have gotten bland and the soup temperature can be a hit or miss. I like my soups warm, the last few bowls have been lukewarm which is not appealing for pho. \\n\\nThey also have a handful of other authentic Vietnamese dishes such as carmelized fish (which is super pricey $15), shrimp paste soup, and broken rice, but all are lackluster. The flavor is simply off, perhaps this is because what other yelpers mentioned, the rushed nature of the restaurant. \\n\\nI find that Pho Pasteur is a much better option. Pho Hoa next door is also better if you like beef broth soups (they have this one called Bun Bo Hue that is delicious).

I heard a lot about this place and I remember it being in the movie, Gone Baby Gone. It certainly had the reputation of being a Boston staple. So, when I saw that it had only 3 stars on Yelp, I kind of wondered why... Well, I am not wondering anymore! \\n\\nI'll go into detail about my experience in a minute, but if you want the short version I will put that first. This place should not be called \\"Chart House\\". It should be called... Well take away \\"Chart\\" and use your imagination! \\n\\nSo, 5 of us had a reservation for 7:45pm. We showed up at 7:30 to play it safe and they said they were running 30 minutes behind their reservation time. Little strange, but not enough to cause a problem for us. Well, we ended up being seated at 9:15pm!!!! An hour and a half past our reservation time and this place has a lot of tables. We were told every single excuse in the book on why we had to wait. After the 3rd or 4th one I stopped believing them all together. \\n\\nNow we sit down. The server comes over, she had sweat dripping down her face, looked like she hated the world, and was close to being the rudest person I ever met. Another person in our party communicated that she was being rude and asked for the manager. She walks away and goes over to where the managers, servers, and other staff members gather and starts telling them about our table. What she was saying, I don't know, but it was very uncomfortable seeing the entire staff staring at us from across the room. I mean come on! Be a true American! Smile in front of us then trash us behind our backs where we can't see or hear you! That's the way you do it! So, the manager comes over and gets us a new server, she was great! They gave us some extra attention and free apps or something, which was nice, but after waiting 90 minutes past our reservation time and having a nasty server greet us, it was too little too late! \\n\\nOverall this place was just odd and not a good experience. Waiting 90 min past our reservation time? What is this 1985? How can you screw that up with online reservations? I have never had that happen before, no joke! It simply shows that they simply cram in as many people as possible, regardless of the outcome. In addition to that, the place is full of tourists and people in the area for conferences/business.

We both got a glass of two different red wines and were happy with the choices.  We started with the arugula salad and the house made pasta: Chitarra (Hand-rolled spaghettini with clams, pancetta, white wine, peperoncino & toasted breadcrumbs).  If we stopped with just this, we would have had a wonderful meal and service would have been amazing.  The pasta and clams were perfect.  The salad was a perfect portion and had delicious prosciutto, pecorino, dates and a sherry vinaigrette.   \\n\\nAfter our plates were cleared it was a good 25-30 minutes before our disaster of an attempt at what sounded like delicious mains arrived.  At no time did the waitress come over to say it will be a little longer or can we get you another glass of wine, etc.  It was at about 20 mins when the server acknowledged it was going to be a bit longer.  (Not looking for a freebie, but it would have been nice to have the staff apologize for the inconvenience).  What arrived was supposed to be the following: Seared sea scallops with roasted jerusalem artichokes, wild mushrooms and black truffle for myself.  My wife had the roasted moulard duck breast with brussels sprouts, roasted acorn squash & vin cotto.  What we really got was perfectly cooked scallops (Thankful for that) over a pile of greasy burnt mushrooms, artichokes and smelly burnt pancetta.

I think virtually everything on the menu can be made gluten free and it all looks delicious. I got the tuna nicoise and potato leek soup and thought it was great. They even have a gluten free cream puff for dessert. (they also have sorbet that is dairy free) Way better allergy choices than most Disney quick service restaurants.\\n\\n*  Tons of healthy options if your goal is to get away from the typical pizza and burgers park food. \\n\\n* Absolutely gorgeous interior. My kids loved watching the snow fall out the back window, the west wing was so cool (although kind of scary for kids and way too dark--we had trouble seeing our food!), and the rose room was so elegant. Compared to eating at other quick service restaurants (and even most table service restaurants!), it's just incredible visually. \\n\\n* Friendly service for the most part. Our order got screwed up and they not only helped me fix it quickly, but gave the missing food to us for free. \\n\\nCons: \\n\\n* It's pricey. Dinner prices might be comparable to other restaurants, but compared to other quick service restaurants, it's pretty high. It's close to $25 per person for breakfast. Even most table service restaurants don't run that high. It's a great value for the dining plan, but I'm not sure if I'd pay that much out of pocket. \\n\\n* It's busy. Now, dinner (which I haven't tried) might be different, but at lunch and breakfast you have to find your own seat. At breakfast, we wandered around looking for a table for 15 minutes before finally finding someone who was finishing up. We just basically stood over their table until they left and the busboys cleared it. For a breakfast that cost almost $100 for the four of us...meh.

I yelped, and as a result went here to celebrate my birthday with my fiance, because West African was a type of food we had never tried before, and the place had just such great reviews. We were not disappointed at all. In fact, I now wish i lived closer to Columbus.\\n\\nIt was a Sunday night, so a little quiet, and other than a group of young people who seemed to be there to peacefully watch tv and hang out, we were the only people in the restaurant. The enthusiastic and kind host greeted us, and asked us if we ever had African food before; we answered that we had, but only Ethiopian. He said that we would like this better and that he would introduce us to it by walking us through the menu.  He was so helpful, and charismatic--extremely concerned about whether I could handle the spice level. He brought out samples to test me. I found it really endearing that he didn't want me to \\"fill up on water\\" but instead enjoy the delicious food. The amount of pride from the host made me really happy to be eating there.  \\n\\nOnce i tried the food. I was even happier. Our host wanted us to try everything. We got one of each appetizer, and they were yummy. They came with a hot sauce that was good, but I didn't have a lot of it. He brought out two small dishes of soup--the goat and peanut. They were both delicious. For the entre, he was pushing the Jollaf rice, and I was happy to order that. I got it with Tilapia filets, which came fried, I thought it would be grilled, but it was still absolutely lovely. The Jollaf came with this sauce on top that if i ever learned how to replicate it, I would put it on everything.  The tilapia was smothered in marinated tomato and onions. It was really delicious. I misunderstood his description and thought it was both chicken and fish, rather than one or the other, but when i asked for it, he brought me out a chicken leg anyway, which was delicious. \\n\\nI would definitely agree with other reviewers about the pace of the meal. If you are in a rush, this isn't the place to go. I think we were there for about 2-3 hours. It was a very leisurely meal. We had a beer with dinner, some Kenyan lager, which was nice. We weren't offered another one, and at one point the host seemed to run out for a spell to go somewhere. There were folks there picking up to-go orders, who seemed to call it in and had a while to wait just the same. The host had told us though that certain things, like the whole tilapia,  would take up to 45 minutes to prepare, so be ready for that.  \\n\\nAltogether, we had one of each appetizer to share, a small taste of both soups, a beer to share, and then our entres, as mentioned, i got the tilapia witha  chicken leg, and my partner got the goat. He loved his as well.  The host also brought us out some Chapati (sp?). All of this food cost us somewhere around $30. \\n\\nI would recommend this place to anyone who likes to try new things, likes spicy and interesting food, and would be willing to go to dinner and let the host really treat you well. To some degree I felt like I had been invited over to someone's house for an intercultural dining experience, more than a meal at a restaurant.

With all the other amazing sushi restaurants out there this one is not that great. I've never had a really good meal there, it's always below average, or average at best. The service is pretty bad as well, and no one looks like they enjoy working there. However, you do get decent sized portions of food, so if you're just looking to fill up then sure, go try it. I wouldn't get excited about the All You Can Eat though either. You wont end up getting half or even less than half of the items you ordered. And i've noticed that they change their rolls sometimes I guess depending on who is working in the kitchen. For example sometimes when I get a yam roll it will have avocado in it, other nights it wont. I've been there time though for All You Can Eat and ordered something probably 4 or 5 times, and only got it delivered to my table once.

After all, Rockin' Tomato did, and it's around the corner..\\n\\nUnfortunately, it did not.  I started with a Fireman's #4, er, wait.  I didn't.  At five in the evening on a hot Texas day, the bar was out of my favorite afternoon beer.  Fine - a Pyramid Hefeweizen will do fine.  First thing I noticed?  The beer was below the regular \\"pour line\\", and the orange slice they included was limp and old.\\n\\nI chalked it up to bad luck, and decided to try a dozen of the $0.50 oysters ($6 for a dozen isn't actually all THAT cheap, but it's a good price).  It came out IMMEDIATELY; the ice was already starting to melt, and the oysters were obviously pre-shucked.  This is a bad thing - oysters don't sit well, especially when they're not kept cold enough.  These obviously weren't.  I did get through them, so they weren't THAT terrible, but I would NOT order them again.\\n\\nI decided to try the trout chartrain, since I like cajun food and trout isn't a common offering in Austin.  My order took a while, which was actually a bit exciting - I thought it might be fresh and well done.\\n\\nTurns out not so much.  The fish was excessively fishy and not terribly flakey, indicating to me that this was a pair frozen flilets.  The chartrain sauce, if that's what it was, was boring and looked like it came out of a plastic pouch.  The green beans were limp and lukewarm, and the fact that they came from a can was not hidden by the fried onion \\"garnish\\" attempt.  The rice was crunchy and tasteless.  For $15, it was a one-star attempt.\\n\\n\\nIn all, Alligator Grill is good for one thing - decent happy hour beer prices, and a pleasant patio.

Then the mussels to be honest were a dissapointment. Why cook them in beer... these big mussels looked nice but were so bland. That can be fixed though cook them in butter and wine with garlic parsley and salt and pepper or whatever is good for you they just need more flavor.The bread that came with the was like a crutini but stale I don't know if it was cooked or not but it wasn't good. The final entree for me was the grouper which I thought was very well cooked. I added the corn avocado salsa which was delicious.

If you want to take the steps to be a great kitchen, every detail must be taken with care. Plate design is huge. Its what wows people and makes them believe there are professinals back there and not just some ppl who don't care about they're dishes. Hold a higher standards for every plate that goes out.

I was visiting Portland alone and it was very warm. I decided to slink around the Pearl district trying a few places. \\n\\nFirst I went to Clyde Common to check out the \\"community tables.\\" The bar seemed lively - like a neighborhood bar - and diners at the large wooden tables seemed like they could either choose privacy or to comingle in conversation. One guy was even on a laptop. When I saw that, i decided to take one of the nice tables outside in the warm but mild evening air.\\n\\nFirst of all, I had looked at the place and the menu for maybe 10 minutes before deciding what to do. I finally sat down at 5:59 and happy hour ends at 6. They very nicely let me have my nasturtium cocktail and my green salad under the happy hour menu. The nasturtium was fabulous and beautiful (see picture). The salad was a massive heap of perfectly gorgeous butter lettuce, tossed in a nicely-emulsified but mild vinagrette giving the huge portion  of gorgeous buttery leaves a decadent quality.\\n\\nI had been thinking about moving along progressively to another place after a cocktail course to give something else a try, but based on that salad I decided to stay put. I proceeded to order The Crisyp Pig, a slice of pork roulade made from the pig's head meat. The roulade was treated in a sousvide and then sliced and seared. On the side were pickled cherries and the tiniest microgreens. The waiter suggested a glass of beaujolais which I enjoyed.\\n\\nI decided not to get an entree though they looked delicious. I moved on to roasted squash with fresh herbs. The small, sweet yellow and zucchini squash were perfectly al dente with delicious olive oil, herbs and salt.\\n\\nFor dessert I had a slice of Rogue River Blue - a hefty ounce with some lovely walnut bread, local honey, and berry jam. \\n\\nThe whole meal - cocktail, salad, appetizer, side, glass of wine, and cheese - came to $39.\\n\\nThank you for the excellent food and service.

This is not the finest Russian store I've been to, put mildly, but they have a markedly improved since an expansion in real estate about a year ago.  Their salamis/kolbasy are decent, as are their cheeses.  They have a strange selection of fruit/vegetables; they are always very reasonably priced but it's a struggle to pick out something that has not partially decomposed.  I have been known to pick up dollar packs or raspberries/in the summer to eat right away.  The services can be good to downright unpleasant, I speak Russian and I found the owner (who also sometimes mans the cash register) to be extremely patronizing, unpleasant and smarmy.  The ladies behind the counter have been both brusque at times and very nice at times.  All in all, I go because it's nearby, and I've found good quality Russian groceries (tea, candy, even ready-made kulinaria - I've gotten good soup here, sausage, cheese, even barley & flour). I've bought a jar of birch juice and was able to exchange it because there was something funny floating in it (no fault of the store, goes to speak for crappy Russian manufacturing).   I think the reason this place still exists though is because it is right by an old folks' home and the low prices appeal to the elderly Russian community.  There's no pride in ripping old people off, though, with less-than-fresh goods.

It's an all beef hot dog, topped with sauerkraut, applewood smoked bacon, saut√©ed onion, on a soft roll with a side pale ale mustard for only $9.59. This may have been one of the best dogs I've had in years, definitely in 2015. The warm soft roll was flaky on the outside and soft on the inside, almost like they just baked it. The dog was griddled to create that crispiness snap when bitten. The kraut was perfectly fermented and the onions were lightly saut√©ed while the bacon was crispy, but not really needed. However, the pale ale mustard tops the house made mustards I've had. The total compilation reached an 8.5 on my scale, which is on the high side for me (scale of 1-10). It is served with the standard pub sides, a dill pickle and fries; although the fries were good too. As a second brew I chose the Chupacabra. It seemed to be a combination of their IPA and Stout. Actually, they may have merely poured an IPA (30%) and topped it with their Stout. It's a great thought, but bad mixture. \\n\\nOverall - because I am a self proclaimed hotdog connoisseur, I had to have the dog, but the other foods around me looked awesome as well.

We ordered two house margaritas, based on the menu it says they are freshly shaken - they were poured into a measuring cup out of a premixed bottle and were the worst margaritas I've ever had.  It tasted like straight sour mix - I sent mine back and ordered a beer to be safe.  Some of their drinks are $12+ which is outrageous for the poor quality.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were ok - we continued eating them until we saw the bartender wipe the inside of a used chip bowl with her bar rag and then proceed to fill it with fresh chips and give it to the people that just sat down - nasty.

Today, needing something quick and wanting something different I finally took the plunge and stopped by. \\n\\nOnly minutes from UCF Tahini has taken over a space vacated by a flopped coffee house.  The space, though small, is inviting.  The walls are a warm cinnamony color and the furniture a mahogany.  There's a raised platform area with an incredibly comfy looking leather sofa.  It's a good thing I didn't go there for the decor which was minimal, but for the\\nfood. \\n\\nHaving just tried another well reviewed Mediterranean restaurant last week, I thought maybe it would be too soon, but boy was I wrong.  I arrived at 12:20 and found only two other patrons in the place.  I went to the counter and told the girl it was my first visit but she said to take my time, look over the menu and if I had any questions to let her know. \\n\\nIt looks like they are going kinda \\"Tiajuana Flats\\" with plastic placemat menus for diners to peruse.  She then said that you could add two sides to any sandwich to make it a platter for $2.99.  \\n\\nTrying to keep my lunch light (in calories/fat but NOT taste) I asked if the chicken gyro was all white meat or mixed.  All white, she replied.  So that's what I had.  The chicken gyro platter with the Greek salad and baba ghanoush as my sides.  I also added a slice of banana bread and a drink.  The total was about $11.\\n\\nThe food was delivered to my table quickly.  The salad, was your typical Greek...lettuce, tomatoe, red onion slices, feta, but what was special is that it was fresh.  The lettuce was crisp, the tomatoes juicy, the feta with that perfect salty balance. So many establishments give you some wilted green stuff.  The gyro was also very good.  The chicken was all white meat and shredded, but it was a good half pound of meat.  The pita wasn't as soft as I would have liked, more like the Pita Pit, but it was still quite tasty, but it was the Boba Ghanoush that had me over the moon!  Creamy, but still chunky with egg plant it had a slight smokey flavor that just left me wanting more!\\n\\nBy the time I finished lunch, the tank was full so I wrapped up the banana bread to go.  I figured it will be a good pick me up this afternoon.  The restaurant had also filled up, which left me very happy as I would hate to see this place go away.\\n\\nPros:\\nAfforadable Prices\\nMediterranea Classics (Hummus, Tabouleh, Baklava)\\nYou can see the gyro meat cooking on a hught rotisserie\\nFood is Halal\\nFresh Smoothies and Lemonade\\n\\nCons:\\nHit or miss as to what kind of banana bread they have available\\nStill working out there system so  items get forgotten or left behind BUT they are quick to bring them to you when notified."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Worst, not sure if it was because I went on a weekday.

She suggested it cause it's one of the few Asian places on Newbury street and Asian restaurants are usually pretty speedy. It was around 7 pm on a Thursday night - we were the only table there. I thought I was walking into a legit place: simple decor and they have SHICHIMI (spicy Japanese powdering) so I got excited.

And my roommate ordered just the Vegetable Ramen. Literally in less than 10 minutes, our food came out. The fried rice was pretty good. It was very oily though, I could see the oil radiating off each grain of rice  - which didn't really bother me since the rice was so so yummy. Not salty and super flavorful. The kimchi ramen was..meh. The noodles were a bit al dente, which I normally like. The broth is very plain. It sort of tastes like cup noodle soup but less salty.

Upon arriving for the workshop - Jack and I were offered coffee, none other than delicious Lineage coffee (see a few posts back for my experience with Lineage Roasting Coffee + Yelp's #OrlandoMade)! We were offered endless samples of some great flavors of marshmallows, strawberry, 24k gold Champagne, bourbon, Guinness, honey, Irish cream, and Irish coffee. I sampled one of each - all delicious, my favorite being Honey. Marshmallows were followed by strawberry rice crispy treats - yumm! After getting our sugar high on - the group of 12 people headed into the kitchen to see were the magic happens. We were giving a quick breakdown of how Wondermade came to be and then brought to stations to cut and decorate our own marshmallows. Both Jack & I selected the strawberry marshmallows to decorate.\\nAfter the 1.5 hour workshop we left belly's full of sweet treats, and what seemed like pounds of our decorated marshmallows!\\nWe had a great time and cant wait to visit Wondermade again!\\nP.s.

We of course packed everything to go at the end. The broth was AMAZING! My only complaint which is not really a complaint is the that the veggie broth should also be the mongolian spicy broth just veggie version which is not the case right now.

The restaurant has its own parking lot, but finding a spot can be challenging, especially on weekends. What they don't have is a waiting area, which is especially annoying for anyone who is disabled or doesn't like to stand outside when it's very hot or very cold. Be advised that this is a casual restaurant and it's not conducive to a romantic Italian dinner. It's quite loud when there's music playing in the bar, and I have also seen miniature humans, whose parents obviously lack the knack for parenting, wandering about and being disruptive. The quality of service has been hit or miss for me; I've encountered more than one waiter/waitress with an attitude problem, as well as those who've failed to refill drinks. I've also called ahead for carry-out a handful of times; they sometimes skimp on those portions. Once, I was told that the food would be ready in 20 minutes, but I stood there for another 40 minutes after I arrived, because I lacked motivation to fight my way out the door and go elsewhere.

I kept thinking to myself, if I could just get back for one more helping...\\n\\nWell, it's a good thing that didn't happen.  I might have died from a coronary.\\n\\nIn all seriousness though, the biscuits here are absolutely delicious.  If you can get past the unhealthy part.  And the line.  Don't let the wait come between you and food fantastic-ness!  Obviously I enjoyed the Reggie deluxe, but my dining companions ordered less \\"hearty\\" options and were equally pleased.  I recommend coming around 11:00 AM and you won't need to eat for the rest of the day.  \\n\\nOne last tip: A local told me the way seating works is that you don't sit down until your food is called up.  It's rude to sit and \\"save your seats\\" before you have your food.  Somehow, by divine providence there usually seems to be someone leaving right as you get your meal (as it did for us), so don't worry, patience pays!"},{"name":"Pepper Box Cafe","address":"932 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was my first taste of New Mexican cuisine, but if Pepper Box is any indication I will have to make my way out to New Mexico!

Now if you happen to throw in, \\"And I want my parents to come with us,\\" then FINO would probably move up a couple of notches.  \\n\\nFINO is small plates with a Spanish twist, they have great booze and happy hours (I get that from reliable sources), and the inside is dark and dim and high-end steakhouse clubby. The bar separates the room into two dining areas and you can see the semi-open kitchen from just about anywhere. The outside patio is a huge shaded affair, and it's pretty cool considering FINO is on the second floor of a building. The staff here is great and our server Jessica was on top of her game. \\n\\nOf the half-dozen dishes we tried, I thought the Blistered Shishito peppers along with the \\"Bagna Cauda\\" dip and crudit√©s were delicious. I enjoyed the frites part of the PEI Mussels, and my dining companion gave the Pan Seared Salmon a thumbs-up. I could argue the fried Brussels sprouts would be just as appealing lightly dusted with the almond Romesco instead of being buried in it, and the fried anchovy stuffed olives were interesting. Incidentally, they're big on aioli here.\\n \\nOn a Wednesday evening from 7:30-9:00, I didn't see more than six tables in use, and the operative word of the day seemed to be \\"sedate,\\" which is slightly different from \\"sedated.\\" I don't necessarily long for the hustle and bustle and trendy noise level of Uchi/Uchiko or Barley, but I did think it was appropriate to wash my hands as quietly as possible here at FINO. It's all an experience. I have heard interesting things about the Paella, Tuesday night is special Paella night, and Yelpers I know rave about the Niman Ranch FINO Burger that comes with Shishito pepper relish, and lots of aioli. But if you've never been here before, FINO is definitely worth checking out, and I'm mildly curious what you'll think and what the weekend crowds are like.

The restaurant boasts high ceilings with a modern-classy decor and intimate seating.  The kitchen is at the far end of the long dining area.  We sat along the wall at a corner table with booth seating, which was nice to sit close together rather than across from each other.\\n\\nThe servers were pleasant and friendly, keeping the table clean and drinks filled.  We had a 6:30 reservation on a Thursday, and the place was already packed to the gills when we arrived.  Despite this, the servers kept up with the busy tempo.  Our dinner, beginning to end, was about an hour, with plenty of time to head over to the theater.\\n\\nThe meal started off with complimentary bread accompanied by a simple but tasty garlic and oil spread.  We each ordered a small plate appetizer: tuna tartare for me (chilled, light and refreshing, nice lime accent flavor) and the veal meatball with corn polenta for him (3 generously-sized meatballs with a sweet sauce, creamy polenta, and shaved parmesan cheese).  Both were excellent and set the expectations for our entrees, which did not disappoint.  My husband loved his risotto with heirloom tomatoes - the risotto was perfectly al dente along with a delicious creamy tomato-based sauce.  I went straight for the homemade pasta shells with lobster and butter.  Very simple, but absolutely amazing.  The lobster was tender and perfectly prepared, and the butter was smooth and savory.  Every bite was heaven!

I understand they are busy but for the price of the food I expect a better pace.\\n\\nThey sat us at a terrible table right next to the service station.  The tables were so crammed together the server kept running into my chair. It became incredibly annoying.  There was also a lot of slamming of glasses and we even got to listen to the manager reprimand a server for bringing meat to a vegetarian. Not a pleasant experience when you are paying over $100 for Pizza.\\n\\nMy next issue was how the food was brought to the table.  We ordered the salad for a starter and no less than 2 minutes after we received it our 1/2 meter pizza arrived.  The pizza took up the entire table and we had to precariously push it to the side to try to eat with it on the table.  We let them take the salad because we didn't have room for plates for everything.  That was essentially $14 of food they threw away because they did not time it out properly. We didn't want to let the pizza get cold while we tried to finish the salad.\\n\\nThe food was all great and the servers are kind but they really need to pay more attention to how food is brought out especially when your pizza is the size of the table.\\n\\nI will probably go back again because the food is simply amazing but I am going to be very specific with the waiter not to bring out food on top of each other."},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"New in town, so we stopped here for drinks and to see what all the fuss was about after we passed it on a Friday night with its parking lot brimming.\\n\\nThe drinks are great, especially the Mexican Martinis.

We always make reservations early to secure a spot as they fill up quickly. I feel like many negative reviews have been because people didn't fully know what to expect. Breakfast and lunch are very casual. You order at a kiosk, seat your self, your food is delivered, and you fill your own drinks. Honestly, we love breakfast and lunch because it counts as a quick service meal on your dining plan. We feel this is the best quick service option as you have refillable drinks and air conditioned seating. Dinner is more formal dining and is considered a table service meal.

It's one of those things you might not think about very often. But when you eat a freshly made, hot, flaky biscuit you remember why. And when they're done right it can be an amazing culinary experience. Add butter, gravy, bacon, or chicken to the mix and it can be a downright taste bud revolution. I had one of these revolutions recently at Pine State Biscuits. Located in the Belmont district of PDX this small restaurant was bustling with customers and serving some tasty eats. Very earthy and inviting is the atmosphere of this laid-back joint that has been around since 2008. The seating is limited and 1st come 1st serve so if you have a large party be prepared to wait. Having brought the entire clan with me I felt the pain of trying to seat 6 people. It is, BTW, worth the wait. After agonizing over the menu choices (it all looks SO good) I decided to order,\\" The Reggie,\\" which consists of fried chicken, bacon, cheese and gravy. Without hesitation, I can say that the right decision was made. Or was it? Sweet monkeys, what have I done? Did I just ruin my expectations for every biscuit I would eat in the future? Was it too over the top with the superbly fried chicken, cheese and the bacon? \\n\\nOhhhhh, bacon... \\n\\nAnd let's not forget about the gravy. Made from scratch and just begging to have every last drop consumed, mopped up by the aforementioned king of the biscuits. This meal was such a delicious conundrum. A brief, way too brief, encounter with a dish that was eaten so quickly and with extreme delight it was over way too soon. The flavors of the buttery biscuit, the crunchiness and spices of the juicy chicken, salty bacon, cheese and the texture and flavor of the gravy made me want more. More of the perfection that is Pine State Biscuits. Fortunately, having some dignity and self control, I left Pine State Biscuits before I could do anything foolish. \\nBut I know things will be alright and It's OK because I will return, and will be bringing my appetite with me."},{"name":"Beulahland","address":"118 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The BF and I were STARVING on a recent trip to Portland and quickly did a U-turn when we saw the 30+ people in line at Screen Door.

So, you're probably wondering 'if the food and drinks are so good, why the three stars?!' Well... LET ME TELL YOU. The service?! Good lord. Wait times between dishes is insane. I saw one guy standing in the corner doing absolutely nothing.... crazy. Because we were sitting for 30 minutes as we waited between dishes... this was baffling because everything was ordered all together.  We actually had ordered the fingerlings and the diplomat burger but the service really derailed our night so we didn't enjoy those two plates as much as I think we could have.

I asked would they have made the nigiri sushi with less rice if I asked in the at the time of ordering. He said \\"no\\".\\n\\nSo, I paid the extra charge.

The reviews for Villa Nova are all over the board.  And I can understand why.  This was our first trip here (we were meeting friends who live nearby) and I came away with mixed emotions.  First, this is an old-style family restaurant.  If you don't like fairly noisy, large parties with children, you will not like this.  The decor is non-existent (no, a large collection of brass teapots is not decor).  The tables smallish and the chairs hard.  It is dark-ish.  \\"Hole-in-the-wall mom and pop\\" one reviewer wrote, Yep, that's it.\\n\\nHowever, at least this past Friday, the food was very, very good. Surprisingly so to someone (me) who can act a bit snobbish occasionally.  The salad was boring, truth be told but my wife's soup was excellent.  Chicken and pasta soup with chunks of moist meat and excellent broth. Unfortunately, they called it Italian Wedding Soup, which it is not.  The waitress said it was their version.  That is not acceptable. If it is chicken soup, call it chicken soup.  My wife was disappointed. I loved it.  I had the home-made spicy sausage in tomato sauce.  It was very good. Hearty.  It came with a a side of spaghetti ( actually fettuccine) and I asked for herb/garlic sauce.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was excellent.  Very tasty and not at all overpowering.  My wife had the eggplant Parmesan.  She loves the version at Basi Italia and likes how they crisp the eggplant so it isn't a soggy mess.  She asked if they did that here and the waitress replied they did it \\"kinda\\" crisp but that the kitchen could do it longer if she liked. She ask for it that way. It came crisp in a very good tomato sauce. She ate every bite.  I liked that personalize touch and the unsolicited offer from the waitress.  One friend had fried perch, which was very simple and, he said, very good.  The other had a small pizza which she loved.  All in all the food, on this visit at least, was very, very good and all seemed home-made.  And the prices were extremely reasonable. We would go back happily based on this visit.\\n\\nIt seems you take this place for what it is; a friendly neighborhood family-friendly place of no ambiance but good food and  very fair prices.  A great alternative to many higher-priced, less satisfying Italian choices.  \\n\\nAnd the waitress was very friendly, very helpful and very efficient. \\n\\nThe food and value would give it four stars usually, but the atmosphere keeps it at three. Think a strong three and a half.\\n\\nNote: I read many comments on the fettuccine Alfredo.  Why would anyone ever order this anyway??  Except in expert hands this is a hoary cliche of bland nothingness.  It is the last thing I would order (which is why the menu's listing of Spaghetti Carbonara as \\"pasta, bacon, and Alfredo sauce was not only an inaccurate incarnation of Carbonara (which I love) but almost made me gag to read it).

That makes perfect sense because real men shop at home depot and eat BBQ, right?  I frequent the great restaurant next door, so I noticed it was taking a long, long time to get this place open. On Saturday night a friend and I decided to run over to Home Depot and thought we would check to see if it was open.  Yep, it was...with a line out the door..apparently opening night!  Now generally I would never subject myself to a restaurant opening...too many kinks to work out..but Hog Wild had a reputation and I wanted to see if it would transfer to the new place.

It came with a side of a delightfully nuanced hot sauce, the kind of taste that makes you sit up and take notice, and my DC ate every bit of her Goat Biryani.\\n\\nWhen the time came to pay the check we each took out our credit cards, only to be informed that Tawakal is cash only. With no ATM in sight, we had a moment of panic. What would we do? Wash dishes? Scrub the floor? I sank back into my sadness, and left it to my able-minded friend to figure out how to handle the situation. \\n\\nThen the most amazing thing happened. Our waiter offered to let us pay them later.

It was such an incredible leap of faith, and it restored my confidence in humanity at a time when my confidence was at an all-time low. \\n\\nMy experience at Tawakal did much more than simply fill my stomach - it also soothed my soul. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to broaden their culinary horizons - just don't rely on credit cards and don't expect an adult beverage! \\n\\n(And yes, we paid them for our meal that night.

I've had most of the menu, but the often on menu off-menu lobster roll is by far the best.  They make it a little different every time, but the best I ever had was with a heavy dose of tarragon.

They could get pretty mushy, though. And that seems to be a common problem with homemade veggie burgers. They get mushy.\\nThe main solution I've seen is to deep fry the suckers, but then that does seem to ruin the point if you're eating these to be \\"healthy\\". \\n\\nThe Hub does a great job at having a well-flavored veggie patty.

The place has a cool ambiance and we got the private room in the back which was great for this type of event.  Our server (wish I remembered his name but he had red hair) was AWESOME. Super responsive and friendly, pre empitively ensuring our tabs were split appropriately. Unfortunately this is the end of good things I can say about this restaurant. \\n\\nAt first, drinks were really slow to come out which at first I figured was just because we had a large group. However when we started to get the wrong drinks and wildly different versions of the same cocktail we realized it was just the bartenders were messing up.  Fine,shit happens but we told our waiter he immediately asked the bar to replace fix it, but he told us the bar tender laughed in his face and said no way the drink could be wrong (the drink tasted like a gin and tonic rather than the gin lemonade cocktail without tonic we had  ordered). WOW.  The waiter was awesome and put another order in for us, we had ordered 2 and the next time they came each drink tasted different. Not the waiters fault but apparently the bar tender could care less about consistency.\\n\\nWe were really excited for the food and ordered a bunch of pizzas, apps, small plates,etc to share among the 8 or so people at our table (our party had a total of 2 tables).  Beyond the food taking 25-30 mins (that's fine it is a nice restaurant) the food arrived LUKEWARM TO COLD.  The cheese on the pizza was barely melted.  And it wasn't just one dish with this problem.EVERY SINGLE DISH!!  \\n\\nThe food actually had a lot of potential but is it really that hard to serve it hot?  We complained to the manager who was pretty defensive although she conceded serving the food cold was not ok. Her excuse was that someone from the other table said their food was served at the correct temperature so this wasn't as big of a deal.  I would have expected an immediate apology rather than any note of defensiveness.  Her \\"solution\\" to the problem was to send us 1 order of calamari and 2 orders of Mac and cheese (albiet without the pork belly that made us do excited about this dish in the first place).  At least these were hot but this in no way made up for the other 12+ dishes we ordered that arrived cold.  In addition, she generously (note my sarcasm) comped $18 from our $280 check. To me, that is just an insult.\\n\\nHonestly I will never return to this restaurant and I hope the new management sees this review and ensures no other guest has to endure cold food and a  rude manager.  The only saving grace of the night was how friendly and nice the waiter was - even though he was the only waiter for our entire group.  If I were the owner, I would promote this  server to manager, hire a new bar tender, and purchase an extra warming oven for the kitchen.  The food would have been awesome if warm so not all hope is lost."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I loved having the opportunity to dine at Be Our Guest.

Service was unbearably SLOW.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I found this place in a search for Indian buffets.  While they only serve the buffet at lunch, we went for dinner anyway.  We started with complimentary papadams and chutneys.  We ordered one of the dinner combos for two, but the options were quite limiting.  The combos did not balance meat and vegetables, basically forcing either 3 meats/3 starches/1 veggie or 3 veggies/3 starches.  We tried asking our waiter to substitute meats and starches for veggies, but he said the combos were a fixed menu. Sigh, fine.  Fixed choice of tandoori chicken appetizer, tandoori chicken entr√©e, side of fish curry, side of vegetable curry it is.  The appetizer plate consisted of tandoori chicken (cubes of boneless kabob, okay flavor but not charred at all), pakoras (too stringy and oily), sambusa (normal), and more papadams.  The entr√©e of chicken was the highlight of the meal; the cook carried out a sizzling pan with our two tandoori-esque airline chicken breasts, garnished with bell pepper and onion.  The flavor was excellent and the texture of the meat had an almost creamy mouthfeel, which was certainly intriguing, though not definitively \\"good\\".  It is not the best tandoori chicken we have tried, but I would definitely order it again.\\n\\nWe both devoured our chicken, but neither of us liked the side of fish curry that accompanied it.  Soon after being served, we had flagged down our waiter to ask if we could swap the fish for a different dish.  We though he might say no again, but he brought over the manager, who agreed to substitute whatever side we wanted.  We opted for a different vegetable curry, and they said it would be right out.  In the meantime, we finished our chicken and appetizers, sipped our tea, and waited. And waited.  Our waiter seemed to have forgotten us for his newer tables, and there was no sign of the manager.  Our drinks were refilled and plates gradually cleared away as we reminded the waiter about the curry.  He went to check on it but then returned to the other tables, leaving us hopefully waiting again.  Eventually, we caught the manager's attention again and we asked to make the curry a to-go order now, since it was getting late.  He apologized and disappeared to the kitchen.  We waited again.\\n\\nThe stressed waiter eventually came by to refill drinks again, and we reminded him about the dessert that was included in the combo meal.  He soon returned with the bowl of 3 gulab jamuns, and we asked about the curry.  He legitimately seemed exasperated and almost smacked his forehead while exclaiming, \\"You still haven't gotten that?!\\".  We had seemed relatively patient this whole time, but we prodded to receive a little extra dessert to compensate for the wait.  The waiter gladly rushed back to the kitchen.  Finally, the cook brought out the long-awaited to-go bag, and the waiter brought a bowl with two more gulab jamuns (although, why did a dessert \\"for two\\" include only THREE donuts? Hm... Maybe this \\"bonus\\" serving was not that exceptional after all...).  Before he could walk away again, we asked for the check.\\n\\nThe dessert was tasty - warm sugar donuts are so comforting - but it was difficult to enjoy it when we had been mentally ready to leave for 40 minutes already.  We had not anticipated a 2hr dinner. It was frustrating to see two other tables that had arrived after we did to almost leave before us (they *would have* had they not been waiting a long time for their checks as well!).  And I sympathized with the waiter being the only floor staff that night, but really, there were only five tables occupied at even the busiest point and with almost no turnover.\\n\\nOverall, the service was shamefully SLOW, yet the food was decent.

My preference is that everything be immensely hot, while my girlfriend prefers just a small kick; they have always managed to nail both requests, regardless of the dish. On our most recent visit, we were introduced to Paneer Pakora, the complimentary mini-appetizer that evening, and we enjoyed it so much that we may have ordered another round if the Samosas weren't already on their way. \\n\\nWhat prompted me to finally review Zaika was the hyper-professional, no-questions-asked, completely positive way in which management dealt with an issue on our bill. We ordered two servings of Naan, but only received one; we expressed that it was no big deal but asked that the order we never received be taken off the bill. The manager quickly printed a revised bill with BOTH orders removed and was very apologetic. \\n\\nI don't anticipate going anywhere else in the area for Indian.

While waiting for the aromas to boil, carefully admire the craftsmanship of the half & half broth - original with delicate overtones of meat, gogi berry, scallion, cardamom and other herbs and spicy with that Szechuan-style kick of red pepper and peppercorn. \\n\\nFor slightly above cheap, select a wide assortment of proteins, fresh vegetables, and noodles. Recommend trying at least one thinly sliced meat as it just takes 5-10 seconds to cook in the piping hot broth before eating. The pork shoulder is a good example with beautiful marbling on the meat. For a longer cooking time of about 3-5 minutes, try the house meatball platter with an assortment of fish, shrimp, beef, and lamb meatballs. Bok choy adds your green vegetable and oyster mushrooms and daikon provide additional texture contrast. Soft tofu is also pleasant dipped in either broth. \\n\\nDIY cooking while dining out is always a nice break from the ordeals at some restaurants. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the broth.

The waitress finally came but I could tell that we must have messed up the seating because she seemed put out also.  Oh well, we were really nice because again we were not going to let her poopoo on our night.\\nOn a positive note, she gave a great recommendation for wine and food, once she got over the shock that we were sitting in her station.\\n\\nFood was tasty!\\nWine was great!\\nBut I do not recommend for a romantic dinner or anniversary dinner!\\n\\nGo to Uchi's where they treat you like a star, no matter who you are."},{"name":"Wondermade","address":"214 E 1st St","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"Sanford is filled with so many gems.  This one has the potential, just need to give it a good shine!\\n\\nCame in while waiting for my table to be ready at a nearby restaurant and to get away from the heat.  Thank goodness they have iced coffee and Lineage coffee at that!  The space is intimate with just a few tables with a view of the kitchen where they make the marshmallows. All I had was the coffee.  I didn't get to try the marshmallows and they ran out of rice krispies.  But, the sales person was very friendly and cheerful.  We enjoyed the nice AC and chilled bottled cokes.  I'll come back when they have more flavors of marshmallows and those rice Krispy treats"},{"name":"√±o√±os tacos","address":"102 W Powell Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow that is good food!

Service has been spot on each time with professional,  knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Food is delicious. Layers of flavor that you just don't find in your average meal.  Definite party for your taste buds.\\n\\nAlthough portions are small I left full but not feeling bloated.  The room itself is a bit dated and sparse but spaced nicely so you feel comfortable not cramped. Prices are high, but worth it for a twice a year splurge or for a special occasion.  \\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"Pizzeria Italia","address":"2923 Vineland Rd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!! I ordered pizza and garlic knots from them at 8:09pm and was told it would be delivered in 45 minutes. I was staying 13 minutes away from them so it was no biggie. But after and hour waiting I got concerned and had one hungry toddler running around, so I called and was told that the driver got lost and went to the main gate of the hotel we were staying at. Very confused by that I just said ok well how much longer till it gets here? She said 10-15 minutes. Then 30 minutes pass by and I called again then was put on hold for almost 5 minutes. They said the driver was on his way. Waited another 15 minutes and by this time not only were we starving but beyond mad. I called and wanted to know where the driver was and how can it take over 2 hrs to deliver a pizza? And they had no answer but said they would give me half. I told them no I want all of my money back and the girl who was on the phone with me was talking to someone in the background. I kept asking to speak to a manger and she kept telling me that since I ordered through yelp I have to go through them. I kept telling her I understand that but still wanted to speak to a manger. We went round and round 4 or 5 times( by now I'm so aggravated I'm yelling) finally she lets me speak to the manger I explain what's going on and her response is well we are extremely busy. Now I'm frustrated and tell her what does you guys being busy right now have to do with my order if supposedly it's been on it's way for an hour and 15 minutes? She had no answer and I tell her I can't believe you it's actually do business like this and treat customers this way. She tells me I'm going to just cancel your order and I tell her well no my family and I need to eat and she tells me order from somewhere else and hangs up on me. \\n\\n\\nHow these people are still in business is beyond me. I work in customer service and I could never imagine treating someone the way they treated me. Never will I or anyone in my family ever order from them while in Florida. \\n\\nI would give them negative stars but sadly had to give them one to write this post. \\n\\nPLEASE ORDER FROM ELSEWHERE!!

Perfect spot to hit up before a Blue Jackets game. All 4 of us were really happy with the place. \\n\\nChipotle Grilled Wings- I like trying things that are different. You never see grilled wings at restaurants. They're always super unhealthy and deep fried. These were the bomb. So much flavor. I'd definitely order them again. \\n\\nDragonfire Burger w/ perogies- I'd get the diablo sauce in the side, and just add a little to the burger. It gives it the perfect kick. Ordered medium well but came out medium, but the person who ordered it didn't mind at all. \\n\\nCure For What Ales You Burger with onion straws- if you like breakfast food, you have to get this. Ground bratwurst patty, hasbrown, bacon, fried egg. It's a huge sandwich, and the person who ordered it said they'd come back for it. Onion straws were a perfect compliment. \\n\\nBarleys Hot Chicken- it's bone in, but very good white meat. Grits were good, and the veggies were surprisingly good. \\n\\nChristmas Ale- not overly dark or strong, on the lighter side of x-mas ales. Very good\\n\\nScottish Ale- my personal favorite beer we tried here."},{"name":"Brentwood Social House","address":"1601 W Koenig Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love, love Brentwood Social House! I am English and it's soooo hard to find good, authentic English food in Austin, and this place has it, and then some!! Sausage rolls, pies, pasties, quiche and more for those who like their food savory, and scones, tarts, and cakes for those with a sweeter tooth. Lovely selection of tea, and very good coffee. They even had pickled onion Monster Munch last time I was in!!\\n\\nThere are several rooms to sit in... one is for families with kids, and I believe one is a quiet room for working. There's also a big room where all the social hubbub goes on, but it's a nice setup where the tables aren't too cramped together, like in a lot of places.
