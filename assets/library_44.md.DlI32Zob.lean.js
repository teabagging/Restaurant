It certainly did not disappoint then, and continues to impress me currently. One of the most popular items, that also happens to be naturally GF, is caprese salad: house-made fresh mozzarella cheese on top of cherry tomatoes, some kind of cheese crisp, and balsamic vinegar. Incredible. They also offer GF table bread, GF hamburger buns, and they recently added a statement to their menus saying that essentially every main dish can be made GF except for the pasta. Fantastic. It goes without saying that the food is very good and chances are that Martin, one of the owners, will come out and regale you with a great story about the particular bottle of wine you have picked for your meal.\\n\\nZ's Review: * * * * *\\nThis may sound a bit silly, but I get excited just walking in the door at 4580. When you come in, the hostess always offers to take your coat, which just makes me feel special and at home.

That time I had a delicious flank steak. We also took a friend there for her birthday and I enjoyed a juicy chicken dish and an amazing gluten-free dessert. Last week we took my mother there and, for the first time since becoming gluten-free, I had a hamburger with a bun at a restaurant. It was amazing! The menu at 4580 changes with the season, so there is always something new to try. And, with the exception of the pasta dishes, 4580 is willing to prepare anything on the menu gluten-free!

We then had the stuffed peppito peppers. They were okay but too sweet; the sweet pepper topped with honey glaze was too much sweetness and not enough savoriness.  Then the charred fig bruschetta.  The figs were inedible, burned, acrid remains of fig that had to be removed before we ate the cheesy bread underneath.  The ricotta lemon ravioli was next.  We only had a couple bites before returning it. Odd flavor combination, horrible mushrooms in the sauce, and some flavor we couldn't put our finger on that was something similar to dishwater.  Gnocchi was next. It was raw in the middle, flavorless, and just didn't work.  The sauce was mediocre and nothing about the dish was cohesive at all.  We had two other dishes ordered but we canceled them and left to put an end to the stream of disappointing dishes. All of this was complemented with extraordinarily slow service.  The restaurant was barely full with maybe six other tables seated and we spent the better part of an hour on this experience.

Finally the beer arrives over ten minutes later, and the surly waitress took my order.   After the pizza arrived there was never any follow up to verify all was good or to refill my water. Grrrr.

Kudos to him, maybe the other staff can take note.\\n\\nThe beer was pretty good, being Double Mountain and all.   The pizza was pretty good too, though only about 90% of the flavor and char you get at the Hood River location.

I don't really know my Mexican groceries, but seems like a small but comprehensive selection to me. For what it's worth, I thought the prices were a bit expensive for the deli food because it's all pre-made and is nuked to warm.

We knew we wanted to defintitely go out somewhere, but was unsure if there would be anything good to get into on a Wednesday night. I immediately did my research to see if there were any places that weren't too far from the hotel that we were staying at, which was right outside of the Buckhead Area, about a block away from the Brookhaven MARTA station. After we got back from the game, which the Yankees won by the way, haha...we headed back to the hotel to change, and then the night was about to begin.\\n\\nWe drove up to Moondogs and parked across the street in front of some businesses, b/c it was free. I knew my car would be safe there. As we approached Moondogs, there were people enjoying drinks on the outside patio at Peachtree Tavern (a place that was in the same complex as Moondogs). We got our ID's checked, and up the stairs we went. As soon as we walked up the stairs and walked to the left, I immediately thought, \\"This is it.\\" Well I learned quickly that there was way more to this place than what I saw from just walking up the stairs. We started off with a pitcher of beer, which was very reasonably priced...chatted with the bartender for a bit and she kinda gave us the 411 on the place. We started walking around and I thought I was in heaven. There were two official sized beer pong tables (which we did play on), pool tables, corn hole, a jukebox, foosball tables....basicially a mans dream. I think I fell in love with the room that played nothing but HIP HOP. I'm a big fan of all genres of music, but if you wanna get your dance on, hip hop/top40 usually helps. They had other parts of the place that played other genres of music.\\n\\nI read reviews on the place before we went, but I've always been the kinda person that walked into places or situations with no expectations, so I wanted to see it for myself. I kept reading that the floors were discusting, but I didn't encounter that, and I wore flip flops and I am a self-proclaimed germaphobe, haha. Maybe the floors were clean b/c it was the first day it was open for the week and it was closed for 3-4 days and maybe what's when they clean the floors???? Who knows. I also read that it was a frat hangout and a college hangout. I didn't really witness that either. There was a good male to female ratio in the house. I'm about 5 years removed from college and I had a blast.\\n\\nThe only thing that I really didn't like about the place was the mens bathroom. It was small as a closet and there was one big a*s stainless steel urinal that wrapped around the whole bathroom. It looked like a sink that you might find at a barn or something that animals might drink water from, haha. I wasn't feeling the bathroom b/c I'm kinda uncomfortable standing next to another man with no kinda privacy or partician between us. I don't need anybody checking out my stuff, haha. \\n\\nWe wanted to check out \\"Hole in the Wall,\\" which was located downstairs, but we had so much fun at Moondogs, we never left.

The waiter gave us water and told us that the waitress would get our orders.  After about 15 min we saw the one waitress take the order of the couple who was seated after us.  My husband decided to leave as we had been there for almost 25 min.  I stopped her and asked her if she realized that we had been seated first.  With no apology, she said we \\"weren't her table\\" --that it was the one waiter (who was constantly on the phone).

The food is a bit pricier than most pho places in Portland but since they were having a promotion it was a pretty good deal. Plus we got free drinks and free things are always great. Waiting to pay took a good 20 minutes because it took a while to flag someone down. I understand that this is a new establishment so it takes some time for them to get in the rhythm of things.

My boyfriend prefers the pork hash which is on the sweeter side but we also enjoy the huevos rancheros. Whatever you get you will not be leaving hungry, or really full of energy, this is more of a \\"will have food baby afterward\\" brunch. \\n\\nDrinks: Nice selection of cocktails, reasonably priced for the size, personal favorites: pearl white (gin, lillet, fresh lemon juice & mint), beehive (jameson Irish whiskey, honey\\nliquer, fresh lemon juice). Nice selection of beers, ports, etc as well. \\n\\nDinner: I love, love, love the goat stew. I would not recommend this if you're not into spicy (it's not THAT spicy but if you have no tolerance, stay away). The stew is usually why we go there (when I have a hankering). Whoever I'm with, we usually get some sides (buffalo buss els, devils on horseback, etc..) and some oysters (most likely on the specials menu) or mussels to start. The fish and chips dinner is HUGE as is their po boy sandwich. Mushroom and barley \\"risotto\\"  is a nicer lighter option, which also lends itself well to leftovers. \\n\\nStaff: Everyone there is always attentive and helpful, no complaints at all about the working crew."},{"name":"Eleven at Reunion Resort","address":"7593 Gathering Dr","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"Awful service .

Five minutes later he returned and we ordered 2 caesars. We wanted to order our brunch food at the same time but again he abruptly turned and walked away. We waited over 15 minutes for our drinks. In the meantime there was a manager walking around who would glance in our direction but did not register at all that we were still sitting there with nothing but water (that we were not drinking), menus closed and ready to order for almost 20 minutes at this point. When the caesars were finally brought over all the ice was melted and they had obviously been sitting on the bar for quite some time.

Where do I begin...\\n\\nMy brother and I stopped in last week for lunch, excited at the prospect that a decent pho place finally opened up near our neighborhood. For years we have making the trek to downtown's Little Vietnam whenever our inevitable pho cravings strike (usually once a week). Considering the gushing reviews and attractive photos, I was very hopeful about this place.\\n\\nInitial impressions: Tiny, trendy, upscale. The dining room probably had 10 or so tables and there were 3 more outside. When brother and I arrived around 2:30PM, at least half of the tables in the dining room were occupied so we opted to sit outside where it was cool and quiet. The table we chose needed to be cleared and I noticed that there was a bowl of pho still half full with broth on the table (not a good sign). \\n\\nOur server, Bridgette, was very sweet and a little green. I think she got confused when my brother and I started ordering in Vietnamese but she played it off well. She also pronounced PHO like FAUX but I saw no need to correct her due to the hilarity of it. Let's just say it all went down hill from there. \\n\\nA list of the pho-pas (see what I did there?):\\n\\n1. We ordered summer rolls but we were given fish sauce for dipping instead of the peanut sauce. I also found the peanut sauce tasted too much like peanut butter so I had to add a squirt of hoison to make it sweeter.\\n\\n2. My brother's Thai Iced Tea came out in a cracked glass and the split slowly grew once it got to our table. I really wanted to catch the explosion on video but Bridgette noticed both of us staring intently at the beverage and scurried it away swiftly. \\n\\n3. I ordered Pho Tai (eye round steak) with no onions or scallions, in a regular size bowl. My brother ordered Pho Ga (chicken) with all the fixings in an extra large bowl. Somehow our orders got mixed up. My pho tai came out in an extra large bowl with scallions and onions. My brother's pho ga came out in a small bowl with no onions or scallions. Bridgette blamed the kitchen, but I had another theory.\\n\\n4. The broth was bland. After removing all of the scallions and onions from my bowl, I added the usual proportions of hoison, sriracha, and lime. Much to my dismay all of these flavors overwhelmed the pho and I couldn't taste the broth. The only flavors that seemed to stand out were the cloves and star anise. If I had to give them some advice, it would be to add less cloves and more marrow bones.\\n\\n5. Just like the person before me, I left the bowl half full with broth because it wasn't worth the stomach space. When Bridgette came to clear the table, she stacked the bowls in an effort to save a trip. Unfortunately this resulted in a huge amount of pho being spilled onto my brother's lap (thank goodness it wasn't hot anymore) and he was not amused. We could see that Bridgette felt horrible about it so we decided not to make a fuss. \\n\\nMaybe I have high expectations when it comes to pho but ultimately this place failed to satisfy me. If I come back at all, it won't be for pho. I dislike the prices but I understand they are high because of the surrounding area. The restaurant itself is very stylish and clean (which is good considering it just opened) but the positives stop there. I'd rather go downtown for some authentic pho that's $2 cheaper. \\n\\nI'm giving it one more star than it deserves because I know the Lake Mary folk will like this place. Pho is a risky business and the owners are brave for taking it out of Downtown's Little Vietnam. I have no doubt they will be successful in this location.\\n\\nMy review in the format of a short poem: \\n'Tis a shame, iPho is such a clever name. \\nIf only the broth were worth returning,\\nthen my wallet would really be hurting."},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"My girlfriend and I have been coming here for a while now, and it's always been a great comfort food go-to.

Unfortunately the bulk of the higher quality Vietnamese eateries are not on the downtown peninsula, and are instead found around Kingsway just a bit outside of downtown.  \\n\\nBut it doesn't stop me from trying a new one that opens up.  This is a small little space which has been nicely converted to have two communal dining tables.  The decor is a slight step above the typical hole in the wall, with some interesting pictures of the owner from her earlier years in Vietnam.  Her son was behind the register taking orders and bringing the food.  They seem like a nice family and were very friendly.   \\n\\nWe tried two dishes:\\n\\n- B√°nh cuon (rice rolls). The rice rolls were cooked to the proper level, although not served in roll form - they were falling apart a little bit.  They were covered with fried onions, pork floss (which was surprisingly non-porky), and some fried shallots.  They were accompanied by sliced Vietnamese ham (once again not very porky tasting), some diced basil and cilantro, and some iceberg lettuce.  The dipping sauce was not the typical nuoc mam pha, and instead was more pork based (perhaps  Northern Vietnamese style?).  The dipping sauce was quite a  pleasant change from the typical one, with tender pork chunks and diced bird chilli peppers to pack a punch.  The greens selection could have been a lot more interesting, and I would have preferred additional herbs instead of iceberg lettuce.

It was a gentle soothing broth with no detectable MSG.  The clear noodles were cooked nicely.  The squid was masterfully scored, and not chewy at all.  The shrimps were decent, but the texture was just slightly off.  I could do without the imitation crab (I always could do without that at all restaurants though!).

My boyfriend ordered a chicken dish and he gobbled that baby up so at least he was happy with his food. However, this review isn't about the entrees. This review is about the dessert and our waiter. So, we were on vacation and in Portland for one night and we decided to try Picnic House based on Yelp reviews and our growing hunger and we sat around our hotel room. The food was a disappointment (for me at least) but we decided to order a S'more Pudding for dessert because we are chocolate fiends. Placed the order and within a few minutes our waiter came back and had to tell us they were all out but he managed to nab the last happy hour version of the S'more pudding and because they weren't able to give us the full size dessert, the mini version was on the house. BOOO but sweet! Oh man, that pudding was amazing. We devoured all four bites within seconds. It was tiny to begin with but we would go back to Portland just for that pudding.

Then the bartender began to chat with the couple in a very familiar way - no doubt his friends. NOT COOL. It was reflected in the tip. Sorry to the other bartender who was nice to us- talk to your buddy about it. Dinner was good. Standard sort of southern comfort food.

The Prime Burger ($15) is a tall one, staring right back at you like many classic pub-looking burgers before it. The menu offers no hint of what's to come, but after digging a little deeper I learned this burger comes with a Port Wine aioli,  crispy tobacco onions, served on a Hi-Rise potato roll and a side of vinegar slaw. Interesting that none of that is listed on the actual menu and even more interesting that I probably found it more favorable before I learned all that, since you could barely taste any of it. But I digress; it's forgivable because it's quite delicious no matter how you slice it.\\n\\nThe beef and the beef alone is the clear star of this burger. It may seem obvious but too frequently burgers are engulfed by too many toppings and misguided choices of buns and accompaniments. There is no hidden agenda regarding the Beat burger: it's beefy, thick, juicy throughout, and seasoned just about as flawlessly as you can get. Grill marks give it some decent char, which creates a bitter element that works well to counteract the big, bold, beefy flavors that are fully represented. It is cooked to medium-rare mostly across the board and those juices are slow and steady, seeping into the bun which is sturdy and holds it all in. At first glance the bun looks like an oncoming train-wreck because it appears much too tall and thick. However, despite being over-toasted with a crunch that is borderline excessive, the bun is actually light on the inside and ultimately is a wise choice for those aforementioned juices. Melted cheddar (an extra 50 cents) is assertive, very pronounced, and easily worth the price of admission. The aioli was nowhere to be found, and I'm still convinced it was not even on there, and a few sprinkles of not super crispy tobacco onions end up mushy under the bun and pressed up against the patty. The side slaw is refreshing and light, high on the vinegar and not a bad couple of bites after such a rich and decadent burger. A side of fries are similar to The Beehive; thick slices are presented differently from the norm and are crazy crispy and even crazier on the salt content, bordering on much too salty but definitely better over than under seasoned.\\n\\nThe burger at the Beat Hotel isn't necessarily original but it hardly matters. I'm, okay with the $15 fee because you can tell the quality of the beef and it is executed the right way. The fries, slaw and bun work their magic but the beefy, salty and juicy burger that is the showcase really comes through."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Although it would be a tough call, I think if I absolutely had to pick this would be the best meal of my life.  My husband and I went for a belated Valentine's Day dinner, and it was spectacular.

The only bite of the entire meal I didn't absolutely love was the steak tartare with quail egg.\\n\\nThe charcuterie plate was beautiful, the chicken liver mouse and foie gras with sauternes gelee being my favorite.  The cheese course was fun and the dessert was heaven. Normally I believe if its not chocolate, its not dessert, but the sticky toffee pudding completely changed my view on that.  At $300 for a couple to do the dinner and wine pairings (tip included!), it is a pricey night out for me, but it was worth every penny for a special night out."},{"name":"Pho Zen","address":"15936 SE Happy Valley Town Ctr Dr","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"So happy to finally have a Ph≈ç Restaurant near my home.

Teenie tiny place on the corner. So small I drove right by it even using GPS. Plenty of street parking for a Sunday afternoon. I always mention to the staff if this is my first time here which usually brings out happier than normal faces and plenty of suggestions. I got the normal cheeseburger and fries combo. Their standard is medium well. Thankfully they told me this and I was able to switch it to medium rare. They really push their \\"special sauce\\". I got it on the burger and was even convinced to get a side of it for the fries. Had to get the order to go though. Like I said the place is tiny but the bigger problem is the smoky air. I would of smelled like a burger and fries if I had stayed any longer. While sitting in my car nibbling on the well done fries I realized I forgot my drink and went back. I would say about 10 minutes had gone by before I opened up the burger from the foil wrapper. The bottom bun was very soggy. The patty was medium with barely any visible pinkness. The burger was yummy though and I made quick work of it. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area. \\n\\nPROS- Very happy staff with good burgers, \\nCONS- Smoky and small\\nNEUTRAL- Special sauce.

Since I am currently on a life long quest for the perfect burger, I had to give it a try.\\n\\nLee's is a tiny place, only 2 or 3 tables, so take out is the way to go.  The menu is focused on what they do best, burgers, fries, some subs, but burgers are what they are about.  Nothing fancy in their options, simple toppings and a few size options.  The regular size burger is plenty large enough.  All toppings are free and the secret sauce they use is unique and differentiates them from other places.  The sauce is sweet and unlike other burger toppings, but will not disappoint.  Buns were fresh and perfectly sized adding to the overall high marks.\\n\\nPrices are great here, you will not bust a budget.

I love bone marrow as a savory dish but it just seemed too bone marrow-y to be an ice cream flavor (for me). I also tried the honey lavender which was recommended. I ultimately went for the strawberry balsamic (amazing) and Oregon honey rocky road (so good).

The dessert dish was pretty decent and had some potential, but then the grease started oozing.  Maybe cut back on grease?  It didn't take much to convince myself the food wasn't worth it and I moved on to making food at the house.

We are huge fans of Chuy's and wanted to try Chevys for something different, but we will stick to our regular spot. The food wasn't nearly as good overall, and the service was uncomfortable, though I suspect our guy is new so I tried not to let it bother me. \\n\\nStarters: I will say the queso is really good here! I got a margarita made with my favorite tequila and the server dumped the side shot of cherry liqueur in before I had a chance to ask him to let me do it. I said I wasn't sure if I wanted that, and his exact words were, \\"This is what you ordered.\\" Okay. The drink did taste fine, but had far too much salt that had drifted to the bottom. Every sip was salty. \\n\\nI got a chicken chimichanga and the size was great for the price but overall left something to be desired. It wasn't crispy enough and was hardly anything but dark meat. Why not white meat? Everyone knows it's better for dishes like that. The best part was the queso on top, so I guess the moral of the story here is that their food is only edible with queso smothered on it.\\n\\nMy gf got the Baja plate which is not what Yelp's menu advertises. Chevys doesn't have bacon-wrapped shrimp, so her grilled shrimp just lay on a bed of rice. The shrimp was smaller than I would've expected. She did really like her plate! More than I did, I think.

We've been talking about going here for a long time, so it was cool to finally get to go.\\n\\nIf you don't already know, BEAST offers a 6 course menu that is set weekly, and their catch phrase seems to be \\"substitutions politely declined\\" which is their nice way of saying \\"This is what I'm serving tonight, and you're gonna eat it and you're gonna like it, or you can go home\\" so you better check on the menu for the week before you make reservations.  I watched the menu for a few weeks before I made our reservation, and I never saw them serve anything I wouldn't eat and probably love, but if you are a picky eater or on a restricted diet or vegetarian or mortally offended by meats such as veal or foie gras, then this is probably not a good choice for you.\\n\\nI have this odd phobia of being late for anything, so Janet and I were on time for our 6 o'clock seating.  I need not have worried about them starting without us (they have two large tables and everybody is seated and served together), as they didn't bring out the first course until the last couple had arrived and been seated, and they were just a little bit late (not that I noticed, haha).  The open kitchen is cool, unless like Janet and I, you are one of the six people seated with your back to the kitchen.  That was really my only disappointment, but most of the time I was too distracted by how awesome the food was to notice that there was a lot going on behind my back that I couldn't see.  The group seating was kinda fun, and in an odd twist of fate I was seated right across from a psychologist/therapist who works in the same special/alternative school program I work in.\\n\\nI'm not going to break down the whole menu, but I will touch on the high points.  The foie gras bon bon was effing splendid.  There was so much going on it made my eyes roll back.  It might be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth, food or otherwise.  The duck was awesome, like butter.  Desert was a little lemon tartlet sitting in a pool of chocolate sauce (decorated with gold flakes, I guess to soften the blow since they're about to bring you your bill for 100 bucks a person) and was also delicious.  The only course that didn't totally blow my mind was the beets with walnut lemon vinaigrette and some kind of fish.  It was still really good, it just wasn't quite as amazing as the other 5 courses.  The wine pairings are optional, but I strongly encourage you to go with them.  Each wine complimented the course it was served with very well, and I enjoyed getting to try six different wines in one meal.  I figured the meal would take about two and a half hours, and I was just about right, but it didn't feel like that long.  It was really a lot of fun and a cool experience, in addition to just being delicious.  I enjoyed going to a restaurant and not having to make a single decision.  Yeah, it was pretty spendy, but definitely worth it.\\n\\nIt was the best meal I've had in a long time, and one of the best meals of my life.  The only down side is of course the fact that the price is a bit restrictive (meaning that although I would love to go back next week, and every week after, at 100 dollars per person I cannot reasonably foresee another dinner at BEAST in my future since I am on a limited budget).  They offer a Sunday brunch for 28 dollars, which is still a lot for one meal, but something I can reasonably look forward to doing in the not too distant future.\\n\\nBEAST is awesome.  That's pretty much all you need to know."},{"name":"Istanbul'lu","address":"237 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Read my review here - http://zestandleisure.blogspot.com/2017/02/restaurant-review-istanbullu-somerville.html"},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Tube Form !\\nFinally, good food on \\"Dirty 6th\\"\\nEasy Tiger has more than 30 beers on tap.

I went there in the beginning of January and I am glad we came here! We got there a little before 6, we were told that we had to wait around 30 minutes, which ended up pretty accurate. The place was already pretty full with people occupying the bar seating area. The entire place in general definitely had a nice ambiance with moody lighting, but there was still a lighthearted atmosphere.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting I got a ginger beer which I think is from a AJ Stephans bottle. They do have homemade ginger beer but the bar does not tell you and you would have to specifically ask for it. I tried that later in the night and it was definitely very different. The homemade one's spiciness was more longlasting because they use special peppers and in general it had a very strong flavor that was more sweet. I like both of them, and I would say the one from the bottle was more mild in flavor. My mom wanted a drink of rum and coke and it was mixed perfectly.\\n\\nSo after we sat down and ordered appetizers, I have to say the food was definitely worth the wait! We ordered the Handmade Potato gnocchi, grilled corn, riccotta and mozzarella fritters, calamari and a cheese soup. The handmade gnocchi with rib ragout was absolutely amazing. The rib ragout was bursting with flavor that was so inviting and homey, which totally complemented the gnocchi. I think I could have just kept eating that the rest of the night. The portion came a in small bowl size but the dish itself was so rich that I don't think you need much more. The gnocchi itself was so soft, it was like eating a velvet cloud.The grilled corn was good with four pieces, and it was cooked perfectly. The cheese and garnish on it was salty yet savory, really good. The fritters were also good but I think for me personally, it wasn't out of this world? The honey dipping sauce was really a nice different touch that still makes this dish worth trying. I think the cheese inside wasn't melted enough for my taste. The calamari was a solid good and the portion of it was of a nice size. And the cheese soup came in a nice bowl size, very savory and good as well. \\n\\nWe were all soo full by the end of finishing the apps between the four of us! I couldn't believe that we still had entrees left, seriously. So we had decided on 3 entrees, the rabbit fettuccine, spicy jambalaya, and spicy coconut curried goat stew. For the ones we ordered, they were generally good but I think some were better than others. I was most excited about the rabbit dish but I think for me it ended up to be the most disappointing. The fettuccine for me was like really thick and I think it hampered down the delicateness of the rabbit. The pasta itself didn't really have a lot of flavor, I just only remember the thick texture and the starchy taste. I think the rabbit itself was okay, maybe slightly overcooked. The jambalaya with the duck was good and was a nice complement for the rice which was definitely infused with savory flavor. The goat stew was by far my favorite. The goat meat was tender and really went well with the stew. The flavors of this dish for me was the most dynamic in that it was salty, yet it was slightly sweet. Really powerful flavor. I also have to say for some reason as I ate these dishes that they didn't really jump at me with flavor at the table especially the rabbit dish. Maybe it was because I was so full already? I'm not sure. It was only as leftovers did I really feel the flavors came through more. So I would say the food isn't always perfect to my standards, which is why I give the food in general a 4/5. \\n\\nAs we left around 8 o clock, the place was definitely at its fullest with a crowd of people waiting for a table. I'm glad we kinda had beaten the rush even though we still had to wait.

Let me preface this review by saying that my expectation was well executed classic Italian dishes in an excellent / rustic setting. My comparable was Il Giardano. \\n\\nOrdered the fusilli pasta, sole and tiramusu.\\n\\nFirst, we were given the worst table in the restaurant right by the door. I suspect they reserve the worst section for dineout customers so be aware. Not a big deal, I guess I would reserve the better tables for the regulars too. \\n\\nThe server asked us what we wanted to drink. I'm not a wine expert but I like earthier / dryer wines so I asked her to recommend something. She immediately went to the most expensive wine on the list at $17 a pop. Normally I'm happy to try. The wine was good but was not particularly dry and not earthy at all. \\n\\nThe fussilli was supposed to come with shrimp, scallops and calamari but I guess they left those out that day and only included mussells. It was completely drenched in a heavy cream sauce such that you really couldn't taste anything else, i.e. the pasta itself, leaks or any of the seafood. I give it a 1/5. \\n\\nThe sole itself tasted kinda fishy and still had bones in it. The sole itself wrapped a filing of cheese, egg yolks, breadcrumbs and the filling itself was pretty good. Had the fish been fresher, it would have had a nice pillowy fluffy texture. What came with the fish was terrible. The potatoes had clearly been pre-cooked wayy too long ago such that it tasted of card board and the fish broth was a little salty. The worst thing about this was that the server was literally standing behind us holding our dishes while we finished our pastas and put the main down within 15 seconds of us finishing our first course. It really tasted like they'd just pre-cooked everything and kept it on the heat lamp to send out as fast as possible to turn tables. This dish is a 2/5. \\n\\nAs expected the dessert came out within a minute of us finishing our main. The tiramisu was good. It had a nice liquor taste, was heavy but also light, moist and all around delicious. The blueberries on top and strawberries on the side were very fresh. 5/5.\\n\\nAs they gave us our bill, server opened up the leather bill folder to see if I had put my card in within a minute of putting the bill down.\\n\\nOverall, food is 1/5. Service is 0/5. Atmosphere is 4/5 if you had a good table (not us). The food execution was amateur. Rather than executing on anything, they were pre-assembling poorly cooked ingredients and leaving it under a heat lamp. I would come here AFTER eating dinner for a dessert and coffee but not for anything else. If the service was substantially better, I would have given the restaurant a 2/5. \\n\\nIf you want rustic and classic italian around this price range, go to il giardano, the food and service is way better and executed properly, not pre-cooed and left under a heat lamp.\\n\\nI use dineout to try a lot of different restaurants and then stick to the few that I like throughout the year.

You may opt to enroll your work (if you work in a bar, restaurant or a hotel) in the free league by e-mailing meghan@lyonsgroup.com leagues are a 6 week commitment and the winner receives a free pizza party in the private room. \\n2. You can make a priority lane reservation -Which is a sit down dinner in the restaurant and you get bumped to the top of the waitlist for lanes. \\n3. Be here earlier than 9pm to put your name on the waitlist for bowling, if there is a list. You can also play pool in the mean time as that's free after 9 as well...The earlier you are the less time you have to wait!\\"\\n\\nMy response to this:\\n\\n1. Well I guess that was the league that took up all the lanes making the list long. Good option if you want to make that commitment but there is no advertisement that I could find of this league with the advertisement I saw about free bowling.\\n\\n2. So this is probably why a bunch of other lanes weren't available and why the wait time was so long for everyone else.\\n\\n3. This is blatantly untrue.

That way you can get seated in the first round (I would say they seat about 50 people) or else you will have to wait!\\n\\nI came here at 9:30 on Saturday and there was already an hour wait. I ended up leaving and going to another establishment. I came back the next day and our group waited in line at 8:45AM. Luckily we were seated within the first round PHHEW!\\n\\nOur server was Lindsay and her service was divine with a lots of sass (but in a good way!) We were seated next to another group and shared a table with them. FYI: I didn't know where to put my big purse that I brought but luckily there are hooks under the table where you can hang them \\n\\nWhat we ordered:\\n\\n-Potato Donuts: I can probably eat a million of these. They were so crispy on the outside but on the inside, it was so light and fluffy. I'm not a big fan of donuts but the potato donuts got my stamp of approval! \\n\\n-French Toast: A very refreshing French toast glazed with berries. I really like that it was not too thick of a bread and loved the tarte fruit taste with it.\\n\\n-Bacon Wrapped Dates: I love a good bacon wrapped date. It was really sweet and delicious however I thought the bacon was a little too thin for my liking.\\n-Polenta: The polenta was very hearty! Although small, be aware that it a filler and will get you full in a heavy way!\\n\\n-Burmese Red Pork Stew Over Rice with Egg with a side of Kimchi (recommended by Lindsay): This dish was topped with sweet meat and a fried egg. Absolutely delicious especially with the kimchi. Definitely order a side of kimchi to accompany this dish!\\n\\n-Shakshuka: The shakshuka was very peppery. Egg porn content!!! The grilled bread added a nice smokey touch.\\n\\n-Morracan Hash: The best dish for last. I felt like the potatoes were accompanied greatly with the egg. If you look at my picture, you can see that the egg was broken before I can take a picture by my lovely bf. Eager beaver couldn't wait since it looked so yummy.\\n\\nOverall: Tasty n Sons was my favorite food spot during our Portland foodie trip. Our waitress was the best and I hope you all will get to experience Tasty n Sons with Lindsay (her humor and sass was everything!) She was so confident in the way she described her food suggestions to us that we ended up ordering everything. I liked that she stopped us before we could order any more food O_O!

For a place with \\"shack\\" in the name, this place is deceiving because it's actually quite swanky inside.

For entrees, I split the crabmeat club and the BBQ bluefish with the lady.  The club was as you would expect and came with some pretty decent baked beans and slaw - again good, but not outstanding.  He bluefish didn't seem very BBQ'd to me, more like blackened and also came with slaw.\\n\\nI had a taste of the crab cakes which were...meh, and a steamer which was very good.

I went on a Wednesday night, early, around 5:30 so things were kind of slow, but that meant for excellent service. We had to make a 7 o'clock show, and were able to get in three courses including the souffle for dessert, without rushing through our food, probably because our server was so attentive. \\n\\nI had the french onion soup as an appetizer, I love french onion soup so they would have to really screw it up for me to not like it--regardless, it was delicious. My dinner partner had the goat cheese salad to start--it was great, especially for the price! (It can be hard to find a reasonably priced goat cheese salad in Boston!). As an entree I had the smoked salmon risotto, which was decent and my partner had the skirt steak which came with green beans and french fries, all of which were delcious! As mentioned earlier we had the souffle for dessert which was probably my favorite part.\\n\\nStaying consistent with my love for the dessert, I would love to go back and try  more things on the dessert menu which looks just AWESOME.

Now from the name itself I was intrigued when I first moved to Boston, and my excitement was somewhere between lukewarm to microwave warm. \\n\\nAlas, a few observations. First of all, its great that there is a huge variety of foods on the menu with just about every single combination of noodle, meat, sauce, soup, veggie, that you could imagine. But for a first time user, I was confused beyond belief. I'm talking like a full five-ten minutes of just wondering what the hell to get. While the pictures do a good job of showing you what order you should decide in order to get to the end product, it further confused me by adding lines of pre-comboed dishes to order. And top that with a deceiving \\"lunch combo\\" which for an extra $1.25 you get a soda and an appetizer, which turns out the appetizer is whatever you ordered placed on top of your entree order in such a way that you almost don't notice you got the appetizer. I can't believe that the appetizer (2 crab rangoons), wasn't $1.25 normally, because I would definitely not pay $4 for that.\\n\\nBesides the confusing menu, the food is so-so. For the same price or less (or a buck more), you can go to Brown Sugar and get better food. The portion size isn't too bad, and the flavors are pretty well done, but when you combined all the elements you get a place that isn't much better than Super 88's food court. \\n\\nLike everyone says, I would never have a distinct craving (as I would for Crispy Pad Thai from Brown Sugar or Pho from Pho Basil), nor would I think of Noodle Street at the first sign of a desire to have asian food, but for the location right next to the black hole of the library, its not so bad.

I would have like to see a little more on the plates and WARM bread!!!  Other then that, I like this place.\\n\\nDessert:  GOOD Tiramisu !!  So far the best in Canada that I have tasted.  (but not the best I have ever tasted).  Most Tiramisu I have tasted in Canada are too sweet, To much like pudding and mostly a huge disappointment.  This was very close to being AWESOME, it needs a touch more sweetness to it, NOT MUCH PLEASE.

The food was moderately priced and served hot. I ordered steak quesadillas and a side of refried beans. Each bite was loaded with tender steak cooked to perfection,  cheese and grilled onions (that I requested extra). The beans were to die for. They had small pieces of meat mixed in.  I had to ask what was in the beans that gave it that extra something. It was bacon. Who would've known? I wanted some to go for breakfast the next day. Also, the chips and salsa were complementary and very good.  The salsa had a smoky flavor with a bite.  Its consistentcy was more chunky than smooth with tomatoes and  onions. So good.

The heat of the BBQ cause can creep up on you a bit.\\n- Corncake: always a favorite of ours, especially with the jalape√±o butter.\\n- Maize: just like the corn at the county fairs, but better!\\n\\nThe service we received made up for the hiccup earlier in the evening and overall our food was great. We greatly appreciated the additional dishes on the house, but my fianc√© was unable to enjoy the samoa sundae because of his allergy.

I wanted to surprise my mom with carrot cake today for mother's day, however the hostess informed that they were not accepting to-go orders.

I would have loved to bring my mom in today, however, as I explained, she is a stage 4 cancer patient and coming in was just not an option. Of all the things to bring her on Mother's Day, this carrot cake would have made her day. I understand it is busy today. I can understand not accepting to-go orders for entrees that are prepared to order, but the carrot cake is made and just needed to be boxed.

I personally would rather a restaurant have a smaller menu of good wines, than 100 for me to choose from and be disappointed. \\nThe bread was hot and fresh with a lovely infused olive oil on the table for dipping. \\nThe service was ok. At times the server seemed distracted or would disappear for long stretches but it never got to a point where it was a problem. \\nThe real push into three stars for me was the management.

And she gave us all a free round of Moscato to accompany our desert. \\n\\nThe Bad:\\nI was disappointed in my meal completely. I ordered the special of the day, which was the seafood angel hair pasta. The shrimp and scallops seemed fresh and were cooked to be done, but they lacked any sort of flavor. The sauce was runny and completely unflavorful. I would definitely not recommend. \\nThat was pretty much the consensus of the table. Nothing was truly show stopping or rave worthy.

My how time has changed things for the worse.  The expressionless hostess speaking in the whispered voice was probably a clue to turn around and head somewhere else.  The entire staff was the most disinterested group (or perhaps terribly hungover) of people I've seen working in a restaurant.  We arrived at around 11:15 so the place had just opened at 11.  Yet we sat at our table for over 10 minutes without any servers coming to take a drink order though they all kept walking by like zombies.  Finally, had to wave to get someone to come over and take an order.  Again despite the place only being open for 15 minutes, the food on the buffet ranged from cold to luke warm. Apparently it is either cooked way ahead of time or zapped in the microwaves just before opening and then they just wait on the buffet burners to get it to a proper temperature.  The offerings, especially for desserts and salad type options were much less than I remember from previous visits.

The only problem is, the menu is very meat heavy (except for their wednesday vegetarian night), and my boyfriend is a vegetarian. So, alas, I didn't have many opportunities to go there without making him feel left out - until this past labor day weekend... \\nMy boyfriend was out of town in Seattle and wasn't going to be back until Sunday afternoon. With that in mind, I jumped at the chance to have a \\"treat yo self day\\" and indulge in their phenomenal brunch. I made a reservation that week and eagerly awaited my 12pm Sunday seating time. When I arrived at the door, I milled around with the other patrons while my stomach was grumbling for the seating to start. When I gave the hostess my name, she frowned as she looked at her list and said I wasn't on it. So I stepped out of line and pulled up my reservation email and realized that I had messed up the date and had accidentally clicked on the next Sunday's brunch. I showed the hostess and she smiled and said it wasn't a problem and there were 3 extra seats open. I chose the outdoor table to have to myself while she went and immediately cancelled my next Sunday's reservation for me.\\nThe weather was wonderful and I soaked up the late summer sun while I sipped my Mimosa. My server was kind and accommodating, always making sure I had what I needed, and provided very detailed descriptions of every course. My second course, the Beast Hash, was my favorite, as I love eggs Benedict. It was served with super tender, melt in your mouth braised pork belly and loin, rattlesnake beans, and sweet corn. There were lunch box peppers and padron peppers saut√©ed in olive oil with a pinch of sea salt. The hash consisted of new potatoes (my favorite kind) and was topped with a poached duck egg and home made whole grain mustard hollandaise sauce. Mmmmm. \\nIt was at this point that I switched from my mimosa to a crisp lager while I waited for my third course, a cheese plate with summer greens. I then got a text from my boyfriend that he had just arrived home and so I told him to walk around the corner and join me (I could share the rest of the food with him as it was meatless for the last two courses). When he arrived, I had just received my cheese and we sampled it together. The waiter immediately came out and offered my new guest a beverage - he ordered fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Finally my fourth and final course arrived, flourless chocolate cake with sweet vanilla-rum creme chantilly on top. To my delight, a second portion was brought out for my boyfriend to enjoy and it was on the house! \\nAll in all, everything was five stars, the food, the service, the atmosphere, and I highly recommend this place to anyone who asks. I felt that I was treated like an honored guest, something that is lacking at a lot of other places I've been to with similar price points."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"1605 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Southern Thai ground pork was amazing.

Turns out I had no reason to be concerned, and instead I suspect their delicious variety of noodles was responsible for busting more than one poor dieter's no-carb restrictions.\\n\\nTheir decorating theme is roads and highways, as suggested by their name, and their menu is as difficult to navigate sometimes as the streets of Boston.  You start by picking a category (Noodle soup, fried rice, stir fried noodles, etc.), the type of sauce or soup base, the type of noodle, the type of protein, and any other optional additions.  Your choices are nearly infinite, and ordering is a bit like playing the board game Clue: Rice noodles, in the boat trip soup, with the candlestick.  I mean, pork.\\n\\nThere's nothing spectacular about their food, but I find it be better than decent.  Eating a big bowl of Udon Noodles in their savory Noodle Street signature soup with chicken drumsticks makes me forget all about the bitter New England winter outside.

Some of their dishes can be a bit bland, but their meats are tender and vegetables crispy in the stir fry--exactly how it should be made. The service is definitely a hit and miss, but so far it's been pretty good for me. I do like how they provide free dessert, which right now are fresh sweet orange wedges.

I feel sorry for the server who has to work that section, I'm sure they don't get many people at that table. \\n\\nWhile our server was very nice, I have to say the hostess more than once made a comment about how late we had arrived.

I had one of the ravioli dishes, which was quite good itself. \\n\\nOne of the reasons we chose this restaurant was the fact that they have not one, not two, but three vegetarian entrees -- quite the feat for a restaurant in Atlanta, based on how hard it was to find a place with even one vegetarian entree. \\n\\nOverall, it was exactly what we expected, and that is definitely a compliment. The only other complaint, besides the hostess' commentary, was the group of women sitting near us when we first sat down. \\n\\nWhy is it that whenever we go to a nice restaurant for what we expect to be a lovely, romantic dinner, we always end up near the shrieking, laughing, picture-taking drunk women on their birthday-bachelorette-reunion party?

First was the honey lavender and a mystery (I told her to choose something that was different but really good) it was the arbequina olive oil- omg that olive oil ice cream is insanely good! Sadly my husband doesn't like overly sweet and we were splitting so it was a no. The honey lavender was very lavender which is great but I personally couldn't eat a whole scoop. I also tried the roasted strawberry coconut. We decided on a cone (omg again completely insanely delicious!) with the bottom scoop salted caramel and the top scoop roasted strawberry coconut. The strawberry coconut was good and very fruity and refreshing- not heavy. The salted caramel was like something from my dreams! So sweet and salty all in one!

It was trivia night so I can't imagine how anyone could think one server was enough. The food was also really disappointing. We might as well have gone to taco Mac for nachos. There was no flavor to my chewy steak quesadilla, my friend's fajitas didn't come with any tortillas and my husbands tacos were more liquid than food.

I've felt the same way about many restaurants in the North End and in New York's Little Italy ( not to mention Paris...it's meta-bizarre to go to a \\"Frenchland!\\" restaurant in the actual country itself).\\n\\nThat said: sometimes we all enjoy a bit of fantasy in our dining. I've always wanted to be Cher in 'Moonstruck '( who wouldn't?). Maurizio's comes close to approximating the feeling that that movie gives me  of romance, heartiness, and no-frills magic.\\n\\n I enjoy that Maurizio's doesn't attempt to be \\"Italyland.\\"  It is a small space, neatly ( but not extravagantly/cheesily) decorated and bathed in an inviting red light. It is utterly romantic, but it doesn't  try to be ( which makes it all the better!) Singles, take note: It would be a wondrous, wondrous place to take a date. I would totally swoon for the person who thought of taking me here.\\n\\nMaurizio himself comes over to you table and jokes with you before  scampering off to prepare your dinner for you. The servers are not only pleasant and friendly to you and your guest, but to each other as well ( I heard them checking up on each other's days... it was rather sweet).\\n\\nBut enough with this; atmosphere and service is almost trivial when it comes down to the meat of the matter: the food.\\n\\nThis is probably the best Italian food I have had in my life. \\nI recommend:\\n\\n**Malloreddus alla campidanese: A Sardinian pasta dish served in a meat sauce with diced veggies, bits of lamb, and tomatoes. It's not a dish you typically see offered on many menus and it was an unexpected treat.\\n\\n**Penne nere al salmone : black penne pasta with salmon. I've never had black penne before and was likewise intrigued by it's novelty. The garlic cream sauce was light and flavorful without making you feel like you ingested a quart of heavy cream.\\n\\n**Ravioli d'aragosta: Lobster Ravioli. This shows up on many an Italian menu, but the sauce here really made it exceptional. \\n\\nAll this was paired, at the suggestion of our waitress, with Alexander Fitch Cabernet Sauvingon (sadly,  they might be out of this, as it is no longer listed on Maurizio's website's wine list). It was an inexpensive option, but went well with all our dishes and didn't have the bitterness that puts me off some cabernets.\\n\\nThe portions were large, but not bloat-inducing, and the prices are not gargantuan ($20 and under for an entree) but costly enough to warrant a \\"special night out\\".\\n\\nSo, if anyone else out there yearns for some Italian dining fantasy of a decidedly intimate and fabulous variety, put on your stiletto heels, grab the nearest Nicholas Cage lookalike and head to Maurizios (or \\"snap outta it!!\\")"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Have been looking forward to going here and did this morning.

After being seated at the table, we waited about 15 minutes for the waiter to come over and ask for our drink order. He finally took it, and the birthday girl arrived a few minutes later. After waiting about 15 minutes for drinks (in a restaurant that was mostly empty with only about 5 other tables in the place, which was fully staffed for a Saturday night) I approached our waiter and asked him when he would be bringing our drinks. He responded that he could \\"only bring them as they came up\\" and walked away. I observed him bringing drinks to a table seated about 10 minutes after ours.\\n\\nAfter finally bringing our drinks, he left us for another full 20 minutes before we flagged him down to place our order (still only a handful of other tables in the entire restaurant). He took our order and we proceeded to finish our drinks. About 30 minutes later, we asked the server filling our water if we could order more drinks. A few minutes later, the manager (or host possibly?) came to our tablet to tell us that our server had left in the middle of his shift. ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. That was not even busy. Now, I was a server for 8 years, so my response was obviously \\"Are you kidding me?!\\" We were baffled.\\n\\nAfter bringing us our drinks (notably, very quickly) he asked us if we had ordered dinner. Yes, we told him. About 40 minutes ago. Well, the server never put in the order. We ordered a second time.\\n\\nI would like to say that the manager who took over our service was fantastic. He brought us complimentary appetizers (pate and mussels, both very good) and comp'd our drinks on the check.\\n\\nThe food was good as well, when we finally got it. I had the rack of lamb with ratatouille. Others had the scallops, the salmon risotto, and the grilled salmon. Dessert: creme brulee for the birthday girl. Great portion and delicious. All the food was good.\\n\\nI really want to like this place because with servers like our second one, it has the potential to provide a great experience. If I was rating server number 2, I would give another star. He did everything he could to apologize for the horrible first server and to make up for his lacking service.\\n\\nMy advice, if you are going to try this place, go when you have plenty of time. Bring patience. The prices are not absurd, the food is decent, the atmosphere is very nice, and if they can get rid of servers who are not insanely terrible (I'm hoping ours is no longer employed) then it has potential."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The Italian beef sandwich is spicy and delicious!

We ordered the Skookum Chief burger, the mixed grill, the Yukon style bacon and eggs, grilled cheese sandwich and the lasagna.  No one had  any big complaints about the food but I wouldn't say it was the best I ever ate.  I did enjoy the hash browns but was disappointed with my fried eggs.  I felt they were a bit well done and could have been runnier.  Also, the grilled cheese sandwich wasn't anything to rave about.\\nThe reason why I gave it 2 stars was because they seemed to have all these rules about ordering.  If you want to share an entree (and some of you will because the portions are so large) you will be charged a $5.50 sharing fee.  We asked if we could order an entree and side dish ($3-5) but our server said it had to be an entree.

The server had difficulty getting to our table without knocking the table behind us.\\n-Paper napkins. Our silverware was wrapped in a paper napkin. Seriously? This did not match with the food presentation, service and price level. Cloth napkins would have been more appropriate.\\n-When our party was seated we were told that another party was coming directly after us and that we'd have to eat promptly and go downstairs to the lounge if we wanted to hang out after dinner.

At the end of our meal after we paid, we were told that the other party was there and that we should move to the lounge.

We didn't go there for live music and the space is too small for loud drums.

Get your mind out of the gutter.\\n\\nPork cheeks ($16) with mustard, fig, and sourdough toast is essentially an open faced sandwich.  It's a wonderful bite of food.  There is a roasted goat shoulder ($18) with gnocchi and tomato ragout that had great flavor.  The meat was a wee tough, but I'd still recommend it.  That's what she said.\\n\\nPopcorn and a movie ($8) - buttered popcorn gelato, root beer gel, homemade candy bar = awesomeness. You have to eat them all together for the perfect bite.  It's like a total flavor explosion in your mouth.  I'm talking about the desert.  Man, you are one sick bastard.\\n\\nRegarding the complaints of serving size, I thought it was the perfect amount.  It's probably the Cheesecake Factory effect, and people think you can get mounds of food for $16.  They also encourage sharing plates, so you're going to get bites of everything.\\n\\nService was awesome.  We got helpful recs from our waitress, and engaged in some conversation beyond \\"How is everything?\\"  And you can tell, they really enjoy the food and serving the food to the customers.\\n\\nHaters are going to hate hate hate.

The prices were really good - for me,  my husband and our 2 kids (ages 3 and 1), and we ate for around $20. \\n\\nThey were really accommodating for our kids - we brought our umbrella strollers upstairs and they didn't mind. The service was really fast which was nice because our kids can't sit too long. (It's a good place for kids, although the place is small and I don't think they had high chairs.) My son has nut allergies, and our server's English wasn't very good, so we asked some ladies sitting next to us to translate and let them know about our son's allergies. Everything was fine - he didn't have any problems.\\n\\nWe had the hot and sour soup, and it was really, really good. Great flavor - I just wish it had been spicier. We also had the Lotus Steamed Bun and the Custard Steamed bun. The custard one was better, but both were good. \\n\\nWe had 6 dishes total (I can't remember what else we ordered - some kind of meatballs and dumplings, and spare ribs, I believe), and it was enough to fill us up.

I've also been finding some fun restaurants exist on \\"the Eastside\\" these days.  So one Saturday, I thought we'd try another Eastside Mexican restaurant mentioned in the Chronicle, Los Comales.  Whoa, what a night!\\n\\nSo first we drove past the place.  (I think the light was rather dim on the sign to our credit).  Then, as we parked we were greated by a man in a reflective yellow vest.  In retrospect, I guess he was the parking lot attendant.  It wasn't really that complicated to park even for someone who is parking challenged nor was it a high demand parking area so I assume he was there more to discourage criminal activity.\\n\\nThen, we walk in and sit down, and our friendly server comes over to greet us.  The only problem was we discovered very quickly that she could hardly understand nor speak English!  It was a little difficult to communicate what it was we wanted but somehow we managed.  At least she was friendly.\\n\\nThe next amusing thing was that later on, this Asian girl with a backpack and an i.d. badge shoots through the door and heads for our table.  She plunges into her spiel, \\"I'm a missionary...\\" as she flashes her photo i.d. badge around her neck for the Unification Church.  We talked her for a little bit, and when she found out we weren't interested in her spiel, she just smiled, and says, \\"Would you like to donate?\\"  My husband said he already donates every Sunday.  She said, \\"God Bless You\\" and shot right back out the door after that.\\n\\nSo then after a little more time, a middle-aged Asian woman walks in the door with several bouquets of roses, some garnished with teddy bears.  She comes to our table asking if we would like one.  We decline, and she proceeds from table to table bewildering others in the room and then leaves.\\n\\nWhen we were checking out, I started admiring the pralines and other candies for sale.  I saw a pumpkin candy which I had never heard of, which I casually remarked out loud about it.  So before I knew it, the cashier grabs the pumpkin candy, and chops it open, and hands me a slice to grab part of.  I grab some but too much.  (I was curious but not terribly feeling like pumpkin candy).  I thank him, try some, but then I'm stuck with this chunk of sticky candy in my hand.  We walk outside and get in the car.  I'm trying to figure about what to do with the candy before I start driving, as the parking attendant starts to get a little worried about us hesitating.  I guess thinking I needed help pulling out (again not that difficult even for the parking challenged me), he helps direct me out of my parking spot and the lot.\\n\\nSo I don't have much recollection about the food which tells me it must have been so-so, but I have to admit that our visit to this restaurant will make me chuckle for years to come."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I've been here many times for dinner/drinks, and always love it.

I could guzzle that stuff by the pint.\\n\\nWe tried two pizzas -- the Margarita and the Bianca. The winner of the two was the Margarita, which had fresh cherry tomatoes, just enough cheese, and earthy basil draped across it. The Bianca was okay, it needed to be a little more garlic infused, and they decided to top it with fresh tarragon which really stuck out in an unpleasant way. Flavors in food should work together in concert to form a cohesive dish, and on the Bianca pizza, the tarragon flavor was clearly overwhelming and fighting for too much power.

The server was nice, but super slow. It seemed like there were always a ton of servers hanging out behind the server stand talking rather than waiting on people. The salads and bread were just ok, but they never affect my review of a restaurant. I got the Lobster Rav and my bf got the Frutti di Mare. He asked the waitress if the sauce was spicy and she said no, but they could make it spicy. When our food came, he found that the way they made it 'spicy' was just to add a bunch of pepper to the dish - not the spice he was looking for. The seafood itself was good and fresh. I don't know if it was just because of my bf's request or what, but my rav had a TON of pepper on it too. It was all I could see or taste on the plate. There were huge chunks of lobster, but I couldn't even get a good read on the sauce. When we left , I asked for more sauce on the side to take home to hopefully counteract the pepper. I have to say, the leftovers were much better and the sauce was good, but by then, the dish had to be microwaved so it already lost quality.

Combing through all the fete and bumping and grinding I spotted the opening of this new restaurant, GT Roti and Curry. This place promises to give the old stalwarts a run for their curry.\\n\\nWhat's in the name? \\"GT\\" represents Georgetown, the capital of Guyana. Roti is that flatbread like item and curry is a stew of Indian origin, in short. There are enormous cultural differences between types of rotis and curries that is way beyond my comprehension. I just like to eat them all. A second look at the name, could be \\"G\\" for Guyana and \\"T\\" for Trinidad. After all, the cultural make up of these two former British colonies is almost identical.\\n\\nWhat's going to set this restaurant apart from the cluster of West Indian establishments around the Pine Hills area? No alcohol. There is no beer, wine or liquor, which translates to no lingering drunken men as they say in the Caribbean \\"Liming\\" the girls as they try to get good food. Some establishments can be quite a scene. The next and most important difference, the owner is committed to delivering a very high level of service and food quality.\\n\\nHow did I know this? Well, I struck up a conversation. It is very hard to not have a conversation with someone who greets you upon entering the restaurant and is eager to answer questions. Very rarely have I gone into a Caribbean establishment and confronted with a warm welcome and conversation. Not to say that Caribbean people lack genuine hospitality, but it does take a little bit to get them to warm up.\\n\\nScrolling through their Facebook page it is evident that they are eager to include their clientele in menu building. There is a condensed menu available now. But the owner is actively seeking menu item suggestions through social interaction. How cool is that? Mine you, they offer full catering also.\\n\\nHere is what I sampled so far:\\n\\nBake and Eggplant - Bake is a pita pocket like item that opens to carry any array of items. Could this be the next taco? This particular version of eggplant has a slight roasted nose with a healthy dosage of tomatoes that almost covers the earthy eggplant. The dish leans on the acidic side.\\n\\nBake and Saltfish - Salted white fish is seasoned with various herbs and spices. Nice balance of acidity.\\n\\nNote: These bakes are about 4-6 inches in diameter. That does not give a lot of space for stuffings. Order accordingly.\\n\\nDoubles - This is the ubiquitous Trinidadian dish that even President Obama sampled. The Outer shell is a flour tortilla like item that wraps around chick peas simmered in spices. The heat level can be adjusted to your liking with sauces. Or you can get the sauces on the side and adjust as you eat. The resulting little fist size explosion of flavors is like a carnival in your mouth. These little darlings are very addictive.\\n\\nShrimp Curry Box - Medium sized shrimps are simmered in curry spices with green mango to give a sour acidity that lends a welcome flavor profile to this dish. All boxes are served with a roti, rice and curry channa (chick peas). This roti was soft, tender and very pliable, the perfect curry sopping vessel. Channa curry had the same sour profile as the shrimps. Shrimps were on the overdone side, this could be because it was \\"take out\\" and I took too long to eat it. I don't see the need for two starches, Roti and Rice, in this box. Maybe they are trying to appeal to all diners.\\n\\nMauby and Lemonade Drink - Mauby is from a bitter tree bark that when balanced can be a very delightful drink. It is said to have medicinal properties. Lemonade was tartly sweet.\\n\\nThis restaurant is located at the southwestern corner of Orange Blossom Trail and Sand Lake Rd intersection behind the Chase Bank. Which reminds me to caution you when turning behind the Chase Bank. That is the exit of the drive through, be careful.\\n\\nI welcome that this restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating. It would be very interesting to see this menu and restaurant  evolve. Breakfast times are not set in stone, Closing times are not set in stone. Menu items will appear and disappear. All of these things are getting tweeted as business demands. I am told that if there is a particular item you crave, call ahead....they'll have It available.

Definitely interesting, and we appreciated him coming over to tell us a bit more about other options he had that were cheaper. When our pitcher did come, he also brought us over a small shot glass of something spicy for us to add to the margarita, if we wanted it a bit spicier. Overall, he was really sweet and he made it a lot of fun.

Kudos to Amy D. for the heads-up - without her review, we would have had to discover this gem on our own, when we next trekked to 6th street.\\nWe were greeted at the the door by some very accommodating doormen & a lovely bunch of pretzels hanging on the wall. The likes of these pretzels are previously elusive locally. You can get some very good ones fairly often at Whole Foods, but don't get me started about how the supply of Laugenbrot has ebbed & flowed over the years in Austin. Nay, do not make me pontificate on the history if this noble, misunderstood treasure, bullied by the tag team of fast-food psuedo-pretzel abominations. Yes, even in central Texas, a supposed conservator of Teutonic culture, the poor, noble bread has been all but beaten.\\nPretzels at Easy Tiger come in two sizes. The small version is about the size of the fake pretzels found at carnivals, amusement parks, and the throng of pretzel franchises. The real bargain is the large size pretzel, as big as a large plate or platter. It is fun to watch the bakery crew through a window in the lobby as they constantly prepare the pretzels, boules, batards, baguettes, loaves, etc. These breads are fresh & authentic!\\nWe ordered our large pretzel along with a sampling of sausages, cheeses, and some German-style sides - potato salad & Sauerkraut - so it was all served on a standard food service tray. The Bratwurst & the middle-eastern style lamb sausage with cardamom were delicious. The lamb sausage came with a portion of curry ketchup, but the excellent house mustard costs extra. We also tried the Beer Cheese, an interesting soft cheese mixture for spreading on a pretzel or other worthy bread.\\nThe food was generally very good, but I was not impressed with the Sauerkraut & potato salad. The Kraut seems to be mere wilted cabbage seasoned with some salt - it is not the usual pickled or fermented version of this German staple. The potato salad is not the hot, German-style salad, with vinegar & minced onions, but is rather a cold version with mayonnaise & dill. The taste is good, but these are not my preferred versions of the German classics.\\nThere is a substantial beer & wine menu, but be warned that my waiter spilled the beans: they have a sommelier who plans the beer & wine selections. This fact brings about the oddest aspect of Easy Tiger: they feature wonderful wine selections, but very few - if any - German beers on tap. There are a few bottled beers from Deutschland, but they're far outnumbered by other beers. While it's true that there are many fine beers around the world, I suggest that some customers will visit Easy Tiger expecting to have German beer with their pretzel or sausage, but they'll be disappointed. This, of course, is a minor point that can be remedied as time goes on.\\nMy theory is that Easy Tiger is intended to be a fusion of different elements, based upon the classic German beer garden. Even the name gives no clue to its German influence - one must actually visit & sample their offerings to know. As far as I'm concerned, they have succeeded in addressing the under-served pretzel market in Austin - though the concept may include elements that serve other markets as well.\\nThe place certainly has a nice, fun atmosphere - located on the creekside riverwalk that crosses 6th Street, where patrons can play Ping Pong or sit beer-garden style at rustic picnic tables. I hope my fellow Austinites will appreciate & patronize Easy Tiger, keeping it in business for years to come!"},{"name":"Commodore Lounge","address":"1650 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"In the days my husband worked at ART (across the street from the Commode--that's what we nicknamed it), we would frequent this place at lunch. \\n\\nI miss it dearly.\\n\\nIf you are expecting top-of-the-line service, fast turnaround for your order, and a completely coherent waitstaff, avoid the Commode.

It's a cool set up, with a projector screen that shows movies/sport games (I watched the Superbowl there, it was awesome!), a stage that hosts live music, and fire pits for during the cooler winter months. It's a BYOB food truck lot, with a store within walking distance that sells alcohol should that strike your fancy.

My niece, a FORMER regular, my sister who had eaten there earlier that week, said it would be a good place to go with our whole family. We ordered appetizers, shared bread, all got the spinach and the potatoes, however, I was the only one who got the baked scallops. The scallops were a little fishy, but the waitress said they were fresh so I thought maybe in New England that is how they tasted.  I only ate 3. around 1:30 I started vomiting violently.  I am a Registered Nurse and knew immediately I had food poisoning.  I came very close to going to the hospital, but being a nurse I knew what to watch for. If this had happened to a child or senior adult it would have been a dangerous situation. I called management and was told there is no way their seafood could have made me sick. They were sympathetic that I had been sick but repeatedly said that it wasn't from the scallops. She took my information down assuring me her manager would call me, and they never did. Serving seafood is a challenge for any restaurant, but to not even offer to investigate or take any responsibly is neglectful to all their customers that walk in the door.  We weren't asking for anything, just acknowledgement and the expectation they would try and prevent this from happening to any other person.  Out of 8 people, I was the only one sick.

At the time I was just along for the ride as I was still delirious from a Chinese food overload at lunch time. Fitting more food in my belly wasn't a priority, however upon reaching the restaurant and looking at a menu I decided I couldn't pass up a good Mac 'n Cheese with a salad, a little more comfort food and some ruffage to make me feel better about life.\\n\\nThe Mac was fabu but almost too cheesy for me at the time. The little side salad was perfecto! Their menu included Apps, Entres, and also a snack section (home of the Mac) with perfect portions for a little appetite.\\n\\nI went into the evening thinking I wouldn't be up for much drinking. Alas (or i should say, thankfully) the cocktail menu proved me wrong. As a MAJOR fan of a good Dark and Stormy I was instantly intrigued by their \\"Mark and Stormy,\\" consisting of chili-infused Maker's Mark and home brewed ginger beer. I'm in love....with a cocktail...I know he'll never break my heart. It was perfectly spicy and sweet. I want more....and i want it now.\\n\\nOnce we thought we were finished stuffing our faces with deviled eggs and Mac and wine (great wine selection btw) we were once again drawn in by the cocktail list and went for one more. The waitstaff was great and really helpful with picking a wine and suggesting the best eats.\\n\\nOverall the experience was great.

We were talking about the glorious places to eat that makes Winter Park...well....Winter Park and checked Yelp. Cask and Larder popped up, so I said \\"Well, everyone and their mother (literally) has been there, so maybe I should give it a shot.\\" \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were offered complimentary valet parking, which was AWESOME. When we walked inside, I was MESMERIZED (Like the first time I went to Harry Potter world) by the ambiance that is Cask & Larder. The lighting was low and the scent was very midwestern; the perfect scent of spices and fanciness (Yes, fanciness has a scent). The hosts stared at us until we said \\"Two Please.\\" There was no \\"Hi, how are you?\\" or \\"When's the last time you were in?\\" or even \\"Do you have a reservation?\\" \\n\\nMoving forward, we sat down in a very cosy spot (Next to the Window; actually, I sat in the window). We were greeted by our Server, who was very interesting. She asked if we had been there and we said no. She proceeded to tell us that everything is made in-house, etc but didn't talk about best sellers, awards, or how the restaurant was started. I asked her for recommendations and she just pointed to a few things but didn't' tell us WHY we should order them. \\n\\nAfter contacting everyone in my phone that has been to Cask & Larder, they recommended the Fried Fish platter. We ordered that, which came out VERY well, so I'm not unhappy with the food by any means. I'm just really saddened by the level of customer interaction and interpersonal branding. In short - I felt like a number, but hopefully none of you will have this happen.\\n\\nWhen it was time for dessert, I asked for a menu and told the server what I prefer but that I'm not too picky.

The naan here is always served warm and is fluffy and perfectly crispy. The biryani and plain rice is delicious as well and the portions of everything are huge. Lastly, the chicken tikka leg and breast are phenomenal and a must have.

Sandwiches are expensive ($13 for a corned beef sandwich) and without a side (a deviled egg and some pickles don't count).  Corned beef itself was fairly tasty but dry.  The slaw was bland. The bread was dry and bland except the crusts.  The Deviled egg was dry, bland, and had shell bits and membrane still on it.  The pickles were good, I'd eat more of those.  Also got a jelly donut type thing ($3) that was pretty good (the jelly was fantastic) but the greasy powdered sugar crust I could have done without.  The service was friendly and fairly quick."},{"name":"Takara Japanese Restaurant","address":"151 Linden St","city":"Wellesley","stars":"3","text":"Creative Sushi without Driving into the City (3.5 stars)\\n\\nTakara is located just off the center of town in Wellesley.  It offers Japanese-Korean fusion cuisine.  The menu is large with an incredible number of sushi, noodle, and Korean options.  The staff are helpful and courteous.  The ambiance is simple and typical of many restaurants in it's league.\\n\\nWe started with the steamed shrimp shumai which were good but standard.  We also got a house salad which was fine.  Again, very standard fare.\\n\\nThe sushi (which will be the focus of the rest of this review since that's what we ate) extends far beyond the typical spicy tuna roll or California roll.  The snow mountain roll was topped with sweet flaky crab salad and was delicious.  The Hawaii roll was excellent too.  The Wayland roll was very creative with pressed sushi rice, white tuna, and a sweet sauce.  It tended to fall apart and was hard to eat.  Still worth it though.  The Wellesley roll was our least favorite but still not bad.\\n\\nWe finished with the fried green tea ice cream.  It was a bit too frozen but otherwise good.\\n\\nOverall, it's nice to know we have this option so close to home."},{"name":"Accanto","address":"2838 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I tried Accanto for the first time last week.  Since I work in Italian food and wine, it is not something that I go out for regularly at all.  We arrived around 7 on a Thursday night and were greeted and seated immediately.  The dining room had a pleasant, warming feel and the decor was tastefully done.  I became a bit turned off when we were seated at a table directly (and I mean DIRECTLY) next to another diner whose table had about a six inch gap between our table.  That doesn't normally bother me, but in this case there were many other table options with more space where we could have been seated.  It wasn't really a bother until another table was seated a few moments later on our other side and it quickly became apparent that their conversation's proximity was going to be a bother throughout the course of our meal.\\n\\nThis being said, I was there for the experience of the cuisine and wine predominantly.  I started with a nice glass of dry, crisp prosecco while we decided on our meal.  I was drawn to their 3 course prix-fixe which includes an antipasto, pasta and gelato.  We decided to order some salumi and cheese while we decided on the rest of our meal.  The meats were mild yet flavorful, paired nicely with a strong gorgonzola and a nutty, firm cheese I believe was Bra Duro.  We made our choices for the rest of the meal and the waiter was kind enough to let me try a taste of the Montepulciano they were pouring by the glass before deciding to order it.\\n\\nI chose to start with fried sardines served over a shaved celery and almond salad.  This was, BY FAR, the highlight of the night.  The filets were nicely sized, full flavored, crisp and flakey on the outside, moist on the inside.  The best sardines I have ever had.  I had, at this point, moved on to a very smooth glass of Nebbiolo that had great minerality with nuances of spicy fruit.  A fine pair for the sardines.  \\n\\nNext, I decided to have the Orecchiette with kale, sausage, garlic, anchovy and Reggiano.  The handmade pasta was delightful, nearly perfectly al dente (which is difficult with Orecchiette) and the dish balanced the flavors quite well with a plethora of varying sensations on the palate.  I've had mediocre Orecchiette and this one was a treat.  With this course I decided to have that Montepulciano I had tasted earlier, rich and velvety with powerful earthy fruit.\\n\\nLastly, I asked the waiter if I could upgrade my vanilla gelato to an affogato, and he obliged for the price of a shot of espresso.  The house-made gelato was excellent, traditionally paired with a crisp biscotti.\\n\\nAll in all, I was pleased with my experience.  The only complaints I have are being seated directly next to others when there are tables with more spacing available and that they could have given a few extra crostini with my friend's pate, as the ones served with the dish didn't even get her halfway through the portion.  Also, the waiter was very nice and attentive but seemed nervous with his confidence in his knowledge of the menu.  The dishes were traditional with a nice flare of the local and the wine was exquisite.  I will go back again, possibly bringing a friend from Puglia, as I think they were that close in their authenticity.

Super hard workers. Good bus boy.  I asked what I should order on the menu and took cashier's advice and ordered everything she suggested.  Food arrived within about 5 minutes. Chicken Sandwich (2):  chicken was dry, heavily battered that fell off with the first bite.  Medium spice wasn't that spicy.  Bun was just a bun (on the dry side).  Very messy and hard to eat.  I wish they had proper napkins instead of thin ones that didn't sop up the mess.  Cornbread: Super dry. Not good.  Crumbled  all over the place. I ended up throwing it away.  1/4 white chicken:  This was better. Moist with the bone. Breading was a bit thick and crumbed off the chicken as soon as you bit it. This was the only thing somewhat worth while. Came with yummy pickles an a piece of dry white wonderbread.  Macaroni Salad: Meh. Fries: it came with their DL house sauce which was basically spiced up flavoured mayo.  The fries were smothered (way to much) in the sauce that made them all soggy.

My dad worked at Pierre's bakery when we I was a kid, and we grew up on this bread - the sourdough, the marble rye, the seashell rolls, the onion buns, the perfect anise biscotti - we teethed on the grissini and loved to gaze at the baked goods in their little retail window, where Sherry who manned the counter would slip a cookie over to us while we waited for my dad to get off work.  I've long dreamed of that sourdough - never finding any that quite lived up to the standard.  THEN - we discovered Alessio's! We picked up some of their bread a few months ago as a surprise for my dad, and at the first bite we were all transported.  The flavor is unbeatable - as is the nostalgia.  But this isn't just about nostalgia - this is about delicious bread made to the highest of standards - this is artisan in its original form - when it wasn't about pretension (not that is all about pretension), but when artisan was a \\"given\\" because it's about deep-rooted pride in your craft - in this case, in baking.  Alessio is old-school Portland.  Old-school Italian Portland - like visiting my Nonna in the kitchen at the Monte Carlo.

They basically tweeted that I should not come to their coffee shop; \\"if all I want is wireless\\". They completely missed the point of what I was trying to say. Even though I have no need for wireless myself I tried to relay that shutting out loyal customers who might rely on such service is simply very poor customer service. This tells the customers to stay away and only come to the store in the off-hours. Secondly, when talking to staff we were told that they shut the wireless off because of lack of bandwidth. How about upgrading then? Sad to see that a business with a good product and design has such a poor attitude towards customer service. Instead of being receptive for feedback and embracing it, telling customers to not come back is just sad, very sad. \\nI will however take their advice.

The meat and cheese board is just processed meats and pimento cheese which they have the cojones to charge $13 bucks for. They get away with this by calling the menu \\"Low Country Style\\".. So because everything is pretty simple and unsophisticated you're supposed to say: 'Whelp! What can you expect, it's Low Country style!' and then feel super hip.\\nBut really it's just cheap food at a high price. Another example: crinkle fries are $8 bucks. Yes, like the kind you had in elementary school.\\nThey try to play all of this off by serving this food with unevenly cut pieces of paper with quotes printed on them so you really feel like you are getting into the \\"Low Country\\" theme.

My favorite iced coffees are snickerdoodle, pistachio ice cream and gingerbread cookie! \\n\\nThey also have breakfast sandwiches, bagels and other pastries. \\n\\nThey take credit cards if your order is over $7.00. If you are a frequent customer and don't ever carry cash, consider charging at least $7 on their gift card with your credit card which you can just re-charge when you run out.

AND that you'll have to wait an hour for it. When I did my foodie research before coming to Portland, Salt and Straw naturally popped up right away. We left our visit there to towards the end since every time we passed by, the lines seemed interminable. We finally showed up around 9p one night. hoping the lines would've diminished some. Whether they did or didn't is irrelevant, cause we still had to wait 30-40 min, but it wasn't as bad as we thought for a summer night. And more importantly, it wasn't so chaotic that it woke up the sleeping baby we had in tow.\\n\\nWhen we finally got inside the doors, I quite liked the decor and how they featured the various snacks, etc. that were used as the ingredients for their flavors. The reason the lines can take so long is that the staff is very accommodating with the samples, and so you spend a lot of time figuring out all the interesting flavor combos. I thought for sure I was going to leave with the almond brittle ganache one, but it didn't wow me as I expected. In fact, I finally settled on the seasonal, CSA-grown (of course) green fennel flavor that I never dreamed in a million years I'd like as an ice cream. Fan-freaking-tabulous, though. It was lighter than the flavors with chocolate or peanut butter things, but was still full of character. And I preferred it over the other light choice our group ordered, the lavender and honey one, which was just too delicate for what I was craving at the time perhaps.\\n\\nI was certainly in dessert heaven as we sat on the bench outside to polish off our choices. It was a great spot to witness another only in Portland moment when Lorne Michaels, Fred Armisen, and other less recognize-able SNL/Portlandia faces walked in for their ice cream fix, and all the hipsters in line and behind the counter went tongue-tied seeing their comedy idols in person.\\n\\nAll in all a memorable stop on the P-town checklist, and one that now has me singing the praises of green fennel."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This is an absolute find.

A modern interior design with a well-dressed and attentive waiting staff made it a nice ambience for a mid-level restaurant.  \\n\\nI would say that the prices definitely were not cheap.  My Horchata was 2$ and my Grinca  (Quesadilla stuffed with spicy Pastor) was 9$ and it goes up from there to top off at around 20$.  \\n\\nThe food I would say was the most disappointing part of the experience.  The tortilla was decent, but the meat was not cooked long enough and was needed to be cut into smaller pieces for the Grinca.  It was weird to have such large (somewhat) chewy chunks of meat in the Grinca, and it was not even that spicy.  The other thing that was funny to me was that they had put pineapples in the Grinca, but I did not notice it until I was almost done with the meal and I saw a piece of Pineapple.  I did not taste anything pineapple the whole time, which was disappointing cause it would have given it a nice kick in flavor.  The garnish was also old and dry, as if it was left out all day (or possibly all night).  My wedge of lime was so dry that I could not squeeze any juice out of it onto the Grinca.  I had to ask for a new slice.  \\n\\nThe chips they served at the beginning of the meal was pleasant actually.   Thin and crispy with spicy seasoning.  The dipping for the chips was interesting.  It was not salsa or guacamole, but a blended tomato paste that was a little mild in flavor.  I wouldn't say it was good, or bad..... just interesting.\\n\\nI will becoming back here for the Menudo, just to see what it was like because a lot of people at the restaurant had it and seemed to enjoy it.  Hopefully they put in more care into the Menudo than they did my Grinca because the tripe definitely needs to be soft and tender."},{"name":"Maki Maki","address":"40 Cummings Park","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"Very pleasant experience.

Call me curious, but I should have known better.\\n\\nThe burrito was average.  Everything was tender and had flavor, albeit probably needing some more of both.  The Mole itself was a little too chocolaty, more sweet than savory.  I couldn't taste the chiles and spices at all.

While both were slightly more expensive than you would find elsewhere they were both very good, although the shrimp could have been a little colder. Our server was very nice and attentive. The warm, fresh French bread was delicious. As someone who tries to skip on the bread when possible, this one was well worth it. \\n\\nFor entrees I ordered the grilled Arctic Char and my boyfriend ordered the pan seared scallops. The Arctic Char was very good. It was served in a golden raisin butter sauce, which I was a little nervous about overpowering the fish (I don't tend to like thick sauces) but there wasn't too much of it and the raisins complemented it well. The trumpet mushrooms in the dish were cooked perfectly and had a nice meaty texture. The pan seared scallops were seared very nicely and were served with lemon risotto. While it should be fairly obvious from the name, the risotto was very lemon-y. If you really like lemon, I would suggest this, but if not, you may want to make a different selection.\\n\\nWe went on a Friday night at 7pm for dinner.

I ordered the sigara borek (filo cheese dough something something) and the Pizara (lamb chops). Please forgive me since I might be butchering the spelling of these dishes, but my pics speak a thousand words , so hopefully it shouldn't allude confusion. \\nAnyways, let's talk food:\\n-Not so much a fan of their filo rolls. It was very bland imo. It felt like bad mozzarella sticks. \\n-The lamb chops really make up for the bad filo rolls. Very tender and juicy. The rice was also amazing too! The lamb chop portions are small but that's the case with most Turkish places I've been to. I'd pair it with an appetizer (not filo rolls) to make it a full meal. \\nThe ambience is very nice and calm (bathroom is pretty and clean so that's a plus for me) It's a small restaurant in the Somerville area and I noticed it attracts a lot of students. My sis mentioned that it gets packed during most weekdays, but I guess we got lucky. \\nQuality wise, I say this place is overall pretty good (still prefer NY Turkish food). Price wise, it was comparative to the Turkish restaurants in New York. My sis's good buddy paid the bill for us, which was so sweet! But if you don't have an amazing buddy, do carry lots of dough (not filo dough though.

Good selection, plenty to pick from, but where this place scores is the beer menu. I genuinely expected to see Bud, Coors, and Miller. Wrong. The beer list is two pages full, with a second two page special/seasonal list. Seriously? Wow. Tons of beer, more than any other little one stop place I've been to anywhere around Atlanta, and with very competitive prices to match. Not just match, beat. This is now high on my list.

That signature low quality, high sodium soy sauce flavor was evident from the get go.  One of my dining companions made the same observation.  I looked up Pei Wei later only to discover its relationship to the parent company and confirm my thoughts.  The Hot and Sour soup was neither hot nor sour.  I had to add white vinegar and chili sauce myself for any flavor.  It's a good thing I only ordered a cup.\\n\\nI sampled a companion's Mongolian Beef and another companion's Teriyaki Chicken.

We had sides of Yucca Freitas, coleslaw and black beans & rice. They have quite a variety of sauces and Stacey and I are both saucey people so we sampled them all. Everything was truly amazing! If I had to say something negative, their slaw was a little Bland for my taste. They have quite a selection of beer to go with the awesome food and while some would consider their food to be a bit expensive to us it was well worth every penny.

What makes this grilled cheese so special is that they use Gruyere cheese and sourdough bread. They used to have black forrest ham grilled cheese sandwich but they no longer have that on the menu. The staff tells me it was a favorite by everyone so I am not sure why they took it off the menu. But make sure you try the kalamata olive aioli with the shoe string fries.

I wanted the nashville chicken and just a side of veggies. But they cook most their food ahead of time so I could not get a side of veggies. Also, after multiple times the waitress came up to me to tell me I couldn't eat something, they served my plate with cornbread underneath the chicken. The cornbread has dairy...and probably flour mixed in. The waitress told me the dairy burns off in the oven. For someone with a severe food allergy - it's still poison to my body, I've never heard someone say milk/butter burns off in the oven. I didn't want them to cook another chicken and have everyone finish eating before me. I took the bread off and still ate my meal but today, I'm feeling sick. \\n\\nThis just gives me another failed food attempt in Orlando.

So really it's not out of the way from millions of other downtown haunts.  Though at night La Casita and The Met are the only places open.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Tacky.  But you know in the way you've come to expect from an authentic Mexican place that's not in Mexico.  This is two-thumbs up decor.  Sombreros on the the tacky coral-colored walls.  A stained glass Virgin Mary is hanging in the window.  The music is authentic, and something I haven't been hearing in any of the other so-called Mexican places I've stopped in Vancouver.  We got some mariachi & regeaton, classics like Guantanamera.  We even had a Hispanic waiter!  Some of the tables were a little too close.  \\n\\nFood: Chips and salsa to start, and they were free (as they should be!).  The salsa was ok.... tasted like hot sauce more than like salsa.  The chip bowl was a decent size.  The enchiladas were good, and you very reasonably priced.  The burrito was ginormous.  Lots of leftovers.  The menu says they have lime and strawberry margaritas, but the table near us got a huge pitcher of what appeared to be mango margaritas.  That's worth investigating, it looked good!  But in general, the food here is exciting- it tastes Mexican!  Ultimately, it's worth coming back for, despite our other complaints.\\n\\nService: The waiter sat us right in front of the door, when there were other 2-person tables available.  This became a problem, as it got very cold with the door opening.  Unfortunately, we didn't realize it was a problem until the other tables were full.  I got no water refill throughout the night, which was frustrating.  Coke refills come at a cost.\\n\\nNow here's my big complaint.  At the end of the meal, my husband got a refill on his coke.  First, we didn't realize there was a charge.  Then when we got the bill, we didn't realize that each coke was $3.  Everything we got was so reasonably priced, that this really stood out as a horrible scam.  But the problem is that the 2nd coke had crap floating in it. Yuck.  If you swirl it around slightly in the cup, you see 'stuff' collect on the sides of the glass.  Super gross!  So the second coke, costing us $3, sat untouched when we left the restaurant.  Everything else makes up for this one problem- but I will say, don't drink anything before fully inspecting the glass!"},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Concluding our evening in Salem we decided on Turner's.

If restaurants don't pan out for Billy, he can build a bbq sauce empire. I mean, seriously, this sauce melds the bbq triumvirate: smoky, sweet, and spicy.

An outdoor patio offers additional seating for 20-30 people at wooden picnic tables next to a bubbling fountain enclosed by a tall fence. I imagine the lunch or happy hour crowds will drown out the small sound system that pipes music into the patio once Billy's is discovered.\\n\\nThe bar is a work of art and may be worth the visit just to see this piece restored from Portland's historic Hoyt Hotel. Polished dark brownish-red wood with curving ornamentation surround three broad mirrors. Beneath it rests all the drinks, draughts, and spirits of a full bar including a good selection of microbrews on draft such as Ninkasi, Widmer, and Deschutes. A blackboard just to the left of the bar advertises Happy Hour from 4-6:30 where we were told several popular dishes are offered at discount.\\n\\nBilly himself gave us a tour and described the salvaging and reconstruction of the bar and his plans to add a roof to the patio to extend its use into the wetter seasons."},{"name":"Subway","address":"386 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"2","text":"Gave them a 1 star due to the fact that the cashier felt it was appropriate to lick his dry fingers before picking up the napkin he put in my bag.

This is a great way to order and avoid the long lines!\\n\\nFor my entree I did the create your own Satu'li Bowl with chopped wood-grilled chicken, mixed whole grains & rice for the base, with the charred onion chimichurri. The chicken was delicious - very meaty, had a great grilled flavor, and it was very flavorful. The chimichurri tasted delicious! The slaw didn't have much of a flavor at all, but I did leave a nice crunch. \\n\\nI also ordered the chocolate cake because I have a sweet tooth. I honestly didn't like it that much because it's fairly bitter, but if you're a dark chocolate fan you will love it! I feel it's a tad misleading though - the bottom isn't a crunchy cookie layer, as they describe it on the menu, but more like a traditional cake. The chocolate dome is a chocolate mousse, and the top is the banana cream which I can barely taste. Regardless - this a great option for non-traditional theme park food!"},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered food on postmates. 2 items.

The decor is elegant industrial, but has some quirky pieces that I absolutely loved. I wanted to take home one of their regal bird portraits for my own home, no joke. \\n\\nWe came in with a fairly large party and started with drinks at the seated bar area as we waited for the rest of our dining companions to show up. Because Swift's Attic is known for their Ice Ball Cocktails (where a ball of the drink's mixer is frozen and put in a glass, then the alcohol components poured around it), I decided to try the Apple Mint Julep. And whoa nelly. It was a long trip on the struggle bus for the remainder of the night as I waited for the ice ball to melt to the point where I could drink it without wincing. I took our waiters advice to \\"take your fork and scratch at the ice ball like a wildcat\\" to speed the process up, but then I just ended up with a lukewarm drink half way through our meal. Sad panda. So I loved the concept, but because I'm such a pansy with a low alcohol tolerance, I was unable to enjoy this cocktail.\\n\\nBut the food! Small plates are tricky to figure out when there are a lot of people to feed, so we ended up ordering way more than we actually needed. But oh how blissful it was. I'll break down my thoughts on each of the most memorable dishes:\\n\\nBlistered Shishitos--Super tasty and not nearly as hot as I thought they were going to be. The tasty dipping sauce took away the majority of the bite, but it was still delicious.\\n\\nCharred Edamame--Huge fan! Not only do I want to start preparing my own edamame that way with the lovely charred flavor, but the pop rocks were a treat! Just remember to eat them slowly so the rocks have a chance to pop in your mouth to get the full experience. \\n\\nNouc Cham Brussels Sprouts--Crisp, delicious, and perfectly cooked. I loved the addition of the golden raisins and toasted almonds.\\n\\nGrilled Butternut Squash--I'm normally not a huge fan of squash, but now I know why: because I've never eaten it with granola before! It's such a strange pairing but it works so gloriously well. The sage chips were also something I've never seen before but were a nice addition.\\n\\nRoasted Beets--Good, but a bit lackluster compared to the other veggie dishes we tried.\\n\\nWarm Tender Belly Farms Pork Cheeks--The pork was flavorful and tender and was great when plopped on a triangle of toast. I don't enjoy spicy mustard so that sort of ruined the flavors for me, but it's an interesting combo if you're a fan.\\n\\nBraised Windy Hill Goat Shoulder--Goat tends to taste a little dry and stringy to me, but this preparation was succulent and delicious. The gnocchi was wonderful as well. \\n\\nKorean BBQ Flank Steak--Surprisingly, my least favorite meat dish. But I was completely stuffed at this point and the dish had gone cold so that might have something to do with it. Everyone else at the table gave rave reviews on this, however, so it must have been good.\\n\\nThe Pig Ear Dish (which I can't find on the menu to look up the real name)--My first time trying pig ear and it was...interesting. I didn't really understand eating it in something so light as a lettuce wrap when the meat is so heavy and chewy. \\n\\nAnd that's how you eat the entire animal kingdom. ;)\\n\\nAll jokes aside, I really enjoyed my dining experience here and cannot recommend it enough."},{"name":"Manny's Original Chophouse","address":"4979 New Broad St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely incredible dining experience with a great friend tonight.

That dish was so dishonest. It was large chunks of potato, sprinkled with parmesan, and topped with a fried egg and kale. The \\"bacon\\" was pale brown cubes of mostly fat pork. It wasn't caramelized or fried or anything that would make it even remotely take on the appearance of bacon or lardons. It tasted like unseasoned pork chop. I ordered scrambled eggs with parm which is actually a specific menu item and as I was eating them I kept thinking \\"where is the parmesan\\"? Well there was none. I confirmed on the check that the order just said \\"two eggs\\". So my husband was unhappy with his $15 bacon hash that was neither a hash nor contained what we even generously consider bacon and my order was just wrong.

The other 3 orders also had some but it was not on every single piece, as was mine, so that was very upsetting.  We had to wait about 20 minutes to get the food, so I was not open to having it redone so I ate around the bad parts.  The person next to me ordered a dish with prawns and when it came, there were no prawns to be found at all so another bad mark against them.  Again, timing was an issue so we didn't say anything.  Next, the same person ordered a sundae and that was a complete joke because it was 4 of the smallest scoops of ice cream ( I swear they used a melon baller for the scoops) I have ever seen served over the top of white rice with chocolate syrup drizzled over the top.

I tell the lady that the chicken was plain, she stares at me for five seconds and then says 'ok we can fix that' like I'm causing some major inconvenience.

It's bagged to go and I'm on my way.  I went to the end of the food cart area to the nearby stools to eat.  The seating was pretty crowded and I got one of the last stools.  I opened the bag, opened the container, took out my utencils to discover a plastic fork, no knife.  And as far as plastic forks go, this was on the lower quality end - very flimsy.  How am I supposed to cut into this thick chewy tortilla, meat cheese and rice with no knife and a flimsy fork?  I can't go back and ask for one because that would require standing in the line again and likely losing my seat, so I go at the burrito with the flimsy fork, open face style.  Just digging at it and getting what I can get.  About three bites in, on of the pronges on the fork breaks in the food.  I can't find the broken pronge in the pile of rice and tortilla and I can't continue eating with a broken fork, so , I took all the food from the area where the fork broke, dump it in the trash and walk back the 15 or so minutes to my office where we have forks and knives and finish my now cold lunch there.  \\n\\nThe food is good - but the forks are not adequate for heavy mexican food and a knife is a must!!

They make their own mix in house and use all natural ingredients. I got a house marg on the rocks next and really liked it. I'd totally come back and get a pitcher with some girlfriends- super smooth and really well made. Although, it could get you into trouble if you're not careful (so call Uber or Lyft if that happens). Boyfriend opted for Dos XX lager because it was the special that evening; $6 for a 16oz glass or something like that.\\n\\nWe had to get the guac because it's also made fresh in house, and if you're in the dining room you can see them make it in the back. Not quite table side, but really good nonetheless. We got some fresh limes from the bar to squeeze over it that took it to the next level. They also served us complimentary chips and salsa, but the salsa wasn't my favorite. I think it was also house made but it didn't have much flavor; very mild and borderline bland.\\n\\nBecause we knew we'd fill up on guac and chips, boyfriend and I opted to split an entree. We got the Pollo con Crema de Langosta, a grilled chicken breast on whipped potatoes with a lobster cream sauce and pan-sauteed zucchini and squash on the side.

Back in Brooklyn, a $18-$20 salmon entree is ubiquitous and better cooked. If you're going to have a menu full of stand-bys, then you should get them right. Salads and desserts were ice cold from the walk-in fridge (chocolate pecan pie?...like that couldn't sit out for days and still be fresh). My $9 hummus plate looked good, but the dips were stingy and ran-out long before the pita crisps that should have been warm pita bread.\\n   All and all, an OK meal for prices that put it in competition with Alta Strada (down the road in Wellesley Ctr) and The Biltmore (Needham, 10 minutes away), two places that do a superior job on the food. I'm hoping for improvement, but I doubt the clientele knows the difference....so, Part II...forget what I said, these guys can't be trusted to make a sandwich. The skirt steak sandwich had small pieces of meat swallowed up by an enormous roll that was little better than Wonderbread (being touted as garlic bread). The fries were lame, pre-cut, undercooked pieces of #@!$ that wouldn't cut it any self-respecting bar, let alone a 'restaurant' with pretensions to competence.

Loved, loved, loved the goat stew (the plantains in it are to die for) and the gnocchi with short-rib ragu.  My side of broccoli rabe was great because I can never get it where I live, but I didn't go for the smoky flavor.  The empanada, one of the specials, was fun but didn't stand up to the other dishes (and made altogether made too much food for me and the BF to share, with the stew especially being so generous).  I had the chance to try two of the beers on tap (Hennepin and Brooklyn) that night as well.  We walked out stuffed and enthralled.\\n\\nTuesday night we came back for the spelling bee.  I was expecting a bit more quiet and attention paid to the spellers, but people were still eating as it was going on.  Their talking made it hard to follow the action.  I take these things seriously, having done the full bee circuit up through state for several years as a kid!  You can't have it all, though- between my turns I found myself chatting with my friends.  \\nThe star of the show that night (apart from me, who won the spelling bee) was the cocktails.  I've fallen in love with the Monsoon (rum, mango juice and ginger beer), as has everyone in the group I went with.  If I liked the taste of gin more, the Highland Fling (gin, elderflower liqueur and lime juice) would have been perfect.  The BF loved the Siena.  For winning the bee, I got a $25 gift certificate which I promptly spent on another round of those beautiful drinks.\\n\\nOne qualm: it was too chilly in there.  I'm not used to A/C any more, living in a place that doesn't use it much, but I didn't like having to wear my sweater at the table.  It was also pretty dark- I think that's the atmosphere they want, but a little more light wouldn't kill the place.  It's hard to see from one end of the restaurant to the other!\\n\\nOverall, the food's gorgeous, the drinks are fantastic, they have permanent and rotating microbrews...

It is a family place and it is noisy, but I like the personal quality of it.  You used to be able to watch the chefs making your eggs, and I still get that comforting feeling of knowing somebody actually took my omelet off the stove and onto my place about 30 seconds before it was given to me.

Also whenever I've gone to a 24 hour restaurant, my appetite and palate is usually not the most discerning given the time and circumstances. \\n\\nBut most recently I reluctantly went to good ol' No. 9 during regular evening hours and was more than pleasantly surprised. For a larger family dinner of about 12 people, we ordered a fair amount of food and dish after dish I could not find anything wrong with it as I didn't have high expectations. Even the more delicate fried rice which most restaurants don't hit on the nail - Dried Scallop with Egg Fried Rice. It's one of my favourites when it's done right - and it was done right.\\n\\nThen on another evening we needed some take out and I thought to give them a try again. Out of 4 dishes, maybe just the rice noodle was slightly overcooked, but it doesn't warrant a complaint because unless you're at one of the \\"fancier\\" Chinese restaurants eg. Kirin, Sun Sui Wah, etc. then it's all within the parameters. \\n\\nI haven't tried their BBQ so I can't comment on that. All the dishes I ordered were of the woked-up variety: fried rice, fried noodle, rice noodle, spare ribs, salty-peppery-squid, etc.\\n\\nI should qualify my review that this is during regular daytime/evening hours. If you're going there at 4am, I suspect a different Chef and cooking staff will be on and so there may be some variance in quality.

I also had a chicken sandwich that quickly fell apart from a high level of sogginess.  The second time we came, the hot dog was given a second chance, but was exactly the same.  In addition, I ordered a Frito pie that was so cold that the cheese didn't melt.\\n\\nDespite the serious undesirability of the food, the playscape is well maintained and a fun break for kids.

They have an interesting mix of food on the menu, from lobsters and fish, to burgers and sandwiches, to sushi. The latter one kind of took me by surprise and made me doubt at first how good this restaurant was going to be. \\n\\nThat doubt was short lived as i soon was overtaken by the delicious smell of the food around me. I quickly narrowed down to the crab cake sandwich and the lobster club sandwich. At our waiter's recommendation, I went with the crab. And boy am I glad! It was so fresh, tender and tasty. There wasn't much, if any, bread crumbs. If there was, I didn't taste them. All I could taste was the crab. \\n\\nI also went with a side of the smoked shrimp risotto. While the flavor was great, I did feel that the risotto was not as fully cooked as i would've liked. We saved some room for dessert and went with my friend's favorite bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. The bread pudding came in the shape of a muffin with a nice chewy crust and soft interior. It wasn't too mushy which I appreciated. The vanilla ice cream I believe had bits of blackberries and together with some sliced strawberries was the perfect compliment to the pudding. \\n\\nAll in all it was a good dining experience for me and I would definitely recommend it and will be a return customer."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Dear 8lb 6oz baby Jesus dressed up in a lil tuxedo, this place is good!

Everything I said before was true, but I realized after going back, that really the only thing that was great was the albacore and the wild salmon. The farm salmon is the one on happy hour though. The rest was average, and one thing was actually bad, and that was the spider roll. It is so fatty it makes me sick to my stomach, just sits in my stomach forever. I am not opposed to fatty food on occasion if it tastes good. But this had so much fried thick batter and so much mayo or something that it was just too heavy to even be tasty. On a positive note, my friend did like the yellow tail which I didn't, I have no yellow tail to compare like I do spider rolls which I've tasted much better.

We were there on the night of one of our recent blizzards, so it was unusually quite for a Friday night.  The atmosphere was cozy and warm.  We were greeted immediately and given our choice of tables.  Service was fast, friendly and attentive (we were thirsty after shoveling and they kept our water glasses full).  In these days of all ala carte the salad that came with the meal was a pleasant surprise.   The rolls were fresh, hot and delicious.  All the food came out fast and very hot.  We split the eggplant appitizer on special that night.  It was a large portion, well enough for two people, and absolutely wonderful with a hearty red sauce of diced tomatoes, onions, and peppers that just begged to be slopped up with the remaining rolls.  The entrees were equally well portioned (to save room for dessert we both brought some home).   The Chicken Gorgonzola was a savory, tangy cheese sauce tossed with thin slices of grilled chicken and ravioli (I don't know if they were frozen, as one of the reviews claimed, but they were delicious).  The cod special was tender, moist and deep fried with a light coating, served over pasta with a red sauce, large capers and Kalamata olives.  Both dishes were fabulous.  We did not drink that night, but found the wine list very well rounded with some good Italian wines and very well priced.  For dessert they brewed us a fresh pot of very good coffee and we split a homemade canolli ( all desserts are made in-house).

I gave them my name for the reservation and they wished me a happy birthday and seated us promptly.  Just as last time, the service as incredible.  I can say with full honesty and sincerity that they have the best service in Austin.  It was our servers last day at Truluck's and if it were me, I probably would have mentally checked out.  Not her; she was fun, friendly, and very knowledgable about their product.  \\n\\nThe Food:  I had a 12oz South African Lobster Tail...the Rolls Royce of Lobster they call it.  For me lobster is usually a little underwhelming.  I decided to go outside the box and get it and boy was it worth it.  Absolutely amazing!  My wife ordered the Filet, and it was by far the best filet I have had in Austin.  One thing I find in Austin a lot is places cook filets on a grill, which is dumb because it dries the filet out.  They cooked it the proper way: in a pan to sear and finish it in the oven.  We also had a fried shrimp app and crab claws for an app, which were both amazing.  One thing you HAVE to order when you go is the Crab Mac N Cheese.  There was an entire layer of crab on the top and it was life changingly good mac.  \\n\\nWhen we left, the manager thanked us for coming and wished me happy birthday.  The next day, I received a follow up call thanking us for our visit and more birthday wishes.  Who does that?  No restaurant makes that much effort.\\n\\nOverall, Truluck's is one of the best restaurants in town.

And Gladstone now has my whole heart. The crust is perfect, the pizza overall is fantastic, and our service has been spot on. My impression is that if you're nice to the staff, they will be good to you. Our first night here, we had the pleasure of speaking to the owner, and it's clear that he loves what he does.

I used to live in San Diego, CA and just a short hop to Tijuana, Mexico. The food here at El Pueblo isn't this Americanized crap you get at from majority of places here in Orlando, but the real thing! I always get the steak tacos, beef or chicken burrito, or mixed fajitas. Don't let the strip mall feel dissuade you though from coming in. The ladies that works here are extremely sweet.....reminds me of my friend's Tia's in San Diego. Prices are extremely reasonable too!!! I would get a meal for 3 people, and would only spend less than 20 bucks!!! Not kidding!!! Try it for your own self!!!!"},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ahh Beast.  I would be a liar if I said I wasn't disappointed.\\n\\nNaomi, was well, a beast on Top Chef Masters (didn't really check, but that is probably so unoriginal on these reviews).  I couldn't wait to eat here.\\n\\nFirst it should be known that this place is in the middle of nowhere.  Now I'm sure anyone from Portland reading this is rolling their eyes, but we were staying at the Nines downtown, and to say this is the \\"middle of nowhere\\" is generous.  We were lucky that a couple who were also staying in the city finally had a cab show up and offered to share, because there were about 20 of us waiting there for 30 minutes after dinner still trying to get back downtown.  But back to the food.\\n\\nThere are 2 seatings.  We were in the second, which ran about 30 minutes over, but no biggie we grabbed a drink next door while we waited.  Once inside, hmmm, how to describe this.  I've spent the last 10 years in SF, so communal seating is not new to me.  But generally you are at a long communal, where you can still sit across from your partner.  It is easier to keep the flow of conversation that way and tune out your neighbors (when you want to).  The lady and I were sat at a table that seats 8 or so, and sat next to each other as were most others, so you are literally staring at complete strangers across from both of you.  It was just, distracting I guess, how everyone was sitting, and awkward.  The place is tiny to begin with, but I could overlook sitting on my head if the food blows me away.\\n\\nIt didn't.\\n\\nIt was good.  The soup opener was nice.  The pairings throughout were also very well matched.  But the charcuterie plate I thought was really underwhelming.  I mean a tiny pickle with some hot mustard?  A tiny piece of salami?  The foie-gras bon-bon that people raved about was OK, but tiny.  The entree was decent, a rack of lamb with cherries, but honestly I've had much, much better.  And then after the openers and your entree they serve...........a salad??!  Huh?  I mean it was so out of place I was in a slight state of shock to be honest.  The lady was laughing and barely touched hers, waiting for the cheese and dessert courses.  Really, really odd.  What is that supposed to be, a palate cleanser?  Bizarre to be honest.\\n\\nIt was just OK.  Didn't see the superstar chef at all, but her staff was solid on service.  Though good, I was expecting spectacular.  It wasn't."},{"name":"Ty Ginger Asian Bistro","address":"5689 Woerner Temple Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Boyfriend and I stopped here for dinner.  Loved the atmosphere but the food....not so much.  General Tso was chicken with bland brown sauce....no kick or flavor.  Fried rice had no flavor and had peas and carrots.

It's an epic feast of unlimited delicious sushi and assorted Japanese and Chinese food. Weve devastated crab puffs, eaten so many sexy girls (an item on the menu) and had a great time. Expect to spend a while here during the lunch buffet because when it gets busy it could be 10-15 minutes at least between your order and the result. That's why we always order a enormous amount at the beginning."},{"name":"Green Papaya Restaurant","address":"214 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"I haven't had anything besides the vegetarian Pho there so my experience is limited, but I keep going back for a reason (and my husband for the beef pho!).

Gratuitous use of wok oil in my dish. Not spicy per my request (for Schezuan? not spicy??). half of a plate of white rice in two scoop shapes. The rest of the menu looks like it hasn't been updated since the 80's.\\n\\nThis is a working man's place to grab chop suey and a few beers, unfortunately with out an update and a menu refresh, it's just an ok place instead of a great place."},{"name":"49 Social","address":"49 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I am a Bostonian and I get so much joy out of uncovering hidden gems- and this place is one.
