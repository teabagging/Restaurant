The restaurant itself was pretty neat, made to look as thought it was plucked right out of San Francisco and dropped in the middle of Orlando. We made a 7:00pm reservation about two weeks beforehand which ended up coming in handy since it was pouring when it came time to go and it seemed live everyone in the park was trying to get in for dinner. There was about a 10 minute wait for our table but I really didn't mind considering the crowd they had trying to wait out the rain over dinner in the dining room already. \\nOur waiter was fantastic. Although it was packed, and I mean PACKED in there, he was as attentive to us as he could be and made our dining experience very enjoyable. At the end of our meal, our waiter also offered me a to-go cup for my drink and drew cartoon characters on it (since you're not allowed put alcoholic drinks in the decorated kiddie cups). Sometimes it's the little things that make all the difference. \\nTo drink, I had a strawberry lemonade which whoever the bartender was that night made very strong (I didn't mind though, I needed it after a long day in the park). For an appetizer, we all split an order of the cheese bites. For my main course, I had the fresh catch of the day which ended up being Mahi-Mahi. It was very good, the fish and veggies were very well seasoned and the sauce on the side was soooo good. \\nThis dining experience was overall  pretty good, minus one thing. My entr√©e, as well as my mother's salad were both excellent. However, my sister's Fisherman's basket and my father's Lobster roll dinner reportedly weren't that great. They didn't taste bad or anything, the food just wasn't very fresh. The main complaint were the fries which were pretty soggy and looked like McDonald's fries that been reheated in a microwave. From what I understand the food is usually a lot better, so I'm just putting the blame on the large influx of people coming in. \\nOverall, this was a pretty good restaurant to eat at. The staff was very friendly and besides the small details, the food was very tasty. As I mentioned earlier I would highly recommend getting reservations for this restaurant and if you can, try and request a table next to the large fish tank in the center of the restaurant."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I've never ever been to Kobe but have always really wanted to l, tonight I finally made a reservation for two and when we arrived we were told we had to wait 15 minutes and they weren't even sorry about it..."},{"name":"Renata","address":"626 SE Main St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pretty darn good Italian cuisine. Industrial, rustic decor and there's a casual, laidback atmosphere despite the high expectations of cooking that all customers seem to be holding in. At least for me. I knew that when I stepped into Renata, I was expecting a classy, superb meal. \\n\\nService was very intent about making each customer feel comfortable. We had arrived a bit early and waited a bit, but waiters passing by offered a friendly hello and the place was undoubtedly clattering with activity. \\n\\nStarters consisted of the pane bread selection (a tomato pannettone, a deliciously soft olive focaccia, and a rustic pugliese) and a cheese board with cheeses hailing from the Heritage company right next door. The bread was accompanied by three condiments of a honey cultured butter sprinkled with raw bee pollen and sea salt, a raspberry jam, and a porcini mushroom olive oil. All breads were yeasty and soft, absolute carb heaven. The cheese board had smatterings of housemade granola and roasted cherries, along with sweet crostinis studded with almonds and dried fruit. Two of the cheeses were very sharp and savory, the other was a creamy Brie. Both these starters were wondrously light ways to start the meal. \\n\\nFor my main dish, I ordered a prime rib ravioli that was surrounded by little dollops of a rich green sauce and garnished with horseradish and crispy kale. To my surprise, I thought I detected a hint of wasabi in the ravioli. The pasta was supple and cooked beautifully, and raviolis were stuffed full of prime rib meat smoothly ground inside those pasta pockets. I had no trouble scraping away all the remnants of my food, and I also tasted some of the chicken fettucine off my good family friends' plates. Smoked chicken, folks--none of that grilled chicken nonsense. Hearty, juicy, and delicious. Then I tried a bite of the seared salmon, which was the most melt-in-your-mouth fish experience I've ever had. Perfect. \\n\\nSo for me, the quality of the food here at Renata is stellar and certainly lives up to all the hype.

Once we sat down it didn't take long to get menus, water, coffee.  We pored over the menu for awhile because it's interesting and somewhat extensive for breakfast.\\n\\nWe started with the roti special, banana, which was really good, but maybe could have used a pinch of salt/sugar, or something to boost the flavor.  Otherwise addictive.\\n\\nThen I got a smoked trout Benny and my wife got salmon hash.  When these came out, they were really pretty.  \\n\\nThe smoked trout on my Benny was extremely dry and tough.  It was more like trout jerky.  Not something easily eaten with soft, pillowy poached eggs.  I pushed a good bit of it aside and ate the rest of the dish, which was decent.  \\n\\nMy wife's salmon hash was not really hash, nor was it cohesive in any way.  Chunks of potatoes were too big, salmon was in one piece, etc. - it was salmon, eggs and potatoes, but not hash.  It's not a huge deal, but it was not what was expected.  \\n\\nThe veggies on the side were really cool and non traditional, but pretty giant chunks, and unexpectedly challenging to eat.  Beets, carrots, great.  Corn on the cob, okay, but it's covered in butter /oil from the rest of the dish, so I guess it's napkin time.  Also, English peas in the pod, which we were instructed to eat like edamame, and which were also covered in butter (and bearnaise sauce).  A little messy, and not really seasoned, so not worth the effort.\\n\\nLast, my wife found a pretty good sized (~2cm square) piece of foiled purple paper wrapper in her dish.

He told us he was actually the first hire at Curleys so he certainly knew his stuff. It was some of the most attentive service I've ever had. That being said he knew exactly when to join in and when to fade away- an art form if you ask me.\\n\\nThe food was top notch.

We split a side of the shoestring fries and an order of dandelion greens. Everything was relatively simple but done to absolute perfection, making me check back to the menu every few minutes to make mental bookmarks of everything that I wanted to try on my next visit. \\n\\nAnd the drinks! Bogart famously said \\"The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind.\\"  Well, catch up folks!

I got to hear all about how monthly changes to the standard menu items like the mac&cheese, foie gras and others are often inspired by the influx of new ideas coming from these chefs.

Fortunately it was pretty quiet when we got there, and there wasn't the pressure of a line building up behind us.  \\n\\nThe boy got a crispy chicken piada with pasta, and I got a kids' bowl (yes... a kids' bowl) and the lobster bisque.  There is the problem of mixing what should really be cold ingredients into a pasta bowl (ie, lettuce, cold cuts), which I tried to avoid.  There is also some inherent knowledge necessary regarding what will go well together -- ie, no steak or sausage with alfredo.  The boy also found that the wrap became brittle about halfway through, causing it to crumble apart.  For me, the kids' bowl was an adequate sized portion, although not quite completely filling; I had the steak with mushrooms, squash, pomodoro sauce, artichoke hearts, cheese.  The bisque was good at first sip, but became quite salty and, the boy thought, had a powdery sort of aftertaste.  I probably wouldn't get that again; it doesn't seem to mesh that well with their offerings either.\\n\\nI'd be willing to give this place another chance, perhaps with some further study of their menu and seeing with what combinations other Yelpers have had success.

Gretchen's pies were amazing!\\n\\nHowever there are a few things lately that have really irritated us and we are slowing down our formerly two to three times a week we usually come in because :\\n\\n1) the new-ish male barista (NOT Brandon, Brandon is great) has got a real attitude problem... he is frequently making snarky comments, he rarely pays attention to your food order and there for half the time you don't get it and have to come back up to the counter to ask him for it, and with every other barista it takes almost no time at all to get your drink but sometimes I'm done with my breakfast before my coffee is done when he's behind the counter. My husband doesn't even want to go in there now if he is behind the counter thats how artificial and a pathetic this guy is. Also being unable to digest regular milk, I'm pretty sure he also doesn't pay attention to what kind of milk goes into the drinks, as I've gotten seriously ill several times after ordering an almond milk based drink which never happens with any of the other baristas . Everyone else there is so awesome and genuine, but this guy unfortunately represents the snobby hipster stereotype of baristas that give baristas a bad name. \\n\\n2) we had really appreciated it when they had the sign up saying they were no longer powering the outlets along the main wall so they could control the massive amount of people who come in just to use their laptop and drink $1 coffee for 3 hours in a row... It seems like as soon as that sign went away we were once again unable to find a table half the time when we went in, because whenever you go in there at least half if not more of the tables are taken over by solo laptoppers who often give rude looks if you dare to speak to the person you came in with that more than a whisper. Well I don't have a problem if people want to spend a brief amount of time there with their computer this place is unfortunately known with people who turn it into their office because they're too cheap to pay for wifi themselves. What's wonderful about Woodlawn coffee is the interaction and family friendly environment. They would do well to not have free wifi and instead give a code so that people could have it for an hour like Peet's does so they are respecting the fact that other customers actually want to sit down and eat and drink there as well.\\n\\n3) The lack of food in the afternoon is really unfortunate. They serve breakfast and lunch yet today I found out that the kitchen closes at 1 o'clock so I can no longer have a late lunch there even though they're open until 6 p.m. I could deal with this if they had more than four or five cookies left during the afternoon but unfortunately you're just picking up scraps by that time and essentially the cafe turns into an espresso cart. They used to have a wonderful simple dinner service and cocktails - something that was such a nice alternative to the other places on Dekum ( not to mention the only place that you could go for dessert in the evening in this neighborhood) and while I see that they offer cocktails still, its not that tempting to come later in the day for a beer or a drink when there's no food to eat. I would love to see them bring back some basic foods later in the day and market themselves better to get more people in who don't want to go to a pub or pizza place, the former which we are inundated with (3 in 3 blocks).\\n\\n4) they have a guy who plays on Sunday afternoons who has his amp turned up so high you can't even hear yourself think much less talk to the person you're in there with... It's a small cafe - you don't even need an amp! And while I'd be excited to have his guitar playing quietly, unfortunately the guy's voice is absolutely horrid - he actually sounded tone deaf when I was there a couple weeks ago. \\n\\nWe are still huge fans of Woodlawn Coffee and love having them in the neighborhood. We are still loyal but hope that some of these changes will be made so that they are able to take better care of their longtime as well as newer patrons - and not just those who have a laptop in front of them.\\n\\nUPDATE: after writing this last review the owner Gretchen made sarcastic and rude comments to us as we walked in. Rather than try to understand the constructive criticism, she proceeded to tell us to not bother coming in when that barista was working and criticized us rather than trying to understand the negative feedback & make it better. Horrendous business practice and we will NEVER be returning."},{"name":"Library Square","address":"300 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"They'll add a generous service charge onto your bill then hand you the card reader prompting you to add another 20% tip.

It's Tuesday, we arrived at 515 pm, and we had the place to ourselves.  Just like we like, and as if we planned it.  Mom orders a Painkiller and I a Goose martini.  Mom says she would get another Painkiller next time, and its no secret that I'm good for a Goose tini anytime.  All good on the libation rating.  Anyway, we order the Green Ceviche for a starter, to be followed by the Catch of the Day (Red Snapper) and the Shrimp Taco's.  No matter who orders what, ownership is fleeting when food arrives at our table so the following opinions are mutual.  The Ceviche was excellent, although not classic in the sense of what one would expect just inland of the third coast.  It's heavy on fresh tuna and avocado, and light on cilantro and lime.  It was more chunks of sashimi tuna tossed with avocado.  It was excellent, and a bargain at the happy hour price of $5.  The shrimp taco's were more classic and disappeared without trace.  The snapper was accompanied by mussels, a fresh prawn, and a chorizo enhanced stock.  I'm doing the low carb thing now, and it was all I could do to keep from ordering some bread to sop up the stock.  Excellent.  Probably due the Painkiller she downed, Mom goes and orders the Churros \\"to go\\" so that she doesn't have to torture her low carbing husband.  We take our leave, but I'm afraid the Churro's didn't make it past the pedestrian bridge over Shoal creek.  Fried banana, sugar, cinnamon, whipped cream, it was too much.  Alas, tomorrow begins another low carb day."},{"name":"AFURI ramen + dumpling","address":"50 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Broth is watery with little pork flavor and too much garlic.

The seafood penne was the smallest plate of pasta with 3 or 4 shrimp for the steep 16$ price. Finally, the Cobb salad had lunch meat quality cubed turkey.

The owners state that traditionally front of the house staff make 3x as much money as the back of house staff. In order to reduce this disparity, instead of actually paying their staff more, the consumers are forced to carry this burden. The owners blame the minimum wage ($11 for regular employees and $3.75 for tipped employees), instead of their own greediness, for the need of this 3% increase.\\n\\nFurthermore, the owners make no real attempt to tell the consumers this amount will be added to their check.

The root vegetables were a nice complement.\\n\\nNow, the service. It was ok up until we got our food. After that, the server disappeared.

Good fast food style shoestrings (although I think that they should cut their own, given their claims as 'sophisticated comfort food'). However, the plate was riddled with mistakes that I would think this beguiling place would not make: French bread so overdone so I needed a wetnurse to chew it for me first before I could actually digest it; spicy ketchup that tasted like marinara; and bland, unoriginal cole slaw that I salted and peppered to no avail.

He had also just watched a Man vs Food episodes with ribs so that was on his mind too. Entering the place it wasn't very full and while we said hello, nobody greeted us. We took a seat at the nearest booth. The booth was very small and sofas were falling off. The table was fairly dusty and windows uncleaned. They really wanted to go for a homely look, but at least cleanup the place. We ordered the ribs, the Country Boy steak with gravy and a few side items. The waitress got us water a few times, but wasn't particularly chatty.\\n\\nLets start with the sides:\\nPotatoes- Decent\\nSome meat shit- Decent\\nBeans- Bland and flavorless\\nCorn- Bland, flavorless, and soggy\\n\\nNow onto the meat. For $8 i wasn't expecting much and of course, it tasted like the price; extremely chewy and crunchy and got cold fast. Tasted microwaved basically and the gravy overpowered all other taste. Okay and I know steak smothered in gravy is a deep south Georgia thing but really guys? I couldn't even finish it and instead tried the ribs. Ribs were the same. Quite small even for Babyback Ribs and not that juicy.\\n\\nClean the place up. COOK the food; don't microwave it. I really don't mind waiting in the uncomfortable wooden booths for an extra 10 minutes if I know the meal is well prepared. Greet your customers, make them feel at home since you specialize in the homely look.

First let me get this right out in front of everyone, because I have decided to start being very prolific in my restaurant reviews, as I travel 30-40 weeks a year and eat out alot all over the country, and Yelp has been a very good friend of mine recently. What I want to get out in front is that I will never rate a restaurant on price unless it is completely out there good or bad. Frasca is not for the student budget. But I am not a student and I love great food, and this place was a knockout. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we chose this place because of Yelp. So many people had great reviews on Frasca. We felt like dining on Italian, and some wine, and then my coworker and I were going to go have some beers after or more wine and have some fun. It was a monday night and little did we know what was in store for us. It was a special set menu by Jonathan Waxman, a legend in the business, even I recognized him from cooking shows. We were told that the evening was one set price and included several dishes from Mr Waxman, and also a paired wine list from NE Italian region near Venice. Lets go for it! Plus the girl from NE Italy there with the cellar master I believe, well lets just say she spoke almost no english, and was clearly along on the trip for marketing purposes. Holy smokes. If anything we could drink wine and stare at her all night.\\n\\nthe food started to come out with several small appetizers: some calamari in a very light tempura, Scallops on skewers, great light oils and sauces, paired with unusual greens, was amazing. The wine paired was perfect. We continued to receive more and more wine and plates of food, and at the end of the night, i looked back and said by far the angel hair with serrano and dungeness crab was my absolute hands down favorite. Scallops were 2nd. nothing was out of place, wines all matched perfect, the wait staff was exceptional, and we left feeling very good, full but not heavy and tired. We were ready to head to the wine bar down the street and party away the night! \\n\\ni highly recommend Frasca, and woudl also suggest taking a look online to see what they have in store on Monday nights.

I came here with my husband for a birthday dinner and we got seated in the part of the restaurant that looks like you're in a barrel of sorts. The service was pretty terrible from start to finish- it would be one thing if the restaurant had been packed, or even if it had been busy, had our waitress (Jacqueline) come by our table with any sort of frequency, but it was almost like she forgot we were there. We waited at our table for about 10-15 minutes until she showed up to get our drink orders. I wish I was exaggerating- but had we not timed this on our phone, we wouldn't have believed it ourselves-I kid you not, we waited another 25 minutes until we were able to flag another server down to figure out where our waitress had went, and to put our bread and food orders in with him- luckily, he had noticed that we'd been looking around for a while and asked to help out. After he'd gotten our orders, he told us he'd flag Jacqueline down to let her know we still hadn't been brought our drinks or seen from her in a while. Another 10 minutes go by, and she finally came by with our drinks- so it took, in total 45 MINUTES from us sitting down to getting our drink orders- for TWO people. \\n\\nAfter we'd received our drinks took another 25 minutes for the food to come out (Jacqueline didn't come by the table at all in that time frame, or even after the food came out to ask us how our food were or to refill/take our cocktail orders again). We finally flagged her down while she was at another table, put another drink order in, and AGAIN, it took about 20 minutes for the cocktail to get to the table. When we asked her why it took so long for her to come by our table she just responded with 'the bar took a long time.' We would've gotten dessert had we not been fearful that it would've meant most likely waiting another half hour for that. The only thing that Jacqueline did quickly for us that night was ring our card after we'd gotten the check.\\n\\nThe most frustrating part of this whole ordeal was that had the restaurant even been busy, we would've appreciate her checking in our table every now and then to let us know the status of everything, when our food was coming out, to fetch our bread-literally what our waiters are paid to do. It seems like everyone else did our server's job that night.\\n\\nFor the service we received, and an average meal with that caliber of a price tag, we would've preferred to have gone to Chops, Capital Grille, Marcel, even Ruth's Chris.

Boma is certainly aided by being in the amazing Animal Kingdom resort, where I might be able to afford a cot in the boiler room.  It's nothing short of breathtaking as soon as you walk in and that atmosphere is maintained down to the restaurant as well.\\n\\nBoma is a great spot, especially for the dining plan, as it is an extensive buffet and features something for everyone.  Coming from the Northern VA area where there is a huge ethnic population, Boma was slightly less of a culinary adventure for me as it might be for others.  I wouldn't quite call it african food, but more like dishes inspired of by africa to give the general mainstream population a taste they might not normally have.  I wouldn't come expecting intense spices, or wild game meats, but it is certain a welcome change from the usual grilled chicken salads and burgers.\\n\\nFood variety is top notch with an assortment of soups, rice dishes, stewed meats, salad, and desserts.  They also have some unique cocktail offerings that are definitely appealing.  Food quality is generally quite good.  It didn't blow me away with flavor, but generally everything was well executed.  I think the desserts were the highlight for me with a few small truffle items that I couldn't really identify.  Definitely a major draw.\\n\\nWhile Boma isn't quite a quintessential dining experience, it is one of the better food offerings I've had at Disney and definitely has the most unique food offerings, especially compared to other buffets.

Before I go any further, though, I'd like to save most of you the trouble of reading what will surely be an involved review of limited use to most people. \\n\\nA screening is in order! \\n\\nHave you eaten a lot of Japanese food IN JAPAN?\\nDo you have a CRYSTAL CLEAR idea of what to expect from Japanese cuisine? \\nAre you looking for Japanese food that does NOT revolve around sushi?\\nHave you eaten at MANY izakayas?\\nDo you already have a LONG MENTAL LIST OF DISHES that you're hoping to find at this restaurant?\\n\\nIf you answered \\"no\\" to any of these questions, you'll probably get a lot more use out of other reviews. If you answered yes to most all of them, then rejoice! You have located the review that will address your most burning questions! For those of you still with me, allow me to explain why Yuzu has so far been the greatest disappointment I've encountered in Portland. \\n\\nIt is not a bad restaurant; it even has the most comforting izakaya-like embrace available in the metro area. \\n\\nIts authenticity is not in question. \\n\\nYou may find a few favorites here and you may even genuinely enjoy them.\\n\\nBut you will leave with the same nagging natsukashii kimochi that you had when you arrived. Yuzu is unfortunately not what you're fervently hoping it will be.\\n\\nIt is lacking the atmosphere of a real izakaya, and there is not the same opportunity for your party to have privacy. For me, this is no big deal, but I could see how it might be important to you. If you're familiar with small izakayas, then you already know you'll probably need a reservation here even on a weeknight. You'll also be aware that plates are generally tapas-style portions and that a good appetite will cost you about $20 a head. The service is generally what you'd expect, and you be overjoyed to receive your beer poured with abundant head if that's your freaky-teaky thing. (Other booze options are fairly limited.) The big kicker for me is the food itself -- particularly the lack of dishes I grew to consider staples.\\n\\nYou want gobo? Too bad. Renkon nikku? Sorry. Bacon-aspara? Screw you, buddy. Love those shiso-wrapped, tempura battered chicken-stuffed maki? Yeah, no dice. If you have a hankering for truly succulent tori negi, well... they have that, but it's loveless and sad. I couldn't even get agedashi tofu (!!!). The okonomiyaki is certainly not the way you like it, and the yakisoba tastes sterile and packaged. In fact, most of the food here does. Think pickles that have lived a long, fruitful life in a jar. Some of it is probably prepared fresh, but it really tastes like it spent a lot of time in a box flying over the Pacific. And while you can't fault the place for that since we're not in Japan, it does mean that you will not get the fix you're looking to get. \\n\\nI could continue with a pretty long list of things you might expect at any izakaya that are NOT served here, but it would pain us both and bore the people who ignored the screening questions and kept reading. \\n\\nSuffice it to say that Yuzu is probably the best and most authentic izakaya-style Japanese joint in Portland. And if you're looking to soothe a well-informed nostalgic craving for Japan, that is a depressing thing indeed."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Very disappointed.

It's a counter service restaurant, you basically build your own bowl based on the list of ingredients or choose one of the named bowls where the ingredients are already determined. Build your own is the way to go.\\n\\nI opted for the extra protein (+$4) but I wouldn't do it again because the bowl is big enough to be filling even at the cheaper tier ($10). Toppings are included in the price, with the exception of a handful of \\"premium\\" ingredients like avocado or masago that cost an extra dollar.\\n\\nThe tuna isn't the best quality, but it's solid. Actually this seems to be hit or miss, my wife got the last bits of one tub and her tuna looked perfect, while I got the start of the next tub and some of it was just a bit pale.  It was still good, maybe a couple of pieces had a bit of a fishy taste (more so than expected at any rate), but it's a minor quibble because overall it was really delicious.\\n\\nThe girls at the counter are really friendly, and you'd be hard pressed to make bowls like this at home for the price you're paying to have them do it for you.

It's a bit warm, because any large open space with a partially exposed kitchen will be so, but as long as it's not 100 degrees outside, you'll be okay.  Brisket and ribs are a fantastic value - get the \\"Tray\\" - pick a hot side and a cold side, and you'll have more than enough food to stuff yourself with.  The ribs are a great value - six or seven large pork ribs, with tender meat that is easy to eat without being overcooked - PRO TIP: you don't want \\"falling off the bone\\" - if it is, it's overcooked.  You want your ribs to be tender but still adhering a bit.  The brisket is a huge portion of slow-cooked goodness, with just enough fat to keep it tender. \\n\\nYour table will come with a plethora of sauces for dipping and slathering - the vinegar-based sauce is fantastic, as is the large bottle of sweet KC style sauce.

The onion rings were a generous portion with very thick batter and absolutely no flavor. The rings didn't even have salt or pepper, thus were extremely bland and unappetizing. If you wanted to put ranch or another sauce on the rings to give them a chance At flavor, that will be another 54 cents a packet, which added to our disappointment.

We chose to share an order of chicken and steak fajitas that were, as always, excellent. The tortillas were warm and fresh and SA is easy on the substitutions, like black beans instead of refried.

And, who knows, you might have to kill somebody, and rightfully so, because... sushiritto. Or, you might have to defend yourself attempting to decapitate your head for your spot in the line. I don't know. But bring a decent weapon. Maybe even a dog.\\n\\nBecause as a person that's eaten at the original Sushiritto joint, and admittedly huge hater on Asian fusion, I... really loved this SF Frankenstein-child. And having something remotely close to it in the ATL is sort of a dream come true. Thank God for this family.\\n\\nAll right, to the point, here are things to know:\\n*****\\nI. LOCATION & PARKING\\nThe popup resides in the cooking school behind Jake's Ice Cream and Irwin Marketplace. --Find somewhere to park on Irwin Street NE and walk on over. \\n\\nAlso, they're only open from 5:30-8:30pm on Sundays. \\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK\\nIt's a pretty simple menu, so here's what you have to know:\\n\\nA: STYLE: Peeps can either choose a poke bowl ($11.95), sushi burrito ($11.95), or hand roll ($5.95). They're basically similar ingredients, but presented in different ways. Don't get the hand roll, though. (It's like a snack.) Go big or go home.\\n\\nB: FISH: Tuna or salmon.\\n\\nC: SAUCE: Spicy or savory.\\n\\nD: SIDES: There's seaweed salad and edamame. There's also these pastries with this vanilla filling that's hella decadent. Get those ($4.95).\\n\\nE: DRINKS: Bottled water or La Croix ($1.50).\\n\\nUnfortunately, because I'm an a**hole and karma is a b****, my group was the first to not receive any dish with rice. So we were generously refunded and given a small salad with a fish of our choice. The salad with spicy salmon - albeit a bit heavy on the sauce - was still delicious nonetheless. I could've eaten an entire pho pot of this stuff.\\n\\nIII. SERVICE\\nThey're a small mom & pop shop, so they're still figuring out the kinks. They didn't anticipate the popularity of their opening, so I think they're overwhelmed and prepare well enough. But hey, it's all right. They'll get it right. And I'll be their number one customer.\\n\\nI do feel bad for the people that stood in line and didn't even receive the chance to order, but, again, it was their first opening. Popups = modern day Hunger Games. \\n\\nIV. AMBIENCE & D√âCOR\\nAppa resides in a cooking school aka looks like someone's kitchen and living room. (The inside has AC!) Lol. But really, I would wear a hat and breathable clothes, since you'll stand outside for a while. There's also a black cat outside on a leash. \\n\\nV. PRICES\\nI think they're fair. They use solid ingredients, and it's labor intensive.\\n\\nVI. OVERALL\\nI'm stoked about Appa and can't wait for them to possibly open up a brick-and-mortar sometime in the future. (Do it, please.) I would eat there, probably, every week if they did so. \\n\\nAlso, despite the hiccups, and them running out of rice (which is kind of funny for Asian folks lol), I ain't mad.

I wanted beer and Tapestry wasn't open yet.\\n\\nSo we walked down the road to Thornton's for a few drinks.  I normally try not to review a place until I've been there at least a couple of times.  But I don't think I'm ever going back so I might as well write this.\\n\\nThe upside of going during off hours and not ordering the food the restaurant is known for is that you get a much better idea of what they're like when the spotlight isn't on them.  It makes it more likely to catch them with their pants down.  And while Thornton's wasn't disappointing, it wasn't spectacular.  It did its job as a bar and the one unorthodox dish I ordered was good.\\n\\nI ordered two pints of Guinness and and a pint of Lagunitas.  Our bartender was slow.  This could have been because she was European.  I couldn't place the accent, but if she ever lost her job at Thornton's, she could easily be cast as a Celtic damsel in a medieval play.  She was nice but a tad sleep-deprived.\\n\\nAfter two pints of Guinness, I ordered the steamed dumplings.  It's not traditional bar food but ordering something atypical can reveal a lot about the cooks' skill level.  First of all, the dumplings were massive.  I've had dumplings all over, both domestic and foreign, and these were the biggest ones I've ever had.  Each dumpling spanned my entire fist.  They were tasty too.  They had a bit of a crunch from veggies but there was more than enough pork in there too.  The sweet chili dipping sauce was great.  I paired that with some Tabasco for contrasting sweet and spice.  It was quite satisfying.\\n\\nProbably my favorite thing about this place was the decor.  The bar was separated from the dining area by a partition and above the dining area was a shelf with knick-knacks of an aquatic and marine nature.  Look at the photo to see what I'm talking about.  This was wonderfully random considering that there was nothing aquatic or marine about the restaurant's motif or menu.  It's things like that I appreciate and why I would recommend it for a relaxing beer, a date, and a plate of dumplings."},{"name":"Tortilleria Y Tienda De Leon's","address":"16223 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Chile Rellano Burrito - order in advance\\nAuthentic, organic Mexican food worth wait and frustration communicating with employees with poor English skills"},{"name":"Hofbrauhaus Columbus","address":"800 Goodale Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Yikesssss.

Yeah!\\n\\nSoWa Market encompasses everything I love:\\n-Arts and crafts\\n-Homemade, local products\\n-Food trucks\\n\\nMy good friend Chris L. raved bout this place and informed me that we were actually going to the first one of the season! Needless to say, I was pumped. We arrived around 11am and it was packed already. The market is separated with the food on one side and the arts & crafts on the other. (Which is a good considering the crowds would be chaotic.) \\n\\nWe headed towards the vendors/artisans first. As soon as I saw all those tents, my heart fluttered. They had typical items such as jewelry, handbags, printed shirts, household decorations and more. And to the more unique selections -- saw a stuffed animal taxidermy, I.E.

It definitely inspired me. After some deliberation, I bought a small gold bar necklace. Trust me... I wanted to buy everything but the kitchen sink. But my bank acct. would certainly feel it. Side note! One of the really neat programs they use for purchases is the \\"square\\" app for credit cards. So no worries if you don't have cash! \\n\\nNow for the food. Deciding on one food truck alone was a feat in itself. There were about 15 to choose from and each had lines with about 30 people, so I had to think fast. I decided on \\"Bon Me\\", a Vietnamese food truck. Their BBQ Pork Banh Mi was absolutely delicious. The portion of pork was big, bold, flavorful and nestled nicely with the pickled carrots, cilantro, mayo in a crispy baguette. Banh Mi heaven. All in all, I probably waited about 15 mins for my sandwich. Given the crowds and high demand... those people worked fast! They certainly had a solid system going on. \\n\\nWhat else is there to say?

I'm not sure what exactly she loves but to each his own. \\n\\nIt's Friday night and they are a little busy so I'll give them that, but the service was pretty bad. We were sat right away and the girl said she'd also be our server and would be right back to get our drink order. 10 minutes goes by and another girl asked if we've been helped. We said no so she took our drink orders for us. Another 10 minutes goes by and she comes back with 1/2 our drinks. My friends is wrong and she didn't bring water. Friend sucks it up and drinks it as is and we wait another 5 minutes for water. At this point we place our order. \\n\\nThe manager (or someone else not in a uniform) brings our orders, which we both got the fish and chips. He asks if we want malt vinegar, yes, and brings us some a minute later. Now I'm very glad that it's a new bottle and it hasn't been open for God only knows how long, but they didn't even take the wrapper off of it. There weren't any serrated edges or easy peel areas and I struggled with it. Another waitress walked by and she laughed and said that she hated those things, they were so hard to open. Why would you give that to a guest? Weird. No worries though. I got it open and all was well.  \\n\\nI tried to flag our waitress down a few times, but she would never look at our way, so I eventually flagged down anybody who walked by to see if they could grab some tartar sauce for my friend. The person was not very happy to help us since we were not her table but she must have relayed the message to our waitress because a few minutes later she showed up with two things of tartar sauce. She never asked how everything was or if we needed anything and only stopped if we were staying to flag her down. \\n\\nThe food was not that great. That's not fair, let me take that back.  The french fries and coleslaw were both good. They were not anything special or homemade, they were frozen french fries and prepackaged coleslaw, but they tasted good. The fish, however, was god-awful. One piece was hard as a rock and I had to cut it with a knife. It was very tough to chew and it almost seemed like I was given dry chicken instead of fish. The second piece was tender and flaky in the middle but hard and dry around the edges like the other piece. Also, both pieces were tiny. The bigger piece was the size of a playing card and the smaller the size of a business card.  \\n\\nAfter dinner we moved outside because there was a band playing inside that was decent, but it was obscenely loud and we could hear a word the other was saying, even when screaming. \\n\\nMy first drink was a special of the evening - cucumber lime mojito. It was so so - it tasted more like flat Sprite with cucumber in it than anything else, but I nursed it and eventually finished it. For my second drink I asked for a Margarita on the rocks, but that was a complete disaster. It was pure sour mix and nothing else. It was awful. I wasn't going to say anything or send it back because it wasn't that big of a deal, but my friend said something for me and they remade it. Your second one was a little bit better but still very heavy on the sour.  They messed up each of my friends drinks but she never said anything so they never fixed them. \\n\\nI don't know if it was the food or the sour drinks but something made me super sick. Like suuuuuuuuper sick. Within an hour of eating.

I'm not sure if there would ever be a greater meal than brunch and I was delighted when I was finally able to try Breakfast Table.\\n\\nLet me tell you the journey I had gone through to try this spot.  When this restaurant first opened, I tried going one Sunday morning, but was intimidated by the hefty lineup (I can't wait for an hour when I'm hangry!) and gave up and went for dim sum next door instead.  Fast forward a couple months and I tried going again but was faced with another hour long lineup so I went to Earl's instead to have their brunch special.\\n\\nThen today, a miracle happened.  I went to Breakfast Table at 11am and was seated right away, and I now know why this place has a permanent line up on the weekends.  There are so many wonderful choices on the menu, traditional egg benedicts, and Asian fusion brunch dishes and a good selection of sweet items and salad.  I ended up ordering the bulgogi hash with poached eggs.  I loved the combination of spicy Korean flavour with beautifully roasted potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  The seasonal vegetables served with this dish were roasted corn on the cob, rutabaga, saut√©ed mushrooms, spinach and carrots. They serve Milano coffee at Breakfast Table, btw. \\n\\nMy partner ordered the chicken cobb salad and in his words: \\"It was delicious! Good value at $15 with half an avocado, saut√©ed mushroom and skin-on chicken breast that was cooked perfectly. 5/5 drool emojis\\". There you go, we both agree that the food is fantastic and finished everything on our plates.  Okay I skipped the carrot actually but that's just me. \\n\\nCan I go back to try something else at Breakfast Table again tomorrow?"},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Visited again,  this time for dinner on a Friday evening.

The service here remained great. I tried the trout,  which is deboned at your table. Very good entr√©e to try but still be careful of soft bones that remain.  Companion had the seagood cassoulet. I think he enjoyed it but you have to disassemble some components before eating. Great for date night or meet ups with friends!

Great selection of seafood, prices and drinks.\\n\\nService: our waitress was very bubbly, gave us recommendations and earned herself a great tip.\\n\\nEating here is quite unique as you won't be eating with forks, spoons or even plates. They set a sheet of white paper on the table, hand you a bag that brings wet wipes, gloves, a plastic bag and a bib. Everything is essential since eating will probably be pretty messy.\\n\\nI got the Argentinian shrimp with head off (this was an additional dollar). My flavor was \\"shakin\\" which was the house Cajun. For spice level I got hot. It was in fact really hot but, I enjoyed it a lot more than the medium spice. If you like a little bit of spicy but not too much I would go with the medium. My boyfriend got the blue crab, but he also wanted to add shrimp to it. Since you can add sides to your order the waitress suggested to get the \\"shake it up\\" as a side this included a 1/2lb of shrimp with a side of fries. \\n\\nEverything we ordered was perfect, a little messy but delicious. The flavor was my favorite part as well as the spice. Prices here are very reasonable. I feel as though we got a great deal for the amount of food we got.

He left without any hesitation. As we were seated, there was a party next to us and this Caucasian man didn't have an ID that fit their standard/not a valid ID. The waitress went to speak to the bartender and he was VERY VERY obnoxiously persistent about staying. He wouldn't stop making excuses to stay, trying to touch the bartender, extremely smug and made it so awkward to be within earshot of him. During his whole argument with the staff we were sitting idol for a good 15 minutes waiting to order. After awhile and the man refused to leave they called the manager and miraculously he ended up staying. If I wasn't meeting people I probably would have left. At no fault is this the bar's but that same party next to us had a lot of people that they crowded into our table's space. Caught them eavesdropping and they would get so loud when we would try to talk to each other. \\n\\nSlightly disgusted but I guess if you're shamelessly and obnoxiously stubborn you'll get to stay.

The chocolate brownie was *good* but I don't know... it was like too moist and not enough richness. Kind of felt like I was eating dry brownies as well. Mini-cakes were subpar and overly sweet.

We had been on the lookout for a place that we ended up not being able to find, so we turned around and headed here.  I was a little wary, seeing as how the building used to be, like, a Rally's or something--but they really made it nice inside.\\n\\nService at the counter was exemplary--almost overly friendly.  We were asked if we'd ever been before, and we said \\"No,\\" which caused our server to launch into a full explanation of the menu.  This particular customer service tactic annoys the almighty hell out of me, but I know that I'm in the minority on that--I would just rather be left to concentrate on the menu and ask if I have questions rather than have to listen to a three-minute explanation that prolongs my ordering time.  (Really, it's a burger place, the menu is NOT that complicated.)  The counter person, though, was very friendly and even ignored what might have been a few slightly sarcastic under-the-breath comments to my husband (I am not usually such a tremendous bitch but I get cranky when I'm hungry--sorry, counter person!).\\n\\nWe went whole hog ordering--shakes, full-sized burgers, split a large fry.  The total came out to be $24, which is quite a bit to spend on burgers--but, I gotta say, I can't say it wasn't worth the money.  I ordered a Sicilian burger with salami, banana peppers, provolone, some other stuff; my husband got a BLT burger with swiss and mushrooms added.  The manager couldn't find the ticket when our food was up, so he brought the food out to us personally, as he quickly scanned the dining room and ascertained that it was our food.  I REALLY REALLY appreciated this.  I've been to places before (cough-hounddogs-cough) where \\"mystery\\" food will just sit and sit while you wait and wait because nobody will take 30 seconds to try to connect the dots.  \\"Hey.. those people are waiting for food... THIS is unclaimed food....\\"  \\n\\nThe manager was extremely courteous, coming out to the dining room to check how we're doing and see how the food was.  He cleared away some of our baskets when we were finished eating.  \\n\\nAnd the food?  Pretty damn tasty, actually.  The burger was loaded up with toppings--I believe there were TWO slices of cheese on my burger, which is just astounding in a day and age where you'll get half a slice if the restaurant can get away with it.  The large fry? HUGE.  We weren't able to finish it.  Honestly, next time we go to GB, we'll probably both get junior burgers and split a regular or even a small fry.  The milkshakes were pretty good, too.  Hubs got chocolate (which, all chocolate milkshakes pretty much taste like Frosties to me), and I got vanilla, which was made with vanilla bean ice cream, and therefore very good.\\n\\nAlso, did I mention there was SALAMI on my burger? Because there was.  And it was almost as magical as the capicola burger I had in Cincinnati.  imo, burgers need more cured pork products.\\n\\nTwo thumbs up, Graffiti Burger.

I didn't feel like reminding her 'cause I already called her out on making me wait  for 10 minutes. \\n\\nShe made every effort customer service wise and was really sweet including being open minded and polite about some criticism I had. This place isn't cheap and regardless of the type of customer that walks in the door you need to make them feel reasonably important. It was 'cause of the 10 minute wait that I only spent 1/2 of what I initially budgeted for. \\n\\nI had the demi high tea, gluten free and dairy free. The sandwiches were great, the desserts were great, however, the GF/dairy free scone fell apart easily. The cream that came with it was as hard as cold butter, therefore, the combination of an overly delicate scone and hard cream made for a miserable scone experience. At that point there was no way I was able to make the consumption classy. \\n\\nThey need to experiment more with refining the gluten free recipe that doesn't fall apart so easily. Perhaps even incorporating Xanthan gum would help. I bake gluten free, therefore, I know that it is easier said than done, however, I've had GF scones at other places that don't crumble to the touch. \\n\\nThe tea comes in a treasure box with the most popular flavors available for smell testing before choosing. \\n\\nThey didn't have any Stevia, therefore, I used my own. \\n\\nOverall it was a decent experience.

When I went to this establishment on Saturday afternoon I looked at the menu and saw that they only do combination meals mon-friday.As soon as I saw that I went to speak to the lady at the front desk and I told her this is what I want and I will even pay you extra because I didn't want to order that much food separately, I just wanted the combo. She refused to aid me in any way possible. I talked to her a total of 3 times I even offered to pay the difference for whatever inconvenience may occur.She then explain that apparently lunch is somehow special and they cant recreate that specialness outside of the given times.

A couple years ago I called during lunch for delivery and got yelled at by the guy for ordering during lunch time.  I told him Im sorry I bothered him and please cancel my order.  That left a bad taste in my mouth with them.  I gave them a second shot, cause I am very understanding of everyone having a bad day and business could have been out of control.  So they have been awesome for the past couple years for us.  Then today I called at 11:30am  for a delivery and he told me it would be a while for delivery, I said \\"take your time, no rush\\"  I gave him my order - which was a salad with tuna and a tuna pocket...he made a smug noise and said again, very rudely, it will take a while...I again said...really its ok, no problem.  I wanted to put it on my card so I got up to get it, and he said he has no time for me to get my card (by then it was in my hand)  and then he said call back and hung up on me.  I waited a few minutes to cool off and called back to cancel it, because I was pissed.  The lady started yelling at me...literally screaming at me that business cant stop because I was getting my card.  My opinion is there is a different way of handling this.  I am a paying customer who took 3 minutes of his time.  I will not give them business anymore because I dont feel like getting yelled at for paying them.

The design is nothing special, mimics a cantina style decor with metals and wood. It has a bar with TVs. The seating is comfortable and the ambiance is good (better than the food). Their is music in the background but it is not obstructive and you can actually have a conversation with someone at a normal level. \\nMy friend ordered the beef brisket and shrimp taco.

At $5 a taco, we both wondered what the taco size would be, typical soft taco or street taco size. \\nWe had only been seated a couple of minutes when my friends order came out. I thought wow, didn't expect that. They are street taco size but use flour tortillas rather than corn. That's no problem if taste and quality are good. Unfortunately, the food is average.

The proteins seem to  be made way in advance. Wondering if the proteins are from the day before. Non of the proteins had a charred look or taste. They were soft wet and bland. Shrimp and steak tasted boiled. The pork belly seemed fried without seasoning and not hot. No way these are cooked to order. At least heat them up guys. Strike two. All the tacos seem to have the same sauce base. They are bitter with a watery consistency and no real flavor, off putting. Almost had a turned flavor, not fresh. The sauces used did not contemplate any of the proteins. Strike three. Then came the calamari ($9), way later but that was a good thing. I assume the wait meant it was freshly made. It was the best and only good food. They were hot, crispy, not greasy with a nice seasoning that was not overpowering but tasty. The portion is a bit small but delicious. \\nSo if in the downtown area with a craving for calamari and a Mexican chela this is the spot. If you want tacos keep on walking to any of the many taco joints already around here. I have had food trucks that blow this away at less than half the price. If your charging $5 a taco it better be the best damn taco.

I usually hope to find valet but without that one is forced to figure out where they're going while in heels...speaking for my ladies! No fun. The Watershed however had plenty of free parking and only a block from the entrance. Upon entering and I noticed that there was quite a few people waiting outside which led me to believe whatever they're serving here it must be good if people are waiting on it so make a reservation! It is right next to egg Harbor which is another brunch spot--do not get the two confused, take a sharp right through the main entrance and you'll find yourself at The Watershed. Beautiful contemporary vibes, grey hues and lots of light. I instantly wanted to open my Pinterest account and create another dream board. We really couldn't stop taking mental notes on the the d√©cor. It was really beautiful and simple. We were looking forward to the food at this point. As we looked at the menu they had a little something for everyone. Three of us went for the Farm egg breakfast as it came with a little bit of everything: grits, bacon or sausage a cream biscuit or whole-wheat toast and huge fluffy eggs. My other friend went with the chicken and dumplings, it was quite an elaborate dish. Portions were excellent and food was delicious. Very good quality and you could taste it.

They no longer carry almond milk, which is a bit sad to me, but oat and soy milks are still good vegan options.\\n\\nThe tacos satisfy and are decently priced for a non-SoCal place. You can request corn tortillas to make them gluten free, and they are also easy to make dairy-free as well without cheese and crema. Although my tacos tend to look sparser than my friends' since they're stripped of most of their toppings (see the photos), I still find them tasty. The avocado tostada remains my favorite, with a thick slather of spiced mashed avocado accompanied by the crunch of pepitas and tartness from pickled onions (which I usually don't like, but I like them here). I've seen some gluten and dairy free \\n\\nMy friends have also really enjoyed the carnitas and egg taco on flour tortillas. The Tall Man often gets the cold brew flight, which you can order at the bar.\\n\\nThe place has kept its fun atmosphere, with lots of types of seating and board games to play.

The food was not up to spec. I ordered the steak frites w/ the option of filet and truffle fries. My fries were not truffled which was SO DISAPPOINTING because I was saving the calories for this. The steak was also way overdone for a medium rare order. Not tender or juicy and mostly just dry.

Eating family-style, our party of five began with a double order of the fried dumplings, before advancing to three entrees and roast pork lo mien.  Perhaps we caught them on an off night, but we found the service to be unacceptably slow (almost 10 minutes to receive menus), cold and mechanical.  Water glasses were, however, refilled faithfully.\\n\\nThe fried dumplings were of a frozen purveyor familiar to me, and not known as a quality brand.  Doughy and thick, with a dense meat filling, they lacked both character and discernable flavor.  Coupled with a timid dipping sauce, they could have been much better.  Next came Wor Shu Opp (duck), beef with mushrooms and bamboo shoots and a shrimp dish whose name escapes me.  The shrimp were ordered \\"medium spicy.\\"  Trailing the pack by at least five minutes was the pork lo mien.\\n\\nThe duck was quite light in its protein content, but a respectable rendition of a classic Cantonese dish.  I appreciated the fact that it was completely boneless, and that a more flavorful kitchen-made sauce replaced the ubiquitous brown sauce which so often denigrates this dish.  Beef with mushrooms and bamboo shoots was tasty, and seemed to be the most popular of the entrees amongst the diners at our table.  Both entrees were solid and generally enjoyable.\\n\\nOur shrimp dish is where things began to slide downhill.  With little detectable chili heat, few shrimp and a pasty sauce, the dish clearly missed the mark.  This brings discussion to the pork lo mien.  Very light on both slices of roast pork and vegetables, the noodle was a vermicelli.  The dish was stir fried with just enough soy sauce to lend a light brown color, but not enough supporting ingredients to provide the umami flavor generally sought in this dish.  A bit of garlic and a tablespoon or two of oyster sauce would have improved the flavor greatly, as there was just too great a portion of vermicelli to be balanced by the meager quantities of other ingredients.  This was, unfortunately, a rather unpolished example of Sino-American cuisine, circa 1965.\\n\\nMinimally decorated, the interior walls of Canton Cooks were painted in pink.  Perhaps only a subjective take, but this also brought back memories of '60's Sino-American chow mien houses.\\n\\nThe tab was reasonable, and while inconsistent and poorly serviced, our dinner at Canton Cooks was strictly \\"alright;\\" nothing special, but generally inoffensive."},{"name":"Pepe's Cantina","address":"5415 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Had the best experience.

We had gone for brunch a while back and enjoyed ourselves but not enough to make it a neighborhood haunt. Well, this past Sunday finally gave us the opportunity we'd been waiting for and we were not disappointed!\\nThey started us off with some oat cakes and butter - while the oat cakes themselves were a teensy bit soggier/softer than I had in Scotland, they had a delicious, hearty flavor that worked beautifully with the salted butter. For entrees, we ordered haggis, the white pudding (chicken sausage with mashed taters and acorn squash), the fish platter, the shepherd's pie, and the minted mushy pees. The haggis was strong but quite tasty, with great, slightly crunchy radishes on the side. The white pudding and shepherd's pie were delicious as well. The fish platter was a little oversalted, although the beet-cured salmon was quite interesting to try. And the minted mushy pees were really refreshing - slightly crunchy and very fresh-tasting (don't let the name put you off!).\\nTo round out the evening, we ordered the sticky toffee pudding. It was wonderfully crispy and warm with a tasty side of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.\\nFor $26 per person (we had a party of 5), and 5 entrees, 1 side, 1 drink, and 1 dessert, I'd say the Haven is a great deal. We had leftovers, even! The food is hearty and yummy, the service is friendly, the ambiance is awesome, and it's pretty on par with the food we had in Scotland!"},{"name":"Woodlawn Coffee & Pastry","address":"808 NE Dekum St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Somehow almost everything here is good.

I love it."},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If you are in the mood for food without flavor, this is your spot! My husband and I shared a few dishes that our waitress recommended as good vegetarian options. I'd like to start off with saying that the service at Emmer & Rye was good. Our waitress was kind, polite and helpful. She delivered a drink that we had ordered at the beginning of our meal, about 2 dishes in, but apologized for the delay. It wasn't particularly busy, but I appreciated her acknowledgement of the tardiness of the drink. \\n\\nWe started out somewhat \\"strong\\" with a mushroom toast, with miso dressing. (I apologize for not having the specific name listed on the menu. After our meal, I figured I could go on the website and get the most current menu; however the items on the menu from last night's dinner are not the same ones listed on their website right now). The mushroom toast was slightly larger than the size of a quarter. In Emmer & Rye's defense, it was listed as a dim sum item, and is expected to only feed one person. It tasted great, but we wondered why it was so small? It was not particularly heavy. It was drenched in olive oil, so perhaps, people could only handle a certain amount of olive oil. Unsure there. This is an FYI for the dim sum dishes- they are very small. \\n\\nNext, we ordered a \\"pea something\\" dim sum dish. It was a clear soup with cut up colored peppers, black eyed peas, and perhaps some other vegetables. This was fine. It wasn't particularly memorable nor would I recommend it to anyone. Our third dim sum was a roasted beet dish. I'm probably at fault for not asking more clarification as to how we should be eating a roasted beet. It was a whole beet with the skin on. First of all, there's minimal lighting in the restaurant, so it's difficult to even see the skin. Until I ate a bite. Big mistake. I immediately spit it out (as politely as possible). My husband cut the beet open and started digging it out. It was extremely difficult to get the actual vegetable out of the skin. I feel like we wasted most of the vegetable, while trying to avoid the unsavory skin. This will be memorable- but in a bad way. \\n\\nLastly, we ordered two savory dishes: angel hair pasta with white wine sauce and paneer with tomato and roti. It should be noted that both dishes were covered in parsley. There is garnish, and then there's overkill. This was overkill x 10. The angel hair paste was submerged in a white wine sauce and topped with some sort of bread crumb, perhaps fried? There was absolutely no flavor in this dish. We were tempted to ask for salt, but decided against it. The pasta was cooked and wrapped up tightly, so it was hard to unravel or to eat comfortably. Let's not forget the overload of parsley you had to go through before getting to the actual dish. The paneer and tomato with roti was okay. There was not much flavor. I'm not comparing it to other Indian dishes, as I do not believe that was the intent of the chef, but as a dish on it's own, there was minimal flavor. The roti was decent, and appeared uncooked in certain areas. \\n\\nI was intrigued by the garlic ice cream, but decided against it after being disappointed by so many of the earlier dishes. This is not a place we will visit again (unless we want to forego flavor)."},{"name":"Comella's","address":"1095 Great Plain Ave","city":"Needham","stars":"3","text":"This may not be gourmet but is great Italian comfort food.

You relax into a table and await the experience.\\n\\nYou'd think at an intimate setting like this the service would be exceptional but in reality the service is atrocious.

If I had come for a date or a business dinner I would have been mortified at my poor choice of restaurant.\\n\\nFood wise there is good news. The biscuits and honey butter they give you as the bread course are literally the best biscuits I've ever had in my entire life. Phenomenal. \\n\\nThat's where the good news ends. Somehow this place made it's way to the list of Boston's best steakhouses but I can only surmise that's because Boston has so few good local non-chain steakhouses. The wedge salad has cayenne on it and not in an interesting what-is-that-hitting-my-tongue kind of way but in a this-salad-is-too-spicy kind of way. The filet has too much salt on it and isn't seared in a way that gives it that nice maillard flavor.

Our first true Vegan/GF restaurant experience started with a trip to Harlow's after arriving in Portland. The vibe was very easy going, plenty of people filled the larger tables, but the corner by the window spoke to us. The aesthetic was like nothing we've seen in LA!\\n\\n I cant recall all the food we ordered, but the vegan/gf Mac n Cheese was splendid. The noodles were not too hard (which can be the case with some gluten-free noodles) and the sauce was light, not too sticky or gooey, but still had a cheesey savory flavor that all Mac n Cheese should have. \\n\\nI had a slight issue with the bread on a sandwich we ordered, as it became soggy and easily fell apart, but that is sometimes a characteristic of gluten-free bread. The service was a little cold at times. It seemed that some of the workers did not want to be bothered or had the patience. Regardless they were not fussy and took our order, and we received our food in a timely manner.\\n\\nTheir merchandise was appealing too, I wanted everything! I was set on buying their metal cup and a bag of Water Avenue coffee (...which I have still yet to brew, but it still smells amazing). \\n\\nAs a man who does not aim to be Vegan nor cares to be Gluten Free, I was surprised at how delicious their food was (it was organic, duh) and I would definitely visit for more food, should I travel to Oregon again. \\n\\nP.S.

Dan's had great reviews oh, so we jumped up, headed down south and ravenously pulled into the parking lot. In a race for the door, two other customers parked on either side of us flung open both of their doors in a rush to get in the building first. Seeing this gave us hope. The burgers must be worth all this commotion! When we walked in the door, we looked around and inhaled the atmosphere. This place had a divey diner feel, right out of a 70's movie, minus the drive-in and sans gum chewing waitresses with coifs loaded with hair spray. We stood back, studied the menu above our heads while simultaneously listening to the seemingly robotic, familiar orders the regulars ahead of us. Obviously they'd visited this establishment quite a few times before. Again, another sign that this place had to be good. Without further hesitation, I ordered a medium Hickory cheese burger with bacon and my husband ordered a large jalepe√±o cheeseburger. We also ordered a medium cheeseburger for the kid and two small curly fries to share. $25.65 is what we paid for this adventure. Now time to see if it's worth it. We grabbed our Fountain drinks which were self serve and proceeded to find a table. The three of us a twin and separate directions looking for a clean table to no avail. There were five patrons in the restaurant sitting down eating. All the other tables were either covered in Greasy residue on the table tops or full of trays, cups and trash. On a Sunday afternoon at 1:30, this should not have been the case. Nevertheless, my husband grabbed some napkins and attempted to \\"clean\\" an empty booth seat and table so we could sit down. As we're sitting down, we noticed trash (i.e. napkins, cup lids, straws, paper) underneath the table and several others as well. We sat waiting for our food and also wondered how long it would take for someone to come and clean the tables. Our food arrives, promptly, and hot. We finished our food in about 30 minutes. As we were getting up to leave, one young gentleman comes out of the back and begins picking up trash off of one table very slowly, one item at a time. I won't be back and this is why:\\n\\n1. Burgers were not exceptional to be honest. Top Notch, Mighty Fine or P Terry's would have been better, in my opinion. My bacon was soggy and not crisp. Pickles were not crisp and fresh and lettuce was wilted. Fries or nothing to write home about. Just frozen Ore-Ida curly fries deep fried.\\n\\n2. Although the staff were friendly and efficient, I felt they lacked the ambition to keep the place clean. There were four people in the kitchen and two on the register. One of the people in the kitchen could have came out and cleaned the tables because the restaurant was not busy at all. When we walked out, all the tables were dirty and the floors were full of trash. If the restaurant in the front is not clean I don't want to think about what the back at the restaurant and kitchen looks like.\\n\\n3.

The drinks are unbelievable and the food will make you come back for more. I had escargot, rack of lamb... And I can't forget to mention the dinner rolls... They were cheesy buttery muffins that are worth the price of admission alone.  Every person who work there from the bartender to the ma√Ætre d' to the waiter... Were top notch.

I Love Sushi was originally located in Conyers, but moved to Smyrna when the Umezono owner decided to sell his restaurant (and the Tomato Japanese Grocery Store next door) and move back to Japan. Umezono had just finished celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2013. Note: I Love Sushi has no relation to the I Luv Pho restaurants.\\n\\nThe new sushi chef and owner is Tommy. He brought over his own hand-carved wooden fish and other artwork from the Conyers restaurant. Giant fish now decorate the storefront. Inside, these interesting fish carvings hang from the ceiling. There are fresh coats of sky blue paint on the walls and behind the sushi bar, there are carvings of Tommy-san's face with various facial expressions wearing assorted color \\"I Love Sushi\\" T-shirts. It's... unique and somewhat gaudy. He's definitely made his mark on the space, complete with new signage both on the storefront and out on Cobb Parkway.\\n\\nBright paint and wooden carvings aside, the rest of the restaurant harkens back to the days of Umezono, the low key, conventional Japanese restaurant. The seating layout remains the same. There are traditional private rooms in the back where groups can sit on the floor. Reservations are recommended for those rooms.\\n\\nI Love Sushi's menu is mostly the same as Umezono's (and sister restaurant Sushi Yoko in Norcross), to my surprise. The menu cover has changed, but the inside appears to be the same, even down to the font. I found this to be a relief because I thought Umezono provided a nice, casual, all-around authentic Japanese dining experience at a reasonable cost (same with Yoko). With a name like \\"I Love Sushi,\\" I was concerned the menu would be drastically different. Instead, it turns out Tommy has inherited the menu and added extra items and specials.\\n\\nOne of my favorite items to order at Umezono, which is still on the menu at I Love Sushi, is the Shabu-Shabu Japanese hot pot. Together with Sukiyaki, these are fun and tasty dishes which you can cook yourself using stoves and pots at the table. These cost $18.85 per person with a minimum order of two. It consists of thinly sliced beef, tofu cubes, various vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, and enoki mushrooms, and special sauces/broths. I wrote about these more extensively in my last review update for Umezono, which was posted shortly after the restaurant switched hands. Most of the information on the Shabu-Shabu and Sukiyaki dishes, which can be found here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/umezono-japanese-restaurant-smyrna?hrid=EVBZjxE5jTIt2q6joCMqDQ, is still applicable.\\n\\nSushi-wise, my favorite item to order is the Sushi Jou ($19.50). Sushi Jou is a dish I've ordered at Umezono and Sushi Yoko several times over about the last 15 years. It consists of 11 pieces of chef's choice nigiri sushi and one roll. I've tried Tommy-san's version and am happy to report the fish is still fresh and delicious. The Chirashi Sushi ($15.95, assorted sashimi over sushi rice) is also a good choice.\\n\\nTommy has actually gone on fishing trips and personally served the fish he's caught. One difference I've noticed since the ownership change is the sushi Tommy prepares isn't as compact nor as neat as the previous chefs. He also likes to use a bit more wasabi in his nigiri, which I like. Outside of the most basic nigiri sushi such as maguro (tuna) and sake (salmon), examples of nigiri I've seen Tommy select me include hokkigai (surf clam), toro (fatty tuna), hamachi (amberjack/yellowtail), bincho maguro (albacore tuna), ika (squid), saba or aji (mackerel), and tai (snapper). He also carries harder-to-find sushi on his menu such as uni (sea urchin). Check these beauties out: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i-love-sushi-marietta?select=FFkKm0wPdqJfIQ5rBVzGaA#FFkKm0wPdqJfIQ5rBVzGaA.\\n\\nI think the name of the restaurant could mislead people into thinking sushi is primarily the only food served. However, I Love Sushi serves way more than that including fried foods like Ton Katsu (fried pork cutlet - recommended) and Chicken Kara-Age (fried chicken), assorted tempuras, nuta (izakaya-style dishes prepared with green onion and miso sauce), Japanese curry (not bad), yamakake (dishes prepared with sticky Japanese yam), appetizers from Niku Jaga (meat and potatoes) to Shiokara (salted raw squid), grilled fish (including kama, fish cheeks, like yellowtail and salmon), yakitori skewers and grilled foods, cooked fish, sunomono cucumber and vinegar salads, several tofu dishes (e.g. agedashi tofu), natto (fermented soy bean dishes), daikon oroshi (grated daikon with various foods), teriyaki, donburi rice bowls, chazuke rice soups, onigiri rice balls, and noodles such as udon, ramen, soba, and yakisoba. On top of that, they've got a decent sake selection too.\\n\\nI don't think you'll find a more extensive Japanese menu in Cobb County.\\n\\nService is A-OK."},{"name":"Davenport's Ale House","address":"1260 Posner Blvd","city":"Davenport","stars":"2","text":"Fantastic service !

Had I, I probably would have left. I am very tired of this idea that customers need to tip for service that has not yet been received or forced to when service is not worthy. This is a trend that is happening and I for one, do not like it. I have always been very generous to servers that offer great service and usually forgiving of those who try hard and might not be that good.\\n\\nWe ordered the food and waited quite a long time to be served when the restaurant was not all that busy. While the waitress was very nice we had to wait a very long time and finally asked for water when the bottle was empty and she did not really check in on us. Also when my 8 year old ordered his waffles, she never asked whether he wanted milk, orange juice or apple juice. Afterwards he told me he never got his drink which he told me was supposed to come with his meal (which I did not know when he ordered). That is something the server should absolutely have known and asked. The food is ok (not great) and certainly not worth the price even without the 20% surcharge.\\n\\nGigi's policy takes away incentive for staff to go the \\"extra mile\\". Also 20% is not a normal tip, it represents recognition for excellent service and an excellent experience which today's was not.

We had been out boating on Boston Harbor and pulled up to the dock to have a birthday lunch at the Reelhouse for my brother-in-law's birthday.  I separated from my party once seated to ask the hostess if a single dessert could be brought after lunch to our table.  I knew that their lunch menu did not include dessert options but she said she would check with the chef and then came out and said yes, they would bring a piece of cheesecake to our table with the candle I had brought along.  She then asked me to point out which man was the 'birthday boy'.  So helpful and accommodating!  Our lunch was delicious- my husband and I split a summery avocado, cucumber, tomato, artichoke, bib lettuce salad with grapefruit vinaigrette- so refreshing and light.  I enjoyed my lobster roll which came with a toasted bun and lightly dressed chunks of lobster with a hint of lemon- so good!  My husband loved the fresh poke entree and the other couple enjoyed their ceasar salads and burgers.  Our server David could not have been nicer or more efficient!  He managed to override my brother-in-law's covert attempt to pay the bill and signal to me that he had used our card as we requested (all without our guests knowing!)  David was funny AND smooth and we so appreciated his help pulling off the dessert surprise for us. He is an asset to your establishment.  Lunch was a great time and we will definitely return!

So why would they not tell us their tables don't seat 10 when we made the reservation? Or that you can't put tables together to accommodate your whole party? Or that you can't pull chairs from empty tables to yours? So basically they'll take your reservation and get you in the door, but can't accommodate a large party unless you sit at two separate tables/couch areas? Needless to say, it was a cluster for the first 15 minutes we were there. No joke.

They need to find a better version of cheap wine if their going offer bottomless.  Bottomless doesn't mean go to Family Dollar and purchase the cheapest wine possible and put some Great Value juice in it.

Bartender quality, food quality, ambiance/atmosphere and an overall experience towards excellence.  I remember going to Lure when it first opened up.  I'm the kind of guy that will follow good bartenders to their new spots.  I've always been an Ecco guy, but Lure has pulled even with Ecco in the past few months.  They have the best bartender in Atlanta in my opinion.  Brent, I'm looking at you.  However, they've improved the food quality in the past year.  \\n\\nWhen I go to restaurants, I always initially sit at the bar.  I've found in my culinary adventures, that the bar staff always has a better grasp on the menu, wine list, and personality of the patrons they serve.  This is no different at Lure.  The bar is a perfect area for interaction with fellow guests, Brent is no different than his Ecco days where he was a master purveyor of cocktails and conversation.  It's truly the perfect area to truly gain an understanding of the true personality of a restaurant in my opinion.  \\n\\nMy last few visits to Lure have given me newfound respect for the restaurant.  I really like the mix of wines and bubbly.  At lunch, the best Cauliflower Soup in Atlanta is on the menu.  It's so finely pureed that it almost seems like they've extracted a cream directly out of the Cauliflower.  The Octopus and Pork Lettuce wraps are delicious.  Add a few drops of the sauce on the side and it's genuinely awesome.  Other areas that I've noticed improvement are the Yellowfin Tuna Crudo and the Scallops.  The Butternut Squash puree with Scallops adds an element of making the dish a great sweet/savory combo in my opinion.  There are many more dishes, but I don't think anyone wants to read a term paper.  \\n\\nAll in all, Lure has definitely gotten better and it was already very good in the first place.  Fifth Group now has 4 flag ships instead of just 1 or 2 like they had 4-5 years ago.  Make sure to go on a Friday night when it's particular vibrant inside."},{"name":"Stauf's Coffee Roasters","address":"1277 Grandview Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I've been going to Stauf's since the 90's, before coffee became the big celebrated wonderful experience it is today. While no longer living in the area, my family does, so, when I go visit, I like to get some coffee beans, since I've also become addicted to fresh coffee ground and brewed at home. I was hesitant this last time, because, I realized no bins have \\"roast dates\\" on them.. something I've become a bit of a snob about in recent years, it has to be FRESH... and was assured that they were all \\"fresh\\".. nonetheless, I wanted something very fresh, so they were roasting in the morning, while I was there perusing the internet, so I was supposed to get some \\"hot out of the oven\\" beans.. While I sat, apparently they roasted the beans, I paid my $19 for the pound. I will say, they didn't smell fresh, or warm, or like anything. And, after letting them sit for a few days as recommended, I made a cup, and it was stale coffee. $20 that I will throw away, it's that bad. So, while I love the ambiance of Stauf's, I need guaranteed fresh beans to be happy.

He was lost and showed up very late (I hope he will get to read my this review, hehe..) and yes I told him if this is a date, I would have been long gone ;( \\n\\nI know, this is not a place to write about short stories yet I think the above adds to why I chose Atmosphere, why I tend to frequent French restaurants more, etc..\\n\\nSo finally, time to focus just on my dining experience at Atmosphere. \\n\\nFOOD 4/5\\n\\nCroque Monsieur 4/5\\nI ordered Croque Monsieur. It was very good, but I definitely had better elsewhere. It was a simple safe dish though in recent times i realize simple safe dish can still be messed up. I wish I can order from the lunch menu which is only available on Tuesdays to Fridays. I wanted to order Truite Amandine next time. \\n\\nCr√®me Br√ªl√©e 4/5\\nIt was almost a 5/5 perfect cr√®me br√ªl√©e except that I found the cr√®me br√ªl√©e a tiny wee bit dense. It was just a tiny bit but I have to be honest. The award for the best cr√®me br√ªl√©e I had around in Buckhead/midtown still goes to Bistro Niko.\\n\\nNote: my friend ordered the filet benedict and soupe du jour which happened to be tomato basil. He likes his food a lot especially the soup. He mentioned there was this garlicky taste in his Benedict which was a tad overpowering but he still like the food. Coffee was good. \\n\\nAMBIENCE 5/5\\nLove the ambience. Love the background music. The patio seatings are lovely and perfect for beautiful days like today. \\n\\nSERVICE 5/5\\n5 stars service. They were patient, attentive and checked on us a few times. They made us feel welcomed and made good recommendations. \\n\\n*** NOTE : Their House-made French fries are fried in peanut oil. Something people with peanut allergy should take note.\\n\\nGlad we got to try out Atmosphere and this would add on to our list of lunch/brunch places to go from now on. \\n\\nHere's wishing my friend Moustafa an early Happy Birthday!!

Finally, there was no ramekin of sauce; it was all in with the rice, and was sweeter and less spicy than I like - plus, it was a frighteningly bright red-orange hue. To top it off, the bowl was garnished with spring mix. Several of the leaves were dark and slimy. Whyyyy?

Not that I can do the trencherman thing, because I had gastric bypass surgery last September which has drastically altered my formerly Sumo-esque physique. I just like to sample and taste. The cooked foods are average steam table fare. The miso soup has been subjected to the fusion thing, and contains tiny noodles (?) along with the mandatory scallion rings and tofu cubes. The flavor of miso needs to be ramped up about 25% to make my Tokyo soul sing. The sushi is mass production in grade and execution, not surprising due to the speed at which it's scarfed up off the buffet! Our waiter was very helpful and attentive. The wasabi needs to be a lot more potent for my palate- I never got that good incendiary flush even once. I don't have any dislikes for any thing here.

On Friday/weekends, long wait times (30-40min) as the interior is very small. However, food service is very fast as there are usually 5-6 people in the kitchen/food preparation area. At the price point, the quantity of sushi or quality should be at a point to justify it ... but it really does not do so. If you come here you should expect to pay a lot and really splurge out. When I saw the menu prices, I was expecting much more fish and a higher taste experience.\\n\\nReally wish I could give the sushi quality a 3/5... mainly because most of the fish we got (while soft) was just too awkwardly warm for my liking. \\n\\nThe atmosphere itself is very nice, dark and stylish. Selection of drinks was very impressive, many types of sakes were available. Selection of sushi and rolls was also very impressive. Sashimi and nigiri are expensive here, with the lowest being at $3 per single piece. \\n\\nIt all really depends on what your order as to how the experience goes. I think that given the wide selection of \\"fatty\\" sushi variants and selection, Musashino prides itself in the variety you can order. That being said, you aren't getting the full experience if you don't order a wide variety of fish, which equals a higher cost in the end. \\n\\nThe food isn't bad at all, it's quite fresh. But the price pains you after you eat and then realize you haven't been satisfied at all and you need to order MORE to just feel somewhat full. \\n\\nI came here as a party of 3 for a casual dinner night with friends on Saturday. We called a few times throughout the day asking about wait times, but no matter when we called, it seemed like there would be a 30-40 minute wait. Not really an issue, but they also don't take reservations unless it's a group of 4 or more. Given the small interior space they have, perhaps they should either revise their reservation approach or relocate to a larger venue, unless the intent is to garner a \\"it's so good you have to wait\\" kind of vibe. Many groups smaller than 2 were present that night... so it seems like a reservation system would benefit them.\\n\\nWe had a sashimi sampler, designed for \\"groups of 2 or more\\" which was only 20 pieces for $65. While the selection of fish was great, it really was just overall underwhelming for the price (plus we all were still hungry afterwards). We had to order 2 traditional (essentially, \\"simple\\" rolls) as well, which were about 70% rice and 10% fish, with the remaining 20% as vegetable. I would have preferred more fish in the rolls."},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The atmosphere is Terrific.

Everyone in the cafe was working on laptops or reading; the taproom had not yet opened, and my understanding was that the space was still functioning primarily as a cafe. But the music was LOUD to the point of being deafening (not to mention the fact that the playlist was exclusively outdated indie rock from the mid-2000s). My three companions and I all had our headphones on at full volume, and none of us could hear our bar prep course lectures because of Pepita's music. I politely asked one of the baristas if it was possible to turn the music down. She responded very condescendingly, \\"I mean, we keep it at the volume we want it.\\" Her attitude persisted, and after our interaction ended, I could see her and other baristas talking about me with outraged expressions on their faces. I did not think my request was unreasonable, and in fact I was only inquiring as to whether it was possible to turn the music down, not demanding that it be turned down.\\n\\nWe all left immediately and won't be returning. It is not a welcoming study space. In addition, I don't appreciate being condescended to or spoken to in the way that the staff treated me.

One bite and the same disgusting SOAP or SANITIZER flavor rendering them inedible and a promise to remove one of the dishes from the bill.  There's also a couple of questions here about them 'not changing the oil in a while' and why the heck are they deep-frying breakfast potatoes???\\nAnyway, we finished the eggs, bacon, and pancakes all of which were served COLD and cooked to a near rubber texture also rendering them absolutely tasteless.  \\nThen requested our bill two times before that finally showed up and a simple request for a bit more water.

You cannot go in off of Windy Hill Rd so you are left with a hard-to-identify driveway off of Cobb Pkwy.  Add to that, they are building on Cobb Pkwy so there is only one lane of traffic for everyone.

It was on Magical Dining so we figured this was a good opportunity. We had a late reservation, & arrived on time. The hostess staff was friendly & they greeted us promptly. We waited about 10 minutes and were seated. \\n\\nWe were approached by our waiter who never introduced himself. He quickly approached us, put water glasses down & asked if we wanted drinks. We ordered a glass of wine, & my husband just wanted water to start. I'm pretty sure I saw him roll his eyes. Maybe it was just me. Anyway, he came back with bread & said he'd return with the wine. When he returned we ordered - off the MD menu. Again, he seemed annoyed. He took our orders very abruptly, snatched the menus & left us in a hurry. At this point we were thinking maybe he's just having a bad night or something, but I didn't want it to ruin our dinner. A few minutes later he returned with our lobster bisque - and I'm not kidding, I don't think he waited for the bowls to be fully secured on the table before he released them. It honestly felt as if they were tossed in front of us. And, the best part, not a single word. He just dropped them & walked away. I was starting to get upset & uncomfortable at this point. We were noticing that he was friendly & smiling at neighboring tables, so I'm not sure how we ended up on his bad side. A bit of redemption: the soup, although a bit on the salty side, was A-MAZING. We think it might have been the best we've had, and it's a favorite of ours. Next our entrees arrive, and I was almost relieved that they were brought by another server. Our server returned & asked if I wanted another wine, I wasn't finished so I said, \\"not just yet thank you\\" and without another word he turned & walked the other way. As he was walking by another time and I reluctantly called him over & asked for more bread. He snidely replied that he'd have to see if they had any more because they might be out. I'm pretty sure my jaw was hanging open at this point. I just had to keep ignoring the fact that he was so unpleasant or it was going to ruin my night. We ordered the filets & they were cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and tasted heavenly! The potatoes were very good, but the side of Brussels sprouts were charred on the outside, but undercooked - and we like crispy veggies but these were close to raw on the inside. The bacon & onions were almost undetectable, & the dish lacked seasoning. The desserts were good, & generously sized - we had cheesecake & chocolate mousse. \\n\\nOverall, the bisque & steak were enough to save our visit from being a total disaster. I mean seriously, the food was mostly wonderful, but the absolutely rude service (by our server, other employees/servers seemed great) is inexcusable. I do recall seeing a single smile from our server - when he delivered the bill. My husband was very kind to leave a tip appropriate to our bill amount instead of according to the \\"service\\" we received. I can't help but believe the treatment we received was because we were ordering off the MD menu. If the restaurant/servers don't want to participate in MD then they should just not.

No more bread ever arrived at our table. A completely different (and wonderful) server took our order and got us drinks immediately. He was the ONLY positive experience we had. The checks came and we were over charged, explained to the server, he came back with \\"different\\" checks that were just in a different order, not fixed at all.

I personally disagree with some of the menu changes they've made. And they are one of those places that is not worth the price if you don't hit happy hour. DO try the posole. I noticed that after Santo moved into the area, Centro's menu went a little more New Mexican and they also do posole.

The bagel was delicious, as always.  The hash browns are super greasy, but I can forgive them for that.  The omelet is just...not my fave.  They cook the egg really thin, and then wrap it around the cheese, kinda like a burrito.  I guess this is a real way to make an omelet, I just don't care for it.  Everything is pretty bland, but I guess that's my fault since it's just eggs and cheese. I needed generous sprinkles of salt and pepper to get the eggs in my gullet.\\n\\nMy husband ordered a reuben with potato salad.  When the plate was set down, I said, \\"Damn, that potato salad is WHITE.\\"  It looked to be just potatoes and mayo.  No veggies, no pepper, just a cup o' white.

First -- the good news -- they do order \\"wait list seating\\" which is similar to the call-ahead seating used by other restaurants. For anyone who has dined at any of the Polaris Parkway restaurants on a Friday or Saturday night can tell you -- wait list seating is a big plus.\\n\\nOur most recent visit was on a Saturday night and it was a disappointing experience.  My wife and I both ordered salads - mine was a tomato / mozzaella salad and my wife's was a \\"house salad.  Mine was fine but her salad was served without ANY dressing.  When we called this to the waitresses' attention, she was very apologetic and immediately headed back for the dressing.  It was at least 5 minutes before the dressing was served.  Then, we both ordered burgers,  I requested mine to be cooked medium (my default for burgers and ground beef); my wife asked for hers be be medium well (NO PINK in the center).  Well -- my burger was closer to medium well but was still acceptable to me but my wife's burger was definitely medium RARE as opposed to medium WELL - nice an pink and juicy in the middle.  AGAIN, the waitress was very apologetic and she took my wife's burger back to the kitchen.  She stopped at the table 2 or 3 times to tell us that the burger would be \\"RIGHT OUT\\" but -- in reality - it took well over 10 minutes for my wife to get a new burger -- while my burger got cold.\\n\\nFinally - when we thought we had seen everything -- we got our check and discovered that we had been DOUBLE-CHARGED for my wife's burger. AGAIN - MORE APOLOGIES - and a revised check.\\n\\nOverall -- the food was excellent (once we get what we ordered).  The waitress was very professional, very polished and pleasant and -- in normal circumstances - I would have said she was an excellent waitress.

It is not so much for the overall impression of Frank's but for the absolutely mental animal chunks that my One and I received. I happened upon a PIC of a three-pound Tomahawk steak posted outside Frank's while strolling by a few nights ago. \\n\\nThis big 'un was 69 bucks and came with choice of two sides: mashed, fries, salad, veggie, rice, etc. We each got salads which were \\"the usual\\" blue-collar type with heaps of dressing and premade and chilled and kinda teenie but tasty. We got fries and mashed which were piping hot and fresh. We each ordered our own Tomahawks. No sharing on this. We wanted steaks that each could call \\"my-yin.\\"\\n\\nWe waited some time for our animal chunks to arrive. And when they arrived it was as though Jesus had appeared. The flesh illuminated the spirits and opened up the skies of salivation.\\n\\nThese huge Tomahawks were Fred Flintstone material, bro. Sizzling with extreme yumskiness, the charred fat made for a feast that was nearly dream-like. The quality and taste was straight up mental AF and it was as though the animal was ripped apart just moments ago with all the sinewy juice and adipose going off wicked big time. Mind you, we ate these with no salt n' pepa or nothing. I strongly suggest ordering these Tomahawks and forgoing the delicate/girlie teenie 14-oz steaks. My only regret was not eating these phat bastards entirely as the leftovers will lose some quality in the home reheat process. \\n\\nThe service was OK with a friendly waitress who didn't seem to mind letting us going thirsty by never once filling our long-gone waters despite the fact that water was our only bev with the meal. \\n\\nFrank's is a landmark old-school joint. The entrance wall boasts clientele PICs of lots of great people but they also had a PIC of Elizabeth Warren. This was complete with fist-punched smashed glass. Kudos to whoever did this public service. Other PICS included the likes of the great Tony V, Steven Wright, Van Halen band (with Gary Cherone) and many sports stars.\\n \\nLong live Frank and his peeps! Order the Tomahawk steak ASAP. I'm quite sure the Tomahawk is the personal favorite of true Native American, Elizabeth \\"Pocahontas\\" Warren. \\n\\nSee you later, YELPers and non-vegans.\\n\\nBONUS: This Tomahawk was short money.

Better yet, the salmon was delish and the pasta had a tasty sauce. \\n\\nMy friend ordered a salad.  When it arrived with tomatoes we all freaked because of the recent Salmonella scare but the waiter made no bones about taking it back.

We ordered a decent amount, and we thoroughly enjoyed the food, but the slices of meat per plate were really thin and mostly insubstantial, which meant that though we ordered about 6 plates, along with plentiful other veggies, noodles, and dessert, we were still not satisfied. After we split the bill, it came out to about $28/person, and 2 of the party usually eat like birds, so I think it's saying a lot when they weren't full either. \\n\\nHowever, I've found out that they have introduced the All You Can Eat option at $21.95/person and it alleviates many of the problems we had, though the AYCE menu is a bit more limited and sauces are still extra. \\n\\nAll in all, the experience was authentic and enjoyable and the restaurant was clean. The service was nice since they explain everything to you if you've never had hotpot before and the soup is refillable so it never runs too low, which was super nice, since the soup is actually pretty amazing. \\n \\nIt's not great for groups bigger than 4-6 people, but awesome otherwise.

In summary, food was good, but service / operations was terrible.\\n\\nWe arrived around 11 and there was a long line, out the inner door but not yet out the front door. I wasn't too surprised there was a wait but there didn't see to be much order to the line. In addition to the line that was now forming into the main entrance way, there was a waiting area with seats people were at. Technically signs at the counter in front of that area said it was for take-out only but people were definitely waiting there and then merging into this main line. The whole problem could have easily been solved if there was someone taking names / giving out numbers. But nothing, people just stood there confused until finally a hostess came down the line and asked for parties that could fit into a 4-person booth, we raised our hands and off we went (about 20-30 min after we arrived).\\n\\nOnce we sat down, the waitress came pretty quickly to get our drink orders but then it was pretty downhill from there. I understand it was lunch time during Sunday but I guess I expect places to expect well-established restaurants to know how to handle peak time traffic. It wasn't clear if the waitresses had assigned tables or they helped each other cover an area. Refills were few and far between and because they weren't done by the same person, it wasn't always coordinated.\\n\\nWe waited for about 15 min before she came back for the order and then after the order was put in, it was a good 30-40 min before the food came. Breakfast food shouldn't take that long. Or at least, bring us some rolls & biscuits so we're not just sitting there waiting forever, running out of drinks, wondering what's taking so long. Our waitress did come by a couple of times while we were waiting and said \\"yea, we're just waiting for the food\\" in an almost exasperated way like this happens a lot?? Very strange experience for a place like this that really should be moving people through much faster.\\n\\nThe only redeeming quality to this place was that the food in fact was good. My husband got the country fried steak platter, I got the country fried chicken platter and my sister got the french toast. The country fried steak was much better than the country fried chicken (which was a little dry). We all agreed the biscuits were GREAT, and very solid grits. My sister liked her french toast ok (it was good but I think standard). Or maybe we were so hungry after waiting forever, we were judging on whether this place was worth coming back to.\\n\\nMy husband has high standards when it comes to southern food and found this place to be very solid. But we all agree, probably not worth the wait and highly inefficient service. This is the kind of place the consultant in me wishes I could do an operational efficiency project with them b/c I bet there are some easy ways to really help them improve and if they were just faster/more efficient, with food they serve, they could really kill it. In the meantime, for us, maybe one weekend if we get up super early or possibly we'll do take-out if we are craving this food badly. Until then, we'll keep looking in the area for similar places that serve tasty breakfast but hopefully with better service."},{"name":"Maekha Thai","address":"163 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"So I wrote my review right when this business opened and gave it a 5 stars. This is the only place we have returned after using a Groupon because we loved the food, service and owner so much. I've brought my parents, grandparents and boyfriend here plenty of times.\\n\\nBut today, the service that we received from our waitress was passive aggressive, rude, and just made our experience (esp me, since I was the one who told my friends we should come here to eat) intense. When she cleared our appetizer plates, she didn't remove the forks from the plate so there was a noise that was made. When we tried ordering thai iced tea, she told us to hold on in a rude tone. When she finally came back to take our drink orders, we said thai iced tea and thai tea, so she got an attitude and frustrated when after some of my peers looked confused. She sounded annoyed by our group, which I was confused about since we were all very friendly and her reponse was \\"Thai tea comes hot or cold, which one do you want?\\" in a demanding and again, annoyed way. She also didn't check up on us throughout our entire meal.\\n\\nWhen she asked us if we wanted dessert, we said no but as soon as the check came, one of my peers mentioned that we might want mango with sticky rice. As soon as she said that, the waitress' eyes rolled and she looked very annoyed. We didn't end up getting it b/c it was out of season but SHEESH, why the poor customer experience.\\n\\nI think positive attitude and tone goes a longgggg way, but she clearly didn't care about how we felt and took out her anger on us in a passive agressive manner.\\n\\nThe owner asked us if everything was okay, which was nice, but we didn't want to cause a scene calling his waitress out. \\n\\nFood as always is on point. I ordered the Prik Khing (sp?) which was not as good as usually, but everything else did not disappoint.

They also serve a full menu of Hawaiian themed food, with plenty of vegan options. The decor is impeccable, packed with colorful nautical features, vintage carvings, and even a water feature. The large bar is sunken into the ground, so you are eye level with your bartender, which was a unique touch. Behind the bar is an incredible rum selection, beautiful tiki sculptures, and some really talented bartenders. \\n\\nSierra is a seriously talented bartender. The menu is separated into categories that make it easy to pick your poison-'Tropical', 'Coconut', 'Seriously Strong', etc. My first drink was the classic Jet Pilot, a dangerously strong blend of aged rums, cinnamon, lime, and falernum. Served on fire, it was just as fun to drink as it was delicious. I also tried the Leilani Volcano, which was my favorite. Sweet guava and creamy coconut created a silky smooth treat that ranks amongst the best tiki drinks I have ever enjoyed. My boyfriend got a non-alcoholic Pina Colada that tasted fresh and delicious, so do not hesitate to bring your non-drinking friends here.\\n\\nThe food was very good, which is a rarity at most tiki bars. The Hawaiian Bread was fantastic-sweet and fluffy slices of sugared fresh bread, served with guava jam. The Basil Fried Rice with Kimchi was also very good, and a large portion for $7. Nice salty and tangy flavors that complimented the rum based beverages very nicely. The only lemon of the entire experience were the overcooked and flavorless Drunken Noodles, but everything else was so good that we did not mind.

If you can eat mala style, this is for you. It's made from a dark, savory soy sauce, and 20-30hrs of boiling beef tendons and fat melt to a molecular level. Beef oil finishing on top giving it a lavish, deep beefy smell and flavor. If the thought of numbing Sichuan chilly pepper makes your mouth water as much as mine, and you're a seasoned spicy eater, you can still taste the depth and richness of the wonderful broth this ramen has to offer. I up'ed my review one star just cause of this dish. It's quite nice to have something experimental that succeed on so many levels, it goes to show that Jimmy (the owner), his chefs, are passionate in the art of cooking, and are always innovating and pushing the frontiers of great flavors that nevertheless stayed true to the ramen tradition. Bravo.\\n\\n\\nOriginal Review:\\nI enjoy good ramen, and have had many ramen throughout Boston. This review is just about the ramen, not the shabu.\\n\\nI come here at least once a week for lunch, my business is nearby. \\n\\nYou get to choose a thicker version of the noodle, or what the chef decided for the default version- a thin, almost angle hair interpretation of the ramen. While I am not sure the reason behind this decision, if you enjoy traditional, chewiness in your noodle, ask for the original, thicker version. But even so, the difference is not very noticeable.\\n\\nI don't like bringing up competitor names in my reviews, however, Santouka and Ippudo have got the texture of the ramen noodle down. And this, you will find lacking at Shabu&M.\\n\\nNevertheless, the other ingredients more than make up for it. If you're hungry, or a fan of pork, get the Crazy ramen that's been on the blackboard \\"special\\" for the past year or so. This will give you at least 4 times the meat you'd get had you visited the Japanese chain mentioned earlier. The pork comes in a couple different varieties too, cha shao and braised. It's hard to tell how fresh they are when served with noodles, but hell, they taste great every time. \\n\\nTheir broth is not bad. I say \\"not bad\\" because it depends on the day of the week. Unlike the aforementioned chain, which has a consistent line of stewing broth for days, Shabu&M's broth fluctuates. Sometimes you get them after a day of good stewing, sometimes it's right out the boiling pot... They try to cover this with very strong but nevertheless flavorful sesame oil, and pretty decent spicy miso. But you can still taste the differences in consistency. On a good day, a well stewed tonkotsu broth can be delicate and exciting at the same time. But on a bad day, it's just any instant ramen powder soup. Thankfully, it's been well stewed most of the time when I visited. \\n\\nService is okay. Atmosphere is pretty average. The place has two spaces divided by a hallway. The bar side has TV. Nothing special about it.\\n\\nThe price is slightly above average for ramen ($14-18), but still justified by the above average quality. It lacks consistency sometimes. However, the generous pork portions, the whole egg, the usually well balanced broth, and somewhat underwhelming noodle texture, is enough to have me coming back."},{"name":"FuddoYama Ramen","address":"8610 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Oh man, best ramen place I've been to in a long time!

The pork belly was very fatty, and the sliced bbq pork plus bamboo shoots was given sparingly (I didn't even have a whole piece but small fragments). It seemed that the toppings were placed in the bowl first then the broth as some were at the very bottom. I did enjoy the sesame seeds and ginger it came with for extra flavor in the broth.

The fifteen year old boy-manager heard our complaint and offered nothing.  The restaurant manager, Jessica, via an email interchange and phonecall, voluntarily comped our appetizers for our troubles.\\nThe maitre d' situation at Cactus has a consistent issue--standing on one's feet and the first line of defense for hungry tourists makes for an angry greeting?--since another maitre d' was mutedly snarky to us and to the people in front of us, when we sweetly claimed our reservation, today, which our hotel (The Four Seasons) had made for us.  She didn't soften when I asked for Jessica, the manager, in order to thank her in person for compensating us for our pain, the previous visit.  Maybe because it's the siesta hour, blood sugar is low and annoyance high?  Maybe, it's having to stand at the little podium, like a motivational speaker without a seated, rapt audience?  By the time the maitre d' reseated us at a lovely harbor- and sea-plane facing booth (which had been our initial request), I had gentled and coaxed her into a sense of humor and increased warmth.\\nLike the first time, the food was pretty impeccable, again, save for the (stale) tortilla chips, which accompanied the successful twist on conventional guacamole--the Chimichurri Guacamole.  Our skilled and warm waitress, Emily, offered us the rice wonton chips reserved for another appetizer, which was the perfect resolution.  Note to chef, who gets it right 99% of the time: lose the tortilla chips (the couple at the table to the right of us, next to the window, overheard us and told us that their chips tasted stale, too).  They weren't as demanding as we are, so they suffered in silence, citing that the view was so lovely that they didn't care.  They did, however, accept a rice cracker, looked around as though the chef might be watching, and took a quick swipe at their guacamole with it.  Their subdued kitty squeal told me that the chef really needs to rethink the tortilla chips! \\nThe truffle fries were ideally crisp, on the outside, and served hot, despite the overburden of our wonderful waitress, Emily, ministering to what looked like the whole restaurant and scampering over both levels of the place, like a squirrel engaged in the rituals of nut-gathering.  She was everywhere, at once, and doing her job with aplomb and a genuine smile and warmth.\\nWhile we had ordered and eaten a Henry VIIIth banquet quantity of food, during our first visit, with husband, son, and his girlfriend, my girlfriend and I could barely make room for the third and fourth appetizer, the ceviche and kale and chicken salad, SANS chicken, which the restaurant thoughtfully had a price provision for.  Nice not to have to argue that a salad minus it's main and most expensive ingredient should be offered at a lower price. The salad was simple and yummy with the nice addition of pickled red onions atop it (we asked for, and received, a few extra).\\nI am not a big fish fan, but what the chef lacks in chip choice, he/she makes up for in crafting the perfect amalgam of ceviche--steelhead and prawns with generous red onions, thai basil, mint, an appropriately-restrained amount of cilantro, and a perfect nuoc cham.  In fact, we would have liked a larger pool of nuoc cham so as to be able to do a face plant in it and slurp until there was nothing left--it was that good with the perfect citrus (and chile?) notes.\\nThe portions, here, are generous, even the reduced size happy hour portions.  It is impressive, as well, that Cactus Club is a fairly large chain and, as such, is doing briliantly at doing a large menu with consistently very good to excellent food.\\nWe had ordered dessert, that wasn't coming after twenty-five minutes of waiting, and my friend had a conference call looming, so we had to get back to the hotel.  We relucantly had to cancel dessert--some marriage of peanut butter with chocolate with vanilla bean (not even lowly and unappealing French vanilla) ice cream--and I walked backward out of the restaurant in case it appeared in a to-go container with two spoons.\\nCLASS ACT ALERT!\\nWhen we asked for the check, we were told by the floor (?) manager that they were taking care of the check.  I explained that Jessica had already compensated us for the unfortunate experince the previous time, but the manager was insistent.  It wasn't a large bill--no alochol and largely happy hour prices--but, still, this restaurant takes its commitment to customer service and consistently delicious food, seriously. \\nNext time, I need to appear incognito so as to pay my way.\\nThank you, Jessica, Emily, et al.

When I inquired if this was because the register wouldn't allow it or if it was just a rule, the cashier told me that indeed yes, the register WOULD allow it, but that it wasn't good business because of the transaction charge they would get for swiping my card (if I am correct, this charge is a mere .35-.55 CENTS).

The hard part to understand is that several items in the menu are under $5 and in the current times, many people don't carry cash with them anymore.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this one star yelp review will probably be worth more than the .35cent charge they would have gotten.

Dust flew all over the table and into our waters.\\n\\nGross. \\n\\nWe placed our drink orders- my friend ordered the chai tea. He huffed and said \\"well, I was going to bring you all free samples of it...\\" ok, she says- I'll wait then, and order it after if I like the sample. \\nThe chai was delicious, by the way, but he never brought her that full order she asked for, even after reminding him. \\nHe refused ANY substitutions on the meals, ok,\\nFine... all my friend wanted was some avocado on her burger, without having to order the giant platter that comes with multiple sides... apparently that was too difficult a request. \\n\\nMeals were slow to arrive but wonderful when they did. Unfortunately we couldn't enjoy our meals as he refused to stop eavesdropping and hovering over our table as we ate. He interjected into our conversation so many times that we had to ask him to stop. From across the restaurant he said \\"I'm not eavesdropping I just overheard...\\" and would run over to add his opinion. \\nit was bizarre. Absolutely bizarre. \\nThe weirdest part of the meal was the end. My friend has had surgery which affects the amount of food she can eat. He asked if she wanted her leftovers wrapped up (maybe 10 small potatoes were left. Not worthy of a to-go box) and she insisted she didn't as she didn't think they would re-warm well. He demanded she take them, as \\"his owner doesn't like people to waste food.\\" And got MAJOR attitude when she declined... insisted they would in fact re-warm in an oven, but they don't \\"believe in microwaves\\" I couldn't stop rolling my eyes at that point.\\nWhile that very well may be the case, it's none of his damn business. We paid for it, surely we can decide how much of it to consume. \\n\\nHis pushy, holier than thou, eavesdropping, inappropriate, man-splaining commentary absolutely ruined the meal for all four of us.

I feel a bit bad giving a bad review as the staff were very nice and accommodating, but at the same time what we had was just really, really bad Mexican food.\\n\\nWe were staying at the Chautauqua not too far away and decided to walk down to Pearl St. for dinner.   After a pretty short wait on a Friday evening we were seated.   I ordered a margarita, my wife ordered some wine, and we got chips & salsa and some bass ceviche for appetizers.\\n\\nThen we started noticing the food on other people's tables.   I'm not entirely sure that the Colorado idea of Mexican food as the same as the Southern California one, but nothing looked...good.   Our chips and salsa showed up and the chips were like unsalted Tostitos, while the salsa was basically just tomato sauce.   Then the ceviche showed up.   I love bass, and this was just foul.   Somehow way too much citrus while the fish didn't \\"cook\\" enough in the citrus.   Fishy, chewy, and mouth-puckeringly sour.   I love ceviche, and this wasn't ceviche.   This was lemon juice with not-so-great fish.\\n\\nThankfully my wife had the good idea to not order entrees until we had the appetizers.   We asked for the check at that point, and to their credit, the restaurant tried to make amends.   The manager asked for feedback for the kitchen, which we gave, though admittedly the answer that \\"yeah, there's nothing spicy in the salsa\\" wasn't a great answer to \\"your salsa doesn't have any heat at all\\".   It was honest though, and I appreciate that.\\n\\nThey ended up taking our appetizers off the bill and just charging us for drinks, which was very kind of them.   The manager deserves credit, but I'm sad that he was the best part of the experience there.   On the positive side, the margarita was fantastic - not syrupy, not too sweet, just the right amount of sour.   Would absolutely go back for margaritas, as long as I had plans to eat somewhere else.\\n\\nMy view may be skewed by the Mexican food I've had.   Grew up on San Diego taco shops and then on to Los Angeles.   I like spicy.   I saw Cochinita Pibil on the menu and got all excited until the appetizers told me that it wouldn't be what I was hoping for, what I've had, what I've made.\\n\\nThat said, a Lyft driver later in our trip bemoaned the fact that, according to her, there is \\"no good Mexican food in Colorado.\\"   I'm not sure if that's true, but so far, the evidence is in her favor."},{"name":"Coming Home Cafe","address":"753 6th Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"4","text":"Came here today with my significant other.

It's just inside the perimeter, in downtown Vinings. \\n\\n They have parking in the back, in the deck.

It definitely gives a high class feel.\\n\\nTheir bread was interesting. It tasted like a french onion soup. It was interesting. I enjoyed it, but I prefer old-fashioned, traditional rolls too. I wished they had that as well.\\n\\nFor appetizer, we had 12 oysters. They had East coast and West coast oysters. They were both fresh and delicious. It came with the typical assortments of cocktail sauce, horseradish, butter, and hot sauce. \\n\\nFor my main entree, I had the 18 oz, 40 day dry aged, Kansas City Strip Steak. It was cooked perfectly at medium rare. The crust was nice and charred. The flavor was amazing! The dry aged flavor came through very well. My only complaint was the meat seemed hard to cut. I'm not sure if it was because it had a big chunk of fat or because the knife was dull. \\n\\nThey also had specials. The special on the day that I went was a New York strip with Foie Gras butter and caviar. Man that caviar tasted amazing. The Foie Gras was also great. Once again, the steak was cooked well. But combining that steak with the butter and caviar made it taste heavenly. \\n\\nFor the side, I tried their mushrooms. It was a ton of mushrooms cooked in a lot of butter. Like anything cooked with a ton of butter, it was good. \\n\\nTheir sides are gigantic. I saw other tables' sides and couldn't believe how much food they give. They're not shy about their portions. \\n\\nOne of the downside was their service--it was slow. Everything seemed to be snail pace. Maybe they take their time in cooking and preparing everything.

Classic \\"Caccio e Pepe\\" (Cheese and Pepper) and it was quite good.  They used not only pasta water, but also fermented tomato water.  Nice touch.  Was quite amazing.\\n\\nNext was the braised Kobe Beef.  It wasn't anything spectacular - perhaps the same beef shoulder roast you could do in your crock pot.  Slice off a piece, serve with a sweet barbecue sauce, you know - that sort of thing.  The glutenous rice they served with it wasn't sticky - it was more like a sloppy risotto that was half-way seasoned.  Very bland.  Very meh.\\n\\nThe last savory dish I had was the Paneer.  Odd combination of greens, confit eggplant, and meyer lemons.  Was savory and tart, but not very memorable.\\n\\nI also tried their Beef Crudo.  Very good, but was a bit over-sauced.

I would probably get the Apple and Ricotta Tart next time instead.\\n\\nOverall, slightly disappointing, leading to 4 of 5 stars.

Nothing special, nothing lousy, not a place you'd avoid like the plague, but a place that is not one you really look forward to either. \\n\\n2 stars - This is for a place that had something go wrong or something perpetually wrong.

($5 for a coffee and dessert). Then we moved on to the \\"real\\" food but we were so stuffed from that. I got a large chicken rice soup, which was great and filling.\\n\\nWe came back the next day around 10am - we wanted an earlier start because we had a lot of sightseeing to do. Unfortunately, everything but the breakfast station is closed until 11, which is kind of annoying.

The red cabbage  was good but it was not enough to make the dish.\\n\\nSpicy sausage baked with Dijon mustard in a pastry roll tasted like it was bought from a grocery store/Pillsbury dough. I couldn't finish them as the sausage had an off taste to me. \\n\\nSetas al Jerez- tasted like of mushroom soup served with bread.\\n\\nMorcilla con Patatas y Huevo- the sausage had a sweet taste but was was broken down into small crumbled pieces.\\n\\nSalt cod and potato fritters- it needed a sauce to give it flavor.\\n\\nLast tapas dish was from the specials menu, the fried eggplant that had tomato sauce. It was reminded as something we used to eat from our childhood but couldn't quite pin it.\\n\\nOverall, the food was blah and I felt like I was something between hungry and content.

Although there was space on the patio, the slight fall chill and wind sent me inside to the bar.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is bigger and prettier than I expected. This is a good place for groups of 6-8 with the food selection and ability to push tables together.  The bar was spare but sufficiently stocked.  \\n\\nFor a cocktail I had the Look Sharp which is a tequila concoction with rose liquor, bitters, and grapefruit juice.  I really liked it and it packed a punch. \\n\\nI started with the pimento cheese - this appetizer has become a favorite of mine, and I really enjoyed The Imperial's version.  It's a less creamy pimento cheese, and I prefer that.  The serving size is huge - the size of a cup of chili/soup and plenty for two people (see photo!).  I ended up taking more than half of it home.  \\n\\nI ordered a plain burger but added bacon and American cheese.  (Yeah, that's what I did.)  The burger was decent - perfect for the price point and cooked at medium as I requested.  It was still juicy and had a slight char from the grill that I enjoyed.  The tomatoes were fresh and firm, the bacon was crispy, and the cheese was that fake American flavor we all love.  For my side I had the cup 'o salad which was filled with large tears of greens which made it awkward to eat but I was glad they didn't skimp on them.  The portion sizes were great for me - enough to eat and fill full without worrying about being wasteful because I didn't eat the leftovers. \\n\\nService was fine; it wasn't crowded but the person working the bar appeared frazzled at times.  I felt lucky that I wasn't eating during a busier time.   \\n\\nThe Imperial isn't fancy food trying to win you over, but it's solid food with a menu that has something for almost everyone (even vegetarians...not sure about vegans though!)."},{"name":"Cha Cha Cha Taqueria","address":"3135 SW Moody Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Fast, clean, excellent food.

My sushi rolls were more avocado than anything. Caterpillar roll had walnuts in them -- that's the first time I've ever seen that. I was not ready for that crunch. Usually at any typical sushi restaurant, a caterpillar roll consists of eel and avocado. The sweet nuts really threw off the taste. The Alaskan Salmon Roll... was not fulfilling.

Currently, Appa's is only open once a week, on Sunday's, as a pop up at Irwin Street Market for a three hour window.\\n\\nSince the business is still brand new and has limited availability on a first come-first serve basis, it gets busy relatively quickly.

That being said, I didn't have to stand in line as long as I had expected, but it was still nice that the pop-up provided complimentary lemonade and sunscreen to combat the Georgia heat.\\n\\nAs for the food, I'd suggest getting a bowl because you are able to taste the ingredients instead of getting one jumbled bite from the burrito, and it seemed that you get more with the bowl. Delving into specifics, the regular menu only offers tuna and salmon, but as a Father's Day special, Appa's was offering yellowtail. We had the spicy salmon poke bowl and spicy yellowtail burrito. I would definitely stick to tuna or salmon next time because the current flavor options didn't jive well with the yellowtail. I preferred the spicy sauce, which is basically spicy mayo, over the savory sauce we got on the side because the savory was a tad bit too sweet for my taste. My only complaint would be that the toppings in the bowl/ burrito are set - no substitutions and no requests to leave a topping out.

It was amazing, that's my favorite thing to get and you can't beat it. When we dined in I got a catfish poboy and Fries plate. I was overly satisfied, the bread is toasted how I liked and the fish was seasoned well. Not bitter at all. \\n\\nYou can also take advantage of the fact that they sell Louisiana batter and fry.

The lady who served us was extremely nice and wanted to make sure we get everything the way we wanted. I got the Red Miso Ramen ($13), the broth was perfect, not too savory and not too bland.

My friend ordered the Fuddo-Yama Ramen ($10) and that one was a little bland. It would be perfect if you don't want a broth that is too flavorful.

It probably has a smidge too much mayo for my personal preference but still yummy. I shared a double w/ my bf but we upgraded our chips to onion rings and got a bowl of clam chowder.

I find it to be a chain similar to an Applebees, Max & Erma's or Chili's. However, their menu is much more extensive. If anything, I almost find the menu overwhelming. I feel like they try to specialize in so many things. It's a lot! However, it's also a plus because then there is sure to be something on the menu to please all types of guests.\\n\\nI thought both meals I've had here were good. The first time I got the chicken tenders with fries. On my most recent trip, I got the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Again, good, but not as hot as I thought it would be. I probably shouldn't have even gotten that since I love Hot Chicken Takeover and no where else really compares. \\n\\nI know BJs is known for the pizookies (large warm cookies with ice cream). I REALLY want to try one of those (especially the sampler!). Both times I've been here, we were celebrating bdays, so we brought a cake in with us. On our most recent trip, our waiter brought out one for my mom for her bday. I had a few bites and it was great. Would love to get back to try out more of those! I like how they have \\"seasonal\\" and \\"specialty\\" pizookies here. I guess if they had a specialty, that would be it!\\n\\nSome feedback I have for the management here is that on our most recent trip, our waiter referenced a few times that he was newer. I myself worked in a restaurant for 2 years and I remember being new! He told us that the section he was given was the farthest away from the kitchen (he said this in a joking manner because we kept asking him for stuff all at once and he said \\"I'd rather have you tell me all at once like this since this is the farthest section from the kitchen!\\"). I just think if you really want to set the new team members up for success, you should have them closer to the kitchen. The vets can be farther away and move at a faster pace. Just my two cents from being a server at one point in time. I did notice it would take him awhile to refill drinks (at one point I asked for a water refill and never got it). Again, had he been closer to the kitchen, I don't think this would have been an issue.\\n\\nAnyways, I'm sure I'll be back since my mom seems to enjoy BJs a lot. I'll have to make it a point to get the pizookie sampler! Also, I feel like this is a great place to take large parties since they seem very accommodating. When we were walking out, I counted numerous tables with 10+ people at them. I've never seen a restaurant with that many large parties before!

I really liked how they made me feel as if I was at a perfectly polite Southern Baptist grandmother's home on a Sunday morning. The waitresses were incredibly nice and made the restaurant very cozy. The food itself was pretty good. There weren't many options for breakfast and most of it was pretty standard stuff. I was hoping to find that signature item Chubbys is known for, but I couldn't locate it. Eggs, pancakes, French toast, waffles, etc seemed to be the norm, which is fine, but I'd like Chubbys to stand out and offer at least 1 thing other breakfast spots do not; something to set them apart from every other ubiquitous diner in Orlando.\\n\\nBut besides that, no major complaints. Food was good, prices were reasonable, and the staff was amazing. One suggestion: Perhaps the owners should think about investing in a sign that can be seen from the street? It took me a little bit to find the restaurant. Google was telling me it is right next to the Dunkin' and I must've driven around for 5 minutes trying to find it.

The biscuits finally got there and I was still putting butter on mine when our meals came. I didn't even get one bite before the food arrived. The food was good not great and our portions were fairly small. I had the brisket sandwich on Texas toast, it came with two slices of brisket cut in half and put on toast. I'm not sure if they ever saw Texas toast but what my sandwich came on was NOT Texas toast. It looked like regular bread. I had coleslaw and broccoli casserole for sides.

They have the best unagi don (grilled \\"teriyaki\\" eel served over a bed of rice in a ju box) in town and I highly recommend trying it if you haven't already! In my opinion, the unagi don is more value compared to buying separate pieces of unagi nigiri. Note that the unagi don also comes with a soup and salad as a starter.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I always order the traditional maki and gedomaki rolls, but we also enjoy the marilyn mon-roll (unagi, avocado & seaweed), ozzy (unagi, shrimp, avocado, seaweed & cucumber), and ozzy II (unagi, yellowtail, seaweed & avocado). The black sabbath roll is unique and delicious - everyone that I know that has tried it has loved it!

The service was horrible and disappointing especially since it was a Tuesday night. The food is below average to average depending on what you get. I'll be more specific about my visit below. I hope the poor service is only due to them opening but based on other reviews it seems to be consistently poor across the board. \\n\\nAfter being seated with a table of 4, it took someone about 20 minutes to come over to our table to take a drink order. Our server, explaining it was his first night there but not new to servicing that we would be in good hands. Sadly this was not the case. He took another 25 minutes to bring our drinks to the table. He never gave our table water that we needed to ask for after the case. Keep in mind this was a Tuesday and the restaurant was not busy so waiting this long is unacceptable. Our waiter blamed the bartender for being slow with the drinks. There are three bars in the space but took a very long time for drinks. \\n\\nAfter getting our drinks, we put in our food order. Two in our party got the chicken piccata and said that was pretty good (that is why I said the food would be average). I heard at the old Victor's that the Veal Parm would be very good. I was really disappointed. The sauce had no flavor and also had a chunk of meatball in it (I didn't order meatballs). The Veal was cooked well but didn't have flavor. I don't think it was seasoned before frying the cutlet. I got the homemade fusilli as the pasta. They charge an additional $4 for it since it is homemade. It was over cooked and soft. All in all it was underwhelming and not good. The food took about 45 minutes to an hour to come out which is a ridiculous wait time for a low key Tuesday night. During our meal, we ordered wine to go with our dinner. Again it took our waiter over 20 minutes to get them. We had to ask again where our drinks were because we wanted them with our meal, not after we are finished with the food. Our waiter again blamed the bartender instead of trying to quickly get them. \\n\\nThe space itself is nice and the open kitchen/bars were cool. But they really need to get better/more efficient service. The waitstaff seemed very disorganized and did not go above and beyond to ensure a great dining experience. We sat near the waitress station and the bread was kept in a huge bucket that they would reach into with their hands. This was not appetizing at all and explained why the bread was cold and hard. We were at the restaurant for two and a half hours in all. All we got was one round of drinks and dinner. That's just plain bad. I hope they get better in the future.

Others are just average but fine if one speaks to you; even the johnny cakes which the restaurant is famous for are just another bread dish in my mind.  For appetizers we had some dim sum and the crispy rice.  This had Vietnamese flavoring but went off poor for our table.  For entree the cacio e pepe is a must order. Super cheesy and creamy and surprisingly filling. Ravioli very boring and had almost potato filling. Would stick with cacio in pasta section. The short rib was very good. Had a pecan and turmeric sauce and sweet potato side. Very Thanksgiving, very tasty. Only about 3 oz of meat but good enough for sharing the way they cut it. The desserts were not good at all. The ole cake was a flyer but really missed. Too much kale flavor and not a sweet at all. The ricotta ice cream had way too much going on and did not work. Ricotta was barely there and hidden on the plate. The ice cream had Thai leaf in it so had a spicy flavor which is severely unappetizing to end a meal. Nothing good to say about the desserts in my opinion. Maybe should have told them about our table's dislike for Thai leaf, but did not expect that to be a problem in dessert course. \\n\\nLots of weird flavors so make sure to tell your waiter anything and everything.  Cilantro and thai leaf especially heavy in the dishes.  Beer list very short but have some high abv and Belgian which I enjoy.  Wine list smaller but have very nice variety at acceptable price.  Overall a really good meal and perfect for adventurous eaters and groups.  If you're a steak and potato type of person, I would say do not come here.  But if you're looking for something out of the ordinary, then make a reservation and give Emmer & Rye a try."},{"name":"The New York Pizza Company","address":"3158 Bill Beck Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Sadly I'm rating this place a 1 star. I have been going here for a couple of years and I always see new owners.. not the same cooks the originals that made pizza. At first it tasted like real NY pizza (I'm from Brooklyn) .. but the last couple of times I have gone I have been very disappointed. My last and final time I went to enjoy a slice the pizza was so thin and soggy when I picked it up it was like a wet piece of paper, i asked for another and it was just as worse. Tasted bad with no crunch. I bumped into a friend who had a couple of pies for his family that day and they had burnt his pizza to a crisp and didn't care. The employees were standing around chillen out. All the tables dirty and they just didn't care.

After we passed through the curtain, we were in a back room that had a couple of booths and 4 two person tables, along with a small 3-seat bar. We were seated at one of the two person tables and presented with menus.\\n\\nTo start off the meal we each got a drink. Mine--I believe--was ordered from JM Curley's bar since I wanted something a little spicy. The spicy hemingway I got was probably the spiciest drink I've ever gotten--it was great to start the meal, but not really palatable once the food came.\\n\\nTo start off the meal, I went with the wedge salad. This was prepared in a classic way but it was pretty huge and had plenty of dressing, cheese, and bacon to coat each piece of lettuce. My friend got the spring salad which was also pretty tasty.\\n\\nFor our main course, we both opted for the NY Strip steaks after reviewing what other Yelpers had gotten. The steak was quite large and so juicy/tender. We meant to order foie gras butter to go on top, but after tasting the steak decided that it had enough flavor all by itself. Who knew such a great steak house could remain so secretive?? Oh and the green onion they serve as a garnish--don't pass it up, it's quite delicious as well!\\n\\nTo supplement the steak, we decided to get a side of the macaroni and cheese--as it was the most talked about side dish on Yelp. Though I did appreciate the lightness of the dish and its flavors, it was not quite my cup of tea. That being said, it was still delicious--and quite large--as we were barely able to finish half of it.\\n\\nTo finish the meal, we went with the pot de creme. I was not expecting much from this, but it was the perfect ending to our meal. Not too large and very light--the flavor combination of whipped cream, orange zest, and chocolate was phenomenal.\\n\\nOverall, this place lived up to the hype.

Lo and behold, there was one right in JP! So I moseyed my way over there.\\n\\nAmbiance: From the outside, it looks like a bar. In the inside, it is very cutely decorated with Scottish decor  (thistles, scottish books, tartan cloth, robert burns items). We got a seat by the window, which was perfect, so my dining partner and I could sit closer together and talk.   \\n\\nService: host was very friendly and accomodating. He was able to seat us without reservations on a saturday night, and when we left an hour later, the whole restaurant was full. Our waiter was very efficient and came by often to check on us.  \\n\\nFood:\\nThere is complimentary oat bread with pickled vegetables. The oat bread is delicious, don't need to add butter. Pickled vegetables gets your appetite going.\\n\\nDeviled eggs: This is what has been missing from my life. I've always loved soft boiled eggs, but always felt like something was missing and the other night, I realized what it is.. A hunk of well-spiced sausage wrapped around it. It takes eggs to the NEXT LEVEL. The deviled yolk inside adds just the perfect of English mustard spice to it (kind of reminiscent of wasabi). I would order this dish again and again.\\n\\nHaggis: Soft, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth meat. It's hard to describe haggis...I couldn't tell what type of meat I was eating, but basically it tastes like a smoother version ground meat with bits of onion inside. Rutabaga was the perfect complement to the meat, adding a touch of sweet crunchiness. The mashed potatoes were also quite delicious, mashed to just the perfect texture where you can still detect small pieces of potato. It goes PERFECTLY with their homemade ketchup. This is the best ketchup i have ever tasted - it is light and not too sour,you can taste the fresh tomato behind it. Even the consistency is different compared to Heinz ketchup - this one is more granular with bits of spices in it. And to top it off, the portions were extremely generous. \\n\\nThe dark and stormy is good as a drink on its own (on the sweet side). It didn't really go with the rest of the meal (I know, a rookie mistake), but it is excellent if you're just getting drinks. Next time, I'm ordering the Innis and Gun ale, which my partner got and I sampled, and was just perfect.\\n\\nFor dessert, we split the poached pear, which was nice and light, and complemented the heaviness of the entree. The coconut sorbet was on point.\\n\\nOverall, this is an excellent restaurant to try out. Price point is good and quality/experience is excellent.

There was also a couple of seats at a shared table by the door that were offered to us that was not reserved. We opted for the shared table. What was disappointing was that when 7 pm came around almost have of the seating was available so the fact we couldn't get a table upfront seemed ridiculous. We ordered the meatballs and arancini for appetizers. The pork meatballs I really enjoyed and my co-worker enjoyed both. We ordered the bucatini and mafaldini for dinner.

If we do get drinks it's typically black coffee to try a different bean and it's always fine. Sometimes I get an Italian soda or something cold if I'm in alone just picking up beans.\\n\\nWe did stop in this weekend and it was absolutely slammed. We stood in line at the cafe side for about 10 minutes before ordering. Someone at the register was ordering drinks and food for a party of 8 (6 of them were small children). The next person in line ordered food for 4 and had a lot of questions about the menu. The place was also totally packed. We finally ordered a latte and a cappuccino. It only took about as long as normal for our drinks (because most of the huge orders were primarily food). We really only wanted to sample the current espresso blend to see if we should buy the beans for home and they were so busy I expected to get rushed drinks thrown into cups. But they both had the most precious flowers and hearts on top and were still carefully prepared. Yay."},{"name":"Harlow","address":"3632 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food and menu is amazing but the staff have often made me never want to come back.

First came here when visiting Portland from LA. Never really knew much about tiki culture, but learned a lot in the past few years... this is by far one of the coolest tiki bars in America! Since moving to Portland, I've visited over and over again. Staff is super cool and accommodating. There is usually a short wait, but it goes by fast - plus, you can order a drink while you wait! Drinks are delicious (and fiery!), and food is pretty good, too! I recommend the kimchi fried rice and pickled eggs. The dessert menu is surprisingly delicious and overlooked. OMG, try the upside down pineapple cake and coconut dessert (haupia). Was blown away! There are also virgin drinks available for designated drivers ;) Highly recommend stopping by Hale Pele if you're in the Portland area!"},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Under new management!!!\\n\\nPreviously tascas had been my go to spot that never disappointed. Tonight however I was blindsided to find out they are now under new management and the menu has completely changed. Majority of my favorite dishes are now gone, they also discontinued giving bread with fresh hummus, garlic, and olives. I also noticed that the once wow prices are now raised. Thank goodness they still offer wine and sangria specials or else I would have to take the place out of my regular runnings. \\n\\nThe new menu was still good to say the least, it just didn't wow me like it had previously.

The diner is pretty busy and the servers have their own system of taking orders, which is pretty interesting but takes a while. The brunch ended up taking 3 hours from first getting in line to finally getting our check, but the food was worth it. However, do take the wait into consideration when you are planning on going somewhere after.\\n\\nThe garden omelette with cheese was great! The eggs are a little charred and went extremely well with the vegetables and melted cheese. The portion size is huuuuge and ended up being both lunch and dinner. \\n\\nI can see why the Baklava pancakes are so popular---they are light and fluffy, not too sweet (there is also simple syrup on the side), and has pieces of baklava sprinkled on top. At first I was skeptical that it would be too sweet and overwhelming, but the pancakes were airy and a tad sweet (we put the syrup on the side and dipped into it)."},{"name":"Library Square","address":"300 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Weak. \\n\\nI don't really care for the crowd, and I don't really care for the 80's hits like \\"I wanna dance with somebody\\" and \\"girls just wanna have fun\\" that have been mercilessly beat to death on the sound system here every weekend.

Its hearty and salty but the spring onion on top perfectly compliments and cuts through that. The broth sticks nicely to the noodles. My boyfriend has had the charcoal, spicy miso and the shoyu and if i wasnt craving their shio every time i would have tried them all by now. Their gyoza are fine, but they stick together in a way that makes them hard to eat. This bowl of ramen is a little on the pricier side and smaller, but it's a great experience and each bowl has so much character.

Having just eaten a meal at [not going to name it, but it's my current favorite cheese steak place] the day before, cheese steak was still coursing through my veins when I came in to South Philly Steaks to see what they're about.\\n\\nThe two working there (the owners, I assume?) were both friendly guys that looked like they enjoy the business.  Decoration is sparse, comprised mainly of a few 8x10 frames on the walls.  At the time of my visit, seating was basically bar-style along the walls, maybe a dozen bar stools.  If they do well here, they'll probably need to add some more bar space toward the back or along the windows, and maybe at least one table in the place.\\n\\nI ordered my sandwich, a cheese steak with mushrooms and onions (with whiz) and a side of fries.  I didn't see an option for a half sandwich on the menu, maybe I missed it, but if there is no option like that it might be a problem for smaller appetites. The sandwich was very good, the bread was soft and everything was grilled right.  The fries came in a basket good for about three people.  I'd love to see smaller portions of the fries available as a combo meal option, and offer the basket of fries as a separate side.\\n\\nThese guys make a good sandwich.  They're up against a couple of real heavyweights in Orlando though, long-time bastions of Philly Cheese Steak-dom where excited, drooling relocated Philadelphians flock to get an authentic interpretation of their homeland staple.  For those willing to drive farther, I'm afraid South Philly Steaks won't win out.  However, this is a good location and convenience matters too.  They don't have to be the \\"best\\".  They make a cheese steak that can stand on its own, and I know I'll be back for another one."},{"name":"Regina Pizzeria","address":"700 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Your everyday pizza nothing special BUT got the nicest worker ever that hooked up me and my brother with an extra slice.
