That honor still belongs to Fox Brothers in my opinion, but this is a solid restaurant and when you factor in price it is good food, but there are flaws, and fairly big ones. \\n\\nThe biggest flaw in my opinion was that only one thing I got was actually hot and that was the s'mac and cheese which came out a few minutes after the rest of our food had already hit the table. The s'mac and cheese was by far the best thing about the meal though. I would go back for that alone.\\n\\nThe flavor of the food was all there. The chicken had the hint of smoke, the pulled pork was good, the brisket was tender and cooked perfectly, but everything was cold and that just detracted from the whole meal. I'd actually like a bit more of a smoke flavor on the brisket and pork. It was obviously there but there was a certain complexity that was missing from the food. \\n\\nMy other sides were onion rings and corn. The onion rings were good but a tad bit greasy, and the corn was excellent. The cilantro adds a very nice touch.\\n\\nThe sauces are different and good. It is nice but for the pulled pork I would like a good old standby tomato based sauce. I'm a classic in that way. That is not said to take anything away from the other sauces. The peach mustard sauce complimented the chicken well. The grape bbq sauce was surprisingly very good on the brisket. I found the vinegar sauce went well with the pork but still, I would of liked an option for a classic barbecue sauce along with the explorations of flavor. \\n\\nI want to go back and hopefully get hot food and that may very well up it a star.

The almost empty room was somewhat of an initial turnoff.  We were greeted pleasantly and seated promptly, however.  \\n\\nThe drinks get 1 star.  My \\"blanco\\" (supposed to be grape juice, vodka, and a cava float) was almost entirely grape juice and was waaayyy too sweet - which is really something coming from a girl whose favorite wine is reisling.  I could not taste any of the cava at all - there were no bubbles in the drink whatsoever.  My friends' blood orange margarita came without the sugar rim described on the menu, and was very watered down.  However, my other friend's strawberry daquiri, which she specifically asked to have light on the rum, was VERY heavy on the rum - so much so she had to get a virgin daquiri (I split the initial one as a second drink with one of my other friends).\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were excellent.  The guacamole was delicious - but was an extra order and came in a dish so small I could fit it in the palm of my hand.  Definitely not enough for what we paid for!  The main courses themselves were very bland and lacking in originality and flavor.  My tortilla salad was basically lettuce with lime juice and tortilla strips (though the saving grace was the guacamole on the salad!) and my friend's enchiladas were very unimpressive.  I'm glad they added a dessert to their menu - though the single choice, the chocolate bread pudding with ice cream and caramel sauce was very yummy (albeit slightly dry).  \\n\\nIn terms of service, it was overall all right.  Our waitress came very quickly after we sat down, and we had to have her come back three times before we had a chance to have time to look over the drink menu.  She was very pleasant and well-meaning, though.  Our food came out in two batches, separated by almost 5 minutes- very poor planning on the part of the kitchen when half the table has their meal and the other half does not for quite a bit of time.  After we were done, we waited quite a while before our waitress came back, and we had to ask her about dessert rather than having her offer.\\n\\nOverall, I would give the place 2.5 stars: 2 for atmosphere, 3 overall for service, 1 for drinks, 3 for chips/guac, 2 for dinner, and 4 for dessert.  Would I go back for a meal? Probably not - there are too many Mexican places around with at least as good food, better service, and a better meal for the price.

Tonight, by request of a friend, I review a chain restaurant in my surrounding neighborhood-Applebee's.\\n\\nLocated in the South Bay Shopping Center in Dorchester, Applebee's is one of the available places to eat in the nearby area. There is also an Olive Garden right next to it, and along Massachusetts Avenue, there is Victoria's Diner, Hen House, McDonald's and other places to eat (cannot remember them all at this time). Most people come in the area to shop at one of the big name stores such as Best Buy, Target, Home Depot, Famous Footwear, or even do grocery shopping at Stop & Shop.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very casual. Families, friends, co-workers and others can come and eat or relax and enjoy the game on the TV. At this location, there is various local memorabilia along the wall, such as the Red Sox, New Kids on the Block, and New Edition.\\n\\nOur server's name was Brittany. She was fairly attentive, quick, and polite in serving us tonight.\\n\\nApplebee's menu is pretty wide in terms of selection. I wouldn't know how to describe what their menu is overall or compare it to other chain restaurants, but there are plenty of choices to choose from. They also have multiple specials where you can mix and match entrees, so that's a plus. I chose the 2 for $20 deal, which is an appetizer and your choice of 2 entrees from a section for $20. From that, I had the Boneless Wings, Fettucine with Provolone-Stuffed Meatballs, and Riblet Basket (Ribs with your choice of sauce and fries)\\n\\nThe confusing or bad part of the review starts here though.\\n\\nThe boneless wings were spicy but warm in terms of temperature.\\n\\nThe fettucine had good taste and wasn't too thin or overly thick in its sauce, but the top layer was warm. Only the center was even close to being hot. Some of the noodles were also stuck together as if they were frozen. The same goes for the meatballs.\\n\\nThe riblets were overcooked (one could tell from the dried appearance of the meat) as well as the fries.\\n\\nI ended up packing all the food for take-out to 1) not waste it and 2) to perhaps salvage it in my house by recooking. \\n\\nOverall, there's better options for food. Even going to the supermarkets next door and preparing something at home would be more fulfilling and cheaper than eating at this dining establishment.

My own previous review no longer shows up on the review page (see below).  At the time I posted my review, there were other negative 1-start reviews with similar complains of the service. I no longer see a single 1-star review.  I wonder how that happens? Does Yelp yield to complaints from vendors who want their rating to be higher?\\n\\nAn additional review here is from a person I know. They were recently contacted by a person, presumably working on behalf of the restaurant, who asked them to reconsider the rating of their review. Wow.\\n\\nYelp is an important resource, and buisnesses know this. There is now a whole industry of entities that try to game reviews, in some cases under contract.  It would appear that this resturant is involved in such activities.\\n\\nHere is my original, apparently removed, review:\\n\\nI have dined at this restaurant 3 times.  The food is ok, on par with 3-star level places in the boston suburbs.  \\n\\nThe place earns a 1-star for their dismal service.  On what was final visit to this place, our party of 13 was over charged when the waitress accidentally billed another table's meals to our bill, to the level of about $100. The error was not discovered until my mom's credit card had already been swiped.  Upon discovering the error, we were told by the waitress that she would correct the amount billed to the card.\\n\\nOver the next 15 minutes, we sat there. When the waitress finally came back to the table, she explained there was a problem, and that they were unable to reimburse the difference to the card. I told her to try harder.\\n\\nAfter 5 more minutes, I spoke with the teenage hostess, and asked to be put in contact with the highest ranking person on the staff.  I was told to speak with the woman working behind the bar. \\n\\nI proceeded to the bar, where I spoke with the 20-something woman I was told was the manager. She gave me the same sorry explanation as the waitress. I told her it was time to get \\"creative\\" with solving the problem, as my time was now being wasted at a concerning level.  Such options could have included:\\n\\n1) reimbursing the whole bill, with cash from the till.\\n2) reimbursing the difference with cash from the till. \\n3) reimbursing the whole bill, and then allowing me to pay the revised bill with a different card.\\n\\nAfter presenting these options to the manager, and complaining for another 5 minutes while she seemed paralyzed to actually act, she choose option 3. At approximately t=25 minutes after my mom paid the erroneous bill, I was handed a receipt showing a credit for the original amount paid.  I handed them my best amex card, with its considerable anti-fraud protections, and paid the revised bill.  Needless to say, there was no tip.\\n\\nIt is a nice location, in an old stone building.

I ended up here again last night because the restaurant next door closed down.\\n\\nI have to agree with the reviewer who implied this place needs to take Mongolian BBQ 101 with Genghis Grill. The meat is frozen and unrecognizable (chicken looks like frozen bony red meat circles), the sauces are sad and poorly organized, and everything is dirty. My friend and I actually stood and waited while the 'chefs' spent 5 MINUTES scraping black tar and some sort of dirty liquid off of the grill and \\"catch bin\\" and haphazardly into a bucket. Ew. I guess you really do need all that tar, because even with a ladle of soy sauce, a few ladles of different sauces, and some ginger and garlic, my stir fry was completely bland. I can make a much better stir fry at home in my wok by adding the sauce at the END, somehow drastically reducing the amount needed for more flavor.\\n\\nThe waitstaff are incredibly rude and the whole experience was just weird. They ask you what you want to drink as you're walking to the buffet area, and then by the time you get back to your table there is cold, dry rice, soup (bad), wontons (frozen?), and drinks already waiting, perhaps for up to 15 minutes. That is totally unacceptable, especially when we showed up at 8 pm and there were maybe 5 other tables of patrons.

It was advertised as a piano bar out side and that's what I was looking for on a cold Florida night. The outside, like another yelp user described, is a classy barn. Once we got inside the restaurant itself is nicely laid out and there was indeed a pianist but this is no piano bar. We were sat in a booth where only one of us could see the pianist... We thought we were going into a piano bar so we had no intention of eating dinner but we ordered an appetizer anyway. The stuffed avocado is delicious, full of flavors that perfectly balance each other. For drinks I ordered the Manhattan, which I had to take back because it was way too strong, so that's good, but not what I was wanting that night. I ordered the lemon drop which tasted like melted cotton candy, not my favorite but I still drank it. \\n\\nIn regards to service, we were one of the only people in the restaurant and it took them quite some time to come check on us to order drinks. However, once they did, the service was spectacular. We had a woman with a heavy accent take our order and a nice gentleman take over. The drinks came out wrong.

Everything was good, but not great. The interior is clean and modern, but somewhat cold and impersonal. \\n\\nI do like their concept of Asian fusion however. I don't think i've ever been to a restaurant that serves sushi, ramen and burgers all on one menu. Whether they do all these things well remains to be seen, since I only ordered sushi.\\n\\nWe ordered the sushi panini to start off. You get a choice of spicy tuna, salmon or crab. We picked tuna and enjoyed the dish very much. It was actually my favorite dish. The crispy panko rice added some much appreciated texture. It was like eating a deep fried sushi roll.\\n\\nWe also ordered two sushi rolls to share: J-mynt and Mr. Kim rolls. The names are pretty random. The rolls were just okay. I think the habanero salsa on the Mr. Kim roll overpowered the actual taste of the fish. A pet peeve of mine is overly dressed rolls. But for people who like spicy sauces on sushi, this may be your place.\\n\\nAnother reason for the 3.5 star rating is the price to quantity ratio. Even though there are 7-8 rolls per order, the portion size is still on the smaller side. At $14 an order, it may not be the best value. However, their rolls are half-off during happy hour, so you should visit during those times.\\n\\nRishi's drinks were actually surprisingly good. My friend ordered an Oasis, which she enjoyed. I didn't take a sip, but she said it tasted very \\"coconutty.\\" I got the Peaceful which was a whiskey-based drink resembling a Manhattan. It was delicious. The fact that it was garnished with a piece of waffle was also neat, unfortunately the waffle tasted a bit stale. \\n\\nOverall, I had a good first experience at Rishi.

In fact one of my trips to Franklins where I did not get food, I was able to come straight over here, and wait less than an hour and was served everything I had wanted.\\n\\nalso to be fair, since I mentioned the other stores in reviews, La bbq, Franklins and Pecan lodge are all SO close as far as quality, I cant say anyone is better than the others. If you are traveling Texas for BBQ like I do, all 3 are worth a stop, as well as Stanley's in Tyler (a very underrated place in my opinion that holds its own against these), and Black's in Lockhart.."},{"name":"Cedar's Restaurant","address":"7732 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I celebrated our 3-year anniversary at Cedar's Lebanese Restaurant this past Saturday November 30th and it was truly amazing!

The ambiance was very intimate and very exclusive. This restaurant has 3 floors including a rooftop bar which does not serve food, fine dining on the second floor, and a more casual feel on the first floor.  \\n\\nWe got there at around 9pm and the wait was an hour long, so we were prompted upstairs to the rooftop bar to grab a drink before they would call us. Our bartender was very pleasant and made our drink quite enjoyable. Very knowledgeable about different types of wines, scotches, etc. After about 45 minutes or so our table was ready, they sat us on the second floor which was the  \\"fine dining\\"area. I was a little upset as to why we had to wait almost an hour because when we got to sit down I saw more than enough empty tables. \\n\\nThey provide biscuits and their homemade cream cheese spreading which was phenomenal, we even asked for a second round of bread. I ordered the seared salmon medium well, and my bf ordered a 34oz pastrami flavored ribeye. We each ordered a side dish but they're big enough to share. The mac and cheese was delicious and so was the pecan sweet mash potatoes (side dishes). My salmon was very flavorful and was not fishy at all which is why I like salmon, the pastrami flavored steak on the other hand was not very appetizing. My boyfriend regret his choice and wished he would've stuck to the filet mignon. \\n\\nOverall the ambiance is very upscale if you want to take a special someone here to impress them. We were NOT impressed with the bill, especially when you're paying for something you didn't enjoy.

After a while, we could see why.  As another reviewer mentioned, a  'friend' of the owner, was going table to table telling us how he knew more than the staff about the food [who asked, or cares?} and grilling the customers with questions like \\"Did they offer you bread?\\" \\"Did they tell you this pepper was hot?\\" Then he would grab the offending waiter and point to a table. This 'friend' peering through the glass looking for infractions made for a very uncomfortable experience. Leave us alone already!! I understand the owners want good service, but the diners should never notice telling the wait staff off. I asked a waiter if we could have the trio of bowls other tables had, and he responded anxiously  \\"Do you have anything else coming?\\" We had eaten appetizers and did have meals ordered, but could he finesse it a little better? Other tables had only ordered appetizers and got the coveted bowls, which turned out to be small amounts of salsa and 2 small rolls. So, why the drama?

They were very generous with the seafood portions on the frutti di mare, and also gave ample amounts of tuna on the fusilli.  The sauce and taste was also on point.  The pasta was also perfectly cooked.  They give little bread/baguettes as a starter with olive oil and vinegar.  Maybe I was super hungry, but the warm bread was fantastic.   The waiter also recommended the sengiovese red .... probably one of my new fav reds.\\n\\nAll in all, this is probably one of my favourite restaurants in the North America for pasta.... and if I didn't live hundreds of miles away, I'd be here at least once a week.\\n\\nParking is tricky... the street parking is all reserved for locals and there is valet at the nearby restaurants for $20.

Its VERY run down. :(\\nThis disappoints me because the food is SUPAH GOOD ! \\nMy dad used to own this place. Way back when it was The Fire Barn Restaurant.  When he sold it the decor was changed drastically. It suited the place then but mind you this was back in the 80's.  I don't think they've changed much of anything since. \\nThe food is great. The Italian pasta sauce they make is very good. (I'm picky about sauce) They have good steak tips, the seasoning is done well. (Wish they'd offer a few more per serving)  The chicken Cutlet parm  and the eggplant parm are huge portions. Most entrees come with a pretty generic salad, drink prices are lower than the norm, bread is served before the meal (as it should be ) and you definatly get your money's worth on the food end. They do rush the food, no way it's cooked to order. Its not possible as my entree came 3 minutes after my salad. Which the salad came 4 minutes after I ordered.\\nThere are far too many employees running around IMO.  Too many waitresses, a host, a hostess, bus boys, bartenders...it's too much and this could be part of the problem with updating the places appearance?  The waitresses all seemed to have on yoga pants,  (weather or not they should be wearing them to begin with) ponytails and sloppy hair buns..yet the hostess is over dressed. Its confusing what's happening here. Back to the decor, every booth I could see had tears...not tiny tears..rather giant huge rips. The drinkware was all chipped and faded. The decorating for holiday cheer was a very pathetic attempt at best. Fake dusty poinsettias sitting atop thin layers of tacky roll out style gauze snow. It really looked as if a kindergarten class was in charge here. The hideous pull out chairs are better suited for a VFW lodge, tables are cracked and dull.  The lighting is old, the pictures out dated. Hire a decorator Floramos, please... put a little $$ back into the place.

This place all but ruined our special Saturday night dinner for our bachelorette...thankfully she was an amazing sport about it all. \\n\\nBottom line if you don't want to read my lengthy review: do not rely on this place for any kind of special occasion or for a large group reservation.\\n\\nThe Review...\\nAfter vetting MANY restaurants, we ended up here because of the great Yelp reviews and the fact that they take \\"reservations\\" (I'll explain the quotations later) for large parties without requiring a set menu. They sat our large party (and another!) outside in the back patio on a night with a 90% CHANCE OF RAIN. Severe thunderstorms actually, which I learned in TX are no joke. When we expressed our concern after being seated, our waiter said \\"well the tree above helps block most of it and some of the table is covered by the roof.\\" Ummm ok fingers crossed! Of course it promptly started pouring and no the trees did not block it. We ran inside (grabbing our own drinks off the tray that had just come tableside) and of course there is nowhere to reseat us. We also carried all of our appetizers inside ourselves, but now we can't eat them because the servers did not notice our lack of silverware and also did not bring silverware when we finally asked...\\n\\n(Completed after dinner) Ok, we were finally reseated inside almost 1.5 hours past our reservation time. We would have left but the storm was no joke like I said and Rainey St was very flooded. We did get to eat and must admit the food was QUITE good. It's so unfortunate that this was completely overshadowed by the awful overall experience. A place can have the best product in the world but that doesn't matter if it's delivered in an unacceptable manner. The service blunders continued throughout our meal, even though you would think they would try to step it up. But I won't bore you with those details as well, ridiculous as they are.\\n\\nBottom line, avoid this place for special occasions or large groups. If you're just a small group of 2 or 4 hoping to have a delicious meal on a random night, go for it, it might be fine. But I would not rely on this place for anything special. I called 2 months in advance to secure the reservation for 14 of us, and despite having provided my credit card information AND reconfirming, I learned the day before our reservation that it was not on the books. The hostess asked who took the reservation and said \\"oh they're terrible with that.\\" She assured me they would have space for us. Little did I know it was outdoor space in a predicted thunderstorm :/"},{"name":"Hops N Scotch","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Coolidge Corner desperately needed a place like this, so I'm glad to have HnS in the corner.

And so I arrived midweek at 11 am and waited for about 35 min which is perfectly ok by me. The bottleneck is really the meat counter. There's two guys - one who takes your order and payment one who slices the meat and gets the order. They spend time taking and slicing your order so imagine about two mins per person and that's how the line goes. They do offer you a bite of the beef brisket before you order. \\n\\nThe rest of the counter is confusing as there's one guy who does the drink order / retail grocery store part. Yes there's a small grocery store where your pop and other drinks are located and beer behind the counter. And there's a guy who's a barista who makes cappuccinos. Not your old fashioned BBQ joint. \\n\\nThe beef brisket is what we came for $20.95 per lb, $2.25 per serving for potato salad and chipotle slaw. And $2 for  housemade pickles and $0.50 per slice of potato bread. \\n\\nThe brisket is divine. Super moist and perfectly seasoned. So salty spots. Just pure perfection. I ate the meat mostly naked. Just tried the two sauces on the table just cause. One is sweet and one is tangy. Keep the meat naked. The sauces are interesting but I wouldn't douse the meat worth it. \\n\\nThe slowness of the orders just creates that excitement and it's palpable as you stand in line and talk BBQ with locals and tourists alike. \\n\\nThere was a guy next to me having a meat-gasm over the beef ribs which were market price. \\n\\nThe sides are just as delicious here and complement the meal well. Traditional potato salad with egg, pickles and celery salt that tasted like it was mashed potato like consistency instead of chunky. Not overly creamy and just balanced. The chipotle slaw is a must to cut the fat with its tangy and spicy flavours. And the house made sliced pickles are also spicy and tangy and oh so addictive. And the potato bread is just perfect. \\n\\nService is nice and friendly and what a joy to have enjoyed some great Texas BBQ!"},{"name":"Small Pharoah's","address":"340 SW 5th St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I don't even like lamb that much and their lamb gyro blew me away.

The food are vegetarian.  I had the ramen noodle and iced Thai tea, they were both good.  I very much liked the vegetarian \\"beef\\" in the ramen noodle soup, too bad they do not sell them as a grocery item. \\n\\nThe place is small, clean, organized, doesn't smell.  Staff are friendly.  The selection is not as large as the big Asian grocery store in Pine Hills, price might be slightly higher, but this is a small business, I'd rather support them. Plus the probability of getting shot or mugged on this side of town is much lower than Pine Hills.\\n\\nI called and asked if they have fresh lychee, not canned ones, and if the lychee are bright red.  The guy said yes they have fresh ones.  He told me to be honest, they aren't bright red.  I very much appreciated his honestly.  I drove across town to the store and checked for myself, the lychee looked ok, not bright bright red but decent (note, end of July isn't really peak lychee season, so I understand), so I bought some anyways.  I just ate some, they were sweet and delicious.\\n(On a side note, I called the big Asian store during lychee peak season and was told they have fresh lychee, drove across town to find out that was a lie).\\n\\nThere were some customers who keep wanting price check while the staff was eating lunch.  Each time, the staff got up and check the prices, without getting annoyed.  I think that's nice.  You would not find that in the big store in Pine Hills. \\n\\nOverall, I'd recommend this store.\\n\\nTip:  Eastside Asian Market is located in a small plaza between Marathon gas station and BP gas station.  You can cut through Marathon for sure... not sure about BP (but I think so)."},{"name":"Life Cafe","address":"215 W Central St","city":"Natick","stars":"3","text":"Very convenient location to grab a coffee, smoothie or sandwich after a workout.

Plus the food was awesome.\\n\\nThe \\"ambiance\\"- 3.5 stars\\nThe owners have gone out of their way to make it a family-friendly place with lots of cute kids books and other fun books with an Irish theme.  Seating is very limited, though.  On a weekend morning, we've gotten a seat about 50% of the time.  The most frustrating thing is that at any given time, at least one or two tables are occupied by people who have finished their coffee and treats, and are just there reading or using the free wireless internet service.  They may want to put a sign up and enforce a \\"Out of courtesy for fellow guests, please use the tables only while enjoying our food and drinks\\" or something like that.\\n\\nAside from the seating issue, Keltic Krust has me hooked.  I can gladly thank them (and myself) for negating many a trip to the gym."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Choices choices choiCes got the MAD ANDY and it was delicious the bacon cheddar tots the bomb."},{"name":"Amaya's Taco Village","address":"5804 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Atmosphere:  The atmosphere here is kinda strange.

Looking at the place outside and where it was located, I would probably never step foot in it although I have been in a greasy spoon or two because they had great reputations. \\nIt is very rustic inside and I didn't mind that a bit. Bathroom was clean and the atmosphere was laid back. \\nFirst of all, we were both confused by the menu. Things had odd names and descriptions and didn't make a lot of sense. It had an Asian twist that seemed to be at odds with what was offered. \\n We asked the waitress to explain some things and we finally ordered. I got the Chicken Sliders and spuds. I asked for the Asian slaw on the side because it sounded spicy from the description. My husband got the pork ribs, onion rings and baked beans. He wanted Brunswick Stew, but they were out of it. He was very put out by this-out of Brunswick Stew at 7pm? What kind of BBQ joint is this??? Personally, I don't get the Brunswick Stew thing, but he was very disappointed. \\nSo! I also decided to order a beer and had to make 3 choices before I got something they were not out of.\\n\\nNow to the food. She plunked something down that I really didn't recognize at first. The 2 slider bun tops had not been separated and when I picked it up I saw why. There was only one bottom! The chicken was just breast strips going across and there was some sauce smeared around. $5 for that? I was so put out I just ate the chicken out of it. \\nThe fries were $3 and there weren't that many of them. They were good. The real surprise was the slaw. It was really good and not at all spicy. There was a nice balance of sweetness and acid. \\nIn a perfect world, there would have been two separate sliders piled high with pulled chicken in a savory sauce with a nice layer of that slaw. \\n\\nMy husband said his ribs were good. The $4 onion rings were tempura fried, were stuck together and flavorless. (I tasted them) He didn't like the black beans in his baked beans.\\n\\nOverall I wouldn't go back. I think the menu needs to be revamped and get rid of the Asian influence. It is just confusing. I get the sense this place is in trouble, but I guess they will survive now that the Braves are back.

We should have realized it was a bad sign that reservations were fully open on open table for all time slots and heeded that as a warning. The next red flag was the relative emptiness of the restaurant. The ambiance is decent, but that's about it. \\n\\nWe had a party of 10 for dinner while in town for a conference. Even though the restaurant was less than half full, we waited 30 minutes before someone even came to take our drink order. One person's drink never arrived. After finally flagging down the waiter to take our entree orders, we didn't receive our food for another hour (we arrived at 7:30 and our food did not come out until 9:15pm). In the meantime, we fortunately spotted a water pitcher nearby, which we had to get up and grab to refill our own waters since no one came around to check on us. \\n\\nWhen I asked a question regarding a food restriction, the waiter never came back with an answer. After flagging down another person to take our entree orders, I asked the question again. They said they weren't sure about whether the burrata was pasteurized, but they \\"thought\\" it probably was. That wasn't certain enough for me, so I asked that it be left off my dish. When the dish arrived, it had not been left off.\\n\\nThe steak frites we ordered came out completely cold, tough, and barely cooked to medium (we ordered medium well). The fries were so cold they had solidified. \\n\\nThey informed us that they were out of the lemon ricotta ravioli on the menu, but we were told they would make campanelle pasta with the same lemon ricotta flavors. Instead, we received lukewarm pasta with their tomato basil soup poured on it as the pasta sauce (we know this because one person had ordered the soup and it was exactly the same). There was no lemon or ricotta. The soup/pasta sauce had an overpowering smoky flavor that was not advertised. \\n\\nThree people ordered a seared tuna dish and they got three completely different presentations as if plated by three entirely different people. \\n\\nWe again had to flag down the waiter to bring our check. There were no apologies for the lack of service, long wait and cold food, but of course with a party of 10, gratuity was automatically added.

I definitely want to give this place another chance and order dishes I've commonly seen great things about next time. \\nFor the appetizer I ordered the Bao Wow and the King Peter and Black Widow for rolls. \\nBao Wow was good - I ordered it without peanuts because it seemed like an unnecessary odd ingredient and I'm glad I did. Honestly I'm finding that a lot of places use the least fatty part of pork belly (often overcooked too - blegh tough chewiness) and I'm often disappointed BUT Jade does it right. The pork belly wasn't chewy nor gelatinous and the meat was very tender and fell apart - YUM (I know, not everyone has the same opinion). The hoisin was overwhelming and shadowed the natural flavor of the pork belly - I ended up wiping most of it off. The cucumber cut through the appetizer's \\"heaviness\\" and that was really refreshing.\\nI enjoyed the King Peter roll immensely over the Black Widow roll - I wish I ordered two of them rather than the Black Widow roll. The King Peter roll was light and enjoyable but I found the Black Widow roll a bit heavy and okay..\\nOverall, it's a cute restaurant and the service is fairly quick. There is street parking and parking in the back but I found the back parking is very tight so be careful - a lot of people parked over the lines and because the spaces are so small there were a lot of empty impossible to park spaces (I drive a small car)..\\nAgain, I'm willing to give this place another try."},{"name":"Chez Dodo","address":"427 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Ever tried Mauritian food?

That should have been the first red flag.  As it turned out, the place was only about half full anyway.  \\n\\nWe got to the restaurant about 8 and went upstairs for drinks in the upstairs bar.  Very nice view of downtown and pretty busy with mainly 20-somethings.   Drinks were expensive, though.  Two old fashions and two martinis set us back $62, plus another $10 for tip.  \\n\\nWe went to the 2nd floor and were seated promptly at 8:30.  The first thing we noticed was how loud the place was; the dining room was half empty but we literally could not hear each other talk from less than three feet away.  We eventually gave up and I moved to sit right next to my wife on the bench rather than the chair facing her.  To the wait staffs credit, they quickly came over and turned the table for us.  \\n\\nWe had the chili lobster for an appetizer ($34), a chopped salad ($10), porterhouse for two ($105), and a couple of sides at around $10 a piece.  The wine list was fairly limited and really expensive, so we just had wine by the glass at around $17 a pop.  The lobster was good but literally about 3 bites apiece.  Seemed about the same amount of lobster as the small $4.50 lobster tails I just saw at Publix.  The chopped salad was crisp and good, but they made no attempt to split it for us, which was Ok I guess.  \\n\\nThe steak was the main course which we ordered medium.  It was very large, but a little dry and unevenly cooked.  Well done in some parts and medium rare in others.  We could not eat all of it and took some home with us.  I do not think it was prime meat.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was a little industrial with shiny tile on the walls, nice and huge light fixtures, and art display cases built into the walls.  Unfortunately, the art looked like it came from Pier 1 imports, with brass antelope heads and other eclectic knick-knacks. As I mentioned, very loud.  The waitstaff was friendly and nice, but not very experienced, and it took a long time between courses.  There was a cadre of very attractive women in low cut dresses roaming the place and a couple of mafioso looking dudes also on the prowl.  \\n\\nTo sum it up, the food was just Ok, but overpriced, the wine also overpriced and the waitstaff inexperienced.

We were going to go to Chili's, but it was too busy, so we walked over to TR Fire Grill.  It wasn't very busy, (but it was only 5:30), and I wasn't sure if that was a bad sign, but we thought we'd give it a try.  So glad we did.\\n\\nNeither of us had eaten much all day, we were pretty hungry, so we ordered the \\"box of onions\\", which I wasn't sure what it was, but I assumed it was fried onion rings.  They were so good! We are both fans of onion rings when they are really good, and always disappointed at mediocre onion rings, and these were the best onion rings I've ever had.  It was piled high in a wooden box, and had two sauces with it.  \\n\\nI ordered pulled pork (or maybe it was roasted pork?) with polenta.  The polenta was really spicy, and normally I love spice, but this was REALLY spicy, but it was delicious.  Perfect consistency of a good polenta.  It might be a bit too hot for someone who can't handle spicy food, but if you like hot food, you will love this.  The pork....OMG! The only other time I have had pork that tasted that good was at a very expensive restaurant in Maui.  It was that good.  It was perfectly tender, and perfectly seasoned.  It was not too salty.  Sometimes barbecue food tends to be too salty, but this was just out of this world tender and flavorful.  It was served with some very freshly steamed vegetables.  I had to give my husband a bite of my food because it was so good.  \\n\\nMy husband had the chicken fried chicken.  He was going to order the bacon wrapped meatloaf, but ended up getting the chicken fried chicken.  He is a big fan of chicken fried steak and had never ordered the chicken this way, but it was incredible.  It was a very large serving, more than he could finish.  He gave me a few bites, and it was perfect.  The chicken was super tender, the gravy was perfect, and it was also not too salty.  \\n\\nOur server was very good, food came out in a normal amount of time.  The manager was circulating the dining room, asking if everything was OK.  On the way out I mentioned to him that everything was excellent.  \\n\\nOn the way home I thought, I'm going to put a review on Yelp.  I like to give reviews for excellent service. We live near Waterford Lakes, and most of the places out near us are not great.  Many we don't even go to anymore, we've just given up on it every being good.  It's just too busy out there.  So I was thrilled to find a place that was not super far from us that was so good, that was different from the other places we have around us.  Then when I got home and looked on Yelp, I saw that this was the old Tony Romas....I didn't even know that.  We had only ever been once when it was the old place.  I remember the one time we had been before, that it was OK, kind of mediocre, not bad though.  But this new place was really nice.  I love the different menu.  \\n\\nAnd it is our anniversary today! We hadn't expected to even go out this evening, but my husband was able to catch an earlier flight, and we were both starving, and we figured that we would just get anything, that this would not be our special anniversary dinner, but it ended up being so good that I think this will be our official, special anniversary dinner.  \\n\\nWe will definitely be back."},{"name":"Happy Day Cafe","address":"3312 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Went at 6:30pm on a Thursdays.

The house salad was good though. Also, for dinner there wasn't one appetizer under $11.

The restaurant appeared moderately busy (approximately 50% to 70% of the seats on the lower level were full, 0% of the seats on the upper level were full). After being seated, it took between 10 and 15 minutes for our server to greet us. We had been seated so long without anyone stopping by that I was contemplating asking the hostess if a server was not notified that we had been seated. When our server came by, she asked for our drink and entree orders. Approximately 5 minutes later, our server came back and asked if we were ready to order. I told her that we had just ordered through her, but we could order again. She looked confused for a minute, then it clicked and she remembered that she had already stopped by our table. It took another 10 to 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive (so, in total, upwards of 30 minutes to get a beer at a taphouse). When the food runner brought our food, it did not include the side of ranch my wife had asked for at the original time of ordering (for her fries). When I saw our server walk by (approximately 5 to 10 minutes after our food arrived), I asked her for that side or ranch we ordered originally. It took more than 10 minutes for the ranch to arrive--at this point, by the time we had received our ranch our fries had long gone cold. The next time we saw our server she brought our bill--she did not ask if we wanted another drink, dessert, or anything else. Our server, while she had a friendly personality, was not attentive and did not check in with us often.\\n\\nFood: I ordered the \\"Carnivore Pizza\\". The menu described it as a pizza with lots of different types of meat. It sounded great, but when it arrived at our table, I was disappointed. The price of the pizza was $15.45, but it was very small, incredibly thing, and had very few toppings. The size of the pizza looked like a child's pizza you would order from the kid's menu (if you've taken your children out to eat, you know what I'm referring to). Also, there was very little meat on the pizza. What little meat existed on the pizza was not spread evening across the pizza, but was concentrated in a small circle in the center of the pizza. Ultimately the pizza was very bland. My wife ordered the \\"Black Truffle Cheeseburger\\". The burger patty was much smaller than standard burgers you find at brewpubs or taphouses, which was disappointing considered it was $13.45. It reminded me of a large slider. My wife had ordered the burger cooked medium, and the cook on the inside was okay (it was somewhat beyond medium) but the outside was charred (not seared, but charred) and tasted burnt. The menu described the burger as having house made truffle cheese sauce and a tomato bacon onion jam. There was very little truffle cheese sauce on the burger, and if there was any tomato bacon onion jam on the burger it wasn't detectable. The fries were okay--a little on the soggy side--though they were mostly cold when we at them (as noted in the \\"Service\\" paragraph above)."},{"name":"Corner Cafe","address":"87 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My friends and I descended on this place yesterday after work.

Comfortable, casual, but still just a bit upscale. Stacked up wood (for the oven) is a nice touch. There's a counter if you like that, and tables near the action, as well as an area with window views. High backed benches divide the rows of tables, providing a bit of an intimate feeling. Oven is fairly prominent, and it's fun to watch pizzas being made (it's a bit more complicated than taking your Papa Murphy's out of the oven when the timer dings). Garage door will be open as weather permits, and sidewalk seating is available. Tableware is nice. Your food will arrive on an actual plate. Remember those? \\nSERVICE:\\nI have NEVER been to an order-at-the-counter establishment where staff was so welcoming and helpful. These people just bend over backwards to make sure I'm happy. I feel more doted over than at some full-service restaurants, but they manage to avoid being obsequious or unctuous. One minor annoyance: After they've delivered my food, I wish they'd take away that customer number from my table. It no longer serves a purpose, and it's tacky/undignified.\\nFOOD: \\nProbably the best pizza I've ever had (disclaimer: I've never been to Ken's or Scholls). Crust is sturdy, seems to have lots of nice yummy gluten (yay gluten!). Blistered and leopard spotted, but not scorched. Beer selection is weak. Menu is small, but features unusual items you won't see everyplace else. Arancini, for example, is tasty and well-presented, and the cauliflower au gratin is something I want to try.   \\nPRICE/VALUE:\\nAre you kidding me? Five bucks for a carefully crafted pizza from a wood-fired oven? Three dollars for a generous pour of house wine? (HH prices.) Please, order a side too, or tip generously. If everybody walks out just $8 lighter after enjoying a pizza and wine, I fear this place won't survive. \\nRESTROOMS: \\nsingle-occupancy, and fairly well placed away from diners. Clean enough. \\nOVERALL: \\nLooking back, I don't know why I dismissed this place as a bit pretentious the first couple times I walked by. If you happen to get that vibe, don't hesitate to come in. It's a warm friendly casual place, but still leaves you feeling just slightly sophisticated.

This was one of those where I felt it was too over coated with batter mix. It looked beer battered type which I do not care for. This appetizer is not fully just squid. It is an array of squid and vegetables (broccoli, bell pepper, onion) similar to thick tempura coated and fried - paired with sweet chili dipping sauce. It was hot and crispy when served. \\n\\nTofu Pad Thai - Really dark sauce which I liked and tasted pretty good and authentic! Cubed small tofu surrounding the dish and the sauce was a bit too sweet for my palate. Nonetheless I will request next time easy on palm sugar. Right amount of sauce coated the rice noodles. \\n\\nBeef Pad Kee Mao - Known also as Drunken Noodles with the westerners. This was executed well, Tender meat and vegetables and right amount of gravy smothering the wide rice noodles. Nice color to the gravy and right amount to the noodles.\\n\\nMango Sticky Rice with Coconut Cream - Presentation was nice and nice firmed and ripe not too overly sweet mango paired with sticky rice that tasted lack of sweetness and more salt added to the sticky rice. It was not salty but the palate can detect some saltiness mixed into the sticky rice. The coconut cream and black/white sesame seeds topping enhanced the flavors of the sticky rice. \\n \\nDef come back here again but next time we will try the one near the loop/hunters creek area! \\n\\nFood was awesome and reasonable!

Usually when I go to a place for the first time and it's busy I take that as a good sign but I quickly realized they just looked busy because this place is so tiny.\\n\\nI'm hoping the guy taking orders was new because he was totally overwhelmed by the five people in line, most of whom were just waiting for refills of soda or tea. We spent about the first five minutes painfully watching him trying to figure out how to refund someone who had been overcharged. Then as we slowly made our way to the front of the line we heard the guys in the kitchen ask him several times about other orders that had been marked as to go when they should have been dine in, or delivery instead of to go.\\n\\nSomehow we placed our order without trouble and quickly found a seat outside on the patio. As I swatted the flies away I overheard several other customer talking about problems with their orders. Things were not looking good. Seriously, why are there so many flies? This place should be called Your Mom's Fly Bar.\\n\\nConsidering there was only one other table who hadn't received their food yet and their were 3 guys in the kitchen it took a long time for our food to come. I had the Norma Jean and while it wasn't bad, the \\"cheese\\" they had injected in my burger didn't taste like much, and certainly not like cheese and shot out of the other side of my burger with every bite so I ended up with a puddle of cheese in the basket by the time I was done.

Basically, you are always guaranteed a lengthy discussion with whomever you are with, trying to put your finger on what is wrong with the place and why it won't last.  Here are my favorite theories:\\n\\n-I want to start by saying the food is pretty great, in my opinion.  It's a little fussy and self-important for what it is perhaps, but it's good quality and it comes (or rather you come to it) relatively fast.  I would probably bump my review up to 3 stars if it was more in line with market price of about 20-25% cheaper.  Be warned the vegetarians don't like it, but to hell with them.\\n\\n-It's way, way too large.  Their rent must be crippling, hence the overpriced.  It's approaching the size of Punch Bowl Social (which I'm surprised hasn't folded already).  Maybe brosephs from Beaverton keep that place afloat?  I have a hard time believing that they'd get off their jobs at the cellular phone stores in Tigard and come down to the Pearl just for Tilt.\\n\\n-The bathrooms.  My god, the bathrooms.  They are straight out of a mid-nineties horror or sci-fi movie.  Think Blade or Alien 3.  Overly dark, cold, creepy.  The only thing they're missing is a big industrial circulating fan or inexplicable steam vents.  Whenever I'm in there alone, I'm about one fluorescent light flicker away from running out the door with my pants around my ankles before the monster appears behind me.  Also, who decided prison toilets would be a good idea??\\n\\n-The bar staffing theory.  Every time I'm in there, which tends to be weekends between 7 and 9 or so, fully 25% of the people are off-duty staff.  They are all at the bar, talking with the bartenders. Of which there are 5-6 for 15 patrons.  Their duties?  Pouring drinks AND NOTHING ELSE.  They aren't allowed to leave the bar, so you're completely on your own.  According to one I asked, they said that \\"it's in the business model to break Portlanders from their addiction to service\\".  Tilt is primarily a restaurant/pub, not a nightclub, but nevertheless what business model includes them standing around in clusters doing nothing?  In addition, there is simply no polite/graciousway for them to say, \\"No, I'm not allowed to do that common bartender task\\", so you are instantly at odds with them.  They aren't even allowed to take food orders, for chrissakes, you have to walk all the way around to the \\"food\\" area for that.\\n\\n-The food service.  So, finally, you walk a hundred feet or so to the food desk, and instead of handing you a number like a moderately civilized place they hand you one of those little buzzing pagers, which were super cool when I first saw them in 1995 at Applebees.  They even have a placeholder card on them that says \\"Your Ad Here!\\"  Where am I?  Gresham?\\n\\n-I can see that a ton of money went into fitting the place out, but it was a hackjob in a lot of ways.  Despite having a ton of floorspace, none of it is really used that efficiently.  Tables are placed awkwardly, in some places to crowded, in others too far apart.  The TVs and drink menu behind the bar are very prominent and yet are all covered up by these LED fixtures that were misplaced wayyy too low as well as various pillars and supports, guaranteeing that you have to do a lot of gymnastic moves to be able to see the score of the game or what your next beer will be.  And why is there a huge open space in the back under the flag?  Is that a dance floor? There's a TV but the nearest seat is an comfortable bench about 40 feet away.  When I was there last it was basically a toddler run, which it is actually very well suited to.  Finally, not to be a complete hipster snob, but I feel like overall the industrial, poorly-welded steel and polished wood look would be supercool in 2011, but its getting a little played out.  \\n\\nLike I said: I love the food, I can afford it, and I'm addicted to hatin', so I will keep coming and will miss it when it goes out of business."},{"name":"Agro Caf√©","address":"1201 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Total hidden gem!

Speaking of the sauces, they had 4 different kinds: original, mustard, vinegar and hot. The sandwich also had some braised greens on top that I enjoyed, I actually wished I had gotten that as my side instead of the potato salad. I thought it was yummy at first but, towards the end it started tasting a little too much like mustard. \\n\\nThe interior is no-fuss, there are taxidermied animals on the walls and plenty of pork-centric art. It's pretty small inside with enough seating for about 20-30 I'd say.

I went for magical dining this year after seeing their menu and I will definitely be back as much as my bank account will allow me to. The ambiance alone is enough to make me want to go back but the food was some of the best I've ever had. They ended up offering some of their fish of the day added to the posted menu so my friend got their blackened snapper, we both loved it. Their crab stuffed fried avocado was definitely a good choice as well but I went with their soup duo of mushroom soup and she-crab soup. I could have had just those and been completely satisfied. They both were loaded with flavor and very smooth (except for the large amount of actual crab) and rich. \\nFor my entr√©e I got their lamb by recommendation of our server and it was cooked perfectly which normally is overdone. The risotto and saut√©ed spinach it came with were just as much the star of the show as the lamb. For dessert my friend had their white chocolate bread pudding and trust me she's had a lot of bread pudding but her is now one of her favorites. I'm a very big fan of cr√®me brulee; theirs was hands down the best I've ever had. It was not overly rich but had the perfect texture; both the crust and the custard on the inside.

I joined Yelp solely for the purpose of venting on this issue.  I've been to Chipotle three times now--twice to the one in Harvard Square, once in Chicago.  First time (Square): Bad.  Second time (Chicago): Mediocre.  Third time (Square): Terrible.  Fool me thrice, shame on everyone involved.  Of course, I only went the third time because I received a coupon in the mail for a free burrito.  (The second time I went thinking the place might redeem itself.)\\n\\nHere's the deal: they take a nondescript flour tortilla, add some white Uncle Ben's, plain except for what appear to be some flecks of parsley.  Then they'll add your choice of grisly beef (good flavor, I'll admit), dry chicken, or NY hot-dog stand veggies (by default, only peppers and onions--not exactly what one thinks of in a veggie burrito).  And they toss some sweetened bean gruel on top, as well.  If you ask, they'll add some corn (good), hot sauce, salsa, and jalapenos (no longer available raw--don't ask).\\n\\nThey also have guacamole, which would have been good by itself.  But ice cold guacamole mixed with hot rice and lukewarm meat was a study in contrasts, and not in an especially edible and/or thought-provoking way, except to provoke the thought that I'd be better off not returning a fourth time.  Oh, and I neglected to mention the coarsely shredded lumps of cheese that didn't melt in contact with the icy guacamole.\\n\\nLastly, they will not wrap your burrito properly, so you are guaranteed to end up with the \\"burrito bowl\\" whether you ordered it or not.\\n\\nI admire their apparently environmentally friendly practices, and it is this alone that makes me feel somewhat good about the fact that there always appears to be a line of suckers waiting to get into this place (yes, you have to wait in line for this \\"experience\\").  Maybe it's just because the Harvard Square outlet is new.\\n\\nMy recommendation: go down the street to Felipe's for a burrito twice as good and nearly half the price."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere for a cozy date.

I had the lunch buffet only once, but when I come for dinner I normally get a Thali. \\n\\nI have experienced what some other reviewers have mentioned, namely that servers often come back every 2-3 minutes to either take an order or take away plates, which can be quite aggravating. It feels as if they want to get customers out as fast as possible, even though I'm not sure if I've seen the place completely packed even once. \\n\\nMy experience last night was so awful however, that I had to write about it. For those who don't feel like reading the details, the last paragraph sums it up in two lines. \\n\\nThe food was really great as always, no complaints there. However, we were shown to one side of the dining area by a waitress and headed towards a table for two by the window. At this point, a man who looked like an owner or manager came to us and said we cannot sit there. We couldn't really understand his explanation, but it was something along the lines of \\"there isn't enough room\\". Our waitress reiterated this. About 2 minutes later, the manager sat a single customer at the table we had originally headed towards. My friend and I were both confused and asked why the man was seated instead of us. We were told it's because the spacing between the tables is so tight (and both tables on either side of the one we had wanted were occupied) that there was only room enough for one person. We pointed out that there were two chairs there, and the response was that sometimes it was ok for two people during the buffet but for some reason it was not ok at dinner time. \\n\\nWe choose to disregard the illogical explanation and order. My friend was going to order a single dish and I was going to get my usual Thali. The manager was taking our order and upon hearing this said \\"I think the kitchen might be too busy to make a Thali, let me double check\\". I should point out that the restaurant was maybe half full, and nowhere in the menu does it say that the Thali can only be ordered at some times during the day. He came back and said, \\"I'm sorry, but it would take about 45 min for a Thali and I don't want you to wait that long\\". We were not given the option to wait if we had wanted to do so. My friend and I both ordered our own dishes, which came with rice and bread. Our next server, who was very polite, brought out our food in less than 10 minutes. For those who don't know what a Thali is, it's a tray with bread, 2 dishes, soup, rice, and a dessert. Considering both our dishes came out in such a short time, this means they were pre-made, as I don't see how something can be cooked in such a short time. If they are pre-made, there is no reason why the Thali should take 45 min to come out as it consists of nothing more elaborate than those two dishes. My only explanation is that the Thali, being such a good deal at $14.95 for the amount of food that comes on it, would not have been such a good deal for them.\\n\\nBasically, great food, but be ready to be treated like a second-rate citizen and not be seated where you'd like and be refused your order on the grounds that \\"it will take too long\\". Absolutely horrible service."},{"name":"Tom, Dick & Hank","address":"191 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The mac n cheese was great and my sisters enjoyed the greens w/ the smoked meat in it and the wings.

We arrived about 30 minutes before open and there was a decent amount of people in line. This time around we ordered brisket, pork ribs, and sausage. All three were good.\\n\\nWe got a mix of fatty and lean brisket cuts, and I quickly snagged a big piece of the fatty end as that is always the better part of the brisket. This time was no exception and the fatty end was delicious and full of flavor. The lean end was still good, but does not have quite the amount of flavor and moistness of the fatty end. Some BBQ joints will ask you if you want lean or fatty (always go fatty) and I do not recall them asking this time, so be prepared as they might just go with whatever is there at the moment.\\n\\nThe pork ribs were very juicy and tender -  right about at the point of falling off the bone but not quite, which is a good balance I think. Some people like their pork ribs tougher versus the meat literally falling off the bone as you pick it up. Personally, as long as the rib is good I will eat it. These also appeared to have been cooked with some sauce on them as they came out of the wrapping glistening. \\n\\nI don't normally dabble too much in sausage at BBQ joints (brisket is king here in Texas), but I did enjoy the sausage here. It was more of a dry sausage, but had some good flavor.\\n\\nAll in all, the food (most importantly the brisket) is very good at la barbecue and i highly recommend anyone in the area check it out. Be aware that the line does move pretty slowly, so even if it doesn't look like there are a lot of people it could take a while to get to the window.

The menu is a bit confusing--I had a hard time finding the beverages list on the menu (they are in very small print on the right side.) \\n\\nOnce you order, you are supposed to get a number when dining in, but the guy took off without giving us one. We asked the employees making the pizzas about it, and they just responded with a \\"don't worry about it, we'll get the right pizza out to you.\\" That's fine.\\n\\nWe sat down and looked around to gauge what kind of experience we might end up having here. I noticed that one table returned a pizza for whatever reason, and the couple behind us made rumblings about how their order wasn't what they expected. \\n\\nSo when the pizza arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see that it came out pretty decent. If they had messed up our simple pepperoni pizza order, they shouldn't be in the pizza making business. The pizza had a really nice crunch to it, and the cheese was nicely melted and gooey. The pepperoni ratio was a bit skimpy--could have thrown a few more on there. \\n\\nOverall, I cannot totally dog this place because the pizza came out alright, and they are a new place. Here's a suggestion to improve the restaurant:\\n--the employees (especially the one dealing with customers directly) need to be friendlier and helpful to the customers because it seemed like a lot of people were just standing there not knowing what to order and not being assisted.

I went in to the bakery yesterday and immediately headed for the bolero once again. I was disappointed to find that most of them did not have the sheen one finds on rich chocolate. They looked dull brown, as though they've been sitting in the sun too long. But there was one in the front that looked shiny and fresh, calling out to me. But when I asked the woman there for that particular bolero, I was told that she could not give me one from the front, only from the back. \\n\\nSo I figured out why their desserts have become so stale. They would rather lose a customer because it's too much work for them to pull out the tray and grab a pastry from the front. And now that bolero will sit there rotting away instead of in my stomach.

In terms of Atlanta's (mostly unimpressive) Italian food scene, this really is about as good as it gets! \\n\\nDolce is located on the second floor of the new(ish) Shoppes of Buckhead. There is a valet station directly in front of the elevator that will take you up to the restaurant level. \\n\\nThe massive covered patio space overlooks the Shoppes below and offers elegant heaters, etc., so diners can enjoy being outside even when the temps get low. The interior dining room is enormous as well. This is one of the biggest restaurants I've been to in quite some time, which makes the quality of food / service that much more impressive. \\n\\nDolce is only open for dinner, and ambiance was certainly contemplated with layout and decor. The whole spaces feels very \\"Mad Men\\" with a blend of comfortable mid-century modern furnishings and light fixtures. This is absolutely a date night winner - it's like they planned to only serve meals by candlelight. Talk about some intimate dining!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to go with a group of food lovers who also wanted to try just about everything on the (sizeable) menu. We tried the following:\\n\\nANTIPASTI:\\n- Grilled Octopus ($16): grilled octopus tentacles served over chickpeas, farro, and frisee with a light and creamy pistachio romesco sauce. Unbelievably tender.\\n- Yellowfin Tuna Crudo ($16): tuna tartare served with fennel, orange segments, and topped with american caviar. Fabulous and a decently large portion. (Nearly everything we ordered came in large quantities - more than enough for four people to share.) \\n- Beef Carpaccio ($17): tissue-thin beef topped with baby arugula, crispy mushrooms, croutons, and a truffle crema sauce. The beef itself was quite good but I was surprised at how much came on top. It was like a fishing expedition to get to the carpaccio itself. Good, but wouldn't order again as there are some truly inspired apps I coudl eat instead!!\\n- Dolce Meatballs ($14): tender veal meatballs served over creamy polenta with parmigiano cheese. This was a crowd pleaser for sure! \\n\\nPIZZA\\n- Primo Amore ($17): salty, crispy thin crust pizza (probably about 14\\" in diameter) topped with burrata cheese, fresh bitter arugula, san marzano tomatoes, and shaved parmigiano cheese. (This was also really good leftover!)\\n\\nPRIMI (Pastas)\\nI didn't photograph last night's menu, thinking I could reference a version online for my review, but it seems that the pastas change seasonally because neither of the two we tried are on the online menu. For that reason I'm also not sure about prices.\\n- Pumpkin & Foie Gras Tortelli: The star of the meal last night. Tortellis are almost a combination of ravioli and dumplings - soft, salty homemade pasta that can be filled with anything your heart desires. These were sweet pureed pumpkin blended with a rich and savory foie gras, which had the BEST flavor or anything I tried. I wish I could remember what the sauce was but suffice to say it was light and delicate, which really let you taste the tortellis themselveS. There were also pumpkin seeds on top for a yummy burst of flavor and texture. \\n- Pappardelle alla Bolognese: the perfect dish on a chilly night. We scraped the bowl clean. I believe the bolognese sauce was pork, veal, and beef. \\n\\nSECONDI\\n- Veal \\"Piccata\\" ($29): served with taleggio, eggplant, potato puree, capers - and about a half pound of sliered mushrooms. The sauce was quite nice. I love veal but am not the biggest piccata fan so this was an interesting taste. \\n- Springer Mountain Chicken ($25): a large portion of bone-in chicken served atop charred broccolini, baby peppers, and roasted fingerling potatoes. Delicious. \\n\\nDESSERT\\n- Flourless Chocolate Cake: unbelievable! Served with hazelnut ice cream and fresh raspberries. I could eat this every day. \\n\\n\\nI can't wait to come back here!

Waitstaff was very accomodating and friendly, without being overbearing. \\n\\nThe wine list is terribly overpriced, but I feel like that's almost expected at a restaurant such as Bin 26 Enoteca (trendy, upscale, Charles Street). I ordered a special pasta with sweet sausage and walnuts, and friends ordered monkfish, and ravioli with scallop filling and pea/cream sauce. Luckily we ordered appetizers (green salad, seafood salad, mozz wrapped in crispy speck--all very interesting and tastey) because the food took forever to arrive. The length of time it took for the food to come out wasn't too noticeable because we enjoyed the wine we ordered, and the apps were yummy.\\n\\nWhen the main dishes did arrive, we all eagerly dug into the offerings. The special I ordered--pasta with sweet sausage and walnuts--was extremely good. The pasta itself was terrific, although for the price, it wasn't enough. Part of the reason I think I feel this way, however, is because we're so used to oversized portions. The amount of pasta I got was in fact definitely about three serving sizes, but probably a little pricey even for that. Still, everyone enjoyed their entrees and the waiter came back twice to make sure everything was copacetic. \\n\\nOne of my friends ordered a chocolate souffle style dessert ahead of time. I ordered a strawberry/cookie concoction that was quite refreshing at the end of the meal. Another friend enjoyed a dessert consisting of tiramisu, gelato, and a mini milkshake--trendy, but he enjoyed it.\\n\\nAll in all, I think the food was very good, but it wasn't cheap.

If you usually stay away from places with the word \\"Veggie\\" on the marquee, make an exception and give it a go. \\n\\nUnless you are a grumpy sort who really has to have red meat with every single meal, you will be very content at this clean, energetic, kid friendly place. If you can't abide the idea of a meat free meal, just go to McDonald's across the street while the rest of us eat here. But why not try one the many different veggie burgers and enjoy the upbeat atmosphere? You can have your meat loaf and bacon tomorrow. \\n\\nEverything on the menu is vegetarian, but can easily be made vegan. They also offer gluten free bread and at least one gluten free dessert, their excellent pudding served with a coconut whipped cream. (Try the one made with Taza chocolate.) Note that all of the desserts are vegan. Lemon meringue pie, chocolate layer cake, ice cream sundaes, cheesecake....This is dessert heaven for people who can't have dairy for health reasons or because of their own personal choice. The only blip I have had on the dessert scene was a cake that was quite dry. The rest have been incredible. The pudding and lemon meringue pie are my standard choices. \\n\\nBreakfast is served all day (starting at 7 during the week and 9 on weekends), and is filled with options from omelets to stuffed French toast, a personal favorite. You can add all kinds of delicious things to your omelet, including tempeh bacon, caramelized onion, cheese or house made vegan cheese. The seitan chorizo will make you happy. The home fries, served with their really terrific house made ketchup, are delicious. \\n\\nOrder up a frappe or an old fashioned soda drink like a black cow (all made with locally produced vegan ice cream), and you will be full for the day. So good.  \\n\\nLunch and dinner choices range from salads to sandwiches to mac and cheese, which can be veganized. There are more options available at dinner, including some excellent side dishes. I usually get the arugula salad and the red cabbage slaw, which are both fresh and delightfully flavored. Another side dish we order a lot is the mound of onion rings. That home made ketchup is really delicious with these guys. And Veggie Galaxy offers beer and wine, too, which can brighten up any meal. \\n\\nAll of the different veggie burgers can be tailored in any way by adding assorted toppings. These choices include sun dried tomato pesto and pickled red onion. My favorite sandwich is called The Melt, which has a spicy tofu salad mixture that I would love to recreate. I was less enamored of the Smoked Reuben, which was quite dry and lackluster.  \\n\\nThere's an open kitchen, and you can sit at the counter in front if you want to get a good view of the action. Larger groups will enjoy the booths that can accommodate up to six people. And free WiFi always. Nice. \\n\\nThe staff is really friendly; I have always found them to be very helpful and professional. \\n\\nThe space is reflective of a 50's diner, with a roomy waiting area in the front. It is solidly packed unless you go at an off peak time. There's also a large counter filled with all of their vegan desserts. These can be purchased separately to bring home, so the front of the restaurant is often very crowded with sweet toothed shoppers and people waiting for a table. (Note that the restaurant is closed between 3 and 5.) \\n\\nVegetarian and vegan food have become part of the mainstream. Thanks to places like Veggie Galaxy, people who enjoy a plant based diet can now enjoy dining out in an affordable, friendly place. And if you are a meat eater, you can also enjoy your meal.

This was not an issue, the unwanted veggies were easily removed and being an equal opportunity employer, I love onions of all kinds, not just the grilled ones!\\n\\nAll of that being said, I am still giving the place 4 stars based on the fact that the food was AMAZING! The fries were natural cut potato fries that are made right on the premises. These are my favorite kind, and they didn't disappoint. They were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The only thing I wasn't happy about, in respect to the fries, is that there were not enough! \\n\\nThe burger itself was excellent. They cook the cheese on the inside of the burger, which flavors it and the meat ever so perfectly. The cheese actually permeates through the meat and you get some of the melted goodness in every bite. The bacon was good, even though I wish it were a little more crispy. The meat is great and of very high quality. It is all natural, no hormone added beef. It was very tender and every bite was incredibly enjoyable. \\n\\nTo drink we had a couple liters of the Mexican cokes, which are always an excellent choice, all sugar and none of that high fructose corn syrup crap.  They also had Mexican orange Fanta, and a full line of fountain beverages. \\n\\nThis place is definitely a little rough around the edges but the food itself is amazing, which is the most important factor of all. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys a good burger and has a little time to spare."},{"name":"Mamma Maria","address":"3 North Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We hosted a 21 person dinner here and it was amazing!

Franklin and Pecan Lodge are still on the agenda but those are quite newer. Anyhow, the Mueller name is infamously associated with BBQ. Not only in Texas but nationwide. \\n\\nAfter being turned away at Franklin, I was told by a reliable source to head over to JMueller BBQ. It'd been open roughly a year now but has received amazing reviews. I decided yes and my backup plan was Stiles. I got to JMueller only to discover...it was now LA Barbeque. Without going into the semantics, John was ousted and his sister LeeAnn took over. This was a remarkably easy transistion considering who was manning the pit. John Lewis. Former Franklin's pitboss. Not only being mentored by Franklin (who use to work under Mueller) Lewis also learned from Mueller. \\n\\nWhen I arrived, they were already out of pulled pork. No biggie to me because I focus on brisket, pork ribs, and sausage. I barely made it in time for the brisket and sausage. I ordered a 1/4 lb. of brisket from the end. Burnt ends were perfect. The amount of fat rang true. I also picked up 2 ribs though Lewis gave me one extra. These had a slightly sweet favor and glistened on the surface. The meat came off the bone with about as much resistance as Santa Anna's army at San Jacinto. And lastly...ah the sausage. Hand made. Hot gut. Grease running down my hand. Perfect flavor with a healthy mix of spice and cheese. The snap wasn't perfect but good enough. All washed down with a Big Red. The BBQ sauces both sweet and tangy were soaked up with a piece of bread. Not bad. \\n\\nAll in all, among the best. Daniel Vaughn brought Anthony Bourdain here when it was still under Mueller and although I didn't eat the Q being put out then, I can imagine nothing or very little change to the method took place when Mueller was dismissed. To those complaining about price...get over it. It's BBQ and done well. If you want a McRib...head to McDonald's. \\n\\nIf you can't get through Franklin's door...do yourself a favor, come here first. Or second. Always have a BBQ backup plan.

The layering of flavor is there and the plating--they plate  a beauty of a dish here.   Now my first go around at Spoon, I forgot to ask for my normal \\"Thai Hot.\\" That was a fortunate mistake in that their \\"normal\\" hot is spicy enough.  I like my food spicy and they're not shy about helping you with that. So show off that wannabe iron tongue if you want and order \\"thai hot,\\" but don't say you weren't warned.\\n\\nFor now until they get their liquor license, it's BYOB.

I just wish they had my favorite app, nam sod, as an option which I know is a fairly regional dish and is probably the equivalent of complaining about the lack of grits in a New England chowder shop.

Everything is fresh made. The breads are soft and crusty. The drinks are refreshing and complement the menu very well.

The mussels, ox-tongue sliders, and home-made pigs-in-a-blanket were also quite good. \\n\\nFor $4, the El Pepinito is a bit of a pricy non-alcoholic drink, but the mix of ginger brew, cucumber water, mint,  and lime made it an exotic sort of spicy lemonade. I'm craving it right now. \\n\\nContigo has its own philosophy of relaxation and al fresco dining that is conducive to socializing and pacifying though the enjoyment of delicious food. It is a nice place to end the week or even catch a UT game on their projector. It is mostly outdoors, so guage the weather before planning a trip there. Parking is full on Friday nights, but there is room on the street. \\n\\nOur waittress was attentive, energetic, and patient with our questions.

When i approached the manager concerning this situation he was very cold and brisk and very defensive and even threw the waitress under the bus by saying she was a part time asst manager and was more than qualified to have handled this situation.  My outlook on this is when we were there to eat, her job was waitress and his job was manager.   then he hatefully asked what he could do and i replied to take the burger of the check.  He instantly replied in a very sarcastic tone oh take care of the check I can do that.  i handed him the billbook back with enough to cover the bill minus the burger and a nice tip for the waitress.  he comes back with the billbook and tossed it down, said have a nice night and darted off.  when i opened it everything was still in it minus the receipt.

The meat was tender and quality was good on both, though the kalbi tasted a bit sweeter than usual. I would say taste was sub par, nothing to be hyped about. The side dishes included: Kimchi, pickled cucumbers, some sort of fried fish, pickled radish, lightly seasoned soybeans, and a side of house salad.

Most of the pies and cookies I could make better or just as good and not be paying exorbitant prices.

With so many people waiting to be seated, why was the outdoor dining not offered as an option?  With the seating procedures First Watch has in place it is highly unlikely we will return.

I have heard so many amazing things and the pictures look great. I had a hop in my step when I got out of my car and walked in.\\n\\nWe went at 6pm on a Saturday and there were only two other tables there, so not busy at all. It looked like there was only one waitress on duty, but as I said, not busy. However, no one ever acknowledged us other than the hostess seating us. We waited almost 30 minutes and watched the waitress go between tables (by then a few more tables filled up), but barely glanced at us once even though two of the tables she was waiting on were in front of us and next to us. It was incredibly frustrating, and for the first time in my life I almost walked out of a restaurant. My friend (who is a waitress) and I kept asking each other when we should get up and leave. It was so awkward to see other people being taken care of. I don't like the ideas of flagging someone down or getting up to go get someone, so those options were out...I don't know, it just seems kind of disrespectful. FINALLY the hostess came over and told us she was sick of seeing us sitting there waiting and took our orders for us. A few minutes after this, the waitress finally came over to ask if anyone had been with us and we told her the hostess, Monique, was taking care of us. \\n\\nThe food was good and came out quickly. I do wish I had known about the authentic Chinese menu so I could have maybe tried something from there, some of the stuff looks absolutely delicious, but I settled with good ole Americanized orange chicken. My friend had the Ma La string beans, which were flavorful with a little kick, but not too intense. Fried rice was great due to the large chunks of egg!\\n\\nWe tipped the hostess 100% because she went over and beyond what she was supposed to do. She turned to my friend and gave her a kiss on the cheek!

Very good food, terrible service...but was it terrible service if the incredibly sweet hostess steps up to do a job that's not hers? I don't know.

That was amazing! This one, not so much. We went on a Sunday night knowing it wouldn't be packed, even though it wasn't packed at all we still had to wait for the hostess to seat us for quite a few minutes. There were about 8 empty tables.\\nSo we get sat, look through the menus and decide on the 1# hamburger pizza, so we wait and wait and wait fir our server (Byron) to take our order. After about 10 minutes he comes back and says, \\" I bet you already know what you want!\\". Well yes Byron, I know what we want because it's been forever, not because I'm fat as your judging eyes seem to be saying. So much to his surprise we order the salad bar (don't worry it was drowned in ranch dressing either!) and our 1# pizza. He tells us to grab what we want at the salad bar and leaves. So we get our salads, come back and oops, no silverware or napkins. We look around for our boy Byron, no where to be found. So I go to the bar and ask the bartender for some roll ups(silverware rolled in a napkin), I must have said it wrong because she looked at me like I asked for a kidney or something. Ok no big deal, go and graze on my greens, and wait for the pizza. It comes out about 15 minutes later.  Byron puts it on the stand and leaves, no ask if we need anything, maybe to check to see we didn't have plates or our empty drink glasses. So pop back up to the salad bar and grab 2 empty plates. Byron comes by 10 minutes later, the pizza is gone, if you know a Beau Jo's 1# you know it's small, so no surprise 2 people can eat it in 10 minutes. Byron drops off some fresh drinks , woo Hoo! Then he again in a seemingly judgy tone asks if we want some gelato. No thanks buddy just the check. So this wouldn't have been so bad if Byron hadnt been paying such close attention to the people next to us, it was a 4 top who each ordered a 1#'er so maybe he felt we would be cheap??????? Who knows.\\nSo, the pizza was great, small, but great. I like the crust, like the options you can pick and it was priced fair. The food I'd a solid 4 stars, but Byron brings it down to a 2 star review.

On the other hand, I also have no reason to. This location is very large, taking over the first floor of one of the old warehouse buildings on NW 13th Ave in the Pearl District. It's adjacent to Aveda Institute Portland.\\n\\nI've had Tilt's food twice - once over on Swan Island and this last visit. The other location is now open on weekends and for dinner, which I only found out recently.\\n\\nTilt is definitely comfort food and made from quality ingredients. This means a hamburger might run around $10 but it's on a fresh baked bun, hand formed beef and fresh cut produce. Same goes for biscuit sandwiches - from scratch sauces, fresh biscuits, etc.\\n\\nIn some ways, Tilt is like a local, more upscale and better version of Carl's Jr.\\n\\nOn one visit, I had a biscuit sandwich that was similar to Pine State Biscuits \\"Reggie.\\" It was a larger sized portion and plenty of food, no sides needed. The fried chicken was freshly breaded and had a flavorful batter.\\n\\nOn my most recent visit to the new location of Tilt, I enjoyed the carbonara ham sammy. While the ham, bacon, egg and alfredo basically all blended together, the flavor profile was delicious. There was a little hint of smoky with a lot of sweet and fat notes. The sandwich came on a toasted baguette but I had to initially eat with my fork and knife.\\n\\nTo finish off the meal, I had a slice of some of the best from-scratch key lime pie I've eaten. It was nice to have real whipped cream, lime zest with a little flavor on its own and a thick layer of lime filling. My companion had peanut butter pie, which was also decadent and rich. Highly recommend pie.\\n\\nI like that Tilt is open morning, noon and night. Hopefully that will last and I'll have another place to take people out for dessert, coffee or cocktails. In the morning, this might be a nice breakfast choice as it's order at the counter and pick up so with all the different seating options one likely won't have to endure the \\"brunch wait\\" made famous in season two of Portlandia."},{"name":"Taj Mahal","address":"1075 E South Boulder Rd, Ste 145","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"The lamb vindaloo was delicious and very authentic.

My friends and I visit the fours in norwell last week for dinner, I ordered chicken enchilada. I am allergic to peppers and despite not seeing peppers under the ingredients for chicken enchiladas I still told the waiter so. When he came back with our meals and placed my food in front of me he said \\"I promise you there's no peppers in this\\". The plate looked delicious! A few bites into my food I could taste something that sure seemed like peppers to me and sure enough there it was, all over my food. We called over the waiter and he said that he had told the \\"kitchen\\" not to put peppers in my food. We than asked to speak to a manager and Mr. Pimental came over to my table. Instead of asking me how I was the first thing he said to me was \\"did you tell him you didn't want peppers or did you tell him you were allergic?\\" (First of all, I don't know why he would even ask me this, does it really matter one way or the other?! If u didn't ask for peppers it doesn't matter if you're allergic to it or not, if you don't want it you shouldn't get it!) Anyways, I reassured Mr Pimental that I had told the waiter I was ALLERGIC to peppers and he told me my food had no peppers when he brought me my food. After 3 minutes of playing the \\"well he wasn't aware that you were allergic\\" game I had enough and I asked him to just bring me the check. The manager of this restaurant was condescending from the moment he walked to my table, he wasn't at all concerned of what the consequences of this restaurants incompetence could have caused me. My friends who were also in disbelief by the way the manager of this restaurant handled the situation went to try to find another manager or a general manager. She was directed to the GM Karle Lovell. When my friend went to bring to Mr. Lovells attention what was happening he said that he \\"already knew but was busy with someone else\\" and that was the end of the conversation. I was probably there for another 15 minutes waiting for the check and through out that time Mr. Lovell never came to my table to find out how I was or even to see if I needed anything. Obviously this management team does not care about what happens at their restaurant.

Unfortunately once we got to our table the service was incredibly slow.  It took them at least another 15 minutes to take our order.  We got the Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries as our appetizer.  The fries were good, especially after mixing in the broken egg yolk.  The sauce they served with it was pointless, though.  It would've been nice to have some bold flavor there to offset the subtlety of the potatoes and egg yolk.  \\n\\nOur entrees arrived about a half hour after we got our appetizer, which was way too long considering we ordered everything at the same time.  We got the Pork Blade Steak and the Crispy Chicken Thighs with a side of Crispy Brussel Sprout Leaves.  The pork was extremely fatty, and the crust of the chicken thighs was way over-salted.  The chicken itself was tender and juicy, but the salt over-powered pretty much everything.  \\n\\nThe sides were really the stars of these dishes.  The arugula was seasoned with salt, pepper, and lemon, and was very good (even though once again the salt was a bit heavy-handed).  The brussel sprout leaves were the best thing we ate.  The golden raisins were a really nice touch that balanced the earthy flavor with a refreshing sweetness.  This was really the only part of our dinner that lived up to our expectations.\\n\\nOverall, the quality of the food wasn't good enough to justify the cost.  After tip our meal was over 50 bucks, which is usually standard for a nice Friday night dinner.  Unfortunately the food  and the service wasn't worth it.\\n\\nMy guts and my wallet will thank me for not going back."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We just had brunch here.

Yummm...!\\n\\nMy girl friends and I were visiting Austin for a bachelorette party, and we pre-ordered la Barbecue for lunch. Not only do they deliver amazing food, but the folks here also are on top of their service game.  \\n\\nOnline, you can pre-order your food at least 3 days in advance: you must order 1 pound of meat minimum, but there's no minimum price. You choose a time, but they do not allow early pick-ups. You cannot add or change your order once it is placed, and you can add notes to your order and they can accommodate. But if all pick-up times are filled, then you must wait in line at the restaurant.\\n\\nWe shared a big order of Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Pork Ribs between 8 of us (I think our MOH got a pound each?).  We also shared tubs of side dishes like the chipotle slaw, potato salad, and beans.  Although we took our food as a pick-up, we parked ourselves at one of the outdoor picnic tables and got to munching.  The meat fell off the bone, and you barely need a knife to cut anything; you can just grab what you want, and the meat falls right off.  Interestingly enough, there was a bachelor party eating next to our table, and we shared some sides, and I really liked the marinated pickles.  \\n\\nla Barbecue launched itself as top 2 of my favorite BBQ places in Austin, and I can't wait to come back and eat there again."},{"name":"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen","address":"875 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"I am shocked to see only three stars average.

No the most inviting since it is primarily a tortilla factory and then the restaurant part was an afterthought.  So the restaurant feels a little cramped and when it's full or there are kids around it can be quite noisy!  I am guessing capacity is the dining area is about 20 people and sometimes the clientele can be a little too blue collar.  In one particular instance I remember this one \\"tex-mex\\"/hispanic (definitely not from Mexico but of Mexican American origins) speaking loudly to his friend and/or on his blue tooth device and being incredibly vulgar!  You could tell Spanish was not his first language but he was certainly trying, dropping all kinds of curse words in Spanish.  Nasty!\\n\\nThe service is pretty decent, not slow at all but certainly not service with a smile.  Waitress (there's usually only one) is mostly if not completely Spanish-speaking so like others have said, this equates to authenticity!  This is not Tex-Mex food.  And it is good!  My girlfriend (Asian but loves Mexican food) loves the flautas (yes they are flautas, not rolled tacos or taquitos) there. They give you 4 to an order and they are fat and round!  Filled with chunks of chicken, not shredded or \\"pulverized\\" chicken.  They are hearty and filling.  Tasty albeit a little too oily sometimes.  They don't skimp out on the meat nor the avocado that comes with the \\"side\\" salad.\\n\\nI myself have grown fond of the Caldo de Res/z.  Don't quite remember how they spell it as you can see plenty of typos on their menu...again, English is not the 1st language spoken here.  It is savory, not greasy, nearly boiling hot and perfect for one of those chilly winter days like we've been getting here.  On a hot summer day I don't recommend it...yes it is still delicious but it'll have you sweating!  Especially if you accompany it with a chile toreado.  Those suckers are hit or miss but they can have you in tears! Sabrosisimo!  The caldo has carrot spears, potato, some cilantro, I think, and it comes with some Spanish rice that is just okay.  Just throw the rice into the caldo, it's better that way.  You get a side of warm tortillas and they don't skimp out on the tortillas!  I think mine came with about 6 of them.  For caldo, go with the corn tortillas.  Flour would be a sin!\\n\\nWhenever in town I plan on going back.  Fingers crossed I don't have to share the small room with another \\"vato/mofo/dog\\"...whatever!  People like that embarass me...I am Mexican American, just like him.\\n\\nStill, give this place a try..despite the humble and cozy seating area, or the questionable neighborhood, or the only one way in and one way out parking lot, it's definitely good eating and worth it!

ODD!!!!  *\\n\\nOk, I had heard that for some strange reason there was a traditional Japanese restaurant in the Shaughnessy Village Guest House.  How odd.  \\n\\nThe guest house is one of those spots that charges someplace around $30-$40 a night for long-term stay backpacker types.  And I'm not talking Japanese work holiday backpackers.  It is clearly focused on the mainstream backpacker market.  \\n\\nThe front desk of the guest house has security glass and a grumpy guy sitting behind the counter.  The \\"lobby\\" has a bunch of young backpacker types sitting on ratty sofas using the wifi (which I presume is only available in the lobby?).  The washrooms have locks and the front desk won't give you a key unless you are staying there.  You get the picture.  \\n\\nWander through the \\"lobby\\" and you find Tenhachi, along with a cooking smell reminiscent of an institutional cafeteria in Japan.  \\n\\nApparently the owner of Tenhachi just rents the space and they are two separate businesses.  \\n\\nSo Tenhachi provides standard western breakfasts for the guests of the guest house that have a voucher, and also provides traditional Japanese breakfast boxes for cash.\\n\\nI saw something I've never seen in a Japanese restaurant before - a notice that \\"Tips are not included in voucher price.\\"  A sign of where the restaurant is located I suppose, and adaptation to Canadian tipping requirements.  \\n\\nBut I wasn't there at breakfast time.  It was for lunch.  \\n\\nTheir menu contains some rather confusing combos such as:\\n\\n- California roll, Chicken Strips, Fries and Salad\\n- California roll, Fish & Chips, and Sunomono\\n\\nI don't think I've ever put chicken strips with fries together with a california roll before.  Or Fish&chips togetehr with sunomono?!?!?!  WTF?!?!?!?!\\n\\nI skipped over the combos and focused on the Japanese offerings to order the Katsudon.  My dining companion did the same and ordered the Tempura Udon.  \\n\\nThey had clearly Japanese flavour profiles.  But they also sadly use really inferior quality products - more in keeping with the guest house location.\\n\\nThe katsudon had nice seasoning, but the pork was one of the worst quality cuts I have had.  Do you know the type when you bite into a piece and you just can't get through it?  So you end up having to eat the entire piece or none at all?  That kind.  Ugh.  \\n\\nIt came with a nice miso soup that had a generous amount of fillings.  The miso soup was actually quite good.  It also had some fresh cucumber light pickles which were nice.  \\n\\nI got to taste the tempura and udon.  The tempura was overly battered with almost no content.  For instance, the carrot piece was paper thin yet covered with close to a centimetre of greasy batter.   Not good tempura.  \\n\\nThe udon broth was actually nicely flavoured, but had those pre-packaged kind of noodles that you can purchase at any Asian grocery.  \\n\\nService was very friendly, but it is a real shame they use such low quality ingredients overall - because it seems they could produce the right flavour profiles if they had the right ingredients to work with.  \\n\\nOdd.

They also had a pretty decent wine and beer selection and the menu was brief but filled with goodies.\\n\\nI decided to go for one of their specials after having trouble choosing  from the menu (and our server was really friendly and patient with me, because I really couldn't decide what to get - I wanted everything). I got some kind of shredded lamb dish (I forget exactly what), and it was delicious!!! I practically licked the plate clean, it was so good! \\n\\nI would definitely love to eat here again, but it is a bit pricey so I'll probably have to wait for another special occasion. But I already know what I want to order off the menu for next time. :)"},{"name":"Brigham Circle Chinese Food","address":"728 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Bland, greasy food.

Last night my sweetie & I went to Red Brick Pizza for a \\"dinner and a movie\\" date.  I'm pretty sure after eating at this place that we could have gone to see a double feature of \\"Ishtar\\" and \\"Battlefield: Earth\\" and the movie would have still been the better part of the date.  This is probably going to be my last visit to Red Brick Pizza.  And here's why:\\n\\nFirst of all, I don't care for the abundance of TVs.  When I think \\"pizza place\\", I think a dimly-lit place with waxy red & white checkerboard tablecloths.  Not a restaurant where everyone has their own flatscreen TV to watch what they want.  And no, I don't want to watch a Glee-a-thon on Oxygen when enjoying a pizza.\\n\\nOK, maybe I went a bit too far by saying that I'd enjoy this pizza.  The GF and I wound up each ordering a small salad and a small pizza.  I opted for the Italian chop salad, which was far too laden in dressing that was not tasty at all.  The ingredients were on par with a Wendy's salad.  No, not a complement at all.  For the pizza, I went with a pizza bianco, which was supposed to be a light flavor with pine nuts, a little cheese and mushrooms.  What I got were mushrooms that tasted about a week past their expiration date, pine nuts that were definitely stale and had that iron aftertaste, and a big puddle of grease on top of crust.  All served atop a delightful round of cardboard, which really sets the mood for me when I'm eating pizza.  Three napkins full of grease later and the pizza was still barely edible.\\n\\nLooking at other reviews, it doesn't look like most people go here for the flavor of the food.  If I really wanted to watch TV while I ate, I would stay at home and make my own pizza.  Fortunately, we wound up using a coupon on this meal, which made the price the only palatable part of the dining experience."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic happy hour and incredible dinner menu!

Asking to sample a bourbon before I bought a glass was also met with a sneer. They are required to get a particular number of pours out of each bottle and customers would not be getting a taste. I walked away from the bar with empty hands. (Want to try an mind-blowing new cocktail accompanied by skillful and courteous bartenders?

There's a few table and chairs set up inside the door, then walk back to the counter in the middle of the restaurant to order. We arrived right behind a couple, and then proceeded to wait...and wait....and WAIT. The couple stood at the register forever waiting on the cashier to take their order. He stayed on the phone the entire time, doing I'm not sure what because he never addressed it. After finally making it to the register, he sat on the phone for another few minutes before even acknowledging us. A half hearted \\"sorry\\" was offered, but would have been more meaningful had it not been obviously perfunctory. \\n\\nWe ordered the queso, brisket, chorizo, and asada tacos. Everything came out in a timely manner. The queso was so terrible I really don't know what to say. It was so watery you couldn't even get it on the chip, and had zero flavor. We even added fresh jalepenos and it didn't help at all. The chips were solid. The tacos are on small corn tortillas with a generous portion of meat in them. It was just the meat and taco, and then you adorn it yourself at the condiment bar. All the ingredients were very fresh on the bar, and the salsas were very spicy, which I like. Probably not a good thing for anyone with a sensitivity to spiciness. The tacos were all ok. Nothing to live up to some of these ratings. \\n\\nI'd recommend going out to Buford Highway if you're looking for some great Mexican."},{"name":"Tanuki","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is scrumptious!

Though I am unable to pronounce what the squid thing's name is, I am in love with it. It was a bit fishy, but oddly not in a bad way. The seasoning really blended well with the fishy flavor. I wanted to order another, but then our main dishes came out: \\"beef thing,\\" and kimchi fried rice. The \\"beef thing\\" is heaven. I have no idea what they did to that cow, but it was some of the best beef I have ever had. The kimchi fried rice was awesome as well. \\nTanuki's food is heavenly, but I am knocking off one star because of the location and the size of their restaurant. Tanuki only has seating for about 16 at a time. There was only one girl working the bar/waitressing, which she handled very well, but there were times when I wanted to jump in and give her a hand. Tanuki is crammed into what appears to be the basement of this red brick building in the Alphabet district (which is one of the \\"trendy\\" neighborhoods in Portland). The pretension in the Alphabet district is nauseating. Since the Alphabet district is \\"trendy\\" this makes parking a nightmare.

The tendons are soft...but I thought the lamb was very good.  I am a little biased because lamb is one of my favorite meats next to venison.  \\n\\nThe fish I tried wasn't dry, but moist.

Last night we were three hungry diners who just couldn't pull the trigger on any of those entrees and ended up going to get Thai later instead.  We did enjoy a few of the small plates - the pigs in a blanket were tasty but not earth-shattering (I'm not sure we'd order them again), the white bean dip was delicious (although we all wished there was more of it), and the green beans were near-perfect (and a good portion to boot).  I'm very curious to see where the menu goes in the future, and hope they take some cues from some of the places I really love to eat AND drink, like The Good Knight.  Food, overall, was probably a 3-star experience.\\n\\nRight now, drinks are truly Contigo's strong suit.  I ordered the Contigo Ranch Swizzle, which was very tasty but awfully sweet - if you like your cocktails to taste like delicious magic juice and not alcohol, this is the drink for you.  My boyfriend ordered the El Jefe which was the perfect combination of sweet bourbon and cherry liqueur tempered by smoky scotch - I loved, loved, LOVED this drink!  And our companion ordered the La Mariquita, which sounded strange in writing but ended up being the best sweet tea vodka drink I have EVER imbibed.  The beer selection is as wonderful as the cocktails, with many local favorites on tap, and my friends and I shared a growler of Thirsty Planet's Thirsty Goat Amber to round out our evening.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is truly lovely, and you really do forget that you're right off the much-maligned Airport Blvd.  Personally I think the location is brilliant, as the Windsor Park and University Hills crowd is STARVED for good drinking and dining options that don't send us downtown, and our friend from Hyde Park hopped over to meet us in just a few minutes of driving time.  Then of course there's the well-heeled Mueller crowd, who seemed to comprise the majority of the patrons last night.  \\n\\nContigo is truly a blessing for the neighborhood.

It was dry, and needed to either have been soaked longer or cooked with more water because it was a tad hard. I had one of their rolls with salmon, tuna, mango, and avocado.

We were a few minutes early so we peeked in and decided to buy a few cupcakes so they would be there for us after our meeting was over.  While boxing them up, the girl serving us dropped one of the cupcakes. She had her back to us, but I could see by her body language that she thought about it for a second and decided to go ahead and box up the damaged cupcake without saying anything. \\nWe went to our 15 minute meeting and were back within 20 minutes to order one more pastry and eat our cupcakes. When I opened the box, I saw that my cupcake was indeed badly damaged, so I said \\"this cupcake is mangled\\" The very same girl who dropped it said \\"The cupcakes are very delicate, it probably melted a little bit while it was sitting\\" I said, \\"no, I saw you drop it and box it up anyway.\\" Slightly embarrassed for being caught in a lie, but undaunted, she said, It wasn't that damaged, the owner would have told me that it was still good to sell and would have made me set it back out for sale.\\" She asked me if I wanted the last good one. I told her it was fine, but I would want a discount on the other pastry we were about to buy. I didn't want to make them throw it away, and it was in really bad shape, the frosting was mangled and the cake part was crushed and broken up. She said they could do that and rang me up. As I was handing her my card, I asked how much of a discount the had applied. It was twenty five cents! I had even tipped them on the first order!!! I complained and they traded me the mangled cupcake with a new one. The girls working on the counter tried to sell me a wrecked cupcake, lied to me, and were sketchy about making it right.

Burnt tasting and overly sweet would be the way to describe it. Anna uses Cafe d'Arte espresso, which I have not had anywhere else, but the experience here would not predispose me to it.\\n\\nAnna Bannanas used to pass as it was the only local coffee place in town.

Twice, actually.  I went with a group of 8 for lunch, and again with a date for dinner.  Both were good experiences.  \\n\\nLunch:\\nI had the Tom Yum Koong (Lemongrass soup with shrimp) which was very good.  The spice was just right.  It seemed a little oily on the lips, but the flavor was amazing.  I followed that with the Salmon Curry, which I wasn't sure I would like, but which turned out to be fantastic.  It was a green curry sauce, which paired well with the salmon and kept it moist.  The place was packed.  I was glad I called ahead so that our group could be seated immediately.  Service for 8 with about half of us getting an appetizer took a full hour, and we pushed through the cash-out process.  For a group lunch, I would recommend coming before 12 or after 1 to avoid the rush.  Also, do not expect to have hushed conversations during the lunch hour.\\n\\nDinner:\\nWe rolled in shortly before 8 on a weekday.  There were a couple other tables seated, but the place was MUCH quieter.  I had the soup again, and then tried the duck curry.  The soup was perfect, again.  The duck was nice and tender, and the red curry matched well with it.  This was all paired with a nice glass of wine, of which they have a small but satisfying selection.\\n\\nOverall the staff did a great job for both visits, and the preparation and presentation of the food was great.  I have eaten Thai food all over the world, and the Thai Grille does a solid job.  If you like Thai food or are looking for a place to try it for the first time, I highly recommend this spot."},{"name":"Mi Tradicion","address":"111 N Stygler Rd","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"My recommendations: the agave margarita, ensalada Santa Fe, and carnitas.

STEAMED CHICKEN BUNS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oPzuFrk44I7RlcuvHFRcIg?select=ZJIgPvz7dbLRgS2bJsaSrQ): B; tasty, but not enough chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oPzuFrk44I7RlcuvHFRcIg?select=nLOwU5K5Gepea2A9KzbaMA)\\n5. STEAMED RICE WITH CHICKEN, LILY FLOWER & FUNGUS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oPzuFrk44I7RlcuvHFRcIg?select=kXfij8IsaxCy7UdozN3edw): A; yummy tender and flavourful dark meat chicken, lily flower and fungus were great too\\n6. STEAMED CHICKEN FEET (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oPzuFrk44I7RlcuvHFRcIg?select=Gss-vF8u5wKsjeOdPKkhpA): C; a little bland\\n7.

STEAMED SHRIMP PASTE WITH EGG TOFU & FISH ROE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oPzuFrk44I7RlcuvHFRcIg?select=XAVfW0bQ_WrISY8uDhc3og): C; lots of succulent shrimp, but the egg tofu would've been better deep-fried for texture and the bright red roe was unsettling\\n\\nOverall, really not impressed.

A brick archway leads you into the dining area with classic pictures and lighting on the wall. Wait staff is on top of it, the serve table side salads, entrees and desserts. We had the Caesar salad and let me tell you it makes the difference having all the fresh ingredients added right in front of you. And if you ever decide to dine here that is a must along with their cheese toast. I had the bone in rib eye and it was cooked to perfection with a baked potato. Then dessert came around and I told our waiter to surprise me and he did with Bananas Foster which was prepared table side. This has been one of the most memorable nights that I will have.

Norwell is by far the worst. I came here last Saturday night with my two teenage daughters and my fiance. When waitress came over after 20 min wait she said sorry if I yell and Im rude its been a long night. She was a mess looked like she hadnt bathed in a week. She pupisely did not have a name tag. We ordered and she messed all drinks up and then complained saying we made mistake and it wasnt her fault. Then did nothing to correct it. When food came out my daught had got fish. It smelled very fishy and bad. She took one bite and spit it out said it was sour tasting. Then she tried to eat her coleslaw and it was soo rotten and was what smelled like rotten fish. It was busy so i figured maybe a mistake was made and it would be rectified. I brought it up to the girls that work in the front and asked them to smell coleslaw. They both almost threw up and gagged and apologized. One of them went and got a manager and asst manager. The asst manager said he couldnt smelk anything bad. He said we have served 200 of them and no complaints. I know this is a lie cause i saw several other people complain. He was very rude and i exclaimed how i come here often. He rudely said he would replace coleslaw and said it would be coming from same batch that we had already gotten. My daughter was so grossed out didnt want replaced with same royten slaw. Then general manger came over and smelled it and said he couldnt smell any sour rotten. I asked him to take a bite if he thought it was ok to serve to customers. He then said he was allergic to coleslaw. Haha who is allergic to coleslaw. Unless you know its bad. He then said he wasnt going to argue and walked away. I am a professional well respected in this community and have never been treated so rudely. Our meal came to over 90 dollars with no alcohol and my dog wouldnt even eat leftovers. The managers were terrible and are really hurting this restuarant. You will be out of business if they keep this up. The waitress was hooriblw too she dropped one of two peices of fish and pretened like no one saw her do it. Then 5 mins later she just came and picked it up off floor. They tried in no way to rectify situation. Waitress tried to stand and block me from talking to manager. She was super rude amd abusive when I got up threw a 100 bill on table and left because she only got 10 tip. She didnt deserve 10 cents. I will tell everyone i can not to eat hear they are so bad.

This last weekend, my wife and some friends completed the Sun Run.  As downtown was flooded with people looking for food after the run, we all decided to take the short walk over the Cambie bridge to Max's and try out the burgers we had all eyed at some point.  \\n\\nAs we entered Max's, surprisingly we were the only ones that were in the restaurant (at almost noon on a Sunday).  We were quickly approached by the server who sat us at a table and provided menus. Unfortunately, this was the most interaction we had with the server. The two staff on shift (the server/cashier and the cook) always seemed to be busy doing something.  Not necessarily cooking or serving, but busy walking around looking busy, but I honestly couldn't tell you what they were doing.  It took over 30 minutes to get our orders taken and during our 2 hour stay (not by choice, but due to slow service) we had our drinks refilled once.  They were only refilled after we had to go to the front and ask for more water, since asking 3 times when the server passed by we were told they would bring some more over in a bit and never did.  One item that took me back a bit was two larger groups came in after we did (about 8 people).  Although both groups came in and ordered after us, both groups received their food before us (or any other smaller group that came before them).  I know it was a good sized group of people, but I would have not said the restaurant was very busy, and could have easily been handled by staff at other restaurants.\\n\\nWhen the food arrived (about 1.5 hours after ordering), it looked great!  However, with the first bites, we were all disappointed - 2 people with beef burgers, one person with chicken and one with pulled pork.  The beef was not seasoned at all.  This isn't always a bad thing, but this requires the meat to be juicier instead.  However, this beef was not.  The chicken on the other hand was over-seasoned with an incredible amount of salt.  And finally the pulled pork... although the pork was tender and had a generous helping of sauce, it really didn't have much flavour and the slaw on top was soft, not crunchy.  \\n\\nMost of the burgers on the menu are between $15-17 and have one side. You can make substitutions, but if you change almost anything it will cost you another $1-3 dollars.  I don't know about you, but crossing the $20 level, the burger better be pretty special.  For me, the burgers were ok at best.  For smaller places, Romer's and Burger Heaven are far superior, while chain \\"gourmet\\" burger bars such as Vera's or Fatburger I feel also offer a superior product at a lower cost. If you're hoping the side items may be the saving grace for the burgers, the salads were simply ok, and the yam fries, fries and onion rings were present but not memorable. \\n\\nOne person at our table ordered the whiskey vanilla milkshake to try.  Both he and his wife agreed, although nice in theory, the execution was lacking.  Whatever was done to make the milkshake, it caused the person to order it to think he wanted to avoid milkshakes for awhile (which is a pretty bold statement, since he loves milkshakes).\\n\\nOverall, Max's Burgers was disappointing in service, flavour and price.  It's in a prime location and with the name of Max's has the potential to be a great little shop. Instead, it feels sloppy and almost a cash grab by just using the name. Unfortunately, it's a place I do not plan on going back to anytime in the short or long runs.  \\n\\n1.5 stars out of 5."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The band outside is talking crap about groups of people and being very inconsiderate and inhumane.

She knew what kind of wine to offer my friend since she loves sweet wines, and was spot on with out orders. We decided to order a good range of things to get a taste of the food style at La Famiglia Giorgio's. \\n\\nI can say  bruschetta was a unique and wonderful experience. I have never had it on garlic bread before, and the tomato was extremely fresh and ripe. The Caprese was perfect! Unique as well, as the balsamic was sweet with the buffalo mozzarella. Again, very fresh and great flavor. Nothing was too over powering and the flavors all worked well together. I highly recommend both of these appetizers. \\n\\nVeal Florentine was my main dish, and it was THE BEST VEAL I have ever had in my life. It was not over cooked, the sauce it was paired with complemented it perfectly and the penne noodles were a perfect addition to this dish. I seriously could not get over the flavor and over all portion of this meal. I have enough food to eat this for lunch the next day as well, and it was just as amazing. \\n\\nI HIGHLY recommend this restaurant as a Californian who knows their Italian food and it a massive foodie.\\n\\n**As a side note to those morons complaining about the portion size, this is a family style restaurant.

We tried to go to Muqueca Restaurant but it was packed even at 8:30 p.m. so we went to this place instead.  \\n\\nSo here's the thing.  I had never been to a brazilian bbq. place before but I had a general idea of what to expect and meat-wise it lived up to my expectations.  You sit down and then they say ok it's 25$ for your meal and it's all you can eat.  They come around with sticks of roasted meats of every assortment and cut it off the slab right onto your plate.  And the meat is damn good.  I will say that.  The lamb, sausage, beef, and even the chicken wrapped in bacon were all delicious.  The sides were lacking, however.  \\n\\nThey have a little buffet with sides like rice, wings, salad, bread, and even french fries.  I was not overly impressed with the quality of anything from the buffet, in fact it all seemed kinda crappy.  Considering I was paying $25 I was hoping for a nice side of green beans or Asparagus or something but I had to settle for white rice.  Oh well.  \\n\\nThe dining room had a nice ambiance to it, the lights were dimmed and there was a musician playing some soft Brazilian music that was mildly reminiscent of Seau-George from the life aquatic (but not nearly as good of course), and it was a really nice touch to have the live music.  \\n\\nAll in all, even though the meat was delicious and it was a fun experience I think you can find a much better meal somewhere else in Boston for $25. (drinks are extra and tip too so it ends up being closer to 70ish for just 2 people).  Oh and the service is kind of slow in the sense that yes there are constantly people coming to your table with slabs of meet for you but it's a little harder to get a refill on your drink because there's only a couple actual servers.  Also my date said her Margarita wasn't very good.\\n\\np.s. When it's somebodies birthday they go off the wazoo and start flashing the lights on and off and they even bring the kitchen staff in and start banging pots and pans.

Casablanca also has an extended variety of wines which include various selections of reds and whites which are all reasonably priced but the most exciting aspect to your drinking experience at Casablanca has to their specialty cocktail menu. \\n\\nI sampled the pepper rum punch made with Goslings rum, house made black pepper syrup, pineapple juice and rocks which was tasty but their Pisco Sour stole the show. The Pisco Sour is made with Pisco, lemon, sugar, egg white and bitters. It's pretty intimidating knowing that you're about to drink raw egg whites but man did that star shine brightly! Sweet, sour and bitter all mixed together in perfect harmony. A balanced and perfectly combined beverage that ended with smooth cloud-like, savory finish. I highly recommend the Pisco Sour, so don't be a baby and Andrew Zimmern that shiz to your face!!!\\n\\n\\nStage 2, Appetizers - Oh my my my, this place knows how to put it together. I got the Pei Mussells prepared with sherry lobster broth with an island of grilled crostini bread topped with lobster salad. They offer extra servings of crusty bread to mop up all the leftover love. The muscles were sweet and tender, cooked perfectly in spectacular broth and the lobster salad that sat on top of the grilled pieces of crostini were out of this world delicious. Another thing I noticed was that they left a bottle of extra virgin olive oil, with sides of salt and pepper in which to season your plate when dipping a helping of that amazingly crusty bread, mmmmnnnnn. I notice small details and that tells me that they know what they're doing. \\n\\nThe other appetizer I sampled was their crispy mushroom and goat cheese cigars served with a baby arugula salad which was tossed to perfection. The dish had a garlic tahini dipping sauce to dip the earthy and crispy (not over fried) cigars, which were oh so delicious. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is refined, yet causal and they also have a great jukebox.

They do a decent job, but you can tell that they're harried.

Restaurants that have wine-and-beer licenses are not allowed to serve you alcohol unless you also buy food.  In order to sell a glass of wine alone, an establishment has to have a full liquor license -- which is MUCH more expensive and MUCH harder to get, especially in Beacon Hill, where the neighborhood has fought new liquor licenses tooth and nail (it took Toscana like 4 years to get one).\\n\\nSo, yes, it's annoying.

We showed up for drinks and an app and then planned on jumping to another bar to do the same. Bar #2 was packed and had a waiting list, TenOak had about 20 people in their place. From the first step in the place, my expectations started dropping.  The whole bar smelled like it was mopped with a moldy mop.  The scent was typical of any dirty 6th St bar.  Speaking of, Bourbon Girl on 6th is a better option as far as bourbon selection, because this selection was pretty weak. We got a table and were greeted by a friendly waitress.  The table was sticky like it was wiped down with a bar rag.  We pushed through the issues because it was 9pm and were hungry.  We ordered a house cab wine and an old fashioned.  The wine either was old and had turned or was a really bad selection for their Cab.  The old fashioned was made by muddling the cherries, orange and sugar cube, then shaken with the bourbon.  End result, there were small bits of sugar on the bottom of the drink and was filled with air bubbles.  The presentation for this classic drink came across more like a cheap shot than a great drink.  Our two apps - Smoked tomato hummus and pulled pork bourbon bbq nachos.  The hummus was spot on, great flavor.  The nachos were really weak.  The bbq pork was most definitely food service grade right out of a plastic bag.  The chef forgot to garnish the dish and the waitress didn't catch it.  It came out with chips, chees and a blob of pork.  It was missing the jalapenos, onions, tomatoes and the salsa was in a plastic ramekin.  Overall, the place lacked the character of a bourbon bar, and what was left was totally lost on the food and cheap drinks.  I wouldn't go back, sorry, the experience wasn't worth it.  On a side note, their neighbor has a $12 old fashioned that was spot on, amazing and worth the price.

We were seated at a large table in front of the windows looking out on to 3rd, and directly in front of the sushi prep space. They have some amazing happy hour deals - affordable appetizers, $3 for small sake, $4-5 glasses of wine, and several draft beers for $3 (including local breweries)!  Outside of the happy hour deals, there are also weeknight dinner specials, and for Tuesday it was BOGO free specialty rolls! I had the dumplings for an appetizer ($4) and chose shrimp as my filling. The shrimp dumplings are much smaller than the veggie or pork variety, and I think I actually liked the pork version better. I also partook of the BOGO specialty rolls - a sunny roll and an alaskan volcano roll.  It ended up being a LOT of food, but it was really tasty. The alaskan roll was presented in a circle with a big pile of crab salad on top. The spicy mayo was a bit rich, but I really enjoyed it. The quality of the sushi here is commendable. \\n\\nWe had a very attentive server, and she did a great job of handling all of our orders and refilling our water glasses. My only critique is that there were three menus; 1 for happy hour, 1 for regular dinner menu, and 1 for sushi rolls. It might be easier to combine the happy hour and regular menu onto one, as it was tough to keep everything straight. I liked that you can order your sushi on a paper list where you just place the quantity next to what you want. I put my name on it, and was glad I did when she brought out my rolls and I couldn't remember the names of the rolls that I had chosen... \\n\\nThis building is super funky and cool, and I love the big windows.

I don't understand complaints about not having enough waiters - it's a self-serve situation, for the most part.  There's no need for a lot of waiters.  The service is attentive but not intrusive, and some people may not be used to that, but I find it much more pleasant than the over-enthusiastic experience found in some restaurants.  \\n\\nAbove all, it's authentic (as far as possible in the US) - I've been to Genghis Grill because it's so much closer to the house, and while it's fine enough, it's basically a cartoon version of Mongolian food.  They serve tortillas (?!?) with the food instead of sesame bread.  I almost cried the first time I saw that.  Here, you go in, put together your bowl, stand there while it's cooked, go back to your table and eat.  Simple and easy.  The food is, of course, amazing.  Mongolian BBQ is, along with Arab food, my absolute favorite - but  of course, it's what you make of it.  For example, there have been times I messed up my sauce and made it too salty or too gingery etc., but that was my doing, not theirs.  I love the little breads - I open the top and make little pita style sandwiches - and they also have both brown and white rice and a bunch of kinds of noodles.

Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty happy with the old reliables, but one can only chase beers with semi-stale popcorn at Nomad for so long. Contigo feels magical to me. I love the space. I think their drink menu is fantastic. The ambiance is surprisingly pleasant. The service has been really friendly, albeit a little slow sometimes, and both the bar manager and who I believe is the FOH manager appear to be passionate about their jobs and truly invested in ensuring this restaurant succeeds. These are all qualities that make me want to frequent a place over and over again.\\n\\nThe one thing that detracts from this awesomeness is the food. I am fortunate to have friends and a boyfriend who are not only willing to be adventurous when choosing dishes, but who also eat a lot.  With that being said, I have tried almost everything on the menu. Most of it is good; a couple things were better than good, but nothing was exceptional. My biggest concern is too few options for main entrees. I don't know if Contigo will necessarily be my first go-to for dinner, but it's definitely at the very top of my list to drink and share small plates.  \\n\\nMy hunch is Contigo is going to do very, very well. Even in these early stages while there is understandably still growing pains, they're rocking. My hopes are that they expand the menu (and especially make it more vegetarian friendly), figure out a way to make their beautiful patio more shaded, and possibly consider adding misters (although that may be super far-fetched due to the perpetual drought Texas is in; I don't know how much water is wasted through misters).\\n\\nContigo, unfortunately for you I am a reasonable person (most of the time), therefore I will not be gracing your presence on a nightly basis.

Then Chicken Satay tacos were good and tasted just as I expected them to. \\n\\nThe sliders were awesome as well. Having tried the Banh Mi taco already, it's slider counterpart wasn't too special. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but I was looking forward to trying a bit of everything. The Crab Cake slider was out of this world good.

I can pop deviled eggs in my mouth like chips, and these are no exception. Can't go wrong with the bacon on top, either! Each order comes with 4.\\n* Honey rosemary fried chicken. Easily an entr√©e portion size, 2 fried boneless chicken thighs in a thick honey sauce with a crusty biscuit alongside. I was stuffed after finishing this.\\n\\nService is on point, and they're even kind enough to remind you of last call with a cowbell.

They both were full of meat, lettuce, & tomatoes.  The potatoes on the plates seemed as if they had been quartered and baked then put in the pan for a quick browning.  The re-fried beans were a bit on the watery/runny side.  I like my re-fried beans a little thicker so that they don't run out of the burrito or taco.  Now the tortillas, they seemed to be of a processed variety.  They aren't like a store bought tortilla that is already been cooked on the griddle but like the type that is dough ready to cook.

However, when I did attend the grand opening for dinner, I was disappointed by not only the food, but the poor service as well. I do however give credit to the aesthetically pleasing decor. \\nMy first impression when walking into Gen Sou En was quite puzzling. I was confused of the entire concept because the business was running both as a cafe and a restaurant all in one, which probably explains their lack of good customer service, efficiency, and quality. I had to order my food first at the cashier, then somehow find an empty table to set my number down, and then have someone find me to give me my order, which all made it seem like a fast-food restaurant. I had the great pleasure of giving my order to the manager, who you would think knows the ins and outs of the business, and knows what they are doing, but guess again...The manager seemed extremely distracted, which I understand is due to the grand opening, but it got the point where I had to repeat my order multiple times to him because he wasn't paying attention at all. It came off a bit rude to me and he kept darting his eyes all over the place. In my opinion, the menu came off quite limited and I think they need to expand it much more. I ordered the Umami tea, the Grilled Broccoli Rabe and Salmon Roe Temaki, and the Karaage and Pork Katsu Teishoku, and the total came out to be around $50 or so. After repeating my order to the manager multiple times, he gave me my receipt and thankfully I checked it. He had gotten half my order wrong and instead gave me a Salmon Sashimi Temaki and 2 Chicken Katsu Teishoku. Like I said previously, I understand this was opening day and there was room for mistakes, but I think what made me upset was that he wasn't paying attention to me in the first place, which is why I wasn't surprised at all when I saw that my order was wrong. Because he is the manager, I don't think he should have been running one of the two cashiers. He should instead be managing and overseeing the entire business, and making sure things are running smoothly for both employees and customers. I went back to speak with the manager about my order and he offered to pay for my meal if I kept the wrong order, which I did not like the idea of because he wasn't trying to handle the situation at all. I would rather eat what I paid for in the first place. What made me even more upset was that he didn't apologize for the mistake and he didn't even check up on our table later on to see if our order came out okay. \\nThe green tea came out first, which wasn't impressive at all. Just a normal green tea that tasted like something from Tazo to be very frank. Then came the two Temaki, which no surprise, was wrong and small in portion. The Salmon Roe I wanted was not ordered and they gave us the Salmon Sashimi yet again. The Grilled Broccoli Rabe was utterly terrible. Please don't order it...It was literally a piece of broccoli wrapped in seaweed and rice, and seasoned with something very distasteful and sour. To top off the sour taste, it was so cold! Finally came the two Teishoku, which was also wrong because they didn't give me the Kaarage I had ordered and instead gave us the two, Pork Katsu styled bento boxes. When my Kaarage finally came, the presentation of the food was not pleasing at all and didn't look anything like their Instagram or photos from their website. The rice looked and tasted like a cold, dense rock, the \\"vegetable-side\\" was an absolute joke because it came with little, cold pellets of cauliflower, thinly-sliced carrots, and some radish. I had one bite and stopped eating it because it again, tasted oddly sour. Lastly, the kaarage and the miso soup were so-so and I have tasted much better elsewhere. I had no clue what I was eating and after I finished, I was still hungry, but didn't want to go through another hassle of ordering more. I wanted to give Gen Sou En one last chance and order dessert. There was only one selection of rolled cake and it was just sitting there looking lifeless, dry, and unappetizing, so no way was I ordering it and spending more money. \\nTherefore, I believe that Gen Sou En needs to greatly improve on its business operations and determine what they need to truly focus on before trying to do everything at once. The whole vibe was off because there were people studying/working with laptops and tablets and then there were people dining with their family/friends. They also had pre-made food for people to buy, which made the quality of the menu appear low in quality and not fresh. Unfortunately, I will never go back to Gen Sou En again because this past experience was something I don't want to go through again. In my opinion, \\"authentic, Japanese Tea House\\" isn't an accurate way to describe their business at all because they are quite the opposite."},{"name":"Pinotti's Pizza¬Æ","address":"1201 Winter Garden Vineland Rd, Ste 6-A","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"Brazilian pizza, like most wonderful arts Brazilians have absorbed via immigrants from across the globe, transformed with their flavors, and re-presented with their customary joy to the world, is a pleasant and refreshing surprise for those accustomed to the well-explored battlefields of the American pizza wars. Pinotti's, at least from my experience as an estrangeiro, is an authentic experience, and honors the values of providing good food, a family first ethic, and a mix of authentic traditional flavors with a flair for experimentation that impresses. \\nI visited on a Tuesday evening, when Pinotti's offers a unlimited 'rodizio' service, which is similar to what you may be familiar with at Brazilian steakhouse, where servers continually offer you slices of signature pies, such as the calabreza, which is thinly sliced sausage and onion, margherita, which is tomato and basil, and portuguesa, which is an import from their colonizers which has an interesting combination of eggs, ham and peas. The ingredients Pinotti's tops it's pies with are top notch, impressively savory and subtle, which complements a fine, slightly crispy crust that makes experimenting all the flavors an adventure, not a challenge. \\nTheir space is small, and the offering on Tuesdays after 6pm seems to have gained quite a following, especially with the added attraction of a lively acoustic show offering nostalgic hits in prtuguese and english, so make a reservation if you are serious about finding an authentic taste from Brazil and a twist on an otherwise well-worn cuisine. \\nMy wife said she felt like she did in Brazil 25 years ago.

At first I thought that was it, so I was a bit disappointed.\\n\\nBut then I noticed they have a huge wall of baked goods on the other side of the room! And it's Japanese style, so you grab a tray and some tongs and just load up on anything that looks good. It all smelled so fresh and it was so soft to the touch. There is a huge bakery behind the counter, sort of hidden by a wall when you come in so I didn't see it at first, and they were pulling bread out of the oven. \\n\\nI just filled a bag with baked goods to nibble on during the day, and they were excellent.

On the contrary, would entering an empty restaurant give you the opposite feeling?  Today, we strolled into \\"HML Seafood Restaurant\\" on No.3 Road in Richmond and were surprised by the half vacant seating they had at around lunch time.  Now, HML is obviously not a high-end restaurant, nor a nice one, but I would categorize it as a higher-end budget friendly Chinese joint.  The venue itself is decorated quite nicely, but you can tell that the utensils and tableware have worn quite old.  There is no tea charge at HML, and it is 20% off dim sum every single day. \\n\\nAfter several minutes of contemplation, we quickly decided on six favorite dishes which are musts when ordering dim sum.\\n\\n Steamed Rice Rolls with Scallop - $4.95 (4.5/7)\\nThe noodle roll was soft, chewy, and cooked to perfection (though not many restaurants can screw this dish up).  While the tender scallops complemented the dish impeccably, the unmentioned corn kernels did not. \\n\\nSteamed Rice Rolls Stuffed with Chinese Donut Topped with Shredded Pork - $4.95 (5.25/7)\\nThis was probably our favorite dish.  The tangy Hoisen (Seafood) Sauce definitely suited the delicious combination of the tender rice noodle wrap and savoury deep fried bread.  It was dusted on top with pork floss, which is a processed dried meat product with a light and fluffy texture.\\n\\nSteamed Turnip Cake with Preserved Meat - $3.95 (5.5/7)\\nNormally we would order fried turnip cake (served with Hoisen Sauce) or stir-fry XO Sauce turnip cake, but we decided to try something new today.  The dish was pleasantly oil free with a nice aroma of green onions and dried meat.  Though plain, it is definitely something that we will reorder.\\n\\n Superior Steamed Shrimp Dumplings - $4.25 (5/7)\\nThese plump dumplings taste especially good when you dip them in the sweet soy sauce provided with the Rice Noodle Roll dishes.  The dumplings at HML tasted pretty much the same as the ones that you can get at Fisherman's Terrace (Aberdeen) or Shi-Art (Richmond Centre), so we were quite content with them.  The size of the dumplings were on the bigger side and the dumpling skin's thickness was just right.\\n\\n Steamed Custard Bun - $3.95 (5/7)\\nWhen it came down to dessert, we really had to ruminate before ordering.  Dim sum offers a plethora of delectable desserts which makes it extremely hard to choose.  Contemplating between the egg custard tarts and the egg yolk custard buns, we finally decided with the buns because of the cold weather.  The steamed bun itself was fresh and moist while the filling was nice and viscous.  Our favorite part about this dessert was that it was not too sweet at all!\\n\\n Baked Tapioca Pudding Stuffed with Sesame Paste - $3.75 (4.75/7)\\nThis is a classic Chinese dessert shrunk down to dim sum sized portion.  The top is covered by a baked pineapple bun crust while the inside is comprised of a thick gooey tapioca pudding with a tantalizing sesame paste at the bottom.  As much as this is one of our favorite desserts, HML simply did not make it well enough.  I must admit that it was delicious, but we have had much better elsewhere. \\n\\nThat concludes our short dim sum lunch!  The bill ended up coming to $26 after tax and tip.  We walked out extremely full and reasonably satisfied.  It would be worthwhile to accentuate that the majority of the staff here do not speak English.  Thankfully, they do have an English/Chinese scantron type of ordering sheet where you can tick off the dishes you want and simply hand it to the server.   \\n\\nRatings:\\n\\nFood: 4/7\\n\\nValue: 4.5/7\\n\\nService: 4.5/7\\n\\n**Cash or Interac only**"},{"name":"Brigham Circle Chinese Food","address":"728 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Have had take-out here quite a few times since my original review & thought I'd do an update... the food has actually gotten much better over time...I like the chicken chow mein combo with beef teriyaki & crab rangoons (not the best rangoons out there, but they'll do in a pinch).

Food came at quite a good pace, but a little slower than what I have experienced at the Quincy Applebees. My food was dried as sh!t and I had to request gravy or some sauce just to moist my food (ordered the steak tips with mash potatoes and onion rings on top). The onion rings were not crunchy and were soaked in grease. The guests on the other table waited for more than an hour to be seated and for food to come out and they were heated and the table behind me had their orders mixed up with other patrons. First, I think mgmt needs to be retrained on how to manage a restaurant and how the kitchen functions, as when foods comes out,the servers are all taking random dishes and serving their customers. It was chaotic and unorganized restaurant/establishment. Pretty much the kitchen is hurting the servers on their performances and obviously they will be tipped less due to the unorganized kitchen.

When a dine originals coupon was offered I thought, this is my chance to finally go. Unfortunately I could not have been more disappointed. \\n\\nWe arrive, I was expecting some sort of travel back in time in the d√©cor based on the sign and things I have heard about the place. I was taken back to what appeared to be a 1980s remodel that looked nothing more than dingy today. The bar looked a little classic but was hard to tell because of the L shape and difficulty to get in there and have a look.\\n\\nThe service = 1 Star. We got an older lady, which some may say adds to the experience to get an older server who has been there years with a little crass, I would agree with these people. But this person seemed bitter and possibly just started there a few months ago. First, she asks what we would like to drink, I ask \\"do you have any drink specials\\", (we had an early dinner, thought I may be catching happy hour at 615pm) before I could finish my sentence she started in with the daily dinner specials, which I wouldn't mind if we hadn't finished ordering drinks yet and that she cut me off. I just get a mixed drink and water. \\n\\nNext she brings the drink, the plus side my drink was perfectly mixed Jack and Coke, I thought they may have some sort of classic cocktail but since I wasn't able to get that far in my ordering, I just went with that. My pregnant wife's teeth have become more sensitive to cold over the last month or so, she asks the server for straws (for her ice water). She gives us a sigh and returns with straws, holding two stir straws by the top, with the palm of her hand. It takes a lot for me to get disgusted with food/drink preparation, but holding the straws where we were supposed to put our mouths with her bare hands and then shoving them in our drinks was RIDICULOUS and just gross. \\n\\nNext our food order. My wife is gluten intolerant, she wanted a salad, and needed to know what was on it (croutons, etc...) she started to ask and the server cut her off with a snark \\"listen all it is lettuce with a cucumber on top\\". Fine, way to get us excited to order salad. We order our steak; we again get cut-off before we can finish and she answers us incorrectly and then gets pissy because we then finish our question. (Seriously there are only so many questions one could ask, couldn't you just wait until we finish talking) Next we finish out order and sit. (we both order $30 steaks, medium and medium well)\\n\\nShe doesn't come back to check on us once before the food comes out.\\n\\nThe food. My steak was cooked medium just like I asked, but it was completely burnt around the edges, I did not want to eat charred meat and for the price so I didn't eat 1/4  of it. The taste was incredibly underwhelming. There was ZERO flavor, so much so that I wanted to ask for steak sauce just to be disrespectful, but I didn't to be nice for some reason.\\nMy wife's steak was undercooked and yet was still burnt around the edges, again no flavor, we both thought it was one of the worst steaks we have ever had. \\n\\nWe didn't say anything, we didn't really have a chance, although the place was almost empty she never came back until it was time for the bill (even with one of her two tables she had was right beside us, she managed them just fine and my attempts to waive down were either not seen or ignored). We had also decided to never come back so there really wasn't too much they could have done. (fyi our \\"coupon\\" saved us $7.50). At this point we wanted to leave asap, to catch our movie. The server then takes FOREVER to cash us out and we miss our movie.\\n\\nThis was for our 3rd anniversary. \\n\\nTerrible experience.\\n\\nThis place may have been THE place at some point, I am sure many people still rave about it, but I wonder if they rave for the actually food/service or just for the nostalgia .\\n\\nI have read that the owner has wanted to close the place, tear it down and build a condo high rise there, it certainly appears that the restaurant is a low priority."},{"name":"Bangkok Bistro","address":"433 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Best damn asian restraunt in all of brighton - whether its the noodles, rice, or meats, everything is a must-have.

They were out of all the Van Winkle except the $90/shot one, which is understandable considering it's distilled by a mad genius and impossible to find. I ordered the chicken and waffles but apparently it couldn't do the \\"waffle\\" part so I had waffle flavored pancakes and chicken. \\n\\nSome of the problems may have been an expectations mismatch. I got the chicken and waffles, like I said, but it was three little bits of chicken and three very thin waffle-esque pancakes, all perfectly serviceable but I'm a little ghetto and I want some chicken and goddamn waffles, if you know what I mean, not the little appetizer-type food I got. At least it was cheap. We also ordered the BBQ pork nachos and it was pretty good, but they'd let them sit for a little while and everything congealed into a lukewarm mess. Like if I got some tortilla chips and shredded cheese and pulled pork down at the HEB and tossed it all together in the microwave, that's the quality of what I got. Nothing wrong with it, but I wanted a little more oomph and a little more care than something I'd toss together in my own kitchen. \\n\\nMinor complaint, but we sat outside as the sun was going down and they kept the lights low. We swiftly transitioned from atmosphere to cozy to just effing dark. \\n\\nThe summary of my experience would be: I spent more time looking longingly at the churro and Cuban sandwich food truck across the way than I did eating the food.

Twice for breakfast and twice for dinner. I have eaten eggs with homefries and toast, multiple dessert, fries, black bean veggie burgers, potatoes, etc. However, that is separate from my review. \\n\\nFirstly, I love the atmosphere here, not so much the hipsters, but the actual d√©cor. It's reminds me of an 80's diner and the music selection is generally good too. However, the food isn't as lovely. Not just because it upsets my tummy, but because it is sub-par. I have been to a few vegan places in and around Boston and this one is just so- so. In fact,  they mainly thrive because of the hipster vibe and lack of other vegan choices around Central Square. Even the desserts, which I have had a year ago and were pretty good, are just now lackluster and taste worse than something I would buy in a store pre-made. Maybe they have a new cook, or maybe they just don't care because business is booming. \\n\\nOverall, I just can't recommend this place unless you are really into the vibe or just crave vegan food and don't want to go to Grasshopper or some other place that is most likely better.

The Egg Rolls were almost $5 and they were two of those tiny rolls, and there was nothing special about them, especially to be priced so high.  The General Gao's Chicken was pretty much inedible.  They were extremely small pieces of chicken with excessive batter and probably just way overcooked.  It was impossible to bite into them or even chew them because they were super dry and stringy and just terrible.  To make things worse, they basically took a container full of rice and put some chicken on top.  If this was their lunch special, fine; but this is supposed to a dinner entree.  The Chow Fuun had zero flavor and was pretty much mush by the time I got home.  Also more noodles than meat and vegetables and very little flavor.

It was one of the more busy/chaotic nights in the North End due to the Fisherman's Feast, but the owner fit us in for an 8pm reservation at what I think is the best seat in the house, right by the windows (which are open during the summer weather). The owner went out of his way to make sure that my party had an incredible dining experience, and boy was it incredible! The hostess was very sweet when I arrived and said who I was, and our server, John, treated us like royalty the whole evening. The owner, who was also cooking on this night, prepared some of the most delicious food I have had while dining out, and we did not leave hungry! I lost count at some point, but I think our server brought us 7 or 8 \\"piattini\\", plus individual servings of the Chilean Sea Bass.

That should tell you all you need to know - I almost never use salt in restaurants, and I've never asked for salt before in a high end restaurant.

You can do nothing else but salt it. \\n\\nThis is a 2 star review instead of 1 star for 2 reasons - service is good, and I don't like to give 1 star for a single visit (I've been to American Cut twice, but the first time was just for drinks and we didn't eat).

It's my go-to baseball-watching bar during the playoffs. As you probably know, no one in Austin cares about baseball. During the week, it's easy to grab a picnic table outside and get the server to turn on whatever game you want to watch. I even showed up during a UT football game one night and was able to get one of the TVs turned to baseball.\\n\\n2. Their food is so unhealthy, but they do it so well. Doesn't matter what it is -- deep-fried pickles, queso, fried mushrooms, burgers, chicken fried steak. It's all good. Seriously.\\n\\n3. Their food and drinks are super cheap, I can't even believe it. I can spend an entire evening there, watching sports, eating and drinking and get out for $15-$20, for like 3-4 hours of recreation.

Line was already there as expected based on reviews. Waited until about 1:05pm. Lines forms outside the place and once you get indoor, theres another winding 2 line left to get to the front. You can buy beer in a different line also inside the store but you don't really have to wait in line for that. Most people get beer and come back to wait in line to go back in. \\nSo now it's my time to order. After debating and looking at the same menu several times while in line. \\nOrdering is quick and they wrap the meat up while you order. Still not sure why BBQ lines take forever. But there only 2 people working when you order. 1 cashier and 1 the bbq meat slicer. Then like 2-3 other in the back. \\n\\nDecided the following:\\nFood: \\n¬º pound brisket and  1/2 pound pork ribs. Heard the beef ribs were good by another local, and saw that it was a really big 1 beef rib, also priced by market price and by pound. \\nI decided to go for the pork ribs as I was eating alone and just wanted the ribs. \\nAlso got a side of onions and 1 bun. BBQ on the tables where you sit to eat at. \\nTo the meaty details:\\nBrisket - not too fatty, but there was a definite later of fat. The top layer of the brisket was seasoned well and cooked to the point that it was getting crispy to beef jerky status, but not quite. The rest of the brisket was moist and juicy, not dry at all. Flavor was present but I felt it needed some help with the bbq sauce, but together was good. \\n\\nBBQ sauce- they have like 2 types. 1 sauce that looks more orange is the spicy one and the brow bbq looking is more of a tangy sweet bbq sauce. I prefer the spicer bbq sauce all the way, after tasting both. \\n\\nNow back to the brisket. Compared to the best brisket I have tasted, which is over in Phoeniz AZ, I would say the brisket here is a above average rating. Try it if it's what you got., but I wasn't too blown away by it. \\n\\nNow moving to the PORK RIBS. \\nTASTY tasty tasty. Fall off the bone meat for sure. As it, this ribs were good and had the smoky flavor. However, with the spicy orange bbq sauce. Game changer. In terms of ribs by itself, this place is up there on my list that I have tried so far, maybe #1. Best flavor were some ribs I had in Brooklyn, NY (Ya I Know.).

Well, Clay's wings are particularly large and crispy to start with, but for the garlic parmesan they roll them in straight garlic powder before frying, giving them a solid garlic crust.  Then, as soon as they come out from the hot oil, they dump a pile of grated parmesan cheese on top.

So we made our way here this morning at 9am so we could get in line for their famous beef ribs. We were the 2nd group to arrive. We asked them how this worked and they said that typically people sit around on the benches and then eventually make their way into a formed line. A family showed up shortly after. Then, about 30 minutes after that, a bunch of people arrived, saw that we were already there and immediately began to line up outside of the truck. Maybe that is how it works, but I thought that was rude. We were clearly there earlier and should have had some sort of dibs. \\n\\nAnyway, as we waited the line got ridiculously long and they busted out the free beer. Nothing helps people kill time in a line better than beer =)\\n\\nWhen it was our turn, we ordered 2 beef ribs and a pound of brisket. The brisket was really good. I'd definitely say it's in the top ranks of brisket I've had. That being said, I haven't had a lot of brisket in my life. This was really enjoyable though!\\n\\nHowever, eating the beef rib was definitely an earth shaking, life altering, transcendent experience. It was juicy and fatty and beefy and incredible. After having a bite of the beef rib, I couldn't go back and eat more brisket. I hear that they only make 12 racks of ribs (with 3 ribs each) every day so it is SO worth it to come early and snag one of these ribs. They are huge (about 1.5 pounds) so be sure to prepare yourself. \\n\\nTips for the wait: Come at about 9:30am. Be prepared for the heat (wear comfortable clothes, have a fan, have a cold drink).

In most cases this will cause the last couple bites of any meal to be the BEST! In Noodles and Company, my system fails miserably for one reason. The outside noodles of my Truffle Mac and Cheese were wet and bare. yuck. Leaving the inside bites, the middle, to be overly cheesy. One would think that overly cheesy is a good thing.

Seriously, I don't even like Brussels sprouts and I could eat these every day they are that good. Crisp and delicious flavor! I would go simply for the Brussel sprouts alone!

I started out with a pot of the Japanese cherry blossom tea, which was light and refreshing, a perfect spring time tea. Next time I go in I'll have to ask where they get the tea from. For dinner my husband and I split an order of the ginger orange chicken. The serving was large enough for the two of us and came with rice and steamed broccoli. The chicken itself was crispy coated but moist on the inside. The sauce was tangy with just a bit of a kick, definitely puts Panda Express to shame. Overall the food was delicious and the price, around $13 for the chicken and just a few bucks for the pot of tea, was fair for what we got. The waitress that helped us was wonderful, she even double checked that the food we ordered did not contain an ingredient I'm deathly allergic to. I will definitely be returning and I'll recommend it to my friends."},{"name":"India Pavilion","address":"17 Central Sq","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here mostly for the lunch buffet, and once for dinner. Their lunch buffet is priced really affordably and the food definitely hits the spot when the craving for lots of Indian food hits me.\\n\\nAs other reviewers have already noted, the naan is very good. They do make it fresh and it shows. Since I go to buffets mostly for the meats, I will only comment on the meat dishes. Their meat selection is also just decent. They almost always have Chicken Tika Masala and Tandoori Chicken. Then it's usually some other curry-like meat that is the selection for the day. The last time I went, they had goat curry. Generally, the meats are pretty tender. If you go later in the day, the tandoori chicken tends to be a bit dry. The best is when you are able to get it when it first comes out of the kitchen. I'm always full hen I leave, but I do wish that they had more meats for the buffet (or even fish!). I'd be willing to pay more for that.\\n\\nService has been pretty good the times that I've been there.

But their food is really good! The reason behind that - first couple of times we came to this location was specifically for the cheesesteaks. Amazing! It's been hard to find a really solid cheesesteak in Portland, as far as my preferences go. But I really loved this one. The prime rib is great, gooey american cheese and peppers. Loved it. However...\\n\\nThe last time we called in to order it to-go, we were told they were no longer serving them or the prime rib dinners. Whaaat. Apparently it's too expensive, and I get it. But that really sucks as far as I'm concerned. I have no issue with them not serving the slabs of prime rib. We had that once as well. What a time warp. It was over well done, not a hint of pink, not terribly tender, slightly dry and no au jus! Served with a simple baked potato and iceberg lettuce salad. If I was a trucker coming back home from a long haul, that would be my celebratory meal. Obviously the place has a blue-collar feel/theme, so that's where my mind went. Unfortunately absolutely nothing special about it. But chop that up and turn it into a cheesesteak? Magic. \\n\\nSo I'm disappointed that they would take something so delicious away from me. And that they still have not updated their online menu to reflect this. What a tease. But the beer battered house fries are awesome, as are the burgers and Freebird chicken sandwich.

I usually just eat and check in the bathroom mirror that I don't have an entire tomato slice on my face and leave because life is short and food is usually delicious and why get worked up over small portions or a long wait or a errant waterbug falling into your pad thai?\\n\\nBut I had to write a review for this place because it was the worst dining experience I've ever had.\\n\\nI walked in Cobblestone with a friend on a sunny September Saturday afternoon. I was craving a burger. First off, there's 1-2 people in line behind a chatty Kathy talking/flirting with a young man right in front of the cashier. Cashier is part of the convo. Figuring they were in line, I stand behind everyone and wait my turn. 5 minutes later, the couple look up, see the line and move SLIGHTLY over. I realize that the young man works at Cobblestone and this chick is like a friend who was loudly inviting him to go watch her DJ that night or something. I'm on edge. They're disrespectful of people's time.\\n\\nWhen I finally order, the cashier dully enters in the order (Juicy Lucy - gouda stuffed burger - for me and a grilled cheese for my friend). Doesn't say hi, doesn't make eye contact, doesn't ask if it's take-out or eat-in. I figure he watched us settle at the counter like we were going to eat there. We sit and wait. Then, because we had just been wandering around Boston, I went to ask for a tap water. Girl DJ and Cobblestone Youth are back to chatting in front of the cashier and yet again, do not move until I loudly clear my throat. Cashier (again not meeting my eyes) then sullenly informs me that they charge for cups. I'm irked but pay him for stupid tap water in a stupid Earth-killing Styrofoam cup with no lid.\\n\\n15 minutes later, our order is ready. They have helpfully packed up our order to go. We were eating there. I was even more annoyed when I opened the bag and saw that they stuffed my burger into the SMALLEST plastic container known to man. (My friend's grilled cheese they put in a nice big paper box, what gives?) It's so small that when I open the lid, chopped wilted lettuce goes flying all over the counter and I cannot figure out how to get the thing out, save sticking my hand in there and digging the burger out. I figure they'd charge me to use their bathroom (didn't see one so I assumed it was back behind the counter) so I went for the plastic fork and knife approach. \\n\\nThis burger is stuffed so hard into the container that I'm struggling to cut through the layers and they come spewing out as I try to gently tug pieces out of the container. First bites and this burger is gross. Tasteless, top bun is soggy, no harmony of flavor (to be fair, most of the meat and bottom bun stayed in the container), and the kicker: the burger wasn't stuffed with cheese at all! It has but a layer of plasticky gouda plastered to the patty. Considering I just spent over $14 for a CHEESE STUFFED burger and tap water without fries, I was just done. I threw the plastic utensils down, stood up, and walked away. I left the sodden mess that Cobblestone calls a burger on the counter. \\n\\nI should have complained but I didn't feel like standing in line behind Girl DJ and Cobblestone Youth for the third time. I should have said something about the packaging, how you can't put hot or warm sandwiches in closed boxes without the steam turning them wet and soggy. I should have mentioned to someone we were clearly eating there so why are they giving us excessive packaging and ruining our food. But everything about the whole Cobblestone experience was so, so irritating, dismissive, and just plain stupid that I couldn't find it in myself to bother.\\n\\nPlease stay away. Please let these people know that to start a good restaurant, they need to work on common sense, customer relations, and how to positively present their food and brand. I just.

I've had my share of hits and misses here:\\n\\nSteak, cheese & onion sub - I've gotten this twice and thought it was gross both times. Completely lacking in flavor. \\n\\nSausage parmesan calzone - HUGE and tasty. A small provided me with three meals.\\n\\nBaked haddock - very good, slightly breaded\\n\\nGrilled salmon - very good too, usually I order either this or the haddock\\n\\nTeriyaki steak tips -nicely flavored, but way too difficult to chew. I actually thought I would choke.\\n\\nGrilled chicken - I don't know what they marinate this in, but it is so good. Great to repurpose on a salad the next day. \\n\\nChicken, broccoli, ziti - I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. It was way too greasy and rich.\\n\\nMashed potatoes - flavorless, even with the gravy\\n\\nRice pilaf/broccoli - hard to mess these up, they are generally my go to sides\\n\\nBrownie - HEAVEN. They keep them on the counter when you go to pick up your food. I actually get delivery most of the time just to avoid the temptation of these brownies. SO GOOD. \\n\\nDelivery is prompt, I've never had a problem with them taking too long. I've also never experienced the rude phone service some people mentioned. Both on the phone and in person, service has always been friendly. \\n\\nEntrees come with a dinner roll, which I really like. It is just like a sub roll, but, hey, I love my carbs. They are also big enough to give you 2+ meals.\\n\\nPat's is good, not great. I'll continue going here whenever I'm too lazy to cook for myself and just want a meal in my own home.

Service was subpar, got seated and ignored for 20 minutes until I asked a server that kept passing by us if she knew who our server was, her response was I don't know who your server is, who did they tell you it was? After further investigation, she was our server.  It was my dad's Birthday dinner and honestly I was embarrassed and disappointed that I chose to bring him there. They had limited dishes, I am a vegetarian and asked if they can make something meatless since they had nothing on the limited buffet that I can eat other than lettuce and I wasn't going to pay $20 for lettuce. They got the manager and after she laughed so hard, she told the server at the buffet no tell her to eat lettuce! Wooooowwwwwww, how professional and accommodating! The place didn't have traditional PR dishes, for example they had bacon rice and lasagna but no pernil or tostones, maduros or empanadas in the buffet? Last I knew lasagna was Italian, not PR.  Needless to say, my family absolutely disliked this place, from the food (like the smoked burnt white rice) to the service( having to wait forever to get acknowledged or to get a refill) Not worth waiting so long in line for rude service and crappy food. The decor is awesome and the concept is great, but they fell extremely short on food and service.

Expensive delivery charge\\n2.  REALLY delayed delivery time\\n3.  Incorrect order because they didn't follow their own online menu\\n4.  OK food, not excellent or worth the hassle\\n5.  Polite staff but no concession for a dissatisfied customer\\n\\nLong version:\\nI was very disappointed with the service.  The online ordering system says delivery is within 20-40 minutes.  Given that it is winter, I expected it to be near the 40 minute mark (no precipitation falling, and main roads clear, but smaller side streets still have some snow and ice).  After 40 minutes, I called and the food wasn't even out for delivery yet.  At the 1 hour mark, the food still wasn't there.  When I asked if the high delivery fee could be waived or even have the food discounted given the delay, I was simply told the food couldn't even be cooked and out the door in 20 minutes and that the bad weather was the reason for the delay.  I was given a polite, \\"I'm sorry,\\" but that was it; the delivery driver said it was the online ordering site's fault for saying it could be 20-40 minutes.  Then, after the food arrived, my 3 containers of white rice were actually 1 order of white and 2 fried.  When I called to question and ask for a replacement, I was told that when customers don't specify, they send a mixture of white and fried.  That would make sense except that the reason I didn't specify is because the online menu said all entrees came with white rice, which is what I wanted.  I am not sure why they sent something different from the menu without a special request.  The initial order was delivered 65 minutes after it was placed, and the corrected rice order came another 55 minutes later.  The meal was finally complete exactly 2 hours after ordering.  The food, itself, was okay, but not the best I've ever had and certainly not worth the wait or the high delivery charge.  If they want to sustain their business, they need a second delivery driver to handle their mistakes or shorten delivery time and need to update their website to reflect their actual delivery time and rice servings (if you say white, give white or else have the site programmed to request the customer specify their choice)."},{"name":"Wasabi Grill","address":"398 14th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Who likes making money? Not these guys. I've worked in a restaurant before, so I understand what it's like to be closing and have customers walk in. Most restaurants handle this in a way that all successful businesses do: with grace and professionalism. Guess which route these guys took? I'm going to speculate the owners of this store aren't running things, and I hope they are reading this. Because you have hired the laziest bunch of nitwits to mind the store and will lose money because of it. I walked in at a quarter till closing.  The workers had just finished serving the customer ahead of me. The \\"Open\\" sign was on. One of the employees looked at the other like he was trying to confirm whether or not he could shoo me off.  That's exactly what they did. When I tried to point out that their clock said they would still be open for a few more minutes, they insisted they were closed.\\n\\nHey, you know what Wasabi Grill owners? That's fine. I'm not going to tell you how to make money. But right after I walked out ANOTHER customer walked in the OPENED DOOR UNDER THE LIT \\"OPEN\\" SIGN and got chased off too. So you lost two sales that night because your employees were too lazy to ring up a couple of more orders before closing. How much do they get paid an hour? How much do you make off a sale? Things to think about. \\n\\nI recognize good help is hard to find, but that's ultimately not my problem. I went to the Subway next door. Even though you could throw a rock in Atlanta and hit one, they were very friendly and even gave me freebies to entice me back. You know what? I think I'll take them up on it. Another business economics lesson- success depends on repeat business.
