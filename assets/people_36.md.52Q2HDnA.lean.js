My date has been going there for the past 5 years for all his special occasions. He goes there because he enjoys the ambience here. Other times he and I have gone, it has been okay but it seems like the staff always prioritizes the other diners. The wait staff gave the other diners complimentary bread to start which my table was not given. The wait staff was okay with refilling drinks but later when the plates from the entr√©es were cleared, no one cleaned the dirty table for us before dessert. The wait staff also only came by once during our meal. Each time they came by my date and I said thank you and they just looked unhappy. My expresso was delicious with a great rock candy to sweeten it up. The food I give a full 5 stars. The service really was a deal breaker. Idk if it was because we were young but I always give a tip accordingly. If I feel satisfied I ALWAYS leave a 30% tip but this experience really was not great at all.

The coleslaw tasted like plain cabbage. I also ordered sweet tea, this tasted like it was Nestea out of a can.   We did order ours to go and sat under the shade trees on the property instead of the 1-1/2 hour wait to eat inside (for this I am glad we did not wait).  Have not figured out how they draw so many customers with the food we ate that day.  Ads are kind of deceiving as well because they are cooking meat in enclosed smokers outside as well as the pit inside that is very prominent in their ads.

And if I didn't, the same sentiment was expressed in a simple, subtle, head-shake in disbelief. To put it succinctly, the food here is incredible. \\n\\nThai and Vietnamese food expresses itself in so many dynamic flavors. Real Thai food, that is. Not just the stoplight curries and pad thai that you find at most Thai joints. But the herbs (basil, mint, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, etc), roots (turmeric, galangal), and spices (chiles, etc) combine in often explosive ways to create serious flavor, varied throughout each bite. And a chef like Earl takes these to new heights with carefully-crafted combinations of herbal, spicy, sour, sweet, smoky, savory, umami, and salty. \\n\\nThe format here is fantastic. Nine courses, many of them single-bites of food. I am a hearty eater and left full, so never fear. Those bites add up. And some of the mains offer a few bites for each diner. You won't leave hungry. Our menu (it changes monthly) offered a Thai Muslim influence, so a mix of the bright spicy Thai flavors with the earthy, smokiness of the Muslim influenced foods that stretch through the region. Examples from our meal include scallops in a galangal coconut cream floating in a rice cracker bowl; dungeness crab pancakes topped with an herb, spice and pickle relish; spicy oxtail soup with legit A5 Japanese Wagyu beef on top; lamb in Massamun curry; Massamun dry curry rice; smoked halibut with salad and herbs; peking duck with mango, herbs, green strawberries and a coconut curry dressing... everything an explosion of flavor. \\n\\nThe price for all this? $65. That's insane. In a good way. I've had plenty of much higher-priced prix fixe meals in PDX that don't come close to the creativity, quality and quantity of what we got here. The wine and cocktail prices are reasonable (they do have a pairing option) and they have a great selection of white wines to go with the spicy, bright food. \\n\\nThis was easily one of my top two meals of the year, if not this year and last. The only real downside is that it's fucking impossible to get reservations here. Two seatings per night, open Thu-Sun. That's it. \\n\\nIf you're at all on the fence about whether to dine here, let this review push you over into the yes side. It's beyond worth it.

It's feels like a well oiled machine on busy lunch day. They have several Korean ladies working, scooping fresh seafood and vegetables. \\n\\nThey have 3 sizes: Small, Medium, and Large.

Or you can build your own bowl.\\n\\nFor the base, you can choose from carrot rice, brown rice, cauliflower rice, noodles, mixed greens, and kale. You can choose 2 to add to your base.  I like how they give you a variety in the bases so you can get the unhealthy rice or be super healthy with the vegetables. I guess you can get more than 2, if you pay a bit more. \\n\\nFor protein, they have your standard poke stuff like tuna, salmon, and shellfish. They also have beef, chicken, and tofu if you hate seafood. You get 2 scoops for small, 3 for medium, and 4 for large. \\n\\nAnd then you have your standard poke mixins, add-ons, and sauces. Honestly, I never like deciding thing like these. There's so many choices and pressure. That's why I always get their signature stuff no matter which poke place I go.\\n\\nFor the add on, you can have a select number of add-ons, depending on the size. Any extra would cost a lot more. \\n\\nOne of the cool things is that they have Stubborn Soda. They are a Pepsi product (GASP)! But they have all sorts of cool flavors of Soda like Pineapple cream. \\n\\nMy bowl tasted good. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. I guess my only complaint is the amount of food I got for the price. I paid about $13 and left hungry. Their markup is pretty insane.

Atlanta has two of the best beer bars in the United States, each with its own charm. When you walk into the Porter, you are transported into a craft beer and food nerd heaven. The entrance is long and narrow, with the bar nestled to the right. The taps seem to go on forever and then you grab the beer list. You can find almost any beer you're looking for, especially in their cellar. Once you've had a few and tasted some quite unique and hard to find brews, you stay for the food. The initial starting is the salt and vinegar popcorn, which you will just inhale and wonder where it went. Then you move onto a slew of variety in their main menu.

My only issue with my burger was that the house-smoked bacon was a little tough (almost like beef jerky), however I loved its peppery flavor. All of these flavors work together brilliantly and the taste of the meat is the star. The meat is very juicy, tender and perfectly cooked.

The lady was ready to take our drink order before we even had our coats off.\\n\\nOrdered a pork chop dinner, green beans, and steak fries. Thought the beans (w/ Bacon) were top notch, always consistent, pork chops were thick, well seasoned, and cooked perfectly. Buddy got a steak salad and it was huge. Bartender/waitress followed up to check up on meals a few minutes after our order arrived (12 minutes after placed) and followed up twice to see if we needed refills and if we needed anything else.  \\n\\nOnly issue I had was the steak fries soaked up all the juice from the meat and weren't as good as they could have been. I will just ask for them on a seperate plate next time but if they are looking for a suggestion perhaps the waitress could give it as an option. \\n\\nGreat thing about Texas Roadhouse is they are generally consistent from location to location in terms of food and service. They are good for small and large numbers, children and adults. The bar area and men's restroom were clean, everyone that was working was busy, and the bartenders were master multi-taskers in making drinks for everyone, serving the bar area, keeping everything clean, and making all of their customers feel welcomed.\\n\\nCheckout was fast and efficient. Asked if we wanted and suggested several desserts before she took our money. Xena was not a warrior princess but a heck of a waitress, as friendly as she was beautiful and she did a great job from start to finish. I think we were here for a max of 45 minutes and that included food, drinks, and a little time to watch some football.\\n\\nI would go back to this location and would recommend it to anyone on the west side of Columbus any time."},{"name":"Sushi Aji","address":"489 U S 287, Unit 100","city":"Lafayette","stars":"4","text":"Very good sushi.

And YES call me crazy cause I love Giacomo's! ¬†\\n\\nI keep on coming back here because the food here is superb and the prices are fairly reasonable. The calamari is undoubtedly THE best calamari I have ever tried. Fried to perfection, they add in fried peppers so that the dish has a nice spice/kick to it. I highly recommend the lobster ravioli--the sauce is so velvety and super flavorful and they are really generous with the lobster. You also can't go wrong with their linguine where you get to select your choice of seafood(s) and a sauce that satisfies your palate. ¬†\\n\\nI can see why many people might have hesitations on coming here because of the long wait, cramped space, and quick turn-around of customers, but Giacomo's isn't deemed a North end staple for no good reason!!

I went in expecting really good tasting food, and I came out having that expectation fulfilled, but along that journey out the door, I encountered many problems.  I knew that there was a very laid-back, self-run atmosphere at this joint, but I didn't expect extremely slow service.  I won't go into too much detail about the restaurant, as everyone by now knows it only has 1 cook and pretty much 1 server at any given time.  Though the young ladies were inviting, our waters took about 15 minutes to get to us.  With only 5 people in the restaurant, I'd assume that you could have at least one person send out some waters.  I ordered the AYCE gumbo, and my friend had the catfish dinner.  They were out of yams, which was fairly disappointing.  I ordered the cabbage alongside my gumbo, and my friend went with red beans and rice and green beans.  I don't know why it was, but my gumbo took literally 50 minutes to get out.  My friend's catfish dinner was a nice home-cooked fillet with fresh cornbread.  The cabbage was a bit too soft, though seasoned well.  My gumbo was outrageously savory and full of meat, but there were a few details I would've preferred different.  My first cup of gumbo had many bones and a lot of solid chicken fat.  Problems aside, the broth was absolutely delicious; as hearty and flavorful as could be.  One big turn-off was the bag of Sam's brand frozen chicken wings in the freezer.  Not making your own chicken wings, which are really simple to prepare is a saddening aspect of this otherwise home-style eatery.  Overall, problems outweighed the delicious gumbo, meriting the restaurant a 2."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I ate the Chicken Bao  with the spicy sauce and it was amazing.

We got there around 9.15 and there were A LOT of available tables so it's either they thought it would be a lot busier night or they're under staffed. We still had to wait until 9.50 for the table. I'm pretty easy and will look pass small matters like this but I'd like to address it. \\n\\nDrinks, we ordered almost everything on the drinks menu lol they were good (5 people), 2-3 drinks each. One of of the drinks was just not our taste but it's alright. \\n\\nFood, for small plates we ordered tandoor smoked pork belly ($18), 2 order of cauliflower koliwada (it's like cauliflower wings but with Indian spices $14), gun powder scallop ($20) and potato tikki ($14). For \\"large plates\\" (a bit bigger than tapas portion, I feel like), we ordered tandoori mushroom ($28), beef short ribs curry ($32), whole sea bass ($35). We also got traditional black dairy dal ($8) as a side + garlic garlic naan. \\n\\nFood was very flavorful and good. There were a few mistakes like forgot our orders or we got something that we didn't order. Here came the bill, I know what we should be expecting on the bill but we left still a bit hungry. So, price point and service 3 stars, food quality 4 stars."},{"name":"Sol de Mexico Cafe & Grill","address":"215 W Central St","city":"Natick","stars":"4.5","text":"Great street tacos and great service.

Once again being the real deal, expect to find chicken parts in your gumbo that you usually don't find in sanitized chain restaurants.\\n\\nEven though the gumbo was the some of the best I've ever had, you have to go for the experience.  No wonder Nubian Queen Lola's has been recognized as the most soulful dining experience in Austin.  Gospel music blares in the background, no doubt so Lola can hear it in the kitchen.

They both offered a good amount of standard and more creative items.  Everything was very reasonably priced ($10-12) and customizable.  I ordered the black bean burger with home fries and my companion got the omelet special with a salad. \\n\\nThe portions were huge and the food looked so lovely.  Odd word for food,  I know.  The home fries were the best I've ever had. Crispy,  slightly charred without tasting burnt, with the addition of small strings of caramelized onions. The burger was seasoned so well that I forgot it was a black bean burger and kind of just ate it. Meat,  veggies... it didn't really matter. The bun was crispy,  chewy and soft and tasted of roasted sesame and butter. Even their coffee was great. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back to try more. Great service,  wonderful food,  large servings and a bill that was respectfully priced. Yay for being a vegetarian for an hour."},{"name":"Street","address":"3407 Greystone Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I hope to give a higher review on my next visit.

I have been seeing this place featured on many food shows so I was excited to give it a try. First of all, the place is HUGE! It's like a BBQ compound LOL. The giant BBQ pit was so cool to see in person.  Luckily it was the day after July 4th so it wasn't really busy and we were seated immediately. We opted not to get AYCE and got the Thurman's Choice plate instead with pork ribs, brisket and sausage for $19.95. The meal comes with potato salad, baked beans and cole slaw. The star of the show were the pork ribs, very good and flavorful. The brisket left me desiring more, it was unseasoned and dry. The sausage is delicious, so good we got a half pound to go. The sides were great too, the cole slaw is amazing. Our mistake was not getting the AYCE option, seriously you get robbed getting the plate. If you want more the price of the meat is per lb. We wanted more pork ribs to go but you only get two bones in a lb! Overall I wouldn't call The Salt Lick a total bust. The food is good but not memorable.

I'll cover faves of all three. \\n\\nDinner: just grabbed food at the bar instead of waiting for a table... ordered like everythingggg and loved it all. Standouts the Charred Broccoli and Pulpo and Meatballs. Great bar staff took care of us and our MANY gimlets. Seriously order the gimlets. Note to self: drink more gin gimlets. Thank me later. \\n\\nBrunch: Mimosa and Bloody Mary Bar. Hello, lover. The standout dish we can't stop talking about weeks later (and need again, ASAP) is the Chicken & Churros. Crispy, spicy, juicy fried chicken breast with a couple of churros and a dreamy spicy-sweet maple syrup concoction that I literally want on everything. I don't even eat fried chicken (I know right. But I don't.) and we thought about ordering another one. The salads and the whipped goat cheese were our other faves. Something with an egg and chorizo was the thing we could have omitted and not really missed, but it was still pretty yummy. \\n\\nVegan Sis Dinner: seriously MAJOR LOVE for the way Barcelona treats vegans. She's a most-of-her-life vegan, not a trend vegan, and we have been figuring out great options for her for YEARS. I felt like Barcelona would be really easy to adjust things and make it work for her and a quick call had a host telling us it wouldn't be a problem at all - but that's happened before other places and it's not always the case. We let the server know her vegan status and asked for help navigating to the best options and he said he would mark-up a menu for us with the best options and minor modifications (like no cheese on a few things). One of the managers returned with a menu where vegan items were highlighted and others with notations next to them. SO REFRESHING. The best part was that for ONCE she didn't feel like someone was rolling their eyes or struggling to accommodate her or (honestly.) acting like a total hero for serving her something without butter in it. Super impressed. we ordered about 80% of the vegan options and loved them all. She said she definitely wants to return when she's back in town.  \\n\\nEverything yummy, always, and a glowing team of true hospitality pros.

It was Monday night 2 hours before closing and it was not too busy for such a long wait. We ordered the octopus, patatas bravas, those were delicious probably this is the why of my 3 stars but the hanger steak was poor in quality and the presentation of it was completely depressing just like chopping onions at home and put it them on a plate. I personally love tapas places but somehow not matter the food size still has to have the touch of a good flavor on the dressings and toppings as much as I want to complement that dish I can't.

CoM only makes 18 burgers each night, so arrive early for this well-crafted burger. \\n\\nWe started the night with booth seating near the bar, and were given the choice of sparkling (complimentary) and still water. Water service was on-point, and our glasses were consistently refreshed. KL and I ordered the burger, but were encouraged to look at the menu.

The octopus was done too well, and we missed the tender and flakiness of the octopus meat. \\n\\nThe burger, though, was on point and stole the show. KL and I have had the single burger at Au Cheval, which Bon Appetit named the best burger in America. I have had the burger three times in a two week period. Its good, it really is, but CoM does their own thing and its more to my liking than Au Cheval. KL tacked on a fried egg and thin and crispy bacon. The burger comes with a thick slab of meat patty, the freshness of which is indisputable. There is a side of greens and potato wedges, with chives. Yes, chives. Boston loves their chives. There are three sauce/side accouterments, including pickles, that are served separately and are replenishable (like Korean BBQ). \\n\\nIn addition, we received a complimentary ham and trout belly \\"taste.\\" Loved the trout belly, and KL loved her ham.

Parking is atrocious.  Here's the kicker,  they now charge  $5.00 for the little parking they do offer!!! Wtf!!? People have now started the dangerous and annoying habit of saving seats.  This is a HUGE no no as the space is a shared space similar to a cafeteria layout. It is first come, first served.  This restaurant should have signs stating this for the idiots that lack common sense to know better. They hire workers that can't read the italian descriptions on their menu so they are unable to help you if you have questions about menu items.  Prime example,  I inquired about the canoli flavors and both workers said they have no idea what the italian names meant.  Really? If the workers don't know,  then how the hell are the customers supposed to? Seriously,  service is bad,  parking is worse,  and there are many improvements that need to be made. I know it's summer,  and they cook the pizza in 700 degree ovens but damn it shouldn't feel like hell inside of the establishment.  Bottom line... Good pizzas... Negative every thing else.

I love the mussels and the fra diavolo sauce. The staff can seem abrasive when you're in line but they've got a system down and it works so just trust them! Once you're seated they'll take good care of you and you'll be back out the door with happy tastebuds and a full tummy in no time :)\\n\\n\\nA note for patrons who visit in the winter, do not open the outer door when the inner door is still open.

The menu provided me great options for both. The bento set I ordered had a great assortment - the slow cooked pork was extremely tender, moist, and had a pleasant sweetness. The miso soup was made from real miso, and the tempura is crispy and fresh. But my favorites bites from tonight were from the 5-flight nigiri set using fish that were flown in from Japan. The chef walked me through which fish came from which area of Japan, and each fish was firm and so fresh that you could tell it's distinct smell up close. Overall, it was a great mix of white and blue fish that I enjoyed very much.\\n\\nCons - the regular fishes such as tuna, salmon, and yellowtail definitely tasted less fresh.

They say on their website that slice \\"selection varies\\", but it doesn't.  So if you're a pepperoni loather like me, you're stuck with cheese unless you're hungry enough for a 10-inch pizza.  They, for some reason, refused to add toppings to my slice.  I think this is because they were too daft or stoned to figure out how much extra to charge.  \\n\\nI guess most people who eat downtown lack taste.  This pizza stinks.  The slices are big, but there's barely any cheese on them.  The crust is mediocre tasting and too soft.  At one point I took a bite and almost all of the cheese came with it.

The entrees are traditional and run the gamut from old standby to exotic speciality.  You might see chicken feet here, jellied blood, strange organ meats.  I've seen salty spicy frog legs, lotus root, and had mini octopus in hot sauce.  On one day they've had salmon two ways, skin-on tilapia fillets in garlic sauce, clams in sauce, General Gau, tofu three ways, the aforementioned octopus, and different vegetables.\\n\\nIf you tell them you are going to eat there, they give you a big stainless steel lunchlady tray (hence the 'Prison Food' moniker) and ladle the food right onto it.

I mean...I just....don't....get....the hype? But lucky for me, I tried it once and don't have to worry about what reads to be long waits, etc. \\nLocated RIGHT ACROSS the Georgia Aquarium, you'll find a fenced parking lot right behind the restaurant. The spots are minimal so good luck. Upon entering, the restaurant has many seats, so that's great. Host greets you and seats you. Our server was nice, food came out timely, and it wasn't bad, but it just didn't do anything of the \\"Yay I'm a fan, or This is As good As it gets\\" --- 4* and 5* requirements. Three stars on Yelp reads -- A-OK and that's what it was. My son got the chicken and waffles, I the chicken and biscuits with pepper gravy, a kids chicken tenders, and my friend got an omelette and ORDERED a side of potatoes. By golly, if I wanted eggs with NO SIDE I'd have cooked at home. Even IHOP offers some kind of a side. That was lame to me. The omelette didn't look any better than what I could get at a hotel weekend breakfast. But, to each their own opinion. The restaurant is loud, and it's not the music. Restrooms are located at center back of the restaurant. You can see the kitchen and all the prep in action. There's a chalkboard on the left side, maybe if you have kids and aren't being too intrusive to the tables eating there, you can ask for chalk to write on the \\"wall\\". \\nConclusion: I needed to try it to see what the hype was about.

The fried plantains were good and they came with sauces that were great for dipping, that was the part of the meal I truly enjoyed. \\n\\nNow for the chicken: I thought this place was supposed to be known for the rotisserie chicken, but it literally tasted like any other rotisserie chicken I could've picked up at the Walmart deli or whatever.

Although I took notice of her agitation, I kept in mind that fact that she was arguing on the phone before I sat down, so I kindly said thank you and continued to enjoy my time with friends. \\n\\nA few moments later, as we were waiting to be helped by the bartender, Silvio, so when he neared our direction I asked if we could place an order. The woman next to me chimed in, saying that it was very busy. Apparently we must not have been at the same bar, because the whole section where my six friends and I were seated was empty until we arrived. When the bartender finally made it to our section, I placed my order, passed him my card and asked to keep my tab open.  The bartender returned with my bill inside of a leather sleeve, against my request. I then reminded the bartender, Silvio, that I wanted to keep my tab open. Apparently this was the wrong request because Silvio proceeded to take the leather sleeve with my bill and aggressively pelt it into the trash with such force that it made an audible sound. Confused at his behavior and unprofessionalism, I continued to remain calm in a situation where I began to feel targeted. \\n\\nThe woman next to me began probing me, and asking if I had ever been a server or waiter because my request was rude. After asking how my request was at all rude, being that an error was made on the bartender's part, when I replied that I had never been a waiter, she began to get agitated and increasingly disrespectful. This woman went on to make a scene by saying I think I am better than others since I've never been a server, calling me a \\"bitch\\", saying stereotypical phrases such as \\"bye Felicia\\", mentioning my \\"ghetto bamboo earrings\\" and referencing me as \\"girl\\". As her insults continued, I was confused at what could have caused such an escalation, and why the bartender hadn't intervened in her erratic behavior.  I then remembered the charger belonged to the bartender so realized they must have known each other prior to that night. I also recalled the argument she had been having upon my entry into the bar and quickly realized her issues ran much deeper than a pair of earring I had been wearing. \\n\\nAfter ending the argument gracefully, with zero cursing or vulgarities on my part, the bartender took it upon himself to decide that I, solely, would not be served because he \\"didn't like what was going on\\".  At no point had the other woman been held accountable for her classless behavior in such an establishment. The bartender proceeded to refuse to serve me and my six friends due to this incident, but continued to serve the other woman who was the aggressor.\\n\\n Being the only African American in the establishment at the time, it was clear that I was not welcomed and I felt as though I had been targeted. As I exited the establishment, the bartender, Silvio told me that I \\"have no class\\" and that he \\"is not going to allow a new comer to act this way\\".  Not only had he taken sides in this situation, but he went on to insult me as not only a customer, but a new customer. He refused to serve seven customers total, and caused Strega's to miss out on sales., due to his pride and pompous attitude.  I am disappointed at how this matter was handled, and I plan to share my story with all who will listen."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious!

The chicken was tender and well maintained, the fingerlings had great texture without being to crunchy.

Since I'm more of the petite stature, I got the filet and shrimp. I had the filet cooked medium rare and when it came out, the plate was sizzling as promised. Although the filet is not very big, I did notice that the center wasn't very warm, which I found surprising. I wasn't sure if it was just me so I didn't make a big deal out of it. However when I talked to a coworker about it today, they agreed that their rib eye was rather cold in the middle. Aside from this factor, everything was delicious. I think I could have eaten a whole side dish of their sweet potato casserole. \\n\\nTheir desserts were huge and the servers did an excellent job of refilling our coffee. I think the restaurant staff puts a lot of pressure on themselves to give top of the line service to their customers but I did notice that there were some missteps. First, we had a private dining area and for whatever reason, our table was pushed to the side so that it was hard for a good number of people to get in and out. Second, one wine list for a table of twenty? Really? Third, they forgot to bring my slice of chocolate sin cake. For this last mistake, the manager did apologize for the mistake and I think everything got sorted out in terms of the bill and everything.\\n\\nOverall, I had a fabulous time and I'm so thankful for this lovely treat.

It's THAT good! We travel a bit to get there but it's so worth it! We are in LOVE with the lamb haberidabi (?spelling) and we usually come for the lunch thali special. It's full on flavor, tender meat, and sorta creamy tomato based sauce. You can get it mild-hot and with chicken or lamb. Highly recommend the lunch thali which gives you a small dish of salad, lentils/beans, yogurt with tomatoes and cucumber cooling sauce I use for the salad, the meat dish of your choice in whichever of the sauces they offer, and bowl of basmati rice. Plus Naan bread. Sometimes we get a papad (crispy fried lentil flour with spices like a chip) that comes with chutney (fruit flavored, mint or onion sauce like salsa), something like corn chips and salsa. Also love the dosa ( a huge light crepe-like baked disk that you add filling to like curried potatoes and peas), and the samosas (fried dumplings filled with the same filling), with sauces to dip in (highly recommend the coconut creamy dip). We get cravings for this food! The wait staff is always attentive and gracious. They aim to please and we know them by name. It too will become your favorite Indian restaurant!

I had the brussel sprout and bacon side which was good, but not if you don't like brussel sprouts that are pretty hard. I ordered a really nice cocktail which I'm forgetting exactly the name of... it has gin, cucumbers, mint, line and st-germain soda. My parents got a flight of beer which was at a pretty good price.

Friendly, welcoming, competent.  Our server could answer many questions, and when stumped, she got the answers.\\nThe food:  the menu changes frequently, so there is no point in describing individual dishes.  What I will say is that each dish was exquisite, beautifully presented, with exceptional flavors that varied significantly from course to course.  Several of the courses were actually \\"WOW\\" experiences that I truly crave!  I'm really not impressed with the semi-family style service, though.  Is it that difficult to do individual plating?\\nTiming:  So often when one goes for a multi-course tasting menu, the meal stretches on and on.  Not so here.  They have the timing down to perfection, which means no rushing, but also no waiting.  I think, because they do two seatings nightly, that they prioritize this aspect of the meal.\\nBeverages:  Well, unfortunately, here is where I had to take off points.  Prior to this, it would have been a five-star review.  Sadly, I opted for the $45 beverage pairing, assuming they would know what they were doing.  In reading other reviews, many people were pleased by the pairings; in fact, one of my dining companions thought that the pairings were fine, but she acknowledged that her palate was not very experienced.  However, as someone who actually teaches and lectures about food and wine pairing, I found the beverage choices at odds with the food.  This was one of those very rare meals where the wines actually detracted from the overall enjoyment of the meal, rather than enhancing it.  There wasn't anything wrong with the wines themselves, as they were delicious and well-crafted, but they fought with the food.  Asian food of any kind is often difficult to pair with wines, but it can be done, and I have had some mind-blowing experiences.  I truly wish I had just gotten a beer to sip aside the food.\\nIf I return (and the food itself is worthy of the $85 ticket price), I would skip the pairings, and either get a beer, or just rely on water."},{"name":"Lomonico's","address":"1506 Stonecreek Dr S","city":"Pickerington","stars":"4","text":"I had shrimp and grits and my wife had chicken and waffles.

They weren't quite 'fall off the bone' soft but definitely an easy chew.  The ribs were also very large and meaty ones.  The brisket was pretty tender and juicy and didn't even need BBQ sauce.  There wasn't a whole lot of fat on it but yet it was very soft.  They do offer combo meals which is nice unlike other BBQ joints that charge by weight for all their meats.  I got 3 sides with my meal:  BBQ beans, cabbage slaw and some potato salad.  I also got free dill pickle spears and raw onions along with some bread.  The combo meal is well worth it as you get a ton of food.  I took half of it home. The sides were good although the potato salad was needing some seasoning.  They offer a few BBQ sauces on are on the table for you to try.  \\n\\nThis place was off the beaten path and was about a 40 min drive from my hotel.

Sticky buns were gone but there were so many choices so we ordered two bread puddings (sticky and berries), one cappuccino and one latte. The girl behind the counter offered to warm up the puddings (it sounded such a great idea). We waited 10 min for the beverages (cappuccino tasted terrible, latte didn't taste of coffe at all) and 40 min for the puddings. We thought they forgot about the second part of the order so my husband went to check and he got two pieces of cold pudding in a plate (this time they adviced to not warm them up). Meanwhile they called my name, our first order was ready. Warmed puddings were wrapped in aluminium foil and placed in a paper bag that got completely soaked with the pudding liquid. Why? how are we supposed to eat this? Even assuming that they realized we already got two pieces of the cold puddings, so the second were to take out, why didn't they pack them in a box? Anyways cold pudding didn't taste good at all so we unwrapped the warm one (what a mess) and transferred them in the plate with the cold puddings. Warmed sticky pudding was ok, the berry pudding was bland and warming didn't make any improvement. While waiting, the sticky buns became available again...didn't they know that by the time we will get served they will be available again?

There were so many great choices!  But ultimately, I decided on the peach cobbler French toast with a side of bacon.  I normally don't get French toast or other heavy bread items during breakfast, but my curiosity got the best of me.  I had never heard of peach cobbler French toast, so I just had to order it.  It was less than five minutes later when my food arrived.  I was so startled when it came to my table, that I thought for sure there was an error.  The gentleman who brought the food, not my waitress, assured me that they just aim to go above expectations.  Without introduction, he seemed like the on-duty front of house manager.  He was dressed accordingly, smiled the entire time, and was very friendly.  Since I was there by myself, I took in a lot of the happenings around me.  The staff worked very much like little bees buzzing around, each with their own job.  The space is small, but everything and everyone seemed to know their place and do so at the perfect pace.\\n\\nThe taste of the peach cobbler French toast was perfectly balanced.  Savory bread, and just enough syrup, sugar, peaches, crust crumbles...everything that would comprise a peach cobbler.  I was quite impressed.  The bacon was good but a tad crispier than I prefer.  My only gripe was that the entire dish could have been hotter.  It was more like room temperature.  Looking back at how quickly the dish came out, I almost think this was pre-made and I just so happened to order something that had already been cooked.\\n\\nDespite that minor hiccup, the restaurant is one that every visitor and native should try at least once.

Meals came and the broccoli was hard as a rock like it had barely been steamed, I asked to have the broccoli steamed a little longer, it happens, no big deal, every other time they either remove the broccoli from the plate and steam it longer or just remake the broccoli and bring it to me later.

I had a fellow Italian friend visiting for NYE '17 from Hawaii so of course I wanted to show her the best of the best. I had been hearing for years about Giacomo's and decided we would try it out since the timing lined up that we (thought) wouldn't have to wait.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the line was short and the air temps were cold. We had no idea what was going on - we just knew there was a line and a woman who would occasionally come out of the steaming restaurant and bark at a few people to come inside. AN HOUR PASSED and my Hawaiian companion was absolutely frozen to the bone. But after waiting this long... it couldn't be much longer, right? Wrong. \\n\\nWe finally got inside after almost 2 hours, could barely feel our fingers and toes, and were bombarded by the atmosphere inside. Rushed in and squished beside fellow diners to cram everyone in, it was not the relaxed and enjoyable N.End Italian dining experience I was hoping for. I get it - people just like me were outside freezing their asses off trying to get in so they want you to get out. Doesn't make for the most pleasant experience. The food was spectacular and the price was outrageously low, but the overall experience was not worth it. We spent about 40minutes inside overall.\\n\\nBefore venturing here ask yourself this: what food is worth waiting 2hours for? Esp with the cold weather, the answer for me is literally nothing.

I really like the pickles!! \\n\\nWe also ordered the mushroom pizza, bone marrow, and Brussels sprouts. Love the bone marrow, but would pass on the Brussels sprouts next time. It was too saucy and soft but honestly we didn't read what kind they would be. I prefer crispy Brussels sprouts!\\n\\nThe mushroom pizza was interesting. At first it didn't come with cheese (one person is lactose intolerant and there was a misunderstanding with the waiter/chef and he didn't put cheese on the pizza). Then it's stopped with *scrambled* eggs. The menu just says eggs, not fried, so don't assume! It was kind of strange to eat a cheese less pizza topped with scrambled eggs..anyway, we got a pizza on the house for the mistake which had cheese and added lamb sausage. Much better except we still didn't care for the eggs on top. \\n\\nService was good, but it took an extremely long time to get the rest of the food after the charcuterie board came out! At least 30+mins...wonder if they wanted us to just enjoy our meats or if pizza really takes that long to make."},{"name":"In a Pickle Breakfast & Lunch","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"I wasn't a big fan of Bickford's for breakfast, even after their remodeling.

I had the hash and eggs with coffee.  The coffee was a bit odd in taste, but I've been on an iced coffee bender between Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's.  The breakfast itself was most excellent.  The corned beef hash was piping hot and not too salty.  The home fries were crispy and had a fairly unique flavor of spices.

The side dishes were not. The baked potato was barely warm and overly salty. The steak fries were cold and the green beans were mushy, as if from a can.

Really. While I've been a fan and visitor to the North Market location, this was my first visit to the Clintonville restaurant.\\n\\nFirst, it's huge! Clean lines and high ceilings. They have a bar! You can drink and eat healthy at the same time (take that, pub grub). The patio looks nice, located along High Street, behind a bit of shrubbery.\\n\\nSecond, you'll want to pre-screen the menu and be prepared to take your time, even if you've been to the NM location before. The counter is long, and it is a bit harder to see what is available. Staff are ready to answer questions, but at both locations they let you take the lead with questions.\\n\\nThird, be prepared to pay for quality. It is easy to drop $20-$25 per person here, given all the great options. Again, for the quality of food and its preparation, the prices have merit. You're getting local, seasonal food made perfectly. Think you'll have a tough time filling up? You'll be pleasantly surprised at how fully you can eat when it's \\"just veggies.\\"\\n\\nANYWAY. It's all good! The veggie dishes come in \\"scoops,\\" so you can pick as many as you'd like, priced from $3.75 (one) to $15 (a \\"flight\\" of six scoops). Who gets one scoop? I got the flight, of course: lacinato & Russian kales, potatoes & leek, red beet & carrot, roasted potatoes, celery root, and something else that I believe was a daily special. While the main ingredients seem simple enough, they are paired with things like golden raisins, lentils, pine nuts, and curry and scallion dressings to bring out flavors and textures you would otherwise miss. The spouse had a Signature Green Salad, with so many veggies and add-ins he could barely finish it. We also ordered the pretzel braids, since they were out of biscuits.\\n\\nNo desserts have been sampled, because by the time you're done with all the veggie goodness, who has room?!

The General Gau was the highlight, though I've had far, far better at many joints, but it was at least crispy! It somehow stayed that way despite being absolutely doused in gooey, overpowering sauce, all atop a tiny bit of steamed broccoli. This was crammed into a plastic container, meshed with the very bland lo mein. There was cha siu, beef, chicken, and mini shrimp with the noodles, it's like they had a ton of leftover meat and dumped it into my takeout order hahah. The jumbo fried shrimp was two medium-sized shrimps, with one inch of fried batter wrapping each... It's kind of like free scallion pancake given the sheer amount of this stuff.

I almost had a heart attack when one of my friends said that according to Google Map the restaurant closes at 9 PM on Thursday, but thankfully Yelp got the right hours of operation and they actually close at 10 PM. I know Salt Lick has another location closer to Georgetown, but I rather drive one more hour and visit the original Salt Lick location in Driftwood. Please note that the Driftwood area can get pretty dark after sunset (high beam may be required) and you may also drive past few high water flood signs if you somehow end up on Route 162.\\n\\nThe Salt Lick BBQ was featured on Man v. Food and often featured on the Travel Channel. The restaurant started in 1967 and they continue to serve side dishes (coleslaw and potato salad) using the same family recipes dated as early as 1870's. I didn't realize the spot is literally a giant ranch and I actually walked into wrong entrances (e.g. Salt Lick Cellars & Garden Room) twice. We didn't have to pick up a pager because there was no line at 9 PM, but they did run out of beef ribs (one of the most popular orders here) and peach cobblers. The moment we walked into the restaurant, the first thing I saw was this impressive giant open fire pit. The staff gave us a menu after we sat down in a giant dining room with long wooden tables. If you are really hungry, there's also an AYCE (all-you-can-eat) option ($26.95 per person with unlimited beef brisket, sausage, pork ribs, beans, potato salad, and coleslaw.) Before I started the meal, I stopped by men's restroom and sadly they ran out of paper tower and hand dryer was simply not working at all.\\n\\n***\\n\\nSalt Lick Plate: Brisket & Pork Ribs (served with beans, potato salad, and coleslaw, $16.95): Beans got pretty decent flavors and I did like sweet and sour aftertastes for potato salad, but coleslaw tasted just a-okay (very vinegary.) Pork ribs had very smokey taste and overall it was good, but briskets were somewhat dry and I had to pour slightly spicy BBQ sauce in order to make briskets taste slightly better.\\n\\n***\\n\\nPersonally this is one of those one-and-done experiences and I do think this place is slightly over-hyped. There are certainly better BBQ options in Austin as well as Lockhart aka the \\"BBQ Capital of Texas.\\""},{"name":"Southern Belle","address":"1043 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been looking forward to this restaurant opening for a while, as I've been eating Joey's food at all the various places he's worked throughout the years in Atlanta.

And it will continue to not surprise me when whatever restaurant they put in its place also fails.  Such an occurance is inevitable because 1917 Manor Rd. is cursed - haunted by the ghost of John Mueller's BBQ.\\n\\nBefore Manor Rd. turned into The Restaurant Row of the East Side, you used to be able to walk into this dirty little building and get absolutely the best moist brisket in the central Austin area.  John Mueller did it like no one else.  It was the kind of brisket that you buy a half pound to eat, and then another half pound to take home so you could strip down and rub all over your body.  Of the three out-of-body experiences I've had in my life, two of them occurred with a mouthful of this stuff.  And now it's gone.  Sure, his dad runs his grandfather's old place (Louie Mueller's) up in Taylor, and it's outstanding.  But it's over a 30 minute drive away, and they don't have John's two different choices of BBQ sauce (one sweet and one spicy).  There were rumors that John merely relocated to Bastrop, but I cannot find him.  If someone knows where he ended up opening shop, please let me know.  \\n\\nAnd not that it would have mattered (because of the curse), but they replaced this old-school barbeque mecca with some shiny new place serving fancy southern food.  FANCY SOUTHERN FOOD?  Why are you 'crusting' tuna with chile?  What the F is MANGO chiptole barbeque sauce?  John Mueller would sooner drown his grandmother in that stuff than put it on his meat.  My two visits to El Gringo left me feeling like my first trip to the proctologist:  confused and violated.\\n\\nFinally, to make matters worse, the name of this place was a derogatory term for young, white males.

I also love their shrimp tapas. It has the perfect blend of seasoning to make it tasteful but not overpowering. \\nAmbiance: The ambiance here does not get much better.

I'm almost certain if I ever required surgery on my stomach, Ronald McDonald just might pop right out! Doctors would also discover while living in my stomach he and Wendy gave birth to Five Guys and built a lovely White Castle for their family. That is until Burger King and his fianc√© Krystal bought it on a foreclosure sale after I slowed down eating at all of them (single-handedly sending the burger economy into recession).\\n\\nSo when Lindy F said she was having a burger UYE featuring #6 from Atlanta Magazine's top 20 burger list, well, I just couldn't pass that up. That's right folks, the Diner Burger ranked #6 overall in the city of Atlanta: http://www.atlantamagazine.com/20-best-burgers/\\n\\n\\nTHE SCENE\\nIt was a dark dreary night on the streets of Atlanta. This part residential, part commercial neighborhood seemed like a scene out of a mystery novel; dimly lit streets with barely any traffic. Small business shops lining the corner of this street, but seemed that only the Albert's lights shined in the darkness. I walked in the door to see a table set up for our UYE party of 16. A few familiar faces waving at me as I entered (mainly my buddy William G).\\n\\nGreetings and salutations commence with my yelp family after I made a round taking pics with my new LG3. I hadn't been here before you see, so it's customary to get a few shots in before I'm seated, else I'll forget. The talk of the night was this Diner Burger, but I had my eye on the Patty Melt. So, as it always is with William and I, we ordered different burgers and split them to share. Bill is my bromance you see. Hair and eyebrows like Encino Man, but kind-hearted and unfiltered (also like Encino Man).\\n\\nSince I don't get to the city much, I let my food freak flag fly and ordered a round of the smoked wings I read about in other reviews. Poor wings. They were practically swallowed whole by everyone within arms reach of my seat :-) Here are the accounts of the food from my best recollection. I tend to enjoy the company at UYE's so much that the food becomes secondary.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nTHE DINER BURGER $10 | 4.5 Stars\\nI've already peeked at a few of the other yelpers reviews that I shared this dining experience with this evening. That's usually something I don't do because I don't want to be influenced into \\"going with the group\\", but it wouldn't matter in this case. Unlike some of the others, I thought this burger was well worthy of being mentioned in the * Best Of * burger category for Atlanta.\\n\\nI will further say that although I've only had 6 of the top 10 burgers recommended in Atlanta Magazine (and 10 of the top 20), so far this would rank in my top five behind Holeman & Finch, Bocado and a few others. That may change as I try the other burgers, but I really found the Diner burger to be pretty outstanding in flavor. I also found the burger to be \\"beefy\\" but unlike some other burgers around town, the accompanying toppings share much of the taste stage with the beef. It doesn't take away the beef flavor, but instead adds another layer to the taste. Not at all disappointed with this burger. Matter of fact, I hope to go back again soon for another.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nOTHER ITEMS\\n\\n- Smoked Wings $6 | 5 Stars (upgraded from 4 stars on 3/3/15)\\nYep, they are as good as the other reviewers say and I found them to be pretty meaty as well.\\n\\n- The Patty Melt $10 | 2.5 Stars\\nIt is worth noting that Patty Melts are my FAVORITE style of burgers. My affection for them runs deep into the fabric of my being and ties in heavily with my most cherished childhood memories. I wanted for this burger to be amazing, using my mind to will my taste buds into submission. But it was just too much wrong to make it right. Hard bread, dry patties, no rye flavor, just plain bad. Honestly, my dislike for this burger may have increased my love for the Diner burger just by default.\\n\\n- Cream Corn w/bacon $4 | 4 Stars\\nUnlike any creamed corn I've ever had in the past, but that worked in it's favor. I like new discoveries and this was indeed something I found delightfully creative.\\n\\n- Fried Pickles $7 | 3 Stars\\nThey tasted as they should, but with a bit too much breading.\\n\\n- French Fries $3 | 3.5 Stars\\nThey appeared to be home cut. I enjoyed them, but the creamed corn and burger worked surprisingly well. I barely touched the fries.\\n\\n----------\\n\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\nI like this place. I like this place a lot! Makes me wish I lived in one of the nearby residential flats where I could pop in for a burger or beer anytime I wanted. This could be a regular hang out, like Cheers, but with burgers added to your beer order. I highly recommend The Diner burger, the smoked wings and that dang creamed corn w/bacon.

Overall,  very tasty. The cheese pizza was also very good as the sauce and dough were perfect. I ordered online and was a little worried when pulled into the plaza. The place is in a hole-in-a-wall plaza and google maps miscalculated the location so I made several u-turns to locate.

I never had to ask for refills, she kept us comfortable and returned frequently, she even sent us on our way with drinks to go!\\n\\nThe food-\\nIt was just ok, no real smoked flavor and the meat was cold. I ordered the all you can eat family style option which probably sitting up waiting, it comes with ribs, brisket and sausage. The sides are potato salad, ranch beans and cole slaw. The potato salad was brown and lacked flavor, I was expecting the southern style potato salad with mayo, mustard, onions etc. it was ok. The cole slaw was the same, just ok. Theo offer two types of BBQ sauce, regular and spicy and honestly it was nothing to write hone about and not the traditional flavor I am used to. By the way real good bbq does not need sauce.They also serve a bread loaf, which could use some butter and a grill to warm a bit. The iced tea was not flavored either. The one plus was if you like the food, they give you a to go bag and this is jot typical of all you can eat. If it had not been for our server, I would have rated lower. Lasting impression, I was impressed by the environmentally friendly straws, the ambiance and service but food not so much.

My wife and I went there for dinner recently and will not be going back.  We shared some guacamole to start,  and my wife ordered the chicken flautas (special that night), while I had two carne asada tacos. \\n\\nThe chips for the guacamole came in a paper bag even though we were sitting down inside. ??? Thankfully, the cashier noticed and brought us plastic basket so that we could eat them with dignity.\\n\\nOur soda glass (or the soda itself) smelled like fundillo. Let's just say for now that...fundillo = dirty dish water. We would have ordered beer (like the sign says), but they didn't have their license yet. \\n\\nMy carne asada tacos were ok, but in my opinion, there are many more places in Austin that serve much better tacos. My wife's special chicken flautas were served in a plastic basket/bowl ( not a human plate but more like a dog bowl) and they were SWIMMING in water. WTF? The water at the bottom of her bowl was deep and yellow in color. It was kinda disturbing. I'm sorry, we wanted the flautas, not the flauta soup. \\n\\nIf you are a high college student, I'm sure this place will pass for sustenance.

For brunch, I ordered the bon matin plate and he got the short rib egg skillet thing. Then we got two waffles with the mixed berry sauce and the caramel bacon sauce. My bon patin plate had all of my favorite things- avocado, rustic bread, brie cheese, olive tapenade, roasted tomatoes, proscittuo- so I was disappointed that it wasn't that good. I can't really pinpoint why, but it was just kind of blah. There was barely enough prosciutto, and one little drop of tapenade, I would have like 4x as much. The avocado was actually more like a guac spread, which was disappointing. The bread was good, but the brie wasn't super flavorful. Overall, I was disappointed by this and would not recommend ordering it.\\n\\nHowever, my boyfriend's shortrib plate was BOMB. The shortrib was super tender and flavorful.

We immediately thought of the old Origins haunt, Barley's, but that place was packed to the gills.  So, walking down High Street, we came upon a new place:  the Double Comfort Restaurant.  Having not seen this place before, we decided to give it a run.\\n\\nThat's kind of the key to this review:  I'd never seen this place before.  Looking at their website now (which is unfinished as of June 2015), I'm under the impression that this place hasn't been around for very long, and they definitely weren't ready for the 16,000 geeks that descended on Columbus that week!\\n\\nWhen Jules and I arrived, we were greeted by an affable fellow in a bow tie...who promptly did not put our names in any sort of book or recording system.  We waited there, in the entry, for nearly 20 minutes, before finally being seated. \\n\\nDouble Comfort is well-decorated, in a sort of down-home, vintage Southern way, which was appealing...for a while.  Our server took our drink order quickly, but time between drink orders and any other sort of orders (such as appetizers or our meals) took what seemed like forever.\\n\\nFood?  Even longer.  Jules settled on a shrimp po'boy while I indulged in the chicken fried steak with a mashed potatoes slathered in bacon/sausage gravy.  We also ordered a \\"southern fried poutine\\"....which never arrived.  Instead, we were presented with a platter of deep fried okra and other vegetables.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.\\n\\nThe food was stellar; I can easily given Double Comfort that much.  I was ready to lick the plate clean of that delectable meaty gravy.  Jules' po'boy looked delicious, and I don't even like shrimp! \\n\\nAll told, our meal took nearly a full 2 hours from beginning to end.  We were almost an hour late to our first gaming event, which left us fairly frustrated.   Double Comfort's food is tasty, but it's just not worth that long of a wait.  \\n\\nGive this place a pass until they get their feet under them and their service time can get under an hour.

I ordered a custom bowl and loved the variety of ingredients to chose from. They opened very recently so everyone was very cheery and eager to please which is always nice of course. I really enjoyed my bowl but my husband who was with me encountered a lot of skin on his tuna, which means the fish was poorly cut. I also did find some unchewable salmon pieces as well. I'm sure they are working out some kinks but whoever is cutting the fish needs a little more training in that department. Eating raw fish skin is certainly not the best.

No television or modern amenities, but I wasn't complaining.  Given the urban setting and historic construction, I didn't expect the room to be silent, but the floors, walls and windows seemed to be paper thin.  Both side tables had a pair of earplugs for guests, so I'm sure I'm not the first to make this complaint or observation.  Light sleepers beware!  Be sure to opt for a top, fourth floor room.

My car did not appear very secure (just a code gate after hours) but Crystal Hotel has the entire second floor set aside for guests.\\n\\nI discussed my few concerns of the room with the manager Miriam.  She was very apologetic and understanding.  This was greatly appreciated.\\n\\nBeing that it was Valentine's Day, we did purchase a glass of wine in a classy plastic cup to enjoy the downstairs saltwater soaking pool.  It was very relaxing with bamboo walls and rushing spout of hot water.  Don't forget your suits!  The Zeus Cafe restaurant is also highly recommended, as is the Ringler's Annex which has awesome decor and options such as pool tables, shuffle board, and pinball machines.  Ringler's is also open 365 days a year!  Go downstairs from the Annex to Al's Den where they have Comedy Nights every Friday from 10:30-11:30 PM for free!\\n\\nMcMenamin's is always a fun spot to check out, just know that you're paying for the entertainment, theme and prime location.  Your memories are always free!\\n\\nNote: If you're filling out your passport, be sure to come at 2 pm in order to take a tour of the Crystal Ballroom and Lola's Room without having to purchase show tickets.  This way you'll still get those two stamps."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"309 N Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I will preface my review by saying that I don't eat steak.

Literally, the coffee shop is sitting on the side of the river, allowing many views of others boating, the water, or the trees and nature around. This is a fantastic spot that, in my opinion, is welcomed with the utmost of ease to a rather busy and autonomous section of Austin. \\n\\nService here was efficient. Walking in you're welcomed by that cooling air inside and then you see many people who are looking to order not only coffee, but pastries, beans, other various drinks and merch offered here. Mozart's century award solution? Just have 2 lines running when it gets busy and keep separated areas to distribute ordered items on the side they were ordered. Again another efficient and fluid solution that keeps the flow going and keeps the pace of everyone in there running smoothly. \\n\\nWhile waiting in line they had a separate area where you could try fresh cold brew which was delicious and balanced in flavor. Keep in mind their do have several deals that, in my opinion, are great for those all day studies where you pay once and get unlimited portions throughout the day. Give it a gander when you're able. At the front the employees are very helpful and this is shown by the knowledge they present, and with all the customers they get it's good they know their stuff. Big takeaways here are to know you can ask and your questions will be answered, meaning they do have various substitute for your needs.\\n\\nDrink selection? Numerous flavors between coffee, tea, & italian sodas. I decided on a strawberry italian soda for the middle of those hot summer days that Austin has. Always a refreshing choice alongside their draft latte on ice, subbed with oat milk, that was balanced and also fresh. I do want to mention that the food selection here is also numerous and made fresh daily. These are all selling points of a successful coffee shop.\\n\\nSeating was a huge point for me and with all the rest of what they had to offer, I mean it just works out for them and it does so quite well. This basically means that when we showed up, it was obvious that there were many customers because of all the seating taken up inside. But when you walk around the outside deck or the lower levels it still felt like you could find spots of seclusion for study or quiet conversation and relax. Easily, this is an all day spot I think I could find myself at, with a book, work, or other personal studies. \\n\\nOverall, Mozart's presents itself as a necessary presence in the community, solidified by the daily rush of customers, ranging from tourists and locals alike. Thanks for the opportunity to check this place out Austin, you got a good one here. \\n\\n----\\n\\nSTICKERS here are going to just be consolation, but something I was happy to find out about. It's simple, but they have great looking free stickers for their company. I enjoy collecting things to help me to remember where I've been and these are easy to make and so thoughtful for places to put out for customers. Like I said, I really don't ask for much but show me you care and that's just amazing to me."},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"818 S Orlando Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"2.5","text":"For what it is (24 hr diner with 50s theme), this Steak n Shake was not bad.

The place had probably 5 other tables full, which does not surprise me, and we were seated quickly. \\n\\nThe restaurant was clean and had maybe 3 servers about. Our server brought us water and since we all knew exactly what we wanted, we ordered quickly. I happen to always eat the double steakburger with cheese, and a side of cheese sauce for my fries. For a price of $3.99, its actually a good burger. Not that fast food flavor, but decent quality ingredients and veggies (lettuce, tomato, onion). Their fries were also cooked nice and crispy, shoestring fries, even for being a midnight meal. I really couldn't complain. Our friends ordered two milkshakes, turtle caramel and cookie butter. Both tasted creamy and delicious, but hands down the cookie butter was the real deal. I happen to love cookie butter (Trader Joes thing), and this tasted exceptional. \\n\\nNot many places can you get a quick, decent, American meal for around $5 a person, but I give it to Steak n Shake for keeping their niche."},{"name":"Bamboo Sushi","address":"836 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing & tasty sushi!

Frankly I don't understand why this place is so popular. I guess because they have all-you-can-eat? Whatever. You're overpaying anyway because you're probably not gonna eat enough to break even.

Charisse M. and I went together to try this place out. First impressions were this place is DEAD - are they even open? I figured with all the hoopla it'd be gang busters. I even said \\"Did they run out of dough?\\" But I pulled into the parking lot and saw that they were in fact open. We went in, ordered our Margherita pizza and waited the 30 seconds it took for it to be cooked. \\n\\nSince we were the only two people there, we opted to stand at the \\"counter\\" instead of around the large family table just outside of the kitchen. First impression of the pizza was it looks alright. It is not an aesthetic masterpiece or anything. We pulled out our respective slices and to my shock I realized that this pizza was a soggy mess. Despite it's appearance I went into consumption mode with an open mind because of all the foodgasms Antico has incited for others. First bite, eh, pretty good; second bite, eh pretty good; third bite, FRICK!!! I just ruined my shirt!!! I am a messy eater already (remember my incident with the Sublime donut on white shirt at the Yelp Thang event) and when you give me messy food its a nightmare. Had I known the consistency of this pie I would have brought a bib or worn an old college t-shirt over my clothes for protection against the saucy mess. Anyway, by the time I was done consuming my shirt was ridiculously splattered with pizza runoff. It was then that I thought to myself, was the pizza even worth messing up my shirt? And the answer was \\"No.\\" I really prefer a pizza with a more stable crust and thicker sauce. I don't like soupy pizza.\\n\\nIf I were a man I'd be protecting myself against castration right about now because I know the Anticoians out number lil ol' me, but anyway, it just didn't do it for me. It was decent, the ingredients seemed to be good quality, it was something new and different for pizza in Atlanta, but it just didn't rock my face off. I will go back and try other menu items if I'm in the neighborhood. This place is just alright in my book. It's just not one of those places I would go out of my way to get to. Here is a run down of the good and bad: \\n\\nGood: \\n\\n- The atmosphere is cool. I actually don't think they should put in stools or seating unless it's outdoor (which is pretty useless right now that winter is approaching). \\n- People who work here are super nice. \\n- Papa Ole (Giovanni's neighbor) bought cannolis for practically everyone who was there. He was a very sweet guy and I'd probably go back just to talk to him. The cannoli was super delish! \\n- The pizza did have a unique flavor. I appreciated the charred pieces on the crust \\n- Fresh ingredients: you can really tell that this stuff is fresh and high quality. \\n- BYOB? Everyone seemed to bring their own drinks. I brought my Diet Coke while others brought beer. A few wine glasses were also spotted. I'd give this place an additional star if they had Diet Coke on tap. \\n\\nBad: \\n- You basically have to eat this pizza there. I am assuming the pizza would be a disaster for carry out if you live more than 50 feet away based on the dining in experience. It is messy and gets soggier with time. \\n- This is not the reheat-able kind of pizza. Sometimes you just want some cold pizza in the morning after a late night or you want to have leftovers for lunch. Antico isn't going to be able to help ya out there. Must eat immediately. \\n- If you are a messy eater come prepared. Bring a roll of paper towels. Prepare to get down and dirty with your pizza pie. \\n- This pizza was not foldable but it was rollable. I had to roll my pizza up into a little wrap to consume it.

When I mentioned that to my server she brought out a bowl of chili sauce (the kind with the seeds) and I added the entire bowl to my dish, that made it better in the spice department, but it was still mediocre in the deliciousness department. The steak in this dish was teeny slices of beef that tastes like they'd been thrown in at the last minute. The beef did not remotely integrate with the dish. It was out of place and awkward. \\n\\nMy companion ordered Spicy Bamboo with Tofu (Two Chili Peppers), you could see and taste the spice a little better in this dish (but it was still mild not medium). The tofu was good sized bricks (instead of little cubes), which I like (yes I had some of hers), but the sauce again, was pretty mediocre overall. Also, our little sides of rice were $2 each. \\n\\nActually, the prices overall were higher than average.

From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by the visual of food being prepped. To the left of the door they were making pizza dough, and deeper in that area is the full kitchen as well as a station where they make the cheese/charcuterie boards, all open and visible from the restaurant. Further in to the right of the door is more prep work being done, such as chopping tomatoes. This open kitchen really adds a lot to the ambiance! \\nWe came about 30 minutes early for our reservation, and found two seats at the bar. We ended up talking with the bartender and ordered a bottle of wine, and eventually decided to stay at the bar and forego our reserved table. \\nOne of their specialties is the build your own charcuterie/cheese plate, which we of course did. We opted for the Four Fat Fowl, a triple cream cheese, and the Mad River Blue cheese. Both were so delicious, served with toasted bread, mustard, and and pickles. You can add other add-ons as well such as jam or almonds, but the mustard and pickles were so delicious we didn't need anything else. \\nNext, we had the fried Brussels sprouts, served in a squash sauce with hazelnuts and feta.

Most recently I went a bit later at night during the week, so there was no wait to be seated. We were quickly escorted to the back, past the bar, and seated at a bench/table. We started with the Pimento Cheese Pull Apart Pretzel which was nothing like I imagined - it was better! Rather than a pretzel, it's more of a soft pull-apart bread loaf flavored like a pretzel with the most delicious cheese dip! Absolutely loved it. We ordered two entrees, the first of which was the Double Smash Burger and the second the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Both avid foodies, we cut each sandwich in half and swapped portions. I was more a fan of the double smash burger than the buffalo chicken sandwich. The slutty sauce for the burger was delicious and reminded me a bit of Zaxby's/Zacadoos sauce, which I loved. Although the buffalo chicken sandwich was good, the breading was a bit softer than I imagined and stuck to the bun; I was hoping for a bit more of a crispier sandwich. Each entree came with Belgian Fries, which I cannot rave enough about. I look forward to visiting again as the food here is wonderful. My one issue is I wish the venue were a bit larger as it can get incredibly crowded and hard to navigate through on the weekends, specifically near the bar area."},{"name":"Escobar Restaurant and Tapas","address":"327 Peters St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"2 stars!

So we wait 30 minutes for a seat yet during that time he could have at least made our coffees to entertain us or something that we ordered but he didn't. The service was extremely dull with no personality at all. We would have expected a warm welcome for a new business but the guys personality was dry. \\nOk so the food comes the presentation is nice.

Upon my most recent visit, I learned that 1) most of their pizza costs over $20, 2) they have expanded their dining area by opening up the kitchen, and 3) they don't have dry oregano sprigs and peperonata on the table for you to garnish your pizza with anymore. Simultaneously, I was ecstatic to see that Antico is still thriving and that their pizza is still excellent. The quality of the ingredients is superb: the sauce made using the San Marzano tomatoes is pleasantly acidic, the crust is perfectly charred, and the bufala mozzarella is creamy. If this doesn't make you salivate, I don't know what will.\\n\\nAlthough they offer various different pizzas, I only order Margherita D.O.P As the famous saying goes, less is more. If you can handle spice, I would recommend Diavola; the addition of soppressata and peperonata packs a punch and flavor.\\n\\nIn my experience, it is absolutely the best to eat their pizza right out of the oven, piping hot. So I would recommend dining in, rather than doing a take-out. No matter the day, they are extremely busy.

I had the lobster fritters which are great, but definitely should be a shared app - made the mistake of going solo on this and it filled me up quickly.

The GF had the Endive Salad which was very refreshing, but the candied walnuts hidden in the salad were the real treat!\\n\\nFor my main I had the Lobster and Crab Risotto which was amazingly rich, and with tons of flavor. They definitely did not skimp on the crab and lobster meat, and I pulled a few whole claw meat bits out of the risotto as well. If I hadn't had the Lobster Fritters by myself this would have been the perfect portion size. The GF had the Mushroom Gnocchi which were fantastic - definitely would recommend it, even over my dish! Others in our party had the Spaghetti, which was simple, homey and tasted like it was right from Tuscany. My brother had the Veal, which was big enough to look like an entire shank of meat.\\n\\nAll in all, everything was delicious and the environment in the summertime when the North End is buzzing made for a great night.

The service started off fine, our waiter was very informative and helpful and the 3 starters and 2 salads we ordered came out fairly quickly.  Then we ordered our entrees.  We waited for at least an hour for our dinner to come out.  In that hour our waiter only stopped by once to say that the kitchen was running a little slow and our food should be out shortly.  With such a big party spending a good amount of money it would have been nice if the manager had come over to apologize for the wait or even the owner who was chatting at a nearby table, but non of this happened.  Even a complementary drink to go along with the 2 bottles of wine we already drank while waiting would have been a nice gesture since we waited so long.  Strega can absolutely improve in the customer service department.  On the positive side when our food did finally come out it was amazing.  I had the sea bass and it was cooked perfectly.

There was a gap of a few years while we lived out of state, and I have been looking forward to going ever since we moved back a few months ago.  Well, today was the day!\\n\\nLocated in the beautiful Hill Country outside of Austin, The Salt Lick has been around and renowned for decades, and for good reason.  The ambiance of the place is simply palpable - the old school Texas vibe oozes from every inch of the place, with fast and friendly service the norm.  If this review was based on ambiance, it's five-stars hands down.\\n\\nBut The Salt Lick is about food - specifically about Texas BBQ.  The Salt Lick has been one of the top destinations for as long as most folks around here have been alive, and they have earned their place over time.  In the last few years The Salt Lick has expanded to more locations (even the Austin airport), \\"worldwide shipping\\", and even their own winery and wine brand.\\n\\nUnfortunately, over time and with all of this expansion it appears that they have forgotten what earned them this acclaim in the first place: The Food!  My excitement at being back in one of the BBQ temples of the world quickly faded away against the current reality of the product, and there's no other way to say it: I came away devastatingly disappointed.  The brisket was dry, chewy, and gristly - not in the same universe as the melt-in-your-mouth, fall-over good standard that earned them their following.  The bison rib was cooked nearly to a cinder.  And the BBQ sauce, which has always been a matter of love of hate for BBQ eaters (for me was always love) was a mere shadow of its former self.\\n\\nI guess The Salt Lick has grown up and grown past the deep Texas roots that gave it life, and it's a shame.  When we lived out of Texas this was one of the many things I missed deeply.  Now that we're back (and so happy to be here), I still will end up missing The Salt Lick because the one that I knew (like so much of Old Austin) is gone."},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Solid sushi place- all the rolls we got were delicious.

The food here was beyond amazing. I have never had food that had such bold exquisite flavors before. I went here for a rep dinner for my job and the food was outstanding. I went and told everyone about this place. First off the staff there was wonderful. They were kind, and on top of everything, and they were very helpful with choosing the dishes. First we started off with drinks and appetizers. I ordered a cappuccino which was the best cappuccino I've ever had in my life. Then came out milk buns. I didn't even know what this was. It was the softest bread I've ever had in my life with such a great flavor. It was almost like a yeast roll but when I cut into it it was like cutting into butter. Then we have a conch fritters which had a taste that was unlike any conch fritter I've ever had. Sometimes it can have a fishy taste this absolutely did not. Then we had what was called up plantain flatbread and that was just late but bold in flavor. Then we could choose from a salad or soup. I decided to choose the soup because a salad you can get anywhere. Although the salads did look good when they came out. I got the potato soup which was blended and thick but so light it wasn't too heavy. The flavor was simple yet awesome. Then came dinner time and I asked the waitress what was the best entr√©e on the menu that we were presented. She said absolutely hands-down it was the fried chicken with collard greens and macaroni and cheese. I thought how can this be the best plate in a nice fancy restaurant like this. She told me the flavors were very different from the typical macaroni and cheese and fried chicken. So I went ahead and ordered it and boy was she right. I just could not get enough of this dish. The flavors were so so different and so incredible. She told me that the chicken is slow cooked for hours then they soak it in buttermilk and pan fry it ... amazing! Then of course, came dessert. I had the choice of Tiramisu or white chocolate panna cotta with chocolate crumble and chocolate Crema. The consistency of this was almost like a flan but a little more custardy. But when I tell you the flavors of this were just as outstanding as the dinner entr√©es I am not lying. And on top of everything, our server Darcy was outstanding! She kept our drinks full and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. I could not stop raving about how amazing this place was. If you have an event or if you want to go somewhere for brunch or go somewhere for dinner and you want to have food that will blow your mind you need to come here.

Don't bother if you have to wait more than a few minutes. \\nWas Giacomo's good? Sure. Will I return? Nah. \\nLook - for those of you with tons of time to spare to stand in a crazy long line in the outside to eat super okay Italian food, then this place is for you! But me? No. I'll go to one of the many other places on or around Hanover street. Was the food good here? Sure. Was it great? Lol no. The only reason we even ate here was because we heard the north end is notoriously quiet on Sundays during lent and thought Giacomo's just might have a short enough line for us to finally try it. Well it was only a couple people long and we decided we had to know - is it worth the hype? I think you know my answer. \\nWe ordered the burrata as an appetizer as well as the butternut squash ravioli. The burrata was quite nice, I will say. The ravioli on the other had - so so sweet. I think the butternut squash along with the mascarpone sauce was a little too much. The dish was begging for some balance to juxtapose against the two sweet elements. \\nFor dinner I got the veal Parmesan. It comes with a side of pasta. I asked what house made pastas were available (I was even willing to pay an up charge) and I was told that I could not get the home made pasta with the veal parm. I had to have the stuff from a box. For being an Italian restaurant on Hanover street that always has a line more than an hour long, I was fairly surprised at the lack of home made pasta options. And then to be told I can't order it...what? If I wanted the homemade pasta, I had to order the special. Which had shrimp and lobster...I have a shellfish allergy so that wasn't actually an option for me. As it is, the veal parm was good. I think maybe I would have preferred the chicken tho. The side of pasta was boxed pasta doused in Red sauce. Shrug. \\nMy husband ordered the homemade pasta dish with the lobster and shrimp. I couldn't try it but he said the shellfish was great. He was not a fan of the homemade pasta. \\nMy husband will likely return for the two person seafood special, however the menu options are so so limited for me due to my allergy and I found the food to just be okay overall. \\nThe plus sides were that the service was excellent and quick. It was also really great that we could have the bottle of wine we ordered with dinner corked to take with us after we finished our meal. \\nAlso, cash only so we know what that means."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I never leave Yelp reviews, but Dana's service was so demeaning and horrible that I have to say something.

The pit captivates your sight and smell as soon as you walk through those doors. All the plates come with potato salad (yum!), beans (not a fan of beans in general), bread (not too exciting but nice to alternate with meat bites), and cole slaw (surprisingly light and flavorful for a mayo version).

The raviolis were cooked to a perfect al dente temperature, but they were lacking in the stuffing part. Very minimal crab and/or lobster. \\n\\nChurrasco - I found to be unimpressive. The chimichurri gave me awful heartburn and the beef was not of the best quality in my opinion. \\n\\nSaut√©ed wild mushrooms - these were good and made the beef edible.  \\n\\nBerenjena Rellena - this dish was my favorite. I should have ordered this five times! It was a veggie and goat cheese stuffed eggplant roll. It was full of flavor and the sauce was outstanding. \\n\\nEspinacas Gallegos - the dish was my second favorite. It was a saut√©ed spinach with pine nuts and raisins. It was cooked perfectly, the ingredients were fresh, and it tasted wonderful. \\n\\nOverall I would probably not come back here. There were a couple great dishes but they were hit or miss.

The waffle was fluffy with crisp edges, the cheese grits were thick and flavorful, and the country ham was tender and savory.

Im not from the area but in terms of value I felt the prices were high for the quality and portions.\\n\\nA local friend recommended I try the pie.   Now let me tell you that did not disappoint!

Its just more than a hotel in Indian history and culture I believe. Many folks would have the desire even since their childhood to visit Taj once in lifetime. Even there was a regional(Marathi) movie entirely based on this theme.\\n\\nSo seeing 'Taj' in Boston definitely made us feel proud and looking at the Indian entrees on menu at 'The Cafe' even encouraged us more to dine in!\\n\\nSince we were asked to wait for ~30 mins being party of 5, we had a quick walk around the property which has nice buildings etc.\\n\\nThe captain who took us on waitlist and seated us seemed nice person. But the server named Michael M, was really very disturbing person. Right from his first reaction till we left, every comment he made felt like coming from a racist person. He treated us very badly as if we were coming there for free food.\\n\\nSince we already had some drinks while we were waiting we told him that, we just had drinks outside, to which he replied \\"What did you have? Coca cola!\\"\\n\\nWhile ordering, since we were not sure about the portion/size, we just ordered 3 entrees for 5 of us. He suggested that it might not be enough and if you order later, will take a while. We were ok with that.\\n\\nOnce the appetizers came, we realized that 3 dishes might not be enough, we asked the captain to add one more entr√©e. Here comes the aggravated server and asks us - \\"What happened, why did you change your mind? Don't you trust me?\\". Whenever he was coming by for anything he was making some subtle, suggestive comments.\\n\\nAfter the entrees were served, when we asked for one more portion of rice, he was annoyed by that! He insisted us that, these 4 portions combined(looked like just one normal portion which you get elsewhere) should be enough and why do you need more? We still insisted then he said, \\"decide what all you want in one go or the chef will kick his butt!\\" I do not really understand this policy. Do you really expect the guests to decide upfront what all you need without looking at your portions? Are you going to decide how much we should order? Obviously, suggestions are really welcome, but it has to be a friendly gesture!\\n\\nAt the end, we waited for at least 20 mins finishing our dinner just to get the check/bill. Even while giving that, he made funny comments about you can stay back more time waiting for check and why you should hurry etc.\\n\\nOn presenting 4 credit cards, he made faces like anything and complained about having to make difficult(!) calculations. So we rounded it to a good figure which a 2nd grade student can divide by 4 with generous tip, he says \\"You are nice, (with pause) sometimes!\\"\\n\\nHis overall attitude made us feel that we were not welcome there. This was really disappointing from a brand like Taj! I believe it was most disrespectful experience and defeating the value perceived by 'Taj' brand!\\n\\nIn India, we consider guests as god, so this kind of treatment from Taj was totally not expected!"},{"name":"Escobar Restaurant and Tapas","address":"327 Peters St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"So we came here for Sunday brunch... the inside was nicely decorated but the service was probably the worst service I've ever received.

The closer I got to my destination the more I realized I was entering into the middle of a neighborhood within Cocoa in the throes of abject poverty.

It wasn't much longer after that that I noticed Jenny returning with a tray laden with steaming food fresh from the kitchen. \\n \\nFirst up to the Big Boy's perceptive palate was the Smoked Sausage Special.  I found the sausage to be smokey, complex, cooked to perfection and of excellent quality.  It was an eating experience my taste buds earnestly enjoyed.  The home fries, my second favorite breakfast side after bacon and fresh biscuits, OK my third favorite, while being slightly on the overdone side of the cooking scale, were hand cut, hand seasoned and popped on the palate.  My eggs were faultlessly cooked to a perfect over medium and tasted so fresh I half expected to hear a clucking sound as they went down my gullet.  Sadly, this brings us to the biscuit,  Any Southerner worth their salt knows a fresh biscuit from a cooked from frozen one and this was the latter without a doubt.  The biscuit was the only low point of the first selection and as I turned my attention towards the Egg Salad.\\n\\nAfter one bite of my sandwich, I knew I was in the presence of a cook that took pride in creating their meals for the love of serving good food to the public and nothing else.  This was an above average Egg Salad better.  Holding this conglomeration of hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise and just the right amount of seasoning and flavor back from being extraordinary were two things.  First and foremost it was served on plain white bread.  Secondly, while the sliced tomato tasted farm fresh as did the lettuce, the lettuce was our lowly ever popular el cheapo Iceberg.  Look, I get it.  I know exactly where I am and where I am not dining for this meal.  However, for starters, if I may be so bold as to suggest slight tasty improvements on both the bread and lettuce offered for the sandwiches.  Sourdough and green leaf go a long way to upping your food game.  And for the love of your favorite Southern Grandma/Aunt/Mother stop with the frozen biscuits and make 'em the way our ancestors did...from scratch!  Now, let me also be the first to say that if they were indeed made fresh, by all means, change recipes as these fell flat on the taste buds, like so many previously frozen Sysco hockey pucks.  As I said, just a few tweaks and \\"voila!\\" a Hidden Gem in the making!\\n\\nThe Big Boy says, \\"When in Cocoa and hunkering for a decent meal cooked with love and served with charm, you would be wise to make a beeline for the Cocoa Cafe.\\" #bigboydiningout #iamthebigboy"},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"If you are a breakfast lover you must come here!

The peach cobbler French toast...O. M. G. It is more like dessert than breakfast but worth every calorie.

Coming from Los Angeles, it was really nice to see so much green and land on the way to this restaurant. When we finally got to Salt Lick, we were surprised that this place wasn't just a restaurant. It is huge place with plenty to see and eat, and drink!\\n\\nWe parked at the huge parking lot and checked in at the front. We were given a buzzer and an estimate of 15 minutes to get seating for 2. We walked through the area and found the winery house, where my dude and I both got a hefeweizen to beat the heat. Our buzzer buzzed and we were led to the massive dining hall. We sat down and were greeted by our waiter, who was really friendly and helpful.\\n\\nThe BBQ pit is a great sight to view when you enter the restaurant. So much meat right in front of your eyes! The BBQ was pretty good; we got ribs, brisket, and sausages, along with sides of potato salad, cole slaw, toast, and beans. The BBQ was great, but not the best I had while visiting Texas (sorry, it was Franklin - but at least Salt Lick as no wait!). We got the all you can eat option, which is something we regret. The price between the AYCE option and the regular plate was not that much of a difference, but one order from our AYCE meal was already too filling. We did a second order and it was very hard to finish. Then we forgot we ordered peach cobbler and that came in a huge portion (could be shared with 3 or 4 people, seriously). I would definitely recommend not getting the AYCE option and sticking with a regular plate meal.\\n\\nMy mom wanted me to get a dry rub as her souvenir, so my dude and I bought a few of those. We really love the dry rub! We have been using it in most of our cooking, especially chicken wings and pork ribs. We are almost out so I'm looking to buy more next time I come back.\\n\\nOverall, this was a great place to visit while in Austin. You don't only come here for the BBQ, but you come here for the experience! Bring a big group to enjoy! The restaurant and surrounding areas are absolutely beautiful. The staff here is really nice and friendly! The BBQ is also great, but don't get the AYCE option unless you have stretchy pants and don't plan for any other activities for the rest of the day (food coma)."},{"name":"Dim Sum Heaven","address":"5203 Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"If you are fuzhounese like myself and crave the iconic duo - peanut butter noodles and soft wonton soup- this is the perfect spot for you.

They did this so that you HAVE to buy a \\"park-to-park\\" ticket to see all of Harry Potter (and to even ride the Hogwarts train). Universal had no reason to do this except to make more money. They should have put it all in one park and/or allow you to ride the train without having to buy tickets to both parks.\\n\\nIOA is OK, but there is too much concrete and too many buildings. They could have done a better job of \\"staging\\" it. Also, how about some rides for people who don't ride roller coasters? There are almost no rides for \\"us\\"! Very disappointing. I was not really impressed with it - we went into one shop for souvenirs and that was about it.\\n\\nNot sure if the Simpson's area is in IOA or Universal, but I think it is way past it's prime. They could destroy it and no one would mind - the Simpson's are old news (at least in my book). While they did a good job on the theming, I was not blown away by it.\\n\\nUniversal Studios was a bit better - at least it seemed like they were trying to create \\"worlds\\". The Dr. Seuss area is very cute, very colorful and I think they did a good job of bringing Dr. Seuss to life. Kudos to them.\\n\\nUniversal \\"stole\\" some ideas from Disney, such as putting names and \\"occupations\\" on the windows of the buildings. It also seems that they \\"stole\\" the idea of having \\"locations\\" such as New York, San Francisco, etc. However, they didn't do it as well. They tried to put too much into a small area and ended up with lots of \\"stuff\\" but nothing substantial, like shops or rides.\\n\\nWe did go on the Shrek and Minions \\"rides\\" (I would call them shows\\" and I enjoyed them. The seats that move in Shrek, however, didn't sync with the show, so that was a bit disappointing. And the storyline was hard to follow because you couldn't always understand what they were saying. I liked the Minions \\"ride\\" better. Universal also \\"stole\\" the idea of having every show/ride end in a store.\\n\\nThey did an awesome job on the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, though. I was truly impressed with the amount of detail they put into it. However, again, there are no real rides for people who don't want to be (or can't be) shaken/jostled/thrown around except the Hippogriff ride, which we didn't go on. The castle tour was OK, but it needed much better lighting. In all or the movies, the castle is well lit, but in the castle at Universal it was dark, and when you are climbing stairs, some light would be helpful! Also the castle tour needs to allow you to go all the way through, not cut you off after 5 minutes.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Universal doesn't have \\"chicken exits\\" on it's rides, so you miss a lot if you don't want to ride.\\n\\nUniversal & IOA are parks that I have been to a couple of times now and would probably go back to, but not make a habit of visiting. Aside from the WW of HP and the Minions ride, there is really nothing there that attracts me. They just don't seem to put as much \\"fun\\" into what they are doing. There are few places to just sit and watch the world go by, it's hard to find trashcans and there are way too many security people wandering around (makes you wonder why they need so many).\\n\\nLunch at Finnegan's was OK, but my chicken was dry, the \\"garlic\\" mashed potatoes had no flavor and there was no sauce on the dish, which would have made the meal 100% better and given it some flavor. I prefer Raglan Road or Rose and Crown (both at Disney).\\n\\nOne other high spot was Ben & Jerry's!!! Nothing like a cherry Garcia cone to make your afternoon better!\\n\\nThe prices for food and souvenirs is about the same as Disney's prices, so I really can't complain there. But I didn't find anything that really jumped out at me and said \\"buy me\\" except for a Minion's mug (Matt bought his on Minion, which giggles and is very cute). I do have to say that paying $4.00 for a bottle of water is ridiculous, though!\\n\\nHaving to pay $17 or $25 (preferred) for parking in a garage that you have to walk about 1/2 mile to the entrance is outrageous! At least Disney has trams....\\n\\nOf course, your mileage may vary.

The set up was simple yet appetizing; half the plate being rice (which had a very good texture and consistency), and the other half of the beefy goodness. It was a good portion and well worth the price of only $6.95! \\n\\nMay I also mention that I like their self serve water system and their seating arrangements are quite exquisite. The restaurant was clean and very nicely decorated. Aside from the kale, I also surrendered to my sweet tooth by ordering a portion of green tea ice cream (unfortunately that was their only flavor but hopefully there will be more to come since they are still new!). I should say that I am not a big fan of green tea ice cream but I actually enjoyed theirs because it did not have an artificial green tea flavor like many others do, nor was the flavor too overpowering. \\n\\nOverall I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion whether that be a quick bite to eat or a casual sit down with friends or family.

The main reason so far is multiple- 1) they are local and have good ethics and values and supply a place to work that people can actually feel good about working there and making ends meet. (from everything I've heard from employees anyway so far....) 2) I was very ill when they were recently having a once yearly mark down sale on a ver particular product that I go through like crazy. My best friend called me while there and bought me four of this particular item. It was a few days before the last day of the sale. I had planned on getting down there ASAP to buy many more of the same thing while on such a good sale, but I was still under the weather enough that I couldn't leave the house. So, I had the thought to call and just ask if I could pay one the phone with a credit card and have the items held. I spoke with an extremely nice customer service employee (which, really, from what I am gleaning so far, every employee is a customer service employee!!!) whose name was Miel. She took note of my order and promised to pull the items off the shelf and if there were not enough of them to fill the amount I wanted to buy, she promised to write up a rain check for the same price when they got restocked. She took my name and number and all my information and left it in Customer Service for me to retrieve as soon as I could get in. \\n\\nOkay, finally, a few days later I felt slightly better, but still not good enough to get down there. My friend who helped me the last time was super busy and so I called and really just wanted them to let me pay for the items over the phone so they knew I would really be coming in for them. However, when I called no one knew anyone named Miel. So, they transferred me to Kevin, the new Store Director. I explained the situation and he said he had just been transferred to that store, and didn't know anyone with that name, but he wanted to put me on hold and go find either the items on hold or the raincheck written up for them at the sale price. This was the LAST day of the sale. I waited on hold, and when Kevin came back, he said that he indeed DOES have an employee by that name, but that she worked in such a different department that he would have never guessed someone from that area would have helped me with such a grocery issue. This made me feel great, because for one, I wasn't crazy and two this employee had gone so far out of their way and their department to help me when I had called them. So, Kevin matched the UPC code to the one I had given Miel, and she had written down on the raincheck, as there was only one of the them left on the shelf. Fair enough. Only, Kevin said that because the item is a very expensive item and the sale offered it at half price only once per year, that he really couldn't offer the full half off for me- since they did not have them all in stock that day. In other words, he really couldn't do a raincheck for me after all. At first I thought, wow, I kinda think he should since Miel offered that to me without any possibilities that she could not offer it or that it might not be honored when I came in. I explained this to Kevin, but he had a good point too, I mean the product is high end, it is expensive for the company to bring in. I know their profit margin is not that high on this item because their normal price is still dollars less than most other stores. So, instead, he offered to let me buy a case of them at 20% off of the regular price (and it just so happened a case was the exact number that I wanted to buy- and ALL I could AFFORD to buy for now, too- even at half price...much less this new higher price) PLUS, he would take another 10% off for the misunderstanding. \\n\\nI thought this was just awesome. Why? Because Kevin did not have a single argumentative tone in his voice, he explained the entire situation from his perspective and responsibility for the store. And, I want the little guy to succeed in this area of food, the thing we all need. If the small local chain that treats their employees as well as I know this store does (sidetone- I went to college with the daughter of the founder- we weren't friends, but we were good class mates and acquaintances- so I already had a lot of their ethics and values known to me...) then paying 30% less vs. 50% less becomes a really really good deal when Kevin, the new Store Director was so personally professional at explaining his point of view. I already knew the store was good, but this experience as my first shopping experience there is like, WOW, really personal and really good. I can hardly wait to get INTO the store and start really shopping there. It is nice to have this kind of store AND Stadium FM for other things, etc. An open marketplace is something we need to fight to maintain, so we can all live and prosper together as a community- a human community.

It was crowded, loud and noisy but I feel like that environment builds the hype of awaiting your meal. It gave me a chance to check out the other delicious plates. \\n\\nThere are no appetizers, but that's okay because portions are large. We ordered the PULLED PORK SANDWICH, SAUSAGE AND BRISKET COMBO, AND PORK RIB AND BRISKET COMBO, the combos came with Texas style potato salad, coleslaw, and baked beans. All meals were jam packed with meat, you will definitely have to cut the sandwich in half, it's not smothered in hot sauce at all and I felt like it lacked the juiciness and succulence I expected, but got from the brisket which was so tender it fell off the fork. The pork ribs were good too, and not shy of meat either. The coleslaw was ok, nothing special, the potato salad was unique- not made the way you'd expect. And I loved the baked beans which some make sweet, but not these guys. For desert we had the PEACH AND BLACKBERRY COBBLER WITH VANNILLA ICE CREAM, WHICH YOU CAN COMBINE OR CHOOSE SEPARATELY. WE ALSO TRIED THE PECAN PIE, IT WAS GOOOOD.\\n\\n\\nI kinda wished they had more to offer, like corn on the Cobb, apple pie, fresh made lemonade, or more BBQ flavored sauces- they only offer their own brand of hot and mild sauce. And the hot is not really hot and the mild is bland. And I thought it was really weird they didn't have rolls of paper napkins, toothpicks, or bibs around. Pretty standard for a place where meals get you dirty, no? \\n\\nOverall, the environment was cool and the experience was more enjoyable that the food."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

The sides are also meh - the mac and cheese is okay, but I would not recommend the potato salad at all. \\n\\nAll in all, Salt Lick is a restaurant that does well with their service (especially for large groups), but is probably not worth it for the bbq itself."},{"name":"Another Broken Egg Cafe","address":"4745 B Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Visited this place while in Atlanta for a business trip.

After we all looked at the menu we were ready to put in our order. Now, being a BIG fan of Senagaleese food I was really excited, I was soon to be dissapointed. Two of us initally ordered the  \\"Thiebou Yap\\", the waitress told us she would have to \\"check\\" if there were enough for the two of us. She came back and said there was only enough for one person to get the dish, I just cant take that kind of nonsense. It's only 2pm and you are already running out of dishes? Secondly, my friend wanted to order the Yassa Djeun, it is quoted $13 dollars on the menu in the restaurant, and is still $13 on the website(I just took a picture and will upload it shortly); she was told that it was actually $23, what a hige difference! The three of us decided to get the Yassa Guinaar. When the food came out it was lukewarm, Im positive they gave us the Thiou Guinaar as what they gave us was a tomatoe stew, and I have looked at the pictures of the Yassa Guinaar that my fellow yelpers have put up and it is not what we recieved.  The presentation was very nice, and I liked the set up of the restaurant itself. After all that, the waitress came over and told us to keep it down as we were being too loud, I was apalled, I had been to restaurants all over the world and have never heard anything like that. In addition, in my opinion, the waitress was a bit snappy and she seemed to be more attending to other guests. I understand she was overwhelemed as she was the only waitress there, but that is not our fault. We also ordered three sides of sweet plantains, two came out and  it took another ten minutes for the third to come out. I was not at all satisfied after the meal so we decided to order dessert. I ordered the thiakrey which was tasty. Oh I forgot to mention two of the items on the dessert menu were not available! My friend ordered the crepes which she said was not good, I don't remember the item my other friend ordered off the dessert menu but I remember her saying it was drowned in rum and was inedible.\\n\\nI honestly feel sorry for the people who have eaten at Teranga because I do not believe they are eating true Senagaleese cuisine. nor do I believe they even know what true Senagaleese food is, my brother used to live in Dakar, Senegal for over a year and he agrees that this should not be called Senagaleese Cuisine. Boston is really not a place with a lot of options for African cuisine, so it is dissapointing that this is what is available. If you go to Harlem, New York, go to any of the restaurants on 116th Street also known as \\"Little Senegal\\" and you will truly know what Senagaleese Cuisine is(not to mention for half the price and twice the portion size). I get what Teranga is trying to do, but it is not working!\\n\\nI really, REALLY want to try their dinner menu, but it is so hard for me to give them another chance after this past Saturday."},{"name":"BurgerIM","address":"4745C Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4","text":"I don't do reviews.

My wife and I went on a total pig-out of places we've heard many good things about from fellow Yelpers. We started with Small Cakes, then Cami Cakes, and on our third stop we checked into Antico. I WANT TO BE BLUNT HERE. I have NEVER trusted a Southerner to give me any advice on pizza!!! Not to sound arrogant, but I'm a Chicagoan and think the world revolves around Chicago Pizza. If aliens came down to destroy the Earth, I'm am certain they would save Chicago pizzeria's. But today I must eat all the words I have ever uttered about Atlanta pizza, because it was a banner day!!! TODAY, I fell in love with a pizza that is not from Chicago, but from right here in the deep south. \\n\\nI can't rave enough about the entire experience. We got there @ noon, so parking (although pretty full) was still available. Walking in I got the sense immediately of this place being a great gathering spot for friends. The ladies behind the registers were so cute (ooops I meant to say friendly) and patient with us as we didn't know exactly what to order. They recommended the SAN GENNARO but also informed us (after hearing our conversation) they do not allow half & half pizzas, which created a dilemma. You see, my wife doesn't like meat on her pizza and didn't want even the hint of meat flavor, but these pizzas are way to big for just one person. So after a few minutes of careful negotiations we agreed to try it and I would make the ultimate sacrifice of eating ALL of this delicious sausage off her half. We pay for our order and look to find a table. We settled at the large table closest to the cashiers not realizing there was another dining space just behind the wall (duh). Soon after we sat down we heard our number being called and our order arrived. I don't even think 8 minutes had passed. They bring it to your table on a metal cookie tray, with no plate (which I thought was very cool). Can I say how much I loved the Sinatra-type music playing and the down to earth decor!!! It has such a good vibe here.\\n\\nNow for the pizza: From the pictures on Yelp, I was not impressed with the crust because MOST of them looked burnt to me. But our pizza came out perfectly cooked with just the smallest hint of charing, which made me very happy. Then we got a chance to taste... MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!! LOVE IT. The cheese, sauce and sausage were everything I was hoping for in a pizza... but the big and most pleasant surprise came after biting into the sweet (but HOT) red peppers. What a great topping, it totally took this pie to another level for me. There is no doubt Chicago Pizza is still my favorite, but this is the best pizza outside of Chicago I have tasted anywhere. I don't wanna go all Gun-ho in my ratings, so I will need to check-in once more to verify this from a 4 to a 5. But I have FINALLY found a pizza I love in Atlanta.

I figured that, in talking with people from other Spanish speaking countries, she may know where the foods of her Hispanic compadres might be served up.  She mentioned Pambiche.  At first, I thought this was \\"Spanglish\\" for Palm Beach and that A = B = C.  Palm Beach is close to Miami.  Miami is heavily Cuban.  Therefore, Palm Beach could be construed as being Cuban enough by osmosis.  I filed this information away in my head.  Then, I find out it's a real place and that pambiche is its real name and which rhymes with the word \\"ceviche.\\"\\n\\nI gave a friend of mine some shit (neither grief nor marijuana - I do the former but not the latter).  I'm referring to personal possessions.  Karma came around.  I was unexpectedly offered to be taken to lunch.  This friend, who hails from the Bronx and its adjacent communities, lives \\"in town\\" and not in \\"the Clack.\\"  I was thinking a gyro joint in S.E. would have sufficed.  Pambiche was tossed out as an option.  I noted that I could go with that!\\n\\nFirst, the building it occupies is bizarre, but in a good way.  It has these colorful murals which depict the jovial side of Cuban life and culture in addition to being painted in crazy colors and the building facade overhangs the sidewalk, making for an arcade over the sidewalk where there is some outdoor seating.  The restaurant itself is small.  However, it is filled with all sorts of interesting paraphernalia, paintings, and photos referencing Cuba.\\n\\nThe service is very friendly and the employees seem genuinely happy to be working there and making sure you like your meal.  The food is very good.  I had my usual ropa vieja entree with rice and beans and didn't try the \\"moros and cristianos.\\"  My friend had the \\"sanwiche Cubano.\\"  After trying each other's entrees, I'd probably go with the more flavorful \\"sanwiche Cubano\\" next time, where the ingredients came together perfectly.  Prior to the meal, we had croquetas.  They offer several versions and they were good, but I'd be interested in trying the ones stuffed with bacalau (cod).  This whole time, the dessert case was sitting behind us ... and calling.  My friend had a pastry with a coconut exterior and I had a slice of \\"selva negra.\\"  The \\"selva negra\\" is a tall slice of dessert with alternating layers of chocolate cake and passion fruit frosting.  You will be orbiting after trying this cake.  It was excellent and I salivate when I think of it.\\n\\nWhat's not to like?

Disappointed by the way me and my friend were treated last time. Reservation at 11:45am, got it on time, had our meals within 20-25 minutes. However, half way through our meal at about 12:30-35pm, the server comes and asks if we do want anything else, we said we're good as we were still working on what we ordered, so right after he says that he is asking us to free the table within next 20 minutes as they have another reservation at 1pm. There are so many disappointmenting factors about this. First of all, never ever approach your guests half way through their meal and notify them to free the table in minutes. If you had the table reserved you should let your guests know right before you hand them the menu. Secondly, that was a clear and open invitation out as we refused to order anything else in that moment. Had we ordered something else, we would not be asked to free the table? The restaurant's policy/logic on that is pretty clear. They are classier ways to politely escort your guests out without being so disrespectful.

So, in my estimation, they get 3 stars. \\n\\nI called to make a reservation as my friends and I were all meeting in Boston from various parts of the country. The woman on the phone was very sweet, and said that they don't take reservations for parties of less than 6, but if we showed up around 7 they'd be able to seat our table of 4 no problem. \\n\\nSo we showed up at 7. We were greeted warmly by the charming host and hostess, and could see the place was packed to the gills. A 20 minute wait, they told me. No problem, we'll hang out and chat on the patio seeing as the bar is full. Then it started to rain. We waited in the rain for about 40 minutes, hoping with each passing moment our turn would be in the next. \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated, it took a good 10 minutes for our server to make an appearance and hurriedly give us our menus. Another 10 went by before she came back, and even then she only took our drinks order, even though we had so many questions about the charcuterie menu. How large is a portion? How many people will it feed? How much is enough for the four of us? Is the cheese pasteurized?* We were finally able to ask the dude who brought over our drinks, and by the time our snacks hit the table, we were ravenous.\\n\\nI should mention we finally ate dinner around 9pm. I should also mention that the full portion of pasta I ordered only came out as a half order, which the server didn't even notice until one of my friends mentioned it. The sweet hostess who had greeted us delivered my actual order with apologies and charm. Cute, but not enough to sway me. \\n\\nWhen the place emptied out half way through our meal, we were privy to the staff gossiping and the chef screaming about how and why he had just fired someone. This was all rounded out by the lovely smell of the garbage, full of ripe and stanky cheese, being taken out right near us. Such a treat. \\n\\nIn closing, I shall not be returning to The Salty Pig anytime soon. Too bad, because the food is awesome and the place could be amazing. \\n\\n*Answers: A meat, a cheese and an accoutrement per two people for a light snack or three of each per table of four, and the cheese is all pasteurized.

Friendly greeting from staff. No hassle sign-in. We dropped off our bags. We parked a block away on 13th and Washington for $25 a day (deal through the hotel). Another lot is $16 a day if you don't plan to take your car out.\\n\\nThe Room:\\n     We were in a deluxe king suite (bathroom included). It's an old building with an old clunky elevator. The oxidized brass panelling on the elevator along with the old style light fixtures and warm colors give the place a sense of faded luxury and enduring quality - something from film noir. The art work is of far higher quality than it appears online. And the 4th floor room smelt and looked CLEAN - not heavily perfumed, but fresh, well-kept, and clean.\\n     The room is small, has no tv, but bathroom shower was big. Fan worked very well.\\nThe deck (only available with this type of room) was small, but a cool place to hang out and enjoy a complimentary morning coffee. We had to sleep with windows and French doors shut, as our room looked over Burnside, a busy street, but heavy drapes and shut doors/windows kept out the noise well enough. The A/C worked very well.\\n     Terry-towel robes are provided with the room. They were well-worn, but necessary for a trip to the washroom (if you don't get the deluxe king), or for a trip to the subterranean salt-water pool, where you can bring your drinks in plastic cups (It was fantastic!).\\n     The bed was decent - on the firm side.\\n\\nLocation:\\nPearl District  - close to other craft breweries if you want to get out from under McMenamin's all-encompassing umbrella. Otherwise, Al's Den and The Zeus Caf√© (part of the hotel) have everything you'd need. Powell's books is almost across the street, and the food cart area is a short walk from the hotel. Also recommended: Blue Star Donuts just around the corner on Washington St.\\n\\nOverall:\\nI really liked the place. It's right in the heart of everything. It's couple-oriented - more for adventurer tourists than business people.  It's clean and hip. I loved looking at all of the rock n roll themed paintings (worth it to walk down the stairways just to see these). A lot of work has been done. It would NOT be great for people with mobility issues.\\n\\nOne thing you've got to take advantage of is the complimentary pass to McMenamin's Mission Theatre, where you can buy craft beer, pizza, and other food to enjoy with your movie.

There is generally a long line so we come after the lunch rush is over which is around 1:30ish. \\n\\nThe food is decent for the most part.  A bit oily but you expect that for Taiwanese dim sum. We usually go for the fried dough, the sweet soybean milk, Taiwan style lo mein, spareribs, fried chitlins, pan fried ravioli, and the turnip cake. The chitlins are my favorite which is on the heavy side but so worth it. The fried dough is fried to perfection and goes well with the soybean milk. You have to drink a gallon of water to flush out all the grease after your meal but you forget that part of it and end up coming back for another round in a couple of months. \\n\\nNow service on the other hand is virtually nonexistent.  All the waiters barely speak English so i suggest ordering by the numbers on the menu. If you speak Mandarin, you're all set.  While food comes out fast, the plates are thrown in front of you and they are quick to clear your table even if you have food on it.  More recently they added a 15% gratuity fee to the bill probably because service was so bad customers weren't leaving anything extra. \\n\\nIn short, don't expect great service.

Looking over the main menu and special menu, I nearly instantly knew what I wanted for the first two, but kept jumping back and forth between my option for the third. Eventually, I decided to go with the Pork Belly, Short Rib, and Chicken Curry Bao, deciding to save the crab cake bao I was considering for a different day. Around 5-6 minutes after placing my order, my name was called, and I returned to the counter to pick it up. \\n\\nAll three bao were beyond delicious, but the stand out for me was the Short Rib.

The sweet and sour chicken was a bit chewy. I don't know why they include it, but the soup is terrible. I think they try to water it down so that you don't notice how funky it tastes. \\n\\nVariance (~): I got a disproportionate amount of the bok choy vegetables relative to the other entrees.

I was having trouble with my phone, as it kept telling me there was no wait, but this certainly was not the case when arrived.

Quick, easy, efficient.\\n\\nThe menu has all your breakfast basics, with a few unique options.  One of these, which I immediately zeroed in on, was the chicken & waffles.  I've heard about this combination, never thought of it to be something I would have a craving for, but for whatever reason, I had to order it.  My daughter got the pecan french toast, my wife got a egg sandwich, and my son ordered pancakes.  ( a quick side note, if you've got a picky eater, like my son, who MUST have chocolate chips or chocolate sauce on his pancakes, then pack your own, as this place only has maple syrup.)\\n\\nI expected the food to rush out due to the high volume of people in this place, but they took their time making our meal.  I will say that when the food finally arrived and I bit into my chicken & waffles, it was AWESOME.  They had mixed in a bit of syrup into the chicken and over the waffles.  Wow.  Everyone else was happy with their breakfast and my daughter's french toast was a hit as well.  My son fretted that his pancakes were too \\"plain\\" since they didn't have chips or choco sauce on them, but he made do with the plain pancakes and they were delicious.\\n\\nCome here for breakfast, expect a wait, but USE THE YELP APP.\\n\\nParking limited in the front, but I saw a sign for parking in the rear.

With the glowing reviews on Yelp, I was honestly expecting a nice dining experience, yet we received the complete opposite. I took guests visiting from NYC here and was embarrassed that I picked this place out. My main gripe is the service and the cramped cave of a space they use as a dining room. \\n\\nFirst, we waited about 30-45min to get into the restaurant, which would have been fine if we were treated with some respect once we got inside. From the second we stepped foot in the restaurant the wait staff was screaming at us to move swiftly to our table. The issue was that a group was leaving and blocking our path, yet  we continued to get barked at. \\n\\nOnce seated we were squeezed between the other tables and we were repeatedly hit in the back by wait staff and other customers. The cramped condition made our experience uncomfortable and unbearably hot (it was cooler outside in the eighty-five degree weather).  \\n\\nThe speed at which our food was served and cleared made it obvious that this is a tourist mill. I know this isn't high class dining, but nevertheless, when I pay money at a restaurant I expect to be treated with some common courtesy and have some level of relaxation. I am sure the wait staff is pushed to their limits with the sheer volume of customers here, but the overall tone of the experience was to rush customers out. \\n\\nAlthough the food was decent, it's was not worth the aggravation. Some Yelp reviewers viewed the service as \\"charming\\" because of the \\"no nonsense\\" attitude, but that is NOT my idea of a nice dining experience. Politeness goes a long way in life.

The salmon had great potential and we liked the mustard sauce, but the fish itself was rather limp throughout, definitely not seared, so lacked texture.   The mashed potatoes were fine, and we liked the caper topping, but they needed salt and more creaminess.   We didn't care for the broccoli rabe.  It was bitter and lacked any seasoning.

This was my first time in Portland. I was under the impression this was a wing spot - but it's a Thai spot with many traditional options. They sat us quickly and served peanuts with Thai chilies and kaffir lime leaves. We ordered the one dish of wings they have (first thing on the menu). Our server also recommended a local fruit salad. We ordered two beers - Pok Pok Pils and Buoy. The wings came very quickly, with a bowl for bones and wipes for our sticky fingers. The wings were large - technically there were 6, but it was really 12 wings and they were very filling. They also came with a side of cucumbers and some pickled vegetables - like carrots and cabbage. We liked the wings. We did not enjoy the local fruit salad much. It took a very long time to come out (we were nearly finished with our wings) and had been sitting on the counter waiting to be served for a bit of time. While it did come with one rambutan, and some pineapple, much of the fruit salad was various different apples. There were interesting spices on it, but it was very watery. The dried shrimp didn't pair well and were very difficult to chew. The metal water glasses/water smelled of coconut water - which would be great if we were drinking coconut water - but not as pleasant when you expect water. The servers were kind - and to be fair, we might have enjoyed it more if we'd ordered other things.

I have to admit it's been a while since my last visit. Our family has grown a bit since then and traveling with infants can be difficult. \\n\\nYears ago when we first discovered Raglan Road, it was great because my husband and I were able to drink cold beers and enjoy the live performances without kids in tow.  The Springs also seemed a bit more open and airy. The parking lot was just one level so on good days you could park and easily walk right in. \\n\\nNow fast forward a few years and things have definitely changed. The parking lot is gone and has been replaced with huge parking garages around most of the Springs. We found the closest garage near Raglan Road and found a parking spot on the first floor. After getting the stroller out, we were a bit annoyed seeing we couldn't just walk right in. We had to take an elevator to the second floor of the parking garage and walk to some escalators across a catwalk.  Since we had a stroller, we had to take some nearby elevators once again to reach the first floor.  The whole setup just seemed poorly planned.   Yes parking may be much better and easier now, but they didn't have to surround the entire area with nothing but garages. To me it just made the area an ugly eyesore. \\n\\nWhen we made our way to Raglan Road, it was about 230 in the afternoon and there was no hostess to be seen. The sign by the hostess station said to wait to be seated, but after waiting for about five minutes we were wondering if we were suppose to seat ourselves. Finally a waitress came up and apologized. She explained the hostess must have went on break. She then asked us to park our stroller outside the restaurant.  I was a bit confused at first because there was only two other families dining in the restaurant. One even had their stroller with them. My husband told her it was fully collapsible (which it was. It's approved for airplane overhead storage) and so the waitress said it would be fine to bring it in. My guess she was just making the request because it's probably the norm during high volume hours. So if you have a family with small children, be prepared to have to park the stroller outside during busier hours. \\n\\nWe ordered some food for our girls and my husband got wings while I ordered the lobster sandwich. As per usual with Disney, the children's meal was absolutely fantastic. I cannot rave enough how conscientious Disney is about making sure kids eat healthy, quality food. Hands down they put 99% of most restaurants to shame. However, my husband and I weren't as impressed with our meals.  His chicken wings were soggy and slimy. It was like they boiled the chicken and coated them with a thick sauce. Honestly, what I think happened was that they were fried, coated, and left under the warming light for a bit before they were brought out.  Strange thing was, it couldn't have been just sitting under a lamp waiting for the other dishes to be done because none of the dishes were served together. The girls got their food first, my plate came 5 minutes later, and then my husband got his another 5 minutes after mine.  My lobster sandwich was good, but FYI it's a cold lobster sandwich. That doesn't make it bad, but I just prefer warmer lobster sandwiches like the Connecticut style lobster rolls. \\n\\nThe waitress was nice enough to re-fire my husband's wings, but the look on her face was pretty funny. She looked a bit annoyed when my husband described them as slimy so there was a brief moment where you could see she wasn't too happy having to deal with a re-fire. Nonetheless, she was apologetic and got hot, crispy wings out to my husband rather quickly. \\n\\nOverall, we still enjoyed our visit to Raglan Road, but we didn't feel like the food was the same quality as it use to be. Would we go back again?  Probably not until our toddlers are a bit older. Until then, it's just not worth the hassle of driving over to the Springs or catching the tram from one of the resorts."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Had a good experience.

NEVER have an issue when dining in. The servers are always so genuine pleasant and knowledgeable. Unfortunately it seems as though once you get above the front line staff, there seems to be some type of breakdown on the basics- customers keep our doors open and lights on. \\n\\nThe pattern of incompetency and inability to resolve what seems like simple issues with any missteps ordering food to go (catering, online ordering and walk-in) is unacceptable. \\n1st Incident - Was overcharged for catering, only to not have all of the items ordered, after reviewing the order at least 3 times before the day of the event. It was as if the manager made up the prices as he went along. I had to refer to the menu to show him how the costs of each item did not meet up to his magical total.\\n2nd Incident - Was refused seating 30 minutes before the place closed and the hostess suggested ordering to-go. Oto be treated like an inconvenience by the woman taking to-go orders. In her rush to get us out the door, forgot an entire meal and had to run us down in the parking lot. \\n3rd Incident - Ordered online via OrderSnapp on 11.04. An hour after placing the order I received an email (not a phone call or even notification via app) that \\"there was an issue reaching the restaurant and your order has not been confirmed\\". I contact OrderSnapp, they tell me to call the store. (I also requested the refund online via email response at least twice that same day). The young lady who answered the phone was pretty clueless so I asked for a manager. Courtney comes on the line, and after looking into the system she realizes your staff totally overlooked my online order for over an hour, she very nonchalantly remarks that it had been missed and they would start making it now. I told her I didn't want to want another 30-45 minutes and asked her to cancel my order and issue a refund. She tells me to contact OrderSnapp and when I ask for the store/general manager, she tells me to call back after hours. Of course I haven't reached or been contacted by anyone at ABC, gotten no response to my online requests to be contacted nor recieved my refund. (I also spoke with 3 Order Snapp message takers who all said the refund had been requested.)  In an attempt to follow up today, I can say both Order Snapp and ABC are consistent- recieved more of a run around from Order Snapp and when I called the main phone line for ABC, I spoke with a very unpleasant man who identified himself as Anthony (but that could just be his stage name because there was a long pause when I asked for his name). I began explaining what happened and was quickly cut off and advised that I had called the \\"number for large orders\\". Once I told him I was calling again based on the advice I had recieved from Courtney previously, I began explaining my issue. He asked for my c9ntact 8nformation and then again asked what happened. This time he wanted details- what I ordered, how much was the meal, etc, etc. At this point I am totally irritated and begin to question him asking if he isn't the one to handle the problem, why does he need that even of detail to pass on a message. The final straw falls when he then tells me (and I am paraphrasing here) that he's trying to help me and if I don't give him the information he can just hang up and I can deal with the situation the best way I can. ABC has truly struck out with me. I cannot spend money nor encourage other to do so where my business is not appreciated and customer service especially by those you would expect to operate on an even higher level, is not a priority."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"If you're getting Salt Lick BBQ, driving to Driftwood would give you a true rustic experience that would make you remember this meal more than the BBQ itself.

As someone with celiac, it felt like a slap in the face that it was not truly gluten free due to cross contamination that could be *so easily* avoided. (You would think I would be used to disappointment after 13 years of celiac, but apparently not...)\\n\\nIf you're gluten free by preference or don't have a severe gluten intolerance, you're probably fine to try this. But if it's severe or you have celiac, I would stay away."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Looking for original Texas BBQ - this is your must go to place.

The hot vegetables were also well-seasoned and paired well together. I completely skipped the cold salad, however.

Very nice sized, hand cut wedges, but no seasoning.  No flavor at all. Just plain potatoes. There weren't even salted to my liking.

This place is fairly amazing. Show up hungry! \\nThe Salt Lick is probably one of the most famous BBQ joints in the entire Lone Star State. It's a gigantic restaurant, kind of in the middle of nowhere, outside of Austin in the Texas Hill Country. It's a beautiful place, with the exterior walls and seating areas covered in pink and purple flowers, with lots of Texas-style patio furniture. Inside, you'll find a smoking pit with tons of meat splayed out around the flames. I've heard that this process can't be replicated elsewhere in Texas, because this style of cooking meat over an open fire pit indoors violates some sort of fire safety code, but this place was grandfathered in, because it's so old. \\nThe BBQ isn't the best in the state. It's just copious, plentiful, and meaty. The all you can eat deal comes with sides, and a selection of sausage, brisket and ribs. The brisket is the best, but it's a bit on the lean and dry side for my tastes. The BBQ sauce comes in more of a Carolina style, vinegary and mustardy. They're pretty good about bringing more and more and more meat. They don't try to fill you up on bread and stall on the meats like some places do. \\nThis restaurant goes on and on and on- it's a large place with lots of seating, and places for parties or conferences. The seating is mostly picnic tables. On the way out to pay the bill (they only accept cash), be sure to check out the t-shirt and souvenir selection! Won't all the folks back home be jealous?!\\nFortunately, they have outdoor seating that is not part of the restaurant, where you can relax and wait for a table if they're full. If you're full, the outdoor recliners and rocking chairs are also a great place to relax and digest for a while.

For the uninitiated, Indian cuisines can broadly be divided into the four directions, with the most popular cuisines in the US belonging to the North (chicken tikka masala, paneer saag etc.) or the South (crepes - dosa, rice cakes - idlis etc). You'll rarely find a restaurant serving West-Indian cuisine, it's great but for some reason not as popular.\\n\\nThis restaurant offers a mix of North and West Indian cuisine. I am a maharashtrian (from West India), which is why we are over the moon having found this place. We had zunka bhakar, a popular dish in Mumbai, which blew us away. The bhaakar (type of bread made of sorghum) is a much healthier option for those who are more used to Naan or rotis, and way tastier. We also enjoyed the kolhapuri chicken and the phenomenal eggplant (bharlele vaang). All these are typical Konkan/Maharashtrian dishes. Others I could identify on the menu are pomfret (fish), columbi (prawn/shrimp), sol kadi (a soup of sorts), koshimbir (which they have called as raita) and a few others. We cook some of these things at home often, but to taste it in a restaurant and that too of such authentic quality brought tears to our eyes. The only regret being that we couldn't meet and thank the owner for this experience. And that we live 2 hours away, so we can't eat here often.\\n\\nMy request to the owner would be to consider adding 'palak chi pattal bhaji' if at all possible and potentially, a couple of Maharastrian deserts.

Once everything was ordered and delivered, we also had to hunt down someone for silverware and napkins.  Most likely these are things that go more smoothly inside as they are probably set up automatically or delivered with the hostess, but not as seamless in a \\"seat yourself\\" deck situation.  \\n\\nHowever, despite the hiccups, out waiter was very nice and polite, and I wouldn't be opposed to visiting again if in the area."},{"name":"Polonia","address":"750 S US Hwy 17-92","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"We must have driven by and commented that we should try this place a hundred times.

Sure this is a tapas restaurant but towards the bottom of their menu they have larger shareable plates. These take about 30-40 minutes to prepare so let your waiter know asap if that's what you want. Our favorite shareable item on the dinner menu: Chicken Pimientos\\n- Tapas Tapas Tapas! Let me just get right to our go-to's: Gambas Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp), Burrata (soft cheese), Pulpo Gallego (Octopus), Patatas Bravas (Potatoes), Albondigas (Meatballs), Hanger Steak (No translation needed for that), and Beef Empanadas.\\n- The wine selection here is extraordinary. Every waiter or waitress we've ever had has knowledge about the wine menu and makes awesome recommendations. Tip: On Mondays, we order a whole bottle because they're half off!\\n-Service is phenomenal! Til this day, I don't think we've had such good service like we did the first time we came here to celebrate a work promotion. The level of attention from multiple waiters was just incredible!

But I've never left Barcelona with a complaint about the service. \\n\\nOther recommendations: Check the parking deck behind Inman Perk Cafe for free self parking before paying for valet. You may get lucky and find a spot! Also please make a reservation on the weekends.

When there was an issue with my payment method, the manager handled it in a way that made me feel like a valued guest.  My leftovers were well wrapped for the trip home.  My water was topped off regularly.  As I exited the bar and tried to remember which way I had entered from, I was quickly pointed in the right direction.  Yet, when I passed the hostess stand, the 4 employees continued to chit-chat amongst themselves, and not one looked up and gave me a smile, or bid me a fare thee well.\\n\\n*** 3/2017 RW ***\\n\\nWhen there was a crowd standing between me and the hostess stand as I walked in for Dine Out Boston Winter 2017 (3 courses, $25), I did not get a good feeling.  But I did have a reservation, and they had already checked in, so onward and inward!  My friend was already standing there, having checked in first.  It still was nearly 10 min past our reservation that we were finally seated behind a few larger parties.\\n\\nIf you want a bit of the backstory of the location of Ruth's Chris Steak House, let the staffer seating you know that it is your first time.\\n\\nThe bread was nice and warm, and the butter of good spreading consistency.  We completely decimated that loaf.  Appetizers arrived minutes later.  I preferred my steak house salad (nice and simple) over her tomato soup with basil (a stronger tomato flavor than I like).\\n\\nThe filets (8 oz) arrived nearly 30 min after the appetizers were presented.  I loved cooking slices of my tender rare steak on the sizzling hot buttered plate.  Both sides (mashed potatoes and creamed spinach) were just as well received.\\n\\nThere was a wait for dessert as well, as it arrived another 30 min after.  The bread pudding was warm and moist, but the whiskey cream sauce was dealt with a heavy hand, and much boozier than normal.\\n\\nWe were presented with the bill as our dessert plates were cleared.  But paying it, that was tough as we needed to get the attention of someone who could bring us one of those mobile charge card machines.  Though the food itself was great, we felt a bit held captive here on this visit as we only had the average work day lunch break, with intentions to go over just a little since it was Restaurant Week.  Instead we were at Ruth's Chris for 1 hour and 45 min, and so we burst out of there like freed prisoners seeing sunlight for the first time in years, and scurried back towards our respective work places with full bellies in tow.\\n\\n*** 8/2017 RW ***\\n\\nService was well paced without being brisk.  I was handed the bill an hour after I headed out to the restaurant.\\n\\nThough it all tasted good, I had unintentionally ordered a baby food sort of meal, in which I didn't really have to chew anything, so it wasn't the most satisfying:\\n\\nRed Lentil Cauliflower Soup\\nSizzlin' Blue Crab Cakes\\n  Two jumbo lump crab cakes served sizzling with lemon butter.\\nCreamed Spinach\\nWarm Bread Pudding with Whiskey Cream Sauce\\n\\nThe crab cakes were small, primarily shredded meat with a few chunks tossed in for good measure.  I topped some of their lovely bread with it to make a sort of open faced sandwich to satisfy my desire for something to chew on.  Speaking of which, I was sad to see that their $9 Happy Hour menu no longer lists that oh so good crab BLT.\\n\\nReminder to self: wear something with sleeves or bring a cardigan.

He took 15 more minutes to get it to us.  Since I could see all 3 of his tables, I knew he wasn't busy.  As a server its hard for me to leave less than 20%, but we gave him 18%..which is honestly more than he deserved.  \\n\\nThe next day my boyfriend noticed on his credit card statement that Brian had added 2 more dollars to his tip.  He e-mailed the customer service of the restaurant and talked to the Owner, Eddie.

We try and get out a few times a month to eat at some of the better restaurants in Boston.\\n\\nWe got there early and had a drink at the bar and then we were seated at our table in the dining room. Bar was nice and drinks were good.\\n\\nWe ordered 3 Apps. The Server told us they were the best three on menu\\n1.Scallops ( Very very Bland & Boring & small)\\n2.Octapus  ( Tender & Tasty but far from mind blowing)\\n3. Pasta with wild Boar (The best of the three but still i expected much more)\\n\\nAs we finished the apps The dirty plates sat in front of us as our water was filled and server asked how we liked everything. But no one took plates so I ended up asking if they could take them. \\n\\nOur Main Dish,\\nMy Wife got the Roasted Chicken and i got The Pork Trio. I have read good things about both of these dishes in other reveiws.\\n\\nHere is where Craigie loses me. \\n\\nThe mains came out and they were the same size if not smaller than the appitizers. Both dishes tasted ok. Again far far FAR from mind blowing. The pork dish came with 1 pork rib, a small piece of pork belly and another small piece of pork. My wifes Chicken was gone in a couple bites.  We understand fine dining  and more is not always better, but this was like a joke.  \\n\\nSo after about  2 minutes of eating our tiny main dish it was time to think about dessert. My Plate was cleared but my wifes sat in front of her for way to long.

The Flavor profiles were not that good and portion size was all wrong. There are so many amazing places to eat in Boston that crush this place.

Generally speaking, the food is good, but there are items that lack. I tried the chicken curry and it was revolting. It was fried chicken bits in a flavorless sauce. Granted, I'm comparing to a restaurant in Chinatown, but if one advertises it, it should be comparable. The avocado salad was just OK. Stir fired noodles were just OK as well. \\n\\nOn the bright side, the sushi & drink combos are excellent, as are the sushi deluxe, chicken & beef teppanyaki, the ala carte nigiri, chirashi and the makimono. Service sometimes is slow when they're busy inside, which is why I usually order delivery. Never a problem with delivery and the drivers have always been exceptionally nice and have been overtipped as a result.\\n\\nOn the downside, on Yelp! there are 309 photos of the food; however, when you click the link to view them, there are no descriptions.

They had just opened, and we weren't much impressed that first time. I finally tried this establishment again and the experience was remarkably better. Rather than rehash my prior review, I'll simply replace it with this current one, which I believe reflects the current state of Acitron.\\n\\nWe arrived around 7:00 P.M. and were seated promptly. The room was lively and crowded, but not chaotic. I sensed an air of confidence. This restaurant is thriving after a few years, when many restaurants often fail. \\n\\nI enjoyed the Mole Poblano entre. Honestly, this is a unique presentation. The main dish is a carefully formed mound of shredded chicken carefully engulfed in just the right amount of mole (a rich, spicy, chocolate enhanced authentic Mexican sauce). My initial fork full seemed a tad bland at first, but soon the flavor developed and the balanced heat of chile came through. I then tore off pieces of the warm corn tortillas provided to grab up and eat the rest (as is the customary way to enjoy such a dish). The best mole I have had since moving to the Boston area over 10 years ago. Served with my dish was an exceptional Spanish rice (light, fluffy, delicately spicy) and a small bowl of nicely prepared homemade frijoles. Three things stood out about this dish. The presentation was clean and pleasing. The portions were generous. The seasonings were spot on. Nothing was missing; nothing was overwrought or heavy handed. Very satisfying. Having grown up in Southern California and visited Mexico numerous times, and having dined in zillions of Mexican establishments, I am finally pleased to enjoy a restaurant that captures the essence of what I've been trying to find since relocating to New England.\\n\\nMy dining companion ordered the chile rellenos (a cheese stuffed roasted pepper). It was prepared with care too, but I was startled that it lacked the traditional egg batter crust, which adds an additional dimension to the traditional chile relleno dish. In all my years of eating chile rellenos, whether prepared by my friends from old Mexican families in San Diego, or in any Mexican restaurant in the Southwest, this was the first time I'd seen the dish served without the flavorful egg batter crust. It's akin to having a hot dog without a bun if that's what you're used to. Again, it wasn't awful; it was simply disappointing to this experienced palate.\\n\\nThe only other minor disappointment was our appetizer being forgotten. Once reminded, our server brought our chicken taquitos to our table with apologies (and kindly offered at no charge). The taquitos were nicely prepared. They aren't the greasy ones that one craves from the late night taco places after the clubs close in San Diego, rather these were quite light and delicate--downright healthful--for taquitos, and fitting for this establishment. Again, the preparation was with pride and care. No complaints about these upscale taquitos, nicely accompanied with a green tomatillo sauce and greens for garnish.\\n\\nWe ordered desserts too. Yay! The flan was generous (it's a silky custard dish) with a caramel sauce in which it is baked (with a touch of cinnamon). The flavors were perfect. We spooned up every drop of sauce. The chocolate mouse cake was equally satisfying. I was impressed with the freshness. Many times, restaurants may serve up a dry old slab of cake drenched in chocolate sauce. This was not the case. The thin layer of cake was still moist and soft. The thick dark chocolate mouse layer atop was smooth and tasty too.\\n\\nThis restaurant has well come unto its own. The crowd, enjoying $7.00 Margarita night, was happy and chatty. The excellent food held our attention. We got chatty after dessert. We will return."},{"name":"Brooklyn Pizza","address":"240 N Liberty St","city":"Powell","stars":"4","text":"Called to place an order and voicemail suggested calling back in a half hour?

With its bright colors, friendly staff, and flavor combos, I felt a little Miami - a nice feeling. \\n\\nOrdered something called the \\"Palm Beach Cooler\\" to start off our meal - a simple wine/juice combo (almost a white sangria, but lighter). Good flavor, a little on the sweet side, and a sugar cane added in (yes we asked if we could eat it) if you want it a bit sweeter. Never heard of this before, so wasn't sure if it was a restaurant-created choice.\\n\\nMy friend ordered an appetizer plate with empanadas, tostones, and a few side salads. I ordered their stew, or ajiaco, which tasted like an abuelita dish (for sure).  The tostones were good here, not too heavy, and the empanadas were crisp (so many cultures have variations of this dish - in LA, argentine seem to make my favorites). The stew was a bit lighter than I expected, almost needed to put in the rice to thicken it up.  Not too spicy, not too strong, not too much meat. I wouldn't order it again, but I'm glad I tried it - if I were sick, I'd consider this alternative to the chicken soup.\\n\\nThe crowd/wait issue here is no joke here - don't make the mistake of going inside and asking to be written on the list (you'll lose your position this way). It's usually posted outside by the door and you write on it yourself. There are heaters outside, although on this night, they weren't really needed. The interior is cozy or tight...tables are close and it can be somewhat difficult to move around. I sat at the bar for the best mobility, but I can see it being an issue for larger groups. I'd say max out your table to 5, and plan on sitting outside if it's a nicer day.\\n\\nIf I do come back here on my next trip, I'll try the happy hour and brunch options - seems like those were recommendations I missed out on."},{"name":"The Phil","address":"4250 SW Rose Biggi Ave, Space 12","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"I have tried to get to this food cart few times, but each time I tried, it was closed, finally last week I was lucky and they were open,  there was quite a line and I had to wait very long time,  but I was impressed about the great customer service of the lady running the food preparation, she was awesome, and kind and sweet and she apologized for the long wait and offered to let me have the sandwich for free, but I wanted to pay first because of this great customer service gift she has and then because wow, it was yummy, I have not tasted anything more delicious in Portland I ordered the basic Philly steak and I was very pleased.

Sad to say I don't think I will venture out of my way again as the Salt Lick is not THAT fabulous. \\n\\nI must give credit where credit is due. The portions are very generous! I ordered the two meat place with brisket and sausage. It came with coleslaw, beans, and potato salad. There were two brisket options, lean or moist. I choice moist, but it wasn't the tear apart with your fork melt in your mouth kind of brisket I was expecting. Yes it was good, but nothing to write home about. The potato salad was very different - it resembled mashed potatoes more so than potato salad. The beans were very average. They tasted smoky but that's the only real 'flavor' I could make out. I prefer creamy coleslaws so can't say I was overly impressed with this one. The BBQ sauces were tasty and come in two different levels of spiciness. All items are served with bread (yum!), pickles, and onions.\\n\\nNot sure what people are talking about with extensive lines and such because we walked in at peak lunchtime hours on a Saturday and were seated immediately.

As it is my first time here I opted for the Bandeja which came as a recommendation. My server suggested to have it with tacos and utilize it to scoop up the food from the plate. The Bandeja comes with beef, that is well seasoned and tender, a fried plantain - cooked to perfection, rice topped with a fried egg, a side of freshly made guacamole drizzled with lime juice, zesty salsa and and beans (the musical fruit, the more you eat, the more you toot), which after tasting myself I would highly recommend for all you first timers.

They were able to seat us immediately, but let's be honest now, how many people are wanting to spend New Year's Eve at an airport?\\n\\nWe ordered the MCO Traveler's Trio of appetizers, which is $17.95 for 3 appetizers, which comes out to be just under $6 per appetizer. We thought, hey, maybe this will be a good deal. FALSE. It was NOT a good deal by any means. The presentation of the Traveler's Trio is lovely. They bring out the appetizers on a three tiered display thing, but perhaps because they are limited by the size of the plates that fit on their display, the portions were rather small for the price. It is possible that we just did not order the right appetizers for the Trio, but for $6 per app, I just could not find a way to justify it. \\n\\nAppetizers:\\n- Fresh avocado almond chicken salad: This was such a letdown. It sounded really appetizing on the menu, but what it turned out to be was just one avocado, sliced into halves, with a dollop of \\"chicken salad\\" placed in the center of each half. The taste was mediocre at best, and the portion was tiny.\\n\\n- Spring rolls: THIS. THIS WAS THE WORST. I can't believe that we paid $6 for this ($7 if we had just ordered it by itself). The plates came out and we were presented with 2 of the tiniest \\"spring rolls\\" you have ever seen. I was so amused that they gave us a giant cup of dipping sauce for them, because how in the world did they expect us to use all of that sauce for two spring rolls that were barely the width of two of my fingers put together? (And no, I do not have fat fingers). I was not wow-ed by the taste either. You could probably buy an equivalent tasting spring roll in the frozen section of your local supermarket.\\n\\n- Calamari: Calamari is calamari. Here, it was calamari, just less of it and on a smaller plate.\\n\\nBecause according to Chinese culture, you're supposed to eat fish on New Year's for good luck, we ordered some sushi (Crispy tuna roll and rainbow roll) to go with our appetizers. This was also a disappointment because the sushi was pretty average and overpriced for what we got. But really, why would we go to a place called \\"McCoy's Bar and Grill\\" and expect good sushi?\\n\\nMy sister and I ordered a mango smoothie to split. It was incredibly sour, but did taste like it was actually made with real mango. But as with all the other things at McCoy's, it was so overpriced. \\n\\ntl;dr: Maybe we just didn't order the right things, but I was not at all impressed with McCoy's. It was very average and overpriced for what you got. I know airport/hotel prices are normally inflated, but I am still smarting over those $6-$7 spring rolls."},{"name":"Maria's Pastry Shop","address":"46 Cross St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Spent a few days in the Boston area and the North End in Boston is reputed to be the Italian neighborhood with authentic food so was looking for an \\"Authentic\\" Italian bakery and the only one I found to have a few lease known and very Italian pastries was Maria's!

My Sweetie's Best friend recommended any beers by Cigar City Brewing, which is supposedly an up and coming brewery. Our waiter briefed us on more information on the beer menu. We never felt rushed. I ended up with the Strawberry Cucumber Mojito, which was one of the best I've had. There isn't a muddled goop of mint on the bottom of my drink. There was a fresh slice of cucumber in it and it wasn't very sweet -- just how I like it. My Sweetie ordered the Jai Alai IPA from Cigar Brewing and also ended up trying a Red Ale. He enjoyed both beers. Great recommendations from our waiter.\\n\\nNow to the main faire... our waiter brought a complementary molasses soda bread with a sweet guinness dip. My Sweetie says it was so delicious! We ordered a side as an appetizer of Onion Rings. They were thick slices of onion, which had a light and crispy batter. The onion rings were delicious as well. The food took awhile to arrive to our table but we didn't mind as the entertainment wasn\\"t going to start for another half hour.\\n\\nMy Sweetie ordered the Shepherd's Pie with a contemporary-style plating. Everything about the dish was excellent from the mashed potatoes to how the meat was seasoned. It was quite filling. My Sweetie struggled to finish his dish. I ordered the \\"It's a Porker\\" meal, which consists of a grilled lollipop pork chop with a root vegetable (carrot) mashed potato with a slice of pork crackling and a port and cider jus. Oh my! The pork chop was cooked to perfection. It was so tender! The root vegetable mash was delicious and was a nice accompaniment to the meal.\\n\\nTo complete the night, there was live entertainment -- Reel Republic. They're a 4-band member Irish Band coming from Ireland and they sang classic Irish songs to modern to 90's classics. We were impressed by them and were quite entertained. The wonderful entertainment, the delicious food, the relaxing ambiance in the patio and especially our very attentive waiter made for a perfect night out."},{"name":"Zend Conscious Lounge","address":"1130 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My favorite place to be when I visit Canada.

We were all excited to get here after our day trip to Austin. The property was beautiful and smelled like smoked meat heaven.  We had the family style meal which surprisingly was \\"all you can eat\\".  The BBQ was tender, juicy and smoked to perfection. Their sauce was not like any I've ever had. It was so good, I used bread to sop up the sauce on the plate! I even bought s bottle to take home to L.A. The sides were beans, coleslaw and potato salad. This is where I need to explain. The beans were good and had bits of brisket in it. They weren't as flavorful as I expected. I'm a coleslaw person so I was excited to try theirs. There's no mayo in their slaw. It was pretty food but tasted more like Chinese chicken salad. The potato salad didn't have mayo either. The recipe is in their cookbook (available for sale too) and has vinegar and seasoning but no celery, boiled egg or mustard as I was accustomed to. It was like chunky and zesty mashed potatoes. My husband liked it but he's also never met a potato he didn't like. Everything was served in family style dishes for sharing. After stuffing ourselves we decide on dessert. Pecan pie and peach cobbler. The pie had a good flaky crust. The filling was stiff and didn't have the right amount of sweetness. I didn't finish it. The cobbler had a cake consistency - no crust. It was more like a dump cake. A big disappointment. Overall we enjoyed the experience and the BBQ was the star of the show."},{"name":"Siros Restaurant","address":"307 Victory Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm a huge fan of Siros and have been for years.

Was greeted immediately by a friendly hostess who showed us where our table was reserved, since we were a bit early we decided to check out the restaurant.  While looking at some of the fantastic art, the GM, Scott introduced himself and began showing us around the restaurant as well as describing some of the art, etc.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and extremely professional. Once our friends arrived, we had a seat and the service began.  \\n\\nThe server was eager, friendly and extremely knowledgeable.  First we all ordered our drinks, which were delivered timely.  I was impressed with the pour of the red wine I ordered, so refreshing when comparing it to the measured carafe service in most restaurants nowadays. The wine is poured at the table and it was excellent!  Our table ordered many starters and snacks; flatbread, croquettes, oysters, cornbread and hush-puppies.  Nobody complained and all seem to enjoy the flavors.  On a side note, we felt the portions were on the small side for the price. \\n\\nMy wife and I both ordered the Black Grouper.  The presentation was good, with corn salsa on top and a grilled tomato on the side. Excellent!  We both LOVED the Grouper, it was fresh and cooked to perfection.  The only suggestion I would add is it would have been nice to have another side, perhaps a salad or rice/potatoes. While the flavors were there, we both agreed a little something else would have been perfect!  We weren't aware of any a la carte items that could be ordered so I'm not sure if there were any. \\n\\nWe all ordered dessert, no complaints.  So, in the end, it was an excellent experience, fantastic service and what a great atmosphere with lots of energy!  We did leave still feeling a bit hungry so for that I give 1921 4 stars, I would give 5 if the meals included a salad, bread and another side dish.

They just do it right. They have an army of people and they are all alert, professional, attractive and good. Just plain good. It's old school and astute. The vibe of the restaurant is a busy urban Italian place. Even the most popular trendy places in town, although very busy on Saturday nights, will not fill up until after 7p. At Strega W they seem to have a regular crowd that will come out earlier than 8p on a Saturday night, and stay for a while. This combined with the walk ins and normal volume for a city restaurant means that the place is buzzing from the get go, but if there is a seat or a table available, they will make it happen for you. On poin with the servicet. The decor and mood is modern and elegant. One would assume that the fare is traditional Italian food, a la Maggiano's, but when you open the menu the pleasant surprise is that there is adventure in there. At two pages its short and to the point, but the choices are plentiful. If you want chicken parm just ask, which it seems was purposeful.

Yet and still, they didn't bring out the wings and she said \\"I'll take your food off of the tab and you can order whatever you want\\". At that point I wasn't even hungry anymore -_- I refused about three times and just ended up getting salmon... Which also took an additional 35 mins on top of the hour that we were there.

We entered thru a beautiful Spanish looking courtyard and once thru the door, there is a hostess desk to the left and she then escorted us down to our table. It's a lovely space - The tables in the restaurant are well spread out, and the seating is very comfortable too. I loved the design of the lamps on the walls - they were works of art themselves.\\n\\nDespite ordering the set Israeli Supper menu, we got tempted by the a la Carte menu selections and got these two appetizers:\\n\\n1) Smoky Maduro Plantain Flatbread with Aged Cheddar & Pork Jowl Bacon  - It comes in 8 slices, but none of us felt that we got any bites of the pork at all, but we did all get the plantains. The sweet-savory taste didn't work for us and we wouldn't get this menu item again.\\n\\n2) Field Green Salad with Heirloom Apples, Marinated Feta, Toasted Hazelnuts, Fennel & Pomegranate Vinaigrette - an absolute winner for the table. The feta was mild, the vinaigrette flavours were so crisp and refreshing and the medley of greens was a superb selection. I can't believe there was no oil component to the dressing. Highly recommend and would get again.\\n\\nFor the Israeli dinner, dishes were served family-style and individual menu ratings are:\\n1) Lamb kofta: 4 stars. The flavouring + spices on their own didn't hold up for me, and I needed the lemon for the taste/ flavor profile to perk up my palate. The actual mince consistency however was superb! Very soft and perfectly cooked. My mum normally doesn't like lamb but she liked these koftas!\\n\\n2) Hummus:  5 stars. So smooth and creamy. We licked the dish clean.\\n\\n3) Tzatziki: 2 stars. Too watery, no robust flavor at all, could have done with a dash of dukkah spices!\\n\\n4) Cucumber salad: 5 stars. Loved the addition of the fresh baby tomatoes.\\n\\n5) Tabbouleh: 4 stars. It could have been brightened up with some pomegranate seeds.\\n\\n6) Falafel: 5 stars. Lovely taste and texture.\\n\\n7) Fresh Pita made in-house in the restaurant's wood-burning oven: 3 stars. My mother was served a partially burnt pita. It should have never even left the kitchen, let alone be served to a paying customer. I wish I'd take a picture, cause it was really bad!\\n\\n8) Dessert  - Semolina cake with Honey Syrup, Toasted Pistachio and Coconut sauce: 4 stars. I've had this dessert before at Jamie Oliver's restaurants in the UK but there the accompaniment was orange/ peach and rose water rather than coconut. I thought the coconut might have been a nod to the Orlando Tropics, but not sure if it was massively successful. My mum didn't like the coconut flavours at all, however we both agreed the actual cake itself was very light and fluffy.\\n\\nThe restaurant posts a teaser video to Instagram video which was a great motivator and visually showed you the food that was being served (https://www.instagram.com/1921nva/)\\n\\nThe food was fantastic, but what stops it from being 5-stars was the fact that burnt food was bought to the table and actually served!!!

The main dining room was a bit cluttered with wait staff squeezing past you every 5 seconds and giant prep tables hugging the wall for breads and water refills. \\n\\nThe food was another let down. We started off strong with the meatball and antipasto platter; both which were very good. However, then it seemed as if seasoning was an afterthought in the entrees. From the ribeye steaks to the chicken with lemon sauce, to the bolognese --- Strega's needed a dose of seasoning to make these dishes really pop. The quality of the meats, pastas, vegetables (albeit severely under-cooked), etc. were all very good, but the flavors were bland at best.\\n\\nThe wine list was vast and had a good selection of bottles to choose from. We opted not to have dessert.\\n\\nAll in all, Strega Waterfront is a cache name and cache location with overpriced and under-flavored food.

The menu is printed on all different kinds of colored paper and stapled, so that people can take them if they want to order from home and come pick up their food. There is also a digital menu on the wall behind the counter. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I joked with them a little and they joked right back, so you know they're the kind of people that aren't going to just take your order and dismiss you out of hand. I forgot to order my bacon extra crispy, and when I walked back up to the counter to let them know, all three employees stopped to see what I needed. Usually, at any restaurant, I have to say excuse me or something to get their attention... and I was not the only person in the restaurant, so they weren't just doing busy-work. So attentive!\\n\\nNow, the food. What if I said the food was terrible?  I'd be lying. \\n\\nI ordered three things: the Brunch burger (with fries), the New England clam chowder, and the wings. \\n\\nThe Brunch burger: I asked for the burger to be medium well and they did it just right, it was juicy, flavorful, and and deliciously greasy. The egg was supposed to be over easy, but it came over medium, so I took the egg off salted it and ate it on its own. I would've loved to have an over easy egg on that burger because I love the flavor of the runny yolk. I'll make sure that I let them know next time to make sure that the egg is over easy. The bacon was perfect. I asked for them to do it extra crispy and they did it just right. The melted cheese it was just the right amount for the size of burger; and I liked how they put all of the fixings into a container on the side. There was a pickle wedge inside the fixings container as well. The pickle wedge was delicious - like a Claussen spear. Unfortunately, they also had what I am familiar with as \\"bread-and-butter pickles\\" in the bottom of the container and the tomato slices directly on top of them. I don't like bread and butter pickles at all, so the flavor that leached into the tomatoes made the tomatoes no good to me. I couldn't tell you if those tomatoes were good or not because of the flavor from the bread-and-butter pickles. However, the red onion was fresh and crisp and the shredded lettuce was fresh as well. \\n\\nThe New England clam chowder: I ordered the clam chowder because the menu states that it is \\"made fresh daily\\". I was right to order it, because the flavor was very delicate and creamy without that sharp butter flavor. I really enjoyed it and I found that dipping my fries in it was awesome. It did come with the oyster crackers, but I've never enjoyed oyster crackers. I need something with more flavor in it - like fries! Speaking of the fries, the fries were very crispy, lightly battered, and delicious, but they didn't have a whole lot of \\"potato-meat\\" inside. The problem with this, is that the fries are only good while they're hot and fresh. Afterwards, they are just hard potato shells. Although, that makes them perfect for putting into soups/chowders! \\n\\nThe wings: I always order my wings extra crispy. Rarely, do I actually get them truly extra crispy since everyone adds the sauce on top and then closes the container, causing it to steam the wings afterwards or on my trip home. I made sure to open the box and try a wing before leaving the restaurant parking lot. They were fantastic. They were crispy on every edge, juicy and meaty on the inside, and the sauce wasn't goopy or slathered on like they just poured it over everything - they tossed the wings like they're supposed to do. I ordered my wings with \\"their hottest sauce\\", called the \\"O Sauce\\". It's got jalape√±o and habanero and Mexican peppers and all kinds of delicious hot and spicy capsaicins. It might be my new favorite sauce for wings! In fact, they might be my new favorite place for wings, period! \\n\\nOverall, my meal was fantastic. I know it sounds like a lot, but I did not eat all of it so I was truly able to experience all the different flavors and now I have lunch for today already figured out!"},{"name":"Dr. Jack's at the Rose Quarter","address":"1 N Center Ct","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"We were overcharged for the two glasses of wine -- $12 on our receipt, but $72 on our bank statement.

It was 20 degrees and snowing, but we all decided to brave the snow storm and wait outside for about 45 minutes. Suffice to say, it was absolutely worth it. \\n\\nThe food is absolutely delicious and the prices are great (including the wine). For the appetizer, we ordered the fried calamari ($8). The calamari was very tender and fresh, with fried peppers mixed in, which gave the dish an extra kick to it! My friend and I shared the Zuppa di Pesce house special for two with Giacomo sauce ($55) and it turned out to be one of the biggest plate of pasta I've ever seen. I was blown away by the size of the dish and how much seafood there was! It was a giant plate of linguine topped with  1/2 lobster, mussels, scallops, shrimp, scallops, and calamari. The Giacomo's sauce was fantastic and all the seafood was just cooked perfectly. I can't even begin to describe how magical the dish was - I am still having dreams about the seafood linguine and will always remember it. \\n\\nI tried the other entrees the rest of our group ordered, including the chicken marsala, lobster ravioli, Fusilli Siciliana.

The kale lyonnaise salad, although very tasty, unfortunately only had a few leaves of kale and mostly fris√©e in what was advertised as a kale salad (or as shown on the restaurant's IG post).

However, when we asked for extra bread to finish the last couple bites of terrine, we were not informed we would be charged $4.50 for a few small slices of brioche burger buns.

I have a thing for sushi rolls with jalapenos, so I totally loved this one! \\n\\nChar Grilled Shishito Peppers - grilled shishito peppers tossed with miso butter and bacon, topped bonito flakes. I am a big fan of grilled/roasted shishito peppers. They're not spicy at all and are very delightful to eat.

I wanna do 3, but that would rank it with lesser establishments and I don't want to do that. If the glorious reviews hadn't led me to expect so much, I wouldn't have walked away a tad disappointed so I probably would have been comfortable with 4. Let's say 3.5 Stars. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, the place is tiny, in an annoying not cozy way. If the place is packed, which I'm assuming it always is, there's a sign-up sheet outside (in a not so obvious spot, nor does it tell you that you are supposed to sign up yourself and not wait for a hostess, which goes against my inclinations), and you basically just wait. As a two - top we got lucky and it was \\"only\\" about 15 mins, but I saw more than one group give up and leave. Part of this was because some people decided it would be appropriate to have a 15 person dinner in a place that maybe seats 30. It's pretty rude to take up half the tables in a restaurant, IMO. There is outdoor seating with heat lamps and all, but we were there when it was raining and not so warm, not so appealing. Also, there is one bathroom for the entire establishment, men, women, employees and all. I will say that the decorations are lovely and perhaps if I had been to Pambiche on a sunny day when it wasn't so busy, I would have left with a better impression. If Pambiche is doing as well as I suspect they are, perhaps they should look into expanding. \\n\\nService was OK, not great, not bad. The food was good, but did not exceed my expectations and in fact my comparable meal at La Isla was definitely superior. Dinner for two with tip was about $45, same as Rogue Alehouse and Doug Fir, so I guess pretty average. I had Pollo Criollo -- marinated chicken breast, \\"dirty rice\\", and tostones. The chicken was OK, I've had better, not such a fan of the rice, mi novio's plain rice was better, and the tostones were good. My boyfriend had Pescado en Salsa Verde -- red snapper in salsa verde with white rice, avocado salad, and pan frito (little toasted bread things). He thought the fish was OK but it was his first time with red snapper so maybe he's just not a fan. The rice and bread were delicious, but just filler ya know, and the avocado salad was alot of avocado, coulda used a little somethin else. Overall, everything was satisfactory, but I was really hoping to be blown away. I might recommend this place as it is so popular, but I can't say I'd go back next time I'm in Portland."},{"name":"McGrath's Fish House","address":"12501 SE Second Cir","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Had the calamari, too greasy, my shrimp platter was ok, coconut shrimp was very good, but the other shrimps we're a fail.

Yes. This place has amazing pizza. Yes. This place does it pretty authentically. Yes. It is horrifically busy so don't be expected to be treated like Caesar. \\n\\nSurprisingly enough this place is really easy to pass by. It's a small restaurant with very limited seating but that doesn't deter many of the customers. The kitchen and dining are pretty much one large room where you can watch your pizza being made. It doesn't take longer than 5 or 10 minutes from the pizza to go from ticket to table. It's a pretty simple process.\\n\\nThe reason that I'm writing this review is because Antico does something that I honestly think more restaurants should invest in; good, high, quality, local, food without the flair. Antico, to me, is a good restaurant primarily because it cuts the fancy bullshit and gets down to the real part of going out to eat, the food. The dining \\"cafeteria\\" is lined with tables and benches so you're most likely to sit at a table with complete stranger. There are no plates, no service, you're ticket number is called out, your pizza comes before you in a giant silver serving platter and some wax paper and off you go. It serves some of the best quality food I've ever had (and from my long extensive foodie history, I've had a lot) but without the twisted ideology that to have this type of food it requires a black tie and monocle. \\n\\nIt's pricey, I'll give you that... but their crust doesn't need to be stuffed with cheese, or drowned in butter garlic dipping sauce, their crust is delicious. Their cheeses are creamy, stringy, expensive and used sparingly, the meats are cured to a heavenly oblivion and spiced to perfection, their produce and herbs are fresh and not lost in tons of tomato sauce. The pizza works in the simplest of manners and that is the best thing about this place. $20 will get you a full sized pizza of the best quality and that is a price, even as a college student, I'm willing to pay."},{"name":"Cibo e Beve","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 245","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I wasn't super impressed with this place.

They opted to sit us right in front of the stage, but it was so crazily loud that we declined and sat further back which was a wise decision. \\n\\nOur server was a bit pushy which I did not care for. You could tell he was really working the up-sell, pushing you to get more expensive items on the menu. I wasn't very hungry, so I ordered the mussels appetizer ($12) and my boyfriend got the Braised Beef dish ($26), and we always share our dishes anyhow. \\n\\nI asked if we could get the mussels dish first as an appetizer, so if I was hungry, I could order a side or a soup for when the Braised Beef dish came, but they messed up and the two dishes came at the same time.

This dish is definitely more than a one-person appetizer in my opinion.\\n\\nOverall, I think this place is overpriced and overrated (ie: not worthy of 4-stars on Yelp). On the Braised Beef dish, the portion was very small. The vegetables it was served with, carrots and turnips, were rock hard and did not taste very good.

If you are staying at one of the resorts, don't forget to plan on down time by the pool.  It is always hot and sunny (and humid) in Florida, so pool time is a must.\\n\\nThe main theme park has pretty much the same stuff as the one in California.  It is a bit dated; most of the rides are from movies that came out more than 10 years ago.  My favorite was ET, that was a cool ride and fun for all ages.  I also really like the MIB ride since they gave you \\"guns\\" to shoot the aliens with and I was surprised that it actually kept track of your score at the end.  I did NOT enjoy The Mummy ride at all. I am really afraid of roller coasters and I was not expecting it to be that scary.\\n\\nFor older adults (or anyone who needs to get out of the crowds and the sun for awhile) they also have some more low key things to do like the I Love Lucy exhibit.  I really enjoyed the Hollywood Horror Makeup show.  It wasn't as much real info as I expected but those two ladies were really funny and I was completely entertained for the entire hour (plus, it was nice to just sit in a/c for awhile). I also really liked the fact that you can get a beer at most of the restaurants... again an important factor when you need to take a break for a while."},{"name":"BurgerIM","address":"4745C Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4","text":"Been here 3 or 4 times and every time I was very pleased!! \\nI tried the veggie burger first which comes as two good sized sliders.

Over 20 mins AFTER we finished all food and the bus boy cleared our table the mussels was still not served and coffee was not refilled. Had to talk to the manager on duty (I believe was Patrick) to express our concern as children are bored with no food on the table and drinks are not refilled. By then the restaurant was already slowing down. We were given the reason that the server purposely delay our last entree in order to have enough table space. (We ordered 3 entrees for a table of 4).
