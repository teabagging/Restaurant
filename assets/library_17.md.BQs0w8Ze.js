We waited quite a while before the waiter came over and told us they were sold out. Then, the manager came over to apologize, saying they sold the last one earlier this week. The waiter then awkwardly hovered over us while we tried to decide what to get instead. We ended up just ordered two glasses of their wine \\"special\\" for the night. I'll accept blame for not asking the price, but it wasn't listed on the board. \\n\\nThe wine we got was mediocre at best (the bottle listed for $25 on Wine Searcher). Before I got the bill, I went to the restroom and on the way I noticed 4 bottles on the wall of the wine we came there for in the first place, which they were \\"sold out\\" of. The waiter asked me to show him and he seemed to have no idea what he was looking at. The floor manager then started referring to it as ros√©, which it definitely wasn't. My point being, if you are running a wine bar, your staff needs to have some clue about what wines are on the list. \\n\\nThen our bill showed up - $70 (with tip) for 2 GLASSES of wine!!!! Same price as the bottle I had wanted to order. As someone who visits a lot of wine bars in NYC and is fairly knowledgeable about wine, I can tell you this wine should be priced at half that. Also, it's really not OK to not list the price of your wine \\"special\\" for the night when it's $30 a glass - nobody would assume a wine special was that much.

We live in the Boulder area so we have heard good things about this place.  Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its billing.  It is not the best restaurant in Boulder or the Front Range (sorry 5280 magazine, you dropped the ball on this one). If you want better, walk directly across the street to Frasca (they are the best in Boulder and possibly the Front Range).\\n\\nThe food at L'Atelier is fine.  It was reasonably tasty and well prepared. The Peek Toe Crab & Avocado appetizer was underwhelming.  I had the Bouillabaisse, which was nice, but way too many mussels. My wife had the Ribeye. You won't be disappointed with portion sizes (they were larger than I expected).\\n\\nMy primary complaint is that the wait staff might just as well have been brought over from Denny's.  The person who served us was the lamest excuse for a server in a high-end restaurant I have ever met. He knew almost nothing about the details of the menu and gave us inaccurate info (e.g., the crab & avocado appetizer).   He also had no opinion on the food. He basically was an order taker and showed up a couple of times to remove items.  He failed to follow our request to split the appetizer on separate plates, a busboy needed to bring us separate plates.\\n\\nIf you get a better server, your experience should be better than ours. However, keep in mind the restaurant is small and the acoustics are poor. So you can hear everything people around you are saying. If you are there for business or an intimate dinner, speak very softly and hope the table next to you isn't too loud.\\n\\nBottom line, the food was fine, but not nearly as good as Frasca or Q's. Our total bill without tip was $131 for two people, including a $40 bottle of Proseco.\\n\\nWe will not be returning because it felt like a three-star experience when we were expecting and paying for a five-star experience.  Only upside, you can probably get a table on short notice, whereas at Frasca you won't.

Based on those experiences I'd say that, Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles is essentially a soul food joint where you wind up paying thirty bucks plus when all is said and done.\\n\\nThe food's decent, but not spectacular, and sometimes it's downright plain. When I order a chicken-and-rice plate, I get a very standard chicken breast smothered with gravy over a bed of white rice that could have come out of a box of Uncle Ben's . It's not prepared using any expensive seasonings or ingredients. It's not a big cut above something I'd heap on my plate at a Golden Corral.\\n\\nThe tastiest thing I've ordered was the barbecued turkey wings. Turkey wings are woefully underappreciated, and should as a common a staple at the family dinner table as a pork chop. Gladys Knight bastes them with a barbecue sauce, which is something I've never experienced before. It works. Again, though, two wing joints for seventeen dollars is just a bad value. \\n\\nI don't think I'll go there anymore, because as much as I love good soul food, it just doesn't feel like a deluxe experience worth paying a premium for.

The area is a beautiful part of Boston and the restaurant itself is a cute older building with nice seating, and the food portions are huge. That was the extent of the positive things about the dining at this restaurant.\\n\\nI was disappointed that the waitress was unable to assist me with my dairy allergy. She incorrectly informed me that I couldn't have their homemade pastas, stating that they had egg and therefore were bad for me (egg is not dairy, not sure why people get confused about that). They were unable to tell me with certainty that the marinara and other items did not have dairy. I found this ironic considering that they have a note on the menu asking you to inform them of any allergies so they can assist you.\\n\\nWhen the food came the plate was HUGE. There was a ton of food. I got their basic marinara with penne pasta and two sausage links. Unfortunately, I was not at all impressed by the taste. The marinara sauce was bland with no seasoning, just crushed tomatoes. The sausage was rubbery and also bland with no spices. The pasta itself was good, like most pasta is.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself, while quaint and well decorated, was so loud that it was impossible to hear the other people at my own table.\\n\\nOverall I was disappointed in my experience after the hype for La Famiglia Giorgio's.

No doubt about it. I decided to take my family to Hy's to celebrate mother's day on Monday to avoid the crowd on Sunday.\\n\\nWe were greeted once we entered and our hostess brought us upstairs. Each of us were given a menu along with the wine list. They asked if I needed to see the cocktail menu and brought at my request. \\n\\nWater was poured into our glass to start us off and our server suggested we start off with their famous cheesy bread. I declined as I remembered dining at Gotham that the unnecessary carbs prohibit me from finish my steak (which should be the star of the night). \\n\\nAfter being told what the dishes of the day was and studying the menu, we decided to order:\\n\\n-Steak Tartare (4/5-$20.95): This was done table side. We were also asked whether we like some spice with it. We, obviously, said yes. I normally have my steak tartare with some Tabasco mixed in. It was served with some toast and a hardboiled egg and anchovy on top. It was amazing watching how James plated it with such finesse. The tartare was good. I personally found it a bit too spicy (haha) and would have preferred it with a raw egg yolk.\\n\\n-Porterhouse (5/5-$73.95): We got this cut in medium rare with a side of rice pilaf. Presentation-wise, this was not the best but the porterhouse was cooked to perfection. Love this cut. Since it was 22 oz, we got this to share.\\n\\n-Bone-in Ribeye (5/5-$58.95): Beautifully marbled cut. Our server suggest we get this one medium instead of medium rare due to the fat content of this steak. We went with her suggestion and it was amazing. The fattiness of this steak made it so much more succulent and juicy. Got the baked potato with this dish. Toppings were brought out to us to choose and Kim noticed midway that we need a refill on the toppings and brought us some more. How nice!\\n\\n-Filet Mignon (5/5-$49.95): Initially I wanted to get the steak diane for the tableside service but was afraid it would too small of a cut so our server suggested that I go with the 8oz filet mignon and have the brandy sauce as an addition (+$5.95) which comes up to the same price and a bigger piece of steak. Another difference is that the filet mignon is grilled instead of pan fried. Also got this piece for medium rare and I personally think this one was done the best. The brandy sauce was super delicious. It was enjoyable to watch Kim explain each step as she make the sauce in front of us. If you do get the same as I did, ask for your steak to be pan fried. I felt the grilled taste overpowered the brandy sauce. The sauce tasted a lot better with the other steaks we ordered.\\n\\n-Banana Foster (5/5-$14.95): Also done tableside. We were skeptical about getting this dessert since it's flambeed. With my past experience at several restaurants, any flambeed dessert left a strong alcohol taste to the dessert which ruins it overall. So before ordering, I asked Kim and she assured me that since it's done tableside all the alcohol taste would evaporate once it's flambeed and she was right! A very enjoyable and entertaining dessert. Those who love bananas should definitely get this!\\n\\n-Cherry Jubilee (5/5-$14.95): Not on the menu. Very similar to the Banana Foster but it's done with cherries and grand mariner instead of rum. Despite the presentation looking less compared to its counterpart, this one tasted better (in my opinion). I could be bias, since I love Cherries but those who favoured the banana foster later on said that the cherry jubilee was indeed better.\\n\\nOverall, fantastic service! There was not a time where I felt pressured to order something. Kim & James weren't pushy about us getting the cheesy bread nor cocktails. They gave us all the time we needed to decide on which steak and what size we wanted. Kim was helpful with her suggestions. The servers here know their stuff. There wasn't a question they could not answer. Food was also really good. It did not disappoint.

Mine was great as I don't mind beef on the rare side, but my partner wasn't as satisfied. Also it was a bit uncomfortable sitting outside amongst the heat and the flies, even though it was covered and enclosed.  I was also disappointed by the fact that there seemed to be a tv outside in the dining area, however it was locked up in a closed box and they weren't showing the big UT game. \\nThe overall experience was pretty average, nothing earth shattering by any means. This restaurant gets points for originality, friendliness and a cool name, but the execution needs some work before I'll give it another go."},{"name":"Mimian Asian Grill","address":"7541 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"5","text":"Stumbled upon Mimian last night with my daughter and so glad we did.

Cesar Chavez I found this location behind a Mexican restaurant.  While Mom's is colored in bright blue in red, the Mexican restaurant was in bright yellow.\\n\\nSince I was arriving around 2pm and not the rush hour I was able to find parking in their lot which is very small. This fits right in line with Mom's because it is small as well. I walked in and quickly saw I needed to order at the window, the young man who took my order was nice and helped me decide on what I wanted.  I ordered the Normal Jean with white bread (they do have wheat as well) which comes with American cheese and lettuce and tomato, onion and I added mayo and a fried egg. They were out of tomato but that was OK.\\n\\nAs I waited for my order I sat at a small table on the patio, actually there were only 5 tables and only one was available and it was full of previous users left over items, I cleared myself a space and waited.  I think we were supposed to police ourselves and take our baskets to the trash can and shelf area; well that is what I did when I finished.\\n\\nMy order came and the burger looked great, the fries were darker brown and wiggly not crispy.  But I loved the fries (and you know I hate almost everyone's fries), so I like wiggly fries. Now the burger, it was great, one of the better burgers I have had in a long time. It was cooked correctly and I loved it. As stated in other reviews the wait for the burger seems a little long but it was worth it. Oh yes, since it was my first time my  1/2 order of fries were free.  Yip pea ka yah cowboy!\\n\\nWhat did I notice while I was there?  Their order window was continually full and all the tables and 6 or 7 bar seats inside were full as well.  There were many very pretty ladies there with their boyfriends or girlfriends; since they were so pretty I guess they were yelpers coming to give Mom's a try as well.\\n\\nOh, don't forget they have liter bottles of Mexican coke.\\n\\nWould I go back?

We've recently become huge fans of Thai food and we're constantly scoping out new places, so I'm super thankful I came across this little gem here on Yelp. \\n\\nWe arrived on a Friday at about 2:00pm and there were 3 other tables full, so we quickly got a seat and put in our orders. The waitress was very quick and friendly, and though I was expecting a long wait for our meals we ended up being served within 15 minutes so not too shabby. I started with the Thai Iced Coffee (beautiful and delicious! Surprisingly not too sweet - the PERFECT iced coffee) and my husband had the Thai Iced Tea (again, a gorgeous piece of art that was absolutely delicious). \\n\\nMy husband ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, which turned out to be one of our favorite Pad Thai's that we've tried yet (and we've tried LOTS by now). It was simple yet full of flavor, and chock full of protein and bean sprouts which is always a plus. He has a super sensitive tongue so ordered a 1 out of 5 on the spicy scale and it was perfect for him.\\n \\nI ordered the Pad Kee Mao but substituted the typical wide rice noodles with regular rice noodles (the ones used for the Pad Thai). BEST MEAL EVER! It was absolutely full of fresh local produce like yellow squash, green beans and zucchini all stir-fried to perfection. Lots of delicious chicken and the rice noodles were absolutely amazing with the spicy Thai Basil sauce. I went with a 3 out of 5 heat level and it was certainly hot but ohhhhh so good! \\n\\nWe both thought the portions were perfect for a nice hearty lunch, and the prices were more than reasonable when you factor in the freshness and authenticity of these dishes. One of the most perfect meals we've had in a long time so we definitely left Thai Grille with no regrets, full bellies and smiles on our faces!

Perhaps this is because an older gentleman (The owner?) was there along with the younger staff members, but either way, I would definitely say that it was a very family friendly atmosphere. I would definitely consider sticking around to eat my meal in the restauant. I can only rate 1 item: The Hawaiian Pizza. I thought that it was an excellent pie, one of Salem's best. The crust was substantial, but not overly doughy. It was complemented by a subtle, tasty sauce and a nice balance of cheese and toppings. The price was also very reasonable: under $12 for a large Hawaiian.  I will definitely visit Damatas again. Looking forward the Salem Pizza Competition on August 7th at the Willows.

This was about the only thing you earned from me that night. \\n\\nI was optimistic since their NYC location does a great job handling larger groups,and has great food and service, but I was VERY wrong to assume the same for this location. \\n\\nI had called twice ahead of time to make sure they were ready for us and to make sure they had the right # of people for us. When I arrived 10 minutes before our reservation, the table set up had not even been started! When I shared that we had a specific time schedule the hostess didnt seemed phased at all.  The hostess staff did not do a good job keeping me in the loop as to when they were ready, I had to keep asking, because it was taking a long time. I had even walked to where they said we were going to sit us 10 mins later at 6pm, which was our reservation time, and nothing had been done yet.  They took a VERY long time to set it up and didnt seat us until 20 mins after our reservation. Yes, it took 30 mins to set up our table for 16. The restaurant was not busy and it was a Wednesday and no one else was waiting. Which by the way, they still did wrong and set it up for 15. They also crowded us into 4 tables, even though there were loads of empty tables they could have added on (I hate when places shove 2 seats at the head of the table. This is not NYC for goodness sake).\\n\\nThere was no sense of accountability and no apologies and no attempt to move quickly to set things up. We only had 1 hr and 15 mins for dinner, which would have worked for our group, but sitting down 20 mins late created a time crunch. \\n\\nOur waiter was slow and hard to find which made the new time crunch even worse. I had asked another wait staff member to put in an order of 2 mild guacs so we could get something on the table, because I couldnt find our waiter since he didnt come over to us when we sat down. He was the only one who seemed to help that evening. \\n\\nOur guac finally arrive and it was so SPICEY! Like mouth on fire spicy. It was also extremely chunky as is the person making it got tired and just served 3-4 inch chunks of avocado. When our food finally arrived everyone was shares how spicy their food was, even if it wasnt supposed to be. Many people couldnt eat their food due to the over seasoning with spice. Seems all of their food has the same note, spicy. \\n\\nAlso, it was very loud in the space, even though the restaurant was half full, which made our networking dinner a challenge. So something to note if you want to come here with a group and expect to have conversation, this is not the place for this. To sum up our dinner experience, once we were able to track down our waiter to get our checks, he brought them to us and we learned that things were not split up correctly. Should have seen that coming. \\n\\nThe whole experience was a frustrating disappointment.  With so many other good choices in the area, I would never return nor recommend."},{"name":"Tacos La Villa","address":"2415 Cobb Pkwy SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious tacos, reasonable prices, and fast service...you can't beat it! \\n\\nI ordered the taco plate which came with 3 small tacos made with corn tortillas, rice, beans, and a soda for $6.66 with tax!

I got a chicken, steak, and a lamb taco and thought the chicken was the best. \\n\\nThey have a nice selection of Mexican sodas and beers and they have Tres Leches cake!

The food was great, the atmosphere was authentically Austin, and our waiter was prompt.\\n\\nLet's start with parking - it's tight. We ended up parking way at the back of the lot. They have one spot which sort of blocks in other cars. It looks like they're trying to make the most out of their parking spaces, but be forewarned that people seem to kind of park haphazardly everywhere when room runs out, along with spaces in odd places.\\n\\nUpon walking in, there's a huge curtain that you pass through to get to the hostess station which is interesting. We were shown to our table immediately. It was a high table with bar height chairs on one side and booth seating on the other. Usually I don't find that very comfortable considering I am very short, but they had a bar that I could comfortably rest my feet on which I very much appreciated. The restaurant is bigger than it appears to be, from the main room. It wraps around to another part that is like a bar in the back which is neat. They had a lot of lights strung up and accent peices. \\n\\nShortly after we got settled, our waiter was along. He took our drink orders and appetizer order, and was off again. I ordered the Charlotte's Web which had strawberry moonshine along with balsamic and it was incredibly delightful. A nice mix of sweet and a light tinge of sour. Our party also ordered the Truffle Deviled Eggs, the Brussells Sprout Caesar Salad, and Bacon Wrapped Dates. Everything was wonderful. For the deviled eggs, I can't say that I really tasted the truffle, but they were still very creamy and had ample chopped bacon on top. The Caesar was very fresh and had a lot of other mixed greens in it, with a lovely light dressing that made it bright. The dates were also very well done, a great mix of sweet and salty. \\n\\nFor our entrees, most of us went in different directions. One person ordered the Chicken Thighs, two had the Duck Breast, and I ordered the Genuine Blackened Redfish. I can't say that I can speak to everyone thoughts on their  dishes, however, everyone finished. I'm guessing that everything was great. Everything was plated very artfully, it was nice to see. My redfish was very well done, although a bit spicy for my tastes. The fish was tender and flaky with decent seasoning. I very much enjoyed the quinoa-lentil bed that it sat upon. The slight creaminess is what I was drawn to after the heat of the seasoning on the fish. \\n\\nAfter, of course, we ordered desserts. Two had the Banana Fosters Biegnets and said they were excellent. One person got the Mexican Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and loved it. I got the Blood Orange Sorbet and thought it was lovely. It had an intense orange flavor to it without the harshness of the citrus and a was a lovely light dessert. \\n\\nThe only other thing that I'd like to mention here was the noise level. I'm not sure if there were just a lot of louder parties in there that evening, or if it is always like this but it was incredibly difficult to carry a conversation at our table. By the end of the evening my vocal cords and my ears both felt incredibly strained from trying to scream across the table and struggling to hear all night long. \\n\\nAnyways, I'm giving four stars here for the service and the food. I think there's room for improvement, (parking, noise absorption, too much spice) but otherwise The Salty Sow was pretty Solid!"},{"name":"The Peached Tortilla","address":"","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Somewhere between my love of tacos and various Asian cuisines, I find that it would be so awesome if I could just combine all of them together into one masterful creation.

The coffee menu is straight forward, and their beer selection is from St. Elmo brewery only.

So without reading other reviews, which would taint any opinion, I have to give the Harp and Celt a great rating.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nSo hard to find sausage that compares to what you can get in the UK.  This is exactly it.  I used to eat it every weekend for breakfast when I lived in England, but could not reproduce it here.\\n\\nThis is the same sausage you will find in the Irish breakfast, sausage rolls and bangers and mash.\\n\\nAnyway they have much to choose from in their beer and menu items.\\n\\nSo enjoy it for what it is.  I have not yet tried the restaurant next door, but the bar menu is great and satisfying.  Not to mention a great hang out spot for watching soccer.

I agree with the 4.5 star rating that Yelp has averaged out but that choice isn't available to me and in the end I went with the 5 side.  My complaint is hard to pin down.  It comes down to a lack of harmony.\\n\\nThe service was exceptional, well informed, attentive and just the right amount of friendly.  The ingredients were fresh, very well prepared and beautifully presented.  I can't agree with those who have complained about serving sizes.  Our antipasti were 1/4 cup of dense, smoothly chopped chicken liver with 6 pieces of a focaccia and 6 crisps of olive bread for $22 and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of 2\\" (50 mm) and 1\\" (25 mm) shrimp dressed with a tomato lemon vinaigrette and molded with fris√©e for $17.  \\n\\nOur primo had 1.5 cups (350 ml) of well cooked pasta and a handful of wild mushrooms for $25 and smaller portions of each pasta are offered at reduced prices.  They divided that into two bowls for us, without asking, as we wanted to enjoy a secondi, their contorni and dessert.  It is hard to serve me too much garlic but this pushed my limits and slightly overshadowed the more subtle fungi.  The scarpetta was enjoyable. \\n\\nOur secondo was 6-7 oz. ( 200 gm.) of an atlantic halibut special, pan seared to flaking with a citrus sugo, dressed with 7 small similarly cooked shrimp and 1.5 cup (350 ml) of a warm mediterranean salad of roasted root vegetables, chopped bell pepper and mixed greens for $38.  Contorni were 1 cup (240 ml) of rapini with more moderate garlic and asparagus dressed with a parmesan fonduta, both grilled to tender externally and crunchy internally for $17 each.  \\n\\n5-6 each of red and white wines were available by the glass with 3-4 times that number by the bottle.  We chose a chardonay and a nero d'avola that were pleasant but not memorable.  Sampler flights of 3 x 1 oz. (30 ml) of house selected pours from the by the glass list are available for both whites and reds.  \\n\\nDessert options were varied including 2 flavors each of house made sobetto and gelato, as well as bread pudding and a chocolate torte.  We chose a Meyer lemon tart, 2\\" x 4\\" x 1/2\\" (50mm x 100mm x 12 mm) of tart, pleasantly bitter, custard with a thin upper and slightly thicker lower crust plated with a dollop of creme fraise and a swirl of raspberry sauce with mixed fresh blue and raspberries.\\n\\nAs others have stated frequently, the ambience is semi-formal meets homey but too crowded for my taste with 5 tables (4x2 and 1x4) in a 12'x15' (3m x 4m) room with no noise abatement.  We were seated next to a noisy table of 4.  That can't be avoided but stopped me from relaxing into the meal."},{"name":"Small Pharoah's","address":"340 SW 5th St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ordered lamb over rice with NYC's Halal Guys in mind, so my expectation was really high.

Oh, all seven sauces (totally forgot the cheese sauce until after!) The order was called back and I waited a few minutes before another employee brought my order and repeated the order. \\n\\nThe sandwiches without pickles were clearly marked and the fries were hot. The sandwich was perfect, never seen such a perfect bun and warm chicken! It was fun trying all the sauces- some were too watery and salty but I kept going back to the garlic & herb ranch (I normally do not like ranch), which was a nice balance. The half tea, half lemonade was great too, really nice and refreshing. \\n\\nWith a casual atmosphere and food kept simple plus done right as well as friendly employees, I see the obsession! The soft instrumental praise music was subtle and the motion detected trash disposal were all perks, but a little steep I thought. For a meal it was a little over 7.50 and one CFA sandwich came out to be over 4. Maybe I haven't had fast food in a while but thought it was a tad more than what I used to pay.

As for customers there were probably 10 tables of people which wasn't many considering the size of the dining room. We were promptly seated by the hostess and given menus. That's where our employee interaction ended. We sat at our table for around 10 minutes while the waitstaff helped surrounding tables and completely ignored us. We left our invisibility cloaks at home that day, so I'm pretty sure SOMEONE had to see us sitting there... but if they did they didn't care to take even our drink order.

However, I do appreciate that they source their meats from good farms, and I'm willing to pay for that. \\n\\nI had the mole Coloradito with pork. The mole sauce was good, but the plate came with nothing but a pork chop and rice with the mole sauce. A lame dish for $30. But more importantly, the pork chop was over-cooked and dry.

Last month when I stopped at the bar, which has a nice assortment of beers, I was informed that they have closed the restaurant and are enlarging the bar.  Great idea, since the food was so disappointing and is more suited for bar food than that of a restaurant.  So this is how our experiences went....\\n\\nThe first sign that this was to be a so-so meal, was when we walked in the restaurant and the host was dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt.  Looked more like we were entering a country saloon rather than an Irish-style restaurant.  Seriously, if you're going to have a host, please dress the part accordingly.  But then that's just my opinion and you know what they say about opinions...  LOL!!\\n\\nThe deal is this.  My friend ordered the Fish & Chips, which is described on the menu as 'Fresh Pollock hand battered.\\"  This was neither fresh nor hand battered!  It was a single frozen encrusted plank of fish.  Looked like it and tasted like it.  When I mentioned this to the bartender on our 2nd trip there, I was informed that it's always been a frozen piece of fish.  Well that explains it, except for the false advertising on the menu.  \\n\\nAnd that also applies to what I had - imagine that!  I had the Irish nachos, which was described as having \\"Homemade Celt pub chips.\\"  Actually, the chips were made in a plant as it appears they were the Cape Cod or Kettle type chips that come out of a bag.  Besides that, it had very little meat or cheese on the top.

'What have we here?' was written all over my face and they took pity on my curiosity.\\n\\nSat at the bar where mixologist extraordinaire Elizabeth served up a marvelous Moscow Mule made with fresh ginger which gave it a real kick.  Mule...kick...he he he. :-)\\n\\n(sorry)\\n\\nDecided to sample a number of the small plates of their bar menu as well as a few plates off the main menu, since I was lucky enough to be there with an actual food writer who needed to scout the place and required my extra stomach space to cover all the bases.  And, yes, they got covered,  including a Duo of Beef which was an out of this world combo of tea smoked boneless rib eye slices as well as a Korean inspired rib eye tartar with fried quail egg with a hint of sesame, both garnished with a brushstroke of pink peppercorn powder, as attractive as it was yummy!  This was fantastic.\\n\\nFries and sauces seems to be the current rage in the city, thank your finger licking Belgians for that one, but when it gets me a trio of crisp fries, each with a corresponding dipping accessory, I go into an artery hardened feeding frenzy.  The pink peppercorn dusted fries were dating the lemon aioli, the Parm. truffle fries were holding hands with a saucy tarragon ranch number, and the rosemary spuds were hooked up with John Kerry's wife, a match made in Louisburg Square.  It felt like prom night!\\n\\nBreath in, eat out...\\n\\nThe Carbonara flatbread pizza was a unique take on the classic pasta dish turned finger food.  Pancetta and carbonara sauce over crunchy thin crust topped with 2 runny fried eggs was just what I had hoped for.  Talk about pizza for breakfast possibilities.  This is one you can really enjoy the next day!\\n\\nThe Oyster Po Boy sliders were a great concept and truly engineered like their larger southern brethren, on perfectly warmed and dressed slices of baguette, (no brioche please) but the fried oysters themselves were a bit off I thought, not fresh and briny, just slightly fishy and too greasy.   They could rework those a bit, maybe even make them open face and lighten the battering.\\n\\nAnother breather, another glass of pinot grigio, another notch loosend on my belt.\\n\\nOut next came a perfect lobster ravioli with saffron cream sauce and a huge chunk of tail meat, very delicate and not over seasoned so the lobster flavors really popped out.

FYI, almost all 'truffle oil'  sold is nothing more than olive oil infused with 2,4-dithiapentane, a chemical that is pretty close to the aroma of truffles, yes, even the expensive stuff,  so when I saw those slabs of real black truffle, well, I was in a word, smitten!\\n\\nThough the desert menu is still being worked on, the executive chef, Michael Lishchynsky, (Johnson & Wales) brought out a few things he had been experimenting with, including a bananas foster Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e , which was to be torched at table-side in the future iteration, as well divine chocolate mousse with an impressive name that I can no longer remember due to bartender Elizabeths' constant attention.

The manager is lovely and a couple of girls are very nice. Some of the others are just rude and grumpy. That's why every time I place an order it's pretty straight forward no \\"hi how are you\\" because they're grumpy. There are times where they rang me up one additional coffee but I let it go. There are also times when the coffee doesn't taste good but I don't even ask for them to remake, I let it go. When you want to be nice you can't even be nice because they're rude. I always have a list of coffee and I know it's a lot to take in at once so I always take my time with reading the orders to the girls. Anyways, had a run in with Jean from this location today. As I was reading her my first order, which was a medium ice, I saw her grabbing a medium hot cup instead so as I was trying to tell her that \\"it's actually a medium ice,\\" she cut me off and said \\"WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, slow down with the orders.\\" Now I'm upset. She definitely didn't want to hear me out and just assumed that I'm giving her my next order. AND the way she said \\"wait,\\" was more of a yelling/aggravated tone. I understand if I was being rude to her than whatever she can yell at me if she want. Lol. In this case I simply just wanted to say \\"it's actually a medium ice...\\" once I saw her grabbing a medium hot cup. She got the rest of my orders and started making the drinks. The other girl (didn't get her name) walked up to the register and rang me up. I asked her what was Jean's name because I didn't knew it then. She paused and said \\"why don't you asked her yourself? Is there a problem?\\" Again, another rude one. So I ignored her rude questions and said that's fine I'll check her name tag. Now I'm furious. Another one? Whatever. Jean came back and gave me the coffee and I told her to not ever talk to me like that again because that was rude. She have the audacity to say that I'm the rude one, and again I'm tryna tell her that all I wanted to say to her was it's a medium ice not a medium hot. She walked off and say she doesn't have to listen to me blah blah blah and the other girl said \\"we're being nice, we don't have to serve you.\\" Wait a minute! What?! The other girl don't even know what's the issue or what's going on and she have the audacity to say that and jumped into this escalated argument? What she should have done was to try and not make this argument escalate even more. But of course they don't have good customer service skills so they wouldn't know. Not gonna lie, they won lol. It's true, they don't have to serve me, that's if I'm rude. But I wasn't being rude until Jean was rude. This would have never happened if Jean hear me out from the start. I'm glad that this happened today, this proves that it's not me, it's them. This dunks will get a two star just because I do love the manager.

Once again NOT the case over at Franks Suffolk Diner.  \\nThis brings me to cleanliness TOP notch, this place looks brand new even though I know for a fact its been there many years. The deacor is traditional, but believe me this place sparkles ! NOT you typical \\"greasy spoon \\".  From the top of the ceiling to the floors clean clean clean.  The prices are fair for the oversized plates. \\n\\nIf there is any one thing on the negative side....its finding it. If someone isnt from the area I could see them easily driving by without finding it. In my opinion it would be worth them putting some larger signs directing patrons in.  American Legion Highways speed limit is pretty fast, somethings got to catch the eye, make you slow down, and give you confidence that youll be pulling into the right place. \\nI love this place, so glad we went ! \\n\\nI hope the owner here has sent menues (with directions ) to all these local hotels. As well as an ad in the local phone book.

Even though most days should be about mom!\\n\\nMy sister had this restaurant already picked out and after skimming through the reviews I knew in the back of mind what type of experience we would have. I'm not entirely sure what the identity of the restaurant is, but it has a sports bar-ish vibe with an option to dine outside. \\n\\nThe brunch menu was fairly simple, containing the classic servings. We all opted for the regular menu. We ordered plenty of rounds of Cha-Cha Chips, which were a solid warm up to the meal. They come with interesting sauces for dipping. Not too shabby!\\n\\nI opted for the Uptown French Dip, which came with Parmesan Truffle Fries. In theory, it sounds like a first round knock out. It was extremely average in flavor and texture. The au jus was great, but it wasn't enough to uplift the sandwich. The fries were not my cup of tea either. Parm and truffle are two of my favorite ingredients, however using them too liberally can result in a disappointing clashing of two powerful flavors.\\n\\nWith my meal I ordered a side salad, and this was probably my favorite offering of the meal. The dressing tasted fresh and paired nicely with the greens. I will say the majority of my family (including mom) enjoyed their meals, minus dad's duck sandwich, and the shredded cheese in mom's salad when she said no cheese. \\n\\nOur server was...well...over it. Off the bat, I think she was annoyed that we didn't order drinks besides waters.

Our salads arrived and we started to eat pieces of lettuce like chips because our server was no where to be found and we were still awaiting the arrival of our silverware. Our silverware later arrives with our meals. During this time the table across from us is still not bussed. We each ordered the ultimate feast. I think my crab legs were in a fight with my mother's crab legs because they were both missing legs. My crab legs only had 3 appendages.

I don't blame the servers in this restaurant. I blame the managers. They are definitely not doing their job and it explains the low amount of patrons on the inside.

I'll go with three, because the atmosphere was definitely different, and the service (after a rough start) was pretty good. But my husband and I felt that this is a restaurant that's over-reached its grasp in some key respects.\\n\\nOf the good: We tried one of their signature drinks (the Mule) and it was very tasty and refreshing. The quality of the food product used in the restaurant is quite high (fresh mussels, very fresh, tasty greens, quality veggies used in dishes like the homemade pickles, good beef in the burgers, etc.) The atmosphere is fun and attractive.\\n\\nHowever, of the bad: the restaurant is extremely loud. Like, so loud we could not hear each other or the server. The chairs are very uncomfortable. We sent one drink back (a margarita) as it was undrinkable, and a second (a bloody mary) should probably have gone back with it. \\n\\nOf the dishes we ordered, the mussels were tasty (though not all of them had opened and those should not have been served), the hamburgers were decent, and the homemade pickles were a nice treat. The desserts were excellent, especially the blueberry shortcake (yum!) and the coffee (also yum!)\\n\\nOn the downside, the french fries were pretty tasteless. The pigs in a blanket were okay, and the white bean dip likewise. Not the best texture. And for me, the heartbreaker was the \\"fall salad\\" (which came out at least ten minutes after everyone else had their food). The greens in this salad should have been amazingly delicious. They were superb, really. But the salad was ruined by the fact that it had no balance of flavors whatsoever. It was essentially a big bowl of greens with some sour pickles, capers, and caper berries in it, doused in a very sour dressing. Almost inedible -- and a shame to ruin such beautiful vegetables. On top of that, it was served with a poached egg in it that was ICE COLD. I've had many yummy salads with poached egg in them, but ice cold? GROSS. It has the texture of a... well, let's just say it was not pleasant.\\n\\nWe might give them another try, but at best, I'd say this place was uneven, and the loudness factor made it a relief to leave."},{"name":"Ras Kassa's Ethiopian Restaurant","address":"555 30th St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"As someone who has tried around 10 Ethiopian restaurants in my life, Ras Kassa's gets #1 on my list.

A budding sandwich maverick, I veered off the Wonder bread course by choosing quality over the norm again and again. I continued on my rebellious path through high school, when I began buying my own groceries (with wages earned at a shoe store) when my mom refused to purchase special ingredients for my sandwich creations. That's okay, because I received all the validation I'll ever need when my dad proclaimed one of my subs the best he's ever had.\\n\\nBut these days, I'm spending less time making sandwiches and more money buying them. But when you buy a sandwich from local sub shop Tucci's, you're making an investment in not one but two glorious meals.\\n\\nIt all starts with the bread, and Tucci's is near flawless - slightly crusty with a chewy bite to it. Then they take my favorite (the Southside Authentic Italian Gourmet) and carefully stuff the bread with the neatest arrangement of spread, meats, cheese and veggies that I've ever experienced. I've noticed that they painstakingly layer this particular sandwich just so or otherwise, the fillings and the four meats (yes, four) would spill onto your plate. The ensuing result is a genius example of even distribution - perfect portions of every ingredient in every single bite. While the regular-size doesn't look that big, it's so dense that I recommend halving it from the start and saving the rest for later. Even my dad did this and his hunger was sated 'til dinner 6 hours later... seriously, the Italian Gourmet is the stallion of sandwiches.\\n\\nAnd wouldn't you know it - my father proclaimed his sandwich as the best he's ever had!

The line at the 23rd location was VERY long, so we skipped it, knowing our friend who lives in Northeast would take us to the Alberta st spot.  The line there was still long.

I had then decided to get the Gooey Chocolate Brownie and the Coffee & Bourbon, but I went for one more taste to make sure and tasted the C&B.  I'm glad I did, because I didn't love it, and surprised myself that I DID love the Strawberry Balsamic, so I got a scoop of the chocolate in the bottom of a waffle cone, and the strawberry on top, and holy crap was it incredible.

During this time the owner came up multiple times and introduced himself to everyone except my mixed race family, and another Indian family. When we were finally seated we walked past no less than 6 empty tables (2 parties had left the restaurant while we were waiting) and taken to a small back room with 3 tables. One table had a party of four who seemed to be finishing up and the others were empty. We were seated and shortly after another couple was.

For later generations who were fortunate enough to benefit from their parents' and grandparents' pursuit of that dream, another element was added to the mix: the desire to succeed at something they were passionate about.\\n\\nIt is obvious to anyone who's spent a few minutes talking to Eric Silverstein that he is on track to achieving the new version of the American dream. He quit a lucrative job as a lawyer in Missouri to launch The Peached Tortilla, a mobile food truck business that has spent the last four months winning the hearts of food lovers in Austin. Not only is the food being turned out of this truck outstanding, but Eric's passion is infectious, and his humble, friendly demeanor means that every visit to The Peached Tortilla is not just a food run, but a visit to a friend.\\n\\nAs anyone who knows me knows, I tend to be a little suspicious of Asian fusion. I'm not sure whether I'm a traditionalist or just protective of the flavors I grew up with, but I typically cast a wary eye upon perceived attempts to evolve Asian flavors into something different. But Eric and his chef, Louis (who has worked the kitchens at Maria Maria and Imperia), have done this right. They've captured influences from Asian, Mexican, and Southern cooking and have married them in a way that makes the finished product into something altogether new, and definitely delightful. Everything I've tasted here was busting at the seams with bright, crisp, fresh flavors. Their menu tops out at $3.50, so it's very affordable for upscale-restaurant-quality food. And with gluten-free and vegetarian options available, there's a little something here for everyone.\\n\\nI've yet to make my way through the menu here, but thus far the banh mi taco and the crunchy catfish taco are my favorites.  I've heard many people extol the virtues of the banh mi slider (as opposed to the taco version), arguing that the sweetness of the bun balances out the richness of the pork belly, but I tend to favor the taco because I like the lower carb-to-protein ratio.  Spend your spare carbs on some of their fabulous Belgian fries - there are a variety of sauces to choose from, but I can wholeheartedly vouch for the sriracha mayo and the peach mint (their specialty).  I'm not usually one for sweetness where savory is generally expected, but I make an exception for the peach mint.\\n\\nThese guys are on the move, so check out their website for their weekly schedule and go grab yourself some street food deliciousness.

Perhaps we came on a bad day, but the fish did not seem fresh. More noticeably, the salmon had a slight rancid odor to it while the snapper (I believe that's what it was) was so chewy it was almost inedible.

Big up to Yelp on this one... this place is a hidden gem.\\n\\nIt's a smallish location on a street where it is one of two businesses open at night (Gladstone Street Pub... which was packed and a convenience store being the others), so it's not something your likely to stumble upon. Parking was a little more challenging than we anticipated, but not ridiculous.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the main row of four tables was full, so we grabbed a spot next to the window. We were greeted with very friendly service and given a carafe of cool water. My wife ordered an Italian soda and since they were out of ice, our server ran down to the corner convenience store to get some! I imagine that most small restaurants in that situation would just apologize for not being able to make the drink. We were impressed by the extra effort.\\n\\nWe also really enjoyed the Caesar salad we shared. Neither of us are huge Caesar fans because we don't like creamy dressings. This dressing was light and flavorful, with a nice bit of kick. It was also topped with some really fantastic fresh Pecorino Romano cheese. Yes, a perfect appetizer for the main event.\\n\\nFor pizza, we went with a large Margherita with Italian sausage (mmm.... Ottto's). The pizza came out and from the moment the aroma hit our nose, we knew we were in for a treat. The ingredients all tasted fresh and their mix of cheeses (featuring the usual suspects with, again, a little Pecorino) was fantastic. My wife fell in love with Gladstone's crust. At one point in the meal she contently said, \\"I could eat this crust all day.\\" I also had a strange affinity to the oblong shape of our pie. The large was definitely big enough for three hungry people to share.\\n\\nWe have been enjoying our leftovers while lazing around the house this afternoon.

They are keeping simple with the familiar Mexican flavors and menu.  What is exceptionally unique is that they have a salsa bar.  I've never been to a hole in the wall Mexican joint that offered the luxury of adding your own condiments and toppings to your meal.\\n\\nI had a chicken burrito and my husband had a steak burrito.  The chicken was previously marinated in something marvelous.  We topped our burritos off with some salsa verde which was delicious.  Proceed with caution though because the lighter colored salsa verde is exceptionally spicy.   They also use El Milagro tortillas, from Chicago, which gave me a taste of home.\\n\\nWe also decided to try one chicken tamale and one pork tamale.  It's as authentic as it gets unless you have a Mexican family and they are made with love.  They serve it in the husk and it steams when you open it.  Typically my favorite part of a tamale is the filling.  However the masa they made for these tamales was sweet and reminded me of corn bread.  I haven't had a tamale like that in a very long time.\\n\\nWhat is also unique but funny about this place is that it's clearly a failed Quizno's.  It still has the decor on the walls.

We hadn't seen each other in a few months and had a -lot- of catching up to do.  The place was already crowded by noon, but we managed to get a seat in the tea room which was pretty empty.  The table itself was small and low - hard to get my knees under though I'm not that tall - and my chair was literally on top of an air vent so it was very cold.  It wasn't a problem since my purse completely covered the grate, but it seems a bit of an odd set up in the first place.  \\nAnyways, we were prepared to enjoy some good food and gossip and were doing so until about half way through the meal when they began to rearrange the entire place.  I totally understood the reason - a memorial for a woman who used to be a frequent guest - and I thought it was awesome.  However, I got a definite feeling dessert wasn't really an option (I had planned to get some pie), and we did have to leave as soon as we had paid the bill.  The people working there were very nice about it all, of course, and I definitely understand the reason.... however, I rather wish someone had warned us when we came in.  We might have opted to wait for a seat in the dining room if it meant we could have had more time to chat... and also less racket from the tables being moved around.  As it was, we ended up going elsewhere for dessert and some more time to talk.\\nCertainly there would have been plenty to do while waiting - there's a very large gift shop with some interesting items.  A lot of it is the country kitsch you find at a lot of places, but there are some really nice items of jewelry, local crafts, and even some unique clothing and furniture. \\n\\nAnyways, the food itself was pretty good, at least.  \\nI was very torn by the soup selection - there were three that I normally adore.  The waitress was kind enough to let me sample the African peanut, which was good, but I ultimately went with the Morgan House soup.  ...also very good... but to be honest I thought both soups could have used a little more zing.  The Morgan House Soup in particular has a nice flavor and great texture, but the sherry taste is a bit strong and heavy.  I expected something a little more like the chicken curry soup at the Buxton Inn, which has a similar texture but the flavor is broken up with grapes which give it a refreshing lightness....  Still, very good soup and worth trying.\\n\\nFor a main course, I opted for the baked roast beef sandwich, which really was delicious.  And large.  For about $10 you get good serving of thick slices of juicy roast beef on a flaky croissant that is covered in cheese.  The cheese is melted and blends into the bread, making it that much richer and gooier.  \\nThe plate comes with one side - chips, fruit, or salad.  I opted for the salad which was large, fresh, and pretty tasty.\\nMy companion meanwhile had a strawberry orange salad which was decent in size and which she said was also quite good.\\n\\nThe meal was served with a little corn muffin for each person.  These things were great - super soft and sweet, they melted in the mouth.  \\n\\nPrices are around $7 to $10, which isn't bad considering the portion size and general quality of the ingredients.  Service is fine too, and refills are quick in coming. \\n\\nAnyways, I do think it's worth a visit.  But maybe check to make sure there aren't any special events going on in the next few hours...\\n\\nOh, and by the way - the main door at the front of the building is the one that has \\"hours\\" written on it.  Lots of people kept trying to get in through a second, more obvious door, covered in Halloween decorations that originally led onto the tea room where we were sitting.  I think we pointed about 3 people to the correct door through the window....   and would have done so for ourselves when we first arrived."},{"name":"Trattoria al Forno","address":"Disneys Boardwalk Resort, 407 - WDW DINE","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"We ate for the first time at this new restaurant at the Boardwalk.

It's really hard to go wrong when you've got $5 signature sips, $5 wine, $4 craft drafts, and $5 bites. I could honestly completely subsist on their HH menu and be completely happy, it's that good. Seating isn't limited, but you may want to call ahead to grab a table for dinner or the end of happy hour. Like most places in Austin, Salty Sow gets crowded.\\n\\nHAPPY HOUR\\n\\nI thought the Milk-Braised Pork taco had more going for it in the exotic name and ingredients than it did in the taste. Don't get me wrong -- still a marvelously crafted taco, but just a tad of a letdown. The Pork Belly Taco is unreal on another level. That thing packs major flavor and is DEFINITELY worth getting. The Fried Catfish Taco is a well-crafted version of your staple fish taco, complete with sweet onion slaw and some sort of chipotle/spicy sauce. All in all, get all 3 tacos, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.\\n\\nTheir Truffled Deviled Eggs are solid, as are their famed Duck Fat Fries. But if you really want something special, spring for the Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken on a biscuit -- it is SO good. I could eat that as an entree if I could. The Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves is also a winner. The golden raisins really make the dish pop, and it's much more filling than you'd think.\\n\\nTo drink, you obviously can't go wrong with any of their beers on tap, but the magic is in their cocktails. Certain ones will be $5 too, so really, what are you waiting for? For those who don't necessarily like the boozy flavor of alcohol, you'll definitely enjoy their Sparkling Sangria -- very light with a citrus twist. My girlfriend liked that one. My own personal favorite is the Mr. Shaw -- Bullet Rye Whiskey + Green Tea Liqeuer, honey, and lemon. That just ain't fair...\\n\\nDINNER\\n\\nIf you feel so inclined, stay for dinner as well! To be honest, I often stuff myself during Happy Hour, so I haven't gotten a chance to try too many things. I would, however, give the Petite Bone-In Filets and the Slow-Cooked Beef Shoulder a try. The former is much more of an elegant tasting dish; the filets are tender and flavorful, but the portion size isn't the biggest. The Slow-Cooked Beef Shoulder is more of your staple meal, complete with an egg, some vegetables, and mashed potatoes. I've also heard good things about the Crisp Chicken Thighs as well.\\n\\nOVERALL\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I would be perfectly willing to blindfold myself and pick something random from the menu.

When I bit into the fried bit (visually reminiscent of Americanized Chinese chicken fingers), I was pleasantly surprised by something sweet and white/creamy inside.\\n\\nOther dishes we shared included Salt & Pepper Pork Ribs $8.95 (crispy, tasty, the plate filled high), Buddha's Delight with Special Sauce $7.95 (included peapods, mushrooms - both straw and black, baby corn, glass noodles, etc - wasn't very special to me), Sauteed Pea Pod Stems $12.95 (well cooked but I don't think the waiter heard my request for the garlic version), Hon Sue Fish on rice (would have liked more stuff on the rice), Beef and Vegetable Chow Foon (tender beef and well cooked leafy green veggies), and Kon Sue Yee Mein $6.95 (don't know what the star's for - it wasn't spicy).\\n\\nIt came out to $68 for 8 lunchers, after including tip.\\n\\nI'd go back just for the crispy milk!  And I'd be up for the pork ribs again, but the rest of the menu of my next meal there would be up for discussion...\\n\\n*** 2/2010 visit update ***\\n\\nI went back for the Tailian Crispy Sticky Milk ($6.95) to see how it compared with my more recent fried milk experiences... the fried outside isn't as crispy crusty as I mis-remembered... it is kind of soft-crisp, similar to the others.  The special something to their version however is in the creamy milky center - smooth, sweet and tasty... mmmmm...\\n\\nSalt & Pepper Pork Ribs ($8.95) was just great - crispy, tender, meaty.  Hon Sue Fish in Pot ($10.95) was full of chunky chunks of fish and triangles of fried tofu.  Singapore Rice Noodles ($6.25) filled with shreds of veggies and roast pork and shrimp and eggs.  And the simple sounding Beef with Tomato & Rice ($5.75) was surprisingly tasty with tender beef and sweet tomato.\\n\\n$49 after tip & tax for our party of 7.\\n\\n***1/2011 visit ***\\n\\nReminder to self - 11 pieces to an order for the Fried Milk appetizer.\\n\\n*** 3/2013 visit ***\\n\\nFried Milk came 12 pieces to the order today.  The portions of all the dishes were pretty good.  We ordered 5 dishes for the 7 of us:\\n\\nTailiang Crispy Sticky Milk (appetizer) $6.95\\nHon Sue Fish in Pot (Casserole Dishes) $10.95\\nSauteed Pea Pod Stems (Vegetarian) $12.95\\nBeef Chow Foon (Dry Fried) (Noodles) $6.25\\nThree Delight Chow Mein (Noodles) $6.25\\n\\n*** 9/2014 ***\\n\\nGo to New Golden Gate - Get the Fried Milk!  12 yummy pieces once again.\\n\\n1 app, 1 veggie dish, 3 carb plates - enough for the appetite of 7 for $7 each - quite nice!\\n\\nNote to self - Steve W.'s photo of the Roast Beef & Rice is drawing me in, even though it is the priciest of their rice dishes at $11.95.\\n\\n*** 5/2015 ***\\n\\nStill loving the Tailiang Crispy Sticky Milk with the condensed milk dip - great for a lover of sweet-savory foods\\n\\nThe Hon Sue Fish in Pot $10.95 was a great mix of battered fish and fried beancurd, but the Salt & Pepper Squid $9.95, though tasty, was mostly body pieces and sadly lacking in the leg pieces that I so love.\\n\\nThe seafood in the Satay Seafood Udon Noodles $9.50 consisted of large pieces of squid and whole shrimp and scallops.  It was tasty with a nice chew, but don't expect to get your veggies from this dish, as it is quite lacking in that department, which is why we also got Sauteed Pea Pod Stems $12.95.\\n\\n*** 6/2015 ***\\n\\nFinally tried the Roast Beef & Rice - sadly, it was not in the form of the impressive slab of meat of Steve W.'s photo, but rather was cut up, and not very tender.\\n\\n*** 12/2017 ***\\n\\nThe chow mein in our dish wasn't as crispy as we like it on this visit.  There were very few tentacles in the salt & pepper calamari dish, which made me sad, and the dish was spicier than at many other restaurants, perhaps due to the red tinged chili sauce residual found spotting the plates?  We found that we preferred the salt & pepper wings over at Hong Kong Eatery over these, even though they're a bit small at HKE."},{"name":"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen","address":"875 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"It's an excellent restaurant.

At one point, as I cleared my belongings, the host kept telling me not to forget this/that though I was PERFECTLY capable of seeing what I needed to remove without being rushed. Simply terrible. How about next time you simply allow people to enjoy their tranquil morning/afternoon and ask incoming patrons to simply wait a minute or two instead of thanking people with impoliteness? \\n\\nI thought about coming back and recommending this place at some point, but you can certainly forget about that after the peskiness of the ?waiters and rudeness of the host (an older man).

What I received were not the extremely flavorful & ridiculously tender steak tips I have known as the best in the world. These were bland, no marinade Tia that weren't tender at all. Everyone else that ordered them experienced the same. I mentioned this to the waitress & manager, they claimed nothing had changed. Don't insult my intelligence. I explained I have been a patron for 20 years & those were not the same magnificent tips I've been eating my whole life. They stuck to their story. I never returned or recommended that place ever again.\\n\\nI was told later by inside sources after the son took over, he tried to cut corners & everything went downhill. Maybe a slap of reality hit & everything is back to the way it was that made them famous in the first place. Maybe they ran out of tips & didn't have time to marinade them properly or had a new cook that didn't know what he was doing.\\n\\nI am returning to Boston next week & based on these reviews, I'm willing to give it another shot. If their steak tips are the same as back in the Clubhouse Cafe days, I will resubmit a 5 star review as long as everyone in my party's food is of the same caliber. I'd hate for one bad night to ruin a lifetime of great food memories."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Exceptional.

However, my experience on the evening of 11/24/18 into the early morning hours of 11/25/18 around 1:30 am was absolutely horrible. I waited with my group in an expected line for over 30 minutes with absolutely no movement within the queue. I expressed my need to use the restroom with the \\"bouncer\\" several times in a professional demeanor. He stated that in order to use the facilities, I needed to be inside the establishment. I obliged as I understand the need for order, especially in the late hours of an evening full of drunken patrons. My issue is that several times he gave a pass to what I would consider attractive young females into the restaurant to use the bathroom. Finally, I got fed up and proceeded to enter Gito's to use the restroom while my group waited in line (mind you, we were at the entrance point) after the bouncer let another young female enter without question all the whole he was surfing Instagram the entire time. He immediately pushed me and the pizza maker got involved screaming at me to leave immediately. People from my group tried to remedy the situation by explaining that we are frequent customers and that one of us just needed to use the restroom as it was an emergency. The Caucasian \\"bouncer\\" with a disgusting appearance and demeanor proceeded to yell \\"you don't want any of this!\\" While one of the employees screamed at us to get out as another one closed the doors on us. This only riled up the people behind us to yell \\"its only pizza\\". I have never been embarrassed like this in my life and actually currently work in hospitality myself. Perhaps, if I was a young female wearing skimpy clothing I would have been permitted entrance to use the restroom while my group waited to order food. But instead i was manhandled and thrown out of line. While I understand that my support may not affect the business of Gitto's, I can say that I WILL NO LONGER support this business and i can assure that my friends and colleagues will no longer support this establishment any longer. I'm from Orlando and have been coming here for years during random hours (mid day and late evening). If you want proper treatment, go literally anywhere else.

We had a wonderful, knowledgable server named Jonathan. It was a Sunday, so we took advantage of the half price sushi and wine bottles.  We had the calamari which was probably the best we have ever had- crunchy and the perfect balance between sweet and spicy- with scallions to give it a savory bite. The seaweed salad and edamame were great, as were the Brussels sprouts. The mac and cheese was exceptional-crunchy & delicious with extra fine breadcrumbs, and the dynamite and spicy tuna crunch specialty roles were amazing. We finished the meal with coffee, a s'mores dessert and the most delicious warm vanilla butter cake ever!!! It was perfectly buttery, warm, sweet and rich with a crunch to the crust and an imported Italian cherry drizzle to cut the richness and add a bright finish.

I followed the salad with the roasted chicken and squash risotto, which was near perfect. Creamy, savory-- the sage and peas married perfectly with the roasted dark meat and the soft squash. Also, the portion was just right  (I ordered the half size).\\nI also tried my friend's gorgonzola gnocchi, which was delish- and I am picky about the texture of that pasta. Arugula's tasted fresh and firm but had just the right give to it. I did have a little food envy at my other friend's selection- she ordered the Mahi special that was prepared in a brown butter sauce with a tasty crust of herbs. Wow.\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning about our trip, as it seems others had a different experience, is that our service was great. The servers kept our waters filled, made menu suggestions when we were torn between items, and generally made sure we felt taken care of. Now, it could be that it was a mostly young male staff and we were a table of girls, but worth saying, they were attentive, fast and helpful either way :)\\n\\nFor lunch, I'd say this is a bit of a splurge spot.

This was a very flavorful pasta dish. \\nCoconut Citrus Layer Cake - No need to explain. They've got the desserts down! \\n\\nOther - \\nHarvard Square w/ the Chipotle Black Bean Burger - Solid burger.

I'll try not to make this too long but hopefully a manager will read this and be semi-concerned about it. I was there with my national team about a month ago during the Indoor World Championships. We entered the restaurant that was pretty much empty. There was about 12 of us and we had made a reservation. We were seated and everything was going pretty well up until about the time we ordered. Our waters were never filled once!!!!! In fact after I specifically asked two different waiters if they could fill up our waters and yet our waters were never filled up. The waiters were very rude the entire time. I understand that it is hard to serve a team of people that are speaking a different language but to be fair everyone on our team was polite and tried their best to communicate in English. Our table was never approached again until it was time to order desert. \\n\\nNow keep in mind that in our country as well as most countries in the world we tip waiters based on how well they did their job. Our team leader paid for everyone and not knowing about the 15% rule, he did not tip. Sucks I get it. But I'm sure when you come to our country you don't know of all the unwritten rules. One of the waiters approached me and very rudely told me \\"to try to educate my coach on that in the US we give at least 15% tips\\". I have lived in the US for the last 8 years and I have never tipped less than 20%. I also completely understand the waiter informing someone on the table about it. However, nothing about his tone or choice of words were even close polite. \\n\\nSo now after a few hours of dehydration (since our waters were never filled to begin with, you can imagine how we got punished after our coached didn't tip), I took control of the situation. The 15% tip was paid and balance was restored to the world. Not a single one of the waiters was even close to apologetic about the awful way they had treated everyone there. \\n\\nAll I have to say is that you are all lucky you don't work in a country were you get tipped based on your job quality and performance and not just because.\\n\\nI, as well as my friends (and I mean American friends), will never dine in a Yard House again.

Initially - for example, when the bread was brought (apologetically) to us after we had already finished our 1st course - I didn't care.\\n\\nBut then, all main courses were served except for mine.  Again, at first I waited patiently - I was sharing a 2nd dish with someone else, so had something to eat while I waited.\\n\\nThen the waitress came over to check how our meal was before I even had mine!  I answered 'it's good, but I'm still waiting for my pasta', and she acted like it was intentional that I didn't have my dish - her explanation was that we were all supposed to be sharing all the dishes, so it shouldn't matter if something comes out later than the rest.  But - it was obvious that we WEREN'T all sharing all the dishes - our orders were taken by person, no extra plates were given as is usually the case in 'family style' serving.  And besides, I actually WAS sharing with someone else at the table, and we had already finished the 2 other dishes we had ordered!\\n\\nSo - this is the worst part - everyone finished their food, and the waitress was CLEARING THE TABLE - and my pasta STILL had not even been made!  As she was clearing the table, I asked her again about it, and she didn't really say anything - just ran back to the kitchen.  Then, she came back about 10 minutes later with THE WRONG DISH!  Finally - after we were all REALLY done with dinner - my pasta came.  They gave an extra serving and small plates to the rest of the table so I wouldn't have to eat alone.  Nice enough, but really the LEAST possible compensation given the circumstances.\\n\\nTO THE MANAGEMENT: I hope, for your own sake, that you can improve your service.   I would love to refer others to Damiano's based on the fantastic food and exciting menu.

Overall, we have mixed feelings about this place. Starting with the good - the burgers were tasty. We had the BC burger and our friend had the crab burger. The fries were perfectly crispy and not greasy and the burgers were well-seasoned and flavourful, although a bit on the salty side (we normally don't salt much at home). Taste was great.\\n\\nNow the bad - the service. We arrive and are kind of haphazardly instructed to find a table. No problem, we sit down and look over the menu. The server brings ice water and asks for our orders. Our friend and I order our meals, with some add-ons like mushrooms, cheese, etc... but when she comes around to taking my fiance's order, he tells her which burger and is about to add what he wants extra, but she had already abruptly walked away! He had to chase down our server at the till to finish ordering his meal. After about 20 mins and several patrons before us being served (the place was barely half full and had three servers and three chefs on), our server returned to say that our burgers are going be a bit longer because they chef wanted to get fresh crab out for the crab burger and offered us free dessert. Ok, that was a nice gesture considering desserts were about $4 each. Burgers finally arrive and unfortunately I didn't have a great handle on the basket as she passed it to me and I dropped it. Fries and lettuce ended up on the table and unfortunately in my friend's glass of water. My fault, completely, but our table didn't get wiped down, and the server only came by once to see if we wanted more water, not give her a fresh glass so that she could actually have some! Lastly, we split the bill up by ourselves. I paid for mine and my fiance's and we went up to the front to settle. I asked for $30 to be charged to me and my friend just for hers. The server looked kind of confused about the math and asked if my fiance was going to pay for his separately. Seriously?! $30 BEFORE tip seems a bit much for one $14.00 burger, no?\\n\\nOverall, the food was pretty good and I would go back for it, but definitely take-out. The service is pretty lacking and I agree with Picky E that the staff aren't particularly friendly or helpful. Maybe in a few months once they figure things out it will improve and I might try again."},{"name":"Your Mom's Burger Bar","address":"1701 E Cesar Chavez St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I spent a sensually delightful lunchtime at Your Mom's. \\n\\nYeah, I said it.\\n\\n(This place invites those kinds of statements, obviously.)\\n\\nSo, obligatory joke about your sainted mother out of the way, I can now get down to the business of reviewing this place...\\n\\nI've been a fan ever since my first visit, back in mid-March.

Located in one of the mall's outer plazas, Burger 21 offers a wide selection of beef, poultry, seafood and vegetarian burgers, along with an assortment of fries, shakes and hot dogs.  Orders are placed at a counter near the main entrance to the restaurant and diners are then given a number for placement on their table so that servers can find them.  B21 has the look and feel of a '50's diner (but, sadly, the employees are not similarly uniformed).\\n\\nI visited with one companion when we found ourselves running errands in the area.  I opted for the Greek, a vegetarian patty served on a grain bun with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and a feta cheese dressing.  The bun was fresh, as were the produce products.  The sauce was surprisingly flavorful and a great addition, although I would opt for a smaller portion of it next time.  The veggie patty was fairly standard but served as a good platform for all of the other ingredients.  I ordered my burger with a regular sized order of fries and found them to be truly outstanding -- full of flavor and not even a hint of grease, surprisingly plentiful, too!\\n\\nMy companion ordered a Black and Blue 6 oz burger.  The burger was cooked to order (Medium Well) and served with bacon and blue cheese.  My companion loved it but would have preferred a larger patty.  Next time he will double up on the 4.5 oz patty.  He also loved his fries.\\n\\nWhile I try to avoid the Millenium area because of the traffic, if I have to go back, as I know inevitably I shall, I will make a point of stopping at B21 for another lunch!

I got the slow cooked beef shoulder which came with veggies and mash potatoes. Yummm it was pretty good but sad it got cold so fast since we were freezing outside. We also got our desserts to go since we couldn't stand sitting outside much longer. It took a very long time to the point we were like nah cancel the order.

The custard and fruit were good but the sugar top that's suppose to be caramelized glass was all broken up and just burnt. So the whole thing tasted burnt.

We had the octopus and crab fritter (both $15) for starters. I would only recommend the crab fritter as the octopus tasted very average to us. For the entrees, we had the lamb shank (highly recommended) and the pasta with squid ink sauce (so-so). For dessert, we ordered the budino with rosemary cookie, very highly recommended as it was very unique to us and something we never tasted before. \\n\\nPersonally, I enjoyed the decor because of the upscale, industrial feel of the place. While walking to the bathroom, you go in the back and you can literally visualize the old train station that existed before so there's a huge sense of history throughout."},{"name":"L'Atelier","address":"1739 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I came here last night for a romantic night out. We'd been here once before a number of years ago and remembered it being very delicious, but for some reason hadn't made it back. While trying to think of a place to dine, I looked at the menu online and the thought of lobster got firmly lodged in my brain. Must. have. lobster.\\n\\nL'Atelier did not disappoint. We started with the escargot which was so good. Definitely the best I've had in a long time. Then I had the Lobster Meuniere which seriously scratched my lobster itch. It was just perfect and at 29 bucks, pretty reasonable. My husband had the Lobster Ravioli which he scarfed down. Yum. We rounded out the evening with their Verona molten cake. I'm a sucker for molten cakes so if it is on a menu, I will have to have it. Not surprisingly, L'Atelier's was delicious.\\n\\nI was impressed by how expansive the menu is. At first I was confused because the daily special menu is large enough that it could be the complete menu. But then I realized that was just the daily specials and the regular menu was twice as long. I already knew what I wanted when I walked through the door, but there were many mouthwatering items.\\n\\nThe service was very good, especially for Boulder. Our waiter was pleasant, helpful, and definitely knew his stuff when we had questions about specific items on the menu.\\n\\nI do think that the restaurant looks like it is in need of a makeover.

Our new server was Jeff who I have only great things to say about. He was attentive answered all our questions and got our food out accordingly. We then got our Bill and realized we had been charged for dinner portions even though we came in before 3 and had lunch menus. The manager Carl said the only thing he could do was give 10% off for the difference which wasn't even close to half of the difference we paid for our \\"dinner\\" portions. He never came over to apologize or explain further and left it up to Jeff. It was unfair and outrageous. I have worked in the restaurant business and though the customer isn't \\"always right\\" we do all we can do to make them happy and want to return.

I was instantly overwhelmed by the comfort and homey atmosphere of the place, which so vividly looked like a home. The dining room itself was very modern but had a casual romantic feel to its persona, and the heat from the fireplace only extended our feeling of comfort. The menu was very dynamic yet it stuck to the authentic roots of Italian cooking in offering a simple gnocchi pasta and a impressive octopus carpaccio that I was very inclined to order. Our weightier was very warm and informative, and served us more so as friends than customers through the simple exchange of Italian gestures and appraisals. The food we had was perfectly executed, using the Italian perception of food preparation to its fullest potential (in which would be to only use the best ingredients in the most simple of techniques). The lamb that I ordered was perfectly cooked and most simply just melted in your mouth. The bitter mix of greens such as arugula and the simple preparation of baby artichoke only elevated the plate further. The cuisine itself was not so costly and taking into account the flavors and artistic design, it was probably under priced. Our server tended to all our needs with the most professional of manners and socialized with us, giving a brief yet informative teaching of Italy and prescribed all the best things suited for a perfect night. The dessert was honestly my favorite part, in which he recommended an espresso cake with raspberries. For lack of a better term, the cake was absolute bliss, and baffled not only my perception of dessert but also that of my friends. My favorite part of the whole experience was the ambiance of the restaurant and how a simple dinner turned into the ultimate experience. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to impress a lady and maybe even a gent if they happen to be culinary inclined. I missed Italy for a very long time and I longed for its warmth, but Lupo re-instituted my love for Italia and I  will most certainly be back soon to partake in another wonderful experience.

Finally I had a chance to try the foods at Thai Bloom last Sunday. We chose to sit in the dining area as we wanted to focus on the food. The servers were very friendly and attentive. The restaurant was spacious, clean and well-decorated. For appetizers, we ordered \\"Hoi-Joh\\" (Thai-style fried crab cake) and \\"Crying Tiger\\" (Medium rare roasted beef with special Thai dried chili dipping sauce called \\"Jaew\\"). I have never seen any Thai restaurant in the U.S. having Hoi-Joh in the menu and I was impressed. Even though the taste was not as good as the original Hoi-Joh from the Eastern Thailand, it was close enough. The \\"Jaew\\" dipping sauce for \\"Crying Tiger\\" was perfect. For the main dishes, I ordered the signature boat noodle. (A short Thai food history lesson for this dish: the reason it has the name boat noodle is because it used to be sold by the vendor on the boat along the canal in Thailand some hundred years ago.) Normally, the boat noodle in Thailand is the noodle in beef stock soup with slow-cooked mixture of beef brisket and beef or pork meatballs served in a small bowl - you can easily eat 5-10 bowls and stacking them up. Here in Thai Bloom, however, the portion is so gigantic that we should call it \\"Titanic\\" boat noodle. In my opinion, the taste has been americanized but it is still savory by adding some Thai chili and vinegar. My friend ordered \\"Yen-ta-fo\\" (pink noodle soup). The pink (or red) color of the soup comes from the fermented tofu inspired by the combination of Thai/Chinese dish. The taste was also good. I highly recommended this two noodle dishes. For the dessert, I used Yelp mobile app checking in the business and received the free home-made coconut ice-cream. (Thank you, Yelp! for this surprising deal.) The ice-cream is a perfect finish for our meal. All in all, it was a satisfying dinner. The foods came a little bit slow (may be because the restaurant was busy) but the huge portion and the taste of the foods made up for the waiting time. The price is a little higher than typical Thai restaurant but it is still reasonable.

Fortunatley, I never tried the former East Boston location because apparently, his stuff was better before than now. Currently, Uncle Pete's serves the best ribs I've had. I've also yet to sample offerings from the South and I'm honestly afraid to, but for now Uncle Pete's is number one in my book.\\n\\nFor starters, give the teriyaki wings a shot. The skin is nice and crispy and the sauce packs a lot of flavor. I've tried the baby back ribs once and as I recall, they were good. Now it's not to say that they didn't leave a good impression with me, but it was the next dish that caught my attention, the Texas Beef Ribs. The size of these ribs are ungodly. Each of these ribs are like the size of a paper towel roll, well maybe not a full roll, but maybe quarter of a roll. But even then, that's huge! You'd undoubtedly need several people to finish the whole rack. As for the taste, very chewy, juicy, and unavoidably messy to eat. \\n\\nWhat else to wash it down, but a nice pitcher of beer poured into jars instead of pint glasses.\\n\\nIt's been a while since I've gone back, probably about half a year now because upon first discovering this joint, within a two month period, going to Uncle Pete's turned into an every other weekend thing, and needless to say, I packed on a considerable amount of weight after eating so many orders of beef ribs. \\n\\nThe service given by these guys is nothing short of perfect.

To top it all off the uber diner-esque rotating column display of desserts just screams \\"EAT ME!\\"\\n\\nAll of that being said, there are some issues. Veggie Galaxy, while it looks big, doesn't actually have that many tables that can hold more than two people. If you're in a party of 3 or more, expect to wait at least 30-45 minutes or more for a booth, at least on a Friday. They could've finagled a few tables in here that were more appropriate for larger parties but opted not to.\\n\\nThe food, while being really quite good and fun and different from some of the typical vegetarian shtuff out there, has a couple issues too. For one, all dishes are around $10. The burgers are small little things, and typically when you order a burger for that price, you can generally expect to take half of it home. Not here. The sandwiches are bigger, and if you're not absolutely starving, you should be able to get some leftovers out of that. Possibly the same goes for the entrees, depending on your hungriness.\\n\\nFor two, while again yummy and different, it's not terribly difficult to make these things at home, provided you bought some seitan or tofu or tempeh. It's mostly just stacked up with some ordinary veggies and a condiment.\\n\\nIt really is delicious, but it's not worth the price, or perhaps something might have been off when I came.

My wife and I went there to start date night and we both really enjoy Thai food.  The place wasn't very big, looking to hold around twenty diners, and the decor was simple and clean.  They had local art work adorning the walls, which is great.  More businesses should support local artists.\\n\\nWe were greeted, first by who we guess was the owner, or manager, and then by our server.  We started with a couple of specialty teas; I got a cold Oolong and Jasmine mix and my wife got a Thai blend with sweet milk in it.  Both we're tasty.  We also ordered a Summer roll appetizer, which was lettuce, cut carrots and other veggies, wrapped in rice paper.  It came with a vinaigrette sauce, but it still lacked in taste.  She liked it, but it was not my thing; personal preference, I don't dig raw veggies all that much.  \\n\\nThen, for our main course, she ordered the basil and beef, which was rated at a 3 out of 5 on the heat scale-very important to know at a Thai restaurant.  I ordered the Shrimp Curry, which was a 2.5 out of 5.  The curry, which came with jasmine rice, could have been a little spicier, but know I know for next time....  There will be a next time.  I love a good curry sauce, and this was beyond delicious!  So buttery with hints of the coconut milk.  The shrimp were a nice size and there was cooked squash, egg plant, zucchini and tomatoes mixed in.\\n\\nWhat can I say?

The staff was friendly enough and the food came out within a decent time frame, but that was about all the positives about this place.  I ordered fried pickles for an appetizer, and they tasted like they were pickled with way too much dill seasoning.  With every bite, the dill seasoning (and the salt) caught me in the back of the throat and made it difficult to eat.  Then came my entree, the French Dip.  The fries were incredibly salty and had a weird taste about them, like somebody had accidently put the wrong seasonings in them.  The sandwich was half burnt while the other half was too soggy to even pick up.  I resorted to using my knife and fork just to eat it.  It had way too much meat (that was dried out and half burnt to boot) and only one slice of swiss cheese on it.  The entire meal was way too salty.  After downing a glass of water I could still taste the salt.  Thirty minutes and a peppermint later, the salty taste left in my mouth is finally starting to go away.

Service was extremely slow, and our server was basically nonexistent. Someone else brought out bread for us. After sitting down and getting bread, it took 30ish minutes for the server to come back and take our order. We waited another 35 minutes for our food (I timed it because I was getting miffed at just how slowly everything was happening).\\n\\nThe food was very average. Portions are absolutely HUGE, and I guess the prices are reasonable since you're paying for like 3-4 total meals. But honestly I don't think there was anything on the menu that I couldn't just buy at a grocery store and make for myself at a fraction of the price--my boyfriend remarked that the menu equation was essentially: pick a pasta, pick a sauce, and pick a topping (meat/vegetable). \\n\\nThere was absolutely no service during the eating time, no \\"how is everything?\\" My group made small talk for another 40 minutes, thinking the server would come back with a check. Nope. After waiting for 40 minutes and taking our bathroom breaks, I flagged down another server to get us the check. This process of getting the check and getting our cards processed so we could leave was another 10ish minutes, much much longer than I've experienced at comparably busy places on Saturday nights. \\n\\nWe spent over three hours at this place for an extremely average meal.

Typically this means that the food has been changed to cater to non-Vietnamese people; something I abhor.  I was also taken aback the most of the reviews on yelp were by non-Vietnamese people also.  So I must say that my first impression of this place was a \\"Vietnamese\\"-fusion restaurant where I get charged more because it is presented in nice plates and there is a running waterfall out front.\\n\\nI can definitely say that I was right about this place in a lot of ways, the fact that it the recipes were changed for more non-traditional tastes, but it has definitely shown me that I am dead wrong about how that is a bad thing.  \\n\\nThe decor of the place is incredibly modern contemporary and I love it.  Exposed wooden panelings everywhere, wonderful old prints of a vietnamese family a long the walls.  I enjoyed the fact that the main seating area was a long table that people had to share.  This enforced a more casual feel and community which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I was able to chit-chat with my neighbors about this restaurant while I drank my Tea. \\n\\nThat is another important aspect of this restaurant.  I do not believe I have ever been served Artichoke Tea before at a Vietnamese restaurant, even though it is a famous Tea exported from Da Lat, Vietnam.  This is one of my favorite Teas.  It is a very nice calm, fresh taste that very closely resembles seaweed.  In the back, I could see a gigantic jar full of dried Artichoke ready to be steeped.  I asked the waiter if they bought it locally from a seller because I wanted to buy some, apparently they had imported it directly Vietnam.  Darn....\\n\\n I had a tough time deciding on what to order.  Typically you judge a Vietnamese restaurant on their specialty, whether that be Pho, Banh cuon, Com Tam, or Bun Bo Hue.  I decided to go traditional because I couldn't figure out their speciality, I ordered Pho.  Simple, basic, and every Vietnamese restaurant will typically serve it.\\n\\nI must say I was surprised by how they presented the Pho to me.  It was an interesting take on the plating.  The waiter brought out a large Plate and on it was a bowl of Pho,  a plate of the rare beef (uncooked), and the garnish on the side of the large Plate.  I really enjoyed this plating because it was fairly unique.  You typically have the rare beef in the Pho bowl already (slightly cooked) and the garnish would be on a separate plate.  The problem with this is that they always gave you too much garnish which would end up cluttering up your eating area, the rare beef would be cooked to some varying degree depending on the person who made it, and the broth would get murky with the run-off from the rare beef being cooked by the hot soup.  It was such a revelation to me to see it presented in this way as I able to cook the rare beef to my tenderness and be presented with a very clear broth.  I was able to just put all my garnish in and just turn the large plate so that the bowl faced me.  Such novelty. \\n\\nThe key to any Pho is the stock.  Everything else is somewhat forgiven as long as the stock is good and this place delivers on the stock.  It was a very clean and clear taste of Pho without the weird taste because they used a simmered it too long or on high heat and so the carcass started dissolving into the soup itself.  It was just that, good Pho soup.  That alone deserves the 4 Stars.  \\n\\nThe bad things about the soup were the roast beef they had put in there, it was a bit chewy, and the noodles was cooked and left too long in the bowl before the Pho soup was introduced.   This made the noodles toughen up (and hence somewhat chewy) and start sticking together (and hence harder to eat properly).  The beef I could have forgiven, but not the noodle, which in this writer's opinion, is one of the more essential components to a good pho. \\n\\nI will definitely be making more frequent visits to this restaurant and trying their other dishes as I am curious how much care they put into their other dishes as much as this bowl of Pho."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Ok, I do not get the great reviews.

I have been to Hollywood Columbus approximately 15 times mainly for poker. I put in many hours at the poker tables. I received a players card but the first four months the casino was open they gave no comps at all. I probably put in 50 hours at the poker tables and have been told zero points on my card. The customer service relative to other casinos is well below average. To be fair the Hollywood casino in Lawrenceburg is better in that department but the Columbus casino falls short in many areas.  The food is overpriced and so are the drinks are as well. The Oh! Restaurant is decent.  The west side location does not work well. There are no hotels nearby. Your simply a number here.  The casinos in Cincinnati are less expensive have better food and much better service.  I hear people compare this to Las Vegas. It is just not comparable. If there was more competition in the area this place would be in trouble. It is run like a monopoly.  Installing electronic virtual blackjack machines with lower limits would help increase traffic. A shoot to win electronic craps game would help too. Many vegas casinos have them now and they are a lot of fun. A shuttle to nearby hotels would help too.

We are whisked in with no wait whatsoever and are seated at our regular table. Our server always greets us with a warm smile, right along with those delicious warm chips and the salsa that has just the right amount of kick. This morning for breakfast, I had the Huevos Mexicanos with cheese and corn tortillas, of course. The food was brought out quickly and the taste of the eggs, jalapenos, onions, peppers and potatoes, along with just a hint of beans laid carefully into my corn tortilla and then drizzled with the salsa- well, my eyes pretty much just rolled back into my head with gustatory delight! Each bite was as good as the last. I always say to myself \\"Matthew, now, don't over-do it on the food, because there's SOOOO much!\\" And, every time I'm at the Village, my self control takes a vacation and I end up eating the whole entire plate. Who could blame me though? And, I challenge anyone to try to stop. Basically, it's impossible not to EAT THE WHOLE THING!!! YUM!!! Oh, did I mention the never-ending refills of piping hot coffee to go with the breakfast. If my eye's rolled back in my head, they were certainly wide  open!!

The bartender was obnoxious because he wanted to be paid in cash, so he wouldn't have to run inside of the restaurant to process a card. That was the good part of the visit. After we were seated we waited about 15 minutes before a waiter came to our table. He only did so after I complained to the hostess about the lack of service. My two companions were having a great time due to the atmosphere - they had live music. After finally placing the drink, appetizer, and food order, we had to wait another 20 minutes for the drinks. Our waiter, very apologetically, said that our food would be out soon because there was a some type of leak in the kitchen. I said fine, but what did that have to do with us not getting the drink order sooner. A few minutes later the drinks arrived. After the food arrived I was disappointed. I ordered mofongo con carne frita. I received a \\"fun size\\" version of a mofongo (it was half the regular size of any other mofongo at any other Puerto Rican restaurant in town) and six pieces of fried pork which were mostly fat.  A week later, I'm still waiting for the appetizer. Also, the bathrooms were disgusting, comparable to a nightclub in downtown in Orlando.

There are only people at 6 tables and one of the tables of four people just got up and walked out. \\nLet me add, the reason we got 2 mac and cheeses and not three, is because two of the 3 were for the children, and the 2 year old was screaming and hollering after waiting for so damn long for NOTHING.

Service is always SO quick, SO easy and very kind and it makes all the difference.  Hands down actually the best service I've experienced here in Boston.  Very clean. \\n\\nTwelve Hours changed my life.  Okay that's a little dramatic, but for the days I was just craving some Asian food but didn't know what I wanted, I'd drop by knowing I'd get great food, a friendly face and NOT break the bank.

A side salad, 2 apps, an entree and drink for something like $11 - $12?! In Boston?! Yes.please. \\n\\nThat said, their menu is a mix/fusion of Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese food and while normally an EXTENSIVE menu scares me as it says that a restaurant can do many things but maybe not well, Twelve Hours really does (at least everything I have had) everything well. From the apps to the ramen, to the fried rice to the drinks, it's all very yummy!  Is it okay to say yummy?  This place reminds me of home.  \\n\\nOne of my favorite things about this place is that while the food is AMAZING they don't skimp on the service or just depend on the food to speak for itself.  There is ALWAYS a friendly face at the counter, willing to help or offer recommendations (if asked) from the menu.  The care they take into making the food is not just apparent in the taste but in the \\"character\\" of the place.  When you do take-out, they normally bag it up for you in a paper bag, but twist the handles and staple down the sides to make sure that nothing spills out but that you can still carry the bag.  It's the little things that count ya know? And it's little things like that help set Twelve Hours apart.  \\n\\nRecommendations: \\nApp: 6 piece shrimp (shrimp paste on toast); Scallion Pancake with Avocado; 6 piece chicken wings\\nEntree: Red Curry Ramen (spicy), Kimchi Fried Rice (spicy/sour: Kimchi);\\nDrinks: Thai Iced Coffee"},{"name":"Jade Sushi & New Asian","address":"2425 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I wish I liked Jade more being it's so close to my house, but it just doesn't do it for me.

The tacos had a nice sauce and some crumbled cheese. Although a mini size the stuffing exceeded it's capacity so I had to start out eating some it it wit a fork to avoid spillage when folded. Not a bad value. The shrimp were good and average value. I'd say large not jumbo size. (Bigger than pinky but not a thumb)\\n\\nThe place is tightly packed.  Which afforded me the view of what others were eating. The sandwiches looked filling and the salmon dish looked liked something I'd like to order next time. \\n \\nI have no concerns, other than it was little loud and very busy but considering the environment and timing of our visit it's what I'd expect. \\nSo yes I'd definitely return the next time I'm in the area."},{"name":"Robyn's Bar and Grill","address":"4195 Washington St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"3","text":"Yummy food and not too expensive drinks.

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the dessert was not good at all.  We got this chocolate torte, and it was so dry.  Plus, the menu said that it would be served with espresso gelato, and it came with strawberry, which wasn't super awesome.  Also, the wine prices are outrageous, but that's to be expected of North End restaurants. \\n\\nNow, let's talk about everything else about this place - all amazing.  This has to be one of the top 5 romantic restaurants in the Boston area.  The restaurant is in this old house, and there are 5 separate dining areas.  The lighting, table set-up, and decor create such a romantic atmosphere.  We felt like we were the only couple in the room, especially because we were served by two separate servers throughout the night.  We were never waiting for something for two long, and I felt like we received the perfect balance of attention.\\n\\nWe started with 2 apps - the lamb with pumpkin gnocchi and mozzarella with prosciutto and tomatoes.  My boyfriend loved the lamb dish, but it wasn't that appealing to me because it tasted a little too salty.  He said he'd love it to be his main course though, so perhaps it was just my taste.  The mozzarella...oh, the mozzarella....I could have eaten plate after plate of it.  They said that it's flown in from Italy.  Wherever it comes from, it is the best mozzarella I've ever had and perfectly complimented with olive oil, prosciutto, tomatoes, and basil.  For dinner, my boyfriend had roasted chicken with lentils and brussel sprouts.  I was kind of thinking it was a strange choice for an Italian restaurant because I love pasta, but it was such a good dish.  The chicken was cooked perfectly - so juicy and tender.  And he loved the lentil, olive, brussel sprout combo.  My dish was New England seafood pasta, and it was sooo good!  The pasta was good, not overwhelmingly so, and there wasn't much sauce, just a light olive oil (if I remember correctly).  But the dish was all about the seafood, which was cooked perfectly!  I never eat all of an entree, but I had to eat every bite of this meal.  \\n\\nIf you have any anniversary to celebrate or just want a romantic night out, I highly recommend Mama Maria."},{"name":"Your Mom's Burger Bar","address":"1701 E Cesar Chavez St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I have mixed feeling about this place.

I searched through Paul F's reviews as we have pretty good common tastes and found he really liked the Hunan House and had given it very high rating so we decided to give the place a try as it was only a few miles from our house.  \\n\\nArriving there you could see this was a big restaurant.  It looked really nice, not a shop mall scrub buffet type Chinese place but a real honest to goodness quality Chinese restaurant.  Going inside we were greeted after the gentleman finished up a call (that just rang as we arrived) and were pretty impressed with the interior of the restaurant, which is really, really nice.  I also appreciated the fact it's not too bright, it's sort of on the dark side.  I know many may not like that but it suits me just fine as I prefer the atmosphere of more laid back and traditional dining. \\n\\nWe started out with some Crab Rangoons and WOW...they were utterly fantastic.  Probably about the best I think I've ever eaten.  Very impressive!  Next we got a couple of egg rolls and again, they were quite good.  Very hot as they were just out of the kitchen, which was nice, no messing around getting us the food, we got them quick and they were ready to eat after a few minutes of cooling down.  Next up I had the hot and sour soup which was top notch as well.  The broth was quite thick and yummy, just how I like it!\\n\\nFor my entree I got the Dragon & Phoenix which was spicy prawns on one side of the plate and seasoned, breaded chicken in ginger sauce on the other side of the plate.  Both were excellent.  The prawns tasted very fresh and they were plentiful.  Also, they had just the perfect amount of spiciness.  I did have to take off my one shirt I had worn over my main shirt as it heated me up, LOL!  The chicken in ginger was simply awesome and my fiance said she enjoyed it a slight bit more than her Sesame Chicken, which by the way she loved.  \\n\\nIn conclusion - this is now our favorite Chinese restaurant, surpassing the Lucky House and Panda Inn at Polaris.  The only caveat was they are a bit more expensive than either of those places.  Of course in their defense we did get an appetizer, extra egg rolls, soup and drinks (tea/diet coke) in addition to our entrees so if you were to keep it to just an entree it'd be much more reasonable.\\n\\nThe pecking order in regards to price would be this place at the top, then Panda House on Polaris next and finally Lucky House so it's up to you how much you really want to spend but at any of these three places you will get some great food, the difference is mostly going to be in the actual dining experience itself with Hunan House being the best dining experience, then Panda House and finally Lucky House (which also discounts 10% when you do carryout which is nice). \\n\\nMy thanks goes out to Paul F. and his wonderful review and pictures of this place.

The manager up front (having learned that I am about to leave to go to the hospital) goes to the back, and then informs me that yes, that dish does in fact contain pine nuts. \\nThankfully my boyfriend has survived that near death experience. And now having been charged thousands of dollars from hospital charges (post insurance) , Rosa Mexicano denies helping to pay for the hospital bill even after all six of us witnesses at the table heard and saw our server clearly state that this dish had \\"no pine nuts\\".

I'll never go back.\\n\\nNice decor, hostess was nice.  We were seated in a very cold spot where the AC was blasting on my neck.  I asked them to move, the hostess didn't seem to have a problem and quickly gave us another table.  Then the table was super wobbly.  That's not a huge deal right?  Usually, they come out with wedges and fix it.  We told our waitress who ANGRILY started ripping our place settings off the table with no explanation.  I said, \\"wait um, can't we just throw a match book under there?\\"  She replied, \\"Ah, no.\\" and was reaching all around under the table legs while wobbling the table all around, knives and forks were sliding all around.  Another waiter came and helped unscrew something on the bottom and fixed it.  So we started the night with an exasperated waitress.  She then rushed us for our wine order, I had not one second to look at the menu.  I asked some questions about the wine, she seemed somewhat knowledgeable until I realized she described both glasses exactly the same.  Whatever though right?  I figured one of them will be just fine and picked the first one she recommended.  It was really good.  She was going on and on about different vineyards and was writing stuff down.  What was she writing down?  I have no idea.  I thought she was going to rip off a piece of paper with recommendations for me.  But, no.  I really had no idea what was happening.  \\n\\nWe ordered our food.  Bread came, it was really yummy.  Olives, delish.  The risotto saffron appetizer, my husband liked, I thought it was just medium.  Then, the beet salad happened.  This was so bad it was inedible.  The beets were boiled to death and flaccid, with no taste.  Seriously, just gross.  The endive was bitter as endive usually is, but this had nothing as strong to set it off, just the delicate taste of beets that had been punished in a boiling pot of water.  The honey citrus dressing was a disaster, it was as if there was sticky molasses on the plate, it looked good but was horrible.  I couldn't eat it.  To make matters worse, when the waitress came over, and asked how it was, it was so bad that I had to say something.  You know when something isn't really bad per se but you just don't like it you're like, \\"Fine.\\"  When they ask.  Because you know you should have ordered something else and the food wasn't bad it was just that you didn't care for it.  Well, she asked me and I couldn't even lie.  I said, \\"It's not so good, I have to be honest.\\"  Which is usually the cue for, \\"Oh I'm so sorry, can I get you something else.\\"  Or \\"What seems to be the trouble?\\" Or \\"Can I get you another one?\\"  She just said, \\"Well.  Everyone has different palates.\\"  I was pissed that she was to rude and I gave her another shot, which was \\"Actually, the beets are just so over cooked.\\"   And she just shrugged and said, \\"I guess just different palates.\\"\\n\\nShe then was angry at me for the rest of the night.  Both of our main dishes were also just not good.  He got the ravioli with the pumpkin sauce.  It had no flavor and the pumpkin sauce was thick just shy of pumpkin pie.  I got the beet spaghetti with shrimp and tomato confit.  The pasta was cooked al dente, which was nice, but the dish too had zero flavor.  The shrimp were also over cooked and fishy.  The whole dish was bad, I stopped eating it grateful that I had eaten bread and olives.\\n\\nI figured, oh, she's going to bring the check and take off the beet salad and say something at the end such as, \\"here's the check, I removed the beet salad off your check. \\"  But she said nothing, she pissily (if that's word) gave us the check and stomped off.  She was so rude to us the whole night.  The sad part is, she was training someone.    We left a 15% tip, which is small.  Don't bother going here.

The service was great, and the sushi was better than I expected it to be.  Feng Shui is a HUGE restaurant located in one of Cohasset's shopping plazas.  The room is open and inviting, with various dining \\"rooms\\" (the dividers don't really obstruct your view of each \\"room\\").  I noticed the buffet set up near the front of the restaurant, but we were seated in the farther end of the restaurant away from it.  The restaurant is bright and well-kept, and the hosts and servers were very friendly.  \\n\\nEven though I was impressed by the appearance and atmosphere of the restaurant, I was still skeptical about how the food would be.  My dining partner and I ordered two cups of miso soup to start with, a selection of sushi, and a half order of the Beijing duck.  The miso soup was typical of a Japanese restaurant while the sushi was excellent.  We had ordered the Spring Flower Maki (8 pieces), the Spicy Tuna Maki (6 pieces), and am 8-piece \\"Fire\\" maki listed on the Specials menu (I hate that I can't remember the name!).  The Spring Flower Maki was very good; I like the extra crunch that comes with it.  The Spicy Tuna Maki was delicious as well as always being a staple choice for me. :)  The \\"Fire\\" maki...oh.my.goodness.  My mouth really felt like it was on fire!  You know that feeling when something is so spicy that it makes your eyes tear, where your water and the scorpian bowl you're sharing isn't enough to stop the pain?  Well that was the feeling I had, but, boy, was that sushi good.  And even though I could only handle two pieces of the fire that night, I would definitely order it again.  The flavor was intense, and I enjoyed the heat very much.  My DP and I definitely have eyes that are bigger than our stomachs because, although we didn't need it, we also feasted on the half Beijing duck.  For $18.50, this dish included \\"tender Long Island duck marinated and expertly roasted to achieve moist meat yet with crispy skin.\\"  It was also served with pancakes, scallions and cucumbers.  Our waitress made the duck wraps for us, one each per our request.  These were good, but I was so full by the time I ate my wrap that I wasn't able to enjoy it as much as I should have...\\n\\nWith very full stomachs, we had to wrap almost half our meal to take home.  Now, I'm usually sketched out about leftover sushi, but it was so good that I wanted to give it a chance (especially since I knew that I would crave more the next day).  Our waitress was so nice in packing up all the food; she also included all the fixings for our duck wraps.  The bill certainly racked up, but I expect to pay a good amount of money whenever I'm eating sushi.  It was definitely worth it, and I hope to return again to try more maki rolls. \\n\\nFor my \\"Sushi\\" list: 4 stars\\n\\n\\nP.S. The sushi was fantastic the next day.  She had even packed up the extra ginger I had requested.  :)  Also, the Fire maki was actually less intense after being refridgerated, but it was still yummy.

And obviously they know how to do treats right!  Lunch on the other hand, not so much.  The staff just seemed annoyed and aloof.  The lunch menu, which is normally a few choices of paninis, wraps and salads was down to about 50% of their normal offerings as they'd written \\"we're out\\" next to 1/2 of the selections.  I wanted the roast beef panini, but it comes with whole grain mustard, and I've tried it before but it was loaded with mustard and just too spicy, so I asked if they could sub the mustard for mayo.  No dice, as the cashier told me that the sandwiches are pre-made.  Pre-made for $7.95?! Ugh.  So being hungry and not wanting to move our cars from our paid metered parking spots, we ordered anyway.  I got the chicken panini with spinach and pink peppercorn mayo and my friend ordered the turkey panini.  The sandwiches came out about 10 minutes apart, despite having ordered them together.  My bread was dried out and the mayo had soaked and dried into the bread (from sitting for what was probably days?!) so the whole thing was just dry.  There were a few pieces of sliced chicken breast that was also so dry it was almost inedible.  There was also just a few small pieces of sauteed spinach on it.  It was, in a word, AWFUL, and my friend's wasn't any better.  \\n\\nI can't believe I paid $10 for a pre-made dried out, roughly thrown together and over-cooked crappy sandwich and limonata.  Waste of money, waste of good food, waste of time.

The food here has been consistently good:\\n\\nShrimp Tacos - At $4 each these tacos were good but only contained 2 baby shrimp in each, save your cash on this one.\\n\\nKobe Sliders - How do I verify that something in Kobe anyway? First thing I noticed was the quality of the mini buns they used. Otherwise an above average slider.\\n\\nFried Oysters - It was good and exactly how it sounds. The size of them were good too.\\n\\nMac 'n Cheese - This was a highlight. As a standard it is actually includes truffle (salt or oil?). Don't be fooled the mushrooms in the dish are most likely potbelly, I really liked the shape of the pasta too, They were ruffle square shapes, if nothing else I felt it held the cheese better. \\n\\nBanana Toffee Cup - The combination of bananas in a toffee pudding topped with whipped cream and a graham cracker crust was perfect."},{"name":"Bangkok Bistro","address":"433 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Stumbled upon this gem randomly - had the green curry and basil chicken, so delicious and SO HEALTHY!

The server was lively and quick, but the whole experience left something to be desired.  A cash-only sign and cracked vinyl booth seats were the first things that set the tone for a less than stellar experience.  We've eaten at a few other Southern food restaurants in the Atlanta area, and they had more interesting ambiance (Eats is still my favorite) and offered a better dinner menu.  I will say this: the restaurant was interesting--all beautiful wood paneling, and it was fun to try to guess all the celebrities in the photos.\\n\\nBut here's the bad part, and I write this honestly so don't send me nasty messages, please.\\n\\nThe jerk chicken egg rolls sounded good, but the three rolls were tiny and not flavorful.  I had the Brown Sugar Salmon and a side of squash casserole, and while the salmon was tasty, it was expensive compared to other entrees.  I'm not sure what made the yellow squash a casserole (it wasn't baked with other noticeable ingredients), but it was salty and--I hate to write this--boring.\\n\\nAnd then there's the neighborhood.  During the day, it's in a nice area within spitting distance of downtown.  At night, this stretch of Peachtree St. becomes a little scary.  The restaurant is dimly-lit without anything interesting nearby.  A storefront business and a large Queen Anne style house next door are boarded up.  I don't know if seeing homeless and scary folks strolling around the sidewalks is normal late evenings, but this is not the kind of area I want to visit again...ever.  There's a normal amount of urban flavor I expect, and it can be sorta fun.

They used milk sourced from a farm in the Berkshires, and coffee sources from three farms in Ethiopia and Uganda. You can really taste the quality and attention to detail. The pour over was a testament to this - it's a simpler drink that benefits so much from the ridiculously good beans. Beyond the coffee itself, which is reason enough to visit, the atmosphere is relaxed and cool with a big glass wall through which you can see rock climbers in the Brooklyn Boulders gym - like a cathedral of colors, interesting angles, and good health.

The woman wanted to make clear that it was a vegetarian burrito and not a chicken one like I had ordered.  After asking a few people, the woman managing the line confirmed that it was.\\n\\nSo, my question now was \\"Where is *my* burrito?\\"  It was nowhere to be found.  The woman working the end of the line had a bit of a panic as she wondered where my meal was.\\n\\nAll of this just seemed to be general frustrations but this is what really irritated me.  All of a sudden the guy working the cash register pointed at me and said \\"You owe me $10 right now.\\"  I was a little taken aback.  It wasn't the normal customer service exchange I was used to but instead a direct and rude one.\\n\\nI replied by saying that I wasn't going to pay until I actually got my meal (which, incidentally, they had not located yet.)  The woman who had her order confused with mine said \\"I would advise you not to give them any money until they can actually find your meal.\\"\\n\\nThe man working the checkout just waved his hand and pointed at someone in the line and said \\"That's yours over there.  Now, give me the money.\\"  Frankly, I was really taken aback by all of this and contemplated just walking out right then.  At this precise moment, though, someone came from the back (not in the line and no meal that had been referenced as of yet) carrying a burrito all ready and packaged to go saying that it was mine.\\n\\nThe woman working the end of the line apologized to me.  I went to check out.  The guy working the check-out sneered at me and didn't say a word as I paid.\\n\\nI went and sat down to eat my meal.  By this time my focus just was to get out of there.  I didn't really enjoy my burrito.  I was more thinking how I didn't really want to give Chipotle (in Harvard Square, at least) a second chance as a paying customer.\\n\\nI hope this branch is able to settle down and get organized.  As a result spots to work should become a bit more competitive and they should be able to upgrade the quality of their staff and service.  I am sure that I'm not the only one to have this poor impression.

If it wasn't for the A-Frame sign inciting us around the corner of a building, we would have missed it completely.\\n\\nThe inside of Thai Grille is small with a casual elegance - the greens on the wall and the wooden floors and tables produced a calming effect. The dining room can't hold more than 40 people and taking a seat near the window made us feel as if we were dining in someone's house. At the far end is an open bar area where you can see into the kitchen - and also the waitress making me a delicious Thai Iced Coffee.\\n\\nThis is the iced coffee to end all other iced coffees. Served in a tall thin pilsner-like glass - this coffee is strong and slightly sweetened. It's topped with condensed sweet milk that sits on top - really making this drink look like a dark beer. It was delicious! And they serve Thai Iced Tea in the same style. My date ordered a homemade Ginger Ale. The price on this drink is pretty steep and not something I would order every time - but was really tasty.\\n\\nSo what sets Thai Grille apart from all other Thai places in Columbus? First, from what we spotted it was the only remotely ethnic place to eat in that little slice of Uptown Westerville. Kudos for trying and succeeding in the WASPHQ. Second, Thai Grille boasts using local ingredients whenever possible.\\n\\nI ordered the Pad Thai and was pleased with the amount of food received for the price paid. The quality of the noodles and chicken was satisfactory. The Pad Thai loses a star for not hitting some personal points. The sauce was too thick for my taste and it was too sweet. I ordered my dish \\"regular spicy\\" after being scoffed when I said \\"really spicy\\". The heat wasn't enough to balance out the overly sweet taste and halfway through the dish my mouth became sticky.\\n\\nThe service at Thai Grille was excellent and I was happy to see the dining room full of the After Church crowd. My first impression is that Thai Grille is a nice place to enjoy lunch on a private date with a friend. On the rare instances that I am in Uptown Westerville - I will have to make a point to return to Thai Grille and try another dish."},{"name":"Chai Thai Cuisine","address":"2447 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"There are much better Thai food options out there.

OMG- Stop with the drama!  The parking lot is small and kinda sucks manuevering around it and it's off of a main street so if you try to come here between 5-6 PM on Mon-Fri, it's a little tough navigating through the traffic but..... DA MEAT FALLS OF DA BONE!!  So put on your big girl panties and make the damned drive!\\n\\nFOOD:\\nApps:\\nOK- Floramos could definitely re-invent here. Apps are run of the mill variety. Not outstanding but consistent and value priced. The Bruschetta is the BEST deal at 2.95!! Delicious. I have not seen bone in buffalo wings on the menu but maybe I missed it. Would like to see that added along with some type of eggplant rollatini.\\n\\nSalad:\\nVery standard but the house dressing?? ROCKS!!\\nChicken Soup:\\nFresh- Homemade- Big chunks of chicken. Rough cut carrots and celery. You know it's not from a can. Broth is falvorful and the soup is a GREAT alternative to salad. (The plentiful grated cheese adds a salty nuttiness)\\n\\nBaby Back Ribs are generally my staple. HUGE Fred Flintstone portion, just the right amont of sauce. You can pull the bones out and the price?? 14.95. Best Deal Around! \\nThe angel hair pasta is so thin, you could floss with it. The tomato sauce tastes fresh and robust. But last night I got the steak tips and sausage side (HUGE BBQ Sausage for 3.00- OUTSTANDING) I do not care who says the Newbridge has the best tips. You are WRONG. Floramo's tips are tender, juicy, HUGE and the marinade is something that legends are made of. Can not beat the price. 11.95 for 5 HUGE tips that can serve as tonight's dinner and tomorrow's lunch. The mashed potatos seem to be instant.. A little disappointing but ask for garlic butter and they perk right up.  I have heard the fries are good but I have not had them myself so don't quote me!\\n\\nIf you prefer a vegetarian fare, they have macaroni dishes, eggplant dishes, fresh salads and several vegetarian apps like the artichoke hearts with cheese and mushrooms or the aforementioned bruschetta but lets face it, you go here for the MEAT!\\n\\nService:\\nHere is where the rubber meets the road. I have had some of mediocre service here and at one point after a very very disappointing birthday dinner, I was giving them one last chance and that's when we met Yvette. You can not go wrong with this waitress. She's an Eastie girl and she does not pull any punches. She tells it like it is. Fast, Efficient, Pleasant, Down to Earth and ACCURATE. If you become a regular she'll know you like extra sauce on your pasta and your tips medium. She's a treasure. Another outstanding waiter is Denis. I would reccommend you ask for either one and you will not be disappointed.   \\nThe spotty service is what knocks this rating from 5 down to 4 stars.  :(\\n\\nValue:\\nWe ordered:\\n2 raspberry iced teas, 2 chicken soups, 1 order of bruschetta, 2 orders of steak tips. 1 with angel hair and 1 with mashed potatos. 1 side of BBQ sausage.

Pretty funny but in all honesty, I had a \\"bucket list\\" of places I wanted to go and specific things I wanted to eat while I was there because it is just that bad in FL and makes you appreciate and miss the kind of cooking MA has haha. Steak Tips was on that list and Floramo's has the best around. So after making my review a year ago, living in FL, then coming home to visit and going to Floramo's, I noticed something different.....the salad. HAHAHA. I started dying laughing in my seat. They changed the look and quality of it and I was so pumped! Looks more \\"green\\" and better quality. GREAT JOB GUYS! I have always been a fan of Floramo's since I was a young boy and my family loves it there too. My go to's are the steak tips, ribs, chicken parm, and chicken marsala. All fantastic. No complaints what so ever...it was just the salad haha and now that has changed, my review goes from a 4-star to a 5-star.

I am a huge fan of pulled pork and potato salad, so that's what I ordered. It was about as plain as it gets. They cook the pork crock-pot style -- not smoked -- and shred it with sauce included. The experience is very ketchup-y and sandwiched between the standard white roll. The potato salad is very bland and has eggs in it. If I'd wanted egg salad, I would have ordered it.\\n\\nI halfheartedly think I should go back and try the ribs, since they had the audacity to put them in the name of the business, but something about ribs for lunch just doesn't excite me.

He loved that and that was a nice touch, two servers for this many people I thought were too much for them they shouldve had one or two more to even just to check on us.

She tried her best, I had gotten the burger named after my nephew because he wanted me too but I really wanted the lamb burger lol. My burger was just a burger it was a cheese burger the the cheese looked like packaged cheese and just plopped on top of the burger. Now the lamb burger that I saw a lot of people ordered looked amazing and everyone loved. The appetizer that were ordered for the table was the chips which were sweet potatoes not sure how they were supposed to be but they came out in crumbs and too greasy for me. Next was the truffle mushroom flatbread now that was OMG. This was worth writing home to mom for. I could've eaten the whole thing but I had to share lol. Next was the calamari which I only got to try 2 pieces because the kids ate it up which surprised me so I guess that was good. I did see the manager walking around and clearing off tables.

I wish I could have waited to see who Sanjah picked in her love triangle. \\n\\nThis place, as another Yelper noted, was a ghost town.  We stepped into Lahore Grill and I swore I heard the rustling of tumbleweeds in the air. There was nobody in there but my husband and I and the proprietors. In fact the man at the counter actually looked shocked that he had customers. I don't know why I didn't take that as some sort of sign. I guess the heat stroke and low blood sugar I was experiencing, combined with the quest for samosas and chicken tiki masala, made me hesitant to turn back. \\n\\nSo, we step up to the counter and place our order of two chicken tiki masala and I notice that the chicken tiki masala does not come with rice and naan. This should have been the other clue that Lahore Grill was not the place to be, but again my mind was hazy and my stomach was on greedy. I mean isn't it like a law that all entrees at Indian restaurants come with rice and naan included?! Or is that just my understanding? *shrug* \\n\\nWe placed our orders for samosas, chicken tiki masala, garlic naan, and plain rice and were directed to seat ourselves. Now one thing I can say is that the Lahore Grill does not push out food straight from the kitchen, there was a bit of a wait that had me thinking the food might actually be delicious. Wrong again. The samosas came out first and they were as dry as all get out. Seriously samosas are like the one thing I have never had wrong at any Indian restaurant. Guess there is a first for everything. Then to top it off the chutney and the mint sauce was all creamy. Ugh. \\n\\nAfter the samasos were done the rest of the food was placed on the table and surprise, the garlic nann and chicken was dry too. Wait, excuse me all 6 small pieces of bonelss chicken was dry. Yes, I counted. For $6.99 I should have had more than that. \\n\\nIn general, the food was meh. Although spicy, there was no real flavor to the food. It just was blah.

I got the veggie omelet with rye toast and home fries.  My husband got the New England plate - which was french toast, scrambled eggs w/ bacon.  They give very generous portions.  The home fries were fried and tasted like seasoned french fries but they were good.  I liked my omelet.  I am very particular with how my omelet is made and although it wasn't made the way I would have loved it, it was still delicious, it had a lot of vegetables (onion, mushroom, and green peppers) and american cheese.  I only ate half of it as I normally don't finish whole omelets.  \\n\\nThe thing that I am particular about on how they are made is the egg. I don't like the egg to be too fluffy, I like it when the egg part is almost crepe thin and then have the veggie/cheese mixture inside the omelet.

Usually breakfast joints have bitter coffee but Newcomb's coffee was very good and I even asked for a second refill which I never do at most breakfast joints.  I would come here again.

I cannot say the same about Pepe's manager...\\n\\nOne Sunday evening the manager, his girlfriend and girlfriend's friend monopolized the whole bar top w/their purses in the bar chairs. Parts of the bar top were cluttered w/dirty dishes that the staff seemed to not be able to keep up w/. The bar top seats that were open w/a clean bar top were taken by the manager (who was sitting down while his staff was clearly overwhelmed), manager's girlfriend, friend, and each of their purses. When we tried to approach them to politely ask them to move their purses they glared at us w/such looks of disdain we decided to sit at a bar side table. I'm also not sure why the women were running around the restaurant in their pedicure shoes? As we waited to be served we noticed the manager finally moved from sitting at the bar to a side table where he proceeded to text on his phone while his staff struggled to keep up w/customers and dirty dishes. I think there were only two servers working. The manager should have been helping his staff, not texting away in a corner. \\n\\nOverall I would recommend the Winter Park location over the downtown location. I continue to go to the Church Street location for their location, happy hour, professional bartenders, good food and drinks. My experience with the manager, his girl friends and their purses put me off from recommending Church Street's Pepe's Cantina outside of happy hour. If I'm going to pay more for drinks and food I want a more professional manager who isn't sitting at the bar and/or texting while he's understaffed. There are too many other good places in downtown to frequent w/better service managers."},{"name":"Is'Original","address":"1671 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I think I found another great Thai restaurant. This time, it's in one of the nicest and quietest communities in this state, which is Brookline. It was recommended by a friend who went to the same school as me, and he told me that it's almost as good as Nud Pob, which was a Thai restaurant I frequently went when I was a student. I have been to this place twice, and left fairly happy. \\n\\nI got the Indonesian Fried Rice (even though it's not really a Thai dish), mainly because I have not had it for a really long time. I thought it was probably one of the best fried rice dishes I got since eating at Nud Pob. The fried egg was pretty good, despite the small size. The fried chicken was really crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. The fried rice itself was tasty, and had a good amount of spice thanks to the peppers. One dish should fill up your stomach pretty good and would make a really hearty dinner. \\n\\nI also had the pork and shrimp Pad Thai, and I also thought it was really good. They don't give much shrimp, and the pork was a little dry, but I loved the peanut flavor of the noodles, and crisp bean sprouts. One dish should make a pretty good light meal. \\n\\nThe interior is pretty good. There are some really comfortable sofas and chairs you can sit on while eating, as if you are eating in a living room. Another advantage is the free water and tea, if you do not want to spend money on drinks. One disadvantage is the effectiveness of service. You may have to wait at least ten minutes for your dish. \\n\\nOverall, this is another great, tasty and inexpensive Thai restaurant and I definitely would not mind coming back to this place again for decent Pad Thai or a hearty Indonesian Fried Rice dish. Be sure to have a good amount of cash ready, since they do not take credit cards."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is the epitome of what constitutes a good meal and dinning experience in my book. \\n\\nFriendly service, good atmosphere, and delicious food.....check. check, and check.

I don't often go anywhere else. You can tell it had great food when Asian families are lining up to eat in the relatively tiny space. If you go to NGG, please don't order crab rangoons or pork fried rice; it's such a waste. Go for the seafood dishes - everything pretty much delicious. Salted calamari or pork are some of my favorites - ask for it extra spicy and extra jalape√±os. The pepper steak is always a winner. The seafood stew/soup is also great. This is also one of the few places in Chinatown that don't cheat you out of pieces of lobster when you order their twin lobster special.

The serving sizes of them are small on the menu, like 3 steak tips with grilled shrimp for $11.95. Those 3 steak tips are huge! The prices in this place are smart. A full rack of fall of the bone ribs for $14.95 and that includes huge sides. Drinks were poured stiff for around $5 each. The fresh bread and butter before the meal quelled my hunger. Even the side salad that comes with every entree wasn't bad. The creamy Italian dressing was the way to go.

It's absurdly over-priced, and (during the day) there are significantly better places to go for the same kind of food.  The waffles in particular should be better -- they're barely a step above Eggo, and they have the same general flavor and texture as pancakes from McDonald's.\\n\\nService usually has very little effect on my visit to a restaurant.  As long as the staff maintain a basic level of service, my experience is 95% based on the quality of the food.\\n\\nGladys Knight's is an exception.  The service is uniformly awful.  I went a week ago with a fairly large group and, less than 3 minutes after paying our bill, we were rudely asked to leave to make room for other guests -- even while we were already getting up and putting on our coats!\\n\\nThat day I decided I would never go back.  Unfortunately, last night I was the DD for a bunch of Gladys Knight virgins, and they coaxed me into returning.  We got to the restaurant pretty late, so there were tons of tables and booths open.  The hostess told us the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes.  I asked her if we could sit at one of the many open tables with full place settings.  She told us to move out of the way and that she would have to get a table ready for us.  We waited for another 10 minutes!\\n\\nOur server, as usual, was curt, impatient, and unfriendly.  He brought out one person's food 20 minutes after the rest of us were served without even apologizing.  I had waited for her food before starting, which meant my food was cold.\\n\\nAll in all, even if I left full, the experience has been disappointing and unpleasant.  Gladys Knight is the only restaurant in Atlanta where I feel unwelcome.

Many people seem to expect so much \\"more\\" than I find rational for a bar or restaurant. People want the owner(s) to share their political views, ideals of what the \\"most authentic\\" blah blah is based on their travels the summer between high school and college, etc. \\n\\nI'm going to avoid all that, save to assure you that I actually do not necessarily share certain views and opinions as the owner... but guess what? That literally has NOTHING to do with an honest sharing of opinions on a website like Yelp. What's important is the execution of the product that the establishment produces. \\n\\nThat said, my honest, un-biased opinion (despite political differences, etc) is that Tanuki turns out INSANELY tasty food that happens to be gorgeously presented. Especially for a bar! I've been to Tanuki a couple dozen times, and at least 90% of the time I've ended up there, the night started with \\"I want GIANT BEER!\\" (my partner's name for the freaking LITER of Asahi - cold and affordable). We go there, chill in front of the ac at the counter, chat up the AMAZINGLY genuine and kind and informative waitress, and next thing we know we've asked for food to be sent out to soak up some giant beer, some sake drinks, drinking vinegars, etc. Next thing I know, I'm licking my fingers in disbelief of the depth of flavor I'm experiencing. Or the simplicity of the freshest hamachi in town (period). \\nAfter begging to STOP sending out food, we pay a ludicrously low tab (rarely over $20 each including bar tab). \\n\\nThis place is such a jewel in PDX! As for complaints about parking - someone even said there should be a VALET! Jokingly I assume ;-) - all I can think is, have you ever been to a real city? Ever dined in NY or San Fran? Or let's keep it local... Beaker and Flash? 23 Hoyt (same 'hood)? Tabla? Noble Rot? Prost!? The list goes on. NO PARKING LOTS. That's for the suburbs! Street parking is a thing of Portland. And it's surprisingly easy and efficient (and FREE at Tanuki!) compared to real (larger) cities. I've never had to park further than by the near-by Fred Meyer area. The walk is as much as 3 minutes and is WELCOME after eating my face off for a pittance at the most interesting eating bar in town. \\n\\nBest advice to the easily annoyed: 1. Read the rules before showing up and complaining about seating issues, parking issue, children issues.  2. Don't follow their twits if you don't want to. It's that easy. Hell, I eat junk food in the bar at Saylor's Country Kitchen, and I feel my soul will burst into flames every time I walk in and pass the pic of Mr. and Mrs. Saylor posing with George Bush Senior. I eat at Tom's Pancake House in Beaverton where the menus have a xian fish on the cover,  the book display is all hyper conservative Xian, and I am CLEARLY and OBVIOUSLY seated with any Blacks or Latins that may be there (rare) in the front overflow room beside the bathroom doors for being obviously gay. But you know what? Their old-school American Breakfast is good, and they have Beaverton Bakery's Banana Cream Pie for dessert. \\n\\nI'm literally stunned speechless at the idea that someone would expect the owners or chef or waitstaff to share their beliefs and convictions in order to call the food good. Amazing....\\nIt's like putting sports figures or famous musicians in a role of \\"leadership\\" for kids. Then holding them guilty when they come up rapist druggies. Shame on them! Don't they know kids look up to them?    How did this phenomenon ever come to be? America can be so retarded. Well, Americans I mean.....\\n\\nJust eat the food and drink the drink..... or don't.

Now I have been here before a few years ago and let me tell you, they make one kick ass maple old fashioned. Literally I wanted to come back just for the drink. I also remembered that the bone marrow appetizer really stuck out as well. Giant bone sliced in half , bone-marrow roasted served with bread. Yes i know what it sounds like but trust me you wont be disappointed by anything here.  We also had the charcuterie plate with several cheeses, meats, pate, duck. It was a little fancier than your run of the mill boards but everything was amazing. One of the chefs specials that night just happened to be a cheeseburger and while I typically don't like getting cheeseburgers from very good establishments like this one because I feel theres so much other yummy stuff I could try off the menu than a burger.      \\n\\nHowever, I let my friend play devils advocate and choose my meal and of course she went with the burger. I wasn't disappointed though, had to be arguably one of the juiciest tastiest burgers I ever had. And the fries were yummy.\\n\\nWe were lucky enough to get a private table in a room in the back for our party which was very nice. Its a small restaurant but the atmosphere and the ambiance is very charming. Very intimate  atmosphere. Not  a place you would come for drinks after work nor does there seem to be a bar here.

So, I was excited to finally give it a try. \\n\\nWhen I entered the lobby, I was immediately greeted by Jenny, with a friendly smile and a sincere \\"welcome\\". Jenny took the time to show us around the restaurant, and allowed us to view the private dining rooms, which are needless to say, beautiful.  If fact, the entire restaurant is modern, yet elegant in its own way. \\n\\nSeneca, our waiter was pleasant and presented us with both the standard lunch menu as well as the brunch menu; and thoroughly answered all of our questions. He also informed us about the brunch drink options, which we chose to take advantage of. Shula's 347 Grill has a Bloody Mary & Mimosa bar, which allows the guest to create their own bloody or mimosa with the assistance of a bartender for a very affordable price. The bar featured a selection of fresh juices, and fruit to add to your creation. I decided to create a blood orange mimosa, which was pretty good. Paul, the bartender was eager to help and offer suggestions in order to create the perfect beverage. \\n\\nThis leads us up to the most important part of the experience, the food! I chose to order the Chicken and Waffles. Shula's 347 Grill builds upon the traditional concept of chicken and waffles and adds their own twist. The fried chicken legs, pumpkin spice Belgian waffle, cinnamon maple pecan butter and Georgia peach compote go well together. The waffle was made fresh to order, the chicken cooked as it should be (crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside), the cinnamon maple pecan butter, although a bit heavy on the cinnamon was tasty (though the heat from the chicken and waffles caused some of the butter to melt prior to serving), the Georgia peach compote was interesting. The sweet yet tangy nature of the compote complimented the chicken well, though the peaches were a bit over cooked for my taste. \\n\\nOverall, I had an exceptional dining experience at Shula's 347 Grill. The service was well above par, the food great given the price, and the environment clean and welcoming. If you're looking for an affordable place to enjoy a nice brunch, defiantly consider this gem, which by the way is located beautiful Lake Mary Westin."},{"name":"Tacos La Villa","address":"2415 Cobb Pkwy SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4.5","text":"If I'm in the mood for traditional tacos, I split between Mi Taco (closer and have homemade corn tortillas) and La Villa (cheaper and faster).

I've had the same chef the last few times and he's always lovely.

Eschew your \\"eating healthy\\" urges and get the biscuit made with white flour, the whole wheat version isn't as good.  If I am extra hungry or giving ordering advice, they also have some scrambles and omelettes involving collard greens that are quite yummy too.\\n\\nHowever, the above info is standard for pretty much every Flying Biscuit.

I think when small 'hole in the wall' places move to bigger, more extravagant locations, something about their small-time, good-eats, feel changes. You know, an ode to the old saying \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" should really apply to good little Tex-Mex establishments. \\n\\nBut let's get to the heart of the matter...the food. Their 'crispy tacos' are the bomb. Home-made 'puffy' corn tortillas and always perfectly seasoned beef make these my all time favorite on their menu. I've had enchiladas, fajitas, flautas, nachos, queso and of course the trusty rice and beans and while everything is pretty good - I always go back to the Crispy Tacos.  I have never had anything that I was disappointed or unsatisfied with so all in all, it's a great place for some good food and good times.  The staff is always friendly and the service is always quick (even during rush/busy times).\\n \\nI will say that since moving to the new location, it is SUPER LOUD. And the birthday singing (which I believe is a new thing) echo's to the point of obnoxiousness. I'm all about the birthdays and celebrating but for some reason (not sure if it's the layout or insulation) the singing becomes almost deafening. Those are the times I pray I was back at their smaller, quieter location. In addition, you would think this new location would offer better, more, easily accessible parking - but it doesn't. Amaya's shares a parking lot with a hotel/motel so at times it's difficult to find a spot. Oh and I think they started skimping on the cheese in the cheese enchiladas since the move. They are still yummy, but before they oozed with cheesy goodness.

I ate here with him and a couple other friends just before the restaurant (temporarily?) closed several days ago.  According to their Facebook page, they still do catering.  So with that said, here's my review, in memoriam.\\n\\nBoners BBQ is located one giant parking lot away from Turner Field.  It's odd location doesn't really make it a popular BBQ destination outside of Braves games.  At least that was my experience.  When a Braves game isn't going on, the immediate surrounding area looks dead and deserted.\\n\\nThe restaurant is set up inside of what looks like an old house.  There's a big rooftop deck with views of Turner Field and the adjacent parking lots.  The inside of the restaurant is... interesting.  One wall is plastered with nothing but pin-up art.  There's also full size street signs and a full size traffic light.  T-shirts for sale bear slogans that say, \\"Escort Quality, Hooker Pricing\\" and \\"BBQ with Balls.\\"  The chair seats are upholstered in the rear ends of presumably used ladies' jean shorts.\\n\\nThe menu is a one-pager that includes entrees and sides.  Boners offers all the typical BBQ fare such as beef brisket, chicken, pulled pork, ribs, rib tips, and wings.  Sides include dishes such as baked beans, mac and cheese, collard greens, and potato salad.  They do put a twist on things.  An example is their \\"Buford Highway Bruswick Stew,\\" which is a more exotic take on Brunswick Stew that uses a lime-chicken broth and adds hominy and other spices.  Most entrees are under $10 and most sides are under $5.\\n\\nAt Southern BBQ restaurants, I like to get pulled pork and noticed at Boners, you can only get pulled pork during lunch (Wed-Fri until 3pm).  So I ended up going with the \\"Sloppy Hoe,\\" which is like a pulled pork sandwich.  If they offer a pulled pork sandwich at dinner, why can't they offer a plate of pulled pork too?\\n\\nThe Sloppy Hoe was tasty and at $6, also a good deal.  It was made with pulled pork, jalapeno relish, and dill pickles in between two yellow cornmeal pancakes made with whole corn & jalapeno.  It was rather messy to eat as the corn cakes fell apart easily and there was also BBQ sauce and relish to deal with.  I ate mine with a fork instead.  I thought the pulled pork was savory and appetizingly smoky.\\n\\nI also tried the Baby Back Ribs (1/4 rack, $7).  They were out of Spare Ribs for the day, so we had to settle on Baby Back.  Spare Ribs are leaner and less fatty than Baby Back.  The ribs were good.  As advertised on the menu, they were falling off the bone.  The dry rub used was unique.  It had both a spiciness to it and was aromatic.  Hard to describe.  I have no idea what ingredients were used to prepare it.\\n\\nSides I tried included:\\nFried Collards (schwag) - deep-fried collard green chips with rosemary salt\\nTater Salad - classic mustard-based potato salad\\nS'Mac N Cheese - smoked gouda, provolone, and cheddar cheese over sea shell pasta\\n\\nThe Fried Collards were something else.  I highly recommend ordering them.  If you've ever had fried kale chips, this is very similar, except they're freshly cooked and hot and crispy.  Everyone at the table enjoyed them.  While I really liked the fried collards, I could only eat so much.  They were very oily and I got sick of them after a short while.\\n\\nThe Tater Salad was pretty standard.  It didn't really stand out to me.  The S'Mac N Cheese was pretty tasty, though it came out cold and the cheese was quite thick and a little bit hardened.  Still, it was delicious enough to where I finished the entire bowl.\\n\\nService was outstanding.  I wish I'd gotten our server's name so I could mention him here.  He did a great job: attentive, kind, and helpful.  Also, separated checks without a problem.\\n\\nIn the end, Boners is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars for me.  Great service and pretty good BBQ, but the eerily empty/abandoned atmosphere and strange location threw me off a bit."},{"name":"Eastside Asian Market","address":"12950 E Colonial Dr, Ste 106","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"After coming here for several months for my tea, I have finally made time to try the food they began offering a while back. I usually keep a well stocked pantry but they have a decent selection of grocery items to choose from. The prices are not as good as the big markets on west Colonial or Pine Hills BUT the time and gas saved more than makes up for it with its convenience for the items they DO offer that I need. \\n\\nBeing Caucasian, I have at times been treated differently and even talked down to at several of the various ethnic markets. Most tend to just judge me on my appearance and assume I do not understand the cuisine or ingredients used in it. The staff has NEVER been anything less than friendly and helpful when I have interacted with them. They have taken time to explain things when I have asked questions and it is why I keep coming back. The Jasmine tea they recommended to me is now one of my favorites along with the Lychee tea. \\n\\nI have seen the reviews and the food and have said many times I was going to grab a bite to eat the next time I am there. Well today I feasted on the Spicy Ramen and an order of Spring Rolls. Everything was made fresh right in front of me since I could see into the kitchen area. Since I love to cook, I was thrilled to have a chance to see everything being made.\\n\\nI could go into great detail on how good that bowl of Ramen was but you really need to try it for yourself. I never looked closely at the menu to start and when I did, I realized I was eating a vegetarian Ramen and really enjoying it. If you were blindfolded, you would be hard pressed to know you were not having a Ramen with Beef. I had to force myself not to grab the bowl and start drinking the broth after eating everything else. I just wanted to take my time savoring the rich flavor. The spring rolls was nice and crisp and the contents has a nice flavor that when dipped in the sauce provided was a perfect match. I had a bottle of unsweetened tea that I found in the drink case to go with my lunch.\\n\\nLet me be clear, they are an Asian Market that just happens to offer a limited menu of vegetarian items. I have now had two of the items and am now looking forward to working my way through the other items offered on their menu. I had a chance to talk at length with the chef and suggested that he offer classes in Asian cooking to the customers that want to learn more about making Asian cuisine. \\n\\nMarket \\nPrices - 4\\nVariety - 4\\nConvenience - 5\\nProduct knowledge - 5\\n\\nCafe\\nView of kitchen - 5\\nFreshness of ingredients - 5\\nSpring rolls - 5\\nDipping sauce - 5\\nSpicy Bowl of Ramen - 5\\n\\nMy ONLY complaint is with ME for not trying the food sooner.

Well, we did.  Biggest mistake was probably showing up at high noon on a friday.  We waited (no exaggeration) 1.5 hrs to get served.  What I don't quite understand is why does it take so long to serve meat that's already been BBQ'd? If you are lining up outside at the end of the patio - expect a 1.5 hrs wait because that's where we started.  You can go grab a beer from a separate line inside while you wait if that'll help you pass the time.  We were in a group of 6 so we took turns sending people in to go get beer. Haha.\\n\\nAnyways - on to the meat - I got 1/2 pound of brisket and a beef rib.  The beef rib market price for the day was $20/lb.  If you've never had one, I suggest you try it.  If you don't have a huge appetite - share with a friend.  It's pretty massive.  The meat was definitely fall off the bone tender and had just the right amount of smokey flavor to it.  The brisket was also super tender and what I'd expect from a place like this.  There's two different sauces you can try that are on the table\\n\\nMy thoughts - is this place worth waiting 1.5 hrs?

I was there during lunch time and there were only 3 other tables been server. I could notice everyone so upset for having to wait so long for their meat. If you never went to a Brazilian steak house before like Fogo de Chao, Porcao...they usually have 10-15 guys running around serving you 10-15 types of meats/flavors until you can't take it anymore. The server barely showed up, the meat was OVER salty, the side dishes on the buffet line was OLD and greasy. The meat was so under cooked too, and when it wasn't under cooked it was over cooked lol. \\nIt is a shame. I used to love this place. Now I understand why there are lots of bad reviews.

My favorite meal to order here is the \\"Copley Square\\" black bean burger: it's one of my favorite black bean burgers I've ever tried, and I've tried quite a lot. One item you can't pass up is the vegan milkshake- although the coconut milk used to substitute regular milk is okay, I wish they had opted for either soy or coconut milk. The coconut flavor seemed to detract from my coffee milkshake. Wait until you try the deserts- incredible. I personally got the chocolate cherry cheesecake, which was phenomenal and -bonus- used locally sourced chocolate.\\nThe restaurant is also very gluten-friendly, and there is a full alternative menu full of gluten-free options.

I came to try their pancakes and i was satisfied so i'll give it a 4 but they should work on their overall management."},{"name":"HunnyMilk","address":"40 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Overall really liked this place! \\n\\nWe had to wait quite a bit to be seated and for our food, but the staff ensured that we, along with other customers waiting, were being treated well and made it known that they didn't forget about us. \\n\\nWhen waiting to be seated, a waiter brought out mini pancakes with a blueberry sauce and blueberry on top, sprinkled with powdered sugar. It was super cute, but more importantly, very tasty--a perfect little bite to get our pallets excited. \\n\\nWhen waiting for our food, they brought us THE most amazing biscuits! I think they might be the best I've ever had. It came with honey butter and strawberry jelly. Biscuits tasted fresh and were warm, nice and buttery, mmm so good. \\n\\nFor my drink I had a chai tea, and my boy friend had the mango juice. Both were good. Milk, sugar, honey, etc are self serve. \\n\\nTo eat for our sweet option,  I had the French toast and my boy friend had the waffles... and for savory we both orders the eggs surprise. The French toast was delicious--loved the crispy outside and the lemon curd was amazing. Perfect combo, and surprisingly not as heavy as I thought it would be.  The eggs surprise was also very tasty. I loved the truffled hollandaise sauce!!! I wish I could put some in a container and take some home! The veggies were cooked well, however my only critique is that they use different potatoes--Yukon golds would have worked perfectly. I found my potatoes to be a little stale-- the outside was chewy and they were a little dry inside (if that makes sense). Other then that, it was a perfect brunch spot.

The fried chicken was perfectly crispy, and generously came with two pieces and a small biscuit. I also really liked the Brussels sprouts, which are prepared as individual leaves, making it quite crispy. I think for the portion the price was a little high, though. The eggplant fries were also prepared well. The tacos come as one per order but they are actually quite sizable. Finally, we got the blood orange sherbet that was served with four generous scoops.

Have been there twice...once on the day it opened and again last week. On opening day a bearded man taking names at the counter was pretty gleeful in telling me it would be a 45 minute wait. Now, that's just annoying. At least try to realize that to most folks that's not happy news. A little respect for the customer, please. In fact, I think respect for the customer is what's really lacking there. Because the second time we went there it was mid-afternoon and we were one of two tables...the other being a table of employees...and our experience was worse. Super disappointed that the dairy-free/vegan oatmeal pancakes listed on the online menu were not really offered. But my friend ordered ancient grain pancakes and I ordered bacon, a fruit cup and scrambled eggs, specifically asking for no dairy. Well, the bacon and a fruit came out early and alone. Then the pancakes came out 6-7 min. later with watery, undercooked eggs. I sent those back. The fruit cup had a little honey on it and it was good. After my friend had eaten most of his pancakes (which he said were good, but...like the coffee...they were nothing he'd come back to get), my eggs came out looking just a little less soupy than 10 minutes earlier and with a texture like they had been made with milk. I left half of them. I was given 3 more pieces of bacon as a consolation gift (who really needs to eat 6 pieces at one meal, tho?). An hour later I was sick to my stomach and had a rough night in the gastrointestinal tract. Absolutely no reason to return unless something changes.

It's like a fat man's dream come true. An all-you-can-eat buffet....that comes to you. Oh no Humphrey, don't get up. You just relax, you've had a busy day. \\n\\nThey split the buffet in two. There is a more traditional buffet (a.k.a. one where you have to actually walk over to and serve yourself) along with the Brazilian rodizio/churrascaro where servers bring hot skewers of sizzling meat items to you fresh from the flames. \\n\\nThe buffet items are mostly Brazilian influenced hot items like stews and sweet plantains (so friggin' good mmmmm) beans and rice. They also have french fries that are surprisingly good and a salad bar (yea, for suckers). I'd suggest for the most part avoid this line as much as possible, because you will eat it and you'll like it but it's mostly filler to get you full on rather than the real deal \\n\\nSpeaking of which let's talk about what we all come here for- the BBQ. They got sausages (not my fave but whatever, they're like kielbasa), they have pork loin (which is super juicy and succulent with the most heavenly, crispy skin layered over that super decadent fat), they have beef ribs (well done on the outside, medium on the inside) sirloin and \\"garlicky beef\\", and chicken hearts (the texture is chewy and when you think about eating a heart it's kinda gross but they are like garlic bombs- super yummy). In addition they do garlic bread (pass- not particularly great and another filler) and cinnamon dusted pineapple (probably filler but worth it). \\n\\nAsk for the hot chilies too. I'd recommend this only if you have a high tolerance for spice. Even if you do I'd recommend avoiding actually eating the peppers in the jar and just use the juice. If you eat the peppers let's just say it probably won't be the last time you endure their burn... \\n\\nThe worst part of the BBQ rotation is waiting for the thing you want to come around. When it does you then fiend for it \\"No I don't want just one slice, please give me four...oh and one from that side too please...yea, perfect, thanks!\\" So you eat a ton: gluttony, you don't have to move: sloth, hording the meat: greed...oh and I think I lust after the pork. 4/7 so far. Wow. \\n\\nThey make awesome caipirinhas that are very sweet with a nice acidic bite from the lime and they pack a wallop (though they're a little small for the price). \\n\\nHere's the catch: it can be a little costly. It's $22 for dinner Sun-Th and then jumps up to $25 Fri & Sat. The worst part was on one visit we got charged 18% gratuity for 2 people. Really? They didn't even tell us, it was just stuck on. I normally tip 20% but in that case I just said \\"Oh tip included- let's go\\": let's add wrath to that list. \\n\\nAt least vanity and pride are out cause I don't think anyone will be proud of themselves or feeling particularly attractive after consuming 6 pounds of beef."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I only came here for dessert but this place is a must for wine-lovers. \\n\\nWine defines the place, from the racks that form room dividers to the bathroom ceilings.

Outside seating is always a plus for me because I'm one of those annoying dog people that love their dogs like they would their kids.  One other suggestion though, is that the place looks pretty grimy.  The bathrooms aren't clean, the walls and doors are dirty, and where we sat we looked up to the wall to our right and saw a fly trap (with the sticky fly paper) filled with dead carcasses.

This is the only appetizer that our table didn't finish). Plus, great warm bread that's served with a nice thick olive oil!\\n\\nEntree: I had the hangar steak with pommes frittes.  Almost embarrassed to rave about this, but...best french fries EVER. Great seasoning and a slightly crispy finish.  I made it through half my french fries before I even remembered to eat my steak! The steak itself was good too, but I'd eaten at Fox Bros bbq for lunch so might have been a bit meat-ed out.  Didn't finish it, but remember it being pretty good even as leftovers the next day.  Another major plus was the risotto!  I'm not a big risotto fan, tends to be too heavy and creamy but this had a nice veggie undertone to it.

However, this review will be for the actual dining experience tonight.  \\n\\nIt is buffet style only.  I tried the sirloin beef, chicken, pork, kielbasa, and the beef rib. All the meats were pretty dry, except for the sirloin beef because we personally asked for it to be on the raw side.  The kielbasa was good too, a little salty but it was good. They have a super spicy homemade salsa type sauce they make and that was good, but be careful because it's on the extreme hot side.  I had to drink a lot of water because I felt most of the meat were dry and tasteless.  Also, they do not give free soda refills. There are two bars for cold food (salad, etc) and hot food (rice, beans, fries, and other strange items).  I only tried the rice and beans, because it looked the safest.  They were fine... nothing tasty or outstanding.  \\n\\nSo after eating all this food and meat, we decided to order my favorite dessert (because not all restaurants have it). Plus, they have a pretty decent list of desserts. I figure we can wash it all down with something yummy, right?!? \\n\\nWRONG. \\n\\nWe ordered the creme br√ªl√©e and it was disgusting! The absolute worst I have ever had in my life time. The person who tried torching it did an extremely awful job. It was not torched correctly, so it was still soft on top and you can actually taste the butane in the custard. It was very metallic and I literally had to spit out the first bite. I had to tell the waitress and she took it back.  It left an absolutely atrocious LAST taste in my mouth, literally.\\n\\nThe service was decent. Our waitress was a nice girl, but it was extremely loud in there so it was hard to hear her and she spoke super fast.  She rarely catered to us.  We had to keep asking her for service. She was not very attentive. But overall, she was sweet. \\n\\nFor a first dining experience, I must rate it negatively and highly doubt that I will ever go to eat in the dining room again.
