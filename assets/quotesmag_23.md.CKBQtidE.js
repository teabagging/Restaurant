(pronounced /(t)sunmi/) is a series of water waves (called a tsunami wave train) that is caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, such as an ocean. The original Japanese term literally translates as \\"harbor wave.\\" \\n\\nWe use natural disasters often in our descriptions of food that we love or hate.  Something has a taste that hits you like lightening, or another thing is like a hurricane or a tornado.  I must enjoy natural disasters because in my years I have seen more than my share of Mother Nature getting pissed off at me or people around me.  So I tread lightly when someplace uses a term of unimaginable destructive force that is entering my gastrointestinal system.\\n\\nRecently I have discovered via The Wife the edible delights of the Japanese people.  If you ever watch Iron Chef (the original) you can understand pretty quick why McDonald's is making a killing over there.  They eat the damnedest stuff over there, usually something out of the ocean that if you saw it on the beach you would say, \\"Ewww.\\"  \\n\\nI tried some good sushi, or at least in my limited knowledge of the scope of sushi at Sushi Hana in Vancouver.  I kept being told that this place, Sushi Tsunami, will make the other place seem like bait wrapped in rice.  Isn't all sushi bait?  But I digress...\\n\\nMy first plate was a California Roll, very good, I could tell that the ingredients were of a slightly better quality than I had tried before.  The rice was more supple, less stiff, but it still did the job of holding everything together.  The seafood has a slightly more delicate taste, not that the other place was bad, this was just a little more refined.  Next was a egg roll kind of wrapped rice with crab in the middle, it was larger in diameter and a required a little more effort to eat, but worth it.  Next was some Philly Roll which was excellent.  Then, I got brave and took an unassuming plate off the conveyor (by the way, food rotating by you in an endless parade is like the coolest thing EVER!) and found it to be Spicy Crab.  Interesting.  Fascinating.   Warm.  No, wait, kind of spicy and warmer.. no wait, kind of hot!  It was not however an uncomfortable, burn your gizzards kind of hot.  It kind of sidled up next to you and nudged you with an elbow and gave me a wink... and stayed for 25 minutes.  I liked it.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I have to say that so far Sushi Tsunami is the best place I have been to for Sushi.  Good part is I have tons more places to try!  Only next time I am going to eat the spicy first and then use the other plates to mellow out the heat.  Hope that plan works."},{"name":"Cultivate Food and Coffee","address":"1952 Howell Mill Rd NW, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite new brunch spots in Atlanta.

For food, we were honestly mistook this as a more bright/brunch-y place by the Yelp page, but were instead met with Cajun boils (there were buckets stationed at every table, for the discard items for a boil) and small plates. Since we weren't in the mood for a boil, we shared 3 small plates: steak tips, assorted seafood plate, and the dirty rice! I have to say all three were super yummy, but each dish felt really different from the others, so it didn't feel like a cohesive meal. Portion-wise, we probably could have gone for another item but were satisfied with these dishes. \\n\\nAmbiance inside was interesting, the decor is very unique, graffiti'd walls and gaudy chandeliers/decor.

I have a nut allergy, and I explained this to our waiter before and during ordering. My boyfriend and I ordered drinks and the cheese plate as an appetizer. The waiter acknowledged my nut allergy and said the dish we chose was nut free. He came back with our drinks and gave us some bread and hummus. He later came out and gave us our cheese plate, which clearly contained visible nuts throughout the plate. Mistakes happen, and I was glad I caught it before digging in. We planned to just let the waiter know when he came by our table next, so he could take it back to the kitchen. As others have mentioned, service was very slow even though there were almost no patrons in the restaurant. When the waiter did finally come by again-before we could mention the issue of the nuts throughout our cheese plate-the waiter explained that the bread and hummus that he served us earlier contains nuts. Again, mistakes happen, but it seemed like he had not been trained at all on how to handle food allergies with the kitchen, and the amount of time that had passed before he realized his mistake and came to tell us was alarming. \\n\\nWhat I found the most alarming, however, and what will cause me to never return to the Westland again, was that before I could even respond to the waiter telling us that he had served us nuts, he then continued on to say that we should be glad he even told us about it once he realized... as if not telling me was an option he had seriously considered, and he was patting himself on the back for doing the right thing instead of letting me eat the food that he knew contained nuts in it. \\n\\nI see that another Yelp reviewer experienced issues with this as well, and I feel it's important for people to be aware of this. Obviously food allergies don't affect everyone, but for those that do have them, I would really reconsider coming here. I would not be surprised if the Westland ends up seriously harming someone.\\n\\n**Edit: I just want to edit this to add the message on Yelp that I just received from my waiter that night after the manager responded to my post. While I do appreciate the apology, and I understand mistakes happen, I still think people should be aware of this, especially since the waiter's recollection of the incident is very different than the manager's assertions in his comment below. It's definitely possible that I misinterpreted the waiter's reaction, but my general sense that the situation wasn't handled safely or well still stands. Message from the waiter [I removed his name because I don't want to put him personally on blast, I think this is more on the restaurant re: training than him] below: \\n\\n'Hi Jennifer,\\n\\nI understand that you posted this review with the intention of protecting guests with food allergies and I want to take this chance to respond to both your review and Bill's response to it. \\n\\nMy name is --, I was your server that night. I recall parts of your visit and that you and your boyfriend sat at a two-top table at the left side of the dining room. I apologize that I made mistakes during your visit which put you at risk because of your food allergy. \\n\\nGoing back to a couple of things that you brought up. I remember having a moment of panic when I realized I served you hummus. At the time, I thought to myself \\"oh no, that has nuts in it, she can't have nuts.\\" [factually that's inaccurate which I'll get to later]. I went over to your table to bring the hummus issue to your attention. I meant to convey that I recognize that your allergy is a serious issue, and brought it to your attention once I realized that you may have had nuts because I wanted to make sure you could take any necessary steps e.g. reaction medication or otherwise. I didn't mean to convey that I thought about not telling you because that would never be an option because I wouldn't put someone's life at risk over not being truthful. \\n\\nBill in his response mentions that the charcuterie board & hummus don't contain nuts, however I hadn't yet spoken to him about your visit. The hummus doesn't - it has sesame seeds in it which I misidentified as a nut, which is why I came to talk to you about it and left you with the impression that you had eaten nuts (even though as Bill says factually it doesn't contain nuts).\\n\\nOur team is still working on tracking down what happened with the charcuterie board. I don't doubt you when you said that there were \\"visible nuts\\" on it. The charcuterie board is not served with nuts typically, but that evening I believe that nuts were placed on the board. We were running a special that included toasted pistachios and I believe that nuts were added to the board that night. This however shouldn't have happened if I had made the proper note on your ticket in the kitchen about the allergy. I take full responsibility for these mistakes.'"},{"name":"Osteria Nino","address":"19 3rd Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"Food? Good. Service? Not so much. \\n\\nPretty good food.

I was sick of the american food scene and i never had moroccon so i started looking it up ofcourse i came on yelp and i saw mixed reviews mostly saying the food was good but the service was poor... I almost did not go because of this however im glad i did\\n\\nA friend of mine was coming in from out of town so i decided to take her there to hang out on friday night, I made an 8:30p reservation because i was working early the next day i didnt want to leave too late. We ended up getting there around 8:45. We passed the place because like many people on here say its in a tiny strip mall with not a big enough sign so if you dont slow down you wont see it.\\n\\nFast forward to our entrance, yes it is valet parking but there is no charge so relax but they do accept tips. When we entered the first room it looked like somebodys back porch with a few chairs and lame decor i was confused because no one was there but then i saw a door to the right  and when we entered it we saw the hostess stand with a few empty tables behind them i joked to my friend that we were the only ones there but as soon as i said it we looked to the left and saw a cozy dimly lit lounge area with lots of diners! It had morrocon themed decor with pillows and rugs. \\n\\nWe were quickly escorted to our tables and given menus. A few min later our waitress came and gave a run down of the morrocon culture and menu. they washed our hands with warm water at the table which i thought was a nice touch and gave us hand towels to clean as we were instructed we will be eating with our hands. We ordered the 5 course meal for two which many people who reviewed complained that it was overpriced but the portions were decent and the food was above average.\\n\\nWhat i loved most about this place it the belly dancing and music while you eat it keeps you pumped inbetween conversations if your there with good people but at the same time its a laid back atmosphere. If your looking for quick eat and go service your better of sticking to your typical steakhouse and/or seafood restaraunt. You wont see the waiters scurrying around you every minute they give you what you need and go. Which is why you need to go with people who you can laugh and talk with inbetween entertainment so you wont be so focused on leaving.\\n\\nFirst came the bread  soup and salad (all served at once which was weird but hey) It was a morrocon salad with chick pea, olives, beans amongst other things i enjoyed that! the soup however was cold but i didnt mind so much as long as the entree was good. Next came the appetizer it was a curry chicken pate' of some type wrapped in a flakey pastry with confectioners sugar and almonds it wasnt my speed but it was nice to try something different. The entree came and i ordered the fish of the day which was roasted in morrocon spices highly recommended by the ladies at the table next to me. And bwoy did they deliver the Fish was sooooo flavorful it was the right amount of spicy salt and the right amount of sweet. I only wished it came with a starch as opposed to the warm salad it was served with. The dessert was a fruit salad and a tart wasnt crazy about the dessert because i am a dessert girl and i love chocolate but the Tea they served with it was AMAZING!! the best tea ive had a restaurant hands down! so my dinner ended well!! \\n\\nOVERALL great environment good food great entertainment definately going back!!

We made reservations for a Friday evening and when we arrived the place was packed. Despite how busy they were we were taken to our seats right away and handed personalized menus that said \\"Happy Birthday\\" across them. How sweet is that! Our server came by with menus and water and then gave us time to look over the drink menu. It took us a while to choose because they only allow one drink menu per table and it's rather long. So we had to, one by one look through it all. We eventually settled on our picks, but I do suggest allowing each costumer to be able to view a menu... maybe make them smaller or something if they can't afford to have more made.  I went with the Quetzal, and my sisters chose the Pretty 'n' Pink and the Pura Vida. On top of the time it took to pick drinks due to the menu situation, our drink orders took forever to come out. \\n\\nWe eventually got our drinks and settled on food for the evening. We each started with a salad and the Ensalada Cesar was a great pick. While it had a little too much dressing on it, the flavors were there, it was fresh, and I ate every bite. For our first round of tapas we went with the Patatas Bravas, Calamares Fritos, and the Mofongo. The Patatas were delicious, cooked wonderfully with a crunchy outside and soft inside. I also enjoyed the sauces that it came with. The Calamares order was enormous actually. They were great and the lemon thyme aioli it came with was a perfect pairing. I don't eat pork, so I steered clear of the Mofongo, but my sisters said it was great. At this point we put in another round of drinks and these took even longer than the first. \\n\\nFor our next round of tapas we went with the Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp) and the Albondigas. I stuck with the shrimp and they were delicious. A little spicy and cooked perfectly. My sisters enjoyed the meatballs and then we moved on to dessert. While this was a hard decision, we were quick to jump on the Pastel de Chocolate and the Tarta de Queso. The birthday girl was a big fan of the chocolate pudding cake and I was obsessed with the orange pistachio cheesecake. Seriously, one of the best pieces of cheesecake I've ever had. The flavor combinations were divine. \\n\\nOverall, we had a fabulous evening out as sisters and Barcelona was a great way to kick off the night. While we were celebrating and didn't mind splurging, I would say that the price point is rather high. The drink menu doesn't include any prices and we were a little shocked by the cost of each cocktail when the bill arrived. I've been to other Spanish tapa places in bigger cities like Chicago and they didn't break the bank as much, but the flavors and dishes were just as wonderful if not a slightly more complicated. With that being said, I really want to come back and try one of their paellas.

The reason behind cooking via sous vide is the meat retains its moisture and also less oily.\\n\\nThe team at The Ramenman maintains a minimalist menu which consists of three different chicken broth ramen varieties - Chicken and Clams with Truffle Oil, Chicken Stew with Burdock and Oil, and Regular Chicken Broth, but don't worry they also have a very delicious Vegetarian Miso Broth made with Shiitake Mushrooms and Smoked Kombu.\\n\\nTheir menu also has a few other items to fill you up if you aren't already full from drinking all the chicken broth. You could snack on a plate of Gyozas or munch on an Appetizer Plate which has - Char-siu, Ramen Egg, Bamboo Shoot, Japanese Leek and Spinach. My personal favourite is the crispy Chicken Karaage - juicy on the inside and super crispy on the outside.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you're really not full yet and still have more room in your belly than another must-try is their Staff Meal Curry with the 63 Degree Egg. The curry they serve is not your typical \\"Japanese curry\\" which tends to be on the sweeter side. Their curry is much more bold with savoury flavours and has a bit of a kick to it which I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\\nThe Ramenman might be the new kid on the block, but they definitely do not disappoint when it comes to cooking techniques and flavour profiles.\\n\\nSo if you're in the area and it happens to be raining (which happens often enough in Vancouver) then make a pit stop at The Ramenman say hello to the team and enjoy a delicious bowl of chicken broth ramen!\\n\\n@the.ramenman"},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place is honestly such a joke. If I could give 0 stars I would. Went here for the first time tonight finally after living in Columbus my entire life. My husband and I have heard how amazing the burgers are. When we arrived the hostess quoted us a 45 minute wait- which is reasonable considering it was a Saturday night and a popular place in a popular location. When it got to be close to an hour we checked just to see how much longer it would be. She told us 7 people were still in front of us. Once it got to be well over an hour we checked again....this time 6 parties in front of us. Meanwhile we had watched groups and groups of people leave so I'm not sure how that logic worked. Finally at 2 HOURS we were sat.  Now, I get it, I've been a hostess and a waitress before. I understand that you can't be precise with quoting times. But come on... to tell people it'll be 45 minutes when it turns into 2 hours is just unfair. Other parties around us were complaining of the same thing. We would normally never wait that long but it was a Saturday night so we would have to wait any other place probably and we had invested some time there already, so we kept figuring we would be called soon.  The hostess was rude anytime she was asked about seating by anyone. she was on her phone half the time, in the back at the bar standing around and generally just being miserable. We wish we would have just left then considering the experience we had going forward.\\n\\nOnce we were seated we waited a good 10 minutes before being greeted by a rough waitress who quickly and rudely asked us what we wanted. Thankfully we knew because we had 2 hours to look at the menu and we were already over this horrible place. My husband ordered the Thurman burger which he said was good but certainly not worth the experience. Our mozzarella sticks were inedible- hard and cold along with the sauce. Once the woman took our order we didn't see her again until we had to flag her down for our check. She saw we didn't eat half the food and never asked about it. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is awful. It's definitely a dive bar and I love dive bars and fun hole in the wall places. But this place was horrifically dirty. There's a difference between being eclectic and just plain disgusting. The waiting area- which is bigger than the actual restaurant/bar area was gross and sticky. The carpet was filthy and everything looked stained. The actual eating area was even worse. Our table was sticky and dirty, the lamps above the tables had so much dirt and grime and grease on them it was making me sick to my stomach. Flies were everywhere, the walls were dirty and greasy. Not to mention the music is so loud and terrible, I felt like I Was in a fun house. I honestly cannot fathom how this place is so talked up. It was the worst dining experience I have ever had. Whoever manages this place should be ashamed of themselves. They obviously are so reliant on their name and reputation they've lost all pride in taking care of their business. Rude and nasty staff and dirty surroundings with dirty food. If you want to eat grease filled Walmart food in a basement like atmosphere and be treated like you're an inconvenience, by all means go here!!!\\nIf you value just basic cleanliness where you eat and have any pride in yourself, stay far away.

I ate an absurd amount of food, and probably would have needed to put my camera on panoramic mode to capture all of me. So the world never got a glimpse of the \\"super sized\\" version of me, and were left to salivate over my eats. Undoubtedly a big part of who I am today was shaped by my time living in Portland, and everytime I go back my gut, hips, and thighs are really shaped by all the delicious restaurants I go to.\\n\\nTasty n Alder was the best meal I had on my last trip, and I'd go as far as to say there's not a better brunch spot in the heart of Downtown Portland (on SW 12th & Alder). One of the great things about brunch in these parts is that it's served daily from 9am- 2pm, not just on weekends, allowing you to go early on a weekday without having to wait in line. If you're already in Downtown then I see no reason to make an extra special trip out to Tasty n Sons in North Portland, when there's Tasty N Alder here.\\n\\nThe most \\"must get\\" BRUNCH dish might just be the POTATOES BRAVAS. Now, I'm not necessarily saying it's the best thing there, but it can easily work as an appetizer for just yourself, or be shared with others. The potatoes are tasty in their own right, but they're complemented by amazing aioli and the over easy egg is like the cherry on top.\\n\\nFor a larger plate, it's hard to pass up the KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN (w/ short grain rice, house kimchi, eggs two ways). I much prefer this style of fried chicken over that at The Screen Door, and I don't say that out of any allegiance to the Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. It's more flavorful and everything mixed in like the cucumbers and egg yolk goes so well together.\\n\\nOther impressive plates to tantalize you with include their Chocolate Potato Doughnut, Cast Iron Frittata, Auntie Paula's French Toast, and Bim Bop Bacon & Eggs (and I haven't even brought up their dinner menu yet - hello Foie Gras w/ Pineapple Jam and Wagyu Skirt Steak).\\n\\nSome day I'd love to try the \\"Dim Summore\\" cocktail (vodka, tomato, hoisin, lime, Sriracha, ginger) but even I can only consume so many calories on one sitting (without the chair giving out)."},{"name":"Lion's Tail","address":"354 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite places for drinks - they have a pretty expansive cocktail menu and they will occasionally change those out (seasonally).

Not bad but also not mind-blowing but again, I love this place not so much for their food but rather their drinks (and super close proximity to my apartment hehe). It is almost a lounging atmosphere where you can just come and chill with friends and order drinks all night - they have decent sized table so larger groups aren't usually an issue. The service can be a little slow - they usually seem to be understaffed, 1 or maybe 2 waiters running the floor for the entire restaurant. It isn't a huge place but there can still be quite a few tables - so it takes a while for them to usually come back to your table to refill the drinks. \\n\\nCould be a great date spot although it does get a little noisy but if your date enjoys cocktails - this will not disappoint.

In one word, that was my most recent experience here. \\n\\nI've been to this old-school establishment many times over the years with fairly consistent service and a generally good time.

A giant salad completely covered with hunks of bleu cheese, thinly sliced prime rib, and all the other typical items in a Cobb Salad. It was amazing! I will post a photo of that memorable salad.\\n\\nI went back mid January and again, ordered the Cobb Salad so I had a good comparison under the new ownership. The salad was a bit smaller but pretty much the same. It wasn't as memorable as the first one but otherwise my experience was okay.\\n\\nSaturday night was a completely different experience and one that I won't be repeating any time soon. Again, Cobb Salad. The first thing I noticed was that it was about half the size of the first salad and no prime rib. The price was either the same or just slightly higher so I definitely felt I did not get my money's worth. When the waitress asked how it was I told her I was disappointed that they had taken the prime rib off. She checked with the cook and apparently new menus had just come out the day before, clearing stating there was no prime rib....but of course I didn't look at the menu as I knew what I wanted to order. Even the waitress was surprised that the salad had changed....but wait, there's more!\\n\\nI pride myself on never having a hangover. The key is drinking lots of water with your alcohol. Three times I asked the waitress for ice water with my cocktail and never saw a single glass. At one point, she actually had an ice water on her tray but when she got to our table, she dropped off everything else and then left with the water. What the???\\n\\nAbout 11:30pm we started trying to flag down the waitress to bring our tabs. Really long story short, it took us 80 minutes to get out of there. She lost one of the credit cards and insisted we had not given it to her. I explained in detail every single thing that happened and why I knew she had the card. She finally returned saying she had talked to the manager and they would comp my friend's tab since they lost her card and that she should contact the bank in the morning to close the card. As we were all standing there awestruck, the bartender walked up and handed her the lost card. I took it from her to be sure it was the correct card and before I could give it to my friend to put in her wallet she snatched it right out of my hand. I said, \\"Wait. You said you were going to comp her tab.\\" She then took off at a trot, yelling over her shoulder, \\"but that was when we didn't have her card to swipe.\\"\\n\\nI think the entire thing was handled really poorly so between the crappy service and the substandard food, I doubt I will be back."},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great service.

I must say that the two places I most DO NOT want to encounter kids are on an airplane and in a restaurant. Imagine my amazement then when, seated upstairs with a view down on the aforementioned cherubs, I saw sundry tots totally engrossed (and silent in the main) in their diversions, with much adult supervision awaiting any contingency nearby. That said, the main thing about this place for me is that the food is truly amazingly good. I would consider this a destination restaurant against all odds (i.e., the aforementioned daycare aspect and the somewhat out-of-the way mall location). The cuisine couldn't be more eclectic. There is a strong, though non-traditional, Indian strain in the mix, but also, on the night we went, ribeye steak and pastas galore. My only criticisms would be the pretty spartan upstairs d√©cor (reserved for the childless perhaps?) and the uber-complicated menu. I got the impression that they wanted to have an at-table consultation to custom construct bespoke meals on an individual basis.

Steaks are around $50 and they are big, i.e., no option for the nibbler.  A recent special featured a chili rib-eye with prawns; the spices on the slab were wonderful, the prawns just average. I still prefer Morton's, but steaks here are much better than Ruth Chris and on par with Ringside. The risotto was a big miss.  The heralded calamari appetizer lived up to its billing, the crab cakes better than average.  A creamsicle martini concoction was very delish.\\n\\nThe out of the oven bread was excellent (but why serve with whipped butter?); we regret not getting the fresh-baked cookies for dessert.  Speaking of which, I've never been impressed by the sweets on the menu.  Wine selection was vast and pricy as expected.  One of the managers came by our table so that's always a nice gesture.

There is not a strong cocktail scene yet in Atlanta (though Holman & Finch was ahead of the curve), so this place is a welcome addition.\\n\\nGetting in: last I checked, this is place is \\"reservation only\\", which does guarantee a decent experience for those who go. The process is by email and is explained simply enough on their website.\\n\\nVibe: Just beautiful. Mostly black interior with some dim globe lights, plus some ambient electronic music or other music that suites that vibe (some Interpol and even Digable Planets?). It's two floors and a bar, but the space is small enough for a very intimate experience. I used this analogy in another review, but I'll use it here as well--Even Willie Tanner from \\"Alf\\" would seem cool in here (though in my mind, he always had an \\"it\\" factor).\\n\\nFood/Drink: It's mostly cocktail bar, so food is mostly tapas-style...you do not come here for a full meal. I liked my drinks for the most part, though I didn't think the one with truffle oil worked so well (It tend to get gin-based drinks that are lighter and herbal). That's largely a preference--the drinks themselves were well-made and well-presented. My pork-slider type thing was decent enough. Again, you're coming mainly for vibe and drinks...not food.\\n\\nService: Really got to hand it to this place...doormen/hosts and servers all extremely accommodating. I'd expect nothing less from the city where the beloved '80s series \\"Matlock\\" was set.\\n\\nSummary: Very nice place, but the \\"reservation only\\" policy leaves me with mixed feelings. On one hand, it helps keep the place from getting overcrowded (which is key to maintaining the intimate vibe), but on the other hand, people often like to go to such bars on \\"the spur of the moment\\". In other words, I'm fine making reservations at a 3-star Michelin restaurant since that's something you plan for weeks in advance and look forward to, but it can be somewhat annoying to do for a cocktail bar since you don't know until the last moment if you're in the mood for it (or perhaps it's just me).

Many of the staples of their formerly delicious menu are now gone too. The pickle chips (they have spears now but they're not as good), the buttermilk chicken sandwich, great dressings, etc. The fried chicken last month was dry, flavorless, and our server spilled an entire plate of food on our table and tried scooping the food back into the plate for us to eat before we asked for a new serving.

Do not waste your time on a busy night. I understand it is New Year's Eve and they were busy, but there were several open tables and plenty of workers. My girlfriend and I walk in to our reservation at 9:00. We are escorted to the very back of the restaurant to a lone table next to a party of six. So we are isolated in the back, which isn't terrible in a busy restaurant, till you realize directly to the right is a door. Several workers were going in and out of the door within feet of us, keep in mind it's below freezing outside. Again, not terrible, just slightly annoying. 10 minutes go by and the only staff we have talked to was the hostess that seated us. So I go up and speak to her again about the issue. She goes and tells the waiter, which we appreciated. He took another 10 minutes before he comes by and says \\"I'll be with you momentarily\\" as he proceeds to take another 5 minutes after that to bring us water. He then says \\"I'll be back\\" before we can even get a word in. I was never given a drink menu, but I didn't even bother asking for it because I assumed it would take another 10 minutes. The whole time we were there our waiter was very short with us and standoffish, as if we were the ones irritating him. We finally order our appetizer on his 3rd visit. And our meals on his 4th. Still workers going in and out of the door while we wait. Our meals finally show up. The chicken parm was pretty good but my girlfriend ordered the Filet. It came to us burned black. For $33 I would certainly expect it to be a good steak... Now it's getting a little later. They close at 10:00, but we planned on a quick dinner since we knew it was closing. So the crowd has cleared out, we are basically alone in the back of the restaurant. Maybe a couple other parties in this waiters section. At this point we just want to get our check and leave but we can't even get him to come by. We had to ask a young lady that was helping clear the table. She said she would go tell our waiter, who she seemed to think was named Patrick (which was news to us since he never told us himself). He comes by with the check which is covered in something sticky. Then he doesn't even come back to get it. The bus boy has to get it off our table and bring it to him. He comes back and leave it on the table for me to sign and just says \\"by bye now\\" with a very sarcastic tone. We had a terrible experience, but I cannot blame the other workers.

When my fianc√© and I arrived there was already a line formed and they hadn't even opened yet! When they finally opened the line moved quickly, but there is a not a huge space inside so by the time it got to us we had to put our names down. When you wait you can either leave (since they will call when they're ready) or you can wait by the bar and grab a drink. They also have coffee available for you to grab while you wait, but don't be fooled it will get charged to your tab later (we had thought it was complimentary). My fianc√© and I were the second name to be put down the list, by the time we were seated they were already onto the next page and the wait was 2.5 hours and people were still choosing to put their name down! \\n\\nThey do have an interesting concept where their food is meant to share, meaning the portions are not too big but not too small, but just enough to share so that you can order more and split. Also they bring out each dish when it is ready so you may not get all your food at the same time. This can be a good thing if you're a super fast eater that way you can slow down and digest your food!\\nWe opted for the bim bop bacon & eggs and the fried egg & cheddar biscuit. The food was good, cooked well and packed with flavor; however, for the price and portion size I am not too sure it is worth it. The biscuit just comes as one sandwich for $9. It is huge, it can be gobbled down in 4 bites. The biscuit was toasted nicely. The egg complimented the fried chicken well. The fried chicken wasn't dry, quite juicy. I do wish the cheddar was more melted. Overall, a nice sandwich but not sure if it is worth $9 if it can be demolished so quickly. The bim bop tasted like standard bi bim bap, but it was nothing spectacular.

A pro: it is charming that there are family/friend pics on the walls.  A downside: there are some lighting challenges, but I guess if you asked the staff to dim the lights, they probably would.  What I now know about JenChan's is that she and her community poured a lot of heart into the physical space.  I hope with their continued success, they might get the opportunity to do more. \\n\\nIn good news, one server gal was absolutely delightful. So genuinely energetic and a great server.  \\n\\nA heads-up that JenChans corn fritters are hush puppies, not fritters. They are tasty, but they just aren't fritters.\\n\\nPimento cheese egg rolls were great. Delighted they weren't too cheesey. \\n\\nCoconut curry. Watch out: it's VERY spicy.  And I have a high tolerance for ghost peppers, habanero, etc with ease. This dish has a heavy handed CuRrY kIcK!!!  There is not warning on the menu, so consider yourself informed. If the curry spice was toned down a bit, I imagine this dish would be very good.\\n\\nAll in all, JenChan's strength is the positive energy exuding from the staff and those who have invested into her success.  I do recommend checking it out."},{"name":"Fresh Kitchen","address":"851 N Alafaya Trl, Ste Q-01","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I come to fresh kitchen once in a blue moon when its convenient.

Salaryman offers a hybrid Japanese Korean menu, with a nice selection of cocktails and a thick sake menu. The Old Fashioned made with Japanese whisky is an instant favorite. Hot appetizers tend to come from the Korean side of the fence, such as rice balls with kimchi. The fried chicken is first-rate, but those rice bowls could have been a bit gutsier. They serve a cheesy corn which is exactly what you would expect: corn with lots of melted cheese. I am told this is much loved in Korea, and I can't argue with it, but after having it it seemed a bit odd to pay for it in a restaurant. The barbecue pork ribs where everything you could hope for. I'm also quite impressed by the ramen. They offer three broths: salt, soy and tonkotsu. I look forward to trying them all in time--a miso broth is my very favorite, but it seems small-hearted to gripe about not having a fourth choice. The tonkotsu is rich and creamy without being overbearing. The noodles are superb, with just that feel between the teeth of \\"real\\" ramen. Ten points out of ten for the soft boiled egg (they call it a \\"tamago egg\\" on the menu, which means I don't know what--\\"tamago\\" is just the Japanese word for \\"egg\\"), and, oh, six out of ten for the pork, which would have been better chargrilled, and in a few smaller slices rather than one big one. The only real fault I can give them is that it didn't come out quite piping hot... Ramen should come out almost too hot to eat, so you have to slurp carefully at first and it's still nicely hot at the end. For my part, I've been twice in two weeks and look forward to my third visit."},{"name":"Tin Lizzy's Cantina","address":"77 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This cantina was amazing!

It sets the standard for all other happy hours.\\n\\nThe drink specials are not exactly cheap, but they aren't terribly expensive either. My manhattan was top notch, as was my partner's martini, and my sister's dark 'n stormy. The taplist, while hardly extensive seems well curated. You won't find anything particularly exotic on it, but you will fond something you like. Point is, this really isn't an establishment to visit if you're looking for flights of the latest overhopped IPA's. PCG is more of a cocktail place. The ambience reflects this. Mood lighting, lively conversation, amazing views, and some of the most personable, attentive staff im the city. \\n\\nOf course, there's more to a happy hour than discounted drinks. After all, the aim is to get butts in seats, and to keep them there for as long as possible with inexpensive food. PCG delivers. In spades. We essentially ordered the entire food menu. There was not a single disappointment to be found. The Caesar salad was the rival of any I've had, the fish and chips were outstanding...and then there was the steak sandwich. Again, PCG sets the standard. It's tender, and marinated just right and served on crispy Parmesan Texas toast. If I recall correctly, it was less than $10, there was more than enough for all three of us. I'm forgetting some of the other plates, which is a shame because they were anything but forgettable...but I procrastinated writing this review for a while. Either way, if it's on the menu and it sounds good...it is. Order it. You won't regret it.

I regret nothing.\\n\\nIn fact, even when the bill arrived, i was not particularly regretful. Between the three of us, we had about a dozen drinks, six or seven plates of food, and two orders of cheesecake. With a 25% tip, i got out of PCG for about $120. Crunch those numbers with me, friends. That's a steal. Next time I feel like splurging a bit without totally pillaging my checking account, I will make my way to the top of the Portland dining scene.

Everything was filling and so tasteful. It was definitely some of the best breakfast I've had, although I was not as satisfied with the Bloody Mary I had. Portland raised the bar for Bloody Marys', at least in my book, before then I was disgruntedly un-content with the Bloody Marys' back in LA. Sadly, the one they served me here was not up to par with the ones I tasted at other Portland establishments, and totally reminded me of those back home. \\nThe only inconvenience about having breakfast here is that one must buss their own table after the meal's end. While it's not something I'm accustomed to doing it's no big deal. I just wasn't too certain about where to place certain things when I was done, and where to toss any left overs. I figured it out...\\nWe had such an amazing breakfast, but as I write this review I find myself longing for one of those biscuit sandwiches everyone is raving about in their reviews.

I personally didn't mind the wait, but my family started to get very angry. From the time we sat down to the time our food came to the table was an hour and a half. We had small children with us so the wait time was NOT family-friendly. For such a pricey restaurant, their expectations of service were much higher. I had no problems with the waiter, but the delay was very noticeable.

The burgers were so big that it was a little difficult to get all the flavors together into one bite.  Neither of us even attempted to eat without a knife and fork.\\n\\nThe service throughout the evening was rather brisk and erratic, which I was expecting, but Dan was not terribly impressed by.  Though the burgers were good, they are so large that it is really not worth it for me -- someone who could probably make three meals out of one of them.

I'm not into broths that are heavy on the star anise or cloves.  If you love pho, you must try this place!\\n\\nPREVIOUS REVIEW\\nOkay, I've been looking for a pho place closer to home in Seminole County for quite a while with no luck.  Stumbled upon this place on Yelp and stopped in after a night of power drinking.  In case you guys didn't know, pho is the best hangover cure in the world.  I have no facts to back this up...just my personal experiences. :)\\n\\nSince then, I've been to this place 3 times and will probably stop by again today.  Food is fresh, noodles are cooked perfectly (al dente), and broth is well seasoned with a little sweetness and strong ginger flavor.  The prices are more than reasonable, but I docked it one star for skimping on the meats and accoutrements.  Although, the portions are fine to me, if you're used to the meat portions on Mills/Colonial area, then you may be a bit disappointed.\\n\\nThey have a lunch menu where you get an entree, an appetizer and a drink for under $10...which is a heckuva deal.  Overall, this place is a lot better than the previous restaurant that was here, more authentic than Saigon Flavors, tastes better than iPho, and blows Bambu out of the water.  So if you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food, this is the BEST VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT IN SEMINOLE COUNTY."},{"name":"Papa's Pizza Parlor","address":"15700 NW Blueridge Dr","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"I've been to Papa's one time.

The thing about cold fall/winter nights is that sometimes I want a good noodle soup. Since I've been venturing to the Cobb/Smyrna area lately, I checked out Yakitori Jinbei.\\n\\nLocated in a shopping center, Yakitori Jinbei takes up a small space a few doors down from Tacos La Villa and the Supermercado La Villa. Walking into the restaurant, it felt promising with the simple decor: small, narrow space, bright lights and wood booth benches. \\n\\nMy date and I each ordered a bowl of ramen. I had the regular tonkatsu broth while he had the spicy tonkatsu broth. We also decided to share the 5-serving yakitori combo of the two types of chicken. Everything came out at once. At first glance, the yakitori hardly looked like it was grilled. Let's just say that it tastes better than it looks as it did have that charcoal flavor. Strangely, the chicken was very moist and flavorful but not quite what I was expecting for something that should be grilled. Where's the char? Where are the grill marks? I did enjoy the chicken yakitori with the \\"Japanese jalepenos.\\" \\n\\nAs for the ramen I ordered, they were very generous with the noodles. The ramen is actually chewy and I do prefer it more than Umaido's ramen. I'm pretty sure Yakitori Jinbei doesn't make their own ramen, so maybe it's the consistency of how the noodles were cooked to be a bit al dente. The soup was delicate and not so salty as Umaido's. I had a sip of the spicy tonkatsu, and well, call me a purist, I think the regular tonkatsu broth is just fine. I would've liked it some other vegetable in the ramen besides shredded cabbage and perhaps a little more meats besides the 2 slices of pork and half of a hardboiled egg. On a cold day, this definitely hit the spot.\\n\\nI'm not sure if I'd come back. Maybe if I'm craving ramen or if I wanted just yakitori. I definitely missed out on the okonomiyaki, so I'll probably come back to try it.

My filet was way over cooked and drown in salt. The other filet was ok. The surf and turf looked like the lobster was brought in from Lake buena vista. It was sent back once. I happen to be on a business dinner with people that have eaten there for years.....they were disappointed.

The bagels are good, but the service is HORRIBLE. \\n\\n\\nLet me preface this review by saying I've been going to this location and the location in Reading religiously for years. The bagels and coffee were good enough to offset how poor the service is but today was the straw that broke the camel's back. \\n\\nThis morning I ordered a coffee and 2 bagels 1 of which being a salami and cheese on a plain bagel with HONEY mustard for a friend of mine. When I got to the window the rude lady (who is featured in almost all of the negative reviews) told me that she put regular mustard on it by accident and did I care if she put both. I said if it's not too big of a pain could you just make me a new one because it's not for me. She looked at me blankly and closed he window without saying anything. A few minutes later she returned with my coffee and bagels. \\n\\nWhen my friend opened the bagel there was both types of mustard in globs all over it. Why would you ask me and then charge me $5 for it anyway?

It's also one of the tourist spots that's can sometimes be worth the hassle.\\n\\nIt's a very small sit-down restaurant, with something like 36 seats, so turnover isn't super fast and wait times are almost guaranteed the minute the door opens. When we lived nearby, we would get lucky from time to time right after work, or during storms, and just walk right in. If you're not that lucky, you can put your name on the list and they'll call you. The wait times can be outrageous, though, so don't act surprised when you walk in and they tell you 2 or 3 hours. Generally, we recommend going about 30 minutes before the restaurant opens, but even then it doesn't always guarantee you a seat since some folks get line up and wait for larger parties to join them. A short line can sometimes be deceptive.\\n\\nOnce you've secured your seat, you may find that the space is a little cramped. The bar is pretty tight, but it's easily our favorite place to sit. The table/bench seating is also cramped. It's more-or-less community seating .You'll be close to strangers, which is great for creeping on their food when it comes to the table, but if you're not into hearing someone else's conversations, or you simply like personal space, it could seem awkward.\\n\\nSo, after you've waited 2 hours, and squeezed into a booth without dipping your jacket into someone's chowder at your neighbor's table, you finally get to enjoy what you came for: the food! But first, you get to enjoy the wonderful service. Generally speaking, we've only had great service at Neptune. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and quite patient (especially considering what they put up with). \\n\\nOverall, the food is excellent. The lobster rolls are some of the most generously-portioned lobster rolls in the city, and some of the best! Their buns don't always hold up too long under the pressure of the contents, so I always recommend attacking your lobster roll immediately. The side of fries is fine, but get the side salad. Trust me. It's more memorable than fries that you've had a million times. Plus, you won't feel as guilty ordering some extra well-shucked oysters, or made-to-order clam chowder, or whatever else you're curious about! They have daily specials, and mediterranean-inspired dishes that are also solid choices, but if you want a surprising dish, get the burger. Easily one of the best burgers in the city, and I can't count the number of times that I chose the burger after the seemingly life-or-death debate of \\"lobster roll vs burger.\\" \\n\\nSo, the food is generally going to be pretty good. Not every dish hits a home run, but you're odds of an enjoyable meal are fairly high. The real conversation afterwards will always be, \\"was it worth the wait?\\" \\n\\nThe hype that surrounds Neptune (and some other North End establishments) can elevate expectations. The long wait can also make you more discerning. Putting up with the crowded atmosphere means even further pressure for the food to offset everything you've dealt with. As former locals, we treated Neptune like any other good restaurant, but if you're in town for a few days, would you want to spend 3 hours waiting  for that call? Will the food be as good as memorable as you'd hope? Probably not, honestly. The longer the wait, the more I'd tell you of excellent alternatives that would make you just as happy without the nonsense. That said, it's still a place we recommend to friends and family. As long as you temper or experiential expectations a bit and focus on the food, you'll probably be happy, but that's for you to find out for yourself!

Now according to the picture on the menu the soup is orange.  Basically the soup tastes like pumpkin, sort of on the sweet side.  I didn't taste the kombu (kelp) or the shitake mushroom at all.  I didn't really enjoy it all that much.  I wouldn't order it again.   Anyway, neither myself or my friend were really satisfied with our meal and we were both still hungry.  We both ordered the Seafood Zuke Don.  I really wish I took a picture.  It wasn't....great.  It was 2 pieces of salmon and 2 pieces of tuna atop of some salad and sushi rice.  The tuna was the worst (which is why I wish I took a pic).  Whoever sliced it, sliced it wrong (like along the grain).  Now I'm no sushi chef but I know when you bite into a piece you shouldn't see the sinew or whatever it's called.  So I wouldn't order that again either.  People seem to like this place...

In the end, I opted to go for the \\"J-Bouli Bowl.\\" I'm still a little confused on what that entails versus the other bowls, but I ended up with tabbouleh, med rice (brown rice cooked w/lentils, onions, sweet peppers), black beans, chicken, pico de gallo, and a bit of tzatziki on the side. \\n\\nSo many flavors intersecting at one point in space and time. Only issue was that it was a little bit runny at the bottom, perhaps due to the pico being a bit watery, but it wasn't enough to deter me from vanquishing the bowl like that dilophosaurus did to Dennis Nedry in the first Jurassic Park. \\n\\nAnother small downside is that it's going to be hard to go back to a Chipotle. JJ's Grille offers such tasty ingredients that it makes the competition seem banal. Also, there's only one location on Curry Ford at the moment. It's within reasonable driving distance for me, but there needs to be one at the corner of every block. Sadly, that's not the universe we live in. Oh well.

The cooking method involves poaching the chicken whole in non-boiling water until it is fully cooked. It is usually shocked in cold water in order to firm up the skin. The resulting product is a tender, moist chicken with firm and bouncy skin without being overly oily. \\n\\nWhen ordering, you can choose from a variety of meats that they have over rice. The rice is drizzled with a seasoned soy sauce, then topped with the meat(s) of your choice, and that is topped with a ginger/scallion mixture. Keep in mind that the meats are cooled. When dining in, you also get a small bowl of soup which usually seems to be made from the leftover chicken necks and feet. Great simple broth that goes along well with the rice dishes. \\n\\nWhen craving a good plate of chicken and rice, this is definitely the one place that I'd like to come to for simple home-like cooking.

Totally my fault, it was very light, just a love tap, but was totally not on purpose, no scratches at all. I had a beat up van that I was borrowing from  a friend from Canada and the car in front of me was not that nice either. Well someone that worked in the place came out and started yelling at me calling me fucking retart, a moron, saying i was slaming both cars in front and behind me and just was so degrading in the name calling.  I didnt know he worked there, I thought it was his car behind me, I said sorry, and there is no need to talk to me like that. Plus I did not hit the car behind me, my back wheel was stuck on the curb behind me and was impoossible to hit behind me. He just felt like being macho, saw me tap the car in front of me and wanted to prove his point me. Well another girl that worked there came out and start yelling at my girlfriend becasue she was telling the guy to not be so rude and nasty about it.She was yelling go back to fucking canada you assholes, ( Im not from Canada, I live right down the street) and (going to tell everyone in my neighborhood about this ) Long story short, they were completely nasty and agrressive to us and didnt even give me the chance to say I was stuck because of that stupid telephone pole was so close to the curb and that I was sorry bout the bump on the car.   The girl that worked there got in my girlfriends face like she wanted to hit her. I should have called the cops. I took a video of it all and how the guy and girl acted that work at this place.  Im posting on youtube after I talk to the owner about this. You can google AZTEC WILLIES WORKERS RAGE ON ME CALLING US NAMES.

I've tried a solid cross-section of their menu over the past 6 years and this place is mediocre at best.  \\n\\nTheir pizza isn't bad, but it's nothing special.  The cheese seeps off too much oil. The crust is bland compared to the sweet, buttery, or doughy alternatives at other places in the area.  The sauce has a nice sweetness to it, but beyond that lacks any real flavor.  I prefer the pizza at the First Sandwich shop over on Main street in Walpole, Jimmy's in Walpole, or Giorgios in Norwood although I'm not familiar with a pizza place on the Dedham side of things.  \\n\\nTheir salads are small and sparse.  Given the size and quality you can get a lot more bang for your buck at the Lambert's Market just up the street on Rte 1.\\n\\nTheir cold cut sandwiches are TERRIBLE! The meat itself tastes cheap and flavorless.  If the bread isn't toasted you can tell that it's stale. The tomatoes tend to be mealy, and they don't appear to have olive oil, only cheap Italian dressing.  If you want a real sandwich you can do better at Vincenzos in Dedham Center, the Salem Food Market in Dedham center, or at Lamberts.\\n\\nThe wraps I've had from here have tended to be poorly constructed and also use a very cheap tasting salad dressing instead of an actual sauce.  They have the worst Tzatziki sauce in the area, and their buffalo sauce isn't very flavorful.\\n\\nTheir french fries tend to be soggy with a grainy center.  \\n\\nThe mayonnaise they use isn't terrible, but they seem to use way too much of it.\\n\\nThe steak and cheese is similar to the low grade meat they used to serve back in grade school.  Once again, the stale, flavorless bread doesn't help them here.\\n\\nThey do make a decent Chicken Parm Sub.  The breading on the chicken combined with the sweet tomato sauce works very well for this item.  The bread is slightly toasted so it has a bit more taste to it.\\n\\nI've always found the staff to be either outright rude, ambivalent, or unprofessional.  It's just a sandwich place though, and I tend to end up there during the lunchtime rush so this is generally forgivable.  If this is something you value I've found the folks at Vincents in Norwood Center or the folks at Salem Food Market to be very friendly and great at what they do."},{"name":"Crazy Buffet","address":"7038 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Mean manager..i talk  to here im not\\nDone talking and speak to her server and speak\\nChinese ..salty food bad customer service never come back"},{"name":"The Ginger Man","address":"148 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"SO many beers on tap here.

We arrived at around 0900 on a Wednesday morning and were seated right away. The seating can be a little cozy, but not too tight between tables. We were seated and given their menu. Water was readily available on the table. \\nThey are a family style restaurant. The dishes are meant to be shared. And the food comes out as they are ready, instead of all at once. I like this concept because it means the food comes out hot and fresh, instead of waiting for all the dishes to be ready. \\nWe ordered two dishes: Korean Fried Chicken and the Tasty Steak & Cheddar Eggs. Both we extremely good. The Korean fried chicken had a kick of spice with it. It came with rice, chicken, kimchi, cucumbers, and an egg. Definitely shareable. The chicken was perfectly cooked and marinated. It wasn't too spicy either. \\nThe Tasty Steak & Cheddar Eggs dish was also extremely good. It came with three pieces of steak which were cooked nicely. There wasn't too much flavor on the steak. But regardless, the rest of the dish made up for it. The eggs were nice and fluffy with the cheese on top. But my favorite part of the dish was the cornbread pancake under. It was definitely the best thing I ate in Portland during my trip.

It's quite extensive (albeit expensive), and everything is very, very fresh.  They also have an impressive wine list.\\n\\nHowever, service does not improve once you're sitting down.  We ordered appetizers and waited about 45 minutes for them.\\n\\nOnce they arrived I was also disappointed with the food.

Conclusion: they're horribly overrated.  The bread came out burnt (literally, the bottom was black) and nearly impossible to eat.  And when I went at the lobster with a fork, I found it was dry and tasted old and slightly sour.\\n\\nAnd when I was asked, \\"how is it?\\" and I told them, the bartenders response was, \\"Oh,\\" and she walked away.

This was followed with an excellent spinach salad, I just wish the side dressing had been warmer.

The menu is way too over priced for the food. I've ordered exactly what I ordered in a restaurant in New Orleans paid about $15 less there --- $15 LESS! I ordered food when I got there instead of over the phone because I wanted to see how the place looked before getting food. It's funky, the atmosphere definitely screams NOLA. So after ordering, I waited a long time. I knew I was going to wait because I didn't call ahead but I didn't expect to wait that long. I was there for about 35 mins. When the bartender noticed I was getting agitated, she went to ask about the food. She then tells me my food went in after the large party and that the party didn't tell them it was going to be 15 people instead of 8 or 9. I also asked her if the seafood gumbo was made in house. It's not. They send the recipe to a factory and have them make it. I spent $50, when I could of spent about $35, $40 the most. I'm not trying to sound cheap but if I'm going to spend $50, it better be worth every penny. I also don't live far so I expected the food to still be hot by the time I got there. It wasn't hot at all. It was warm as if it sat in the window waiting for the rest of the order to be ready. The fries were soggy. I worked in restaurants for about 8 years as a cook/ supervisor.

But interest, and dare I say desire, for what was to come next.\\n\\nAh, but here was where the cracks in your beautiful veneer began to surface.  What I suspect may have been your true colors started to peer though.  Your bocadillo was disappointing, at best.  Oh, the serrano and manchego were tasty, no doubt, but overpowered by the chewy and bland baguette.  It's a rookie sandwich mistake, too much bread and not enough middle, but one that can ruin an otherwise promising relationship.  And to think, the whole thing could have been saved by a nice flavorful spread or even a strategic toasting of the baguette.  It's a pity, I truly thought we were getting somewhere.  \\n\\nYou could perhaps have recovered with a well-placed side dish, but not only did the giant cold chunks of redskin potato covered in flavorless mayonnaise not win back my heart, it may have ruined any chance we had at something special.  You see, a potato salad should be flavorful and tasty, not bland and boring like my grandmother's.  And really, there is no better way to derail a blossoming romance than memories of grandma.  \\n\\nIn all, dear Barcelona, I appreciated the effort.  I may decide to give you another chance someday if I'm in the neighborhood and all my old standbys are busy.  I hope you know that you have plenty to offer someone.  You're great, you're just really not what I need right now.  No hard feelings, please.  It's not you, it's me.  \\n\\nWell, it's probably you.  And that potato salad, which I can't seem to erase from my memory.\\n\\nBest of Luck,\\nJessica"},{"name":"Gin Thai Brasserie","address":"3176 NW 185th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have ordered from Gin Thai twice via Amazon restaurants.

One of them was a very profound life changing experience at Neptune Oyster. I was eager to check out this place because they offer a plethora selection of oysters and raw seafood. Including my favorite crab claws. I've never tried razor clams and this place seems like the best place for first try. Razor clams was delicious with a mild kick. Surprisingly thought that it will be closer to scallop texture but it is definitely similar to octopus now that I've tried it. I also can not pass on grilled octopus when they're on the menu and they serve it with so many different flavors I highly recommend this dish for everyone. Was not so stocked on crab claws but I'm ready to let it go. \\n\\nI couldn't decide on which entree to try. But, I choose the Neptune burger to my surprise (I came for seafood, but opted for cow instead?) with fried oysters with the help of our waitress recommending it as the best burger around town. Holy cow! She wasn't lying. It was hands down the best burger I've had in the east coast. If you read my previous reviews, Yaks's on the 5th burger on the west coast is pretty high up on that list as well. The Neptune burger patty was cooked to medium rare perfection, juicy about 2inch high patty, covered with melted cheddar cheese. Buns melt in my mouth and I suddenly forgot where I am.

Spalla's Italian Beef has moved out. This guy who tries to look and act like a chef behind the counter clearly pirated Spalla's business. A yelper said he 'adopted' their menu. Not adopted, the term is pirated. He doesn't know the first thing about a Chicago style hotdog or Italian Beef, which is a Chicago staple. \\n\\n**LATE ENTRY: Within minutes of me posting my review, a Yelper by the name of Brian K sent me an insulting comment, and an equally insulting, exhaustive, and at times, contradictory message. He proceeded to leave a five-star, vague review for the business to counteract my review. So this further proves my point that this guy is a total scam artist and is very defensive about people calling him out for what he did. Brian K claims in his message to me to work 35 hours a week at this business. So if this is not a fake profile of the owner himself, then he has his employees harassing people who give negative Yelp reviews. **\\n\\n**3/16/18, I received this highly inappropriate and sexually explicit message from a fake profile that clearly comes from either the owner or someone close to the owner. Since the owner is Russian, I find it interesting that he attacks me for being American and for being female. Not a good business plan, Alex. Tisk Tisk\\n\\nBut other people have messaged me to say that they received harassing messages after leaving a poor review. This is the message sent to me:\\n\\nPerhaps next time you decide to trash someone's reputation on yelp, which is nothing more than some whiny cunts site for letting out their frustrations over a meal, I suggest you review all the other posts about the place. Which in this case happens to be all 4 and 5 stars. This man is at work at 5 am daily and leaves late 7 days a week. Sometimes its best to just let something go. You look like nothing more than a sexless pissed off spoiled American bitch that goes out of her way to insult and criticize. I bet you could find fault with a new stack of 100 dollar bills because they smell fresh. Next time you prepare a meal, which by the looks of all the time you spend online complaining, is probably never. Let me know. Ill bring over a thousand guests and we can criticize you and post for the world to read. I'm sending you a pit bull and a tub of my home made peanut butter. Maybe that will settle you down. The Im sure you will find fault with that as well.**\\n\\nThis is a cheap imitation. Anyone can order a case of Vienna hotdogs, and have it shipped. But if you don't have any part of a business that built itself on a tradition from another region that you know nothing about, then that screams desperation. I will give him some credit to at least serve all beef hotdogs. However, I am sure that once he sees the cost difference, he will soon be serving cheaper franks.\\n\\nI am from Chicago. And I was very entrenched in the Eastern European culture there. I was never impressed with what this guy offered. He was overpriced to begin with in regards to the imported grocery items sold at the store. And the food was never great. I would rather go to Brookline or all the way out to Springfield for better stuff.\\n\\nSo, look at the reviews here on Yelp. This guy gets a little over a dozen reviews over hmmmm, how many years in business? Most of the great reviews were in regards to Spalla's, which was a different business at his location. The rave reviews were not about his food. Now, in the last couple weeks, there are a couple of his buddies that he gets to put positive reviews about the Spalla's products that he is trying to imitate under his business? I don't think so. \\n\\nHe was hurting. That's why he rented out the space to begin with. Culinary Delights was a failing business. Then Spalla's comes in and blows him away. They have 170 great Yelp reviews and were featured on Phantom Gourmet. I detect a little jealousy.

I explained to her that this was not the first time that I had found a hair.  The first time I was dining in so they made me a new salad.  This time, I had taken my order to go and was in the building across the street, but that I would like a full refund instead.

I think the owner should speak with me, because I have been unfairly treated.  If a customer decides that they prefer to not have a do-over on the meal and would just like a refund, I think that it should be honored without repeatedly insulting the customer.

Yeah, the mix was weird, but I think that might have been the fault of an independently contracted DJ. I didn't personally try the food (because I kept hearing that it was nasty and watched people eating icky things and never found the food to try it anyway). \\n\\nI did, however, experience mind-blowing bar service and continuously sampled appallingly awful drinks. There were 4-5 \\"bartenders\\" behind the main bar the whole time and a bar back walked through from time to time. The bar was not slammed. Everyone was being polite. This was not a bar where people are elbowing other people out of the way and shouting their orders. There were moments when not one of these ladies were making drinks or taking orders--long, long moments. What were they doing? Looking at things, waiting in line to use the one credit card machine, accidentally selecting the wrong picture on the touch screen and then taking their time so as not to make the same mistake again. \\n\\nOne person was closing out her tab and the \\"bartender\\" picks up a stack of cards that she begins the slow shuffle through the cards. \\"What color is it?\\" \\"Can you spell your name again?\\" OMG!\\n\\nI decided to not let them hold my card, I had to say not start a tab twice (maybe things would move faster if you didn't require repetition of everything). When she gives me my card and the receipt to sign, there are people who have been waiting maybe 20 or so minutes for a drink, does she take a drink order? NO! She stands there and watches me sign. She looks away while another \\"bartender\\" picks up the receipt and then turns back to ask me, TWICE, where the receipt is. \\n\\nI didn't trust them to mix more than 2 ingredients together.

The quality of ingredients and flavor of the food is on point. The portions are perfect. The atmosphere is relaxed and humble.\\n\\n My number one issue is the food is never consistently hot throughout. Kind of like the experience one has when they put food in the microwave and the center is cold but the areas surrounding are hot... Which is not the experience you want to have when the food is supposed to be fresh. I've eaten here 3 times and unfortunately this has been the case every time. \\n\\nMy second issue is they ask you where you're going to sit. It feels awkward every time and I'm sure many people feel this way considering the first thing most people do when they enter is go to the line. And who the hell knows where they're going to sit? Then you have to make the call quickly and it just feels weird. I work at a restaurant where we make small notated descriptions of people to go along with their name to locate them. It takes a second to jot down and we rarely have issues locating people. Even a number on a stand would be better than having to quickly declare where you're going to sit.\\n\\nMy 3rd recommendation is a little less serious but I feel like a single piece of garlic bread should come with the pasta and the pasta/salad combo. I want to order garlic bread every time I go there but I always go alone and paying $6 for that experience is not something I'm willing to do. Complimentary bread is usually an integral part of any elevated pasta experience. Maybe a small upcharge for a single piece?

I can't say that this place is particularly spectacular but it gets the job done with a mostly satisfying bowl of pho. If you get the x-large you get a very generous amount of noodles and it's very filling whereas the large isn't quite enough for me usually. I wish their broth is hotter when it comes because the beef doesn't cook that well when it's rare since their broth is just warm. My favorite is to get beef balls and then beef slices on the side since I like to handle how well each slice is cooked (but this doesn't actually work out that well in reality because like I said, the broth isn't hot enough). This option is slightly more expensive though. There is really no depth or richness to the broth and it's clearly just a lot of artificial flavoring but I'm okay with that for what it is. It comes usually pretty quickly too."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"After visiting the Old State House- we needed to eat.

By itself. \\n\\nThe shrimp ceviche was nothing special. Typically I'm expecting a heavy citrus bite when it comes to ceviche. The dish that I was given came a little watery. The shrimp were definitely boiled before hand instead of being cooked by any citric acid like lime or lemon.

We arrived and had no reservation. We were seated I would say within 2-3 mins. There weren't many people in the restaurant however, I wouldn't call it empty if that makes sense. \\n\\nDrink orders were taking and we all decided to get alcoholic beverages especially because the prices were fairly affordable for cocktails. I was impressed to see they had a full bar menu and some creative libations. I got the special manhattan. \\n\\nThe menu can be a little intimidating at first but just remember dinner special has about a quarter of meat included (example: 1/4 ribs, 1/4 brisket etc...) this is enough for someone who just wants an individual meal and only wants one meat. \\n\\nWe ordered the following \\n\\nBrisket Dinner and added 1/4 baby backs for an additional cost. For sides Pinto beans and mac & cheese. \\n\\nPulled pork dinner with mac & cheese and collard greens for sides. \\n\\nI chose the Barbecue Belt! Which is a large portion of beef and pork ribs, sausage, brisket and sides mac and cheese & collard greens.\\n\\nThe meat is was all very flavorful and cooked extremely well. The two sauces on the table sweet BBQ and Hot BBQ are very good. The Hot has a sharp bite that sneaks up on you.

No problems getting the food packed up and we got extra BBQ sauce to take with us. I think it was worth it. \\n\\nWhy I don't give it 5 stars:\\n\\nCollard greens were cooked to the right consistency but they were kind of bland and I ended up having to add my own seasoning when I went home. They would do well with adding smoked turkey and garlic/onion powder.\\n\\nMac and Cheese I'd give 2.5/5.

Even though the line was pretty long, they have servers running the line to kind of guide you through the menu and choosing what you would like and to answer any questions. After we ordered, we sat down and waited about 20 minutes for our food. \\nI ended up getting the pasta and salad combo with the great Leopold pasta and patrizi's salad. We also ordered some garlic bread. The salad was a pretty standard Italian restaurant salad. The garlic bread was amazing though. There was drizzled olive oil (?) And cheese on it along with confit garlic. There was a nice amount of chew to the bread, the oil wasnt soaked all the way through and the cheese and confit garlic on top added a really nice touch. The pasta was slightly disappointing though. When it came out, it was a bit smaller than I was expecting, although I knew it was a half order. I dont know if it was because I finished my other food first before starting the pasta, but it was a little too al dente for me and the noodles were a little hard and stuck together. The sauce was pretty good.

We walked in and were unsure we were in the right place - honestly, the place looked like a weird family restaurant that you might go to for breakfast.  Generic looking booths abounded, and there were hardly any signs that this was actually an Indian restaurant.\\n\\nLuckily things improved from there.\\n\\nThey had Ipswich Ale, which pleased the mister, and the iced tea was quite good.  The menu was really interesting, with some lovely regional specialties that aren't often featured on Boston-area Indian menus.  We decided to share the vegetarian appetizer platter, and I chose the masala dosa for my meal, while the mister went for the vegetarian uttapam pancake.  We topped that off with some garlic naan and raita.\\n\\nThe appetizer was pretty good - one of the things was a little weird, but most were tasty.  We both enjoyed the broccoli immensely.  Then our dishes came, and they were huge - the dosa took up half the table!  It was filled with a spicy potato mix and it had a bit of tang.  Lots of interesting flavors.  The pancake was very peppery and nice.  Both of meals were served with lentil soup and coconut curry.  The soup was delicious and the curry was very strange; I had never had anything like that before, but it was kind of good.  Weird flavors and textures, but not in a bad way.  The naan was downright awesome.\\n\\nThe service wasn't great, and the bathroom was not acceptable.

This woman is an absolute nightmare. The way she berates her employees and exudes sheer malice towards them is shameful. She should retire and either sell her operation or hire someone who is actually competent to run the place.\\n\\nI'd like to preface this next paragraph by stating that I've been a customer of this place for many years and that the food and more specifically, the baking is indeed excellent. I can not however in good conscience continue to support this tyrant. I have observed this troubling behavior now with increasing frequency over the years. The store is very frequently short-staffed as they have great difficulty retaining new staff for more than a couple weeks at a time. The effect this has on the business is glaringly obvious... chronic line-ups, disgruntled service, shabby appearance of the store, declining food quality, the list goes on. Without exaggeration, I've probably seen no less than 3 or 4 dozen new employees working at Solly's that I only ever saw more than once.\\n\\nToday was the final straw for me, and I will never go back again. As I spent 25 minutes in the line TO PAY, I got to hear all kinds of acerbic nonsense flow from this troubled woman's mouth. She was openly complaining to a customer about how hard it is to find employees and she was almost gloating about hiring temporary foreign workers, but that it was frustrating waiting for their visas to come through. When the next shift of staff came in to start, she greeted them by belittling them vocally and getting angry at THEM for the size of the line, demanding they get the line size down (She spent 2 minutes doing that while I stood there, card in hand waiting for her to actually input my order into the till). She also openly complained about the hardships of living in Vancouver, almost as if her company didn't generate $1-5 million annually (from Glassdoor). The irony is there is a large sign posted on one of the coolers telling customers to treat the employees with respect, talk about an empty gesture.\\n\\nI doubt she reads these reviews, but in the off chance that happens, here's some advice.\\n\\nA. Stop being a miserable b****. \\nB. Hire a freaking manager.\\nC. Stop micro-managing your staff and treat them with respect! Without them you wouldn't be able to operate your business. I'm just speculating here but I can guess you should probably pay them more too.\\nD. Stop complaining. You're a millionaire.\\nE.

My wife and I were both doing a keto themed diet, so I ended up with a scramble called Ed's plate Which had spinach, mushrooms, garlic and cheese. I added some meat to it and it was quite the treat! My better half had a Nor'wester scramble -a smoked salmon, green onions and cream cheese egg dish. It was phenomenal!

I had just dined at Big Fin in Orlando about three weeks ago & enjoyed it tremendously went back and had an absolutely terrible experience and the manager Josh Quijano was absolutely an inadequate representation of management. I ordered the Alaskan King crab specifically told my server that I wanted the long leg and not the claw and of course that's not what I received. He brings out the claw so my wife's food is now here and mine is not...(eating separately is not the way to celebrate a birthday, let alone a dinner) I also ordered the lobster mac & cheese and ...wait for it...there was literally no lobster in it but there was PORK chunks and not any lobster to be seen. I pointed these things out which of course stretched out my meal as the Mgr took it back the  have that now remade...at this point I lost my appetite for the most part. Josh gave me the impression he was going to make things right and I showed him that my lobster had no lobster in it (when he brings it out this time with lobster he said the chef normally puts 3 ounces of lobster in it I had him add 4 ounces I hope that makes you feel better. And I said I just showed you that was zero lobster in it so if the chef says he normally puts 3 ounces you saw there was no lobster in it)  He said maybe it was shredded in it (REALLY.!?!) What lobster mac & cheese does not actually have the chunks or obvious pieces of lobster in it? None that I've ever had from capital Grille, Ruth Chris and others. And I just had Big Fin's lobster mac & cheese 3 weeks ago and it was plenty of lobster in it. Then as a gesture he brings out a dessert that we didn't order sings to me happy birthday and when the bill came and he still basically charge me for everything after I basically lost my appetite for, I told him that was unacceptable to take just 25% off the bill. His response was \\"I took off the desert and I gave you 25% off\\". But I NEVER ordered dessert so why would you act as if you're doing me a favor taking off what I never asked for? He then took the bill again made me wait about 10 minutes just for him to come back with 3 more dollars off. I would've gave him $12.00 not to sit around for 10 minutes waiting for him. I told him that there are too many nice restaurants in this area for him to make me feel as though I need to quibble over a few dollars when the right thing to do would've been to shake my hand and say we are removing your lobster mac & cheese and your crabs from your bill because we botched up both of them and stretched you out to eat alone while your wife is watching you... he should have said \\"just pay for your wife's meal and your beverages\\"... I told him I had less issue at other Restaurants and they respected my business and did a lot more...@ Capital Grill the manager AND the chef came out and apologized when I had ONE bad experience with my meal, shook my hand and said don't worry about your meal (The chef even gave us his telephone number and said let him know whenever we're coming back he will personally make sure our meal experience is always phenomenal. We've been back there many times and the chef comes out, shakes our hands and has always made us feel like our business matters) . As a result we've been going back to Capital Grille on a regular basis because that's how you treat a customer if you want to keep their business. What Josh did has made it clear that we should not come back to Big Fin anytime soon, if ever at all. Big fin is fine if everything goes right but woe onto you if you get a bad experience. I recommend if you're looking for a quality meal go to Ruth Chris, Charlie's, or Capital Grill because they care not just about your money but your experience."},{"name":"Com Vietnamese Grill Restaurant","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I was here a couple of days ago and would definitely like to come back!

At the prices these guys are charging, you will be poor and still hungry when you leave here. The Caesar salad doesn't really qualify as a salad and for $9, they must have made $8.50 off of it. It was 3 really skinny pieces of cold toast with a whopping 1 romaine lettuce leaf and 1 really small piece of ham layered with 2 anchovies and Parmesan cheese shaved on top. It was like a lettuce napoleon. Since I don't eat grains, I paid a lot for a leaf of lettuce and a bit of ham. My husband got the gumbo for $8. Another really small portion, but it tasted ok. The other people with us both got the burgers with chips. Chips were not that good and they ended up just eating the burger because the buns were strange. If you substituted fries for the chips, it makes it a $16 burger.  Drink pours were small and pricey. Go for Happy Hour and all draft beers are 50% off.\\n2 ladies next to us got the chop house salad (I didn't order it because it sounded strange with cucumber puree and peach vinegar.) From the looks on their faces when they tasted it, I had avoided something terrible. I guess it was better to get one leaf of lettuce that tasted good over what they ordered.

As a north end resident I understand that it's expensive living downtown, but monicas has gotten worse and worse. They've upped their prices by at least 20% while seriously decreasing their portion size and quality. I'd look towards a place like bricco (the deli) on Hanover which a 2 min walk away. Their sandwiches are comparable and about half the price. And on top of all of that you don't have to wait 30 minutes for a sandwich like you do at Monica's if you don't call ahead.

We tried the Pad Ka Prow, Om Gai, and Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango. Additionally, we ordered two Thai teas. Everything was good.\\n\\nUpon ordering we were told there would be a 30 minute wait for food, but that they could text us when it was ready. This was no big deal as the bar next door had live music out on their patio. The menu included Thai Coffee, but when we tried to order it they stated that they were still figuring out how to make coffee, so we ended up ordering the tea instead. \\n\\nI adore Thai Tea (as well as coffee) and Dee Dee's was no exception. I could happily slam two of those bad boys in a 20 minutes span before blissfully drifting off into a diabetic comma. *Fair warning if you've never had Thai coffee or tea before, it's made with sweetened condensed milk and can be quite sugary*\\n\\nThey asked how hot we wanted the food and told us that by default everything is Thai spicy. We were a bit anxious about the heat level, but being the good Texas hot sauce lovers that we are, we told them to go for it. Spice varies so much by restaurant that it's hard to gauge what you're actually going to get and Thai food can be some of the spiciest in the world. The \\"Thai Spicy\\" at Tuk Tuk nearly burned my face off (that papaya salad I ate purely out of principle)(I will not be defeated! Muahahaha), at Dee Dee -- not so much. \\n\\nWhen our food arrived (a fare bit faster than the estimated 30 minutes -- yay), we found it pleasantly spicy, but well balanced. The fresh basil and chili in the Pad Ka Prow added such a great flavor. The moisture and fat from the meat were complimented with the perfect amount of rice underneath. The fried egg was lovely and ran when we cut into it's center adding another later of unctuousness, while the cucumber slices were a cool clean counterpoint. \\n\\nThe Om Gai was slightly tamer, less spicy, but also much healthier. It consisted of a fragrant broth served with chicken and herbs. It had very clean light flavors that made me wish I had tasted it before the fattier spicier Pad Ka Prow. We were also given a rice cake to dip into the broth, but we didn't eat it as we wanted to save valuable stomach real estate for dessert. \\n\\nThe dessert was ready about 10 minutes after our entrees (great timing). When done right, mango and sweet sticky rice is one of my favorite desserts in the world. Dee Dee did it justice. The sweet coconut rice was like a warm gooey hug for my mouth. The mango was ripe and provided a juicy tartness to the dish. I could eat this every day. So good. \\n\\nOverall, Dee Dee is in the upper echelon of trailer food.

Disclaimer: I prefer New Mexican or Oaxacan cuisine; I also don't like entrees that are soupy and gooey. \\n\\nWe have a dear friend that now lives in Providence, Rhode Island. She used to live in the Denver area, and is still infatuated with this Mexican restaurant in Boulder. It is always at the very top of her to-do list when she visits, so we usually make the trek with her.\\n\\nBob and I have been there three times. It is extremely popular with Boulderites. Always expect at least a 30-60 minute wait time.The restaurant has won Boulder's People's Choice Award for Best Mexican Restaurant 10 years in a row! Located at Arapahoe and 63rd, it feels closer to Lafayette than Boulder.¬† There are two other Efrain's locations, one in Longmont and one in Lafayette. All family related, but they make a point that it is not a chain.\\n\\nThey specialize in Northern Mexican, specifically Chihuahuan, cuisine. The red chili is extremely hot. The pork green chili is much milder, but still has a kick.¬† \\n\\nI have tried both their steak chimichanga, and the popular \\"Efrain\\" burrito.¬† I prefer the chimichanga between the two. The \\"Efrain\\" is a Chef's Choice burrito the changes daily. However, both times that I had it, it seemed to be a mixture of chicken and pork. For most dishes you are asked which of the two chilis you would like. You can also ask for half and half, or Christmas style.\\n\\nOur friend loves their green chili so much, that she usually takes a couple quarts home with her that she freezes at our house before she puts it on the plane. \\n\\nThey have a waiting room to help with the wait time you can expect. However, most of the time you are subject to the over-flow area which is outside of the restaurant in a makeshift patio near the parking lot. They keep the customers happy by allowing them to buy margaritas. They are decent margaritas, but pretty expensive. We ordered a middle-shelf pitcher, and it was $32 -- a little pricey to be drinking it outside on cement benches.\\n\\nOn the flip side, the food is extremely affordable! Aside from the fajitas, the most expensive entree is $12.50. They also do a great job of labeling the heat factor by rating each entree on a scale from 1 to 10. The guacamole is extremely fresh and hearty.\\n\\nI found it disappointing that they are proud of disclaiming that they do not use lard, and they use lean pork. Personally, I feel this is where the flavor is lacking.\\n\\nInside, the decor is pretty run-of-the-mill. Without knowing that it is a Mexican restaurant, you would assume that it was a greasy spoon/truck stop in the middle of Nebraska.¬† \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I will probably be back, mostly because our friend will drag us there every time she comes to town. :)"},{"name":"Jalapeno Charlie's","address":"218 Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Probably the worst service I have ever received.

Parking is a bit of a challenge. We had to drive around the neighborhood a few times  to find street parking nearby. Every weekend there are tons of people waiting outside to get a taste of their outstanding breakfast dishes. To give you an idea of wait times, we got there around 9:30 am on Sunday and waited about an hour. So the main question becomes- is it worth the wait? In my opinion, I believe it is worth the wait because  the service is very friendly, the food is  delicious and the prices are reasonable. I love that they provide complimentary coffee while you are waiting for your table. The prices are very reasonable considering how popular this restaurant is. I was surprised that the biscuits and gravy were only $8 and if you just want 1 biscuit with gravy it is only $5. The sausage gravy is also so good. Most of the main breakfast dishes range on average from about $10 - $14. We really enjoyed their special which was Eggs Benedict with smoked pork belly. The pork belly was juicy and full of great flavor. The Huevos Rancheros with pulled pork was also great. It had just the right amount of cheese and pork. I think it could have used a little more salsa or spices to give it more flavor but I still really loved it. I asked for the eggs to be poached and they were made perfectly. They do have specialty coffees too like mochas and lattes as well alcoholic beverages to choose from. The latte was good but not the best I've had. The Spicy Mocha was really tasty. As much as I really enjoyed this restaurant I probably wouldn't  go often just because it is a long wait. Having said this I still highly recommend trying it out.

The few items I'm missing are those little Konyakku noodle bundles, more seafood (no prawns, oysters cost $1 each).. I can't remember what else, but it wasn't too much of a big deal.  I don't remember seeing eggs on the menu, even as an add-on.. perhaps it has become a bit of a liability to serve raw eggs to customers?  Not sure! \\n\\nThey also have a little sauce cart with a few sauces: satay sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, and peanut sauce, and chili oil.  But they didn't have any other items such as green onions, garlic, coriander...ahh well.  \\n\\nService was a bit slow, it was kinda tough to flag people down to get things like extra bowls, water, etc. \\n\\nBut a few other plusses is that the soup was refilled with soup broth, instead of just water.

It's right there on the menu. These are the rules set in place, and I think we can all understand why. The option to have queso drizzled on your taco is pretty terrific. That being said, the sad truth is that many of these reviews are correct in pointing out a disappointing blandness. The food is fresh as one would expect from the creators of P Terry's, aka the best dang burger joint in town, but the flavors don't reel me in. For instance, I just munched down a breakfast taco containing fluffy scrambled eggs, and crispy bacon on a corn tortilla, and all I could think was that the egg/ bacon ratio was either off, or the eggs were overly bland, or the fresh salsa was under-salted. To be honest I couldn't put my finger on it. \\n\\nThe good news is the place is attractive (of course). It's located in the same place where the Taco Cabana used to live here near campus. It's got that zesty Mid-Century vibe that makes me smile, and they have Ruta Maya coffee, eggs and meat that aren't scary, and service with a smile. I imagine it's not an easy thing to offer \\"on point\\" fast food Tex Mex in a town like this. You hear Austin dwellers argue over burgers, and tacos all of the time, but the truth is, we've got some real taco experts in and around these parts.

No matter what time you go here you are going to experience this wait time and that is a testament to the restaurant and its loyal customers that they love the food and service so much we all wait these obscene wait times.

Scallop crudo? Light, simple, and delicious. Ricotta Crostini with hazelnuts, rosemary, and honey? Unbelievably good.\\n\\nNow let's talk pasta. I can't believe how good the pasta was. Pappardelle with short rib, madeira, and horseradish? Absolutely unbelievable. The horseradish was subtle but added so much depth to the dish.

The place is consistent, I'll say that. The coffee is always average, but the food is usually decent, just basic diner food. The service, however, is consistently spotty. My experience has been that there's a longer than normal wait to get someone to take your order, and the food always seems to take a bit longer than it should. However, today's experience is the worst breakfast experience I've had in any restaurant in my entire life. \\n\\nI put my name in for a table for 2 at 9am. We waited a half an hour to be seated. When the waitress asked us if we wanted coffee, we also were ready with our order, so put that in too. Two other tables for two were seated a few minutes after us. We ordered at least 5 minutes before both of them, but they somehow got their food and were finished their entire meals before we got our meals. At first, the waitress kept telling us that our order would be out soon, but after 40 minutes, we were getting annoyed. Then the waitress and the manager told us that the delay was caused by a large take-out order. But that doesn't explain how TWO tables that ordered AFTER us got their meals regardless of the take out order. No discount was offered by the manager, just shrugged shoulders and basically an \\"Oops! We had a large take out order in front of yours, so...\\" Totally unacceptable. I like supporting local businesses, but I like it when they will at least admit they made a mistake and take responsibility for it.

You tick off the boxes from a piece of paper and the staff basically bring you your raw meat, tofu, and fish.  They bring the big pot, light up the gas stove and after that point you're basically on your own.\\n\\nAnd that includes getting out of your seat and going over to the center of the restaurant where you grab your own sauce bowl and pour your own mixture of soya, hot, and vinegar dipping sauce.  The funny thing here(and maybe not too unexpected of places like this) is the sense where - if this was your first time here and you didn't know any better...you might not have known to do this.  Unless of course you looked around and saw everyone else getting something from the center and you put two-and-two together on what you're expected to do.\\n\\nI know this is probably a \\"well duh\\" moment for many of you, but understand that non-Asian cultures might not think to do this...and the restaurant staff certainly doesn't tell you, either.\\n\\nAs with any other hot pot place, you get a split between spicy and normal broth, where you cook your food within.  They'll refill the broth every now and then and as this is a communal experience, you put your meat, your dumplings, your fish, and everything else within to cook.  As expected some of the *extremely* thin meat slices cook within seconds.\\n\\nCompared against other hot pot places(and keeping in line with other Mongolian hot pot restaurants), the pricing here is more expensive compared against say, Chinese hot pot.  So - do the higher prices here get you superior cuts of meat and other items?  Does the quality merit the higher price(we're not talking about service, we already know not to expect exemplary service from an Asian place, right)?\\n\\nYes - but don't order the AYCE(All You Can Eat) menu.  That's a trap.  You are better off just ordering and paying off of the full menu, where you'd be getting access to everything and paying maybe just a little more.\\n\\nAll in all, not bad, but like any other hot pot experience, come here with a big group.

I've been to this specific location a few times as I live nearby. It's well-lit, spacious, and after recent renovations, the seating is more comfortable than before. \\n\\nSome highlights for me:\\n-the Caesars here are absolutely delicious and a good balance of Worcestershire sauce, pickle brine, horseradish and Clamato juice. On Sundays and during happy hour, they're $5.50 too which is a decent deal \\n-they have a giant screen behind the bar and TVs pretty much everywhere you look\\n-service is fairly attentive and food comes out in a timely manner \\n-the happy hour drinks specials are awesome.

The bar had plenty of seats and the bartenders were so friendly. \\n\\nWe had to order everything at the bar, and our food came out to us quickly.

Yet there was not a lot of people there at all so the atmosphere was pretty dead.

They were both so delicious- the papaya salad was so fresh and light on a brutally hot day, and the Pad Ka Pow was a serious kick of heat (when we added the extra hot sauce.) \\n\\nWe wanted to try the mango rice but they said they weren't able to get good mango that day, but we're looking forward to trying it next time.\\n\\nI was so happy they had La Croix as a beverage option, not just soda or water. \\n\\nOkay, I'm already getting hungry again just writing this.

I'd have to say yes and yes. I came here around 1:30 P.M. on a Monday afternoon and was told that the wait will be about 1 1/2 hours. If I wanted to wait, the staff will take my name and number and call when they're ready for me. There were attractions and stores in the area I wanted to check out anyway, so keeping busy until then was not a problem.\\n\\nAfter the anticipated wait, I was seated at the bar, close to where a staff member was shucking oysters in the open. The server who serviced me was approachable and seemed to enjoy his job. I ordered the Neptune Johnnycake and Hot Maine Lobster Roll. Both dishes are mouth-watering and I highly recommend getting both. The seafood in both dishes tasted very fresh. How can this Johnnycake be so crisp on the outside, soft and smooth on the inside, and have the perfect combination of sweet and savory? It's unreal and unlike anything I've tasted before. As for the Lobster Roll, I loved how the butter melted on the hot lobster and brioche. It was the perfect amount of saltiness.

Mine was filled with toppings and I was full after 3 slices!

We had a large group of 9 ready to eat ASAP! The pizzas smelled so good and they were cleaning off their large tables for us. We weren't informed that we had to grab our own paper menus since we sat around waiting for about 20 minutes to be acknowledged! Then a waitress finally came over and expected us to be READY with our drink orders. Ahem except we didn't have a drink menu. She seemed annoyed and handed us a single clipboard drink menu to pass around the table of 9. We ordered the Captain America and Jon Snow. Both of them were tasty no doubt. \\n\\nWe placed our orders for the pizzas and waited at least another 40 minutes until they arrived in waves. In the mean time, one of the people in our group ordered a salad and she received her dish about 20 minutes before everyone else so she was nearly done as we just started! Another annoying point was they ran out of almost all of the custom toppings my husband wanted and didn't tell him until other people's pizzas started arriving. Short of an apology they didn't offer him any discount or any consolation for their mistake. He was of course the last to receive his pizza. I ordered their specialty Nick Fury (white sauce / saucer cheese blend / cheddar cheese / mac and cheese / buffalo chicken / bacon / scallion / sriracha). IT WAS AMAZING! Even the day after leftovers were still scrumptious! I loved that the pizza was brimming with toppings that melded together perfectly.  \\n\\nDon't even get me started on the bathroom... it is shared with the cafe next door so there was constantly a LINE for the 4 single stall unisex bathrooms.

There was blood all over the floor. The entire floor was soaked in urine and there was toilet paper everywhere. It was worse than using a bathroom at a pit stop. On my way out of the restroom I peered into the kitchen to see what everyone had been talking about and while everyone is sitting in the dining room eating happily, the kitchen floor was covered in grime and random new and old rotting leaves of lettuce and filthy rags everywhere. I am not a germaphobe at all and I know how crazy the kitchen can get when you've got high volume, but I'm telling you it's possible that this kitchen has literally never been cleaned. When at my table, I quietly asked a waiter to please address the bathroom and he sheepishly said well I don't know when we can clean it because we would need to find one of the women staff to do it. Time passed, nothing happened. Then I asked the runner (a woman) if they could please address how bad the bathroom was and she shrugged and said that it's because they are \\"busy\\".

The 'nduja is a spicy sausage spread and it pairs wonderfully with the sweet corn--definitely a must order and great size for the price.\\n\\nPea salad (3 stars): While the peas and ricotta and pistachios were all great together, I found the greens that they used to be somewhat bitter and not really a great addition to the dish.\\n\\nGarganelli Duck Ragout (3.5 stars): The flavors were almost here with this dish, but I felt that the sauce just lacked that final layer of flavor. The noodles were a fun shape and cooked well and the duck was tender, but it left a little to be desired.\\n\\nSwordfish (4.5 stars): This dish was a great cap to our meal.

I really enjoyed this one because it was so full of flavor.\\n\\nScaloppine Di Vitello Alla Grotta: My boyfriend said this tasted a bit bland to him. This is more of a marsala-based sauce. The veal is just as tender as the veal I ordered. \\n\\nLinguini in Puttanesca: We ordered this side dish of pasta to \\"test\\" out La Grotta's pasta. The puttanesca sauce was good.

Bigger than expected so the seating is nice. Sat with a group, and walked in a bit confused. Place was pretty busy but found ample seating. It is seat yourself but no signs to say that or a hostess to explain that. Also, no one to explain that you have to get your beer order at the bar (cant order from the seat), and sodas and food are sold from another area (of which I spent 15 mins roaming around trying to locate everything). So little confusing to find out about service. Food is all single service items. The food quality and attention to detail is top notch for a brewery tasting room. However, I felt like the place struggles to find an identity between taproom and restaurant.  Beers were ok, I had the philly pizza and truffle fries. The food was better than the food, but my exposure to the beer was limited. However I give 5 out of 5 for going thru the pains of taking my food order to make sure my food was dairy free. However if not for one of the owners personally making sure everything was correct,  there would have been some confusion.  Also, the soda machine looks really cool but the sodas were all watered down and no one at the table liked them much.

It was a celebration dinner for me so of course I wanted everything to be perfect! My experience was lackluster to say the least. \\n\\nWe arrived in time for happy hour (5-7pm) so everyone was ordering $3 appetizers. I ordered calamari. I've never had bad calamari until this place. Its weirdly spongy, has no flavor, and the sauce on top of it added nothing to the taste. It was a waste of a dish.\\n\\nI then ordered the king crab roll ($10). This also was lacking in flavor and texture-wise was uncomfortable to eat. The outside of the crab was covered in something hard and flakey; it felt like I was eating the shell of a shrimp. It was genuinely gross to eat and I didn't finish it.\\n\\nI also ordered a $10 Tropical Martini. This was probably the best thing about the food experience and that's not saying much. It was good but was so strong it was hard to enjoy. Every sip was incredibly strong and sour.

Although I noticed one lady wearing her bathing suit covered in a moo moo*\\nIt was almost 10 PM and we had just sat down.  But our waitress was friendly and apologetic for the wait.

So I can't hold this against the restaurant.  They're service and food is on point.\\n\\nWe started off with freshly baked sourdough bread and butter with sea salt on it.  Then fried calamari served with olives and tomato coulis.  It was light and refreshing and not the typical heavy fried calamari.  We also had a Tilapia ceviche which I've never tried before but it was also great.  We devoured these within minutes and then the fireworks started.

Booking online was super easy and they send a couple emails before the tour with tickets and full meeting details.\\n\\nThe Liberty Hotel was a great meeting spot and such a cool place to start the tour. We all met, signed our contracts (weird, never had to do that on a food tour before. But I understand the liability issues so it was fine), then got a brief history of the hotel before moving downstairs to the Italian restaurant Scampo.\\n\\nWe were seated and treated to a four course meal (plus crispy breadsticks at the table). This was the absolute highlight of the 5 hour tour. Going around the table getting to know everyone, getting a map of each stop, and then getting the absolute tastiest food. We had asparagus soup, tomato and basil salad, two slices of pizza (lobster and classic), then a surprise plate of cookies (where the whole table sang my mom happy birthday--very nice!). After eating we checked out the club Alibi and had a restroom break before continuing.\\n\\nI feel this set my expectations so high! The next stop was Savenor's, a little store with a great history and even better selection of meats. We sampled tiny bites of dry oat cookies with runny jam here and I had a bit of the WTF moment. BUT I was still full from Scampo and excited at the next 4 hours ahead.\\n\\nThe next stop was just a bit further at Beacon Hill Chocolates. LOVED this shop! Very friendly employees, a full sample of the milk chocolate truffle and then half a square of the salted caramel chocolate. Then gelato samples if anyone wanted. I ended up buying some slightly overpriced but very cute dark chocolate cat truffles here and definitely perked up after the sugar rush. (they gave tour attendees a 10% discount which was very nice!)\\n\\nNext stop was Fastachi, an artisanal nut store. We got to sample pistachio butter and a tiny cup of mixed nuts. We then each got gift bags with a nice size pouch of mixed nuts. The chocolate here looked even better than Beacon Hill so I ended up getting even more truffles (really cool that they had vegan truffles!)\\n\\nAs we walked down the street it was sometimes hard to hear our guide Rob or we ended up jaywalking or blocking pedestrians. We were a fairly large group (12 I think?) and Boston sidewalks seemed tiny where we were so this was a slight annoyance. Nothing major but as someone who lives and walks everywhere in DC I hate when tour groups block me from getting where I want to go.\\n\\nThe next stop was Paramount. Where we were told all about the great breakfast foods and ordering and seating style but then all we got was a small plastic cup of orange juice. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious fresh squeezed orange juice but that was it? I felt a bit cheated.\\n\\nWe then had a big walk through the park and a lot of talk about the history of the park and Boston. Even stopping to see the duck statues and even seeing the two Juliet swans. The park was beautiful and really a great addition to the tour!\\n\\nWe did stop at the Taj Hotel to use the restrooms and also get some more history, but this hotel was really run down and the bathrooms were humid and very unpleasant. I don't know if the air wasn't working that day but it was not a fun stop. The flowers in the lobby were nice though! (hey, bright side!)\\n\\nNext up was Bacco's Wine & Cheese where we got a small sample of rose and had to fight over a meat and cheese platter. I was taking my time enjoying my wine when I looked over and saw one sad slice of salami left while other tour members had multiple toothpicks and samples in their hand. Don't people know the Yelp golden rule about waiting for everyone to have a taste before going for seconds? The macaroons were delicious here though and totally worth the hype Rob was giving them. \\n\\nNext up was Flour bakery and cafe. I think by the time we got here the group lost their steam and everyone just wanted to sit in silence. Very weird. Maybe instead of wine we should have all done a shot of espresso? Either was we were treated to delicious chicken, avocado, jicama sandwiches! Generous halves were given to each attendee and it was definitely my 2nd favorite stop after Scampo!\\n\\nThe last stop was Legal Seafoods and it was a bit of a walk. We were seated and then given the choice of clam chowder or bang bang cauliflower. I opted for the cauliflower while my boyfriend got the chowder. Unfortunately we didn't enjoy either so this was a sad way to end. Luckily Rob revealed we each got our own sticky bun from Flour to take home! Definitely saved the day and ended on a high note! \\n\\nAlthough fun, I was expecting a little more since I consider myself a \\"foodie.\\"\\n\\nApparently I've reached my 5000 characters!

There's a row of tables against the wall and a bar on the other side, and about 1.5 feet of space between patrons seated on either side. We went there very early on a Friday evening (around 4pm), and waited no more than 15 minutes before we were seated. The menu isn't exceptionally large, and really the only thing that called out to us was the lobster roll, so we both ordered that with clam chowder to start.\\n\\nThe clam chowder is definitely not the thick, gloopy kind but was very runny. Despite the cream, I would go so far as to describe it as \\"light,\\" with a lot of very chunky, sweet claims and some well-cooked potatoes in it. The flavor was pretty delicious, and we liked it. It's $13/bowl, but with the amount of soup in the bowl as well as the delicious clams, I'd say it was worth it.\\n\\nThe lobster roll was $31, and price-wise, I'd say you get a lot of lobster for that price: it was a very generous helping of lobster, and one of the very few lobster rolls that I finished and said, \\"Dang, I'm full.\\" We both got them with butter rather than mayo. The rolls were soft and buttery and had the perfect texture for a hot lobster roll. The lobster itself was so succulent and sweet, but both of us thought it needed a tiny bit more of seasoning. Maybe this is sacrilege to say, but I think it would've been my favorite lobster roll ever if there was a dash of celery salt on it. As it was served, I'd say the best lobster roll I've ever had has not been unseated from that throne yet. The rolls were served with a huge serving of not super-crunchy but freshly fried, potato-y, yummy fries. I'm not the biggest fan of not-super-crunchy fries, but I liked these. \\n\\nOh, and because I'm strange and care about these things, the water wasn't great. Not that cold and tasted kinda stale.

And beignets deserve a try!"},{"name":"Pizza Mia","address":"915 N Anchor Way","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Witness:  Disgruntled large party at Pizza Mia ( 45 to 60 )  What you are reading from the negative reviews is certainly not the whole story.  Let me shed light from one of the many witnesses who saw the whole thing go down.\\n\\n1.  This huge crowd comes into the restaurant, blocking access for other people to comfortably come in and out of the restaurant.  They were not necessarily loud but they certainly were not considerate to the surroundings.   Most people would have had most of its party wait outside while they figure things out, instead they decided to come in, clog both doors that go in and out, and stand as one huge group.  ( This is a small restaurant, with lots of outside spaces and outside seating. )\\n\\n2.  In a small family style restaurant, it would have been almost impossible to \\"legally\\" seat that big of a crowd inside without creating a fire hazard, which anyone with half a brain could have figured out immediately.    There were too many people seated in the restaurant.  \\n\\n3.  What made things tense was the lack of respect that one of the people had for the manager.  This person felt the need to start moving at least one of the tables.   Albeit not thrashing tables here and there, but he was trying to figure out a way to seat his group, without the managers permission.  After being told not to, clearly the man did not like being told not to move tables so he decided to have a stare down with the manager in what the eyes of a customer looked at as a confrontation.   He made some comments that were certainly not comments that would make anyone feel comfortable.  After hearing comments and seeing negative body language, I started to move my chair back, in case this escalated further.  My wife asked me to wait before I stood up, but I along with a few others watching were prepared nonetheless.  Now, who knows what was in his mind, and I would not begin to assume that I know, but I can say, from the outside looking in, it did not look like a fun circumstance for the manager.  \\n\\nIt looked more like the man's ego made things a lot more than it needed to be.  Rather than have a peaceful conversation about \\"phone calls and voice mails\\", it was more about a man who felt it was his right to have a face off with the manager, and find a solution for his group outside of what was comfortable for management, or the rest of those in the eatery.  \\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT:  Unless you have a concrete reservation where the manager says, \\"absolutely no problem at all, we would love to seat you\\".  You do not bring 60 people into a small restaurant clogging up access, standing around, moving tables, and trying to bully your way into a clearly half full restaurant that clearly does not have enough room to seat you inside.  Whether someone had an absolute reservation is between the manager and the person who made the reservation, but I can say this, if someone came in acting like the one person I am mentioning, I would have kicked them out of my restaurant in two seconds.\\n\\nIn the Future:\\n\\nDo not move tables.\\n\\nHave your party wait outside until you are seated, especially after you see you are blocking all door access.\\n\\nBe respectful in case there was a misunderstanding.\\n\\nFor the Record:  Most of the group seemed to be pretty nice, with the exception of this one alpha male who wanted to make a stand, although blocking access to the doors, the others were kind of oblivious.    At the end of the day, the lady who represented the group seemed like she felt she had a reservation but clearly that was not the case on both side."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"It was good food & great atmosphere when they located at the previous location.

Now, I definitely had been out in downtown Boulder exploring several bars and this pizza came after all that so there's a chance it actually wasn't as good as I thought it was, but in the moment, it was everything. I placed the order over the phone and was super pumped to hear they had gluten free crust. I built my own pizza; red sauce, spinach, onions, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best gluten free pies I've ever had, again, could have been all the cocktails or maybe this shop is the real deal. I may never know. The sauce was very different, very spicy. I like spicy so I enjoyed it but you're not a fan of spicy you may hate it. The pizza was expensive, $28. I usually don't go around ordering pizza pies so I honestly can't confirm whether or not that's pricey but it sounded like it was. The delivery guy was nice, couldn't come up to my hotel room so I went down to the lobby to get it and he was actually standing right outside the elevator doors so I did not need to wander to the front of the hotel lobby in my cheetah pajamas and oversized t-shirt and I VERY much appreciated this. I would highly recommend Cosmos to anyone who is looking for some pizza. Great to know they accommodate us gluten free folk.

My cousin thought this would be a good place to see Portland. I have to admit that it has excellent views of the city. \\n\\nThe problems with the place includes that space is limited and the staff does not consistently enforce their own policies. THE POLICY: Guests must wait for a place to sit and staff doesn't get involved with seating. \\n\\nPer the policy, I patiently waited, took a seat when I saw an opening and was immediately told in a rude way by a waitress that the open seats I patiently waited for actually belong to a group of white patrons because they patiently waited. Since I didn't care to escalate the situation or get killed, I got up and left. In my mind, racism must have played a role in why the waitress violated the policy for the other guests. So I requested my bill, and was preparing to leave. Then a manager came over to discuss the situation. But he too was rude and disrespectful to me. Based on his words and behavior, I was confident the violation of the policy was racially inspired. Why would anyone with authority approach a guest or guests to attempt to berate them about how it was appropriate for them to violate their own policy and try to escalate a non-situation?! \\n\\nSo, I do not recommend this place.

I would say this is my first time coming here and the food was pretty good. We started off with the Parmesan garlic wings and those are pretty good. We also had the avocado eggrolls. Those on the other hand were disgusting and only a bite was taken from one of them and the rest were thrown away. So if you're going to order them don't. Then we ordered entr√©es. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken with the corn and the couscous macaroni and cheese. The corn was like a ginger or something like that and it was awesome. It had some bacon bits in it that really pulled out the flavor. I also had the couscous which I was more wanting to try it just to see how it would taste. It was pretty awesome. My friend got the deep dish pizza with the meets on it and it looked really good I didn't try it though. Then we ordered the mini Pizzookies sampler I guess it's called. It comes with three mini pizzookies of your choice. If any of you don't know what a Pizzookie is, it is a cookie in a form of a pizza. There's also one that is a monkey bread that they have as another option to choose. We chose the white chocolate macadamia nut, the triple chocolate, and the peanut butter ones. All were awesome.

The one issue I see with this place is when it really comes down to it, this is not the greatest food. Steak was touch, Thai lettuce wraps were okay and Sangria left a bad taste in my mouth. Dessert was okay also, fried apple wrapped in dough with sugar and cinnamon. Prices are really cheap here which is good, but I would probably compare this to a Joe's Grill.

It was fabulous! I'm a big fan of Korean food, and with the plethora of Chinese and Thai restaurants in the area it is nice to have something different.\\n\\nMake no mistake -- Korean food is different from Japanese, Chinese, or Thai. First of all, everything comes with side dishes (called banchan). So not only do you get a giant plate of noodles, or beef, or whatever you've ordered for the main meal, but also a dozen little side dishes to eat. Compare Korean Grille's prices to what you get at other local asian restaurants, and you'll find that you get much more to eat for your buck. My husband and I each ordered our own meals, and the whole spread was way, way more than either of us could eat.\\n\\nWe didn't try the sushi, so can't comment on that, but the jigae that I had (with beef) was excellent. Everything tasted homemade and authentic. The kimchi, both the cabbage and cucumber style, is very good and not too spicy. The owner told us homemade instead of bought from jars, and I believe it. She brought out extra kimchi for us when she noticed that we had finished our first bit.\\n\\nThey do provide forks for you, if you are no good with chopsticks, but long spoons and chopsticks are also laid out for you if you prefer.

Seafood restaurants are a dime a dozen in Boston but only a handful are truly worth the wait and time and this is one of those places. Neptune is tucked away in a row of restaurants, bars, and shops in the North End. Look for the large glass window filled with oysters and, more than likely, you'll also see someone busily shucking away at oysters. It is everything you hear it is: hard to get in, long wait, limited seating, cramped seats, and VERY expensive. Brace yourself because it is worth it the time, inconvenience, and money. They open at 11:30am but it doesn't really matter because there will be a wait regardless the time you arrive. You will need to wait in line to wait in line. What? Yup. You will be waiting in a long line to get to the front so that you can then put your name down on a seating list. They will call you when your seats are ready which is usually around an hour. This is what it takes. Are you really committed? You are either in it for the long haul or not. Do you have preferred seating like the bar or that corner table? Forget it not happening. You will be seated where they can find space and oftentimes that means being snuggled between strangers. \\n\\nOnce you've been summoned by the Neptune gods to your seats you will receive a menu and a list of oysters available. Everything is expensive so get over that quickly so that you can indulge. This is not the place to be stingy spend away because you won't have another meal like this anytime soon.You'll end up spending around $100 per person. Please do yourself a favor and try several items I promise it's worth it. \\n\\nOn the oyster menu you will write how many of each one you want. They make it easy for you and have a basic description next to each oyster to help expedite the selection process. Let me start by saying this - I don't like oysters - in fact I hate oysters. I've tried many oysters over the course of my life and not-a-one was good. It doesn't float my boat. I guess I just don't have the palate for it... that was until I came here. I still say that I don't like oysters but I have included the caveat of I don't like oysters except for Neptune's Beausoleil and Wellfleet oysters. They were briny and delicious. I didn't even get grossed out by the texture (which usually makes me gag). The flavor of the oyster and the sea water were absolutely divine. You would have thought they had just pulled these babies right out of the water next to the table, yes, it was that fresh. I tried a few others but they didn't do it for me they weren't terrible they just weren't my flavor profile. If you only get one item on the menu the oysters are a must!\\n\\nAs part of our trip we did a lobster roll \\"tour\\" trying some of the best in town to see which one would be our favorite. (FYI I only go for the hot butter lobster roll don't give me that cold mayo mess) My partner thought this was the best lobster roll in town and I have to be honest while I loved the roll it wasn't my favorite one in town (check my other reviews for my favorite one). It's definitely in my top 3, maybe 2. To be honest you really can't go wrong with any item on the menu everything is fresh and made to order. \\n\\nLobster Roll\\nHearty portions of fresh lobster with hot butter and nicely crisp (soft inside) roll comes with a large side of salty fries. \\n\\nCiopinno\\n\\"Spicy Stew\\" with mussels, sea bass, saffron rice, and other shellfish. We upgraded and added lobster to it as well. I can't do spicy so I didn't try it but my partner said it was beyond phenomenal. Life changingly delicious. He slurped up every bit of broth in that sucker and was making delightful food noises the entire time so it's safe to say this is a winner. \\n\\nSea Bass with Tomatoes\\nLoved the acidity in this dish. The fish was spectacular there was a sear on the skin that had so much flavor and depth that was unbelievable. The tomato broth it was in was absolutely slurp worthy.  You could taste layer after layer of flavor and the texture was to die for. What a dish! So glad I tried it. \\n\\nLobster Caprese\\nOther than the Wellfleet and Beausoleil oysters I have to say this was the star of the menu for me. So simple yet so delicious. We ordered this as an appetizer but it could have easily been a main dish. Huge chunks of fresh lobster, caprese (cheese), and bright cuts of tomatoes finished with a light pesto sauce made this dish out of this world. I know it doesn't sound impressive but I have to tell you that it was. Sometimes simple dishes are the hardest to make because, similar to the oysters, they rely heavily on the quality and freshness of the product being served. You can't doctor bad lobster, cheese, or tomatoes in a dish like this any shortcomings in the quality of the products will be front and center on display. Wow, this dish is what dreams are made of. I am almost sad I tasted this dish because I'll never be able to get it again!"},{"name":"House of Blues Boston Restaurant & Bar","address":"15 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"2","text":"the line is ridiculous no excuse for how this is done.   dont buy tix for shows here.  what a shame"},{"name":"Tasos Euro Cafe","address":"125 Access Rd","city":"Norwood","stars":"3.5","text":"Taso's has an icecream window with outdoor seating, atleast during the summer they do.

As we took the third ice cream it started to rain.  We asked if we could bring our ice cream inside since we'd walked there and hadn't brough rain gear and the seating.  They said no, indoor seating was for dine-in customers only.  I looked inside, there were only 3 of the 20 or so tables with guests.  So we were forced to eat our ice cream uncovered in the rain while 80% of the restaurant was empty.

Believe me, I really wanted to love this place. We tried to get a table here two days in a row. The first day, the wait time was over an hour and a half and we were so starving that we gave up. It only made us more determined to come back. So we asked them when is a good time to come to make sure we will get a table in less than an hour and they said before we open up! \\nSo on  a sunday morning, we woke up at 8, made it to the restaurant by 8:30 AM and were standing in line before they opened up at 9. There were about 15 people ahead of us. Therefore, we were seated immediately when they opened up at 9. It was absolutely worth it. Because the next group of people ( the ones who got there around 9, but did not make it in in the first round),  would have to wait for the first group to finish dining before they could be seated... that automatically means about an hour of wait.\\nThey are a cosmopolitan menu.. They have everything from Korean dishes, bi bim bap, pancake to steak. So we got the lemon ricotta pancakes and a bunch of meat dishes. Steak and frites, cheddar cheese and steak and a couple other dishes. Too salty.... too greasy.....

The place is quite hidden from the road, but I really do enjoy the feel of the place. It's a small backyard garden and there was live music playing, so it felt super cozy and relaxing. Ordered the Carbonara Alexandria, Patrizi's Red Sauce with a meatball (since there is no meat in their red sauce), and at the server's recommendation, their Bruschetta. Overall, the meal was quite pricey, especially with adding the additional meatball. But it's homemade pasta, so I didn't think too much about it. \\nFound a table, and we ordered beers from the bar also in the same area. Waited around 15 minutes before our dishes came out, so relatively quick. They all looked amazing. The red sauce was amazing. I usually dislike red sauces in general because it tastes too much like tomato/ketchup like, but the spices in this sauce were mild, yet it made the dish taste so flavorful. I definitely could've eaten it without the meatball as well. The carbonara was kind of a miss for me. The noodles were quite dry, and a little bit undercooked for me as well sadly. But the Bruschetta was perfect. I didn't get the opportunity to ask what each one was topped with since they got super busy right after we ordered, but each of the three all tasted great.

My husband ordered the porto rican paella.  Come hungry as the portions are on the large size. We took home left overs.  The pulled pork was amazing.  It melted in my mouth and was full of delicious flavor.  The mofongo was interesting.  I am not a fan of mashed potatoes, and this was like mashed potatoes except made from plantains.  It was OK, just not my thing.  The paella was also tasty.  Our server gifted us an appetizer of plantain chips. They were OK.  They do have some alcoholic drinks. The server stirred us away from the margaritas. The sangria was OK, a bit watered down.  However, the wine by the glass was cheap and decent!  Better than expected.

I tried the Luke's Trio combo which comes with 3 half sandwiches of crab, lobster and shrimp. With a side, it was $23 which was so expensive for something that was just okay.

We took my partners grandmother out for Mother's Day. It was minutes after 8 pm., there was not many people. I counted 4 tables with customers. We were seated. The waitress left chips and salsa. We started to eat them thinking the water would follow-up. 5 minutes later the water still didn't show up.  Finally I flagged the waitress down for water. In between ordering and our food arriving the waitress stopped once to check on us. We had to ask her to refill the chips. I was already annoyed with water deal, more so because the restaurant was not busy and there was 4 to 5 waitresses walking around, but nowhere near our table. Our food arrived and my order of Tilapia fish was too fried and hard to eat. I bagged it for our dog. My partners Al Pastor tacos were very very greasy, the tortilla was falling apart, and the beans & rice were an island away in separation from the tacos on this huge blue platter. A 6inch plate or smaller would have been better for displaying this meal. It was ridiculous and unflattering. I had to wave down a waitress and ask for water refills. We waited 20 minutes before I finally asked for a check and bag because no one checked on us. When the waitress arrived at our table I asked if the manager/owner was available and she stated that she was the manager for the shift. When I spoke to her I was speaking to her in English and she was having a very hard time to communicate, so I started speaking to her in Spanish and I asked her if she was the manager and she mentioned that she was a manager for the shift and said \\"What's was the problem?\\" I said \\"The problem\\" is that since we arrived here the service has been horrible and told her about all the issues. She was clearly upset and you can tell her apology was not authentic. She was also upset because I asked for the owners name. I told her I was not mad but that I was very disappointed because we drove quite a bit and the service and food was not great. At minimum I expected an authentic apology or discount from our bill for there lack of service and food quality. I left no tip. They were not busy.  Service was horrible.  They deserve no stars. If you're in a management position in an area that predominately has Caucasians I highly suggest that you have someone that could deal with the issues that are encountered through any shift for the betterment and sake of your business. I could deal with the bilingual exchange and I'm okay with it, but others can't and won't, so I suggest you staff as needed. Not the place you want to spend your money on.

I agree with the review below that predicted that they may have had a recent change of ownership and that service has gone down. To sum Haan up, this is a Korean bbq restaurant with non-Koreans serving who dont know how to work a Korean bbq restaurant. The two wait staff that were there when we visited on a Saturday night were frequently missing from the main dining area or just not looking at the tables. They seemed to have this mindset that Korean bbq meant providing the basics at the beginning of the meal and that's it. Flagging them down to take our order was even difficult let alone get additional banchan or tea. We observed other tables having the same difficulty and the wait staff frequently having issues figuring out what was what in terms of what different liquor they served. They seemed clueless to the different types of soju they had and were referring to things on the menu wrong. They also changed the sourcing of their meat to a lesser quality. We had our usual 2 servings of pork belly and while the quantity was more then usual, the quality was far worse. If I had to guess, I would predict that they switched from an actual butcher shop to a grocery store bought packagdd meat. I also noticed that they changed the taste of their banchans and jjigae to accommodate a foreign taste making everything a lot sweeter then what it should've been. We left feeling very disappointed and knowing that we will most likely not return for awhile because Haan basically lost every competitive advantage it use to enjoy in the Korean bbq industry."},{"name":"PONKO Chicken","address":"2896 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I really love PONKO chicken.

I'm afraid my next visit will result in three pencil sized pieces of chicken. The cost for the chicken tender meal is on the higher side for some itty bitty chicken strips.

Options without meat and cheese were very limited, which is expected. We are used to substituting and customizing a little bit. Unfortunately, you can't. We ordered a bean burrito, and asked for fajita veggies inside. \\"We won't do that.\\" We got veggies on the side (which were good). The refried beans in the burrito were good, but it was all that was inside. I asked for chimichangas without the meat. \\"We won't do that.\\" So I got the veggie taco instead. It was a huge pile of shredded lettuce and chopped tomato (6\\" tall and the width and length of the plate) on top of a tortilla. I think there were some refried beans spread on the tortilla but they weren't very noticeable. The shredded cheese was low quality. The unwillingness to substitute fajita veggies for meat (we were willing to pay extra), or leave the meat out of chimichangas with no explanation of why struck me as odd and stubborn and a bit backwards.

The pricing was off as was the math at the register to which we had to correct and prove with a simple calculator.

Not as good as Buttermilk's pancakes, which still reign supreme for me as Atlanta's best pancakes, but a solid stack nonetheless.

Our server was just okay. He took our orders without any issue but seemed very disconnected. \\n\\n As for the food, we started with the oysters and the smoked fish. The smoked fish tasted great and had a good texture. The only problem was the tray of crackers that were served with it were all stale. I was surprised, since I figure they go through a bunch of them. We would have asked for some new ones if anyone had come to ask how the dishes were. So, we ate the stale crackers. The crab crusted corvina was wonderful. The dish had a nice balance of crab to fish, and the sides were great. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the asparagus was perfectly grilled, giving it good flavor and texture. The ooey gooey desert and the apple bread pudding were both good and big enough to share. \\n\\nThe owner is busy throughout the night, seating people, expediting orders, and otherwise making sure things are going well throughout the restaurant.

The hot food items are nothing to write home about, but I was impressed by the presentation and appearance of the sushi and salad bar, which included four different flavors of tobiko in their own little dishes.  The maki are rolled perfectly and are cut with care and precision allowing for the maki to maintain it's integrity with aesthetic qualities.  The cutest thing were the miniature nigiri sushi which were made with rice pieces about half (!) the size of my pinky finger.  The owner definitely wants you to enjoy their fish.  \\n\\nI would definitely come here again and look forward to bringing my husband who is a big Minados and Todai fan.  \\n\\nI took off one star because the green tea ice cream tasted like strawberry.  All of the ice creams are sitting together in the same freezer with their covers off which causes the flavors to all meld together.  \\n\\nYou can also do take-out from here as they have a separate take-out menu.

It felt super weird ordering streak for breakfast, but you only live once. Go crazy! As a tip, the steak is said to be cooked medium rare, but it's really medium well. \\n\\nThe steak was kind of dry and the sea salt on top made it too salty. Each bite had a chunk of salt, which didn't really appeal to me. The steak was also super chewy. Out of the 3 chunks of steak, I left 2.5 chunks on my plate. It was that bad. \\n\\nThe eggs were great, but it would be unsettling if a restaurant couldn't cook eggs properly. On the bottom, of the steak and eggs is a layer of corn cake.

So, there's that.\\n\\nBut for normal adult dining, I think it's a no. Not because of the noise of kids running around, although that is there (which I knew and expected, so whatever) but I think they just don't do more traditional dining as well. The lunch buffet, offered from 11-2, seems to be a little more aimed at adults and with the amount of business parks immediately surrounding the restaurant, that's probably a good idea. But it definitely needs improving. It's $7.75 for all you can eat buffet, which is a pretty good price point so maybe you just look past other stuff....? But all of the other stuff?\\n\\nI got there about 1:00 for a later lunch and immediately got the impression this place must get hammered at lunch time. I sat in one of the front section -- 15 tables, mostly 4-tops. Of those, 10 were dirty/unbussed. 4 were occupied, including me at 1...so 1 table was clean. The adjacent section, along the front windows, was the same -- at least 2/3 dirty tables. It all remained that way until shortly before I was leaving (20 min later?) when someone started picking up cups. No, just the cups. But with a bus tub and a rag, that place could have been clean in a few minutes. It just didn't seem a priority, and that's not a good impression to someone walking in. \\n\\n(By the way, I think the manager took my order. Regardless, whoever takes orders at the register faces directly out onto the dining room.

The pizza bar was better stocked, but wasn't the pizza I've had before there at kids' parties. Which I liked. I remember it being a thinner crust and this certainly wasn't.

Once you're inside the dining room, with it's cutely old school decor, you forget that.

While some dishes are more standout than others, we've never had a bad one. My SO, however, tends to stick to the pasta dishes since he claims it is very difficult to find properly made pasta and they do it right at La Grotta. This is coming from a dude who grew up on his Italian grandmother's food, so I defer to him.

Neither of us know jack about wine, but we stick to a mid-priced bottle of Chianti and have never regretted it. Oh yeah, and with regard to dessert, you really can't go wrong.

They're definitely a bit heavy on IPAs, but have plenty of non-hoppy options for people like me who prefer wheaty/malty beers. I will say this isn't the spot to go if you love heavy, earthy, session beers. They have one porter that's pretty mild in my opinion and no stouts. It could be that they have more diversity in the winter though. I've only been in the spring/summer.\\n\\nNon-alcoholic: I've only been after 3pm, so Longfellows cafe hasn't been open for me. They do have a few coffee options available even after 3pm though, a regular or a nitro cold brew. I had the regular and it was awesome but potent. Drink slowly or get the jitters. They also have carafes of water and glasses you can help yourself to which is awesome when you don't want to flag down a bartender over and over. Other options for the non-drinkers include homemade sodas and kombucha. The tumeric kombucha was tasty but maybe a liiiiiittle overkill on the spice level. Still liked it though.\\n\\nFood: they do NOT serve food here, but they encourage you to bring your own or have delivery. They DO have free bar snacks which is awesome. They're mini mason jars of goldfish/pretzels/etc. and you can grab as many as you'd like from the bartenders. Apparently they also occasionally sell some small snacks from pop-up vendors, but I haven't gotten any either time I've been.\\n\\nSpace/seating: It's not a huge space so you usually have to wait/hover for a while to get a table or some bar space.

They also have tons of board games you can play, as well as decks of cards.\\n\\nBathrooms: maybe this is TMI, but I was super impressed with the bathrooms. They buy really nice toilet paper.

Screen Door and Muscadine don't hold a candle to this fried chicken (sorry, guys). The cornbread, despite being all cornmeal, still had a very tender crumb, and combined with some of the hollandaise was just perfect. I was worried about the poached egg on it's own.

The smiles on everyone's faces who were dining made me think the food was good and the drinks strong.  There is a smallish bar in the rear and that group was living it up.  La Casita is tiny inside yet it has an outdoor patio - very good move!  I'll wager their summer & fall business booms there.\\n\\nAfter our wait and seating we had a server who was doling out a heavy Mex-Latin accent.  Okay, so we had to ask more than once what he was saying.  That stung a little but we weren't in any hurry.  Chips and salsa came out in quick fashion.  I enjoyed the goblet sized marguerita on the rocks and it was a homerun.\\n\\nChimichangas were ordered, both chicken and beef.  The 'changas came with a white queso-type sauce drizzled over the top.  A heaping helping of mex-rice, beans and fixing that were lettuce, pico, sour cream and guacamole was very nice.  Food took only about 10 minutes with the restaurant slammed and it arrived very hot.\\n\\nThis \\"man of La Mancha\\" will return to La Casita for a burrito and I want to try their fajitas, too.  If both are as good as the chimichangas..... we're moving to 5-stars.

The interior is very simple but still elegant, w/ linen tabletops & candlelight.  \\n\\nService is friendly and polite, and I want to stress \\"polite\\" is the best word I can use to describe the service.  We voiced our comments about the food and the typical reply to us was, \\"That's pretty much how it is.  Please adjust to it.\\"  Don't get it twisted, when the server told this to us they said it very politely, but they didn't really do much about it.\\n\\nI had really high hopes for this place.  My wife has been to their sister restaurant, Le Pigeon, and had a phenomenal experience there.  Unfortunately our experience here fell very short.  We actually didn't finish many of entrees we ordered.\\n\\nDeep Fried Fish (Chicken fried) - 2/5 - below average - $28\\nI'm not really a fish and chips guy, and this dish is basically a $30 fish and chips plate (minus the chips).  The server explained it was de-boned but I had bone in almost every other bite.  We voiced our comments about having bones in the fish, and they replied politely \\"We make an effort to get the bones out, but unfortunately can't get all the bones out.\\"  It's also served w/ lettuce so you can make your own lettuce wraps.  While the dish was okay, I didn't finish the plate. Note - it's called \\"chicken fried\\" trout, because that's the style how it's cooked.  There isn't any chicken in it.\\n\\nHangar Steak - below average - 2/5 - $28\\nThe steak was okay.  We requested it medium and it came back very bloody.  We voiced our comments and they re-cooked it.  While the steak was oay, I also didn't finish the steak.  It was over the top creamy and felt like I was eating a salisbury steak.  I wasn't really feeling this dish.\\n\\nBone Marrow - Solid, 4/5\\nThe bone marrow was the star of the show.  A solid dish. The presentation is beautiful.  The dish is really flavorful too.  My only gripe was the bone marrow was over the top salty; we voiced our comments to the server and they politely said, \\"Bone marrow is salty.  That's how it is.\\"  \\n\\nPork Belly - Interesting, 3.5/5\\nThe pork belly was interesting.  Many people say this is recommended and I'd say order it just because it's an interesting dish.

I remember eating there a number of times in the past but it has to have been over 10 years ago if not longer.  I remember it being a very special place to take someone for a birthday dinner or some other festive occasion so when my partners 41 birthday was coming up, I decided to give them another whirl.  My partner and I have eaten at just about every place on Disney property but this was one that we had not tried yet and we always like to do something different!\\n\\nI made the reservation only a few days before this birthday so getting a table was not a challenge.  In fact, I wanted one around the time of the fireworks at the Magic Kingdom and it worked out just fine.  Once we arrived, the hostess was friendly and gave us a pager.  We were there a bit early so we decided to have a drink at the bar.  The bar was actually busy and it was hard to find a seat for both of us.  I remember that Narcoossee's was famous for their yards of ale.  They used to have those long glass glasses with the wooden holders all over the place... but they were gone.  We both just ended up having a glass of wine. \\n\\nWe were seated in about 15 min which put us just at the time of our reservation so all was good.  Our server was an older gent who was nice and seemed to know the menu but he did not have much of a 'bed side\\" manner.  He was doing his job but that was just about it.   When I looked at the menu, everything sounded great.  The special of the day unfortunately was already gone (it was 9 pm) so we could not order that. I ordered the chowder and the salmon while my partner ordered the Surf and Turf.   The chowder was excellent and I enjoyed that very much!  The salmon was also good but I have had better.  The Surf and Turf was also quite good and my partner said it was the best he had ever had. \\n\\nWe were about to order dessert and the server brought out a special birthday surprise of a chocolate mousse cake.   I had told them we were celebrating a birthday when I made the reservation so this was a nice surprise since none of the staff said anything to us all evening.   \\n\\nThe fireworks that night were at 10 pm so it was nice to be able to see them from our seat... but of course some people had to stand up and block the views.  Plus, even if you have a window seat, there is a porch outside of the windows and tons of people go outside and stand right in front of your view so hopefully you will be able to see past them.  \\n\\nI will say that the food was good but something was different from when I was last here.  Not sure if it was the staff or the general feeling of the place but it just was not like a normal Disney meal.  The prices were much higher than I remember.  In fact, it has to be one of the most expensive meals we have eaten on property so make sure you bring your wallet with lots of money in it.

Every pitch is the same: if you are using Square, PayPal, or Apple Pay we can beat their rates. For the first few months, I said \\"okay, great - send your salesperson over and show me how you can do it.\\" In all three instances the salesperson quit their job because I exposed the half truths of the pitch. How did I do that you say? Well, here is the secret...I read the contract and showed them the flaws. What does this have to do with my review of Asian House?\\n \\nIf you look at the photos I posted, you will see one where a bellicose woman in a head scarf was pitching to the owners of this establishment on the benefits of switching credit card processors. This person was so loud she was drowning out the house music that was playing. It went on for literally 12 minutes. The upside? Listening to her ear-piercing banter was more enjoyable than the wretched swill this restaurant is serving. My thoughts for the owners of this restaurant are that they should worry more about the food because they won't need credit card processing if the refuse you are serving here doesn't improve.\\n\\nAs you enter this restaurant, you immediately notice a disgusting smell emanating from the garbage dumpster bizarrely situated next to the front door. My first thought was \\"why would you want every single customer smelling your rotting garbage as they enter?\\" Totally befuddling to me.\\n\\nMy server was a very charming woman named Angela. She was professional, courteous, and very supportive in light of the stomach-churning swill served here. Because my innards were already disaffected due to the dumpster waft, I decided to keep it simple. Spicy tuna hand roll and an order of Snow White prawns. The shrimp were butterflied, which made me wonder why you would butterfly cheap, low-grade, popcorn-size shrimp. The answer? So you can load each one up with 5 ounces of thick pasty batter. I could not cut the shrimp with a knife. No joke - I literally had to bite and gnaw at it to break a piece of shrimp off. Once I did I spit it back out immediately. Absolutely gross. What made it worse was the white sweet gamete-like substance on top of the un-chewable shrimp.\\n\\nFor the spicy tuna roll, they served me the same panko-encrusted, chopped up salmon that I was served at Sumo in Indian Harbour Beach. I asked if the sushi binder was Japanese, and they responded, \\"no, Chinese,\\" so maybe that accounts for this experience. All I can say is Sumo is officially the second worst sushi in Brevard as Asian House is officially the worst based on my experience here today.\\n\\nThe Big Boy says, stop and whiff the dumpster by the door.

The seafood boil we ordered was decent but also lacked the seasoning and flavor a Cajun seafood boil should have. - Everything is over cooked with garlic, as a substitute of actual Cajun seasoning. \\n\\nThe restaurant lacked an adequate amount of servers based on the tables filled and we were told to wait when we asked to order our food.

The broths were so flavorful, but not overly salty. We also HAD to try the Korean fried chicken. It was Guy's favorite after all. Just a heads up, it takes about 20 mins for the fried chicken. We went ahead and had our ramen brought out first. I've tried Korean fried chicken before and was concerned it was going to be dry. These were not! I loved the flavor as well.

It was also over sprinkled with salt which made it unbearable.\\n\\nFor our main entrees, the filet mignon I ordered was over cooked (I asked for medium and they made it well done).  Further, it was bland with no flavoring whatsoever.  It tasted as though they just cut up a piece of meat and tossed it on their grill without any seasoning.  My wife had their seafood Cioppino and the fish tasted old and came with the old stale toast.\\n\\nI don't mind paying good money for good food, but the service, food and overall experience I had here was terrible.

Instead, what you are presented with is something more akin to what happens when Buffalo Wild Wings decides to get into the taco business (although, I do no believe BWW owns this local chain).\\n\\nI will say, the one shining light we had was a very attentive waiter, within reason.

When we ran up there, we had to clear a table for ourselves.\\n\\nAs a caveat, I can deal with waiting a while.

Easily. The hamburger was one of the best I've had. The full experience here is what brings this to a four star review. But honestly, the experience was so rough that the fact that I only docked one star speaks to how good the food was.\\n\\nSo let me set the scene. A bunch of my family was meeting in Columbus to do some shopping and get something to eat. There's 11 of us in total (including one baby). My brother in law had heard the legend of The Thurman Caf√© and how amazing the hamburgers were here so we decided to check this place out. We knew going in it was going to be a smaller place and with a party that big there was going to be a wait. \\n\\nWe get there around 1:00 on a Monday (granted it was also Presidents Day so it was more crowded than a normal Monday I'm guessing). The place is pretty crowded with people even standing outside. We approach the host who goes on to tell us that they don't have any type of seating for a group of our size so they were going to have to split us up into a group of 5 and 6. This is understandable. We agreed to not needing the tables to be next to each other to speed up the process as well. We were told 45 minutes to an hour. We flinched a bit, but again it was understandable. We agreed and went outside to wait since it was such a nice day.\\n\\nWe waited..and waited..and waited..took a stroll around the block..decided exactly what we were going to get from the menu posted outside..and waited..and waited.\\n\\nA little over an hour had passed so we approached the host. He told us there were another two tables in front of us. So we waited some more. About fifteen minutes later we notice a group of five who came in after us were being seated. We questioned this when the host returned and he admitted he screwed up. Didn't offer an apology. Said that one table for us was ready..but not both..because he gave the other one away to some other randos. This upset our group a good amount.\\n\\nThe first group of six, with all the kids, took the table that was ready. The rest of us waited..and waited..it was another fifteen minutes before another table became available. So all in all it took us an hour and a half from when we got there to get a table. Nearly double the time that was quoted to us. (To add insult to injury, the table the host accidentally gave away was right next to the other table in our group, the one we ended up with was the whole way across the restaurant.)\\n\\nSo finally seated we were ready to order. We all knew what we wanted, because we had all decided in the hour and a half we waited. The wooden \\"booth\\" we were seated in was really not comfortable at all, it was one of the few times in recent memory that I would have preferred a comfy chair to sit in instead. \\n\\nThe wait staff was friendly. At this place you don't really get one waiter, they all team up on all the tables. It seems like it'd get confusing but it somehow worked. We got our drinks and were ready to place our order. My niece ordered some pretzel bites for an appetizer because she was starving when we got there at 1, not that it was getting close to 3 she was beyond starving. I went with the Blazin burger because I enjoy a good hot burger. While relooking at the menu to make sure I made the right choice I saw a little note saying that the burgers take longer than normal burgers to cook so expect to wait a bit for them. My heart kind of sank to my stomach.\\n\\nSo we placed our order and then we waited..and waited..our pretzel bites came and they were immediately consumed by the table. They seemed to be deep fried pretzels and came with a honey mustard sauce. They seemed good, but just about anything would've at that point. So then back to the waiting..and waiting..\\n\\nFinally at around 3:30 our burgers arrived. They were huge. They were absolutely delicious. Mine came with jalapeno bottle caps, pepper jack cheese, and mayo. Everything blended together perfectly. The burger patty was thick and juicy and so flavorful. The bun was toasted and came with Sesame Seeds and was just perfect. My burger came with spicy fries that were good as well, if maybe a little undercooked.\\n\\nEveryone at the table agreed that the burger was outstanding. Then the discussion went to was it worth it to deal with the long (so so long) wait and uncomfortable booth for the burgers. The decision was pretty unanimous that..unfortunately..there's probably no burger worth going through something like that again. We agreed that in the future with this place our best bet would be to either order take out, come in much smaller groups, and definitely steer clear on any peak hours or holidays.\\n\\nWe walked out of there very full at around 4 o'clock..a full three hours after we had arrived. We pretty much had to scrap the rest of our plans for the afternoon because of the time.

There's better restaurants in the 'couve."},{"name":"Paddlefish Restaurant","address":"1670 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We were so excited to try Paddlefish after being long time fans of the former restaurant Fulton's. Unfortunately we left pretty disappointed. \\n\\nFor starters we had a lunch reservation and upon checking in realized the A.C. was turned down to meatlocker mode on an already cool day. With this I asked to be seated outside which was definitely a mistake. We sat there waiting to be greeted as 3 servers argued over who's table we were. It became quickly clear that we were seated in a pick-up section.\\n\\nFinally we place our order. I ask if the steak tartare that's on the lounge menu is available. Our server told us there was no steak tartare on any menu there. Alrighty then, we ordered the fish tacos and crab cake blt with well done bacon. As we waited for our food I pulled up the menu online and sure enough there was steak tartare on it. I waited to show the server but we never saw her again. Food comes out with fatty bacon that had to be pulled off, empty drink cup with no one to give a refill. Seemed that the only table the staff or manager cared about was a group of girls that I believe were off duty employees. By the time we saw the server again we handed her our credit card and left. \\n\\nSorry but although the view is nice Paddlefish is too expensive for sub-par food and service. There are way too many restaurants at Disney Springs to come back here."},{"name":"Tsuki Sushi Bar","address":"509 Abbott Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"1. The green tea was very watered down.\\n2. The miso soup came with a hair in it.  I asked for a replacement. \\n3. The salmon didn't seem fresh.  The tuna was decent, and the salmon/sushi pieces were okay. \\n4. A fly landed and got stuck on my plate.  Not really in their control, but it sure added to the unpleasantry. \\n\\n\\nI won't be back.  Vancouver has a lot better to offer for sushi than this place."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I feel in love with Portland's food scene and Tasty n Alder is one of the main reasons. \\n\\nI arrived by myself after having planned to visit this restaurant in multiple occasions. It was about 5:30-6pm. The place was packed. I had left a conference so I was in casual attire, but it is easily a nice place to take in after a show or on a date. \\n\\nI ate at the counter overlooking the kitchen. On of my favorite places as go out to eat. I can tell by the focus, passion and care how good the food is going to be. And I could tell...\\n\\nAs I read the reviews I was so torn I literally ordered for at least 2, if not 3. Luckily the food is pretty small plate-ish, or just not normal American portions.  I ordered so much food I ended up making two new foodie friends and sharing good with them, and then with me! What a way for people to come together around awesome food. \\n\\nSo what did I order:\\n\\nSeared Scallops with a mint pesto which was really good, very nice sized scallops with a great sear. The flavor profile with the pesto was awesome. Wasn't the BEST scallop I've had in terms of melt in your mouth texture but wasn't too far off at all. \\n\\nGrilled artichokes and Saut√©ed Spinach which both were good. Nothing super flashy, good and solid sides. \\n\\nI also ordered the Skillet Corn Cake which was one of the BEST things there. Do not leave without getting it. \\n\\nGrilled asparagus was good. \\n\\nGaucho Ribeye, as I live my steaks medium and fatty this was great. The only bad part is that it had to compete with the Salmon. \\n\\nMy neighbor ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my one bite. OMG...yeah I should have listened to the reviews. \\n\\nThis is getting long so I'll wrap it up, get the red velvet cake that's made to order with a cream cheese ice cream and you'll drift off into heaven at your seat. \\n\\nI had no expectations coming here, so I was beyond impressed. I just need to come back to finish off the menu."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"197 Main Street","city":"Stoneham","stars":"2","text":"Two times I've been to this Burger King location and they got my order wrong.  One of the times they didn't even give you my hash browns, but I was so far away by the time I realized it that I didn't have time to go back.  I passed by this Burger King every day and it's been over 6 months since I last went to it because of frustration of their quality of service. Today I had my son with me and he wanted Burger King so I decided to give them another chance. Sitting in the drive thru with nobody behind me I need to mention, my son and I are deciding what we want to eat. Maybe two minutes have gone by Wendy person attending the drive-thru tells me that we need to come in that we're spending too long in the Drive-Thru and we're not allowed to do that. She was actually raising her voice like we were annoying her or we did something wrong. Needless to say we just left. Burger King in general is not a bad place to go but this location is obviously poorly managed and don't understand the courtesy of customer service"},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Our family of five had salmon Benedict, bacon Benedict, make your own scramble, classic sandwich, and grand marnier toast. Everyone was satisfied! We were there on Thursday at 9:30 so there was no wait and we parked right in front of the restaurant. I only gave 4 stars because coffee was bad, tasted like it was diluted with lots of water. Other then that I would definitely recommend and we will be back if in the area!"},{"name":"Flippers Pizzeria","address":"6526 Old Brick Rd, Ste 100","city":"Windermere","stars":"3.5","text":"These entry-level Yelpers posting 1-Star reviews obviously don't value the superiority that these guys offer over EVERYONE ELSE in this area. Don't take my word for it, try it! Fresh ingredients, great atmosphere, and a wide selection. Yes, it's a bit slow, but great food takes time to make. If you want faster service, I hear the gas station next door has great \\"grab and go\\" options. Enjoy it!"},{"name":"Bam Pow Burgers","address":"5211 NE 148th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the food cart right outside Level Beer. Not only does this place provide a great place to grab a bite if you have had a few beverages at the brewery, it is also a great place to grab lunch if you work nearby. \\n\\nI fall into both of these categories. As a vegetarian I highly recommend getting the impossible burger. SO TASTY!! As I am vegetarian and not a vegan I have them put real cheese on my burger (also recommended unless you are vegan).\\nThere is also a kale chicken salad that has fries on it. Some people in my office have ordered this..some with chicken, some without. They report that this is super tasty as well. \\n\\nAnyways, if you find yourself in the area definitely check out this food cart. Super yummy and run by nice people. You can also call ahead."},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious upscale Italian food, and classy ambiance. Free 2-hour parking right cross the street from the restaurant. \\n\\nOUTSTANDING freshly hand made rosemary focaccia. \\n\\nI wish the lady who seated us was more accommodating when we walked in just after 5pm day after Christmas when the restaurant was quiet and we were told we couldn't sit in the corner table because it's for 5 people. We were seated next to a white wall with a fire notifier box with the rest of the restaurant almost empty. \\n\\nThis restaurant also charges a 3% restaurant administration fee (?!) which is unusual. There is a long essay you can read about it at the back of the menu."},{"name":"Clyde's Prime Rib Restaurant & Bar","address":"5474 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is one of those Portland staples that you'd most likely, and quite willingly, drive right by. Don't let the exterior fool you - look at the packed parking lot!\\n\\nThe host was an absolute gem and great first contact at the restaurant. Decor is old school steak house meets lodge. Large booths in main dining area and more intimate seating on the bar/stage side. \\n\\nMeal #2 for Portland Dining Month:\\n\\nFirst course:\\nSeafood \\"tower\\": miniature prawn cocktail; ahi tuna poke with ginger, garlic, scallions and toasted sesame-soy lacquer with crispy fried crab crackers\\n\\nSecond course:\\nSlow-roasted prime rib served au jus with wine-braised brussel sprouts and roasted garlic mashed potatoes\\n\\nThird Course:\\nBittersweet chocolate brownie with bourbon caramel, whipped cream and amaretto cookie crumble\\n\\nLet's just be real for a second. Portland Dining Month is a great way to try new restaurants, but the consensus is that you're really not getting much bang for your buck. I'd suggest spending a few extra dollars and ordering whole servings of things you'd enjoy. Case in point - the appetizer. Fresh but comically small. I'm literally still laughing about it. \\n\\nI find Prime Rib to be hit or miss. Clyde's delivered! Perfectly cooked, not chewy, great flavor. I wrapped half for lunch and am looking forward to enjoying it twice! \\n\\nThe amaretto cookie crumble on the dessert gave it just enough 'extra' to make it worthwhile. \\n\\nService was beyond stellar. \\n\\nI would highly recommend. Currently sitting at 4 stars for portion size, but I see that changing to 5 next time I return and order a la carte."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pretty dang good, yessiree.  Went for brunch and wasn't disappointed with the food, drinks, or wait staff whatsoever- great kitchen putting out an amazing menu, friendly and talented bartenders, and friendly staff.\\n\\nOnly drawback- if it's cold and a weekend, dress extra warm and expect to be waiting outside for a loooong time.  They don't have a good system for managing incoming guests, so you'll need to wait outside the restaurant for the entire time you're waiting to be seated- Sat & Sun mornings will be upwards of 30min.  It's worth it, but you definitely need to plan the wait time into your schedule and dress appropriately.\\n\\nManagement could easily solve this issue with a buzzer system common in the industry."},{"name":"Bootleg Special","address":"400 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"A really great place for southern fusion food.
