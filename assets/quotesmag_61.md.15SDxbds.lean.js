The bagels are the best I've had in Atlanta (which isn't saying much, of course, but they are very good!). This is the closest to a NY style diner you're gonna get in these parts. My main problem is with the service, particularly the waiter I had earlier this afternoon. He had an attitude from the get-go. To make things easy, I decided to get the same bagel, lox and cream cheese that my boyfriend did. When he asked what I wanted, I first said that I wanted a fruit salad and then added, \\"And he and I will be having the same bagel\\". He seemed overly confused by this and snapped, \\"Ok, one at a time\\" forcing my boyfriend to repeat the exact same bagel combination to him, which is just utterly stupid. But oh well, right? Ok, so when we received our bagels, he gave us Lox CREAM CHEESE, not lox....as in, uh, smoked salmon. When I mentioned it (very nicely, I might add....I  used to wait tables, so I know better than most about mistakes like these) he immediately pointed out that I was wrong, that I ordered the wrong thing, but passive-aggressively said he would take my plate and give me the fish. I said, thank you, but that I HAD ordered lox, not lox cream cheese, or I would have said lox cream cheese. Fucking duh. My boyfriend was so hungry, he just ate his and didn't say anything. When he brought it back, he made a point to bring it up again that I didn't order the right thing. I wasn't going to take his snippy abuse, so again, I said, \\"Nope, sorry, I ordered lox. You were wrong.\\" This infuriated him. I mentioned that he might not want to act like this since he is relying on tips and all. I mean, seriously, he could have nicely said, \\"Oh, next time you'll want to order the number 9 for lox\\". That would have been fine! But to never own up to your own stupid mistake is only hurting yourself in the end. \\n\\nSo, I'd say, definitely go here, everybody else is great (a waitress even apologized for him saying that he was wrong), but personally, If I get this guy again, I will be asking for another server. \\n\\nBTW, he is gay, skinny and has a southern accent.

For a restaurant that has only been open for three weeks, it seemed to hitting it's stride.  12/5 (Saturday) went for dinner\\n\\nSummary:  If you like well thought-out food with high end ingredients and a menu that changes often, this is your place.  The pasta, meats and grains are made in house and you can tell they care about the little things.  If you want \\"cheesecake factory\\" size portions and food covered with salt or spices to hide poorly sourced ingredients then you won't appreciate it.  If you like Odd Duck and what they are doing, you will like this place.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nService - explained the different options and items we should not miss.  Said the items that were really top notch that evening and had opinions on the food.  Set expectations on what we were going to receive and timing.  Fair warning - our server was a professional waiter who specializes in opening places and was hired by the restaurant to train their staff so we go top notch service.  The open kitchen shows the staff working and how collaborative of an environment this is - reminded us very much of odd duck.\\n\\nFood - Food impressed with unique ingredients and appropriate amount of seasoning\\n- Polenta is the best we have had since \\"polenta under glass\\" from bottega in Napa.  It is amazing how fresh milled polenta tastes so different.  \\n- Johnny Cakes - Dim sum option and tasted like home - spot on.\\n- Pork shoulder and pickles - only dish that disappointed but I think that is because we were getting too full.  The house made birthday bread with this dish is outstanding and if you can get this with the polenta at the same time, they make a great combination.\\n- Pasta - perfect amount to share as a starter to the main course.  Sausage was perfectly prepared and you cannot beat house made pasta.\\n- Steak - very large portion and was perfectly done.  We loved it but I want to try the pork chop.\\n\\nCocktails/Wine - smaller list but everything is in it's place.  We had a california syrah that was recommended and was not over the top but perfect with the pasta and steak.  The manager is a som as well so he recommended it - we actually gave the option of two different wines and he picked the one that was less expensive because he felt it went better (good call).  Cocktails are very good and they make a very good old fashion.\\n\\nOther:\\n- Reservations - we went at 7 pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed.  I like that they take reservations.\\n- Valet Parking - well worth it given how crazy Rainey parking can be.\\n- Brunch - They have brunch and looks outstanding - we will be back.\\n- Outdoor seating - they have a large patio with heat lamps but looked like the place to be for brunch.\\n- Chef's table - they have 5 seats that overlook the kitchen\\n\\nWe will be back and glad to see that this place is trying to add another great location to the austin dining scene."},{"name":"Carrabba's Italian Grill","address":"11590 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I am a HUGE fan of this franchise in general after finding out about in while living in Utah.

The rating of 2 stars is based on the particular experience, but basing the rating on the food and tasting alone, I'd give them a 4. \\n\\nI have dined here once before (for the Jazz Thursdays) and LOVED it. The food, the staff, the Atmosphere is all pure, classical French. The experience was very good... easily 4 stars. \\n\\nLast night, my fianc√© & I joined some friends at Atmosphere for their Wednesday night Wine Tasting. The tasting is $25 per person and they covered five wines (from the Loire Valley). Unlike a lot of wine tastings in town, you need a reservation and you are seated at a table with a several large groups. Each wine is paired with an amuse-bouche. \\n\\nA local distributor puts on the tastings, so a lot of the wines may not be available on the Atmosphere menu. The wines we sampled were great, and the guy pouring was very knowledgeable about what he was pouring and loved to talk about it. While the food sampled was all really good, some of the pairings may not have been the best combos, imo, but overall a great experience. \\n\\nMy only gripe about the wine tasting was that it could have moved a little quicker, and with a little more coordination. Since there was really only one guy pouring wine for the whole room and he liked to chat with the customers, sometimes it took a while to get a pour and when you did, the food pairing may or may not be ready. This resulted in wines being finished before the food arrived, or vice versa. But, overall a great experience. \\n\\nNow for the heart of the matter... when we were ready to leave, as the Valet pulled my car up, I handed him a $3 tip and started to get in my ride. The Valet stops me and says, \\"It's $5.\\"  I tell him, \\"I wasn't aware there was a charge, but ok.\\" The truth was, I was in a hurry and didn't have time to argue, so I flipped the guy a $20, got $15 in change & then still gave him $3 tip and drove off. \\n\\nWhat ensued next was our friends' car arrived and after seeing the Valet charge me, my buddy stopped and asked the Valet if there was a charge for parking. The Valet says, \\"yeah, $5.\\" They had been to the restaurant several times prior (5 to be exact), and my friend told the valet that he had never paid to park--it was always complimentary. So, my friend steps back in to the restaurant to ask the guy behind the bar, who says no--the valet service is complimentary. He then comes from behind the bar to assume the \\"manager\\" role of the situation. They both walk out and he asks the Valet if he was charging to park and the Valet denies it right in front of my friend (the CUSTOMER). The \\"manager\\" (I say this with quotes, because we don't know his name or if he was truly the manager) proceeds to say he's known the valet a long time and believes him, which must mean my friend (the CUSTOMER) is lying. \\n\\nAt this point, things become escalated, and as other customers are waiting on their cars, a few of them become involved and the whole thing apparently turned into a  big scene, which I won't go into.  \\n\\nOur friends then call us to tell us what had happened after we drove off and to confirm that I had been charged $5--which I had. We were outraged & called the restaurant back to let them know what had happened and to tell them that we were in fact charged to park and we wanted to know why they didn't believe our friends (aka other CUSTOMERS) when they were told? They assured us the situation was \\"being handled, and that Valet would no longer be working there.\\" \\n\\nAll in all, it was a crazy ending to an otherwise great night for our friends. \\n\\nI should add in here that both my friend and I worked as Valets in the past, so we are well aware of the rules of engagement and were both prepared to tip well. We also know that that kind of activity amounts in a Valet scamming extra money from his own company, as well as putting an unwanted scar on the establishment, because we know that the restaurant simply hires a company to provide the service and they aren't affiliated, which is why we had to let the restaurant know."},{"name":"The Haven","address":"2 Perkins St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Scottish bar and restaurant.

Let me get something local instead of corporate, and try the local flavor.  I thought it was a safe bet given Cafe Noir's favorable reviews on Yelp.  Sadly it was a complete failure.  \\n\\nWhen I arrived on a Saturday morning around 10:20 a.m., there were two tables with guests already seated at last one of which had their drinks and food on the table.  I was the only guest in line.  I ordered a Cappuccino and a croissant, (a super easy order if there ever was one), and took a seat.  Then a phone call order came in.  Then an Uber Eats (or similar driver) came in to pick up and order.  The Uber Eats driver's order apparently was given to a prior Uber driver, and Noir Cafe would lean that they had more than one Uber order and had given driver #2's order to driver #1.  \\n\\nThe owner then proceeded to chew out the barista / cashier telling him to  always check the name of the customer on any Uber order and that the owner would send the barista home for the day if he was working without paying attention.  (Ouch).  They then go into panic mode to remake the order that was given to the wrong driver.  Of course while some Uber driver's client at home in their pajamas waiting for their Uber driver, Noir Cafe has my order and the orders of everyone who is physically in their restaurant which get totally ignored.\\n\\nA full 13 minutes later, (using the time of my receipt) still no Cappuccino and no croissant.  I let them know that I had other things to do that day and asked that they let me cancel the order.  The owner then came over and reversed the changes on my card.  After a snafu, like that the reaction I would have made as business owner, would have been, I am sorry.  We forgot about you, I will personally make these right now, and they are on the house.  Having worked in several restaurants, I was always taught to do everything you can to avoid having any customer leave unhappy, and to own your mistakes and fix them where possible. \\n\\nI walked back to the hotel, (5 minutes) and went to Starbucks.  From the I ordered a Cappuccino and a slice of Pumpkin Loaf, to the time the items were handed to me was under 3 minutes.  Starbucks knows how to execute.  Noir Cafe, with an owner in the back and one cashier, lacks the staff to handle a rush or a mistake and has no business bothering with Uber Eats until they learn to take care of their in-store customers.  They should also prioritize people waiting in person over those waiting in their pajamas at home.  Starbucks knows how to execute.  Noir Cafe does not.  My suggestion is stick with Starbucks, visit another restaurant or be prepared to wait an inordinately long time."},{"name":"Piada Italian Street Food","address":"1315 W Lane Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Since my last review, The Manager did contact me and started how sorry she was for my experience.

Pulled pork (no BBQ sauce-they bring 3 homemade bottles (original, Carolina and habanero) out separate for you to add yourself) was piled high with a distinct vinegar taste, on a grilled bulky roll (could have had it on a Texas toast too).  The burnt ends were perfectly smoked tasted like they came straight from Texas to Boston. \\n\\nFor our sides we ordered the baked Mac and cheese which was so good it may have been my favorite thing on the menu.

Everyone is out walking on Newbury with nice lighting on the street, warm weather, good people watching-just a nice evening out. The food here is pretty darn good, not excellent, and a tad expensive (but it is Newbury street so just deal with it) but you'll certainly be satisfied. I've had burgers, salads, and even tried the grilled cheese and other than the grilled cheese everything has been great. Personally I'll have to go ahead and say they have the best spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had-the cadillac of artichoke and spinach dips if i may be so bold. The dip itself is nice and thick, with nice bits of artichoke and spinach. The chips are baked (maybe fresh?) and delightful. Ok enough about spinach and artichoke dip; if I could, I would give Stephanie's a 5-stars for the overall experience and 4-stars for the food.

I wasn't expecting much but we did get the cinematic experience. Which is a smaller menu options that comes with an appetizer of your choice and an entree. Also, a dessert bar outside on the deck and tickets to the cinematic theatre show outside in universal. That was all for $45 per person. It was very nice entrance way and set the tone for a San Franciscan fish theme. We were seated after a few minutes and greeted by a very friendly waiter. He explained the menu process and was very helpful. My sister could not decide between the fried fish or shrimp and he suggested she get both and he would make a special one with just those two types of fish. She was happy they could do that. For appetizers, I first ordered the clam chowder which they were out of so I settled with the house salad. The others got salads and calamari. My salad seemed very fresh and my dressing was good. I got Italian which really was creamy Italian but I like both so it didn't matter. I thought it was tasty. The calamari I tasted was pretty good. The waiter did inform us that it was a calamari steak cut up and fried in tempura. It seemed fresh but I did have better calamari elsewhere. For my entree I settled on the fried shrimp. The platter came with 5 jumbo shrimps, fries, coleslaw, and a side of cocktail sauce. The shrimp were very plumb and tasty but was covered by a lot of tempura batter. I found myself picking it off to just eat the shrimp. The batter fell right off as it was just too heavy. The coleslaw was drier and crispy which I like. The cocktail sauce seemed homemade and was tasty. The fries... Eh they seemed frozen but they were alright. Now for the  dessert part I suggest getting outside to the bar early because we were out there about 8:30(show starts at 9) and everything was almost gone. I just had a cupcake because that's all that was left. They did have assortments of coffees and teas as well. For the price of the whole thing I guess it was ok. The show wasn't as great as I thought but they definitely can make some money by offering that package. I gave this place 3 stars because of the good waiter and edible food.

Ordered an egg white Hippy Hollow Omelette and an iced chai...while both were okay, I was surprised at how incredibly greasy the omelette was (yay for negating the benefit of ordering it with egg whites).\\nAfter finishing my meal I decided to check out the wall offerings of coffee packs, pictures and mugs. Grabbing two mugs (touristy style gifts for friends, ftw), I went up to the counter to pay...and was dismissively greeted by a different young woman than the (much friendlier) one who'd originally taken my food order. She rang me out for the two mugs, gave me a receipt to sign and (saying almost nothing other than the price I'd owed) promptly walked away from the counter. I stood in place and waited, for a full 5 minutes of quiet...then she walked over to the second register, looked over and said nothing. Another minute passed before she said \\"what do you want?\\" When I asked for a copy of my receipt she said, \\"oh, I didn't think you wanted one\\"...mind you, I was never asked. She approached the rest of the interaction (simply printing the receipt and handing it to me) as if I was a giant interruption in her day.\\nWhile I have a fairly high tolerance for things, bad customer service just gets my goat. And, frankly, one shouldn't leave your establishment wishing they'd gone to the Starbucks down the street simply because they encounter a rude staff member. I'm not sure of when the next time I'll be in Austin will be, but I can't say I'd go back if I had the option...not a completely terrible place, but it definitely doesn't stand out as a \\"must stop here\\" location."},{"name":"The Sunset Cafe","address":"851 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I have lived in the area for about 10 years and finally ventured in last Saturday evening.  It's nicer on the inside than I thought, although they really do need new chairs and tables.  The faded awning outside also really needs to go as it does nothing to make you want to go there.\\n\\nOur experience started out rocky and stayed rocky for the 2.5 hours the two of us were there.  As there was nice live music, the place seemed to be more crowded than what I usually notice walking by.  The dinning room was about 2/3 full and was manned only by two waitstaff.  There was neither hostess nor bus boys -- the result was two stressed servers who simply could not keep up given the number of tables and the fact most guests seemed to order alcohol, apps, entrees and desserts.\\n\\nIt was a fortunate thing that the waitress brought us bread because it took 50 minutes for our appetizer to arrive.  At the 1.25 hour mark, the waitress came back to tell us that my entree was not available and I would have to pick something else.  At close to the 2 hour mark we were brought another table's food.  \\n\\nOur waitress was nice enough throughout and apologized constantly.  Our food actually was good once it was correctly served. \\n\\nWhat was incredibly insulting to me and to all the other patrons was the complete failure of the manager to do a damn thing during the 2.5 hours I watched him come in and out of the dining room.  He looked directly at tables that needed busing, empty water glasses and visibly upset patrons -- such as the table next to ours which eventually walked out.  He did absolutely nothing.  What good restaurant manager ever does that?\\n\\n The fellow would stand in the area nearest the server station and look repeatedly at his phone and glance at the room.  At some point I was tempted to go over and get the water pitcher he was standing next to to start pouring water for 4 to 6 tables with no water.   \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place as the music was good and the food decent.

The decor is nice - reminds me of uptown Dallas in that casual but trendy way.  The muzak got on my nerves - a bit TOO generic.  How about some soft jazz instead, or maybe some classical?  The music was nowhere near good enough to be as loud as it was, either. \\n\\nApparently, there is no wine list, so the bartender acts as a Sommelier.  I can't say I'm terribly fond of the approach; my memory is terrible for recited lists, especially with unfamiliar vineyards, and I had no idea of what was available by glass as opposed to by the bottle.  A friend advised me that they didn't print a list because the selection changed too often.  Note to Ms. B's - print out a list, on regular cheap printer paper, and slip it in a menu jacket.  I want to know what's available, how it's available, and what I'm going to pay for it.\\n\\nI began the evening with a glass of chardonnay, recommended by the bartender.  I did find a decent chardonnay, which for me means mild with only a hint of oak flavor, but it was a bit buttery.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the year or vineyard - sorry!  The bartender/Sommelier did bring me a glass and pour a sample first, which I appreciated.\\n\\nI ordered a half dozen raw oysters, and found them to be moderately good.  They're served shooter-style (in a shot glass), which I find tacky and unrefined (thanks, Hooters!), and are nowhere near cold enough.  Given that they're supposed to be stored between 0dg and 4dg Celsius, I found the only somewhat cool temperature and overly firm texture to be offputting.  Certainly not the best oysters I've ever had, and I certainly didn't expect to pay $10 for 1/2 dozen mediocre oysters.\\n\\nMy dining partner ordered a cup of gumbo.  A bit bland until he salted it, and then it came alive.  It is much darker than most gumbos I've had, but I enjoyed the spoonfuls I stole from him very much.\\n\\nMy entree came with a salad, which was delivered at the same time as my oysters.  This did not please me - appetizers are supposed to be the first thing on the table, PRIOR to the salads.  For a place that ran up a $70 bill for two people, I expect better.  The salad  was composed of field greens with carrot strips, and coated with a balsamic vinaigrette.  GOOD GOD, LAY OFF THE VINEGAR!  Every bite left my mouth in a pucker, and I did not finish the salad, which is unusual for me.\\n\\nThe saving grace?  The main course.  I indulged in a crab-stuff flounder, and it was exquisite.  A delicate fish, overstuffed with crab, with a tender red creme sauce - magnifique!  The fish was perfectly cooked all over, which is impressive, and the stuffing was flavorful without overwhelming the more delicate flounder tastes.  The dish was two stuff fillets, each about 1.5 times the size of my fist, served with julienne vegetables (squash and zucchini).  Strangely, which the servings of fish and crab were enormous and their flavors delicate and complementary, the vegetables were very small in quantity and heavily salted.  I didn't find that the two made a good match, and would advise the chef to use less salt and more veggies.\\n\\nMy dining partner ordered the blackened red snapper, which was quite tasty as well.  I think it may be a misnomer to call it blackened, since there was almost no char on the fish at all, but instead a black sauce with a fantastic flavor.  In Ms B's defense, the server did warn that it as VERY delicately blackened.  I didn't get a chance to try his vegetables.\\n\\nWe declined desert because we were too full, though again, there was no list, and the server had to recite everything.  What is it with Ms. B's lack of menus?\\n\\n\\nWhile I liked the server, I felt he was trying to hard to be my friend.  I do not want to hear anecdotes about how your mother went to Woodstock while you were pregnant when I'm paying $35 a plate for my meal.  It's fun and great at Curra's or Freddie's, but annoying at a nicer restaurant.  I was dressed in ripped jeans and a tshirt, and my friend only slightly nicer, so I gather that the server was trying to meet what he thought was our expectation.  I suggest that he not do that.  And that's my biggest complaint with the service - a little too much on the anecdotes.  The food was prompt, his explanation of the specials was clear and concise, and he was forthright about the way dishes varied from the expected norm (eg, the blackened snapper).  He neither hovered nor was excessively absent.\\n\\nIn all, I came away with a positive opinion of the establishment.  A bit more salt in the gumbo (which could come off the veggies) and a bit less storytelling would've made this a five star review.  The oysters I let slide, since like sushi, I don't expect truly good oysters from anywhere that doesn't specialize in it.\\n\\n2 Glasses Chardonnay\\n1/2 Dozen Oysters\\n2 House Salads w/Balsamic Vinaigrette\\nBlackened Red Snapper\\nCrab-Stuffed Flounder\\n$69.69 (not kidding)"},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"best hole in the wall spot.  its a gem.  its always busy and you will have to wait at times but you will not regret.   everything has perfect amount of flavor and the ingredients they use is top notch fresh."},{"name":"Cook Out","address":"403 Moreland Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here because I heard the food was cheap and decent.

To keep your eyes from getting strained, I'm going to list this off real quick like. \\n\\nI had the two best espresso drinks I've had in my life at this place. I also had several of some of the worst, but certainly not THE worst. That is reserved for my $150 Krups POS in my kitchen. \\n\\nThere are some really cool employees here. There are some really uncool employees here. \\n\\nGrackles on the front porch shit on my shoulder, then on my laptop, forcing me to move. Then small bugs invaded my laptop. Note to self: avoid front patio unless wearing a poncho and not eating or doing anything. Back porch is okay though.\\n\\nThe chips here are stale. It's like a signature thing almost, but not intentionally. Well, maybe it is, but I'm going to pretend it's just that nobody that works here likes corn chips so they just didn't know.\\n\\nThe french toast here with fruit and whipped cream is pretty tasty. They have breakfast tacos and migas served all day. They also have pastas, salads, quesadillas, sandwiches, and desserts (and more, look at the menu on their website). All of 'em are pretty tasty. \\n\\nThe parking seems to suck, but they ALWAYS have one spot open when I go. Works out for me as long as you don't go. If you do, though, you better recognize me driving around angry in the parking lot and let me have yours for leading you here and telling you about my spot. ;)\\n\\nThe water out of the fountain here tastes like tap water. Bleh. \\n\\nThe bathrooms are too close to the dining area so sometimes, well, you don't need the details right?\\n\\nAll in all, Austin Java is worth it to me. Good place to get some work done if you like a medium-volume medium-tempo crowd around you and some good food. Just watch out for those amateur baristas and the grackles and you'll do just fine.

I judge a place based on its drip coffee. It's so easy to do well, but Austin Java's drip is not great. Maybe the beans are overroasted, or maybe the drip process is not great, but I didn't even finish my cup, which is saying something. Look, not everything has to be single-origin pour-overs for me to like it, but with the large amount of fantastic coffee in Austin, it really wouldn't take much to bump up the beans a couple notches. \\n\\nAnd then the food. It's plentiful and comes out hot, that's for sure. But everything came across as kind of bland. I had the chicken and waffles, a dish that is somewhat sacred to me, and although I loved the texture of the chicken, there was zero flavor. I doused it in salt and syrup. Still nothing.

Our waiter was efficient, friendly, and very attentive despite the fact that some servers might have overlooked us as we were tucked away in the back corner.\\n\\nI love the lighting in this place.

And the funky bathroom sinks are really worth the trip alone.\\n\\nWe managed to make happy hour and quickly ordered drinks (mojito for me; house marg for him) and the yam and chorizo hash.

My mojito was excellent, not too sweet and a bit on the dry side. My only criticism is that it could have been a touch stronger on the alcohol.\\n\\nFor entrees I got the beef tip enchiladas and my husband ordered the haba√±ero pulled pork tacos. My dish was lovely, served in a small cast iron skillet and sizzling away. The beef tips were juicy, seared on the outside and tender on the inside, topped with tortillas and cheese and surrounded with rice and beans. Quite a delicious undertaking to navigate.

It has all of the makings to be a great neighborhood spot -- cozy location, charming ambience and a good foundation of a menu, but the execution isn't there.\\n\\nOur service was terrible and left us feeling really awkward.  When I asked for a glass of white wine, the man just said \\"ok.\\"  Since he didn't bother to ask what kind I wanted, I asked what varietals of white they had.  He just turned and pointed to a bunch of bottles on a very high, distant shelf and said \\"they're up there.\\"  No offer of an explanation or a description.  I don't have bad eyesight, but there's no way I could have read the bottles from that spot.  When I asked for a straw for my water, the staff said yes, but they didn't know where they were.  When I went to pour my own glass of wine, I noticed there was a lipstick stain on the glass.  I went inside to ask for a new one, and the man at the counter pretended like he didn't see me walk in even though we made eye contact.  I stood there for about a minute before he turned around to acknowledge me.  I asked if I could have a glass that didn't have lipstick on it, and instead of apologizing, he just said \\"ok.\\"  The ordering process also proved to be quite difficult since the staff wasn't clear on what they had that night and what they were out of.  Overall, every interaction my husband and I had with the staff was really awkward and made us feel unwelcome.\\n\\nThe food was even worse than the service.  Our meal came out about five minutes after we ordered it, which means there was no way it was cooked to order.  My husband had the tri-tip steak, and it's pretty impossible to cook a steak like that in such a short period of time.  It wasn't cooked medium rare like he ordered it, and the texture was strange.  It seemed like it was steamed, kind of like a steak you get at a bad wedding reception.  The fries were pretty tasty and so was the aioli, but the steak should have been the star.  I had the mushroom pappardelle, which was so bad I actually left in a bad mood.  The pasta was over cooked, and everything else in the dish was absolutely flavorless.  I guess the salt and pepper is hiding in the same place as the straws they can't find.  A bowl of pasta with butter and Kraft parmesan cheese out of a can would have been a vast improvement.  I hardly touched it.\\n\\nI'm really hoping this place can turn itself around because it would be great to have a cozy little neighborhood spot.

I've come here for everything from a romantic date to catching up with a group of friends to dinner with the parents, and I think the main reason I keep coming back is that among all the other excellent restaurants in Boston, the value just can't be beat here. The tapas dishes are all reasonably priced to start with- many of which are very generous with portion size-, but combine that with all the awesome specials, lucky draws, neighborhood nights, and other deals, and you'll always walk away without having dropped a ton of cash but your belly will be very happy.\\n\\nIt's not just about value though; the atmosphere is adorable and romantic, and the quality of the food is solid as well. I'm rarely disappointed in any of the tapas, and typically order some of my usual favorites- patatas bravas, gambas al aijio- mixed in with whatever else I'm feeling that night (check out that night's specials). \\n\\nWith regards to the entrees and desserts though, I've had mixed experiences, so I might recommend sticking to the tapas; I'm not the biggest fan of their paella, and once had a flan that just tasted like sweet scrambled eggs, but the other day I had baked haddock in a saffron sauce via a special prix fixe which was quite nice, and most of their other desserts are pretty yummy (the bread pudding and pastel vasco come to mind). Good prices on the wine/sangria too (especially the specials on offer), and they usually have a few bottles of craft beer on offer as well.\\n\\nI think Tasca is a bit of a hidden gem. It's not the newest tapas restaurant, nor most trendy, nor most inventive or exciting; but it delivers a pretty consistent experience and is always my default when I get a craving for Spanish food.

There are only a couple in TO and they are mediocre. One of the places even used spaghetti noodles. No way! \\n\\nBeing the avid lover of a good steaming bowl of ramen noodles, I have tried all of the most popular on Yelp. The competition in Vancouver is pretty stiff but for me Motomachi Shokudo sits at the top. I've been several times and tried several of the different types of ramen that they serve. The taste is authentic and consistently I have had good ramen and a pleasant experience. A detailed breakdown follows.\\n\\nBROTH. Lighter than other restaurants in town and you get a choice of salt, soy, miso. The lighter style broth seems to be their signature. Just personal preference really, but I prefer it to other places including the one next door. It is less greasy but still extremely flavorful. \\n\\nPORK. This is critical and it is the one area where ramen shops outside of Japan just can't nail it. The problem is that the fat distribution throughout the pork is usually uneven. Either it's too fatty or too lean. You get  big chunks of fat or big chunks of lean pork and the fat separates from the lean part. Ideally, the fat should be well integrated with several layers of lean meat and alternating fat and they should not separate from each other. I guess the pigs in Japan are just different or something. \\n\\nGiven the disadvantage with the raw ingredient, the pork here is still not at the level that you would get in a decent ramen shop in Japan but it is pretty admirable. It was not the ideal pork of my dreams but it was tender, flavorful,  fat distribution was decent with a good lean to fat ratio and the whole piece was intact. In my opinion it is the best I have had in town. One thing they do here that is a bit different.They grill the sliced pork on a hot plate before adding it to the soup. I don't think that it adds anything flavour-wise. It looks nice but more importantly I don't get an ice cold slice of pork in my soup like I got at Kintaro one time. It's a simple thing but the attention to detail is a nice touch. Pork good.\\n\\nNOODLES. I don't know if they are made on the premises but they had a good al dente bite to them when the soup was delivered. Nothing spectacular but they were passably good. Other than that, I don't have too much to say about the noodles but I do need to get something off my chest. I noticed many other diners in the restaurant eating their ramen at a leisurely pace while their noodles expanded and doubled in size in their bowls. Hey folks! Quit talking and eat your Noodles! They can't be good when they get all mushy like that. I also saw some poor girl sitting next to me use her chopticks to roll up the noodles in her spoon like pasta. Seriously, c'mom. Quit playing with your food. You're in a ramen shop. It's fast food. Go ahead and slurp it up. Don't be afraid to make some noise. Okay, I feel better. \\n\\nCONDIMENTS. The soup condiments really shine here. Lot's of tasty veggies. I am not a hard boiled egg fan. The menu says they come from an organic farm or something. My wife says they are sweet and the best she has had. I always give her mine and she still orders extra. \\n\\nSIDE DISHES. The gyoza are okay but again nothing spectacular.  I do highly recommend the mini pork donburi. Basically, it is a mixture of pork, lotus root and other vegetables stewed/braised in soy-based sauce and served on rice with a bit of Japanese style mayonnaise and shredded nori on top as a garnish. Man is it Deelish! I guess everything tastes great with mayo on it. Kind of strange but you can only get it as a side order in addition to a bowl of ramen and they bring it out as an appetizer. I wish I could just order a larger size of this sometime instead of ramen. If you get the mini pork donburi, an order of gyoza, ramen and a beer you are going to roll out of here and need a nap. \\n\\nDECOR/ATMOSPHERE. When I think ramen, I think hole in the wall. Decor is secondary and totally optional but here things are tasteful, low-key and way nicer here than other places. They even have nice lighting. Not what you normally expect. That said, I would still come even if they had big strip florescent lights and plastic chairs. \\n\\nThe staff are lovely. The service has been pleasant, efficient and professional every time. As for space, it is a bit cramped with a single communal table, a few bar seats and tables for two. If you need to use the restroom you will surely be squeezing by other patrons or the servers as they fly around the room with hot bowls of soup. Watch out! My wife and I are early diners and on every visit they were pretty close to capacity so I don't know if you will have to wait if you come at prime time.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE. This is now my go to place when I have the urge for ramen."},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love going to this restaurant.

Food orders take a while to emerge from the kitchen.\\n\\nRecently I ordered a don Katsu combo to go, which came with a small order of fried rice and a shredded lettuce salad topped ginger dressing. I wasn't a fan of the ginger miso dressing. The dressing was overwhelmingly gingery. The fried rice was super peppery and hard to eat (don't breathe in or you WILL choke). The don Katsu wasn't bad with the teriyaki sauce, but I've had much better.\\n\\nOverall, a halfhearted attempt, but I was hungry and craving don Katsu, while my sister was craving sushi. Sushi Yuki was our best bet for something quick to take to go."},{"name":"St. Honor√© Boulangerie","address":"2335 NW Thurman St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ate there this past Sunday, before a drive out to Hood River.

The menu has 13 designer pizzas available such as tomato, fontina, romano, garlic and basil.  Maine lobster with corn, scallion with cilantro oil.  Pepperoni or sopressata, tomato, fontina and romano.  I had the Pepperoni.  The crust is grilled before the toppings are added and then baked, I know this because they have an open kitchen where you can watch them make the pies.  The crust is about as thick as a saltine cracker, only chewier and quite good.  You can order a whole oval pie which you could finish since the pie is so thin, but if you have a salad, half will do.  Ingredients were very fresh and the selections were very creative.  I approve of this concept as long as you are not going in there looking for traditional charcoal pizza.\\nI had a iceberg lettuce wedge with roasted shallot dressing.  The lettuce was fresh but the dressing was bland, bland, bland with hardly any cilantro flavor and the texture of the dressing was gummy and had no tang.   There were no other ingredients other than the lettuce and dressing, I though it could have used chopped tomato or bacon bits or red onions for contrast and flavor.  \\nThey have no regular iced tea, only bottled and sweetened peach tea.  Note to owner: Iced tea please.\\nThey have one desert on the menu- Tiramisu ice cream.....must be good. I did not order it.  \\nThey also have a good beer and wine selection.\\nI definitely would go back, the atmosphere was young, hip urban with elevated booths and concrete floor.   The service is slow and not very attentive, I had to ask for another pellegrino even though the waiter stopped by the table twice while my bottle was empty.  The salad took way too long to arrive (15 MIN) given all they had to do was cut the wedge and dump the dressing on it.  None of the staff was smiling and there was no management supervision viable.

Crust is the perfect for me (on the thinner side, but not too thin) and is light and crispy. \\n\\nFrozen yogurt is also good. \\n\\nHaven't tried all the Greek food. I know they are Greek, but they do pizza good  haven't ventured to Greek menu yet. \\n\\nThey have always gotten my order correct (I usually get light sauce and they get it right). \\n\\nPick up is generally ready in 10-15 minutes, and delivery in less than 30. \\n\\nOwner who works at counter is pretty short with you, but he does his job. The girl who works there is always helpful and friendly (although I think she doesn't answer the phones). \\n\\nThe value is really the best. Large pizza is big and feeds my boyfriend and I for a few meals and costs around $15.

I ordered a couple of breakfast wraps (like breakfast burritos).\\n\\nWhen they arrived, not only were they really small (I ordered a burrito from a food card the day before for the exact same price that was at least twice the size of this), but the tortillas weren't toasted at all. They were just limp and excessively flour-y, as if they'd been pulled straight out of a package from winco and slapped right down on the paper. There was no spice or flavor in any of the fillings whatsoever. It literally tasted like cardboard. I tried cutting up the few veggies I had in the fridge and adding it, and while it helped a little, it wasn't great. There was no salt at all. \\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give it one star is because it didn't actually make me sick. But I'm kind of upset that I wasted $24 on something like this. I'm not leaving a poor review to be nasty; I just wouldn't want anybody else to see all of the great reviews and think, like I did, that this is the best place around to order breakfast from.

It would have been understandable if we even got another plate from Tanya in order to \\"split\\" our food, but we didn't. So what would we be paying $5 for? \\n\\nTanya was very rude about this and spoke to us in degrading tones. We asked to speak with the manager. She went in the back and came out in a few minutes stating that the manager said \\"it's on the menu, so read it again.\\" The menu says \\"Splitting of Plates--$5 upcharge.\\" The fact is, we still did not use the restaurant's service to \\"split\\" our food. If the restaurant wants to punish customers for sharing food on their own, then it should be clearly stated as something like, \\"we will charge you $5 for sharing your food, or for having us split your plate for you in the kitchen.\\"\\n\\nOverall, very poor and unprofessional service from both Tanya and the manager of this restaurant. \\n\\nWas this just poor customer service in general?

Before, I could finish my wedges and look over the menu a small plate of two partial waffles were placed on our table.  I asked, \\"Where did this come from?\\"  Apparently, it was their regular practice to provide samples.  We both were THRILLED with the flavor of their \\"Original\\" or \\"Liege\\" waffle and their chocolate waffle.  Our eyes nearly popped out of our heads.  Ok, faces.  But, I guess our faces are technically part of our heads therefore, our eyes could pop out of our heads.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken waffles.  When my order arrived it was, I initially thought, a small piece of fried chicken.  Then, I started to eat the whole thing.  I ate the WHOLE thing.  The waffles were buttery and sweet without being heavy and too ooey, gooey.  \\n\\nMy PID usually uses quite a bit of syrup.  She barely used any syrup.  The waffles were not too sweet.

So why am I writing this? Glad you were thinking that. My family are basically locals in Orlando even though we live 45 mins away on the Atlantic. We don't go out to eat all that often anymore but when in town make it a point to get some babybacks at Tony Roma's. We walked in on a Friday around 5 ish to a relatively empty place I asked if we could have a booth where the fake fire is since the kids enjoy it to which we got a hold on let me check, and then the 'hostess manager?' promptly said no taking us to a booth in the corner of the restaruant \\"with a view of the fire .\\" Phew glad that's over. Oh wait just the beginning. So we were sat in fly city I killed 6 before our mediocre at best onion loaf arrived. I killed 3 more before the kids entress arrived. Our waitress overall was outstanding, although her explanation of fly city was made up on the fly haha see what I did there. Anyway, our full rack dinners came out and they were crazy dry we used a whole bottle of BBQ sauce on them (we love the BBQ sauce at Roma's but not that much) As our early dinner progressed I stayed locked in a battle against the flies of roma. We had made it known several times we weren't thrilled to be dining in fly city but surprisingly nothing was done about it. As a guest of a restaurant I'm used to a manager coming over to check on you once, guess what? No manager!!! Well maybe he/she was waiting until we were going to leave....Nope!!! So I said earlier there was a reason for me to write a review again the reason is we left a phone number and were assured that a manager would be in contact as soon as they werent busy. Well that never happened, must've thought we were just some tourists. So thank you Tony Romas for the lackluster food, the disgusting fly city corner booth, and most of all not giving us that call especially since we handed all the dead flies to y'all wrapped up nice and neat in our napkins, rib bibs, and whatever else we could swat them with.

The menu changes on the daily based on the availability of local ingredients and also in what foragers (who they have on staff) are able to bring in that day. 99% of all ingredients they use are locally sourced, organic and non-GMO. Pretty much all the entree plates are made to share, all are relatively small so that you have room to try other absolutely delicious items on the menu. Oh AND a cart comes out a few times while you are dining with small bites of other amazing foods that you can (or don't have to). They call them \\"dim sum\\" but that got nothing to do with Chinese cuisine, it's more for the style of delivery. Some of the best dishes that all four of us loved were the sunchokes, romaine salad (not your average salad! Comes with nice crispy elements), short ribs, aged pork and pasta! Also crudo and makarel were also pretty amazing. Beef tartar was one of our favorites from the cart and for dessert, burnt milk was so unique and tasty! Honestly, everything was on point and perfectly seasoned. We all agreed that blue crab tapa from the cart was just alright, not bad but fades in comparison to everything else.

I ordered the BBQ brisket with \\"sweet tea\\" caramelized onions with the truffle fries with rosemary on top. The brisket was average tasting but very tender, but thankfully they give you BBQ sauce on the side for dipping/pouring which made it yummy. The fries were very crunchy, (I'm more of a crispy fries person, but to each it's own), but were tasty. The price range is affordable, mostly under $10!

If offers the option to give zero, I would still give one star. \\n\\nIt was beautiful, so we opted to sit outside. We beat the rush, and the addition of the bird wires have made a huge difference.

I went for the biscuits as well, but was feeling ham and grits. I have been let down twice on the eggs Benedict being overcooked, so I opted to go with something much, much easier. \\n\\nThe typical steps would have been....warm biscuit, put on plate, cover in sausage gravy. This test was too tall for the Saturday crew, we received our meals. Our daughters seemed fine, my wife and I had a biscuit with a lake of gravy, soaking up in our sides. I elected to dive in first, it didn't look healthy, but what sausage gravy does?? What sausage gravy is also made out of blue cheese???? This one!! Both of our plates were slathered in some sort of blue cheese cream sauce. Like maybe what you would put on a burger. We had set our expectations low, but nothing could have readied me for that bite. Total wtf moment. Our server no manager were both very apologetic and offered to refire, but we declined. We are now scarred for life. Market street cafe, you have let us down. It is apparent that the cooking will never get better. We can only hope that another restaurant or diner will start serving sit down breakfast in the village.

The website says \\"a typical meal here costs half as much as a big city steakhouse,\\" and they're right, but they also say it's just as good. A lot of other Yelpers agree with that statement, but I just can't. We've eaten in many of the best steak houses in Boston, but I must say this place doesn't even come close. \\n\\nWe did enjoy looking at the pictures of Jack Williams, Johnny Damon, Gov Weld, etc., and the bar and TVs were aceptable, but that's about it. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the NY sirloin steak with green beans, and I ordered the petit filet mignon/shrimp scampi combo with mashed potatoes, as well as a cup of onion soup. A small salad came with the meal. \\n\\nBecause the parmesan peppercorn dressing (on the side) was very thick, Mr K asked for a little olive oil to loosen it up. Ten minutes later, out came the olive oil, no spoon in sight. Not easy using a fork but it worked after a few attempts. \\n\\nThe NY sirloin came out on a sizzling plate (I wasn't sure why and didn't question it) and my husband didn't enjoy it too much until he got to the \\"meat\\" of the steak. Everything else was grizzle. My meal was totally bland and dry. I've never had such a tasteless filet before. And the shrimps were overcooked and dry. And my potatoes had way too much salt.\\n\\nThe bread was a soft crusted loaf of Italian bread; not that impressive. Wasn't even warm. And we had to ask for bread twice. We shouldn't have bothered.\\n\\nAfter we got the bill, we noticed that my husband received a SIZZLER sirloin steak by mistake and not the NY sirloin he had ordered. Mr. Andelman (or one of the phantom diners) raved about the sizzler, but the word \\"rave\\" would be the last one I'd use to describe how we felt about my husband's dinner. Not so good. \\n\\nThe service was awful, the meal was subpar. The waiter never came by to see how our meal was or ask if we needed anything else...and we did need water and a spoon for the oil. We had asked our younger daughter and her husband to join us but thank goodness they said they couldn't. Would have loved to see them, but this wouldn't have been a good place to meet.\\n\\nThis place is considered a neighborhood establishment and has entertainment. The piano player was someone you'd expect at one of the hotels in the Catskills. Not our cup of tea, but others seemed to enjoy themselves. \\n\\nWill never come back, although Rocco, the manager, told us to let him know when we'd be coming by again so he could make up for our bad meal and experience. Thanks, but no thanks.\\n\\nADDENDUM: Tonight we BBQd sirloin tips and lamb chops and they were two zillion times better than the sirloin we had at Frank's last night, at 1/5 the price.

The beers are all pretty tasty; not standouts, but all very solid beers that you can spend an evening with.\\n\\nThe food is also really tasty; i don't know if i was just really hungry or what, but the bacon cheeseburger with porter barbecue seemed like the best thing ever at the time.  My only wish was that i had more of the barbecue.  The appetizers were okay to good; the nachos were substantial, but the assorted chicken wing type products were very 'meh'.  \\n\\nIt's crowded in the winter, but awesome to eat outside in nicer weather.  The fire pit outside is kinda cool, too; i couldn't tell if they let you drink out there.  We had a reservation so we got a big comfy table in the back.

It is not just tasty, it keeps shape, when in contact in soy sauce. If you are perfectionist and want to rotate nigiri to deep fish in soy sauce, you can be sure, rice will keep shape. If you deep rice, it will keep shape in sauce too. We like their fish, because it is well cut and fresh. As about chicken, orange, bourbon and teriyaki are good and stable.

Instead, these pastas were devoured at such velocity that it didn't even occur to me to take a pedestrian photo of gorgeous food.  Indeed, the cacio e pepe - perhaps the most traditional of dishes one will find at Emmer & Rye - sported such distinctive taste from the use of an exceptional cheese (Challerhocker) and perfectly cooked pasta (Blue Beard) that it had a shelf life of maybe five milliseconds once placed on our table.  Equally enjoyable was a Middle Eastern labneh served with an absolutely decadent Eastern bread that perhaps most resembled South Indian paratha.  Another favorite of mine was a chicken pate pie.  Given that this dish came from the dim sum menu, it may not be available (which may be true of many dishes anyhow as this menu changes frequently).   The lack neck, heavy in cumin, was another exceptional selection.  As was their take on pancakes.

Our waiter was very friendly and quick to take our orders, while also not rushing us at any point. \\n\\nSecondly, the food was really on point. We ordered the gnocchi with salmon as our appetizer, and I've honestly never had gnocchi that good before. Incredible. Regarding entrees, I had read before that the salads were overpriced but I actually disagree. I got the Tenderloin Salad and yes, it's not cheap, but--I kid you not--it is the hugest salad I've ever consumed and the tenderloin portion was at least as big as a full steak. So I actually think the salad portions--especially considering the amount of amazing tenderloin on my plate--were quite generous. Beyond the portioning, everything about that salad was absolutely delicious and perfectly done. \\n\\nBottom line: I may not be a Boston native but as a frequent patron of fine NYC establishments, I thought Stephanie's on Newbury was a stand-out meal on my Boston vacation.

So... needless to say I'm grossed out. Brownies were barely mediocre and certainly do not warrant their own cafe. Make sure you get them warmed because they are pretty cold.

These tacos have way too mauch sauce on it.  They were all dripping wet.  I tried pollo, carne asada, pastor pork, and 2 barbacaos.  The barbacoas were probably the best tasting out of the lot.

As a chain, the quality is generally consistent (in my experience). \\n\\nThis particular location pleases me. There's a few quick options along this portion of high street (Wendy's, Taco Bell), but it's mostly bars and restaurants. I usually stop in here for a snack if I'm getting a particularly lengthy service at the nearby Salon Lofts, or if I'm walking back downtown to return to work (iced tea!). There's some outdoor seating and on the weekends, this really feels like a neighborhood gathering place. The neighborhood would suffer if there weren't a good midday option for a refreshment. However, they close kinda early, so if it's late afternoon check the hours. \\n\\nOne time, I ordered a sandwich, paid for it, and then waited a really long time before realizing it hadn't even been made yet. Something just got lost in the shuffle. Luckily I wasn't in a hurry, and this story has a happy ending.

I'd already paid, so this was a great option. I wasn't even mad... since I wasn't in a hurry (and understand these things happen sometimes), I really was not disgruntled at all.

It has both a lounge area AND a dance floor so you can take turns in between if you can't decide what you're in the mood for. Drinks are pricey, but this is a club in an upscale hotel in Boston so create expectations accordingly. Expect to spend at least $13 per cocktail. \\n\\nSo why only three stars? I recently returned and, for whatever reason, they decided it would be prudent to add a $20 cover. Now don't get me wrong, it's a fun time... but $20 cover + expensive drinks fun time? No. You can go right down the street to Storyville and get in for free to have about an equal clubbing experience. And there are a multitude of lounges in Boston hotels that don't charge cover (just expect less dancing). \\n\\nApparently if you check in on Yelp you can get the fee waived AS LONG AS you go there before 11pm. \\n\\nBasically, this place could be good if you plan ahead.

First of all, from the outside, the place looks like it closed down 3 years ago and is housing vagrants.  There doesn't appear to be any windows, an observation made by one of my coworkers who then compared it similarly to strip clubs that he doesn't go to.  Inside, same deal, huge potential, kind of a grandish entrance, maybe even a coat check room, a separate bar, mirrors, but still kind of dated, unkept, some of the mirrors were broken.  Tthe main dining room looked like a set for a kung fu movie, an older kung fu movie with no special effects but with tons of ninjas actually jumping off things and running around and flying from things.  Looks like it could be amazing looking, if they really tried...operative word being \\"could\\" and \\"if.\\"  \\n\\nAs for the food, we were really impressed with the dim sum, seemed just like chinatown.  There were even a lot of chinese people eating there, so it must meet some kind of authenticity standard.  The ladies pushing the carts seemed really nice too, didn't speak english, but nice.  The food was good, we ended up spending about $17 each, which is a lot....but we got waaay too much for 2 people, awesome thing was that they wrapped up the stuff we couldn't finish so we could take it home.  We'd definitely do dim sum again.\\n\\nNow the lunch buffet, that's different.  The place was pretty much empty, there were maybe 3 tables taken the whole time we were there, and this place is pretty big.  They had a fairly large selection of food, but quality was between poor and fair.  The hot and sour soup sucked.  Even the peking ravioli was weird and veggie-ish.  General gau's was hard/chewy.  Most of the sauted type dishes were ok, like kung pao and beef broccoli and stuff, most of the fried things were over fried.  They did have pork buns which were pretty good.  Service was good too, someone was always there to take our dirty plates from us.  I doubt we'd go back for a work week lunch.  Far East Cafe is closer for us and is better IMO.  The saving grace for this place was when our server brought us our fortune cookies for 5 of us.  She did this thing with her hands and made these sound effects that essentially shuffled up the cookies to land in the center of the table.  We were all very impressed b/c it was completely unexpected, but I'm sure a 2 year old would've been also."},{"name":"Sandoval's Cafe & Cantina","address":"460 SW Miller Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent wait staff, the burgers are very flavorful juicy and tasty.

And we were not disappointed. Immediately when we walked in we recognized Tiffani Faison, an owner and head chef, cooking in the back and dancing to Pearl Jam, which immediately had us pumped up for the night. \\n\\nThe place was packed so we put our names on a waiting list and went to the bar to wait. Our bartender (young guy, I forget his name) welcomed us as soon as we sat down and told us about the special draft beers and helped me choose a delicious full boded IPA and my better half a delicious drink, \\"The Heartless Jezebel.\\" We loved that the cups were mason drinks and were digging our night. \\n\\nWe were quoted a 20 min wait time, but it was more like 10 or 15 before the hostess took us to our seats and  we were looking at the menu. We loved the tables and the mismatched chairs. Defly a playful atmosphere on family style dining. Also let me just say kudos for the selection of music. I was a little fearful that, like other BBQ joints i've been to they would be playing country and honky tonk music, but not Sweet Cheeks, we were jamming to great rock and roll from the 90's and 2000's.\\n\\nOur waitress was prompt and informative filling us in on the sauces available and answering questions about the items on the menu. I had pulled pork w/ broccoli and cheese casserole and potato salad. She had the half a chicken with the same sides. we also ordered the bucket of biscuits, because we love biscuits especially when they come in buckets.\\n\\ni started to get plate envy when the couple next to us got fried green tomatoes, but then our biscuits came. Four serious biscuits in a serious bucket. They were huge and I was afraid they would be heavy but they weren't. They were light and melted in your mouth, especially with the honey butter they are served with.\\n\\nThen are trays of food came, also no joke. I was surprised by the amount of food, sometimes you go to restaurants with a high price point (which they are, you just need to prepare for that so you're not shocked) and the food you get is disappointing, as was recently the case when we went to Legal Seafood. But my companion's chicken was a legit half a chicken and I had had a very healthy serving of pulled pork.\\n\\nBoth of our proteins were perfectly cooked and the meat was falling of her bone and broke apart easily in my fingers. My pork was juicy and flavorful before adding their homemade BBQ and hot sauce. My fiance's chicken was, \\"The juiciest chicken I've ever had.\\"\\n\\nAnd then the sides, lord the sides. The broccoli and cheese casserole is amazing.YOU MUST GET THIS SIDE!!! All the food was great, but that was the part of the dinner we spent the night talking about. If you bite into the potato salad after a bite of the casserole, the textures, temperatures and flavors make both dishes stand out more.\\n\\nWe both left full and feeling like a food coma was imminent.\\n\\nYou also know the food is very well prepared and fresh because you don't feel greasy and bloated like I have after some other BBQ means I've had in the state. You are full, but you don't fill sick.\\n\\nThe restaurant is loud, fun and inviting. It's a bar feel without the normal drawbacks of a bar.\\n\\nThe restaurant is only several weeks old and is already has a fantastic menu knowledgeable staff and a strong point of view. I can't wait to watch this place grow over the coming months including the outdoor dining area which they are starting to build now, which will be great in those hot summer nights before or after a Sox game.\\n\\nNot only do we plan to go back and have some of those fried green tomatoes, but we plan on being regulars!\\n\\nGreat job to Tiffani and the staff of SweetCheeks BBQ!"},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"Pignewton..

It's a margarita made with pomegranate flavored tequila.  So delicious, it didn't even taste like it was made with alcohol....dangerous.  \\n\\nAll 3 salsas were really good.  My favorite was the super spicy one.  And boy was it spicy!  But great flavor.  Our first batch of chips were a little chewy, but the second batch was warm and cripsy.  I do think that charging $7 for chips and salsa is a little ridiculous...but nonetheless, I loved it and will order it again if I return.  \\n\\nWe had dinner on the patio, which was wonderful.  Perfect evening, great people watching spot, and fun atmosphere.  I had the Chicken and Yam   Enchiladas, which were great.  Good portion size, with big chunks of juicy chicken and tender yams, all covered in a chile rojo sauce.  One of my friends had the Crispy Tofu and Grilled Vegetable Bowl with nopales and asparagus.  She loved it, and I agreed after I stole a bite or two.  It came with flour tortillas and all 3 salsas on the side.  My other friend ordered the Grilled Chicken Thigh Tacos.

Very, very excited to try Haggis and even more excited for what was promised to be a delicious burger, The Haven just didn't do it for me. I've eaten a wide range of cuisine in my day (still plenty out there to try) but Haggis was a new one. I'm not sure what I should have expected when I tried the Lambs' heart, liver, and lungs, but even in croquette form, it was just off-putting to me. I'm aware this is a burger blog, but it has to be noted, whatever flavor was present in the Haggis that I found so off-putting, seemed to be in the burger as well. Or maybe my palette was just thrown off and couldn't recover.  Could have been a combination of both, really, but I wasn't the only one among the four diners who felt this way. The burger looks good on paper, a half-pound patty with decent juice and char, topped with a bacon and onion marmalade, and Huntsman cheese. (the Stilton element of the cheese was a bit too aggressive) All in all, it's sized well, the bun plays a good complementary role, although the burger itself is much closer to medium-well than the requested medium-rare. But again, that flavor comes back to haunt me, something in that burger reminds me of something in that Haggis and I just can't get past it. Hard to describe, it's assertive, unfamiliar and mostly unpleasant. Trying it's best to be a burger, it's far too different for my seemingly delicate taste buds. Chips, or really thick pub fries if you will, are inconsistent. Some are fluffy and crispy, most are dry and soft, all are pretty under-seasoned, but a few splashes of salt and vinegar at the table quickly solves that problem.\\n\\nIt's tough to be so hard on a place where the servers are a delight, there is passion up and down this quaint little spot in JP,  and everyone seems so happy. But it's just not for me. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try it, food is so subjective, someone else may have a completely different experience and absolutely love the Scottish food served at The Haven, but in the world of Boston's best burgers, this one doesn't measure up."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"12520 SE 93rd Ave","city":"Clackamas","stars":"3.5","text":"Chick-fil-A, my other new favorite restaurant, this happens to be one of the better ones, over KFC, and others.

These patties are THICK and the burger is huge, plus the sides are all very filling. I haven't had a thing on their menu that I haven't liked. The food tastes fresh, it's well made, never burnt or under cooked, the fries, lotus chips and sweet potatoes are always amazing and well made. \\n\\nThis is also one of my favorite places for Bubble Tea! Their flavors are rich and just the right mix of tea and flavoring. I'm not a big fan of bubble tea places that just taste like children's sugar drinks, and this bubble tea is made just right. Their milk teas are sweet and creamy, and the flavors are really bold without being overpoweringly sugary. Their clear tea drinks definitely have a stronger tea taste without compromising the flavors too. And their bubbles and jellies are prepared perfectly without being too hard or too soft. Just the right amount of subtle chewyness that they should be.\\n\\nThe place is pretty small, and it's right next to a cigar bar unfortunately, which makes the place REEK at night x.x If you don't like the smell of smoke, get your dinner orders to go.

The food should be a touch above fast food quality, especially for the price. We ordered the appetizer sampler for $12.99, plus the french onion soup (the only real highlight of our dining experience, and even that I am told, by my more experienced french onion soup eating boyfriend, was mediocre). I found great irony when a taco bell commercial came on one of the many TV screens that their quesadillas taste so much better than those in our sampler. \\n\\nThe ONLY star worthy aspect of our experience was our server.

We just moved to the area 6 months ago, and have been wanting to try Vino Venue. Upon arriving, service was pleasant and we were told to sit wherever we wanted, and that a large party was taking up the back half of the place. We chose a seat near the front, wanting a more intimate experience. The tables and chairs were fine, but seemed a little drab for this type of restaurant. The bar area and long communal tables were nicer. The patio looked inviting for warmer months.\\n\\nOur waiter was pleasant and helpful, offering us advice with wine pairings. We started with a delicious cheese plate - smoked chedder and goat cheese with cranberry relish. Also included were pickles and toasted buttered bread. I had a crisp Italian Savignon Blanc and my Wife had a buttery, lemony Chardonnay. If we had stopped here, or stuck with a couple more appetizers, I probably would've given this place 4 or 5 stars. The problem was with the main entrees.\\n\\nI ordered the seasonal veggie plate and my wife had the lamb. My veggie plate was fine, but not delicious. The food tasted like it had been pre-prepared and warmed up to order. It came with roasted brussel spouts, pickled okra, beets, and a baked potato. Seasoning was light, with nothing really popping with flavor. Maybe this simple preparation is intentional - to let the wine be the real star - but I expected more from a place like this.  \\n\\nMy wife had similar comments on her lamb. Nothing to write home about.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered a pumpkin tart that was quite tasty. We also got to have one bite of the brownie with ice cream (the waiter initially brought the wrong dessert), and it was also very good. We got to sample some port wine, which was one of my favorite wines of the night.\\n\\nIf we went back, we would do wine and a cheese plate, maybe an appetizer or two, and skip right to dessert and more port wine.

My server was able to answer a few cuisine questions and navigate their extremely large and poorly organized menu.  \\n\\nFood arrived quickly well presented.  I started with miso and a garden salad.  Nothing to write home about there, just the typical pre-sushi fare, and I was not unhappy with it.  My appetizer was tuna tataki, and while I felt the tuna was sliced a bit thin for this dish, the seasoning was well done.  I don't recall the name of the roll I had but it involved a smoked salmon roll that was supposed to be sitting atop some sort of creamy sauce.  The sauce ended up smothering the entire roll, actually taking away from the flavor of the ingredients in the roll.

I know its a little thing, but most of the food includes Miso Soup and a salad with Ginger dressing. I will say this, even though its a small thing, these tiny salads are a great thing to have before your sushi comes.  Every time I have been there these salads are crisp and delicious. I know its a small thing but that kind of stuff is important. \\n\\nThe real star of the show is the sushi and sashimi. Sides of wasabi and ginger (classic).

The price is commiserate with the up-and-coming professional population occupying the nearby condos, and may be a little pricey for a family outing to the ballpark.\\n\\nThe best things on the menu, appropriately, are the variety of Barbeque meats, which have occasional tough or burned spots but mostly vary from appropriately dry to tender and delicious. A selection of three basic BBQ sauces -- a Texas gold, a NC vinegar, and a hot sauce additive -- are available for your mix and match pleasure. The best value for money is found in the melt-in-your-mouth oversize buttermilk biscuits with spectacular whipped honey butter.\\n\\nIt's a good thing the meat and biscuits are so tasty, because the sides are dreadful. The cheesy grits are actually a cheese sauce that happens to contain grits as an ingredient, while the macaroni suffers for lack of cheese or moisture. The BBQ baked beans are tough with only chipotle to indicate their BBQ nature. Consider a salad with your meat and biscuits; hopefully they can't mess that up.\\n\\nSweet Cheeks makes sense only for the combination it offers -- location, a bar atmosphere, and decent if not stellar Southern offerings.

About 10 minutes later, here comes our steak tartar. Agitation had begun to rear it's head by this point. There was no more than 2 tablespoons of meat on the plate and a huge pile of bread chips. We didn't need more than two of those chips to lay waste to the meager offering presented to us. It was a quality dish, just an insulting portion. Our burger managed to show up soon after we finished what had become our \\"amuse\\"(that we paid a hefty price for).

My mother had a plate of roasted vermicelli with cod, mussels, shrimp and clams cooked in a lobster broth. There were way too many noodles and the fish flavors didn't blend well.

Served efficiently in a cozy, white table cloth setting, this second location of the original Sichuan Garden will leave a variegated, multi-textured flavor explosion when compared to most other Chinese food in the area.\\n\\nThe dry spiced spare ribs are flash fried in small, one inch bone in chunks and then pan fried with fiery chili peppers that creates a mellow but intensifying. Ironing sensation on the taste buds. The meat is juicy. The heat is very respectable.\\n\\nChili beef tendons are served cold and the chili oil is muted, almost sweet, when combined with the beef.\\n\\nThe fried pork dumplings have a thick wrapper in which extremely well seasoned ground pork and chive nuggets reside. Fried hard on one side, these dumplings are sweet, salty, crispy, chewy.\\n\\nAn order of cellophane noodles with ground pork is so fabulous we order two the next time we eat at Sichuan Garden II. A large helping of slippery noodles are coated in a rich doubanjiang based sauce. The fiery bean paste is subdued by the addition of ginger, garlic and soy. A taste of authentic Sichuan food in this bowl of noodles.\\n\\nThe double cooked bacon with chilli is comprised of thinly sliced, unsmoked, pork belly pan fried with fiery green and red chilis. The luscious pork fat slicks the heat around the mouth.\\n\\nDry spiced beef arrives in a towering pile of beef strips saut√©ed with fiery green peppers with garlic.\\n\\nThe chongquing spicy chicken here uses small cubes of tender chicken breaded and fried hard with loads of firey red chilis.\\n\\nAn order of general gaus chicken, to appease the masses, is not slathered in the typical orange glop so common in most chinese establishments. Instead the chicken is fluffy and moist and doused in a thinner, more flavorful orange sauce.\\n\\nChengdug fiery chicken is spicy. Tender chunks of chicken in a soy dressing tossed with peanuts and chili peppers.\\n\\nSmoky chili hot beef is both smoky and hot. Served with thin string beans, the heat slowly envelopes the senses as the strips of beef melt with each bite.\\n\\nCamphor tea smoked duck has a crisp skin and a smoky taste in the thick slices of bone in duck.\\n\\nThe whole braised tilapia with pickled mustard greens in chilli sauce is fresh and prepared with a crisp skin with a rich, thick chili gravy poured on top. The flesh flakes easily and is best served by spoon.\\n\\nA steel hot pot arrives containing the dong po braised pork shoulder. In the vegetable heavy brown gravy, tender, well marbled hunks of meat float waiting to be scarfed mixing the shimmering gravy with rice. \\n\\nAlthough labeled house special fried rice, this dish is a throwaway, maybe the only dish on the menu that is less than spectacular.\\n\\nSpicy fish bao is not a rice bun dish. This is a bowl of fish based, gelatinous liquid in which tender morsels of white fish have been poached. \\n\\nPork fried dumpling have thick wrappers and are overstuffed with moist ground pork mixed with choice. Even this common dish tastes better at Sichuan Garden.\\n\\nDan dan noodles have a heaping portion of bouncy yellow noddles in a ground pork sauce. Another spectacular rendition.\\n\\nDespite the food being as good as it is, Sichuan Garden is on the map for its beverage program. The Trader Vic's mai tai is a perfect example. Each time, the cocktail arrives with amazing consistency. Unlike many over sweet variations, this one uses fresh lime juice, light and dark rum and an unsweetened orange cura√ßao. The slightly bitter drink poured over shaved ice with a lime sprig is the perfect antidote to some of the spicy items on the menu.\\n\\nMake a reservation and enjoy this place repeatedly."},{"name":"Old Chicago Pizza & Taproom","address":"10300 SE Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"An order of Onion Rings as an appetizer, usually an easy order but when ours arrived...SEVEN Onion Rings were on the plate and most were barely warm, unacceptable.\\nPushing beer and trying to get us to sign up for some club they offer...from 2 servers...we felt bullied to join.

I've only had the dinner menu, and okay, in all fairness, I've only ever had the chopped salad, but it was so good, I still have dreams about that salad.  It's the sort of salad that you can eat for dinner without feeling like you're eating rabbit food.  (Of course the blue cheese, bacon and avocado probably negate any health benefits of the salad anyway, but it's so worth it.)  Although if you're dressing-shy, you might want to order the dressing on the side since they're very generous with it.  I happen to think that's a good thing but I seem to be in the minority of salad eaters on that one.  \\n\\nMy parents really enjoyed the square meal and the thai burrito as well.

Since I love fast food and I love burgers, I have no qualms.\\n\\nI have come multiple times now and it seems to improve each time. The first experience during opening week was a nightmare. Incredibly slow service, sloppy burgers, the ingredients didn't even taste fresh (no flavor to any of the veggies, not even a spice from the jalapenos). Give it another try if you, too, were disappointed then.\\n\\nAtmosphere is pretty lively. Pop music or something upbeat is usually blasting on the sound system. Usually louder at nights or if its filled with BU kids. Very pleasing aesthetic with wood paneling and accents everywhere. Because it's an old Qdoba that they didn't remodel too heavily, there's an awkward entrance ramp and cashier line that snakes through the seating area.\\n\\nFirst glance at the menu and it looks like Shake Shack. Burgers, shakes, and concretes. The burgers here are small compared to most other burger places. The meat is of high quality, but still the fast food west coast style (thin griddle pressed patties). The bun is probably the worst I've had (worse than McDs). They stamp their logo on it to make it seem better than it is. If you like cheese, they def know how to load it on and melt it completely through the burger. They have a strange system of charging extra toppings. I wish they had more preset standards. \\n\\nThe fries are kind of bland. Very dry. If I'm going to indulge in fried food, I want it greasy or tasty. Parm and herb add-on was pungent tasting. Cajun was passable. Still, don't think there's any value in their fries. Same with onion rings. Large battered type. But the onion is sliced super thin and the batter was just salty oil.\\n\\nThey do offer alcohol here. And they have Clown Shoes on tap! I think there was also Sam Adams and PBR and a dozen or so bottles. There's also wine options.\\n\\nIce cream and shakes are all custard based. Very rich and filling. Takes a long time if you order a concrete since they deep freeze it\\n\\nHaven't tried the hot dogs yet, but I'm eager to see if their kobe dog is legit or not.\\n\\nThere's also a secret menu, but no prices....kinda strange.\\n\\nService is very slow, even with the seemingly dozen workers in the back. The cashiers still need a bit more training or experience. One of the cleanup guys or managers is pretty nice; bused our table for us.\\n\\nOverall, not too impressed. But I'll be returning thanks to a handful of coupon flyers in the mail ($5 off $15 and free ice cream with $5 purchase). I'm pleased that they opened so close to UBurger.

For $24 a piece, this comes with your choice of two meats, one scoop of a cold side dish, and one scoop of a hot side dish. For my meats, I chose the pulled pork and the sausage links. I really enjoyed the pulled pork, especially with some barbecue sauce on it. The sausage links were just OK - a little too dry on the inside. My boyfriend got the brisket and the pork short ribs. He absolutely loved the short ribs and raved about them.\\n\\nFor my cold side, I decided to try the coleslaw. It was an interesting take on coleslaw but I don't think I would order it again. And for my hot side, I ordered the broccoli casserole. It was delicious. And as always the biscuits with the honey butter were the best part of the meal.

I like the fact that they have apps on the menu that none of the other places in Winthrop have, such as fried mushrooms and fried Zucchini. So that is a plus and that is what enticed me to try this new comer to the large Winthrop Italian food scene. The food arrived at the door very warm and within the time frame given. Plus right? But when I opened up the packages the portions seemed a bit skimpy for the prices. The app I got  only covered the bottom of the medium sized box and I had to pull the bread apart to see what was in the sub.

I didn't experience any of the staff surliness described by other reviewers, though it was slow when we went -- which was much appreciated on a Friday night.\\n\\nI tried the Pollo Tinga burrito -- a perfectly spicy chicken simmered in red yumminess until it fell completely apart.  Salsa and sour cream distribution was excellent, which is a make-or-break point for me.  I was offered both rice and cheese, and while I opted for neither, it was nice to be given the choice. In many ways, it seems they took a page from Anna's in terms of their assembly line, so I felt right at home.  In fact, Felipe's scores points for friendliness and accessibility in this area; I've begrudgingly come to accept surliness as an occasional flaw with Anna's (though it's still worth it for me).\\n\\nMy trusty companion ordered a chile verde carnitas burrito, which rose above my typical carnitas complaint of fattiness, but was a little too far on the spicy side for our tastes (understandable) and a tad bit salty (less so).  Still, he was as pleased as I was with his meal.\\n\\nAnd I love, love, LOVE salsa bars -- the only redeeming feature of Picante's in Central, in my picky opinion.  At Felipe's, I was initially disappointed by the lack of jalapenos in the burrito assembly line, but there they were in the salsa bar -- which is almost better than having them inside the burrito because accidentally getting two in one bite can be painful.\\n\\nI have three complaints, the first two minor:\\n\\n1. Why were there no napkins by the utensils and salsa bar?  My burrito was insanely messy -- one napkin wouldn't have cut it for even the sloppiest eater.  I was only given one at the register, and presumably would've had to battle other patrons there for more.  I've already washed my hands once since dinner, and they still smell like burrito.  I think it seeped deep into my fingernails.\\n\\n2. The tortilla was a bit too chewy.  My small teeth (believe it or not, they make eating difficult sometimes) couldn't bite through it and it just stretched until the whole thing fell apart.  I had to go at it with a fork.  My normal-toothed companion had no problems here (in fact, he devoured my discarded tortilla), but it's worth noting that I've never had this issue at my beloved Anna's.\\n\\n3. It got seriously, SERIOUSLY cold in there every time someone opened the door. They should either consider a thick curtain around the door area in the winter or even a little vestibule -- there's room for one. (It didn't help that a rude dude decided it was better to talk on the phone while halfway in the restaurant instead of outside.)  True, no one stays in Felipe's for very long, but even a quick dinner should at least be physically comfortable.\\n\\nOverall, I'm looking forward to going back -- mainly because I want to dig some chips into that salsa bar (though I'm anticipating complaint #4: the salsa containers I saw were way small -- but I'm sure there are bigger behind the counter).  You really can't beat a filling, $6 pre-shopping dinner in Harvard -- especially when you're paying to shop at any of the Harvard stores.

I eat healthy foods and therefore food is not much of an option for me at this place as nearly everything is fried and/or destined to give you a heart attack. The location is relatively inconvenient but what really ruined this experience for me was the terrible service. Our waitress asked us if she could close us out before she left, which I always find to be tasteless. Then, she did not introduce us to a new server and no one came to our table. Eventually I approached the bartender to let her know we wanted to continue to order but that we had no server. It took me a while to wave her down because she and a co-worker were flirting at the end of the bar. When she finally came over she told me she would get us a server and she did but he took our initial order and then he never checked on us again. He and another co-worker just sat at the bar flirting with the aforementioned bartender. We eventually waved down a different waiter and asked him for help and it was clear that he was annoyed but he did serve us. We then suffered a similar battle trying to get the check.

The chairs were comfortable and we were greeted right away. \\n\\nThe hostess sat us and after a couple minutes the waitress came over to explain the restaurant and take drink orders. As it was explained to us the whole menu of entrees was kind of like signature tapas items that we should order 8-10 of for our 4 person group. We ordered 4 things to start and the waitress didn't seem to like that- service definitely suffered after that. The second part to the concept is that they will take forever to bring you the 4-10 menu items you order so they can bring carts of \\"dim sum\\" to your table to up sell you on more small plates. Amazing marketing concept but not sure I like this at a restaurant where prices are already high for small plates. \\n\\nThe first plate that came to us was a dim sum plate we ordered off the cart- it looked like an empanada- but was just a hard piece of fried crust with shrimp inside- it was called shrimp toast. The shrimp inside were great! Tender and full of flavor but the empanada looking part was dry and hard to eat. Second we ordered the ceviche. The flavor on it was absolutely fantastic!! Kind of tasted like a slightly effervescent pineapple broth. Portion wise this was 3 small bites of fish. A little tough if you have more than 3 people. \\n\\nNext we had the hot potato salad with lamb. This was probably the best dish we ordered- it was a fair size - and had great flavor. It was probably enough food where if you ordered an appetizer and dessert you could be satisfied. Definitely a must order. \\n\\nNext appetizer that came  out was the beef tartar- no flavor at all and served with some lavash type crispy bread that was too thick to allow you to taste the flavor of the meat. Quality of meat was great, sauce wasn't great and bread didn't suit the dish. \\n\\nAt this point we really played the waiting game- two of our guests had ordered pasta and both dishes took over an hour to come out... a solid 30 minutes after we had finished the last dishes. The final pasta dish actually took a full hour and 15 to come out. Both pasta dishes were pretty good in the end- good flavor- fair portions. \\n\\nOverall it was a pretty average experience- 2 of our guests were very hungry after eating and the other 2 liked their food- none of us thought the service was friendly or up to par.

They still have his picture hanging on the wall. He would be turning in his grave if he knew what has become of his place. Where do I begin? Let's take this example:\\n\\n- I went on a Sunday evening around 7:30 pm. Ordered 3 takeout dishes. The young woman at the front said it would take 20 mins. It seems she was telling everyone who came after me: 20 mins, 20 mins. It's a lie...expect to wait 40 mins plus.\\n- while I waited, I saw 2 older Caucasian women getting agitated as they were eating there, since one of their dishes hadn't arrived, and they had already finished eating. Young woman at front told them, only a few more mins. The women waited...15 mins go by. The women get up to leave and cancel their order, as they have already finished eating...young woman rushes back into the kitchen, swings the door open leading into the kitchen, and there is a crash of dishes! LOL. This was like the old keystone cops silent movies, but with sound! Young woman comes back and grudgingly gives the old women some money back. Apparently, she had just ran into the cook who was delivering these poor women's food :-)\\n- I wait close to an hour and finally get my takeout food.\\n- But that wasn't the end! I get home, tasted the food and it was the worst Indian food I'd tasted. It seemed burnt...very bland (for Indian food that is crazy)\\n- Bad service, bad food, long wait times!

My wife used to enjoy the fresh hand breaded chicken strips, but they have been replaced with frozen chicken strips.  At our last visit the BACON cheeseburger came with ONE slice of bacon folded and in the middle of the burger.  When I asked to get this corrected I was informed that is the way it is built.  Any decent bacon cheeseburger should have at least two slices of bacon, maybe more for a good pub burger.  My Ahi Tuna sandwich came with maybe a tablespoon of slaw on it and was cooked well.  I believe Ahi is to be seared rare as implied on the menu. and they have discontinued the fantastic spicy honey mustard salad dressing.

They also have very cheap and affordable menu items. I love that there's a lot of windows which lets tons of natural light in, and the fact that the food always looks good on both the posters/signage and when it's being served right in front of you.\\n\\nSadly, the visual appeal of the food does not equal the taste.\\n\\nAround the table, we had the steamed salmon with some kind of dill sauce, steamed vegetables, veggie/potato medallions, ribs, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, garlic bread and the almond cake. The salmon was actually really moist, but it was SO bland. It depends on the sauce for it to be edible. Um hello? Ever heard of seasoning your dishes? A dash of salt and pepper goes a long way. Another thing I knew that was not going to be stellar: steamed vegetables. They could be, but when I saw it I knew it has been sitting on the steam table for over an hour. Again, more blandness happening there. \\n\\nThe veggie/potato medallions looked good but it's also been sitting on the steam table for a long time. I tasted more of the potato than the vegetable; in other words too much potato. The mashed potatoes were also disappointing. It tasted like one of those pre-made, ready to serve, mashed potatoes in a box.  Surprisingly bland as well (considering most packaged mashed potatoes are swimming in sodium). \\n\\nMy brother is a huge ribs fan and he usually thinks ribs in sauce is delicious even if it really isn't. For this however, he thought the ribs were just mediocre. I thought it was tough, not the falling-off-the-bone kind and the sauce tasted like Kraft BBQ sauce. Which it might have been. \\n\\nThe best dish was probably the fried chicken. Well, it was the best among the rest; it wasn't exactly to die for. It was moist and the taste was there, it just wasn't impressive. This is also true for the almond cake: it really tasted like a generic cake (just a little bit of sweetness, barely enough for me) with almonds that added a nice crunch. It wasn't great but it was better than the rest. Oh and the garlic bread was also pretty good.\\n\\nOverall, I wanted to give this place a 1.5/5. But since Yelp doesn't do half points, I'm bumping it up to 2/5 because it's no gourmet food (and I knew that walking in) so I shouldn't expect too much. It's tolerable if you're hungry. But seriously, invest in salt and pepper. It's really going to help.\\n\\nWould I come back? Probably not. Unless someone told me they're paying for my food.

The service, however, was terrific.  The energy, friendliness, and spunk from the staff was great and a welcomed relief, I thought things were going downhill, fast.  The food was, ehhh, ok.  Nothing really stood out, other than the tortillas being fresh and made in-house for every order.  Nothing else as far as the flavors and presentation were really anything to write about, unfortunately.  The only thing that really stands out and was above my expectations was the service.\\nSome suggestions would be an interior overhaul.  The booth seats were cramped and small, I could barely get in and out of my spot, so I'd also suggest upgrading the seating inventory.  Just spruce up the joint a little bit.

They have steadily improved since the soft opening.\\n\\nThey've done a lovely job in converting El Arbol into something that works better as a restaurant.   El Arbol clearly chewed off more than they could handle and their quality suffered  - Olive and June has closed the third floor and made the second story patio apps & small plates only.   In theory, this limits the stress on the kitchen and improves the food quality.   I'd say that it seems to be working.   They have also improved upon the over the top decor and the atmosphere has become much more inviting.   I thought El Arbol felt kinda like the set of a 1960s porn shoot or your creepy uncle's bachelor pad in LA.\\n\\nDuring the soft opening, everything on the menu was so salty that it was barely edible.   Feedback was provided and changes have definitely been made.   On my most recent visit, everything tried was perfectly seasoned.   Pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and sauces were tasty and not overbearing.   The carbonara is the best I've had in Austin.   Small plates are small, but definitely should be tried - especially the farm egg, which is amazing.   I've yet to make it to the entrees portion  of the menu, which never seems to strike me as stuff I would want to order.   Your best bet here is probably to split a variety of pastas and small plates.\\n\\nNice wine list and a variety of specialty cocktails and draft beers.

He would wring it dry into a bucket next to the counter, set down the rag, and with the same gloved hands pick up the materials to make the next burrito. Ewww. I asked him to change his gloves, which he did, but then he made someone else's burrito instead of mine. Of course after that he picked up the rag again, did another wipe and squeeze, and then without changing his gloves, started to make my food.

This place is tucked right into Kendall Square, a short walk from the T or a perfect place to go after some costume shopping at the Garment District. During the fall, their Great Pumpkin beer is definitely the best! You can get beers by the pint, pitcher, or tower! We opted for the tower once when we were there with a large group, and it was enough for about 5 of us to have 2 glasses of beer. Pints are typically around $5-$7 each.\\n\\nAs far as the menu goes, it isn't huge, but I actually find that refreshing in comparison to some bars with 6 pages of food options. I always think the fewer options, the more care they put into each dish, and I think that definitely holds true for Cambridge Brewing Company. I've opted for the burger twice, and the main event is actually the french fries- absolutely delicious! The burgers are always cooked well and are juicy. I've also gone for the fish and chips before- served over little newspaper papers, a very cute touch. Friends of mine have also gone with soup or pizza there, and have never heard a complaint.\\n\\nService is great here- the bartenders and waiters are incredibly friendly and great on making suggestions, especially if you are torn on the beer choices. They also serve a glass of water with the beer- a major bonus point. It can get pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night, but there is always room at the bar to sit down and have a beer while you wait for your table!

The business itself has no communication what so ever amongst staff. And when asked to speak to a manager I was gave the run around around for over 45 mins. Then when I went behind scenes where staff was speaking on our situation the owner tried to confront me because I tried to give corrective criticism on their manager on duty. Which happened to be his 20 yr old son, who had no experience what so ever with customer service.

They did have a couple 50 inch tvs in each corner of the restaurant tuned into a football game.\\n\\nThey brought out chips and salsa.  Average.  About what I had expected.  Salsa was ok, wasn't too spicy at all but lacked a good flavorful punch.  We ordered queso and also a guac dip.  The queso was pretty good and had freshly cut jalape√±os on top.  Best part of the meal.\\n\\nI was actually craving a standard meal where you just pick a number and they bring it to you.  Ah, sadly, no numbers on this menu.  So I opted for two cesina tacos and a side of rice.  When the food came, I just wasn't impressed with the tacos.  Menu made it sound better than it looked.  Very messy to eat and half the toppings were on the side.  I ended up just mixing the topping with my rice.  My niece's kids chicken quesadilla was much better.\\n\\nI ordered their Margarona with my meal.  A big margarita with a smaller corona mixed in.  The margarita was very salty and tasted like a pre mixed drink, which means less alcohol.  Only good part of it was the beer.  I should have just ordered a dang beer.\\n\\nOur service was awesome!

Just an average environment that can be likened to a Winghouse or Denny's type of environment.  Their ventilation is poor though so you will come out from dinner smelling like you spent 12 hours in the kitchen frying meat.  The music is extremely loud l.  You will not be able to enjoy your meal if you are not accustomed to club music and loudness.  It was difficult to carry on a conversation at the table.  The grills at the table did not work.  They had to bring portable grills to many, if not all the tables, to cook the food.\\n\\nThe service -  The service was friendly  but extremely slow and our server kept forgetting to bring drinks we ordered and rice.  It also took a very long time for the food and check.\\n\\nThe food - The meats were seasoned well.  The taste was good and is the only reason this review is 2 stars instead of 1.  While the korean bbq marinade was good on the meats, we were only to try the pork belly, chicken and pork  They ran out of most meats while we were there which was disappointing.  It was also only 8pm.  They provide little kimchi dishes with the bbq that was also okay though I recommend you skip the actual kkmchi dish.  The pickled radish was good.  The udon soup was okay.  \\n\\nOverall verdict:  The korean bbq is tasty but the portable grills, poor ventilation, lack of menu choices due to poor restaurant planning on what I hear is their busiest night and obnoxiously loud music makes it a no go for me but is an option for those who do not mind all of these cons and would like to take advantage of the budget AYCE"},{"name":"Dharma Kitchen","address":"3667 Broadway West","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Have you ever tasted love?

The food was just ok.  Decent, edible... I think preferences of food can be subjective because everyone has different and changing tastes (and taste buds).  Plus I've never been to England, so I don't have anything to compare it to.\\n\\nBut what I WILL review on is the service.  It's Sunday (3/4)  right before 12 noon.  There's a large party of 8, 2 tables of 2, 2 other parties of 4-5 people, and now me & my friend.  Problem: they had 3 people working the whole place.  (The review by Ehlane O. below is probably someone that was there when we were there.  I remember a lady, her husband and a small child, probably Ehlane O.)  Right as we order our food, the waitress tells us there's going to be a wait on the food because they're backed up in the kitchen.  Well, there's only 1 cook, and you've got about 20 adults ordering food.  That to me might be a problem... I mean, this ain't no Waffle House!\\n\\nThe manager walked back and forth seeming clueless half the time, and I observed him apologizing at least 3 times - once to one of the parties of 2, and twice to the large party of 8.  This is not a big, crowded, fast paced chain restaurant... apologizing so many times raised a red flag.\\n\\nThen there's the service specific to us... when someone orders something to be split (and you see 2 people in front of you), wouldn't you assume they want 2 of everything?  Or split the beverage and food to 2?  YEAH.\\nSo why would you come back with 1 cup (for the tea), and one silverware set, and no extra plate when the food comes out?  Split = 2 of everything!  DUH!\\nWe had to ask for the extra cup (for the tea), and never got it.  We had to go to the counter to get it ourselves.  We had to ask for these other things (silverware, plates) and noticed they would make 1 trip...not just for our table, but for all the tables.  Why would you make 1 trip for EVERYTHING?!?!  Efficient restaurant service is about multi-tasking... something these people CLEARLY had no idea how to do.\\n\\nI really want this place to do better, and as you can see from the inconsistent reviews, they have potential.

The drink came and was tasteless,  mostly water and some slushy ice.   She never complains but asked me to taste it, and I agreed it was very much , water with a hint of margarita mix.  The waitress seemed incredulous but took it back.  The replacement was barely any better so she did not drink it.  I asked for water and was given a small cocktail glass of water that was mostly ice and did not get refilled.\\n\\nThe enchiladas were good,  lots of chicken and green sauce.   The rock fish tacos were horrible.  Each of us had 1 as we usually share our meals. The fish chunks in the taco were rubbery, oily, and gave off a strong fish odor.

The goat cheese was soft and could be spread on the french bread very easily.  The garlic was roasted to perfection.  All the flavors complemented with one another very well.  For the entree, I ordered the cuban sandwich and my friend opted for the pulled chicken pasta.  Both pretty good entrees but preferred the cuban sandwich more.  The flavors of the pasta was a bit too bland for me.  For both entrees, the portions were quite huge and I was able to pack half my sandwich to take home.

Seemed like they had something of everything, from Vietnamese pho, to Japanese terriyaki, to thai curry and pad thai noodles and Chinese spring rolls. Don't expect each culture to have an extensive list though. Just a dabble here and there. Also, they give you a ton of rice. Usually the portions are enough to make you full.

On top of that they stack a split biscuit, eggs, sausage (we substituted bacon) and sausage gravy smothering the whole thing.  It was actually quite tasty in spite of the fact that the potatoes were barely warm.  The biscuits were light and flaky, the bacon was great, but another problem was the biscuits were under so many other things that they didn't get soaked with gravy like they are supposed to.

We were seated in the bar area. Pop music was blasting, not so sure this was appropriate for the atmosphere of the restaurant. Don't get me wrong, I' m not  a stuff shirt but who wants to scarf down Southern style grub whilst bopping to Miley Cyrus jams? Anyway, perhaps more troubling was witnessing the chef (Joe Truex) sitting at the bar commingling with two very touchy-feely Buckhead 30 somethings. He was even in his apron. He didn't just come out to say hi, he was sitting at the bar for the entire time we were sitting at our table. He actually looked like he was having more fun than our table who was suffering through pretty average food and loud Sirius Hits 1 music. Perhaps if he was in the kitchen developing some recipes to replace a strange kale salad that was swimming in Ranch dressing and under cooked black eyed peas we would forgive the service issues and dance club atmosphere. Or maybe he could pick a new steak for the menu instead of a cheap skirt  steak \\"frites\\" with chimichurri sauce (is this the South or South Argentina?). The whole menu is underwhelming in its execution and seems like a hodge podge of flavors, cultures and cuisines. The real head scratcher came at the end of the meal, when our server asked if we wanted dessert. When we said no, it seemed like his reaction was as horrifying  as him witnessing us slapping a baby  seal over the head.  He then brought the check for our party of 12 and ran away. He was not too keen on splitting up the check amongst the couples (even though clearly the orders were placed by seat number as the food was delivered properly by food runners). It took us no less than 45 minutes to figure out the bill that he kept reprinting, messing up cards, etc. etc. It was a frustrating way to end our experience at an already pretty mediocre outing to Watershed."},{"name":"Dragon Wok","address":"145 Harvard Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3","text":"This is your run-of-the-mill greasy Chinese with sesame chicken that's really just a doughball of fried goodness in salty goo...in essence, perfection (if this is what you're craving).\\n\\nI rarely get cravings for this kind of food--saltier than is safe for human consumption, greasy as all hell, cheap and quick--but when I do, I know where to go.

Their glazed donut is heavenly, personally my three favorites are cinnamon, jelly and sugar-raised. They also make some of the best coffee-cake muffins anywhere. Moist and dense, they are addictive.\\n\\nThey only make their donuts once (very early) each morning, which means as the day goes on you take the risk of them selling out of your particular favorites. They also offer a daily special where after a certain time you can purchase a half-dozen or a dozen donuts for half-price. On many occasion I have dropped in to pick up a dozen mid-afternoon for ~$3!\\n\\nDon't listen to the negative reviews about the staff, they work at an establishment that (especially in the morning) is typically bustling with customers. Since most of the customers are regulars (or at least repeat customers), they expect that you know what you want. They are cordial, but won't break into a conversation because, to be honest, most of the time they're too busy. They always have a smile and will do what they can to accommodate you.\\n\\nThis shop is tucked away on a local road, far from the nearest highway. They don't have a website.

Stood at the wait station for 10 minutes or so and was totally ignored despite many empty tables.  Eventually a waitperson approached and I asked for a table for two. She said decisively \\"I'm going to put you there\\", gesturing to a table just inside the entrance which would leave us shivering every time the door opened. When I protested, she put down the menus and walked away, as if to say \\"sit where I put you or leave.\\"  We left. No way to treat a customer. After dozens of visits to this neighborhood place, today's experience was enough to keep me away for a long while - if not for good."},{"name":"Josie's Pizza & Wings","address":"1225 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I used to really love this place but they have gotten way out of hand with their prices.

It comes to $1.81 and tastes like actual coffee, unlike the brown sugar abomination that spews from Dunks. Add a bit of cream and go. No, it's not sweet and they don't have liquid sweetener out, but we should probably all cut back on our sugar anyway, right?

The server was very friendly and helpful.  She even let us taste their seasonal beer which was delicious.  We ordered an artichoke dip as an appetizer.  It came with garlic bread and veggies which we thought was interesting.  But the artichoke dip tasted like nothing. I mean literally you could taste a stronger taste from the celery than the artichoke dip when dipping the celery.  We ate as much as we could-which was actually quite a bit we sat and waited for a good 15 minutes between FINISHING eating the artichoke dip.  Probably about a half hour total was spent from when we got our appetizer and our main courses.   The bartender was nice the whole time, checking on us, apologizing,etc.  We finally got our food and she apologized again.  The only odd thing was that she offered us waters instead of another round of drinks- we were not sure if we weren't allowed to order more or what (we had only had 1 drink each so far).  I was going to ask for another drink but then my friend made a weird noise and had confusion all over her face.  She had swallowed a hair.  Then after looking at her food more we discovered ANOTHER hair EMBEDDED into her meal which we physically pulled out of a sea of sauce and noodles (lasagna).  The waitress was apologetic and the manager took it off of the bill but we could not really eat another one and I had the mac n cheese which I also found to be bland.  So, we waited for our check and it was promptly given to us.  We were a little disapointed that the manager did not even come over to apologize or do what a manager SHOULD be doing- especially in a corporate restaurant.  If this had ever happened in any corporate restaurant I ever worked at, the manager would have been on it immediately and honestly would have taken off more than just the one person's meal because that is gross- everyone's food does come from the same kitchen after all, how am I to know there isn't hair in my noodles, too?.

We arrived about fifteen minutes ahead of our reservation time and headed for the bar.  Man, that bar sucks.  It's not the fault of the proprietor or the employees.  No, the blame lies with the patrons who alternate between looks of horror and casting optical daggers at anyone who encroaches on their personal space to interact with the barkeep.  If you don't want someone reaching past you to collect his Mount Gay and tonic, you shouldn't sit at the bar.\\n\\nBetween that crowd and a crew of maximum-effort cougars threatening my short-term chastity, it was decided that relocating -- for the duration of our pre-seating experience -- to the cozy chairs wrapped around the fireplace.

Four bottle blonds perpetuating the ugly stereotype were loudly discussing their recent bouts of misbehavior.  That bit of background bustling and sultry stares from a raven-haired diner across the room disrupted my attempts to focus on my pals and the food.\\n\\nStill, I can tell you that the service was quite decent.  The food was hit-and-miss.  While the appetizer (an artichoke dip) looked and tasted like it was lifted from a mediocre chain (think TGI Fridays), the scallops entree was quite good and the jalapeno cornbread was out-of-this-world.  An after-dinner drink (some coffee concoction) was god-awful and short on the liquor.\\n\\nI'd take issue with the suggestion that Stephanie's makes a good 'date' location.  Tables are close together and the space is sprawling.  Not at all an intimate environment.  Its Newbury Street makes i t more of a see-and-be-seen location.  How can I invest myself in one little lady when I have to posture for all the beautiful babies passing by the window?\\n\\nLastly, while it did not factor into my generous three-star rating, the food was just a little less appetizing when considering that the owner (Stephanie, of course) is the wife of local celebrity ambulance-chaser Jim Sokolove.

As a cafe, it does as advertised; they will give you coffee in exchange for money.\\n\\nWhat I'm reviewing Diesel Cafe for is its capacity as a cafeworking space. Let me explain.\\n\\nEvery time I come to Cambridge, I end up going wherever I can find wifi to spend a day working remotely. This usually means going to Atomic Bean on Massachusetts Avenue between Central and Harvard, because every other place is either too small, too packed, or too wifi-less. While Atomic Bean is great (it's a huge space that never gets too full and they let me sit there for hours using their internet connection for free), there are a few drawbacks. One is that their coffee and food are very decent, but nothing special. They'll get you through the day, but they're not very exciting. Another is that if you sit there long enough, you'll realize they're usually playing some kind of Pandora station of 90s rock, which can get very boring (especially given that the quiet environment amplifies the music).\\n\\nThe other day I was trying to find somewhere new to check out, and I remembered Diesel Cafe in Davis Square. A lot of the reviews for it complain about its paid wifi, but if you only think of it as less of a cafe and more of a coworking space, it's a steal. You can get a monthly (monthly!) wifi connection for $14. That's a lot cheaper than the more average $30 per *day* that coworking spaces charge. And the wifi is fast and almost never drops (I think they've recently upgraded their connection). This is untrue of other cafes, notably where the wifi is free.\\n\\nSo why is Diesel Cafe a more attractive option than other cafes? For a start, it has many different kinds of seating. You can sit in a booth! You can turn the countertops near the back wall into standing desks! You can be up against a wall or at a table for two. And lots of that seating that's up against the walls have numerous outlets, an obvious plus for spending the day here.\\n\\nOther advantages? The coffee and food are both above average. I've enjoyed their Vietnamese coffees, lattes, even teas. And for lunch they make some really great sandwiches (yesterday was the Vista on a baguette (sticky sesame tofu, spicy slaw, avocado, cucumber, greens) and today was the Little Piston (Fiore Di Nonno's fresh mozzarella, pesto, onion, tomato, & greens), both excellent). They tend to get slammed at lunch time, because it's lunch time, but they're good at what they do.\\n\\nThe downside downside I'll admit is that it's usually pretty loud in the building, being one large space, and as such is a pretty horrible place to take calls or be on Skype meetings for meetings. It's more of a come-work-with-your-head-down kind of place. Or at least, come-work-with-your-head-down-if-you-want-to-work-with-the-din-of-others-around-you.

I asked the counter lady, \\"What is a Chubby Decker?\\"  In respond, she merely pointed to a huge picture on the wall of a burger that resembled a big mac.  I ordered the Chubby Deck with tatter tots instead of fries.  They don't give you much in tatter tots.  The burger was a good size though.  It reminded me of what a Big Mac looked like when I was a kid about 20 years ago.  The McDonald's Big Mac is actually way more tastier than the chubby decker even if it is half the size of what it used to be.

We got there at 7 on Saturday night and it was packed, but we agreed to the 1-1.15hr wait and got stools and drinks. Everything was just fine until . . . after about an hour they gave us the worst table in the place. It was right in front of the door and so every time somebody walked in there was a gust of cold winter air on my back. Our waitress also informed us that they were out of pulled pork, which is what we came to try, so we were were very disappointed. I strongly recommend they remove that table as it's unfair to expect people to sit with winter gusts on their back. We decided to forfeit our table and wait for the next available one. 10 minutes later the host motioned for us to come over and we got up in delight. When we got to the table, they told us \\"false alarm!\\" they need the communal table for a party of 7. So we went back to our stools to wait more. We waited about 20-30 more mins and finally we were sat at a communal table. We were starving at that point and knew exactly what we wanted to order since we had over 1.5hrs to peruse the menu. The waitress came to our table 2 times to serve our neighbors and didn't say anything to us. A few mins later a group was sat next to us. The waitress came back and we were eager to place our order. She poured us water and then greeted the party that was sat after us and started to take their orders. I was in shock and called the manager as soon as he walked by. My patience was really being tested! It was really feeling like deliberate neglect at this point. So he took our orders and I was just dying to get one of those mouthwatering biscuits to start with. It was utter torture, almost humiliating, to watch the people who sat after us get served biscuits and entrees before we got anything! The only plus to waiting so long, was that that they finished smoking another batch of pulled pork by the time we ordered (sarcasm).  My husband and I were furious watching these people eat their entrees next to us when we had got there first. We waited 10 more mins and were about to walk out when finally our entrees arrived. YET still NO biscuits. The biscuits arrived a few mins AFTER we got our entrees, which we were inhaling due to starvation.

I love the Gyro from the original Big Fat Greek Pizza and love the anticipation I get when I order it and open up the box after I bring it home. My anticipation this time had changed since finding out that the gyro is not overstuffed and packed like previous, the sauce on the gyro is not the same, the fries which were amazing, are different,  it is italian dressing instead of greek dressing with the salad, and it costs more, for less! The only Gyro I ever order in Boston was from Big Fat Greek, probably will have to find another place since this new place, Big Bites Pizza has moved in. So disappointing, Big fat Greek had such good gyros that I never had to order anything else, the friendly lady behind the counter was always their and always answered the phone. \\n\\nI also give thumbs down to any place that has pizza sitting on the counter in a spinning heat lamp container.

Its menu offers a variety of both Vietnamese and Chinese dishes, including vermicelli, pho, some more Americanized Chinese offerings (like General Tso's), and some more traditional/harder to find Vietnamese \\"specialties\\" like shaken beef.  Prices range from about $5-$8.  I tried the shaken beef, and was impressed with how quickly I got my food - I'm pretty sure it was less than five minutes.  I'd say it was a 3-1/2 star meal - the beef was tender, the lemon salt they served with it was good, and they gave me a whole lot of it - probably enough for most people to share.  But the rice was covered with sauce and was pretty mushy, and I'm kind of a rice purist - I don't like it drenched in stuff and prefer it to stay fairly plain as a foil for the flavors of the dish itself.  The mushiness of it turned me off, too; I didn't eat much it, which is saying a lot since I loves me my rice.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very casual - counter service only.\\n\\nI might go back again if I were in the neighborhood, but for fast Asian food, I personally like Pei Wei better - their food tastes fresher and has a little more zing to it for basically the same price.

This quaint and warm atmosphere so welcoming as soon as you open the door. I've been invited to taste several things on the new menu. I am seated at a high top table adorned with wine glasses and plates. There are several patrons here that look as if they could be regulars. I scanned the room and see a wide variety of wines that are chilled as well as stored to the rear of the restaurant. We soon are introduced to executive chef Patrick Good and the Sous chef Will Hunt. Rob Van Leer will present us with the first bottle of sparkling wine. It will be a Brut. Filled with Crispy fruity notes and endless bubbles. Mr Van Leer will give us the history behind the wine from birth to table. Soon items arrive from the kitchen for us to enjoy with the Brut &Fried green beans . I immediately indulge in the fried green beans. Lightly breaded to Perfection with the hint of spicy pepper taste that will soon compliment the sparkling wine. A mushroom flatbread is now here. Fontina and Parmigiano-Reggiano will cover the wild mushrooms like a blanket of flavor with the Truffle creme fraiche to assist and all of its Buttery flavor. A pairing of a 2012 Chardonnay will be poured for tasting. It is now time for salads. A great summer salad is always a crowd-pleaser. This salad filled with mixed greens, chilled corn, heirloom tomatoes, field peas, top with a buttermilk dressing. So clean and fresh as if all of the ingredients were picked straight from the garden that day. A true farm-to-table kind of feel. The heirloom tomato burrata salad would create an Italian feel with the rich and creamy burrata added to the Sweet heirloom tomatoes top with balsamic pearls. A knife and fork egg sandwich has arrived. Why is it called knife and fork you asked? Well the size of the sandwich is enormous. A triple-decker sandwich layered with over medium eggs, pimento cheese, tomato jam, Bibb lettuce, and red onion. Ratatouille decided to join in the festivities with the silky yet buttery pappardelle pasta, ricotta cheese, and arugula pesto. Now it's time to be spoiled by for decadent desserts. Lavender creme brulee, dark chocolate pot de creme, key lime pie with marscapone whipped cheese, and a coconut Graham crust. And last but surely not least, tres leches cake with strawberries. Overall this evening was filled with laughter amongst friends old and new amazing food paired to Perfection with amazing wines. Vino venue is a place for all to experience. If you consider yourself a wine connoisseur like myself, then I would highly recommend taking a trip to Dunwoody and including some family and friends on this adventure. Indulge in a wine class or take part in becoming a member of the wine club. Schedule a cooking class with Chef Melissa Hass and meet the staff.

The Silence of Lamb burger...not so much. The meat was very dry - even though the centre of the meat was still pink, which is how I like burgers, it was still chewy and dry. The \\"dill'd yogurt\\" was a little overpowering on the burger, but interesting. If there was in fact olive tapenade on my burger as the menu claims, I tasted no hint of it at all.\\n\\nMy husband liked the yam fries and said the burger was \\"OK, but too much bun and not enough meat.\\" He also didn't like the iceberg lettuce as he feels it's mostly crunchy water and generally used by fast food chains and not restaurants.\\n\\nThe beer selection is limited - but from what the menu says, that is temporary.

This is one of the trendier sushi restaurants in town offering the more urban, modern Japanese dining experience. \\n\\nThe two dining areas have slightly different atmospheres. One is smaller and more intimate, with a narrow booth along the wall and low tables- perfect for couples or small groups.  The main dining room, where the cool sushi bar is located, is spacious and noisy- much better for larger groups or couples who enjoy the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant, which Haiku has been from the day it opened. \\n\\nI have found the service to be somewhat slow, but for some reason, I never minded it here. I suppose it's because there's a lot to keep you distracted... the beautiful people coming and going, black-clad servers hard at work, sushi chefs creating their edible art, and reading the handwritten haikus (Japanese poems) hanging on the walls. I really dig the vibe.\\n\\nAs for the food, it's pretty good. But, I definitely go to Haiku for the atmosphere. The energy and ambiance is much more memorable than anything I've eaten here. Being situated at the northern end of the Short North, Haiku can become extremely packed on weekends, especially during Gallery Hop nights. \\n\\nThis is also one of those cases where its street front patio overlooking High Street, is a good thing. I don't normally like to sit outside right on the main drag, but the large patio is enclosed with lattice and plants.

For vegetarians and vegans, I strongly recommend going for lunch/dinner over breakfast. There are many, many more options for dinner... so many that I had trouble choosing. My husband got the Citrus crunch salad with tofu. His salad was so huge and beautiful, I was a little jealous. He said it was really good. It had so many toppings, a lot of different textures. I got the Thai tofu burrito, which came with chips and extra dipping sauce. My burrito was delicious. The tofu was perfectly cooked... crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The peanut sauce was delicious and I loved the crunch of the carrots, green onions, and ginger in the burrito. As before, the restaurant was clean and inviting and the staff wonderful. I really appreciate that the restaurant owner reached out to me and invited me back after I had written the 3-star review before.

Yeah, I can appreciate truly great ribs - but if I buy a rack of Lloyd's in the supermarket and throw it in the oven, it makes me happy.  Put ribs in front of me in any middling chain restaurant and there will not be a spot of meat anywhere on the bones.  So, when I say barbecued ribs on the menu at Franks - I thought it was a sure thing.  The ribs were tough, over cooked - way too chewy with some lots of dried crusty stuff on top of the gray unhappy looking meat nearer the bone.   The sauce was a tad too close to ketchup.  Yuck!\\n \\nStill, I give Frank 3 stars - because if you know what to order, you can't go wrong.

I've had a few salads here and they were very good. The sandwiches also look very tempting. I highly recommend the chouquettes, very addictive and just the right size to snack on!  The chocolate croissants are good as well, but my favorite is an croissant aux amandes! They are absolutely delicious! The strawberry millefeuille is my favorite cake. I also adore the fruit tarts with berries. Of course it's seasonal, and unfortunately I don't enjoy the grapefruit tart as much. \\n\\nThe staff is nice, wait is long, and it's always super hot inside."},{"name":"Thai House Restaurant","address":"116 Esplanade W","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"It's absolutely delicious and you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. It's a great place to catch up with friends due to hot food and full bar. I'm not really into Thai appies so I usually go straight into ordering the mains. Try the chicken matsaman, you won't know how you've lived without it. And I can't leave without having the sum Tum malagor salad: which is Green papaya strips seasoned with fresh lime juice, nam-pla & Thai spices; killer!!! Other favourites are the pad nam prig paow: saut√©ed squid with ginger and Thai chili paste and the most wonderful thin julienned vegetables ; and skip the pad Thai and get the gwoi teaw pad kee mao with beef: the noodle is a bit thicker and there is a mega flavour factor ; and finally the duck red curry: it speaks for itself. Pair off the meal with a few of their funky hand made cocktails and a fried banana dessert and you'll be very pleased with yourself."},{"name":"The Haven","address":"2 Perkins St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4.5","text":"Uh.

The ambience is 1/2 charming and 1/2 in need of \\"Restaurant Impossible.\\"  There is definitely something to be said for keeping neighborhood flair, and nothing was dirty, but updating some little things like linen, rugs, and plants would make a big difference.\\n\\nI was pretty well settled on giving this place 1 or possibly 2 stars until I received the entr√©e.  My friend was hosting a birthday party on the Lounge Side.  She had called ahead to alert the staff, but because she could not guarantee a certain number of guests (invited 50, expected roughly 30), she could not have a confirmed seating reservation.  That said, she didn't change her plans.  She just agreed to arrive early and group some tall tables together.  The point is that the Lounge still only had one server.  :-(  I also get the sense that this is a 4:30 p.m. dinner rush place.  When we ordered at 7:30 p.m., it was almost overwhelming to the kitchen.  We didn't receive any of the famed popovers.  :-(  In fact, we only received two menus to pass among a group that grew to about 30.  I came from work, and I was hungry.  An hour-and-a-half later, I received dinner - after some crackers and \\"bean dip\\" that consisted of whole kidney beans, mayo, and relish - weird.\\n\\nThe salad was a bit lackluster - even for just a small side salad, but oh my God, the filet, Delmonico potatoes, and mixed vegetables were really really really delicious.  The steak was perfectly cooked.  The potatoes had so much flavor.  Even the mixed vegetables had great flavor - butter, spices, cooked but not mushy - definitely not just shaken out of the bag.\\n\\nThe kitchen is strong at this place.  The products are very fresh.  The ambience could even be incredibly charming with some freshening.  It just needs some work.  It would make me sad if this place dies the death of Hilltop."},{"name":"Toji Korean Grill House","address":"4615 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Very few vegetarian dishes to choose from.

However, I didn't check the reviews before my family and I got there. They higher rated reviews were mainly for delivery service. Oops! Nonetheless, the good was absolutely delectable, but the service was adequate.\\nThere was no one in the restaurant when We arrived, and the girl serving seemed annoyed that We showed up. What I assume was the owners were pleasant people, and made sure We were doing well. I really liked that they let us have our conversation and didn't mind that We stayed a bit longer after our check. \\nThey even had the FIFA world soccer game on their massive flat screen.

Service pretty good...food, not so much.Started with the bruchetta caprese. Flavors were great but portion size was VERY small. For lunch ordered the chicken bryan pizza and \\"day special\\" vegetable side of green beans with caramelized onion. Both were so butter/oily, heavy and gross (the green beans were bland and overcooked as well). Look, I am a southern girl so a little butter does not alarm me. But when I soak a whole napkin trying to sop it off the pizza and the still can turn the pizza slice to the side and watch the fat drip off. Um, yikes and no thank you. There are just way to many other fantastic italian places in this area for me to ever go back, so I think I'm out when it comes to Carraba's Italian Grill."},{"name":"Saigon Cafe","address":"1935 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Saigon Cafe Buckhead is the second of the eight Saigon Cafe locations in metro Atlanta to be located inside the perimeter.  So far, I've been to this location and the Duluth and Decatur locations and I think this chain serves pretty decent Vietnamese food.  The Buckhead location is relatively new, clean, spacious, and naturally well-lit.  There's a small covered patio outside and plenty of free parking in a hidden parking lot behind the shopping center.\\n\\nSaigon Cafe's menus are nicely done.  As I always do at Vietnamese restaurants, particularly pho restaurants, I ordered a large bowl of their pho dac biet (special combination pho).  The pho is priced at $7.50 for a medium bowl and $8.50 for a large.  These prices are slightly higher than the pho noodle shops on Buford Highway and in Duluth, but location most likely drives that.\\n\\nI'm happy to report that despite the neighborhood, Saigon Cafe hasn't held anything back from their pho dac biet.  It contains everything: rare steak, well-done flank and brisket, fatty brisket, beef tendon and tripe, and a few meatballs too.  The broth is sufficiently tasty and fragrant and the noodles are appetizing.  A good, satisfying bowl of pho.\\n\\nSaigon Cafe's large bowl could pass as an extra large at some restaurants.  I wouldn't order a large unless you're especially hungry.  The sides (bean sprouts, culantro, basil, jalapenos, and lime) are fresh and service is excellent.  The restaurant also serves Thai food and bubble tea, all of which are welcome additions to the area."},{"name":"Green Lady Cafe","address":"","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Well, I'm impressed!\\n\\nThe food is really tasty, nicely presented, and different. Very different. And I don't just mean because it's raw. It's different from the raw food Portland has seen before. It has a southern flare (Mississippi and Tennessee -- lots of doubles in those two) but it's more than that. It's creative! The rosemary, pomegranate, chard smoothie was addictively delicious and just so... well, different!\\n\\nThe rest of the food I had was also satisfyingly tasty, and filling, and yes, different!\\n\\nYet all of it is quite healthy and sinfully sinless... which is again, different.\\n\\nHope to go back soon to try more and see if I can bump this up a star for better service when they aren't quite as busy (they are all very nice) but this is a promising place and perhaps Portland's next star."},{"name":"Sinju Japanese Restaurant","address":"7339 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"Been here a couple times for happy hour.

Even with the largw multiple parties we still had great service and great food. The manager even came to our table to make sure we were happy. She was just as down to earth and kind as you would want someone to be. It takes some strong leadership to run a place like that for as busy as it was.

However; they fell victim to a city not being gentrified but a city that rather has generations of families who resided here in malden, moving away for greener pastures ? Yes Malden has become a huge center for Asian cuisine and it appears the Patio just does not fit the mold anymore. Perhaps the new owners will have something other than Asian food to offer ? Let's hope so, in a city that is going backwards with closing places early, rolling back liquor licenses and concentrating on things that well don't make much sense there are other cities like Melrose that are encouraging more and more to open and expanding their liquor licenses and adding more and more..... Malden will never be Somerville, you can add bike paths, but until places like Red Bones etc.. move in...oh wait a minute they tried !!!! it will never be anything more than what it is....."},{"name":"Pan Roma Pizzeria & Grill","address":"1026 A Commonwealth","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Lydia is the worst employee I have ever experienced in my life.

Although the restaurant called to confirm, they seemed to have lost our reservation before we got there and we had to stand for 5 minutes or so in a half-full restaurant while they figured it out. Then they put the five of us at a booth for 4 with a chair pulled up to one end. This, with many empty tables. \\n\\nWe shared scallop schnitzels for an appetizer: a single sea scallop sliced and fried, served on an odd mixture that tasted like hard boiled egg whites and pickle relish. The quail egg on top was cute, but we paid $28 for two unremarkable scallops. Three of us ordered the special: a sort of lobster ravioli. It was maybe a notch above what you might buy in the freezer section of Publix, served underdone-- on the chewy side of al dente-- and lukewarm, with about two teaspoons of sauce. The other two dishes were better: lamb ragout not bad, salmon quite good. Not a good showing for the price.
