I think I waited another 5-10 minutes before I stood up to leave and, like magic, our food was plated and in our server's hand.\\n\\nQuite possibly my taste buds were tainted with hangriness at having to wait 40 minutes to be served raw food. How it could possibly take so long to make a couple rolls and a salad using raw ingredients is baffling to me. At that point I was expecting some culinary masterpiece or eye popping visual arrangement. What arrived was just sushi. Decent but unimpressive sushi. \\n\\nI had the King Peter roll and uni (Amura's uni is much better, though also much more pricey). My friend had the ahi tuna salad and Kanisu roll, which she said were good but the salad was over dressed which made the bottom too salty and inedible.

I would say the lunch menu is meant to be a light lunch fare, very simple in flavor profile. \\n\\nThe place was packed with students, couples of all ages, family, you name it. Although  there be ample of seating, people tend to stay for long period of time so seating is hard to come by. Students would sit and study for hours at time. \\n\\nThere are plenty of tables for groups of two and four. There is also traditional seating where you can sit on the floor as well. There is one table at the back that can accommodate I want to say a group of 10.

And yeah, it has a lot going for it.   The space itself is nice.  They do some interesting things with their lights and the bead curtains on the windows.  Service is also good.  The host and girls bringing around refills of chai (free chai refills! Yay!) were great.   I also liked that the rice served with the meal had some carrots and peas thrown in, a little touch that gives some flavor, color, and texture that I always appreciate.  The main dish, though, left something to be desired. \\n\\nThis visit, I decided to give a try to their take on Kashmiri kofta, and also ordered some kashmiri kulcha with it. The latter was great - crispy-soft Indian bread stuffed with sweet and flavorful raisins, nuts, and coconut... you can't go wrong with that.  And it's filling enough, it could have been a meal in and of itself if paired with some soup.  The Kofta dish though was....well....  rather bland.  When I thought about it later, I honestly don't recall ever being asked how spicy I wanted the dish, which might be the cause.  I'm no leather tongue, but I do like my Indian food at a \\"medium\\" spice level... enough that there is a bit of a kick but without overpowering the more subtle flavors. ....this.... was decidedly a low mild.   The result is a flavor more akin to a sweet gravy.  It wasn't bad, but not particularly memorable either...a bit disappointing overall.  The kofta itself was also a bit different than what I am used to, with a texture more akin to cream cheese than the chewier tofu-like kofta I have had before.  If you like that creamy, stickness, definitely give it a try.  I think I might go with a meat dish next time, though.\\n\\nPrices are on par with other Indian places in the area, and the menu is pretty extensive, offering a wide range that includes all the usual favorites.  They also have a really great sounding kid's menu featuring kid-sized samplers of Indian favorites, making me wish I could pass for the under 10 set. ...No wonder there were a number of kids in the place the night I went.   \\n\\nAnyway, I do hope to come back at some point, perhaps for a lunch buffet, or to try one of the meat dishes. ....but I definitely will want to make clear what level of spice I am seeking."},{"name":"Pizza Caboose","address":"11670 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"Seriously, this is one of my favorite pizza places.

In its place is something new, something different, but something similar.  LA BBQ has proven that with a Mueller on your team, delicious smoked meat is sure to be near. \\n\\nLets skip the background and any history on JMuellerBBQ, which was and is one of the top three spots in the state.  The new LA BBQ is here, and sister LeAnn (sister John of JMuellerBBQ, Wayne of LouieMueller, and daughter to Louie Mueller himself) is following in her talented fathers footsteps in being associated with great BBQ.  Honestly LeAnn, I understand how you got the name LA BBQ, but I don't like it.  The name alone will scare some away that fear a California influence on their traditional Texas favorites, even if the association is not deserved.  In the end however, you could call the place \\"Worst BBQ\\", and I would go to it if the food was good.  The food is great, so I can forgive the name. \\n\\nSo what is so great about the food?  The easy answer is the sausage, which is some of the best I have ever had.  Making your own sausage is not the typical route for BBQ, but new pit master John  Lewis created a special blend of meat, spices, smoke, and grease that lead to what may be the best sausage I have tasted.  \\n\\nJohn Lewis, of the competition circuit and Franklin BBQ fame, is doing justice of the other meats.  I tried both some fatty and lean brisket, and both where cooked perfect with deep smokey taste and salt and pepper rub.  The fat melted as it should and the bark had just enough bite and give to make it a complicated array of taste and textures. The beef rib was another fine example of what good meat should look and taste like.  I felt the pork rib could have used some work.  The rub on it was a bit to much liquid for me, and the meat was missing the light sweetness of good pork and didn't capture the smoke as well as the beef had.  Turkey was an after thought, as it was nicely cooked, but sat drying out on my plate while I focused on the better choices.  Someone who was dragged along by a true carnivore but prefers not to indulge in to much red meat will be pleased with the turkey and glad it is offered. \\n\\nOverall, the place is different from what was here before, but fantastic in its own right.  It is easy to claim this as one of the best in Austin, and in time I would bet that the ribs will come along to catapult it among the best in the State.  The sausage is already the best.  The brisket combines what I like about Franklin's with what I loved about JMuellerBBQ to earn it's spot.  While the ribs may be a bit away, they are all worth a try.  Someone mentioned the prices went up, when I was there the first day everything was $14 a pound, making it slightly less expensive... perhaps they have changed since then.  I will upload my photos, including the one of the menu for guidance. \\n\\nBest of all, it appears the tradition of free beer in line and live music will continue on."},{"name":"The Boot & Sombrero","address":"4866 Delta Street","city":"Delta","stars":"3","text":"I went a few years back during the car show and was nonplussed, but returned recently because I was craving some Mexican food... and I'm glad I did!\\n\\nOn a summer's day, mid-week, the patio is a great place to be; quiet, calm, slow, and generally nice.

My wife and I had heard of Salty Sow, but neither of us expected the explosion of delight on our tastebuds that we received on this, our first visit!\\n\\nFirstly, we love the East side homey, neighborhood feel. I think our server lit up a bit when he learned it was our first time visiting...must be a lot of regulars. Well I know we'll be back. As busy as Salty Sow was on a Saturday evening in happy hour, we received excellent service!\\n\\nAs for the food and drink, I don't think it would be appropriate to break down everything we ate and drank but,\\n\\n- the profound strength of flavor -\\n\\nis one thing carries from dish to dish.\\nFor example, the butterscotch with salted caramel was a punch, am onslaught of punches, of flavor on my tongue...it's a day later that I'm writing this and my mouth is watering at the thought of it!\\n\\nSome other highlights are: \\n-the selection of textures (this hold true for the food and drink alike),\\n-richness of the dishes (example: the duck fat fries are rich!),\\n-the quality of the ingredients,\\n-and they like like to do things with eggs! And of course pig too. \\n\\nMy main dish was the roasted Berkshire pork shoulder. Flavors, spot on! But the texture of the meat...that I could not handle so well. The meaty part was pretty tough, and there was a lot, A LOT, of fat. I am not sure if I should assume that's how it's supposed to be or that my palate simply isn't dignified enough. But that's one dish I will not repeat. (And really the only reason I don't rate this 5 stars) Still, the burnt edges of fat was some of the best tastes to grace my tongue, especially when taken together with some of each of the dish's ingredients.\\n\\nMy wife got the slow cooker beef shoulder. It was, in a sense, the most mild dish we had, in terms of punch of flavor; but it was cooked perfectly - meat was not dry, carrots were not mush - it was quite simply Home. \\n\\nWe particularly enjoyed the drinks. We will be back to try them all over time. The Maple glazed Old Fashioned I expected to be too sweet, but to my delight it was not! \\n\\nThere's much more to this place, but again, I don't want my feeble words to try to sum it up.

That weekly hankering for a burrito is completely understandable but if I were you, I would skip Chipotle and go to Moe's or an authentic burrito place instead. Let me tell you why. The \\"cilantro\\" rice tastes like water and the beans are about as flavorful as their recycled napkins. The meat options are good but horribly salty (check the nutrition facts). The only way you can add any flavor to your burrito/bowl is to add sour cream or salsa. The medium salsa is honestly the best thing they have in that restaurant. The corn salsa is pretty good but I really love the spicy additions. The fajita veggies are pretty good too. Guac is an outrageous $2 extra. To me that is absolutely ridiculous and downright offensive. I already think that Chipotle is overpriced but the guac charge really pushes my boundaries for what I consider to be fair pricing. You're paying upwards of $10 (if you include that guac) for some bland, overhyped food and intense gastrointestinal discomfort. Chipotle is not worth the hype if you've ever had the pleasure of tasting the real authentic thing.

Typical barroom with plethora of flat screen TVs. Large lacquered wood tables with hard staight-backed wood chairs or wood benches. \\n\\nToday, being Tucker's Spring Chili Cook-Off day, Local7 was hoppin'! Every table was full and the staff was runnin' ragged. \\n\\nDue to the big day, wait time for a table at 9PM on a Saturday night was longer than desired, running at roughly 5-10 min, with another 10min wait after seated just to place a drink order, 20 minute wait to place food order and longer to finally get the food. Once delivered say so long to the wait staff, 'cause never saw them again until after the meal was finished and again sitting for 10 min waiting on the check. No drink refills the whole meal and little interaction with the staff other than placing and delivering the food. \\n\\nHeard other tables around us complain about no service, so I guess Local7 was short staffed. (All the staff must have been \\"partying\\" from the Cook-Off). Witnessed couples walk in, wait to be acknowledged by the staff just to get a table, after being ignored for 5min, turn around and leave. \\n\\nFor the food, it is your typical bar food. The corn chowder was hot and spicy, with chunks of potato in a pool of corn with bacon floating in top.  The Ruben sandwich was thick and fresh with tons of Tater Tots! Get a side of spicy \\"ranch\\" dressing for dipping, which is much better than the ketchup. The fried artichokes were unique but the batter is the same batter one gets with fried chicken strips. Fresh squeezed lemon juice saved them and boosted their flavor tremendously!\\n\\nMostly a place for the local guys to hang. Not really comfortable, and the food was simply ok, not great.

So, please take this review with a grain of salt, but I like to think of myself as a bit of a pizza snob.  I've tried many \\"best pizza\\" places in many cities, and I have to admit my choice for pizza depends on my mood at the time.   I love a quick slice after going to the clubs in manhattan,  but when it comes to really good pizza I like to be a little more selective. \\n\\nThere was recently a book written by this man who traveled all over the U.S. looking for the best pizza.  Surprisingly, he chose this one place in Phoenix, AZ.  Yes, Phoenix.  I'm sure there are lots of Italians there.  Second place went to, Pepe's pizza in New Haven.  Of course this is only one man's opinion, but I have to concur with him wholeheartedly.  \\n\\nNow, having lived in Boston for the past 6 years, I've had some good pizza, but nothing that really made me feel, \\"hmmm...this is really good pizza.\\"  Well, my first bite of Sorrento's pizza sparked this reaction.  If you like the deep dish, sicilian, or thin crust, this might not be to your liking, but the crust was amazing as mentioned by someone earlier.  Fluffy crust that was delicious...eventhough I'm not the type to eat the crusts.  The pizza itself had the right amount of sauce, fresh toppings, and cheese blend that was different from the typical shredded mozarella you get from most places.  It was light and It had just the right mix of everything without tasting overpowering with any one particular ingredient.   I'm probably not doing it justice.  Just give it a try.  Although it's a completely different style from Pepe's, this place will definitely satisfy my good pizza craving.   I hope you have the same reaction.

The salsa was just sad, anything taken at random off a grocery shelf would be better. The fried green tomatoes were cut way too thick, had a heavy, thick, cloddish breading and was served with a really blah ranch dressing.  The potato skins were mediocre, absolutely nothing to make them stand out. The chicken wings with the spicy sauce were far over-cooked and the sauce tasted strange and was really incredibly hot...and I love hot food. \\n\\nOn the positive side, the smoked turkey is darn good as is most of the BBQ items. The fries are really good as well. \\n\\nThe grounds are a real draw, with a huge tree-covered outdoor play area with super kids' play-scapes. This they really aced.

The place was nearly empty with only 4 other customers during \\"Happy Hour\\" .  We had to listen to the bored staff's banter the entire time there. Right off the bat, we noticed how expensive the beer prices were. Like \\"strip club\\" expensive. You had a choice of 12 oz. Or 16 oz. Draught beers. 12oz Fat Tire? Really? It comes in cans larger than 12 oz now.\\n     After looking at the menu, which reminded me of hotel \\"room service\\" prices, I had many questions. Wings will set you back about $10, for 10. No, I am not joking. After asking, I was told they come with only celery. This is by far, the highest price I have ever seen for wings. Other places at least give you fries too for that much money. Every burger on the menu seemed to have some other thing piled onto it (chili, ham, stew, even pulled pork). They seemed to love adding a fried egg to whatever they can as well. If I worked in this kitchen, I would turn to my co-workers and scream \\"TA-DAAA!!!\\" Every time this happened. It seems everybody is trying to cram burgers down your throat with all these \\"boutique\\" burger joints popping up everywhere. My guess is the only way to top them is to literally \\"top\\" them.\\n     Well after picking a burger with grilled jalapenos, with the fries, still no happy hour rush. It was about 6:30 now. Our burgers were tasty, but the prices still tainted the experience. My other choice would have been the Fish 'n Chips ($12, and I was very glad these Americans properly called them \\"chips\\" and not \\"French Fries\\"). I did get to taste the Fish 'n Chips, when I finished, because there were many little burnt particles at the bottom of my basket from the fryer.  \\n     The burger was nicely cooked, and full of flavor. But, again the prices were a point of contention. After we finished eating, we decided to have our next beer someplace else. Our bill was almost $70 for 2 burgers and 3 beers each! HOLY.... This place reminds me or The Grove on La Vista, for their \\"nickel-and-diming\\" menu, and silly pricing. At least The Grove  is now established, and is a better place to see a game. Local no. 7 can't offer even that. I understand if you don't want to be a \\"sports bar\\", but be honest. There are a bajillion other places that look similar, don't care what they are called, and serve great food at fair prices. There is absolutely nothing exclusive about this place, and it has no redeeming \\"local hangout\\" quality about it. It's just an overpriced attempt to be one.

A $4 menu that consists of drinks that are beautiful to look at, sweet to taste if that's what you want (I usually have the Sparkling Sangria), & contain the right amount of alcohol in them. I'll tell you what, it seems to take a lot of skills & umm NOT BEING cheap for happy hour restaurants to figure out how to make sweet yet strong drinks for the ladies, keep it classy! Anyways back to Salty Sow, the Honey Rosemary fried chicken is umm bangin' (2 large pieces of chicken with a large biscuit; shoot that's better than Popeye's Tuesday deal considering the quality). Who knew fried chicken could be sweet?! As you must have read in the other reviews, the Crispy Brussel Sprout Leaves dish is the best! Probably, the best brussel sprout dish I've had in Atx & we know Atx knows how to do Brussel Sprout. The crispy bite with the sweetness of the golden rasins, WOW! If you like pate, order the Chicken Liver Mousse; basically for a pate, the taste isn't too strong or heavy. Also go ahead and tell your waiter/waitress to bring you more bread for it as you will need it. I also like the truffle oil french fries here. As for the service, very friendly. Atmosphere, southernly homey. It's a great place to chat with friends, esp. if you go early and the place isn't too crowd yet, bc it will be! I tell a lot of other people about this place & now you fellow yelpers! However, a part of me is scared I'm giving away a golden secret away! lol So why the 4 stars since I clearly love this place, well I've been a fan of everything but my entree & dessert orders. For example, the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder lacked flavor and was comparable to ordering pork used to cook Vietnamese soups which will cost less than off of the $16 price here. Shootm you could even get it for free if the Viet restaurant simply needs the pork to cook the soup! Then, there was the Bananas Foster Beignets; waaaaay too much breading, there needs to be a balance on the plate.

I don't particularly eat a lot of Thai food, so I only know a few places like Nida's and Basil around here. I feel like in comparison to some of the other Thai places, this place has fairly solid food. My entree was fairly tasty, but I was also starving that day, so perhaps anything would have been tasty.\\n\\n\\nWent with a group of about 16 or so on a Saturday night at 6:30pm. Good thing we had reservations, as the place is TINY; we probably took up half the seats. They probably don't have groups as big as ours regularly given the restaurant size. As such, they seemed to not be able to handle the group very well. Food took a while to get out. On one hand, I think it's a bit cool cause I think the make all the dishes fresh, but on the other, it just seems like lack of preparation for what I think should be expected for restaurants. For instance, our whole group got entrees except for one friend who ordered two appetizers. She literally received her food at least 15 minutes after everyone else had theirs. This was even after we had some of the same appetizers shared amongst our huge table at the beginning. Despite ordering at the same time, I'm left wondering why appetizers took that much longer to prepare than the full entrees... Poor planning on their part I think.\\n\\nDrinks: Got Thai iced tea, pretty solid, standard. Super sweet as it uses heavy cream ad sweetened condensed milk. If you've never had Thai iced tea, be prepared for sugar overload...but it's delicious. Several people got the homemade ginger ale. Not the typical sweet ginger ales you may be accustomed. You could definitely taste the ginger in these. I'm personally not a huge fan of ginger overload, so it was just \\"meh\\" to me, but others remarked they loved it.\\n\\nAppetizers: Spring rolls were...different. Not the usual Vietnamese spring rolls. These were all vegetarian without noodles and differing fillings, including avocado. A little dry by itself if you don't use the sauce. Was ok. Calamari was...different. It was a grilled piece of squid. Kinda chewy as expected, had a strong fishy smell. Didn't really enjoy it that much. Fried tofu was delicious.\\n\\nEntree: I got the beef curry. It's a green curry. Found it a bit unusual they didn't have a chicken curry, although I suspect they could have just substituted the meat had I asked. Menu said the curry used a spicy coconut milk base. I detected no spiciness at all. They didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it either when I ordered, so I assumed they just made it spicy enough normally. Disappointed in that. Otherwise, it tasted good. Wish they gave more rice though. They give you a very, very small cup of it in comparison to all the curry in there. I had plenty of the liquid left that I wish I had more rice to soak it up with.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I was satisfied with my meal, but I wasn't blown away nor that impressed.

Whole crab (which they show it to you live before they cook it) cooked with your choice of salt and spice, fried, or black bean sauce. We ordered our two pounder with black bean sauce, along with an order of baby bok choy in garlic sauce and Ma Po tofu. Everything, from the sauce on the crab to the sauce on the vegetables and the tofu, was slimy, thick and loaded with MSG. There was hardly any meat in the 'fresh' crab and the shell itself didn't crack open, so much as it gave way when you bent it. Trying to suck the meat out of various parts left me with a mouthful of the broken off bits shell and very little meat.\\n\\nDid we order wrong? How can you mess up baby bok choy in garlic sauce and a spicy tofu dish? The service was not quite as horrendous as most people have described.

This is a dish I order often when I go to Thai food places. It's the best I've had. There is TONS of chicken (looks like breast meat too). The vegetables are really fresh, not mushy. It's not super greasy like you get at most Thai places. The cost was $8.99 for the lunch size, and I definitely think this is two meals for me (small pregnant lady). I'm sold.

The brisket is fantastic whether it is on top of your burger or buy itself but the bbq sauce is pretty spicy so either ask for it on the side or wipe it off if your palate prefers milder food. Your daily caloric intake will probably be filled with just one meal and you will immediately move in to a food coma.  The staff are always very nice and accommodative as well.

The only place they list their specials is in the front when you walk into the restaurant and only in Chinese.  So not only do you have to ask what the specials are, you have to get them to describe to you what the dish is supposed to be.  As a family, we order lobsters, chicken, and whole fish and a rice dish and noodles and tofu.  Something that is out of the norm, we tried their flounder special that was described as pan fried.  When the fish arrived it was deep fried - extra well done.  Then it was spicy.  Now normally I wouldn't care if my food is spicy, but I was with my grandmother and I love her dearly.  This was awful. The fish was not fresh and the preparation was terrible. \\n\\nWait staff - I feel like I had to be my own table's waitress.

When we walked in the hostess immediately greeted us and showed us to our seats. With in what seemed like seconds the server was already bringing out some waters. \\n\\nWe reviewed the menu and the server stopped by every couple of minutes to see if we needed anything or had any questions about the menu. Everything sounded delicious, but we eventually started off with the wow boa, Mongolian wings, and shrimp nigiri. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided any information we needed about the dishes. \\n\\nThe shrimp nigiri arrived on a fish shaped plate with some wasabi. I'm not a huge wasabi fan but theirs was awesome. Slightly sweet and fresh tasting. \\n\\nNext we received both the Mongolian wings and the boas; at that point we gave the waiter our order. The presentation of everything looked awesome and both dishes were hot when they came out. Both dishes were very good with tons of flavor. My only grip would be more pork belly in the buns but it was still very good. \\n\\nAs for the main course we ordered the general tso chicken and the sizzling evil ribs. They give you a very large portion of food with both of these dishes, and the evil ribs come with a show. The ribs were something special. Very juicy and tender on the inside with this thick crusty bark out the outside. I wasn't sure the purpose for the cheesy sauce that comes with it but it worked. It was almost like a neutralizer for the spiciness so you could dive right back in. As a man i can admit I almost cried when the were gone; not because I was still hungry but because I didn't want that magical moment to end. As for the general tso chicken, it came with tons of well glazed juicy/tender chunks of chicken. No tiny little pieces of chicken either. It wasn't to spicy which was okay since we had the ribs to balance it out. \\n\\nOver all every item we ordered was worth it. The prices are very fair for the portions and quality of food you get. The service was perfect and the waiter did a phenomenal job being attentive and making conversation during his visits. I told my wife so many times that I felt like I was in another world because the atmosphere was so relaxing and heavenly. I was confident that I knew what I would receive as far as the food went based off the information the server provided. He even gave me a drop of sauce I now call the death drop, This fire of a sauce that gives you a rush with just the tiniest little drop. Which I ended up asking for more for some strangle reason, so I was on fire the entire time. \\n\\nOh let me not forget the yummy peanut butter cookie cup dessert thing we had. It was this creamy whipped peanut butter chilled and served with ice cream. It almost looks like ice cream sandwich but way more sophisticated and mind blowing. We tried to figure out what exactly it was and our final conclusion was the perfect ending to a  great food adventure. \\n\\nThank you jade sushi for such an awesome dining experience for my wife and I.

Where are the best places to eat? That's what I wanna know. Forget historical and cultural points of interest. It's all about the food.\\n\\nI was spending a day and a night in Boston with some friends. A friend of a friend recommended some Italian place in Boston's North End, which is basically nothing but Italian restaurants. Well, we never made it to our intended destination as we were sidelined by Carmelina's. \\n\\nI dunno, there was something about the menu posted outside that drew us in. That,  and the inviting atmosphere; modern, but rustic, with forgiving, ambient lighting.\\n\\nThe wine selection is limited and I believe all Italian, as far as vintages go. I had a fantastic Chianti. \\n\\nWe shared the Simple Arugula salad, the Winter Blood Orange and Beet salad and a house salad. All excellent. The arugula salad was drenched in extra virgin olive oil and lemon, yet not a bit over done. And that blend of blood orange and beets? Oh, my.\\n\\nFor the main course, I ordered the carbonara. Never-- in my life-- and this is not an exaggeration-- have I ever had pasta this outrageously good. It was as perfect as  pasta can get and let me tell you, you get a lot. The portions are incredibly generous. One of my friends ordered the \\"Sunday Macaroni\\". After a couple of bites she said, \\"This is better than the pasta I had in Italy.\\" So, of course I had to have a bite of this \\"Sunday Macaroni\\" which is laden with meatballs, sausage and short ribs in a tomato sauce. Oh. My. God. \\n\\nSeriously. The food at Carmelina's is that good. I'm still fantasizing about that carbonara. I'm not kidding. \\n\\nAside from the food, the service at Carmelina's is spot on, friendly, and utterly non-pretentious. \\n\\nIt should be noted that Carmelina's does not serve dessert or coffee. This, we learned, is out of respect for the pastry and gelato shops and cafes in the area. In fact, as we were being seated, the guy at the adjoining table shifted his bag away from our table to the other side of himself. My friend reassured him he didn't have to do that, and in his very Boston accent he replied, cheekily, \\"Oh, yes I did. I don't trust you. I can see it in your eyes.\\" Turns out that bag contained pastries from Mike's Pastries across the street. (They're very serious about their pastries around here. We'd noticed Mike's as were wending our way through the neighborhood. It was packed.) Our server informed us Mike's would soon be closing for the night, so one of my friends ran off in the middle of our salad course to score some cannoli and Boston cream pie.\\n\\nI kid you not, if ever I visit Boston again, Carmelina's will be my first stop."},{"name":"Austin Juicy Jerk","address":"East Side Food Ct, 907 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is awesome!

Please don't be fooled by the boring exterior. Finally had lunch here and can't wait to go back. I choose the turkey dinner and that turned out to be a large serving of dark meat turkey with a scoop of potatoes and stuffing with a roll. Most places give you more stuffing and potatoes and can skimp on the turkey, this places skimped on the filler and was generous with the turkey.  My dining partner had a turkey sandwich that looked really good and well-priced. Other things that came out of the kitchen looked equally as good including many non-turkey items. This deli has a little something for every taste and lunch need.  If you have room be sure to check out the cookies at the front counter. Soft, large and they looked house made. I don't know that for a fact but it sure seemed that way.  I noticed that food came out quick and a lot of people were getting things to go.

My gf and I decided to try it out before meeting up with friends.   Upon arrival, they asked if we had reservations.   We did not.  It was still early so it wasn't packed.  They asked us if it was ok if we sat on patio out back.  The place is pretty small but with great spaces for larger parties as well.   The outside was perfect.  the weather was great and no loud people on the patio.   The waiter took a bit longer than we expected but, once he came by things ran smoothly from there.  My gf ordered a LA FRESA.  I ordered a Pacifico.  Weird that, it wasn't till the middle of my meal that i noticed the waiter brought me a Victoria. Be careful.  This is not a Pacifiico.  Make sure they bring you a Pacifico if you ask for one.  My gf really liked her La Fresa.  Fruity and fresh and cold.   With our drinks we ordered guacamole with chips.   Very good and fresh.  The chips were not the regular chips you find at a mexican restaurant.  Theses were the flour tortillas, cut, and fried.  Very good.  not to salty or dripping with oil.  Not sure how they are made but, they were GOOD.   I ordered the tacos gaonera.  when your browse the menu, hoping they are still serving them, they are as good as they sound on the menu.  Soooooooooo tender.  The guac and mild salsa that came with the dish were a great accompaniment to the dish.   I would recommend this dish, a thousand times over.  My gf ordered the caldo tlapeno.  Please find this on the menu.  The chicken had just the right amount of spice.  My gf said it was really good.  A light but, filling soup.

The sandwich was large, filling, grilled well, and used chicken breast and not lunch meat.

The hostess was also very friendly.  We waited about 15 minutes around 6:30/7:00.  The restaurant is clean and attractive with a diner motif and open kitchen.  I really appreciate the modern, spacious interior, as this is not always what one finds in a vegetarian/vegan establishment; they tend to be very cramped.  We easily found a parking spot on the street.\\n\\nAlthough the food was good, it was not outstanding.  We tried a few things - cheese fries, onion rings, cauliflower entree, and some desserts - all vegan.  They were all good, we ate everything, just not quite 5 stars worthy....

He didn't attend to us much after that, it turned into a tag team effort between him and another friendly girl.

Everyone is raving about the food here, so was excited to try it. Maybe it was a little my fault for going on one of the hottest days of the year (I think it was 104 today), but since this is a trailer set up, there is no air conditioning, so I was hoping this was the best thing I have ever eaten to make the heat of eating outside worth it. I showed up about an hour before they closed for the day, and still had most of the menu less pork and beef ribs, so impressed that they didn't run out yet. On one hand running out of meat does show something about how good the place is, but on the other hand it losses something/a little frustrating when they run out. I go back and forth with it, as do you not know how to forecast your sales that you can't plan accordingly -- the business major in me says you are losing money by not having product to sell, but the marketing person in me says that being out is building the hype, but I would rather not have to worry about the place being out if it's the best quality.\\n\\nSo my normal order was crushed with them being out of ribs, but did have my order of brisket. One of the best barks on a brisket that I think I have ever had, BUT when I ask for a moist cut, and there is too much fat that I end up throwing away a few good size pieces because it was literally all fat and a little line of smoke bark. Sadly disappointed, as it could have been one of the better flavors I have had, but considering the portion of fat to meat was significantly higher than any other place I have eaten at, it was a bummer. I was thinking about this as I was walking away, there is a fine line between trimming enough, too much, and not enough fat before smoking the brisket. In this case, I don't think they trimmed any off.\\n\\nAlso, I am not a BBQ sauce fan unless it's not-that-great meat, but I won't even touch it since it with the questionable looking bottles that have more than likely been sitting in the 100 plus heat all day long.

My husband picked up the food and paid, to be informed as he was walking out the door that there wasn't any pita. At most other places this wouldn't be a big deal, but if you've had Rustica's homemade fresh baked pitas you would be bummed too. At least tell the customer before ordering, or offer 10% off a trivial gesture that would show the customer that you care. When he got home, we had one incorrect dressing (ranch instead of Greek, gross), and two bites in my husband found the biggest grossest fly in his salad. He drove back to Rustica, the employees working didn't really care and we decided that would be the last visit for awhile.\\n\\nLater on that day the manager did call, but spent much of the phone call debating our concerns (hygiene, customer service, inconsistency). I'm not usually an obnoxiously argumentative customer but it kills me that the food is really good! He offered to put free salads on our account, but after we waited a couple of months and tried again, none of the employees would give us the free salad and insisted there was no such comp on our account.

The one in \\"the pearl\\" run by that woman who has the inexplicably popular Italian place on Morrison is truly terrible. But this place rocks...it is pretty close to the best pizza I've had in the USA at Una Pizza Napoletana in SF (formerly in NYC). If you factor in the five buck margherita during their very generous happy hour, well, it's no contest. The crust it nearly perfect, the tomato component is just acidic enough, and the mozzarella, though not di buffala, is exemplary. Why there is not a line out their door, I don't know. They deserve it. But Portlanders, bless their little pea-pickin' hearts, really don't know shit from shinola when it comes to food.

We went on a Sunday night were they offer Happy Hour from 9:00 p.m to close and were both super pumped about the menu and selections which were fulled sized and half off. My husband got the boneless wings and I got the sliders with sweet potato fries. We also split a side of fried mac and cheese. The portions are huge so I was able to doggie bag it for a second meal. My husband said he would return  again just for the wings he liked them so much. He said they weren't breaded and the sauce was spicy. The fried mac and cheese was super tasty and came with a tomato based dipping sauce reminiscent of tomato soup and a mushroom cream sauce (this was the only part of the meal we didn't enjoy - the sauce had a very bizarre flavor).

There is a very keen willingness to help, but they are also relatively soft-spoken, knowing when to interject and when to back away, which is becoming more and more rare these days.  Also, a few of our guests came with food restrictions that we hadn't known about, and they were accommodated quickly and with quality substitutions. \\n\\nI have read many of the reviews for MM and all I can gather is that people want to complain about anything possible when their food is expensive, and that they may think they know more about the cuisine than they do, leading them to some degree of disappointment.

Chang's","address":"6135 Parkcenter Cir","city":"Dublin","stars":"3","text":"I've dined at multiple different PF's on several different occasions in the past and was never overly impressed with the food or massive horse statue but Ive had a few more pleasant experiences at the Dublin location. \\n\\nOverall I prefer the appetizer menu to the main courses. The crispy green beans and accompanying dipping sauce are fantastic (but really have I ever met a dipping sauce I didn't want to marry? no.) I also adore the chicken lettuce wraps and the crab rangoons . The portions are very large and an app can easily serve as an entire meal. I do no recommend the scallops as I've ordered them several times and they are always over cooked and rubbery. I do give PF's credit for introducing me to one of my current crushes, Chilean sea bass. It is the best thing on the menu and although Ive since had sea bass at several sea food restaurants I'd say PF's version ain't half bad. I enjoy the overall ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant, for a chain restaurant I think it is a pretty good choice for a date or gathering with a few friends. \\n\\nMy most recent dining experience,which prompted this review, was a post dinner drink experience wrapping up a sub par first date. Date and I entered the bar around 9 on a Saturday night and the bar was nearly empty. We took seats at the bar and ordered a glass of pinot and a mojito. Date had never had a mojito before and wanted to try something new. The mojito was great as well as the pinot. The bartender was personable and eventually we started talking about sake to which my date remarked he also never tried. The bartender gave us a piping hot \\"container\\" on the house and eventually over the course of the evening we sampled several more versions of hot and cold sake and some different versions of plum and ice wines all on the house. \\n\\nThe bartender was definitely the highlight of the date as the more sake and wine said date drank the more comfortable he got which involved telling me all about his hobbies (huntin, fishin and beer), favorite foods (pork, onions and fried cheese), and hopes and dreams (to never leave Springfield Ohio). We ended the evening in a heated discussion about whether it was OK to use the \\"C\\" word in general conversation (Obv date took the affirmative side on this debate). When the date hit the restroom I quickly paid the tab as I did not trust him to leave an appropriate tip. \\n\\nIt is always nice when a chain restaurant can make an experience feel unique. Overall, as chains go, PF Changs is not half bad and it is certainly more likely that Ill return to PF Changs than go on another date with previously mentioned suitor from the sticks."},{"name":"Black Point","address":"570 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The service is very fast here.

Very very good.\\n\\nIt was restaurant Week so I ordered the Truffle Deviled Eggs and my wife ordered the lobster bisque. The eggs had a very small hint of truffle and roe, which provided a burst of flavor at the end of your bite. I enjoyed that very much. You get 3 deviled eggs, which isn't bad for an appetizer. The lobster bisque was nothing different from what I've had. They had some decent size pieces of lobster but nothing amazing or to die for.\\n\\nThe entrees are pretty much a la carte, the waiter warned us and asked if we wanted sides with that. You'll be ok without extra sides. I got the ribeye center cut steak which was very juicy. Cooked to perfection to how I like it. It came with a horseradish sauce for dipping. My wife got the salmon. She enjoyed it and said it was cooked to how she like it. Pink in the middle and still soft and juicy.\\n\\nThe dessert was a chocolate torte. VERY thick and sweet. I could only handle half of that, since I'm not a big fan of those kind of chocolate.\\n\\nOverall, a nice quiet dinner for restaurant Week with excellent food.

We got here 30 minutes before opening and there was already a line 100 strong. By the time the truck opened at 11 there was easily 300 people in line. Many folks brought lawn chairs and coolers of beer. Just take note that parking is tough to find here (and in Austin in general) so cab it. We were lucky and found a spot.\\n\\nWe waited for two hours before we made it to the front of the line. The time goes by fast as you will meet cool new friends. I met two Virgin America pilots who love to eat and drink. We had much in common. They said this was the third weekend in a row they have been back to la Barbecue so I knew it must be good. Also on Saturdays they have a keg of free beer available to anyone over 21. Good beer too. They were out of pork and beef ribs when we made it to the front of the line but that's okay because we came for brisket. I had bummed a sample of their sausage from someone else while waiting as well so I ordered more of that. We also got a side of their chipotle cole slaw and potato salad. For everything including the pound of brisket and two Mexican Cokes our total come to $40.01. They told us to keep the penny.\\n\\nWe sat down at one of their many picnic tables and woofed down the brisket. It is very rich and fatty but full of smokey and meaty goodness. Definitely the best brisket I've ever tasted. The sauces they have at the table accompanied the meat very well. You don't need the sauce but the zing from the vinegar based sauce helps cut some of the fattiness and keeps you coming for more bites even though you are ridiculously full. The sausage is also ridiculous. Spicy and bursting with flavor. The sides were also very good. The chipotle slaw was spicy and refreshing all at the same time. My wife loved the potato salad as it didn't have much mayo and used red potatoes with the skins.\\n\\nOverall I'm glad this was my first and only Austin BBQ experience.

Very inviting atmosphere, and no doubt a hotspot on beautiful & sunny ATX days with all the outdoor seating. The place offers plenty of parking which is nice. \\n\\nI came here with my wife and our typical restaurant trend is to get a handful of things we can split/try together, especially while visiting new restaurants (which was the case with Contigo tonight). I had read other Yelp reviews to get an idea of what was good here since off the bat, the menu can seem a bit \\"exquisite\\" for some. With that said, we ordered the crispy green beans with sambol aioli. I can see why many people who reviewed this place suggested them; they were phenomenal. Lightly-breaded and tastefully salty and complimented well with the sambol aioli. \\n\\nFor a drink, we ordered the Dos Flores (bourbon, lemon, honey, xtabentun, lavender bitters). I really have zero clue what \\"xtabentun\\" is, but the drink was incredibly refreshing with the perfect blend of ingredients. A great ice-to-drink ratio as well preventing the drink from becoming watery. \\n\\nNext, we had the prosciutto with arugula meat plate. This wasn't any ordinary prosciutto, though. It was from a 33 month aged pig. That's right: 33 MONTHS. NEARLY 3 YEARS!?! And what was even cooler was that they had just started cutting the meat that day we ordered it. I'm not sure how 3 year old aged pig is supposed to taste, but the meat was wonderfully tasty with that awesome salty taste. This was a $10 plate, mind you, for not a whole lot of meat. Which is understandable because you are paying for how aged it is. So unless you are into that sort of thing, I wouldn't use your money on it if they offer it at some other point you visit. But tasty nonetheless. \\n\\nWe then ordered the daily fresh sausage which happened to be pork. It was served on a baguette with onions, Dijon, and French fries. We paid the extra $1 for sauerkraut. Delicious sausage that rivals places such as Easy Tiger and Bangers. \\n\\nOverall, my wife and I enjoyed this fun, new restaurant adventure.

When we ordered, the service people seemed irritable and were generally not helpful when I asked for recommendations as a new customer. The ambiance is also not very good, given that everyone eats in a convenience store at giant shared tables. Compared to the Rudy's welcome chant / sampler, and the Rudy's option to eat outdoors, this place gets a \\"-1\\".

Guess it is not possible to give zero stars.  There is a reason this place is usually empty. We came on a Sunday night and there were 7-9 other tables with people when we were there.  The restaurant has a huge upstairs and downstairs, so it was around 10% capacity or less.  We ordered drinks and appetizers and waited 15 minutes before we even got water to the table.  By the time the drinks and chips rolled around, the ice had melted in the glasses.  We ordered food and over an hour later nothing. Nada.  Zip. Our waiter avoided eye contact most of the night.  When I got up to talk to a manager about the long wait, she was hiding in the kitchen.  Not helping. Not trying to figure things out. I saw her through the glass. She was hiding.  I asked her to please come up and give us our bill as we were leaving. She promised the food was on its way out now and she would \\"take care of me\\".  She asked if they could send over a round of drinks.  15 minutes later- still no food.  Manager no where to be found. Waiter was very apologetic. I asked him what was going on- there were only 5 other tables at that point and the staff outnumbered the customers.  He just shook his head and promised to send the manager out.  When she finally came out, me and my dining partners told her how we felt.  We have all worked in food service and we get off nights, but this was totally unacceptable. She looked at her watch. While we were talking to her.  Yep. She was less than apologetic, shrugging her shoulders and her eyelids were so heavy I thought she was on tranquilizers. She promised again to take care of us and, after our drinks arrived (wrong drinks) and the food finally arrived (two of the four entrees were the wrong ones) our check arrived. the free drinks weren't free.  No discount. No anything.  When I asked if that was what she meant, she took the check back and brought it to us minus 15 dollars.  Of course, she still charged us for the free drinks, which were not the drinks we even ordered, at a cost of over 30 dollars.  Nice.  I gave up. AT that point, what else was I going to do?  We paid the bill, tipped the waiter (who was super apologetic and it wasn't his fault) and I will never go back. Ever.  Its one thing if you have a rough night and your kitchen is screwed up.

To take it further, the server suggested that we may not like the spices in the dish but that the fish was perfectly fine - we politely requested a replacement entree which was reluctantly delivered.  Our replacement entree was the curried vegetable strudel - we were much happier than with the salmon as eating the strudel wasn't going to kill us, but aside from avoiding death, the strudel was unremarkable.  \\n\\nOur other entree was the sirloin with escargot.

The restaurant is secluded on the edge of the Mueller lake and next to a nondescript apartment complex--perfect for no external noise or city bustle on the streets outside.\\n-The communal tables that seat multiple parties are comfortable without feeling like you're elbows with others. Every group that I have ever shared a table with has been pleasant, smiling, and if they brought dogs, had dogs that were sweet and controllable. Smaller tables that seat 4 and the bar allow for more privacy. \\n-Their cocktails are creative, and their bartenders are skilled in whipping up something if you'd like a slight modification. They are approachable for questions on suggestions, can likely recreate something similar to an old cocktail from last season, and usually have 6+ local, rotating taps that are carefully curated.\\n-Their food is fresh, local, and delicious, and they have $1 fried chicken every Thursday evening (this ALONE is great). Their okra is so, so good. I like the pork liver pate (served with eggplant and honey). The rabbit is a filling dish and their burger is pretty solid (didn't like that the bacon was chewy rather than crunchy) and comes with lots of fries and aioli.\\n\\nThings that I think keep me from thinking they're \\"as good as it gets\\": \\n\\n-Their happy hour could offer better appetizers: I personally think their ox tongue slider is good but disappointingly small at one and a half bites. The white bean dip is a great deal in terms of volume for the price, but I personally would prefer if it had more flavor. I would love to see some beefier (not necessarily meat-wise) appetizers offered, but they don't seem to have a problem selling other various menu items (directing guests to order entrees and small plates to fill up), so it seems unlikely to change what already brings people in for HH.\\n-I believe that the dining experience here is valuable and that local food is priced higher because of the quality, but at the same time It is definitely not the cheapest place to get food and many dishes seem to me to be on the higher boundary of what I'd pay for a dish without feeling like I'm almost being overcharged to eat it in a fancy backyard. Even though I've been here many times, I've hardly gotten a good sampling of the entire menu because of this. Some will think it's a great deal and some may be unwilling to pay more at this particular price point, but we can agree that overall they are a little more approachable than other farm to table's.\\n\\nSome logistical notes: \\n-When it rains, they essentially lose half of their seating since many of the larger picnic tables are not covered. \\n-Dogs are allowed only in the graveled areas and not underneath the patio (if you make a reservation, DO share via phone if you will be bringing a dog. \\n-Make a reservation. On any weekend night (Th-Sat) as most places in Austin, expect to wait unless you have a reservation. They will even call you to confirm the reservation. Otherwise, that is what the outdoor bar and east seating is for. \\n\\nThat all being said, I do love Contigo and will definitely be returning in the near future. The twinkle lights don't feel quite as gimmicky here as other places because the design is charmingly well thought out, and the soap in the bathroom is definitely so good that they've told people not to steal it (Check it: Jean Baptiste 1717 by Niven Morgan).

I had the Contigo Ranch, which was tasty, yet left me wanting a larger drink. Collins glasses are no bigger than highball glasses, y'all. Just sayin.\\n\\nThen we come to the food. FOOD!!\\nWhite Bean Dip- as with many things that contain Duck Fat, I cannot get the sense of duck-ness that I'm thinking it'll have. This was no different, and my better half explained that it usually is used to give a more creamy texture. All in all, this one was a hit with everyone. \\n\\nTexas Okra- All-around winner here. Were the okra pickled? If so, I might like to try this one with non-pickled okra, but the flavor and texture combinations here are  pretty outstanding.\\n\\nCrispy Green Beans- Eh. I mean, they were good, but not \\"Y'all gotta try these if you've never been here before\\" good, as our waiter gushed. They were tasty on their own. The \\"sambol aioli\\" was more the latter than the former, with no real heat or flavor coming from the chile.\\n\\nChicken Pat√©- Very tasty and not too overpowering. The pickled sweet potatoes were an interesting choice that worked well both on their own and with the pat√©.\\n\\nChicken Thigh- I was curious. It didn't look like something truly thrilling, but BOY HOWDY! This was probably our favorite as far as flavor combinations go. There was sweet, buttery, savory, green...y, and crispy goodness all around. Well done.\\n\\nI'll be back to try out them pickled beets and a few others I missed this time around. I hope this place does well."},{"name":"Green Lemongrass","address":"1086 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This is one of my all time favourite restaurants and some of the best pho broth that I've had in the city.

There is just something different about the experience now that they're in a bigger space. The service has drastically declined. Our meal has taken forever the last two times we've gone. The servers aren't nearly as friendly. There are just so many tables! It's like being in a cafeteria, and I don't like it.\\n\\nTwo times ago I said never again, but somehow I found myself suggesting Amaya's this past Tuesday when we were starving and in need of food quickly.

I was on my way to the other side of town to find some good and healthy food. However, I just did not feel up to driving too far this particular day. So, I stopped in and was met by the wonderful host and co-owner, Hannah. As soon as I stepped in, I found the ambiance of the restaurant so inviting and relaxing, with soft music in the background. I asked Hannah whether the food tasted good. She promised I would like it and even had me to sample the mesir wat (lentils) and the gomen (collard greens). Wow! I had found my spot for authentic Ethiopian food after searching far and wide! After eating my meal, I ordered three take out orders for my family because I had to let them know that there was a great new restaurant near the Stone Mountain area. I ordered three vegetarian platters (consisting of mesir wat, yellow split peas, gomen and cabbage) and one order of  talapia. Everyone in my house, even my children who were 12 and 10, was impressed to the point that it has become my family's favorite restaurant. My 10 year old son, who loves New Era's fresh cabbage and gomen, often asks us to take him to the restaurant. Did I say that it was family friendly and affordable? New Era Cafe offers the most authentic and healthiest Ethiopian food in Atlanta.

I politely declined because I didn't want to infringe on his dinner, but that was really nice of him. Unfortunately the pic did not save, so I can't post it.\\n\\nFinally they brought it out and it looked so beautiful. All the colors. It tasted so fresh. The dough was just the right consistency, not too crunch or soft.  The sauce wasn't extra heavy which I like. It was light but filling at the same time if that makes sense.

The first time I went, I ordered one of almost every taco. Carnitas, al pastor, lengua, pork in chile verde and carne asada. They were all delicious, although the seasoning on the meat was a bit muted. Lengua is my favorite taco meat and it was slightly bland but still very good and tender. The pork in chile verde was saucy and awesome. May need a fork with that one. My favorite was the carnitas. So tender and juicy, I just wish it had those crispy bits like the ones I make at home. The next time I went I got the carnitas burrito, which was excellent. Not the monster sized burrito like in SD, but very filling and reasonably priced. The guac is just the way I like it. Simple, bright, and fresh. Too many ingredients just water it down and mask the flavor of the avocado.

It was so romantic.\\n\\nI love bringing my studies here because in this cafe, I feel transported to another place. \\n\\nI will mention that this place gets crowded! Especially on weekends. I often see the owner racing around during these busy times. They are pretty strict about seating too, so that there is enough room for everyone. A few times, I have sat at the barista counter, which was not so ideal for getting work done. \\n\\nThe service can also be slow, and sometimes the drinks (if made by not as experienced employees) can be disappointing. So I've learned to always get something simple - I usually enjoy a pot of mint tea and also treat myself to one of the numerous gold-foil wrapped chocolates that they feature in the front room.

First of all, the service (aka the  cashier/waitress) is as attentive and friendly as it gets. My boyfriend and I literally stood and contemplated what to order for a good fifteen minutes, but she was patient and offered us helpful suggestions, all the while smiling cheerfully. \\n\\nTheir happy hour menu is decent, and they offer a sprinkling of different and unique rolls as all the basics. We shared an unagi bento box and sushi (Longhorn, avocado, and volcano rolls). The bento box seemed a bit scant, so don't expect a huge, filling meal out of it, but the unagi was perfect. I also appreciated the unique little touches, especially chocolate-covered oranges for dessert. I was impressed with the sushi. Our waitress highly recommended the volcano and Longhorn rolls and she was right on target. The Longhorn roll came out piping hot and it was, dare I say, even better than Kyoto's. The volcano rolls were topped with spicy salmon (but you can choose between salmon, crab and tuna), and they were also great.\\n\\nOverall, it's one of the cheaper sushi joints out there and the food/service was solid, which means I will have to venture to Dobie more often from now on."},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Visiting from San Diego (suburbs) I don't have any good and /or unique coffee houses so I'm a Starbucks junkie.

Avoid this place if you can, to be honest. To start, the customer service here sucks. Period. When my family and I went, we waited to even be acknowledged. LOL what? Looked at the servers a couple of times and they just stared at us. Well, okay then. After a while, they said \\"wait 2 minutes,\\" as if we weren't already waiting. And this is pretty irritating as there were 2 4-seat tables empty and 3 2-seat tables empty. I went as a group of 5 and they wanted these two girls to finish so that they could put the tables together. But the thing is, there were 3 two-seat tables on the other side that they could've pushed together to make room for us. But no, we waited 10 minutes to sit down when the restaurant was half empty. And even after we were sat down, the server seemed a little mad that WE were mad for the lack of welcome from the servers. And to make it even worse, other than the mad server, there was only another inexperienced server who we saw was refilling water glasses and restocking whatever else she was doing instead of giving us some cups to drink. And we waited around 5 minutes for just that. Food came quick, though which was a plus. However, let me tell you, the food LOOKS amazing, but the taste? No thanks. We got the \\" a little bitter sweet experience for two $23.95.\\" The bananas were completely unripe, the hot chocolate tasted strange, the \\"chocolate drizzled ice cream\\" had no chocolate drizzled. \\n\\nWe also got the cacao 70 triple chocolate cake which looked like a disaster but tasted pretty good for the first few bites but then it became WAY too sweet, and let me tell you, I eat a lot of chocolate, so I have a sweet tooth but this was just way too sweet for me. So anyways, I left it pretty uneaten due to the sweetness. It tasted like a tiramisu. Idk if that's a good thing lol. Plus: only normal whipping cream, not chocolate whipping cream as it stated; where was the chocolate sauce?; and also, where was the melted chocolate pileup? What I got was what looked like a bunch of random stuff mixed with chocolate with white whipping cream beautifully adjusted to the top of the wine glass that they placed the cake in. \\n\\n\\nWe got the cacao 70 cheese cake. I didn't quite like it but my family members said that was the only thing they liked so yay for us, we finally got something good. However: no chocolate sauce that I remember of was displayed in the cheese cake, only the strawberry sauce. And apparently there were supposed to be raspberries too, but nope those were never there.\\n\\nWhen we asked to pay the bill, the server came very timely with the credit card machine, but when we asked to pay with cash, he said \\"oh, sure\\" and then simply left to do other stuff, which I understand, but we waited for him to come back to get the bill for around 5 minutes and he never did, so we just left. Btw, the restaurant was pretty empty at this point- only one other table was occupied aside from us, so I don't understand the holdup. \\n\\nTo sum it up, due to the lack of customer service and HALF ASSED FOOD THAT HAD HALF OF THE INGREDIENTS THEY STATED, please avoid this.

Barleyswine, in the same vein, was the original choice but we opted to A. Try somewhere new and B. Step away from a fixed price menu.\\n\\nArriving ten minutes early for our reservation (at 5:00) we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. This proved to be problematic - we initially said outside but, realizing the sunlight would be blinding, asked to be seated in. This was perhaps a misunderstanding on our part, but suddenly the previously empty restaurant must have been packed because we were given a choice of communal seating or a table that we'd need to vacate at 6:00p for someone else's reservation.\\n\\nThe primary issue being that we had a reservation which seemed to have been discarded by accident. It didn't set a great tone but we proceeded with our meal - trying a selection of appetizers and planning our primary course.\\n\\nHere's where the second hitch came - we were told that ordering off the primary menu began at 5:30. Perhaps I overlooked it, but nowhere on the reservation site indicated this. This would mean that, barring turnaround time from the kitchen, we'd have less than half an hour to eat and enjoy the food, given that our table was destined for other diners. In the end we were given the option to move to window seating when we didn't meet the mark (which was actually quite nice). In the end they were thankful for the flexibility and comped some of our drinks, which did help.\\n\\nPART 2: The food (Or what you probably really care about)\\n\\nSalty Sow has a rather small beer selection, which is always my primary focus. Some are great beers, but I was definitely expecting much more from an Austin gastropub. As I understand it, though, their cocktails are fantastic.\\n\\nWe ordered the Bone marrow appetizer. This was recommended by a friend. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but a cow femur sawed in half and brought to the table wasn't it. In the first half of the bone, the marrow was tasty and rich with a delightful smoky flavor. The second half? I couldn't finish it - it had a cloying barnyard taste that put me off immediately. (this is not the fault of the Salty Sow - it's the nature of the dish, more likely)\\n\\nFor an entree we had the Candied pork belly and chicken thighs, respectively. Both were quite good. The gravy on the chicken and potatoes was wonderful and the collared greens that accompanied the pork belly could not have been more tasty.\\n\\nAll in all, I think Salty Sow is a good gastropub... but for me, it seems like it would be much better as a happy hour spot.

After being seated at the table nearest the cooking being done, our server (not sure of their name maybe Laura or Lauren- was tall, long blond ponytail, had their nails painted a light pink, wore glasses, wart on their face) greeted us- that was fine. My plan wads to get the bbq jackfruit sandwich. Not sure if I had one of those types of days, I was tired, I had some confusion about the breakdown of sides for sandwiches. I told the server I wanted fries and they said what? there are these 3 others options. My confusion must have been not knowing which sides would also come with my order if I also get the fries. Thereafter, their response confused me even more. The server then said well now I am confused which didnt help and made me feel like why would a customer be this confused. Came out pretty condescending and I was not happy. In thinking about the scenario now this server should have broken it down and said \\"the greens always come with this meal and then there are the 3 other options. If you want to substitute one of those 3 other options you will still get the greens and get the substituted item and have to pay that 1.50+ - in this case being the fries. He was coming off impatient and not effectively addressing my confusion. I honestly didn't even want to be served by this person anymore but my partner tried cheering me up. My partner said I will show the example by still giving our server a decent tip although the server did come off like a smart ass to you when you were trying to get your order clarified.

As my mom remarked as we were leaving, the place is filled with dried up estrogen. At this time of year, this place is DECKED OUT like no other in Christmas garb. Like as in how do they pass fire department inspections? Seriously jam packed with not much room to maneuver. You are constantly in the predicament of \\"I feel like I am in someone's way\\" and that is because you are. While there is some pretty nice and tasteful d√©cor, there's also a lot of crap (i.e. Vera Bradley, gag me). The better d√©cor is on the \\"main floor\\" (even though you go up a couple of steps) towards the back to the right of the hideous clothing section (I am always this thorough in my directions). Also, I am baffled at how this place is not whatsoever handicap or elderly friendly considering that is 95% of their clientele. The brick pavers in the entry area are very loose and pretty disconcerting even for my young body - guess it's the lawyer in me. \\n\\nThis place also has a restaurant. This was the main reason why my mom brought me here - it was a place her mother (my grandmother) supposedly loved to go to and I think holds some sentimental value for my mother. Anyways, lunch here is a DISASTER. If you don't get here before 11AM GAME OVER. You will wait at least 1 hour for a table. And for some God forsaken reason - EVERYONE AGREES TO WAIT. I guess it's because they decide to shop/browse, duh. You would think they would offer plentiful sitting/waiting room but nope; one tiny bench that holds 2 geriatric women. Seriously I was feeling really bad for all these women standing on their brittle bones. Also, no railings for customers to get down the stairs into one of the dining areas (ummm again the average age here is 75). Turnover time of tables is excruciatingly long. Even once the previous guests are gone, it takes forever to be cleared and reset. There are no busboys or dedicated table clearing and setting people. The hosts and waitresses are all constantly scrambling doing a job that could be given to at least 2 busboys(girls) (job creation here, people!). ANYWAYS. I guess I should give a food critique too. \\n\\nFood options and the food itself are decent-ish. I got the special that day which was chicken salad on a croissant that was topped w/ tomato, cheddar cheese and this weird raspberry sauce that was baked open faced. I also got the fruit side in lieu of chips.  I should have just stuck to ordering the regular chicken salad sammie on a croissant or their version of a \\"pick two\\" option. Cheddar, while I love, I discovered was the wrong kind of cheese for chicken salad. Cheddar is great for tuna melts. Provolone, swiss or heck even muenster would have been more appropriate. I was looking forward to the raspberry sauce; it was what intrigued me to order this special in the first place. However, it sadly tasted more like slightly flavored raspberry barbeque sauce. Ick. The flavors were just all sorts of off for this dish, which ran, I believe, $10.49 (they may have charged more for my fruit side but they don't itemize your receipt, naughty naughty business practice). I ate the whole thing anyways because I was famished after our hour wait (mind you we arrived at 11:15AM and put our name in, so I am not kidding when I say get here by 11!). My mom got the quiche, which she said was just okay, but she too ate it all because she was famished as well. We were seated in the larger dining area in the back (not the dining area where the hostess is) and I couldn't believe how loud it was. Again, how are these elderly women supposed to be able to converse w/ one another? My mom and I both wished they served alcohol here because we both needed it once we were seated.

It's a nice (upscale) neighborhood bar that knows it's in a neighborhood. I'm very comfortable bringing my kids here, or coming with a group of women friends. And I LOVE the food. I have dirty thoughts about the rabbit and dumplings. Quite likely the apex of upscale comfort food - it's amazing. I also adore the eggplant fritters that come with the pate. And the pate. But especially those fritters. So imagine my delight when my favorite waiter told me I could order just the fritters. Duck fat in my white bean dip? Yes please! Tempurah green beans? You bet!

Lovely use of fresh, seasonal ingredients, local, sustainable meats and really creative and delicious drinks.

An operational problem that really doesn't make sense.  I have no doubt the food is good, but I never actually got close enough to it to find out for myself because the line never moved.  And it wasn't event that long.\\n\\nSome background:  \\n- First off, I came expecting to wait for some time in a long line and I think my expectations are realistic.  And I'm generally fairly patient.\\n- I arrived about 15 minutes after they opened and there was a line of about 20 people in front of me.  Not unexpected for a place everyone is talking about, but 20 people isn't a crazy line.  I expected it to be longer.\\n\\nI'm fine with some waiting but--let's be honest here--a line of 20ish people is not that long.  Any self respecting food truck (even a slow one) should be able to plow through that in 30 to 40 minutes at the most.  But in the hour+ that we waited they served no more than 6 people.  Seriously...6 people.  I'm not exaggerating.  And they weren't walking away with huge bulk orders.  \\n\\nWhat I can't wrap my head around is what the people inside the truck were doing back there (there were at least 2 of them).  There was another guy bringing more BBQ over from the smoker to the truck, so they weren't preoccupied with that.  Everything else is made.  There's no cooking to order here.  Maybe I'm missing something, but all they have to do is cut, weigh, serve, take money, repeat.  How does it take them over an hour to serve 6 people unless one of them is having a heart attack and the other is administering CPR?  I didn't spot any ambulances so I can only conclude one of them died in there.  Or they're both supremely incompetent.\\n\\nI don't get it.  But I did start getting hungry with no solution in sight.  Doing the math, I was still about 2.5-3 hours away from eating so it was time to change course.  Due to the power of \\"the internets\\", I found a highly-rated place (higher than La BBQ btw) about a block away.  We abandoned ship, walked the block and found a line of about 3 people.  We joined the line and about 4 minutes later...we were eating the best BBQ I've ever had in my life.  Moral of the story?  Forget the hype of the place everyone is talking about.  It's not worth the aggravation.  You're in a city with amazing BBQ on every corner.  Just look around and save yourself the frustration.\\n\\nMoral for La BBQ: Seriously people...just give some thought to your operational efficiency.  I know you're popular right now so you don't have to, but we all know that doesn't last forever.  Creating a better experience for your customers while you're still the talk of the town will be the only way to make sure you're not yesterday's news when the shine wears off."},{"name":"Viva Fine Foods & Bakery","address":"1555 Yew Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"2.

Charcuterie and Cocktails. Charcuterie and Cocktails.\\n\\nFULL VERSION:\\nI have left impressed, fulfilled, and completely satisfied with every visit; Salty Sow is unquestionably worth the trip to if you're on the adventurous side with food and drink. Maybe less so if you've got a tendency to be particular about things, or if you're into well-done steaks. Or ketchup.\\n\\nIt should make complete and total sense that dishes involving the namesake would be extraordinary in some sense. Their pork belly entree is divine; their charcuterie is the sort of sick, life-changing thing chef dreams are made of. Country-style pate is my favorite in the mix; there's no abrupt textural imbalances, it's a perfect hodgepodge between soft pork, fatty bits, juicy bits, salt and spice. I think I caught pistachio somewhere in there. I may have been closing my eyes involuntarily in sensory ecstasy. Forewarning - it's a lot of salty sow on that plate. If you're sensitive to cured meats in that way, you'll probably want some bubbly water or a cocktail to cleanse the palate.\\n\\nThe cocktail menu is not only the approachable sort of eclectic, but it's all priced out at a very reasonable flat rate. You'd be doing yourself a disservice to ignore it. I'm a fan of the Blue Sow, as it's basically a martini in a rocks glass. The Maple-glazed old fashioned, while on the sweeter side of things, plays the perfect foil to the salt on the Charcuterie platter.\\n\\nActually, that's kind of a perfect meal here. Charcuterie plate. Old fashioned. You'd be pretty satisfied and happy with that as an individual, but also doing yourself a disservice for not mustering up the stomach space to go one level deeper.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, everything else the menu has to offer is *at worst* good; At it's best, it's knuckle-clenching, heavy-breathing, eyes-rolling-backwards, pound the table and thank whatever higher power you choose good. I mean that with no exaggeration, as the pork belly and greens have twice gotten me to that point of embarrassment in-house. The blackened redfish entree was a remarkable contrast of flavor and texture; the acidity of the tomato never overpowering, but working together with the lemon butter - finding a home base for balance in the quinoa to mellow out in sync - before meeting a flaky, sometimes crispy counterpart in each clean, savory bite of blackened redfish. I enjoyed the beef shoulder, but in the sense of \\"this is good\\", versus \\"my soul needed this\\".\\n\\nIt's not often I elect to do desserts. The bananas foster/beignet thing is one of the better sweets I've put in my mouth, the beignets the best this side of NOLA. Butterscotch budino is also excellent, for those looking for flavor density in a smaller package.\\n\\nEvery visit, the service has been extraordinary. Chris is a standout - earnest, knowledgeable, and genuinely pleasant.

Curiosity got the best of me, though, so I went and tried out the replacements anyway. \\n\\nIt's still pretty good, although I'm not sure what they were thinking with the name. Initials, schmitials--people don't want to think about the ongoing Californian invasion when they're getting their BBQ on. I guess we're supposed to just stick our fingers in our ears and ignore the ever-present spectre of Californication? Ha, no. \\n\\nThey have some decent barbecue here--especially the moist brisket. The moist brisket practically melts in your mouth, like delicious meat candy. Everything is very tender and moist--no knife required (except for the sausage). \\n\\nIt's just lacking something that used to be there. More smoke, perhaps? I didn't notice the same tasty deep pink smoke ring that J. Mueller often had on his meats. \\n\\nNor did I notice the same level of bark around the outside of either the lean or the fatty brisket. It didn't hardly even seem very crispy on the edges in some places. I don't like a lot of bark, but...can't I have just a little bit of bark? Please? The edge pieces that they handed out as samples to the line were just right in terms of bark, but it didn't seem like the slices I got had the same amount of crispy goodness around the edge. \\n\\nThe sausage was decently spicy, but it was also very greasy. I wasn't much of a fan. \\n\\nThe beans and sauce were definitely more flavorful under the previous pitmaster.\\n\\nI like the addition of jalapeno cheddar to the menu, but that seemed like the only change I was happy about. Prices have been raised just a tad and when they're still working all the kinks out, that price raise simply isn't warranted. The line had definite lulls in it when I tried it out--sometimes it would move along at a decent clip, and other times, you'd just be stuck. \\n\\nI don't think the BBQ is quite there, either. As it is, LA BBQ is still just under the upper echelon of barbeque joints--there's a glimmer of meaty, smoky hope, but it's not consistently fabulous enough to join the ranks of Franklin, Stanley's, or--dare I say it?--J. Mueller. It's simply not worth the prices that they're charging for it.\\n\\nAs much as I try to judge this place on its own merits, it's darn near impossible. John has a gift for the art of barbeque. Here's hoping he comes back to grill another day.\\n\\nI guess my favorite place to eat has ceased to be for now.

That's about it.  Oh, right, rancid potato salad. (When that was pointed out, the waitress said \\"Yeah, sometimes it gets like that overnight.\\"  Wait?! What???!!!)  There was nothing special on the other side of the buffet - some chicken nuggets, chicken parm (at a Brazilian BBQ?), some meh meatballs and not much else. \\n\\nThere usually are, and are supposed to be tons of meats, cheeses, olives, etc. etc. etc. There's usually lots of Brazilian specialties - here they had  two stews. One FULL of bones and no discernable meat.\\n\\nSo, yeah, the buffet that looked like it was from a bad wedding reception is abysmal, and partly dangerous to eat.\\n\\n(And i saw NONE of the \\"delicious seafood\\" touted on their website.)\\n\\nNow on to the meat, which is supposed to be the star, and brought out in a \\"never-ending stream\\" (their words, not mine) of grilled meat.

Usually these type of events I just eat because its free but not this time! I had to take a plate home because I could not believe how good it was! Most of my to go plate was the steak tips which of course over a week later had me craving more. Well a few weekends after when passing by with the family (I live 30 mins away) I stopped by and treated them to lunch! The waitress was AWESOME and attentive especially at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon when it wasnt that busy and a lot of others were just hanging around chatting. I usually see the opposite in this situation and the waitress disappear and forget about us. Anyway, back to the food. Started off with potato skins and calimari. I think the calimari may have been frozen which was unfortunate yet I hav had worse and then the potato skins which were legit a potato cut in half portion size was delicious. Entrees came and I was happily surprised. Of course the steak tips are thee best steak tips in MA. I have been on a personal journey to find the best and so far Conrad;s gets the trophy. The rest of the table ordered chicken parm and pasta which I was jealous I did not order and came in a massive portion, kids chicken tenders and fries which was general and kids cheese pizza which was bigger than a Dominos medium pizza! Even though I came for the steak I switched it up and tried the fried haddock and shrimp with mashed and rice pilaf. I was disappointed with the sides which were pretty bland but the haddock was massive and seemed pretty fresh. At first I was disappointed I only got three shrimp but actually eatting them they were definitely Jumbo size! I also got the mixed drink Emerland City (I think) was was absolutely amazing! Feeding a party of five with two appetites was only $80! I wish I lived closer because this place is a GEM!

But let me tell you, Thai Bloom serves some of the finest Thai food I have had anywhere in Oregon or California. I have tried a number of their dishes, but one thing that excites me the most is that this is one of the few places I have found Green Papaya Salad done Laos style! Maybe the salted black paddy crab, more pungent fermented fish sauce and extra chili heat is not for everyone - but for my taste, this salad is just like being back in Thailand. The noodle dishes and curry dishes are spot on point. My only disappointment was when I ordered a duck salad. The \\"duck\\" in the salad consisted mostly of very fatty duck skin. This may have been very authentic as far as Thai cuisine is concerned, and I am sure many people like the texture and flavor of duck fat, but I am not one of them. So for that reason, I am not deducting any stars for the duck fat - I just won't order that particular dish again. The owner was gracious enough to knock a few dollars off our tab, though, so no harm done. I also like the fact that Thai Bloom changes the menu a little according to what is seasonally available. The service we have experienced has been pretty good - sometimes a little slow at lunch time when they are busy. But hey, I have the luxury of being retired, so what's the rush when you are eating awesome food!

Secondly, I ordered the stacked enchilada which had a fabulous description and sounded delicious, but like the chicken, it was incredibly bland. The pasilla peppers gave it a little spice, but for the most part it tasted pasty and bland.\\n\\nI realize that taste is highly subjective and what I may not enjoy someone else might, so when the waitress asked how everything was, I felt bad telling her that I didn't like the meal at all. She was so kind and offered to get me something else so I ordered a cheeseburger which tasted good. The manager came to our table and said he was going to remove the enchilada thing from our bill and even comped the cheeseburger because I had to wait a while for dinner.\\n\\nI might come back in a couple of months to see if time will have helped this new restaurant find it's stride.

We have always gotten the comaliado (I am not spelling that right.. their version of fajitas), and all three versions, beef, chicken and shrimp are fantastic. The pinto beans cooked with chorizo are excellent, as is the Spanish rice that comes with. One order is more than enough for the both of us.

At the very least, it is one of the few remaining, authentic Japanese restaurants operated by Japanese people.  It isn't found in a fancy location, and its decor is unpretentious, but it is one of the finest Japanese restaurants I have been to in recent memory.  I eat \\"Japanese\\" food about twice a week, but a visit here reminds me of what real Japanese food should taste like.  Most other places in town are Chinese/Korean/Vietnamese interpretations of what Japanese food is.  This place is the real deal.\\n\\nSince it was our first time here, we ordered a cross-section of what they offered: a ramen, a donburi, some sushi and their house-made gyozas.  Nothing disappointed.  The firm, fresh ramen was served in a savory chicken broth with assorted pieces of seafood (prawn, scallop, clam, etc...)  Not a single drop of broth remained after we were done.\\n\\nThe gyozas were several orders of magnitude better than the reheated, frozen gyozas that many other restaurants serve.  The sushi rolls were tightly packed, and the fish was as fresh as I have ever tasted.  The Godzilla Cone, by the way, contains shrimp (Ebi), real crab meat and tobiko.\\n\\nThe Beef Donburi was notable in that the beef was served in thin, marinated slices.  Most other restaurants serve minced or ground up beef.  There was a lot of beef too.\\n\\nOur party of three was given our own tatami room.  Our tea was refilled on 4-5 separate occasions.  When we requested extra ginger, they brought us a heaping dish.  The waitresses, dressed in traditional Japanese garb, were very accommodating and eager to please.  \\n\\nWe spent a bit over $50 between two adults but that was probably due to us sampling things.  The price, in my opinion, was worth every penny.  I'm sure you can eat very well for about $15-20 per person if you ordered a bit more selectively.\\n\\nDefinitely will be going back, Koko is just that good."},{"name":"Local No 7","address":"2316 Main St, Ste A","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"I usually go to the Local 7 for trivia.

I held up my plate in the air to help him clear the table, and he totally IGNORED the fact that I was holding the plate and helping him clean the table. I was so upset that the service was so bad, because I had expected the service to be so much better than that. The food on the other hand, was just a bit better than the service.

I was excited to eat here because of their signature Watermelon Steak that they offered on the menu. It's basically a slice of grilled watermelon served with feta cheese and microgreens. It looked gross (thinking of a slab of raw meat, or a liver) but because I've been waiting to try it, I dug right in. It tasted nothing like watermelon but the texture is something undescribable. It's jelly-like with a bite to it. It tasted well with the feta cheese. I've never had cooked watermelon so I was quite impressed with it. I still can't believe it's $10 on the regular menu though. Some of the other girls had a caesar salad that was spicy. This was the original caesar salad with anchovies and a head of romaine. It was pretty good though I was scared to eat the anchovies. The dressing tasted like thousand island for some reason. haha For the entree I had the pan-seared salmon with heirloom tomato risotto. The salmon was good, but nothing to rave about. It was just a filet pan-seared. The risotto was my absolute favorite. It was creamy, cheesy and the tomatoes were soft and juicy. By far, this restaurant and Grotto in Beacon Hill have good risotto. Some of the girls had skirt steak with parmesean frittes and truffled mayo and their own steak sauce. The skirt steak was a bit chewy, as with similar types of steaks. The fries were really good, especially when dunked into the mayo and steak sauce. For dessert we had a peach upside-down cake with ice cream. I don't think I'm a fan of peaches and I did have an allergic reaction to it once. My throat clogged up a bit because there were some fresh peaches in the ice cream. People tell me reactions can be caused mentally, but I felt it. Luckily there weren't a lot of fresh peaches and most of it was cooked w/the cake. Even that tasted alright. Service was alright but the wine person gave us a good bottle from New Zealand. I have yet to remember the name of it. I rate the food 8/10."},{"name":"Good Earth Coffee House","address":"2505 Alma Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I like this place, I have been here a few times recently but I find it annoying that constantly there are no seats to sit down as they have people with their computers occupying the spots for hours on end.

The food is extremely good, much better than you'd expect from a food truck.  The owners are extremely friendly. \\n Espadas de Brazil gets my highest recommendation.***\\n\\nI came across this food truck quite by accident while walking on campus, and I'm so glad I did.  The Gaucho plate for $14 is tremendous.  It's bottom and top sirloin; rice and black beans; and a salad.  Portion sizes are very generous. On a whim, I added a basket of fries for $5, not realizing it was an appetizer, not a side.  I couldn't believe how good they were, but it was not meant for only one person.  They're cut thick, crispy on the outside, and softer on the inside.  It was a big mistake on my part, because now my diet is in serious jeopardy.  Theoretically, I could sub the rice and beans for fries, but they're amazing rice and beans and a perfect compliment to the steak.  Tough choice.  When I ate at Espadas a second time, they added some sausage to the plate for me to try.  Really, really good stuff.  I didn't leave a scrap of food on my plate either time.\\n\\nLastly, let me talk about the \\"atmosphere.\\"  The owners are extremely friendly and will check on you to make sure you are happy.  You can tell they take a lot of pride in their food.  There are about 8-10 food trucks at the corner of 26th and Red River.  The tables are outdoors with limited cover, and I don't know how often they are cleaned.  They weren't \\"dirty\\" per se, but I did wonder.

It was served along with some homemade potato chips which were quite good and provided a nice complement to the fish. I then had the arugula salad, which was huge. Two people could have really split the duo and the salad and have been quite happy. For the main course I tried the Kobe bavett steak. This was an American Kobe cut and so didn't break the bank...it was excellent and perfectly done. My gf also had the Kobe but hers was not cooked properly (med rare instead of med) and the only reason I gave 4 stars was because it took our server a bit too long to come back and check on us to make sure everything was ok...once she did she took the beef back to be properly cooked.\\n\\nFor dessert I had the sorbet sampler, consisting of orange, coconut and raspberry sorbets.

The drive wasn't too bad - after all, I live in DC so traffic sucks there too.  However, the parking area left a lot to be desired.  The trick to this place is that there is restaurant parking in the back that is free.  If you must park in the paid lots, $3 doesn't seem too bad, but the panhandlers will tell you that there's parking in the back and follow you back there to heckle you for the \\"tip\\".  I finally relented to the aggressive approach and gave the guy a dollar and made it clear I wasn't going to entertain anymore cajoling.\\n\\nNow, once I got in, I was met with a bunch of folks standing around the register and attempting to get their names on the list.  I crept in and got mine on there - Porchi was working the front and fighting off the throngs of impatient customers wondering why there were so many empty tables.  Frankly,  I was too.\\n\\nEventually, Porchi was motivated enough to get the tables seated at her convenience.  After an older lady approached the counter, things sort of sped up (I would assume that she was the manager but she was just too friendly for that - perhaps members of the family who run the place?).  I was sat down and April came out quickly to get me a drink.\\n\\nHowever, by then, I already knew I wanted chicken and waffles and threw some mac and cheese and collard greens in with the mix.  I wasn't disappointed.  Overall - the fried chicken was like my grandmother's chicken - not too salty, fried to a crisp, and the batter tasted like a flour batter recipe rather than some sort of boxed commercial brand.\\n\\nNow, the music was a tad loud - I'm not one for music that is loud enough to overpower my thoughts.  But then again, the teenage girls sitting at the table next to me singing their hearts out probably was more of the problem than the speakers themselves.\\n\\nWould I do it again?  Maybe if I was with other folks in ATL who had never been.  However, if I'm back in town alone, I'd probably steer clear - I rarely wait more than 15 minutes to be seated at any restaurant and always prefer to use reservations so my impatient side isn't unnecessarily torqued - saves me and the restaurant staff a lot of headaches!"},{"name":"BIBIBOP Asian Grill","address":"1281 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I've meant to try Bibibop since they opened in Grandview.

That's the good news.  \\n\\nEverything was dried out and/or soggy.  When we finally found something palatable (fried shrimp) my boyfriend bit in and found a hair fried into the crust.  Barf! When I told the waitress she sent the manager over.  She picked at the shrimp for a few seconds, inspecting to see no doubt if we put it there and when she realized it was indeed a straight black hair matching everyone who works there she said...Thank you for letting me know I will go remove the tray.  As if I was telling her for their benefit.  She then turned and walked away.  I was in disbelief.  At that point my boyfriend decided to gorge himself on fruit. (the only safe thing to eat there).  A few minutes later the manager returned to say that it was probably a customers hair (yah right..it was in the middle of the crust) and that she would remove 25% off the bill.  25%?????  How about taking one of the meals off the bill?  Needless to say I stopped eating when the hair appeared.  As you can imagine there was no tip in their future.  \\n\\nOnce stuffed to the gills (on FRUIT!) my boyfriend placed money for the cost of the meal under the bill.  As we were headed for the door the waitress yelled across the restaurant to us.  DID YOU PAY???  Do I really need to go on with this story?  It was like a skit on SNL.

I was very confused because I've never ordered by the pound so I had to step out of line and ask an employee who broke it down: 2-3 ribs are about a half a pound. With the helpful tip I was ready to order and got the following : half pound of pork ribs , quarter pound of beef brisket , the el Sancho (10.75) sandwich which is a combination of beef brisket , sausage , pulled pork, red onions and pickles.

Things got off to a rocky start - we had to explicitly ask for water (this seems to be a trend with recently opened restaurants?) and both of our cocktails were cloyingly sludgy and sweet. I could barely taste the bourbon in my Bitter & Torn, I might as well have drank the liqueur straight - which incidentally wouldn't be a bad idea for the bar staff to do so they could get a sense of the proper proportions. Both this and my friend's Martell Sidecar went back for a beer and a glass of wine respectively, courtesy of our waitress who was very friendly and polite but clearly had not been trained to deal with complaints - when we told her about our drinks she seemed nervous and confused as to what she was supposed to do. I don't fault her at all, she just seemed like she was doing her best with what little she was given.\\n\\nThe food wasn't completely bad - the housemade sausage was great and the lamb tips that weren't overdone were pretty good. For my sides I got mashed potatoes which were what you'd expect and \\"mixed vegetables\\" which ended up actually being \\"just broccoli\\". My friend ordered BBQ chicken and turkey tips - which came out undercooked, pink and semi-translucent in the center - and asked for both of her sides to be mixed vegetables but got the same amount I did instead of giving her extra, essentially just giving her one side instead of two for the same price. We called the waitress over again who this time got her manager. When we told her about the undercooked chicken, she picked up the plate and said \\"let me fix this\\" and briskly walked off as if she was intentionally rushing off before we had a chance to say \\"too many things went wrong, we'd just like to leave\\".\\n\\nThis place does have potential - the menus good, the prices are reasonable, and the food that came out right was pretty decent. However, sloppy cooks (some overcooked lamb tips aren't the end of the world and I can overlook given the place is new and figuring stuff out, undercooked chicken is inexcusable), terrible drinks (were the bar staff trained at all on the cocktails?) and a waitstaff that hasn't been trained to deal with customer issues hold it back tremendously and make it hard to recommend."},{"name":"Ashley's Breakfast and Lunch","address":"916 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3.5","text":"Walked in and we were greeted by a non smiling person who seated us..no biggie if the food is good.

We chatted with the very knowledgeable bartender as he set up shop and slowly sipped their Mezcalina cocktail which offers delectable flavors derived from the smoky mezcal, sweet agave nectar and muddled basil & serrano chile.   What great mind came up with this drink?  So unique and yum!  That's no sweet margarita, for sure. \\n\\nMy starter was the Ceviche - what is not to love about a perfectly balanced offering of fish, cilantro and lime . . . . refreshing, light and satisfying.  My dining partner truly enjoyed the Caldo Tlapeno which was as tasty as it was beautiful.\\n\\nOn to the main course.  We shared dishes - our plates going back and forth across the table without regret.    We can highly recommend our selection - a mole and the cochinita pibil.  The moles at El Naranjo are traditional and exquisite - don't even think of chocolate chile - that's just not what a true Mexican mole is!  Expect beautiful flavors that only happen when fruity chiles and a variety of vegetables are simmered for hours or even days.  The pork was cooked to perfection.  Cochinita Pibil is a rare treat anywhere in the U.S., and here it is sumptuous - I wonder where the pit is !    \\n\\nI got so relaxed and excited that I forgot to even take photos, but the plate presentations were gorgeous. \\n\\nI truly respect this chef for sourcing many local and organic ingredients, and using only non-GMO Heirloom Corn from Mexico for the house made tortillas and corn-based dishes.  Supporting growers in Mexico means jobs at home for so many more now - that is a huge step forward.  \\n\\nWe do not live in Austin, but look forward to returning to eat at El Naranjo later this year.  \\n\\nFor the record, I feel the most negative reviews posted here are people who do not understand the true cuisine of interior Mexico.

FOOD\\nAccording to the server, two entrees really stand out: the Midnight Train (their version of chicken and waffles) and Smothered Chicken (chicken topped with gravy over rice). Being a first-timer, obviously, I had to get their chicken and waffles. (*Note: a flavored waffle can come with either bananas, pecans, or chocolate and will cost $1.50 more.) I also asked for their fried green tomatoes.\\n\\n*Fried Green Tomatoes: I would not recommend these. The batter falls off easily, and they don't have flavor. The sauce tastes like A Thousand Island Dressing. ($6.99)\\n\\n**Midnight Train: Slightly sweet, A-OK waffle with four pretty tasty fried chicken wings. (Fried chicken was tasty enough for me to burn the entire insides of my mouth.) I appreciated that they didn't over fry them, but I do wish they had some sort of kick. --The syrup, which sits on each table, was pretty basic. All-in-all, the Midnight Train is a solid meal, but not that quite memorable. ($13.50)\\n\\nII.

OTHER TIDBITS\\n-Park in the lot to the right of Gladys Night's. The restaurant rests in a tough part of Downtown (especially on Renaissance Parkway NE), so I would absolutely avoid driving down that road if possible. A security guard holds it down in that lot, and I felt more comfortable leaving my car there than on the street. And DO NOT GIVE YOUR MONEY TO ANYONE ON THE SIDEWALK! lol.

As a server myself, it seems unreasonable to not know what simple modifications your restaurant can do. Afterwards, the salmon came out raw and they had to make her a new dish. While this was all happening we weren't asked if we would like something else to snack on or if we would like another drink. We had to keep asking for things instead of being asked if we needed anything else or if everything was okay. The nail in the coffin was when our bill came and the suggested tips were all wrong. The 20% tip was actually a 25% tip! Very inappropriate.

I came here after my classmate highly recommended it. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I had a 8:15 reservation and called them and let them know we were coming late. We got there at 8:30 and we didn't get seated until 8:50, no big deal. They had a complimentary coat check which was nice, but everyone ends up tipping so be prepared for that.\\n\\nThe place is very \\"cute\\" - meaning cramped and narrow. We had the following dishes:\\n\\n- beef carpaccio: Thin slices of beef with capers, arugula, and Parmesan cheese. Pretty damn good. Everything was fresh and the flavors from each of the items really worked well together.\\n\\n- rabbit pasta: I'm a sucker for pappardelle pasta so I was amped to see this on the menu. The rabbit was slow-cooked and was great, but the noodles left me unsatisfied. The noodles were a little thicker and chewier than other places that I have been to.\\n\\n- veal shank: The veal was bread-crusted and crispy. My boyfriend and I don't generally like veal so it was very good considering this. However, nothing was really special.\\n\\nService: Great. The waiter was nice and our water glasses were never less than half filled. Our waiter did try to get us to go to Modern Pastry instead of Mike Pastry, I heard him say this to pretty  much every single customer.

We decided to take a walk and came back after an hour. After being seated for about 10 minutes we still hadn't received a menu and had to ask for one- which took another 5 minutes. I understand that it was busy, but the servers were more invested with seating people down rather than taking orders and I'd noticed a lot of people, including us, were getting impatient with the inconsistent service. We received our hot chocolates first($5 dark chocolate and a $9 champurrado)- which were decent, a little watery, nothing special. Midway through our drinks, our server asked us to move tables across the cafe because they had to seat a group which needed them to combine our table with the empty table next to us- we didn't mind too much- but it was a little disruptive since we had already gotten comfy with our seats & drinks. After moving tables, we got our milk chocolate fondue.

So last night was date night and I suggested Contigo as one of the places to go and well, she gladly and quickly took to the suggestion.  We decided to have 'dinner' here during Happy Hour and meet around 5:30.  Let's me say this, when I arrived at 5:30 the lot was not even half full and due to traffic she was running late and within that extra 10-15 minutes that lot filled up QUICKLY.  That said, we still had a nice table under the rooftoop. Wow, that's all I can say about this places ambiance.  No matter where you are, you're outdoors and if you're under the roof, they have built in heaters in the ceiling.  That's pretty effing cool!  We started out with cocktails and I tried their Sazerac, and BOY was it good! That thing went down SMOOTH.  We had quite a few of their bar snacks as well.  House made pickles, house roasted nuts, pigs in a blanket and 2 of the Ox tongue sliders.  I'm pretty sure there was nothing left of those snacks.  It was really nice to have finger foods to snack on while having our cocktails and chatting.  The nuts were SO good, the pickles were super tasty but a bit more acidic than I think either of us were expecting, not that it was bad though.  The pigs in a blanket were super good but once again, I guess we were both more accustomed to a lighter 'blanket' and the texture of theirs was more of a biscuit type feel.  I'd go on to assume that it's the same as their 'dumplings' for their rabbit and dumplings, at least that'd make sense to utilize the same ingredients for multiple dishes.  The ox tongue sliders were just MAGNIFICENT!  Jesus, as soon as the plate got sat down you could SMELL it and it smelled AMAZING.  We both ended up trying their signature cocktail for the evening which was \\"like a Manhattan but with apple brandy\\".  It was quite delicious as well.  We ended up splitting the grilled cheese with fries.  That was just completely decadent as it's served on brioche and we added tomato and house made bacon.  Jeez.  That was definitely an experience.  I also want to add that the service was just great.

That is always a plus. I can't stress that enough, they are very very sweet.  Even the staff behind the bar, working hard at the grill are smiling and waving. This brightens up one's day.\\n\\nSadly, online ordering issues still remain and the price has always been different at the register than what was shown online at the end of the order. So, if you get the emailers that feature discounts for online ordering, it seems you have to tell the staff you ordered online at pick up otherwise the price you are expected to pay is different from what you are told online. Maybe it's best to pay online/checkout (that is an option) and then pick up as a pre-paid customer. When taking group orders this can be frustrating so perhaps be prepared to wait just a few minutes while the staff sorts it out. It doesn't take long and they do adjust it.\\n\\nAlso, when it's crowded (i.e. lunch time/12noon) it is  not so easy to reach the express line for pick up orders. So be patient at this location.\\n\\nI do wish their breakfast menu was online so we could build our orders appropriately which helps with payments at pick up as well.

I've been to Two Chefs a handful of times now, and although the food is always reasonably good (and they make a mighty fine Ceasar!), my group and I pretty much always say we're never going to go back.  Why?  Because there's one server/host (possibly manager?) there who never fails to make us feel completely unwelcome and practically scolds us for doing something \\"wrong\\", pretty much every time we're there.\\n\\nToday we were standing outside waiting for our table (as it's a tiny restaurant, there's very little room to wait inside), and Mr. Condecending popped his head out the door and told us they were preparing a table for us.  I made a small movement towards the door, and he said in a stern tone, \\"STOP.  WAIT.  Did you SEE anyone come out yet??  You have to WAIT for other people to leave first\\".   I felt like I'd committed some huge mistake and should go sit in the corner or something.  Another time I was there, the same server was bringing us our food and was leaning across the table with a large plate which looked a little precarious, so i made a motion with my hands to offer to take it from him.  He immediately said \\"Whoa, NEVER do that!! NEVER EVER do that!\\".  I just put my hands in the air like I was being arrested, while the rest of my party looked at each other in a state of silent shock until he left our table.  \\n\\nMy friends have all had similar experiences, and while I can forgive someone having a bad day (and certainly wouldn't write a negative review based on one experience), we've pretty much just decided that he's a jerk all the time.  Comparisons have been made to the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld; I don't think I've ever seen him smile.  To be honest, every time I go I not-so-secretly hope that he's not going to be there.  Every other server in the place is completely wonderful, so it's a huge drag that I have such a negative impression of the place due to one person.  However, being constantly worried that I'm going to do something to annoy the server and be berated for it isn't my idea of an enjoyable experience, and I've thus decided that I won't be going to Two Chefs anymore."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place gives you vast quantity of food.. consider yourself warned.

One employee was on the phone, presumably taking an order, but there were other employees that probably could have said something. Not a huge deal, but still, I like friendly places.\\n\\nWe order the garlic knots with both the marinara and creamy gorgonzola sauce (paid extra for the additional sauce) and one of the pizza specials (The SXSW, I believe), plus drinks.\\n\\nAt the drink station, we discover the ice is out or not dispensing properly, so we mention it to the employee that is busing tables in the dining room. He tells us the machine was recently filled with ice, shrugs, and does nothing. Alright, who needs ice anyway? All I care about is the pizza and garlic knots I'm about to chow down on.\\n\\nOur garlic knots arrive with only the marinara sauce, so I walk to the counter to inquire about the extra sauce that we ordered (and paid for!). They hand me a sauce in a to-go container that is much smaller than the one that came with the order. I figure that is the size they charged for, but if I had known they would be different sizes, I would have liked to have chosen which one would be the \\"big\\" sauce. Oh well! Anyway, good thing we ordered extra sauce, because the \\"garlic knots\\" were really just flavorless pizza crust, with no hints of garlic to be found. Also, I'm pretty sure the creamy gorgonzola sauce was actually ranch, but at this point I just wanted to eat my pizza.\\n\\nAnd for the pizza... the sauce was so thin that the cheese and toppings just slid off every time you took a bite, so you end up eating your pizza deconstructed. The sauce also lacked much for flavor, which I should have known based on the marinara I had tried earlier. As for the crust, I left it behind, which if you knew me, says a lot. I tend to devour every last bit, but this crust just wasn't worth it and I don't even care about carb intake.\\n\\nOverall, I really did want to like this place, because the prices weren't bad and it's close by, but it just wasn't meant to be.

A woman I consider a reputable source. So when my sister friend oohed and ahhed about the food at Golden Krust, going on how how well seasoned it was with its tasty patties and jerk chicken, I knew I had to try it. I went there on Tuesday during lunchtime where a crowd of lunch patrons gathered in the restaurant. I did like that there was ample room for dining in if that was your preference. On to the food! I ordered a variety of patties (cheesy beef, spicy beef, chicken) with coco bread along with sides of jerk chicken, fry chicken and mixed vegetables. The patties and coco bread were not what I was accustomed to. I grew up on Lenny's Bakery (Blue Hill Avenue) fresh baked smooth savory patties sandwiched in between a generous piece of buttery coco bread. Lenny's could last for two meals. Golden Krust gave me a smallish crispy patty that reminded of the ones you buy in the frozen food section of your local supermarket. The filing minimal and tasteless. The accompanying piece of coco bread was English muffin sized, uncut lacking the bakery freshness of Lenny's. GK's fry chicken was tasty but a tad salty. The jerk chicken was dry with a spicy kick. It could be a hit or miss depending upon the diner's palate. The star was the mixed vegetables. A small $3 order generously filled a container with cabbage onions peas and carrots. GK's menu takes its working class clientele's wallets into consideration yet it may insult their taste buds. Especially those patrons who cook this cuisine in their homes. Not sure if I'll be thanking my sister friend for this one!"},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for the lunch deal with a couple of friends and it was definitely worth it!

The portion sizes are great especially for lunch, since there's so much chicken! The shrimp toast and sweet potato fries were good, lots of salt on the sweet potato fries. The chicken was good, not super crunchy, but not soggy. There's a sweet sauce to dip the chicken and the shrimp toast in. I love the Japanese udon, which comes with some vegetables (broccoli, peppers, and onions).

We were seated promptly, which was surprising to me at 8:30 in this neighborhood; but no complaints here. \\n\\nLet's start with the FOOD: \\nIt's wonderful Oaxacan fare--nothing really too spicy, nice earthy flavors, beautiful moles y chiles relleno, and wonderful seafood preparations. Our table started out with the day's special ceviche (tuna), then the excellent waiter brought out three salsas with more fresh chips and bread and butter. Although the butter had lime in it (bonus! what a wonderful idea!) we really didn't need the bread. I loved all three of the salsas; they included a tomatillo (the spiciest), escabeche (second-spiciest), and a very tasty, wish-I-had-buckets-of-the-stuff chili paste. This latter treat was a blend of nine different chiles, muddled with some canola oil. I would have loved to have stolen some of this glorious paste to add in to all of my soups for years to come. Asi perfecto! \\nFor our entrees the table had a range of menu items, including three of the different moles, the seafood soup, flank steak, and the chiles relleno. I had the traditional, oaxaqueno relleno. It reminded me of the first time I had this dish, some twenty years ago up in Hillsboro, Oregon. The dish had all of the familiar flavors, but was waaay elevated. I loved it. \\nWe were too stuffed for desserts (I was really bummed about this), but I swear I'll be back. Our group closed the place down on Thursday, which gave us time to chat up the chef and owner for a few minutes. This last convo was a bonus for me, because I found out that the chef knows the artist who is responsible for all of the glorious photographs that adorn the restaurant's walls (AMBIENCE). There is one photo in their main lobby that I Must Have.

Taj Palace (TP) had always been packed every time I drove by and it was closer than a few other places bookmarked, so my natural inclination was to see how it compared to other Indian restaurants -- namely in Toledo. Suffice it to say that the Indian Jewel of Toledo remains my top pick.\\n\\nTo start, the atmosphere of TP was simply outstanding. From the decor to the layout of the dining area, everything was meticulously arranged. Service was fast and friendly. Plates were cleared from our tables just moments after we had set our forks down.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the food, the buffet presentation was rather humble. The dishes were rather standard -- nothing phenomenal, yet nothing unremarkable either. The chicken with mushrooms was the only notable offering, as the luscious curry sauce augmented the general juicy cubes of meat. The naan was just as excellent. Layered with a texture similar to croissants, I happily dipped the not-so-flat breads in the aforementioned curry sauce.\\n\\nNow for the low points of lunch. The dhania chutney. A complete insult to the most popular chutney in Indian restaurants everywhere. Sure, it was green, and I could detect hints of cilantro, but the sour taste was overpowering to the point where it could no longer be paired with the naan. The chicken tandoori was an utter letdown, since it had been grilled to the point where absolutely no tenderness could be tasted. Spice-wise, it had the perfect blend of ingredients. \\n\\nThe redeeming factor to the so-so meal was the spectacular gulab jamun -- a dessert I like to refer to as warm cheese donuts floating in a sea of warm syrup.

I like the atmosphere quite a bit. \\n\\nThe food is your typical pub food with wings, burgers, sandwiches and the like - they do serve tater-tots if that's your starch of choice and I thought the onion rings quite good. I've had the Reuben Sandwich which I thought good if not great. Don't bother with the fish and chips - it's cod but the tail cut which really should never be used (tough and curled). We sent this back twice. I think Local 7 is really more about the atmosphere and the craft beer selection. I've enjoyed a really nice Boulevard Coffee Stout. The specials on tap seems to change fairly frequently with a bunch of fixed brands. The bottle list is above average for a place this size with lots of variety and some fine craft beer represented.\\n\\nI've also managed to try a dessert here, a German chocolate cake which was good but not great (a bit dry and frozen). Stick with the beer and the basics and I think you'll be happy. \\n\\nThe service I've experienced has been quite good. The other patrons for the most part seem to ignore you if you don't know them but there's at least a bit of diversity as you scan around so, while you may not be part of the recognized local crowd, you don't get the attitude you might while visiting a downtown Atlanta pub. One thing that's a little weird is that the bathrooms are shared with the building so you exist the back (there's a common hallway) to use the facilities - efficient but a bit odd. I like this pub a lot and plan to visit more regularly.\\n\\n(also posted to my food blog)"},{"name":"Cafe Maddie","address":"895 Quincy Shore Dr","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Tasty, simple food made with love and at a great price!

Unlike one of my favorite burger joints, Mighty Fine, I didn't feel like I was necessarily eating the top quality organic ingredients. The condiments weren't gross at all, I just didn't feel like I was eating one of the more healthy burgers - if such a thing is possible.\\n\\nAnd the fries I had heard such horrible reviews on? I enjoyed them as well. I even liked that they were thrown into a cup with a large about of bonus fries hanging out in my brown bag. The one issue I will point out with the fries is more around the condiments supplied by the establishment. The fries, which more like a homestyle or steak fry, were good solo or with ketchup. They however were not good with the malt vinegar. I'm a huge malt vinegar fan and have even had fries that way, but for me, the texture and flavor just wasn't right for that mixture.\\n\\nWith all of that said, I really enjoyed the burger and fries here.

Living in far south Austin, we make the twenty minute trek to this location and have done so for a few years. Food and service are consistently good.  My only ugly with this restaurant is their bathrooms.  When they built this newer location, they used small tiles on the floors with wide grout lines so all the dirt and grime gets caked into the grout. To cut costs they used residential doors instead of commercial; doors with primer that were never painted and desperately need a coat of paint. The door handles (also for residential use) in the mens and women's are both broken ( the mens room has been broken for two years!)  The Mirrors, paper towel dispensers usually broken or missing altogether. The walls, stalls and baseboards are/look/feel filthy and the worst of it is the restrooms typically have a  rancid odor of a moldy bleach mop.

I have dined here twice hoping that coming at a slower time would be better. \\n\\nThe name is deceptive in that their beer list is just okay but priced as such as well as their scotch/whiskey list. The beer glasses are not chilled and I could tell that the new lines for the beer did not have the proper chilled beer temperature. I'm not too big into whiskey but I was surprised that their cocktail list did not have very many hopeful \\"smashed\\" concoctions. Honestly, all of their cocktails were just knock-offs of the greater Boston area generals; nothing original except their Hops 'N Scotch which was just okay; they picked some cheap stuff like Magic Hat #9, Dewers, orange bitters, and chartreuse and said, let's charge people $10 for this \\"original\\" cocktail. Their wine list holds some great winemakers but none of their signature grape varietals. \\n \\nI have been here twice and each time was more disappointing than satisfying. Their servers are awkward, incompetent, and more into themselves than making money. Working at a dive bar means learning about the actual drinks and food and being able to make recommendations. Lack of people skills and common courtesy. \\n\\nAs outrageous as it sounds, when we received our tab and wanted to pay, the waitress literally just assumed that \\"all set\\" meant \\"keep the change.\\" First and foremost, do NOT just assume that you earned a 29% tip because the rule of thumb is just getting the change for the guest and NOT asking if they need change. JUST GET THE EFFING CHANGE. We got food that we wanted to share and the server didn't give us linens, B&B's or silverware, but TWO spoons even though there were THREE of us. In the end, I was put in a really embarrassing position and just didn't want to ask for the change because that will make the server give even more annoyed looks even though she was already eying us to get out after last call. \\n\\nThe food was just alright. The first time, we ordered fried green tomatoes which were seasoned well but overcooked and very thinly sliced, the mac and cheese which was NOT served with a spoon considering that the sauce sat at the bottom of the skillet presentation thus leaving dried noodles on top, and the summer risotto which had undercooked risotto, crunchy green beans, MINCED obscure vegetables, and fried French onions as a garnish ( NOT WORTH $20 at all). The desert was good which was apparently the chef's grandmother's recipe: phyllo pastry with a green apple filling and a caramel drizzle with a possible hint of rum. \\n\\nThis evening we got the grilled cheese with the red onion jam which was unique and really tasty flavors. The late night menu had a variety of items crossed off or 86'd and I felt like the prices were misleading. The gazpacho was not very chilled (I've had much better salsa that was complimentary) and the house made potato chips were greasy. The cheese on the sandwich was not in normal cheese form but it was messy and yummy. \\n\\nI've had the Adriatic Sea drink twice and it suits my need of St. Germain but it seems to be missing more flavor, possibly a floral aromatic bitter or something more interesting. If I am ever depressed and want to be put in a suicidal mood, I'll come in here and order a random bourbon on the rocks just to confuse the server. They do have some great whiskeys of a variety of ages on the menu but I was perplexed as to why the majority of the patrons chose wine or a cocktail over the title of the establishment. \\n\\nAll in all, the beers are graciously priced, the cocktails are atrociously boring, and the food is overly priced. Coolidge Corner should ask them to relocate to Central Square in Cambridge where a high alcoholism rate with low quality food control is welcomed. \\n\\nDisappointed, and won't come back until a year later when they will hopefully get their crap together and possibly stay opened for that long. Stick to the Regale Beagle. \\n\\nP.S. Super awesome that the hostess was sipping on a unhidden beer and surprised there were customers coming in on a Saturday night .

I was here twice today.\\n\\nThis is the first branch of this cheese shop/quick casual eatery outside their home area of South Florida. Most of the people on the premises today were from the FL locations. They were all super friendly, informative and attentive.\\n\\nOn my first visit, I browsed the large selection of cheeses, imported as well as US artisanals, including local Haystack.  Though most of what I saw is available in a variety of places in Boulder already, they do have them nicely grouped and available to taste. Some were selections from brands I see regularly, but slightly different offerings from those companies. I plan to get a few to try soon. I did get some biscotti thins in a less common flavor than I usually find. The prices seemed a little high on the retail options compared to similar items elsewhere in Boulder.\\n\\nMy husband and I went back for a light supper. I had the brie melt (though they list it as \\"grilled\\" it isn't) and it is better this way. I got the added serrano ham option with the cornichons on the side and an iced tea. My husband had the roast beef with blue  cheese spread and veggies. Both were on white baguette, though there is a whole wheat option too. They are the only bread I saw. They have several salad and soup options and combos with a half sandwich. We each had a cookie for dessert. The prices seemed comparable to other sandwich shops in town. We need to try more, though both of these were very good. Everything was very fresh which was to be expected for the 3rd day open. \\n\\nI hope they can maintain the quality. That's always an issue for fast casual eateries in Boulder. They do not yet have their beer/wine license but expect it by spring. And the outdoor patio deck is built though not weather appropriate yet. The location is a little awkward especially for locals as the front and rear doors are reversed from the previous tenant of the space.

I wanted potato salad as a side, they had none, nor any macaroni salad or fresh fruit. All sandwiches come with a side of chips, they were so overcooked and way too salty.  The only desserts available was chocolate cake and key lime pie, and both looked like they had been sitting there for a few days. They had no brownies, lemon bars or carrot cake.  There were only a few customers who came in for lunch, when in the past it was quite busy. I think that if you are going into the deli business, you should at least have the items available on your menu. I was there at noon, not in the late afternoon!

I'm usually picky about noodles and I know there's many different types of ramen noodles out there. Luckily, Hanabi served the noodles just the way I like it, with a medium firmness and a slight chewiness. The third item that makes this such a great meal was the cashu.

The burger patties were so undercooked that the centers, in addition to being bright red, were not even hot.  The bun was terrible, store-bought variety, and crumbled in my hands as I tried to eat the burger.  They have no idea what \\"Jalape√±o burger\\" means -- they put freshly slice, un-grilled, unpickled Jalape√±os on a burger.  There's a reason that every other Jalape√±o you've ever had is either pickled, roasted or grilled.  Oh, and the first fountain drink I tried was flat.

It honestly depends on what time to you to ANY restaurant. Go during peak hours, expect it to be busy. If it's not busy, then there is something wrong with the place. \\n\\nFirst of all, if you're a scotch person, I highly recommend that you go there! If you have never had a Macallan with an ice sphere, then you're missing out.

One word I would describe it, AMAZING. Never had I had something go delicious that I would go back for it again two days after.

They're more than happy to refill the sides for you if you need anything, but I wasn't reallyfeeling the sides to be asking for more. \\n\\nBeing one of the very few Korean restaurants in Orlando, it's logical to be expecting the prices to be on the higher side. Sure, you CAN go out and buy pork belly, slice it thinly and grill it at home. You'll actually probably enjoy it more (IMO) because you're smart, and will go get good quality banchan (or Homemade!) to eat with your meat. However, like most people these days, nobody has time to prep everything and get a grill going. .etc etc. Shin Jung is for the experience and good ole meat. \\n\\nOh another note, I have tried their Kimchi Chiigae (Kimchi stew) and Soondubu (Dofu soup) and both were kind of ''interesting'' tasting to me. I believe way overly ripen kimchi and too much sesame oil. It's not my cup of tea, but you should try it out because maybe you'll enjoy the flavor!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite part of Salty Sow was the vegetable garden outside.

We were promptly sat and immediately had our orders taken.  Drinks come out, tempura appetizer comes out...cool, no problems.....\\n\\n....and then....nothing.  Nobody picks up our appetizer plates.  Nobody refills our water. Meanwhile, other customers begin to steadily trickle in.  By 5:30, the place is practically full and we are still waiting on our 2 sushi rolls while the table next to us is having their multiple platters of sushi and rolls dropped off.  I get up up to go to the bathroom and notice the entire row of booths that all came in a long time after us are all eating sushi and we are still waiting on our entrees!  We called out for our and he went to go find what's up in the kitchen and he comes back to tell us the kitchen lost our ticket but they are remaking it (way to throw your kitchen staff under the bus...) and we wait, and we wait, and then all the sudden a platter of 2 rolls are brought out and it's a dynamite roll and a philly roll and I'm like,\\"uh...we ordered a spider roll and a dynamite roll\\" so they take the food back, and we wait and we wait, and by this point we are getting kinda frustrated and I've honestly lost my appetite at this point and don't really want to be there anymore.   My mom went to the hostess and asked for our server to come back cuz we hadn't seen him in so long.\\n\\nFinally, he brings out the spider roll that my mom ordered (on a chipped plate mind you) but didn't bring out my dynamite roll.  He noted at this time he'd let the manager know and apologized for the problems this evening, and said he'd ask her to stop by the table. So we sit and wait some more.  Then our server came out with a giant platter of tempura rolls that he claimed were complimentary of the house and honestly, I appreciate the gesture but neither of us wanted it. We had just eaten tempura as an appetizer. My mom just ate her spider rolls. I just wanted my dynamite rolls. What am I gonna do with a giant plate of tempura rolls?  I honestly wondered if someone had accidentally duplicated an order of tempura rolls and if management or the kitchen thought,\\"meh, here, give them this and tell them it's compliments of the house....\\"\\n\\nWELL, AN HOUR AFTER WE INITIALLY SAT AS THE ONLY PEOPPE IN THE RESTAURANT AND AFTER MY MOM ALREADY EATEN (the CAPS are for emphasis, not \\"yelling\\" btw) I get my dynamite roll. And I ate it unenthusiastically and somewhat reluctantly.  And then our server brought the check.  He apologized again and my mom said,\\"ya, it's disappointing...we come here a lot....\\" And he replied something like,\\"ya, and it's my first day too...\\"  And now I felt kinda sorry for him. I am a former restaurant manager at Walt Disney World AND have worked in Japanese sushi and hibachi restaurants, and I am STILL in the food and beverage industry, so I suddenly felt empathetic to the server. Ya, we felt neglected and he should have communicated with us more and thought better of delivering tempura rolls but it was the kid's first day, and I know how challenging it is to be a server, and how intimidating and overwhelming the first day as a restaurant server can be, and downright scary it can be to approach the kitchen or the chef, and being freaked out because now you're in the weeds....\\n\\nSo now I am disappointed not in my server but management. Why did the manager never come over?  Why did they ignore us? Why are they tossing complimentary sushi we didn't want in an effort to appease us when all we wanted was an actual apology? \\n\\nAnyway, to reiterate the point I was trying to make earlier in this super long review, Hanabi WAS my favorite Japanese restaurant but has left a really bad taste in my mouth....not sure I'll be back."},{"name":"Caribbean One Stop","address":"2117 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Best vegetarian patties anywhere!!!  \\nSorry to say this, but even better than the vegetarian patties I get in JA...\\n\\nI wish she could mail me some!

I found the 'que to be very delicious, tender, but a bit on the fatty side. \\n\\nI enjoyed a few Lone Star keg beers free of charge while waiting in line. The 30-minute wait offered ample time to prepare for a meat onslaught and figure out what we wanted to indulge in. The crowd seemed to be a majority of out-of-towners and college folks. I'm no local so it could be a misjudge of patrons. Either way people were enjoying themselves and the slowly smoked goodness in the Texas heat.\\n\\nWe settled on an array of brisket, beef rib, hot links, and potato salad. Thick bark, great smoke, and super tender. But I have to dwell on the fattiness of the brisket and beef rib. Perhaps it was a misstep on our part and we should've ordered on the lean side. My beef rib was about half edible meat and a bit steep on price at around $20 per pound for the amount I enjoyed.\\n\\nA comment in passing, \\"Yeah, college kids can't really afford to eat here\\" when getting ID'd I knew to get my wallet ready (and turned out to be a $60 lunch for two).

Everyone sitting in the heated outdoor patio were smoking.  Smoking something that I know as \\"hookah\\".  It smelled sweet but I didn't know if I wanted to try it.\\n\\nThe menu was a little daunting since there were so many things to choose from and we had never had most of them before.  But we chose a few things and these were our likes and dislikes.\\n\\nDish#1: hummus with beef strips\\nSPECTACULAR!  The hummus was so smooth and the beef strips were marinated with something that made it extra tasty.\\n\\nDish#1A: pita bread\\nThe pita bread is cool.  It's puffy!  Went very well with the hummus.\\n\\nDish #2 meat pies\\nThese were only so-so.  It was like a little meat patty stuffed into a doughy square of bread.  It didn't tingle my taste buds.\\n\\nDish #3 Meatballs in a yogurt sauce\\nThe yogurt sauce was kind of tangy and it's good for the first few minutes but then becomes a little overwhelming.  The meatballs seemed like they were fried first and then drenched with the yogurt sauce.  The meatballs had interesting contents, like pine nuts.  It was served with rice and was okay.\\n\\nDish #4 Combo kabobs\\nThis is a good dish to try all their kabobs (lamb, beef, and chicken).  Lots of veggies on the plate but a little undercooked.\\n\\nWe gave in and decided to try the \\"hookah\\" and also try Turkish coffee.  The hookah smelled nice and had a nice light flavor.  The curator of all the hookahs says it was sweet apple.  With the bitter coffee, the taste of the smoke was even sweeter.  It was fun playing with the smoke.\\n\\nBut now I come to find out that the hookah is filled with tobacco, fruit pulp, and other herbs.  Tobacco isn't good for you so no more of that for me.\\n\\nThe service was okay.  They tolerated our ignorance about the cuisine :)  The hookah guy was especially attentive with refilling our hot coals and making sure everything was okay.\\n\\nI could go for that hummus again.. mmmhhmm..."},{"name":"Dough Boys Pizzeria","address":"10 E Main St","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"Tried Dough Boys for the first time tonight.

Pretty much a crab rangoon but swap the crab for buffalo chicken dip. It doesn't have any chicken in it( at least our order didnt) and it comes with blue cheese to dip. While they were very good, $10 for 5 of them wasn't worth it. Its an app and a small one at that. Don't really get bang for your buck with those, IMO. Thank God there was only 2 of us, otherwise if you're in a group you're lucky to get just one. So while they were tasty and different, for $10 we will get apps that have more to them.\\n\\nFor the meal I got the fish and chips. I asked our waitress how it was and she said its fresh local fish so I decided to go with it. It comes with fries and 'onion rings' which aren't typical onions rings.

Be aware that, while the Los Huevos selections are reasonably priced, the Los Guisados and De Ma√Æz selections are considerably higher.

Boston is lacking in Mexican food and this is a good example. \\n\\nIn terms of the setting. We sat outside after waiting for 20 minutes. The tables had not been cleared off around us for over 30 minutes. Seagulls were flying into the tables and pulling food off every dish. I understand seagulls are hard to manage, but if the food hadn't been sitting for so long maybe the seagulls wouldn't have come flying in. \\n\\nI ordered the nachos appetizer and added chicken. There was no chicken anywhere. I just ate them because I didn't want to be a pain and chicken didn't have a huge impact on my decision. When I told the waiter when he came back there was no chicken he did not believe me. He got very sassy and told me I shouldn't have expected a chicken breast sitting on top or anything. He came back again and asked if it was shredded in the nachos - which is was not. The only reason I told him was because it was a 3$ surcharge for chicken and I didn't want to pay that. He thought I was lying so I could have eaten the whole meal and not pay for it at all. Even though I told him I just wanted to surcharge off he got very sassy and walked away. He eventually took the charge off which was very nice but I had tried to explain I wasn't trying to lie and take he food for free but he was so awkward and sassy he didn't listen in the first place. \\n\\nThe food was ok. The nachos were three big hard tortillas with food in between and on top that the waitress crushed in front of you. The table did get rice and beans for the table that was pretty good.

Be prepared to wait at least 30min - 1 hr during busy dinner time.  Make sure to call ahead.   It's not a place to come if you have very little patience, expected to be served immediately,  and/or eating within 15min of ordering.  I know, how 'un-Asian' of them.  But you will soon realize how rewarding  your experience could be as soon as you take that first whiff of someone's dish leaving the kitchen.  That aromatic trail leaves you blinded and thirty min wait time doesn't sound so bad...  But, snack a little so your diva doesn't come uninvited.  \\n\\nMy staple dishes: Hot wings, Papaya Salad, and Drunken noodles.  \\n  Wings: come in four pieces all together, dry battered placed on top of sweet/spicy/garlicky sauce, and served with pickled radish and carrot sticks.  I love how simple it is but executed perfectly.  Wings are warm and crunchy with perfect amount of sauce  you can 'dip'.  It makes my mouth water just thinking about this.  Let me just preface by saying these are no where close to Pok Pok's famous wings.  If you gotta have PP's, you just gotta go there.  But this is a good alternative on the West side and different enough that I think it deserves its own shout out.   \\n   Papaya Salad: I usually order this at every thai restaurant.  I think it's really personal dish as some may prefer salty, spicy, or sweet, or sour than other.  For me, sweetness is overpowering and lacks sour/Limey note in the flavor profile.  A little downer... But to finish on a high note,\\n   Drunken Noodle (Pad Kee Mao):  Better than most places I've tried.  Some might consider this dish little dry as you don't see extra sauce 'dripping'.   However, I appreciate the sauce/noodle/veggies ratio.    Flavor of the sauce is balanced.  Noodles are perfectly cooked EVERY time.  You don't see broken pieces (which a lot of places over cook) and no dry spots!  \\n\\nHappy Hour:  If dinner is too much of a commitment for you try their HH.  They have pretty large selection to choose from.  My favorite HH is on Sundays because it's ALL day!  However, be aware that it's only available in their bar area.  There is a wait list (during busy hours/Sundays) and they will ask you to check with the host before you get too comfortable, if you decide to seat yourself.  \\n\\nNow, go find your own favorites and let your taste bud do the talking.  :) Have fun!"},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"It was my first time coming here!

Served with banana butter (replacement for butter) and a small pitcher of maple syrup. There is the option to get low-gluten, but I don't see why you would do that since the texture/consistency of the pancake would be compromised. \\n\\nDavis Sq Burger: Got it with the black bean patty. AND DELIC! The burger has sliced green apples to give it a good crunch with a sweet potato paste that gives the burger a strong and good flavor. The patty itself doesn't taste like meat, but the consistency of the patty is pretty close to a meat patty.

You would think a rack or half rack of ribs would always be the same size no matter where you go (whether they are spare's or baby-backs) but I have found out that not all racks are created equal for some reason. Anyways, I got my moneys worth here. The ribs had a bit of a crust on them too, which I liked and hadn't seen in some of the other places that I have been to in this area.\\n\\nFor a side, I had the potato salad and I thought it was good.

The mains are really good, but we preferred the apps and desserts, so we focused more on that after that first time. However, you really can't go wrong. I will say I would be more likely to go on a cooler evening when it would be ok to sit outside since inside can fill up pretty quickly and can get pretty warm. So on a warm night, warm inside and warm outside. However, my mom, who is more likely to be cold than warm, doesn't see this as a problem, so it may just be your preference. \\n\\nThis may have changed, but we've even made reservation and then received an outdoor table, which was not ideal for us.

I'm a fan, as for what they do, I am a fan. \\nOf course, Domino's does not produce 4 star food and the service pretty much comes down to how fast they deliver and if the food is hot and well cooked but, again, for what they do, they do it pretty damn well.\\nPersonally I am an Antico Pizza guy when I want great pizza but sometimes you just want to be lazy, watch some football and have somebody bring you a pizza and some wings without having to leave the home. And no, Antico Pizza does not travel well, it has to be fresh out of the oven.\\nI think you have to grade fast food delivery on a scale unlike fine dining where if I pay top dollar you need to get everything right like 98% of the time.\\nI think many reviewers are pretty harsh, they have one bad experience and then they give 1 or 2 stars, often I think because they are hoping they will get something for free. I also think you have to grade fast food delivery places not only a scale but over many visits to get a fair rating. Or leave a bad rating but back it up by never giving them your business ever again.\\nI especially HATE the people that have an issue and expect everything to be free (the pizza was under-cooked so I expect not to pay or tip for the pizza, the wings, the 2-liter, etc., those people are a waste of space on our planet). \\nWho do I hate even more? The people that do not like the food and expect to not pay for it. People that is not how it works, if you do not like the food you do not go back, you never give them your money again, but it does not mean you get it for free as someone else may love what you hate. \\nOne more, you know who I hate even more that this, and this is outside of food, but I am in the mood to Yelp rant? People who watch a movie in a theater and then want their money back because they did not like the movie. Those people, truly, I hate that they breathe the oxygen our planet produces.\\nBack to Domino's. Have I ever had delivery issues, sure, it happens, people do not show up for work or they get more business than they could have ever expected for a multitude of reasons but that rarely happens and usually I get pretty fast delivery. In fact, usually very fast as I live downtown on Peachtree and its a pretty straight, quick shot (that is what she said) down Spring Street for the driver.\\nI used to think Domino's was the worst but since they upgraded the menu a few years ago I now think Domino's makes the best pizza of the franchise fast food delivery operations. I must point out that I only eat the wings out of habit, I want pizza and wings when delivered, but the wings are still below average. If you want just wings and you have never had them from Domino's, do not waste your money, there are many other places that can deliver you much better wings. You simply can not bake a great or even average wing, it has to be fried."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"Just adding my voice to the other 5-star reviews out there.

We had both ordered specialties so you'd think there would be two bowls of rice, and it would have been nice to get our food all at once. My food was decent, no complaints really. My boyfriend did bite into a chunk of curry paste though. Not mixed in or anything, just a big glob of spicy paste. On the bright side, he said it helped clear his sinuses. \\nAfter dinner we were catching a movie since Cinetopia is right there (the whole reason we were even eating here to be honest)  so I asked for the check. The second our check was brought to us, my boyfriend handed them his card so we could pay and leave quickly. But they didn't bring his card back for another 3 or 4 minutes. The guy that took the card walked past us twice but never handed it back to us. So we had to wait some more. \\nWe were a couple minutes late to the movie because of all the waiting. We chalked this up to an experience and will not be returning. But if you're not in any hurry and already know what you like about Thai food (we have never eaten Thai before), then you might enjoy it a bit more."},{"name":"Your Mom's Burger Bar","address":"1701 E Cesar Chavez St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I wanted to like Your Mom's. It's a visible yet small dive burger joint tucked away in East Austin. The parking lot is cramped but there's plenty of parking on the street. The people who go there look like people who know what a good burger is. But after my first trip, I couldn't say I would go back again. First of all, don't expect a pristine clean restaurant. That shouldn't make you turn away because you can definitely sit inside, but the majority of tables and seating are either outside or outdoors with a mesh screen. This is Texas and it gets hot, so be prepared to feel the heat. \\n\\nI ordered the Robert De Niro. And while it was really tasty, it just didn't wow me. I'll have to go back and get a more traditional burger so that I can compare it to others but that may have been a 3.5 star burger with .5 added for creativity. I was really disappointed with the fries. They were flimsy as if they were cooked in oil that wasn't hot enough, plus there was little to no seasoning. I do not like eating french fries with ketchup but I had to with these. The ketchup tasted a little off, maybe because the are sitting in 90+ degree heat all day. My friend did order the onion rings and those were crispy and delicious but it shouldn't be hard to make fries the same without batter. \\n\\nDespite seeing how dive-y the restaurant portion was, I decided to venture to the restroom. I expected it to be dirty which didn't bother me but there was no soap in the bathroom. And then I started to notice what else was missing or off about the restaurant. There were no forks in the utensil boxes and less than 5 spoons and knives. I was standing at the counter for about 30 seconds until the guy turned around from talking to the chef and asked if I needed anything. There were skewers and bottle caps on the table we went to before I cleared it off (I get you're supposed to bus yourself but it's also not that hard to look over and see if anything needs cleaning.) The ketchup originally on our table had about 2 servings left and we had to take one from another table. Sure alot of this can be alleviated if we alerted the staff, but you have to take some responsibility to notice things.\\n\\nWith so many burger joints all over Austin, I can't say that I want to go to Your Mom's again, but I will probably give them one more try just to see if I had an off experience."},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"155 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I was drawn to rosa Mexicano because of its 25 dollar three course dinner deal, and the promise of table-side guacamole being made from fresh avocado. \\n\\nFirstly, the spectacle of guacamole making was certainly fun to watch but the guacamole itself came out so salty that we almost couldn't eat it. The server obviously didn't taste the guacamole he made and it made a really negative impression for a first course.\\n\\nMy friend had to add money for her salmon (which was quite good) but my short ribs fell below my expectations and my friend ordered the three quesadillas which tasted like they'd been frozen and simply reheated, with that kind of strange texture. \\n\\nThe dessert churros were good, but you can't really go wrong with churros.

An accomplished musician with Platinum records and Grammy Awards in her career, can she translate her success from the music industry into the restaurant business?\\n\\nWell, there are two other locations in the metro area so it is obviously doing well. Her son is actually the one that is running the operations. The restaurant has come to be a tourist spot of sorts. People are willing to wait in the bone-chilling cold for up to two hours to try some of this food. Fortunately for me, I was told that my wait time would be 40 minutes on a Sunday morning. In reality it was about 55 minutes. \\n\\nThe restaurant is located in a sketchy area of Midtown about a block away from where all of the homeless people live and congregate (and there are lots of them). I definitely would not be waiting outdoors at night just to eat here, but in the daytime it is safe. There are three places where you can park. You can park either directly behind the restaurant off of Courtland Street for free, or you can pay to park in one of two lots that are adjacent to the building. I recommend paying to park as one of the homeless people could potentially break into your ride if you parked behind the restaurant. Also, the lots has someone watching as well.\\n\\nAs a native Georgian, I of course had better soul food meals but this place is not bad at all. I ordered the smothered chicken with rice and gravy, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, cornbread muffin, and a signature waffle. My food came out surprisingly fast (less than ten minutes). The entire meal was delicious in my book. Some of the best mac and cheese I've ever had and that is including my Grandmother's (R.I.P.) homemade one. Again, not the best soul food that I had but based on my initial dish here I'd say it is up there. Customer service is pretty good. The waitress checked on me a few times to see if everything was okay with my meal.\\n\\nOverall, I'm impressed. Is it worth waiting over an hour in the cold for? Considering many other chicken and soul food joints in Atlanta, probably not. However, the food is splendid although it is a tad bit pricier in comparison to other chicken and soul food joints. I really question the validity of some of these reviews in regards to this restaurant but hey, you can't please everybody. I recommend coming here if isn't too busy."},{"name":"Barrio Cantina","address":"1363 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Attention non-meat-eating folks:  Ten Cuidado, (or in English, Take Care) because this it the only restaurant that I've been to in the last 10 years that put meat in something that I specified not have meat, then I ate it.  [shudder, flesh of swine in my mouth, PUKE]\\n\\nLet me start out by saying that this star rating would have been waaaaay worse if two manager-types didn't come back to rescue a meal gone bad.\\n\\nSo I came here with a friend on a Friday since I noticed it changed from Happy's to a a Mexican-type place.  Since Happy's never looked remotely appealing, and I like Mexican food, I was interested.\\n\\nI checked their FB page and it said that there were samples of Patron from 6 to 8.  So my friend and I walk over there and sit at 1 seat at the bar that was free.  \\n\\nWe were trying to talk to the bar staff to figure out more about these \\"Patron Samples.\\"  One person said they weren't until much later.  Another person said they didn't know anything about it.  So I pulled up the FB page on my phone that said Patron samples 6-8, and then someone said they weren't there yet.  Oh, I didn't realize this was a promo thing.\\n\\nSo anyhow, we order a few drinks.  After 10 minutes, I realize everyone has chips and salsa at their place setting... yet we had nothing.  So, I went through that moment of \\"I don't want to sound like a cheap loser asking for some free chips and salsa, but in theory, I assume that the free chips and salsa is built into the fact that my Kettle Soda costs $10\\".  So I asked.  They brought us some.  Hrmm.. AWKWARD.\\n\\nBut the salsa was excellent.\\n\\nI ordered a tortilla salad without bacon or cheese or any other dairy.  I said \\"Without bacon or dairy\\" two times.  My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla.  \\n\\nWhen my salad came, I of course started to eat it, in the the dimly lit setting of a Friday night bar.  I then realize I'm chewing on a huge hunk of bacon that I couldn't distinguish as bacon in a salad full of field greens.  Now, as a vegan who suddenly realizes she's eating the flesh of a dead pig and hasn't had meat in her mouth for 20 years, this is disgusting.\\n\\nI flagged the waitress over, and told her there was bacon in my salad.  She did the requisite apology, took it away, and came back about 5 minutes later with a new salad without bacon.  The salad was quite good, with a nice vinaigrette and some guacamole on top.  Good portion.  My friend said his small chicken quesadilla was good too.\\n\\nLater in the evening after we were done with our meals and drinking more drinks, the manager came over and apologized for the bacon in my salad, and removed it from our check.  I think she also gave us some free shot glasses to take home.\\n\\nThen later on, Michael Schlow himself stopped by an introduced himself which was cool.  He also apologized, and offered to buy us some drinks, which was awesome.  (It was less awesome when I realized he was buying everyone at the bar drinks, because the folks next to us didn't appear to have any issues and he bought them drinks too).\\n\\nAnyways, it was a good place.  Getting bacon in your salad and accidentally eating it when you're a vegan is disturbing, but accidents happen, I guess."},{"name":"Chez Dodo","address":"427 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Stumbled upon this food cart right before it closed for the day.

The Boudin was not flavorful and it just mushed into the flavors of the beef and did not stand out.

Did it have tasty appeal.. sure, the contrast of buns, tomatoes, lettuce, and sauce stood out.

Though there was a sign on the machine, patrons should have been told BEFORE we paid and sweated it out waiting\\n - all of the tables/chairs were sticky and not cleaned before or during our visit\\n - fly's need to be controlled better in a confined space like here\\n - air circulation should be better (only one fan was on and directed level across the ceiling) on an outdoor patio where you are trying to eat\\n - the fryer oil may need to be changed.. it seems that our fries were almost burned\\n\\n  I really am not a fan of giving bad reviews, I think my history shows it... but I tried to give Mom's a few chances and it did not appeal to me at all. \\n\\n  Will I go back? Only if someone insists it in my group...\\n  Will I try something different (if I do go back)? Sure, to give them a chance\\n  Am I going to recommend Mom's?

I went back to my table & hesitantly cut into my steak I had cooked on the Hibachi & found it purple inside. \\n\\nMyself nor my stepmother ate more than one bite, my dad finished his whole plate. We asked for the check & it came to around $45 for three people & three sodas. My stepmother kindly asked the waitress if she could take my stepmothers off the bill because she literally sat down with her plate, saw my food & refused to eat even a single bite. The waitress argued & said she saw us eat some food, but after some talking she went to her manager & came back having knocked $5 off the total bill. We left very displeased & will not be returning! \\n\\nIf you are looking for  great Hibachi I highly recommend the Hibachi buffet in Altamonte that is the plaza with Kohls! Really great food & have never had a bad experience here!"},{"name":"Sorento's Italian Gourmet","address":"86 Peterborough St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to this place twice, once for dinner and once for brunch.

This was probably the highlight of my meal, and it was only okay.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates and a salad. The dates were acceptable, but I'll eat anything wrapped in bacon. They really could've done with something more flavorful in the stuffing than pecans. My girlfriend's salad was gigantic-- definitely should've been an entree. It was good, though. She also enjoyed the salmon dish she ordered but did say her rice was undercooked and the sauce was full of sugar. \\n\\nMy pork tacos, however, were terrible. It was a bad cut of fatty, under-seasoned meat served with small, crumbling corn tortillas and a pile of undercooked rice. On the side came black beans (again, underseasoned), pico, about a Tablespoon of queso fresco, and what tasted like Trader Joe's guacamole (TJ's is across the street). The proportions were completely off-- I probably had about 7 tacos worth of pork and 3 tortillas. Everything was incredibly bland and couldn't be salvaged even by squeezing nearly a whole lime over it. Definitely not the gastropub experience I was desiring. \\n\\nThe service was slow, and our waitress never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks.

The Chicken was savory and crispy, the rice was a touch sticky, the Miso soup was perfectly simple, and the vegetables were unique. During our visit we ran into two issues. The first was the lack of staff. There weren't enough staff members to serve drinks and meals and it seemed as though things were getting confused. The second issue was the vegetable tempura.

These things made up the majority of the plate so it was clear to me that they used this as the 'filler' to make the plate look bigger and better than it really is.

Hands-down the best desserts in town, period.  And, it turns out they're all vegan.  Who would have guessed?  Their pastry chef can make vegan pudding, meringue, chocolate cream pie that would fool anyone, any time.  \\n\\nI keep going back for the sweet potato carrot cake with cream cheese frosting.  it's like the best possible combination of carrot cake and pumpkin bread, with a few shredded beets in it for awesome festive color.  There's even a garnish of beet slices arranged to look like rose petals!  If that sounds too weird, they have normal stuff like chocolate cake too, and really good cookies.\\n\\nThe staff is sooo friendly and it's clear people are really happy working there. Service is fast and the atmosphere is completely charming retro-diner.\\n\\nThis place is a total boon for vegetarians, a chance to have classic diner food without the meat. I brought a veggie friend here for his birthday and he was beyond delighted to have so many choices.  I'm an omnivore myself, and I think the food is great.  They're not trying to fool you into thinking you're eating meat -- they have their own twist on it using tofu, tempeh, etc. that is inspired by meat dishes, but actually works in a way that doesn't feel like fake food.\\n\\nAs for breakfast, their omelet concoctions are amazing.  They also have a \\"corned  beef hash\\" made from seitan chorizo that I haven't tried yet, but it's next on my list!\\n\\nOh -- and if you get addicted to their desserts like I have -- you can just walk in and buy them at the counter, any time.

I would say that the place was no more than a quarter filled. I informed the hostess that it would be me, my girlfriend, and my Son would be arriving shortly so I was requesting a table for 3. I was quickly informed by the hostess that I couldn't be seated until my third arrived. This place has more rules than a maximum security prison and this bogus policy just about sent me over the edge. My intent was to be seated and have a drink while I waited for my Son who was 10 minutes away. I could see if the restaurant was filled to capacity but there was nobody in the place. I've put up with their no substitution rule, their less than stellar service, and the extremely long time it takes for the food to arrive, not to mention the long wait for the check. I've been dining here for years but I think I've had enough. The shame is that their food, once it arrives is usually delicious and yesterday was no exception. The steak tip salad, steak tip dinner, Greek salad steak tip wrap and calamari was well above average. I just can't take their nonsensical, silly policies anymore and think I'm going to spend my dining dollars else where for a while. If they had let me be seated to wait for my Son I would have at least spent another $15.00 on drinks.

Albeit with nothing to compare it to, I think we picked the right spot - food and service were both solidly good and prices were ridiculously affordable with practically everything under $10.\\n\\nWe set out to fill a craving for my most favorite gluttonous Chinese dish, which usually goes by a name with some variation of \\"Prawns with Candied Walnuts\\". Here it was hidden away on the menu, I think called \\"Shrimp in Salad Dressing\\" or something unappealing-sounding like that. Tricky. It tasted a bit different than I'm used to, but you can't really mess up a dish this good. Accompanying broccoli was perfectly cooked and infinitely better swirled around in the dish's mayo goodness.\\n\\nWon ton soup was standard but did not disappoint. The salt and pepper pork chops, however, were awesome. And heaped on a plate higher than you could believe at a price tag of roughly nine bucks. I'm hungry just thinking about them.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm incredibly jealous that Beantown has the exact type of local, authentic Chinatown that DC lacks. This is real Chinese dining, as evidenced by a menu full of authenticity with a laundry list of foods exotic beyond my tastes... spicy duck web, cold jellyfish, fried pork intestine, garlic frog in pot, salted egg and mustard green soup and \\"fish gills with 8 delights\\" soup.

We found great reviews for The Peached Tortilla online, so we took off trying to locate it.\\n\\nOur only problem was finding the truck. It was located at 9606 N Motorpac Expy. We couldn't figure out where exactly that was, having never been to Austin before, until we had just about given up after over an hour of searching, when we happened to drive by it. Turns out the truck was located in front of the Google building.\\n\\nWe ordered the pimento cheese fries, a catfish taco, a beef brisket slider, two of the bahn mi tacos, and the nutella and banana wontons. We told the owner, Eric, that we were from out of town and we'd looked for the truck for over an hour, and he was super nice and gave us one of the cake pops they'd just started selling. He gave us a Maker's Mark cake pop, which was pretty cool because it's covered by a bright red icing coating, so it looks just like the wax on a Maker's Mark bottle. All of the food was delicious and I'd recommend any of it.\\n\\nI'd probably give The Peached Tortilla 5 stars if we'd had a better experience locating it. I'd suggest that they provide a phone number to call for directions (all you can do is message them via their website) or provide landmark descriptions (e.g., in front of the Google building).

Each time I've been there, the atmosphere has been lively. I've never sat down for a full meal, but I do enjoy their soups and apps. I like the overall feel of this place, like you are in an updated wine cellar (not dark and basement like, but with wine stored & aging.). \\n\\nI opted for something different than my usual from their extensive wine menu. The waitress knew her stuff and walked me through three of the interesting, less common whites on their menu. I went with a bright, crisp white made from a red grape. \\n\\nIt's definitely a good gathering place for dates and smaller groups. A great place where girlfriends can catch up over wine at the bar."},{"name":"Taj Mahal","address":"1075 E South Boulder Rd, Ste 145","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty good Indian food. It's not very spicy, so be prepared to ask for extra hot if you want some heat. The reason for my lukewarm review is the dining experience itself. The service was non-existant, we were assisted by a few different people and none of them were around when it came time to grab our check. I ended up going up to the kitchen entrance to flag someone down to pay our bill. There's no music playing, and the lighting and decor are a bit dark and drab. The wall next to us was covered in a few years worth of dust.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and head down to Broomfield to Zaika. This place is just a bit too average."},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Solid \\"Mexican\\" Food. Prices are around what you'd expect walking in.\\n\\nI had the Beef Tenderloin tips in Tomato & Chipotle sauce. It aas a small portion for about $14. Other guests at our table ordered the same meal and got at least 35% more beef which was odd. My Wife had the Chilaquiles, They tasted hand-made and then deep fried.\\nTheir Tortillas were above average, Their Little breads I had never seen in a Mexican restaurant, I am Mexican, and sadly I must just call them mini ciabattas were quite delicious. The 2.50 Pan Dulce was really amazing but $2.50? really? I didn't order any drinks seeing that a flute of Mimosa was $5 I stuck with water and my wife the coffee which was good.\\n\\nWe don't live in Austin so doubtful on weekend trips I'd ever eat there again. If you haven't had real Mexican food. This is definitely authentic and worth a visit."},{"name":"Franco's","address":"1740 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Atlanta's best kept Italian secret.  Excellent food.  Great service.  Always consistent.  The eggplant parmesan is excellent.  I've also enjoyed their pizzas, scampi, alfredo, the tilapia with lemon caper sauce, and the specials are always excellent.  The pear and gorgonzola salad is DELICIOUS.  I also love vanilla cream cake for dessert.\\n\\nYou can't go wrong at Franco's.  Classic. Romantic (in a neighborhood gem sort of way).  Comfort food.

Yes, I got to have some great BBQ for lunch but several hours later when we were getting ready to head back to the DFW area it was time for another meal and my father recalled a New York Times review that he recently read (a week prior to the trip). We did our respective Yelp and Google searches and Contigo was our destination. \\n\\nContigo is in a quiet neighborhood just north of the downtown area and it's just really fitting for Austin. It's a really nice patio restaurant with a covered area and plenty of umbrellas for the rest of the grounds. Fans with misters keep everyone cool and the beer and drink selections are at a premium. My father noted, jokingly, that it seemed to be a requirement of nose piercings to be part of the staff as a couple of the women did have them.\\n\\nThe food was an eclectic American fare from fried green beans to burgers and steak with small plate items, salads and a small dessert selection. We got some olives for the table that were dusted with orange peel and fennel, my father got the house burger and fries and I had the antelope carpaccio. I never had the opportunity to try antelope before and I expected a gamey meat. I was surprised at how clean and buttery tasting it was. It came with sea salt and fresh cracked pepper on it along with a relish of sweet peppers. I wasn't extremely hungry and it was a perfect size. \\n\\nOur server was great and I got to sample a couple of the beers before I chose a really nice local and the staff was quick with the water refills and general maintenance of the tables. I guess the NYT knew what they were talking about when they reviewed this place.\\n\\nContigo is Very family friendly. There were children everywhere on a Saturday early evening and it was a really relaxed atmosphere. No stress, no one being hurried out the door.\\n\\nIf you make your way down to Austin, this is a great restaurant to add to your list.\\n\\nEnjoy."},{"name":"Is'Original","address":"1671 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I love, love, LOVE their crispy chicken pad thai!

This is, by far, my favorite trailer in Austin. And believe me, I've eaten here at all different times, from 2:30 in the afternoon to 2:30 in the morning and it is always magical.  The bahn mi tacos are, hands down, the best fusion tacos I've ever had in my entire life. It's an incredible combination of flavor and substance and deliciousness. The pad thai taco is also incredible and sometimes I can't between between the two but I usually end up buying one of each and then finishing, being sad and buying another bahn mi taco. \\nAm I gushing?

This place came up on yelp and has good reviews so just give it a try. We had volcano rolls, teriyaki wings and spicy seafood ramen noodles. The volcano rolls were recommended by our waitress. It was okay since I was hoping they will come with the whole baby scallops. The sushi rolls was 3.5 stars. Ramen was 4 stars. The broth was hardy and spicy. It has a good flavor. Chicken wings were cooked to a golden crispy and a 4 stars. I would come back again to sample the different sushi and rolls. I wouldn't be able to do this review if it wasn't the staff brought me back the cell phone.

It was mainly pizza and ice cream(and don't me wrong at all, I love pizza and ice cream). When Thai Grille opened a few years ago, I couldn't wait to try it. I've been here multiple times and it's always really good. \\n\\nThis place is little, but so charming. The walls are bright and covered with local artwork that is always changing. It's always so bright and cheery and the people working here are too. You can tell they just really love their restaurant and the food they put out. \\n\\nAnd the food is awesome. If you are a soup freak like me, you have to try the spicy Tom Yum Kung soup. It's almost like a hot and sour soup. It has lots of fresh vegetables, mushrooms, lemongrass, and shrimp in a sour and spicy broth. I love it. The fried spring rolls are tasty. But the best is the Pad Thai. It's the best pad thai I've had so far anywhere in the Columbus area. It's always perfect. I've read some comments on the portion size I want to address. I think people have become accustomed to having way too large of a portion size. Every time you go to dinner, you don't have to have so much food you feel overwhelmed or eat for the next 4 days. The portion size here is perfect. Just enough food to fill you up, not enough to make you feel gross. I've also read that the price is high for the Pad Thai. At $12, you get a plate of perfectly prepared, fresh, and delicious Pad Thai. This place isn't a fast food joint. $12 is perfectly fair for what you get here. I would probably pay more for it, if we're being honest. \\n\\nI wish we had more places like this in Westerville and I hope Thai Grille is around for a long time. As good as the food is, I have no doubt it will be."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"WOW...I thought I had already had so much excellent food while in Atlanta that this would be a let down...I was wrong!\\n\\nThe fried chicken and waffles are outstanding!
