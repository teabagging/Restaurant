I'm not so picky about the meat because I'm really after the broth.

That's both a good thing and a bad thing. For the most part, the Springs is a dramatic improvement over Downtown Disney in a number of ways. Parking before was a nightmare so the addition of the garages (with more to come) has made visiting this area much simpler and quicker. The overall flow of the area has improved with more organized bus access, the main thoroughfare that goes from east to west, and a pedestrian bridge on the east side that bypasses some of the heavily-trafficed areas. The elimination of the awkward Pleasure Island space that was a ghost town during the day and adding more restaurants really improves the experiences.\\n\\nNow for the downside: it really doesn't feel like Disney anymore. Most of it is a ritzy outdoor shopping mall next-to-no Disney theming. There are the classic Disney stores on the former-Downtown Disney side but that's it. A lot of people won't care because it's a beautifully-themed area but for me, when I go to Walt Disney World I want it to feel that way and this doesn't have the same vibe that it used to.\\n\\nAdding to this, it seems to get increasingly crowded and trying to get a table at a restaurant at dinner-time without a reservation is a non-starter.

I was hoping for chunks of salmon, but very little was included; I used the magnifying app in my cell phone to see the tiny pieces of salmon in the broth, which had a decent flavor. I also ordered the friied fish cakes, which were smallish & rather ordinary - no better than something similar from the frozen food section from a super market.\\n\\nWe went at a quiet time - too late for lunch & too early for dinner, so getting a table was not a problem.

Ordered the Dineout menu deal (appetizer of either bocco salad or the fried chicken japanese mcnugget thing karaararaa kamakazi or whatever its' called), salmon and chocolate sundae. Chicken was quite nice (my date had that) and the coleslaw on the side and spicy sauce was tasty although a bit red peppery than expected (not a bad thing).\\n\\nI have to say i agree with one of the other reviewers that their menu leaves out some key details - like I kinda knew that bocconcini were those little mozzarella balls (but these were probably like one sliced up). And that the chocolate sundae included a brownie (I thought it was just a classic ice cream sundae). But at least in these cases, the outcome was happy. The brownie sundae was nearly as good as mine (it was dark chocolate yum!) However, it could have used some nuts.  Same with the banana bread dessert that my date had.\\n\\nSalad could have used some more pesto but that's ' probably because I love love fresh pesto. Especially if it's done well (which it was). \\n\\nHad the Toblerone cocktail. Again, the description included the ingredients but could have mentioned that they tried to emulate the WHITE CHOCOLATE toblerone. I liked it but was hoping for more darker chocolate.\\n\\nBC salmon was prefect. Would not have changed a thing except there's rice on the side... which is fine but there's not much sauce to mix with the rice. I like to squish my rice with sauce from the meat. Still it was grilled perfectly and tasted and presented well. \\n\\nDate had the veggie mushroom Pasta. Not bad but not completely filling for pasta as an entree. I think they could have thrown some more ravioli in there for the price. Not sure if the portion size was smaller due to the dineout menu....? \\n\\nDesserts were great... just could have used some walnuts to add some texture. Maybe the chef has a nut allergy.  Pity him/her. \\n\\n\\nOh yeah, service was pretty good and attentive.

I first had it at the original location in Fort Collins and was totally hooked.  I love their variety of tortillas, choices of fillings, very fresh veggies, potatoes, and especially their strawberry habe√±ero \\"soul sauce.\\"\\n\\nWe don't live near Fort Collins, so we have to settle for other BCB locations.  While none are quite as good as the original, they all come close.\\n\\nThen we tried the one in Boulder.  This was the first location we really felt the individual ownership of each franchise.  My boyfriend and I each ordered a veggie burrito.  The veggies were sliced differently, were drenched in oil, and were not nearly as fresh as we expect.  They also piled about 1/2 the normal amount on each burrito.  Then, when it came time for sauce, I asked for my usual: the soul sauce.  The server launches into a diatribe about how they don't have it, that each location is individually owned, and they have to PAY for the recipe (the indignity!).  But that they have plenty of salsas, and I just need to pick one.  I asked for sour cream only.\\n\\nSo, we paid for our burritos (1/2 sized, full priced), and ate in the dining room.  We couldn't find a clean table, so we wiped one down ourselves.  They didn't have nearly the array of hot sauces you can find at other BCBs, but the selection was okay.  \\n\\nThe burritos were even greasier than they looked.  They didn't have any of the distinct flavors or textures that we had come to expect from Big City.\\n\\nOverall, it was a massive disappointment, and in a town with so many awesome places to eat, we will be sure to never visit this Big City Burrito again."},{"name":"Kushi Box","address":"520 Robson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I thought this place was great!

Service was friendly and attentive throughout our visit, and the menu offers a number of interesting choices.\\n\\nIn the end, I decided on the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich with fries.  The chicken was a little overdone, but acceptably so, and the flavor was great with the slaw on top and drenched with the spicy sauce that came on the side.  The fries were tasty too.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, it feels like a bar that offers a good selection of bar food.  In this respect, I have to say it's definitely above average bar food.

Here are some reasons: 1) go to a restaurant that specializes in one type of food, not a restaruant that serves Cantonese, Szechuan or Sushi all in one restaurant, which is confusing as to what it's really good at. 2) this restaruant has been in business for 30+ years with the same owner and they are still in busines. 3) the dishes are generous portions for the price. 4) the Mandarin scallops (an abundance of large sea scallops) is cooked to perfection and is fabulous with the sweet and tangy sauce, the kung pao chicken is the best in town, not to mention the chicken with tangy sauce and the sesame beef. And for something a little milder; two meats in scallons and the sizzling scallops and prawns.  You can truly taste the \\"wok\\" flavor which only a seasonsed chef can produce properly.  They offer parking validation in the same building, which is a plus.  If you haven't been to this restaurant or haven't been back in a while, give it a try, you will be pleasantly surprised!

The Spicy Thai noodles were what I'd consider over-salted, but the Matzo-Ramen had just the right amount of flavor. I would have preferred a higher broth to noodle ratio; this in no way would take away from the dish if it was simply served in a larger vessel. \\n\\nWe also got the avocado, which, at $5 a pop, could use at least some crackers or toasted baguettes. It was just half an avocado with sour cream (or what was probably dubbed \\"creme frai√ßhe\\"), roasted corn kernels, some pumpkin seeds (but doesn't calling them \\"pepitas\\" make it SO much more intriguing, thereby garnishing the $5?), and some spices. \\nI appreciated that they had tea, but only 3 or 4 kinds?

To give them the benefit of the doubt, it may be the restaurant's lack of an expediter, but our dishes came out in a random order that did NOT work for us. The waiter had prefaced the food delivery by telling is they'd come at different times, but come ON. Spicy noodles, then soup, then the avocado later?! Wtf is that? Ass backwards that's what! (The name \\"Little Ass/Donkey\\" somehow seems so fitting now). And the soup came with chop sticks and two children's cereal size bowls with little miso soup spoons. Anyone who has had Ramen knows that sh** ain't getting transported with some sticks and a damn tablespoon. They could have either given us more appropriate utensils for dividing the dish or, hey, why not cut the noodles for us since we're paying $17 for a dish that costs about $1.75 to make?

There are more than enough studies to prove that the only way to make more money is to reserve booths for 3 or more.  So, these days, as a single diner I am forced to sit on a top tall, uncomfortable, atmospheric, tippy stool or leave. Well I could take the hot sunny window. This does solve the problem of servers making less money on single customers.\\n\\nAnd, it has the advantage of allowing the servers feel to better by not being able to hyper focus on how much they are loosing on those single diners.  So unfair. \\n\\nAnd that's the point. The servers have taken over and the music, the rules, all is now designed to please the servers. \\n\\nPaul Revere I will miss you. I'll check in once a year to see if customers have regained their position as a priority. \\n\\nBye buy, there are other diners that prioritize customers more than you do."},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Topgolf is always fun with friends or colleagues.

I left 3/4 of it in the basket and made a meal out of the semi-acceptable hush-puppies we were told came from a bag. Sigh.\\n\\nThe jambalaya tasted like it came from a box.

Thankfully, we were smart enough to get a reservation as the place packs up pretty quick. This was a perfect place for us to go because my mother in-law eats a gluten-free diet and there were plenty of options she could eat.\\n\\nI ordered the brioche french toast and was shocked by the ginormous hunk of bread I was served. It was delicious, but I ended up sharing it because it was too much for one person.  The bacon was tasty, but I had to ask for more than one slice, as did the rest of my family. The brisket was too lean for my taste, but my husband smartly asked for a fattier cut and got it. So, ask if you don't like super-lean brisket make sure you ask because they do have the good stuff. The grits were good, as was the fresh fruit. I thought the mac n cheese tasted velveeta-ey which isn't my thing. I finished things off with an incredibly moist, delicious red velvet cupcake with an amazing creamy frosting.  Believe it or not, I got a little tipsy despite all this food because I ordered an Arturo and it was strooooooong! Good way to start the day! My mother in-law ordered the Sanchez and it tasted like a spicy bloody mary without the tomato juice. Delicious.\\n\\nEveryone enjoyed the food and drinks and we all had a nice, relaxing time. I love the space, the wait staff was helpful without being overbearing, and the food was constantly being replenished.

In one word: YES. \\n\\nThe salsa is perfect; not too much spiciness but great flavor. By far one of the best tasting salsa I've had at any restaurant. The margaritas hold their own as the best in Denver. Granted, this is the only Mexican restaurant I've been to in the Denver area but if I'm comparing them to what I've had in California, they're up there with the best. The Texas margarita is OUTSTANDING, as is the Patron Margarita. \\n\\nThe guacamole is just ok; it isn't prepared in front of you, which is a big thing in CA and my favorite part of ordering guacamole. It comes with diced tomatoes and a blend of cheeses which makes it different than others I've had. \\n\\nNow to the main dish and what blew me away; the Burrito de Chili Colorado. I have to admit that Chili Colorado is my most favorite Mexican dish of all. However, it's hard to find that perfect dish at restaurants because I expect my Chili Colorado to not just be tender but SPICY. This did not disappoint. By FAR the best Chili Colorado I've ever had. Spicy, tender, great balance of meat to beans; and like others have mentioned, great proportion. The burrito was huge and like a fat body I ate the whole thing because it was so good. \\n\\nIf you're ever in Denver or the area and you are wanting Mexican food, you'd be crazy not to find an Old Santa Fe.

The ramen noodle style is different than what I am used to or prefer.  I like the style that is chewy egg noodle often yellow tinged and slightly kinked.  This was more of a straight noodle possibly wheat or buckwheat.  I believe it is just a different style of Ramen (possibly inspired by a different province).  \\n\\nAmbiance: It was humble, there is a large area in the center fashioned into a children's playplace/kitchen for those who want a kid friendly place.\\n\\nService: The lady there was very talkative speaking Japanese so I tried my Japanese with her.

Overall, we found the brisket and some of the ribs to be pretty dry and tough. The sauces were just okay, kind of one-dimensional. I actually prefer the Rufus Teague bbq sauce we get from the grocery store. The drink selection was pretty limited. Fountain soda. Apart from not having beer (they are currently seeking a license) they didn't have iced tea (sweet or otherwise) which to me seems like a big miss for a bbq place. Standouts at this visit were the pulled pork and baked beans. Did not care for the mac and cheese. Was a bit oily and didn't really have much cheese. I know it's probably blaspheme to say this, but the mac and cheese at our local Whole Foods is better. Lastly, they should have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of those thin pizza place napkins. BBQ is messy and I'm not a practitioner of finger-lickin' at the table.

Still optimistic - though already not impressed.\\n\\nThe paneer would at best be called watery.  In all honesty, I found the flavor to be nonexistent.  It was spicy, as I'd requested, but no respectable establishment would call what I received \\"tikka masala.\\"  Now, I know, \\"tikka masala\\" itself is an Anglicised dish, but the menu did not offer an authentic paneer dish, so I hoped this would be a good alternative.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.   Not only that, but the tiny naan was soft, soggy even, and the plate came with what I assumed was a side salad with some unknown spicy dressing.  The salad, however, was also sitting in the rice & soaked with watery \\"tikka masala,\\" so the lettuce wilted and was not appetising.  The rice was fine, but if that wasn't, the review would be one-star instead of two.\\n\\nI would say that while edible, this is definitely not a first, second, or third choice for me any time in the future.

Wings can be done a million ways and everyone has their own preference so it's useless to say they're the best. BUT in the breaded category - yep they're the best. They're huge! Always extra saucy. Flavor list isn't small but also not overwhelming. The standard levels of heat are all great, and the Carolina Gold and Chipotle are 2 of my favorites that many other popular wing stops are missing. Continuing in the chicken zone... the boneless wings are really good size - not \\"chunked\\" or shaped from a tube, and the chicken fingers WHOA also huge. 2 fingers can be a meal. \\nThe pizzas are personal size, but very good. Each topped with a wing BONUS! The apps list are all awesome hangover snacks while you're waiting for your bloody mary to arrive. The dumpster sauce served with fries & wedges is special to the house and has a great zest. Tuesdays are $1 night for the featured app of the week - all great options! \\nNow moving onto the most important part of why I love Roosters, especially the German Village location - GAMEDAYYY!!! IMO the best spot of anywhere to watch sports. If I'm going to be bound down anywhere for 4+ hours pounding beers, they better be on special and they always are! - cheap. And keep the apps coming during your long hours of Keno - you can afford both because everything is SO AFFORDABLE! (and remember, good too). All of the above I'm ranting about is available for easy carryout too from all locations. I probably take it home weekly outside of football season. Be aware though, the German Village location is tiny. Though more intimate than the others, which is why it tends to be so much more interactive for games. You see the regulars, but it's a good neighborhood vibe that's welcoming to everyone - kids and families too!

Didn't listen to guests was loss prevention and even the Front Desk Manager (his name escapes me) and didn't understand English was the nice woman at Concierge desk. \\n\\nVisualize. Zen something here.. I get into the room the first second I walk in, I try to lock up something in the hotel room safe. Safe door open, press reset and clsd shows up. Won't take a new number, safe needs to be reset. NOT a big deal. I am sure it's happened before and I can use the safe deposit box if needed. NOW I remember the last time I was here, I used the safe deposit box and the front desk clerk who waited while I did it got freaked out cause I unloaded 3 guns into the safe deposit boxes which used to be located behind the front desk area somewhere if my recollection serves me correctly. \\n\\nI start heading to dinner so I go to the lobby at the Front Desk. I wait 5 minutes for an elevator from the 35th floor. I approach concierge and she has zero clue what I am talking about when it comes to the safe. No speakadee English (or just no understandee English). I Move to the Elite check in front desk clerk. She tells me someone has to be there. I said I am going out and I don't have to be there cause there is nothing in the safe because it won't close. She calls Loss Prevention and voila, when I return from dinner it's still not working but a message on my phone tells me they have to be present in the room to service my safe. BUT it's broken and I can't close it so you CAN come into my room. \\n\\nThis gets repeated another time the following night.

The patio area was nice although I think they should get rid of the cushions. Some of them had spots on them and I saw one couple flipped theirs over before sitting down. I ordered a margarita. It was strong which is always good but it didn't necessary taste good which is bad. I also got the shrimp tacos which were definitely good. I asked for cheese with them and I ended up with a plate of cheese to add to it myself. Um...okay I guess. Who turns down extra cheese? My fiancee had the brisket tacos on flour tortillas and according to her, it was like the second coming of Jesus himself. She still won't shut up about them so you should probably try them too. What I didn't like was that both our meals came with beans and rice but we only got one serving to share. It is presumptuous that we would (A) want to share but also (B) now we feel gipped and where does this leave us as far as leftovers? Also, the beans had a ton of cheese on them.

Lets start with parking. Paid parking lot, or meters on the street. Make your way inside to navigate the crowd towards the stairway in corners. On the weekend, it often feels like a salmon swimming upstream. Upstairs you will see tables and chairs around the balcony to park and eat. But of course there's no time for that. You have to get your place in line. The chalkboards posted, already show the countdown to the last piece of chicken. If you are fortunate enough to find yourself there on a Saturday or Sunday, count your blessings. These are the only days to get waffles. \\"I have no interest in Chicken and waffles\\". \\"I would never order waffles from a chicken spot\\". \\"Must just be a southern thang\\". So glad to hear you say it. More for us! I must have uttered one of those lines because we did not order them. Then when someone sat down at the communal table by me with theirs, regret set in. Just watch the faces of those eating. Those close up images alone could be a commercial for their menu. \\"I'll have what she's having\\". How blessed are we that this woman handed a large piece of waffle, for my wife and I to try. There wasn't even syrup on it yet. You know when you take a bite that makes you moan out loud? MMMMM! She immediately described the taste, and texture as funnel cake. It was gone before we realized we forgot to sample the syrup.\\n\\nIt must be a blast for others to watch first timers experiencing this delight. Needless to say, we will never leave a waffle behind on weekends again. Getting back in line is rather daunting. I felt like we should leave some of these riches for others.\\n\\nThere is super friendly staff to guide you through the line, and help you on the menu. Warnings are clearly posted for the HOT chicken. This is not to be taken in jest. Unlike KFC Nashville chicken which is just sauced in hot, this heat infiltrates the meat to the bone. Yes, that's right. I licked the bone to see if it was hot. I drank a lot sweet tea that day. The bread even tasted worthy of a seat on the plate. It looks simple, but does not taste like bad generic. The cole slaw? Yep, I tilted it to get one more bite.\\n\\n2 things to make your trip even better... One, Check-in with Yelp to get a FREE banana pudding. Let the mmmmm's continue.

I am very unhappy with the \\"customer service\\" we received.\\n\\nWhen we arrived we requested to sit in a booth by the window, and the waitress said \\"well you can sit down but it may be a while\\", very odd response. We were able to sit down promptly and the same waitress ended up waiting on us and could  have cared less. There is nothing worse than when a waiter or waitress makes you feel like you are inconveniencing them when you ask for something. She made us feel so uncomfortable we did not submit our to-go order, and instead headed over to Sonic, where they don't make you feel guilty about ordering food or asking for extra's.\\n\\nI've been in the customer service industry for years, and the waitress could have at least faked a smile instead of doing the absolute bare minimum and worse, making us feel like we were inconveniencing her.

The place is awesome but it does have its downs, during Disney busier season it can be a nightmare especially in the later evenings when the grown ups want to wind down from the parks and pleasure island can be packed. Right now the parking is totally chaotic since they are redoing the entire Downtown Disney area and the parking is under major construction and now a big portion of it has been reserved recently for only Valet so finding a place to park on your own can be an adventure on it's own, which sometimes if you are willing to go around and around rather than parking across the street by the casting building can be more than half an hour as you watch parking stalkers drive around and around in hopes of the perfect spot that is most likely not going to happen. I am really excited to see the new development and what is to come once they transform this place in to Disney springs, some of the places people love though are being shut down like I know there is no longer a baby cakes since they shut that down, but with the listing of some of the soon to be listed restaurants coming in the next few years I can't help be excited as a cast member to watch this place grow and develop, especially if the rumor of a Morimoto restaurant really happens! We love mostly the shopping aspect and side of down town disney where you find Ghiradelli, Mickey's Pantry, World of Disney, and for any fashionable Disnerd like myself would love Trendy! I am not as big a fan of the Pleasure Island side honestly, but I can't wait to catch cirque de soleil or go to Disney quest once the baby is born we may be able to go in there and finally discover! If you are looking for anything and everything Disney definitely recommend World of Disney which has something for anyone! For your kiddos the best place for them will be the Once upon a Toy store which is the ultimate disney toy store! This place has a lot of great things to offer and I can't wait to see what else will come as it develops, but as of now it is a great place to stroll and not have to worry about fast pass this or that, or about hour lines to get on a ride, rather just take a stroll, grab a bite to eat, and enjoy the atmosphere and there always seems to be something fun going on here.

We went to Superica last Saturday night for dinner.  Our party consisted of six people so I understand that we required one of the larger tables, but six people on a Saturday night is not a ridiculous request.  For some strange reason Superica doesn't take reservations so we arrived early and put our name down with the hostess around 6:45 p.m.  The hostess told us it would be an hour to an hour and a half, but our entire party enjoys a cocktail or two so were happy to walk around Krog Street Market and grab a drink or possibly two.  The bar at Superica was slammed so we decided to go to the Cockentrice to our grab drinks.  After two hours we still had not heard from Superica so I went over to check on the status of the table.  The hostess (who was rather surly) informed me that there were sixteen tables ahead of us!  She also told us that it would probably be another hour.  I was amazed at how the hostess could actually tell me that we still had an hour wait after already waiting for two hours!!!  Never in my life have I been told that the wait would be two hours and I actually consented, but the hostess rudely and incorrectly told us that the wait would be two hours when we put out names down.  Even if she had told me two hours, which she didn't, the issue here is that we had waited two hours and now they are asking us to wait an additional hour!  Also, what was wrong with this place, why would it take three hours to sit a party of six.  I went back to my friends at the Cockentrice and we all agreed to wait an additional thirty minutes so that they could finish their cocktails and then we would determine if a table would be available or if we should head elsewhere.  Well after thirty minutes we were told there were still eleven parties ahead of us.  My girlfriend, who was the only member of our group who actually wanted to wait for the table, implored us to stick it out. After over three hours my girlfriend went to check on the status where they told her there were four parties ahead of us.  My girlfriend is a fierce attorney and she was not taking this news lightly.  She then proceeded to inform every patron who questioned the wait time that the hostess was a liar and she did not have any actual clue how long the wait times were.  Amazingly, we were seated a few minutes after.  \\n\\nThe restaurant tried to make up for the ridiculous wait by giving us free guacamole, queso, and nachos.  While the free appetizers were appreciated, they were woefully deficient after waiting for over three hours.  The food was good and the server was fine (I had the chicken enchiladas), but there was no way I was going to enjoy any meal after a three hour wait.  For a restaurant that has been open as long as Superica has, this evening was a complete disaster.  I have never waited that long for a table in my entire life and I really think that the restaurant mismanaged the entire situation.  I will not be heading back to this place for a VERY long time, if ever."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had the chance to visit Mike's Pastry after a multitude of friends who used to live in Boston recommended it to me.

Even before I planned my trip to Boston I knew that some shop named Mike's Pastry was basically a staple of the city. That being said, I was surprised that they didn't do a better job at organizing the people inside the space! It basically felt like a huge crowd waiting in self made lines that criss-crossed throughout the entire shop. This made the wait confusing and most likely longer than it needed to be.\\n\\nWhen it came time to order I went with the standard ricotta cannoli with chocolate chips ($4). The wait staff was great and really efficient in taking orders. Big shout out to them for their resilience in the face of what seemed like well over 100 people waiting to order at that time of the day.\\n\\nOverall an experience worth having for a cannoli from a staple Boston pastry shop.

For people who like to read and write about restaurants, the idea can come with a lot of baggage - baggage that should be set aside in the effort to write an objective review. \\n\\nWhich brings me to another figure of speech involving animals: \\"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck.\\"\\n\\nEven with an attempt to set aside prejudice, Kona Grill's strengths and shortcomings tend to fall right in line with stereotypes about upscale chain eateries. The layout and decor are fantastic. Service is chipper and competent. The menu is full of exotic and ambitious-sounding dishes.\\n\\nSo far, so good... though the wheels start to come off when you get to that last part: The menu is just too full of options - from sushi to burgers and Korean to pizza, it's all simply too much. There's a tipping point where eclectic fusion falls off into schizophrenia, where the lack of cohesion becomes untenable and you realize your experience is going to be more reminiscent of The Cheesecake Factory than a high-end swank fusion place. Not that The Cheesecake Factory is a bad place, and not that Kona Grill is a bad place either - it simply fails to deliver on implicit promises of being something better.\\n\\nDaunted by the variety, we chose to stick to a couple of choices highlighted on the menu as signature offerings. Macadamia Nut Chicken was indeed pretty good. The chicken breast was perfectly moist and the different flavors combined nicely. I could quibble about the garlic-and-bacon mashed potatoes not being an ideal compliment, but this dish made a valiant effort at redeeming lowered expectations. The same wasn't true for Truffled Steak Flatbread, which was an epic failure. The flavors of bleu cheese and truffle oil were wayyy too loud, overwhelming everything else, especially the steak. The better half (who's a fiend for all things truffle) was sufficiently put off by the flatbread that we skipped dessert to make a quick getaway.\\n\\nSo, plus points for a great atmosphere and excellent service; minus points for a menu with too many incongruous choices and a tendency (shown by our flatbread) for fantastic item descriptions that suffer in execution."},{"name":"Bamboo Wok","address":"2432 Sand Mine Rd","city":"Davenport","stars":"3.5","text":"Very good food at a good price!

I was tired, thirsty and starving so this sounded like heaven.\\n\\nAnd it was the best comfort food...my goodness, I ate everything that was put in front of me. The strawberry smoothie was delicious, and I also sampled my friend's mango. Next time, I'll be brave enough to try the avocado smoothie (especially after reading the other Yelp reviews). \\n\\nI opted for a combination special, with half a banh-mi and seafood pho. The sandwich came first: warm chicken served on crusty bread with fresh cilantro, carrots, cabbage and jalapenos. I then continued to carbo load on pho noodles, sprouts, and seafood. The fish cake was a little funky, so I don't know if I'll get the seafood option again, but the pho itself was great.\\n\\nI was in a pho-foodie coma after being outside in the heat then eating at Lee's. A smoothie and combination lunch set me back about $10 with tip and I was so full that I didn't even want to eat dinner that later night, And I slept like Liz Lemon after she eats too many meatball subs."},{"name":"India Palace","address":"23 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"It has been an hour and a half since I placed my delivery order and still nothing.

Before I write anything else, let me say that anything in the Atlantic sauce is the one to beat. It was creamy, sweet, tangy, spicy and it all came on strong....SO delicious. I ended up ignoring the shrimp etouffee and ate all the rice it came with with the Atlantic sauce. \\n\\nThe Louisiana sauce is a much milder and basic option but still not bad. I was told the Atlantic sauce had Vietnamese flavors in it so maybe you would do better with the Louisiana if you aren't into Asian food. \\n\\nThe only complaint I had was that the corn and potato sides weren't prepped enough with salt. It turned out really bland even as they were dipped in the sauces.\\n\\nI would recommend this place to anyone looking for a less expensive alternative to the famous Barking Crab.

Unfortunately our experience was mediocre. Pluses first: we enjoyed the atmosphere and decor, and props to the very friendly, warm, and competent wait staff. The bison sliders with caramelized onions were yummy, if salty (they need some more greenery or tomatoes to brighten them up), and the escargot was predictably rich, buttery, and delicious. Other dishes were not bad but not especially memorable: the p√¢t√©, and a pleasantly original salad with butternut squash. Unfortunately we thought attempts at \\"fusion\\" came across as flat. The hot and sour carrot soup was uninspired -- basically a carrot soup with ginger overtones. We also tried, partly at our server's suggestion, the Dan Dan noodles and the fried rice. We were hoping for a modern / western twist on both of these dishes but instead got what felt like pretty standard Chinese restaurant fare, and not even particularly good at that. I think they were aiming at a little cheeky kitsch by serving those last two in plastic dragon-patterned Chinese bowls, but it just came across as cliche. \\n\\nAs I said, we really wanted to like this.

The filling is heavy and thick. They recently started offering flavored filling, which are totally artificial tasting.

While I believe the shells and filings are made in the shop I have been told that a large portion of the items are imported from a commercial bakery.  Overall, yes most people will enjoy the food here. No it's not authentic, no it's not the best Cannoli you'll ever have, and no it's not worth going just to say you've been there in Boston.

We use to frequent Brian's Diner when it was open during our ten year residency. This afternoon however we found that a new restaurant had popped up in its place called STIR. We were on our way to another restaurant in Thornton Park when we were beckoned by umbrellas touting Buffalo Trace Whiskey. We decided to be spontaneous and stop in for lunch. We couldn't be happier we listened to our inner spontaneity. We were greeted by a classy, yet rustic, interior familiar with more recent restaurant bars we've visited in the last few years. We were able to pick a table by the window that enable a pleasant view of Lake Ivanhoe which we've missed during our tenure away. I ordered a signature bourbon cocktail while my husband opted for a Gin and tonic. My drink was delicious, however a bit sweet. I will certainly order it again, but perhaps request less raspberry liquor, and a little more Buffalo Trace. I then ordered a staple from the happy hour menu: Pulled Pork Puff Pastry in aus jus. While my husband devoured his Jerk Chicken Sandwich, I slowly and delicately ate my puff pastry. I ate it slowly because it was so good that I didn't want the experience to end. In fact, as I took the last bite, I had an internal battle with my rational brain not order another. Although, our lunch receipt was a little pricier than we normally like to spend during the 12-1pm time frame it was well worth every penny. We will certainly be back. I plan on becoming a regular during happy hour when my beloved puff pastry costs only $5. I'd also like to give a shout out to our native Kentucky born waiter who was just the right combination of friendly, informative, and efficient.

I wanted to try more so I bought a blueberry muffin ($.80), scone ($.80), and raspberry crumble ($1). Unbelievably cheap!

Indeed, there are often signs that tell people not to stand in the line. But people still do. Instead, you should wander right past the line and go into the store. There will be several people behind the counter and - here is where the magic happens - each of them has their own little line going. Pick one and stand in it. Rather than waiting 30 minutes, you will be waiting for less than five. And the great thing is, you'll be following the rules.

We don't go out to eat a lot but we're still managing to become regulars.  Last night we made a reservation for 8:30pm.  When we got there the hostess told us that we could have a patio table if we wanted to wait a few minutes at the bar.  Yew Street at Cornwall is hopping on a warm summer Saturday night and people watching was the perfect companion to our evening meal.  We were able to both squeeze in together on the bench affording us both of view of pedestrians and the stunning sunset.  \\n\\nThe hot weather was wreaking havoc on their draught system so we opted for sharing big bottles of Asahi Super Dry.  We started out with a bowl of their chilled, marinated Edamame.  My husband isn't usually crazy about edamame but loves it here.  There's something in the marinade that gets him.  Next we had the Renkon Gyoza.  Minced pork with lotus root done tempura-style.  Super-delish!!!  This one is going to be hard NOT to order in future.  I love the slight crunchiness of the lotus root and the spice in the pork is perfect.  Usually we have the Ebi Mayo which is wonderful but we opted for the Ebi Avocado salad as it was so warm out.  I think the citrus dressing has a bit of sesame oil and soy sauce in it.  It was very fresh, flavourful and included about 4 spot prawns and a big fan of avocado slices.  The Tuna Carpaccio was good but didn't blow me away.  I found that the sauce masked any tuna flavour.  Still, it melted in my mouth and I had to fight off my husband's chop sticks as he tried to steal my last piece. I do enjoy the Saba more though and it's fun having the server sear it right at your table with a little blow-torch.  Off the Fresh Sheet we ordered the Duck Teriyaki and the Calamarinade.  The duck was tasty but slightly dry. Luckily the sauce made up for it.  The Calamarinade is chilled, marinated squid legs.  I love chewy things like black licorice and squid so I was happy with this dish.  If you prefer deep-fried calamari for its tenderness then don't order this dish.  The flavour was fresh and the bowl was loaded with marinated onions and peppers as well - perfect for enjoying with beer on a hot day.  We usually order one of the hot stone bowls with rice but we were full to the brim with our five choices.\\n\\nWe have always found the staff to be very friendly here.  They're an attractive group but are also knowledgeable and seem happy to be at work.  We've sat at the bar watching the chefs, tables inside and now on the patio.  The atmosphere has always been cozy, relaxing and despite the bustling business they do I have never felt rushed.  I would like to see them change up their fresh sheet a bit more often.  We still have a few new dishes to try though and keep gathering new favourites from their selection.  This is a fun place to go with a group as the plates are meant for sharing and you can try more dishes.  They have a lovely round table at the back that looks like it could seat 10 people.  I've also seen parties there with bar service (full bottles of spirits and mix on the tables).

My sushi was not that great! Since it was late I just dealt with it. My friend noticed her Turkey Burger had a funny smell to it (which it did).. It smelled as if it were spoiled. After notifying the waiter he promptly went and got the manager (We did not ask for the manager, but it seems as if they do this often). That is where things went DOWNHILL! The manager (Jimmy Chio - from what the business card said) came to our table starting off with an attitude. He told us that the smell came from the cheese on the burger and \\"it is CLEARLY stated on the menu what the cheese is\\".. My friend told him she just couldn't eat it because the smell of the cheese was turning her stomach, and she wasn't aware that it would smell like that.. Mr. Jimmy's solution was that she takes it home. He DID NOT offer her any other solutions. \\"Do you want it without the cheese??\\" \\"Would you like anything else?\\" NOTHING!!! \\nWhat would taking it home solve????!!

As it turned out, we got more than enough delicious food that we didn't need the ginger bread and the toast (especially with their jam) was very good whatever type of bread.

For celebrating, we are huge advocates of the Sundial, but my husband knows how much I love seafood, so we decided to try something new. After being seated, we were individually met by our two servers for the evening, a standard for the 'refined' dining experience. Between the two of them 'taking care of us', we saw one of them only two times: once when he introduced himself, then when he dropped off the check. The other showed no real attempt to engage with us as guests. Given the proximity between tables and hearing their conversations with other guests, by the time we competed dinner I truly felt like we were simply being ignored. I worked in the restaurant industry throughout college, so I have an idea what good service can resemble. \\nThere was also no attempt to recognize our reservation as an anniversary celebration. I didn't think much of it until I passed another table on my way to the restroom with 'Happy Anniversary' confetti sprinkled on their table. Do I really care about the confetti? No, but the fact we waited over 20 min for our cocktails, waited even longer to order food (which was not checked up or inquired upon thereafter). For a TUESDAY evening, with two servers, it was just unacceptable. By the time my (first, and only!) cocktail AND my water glass were sitting empty after dinner, we waived down the server and asked for the check. The worst part: while my husband was signing the check (in order to seek cocktails and better service elsewhere) one of the servers dropped off a complimentary anniversary desert. Huh?? Don't get me wrong, it was a kind gesture (and most likely standard protocol for celebrations), however in our situation it felt more like an awkward afterthought.

Having been to many \\"coastal\\" and dined at restaurants with wonderful scenic views, this place was a total rip off and a poor job indeed. I only came here because my friend's bachelorette party dinner was here, and I already had a bad feeling based on many of the other yelper's experiences. \\n\\nThis is going to be a long rant on the poor service received at this location.. I'm sorry but dining here is totally not worth it. \\n\\nWe went on a Saturday night, around 7pm and got seated in about 15 minutes or so. The server quickly moved us around to another part of the restaurant (for some unknown reason) and sat us down there, though the the move was probably made so we can accommodate her section. I don't know if she was having a bad day or not, but she took her frustration out on the whole group as she didn't hide her attitude or \\"I don't care about #$%^\\" tone of voice throughout the whole time. \\n\\nThe food was alright. I wouldn't pay that much for something that tasted like dry meat made with the cheapest material in the world.\\n\\nSo here it goes. Maybe I'm just used to better service, but I wanted to take the tray out of my server's hand and beat her with it. SARA (Yes, I remember your name - at least that's what it says on my receipt) was my blonde and terrible server. With eight girls who are just trying to eat (we weren't even high maintenance and we ordered moderately priced meals, no alcohol because we were going to go somewhere else later), she was sure rude. I don't understand why servers have this feeling of entitlement (also, I know we are paying for the experience overlooking the lake, hence the overpriced food), but you don't have to outright display your animosity towards us during the whole meal. Our drinks were not refilled once, and while she made multiple efforts going back and forth, refilling drinks for patrons who ta-da, spent money on ALCOHOL (your bill is higher) she made no eye contact whatsoever. She brought out the check and while we were trying to split it, made an impatient grunt. REALLY?!? Go back a few months/years ago where YOU applied for this job, YOU got this job, and this is YOUR JOB! Suck it up and WORK. This is why some establishments, while location and advertising do a great job (food wise, no comment), service just drives potential patrons away. Our check was $45 dollars (including gratuity) split amongst three girls (After separated since we shared the fajita for 2) and that included the gratuity already. While I was trying to explain how we wanted it split, she left halfway before I finished speaking without even acknowledging me. We gave 15 dollars in cash and asked to split the rest of the bill in half (Makes 15 dollars each of the other two). My check came back and I saw $15.12 + included gratuity of $2.51. Sure, WHAT!? I don't know how 45-15 = 30 / 2 = 15 would also ADD another tip of $2.51 from my credit card and the other girl who used her card. As my experience before as a server, I was terribly suspicious but the girls were in a hurry and I couldn't complain. I scribbled $15.12 as the total on the card but surprise, surprise, my bank statement today shows $17.63 being charged. I know it's not such big money (as I do spend MUCH MORE at other places) it just makes me irked that the people here would blatantly rip off customers little money at a time, and that is just wrong.  \\n\\nDON'T GO!

For those visiting during Christmas, they have a huge Christmas display where families can get pictures with Santa Claus. \\nDowntown Disney offers a lot of things to do.

Each one he does comes with 3 copies, so you have one for yourself and two to give away to family. For single sitting, the portraits are $12, for doubles the cost is $20 and for triples (three people) the cost is $24. For those who want to get a family of four people done, the cost is $27 and like I said, you get three copies.\\n\\nFor those who are hungry, they offer Sandwiches by Earl of Sandwich, American cuisine by Wolfgang Pucks Express or Grade Cafe, Lava Lounge and my favourites T-Rex, Rainforest Cafe and Planet Hollywood.

I ordered: Super Special Pho? bowl (large), grilled pork spring rolls and a green (sour) apple boba drink. The Pho bowl was excellent, the spring roll was done about 2hrs ago and the rice paper was kinda tough but overall good flavor and the boba drink was good as well (not much to it). I will say the price was a bit high. I can get a larger quantity of food at Huong's on the northside. Buckese Pho's interior was really nice and comfy. It had tables and a bar for single eaters (me). Condiments were available on the table as any other Pho joint. Servers were really nice however looks like a little lunch rush kinda crippled them and a couple that was there was waiting on their food for a while and turned out either the waiter lost their order or just forgot it. At one point a waitress questioned herself if she had gave out the correct order for a to-go customer or did she mis take the order on her paper. This place is new and I think they need to work on their server skills and bring the price down a bit. I see many 4-5 star ratings in this review and I think those are the people that haven't really ventured out to other Vietnamese joints in search of authentic and price effecient restaurants. Go to Huongs and try their restaurant and you'll see the difference. Buckeye Pho has the interior design but overall Vietnamese food goes to Huong's in Columbus area. Some minor tweaks and I can see Buckeye Pho dominating the Vietnamese scene. Good luck!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went here about a month ago.

Not only is their 4 shot Americano cheaper than Starbucks, it tastes a shit load better too.  I get 4 shots of espresso straight at Starbucks to attempt to match Kick Butt's pricing, but it's like drinking vomit.  Shit's gross.  At Kick Butt Coffee, their chilled and skilled baristas (last time I went I was served by a Naiman Rigby, who left a business card with a yelp link to write this review, like a true professional) craft a rich, delicious-not-bitter drink with just as much caffeine as these 4 shots of shit I'm slurping right now.

And, it's right next to the plasma center, so if they'll allow me to drink coffee before donating, I'll be there.  If not, I'll still be there, cos they have a fucking Wii and sweet movies playing in the back.

Yet when I played the Wii last, the audio was routed through the TV.  They should and could definitely fix this.\\n\\nAnd let me talk about Naiman.  While I have a pretty good relationship with the Starbucks staff, the baristas at Kick Butt Coffee are special, and Naiman was the specialist (lol).  He had me cracking up ordering my drinks.

The biggest complaints we have are the beds, the information given about parking, and the elevators. First, the bed we had was horrible. It was an old spring bed. When laying on it, I think the middle was higher than where my head was. I sat down on one edge and the middle popped up. Just a very uncomfortable bed. Next, we called 30 minutes before arriving and were told parking was available for $40 or valet. When we arrived, the garage was closed and valet said they could no longer accept cars. This would have been OK if we knew before as I would have just reserved something on Spot Hero, but instead we ended up in a rush to try to get to a new parking spot before the event we were attending started. Last, at one point it took 6-8 minutes for an elevator to arrive going from floor 2 to floor 11. That's an excessive amount of time.

The person at the counter being asked this question.  Hundreds of times.\\n\\nBut I digress.\\n\\nFirst, I'll say I really like the decor.  If you've been to our house since we renovated, you'll know that clean and modern lines are what we like, and Sala & Betty, both inside and on the covered patio, does that in spades.\\n\\nHere's what Sala & Betty does well:\\n- Consistent, tasty food\\n- Brought out fairly quickly\\n- Options for those wanting to be a bit healthier\\n- Prices that won't break the bank\\n\\nI've been three times.  First time was a workday lunch with fellow foodie Shannon B., since we had an errand in that direction to run.  Order at the counter, grab your beverage, wait for the food to be brought out (it was a nice March day, so we were on the patio).  The man who brought out our food seemed to always be thinking about what might make our experience better.  We just ordered a couple things and shared.  The cauliflower soup was smooth and tasty.  The play on shrimp and grits was great, as was the \\"Betty\\" (the slow roasted pork sandwich).  Total tab $25.\\n\\nMy next visit I was just driving by, and grabbed a \\"Mr. T.\\" to go (a smoked Wagyu sirloin sandwich).  Now, the menu states it comes with a \\"bleu cheese sauce\\", which if my memory serves has horseradish, which complemented it very well. Where I always keep forgetting is that the menu says the sandwiches say they come with french fries.  When I got home and looked in my box, I was like... Dang, they forgot my fries.  But they put the fries ON the sandwich, it's not like a side order.  So, if you really like fries, you apparently should order an extra side of them (or grab from McDonald's on your way home!). \\n\\nOur last visit there was dinner with my wife and a friend.  My wife paired the mussels app with a side of garlic smashed potatoes (to pour the lovely mussels juice onto), and loved it.  I went with the fried chicken biscuit (with an over easy egg on top) which I devoured, though I think with the bacon could have used a little less salt.  Our friend is on a special diet, and the option to order meat \\"by the pound\\" worked well for her.  Her 1/4 lb. of sirloin was nicely pink, and tasty.  Since she wouldn't eat much of what would be served on a sandwich, at under $5 a la carte, it was a good value as well.  So much so that she picked up some more to-go a couple days later using the quick and simple drive-thru window.\\n\\nI'm not sure what to think about the other review from the couple that left hungry and went to grab burgers on the way home because they didn't want to spend \\"another $75\\" to get more food here.  Sure, we had tea and not a beer/wine, but in that last visit, the three of us walked away happy for about $15 a head.  With no specific mention of food items, and continual mentioning of the \\"North Burnet\\" area, maybe that reviewer was thinking about one of the other \\"noun & noun\\" named places popping up these days.\\n\\nHere's what I'm not as much of a fan of:\\nThe table service at dinner time.  The staff was friendly and all, especially to the regulars that were there.  But maybe too friendly, as conversations at other tables meant our drinks weren't refilled as quickly as we'd like.  Which led us to the discussion amongst ourselves that \\"I could just walk over to the fountain where I get my own drink at lunch\\" awkwardness.  It just seems to me that the efficiency of the counter-service at lunch outweighed the \\"benefit\\" of full-service at dinner.  The owners, and maybe even everyone else, might disagree.\\n\\nI don't live close, but I do appreciate how folks that do might frequently come here.  I probably wouldn't drive across town to go there, but it's a great place if I'm going nearby for some other reason, or if I'm meeting a friend which would make this a convenient choice. \\n\\n3.65 stars"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a very popular brunch place!

Unfortunately so many places do not make them right, so finding a good cannoli can be a bit of a pain. When in Boston, though, it doesn't get any better than Mike's. And though I have been steered to Modern many times, I think Mike's wins every time.\\n\\nUnless you happen to catch a down time, you enter somewhat organized chaos inside. Lines are self-forming, and you work your way to one of the folks behind the counter to take your order. The line moves surprisingly quickly, and it helps to know what you want. The staff can come across as rude at times, but I feel like that is part of the charm of a Boston based Italian pastry shop. And to their credit they are quite efficient at getting your order ready and packed up, which enables the lines to move as fast as they do.\\n\\nI always order cannolis aplenty. The chocolate dipped ricotta filled are my absolute favorite. I also enjoy the mint chocolate ricotta, pecan caramel, and also the less rich chocolate and vanilla custard / pudding varieties. Truthfully, though, I haven't had a bad option, but I definitely prefer the richer ricotta-based filling. Mike's has many things besides cannolis as well, though I have only branched out to a couple of things: pizelles and ricotta pie. The pizelles are nice and crispy, and the vanilla flavor is yummy! The ricotta pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts (and also a pie that is very difficult to do right), and Mike's does it very well, and for a reasonable price to boot!\\n\\nMike's is well known and a touristy place, but unlike many tourist traps it is well worth the price of admission. Do keep in mind that they only accept cash, so you need to come prepared. Once you understand how to get in line and what to order, the ordering process is pretty straightforward. Items do add up quickly ($5 for a chocolate dipped ricotta cannoli, and I usually get 10!), but the quality is so high that you find you don't mind it so much. The cannolis themselves (and pizelles and ricotta pie; I actually haven't tried anything else) are utterly amazing and about as good as it gets. If you have never had a cannoli or adore them as I do and don't mind a bit of craziness with crowds, then you need to get your taste buds over to Mike's, and leave your scale behind!"},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"We came here the first day we were in Orlando.

I actually rather liked the flavor of the spicy sesame, but the tofu was bland. I also liked the noodles themselves, and I liked the ginger in the soup. The meal was kind of underwhelming, and my husband (who ordinarily cleans his plate and mine) didn't even finish his bowl. I didn't like the self-bussing situation--you have to put spoons in one place, bowls in another, trash in the bin, pour any remaining liquid into a bin--it's a bit gross and complicated. There's also an area with children's toys (thank goodness there were no kids there to play!), but the redeeming quality is that the gal working was meticulously wiping down all of the toys at the end of the night.

I went to this restaurant for dinner (Sun July 26/15) because of the reviews I read and the reviews by a couple of people that I know that have been going to this restaurant for some time now. \\n\\nThe restaurant was 'too full' for our party of 4 but we only had to wait 5 minutes to get seated. After being seated in the backroom, we were pretty much forgotten. Even after another group of 4 was seated next to us. When WE were seated, we received the appetizer menu, that's it. THE OTHER party of 4 got an appetizer menu & entr√©es menu AND drink menu, AND they were given 4 glasses of water! We sat there watching this, thinking the server would give us a glance but he just left the room. Keep in mind, as previously stated, this is an old house converted to a restaurant so this room is the size of a small bedroom so it's not like the server can't know we're sitting there. \\n\\nAnyway, my husband got up to get an entr√©es menu so that we could order everything at once, because the first 20 mins was already an indication of how long the food would probably take to get to us. But then it still took my husband having to get up AGAIN to hunt 1 of the 2 servers down to say \\"Is someone coming to take our order, or should we just leave?!\\" before someone finally paid attention to us. At this time, I asked for 4 waters and a drink menu, and even the server said \\"Oh, you should've been served water already.\\" Uh, YEAH WE SHOULD'VE BEEN! (which I did say) AND HE WAS THE ONE THAT SAT US! We placed our orders promptly, and he did come back in good time to get our drink orders. We were given complimentary chips and salsa to apologize for the wait we had, which was very nice of him. Our food came shortly after, so there wasn't a long wait for that. Although, we did finish all of our food (because we were soooo hungry for waiting so long to eat), all the dishes were very bland. I felt like there was nothing to it, no seasoning, nothing. We ordered: 4 tacos-carnita, fish and steak (2) ceviche from the Starters Menu, then 2 quesadillas, chilorio tostadas and beef enchiladas from the Entr√©es menu. The food was not awful (like I said we were also all very hungry by the time all of our food arrived) but for $80+ that it cost us, there was just NOTHING TO THE DISHES. \\n\\nEven listening to the table next to us, you could tell they weren't happy either. The soups they ordered were given to another table. A dish they wanted they couldn't have because the kitchen ran of it. It was ridiculous. \\n\\nLastly, it has been mentioned that this is an old house and it really is.

I guess because they are so busy on the weekends that's all they care about.  Well, they need to know that people are not flocking there for the food.  It's the view and sunsets.

The smell was fantastic and there was a small lineup of 3 people, which at 9:45pm surprised me, and I LOVE trying out new kinds of Japanese food, so I headed in.\\n\\nThe cashier was very patient with my ignorance and I quickly decided on a teriyaki box with spicy miso and a side of 2 kushi (japanese for kebab) and miso soup.\\n\\nFirst surprise was the miso soup! IMHO its rather clever, but I was VERY surprised when the little styrofoam coffeecup I recieved felt rather ... empty. Peeking inside to see how much (or how little) they had given me, I found 2 foil pouches! The miso paste and seaweed were packaged seperately! A quick glance around located the hot-water carafe in the corner. I was irritated tearing the packaged with my teeth (scissors would be nice) but the resulting miso _was_ tasty and if i were rushing off to the office at lunchtime, I'd definitely appreciate the option of NOT spilling hot soup all over myself.\\n\\nUnfortunatey, further surprises ensued. I got home to open my bag of goodies and found that the two kushi skewers I got were NOT what I ordered. I went for the tofu and the mushroom skewers and got the teriyaki-chicken and the chicken-meatballs. The meatballs were DELICIOUS. The chicken was good. I'd order both again, but I was looking forward to tofu and mushrooms. Not a good substitution especially if one happens to be Vegetarian.\\n\\nThe big box was wrong too. I must've been given someone else's dinner. It was chock full of lots of 'stuff' which I couldn't identify. Looking at their website I can only imagine that it was the Mega box. Not at all spicy, but there was a nice little plastic container full of salty black sauce which I happily drizzled all over the contents (I used about half of the contents for the whole box).\\n\\nAs for whatever was in the box, it was tasty. I'm probably not a fan of the pork cheeks (p-toro): the mega box has a bit of everything inside, and there was one texture that made me think \\"gotta be pork cheeks\\"; but I'm not a fan of tuna toro either. The half-boiled egg was nice once mixed in with everything and I found some more of those super tasty meatballs. Other people have commented on the quality of rice, so I will voice the fact that my rice was perfectly done.\\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't choose that box again, but I enjoyed it. Will definitely go back and give 'em another shot, but I hope they sort out their kinks fast!

We indicated that we be glad to sit at the first available table so we were immediately seated outside. Unfortunately, I think there was some miscommunication between the servers as our table and some of the other outdoor tables were not being attended to by the wait staff. It took between 10-15 minutes for someone to take our order. It then took about 30 minutes for our order to be served. Only other real negative was that it was a beautiful sunny day and the outdoor tables did not have any type of covering so even though it was still in the morning the sun was a little brutal. I'd recommend they get some umbrellas or some type of outdoor cover. \\n\\nThose slightly negative comments aside we enjoyed our meal. I ordered the omelet du jur which on this day was a Denver styled omelet. It was delicious and came with toast and potatoes which were also very good.

Personally, I prefer the cannoli leftover because the shell gets softer but apparently that's the authentic way to go. Cannolis were good. I had so many, mostly chocolate. I liked them slightly more than hazelnut and espresso because of the stronger taste of those two. Cr√®me Brulee was also sweet but not torched on top. It was good but I prefer it torched. I was disappointed by the cakes. I had red velvet and Turtle cupcakes. The frosting was too sweet (especially the Turtle) with a very typical and forgettable taste. The red velvet didn't come with a cream cheese frosting, but that's my fault for not asking. The cake was nothing memorable. Not moist, not buttery... just \\"cake\\". Very forgettable also. Live and learn but I must say their customer service is patient, quick and kind. Sunday at 3pm and weekdays seem like the best time to go, but forget Saturdays! I tried and walked past it on two separate occasions because it's just too busy even though they're quick. I can say that their lines could be a lot more organized, like a \\"Line Starts Here\\" sign or something.

Let me explain..\\n\\nI had been going to the Atomic Cafe in Beverly since I was in high school (over 10 years ago) and had loved the coffee and atmosphere there. I've always appreciated mom & pop kind of places and this place had character with student art on the walls and a bar where people would have a sandwich and listen to good music. In short, it felt like a cool neighborhood coffee shop in the burbs that had been transplanted from the city.\\n\\nNow the Marblehead location. Still like the coffee and food. Baristas are mostly friendly. Yet, the place has a bit of an identity crisis. On one hand, it's staff, decor, & music suggest it's a place that invites a young crowd to hang out, maybe come and get some work done. Yet, the signs on the table, telling folks to not stick around and hoard the tables, gives the impression that it's more of a lunch place, which seems consistent with the older and family crowds that frequent the cafe. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it seems like the place draws people in because it's hip yet doesn't encourage those who give it hip cred to hang out (full disclosure: I'm not exactly hip). So it ends up being a good spot to visit in non-busy hours, as others have pointed out. \\n\\nAll in all, Atomic Cafe is a local business to support and a great place to have a bite to eat and enjoy a cup of coffee, albeit, not for too long."},{"name":"Hapa Izakaya - Yaletown","address":"1193 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here on a Tuesday for happy hour to catch up with some friends.

I am now over half way done, and figure it is only fair to write reviews for them. \\n\\nIt mostly definitely lives up to its claim of fancy Barbecue. First it is a beautiful building and very elegant, but still very much Texas and a backyard feel. Services was great, and other than being in there for over an hour for lunch, everything ran smoothly. \\n\\nWe had both the queso and deviled eggs appetizers. The deviled eggs could be the bets I ever had. Too many times I try deviled eggs that taste more like pickles than eggs, people just don't make them correctly. They were perfect here, eggs were great, and they added caviar to the top which gave a great saltiness without having to add actual salt. \\n\\nI ordered the three meat plate so I could try my standard brisket and sausage and get something else, of which I picked ribs. Start with the ribs, which were cooked perfectly (something that many barbecue places can't do correctly, leaving them either dry or soft and stringy). The rub on them was great and they had an explosive flavor, my only negative thing was they were not very meaty. I have gotten use to the thick ribs, and these seemed kind of thin on the meat. The brisket was very good. The fat in them were delicious, and I was glad to see that they did not cut all of it off, which I was afraid a restaurant trying to be fancy may do. The rub on these were fantastic, great sweetness and strong flavors. Only problem with these was I could not taste any real smokiness, although it did have a nice smoke ring around the crust. The sausage was fantastic. It had a great sweet flavor to it, and was perfectly packed in the casing yet still very moist and soft to eat. Sausage was the highlight. The sauce was also a sweet flavor, and the little I tried was good, but didn't mix well with the already sweet rubs on the meats. \\n\\nMy sides were macaroni and cheese, which was good but nothing special, and waffle fries. These were some great fries, the batter on it was some of the best I have every had, crunchy and soft. Nice spices on them also. I also tried my fathers sides, beans and cole slaw. Both were good. \\n\\nThis was much different than the hole in the walls and family barbecue places of Texas, but amazing none the less. Prices are very high, especially for barbecue, which already can run moderate to high at some places.

In 2018, there are similar levels among thousands of tea houses in Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta. It's no more than 5-6, the reason is complicated. I don't think I was lucky enough to eat it in Boston. It's like eating a dusty memory. It's like going back in time for decades, and there's nothing wrong with the barbecue.

It exceeded our expectations and tasted amazingly as well.  \\n\\nOnto the bad parts now.  Honestly, they're not deal breakers, but here they are.

With that said, I never want to dine here for another Mother's Day, a similar semi-holiday, ever again.\\nHands down, the best time to go is when they are not actually busy.\\n\\nThe wait:\\n-You can expect their storefront to be congested during brunch on the weekends, so imagine what it is like on these holiday Sundays.  \\n-I anticipated an hour wait because we did not arrive right when they opened, so that was fine.  The host was on mark with his estimate. \\n-Don't bother sitting at the park benches at the school next door, or have one person of your party firmly stationed at the storefront, while you wait!  As the speaker system that can only be heard directly in front of the restaurant.  \\n\\nThe service:\\n-The male host was pleasant during this morning rush, but the female hostess was very stressed out and it was quite apparent in her demeanor.  The good news is that she was only dismissive.  \\n-The erratic thing is the male host called names out the door, which I heard clearly throughout my hour long wait.  This lead me to believe that was a normal practice.  Apparently not, which resulted in my poor experience with said female hostess.\\n\\n-The server was nice.  We did have to ask for bagel chips instead of getting them upon being greeted.  Sometimes it took a while to get her attention, but that was to be expected.\\n\\nThe food:\\n-The omelet was good.\\n-My potato pancake tasted burnt, but I am OK with that.  Another order at our table was undercooked in the middle and kind of gross.\\n-The chocolate french bread was very dry.  I'm not sure if it was actually dipped in custard/ egg wash at all due to it's lack of moisture.\\n-The grilled banana bread had a peculiar looking extra gooey chuck of banana that looked suspicious because the rest of the bread was not THAT moist.  I was asked by the person whom ordered it to check to see if it was rotten.  I didn't think so... \\n\\nThe ambiance:\\neclectic, nice... but a coat of paint is overdue on some of the more high traffic areas/ corners.\\nThe bathrooms are claustrophobic, but cleaner than others.\\n\\nOverall:  This is still a solid restaurant, and this was a single poor experience.

It more so depends on your own personal taste preferences when it comes to which are better than others. There's always one seasonal donut, and I'd always recommend getting at least one because, why not, but otherwise, my favorite donuts are the Dirty Wu, the cinnamon sugar and the honey.

Having the privilege of staying at less than 1/4 miles away from Mike's Pastry, a short walk to the humbled offerings of this establishment is one that must be partaken.\\n\\nThe decor:  Expect nothing more than the traditional modest establishment for most bakeries.  Mike's Pastry is a representation that their reputation is based on their consumable offerings, rather than the ambiance of the establishment.  Patrons will discover that the modestly sized establishment houses 6-7 tables for waiter service for dine ins only.  Customers wishing to make a purchase must find seating at a secondary locale.  The dine in area of the establishment is by nature cramped, not to mention the high turnover rate.  Seating is confined to the semi-sturdy (but rocky) metal chairs from the early 1950's.  Although a bit cluttered, the display and mass array of products available for purchase are neatly displayed throughout the bakery.  Patrons will be delighted to find over 6 variations of cheesecake and Cannoli (amongst other noteables).\\n\\nThe Food:\\n\\nVanilla Cream Cannoli w/ Chocolate Chip:  Despite the acclaim labeled upon this offering, the combination and taste and execution of this Cannoli failed to stimulate the palate praise during consumption.  At first bite, patrons will find that although the dough exterior is crispy in structure, the taste ultimate creates too much of a contrasts against the heavy vanilla cream.  Patrons will discover that the taste of the crispy exterior is remarkably similar to that of fried noodles found at Chinese restaurants.  The most discerning aspect in the taste is the burdensome corpulent sugar palatableness derived from the cream.  Given that the dough exterior might be an accomplice to this, the cream seemed excessively heavy and had an overtly excessive sugar taste.  Furthermore, the perfectly cooked dough exterior failed to hold it's composition when consumed in conjunction with the cream.  With each additional bite, patrons will find that the excessive amount of cream used in the application oppresses all other elements of the Cannoli.  Overall, the application failed to produce the balance and execution of a well prepared Cannoli.  Although each individual aspect segmented were produced with grace, the combination of all elements both in composition and taste failed to produce the harmonious balance required for a great Cannoli.\\n\\nBlack & White Cookie:  Similar to the Cannoli, the Black & White Cookie possessed the same execution flaw in that the ingredients used in the application lacked balanced.  Consuming patrons will find that although the Vanilla and Chocolate frosting used on the Cookie was well produced in both taste (not excessive sugary) and texture (semi-creamy), the exorbitant amount of cake batter used in it's production overshadowed the praiseful elements of this consumable.  Patrons will find during consumption that although the frosting produces the mild sweetness in both the Vanilla and Chocolate flavors, such flavors become overshadowed by the turbulent amount of cake used in the application.  Ultimate the proportionate balance of ingredients needs to be revisited in order to create a well construction black and white cookie.  Although the taste of all elements was remarkable, the structural composition flaw failed to bring out every aspect of the application when consumed in conjunction.\\n\\nDespite the notoriety yielded upon Mike's Pastry, the execution and pungency of the taste (in addition to the balance of the ingredients) failed to meet standards.  Perhaps their other offerings such as cheesecake and butter cookies will produce a different appeal.  Nevertheless, the initial thought of both the Cannoli and Black & White Cookies did not appeal to the taste buds."},{"name":"3 Country Bistro","address":"379 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is really small, but don't let that fool you.

The boyfriend and I each had a bottle of honey beer (pretty refreshing and not overly sweet), and 20 minutes later, the appetizer combo of sambusas and a fried lentil thingy arrived, both were delish....though maybe not quite worth the wait. Another 15 minutes later, the entree arrived.  The bf and I split the combo platter for two, which was definitely more than enough food--we have a huge hunk of injera waiting for us at home. This was just okay--we ordered the lamb in curry sauce, and I have absolutely no idea what the rest was, as it didn't say on the menu and our waiter didn't tell us.  Some was a little bland, but none of it was bad. The lamb was good, if heavy on the rosemary (though I love rosemary!!) There was one veggie dish that had mushrooms in it---I was surprised, as I didn't know that large mushrooms grew in Ethiopia, but it's not like I'm an expert. It was okay.  The red lentils were good.\\nIt has a pretty great location in the new Vanport Square, with outdoor seating for the glorious summer days (when they come).

Too bad that when I was a kid, the seafood buffets were only 19.99$ if I recall correctly. Anyways that obviously isn't the price anymore and now they cost around 40$.\\n\\nWe came on a Tuesday night and were seated right away. The waitress took our drinks and also let us know of a couple of items that were included in the buffet, but weren't out on the line. You can order as many of these items as you want since they are included in your price and I definitely recommend this. We ordered French fries and hushpuppies as sides. They came out fresh and hot. \\n\\nI know people come here mainly for the lobster and that was pretty much why I came as well. I was excited about all you can eat lobster so I picked that up first. As I bit into my lobster, my excitement quickly went away. It was tough, rubbery, and overcooked. I finished it anyways even though it was an extremely subpar lobster. After my first lobster, I was torn. Should I go up for another mediocre lobster or just eat other things on the buffet line? Unfortunately, I chose to get another lobster. As I finished up my second lobster, I decided I couldn't take eating any more rubber so I gave up. I was really disappointed because I wanted to get my money's worth and eat my weight in lobsters that night, but I just couldn't do it. \\n\\nI resorted to eating snow crab instead, which proved to be a slightly better experience. Mid-meal, the staff brought out a freshly steamed bucket of snow crab, so if you're lucky and this happens during your meal, go and grab as much crab as you can! I worked through a couple of clusters before giving up, but it was a lot better than eating rubbery lobster. I then proceeded to eat my weight in snow crab, which isn't very much because I'm a pretty small person. The snow crab clusters made up somewhat for my not so exciting lobster experience. \\n\\nI tried other things on the buffet line, such as the fried clams, shrimp, and desserts (flan). These items were okay. Another unfortunate thing was that my fiance isn't much of a lobster fan, so we lost out on his buffet as well. When the check came, it ended up being 90$ for two buffets + tip. Our trip to this seafood buffet was a total buffet FAIL!\\n\\nOverall, I felt pretty ripped off because the lobsters weren't even that good, and they were the main reason why the prices were so high. I give them two stars because I made the waitress bring us several items from the back of the kitchen, so I felt as though I worked her a bit. However, I don't think I will be coming back to this place again. I would rather take my 90$ to a fancy restaurant where they can prepare a lobster properly and with the correct seasonings and sauces. What an expensive trip down memory lane...

They also have wings plus side options. That's when I would opt to sauce 'em up. \\n\\nSpeaking of sides! The best damn collards I've had west of the Mississippi. Cooked down in traditional southern style, chopped into large pieces, and flavored to perfection with smokey pork, onions, and salt. Don't even need to dash vinegar on these babies. And, for $3 (all sides same price) the serving is large and can easily be shared by two. Next visit, I'm definitely going for a mac attack.\\n\\nThe RR offers HH M-F from 5-7 with various drink specials. On Tuesday and Thursday nights from 7- close they have a DJ and domino tables, respectively, and a reverse HH with $3 drinks (anybody up for a \\"Dirty Rooster?\\") and $3 apps including fried pickles, Rooster pups, gizzards and such. Highly recommend. Support local. :)\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n*In retrospect, during my first visit. l would probably have opted for one of their many combo plates to sample many items at once. No worries, as I'm pretty sure I'll make my way through their menu in short enough time.        \\n**If you see oxtails on a menu, order them! \\n***Brunch coming soon...after they complete their sister restaurant, Cracking Crab, in Pflugerville."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very good sfogliatelle and cannoli.

She went to university in London, plus our family lived in southwest England for a time, so she loves and misses the traditional afternoon teas that are so commonplace over there. I had researched my options in Atlanta. While there were not many, I thought Astor Court offered a higher-end experience for a not-too-crazy price tag. Plus, I didn't want to go all the way downtown for the Four Seasons.\\n\\nI, too, initially called the reservation number and received an automated message stating that I could make a reservation on OpenTable. I did, and a few days later someone from Astor Court called to confirm and ask if anyone in our party had special dietary restrictions. I told him no. A few days later, I ended up calling them because I wanted to notify them that I was pregnant, and therefore probably couldn't eat anything with smoked salmon or runny eggs or the like. I also said my mom would have the same food preference (as a matter of taste, not because she is also pregnant). I guess they typically do have someone manning the phone, because I called the same number as I had before when I received the automated message.\\n\\nAnyway, the day came and I drove us over. Parking was confusing... I did not want to valet (if only I had read the reviews here first! Did not realize valet was validated or that it was a cheaper option than the parking deck). I ended up parking in the deck behind the hotel. It appeared to be a general parking deck and not the one for the hotel. The one for the hotel looked to be valet-only. We walked over and made it just in time for our reservation.\\n\\nService was indeed slowwww. We were greeted right away and told that someone would be there to start the service, but it took forever for that person to get there! We were offered our scones first before the teas even arrived. I opted for the Mad Hatter's Tea Party and my mom chose the St. Regis Peach Blend. Initially, they did not leave the pots with us so we had to wait for them to come back to refill our cups -- that was a pain. Thankfully, after the first refill they left our pots behind (I would have asked them to, anyway). The tea I chose was delicious. Scones were also delicious, particularly the vanilla strawberry flavor. Very much enjoyed them with the clotted cream and lemon curd.\\n\\nEventually, they brought out the tower of sandwiches and desserts. My eyes fell upon the layer of sandwiches and I asked the gentleman holding the tower if smoked salmon was among the sandwiches. He confirmed yes, and I explained to him that I had called Astor Court to tell them I specifically could not eat smoked salmon due to my pregnancy. He stammered out an apology, mentioned that he had seen in the reservation that I was pregnant but it did not mention anything about smoked salmon. Ugh. He asked what extra sandwiches I would like to replace the smoked salmon. I opted for an extra egg salad and an extra turkey & gouda. My mom stage-whispered to me that the gentleman appeared annoyed and pissed that he had to go back into the kitchen to replace the sandwiches, but I didn't really notice.\\n\\nOnce we got our replacement tower, I tried just about every one of the sandwiches except the tomato-basil. My favorite by far was the egg salad, and I thought the turkey & gouda was pretty good, except the wheat bread was a bit stale. As for desserts, I only had enough room to try the orange & honey torte -- I was not a fan. Too sweet and dry. \\n\\nMy mom commented that it was outrageously expensive for what we ate, but she was soon mollified when her sister in Australia told her that full afternoon teas such as the one at Astor Court are priced like that normally, and were like that in Australia as well. \\n\\nOverall, slow service aside, my mom and I had a great time just chatting and spending time together. I don't regret visiting Astor Court, but I probably won't be back.  \\n\\nFYI - Parking ended up being $10 which was not horrible considering we were there an hour and a half."},{"name":"WingHouse of International Drive","address":"7308 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I came to the grand opening in with very impressed with the service and the food.

I'm not sure it's a destination coffeehouse so much as it is a loose community center. Yes, expect toddlers, some of them much less closely parented than others, although most are under control and well behaved. I was a toddler once so I generally don't fault kids for being kids and parents for being parents. Posies is perfectly upfront about being so kid friendly--complete with a play-room and daytime story and song times, and their name is arguably reminiscent of a children's song (\\"a pocket full of posies,\\" anyone?). I find the customers to be a pretty polite and friendly bunch, and most parents are on top of their midgets when they head into personal space violation territory, so I don't much see value in complaining about the obvious--the place is kid friendly, get over it.\\n\\nKid free times do exist, and during those times (generally before 9am on the weekends), Posies is an oasis of studious calm. That's generally when my partner, the dog, and I go, nursing hangovers (not the dog) and gradually grumbling to wakefulness, thanks in no small part to Posies's delicious coffee and excellent croissants.\\n\\nOtherwise: Good food, especially the breakfast biscuits (if you can stand the grease) and croissants, and excellent coffee, although both run a bit more, pricewise, than I find myself paying at similar venues in the city (except Stumptown--Posies's prices are very comparable to Stumptown's). Coffees run $2 and up, pastries run in the neighborhood of $3, and breakfast sammies float between $6 and $7.\\n\\nThe place can echo, so on a busy morning it isn't intimate nor is it quiet, but overall I'm happy with the ambiance of the place. The staff can be a bit surly at times, others they can be quite friendly and helpful--just like any other Portland coffeeshop. I concur that they could call out readied drink and food orders a bit more loudly.\\n\\nOverall, I like the place and I'm glad it's in my 'hood."},{"name":"Massimino's","address":"207 Endicott St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Disgusting over priced food.

I ordered two pizzas, one with meat and one without, an Italian sub and a 2 liter of coke for delivery. The guy on the phone was nice, and I'm always thankful for that. However, the pizza was thin, greasy, and lacking taste. It was cardboard-like and reminded me of chuck-e-cheese pizza. The sub was good though.

My usual stop for cheap and delicious banh mi is at Quoc Huong, but when we stopped there around 6:30 PM on Saturday, they were already out of rolls for the night. We still wanted banh mi, though, so we made the drive down south to Lee's Bakery.\\n\\nParking isn't too bad, the front parking is limited but to the side of the main plaza is plenty of parking.\\n\\nPrices here are a little steeper than its competitors along Buford Highway. The menus and the patrons are more Americanized, as well. The servers speak much better English, and besides the servers, I believe my friend and I were the only Asians in the entire restaurant, which I found interesting.\\n\\nI ordered a beef noodle soup (pho) and my friend ordered a banh mi. There is a combo for about .50 cents off if you order the pho and banh mi combo, but you only get half the banh mi so we decided against it.\\n\\nBanh mi is cheaper if you take it to go, and even cheaper if you buy 5 get 1 free. It seemed like a shame to eat it in store. There were daikon in this one, which I wish they had in the Quoc Huong banh mi, but there was something in the flavors of the sandwich that was different. Not bad different, but not necessarily good, either. But the crispy toasted bread they use really is top notch.\\n\\nThe pho broth was clearer than the broths from other restaurants. I liked the flavor, and the meat was good. The price hurt my heart a little bit since it's about $1 more all around, but not significant enough to complain - I know, I know I'm complaining.\\n\\nI sadly don't think I will make my way to Lee's as much as I would hope, seeing as there are much closer and cheaper Vietnamese restaurants to me. However, for those who live closeby and prefer not to make the trek up with the lousy drivers on Buford Highway, Lee's Bakery is your best bet."},{"name":"Astor Court","address":"88 W Paces Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great brunch!!

The main room is small and noisy, crowded with people ordering food and waiting for their orders.  Bollywood music videos are blaring from the television.  A large menu dominates the wall behind the cash register, featuring the huge variety of dishes you can order.  \\n\\nPro tip: look for a paper menu if you're not an expert on Indian cuisine.  Their paper menu includes descriptions of the dishes and not just their Hindi-derived names.  The menu is extensive and organized loosely by the type of dish (appetizers, entrees, breads, platters) and ingredients (meat, vegetarian).  I recognized most of the dishes from my favorite Indian haunts around the country, but there were some new things!  This place has some dishes with eggs (anda) and that was entirely new and exciting to me!  They also have lassis (yogurt drinks) in a wide range of tasty flavors beyond the standard ones.\\n\\nYou wait in line, order, wait some more, and then get your order on some awesome metal cafeteria-style trays.  Since you have to carry your food to the upstairs dining area (unless you're lucky enough to score one of the few downstairs seats), this serving style means you don't have to juggle a bunch of plates and bowls and whatnot.  The upstairs area is fairly roomy and much quieter than downstairs.\\n\\nThe food we ordered was really delicious.  The bread was crisp and fresh, and the rice was perfect (and I am picky about basmati rice).  We ordered two dishes, Lamb Shahi Korma and Vegetable Platter, and both were really tasty.  Our mango lassi was excellent, though I regret getting mango instead of guava or pineapple!  I didn't notice them until after we'd ordered.

Would be nice if all the tables were properly spaced apart because I noticed other tables had more room between them.\\nAnyways, onto the food. We had never had Bun cha ca so it was nice to try, the veggies are some that I don't believe I've had before. And the broth was pretty good. Everyone has different taste buds and my cousin LOVES this place, but for me and my fianc√© it was o.k."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Better cannolis than modern.

The food came to be about $30, my partner had the non-veg tiffin box and I had the green chili chicken. This is pretty standard pricing for the area for take out places.\\nThey threw in free chutneys that tasted pretty fresh (tamarind chutney not too thin) and a tasty what seemed like a house made pickle. They also gave us a nice quarter cup of kheer for free which was very tasty! It was like opening up your brown bag lunch to find out mom gave you a treat for a surprise.\\nI like that they had a few tables to sit at which isn't the case for some take out areas nearby. I asked about the music which didn't seem to be on at the time and the man at the front said that they were waiting approval for the music. hah! Good ol' New Englander prudish traditions...\\nThey had some cute colorful murals that looked new on the walls.\\nThe guy at the front also said they had another location in Maynard.\\n\\nThe chicken in my dish was tender and white meat which the guy at the front said, they have for everything which is great for me since I'm trying to watch my health! The chicken keema and tandoor was all out which we desperately wanted to try. Apparently the keema is very popular so we gotta come back for it.\\n\\nMy partner's dish was the tiffin box and he said the vegetable one had less flavor than the chicken one which, after sampling his sauce, I can agree. That being said, I'm not sad to have it for leftovers today.\\nThe roti we ordered was just okay. Tasted a bit too much like tortillas for us, but I'll give them a try sometime when I can eat inside. Freshly made and eaten makes a big difference when it comes to breads. Anyways, was grateful also that they gave us two for each order. Again.. did I mention I love leftovers? Rice was also coming with the order which is becoming less and less than standard with take out places so I'm grateful.\\n\\nOverall, a great start for this business.

It was about 8- we didn't want dinner, just a place to munch, drink, and talk.  The restaurant was about half full, and we were seated immediately.  The booth was nice, and  I like the variety of the decor: small and big booths, some tables, some plush leather chairs around a table.  Our waitress seemed friendly and took our drink order.  I ordered a mango margarita and a water.  Our drinks came out quickly, with the exception of my water.  We ordered the nachos to split among the 3 of us.  25 minutes later we got the nachos.  It seems strange that it would take that long for something that is on the appetizers menu- aren't appetizers supposed to be fast?  A different server brought out the nachos, and I asked her for a water, which she quickly brought over.  We did not see our waitress for a long time after that.  Our nachos were long gone by the time she showed up and got us some drink refills at which point we asked for the bill.  Getting the bill also involved a wait of 10 minutes.  So overall, \\nmy review is a focus on the service.  Everyone seemed nice- but it's a mystery why this took so long.  Was this a situation where the waitress was pissed that we weren't ringing up a big bill?  Well- the fact is that we were also going to do dessert, but decided to skip that due to the length of time we spent waiting.\\n\\nAs for the food.  The nachos were good- but a little greasy.  There was a \\nliberal amount of jalapenos- which we were all appreciative of.  The \\npresentation is nice- sour cream and salsa come in two tortilla shells. And while the plate is big- the layer of chips and cheese were spread thin, and I'm not sure that the quantity matched the price of $16.  I will say that the mango margarita was awesome.  Sugar lined the rim of the cup- and the overall flavor was great.  \\n\\nBecause it was my first time here I don't know if this service is customary or a rare exception.

Hmm, sounds a little bit like wine from a box.  I am equally skeptical of both.  But, unlike wine from a box, sushi from THIS particular trailer was not a compromise between taste and value.  Ah, my apologies, dear Franzia drinkers, if that makes me sound like a snob yet again.\\n\\nTwitter has been abuzz about this little trailer in East Austin for months, now.  I sampled some of its offerings this week and I whole-heartedly approve.  We ordered the following rolls:\\n\\nTrio (tune, salmon, yellowtail)\\nDynamite (spicy tuna)\\nCrunchy Dynamite (same as Dynamite, plus crunchy tempura)\\nSunshine (tuna, mango, avocado)\\nSummertime (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna mix, avocado)\\n\\nThey all tasted fresh, but the Trio was definitely my favorite.  The Wife liked the Sunshine.  The Dynamite was our least favorite, although it was still pretty decent.  And, therein lies the main reason for the 5 Star review:  fresh sushi to go doesn't come better than this.  No, it's not better than a top sushi restaurant.  It's better than what you'd buy to-go at Wholefoods or Central Market, though.  The price for our 5 rolls came out to be $25, thanks to the 15% Off rain discount from Twitter.  Price it out...that's a great deal for good tasting sushi.  \\n\\nThe only downside is that they remain open only as long as their supplies last.  If there's hypothetically a huge lunch crowd, the trailer might close before 5 if they're out of fish.  In order to sell fresh sushi, they don't keep a large stock that could remain unsold at the end of the day.  What that means is that, when you get a spontaneous urge for sushi, you need to make sure that they're still open because it's possible that they're already closed.

Honestly, who runs out of cheese before 10 am?\\n\\nAnd here is my only criticism of Clover (and hence the one docked star): they never seem to have everything on their menu.

I've been here a few times before, and the service and quality is pretty consistent. Large windows allow a lot of sunlight in during the day, and by night you can expect candles lit at each table for a more intimate atmosphere.\\n\\nI'll be honest, while the drinks are good, they are a little pricey. That's why I said it's good for a couple of drinks. Not a place you should go if you're tight on budget.\\n\\nThe Isabella drink under their \\"Delicates\\" section was anything but. I could handle it though, but delicate was the wrong word to describe this drink. And if it is delicate, then you can expect the other drinks to be even stronger. It was tangy and the ginger was quite strong. If you're not a fan of real ginger, or bitters, I would suggest sticking with what you know, as they can be generously used here in their cocktails.\\n\\nI wanted to snack on something, so I ordered the Duck & Soy Chicken Sub. It came out just like a Vietnamese sub, and it was delicious, but for $8, I could very well have bought almost 3 subs from a Vietnamese cafe. And of course, I'd have to travel out to either Chinatown or somewhere on Kingsway.\\n\\nI also ordered one of each dessert item from their menu.

It was AWESOME! The mascarpone was creamy and very light in texture. The morsels and outside shell really brought a pleasant crunchy element. As for the hazelnut, the mascarpone was flavored throughout with hazelnut and then dusted outside with more hazelnut. Such a full flavored cannoli.

The hot plate is a must-try and remember to get the cheese!\\n\\n---\\n\\nMy gosh, this place has been a long time coming.  I can't believe how long and far I've searched for replacement for Joon's in Toronto (on Yonge and Shephard if anyone's been) in Vancouver.  Luckily I live close to Coquitlam and have been stuffing myself with Korean food looking for a place like Ta Bom! And finally! I stumbled on to this place after looking at some Instagram photos one day.  There's parking outside for anyone lucky enough to get street parking but there's also residential areas behind the strip if you're up for a walk.  The restaurant roughly fits 50 or so people and we came on a weekend around 1pm.  When we first arrived, the place was almost empty except for 1 large table and another table for 2.  By the time we left (2pm), the restaurant was PACKED with a line-up! Huh? Lunch rush at 2pm?\\n\\nOur order:\\nHot Plate (Dak-galbi) for 2 people - This is what the restaurant is known for and this is why I came! The servings are surprisingly large and by default, it comes with egg and corn on the side. There's dukk (rice cake), vegetables and a lot of meat on the actual hot plate with their sauce.  The dish doesn't come with rice, but you can always top up with fried rice at the end.  We also ordered cheese (extra $4) on the side.  And my final verdict is - this is fu*king delicious! I missed Joon's so much and this is exactly what I remember it to be.  There's a few ingredients missing (like maybe more rice cakes or noodles as an optional side) but overall, I loved it! The sauce was good; portion size was massive; and the toppings were perfect! I can't say enough good things about it, I recommend everyone try it at least once.\\nCold Noodles (mul naengmyeon) - We ordered this at the end because a) the sauce on the hot plate was SPICY and b) we love cold noodles and always try it at new Korean restaurants.  This one comes with half an egg, meat, and a good amount of soup/noodle ratio.  It's not the best we've had in Coquitlam but it helps dilute the heaviness of the hot plate meal.  \\n\\nThe service was great when we arrived and the girl serving us was really nice (answering all our questions and chatting with us).  As it got busier, I felt like the restaurant was too understaffed but perhaps it was a one-off crowd.  When we asked to pack some of our food, the waitress came over with a container and offered to pack it for us.  There was even a drawing on top of the container that was clearly hand-drawn! I was so impressed!  When I mentioned to the waitress how excited I was that Ta Bom opened, she seemed very happy to see me again and I will surely be back.  It makes the restaurant feel very home-y and family-run.  \\n\\nIn total, we paid $40 before tax and tip - for lunch.  And yes, I do think that's a bit expensive considering that it's lunch and Korean food normally isn't that expensive for two people.  However, the service was great, the food as on-point and I'm just dying to visit again.  I'd definitely recommend it for dinner and hopefully there isn't a wait.

I know they're all made to order but I'm pretty sure they could pump out the donuts faster and know they will be bought when the line's out the door haha\\nFood: 4.5/5 love em!!! My favorite is maple bacon. I was surprised because I usually don't like those donuts but these are really well balanced. The chocolate is also good and not too sweet (another flavor I usually don't crave). The other staples are just ok to me. I wish they'd add a jam / fruit flavor as a staple but sometimes they have one as a seasonal. I'm also in love with the honey latte (coffee is another thing I don't usually have haha)\\nOverall 4/5! They give you a free dozen on your birthday and are the perfect size for sharing! Only get them if you'll consume right away or else you definitely have to toaster oven them."},{"name":"Yanagi","address":"4404 W William Cannon Dr, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't like sushi.

My favourite is the chicken bulgogi bento box.\\n\\nI love the decor and the music is pretty much what plays on 94.7. The lighting is gentle and the shades are always down, which is really a plus in Texas and adds to the ambience. The servers I've had were mostly friendly but not overly chatty. It does feel a little weird to come here in casual clothes because the restaurant and servers always look so professional, but I almost never see diners in anything fancier than jeans and a t-shirt-once even saw some little soccer players and their families out after a game. I always go lunchtime to early afternoon, though. Maybe it's different at night.\\n\\nI've used the take-out service too. Most of the food was still tasty, but never try this for the tempura-the same light breading that makes it so delightful fresh gets soggy very quickly in a box.\\n\\nMajor plus for location.

I explain this to him and he tells me that it is my fault the order is wrong because I should have confirmed the order over the phone.

It features a French menu complete with French waiters.  But if you're looking for the same quality but in a more casual fashion just shuffle a few feet to the right and take a seat at Hannibal's.  They offer the same chef but with a limited food selection and a bigger focus on spirits.  It was somewhat confusing at first because we sat down thinking we were at Hannibal's and were given to menus bearing both names.  But we realized that there system is similar to Cantina's and One Eyed Jack's on Wall Street.  \\n\\nI didn't sample the crab cake that our table ordered but it came out solo on the dish with only a dressing of mango salsa.  The consensus was that it was very enjoyable but possibly not worth its cost of $13.  If two or three were on the plate then it might have been more worth it.  I also didn't sample the bleu cheese burger that arrived next but the person who did exclaimed, \\" this is by far the best cheeseburger I've ever had.\\"  It was dressed with just lettuce and tomato on a toasted bun.  Small jars of ketchup and mayonnaise arrived when she asked for them but it seemed good enough not to have added toppings.  From my point of view and from what she stated, it was juicy, absolutely delicious and priced about right at $14 for such a gourmet sandwich.  It was messy though so be careful and eat with caution.\\n\\nWe were there more for the libations so I can say that they have an extensive menu to choose from.  Catering to a population who must care about dieting, they have a complete list of drinks that can be considered low carb and low calorie.  For instance, at $8 you can order a Vox & Diet Tonic that will only set you back 90 calories.  But if you are in the mood to let loose and indulge, their special martinis are just what you're looking for.  Their version of a Snicker's inspired drink even includes crushed peanuts along the rim of the glass.  They also do a Vanilla Chai Martini for $12.  Draft and bottled beers are generally $6 and their house white wine will also cost you $6.\\n\\nIt's a cool place to go but being that it was a tad bit pricey it's not really the type of place I'd go on a regular basis.

Finally, he grabbed four menu and lead us to the patio.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, we noticed that the table was wobbling, the host had made a quick getaway, so another person came to bring water to the table, we mentioned to him that the table was wobbling, and he also made a quick getaway.\\n\\nFinally, the only person in the whole joint with some sense (Andrew) our server showed up.  I explained to him the table was wobbly, by now, I'm sure the pitch and tone of my voice was, fix this f-ing table now!  He and the water guy (who someone appeared again) came up with some wedges to stop the table from rocking, this however left the table lopsided, I explained to Andrew, that I was not about to sit here and hold this table right side up until, they found more wedges to hold the table up correctly and leveled.\\n\\nBy now, my children are like, oh lawd these people are going to spit in our food, and by now, Im like we can leave this place!\\n\\nHowever, we didnt.  \\n\\nWe ordered some sangria (mostly juice because we had two carafes at $22 each, and I drank more than 75% of it, and didn't have the slightest buzz). We also order a spicy tuna roll, and I'm still waiting on some flavor to hit my tongue.  My mom ordered a Stella, since it was only 50cents more than a Coors and requested a cold/iced glass, which still hasn't arrived.  Well, that's not true, she did order a Coors later in the time we were there and requested the cold glass again, and got one that time. \\n\\nI asked Andrew what the specials were, he didn't know, but went and found out and came back and recited them as if he had been born reciting restaurant specials.  He described one dish so well, that I went with it for my entree. \\n\\nFinally, we get to ordering our food, I went with the special which was a flash sockeye salmon over fingerlings, arugula, leeks and it was DELICIOUS.  Right amount of flavor, cooked to the right temperature and not dry at all.  My son went with the cheeseburger and fries, didn't eat the fries because they were cold, and my daughter went with the 10oz steak, well done and said it was done right, and my mother gorged out on the baby back ribs, and said they were great and not to salty. \\n(if you've read my previous reviews on my mother, everything is salty).\\n\\n$140 later (and yes, $60 of it was in sangria and beer), I just wasn't impressed to have to ever go here again.\\n\\nFinally, as we are leaving, the daughter ask the lady hostess from before if she will take a family photo, yes, we are corny like that.  There was no waiting to be seated, no one standing near the hostess stand etc, and you would have thought we asked her to jump off the building, she rolled her eyes up in here head as if to say, why the \\"f\\" do yall wanna take a picture in here, and why are you bothering me with it?  I know its not part of her job description, but it truly is part of making a place more inviting, and if this is the best they can do with a hostess, I recommend they send her back to Hostess 101, which is great all clients with a smile."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Mike's is a staple of Itialian pastry in the North End, especially if you love cannolis with various fillings.

I didn't know how good I had it growing up in Oklahoma City  until I moved to Columbus in 2003 and had trouble finding a good Vietnamese restaurant. In 2005, my prayers were answered when I stumbled upon Phuong Hoang. Considering the fact that they didn't have much competition in the entire city, their quality of food was phenomenal!  I've eaten here about 30 times and I've never been disappointed. The service (usually a smiling young woman) is terrific and the food is consistantly delicious. When they changed owner and name to Hoang in 2008, I was thrilled to find out that the food was still excellent. \\n\\nYou can never go wrong with a steaming bowl of Pho and a side of Spring Rolls. Most of the time, I end up with a bowl of Bun (vermicelli) with the works and a side of their crispy chicken wings or Banh Beo (small rice crepes with mung bean and dried shrimp). Occasionally, I have the craving for rice and I order the Com (rice) dish, also with the works. If you're new to Vietnamese cuisine and enjoy Pho, I highly recommend another noodle soup dish call Bun Bo Hue. The soup is similar to Pho, except it's tomato based, has a few different spices and the meat consists mostly of beef tendons. This place does an excellent job on this dish.\\n\\nI hope to be able to enjoy many more meals here.  \\n\\nTip: If you don't see the exact combination of Bun or Com dish you like on the menu, just ask.  They can make pretty much any combo for you!"},{"name":"BrickTop's","address":"3280 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste 100","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Had a work dinner.

We used to frequent the pho restaurant across the street, which was ok, but they didn't offer tripe and other goodies in the pho, which just doesn't make it true pho, sorry. So when I stepped into Buckeye pho and got a whiff of that wonderful pho broth, I was really surprised. In a good way.\\n\\nThis is the best pho restaurant in Columbus. If you go there, stick with the pho or the banh mi (why would you order anything else at a pho restaurant, really?) The other things on the menu are ok, but the pho is really the star of the menu. It's not the best I've ever had, but hey, it's Columbus, and the Asian food scene is just starting to grow. Still, the pho here is comparable to what I used to get when I lived in a Chinatown, where there were pho restaurants on every block. The broth is rich and flavorful but not oily. They give you lots of noodles, and of course, you can have tripe and tendon (the way it's supposed to be). The banh mi is made with good crusty french bread and grilled beef or pork--and there is nothing like a fatty pork banh mi dipped in steaming hot pho. \\n\\nI'm not in Columbus anymore, but I really do miss this place."},{"name":"The Rolling Rooster","address":"13717 Mopac Service Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Was visiting in town and looking for some good southern food and boy did I find it.

The roll came out as a pair with a savory peanut sauce. The veggies were fresh and the basil accented the roll amazingly. The peanut sauce could use a little more heat for my taste and luckily they have Siracha and Sambal Ulek right at the table.\\nThe Pho came out next with a side plate of jalepenos, basil, lime and bean sprouts. The broth was light yet flavorful and the noodles were cooked to perfection.

Because I got it take out, I couldn't return it and felt ripped off, so my only recourse was this review.  Their other food might be fine, but this was simply wrong.

Order the breakfast nachos, they are so good and worth the full order.  The restaurant is packed and still manages to have a cozy feel despite the tables and chairs being so close to each other.

Her brother stopped by, and we chatted for a bit.  It was just so delightful to make those connections.

Great Bay has shown me that fish can be done well and it can be done right.\\n\\nTake, for example, the trout I had the other night.  The trout itself was juicy and not dry.  Its skin was crispy and salty--but it didn't taste like a salt lick.  The other items on my plate (asparagus, mushrooms, and hash) each contained elements of the fish (firm, juicy, crispy) and worked well together to create a yumminess I can't really explain in words.

We stayed at the Royal Pacific Hotel and passed the Chocolate Emporium on the boat rides too and from the park.  It is a nice looking building, so when I got back to our room I looked it up online and read some reviews.  I read that dinner is a two hour wait and they don't take reservations, so we decided to get there when they opened at 11:00 am for lunch.  \\n\\nWe arrived at 11:00 am, and we were seated immediately on the second floor.  They restaurant is cool looking and they have characters in costumes walking around interacting with the customers.  They have an extensive menu and it was hard to decide what to order.  We finally decided on our meals and placed our order.  It took over an hour for our food to arrive.     When the food did finally come to the table, they brought everyone's but mine.  My husband's Fried Chicken BLT was cold and greasy, and one of my daughter's mini burgers was burned to a crisp but also cold.   I had to wait about 10 minutes longer for my food to come out. I ordered a broccoli and cheese quiche with french onion soup. When my quiche did arrive it was cold, bland and mushy.  It had a bechamel sauce on it that was cold and gross.  At that point I was so hungry that I scraped off the sauce and went ahead and ate the quiche rather than send it back.  The french onion soup was good and hot.  They did bring a fresh burger for my daughter to replace the charred one, but it came out cold as well.  For the life of me I could not understand why it took so long for the food to come out of the kitchen if the restaurant wasn't full, and why it was cold.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal we were so disappointed with the wait time and the food that we wanted to leave, but my kids wanted to have milkshakes.  So we placed our milkshake order and waited another 25 minutes for the milkshakes to arrive.  They looked beautiful when they came to the table, but what a disappointment for $12.  My son ordered the strawberry cheesecake milkshake.  It was way too sweet.  My daughter ordered the red velvet milkshake.

Many places rarely utilize these key spices; Buckeye Pho is no different. Although, I sensed a bit of star anise and ginger. Next is the broth. I can always tell how good a bowl of pho is based on just the broth. (One sign of a good bowl of pho is if you've finished it to the very last drop.) The beef and onion flavor is subtle and nice, but not spectacular.\\n(*** Tip: If you are an adventurous eater like me, I highly recommend the Pho Dac Biet, \\"the Pho Special\\", which usually includes unique toppings, such as, beef tripe, tendon, beef balls, and rare beef slices. Also, don't be shy to fill your bowl with the plateful of herbs they provide!)\\n\\nThe Saigon soup (\\"Hu Tieu\\") - This broth is typically either pork or chicken-based. I think BP opted for the chicken version. The broth is simple but so flavorful! It is topped with a good amount of shrimp and cooked pork slices. The noodles are a combination of both egg and rice. All in all, this is a very satisfying dish.\\n\\nThe Vermicelli noodle salad (\\"Bun\\", pronounced like \\"BOO-on\\") - I'm not too crazy about their bun. There isn't enough toppings (regardless of which version you choose), way too much noodle, and scarcely any herbs. The redeeming aspect of this dish is that their fish vinaigrette has an acceptable balance of sweetness, saltiness, and fishiness. Frankly, I don't think the $8 for this is worth it. If you are health conscientious, then this may be a good alternative for you since it fills you up and doesn't sit heavy in your stomache.\\n\\nOverall, Buckeye Pho does an adequate job in terms of flavor. I have a strong suspicion they use MSG in all their soups and broths (probably why I thought the Saigon soup was so flavorful), which is a big thumbs down for me. \\n\\nThe interior is tastefully designed with faux-granite tables and a plethora of buckeye nuts lining the walls. There are even flat-screen T.V.'s, which are usually tuned to ESPN. The space is open, inviting, and for the most part well-maintained. They add to the cultural experience with Vietnamese music playing softly in the background, which is a nice touch.\\n\\nBut alas, I have a singular PET PEEVE about this place. After every meal, I end up leaving with my clothes smelling overwhelmingly like a greasy kitchen. I enjoy the food, but I'd hate to go here for lunch during the week only to have my clothes stink up the office when I return to work. I usually come around dinner or during the weekends. This way, I can promptly go home and change into something a bit less potent.

The concierge service at this hotel is awesome as well if you are unfamiliar with Boston and need to find a decent place to eat. However, there are plenty of dining options located nearby that you can find without trying too hard. The hotel itself is situated in between two malls that are connected by a walkway that goes over the street so it's not necessary to go outside if the weather is bad. They have a Starbuck's inside the hotel for your early morning caffeine fix and a California Pizza Kitchen that's good and is very close to the hotel also. There is also a \\"Shaw's\\" grocery store that is across the street from the hotel that has a nice salad/hot bar and a good selection of ready-made sandwiches as well. Additionally, one of the malls has a food court in it that offers the standard, mall food court fare and is a little on the expensive side for a mall food court in my opinion but is pretty much on par with the area that it's in price-wise.\\n\\nThe rooms are clean and are pretty much just your typical hotel rooms, I can't think of anything special to say about them.

My husband used Priceline to book a hotel in Boulder, and we ended up with the Millenium for $60. So not a bad deal at all.\\n\\nSince we arrived around 8 pm, check in was a breeze. The room was a basic hotel room - desk, bed, TV. Nothing that will blow your mind, but good enough if you just want a place to sleep. The bed was extremely comfortable, so it made getting up on Sunday morning difficult.\\n\\nIf you don't want to drive or walk to downtown Boulder, the hotel does have a shuttle that will transport you for $8 - that is not per person but per group it appeared. That is pretty consistent with what a cab ride would cost. The hotel also operates a Budget car rental desk right in the lobby that appeared quite popular on Sunday morning when we checked out.\\n\\nWhile the hotel could use a fresh coat of paint in the hallways, it's not a bad option when staying in Boulder."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm not exactly sure how I've never gotten around to writing a review of this place, but here goes...better late than never.  Indeed the concept of Fancy BBQ is a little peculiar, especially when you figure that some of your better BBQ places are dingy health-compromising body-challenging forays into the world of the ever-expanding waistline.  Still, I like the concept here:  it's a fantastic looking space for starters (more on that in a moment), so the ambiance fits, and the execution of my lunch was pretty spot-on in a recent stopover as well, and the upstairs space bears up well under a longing gaze.\\n\\nI ordered a sort of sampler platter of meats and veggies, and they came replete with some sauce options, peppers of all ilk, veggies prepped in creative and bon vivant fashion.  And while it wasn't a perfect meal (I'd have loved to have more time to sample more fare, for example), service was prompt and the approach to BBQ was definitely unique without waning pretentious or so foreign as to render itself without worth. And frankly, this is a place tailor-made for the re-review.  Because as slick as the upstairs room is (and trust me, it's attractive), heading up the stairs for a show is easily yummy.  \\n\\nBut not as yummy as the ideal dinner just might be.

The escargot come piled onto a crispy bun with garlic and veggies and butter, and everything was delicious, with the bun's crunch adding some nice texture to the whole thing. The spring rolls are also really tasty, and the dip they come with is top-notch.\\n\\nAnd because I'm from Qu√©bec I had to try the poutine breakfast, and I have no regrets. It's not a poutine in the traditional sense - the swiss cheese and peppercorn gravy are definitely very different, but they mesh together really well, with the peppercorn gravy especially being really delicious - I want this gravy on everything! The ham and the eggs add a nice breakfast touch, and the poached egg was nicely done, just gooey enough on the inside.\\n\\nI got to try a bit of the Toulouse breakfast as well, and the sausage and bacon are quite tasty. The staff were friendly, the food came incredibly quickly, and the casual caf√©/diner sort of environment was welcoming and didn't feel overly pretentious like French-inspired places sometimes do.

He had been to Ray's before (pre-me) and raved on for as long as we've known each other. Finally it was my turn to try it. We were able to get a table for two at 8:45- not too late but perfect for us. We planned to arrive early and enjoy a cocktail at the bar first anyway. It was a lovely evening and I enjoyed seeing the prom-goers on parade, as well as the swanky folks out to impress. Ray's is a lovely space and I'm glad I wore a dress. \\n\\nOnce we were seated our waiter was right there to make introductions and refill our cocktails. We ordered the oysters and the BBQ shrimp for appetizers. The waiter offered us a choice of Atlantic or Pacific, but was not more knowledgeable about the specific variety. We chose the Atlantic as we were hoping they would be Apalachicola and I think they were. The oysters were pricey- $15/half dozen but were clean and fresh.\\n\\nThe BBQ shrimp were spicy and packed with flavor- but perhaps a bit too much so. The predominate flavor was thyme and it stuck with me throughout the entire rest of the meal so that every bite of my Seafood Platter tasted of thyme. Not a bad thing, but not particularly good either. \\n\\nHubby had the bone-in ribeye. This was the steak he had been dreaming of every time he thought of Ray's and it did not disappoint. I was able to plead a few bites from him and I thought this was the most tender ribeye I had ever had- more like a filet on the bone. My Seafood Platter was broiled and lovely, served with mashed potatoes and spaghetti squash (unusual but very yummy!). We shared a side of saut√©ed spinach. Everything was perfect. \\n\\nWith a little tweaking on the BBQ shrimp seasoning, this would have been one of the best meals I've had in a long time, but even so I know we'll be back!

Free, clean,plenty of spots but it was still early. Walked to Starbucks and sat outside overlooking the lake and big balloon you can go up in. It took 8 minutes to go up and down and I think it was $20 per person. We decided to go to a movie at the AMC instead. Bought tickets for a 12:30 show and in between took the free boat ride around the lake and over to the Orleans resort and back. Lots of nature on view and just a pleasant way to spend an hour. Got dropped off and ran through the place to make our movie on time. We had the Dine In theatre which was nice. They bring you food and drinks. Chicken sandwich was just ok not great and the kids liked the nachos.  The seats were comfy. Since we rushed to get back from our boat ride having the service at your seats was nice. We then went to the 3 story World of Coca-Cola and killed at least another hour+ looking at the goods, sampled coke from around the world - 16 big samples for $11, plenty for 3 to share, and had our photo taken for free with the Polar  Bear. There is an awesome deck on the 3rd floor that overlooks Disney Springs. Worth it! We also did a little window shopping. The restaurants all have a pretty long wait so if you are looking for food you can always go to the places just outside Disney Springs which don't have such a long wait. We had a nice time and spent about $100 for 3 people with the movie and snacks there, coffee and the Coke sampler. It was a good way to spend the better part of a day. It's clean, nice music and atmosphere, great shopping if that's your thing and other amusements that aren't too pricey- movies, bowling, game room - Disney Quest.

Everything made from scratch and so many choices. They have had wonderful dense, moist, rich and flavorful cakes in the past. As of lately, however, something has changed. My boyfriend purchased a large 2- layer Red Velvet cake to surprise me for my Birthday party and this was a big disappointment for me and my guests. Also, quite an investment but he had no worries about the price as he thought he was buying a quality cake. Unfortunately, the cake we received  was very dry and flavorless and nestled between  3 layers of sugary frosting, (which they claim to be a cream cheese frosting). I did call to complain and the owner Diane did call back. She told me that everyone else who has bought this cake has always loved it and that it must be me. I must not like Red Velvet cake. On the contrary, I love it. She also insinuated I must only like Red Velvet cake from a box and there's is from scratch. So that's why it's dry and flavorless and the frosting is overly sweet tasting. Also, many customers purchase this overly sweet cream cheese frosting on its own, so it must just be me. I took that as an insult as I do know the difference between scratch and instant box cakes. She offered me  a small single layer cake or 2 cupcakes to make this experience better for us. Unfortunately, I don't think the offer is very fair nor is it an appropriate business decision if they want a happy customer who will continue to do business with piece of Cake in the future. I will stop supporting this local business, and it goes without saying, (but I am saying), I will stop recommending them and I will stop purchasing their single slices from New Seasons. This is sad.\\nThe 3 pieces of cake we partially ate cost us $16.33 per piece.

Like, really really love Northstar.  So, I'm willing to wait in a line to get my Northstar.  Maybe some people aren't - that's cool.  But I am.  It's like waiting in line for a rollercoaster - you know there's going to be something really exciting at the end of that line.  \\n\\nI say this because, even though the Easton Northstar is HUGE, you will still  have to wait at peak times.  Why?  Because it's awesome, that's why, and lots of other people want it too.  (I did notice when we went for Sunday brunch last week that there was a line out the door and only one register open - maybe to control the flow of people so everyone got a table?)\\n\\nLocation:  It seems way larger than the other locations.  There's a bar with seating there, there's a little loft area upstairs, and there is outdoor seating that wraps around the restaurant.  If you're interested in sodas, they have a self-serve soda fountain that is stocked with that tasty Boylen's natural soda.  If you're interested in alcohol they have that too.  When we went for dinner the waitstaff was dressed in white button down shirts and we had rolled up silverware in cloth napkins (fancy!), but for lunch it seems they have the same containers of silverware and napkins on the containers as at the other locations.\\n\\nNow on to the noms.\\n\\nDo you like ginger?  At all?  OHMYGOODNESS GET THE GINGER ALE.  It's so freakin' good.  Fresh ginger, San Pellegrino, mint, and lime.  Mmmmm...\\n\\nMy go-to meal is the Buddah Bowl with tofu - crisp, bright veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, cabbage), tasty tofu cubes, lots of brown rice, and this amazing peanut sauce.  So good.  It seems to be much larger at this location, too, so you'll have enough for lunch the next day (or a late night snack, if you're me).\\n\\nThe Northstar Burger (their veggie burger) is also amazing, and they add beet juice which makes it look like it's rare.  That amuses me.\\n\\nSpeaking of burgers, my husband once got the Niman Ranch Cheeseburger.  I took a bite and nearly cried it was so good.  You have to understand that usually I'm not all that excited about ground beef and burgers - I usually eat ground turkey instead.  But this burger... oh... yum... it melted in my mouth.\\n\\nThe cookies are as big as your head, soft, and delicious.  The peanut butter cookie is topped with salty peanuts that work perfectly with the sweetness of the cookie.\\n\\nI could continue to review everything on the menu, but I won't.  \\n\\nWe do, however, need to take a minute and talk about brunch.\\n\\nI have never been disappointed with a Northstar breakfast/brunch.  Cloud Nine Pancakes?  Mmmmm... Mushroom Fritatta?  So tasty.\\n\\nBut the Sweet Potato Hash.  Oh, the Sweet Potato Hash.  I could eat that every day of my life.  Sweet potatoes, red peppers, onions sauteed up with diced turkey, then topped with two perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs.  Get some fresh cracked pepper, then break those yolks and go to town.  Get a biscuit with it (a buttery, slightly sweet, served with delicious jam biscuit), then be completely stuffed and ready for a nap.\\n\\nTo conclude - I love Northstar.

If you set the bar here, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nService is generally prompt and friendly.  They have plenty of cold beer on tap, and the happy hour specials are solid.  The kid menu is typical kid stuff (burgers, nuggets, etc.), but they include ice cream, which is a huge selling point for our little dessert fiends.\\n\\nThe playscape at Southpark is a touch unnerving, as it is not fenced and your visibility of the kids on the playscape when you are seated at your table is poor.

The fish skin (I think it was cod) was beautifully crisped and the meat was fresh.  The sauce tasted like soy sauce with spices.  My friend enjoyed her fish, too.\\n\\nFor dessert we ordered a lemon tart and apple chausson.  Lemon custard is only mildly tart and not overly sweet.  However, they lose one star because the apple chausson pastry was soggy and gummy and not easy to break with a fork.  The filling is overly spiced for my taste and was not evenly filled in the pastry.  I guess this was not fresh or it was nuked.  Graduating from a pastry program makes me more finicky about dessert and I rarely find a restaurant that can do both good mains AND equally good desserts.\\n\\nBut I must come back and try brunch as it seems to be the majority of the reviews.  Strangely it seems that Kitsilano has a deluge of brunch places and not much less quality dinner restaurants.\\n\\nUpdate:  Went back a couple of days later to try brunch.  Too much good reviews to pass this up.  My friend and I shared the Pho Bo.  It is good but lacks the depth of some authentic pho restaurants.  Maybe because they do not use that neurotoxin MSG.  I like the thicker rice noodles though.  \\n\\nI had the Brittany breakfast consisting of shrimps, prawns and ling cod.  Mmmmmm buttery goodness.  The salad is romaine with a simple oil and vinegar dressing.  I like that this is not the boxed salad.  It came with a side of fries and Dijon mayo and their fresh baked bread.  Love this bread.  \\n\\nMy friend had the Vancouver breakfast.  I suggested this as the sausages are made in-house. These are good size sausages and not too salty.  The bacon was a thick cut suggesting they slice it themselves.  This dish also came with fries and mayo and bread.  \\n\\nPrice is a little more than most but that's because you're getting quality fresh house made food.  It's a good change from the piggish greasy breakfast at Red Wagon.  Besides, I don't like being around too many hipsters/millenials."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband has been there before but this was my first time.

The salad dressing is your typical Japanese mayo-infusion but very good, but the beef always comes with just so-so noodles and undercooked asparagus spear chunks, which gets boring.

It was so rich and hearty and was exactly what I wanted from an Italian meal (since I usually don't eat pasta). Had a cold Moretti to complement it and it was a perfect combination.

The place doesn't have that many tables, but it looks like they have a nice patio come Spring and Summer time. Our server was in training, but she was on top of things and very nice. \\n\\nWe ended up starting off with the Moshi Asian Pockets, which are essentially potstickers, and they were nice and crispy with a very tasty sauce. For our main course, we split a PT, Jimbo, and spicy tuna roll, and they were all delicious. The PT was probably our favorite with the panko white fish, but the Jimbo had baked Yellowtail on top and was dressed in a Thai spicy sauce that was almost as fantastic. Along with the rolls, I ordered sea urchin nigiri and striped bass shahimi. I hadn't had sea urchin before, and it really didn't do much for me. The texture is very creamy, but I didn't really get much taste to it. The bass was pretty solid, and I probably could have eaten a few more pieces.\\n\\nOn a side note: The men's bathroom is a single bathroom, and the lock doesn't work, so that should probably be addressed. A minor gripe in an otherwise great experience.\\n\\nThe specialty rolls are a pretty pricey in comparison to other sushi restaurants around Columbus, but the quality is there.

I got the marshmallow one cause I love marshmallows. It came with a vanilla shake, a Rice Krispie, and a marshmallow. I personally would have preferred a chocolate shake to balance out that flavor, but I asked for a little bit of chocolate sauce to be put in so it was better then.

The food is so rich and savory that it's more of a culinary experience and not just a meal I can repeat everyday (but I'd like to). \\nThe menu has something for everyone and definitely come hungry, even starving! \\nMy most recent visit included the hangar steak with Cholula butter sauce. You heard that right! Buttaaa. The meat melted in my mouth and I was smiling the entire meal. For starters, get the fried green tomatoes. For sides, I'm a fan of the green chile cheese grits. Hell, keep going back and make sure you try something new. \\nMy best tip is this... The most important thing is to save room for desert. Specifically, the coconut cream pie.

Located in the heart of the North End (Boston's \\"Little Italy\\") this place sneaks up on you with it's intensity. First of all, the line is out the door, which I'm told is pretty standard. Then, you have to push through the hoard of tourists and locals to get to the glass counter which, if you aren't overwhelmed yet, you will be when you reach this display case... I had a moment of pure joy and pure anxiousness because I was totally unprepared for my dessert decision. Cakes, cookies, cannolis, cupcakes, croissants, oh my! The workers are buzzing around like bees in a nest yelling at you for your order (in a Boston accent at that, scary for a midwestern girl like me, ah!). It was a moment of pure sweet panic, that I finally blurted out - \\"ailughaektb I'll take your top three items!\\". Apparently, that meant a lobster tail, chocolate chip canoli, and chocolate mousse canoli. I had them box it up since it was a gift for my boyfriend back home in MN (note: these desserts travel really well!). 7 hours later, we were chowing down & I realized that the visit was totally worth it. Lobster tail was my fav.

It came with an extremely bland marinara. I ordered the veal based on reading good reviews here, but it was thin and below average. It tasted like a cheap Italian restaurant, but the price is nothing like a cheap Italian restaurant.

There always seems to be a new brewery opening in or around Columbus and it's hard to keep up. As for the beer, it was all good. The house beers range from about $6 to $7 for a pint. Many of the beers are the IPA kind which isn't my favorite. One of the best house beers was the Tripel. It was very smooth without a strong aftertaste. The food wasn't as impressive. It has slim vegetarian choices. The salad is about $10 for a good size. \\n\\nI want to give Rockmill Tavern a chance. It has very great beer.

I know they cook other than steaks but steaks should be the majority of what they cook, yes? Then I would assume they would be able to cook a steak medium rare, all the time, perfectly. Yes? Well, no. I order a flat iron steak medium rare. It is suggested in the menu that medium rare to medium is the proper temp. The waitress even verbally describes medium rare as a pink and warm center. When I received my steak, the outer edges was just medium rare. I cut around it hoping the center would have time to warm up. But no, the center was blue and cold. Yes, I could have sent it back but the last time I did that, I got back something that looked more like burnt bark than steak. The waitress at that time then proceeded to insist that they give us a new steak - one to take home even. Nice but why can't they make the darn thing right in the first place? I'm guessing they get pretty good practice making steaks every day, all day. So what's so hard about medium rare? And it's not just Longhorn. Same thing has happened to me at Ruths Chris. With that litany over, an additional \\"I don't understand\\" is why it took so long for the food to arrive - a weekday evening near closing time with about a half dozen small tables occupied?

I had a small Caesar salad and regretted it later.  $8 is just absolutely ridiculous for some romaine lettuce and dressing.  The taste was good, however,\\n\\nWhere Vespaio excels is the service.  Our waiter anticipated our needs and was extremely attentive.  The trend in Austin dining seems to be serve quickly and get the customer out.
