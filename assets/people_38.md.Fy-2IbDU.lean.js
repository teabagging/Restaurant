We've been 4-5 times and each time our food comes out lukewarm and the service is so so. Typically drinks get dropped off, food order is taken and delivered and you never see or hear from your server again except to bring the check. I'd worked in restaurants and bars for 5+ years as a waiter and I'm very knowledgeable about how things should run. I'm very patient, I know things happen our of the severs control, double and triple sat, the kitchen gets slammed with a large order, food isn't made correctly, tickets get lost, understaffed, etc. I get it mistakes happen but every time is pretty bad. I still typically tip 18-20% even if the service isn't great as mentioned before I get it, things happen. \\n\\nWe decided to give it another shot and sat at the back bar right near the food window and expo hoping this might increase our chances of getting hot food but boy were we wrong. They were busy and it took a few minutes for anyone to great us but eventually, I assume the manager came over and took our drink order. While waiting for our drinks we noticed at least 10-15 entrees sitting under the heat lamp for 5-10 minutes waiting to be delivered to the guests. From what I can tell there was only 1 expo and 1 food runner or possibly waiter who cared enough to run his food and all the other waiters food to their tables. While plating the expo would repeatedly put her fingers into the food testing the temperature, manhandling food, and never washing her hands. Not that this is acceptable in a closed kitchen but someone needs to tell her and all the staff you are in an open kitchen with customers watching you!  During the next 10 minutes or we saw 5 or so entrees get sent back for variety a of reasons. Eventually, a waiter came over took our order again still hopeful for a good experience. \\n\\nFood continued to fill the window under the heat lamps and sit when what I assume was our entrees were placed in the window. I started my stopwatch and let the fun begin. Food continued to sit as waiters brought food back into the kitchen with very little food leaving the kitchen, 5 minutes, passed then 10 then 15 when finally the expo manhandled my fries and asked them for new, fresh, warm ones. At this point, I told the expo it's been sitting there for 15 minutes and would be surprised if it was still warm. She wanted to argue with me explaining that our ticket was very far down the line and that's why it had been sitting there for so long. One of the cooks came out with new hot fries and apologized shortly after the manager and waiter said they would comp our entrees which was nice as we weren't expecting or looking for a free meal. \\n\\nThe solution seems pretty simple, train your expos and waiters to work faster and more efficiently as a team, get more food runners, and train your servers to multitask. I'm not sure if servers are supposed to be running their food but I never saw any of them come back to check on food, grab their table's food or any other tables for that matter. Remind them that it's an open kitchen, guests can see everything they do. When they're joking around, chit-chatting, not checking on tables they can see them and it's frustrating if they need something."},{"name":"Island Fin Pok√© Company","address":"7004 Tavistock Lakes Blvd, Ste 148","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This unassuming place had a great atmosphere and the poke did not disappoint!

My sister-in-law was staying nearby and had an evening free between high-level business meetings, so we caught up here.\\n\\nTo set the ambiance, Strega is full of men in blue shirts, collars just open, with their trophy wives, all looking around at each other to see whose trophy wife looks the best and who is willing to spend the most money on wine. This is certainly a 'be seen' sort of place. The hostess was in a skin tight short black dress with straps across the front and part of her stomach showing. While quite attractive, it seemed much more Jersey Shore than Boston. During this, I come in in business attire, with my wife, sister-in-law (both in walking-Boston-on-a-sticky-day attire) and... three young children. I don't think they were excited by us, but they never showed it. We did however have the floor manager personally tending to our table.\\n\\nSpeaking of the staff, they were excellent. Every time a child dropped something, it was picked up before we could. Every time we asked for something for the child, it was there in no time. The only knock on them I could find is that they were *so* attentive, the bread we were keeping on the table for the children to chew on while we did dessert was cleared without my noticing even though I had hidden it nicely. \\n\\nThe wine: They knew their wine. Perhaps this was because we had the floor manager (or was he head waiter?) waiting upon us, but they were certainly knowledgeable. The selections he recommended to each of us fit our tastes well. The wine list is monumentally large.\\n\\nThe food: We got a caprese, which we were unimpressed by. For a caprese salad, it was remarkably oily. Naturally, there is oil, but this seemed more like eating olive oil in the shape of a tomato. I got a steak done medium, which was more medium-well, but I'm good with that. My wife got the salmon, and my sister-in-law the lobster mac and cheese. All were good, but unmemorable.\\n\\nThe desserts: I cot a cr√®me br√ªl√©e, which was good, and my sister-in-law and wife got the chocolate cake, which they found decent. My nephew got the gelato, which he needless-to-say enjoyed. Portion sizes were also smaller than anticipated.\\n\\nNow, why you may ask did I only give three stars? It's because the price point and ambiance. The meal was costly, and at a lower price point I would have given more stars. There are better-tasting restaurants nearby which have similar or nicer ambiance. I feel like you are paying to be seen here by other people, which is fine, but not something I feel I need to waste money on. The ambiance was also lacking.

Mike's Pastry is good if you want a variety of different flavors, Mike's cannoli is bigger and they have plenty of other choices like tiramisu... cheesecakes and other things.

I am in love with Maria's cannoli because they only fill it when you order it, it's not pre-made or refrigerated.  We also got some almond biscotti that was delicious as well.

It was very delicious!  \\n\\nNext time I'm back in Boston I will for sure come back to Maria's.

The food was average, but overall soggy.  My wife's carne asada tacos were soggy and my chicken burrito was also wet to the point of dripping in my hands and plate when eating.  The sides on each were great - the rice and also the salad.  Hard to say if this is the typical food experience or 1st month settling in.   Worth a try, but don't expect incredible cuisine.

The oysters are always excellent, and while I wouldn't say their drink offerings are standout, they always have a decent variety of stuff and I haven't been disappointed. The bar service has never been stellar, but it hasn't been bad, either. Just average.\\n\\nA couple of weeks back, some friends from out of town were visiting, and requested seafood, so we figured we'd go here since the oysters are always excellent and we have heard good things about the food from other friends who have gone. \\n\\nThe food was quite good, but the service was so terrible, I would never come back here. We started with drinks at the bar because our table wasn't ready at the time of our reservation. We ended up having time for two rounds of drinks (no, we weren't guzzling, but thanks for your concern, mom!) before we were even seated. Our server seemed a little curt when he first came over, but it was unremarkable at that point. We ordered a few appetizers to share, which came out in a reasonable amount of time, but that was pretty much the last decent experience of the evening. We tried ordering two more rounds of drinks but every time we tried to flag the server down, he headed in the other direction.\\n\\nAt some point, our buzz wore off and we were collectively wondering where our mains were. When we checked the time, we realized that we had been waiting an hour and a half for our mains. We tried flagging down the server and when he finally came over, he acted like we were crazy and said they would be right out, that it was a weekend and they were busy. He then proceeded to go into the (open) kitchen and have a big to-do with lots of yelling and gesticulating with the cooks. We couldn't hear what was being said because it was quite loud, but it was pretty clear that our ticket had been lost along the way.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I get that mistakes happen. But the server's attitude to us was totally unacceptable - as though we had been totally unreasonable to bother him and ask where our food was. Ten minutes after the \\"discussion\\" with the kitchen staff, he comes out with a plate of 5 small baked clams (there were four people at our table), saying \\"this is from the kitchen\\". No apology or anything, just a bite of clam?\\n\\nI would have hoped for a little bit more from the management of this very popular establishment - a \\"we're so sorry!\\" goes a really long way when people are spending a lot of money and an entire evening (it ended up taking us 6 (yes, six!) hours from drinks/waiting for our table to getting the check that evening).

I was not impressed by it at all. First of all, the prices were too high for so little food. My plate was the size of an appetizer. We had to order the complimentary cold bread twice to try to fill up a bit. I ordered the Raviolone Aperto: open-face raviolo with scallops, shrimp and zuchinni slices and lobster mascarpone reduction ($26). My husband ordered the Pappardelle alla Bolognese: pappardelle pasta with veal, pork and beef tomatoe rag√∫, basil and shaved ricotta salata ($24). As mentioned above, my plate was so small. It was 2 thin slices of pasta, yes, one small ravioli with only 2 raw shrimps and 3 medium-sized scallops and probably 2-3 one-inch slices of zuchinni, so small is more like decoration. Literally, just that. The sauce did not taste anything like lobster, not even one bit. Yes, I know that seafood plates are pricey, but I don't think this little bit of food was worth the much. Even though we ordered bread twice, I was not even half full. This is Italian food, they are supposed to serve more than a French restaurant. My husband's plate was ok. Tasted just like pasta with meat sauce, barely any meat in the sauce. Definitely not coming back to this place again. I even asked the waiter if the plate had plenty of food, and he responded 'enough'. I guess we should have taken a clue and got out of there then just like another couple did after seeing the menu.

The clams were lightly battered so you get all the great flavors from the clam with a slight crisp. The bone marrow was \\"meaty\\" and ended up doing a bone marrow luge shot with one of the fellow bar patron. Not only it's tasty, it's a great little communal bar ice breaker.

So I asked my friends and family who's been here before for suggestions. One name that kept being dropped was \\"Pok Pok.\\" Looked it up on my handy dandy Yelp App in my super amazing Samsung Galaxy S9 phone and this spot is the closest to my hotel. So we order a ride share and off we go!\\n\\nBraised Short Ribs:     The lime leaves and the lemon grass flavors take center stage on this dish. The spice, the flavors and the sauce is just divine. Perfect pair with jasmine rice imo.\\n\\nThai Sweet Pork Belly:     Pork belly is my weakness. I seem to gravitate to it every time I see it on a menu. This dish is perfect, saucy, garlicky and just a delight to dump over jasmine rice. It's a total flavor explosion in my mouth.\\n\\nFish Sauce Chicken Wings:     Seems to me that this is the poster child of Pokpok, so we ordered a set. I think these guys win. Super flavorful and such a pleasant punch in the mouth. These wings will elevate your palette my friend.\\n\\nThe setting brung me back to the whole street style Asian eatery feel. The linoleum wrapped tables and the stainless drinking cups is such a homage to authentic asian setting. I would totally come back and eat here again. Next time I'd like to try that Half Chicken with the papaya\\n\\nThank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience.

Better for sure. I have even have a few favorite servers. Shout out to Josh and Paul. \\n\\nPrevious review:\\n\\nGreat location....I just wished the service matched. For Millers to be a chain they need to step it up at this location. There many local spots that will be happy to step up. After my most recent visit I realize I'm going to have to go elsewhere to get my fried calamari. Can we talk about how dark it is. Not a fan of cold dark places and secondly, I don't appreciate having to wait in an almost empty restaurant for the host to find the next available server. Did they also leave with the crowd? Only to finally be waited on by a person that obviously was not having a good night, and clearly was ready to leave. Of course something was messed up so we had to send food back. She wasn't happy about that because she even left our bill on the back of the chair instead of giving to us in our hand or on the table. \\n\\nThe manager came by to explain the food situation (something she could have done) only for our night to end the way it did. Hands down when I think of late night food, decent drinks and a chill atmosphere, I think Millers.  After this experience Millers is definitely going to be low on that list...or I'll drive furthers for better service. What made matters worse is it's was my sisters birthday!

Didn't really taste too much of the sauce though since there was so much food in our bowl. \\n\\nAlso had to try the Dole whip and compare it to Disney's.

I assume they most of their business from takeaway and delivery (I would suggest calling them instead of ordering through foodler, etc to avoid any delivery costs/costly minimum charges.) They do have a couple of seats (enough for 6-7 people) and a TV. \\n\\n- THE FOOD:\\nSo cheap given the portion size. I got the pesto gnocchi with chicken (you can add chicken or shrimp for a couple of bucks) and could only finish a third of it. The gnocchi was pillowy, the pesto was delicious and totally un-canned, and the chicken was (surprisingly) moist and crispy. Comes with some very garlic-y garlic bread. The whole thing cost about $10. Have since gone back twice.\\n\\nPay the extra money for homemade pasta. It's worth it. And, if there's space, eat there because there's something magical about watching them pour your pasta from the pan to the bowl and diving into your food immediately afterwards."},{"name":"T1 Bento","address":"6035 Peachtree Rd","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"Yum food, great price, super fast!

The tacos arrived at the table looking pretty good but they were a huge disappointment. I started with the fish taco because it had a nice looking piece of fish sitting in the flour shell. The fish was cooked to death that left it massively unappealing. The flour shell was gummy. I'm not sure how a flour tortilla becomes gummy but they achieved it. I took a bite of the beef taco and it had the same gummy shell so I passed on it. The pork was also terribly overcooked and sitting in a gummy shell so I passed on it as well. \\n\\nMy husband and I arrived close to closing. I think that attributed to the epic fail in food quality. Our waiter offered us a free dessert. We appreciate his kindness but didn't take him up on it.

The place was packed, but the wait was only about 15 minutes for a table, and it went by faster than that. \\n\\nWe had wanted to try out a variety of tapas and so we ordered the Hanger Steak, Meatballs, Beef Empanadas, Beet Salad, eggplant, and the lamb belly. Unfortunately, our server came by shortly after with the note that they were out of both the lamb belly and the meatballs. We were disappointed by the news, but we replaced the order with the duck hearts and the potato bravas. Claire, who I believe was the assistant manager, dropped by our table and apologized for the inconvenience. The food was brought out shortly after, starting with the cold dishes. The beet salad was good, and I was especially fond of the eggplant dish. The duck hearts, however, I couldn't speak highly of, as they left a strong unpalatable after-taste. Claire came by again to check on us and she was curious what we thought of the duck hearts. I gave her my honest answer, and she immediately took the plate back and asked what we would like to replace it with. We ended up getting the beef short rib and grits, and she recommended that we try the roasted cauliflower on the house! The hot dishes began rolling out and we were pleasantly surprised to see the meatballs too! Apparently, they had a few more left when they double checked and so they brought out a plate.\\n\\nThe food was all spectacular (especially the Hanger Steak and Empanadas), but the service was what really stood out that night; huge shout out to Claire for her help!

So take my rating with a grain of salt if you must, but I'll try my best to be as thorough as I can in my review.\\n\\nIf you've heard about this place, chances are you've heard that it's one of the best pizza places in Atlanta. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good. There are absolutely times where I crave it, but there are also times where I just crave the idea of cheese, sauce, and dough in general. So why the harsh rating? Quite simply, I'm not too fond of the idea of paying over $20 for a single pie of cheese, sauce, and dough. If Antico's had a better pizza to dollar ratio, that could easily raise my rating.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the atmosphere. I see I'm not the first to say that the seating here isn't great. Not only is it difficult to find seating at busy times (Friday nights and weekends), but the entire arrangement isn't particularly conducive for intimate environments. This poses two significant problems: 1) it'll be difficult to find seating if you come with a large group and 2) if you're not in a large group, you'll likely have to share a table with strangers due to the way the place is set up. \\n\\nOverall, the two most frequent opinions I tend to hear about this place (in order, starting from most frequent) is 1) Antico's is the best pizza place in Midtown and 2) Antico's is overrated."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Best pizza I have ever had!

If you're going to put this on your menu, it better be...The Best!.  Wasn't.  Not by far.  First bite was hot, watery juicy and full of salt.  Bleh.  Next bite...worse.  So much salt in the veal that 1. they ruined it.  2. it obvious that they're buying cheap veal and brining it to make it softer.  3. They are NOT making the best veal chop in Atlanta.  Not by far.  4. the amount of salt in the veal ruined the rest of the wine, my tongue and any taste for the rest of the meal.  Seriously...way too much salt.\\n\\nWaitress comes by and I honestly didn't want to say anything because it was a date night and I didn't want any \\"issue\\" with the staff.  My friend took it upon himself to let them know that I thought the veal was too salty and inedible.  She was sorry, apologized and goes off to the get Mr. Wonderful...the nob with his mug on this Yelp page.  The Captain of Outstanding Customer Service.  So Mr. Classy walks up to the table, doesn't even bother to introduce himself, stands right at the table so he's looming over us, looks straight down at my veal with 2 bites from it and mumbles some BS about \\"So you no like the veal?\\"  No, it's too salty.  \\"Well...IF WE'D KNOWN YOU DIDN'T WANT SALT WE WOULDN'T HAVE PUT ANY ON IT\\".  Mr. Classy then grabs the plate and goes back into the kitchen and starts screaming in Italian about it to his poor staff.  Like they know what they're about to encounter from him. (BTW, later on heard this is his MO, because one of the nice staff made the comment of \\"you can't work in an Italian restaurant without a thick skin\\".  Excuse me?  Sorry folks, but what a feminine hygiene product.  I own 12 retail stores in Atlanta, and I've never yelled at my staff even once.)  We were all sitting looking at each other with a stunned look on our face of \\"did that just happen?\\"\\n\\nSo out comes the waitress with another veal chop.  One bite and it's the same result.  So obviously they brine the veal.  I passed a bite around and all agreed...salty and inedible.  The Nob never came back either to check, just sends his staff to cover for him...so he really doesn't care.  For $40 veal, top of the menu, claim of the best...this sucked.  Oh yes...this cheap ass has the nards to quote green beans, broccoli flowerets and CELERY slices as \\"seasonal veggies\\".  Really?  Celery is now a dinner veggie?  Steamed of course, no flavor.  How are these seasonal?  Squash, root veggies are seasonal in the winter, not veggies you can get all year.  All servings reeked of cheap, cheap and cheap.  Oh yea...my wife flipped at the $18 for a side serving of pasta.  For a side serving!  \\n\\nThe place is neat, tidy and the wait staff is nice and attentive.

HERE,  You will find Authentic Italy, And I should know, I lived there for 15 years full time and have traveled the  country from Tip to Stern (or Stiletto (the heel) as they say).  \\nNOW let me interject here that we have been trying \\"So called Italian Restaurants (Ristorantes)\\" for two  (2) years and ALWAYS came away shaking our heads disgustato (disgusted) yearning to return to the True Italia across the Big Pond.  \\nSince this place Only has about (maybe) 10 tables, we made a reservation and got there early and enjoyed looking around Polcari's across the street and enjoyed a Fresh cup of coffee (a whole other story about this place.)  \\nWhen our time came up We were greeted Like being in Italia, with such friendliness and kindness by Gabriele (the sweetest, cutest guy you can meet and HE speaks Italian) and were seated at a great table in the front.  \\nHe brought us water and menus and we discussed the menu.  \\nI am vegetarian (but not vegan) and I NEVER have a problem in Italia, because they are there to Please,  AS IS THIS PLACE.   He was so Gentile (Gracious) going over every selection and what they could do to make it vegetarian if I was to select one.\\nWe decided No Antipasti, and ordered Primi's instead.   I was looking forward to a insalata I get in Italia - the Insalata di Arugula con Finocchio e Arance - [Wild Organic Arugula, shaved fennel and fresh orange segments salad, with Italian honey dressing].  \\nLet me tell YOU the presentation was SPETTACOLARE, (spectacular). It was FRESH, Piled in the way of an Old Haystack with the orange sections peeking out all around it (and there were some on the inside too).  It was ESATTAMENTE  (exactly) what I wanted, there was a fair amount of Wild Arugala (Yes it is different from regular Arugala) with Shaved Finocchio (fennel) on top with the Best fresh sweet orange segments, LIGHTLY dressed in the Honey orange dressing.  This is important; because sometimes it comes swimming in dressing or you are hunting for it, which defeats the salad.  \\nIt was so Refreshing and deliziosa (delicious) There was NOTHING left, I even sopped up what little dressing was left with bread.  Although I would say it is worth going here Just for the salad, There is so much more.  My husband also ordered this salad and didn't leave a leaf, and he IS NOT a big salad person.  \\nAfter discussion with Gabriele, for my Secondo, I selected the Risotto Porcini E Asparagi, [Arborio rice with Italian Porcini mushrooms, asparagus tips and white Truffle oil] (which was in the Primi selection) which I have been unable to find made properly.   We also made a selection of wine to drink (which is pleasantly priced affordably) \\nMy Risotto was Buonissimo cosi eccellente (Yummy so excellent) Absolutely cooked to perfection.  \\nIt was Not too al dente and flavored and cooked perfectly of which you could taste ALL the flavors; the porcini, asparagus and the perfect hint of tartufo (truffle) oil.  (sometimes truffle oil can be overbearing if too much is added).  The portion was quite large; hence the reason for no Antipasti And I ATE every rice grain, and if I could, I would have licked the plate, it was THAT GOOD.  \\nWe were getting pretty full when Gabriele showed up with the dessert, Sfogliatella, shell shaped pastry filled with a sweet cream filling.  \\nOh My Goodness.  I am so SAD I live so far away, however, since we have to come back every year for medical treatment, You will find me HERE at Terramia trying every dish one by one, because you need the time to Savor and simply ENJOY the food and atmosphere of Being in Italia.  \\nOther than English is spoken  (but Gabriele speaks Italian) You are  smack dab in the middle of a Michelin Star Ristorante that just happens to be in Boston -minus the Michelin (thank God, I can afford it)\\nWhat I can truthfully tell you is; If you want to visit Italia and can't afford it OR just don't have the time, TAKE YOURSELF to TERRAMIA Ristorante.  You won't even have to learn the language, spend $5,000.00 or more) to travel  to Italia to Experience Italia.  It is Italia away from Home for us.  \\nLet me say the Chef is to be TOTALLY Recognized for his creative skill and ability.  When food is so good, It is IMPORTANT to also give Kudos to ALL the cooks and Kitchen staff, It is such a TEAM effort from the back to the Front.  I know I did not mention the service, But I really don't need to because it was Impeccabile (impeccable).  But I must say I am adopting Sunny as my Noni.

I know the law of science that goes: Proximity + deliciousness = YESSSSS!, so I was anxious to see how the place panned out.\\n\\nWe ordered some basil rolls, a shrimp soup, and a some-kind-of-beef soup (Boyfriend always orders the kind with tripe in it, so that the waiter doesn't think he's a white wussy boy).  The food took a while, considering soup and basil rolls are probably prepared ahead of time.  For a $15 dinner-for-two though, I'd have waited twice as long.  The basil rolls were among the best I've ever had--they lacked the pork that some other places use, and their peanut dipping sauce was clearly home-made.  \\n\\nMy soup seemed a little boring.  I always add the culantro, lime juice, Sriracha, hoisin sauce, and whatever other hot sauce they've got on the table.  I did all that, and it was still kind of bland.  I added some fish sauce and another huge squirt of Sriracha, and happily slurped up the bright red concoction.  It wasn't the best Pho I've ever had but there was nothing wrong with it.  Considering the location and the price, I will definitely be going back to Pho Truc.

This first visit was 5 stars.  Yesterday, Oct 11, we came back to celebrate my birthday.  Sadly this time we had Robert as our server.  It was horrible service. He couldn't remember my drink order, he forgot what I ordered (virgin strawberry margarita), came to back to double check was it was. Came back again asked how I wanted to prepared-blended or cubes.  Got the drinks.  Other tables that came in after us already had their salads and bread, he had not even taken our order.  That finally happened. After quite a long- long wait we got our salad/soup and bread.   The other table already had their main course and were halfway thru it.. I had only taken 2 bites my salad when the main dish showed up. Hubby had only had one bite of his chowder. Robert said it was the kitchens fault  I complimented the chef, to which Robert replied \\"I've seen better\\".  Really?  Wow  what a thing to say.  I asked about a certain dessert, had to  catch him as he went flying by, and just got a \\"we're out\\" as he kept moving.  Had to ask 3 times for a box, he kept forgetting.  Got the birthday sundae with the hat, was told to not putt on my head, to just \\"hold it\\".  We sat there for what seemed like forever waiting for the check, actually  about 15 minutes.  He only had 2 other tables and we were all in row. He had no attention to detail, was not at all attentive.  Never even put down the little drink napkins. The  wait  for the salad/ soup was much to long, the food came way to fast. I did complain to the manager but it felt like he just brushed it aside.  It was a Friday night about 6 pm.  And our section was not that busy. And it cleared out quickly. He couldn't even handle the 3 tables he had.  This was not the birthday celebration we were hoping for.  The food was wonderful, the service really put a downer on it.  Guess should have sat in the bar where Jane was, but there weren't any tables and who wants sit at the bar for a birthday celebration?

I've always wanted to go to some ruth's chris since i've heard so much about it.\\nTo be fair, although i only gave it a four star, the place really did not disappoint. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I started with half a bottle of shiraz, spicy lobster tempura. The spicy lobster tasted like chinese food, which was kinda weird to me. \\n\\nNext we each ordered their \\"classic dinner.\\" For $50 each, we both had an appetizer, a steak,a side, and a dessert. I had the seafood gumbo, which started out as a little too salty, but as I kept eating, the flavour started to really accentuate through the salt..haha, i loved the peppery aftertaste. My bfs caesar salad came out extremely fresh.\\n\\nFor the entree, i got the ribeye and he got the filet. Like everyone else has said the meat is served on a scalding hot dish full of buttery goodness. My Ribeye was huge and insanely juicy and flavourful, while my boyfriend's filet was thick and tender. Neither of us were able to finish our steak, but when the server came to take it away, i kept stealing more bites because i didn't want to stop eating something so amazing. We got mashed potatoes and and green beans which came in very large dishes (considering it was called a \\"personal\\" side). Again, all buttery and yummy. The green beans were dripping butter as you picked it up.\\n\\nFor dessert, it was cheesecake complemented with dark chocolate crisps. I adored the cheesecake, but didnt like the dark chocolate crisps (but then again i was never a huge fan of chocolate so my opinion doesn't really count). \\n\\nThe service was very professional and attentive. At the beginning of our meal, he asked what brought us here and we said it was my birthday and when the dessert came, it came with happy birthday written with chocolate syrup on the plate and a candle. I was pleasantly surprised :)\\n\\nSo why did I take off one star? Well, okay, if i could I probably would have given the place a 4.5 stars. To be honest, I'm not sure if I like all that butter over my food and I wonder whether the steak would taste as good without all that grease at the bottom of the plate. Also, although our server was nice and professional, I still felt like i was a little out of place there. I probably would appreciate it if he was smilier and friendlier, but that's just a personal preference. \\n\\nAmbiance-wise, my boyfriend and I totally loved it there. It was quiet but wasn't too stuffy and everyone around us were comfortable with having normal noise conversations, and made us really feel at ease while not losing the whole romantic feel. \\n\\nWould I come back? Probably after i find a way to lose all the butter gained around my waist.\\n\\nTIP: valet is $16 but if you park at the garage on washington street it's $12. i think the extra $4 is worth the valet."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Food was amazing and the view of the Winery/Restaurant is breathtaking.

Yes!!!\\n\\nWe ordered an overwhelming amount of food because we were hungry and I'd been waiting for years. We started with the Calamari (smaller size, thanks to our server for telling us not to get the bigger one!), which was tasty, but nothing special. The pastas were the stars of the show though. The Seafood Pasta with Giacomo Sauce featured beautifully cooked seafood in a tasty sauce. They were generous with the amount of seafood and I only wish I had the stomach space to keep eating. And the Butternut Squash Ravioli in all of its creamy and slightly sweet glory was delicious! The portions here were huge and the prices totally reasonable!\\n\\nService here was great. Everything comes out fast, and our waiter was helpful in explaining all of the dishes and giving us recommendations. It's a no-frills spot and the servers may seem gruff, but they mean well and are just trying to churn through that long line! Don't forget to bring cash!

It was Saturday at 6ish. The atmosphere is very nice. The hostess pointed to table right at the door and I asked if there was anything else since it was very blustery and cold outside but she said just said no. I would have preferred the nice warm empty table at back of room but I let that go. An hour later she sat a similar party to ours there. We were all very cold as there was a function upstairs and people were trickling out of that the whole time we were there; so the door was opening a LOT. The food was very good. My husband loved the fisherman's stew and my son enjoyed his panini. The service was slow. My sirloin was overcooked and the waitress was not to be found to tell her that for 25-30 minutes. By the time she came back, everyone was done with their meal and I had a whole $25 dinner in front of me waiting to ask her to return it to the kitchen.  She asked if I'd like a box and I politely explained saying no, this is well done and I asked for medium rare. We had to box up the new dinner...though my older son, who was at home and was the lucky recipient of the new steak, said it was perfect. My 11 yo son was appalled by the waitress when my husband asked for a dessert by saying I'll have the_____ please and she said ' no you're not.....cause we don't have any left.'  A bit later my son had a dessert in front of him that he and my husband were sharing. He was almost finished when the waitress came and grabbed his plate. I said 'oh, I don't think they are finished with that'. Instead of putting his plate back down, the proper/normal response...she picks up the spoon and sticks the last bite in my son's mouth! Saying 'open up!' Um, excuse me??? My son is 11 & can feed himself and even if he couldn't, I wouldn't have some stranger sticking food in his mouth...this waitress crossed the line there... personal boundaries lady! My son was his normal witty self & says 'Ok we must NEVER speak of this again!!' with a smile but I know he was embarrassed.

Potato head (vegan bun and no sour cream)The buns were sweet and the combinations were flavorful. I did prefer the mr.potatohead over the veganville being that sweet potato and corn paired well together. I also got the fakinit tots and I LOVED the tofu bacon. It was so unexpectedly delicious. My husband got the hogzilla, firecracker shrimp, and kickin chicken. His favorite was the firecracker shrimp although he is not a fan of guacamole which was actually surprising to me. The hogzilla was apparently too sweet but overall everything was delish. He also got fire tots which I could tell were good by the description. My grandma got mr.

I have to say though, that this experience thankfully surpassed my expectations as set by Yelp.\\n\\nAfter making a reservation for 8pm we ended up getting there 20 minutes early. Luckily, there was one open 2-person table so we were seated immediately. Our drink orders were taken and filled quickly despite the full house.\\n\\nWe both ordered the Chef's Table option on the menu. The waitress asked each of us a few questions like what level of spice we're comfortable with, what things we don't eat, allergies, preferred level of doneness for beef, tuna, etc.  The chef then creates a unique 5-course meal with no relation to the standard menu.\\n\\nWe've never done anything like this before, and we had a great time.  We loved the anticipation involved in waiting for the next course, not knowing anything about what it was going to be. Even the waitress had no idea until it came out, since apparently the chef decides what to do on the fly. \\n\\nSo what did we get?  Well, you'll have to excuse the non-foodie vocabulary and the incomplete descriptions because while everything was fully explained to us as we received it, much of the description went in one ear and out the other.  I took photos of each course with my cellphone camera, so also please excuse the terrible photos since it was very dimly lit inside.\\n\\nFirst course: A large sea scallop, which was perfectly cooked, alongside some curried pineapple and pineapple puree and something green. A fantastic start to the meal, I found myself cutting the scallop really thin to make it last as long as possible because I didn't want to stop eating it.\\n\\nSecond Course: Three varieties of tuna. On the left, tuna kobachi and sriracha. Center, lime ceviche, and on the right, pepper crusted with mango salsa. All three were amazing, with my favorite being the pepper-crusted tuna.\\n\\nThird course: Three styles of beef. On the bottom, it was topped with some sort of preparation of onion that I can't remember. Upper right was topped with a mushroom glaze, and my favorite at the upper left was a boysenberry-based sauce that was incredible (and not as sweet as it sounds).  Again, all three were excellent.\\n\\nFourth course: Lamb in a pomegranate sauce with walnuts. The lamb was nicely cooked but there was too much sauce for me and it was so intense that it overpowered the flavor of the meat.\\n\\nFifth course: Pineapple and mango sorbet in vodka.  This was very strong, and a bit difficult to eat.  This was my least favorite course.\\n\\nOkay, so not everything was 100% perfect for us, at least not in the final two courses.  But as far as I'm concerned, that's part of the experience.  You're not always going to love everything put in front of you 100% of the time, everyone's tastes are different.  You're asking to be surprised, and that comes with the territory. Nothing we had was outright bad, and everything put in front of us was completely finished.\\n\\nDon't do this if you're in a hurry or if you're averse to trying new things.  Also, don't select this option if your opinion of value is inextricably linked to portion size -- while I was fully satisfied by the end of the final course, I was not completely over-stuffed. To me, that's a good thing.\\n\\nOur server was great, our wine glasses never went dry and the water glasses were filled with an equal quickness.

Christopher's","address":"1438 Dresden Dr","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"If I could give it a negative 10, I would.  We are regular customers because this restaurant is convenient, but not because it is particularly good.  In fact, we have to wait for a hostess EVERY time we enter because she is always away from the station.  It takes longer than it should to get an order of mediocre food, but it's close to our home and relatively easy with small kids, so we have continued to patronize this place.  However, we will NEVER return. \\nMy husband was served an entire raw egg (shell and all) in his breakfast order.  He realized it after taking a large bite, so he ingested some of the shell and raw egg.  Our sweet server (he really was great) took the order off the bill and apologized.  \\nHowever, my husband thought it would be appropriate to comp the remainder of the breakfast since his experience made us all queasy.  No one could continue eating after we saw that nasty raw egg.  The manager (also very kind) explained that she \\"was not authorized\\" to comp the entire breakfast, despite the fact that she knows us as regulars, and she did believe we were correct in our request. We had two adults (my husband and me) and two little children with us, so our bill was only around $30. \\nThe manager explained that policy dictated that she CALL the owner, and brought the portable phone to our TABLE.  My husband explained the situation to the owner, Barry.  My jaw nearly hit the table as Barry proceeded to ARGUE with my husband for nearly 10 minutes.  When my husband stated that he would need to contact the Board of Health due to the possibility that he consumed something harmful, Barry insisted that \\"he felt threatened.\\"  I was appalled (I would use a stronger word if one existed) that this owner of a local business would argue with a customer, lose future business, and then feign fear when confronted with the consequence of us justifiably contacting the BoH.  All of this time spent over a $30ish bill!  Out of respect for the manager and server, I will not repeat what they think of this man, but suffice it to say that they agreed he was being ridiculous.\\nAfter doing some minimal research, my husband kindly decided against posting a negative review and, instead, contacted a mutual friend.  This friend contacted Barry directly, and he evidently \\"doubled-down\\" on his position that raw egg and shell should not constitute a free breakfast.  This mutual friend recommended that we take our business somewhere else, because Barry considers himself \\"an egg expert,\\" and still felt he was correct in his handling of this situation.  \\nEvidently, Barry has not heard the phrase, \\"The customer is always right,\\" and he has lost our business forever.  He has also lost the business of everyone we know and everyone that our friends know.  Brookhaven is a small town, and word-of-mouth is powerful.  This experience is the WORST I have ever had in a restaurant in my entire life.

For drinks, I got the Hyderabad tonic, and my friends got the Kerala, Kumaon cup, Malabar old fashioned, and Patna fizz. The table favorites were the tonic and Kumaon cup, and I thought the fizz was super interesting and different with the lychee flavor and the truffle salt! Only the Kerala was super sweet. The tonic went down very very easy. \\n\\nFor starters, I split the Dahi puri and green pea and goat cheese kulcha, while my friends split the lamb keema hyderabadi. The bun that the keema came with looked so appetizing and so fluffy! The kulcha was very different from traditional Indian flavors with the goat cheese, and I really enjoyed it. I wish the dahi puri had more dahi and chutney, and the filling was a bit bland. It would also have been nice to have some sev or boondi on top for added crunch.\\n\\nFor dinner, I got the tandoori mushroom and a chili cheese naan. The mushrooms were everyone's favorite dish: very flavorful, and the polenta upma was a great compliment. We got a free side of dal, which was a very rich, classic dal makhani. My friends got the butter chicken, Achari monk fish, and beef short ribs curry, with three orders of garlic naan. Everyone really liked the butter chicken, which was also pretty classic. The short ribs were a smaller portion than my friend had hoped for, and we sopped up the last drops of the monkfish sauce! The garlic naan was decent, and each order comes with a 2 whole naan cut into halves. \\n\\nFinally, we got the carrot halwa cake for dessert, which comes with honey and saffron sorbet. The sorbet was really good but I didn't love the cake -- the halwa was fine but the cake layers seemed a bit dry/bland. \\n\\nAs for why I gave 3 stars -- there's no question the food is pretty decent. However, this is by far the most I've ever paid for Indian food, and unfortunately I'm not sure if it was worth the price. I see that this is a different spin on Indian food, but overall I felt like the flavors lacked the hearty spice (both the hot and flavorful kinds) I'm used to, and some of the food didn't quite hit the mark.

Surprisingly, and the reason I am writing this review, is that they were selling muffins and apple strudel that were purchased FROM COSTCO!!!

It was overcooked, extremely salty, and a very small portion - it had more lemon and artichoke pieces than calamari (see picture)\\n\\n2) My wife had the butternut squash risotto but it had blue cheese in it, which totally overwhelmed the flavor of the dish.  The menu listed the cheese in French so my wife did not know it was blue cheese when she ordered it.

We thought that the restaurant was trying to get rid of their fish they had on hand and did not get fish delivered since it was the holidays. We told our waitress that the calamari was \\"past its expiration date\\".  She apologized and offered to provide another appetizer of our choosing and took the calamari off our bill.

Truly the worst tacos I've ever had, including that one time I went to Taco Bell while sober. \\n\\nThe positives: the rice and beans are fantastic despite the carne asada carnage, they take Apple Pay, the service is quick and friendly enough which minimizes then pain, decent beer selection, and the breath mints at the exit are fairly kick-a$$.\\n\\nThe negatives: I've said enough about the tacos, the menu wasn't clean (always a harbinger), no free chips and salsa (an outrage) and there is nothing authentic about it.\\n\\nSave yourself $30 a person and go to Taco Bell!"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The service was all over the place.

The ordering process reminds me of the Blaze Pizza process, and I'm not sure which came first, but if you know how to order at one, you'll know how to order at the other.\\n\\nUpon walking in, you're immediately greeted by friendly MOD staff behind the counter. There's an area to line up naturally in front of the counter, with a huge menu on the wall for you to admire before you step up to the ordering counter. I like the idea of writing down the food order on the serving plate and that follows you through the ordering process so ideally you receive exactly as you've ordered, right? For us, that was not the case. Our order was pretty simple: Mad Dog + mushroom + cauliflower crust. We got 2/3 of the requests, so I think that's a win but could be better. The lady behind the counter even confirmed our addition of mushroom to the pizza so I'm very surprised she missed this on our actual order.\\n\\nThe pizza itself was very good. There were several times that my friend and I questioned if the crust was truly cauliflower - it was so good! The cauliflower crust is crispy and cooked very well; you can't even tell you're not even eating a big plate of dough. The sauce and meat had good flavor and the sauce ratio was delicious. My only complaint with this pizza was that it was very, very oily, but that could be because of the amount of meats on the pizza. \\n\\nOverall verdict: MOD is a great option to satisfy your fresh, fast pizza craving!"},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The last time I had good authentic Thai food was in Dunwoody/Sandy Springs area.

People come from all over the WORLD to see the iconic indoor pit-o'-heaping-meat and eat some fantastic 'q. \\n\\nI'd been here once before and was coming to Driftwood to meet up with a friend. I said, \\"We HAVE to stop at Salt Lick.\\"  Word to the wise, \\"GET THERE EARLY!\\"  We arrived shortly before they opened. The staff was gracious enough to seat us and get our drinks before they were officially supposed to. Major points for stellar service!  Within the hour we were there, though, that large dining room we were in was full. \\n\\nWe both ordered the Thurman's Plate which comes with brisket, some of their sausage and one pork rib. It also has sides of slaw, beans, their own version of a potato salad as well as some additional stuff like jalape√±os, onions, pickles and bread. When it arrives it's a VISUAL feast to the eyes!\\n\\nThe meat.....what can I say? Just throw away your knife - you don't need it. We got a brisket sampling of moist meat, lean meat and burnt ends (thankfully before they ran out within that hour we were there).  It all melted like buttah!  Amazing flavor, incredible bark. I'm guessing they're using sugar in their rub because there's some good caramelization going on there. The sausage was equally delicious. Great bite with the right amount of fat and spices. The pork rib I got, unfortunately, was lacking some meat. The main \\"rib\\" portion was mostly bone with a scant layer of meat along it. What was there was definitely tasty, though. \\n\\nOne thing you should be aware of, unless you tell them otherwise (and you should) your meat will come with sauce on it. I would've thought they followed the Texas BBQ purists credo that insists sauce goes on the side. It allows you to taste the true flavor of the meat without \\"covering it up\\" with sauce. To their credit, it's good sauce but, next time, I'll remember. \\n\\nThe sides....hmmm.... well, I don't know of any place that's famous for their sides and the Salt Lick is no exception.  The beans were cold and somewhat mushy - the flavor was made better by cutting up and adding the jalape√±o. The potato salad is like some kind of spin on a German potato salad that tastes like they incorporated some their sauce into it. It was alright... just different. The slaw was.... meh. \\n\\nPrices are on par with most BBQ joints in the Hill Country. There's incredible ambience with this place, so paying for that is abundantly acceptable.

So my group trekked out 20 miles from Austin during Hurricane Harvey to come try it out!  It was storming and the place was empty.  Our party of 15 was seated quite quickly.  \\n\\nWe all did AYCE which is $25 (CASH ONLY) and the three sides you get are coleslaw, beans and potatoes.  The coleslaw was the best of the sides as it wasn't sweet like typical coleslaw but it wasn't salty either.  The beans were good and the potatoes were quite bland.  The meats that came out were pork ribs, brisket and sausages.  You have one plate which all the meats come out on and they will get you more meat once you clear that plate.  So if there is something that you don't like, ask for a plate without it otherwise you'll stare at each other to figure out who has to eat the crappy pork ribs.  The pork ribs were below average to average at best.  I personally think I can make ribs better in my Instant Pot at home.  It was dry and chewy and I didn't bother eating anymore after the first one.  The brisket was hit or miss depending on what piece you got.  We asked for fatty brisket after getting a few plates of just dry brisket and our next plate was marginally more fatty and somewhat tasty.  The sausages are arguably the most consistently tasty thing but who knows what's in a sausage.  I was very surprised at how many accolades I read about this place because none of us were really impressed.  \\n\\nOur server's name was Juan and he sucked.  He was friendly at first but after a few plates, we would give us dirty looks when we asked for more.  Like seriously?  Is your dirty looks supposed to discourage us from getting more food after we're paying for AYCE?    We were in Austin celebrating a bachelor party (me being the bachelor) so I didn't want to make a scene but any other occasion I would have asked to see the manager to see what the problem was.  We were given boxes to take home our leftovers.\\n\\nJuan left a nastier taste in our mouths then the pork ribs did.  Unfortunately I was not able to try any other barbecue places in Austin so I can't make any comparisons but I would not refer any of my friends to drive out to The Salt Lick for their mediocre barbecue.

I was not at all expecting it to 1) take 20 minutes to be made and 2) be completely cold.

Parking was pretty easy- there is a big lot across the street which is free.\\n\\nBetween six of us, we ordered one diavolo and two margherita pizzas.  I think one pizza for every two people in the group is a good portion size.  I ate the diavolo, which was flavorful and excellent.  I love spicy food, and found the red peppers to be very spicy.  I also tried a slice of the margherita, which was tasty but was bland compared to the diavolo.\\n\\nI'm a huge cannoli fan, so I had to try the chocolate chip one (they have 5 different flavors).  While it's certainly no Mike's Pastry, it's pretty good for Atlanta standards.  The shell isn't soggy like you get at a lot of places.\\n\\nThe set-up of the place adds to the charm too.  It sounds like a pain in the ass, but it's actually pretty funny to see everyone in the kitchen jostling over empty seats at the tables.  It's hot in there too, so don't come here dressed in jeans and a long sleeved shirt.\\n\\nThey definitely draw a yuppie crowd- the parking lot was filled with luxury cars.  I was expecting a lot of twentysomethings, but it was a lot of older couples.  Quite a few small kids too.  \\n\\nThe BYOB is great- there is a gas station a block away so pick up your beer there and it won't get warm.

Compared to Medina, the brunch menu at Chambar IS much smaller, and only takes up about half a page with about 6-7 options. They will usually have a non-menu special as well. I ended up ordering the fricasee, which is actually served all day, and is a pretty hearty (albeit very flavourful and savoury) dish for breakfast. It contains braised short ribs, balsamic cipollini onions, potatoes, watercress, fried eggs, and a slice of applewood smoked cheddar. I really enjoyed the dish, which was flavoured well (a tad on the salty side), and had a great balance of meat, vegetables, fruit, egg, cheese, etc. The short ribs were very soft and tender. I would totally recommend this! I actually think I tried this exact same dish once at Medina, but for some reason I enjoyed it more here.

I had read tons of great reviews about this place and also saw that it was popular among vegetarians so we wanted to give it a go. When we arrived at the restaurant, it wasn't very busy so we would have been able to get seats right away. Unfortunately, we couldn't even make it through the front door.  When we reached the door, we couldn't open it. There was an outer door and an inner door with a small corridor space in between. When I tried to open the inner door into the restaurant, it wouldn't budge. The woman staff member inside saw that I couldn't open the door and kept on waving her hands at me, rudely signalling me to shut the outer door. The problem was that there was not enough room for me to shut the outer door since there were multiple people in that space. Then she started yelling at me through the door to shut the other door first. She said that it was cold and to shut the door. She was constantly yelling at us repeating the same phrase \\"SHUT THE DOOR. IT'S COLD.\\" When I say yelling, I actually mean YELLING, very rudely and condescendingly at us. She could have helped open the door for us or even just told us in a regular tone of voice that we should shut the other door first, instead of waving her hands around and yelling, but I guess it was too cold for her? With that treatment, we turned around. No use eating there even if the review of the food is fabulous. Customer service is an important part of the experience, and considering that it started off that badly, there's no way we would have had a good dinner there. \\nAs we were passing by the front window while leaving, she gave us a weird look like \\"what are you doing? Come back.\\" But there was no way that we would want to go have dinner in a restaurant that already harassed us before setting foot in the front door.

My coworkers back home told me about their sauce and how it was probably the best pasta they've ever had. If they're making these claims, how can you not give this place a try?\\n\\nWhen you arrive, you'll notice quite a long line outside the restaurant. You can't put your name down and you can't wait inside. So the fact that it's freezing cold outside, a 1 hour to 2 hour wait just does not seem ideal. But, everyone leaving the restaurant told me it was absolutely worth it so we just had to suck it up and wait. \\n\\nThe restaurant isn't too big on the inside, maybe 10-12 small tables that shift around for larger parties. For two people, we waited about an hour or so, just because the larger parties in front of us weren't ready and they could only fit two anyways. The menu is very straightforward and is organized by the type of pasta you want.\\n\\nHere's the run down:\\nChoose from Linguine, Fettuccini, Ziti, Ravioli.\\nIf you choose Linguine, you can pick the type of seafood you want with it: mussels, calamari, clams, scallops, shrimp and even lobster (if they have it).

WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. \\n\\nNow comes the sauce, Pesto, Red, Fra Diabolo, Giacomo, Fracomo and Scampi. We tried the Red because that was my coworker's recommendation.

It might seem like they're very straight to the point, but I think they really take their time to make sure you're enjoying yourself. It can feel cramped, but it's because they're trying to sit as many parties as they can. Service was great when I went. They brought us warm buttery garlic bread, and even extra bread when we wanted it to soak up the sauce. He also gave us extra plates and extra napkins because we really looked like we needed it.

The shared bathrooms weren't a problem - always clean, and we never ran into a situation where there wasn't an unoccupied one for us to use.  The downside to this particular location is the noise.  Yes, the walls are thin, but the guests were all respectful.  The street noise, however, is tremendous.  Lots of yelling and honking until after 2am, then downtown commuters and deliveries and garbage trucks start up around 4, so that doesn't leave much time for rest.  We were on the top floor, but that didn't do us any favors.  Based on the poor quality of sleep I had here, I would opt for staying at the Kennedy School next time instead, which also has free parking.

The Prosciutto sandwich is awesome and they give you the option to switch chips out for a side salad, which I highly recommend you do.

I've honestly never been to a Mexican place that charges for salsa (although this place isn't really Mexican food.. more Mexican influenced).. and wants $2 for every refill. AND $13 for guacamole?! Just insane. Anyways, we ended up getting the chips and salsa and they were alright. I got the wet burrito and my husband got 3 tacos- shrimp, carne asada and fish I believe. His tacos were alright. The tortillas tasted like they could have just come from the grocery store. My burrito wasn't bad, but there were soooo much beans and rice and little of everything else. But I'm glad it came with guacamole, salsa and sour cream on the side for a bit of refreshment. We also got the churros (to go, but I ate one right away while we were there so I could taste it fresh) and they were filled with grease and not cooked on the inside. \\n\\nI wanted to give this place 3 stars, but our server Sara (she's new there and and has glasses) was SO sweet and pleasant.

The Lower Depths told the story of an elderly Japanese man and his rather bitter younger wife, who essentially rented out rundown rooms to the poor.  Their clientele consisted of prostitutes, gamblers, thieves, drunks, and souls whose better days were long since behind them.   Over time, the relationships formed amidst the tenants and landlords and families became unsurprisingly yet grossly compromised; affairs, thievery, and murder attempts were simply par for the course.   However, while the story predictably does not come with the happiest of endings, and much is left in ruins, shambles and distress, the film rumbles with comic relief just beneath the surface.  \\n\\nFor example, one tenant, an aging actor who refuses to give in to his years, loses his ability to memorize lines.  Then there is a destitute who claims to have descended from samurai, the validity of his story fascinatingly sought for, and the end result proving him to be insane.  Then there's the gaggle of happy drunks who appear randomly throughout the film when you least expect them, whose purpose seems to be to revel and rejoice in others' misfortune.    So is this film a sordid glance at lives poisoned with hard knocks and indecency?  Or is it what lies just below, the unseen and the unimagined, the laughter when you least expect it, that is the essence of The Lower Depths?\\n\\nPerhaps that's a little secret that only those who have had the fortune of watching the film could be let in on.  Such is the case with the little tap room that could, tucked away but not hidden, loved but only by those who know that it's possible.   There's more to this place than what anyone could dream of, but you have to know where to look.\\n\\nThere's a reason it's a quieter, more subdued place.  At times, it can reek of a ghost town - its doors opening and closing all but once during a single day for one person to partake in what is offered there.   But unlike the desolate establishments that suffer similar fates from time to time, the story of the ghost town days of The Lower Depths are told to a bar full of customers the next day, with a hint of mystery and excitement; nowhere to run, nothing to hide.\\n\\nI could easily tell you - and anyone that will listen - that The Lower Depths has a menu that will excite you.  It will.   Dollar hot dogs with a wide array of toppings to put on them that you wouldn't even dream of, tater tots, mac and cheese, burgers, soups and stews, and daily specials.   And true to its moniker, you can easily enjoy a beer you haven't remembered about in awhile, or go with the ordinary and be just as satisfied.   But it's what is not on the menu, not hung up on the walls, not plainly displayed that encompasses the true magic of this place.  \\n\\nAnd perhaps you will never be able to see that, but I sure hope you do."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Today I finally made it down to this location, as I usually go to our closest location in Round Rock.

We had to get up and go get our waiter, and talked to a bus boy and had to wait about 5 minutes before we got silverware while our food was getting cold.

We also asked for boxes and the check and it seemed to take forever for the server to get back to us. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good and most of the people in our party were pretty satisfied. The chicken in particular was incredibly good.

Our group came in around 7:30 and was seated immediately on the heated, outdoor patio (otherwise, our wait was one hour +). There was a heat lamp for every two tables (but every table was covered) and complimentary blankets on every chair, which is great or else I would have frozen out there.\\n\\nThe menu is split into three main categories - meats and cheeses, tapas, and entrees.

Chicken was slightly over done probably - crust seemed too toasty, slightly dry inside. Kimchi didn't come through that much. The fish bao tasted like a filet o fish at McDonald's, basically fried fish with a whole bunch of mayo. Overall I'd say the flavors were pretty generic.

I'm sure the other entrees are good but I stand by the steak 100%. To be exact, I'm enamored by the filet. Whether you get the bone in or regular 6 ounce piece, you'll be happy. They cook it to your taste (medium rare for me) and it's served on a piping hot plate soaked in butter. Every time I get it, it's relatively consistent. I say relatively because it's always good but sometimes it basically melts in your mouth. I'm not kidding. No star deduction since I'm comparing great with fantastic lol. All the sides are a la carte but they are also good as well. There's not a bad thing I can say about the food.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in the old state building and it looks like you're walking into a neoclassical mansion. It's beautiful but a little confusing to get around and use the restroom if it's you're first time. Don't be afraid to ask for directions. In terms of wait staff, they are on another level and I assume it's pretty difficult to work here without prior experience on the same caliber. They answered every question I had without fail and I don't think I ever heard anyone say \\"ummm\\". I've had at least 8 different people so that says a lot. The wait can be a little bit long sometimes even with a reservation but I can't fault them for being busy. Easy parking if you valet but slightly difficult to find anything nearby. If you don't valet and you don't see parking on the little side streets, you might have to park at Boston common and walk over.\\n\\nGreat place for fantastic steak and upscale dining."},{"name":"Sea Thai","address":"3812 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Favorite Thai restaurant in Orlando by far.

Even though it came with fried food, at least there was some greens. \\n\\nThe only downside about this BLT is that it fell apart a little too much.

Excellent sauce, yummy sausage. Liked the peppers. The crust is superb. \\n\\nNapoletana (broccoli rabe, salsiccia, bufala) $21--This pizza doesn't come with tomato sauce. I missed the sauce, but I really liked the huge hunks of sausage and felt semi-healthy for eating vegetables. Recommended.\\n\\nDiavola (spicy sopressata, pepperonata, bufala), $22--Spice lovers, this is your pie. A little too hot for me, but those with more tolerant tongues will be pleased.\\n\\nPizzas are slightly salty. Antico chars the crust a bit so you will end up with sooty smudges on your fingers, if you're not a knife and forker. The pizzas are thin and have about eight slices to a pie. A person could eat roughly half of a pie; the pizzas come in just one size. \\n\\nDon't show up too late since the dough sometimes runs out. The women taking your orders and bringing you your pies are detached but not rude or anything.

My boyfriend surprised me with a dinner reservation for omakase for my passing the Georgia bar. We've only had omakase at Umi and so this was our first time having the experience at Nakato. Comparatively, it was just not very good. The fish didn't taste very fresh and everything was really fishy, rather than a clean taste. But the biggest reason for the 1 star is because there was a cockroach right in front of us. We were seated at the sushi bar and we saw the cockroach going in and out of the crack near the glass refrigerated sushi case. We were shocked but I wanted to make sure the sushi chefs and staff were aware so I was able to capture it with the lid of the miso soup that came as part of our course. We alerted the sushi chef and he lifted the lid and it quickly crawled out but eventually he was able to kill it with a napkin. Obviously that completely ruined our appetite. A lady (probably the manager?) came and apologized for witnessing what we did and asked if we wanted to move to a different seat...Uhhh what? How does that change anything? That was a pretty unintelligent response. We told her we were done with our meal and asked for the check. She came back with the check and it showed a discount of $70.

When we arrived I immediately was drawn to the energy this place gave off.  It is a nice and tranquil environment with a large crowd; it was a hot and sunny day but there was plenty of shade to cool off under with all the trees they have on the grounds. Upon entering I was reminded of an old country town or even a market, similar to the environment at the \\"Gristmill\\" near San Antonio, with it's own flair of course. \\n**CASH ONLY** Go to the ATM before coming here. They do have an ATM but there is a fee and a line. \\nThe wait for a table was over 2 hours so we decided to order to go instead, however even that was a little over an hour wait. \\n\\n*Please do not make the mistake we made and not come prepared; this place is BYOB. So, bring your coolers filled with drinks because although this place is a vineyard and has a wide selection of wines, it is still better to BYOB. Plus, it helps pass the time in the heat of the outdoors. \\n\\nWhile waiting, we walked the grounds and took pictures and tried out some of the lemonade and snacks they sale there. My husband and I were also able to get away to walk to the \\"adults only\\" area and grab a drink, which was nice. \\n\\nAfter about an hour and half of a wait, the buzzer we were given to let us know that our order was ready went off and we went to get our meals. My daughters ordered the ribs child plate, which they loved and devoured. My son had the chicken plate and my husband and I had the brisket and ribs with potatoes au gratin, beans and bread with all the fixings. The bbq sauce was a light sweet bbq sauce, ribs were fall off the bone, suck your fingers, tender and good (highly recommend the ribs), the brisket was good as well, however I actually enjoyed my son's chicken better than the brisket. The sides were also great and the food was enough to take home some as well.\\n\\nOverall, I was very happy and enjoyed my time at The Salt Lick.

This place is ridiculously bi-polar and let me tell you why. I came here with my dad for a nice lunch, and the place is very nice, very quiet. It's got a great Irish ambiance along with a great Irish gift shop and great Irish waiters. The restaurant is also HUGE, along with a huge outside patio area, so it is very difficult to NOT get a table for lunch (dinner is a WHOLE different story, I'll get to that later). For lunch I got the Irish Meatball Sandwich which was amazingly tasty. They had 4 meatballs in a nice baguette with a nice olive oil sauce with salt and pepper and cilantro, along with nice slices of Parmesan cheese. The only problem with this sandwich is that every single bite I took, more of the meatballs fell out the back end of the sandwich and they fell right on the plate. It seemed like a total waste to have the bread considering I spent more time eating it with a fork than with the bread. Even so, it was a very tasty and delicious sandwich, and it was considered their specialty sandwich. Now I'll get to why I gave this place only 2 stars (actually 2.5, but I don't have the option for that and it doesn't deserve 3) and why I call this place bi-polar. At night for dinner, this place is mobbed. It is incredibly difficult to get a table. At 8:15, it was a 30-40 minute wait, which was actually the shortest wait out of all the other restaurants. Not only was it packed, but it was certainly accustomed to Irish traditions. There were so many drunk people in this place it was ridiculous. Some A-hole from Boston finished his drink and put it on our table while we were eating. Then like 3 managers patrolling the restaurant went on like a search mission for the guy, which they ended up failing at miserably which doesn't make any sense to me. You have 3 sober and very large guys going after one drunk and fat man and they can't find him. He was also wearing a lot of redsox stuff. Anyway, this restaurant is also incredibly loud at dinner and there are a lot of Irish dancers dancing all over the place, along with a whole Irish band. The music wasn't bad, nor was it the problem, it was just the amount of screaming drunk guys that were causing problems for a conversation. Not only was it the drunk guys, but their girlfriends or friends that were girls that were also drunk. I'm telling you, if you're looking to get lucky one night, you'd have the easiest time doing so at this restaurant. These girls pound drinks! Now I know it's wrong to take advantage of a drunk girl, but it's really only bad if you're sober and you get them drunk. If they get themselves drunk and you're already drunk, well, make sure you prepare breakfast for 2. HAHAHA! I kill myself. Anyway, going back to the food, I had taken a look at the menu (a dinner menu that was 10x as large as the lunch menu) and I barely understood what half of it was saying. They made all these stupid jokes where they tried to write things like they were pronouncing all of the syllables and it's like what are you saying! I just want to read English! I ended up having the roast chicken with mashed potatoes which wasn't really bad but it was very plain. There was really nothing special about it. I mean it was tasty but it wasn't very different from anything. It really didn't stand out at all. After a night of incredibly loud and rude and annoying people (not children this time, but adults who act like children (like seriously why do people drink beer so much I mean it smells like complete crap and it has absolutely horrible after effects on your body. It also makes you incredibly fat)), my father and I called it a night. Not recommended for night time unless you drink a lot, but pretty recommended for lunchtime. No fancy attire needed, by the way."},{"name":"Promise Land Cafe","address":"3513 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This is my new favorite middle eastern place in Portland!

It's funny to think that my boyfriend and I finally got to visit it when we were adventuring through East Austin. That day, it'd been raining and Via 313 was our haven from the wet weather. Who knew pizza could be so great on a rainy day?\\n\\nInside, the restaurant was filled with wooden finishes and exposed brick walls; it felt casual and inviting. Our waitress came to us quickly and asked if we've been to the restaurant before. We hadn't and she gave us a well informed run down of the place with a side of on the house meatballs! That always makes me feel nice; free food. Tehe. \\nAfter looking at the menu, we wanted to sample more than one flavor. We chose a split 4 square Detroit Style (thick crust) between the Cadillac and the Ambassador.\\n\\nBEST DECISION OF MY LIFE. (Well, for my palate, of course, hopefully for yours too!)\\n\\nThe Cadillac wasn't classic at all, in the best way, while the Ambassador was classic reinvented! It might sound odd to some, but for those who can relate, I had a great time eating these pizzas! \\nI love contrasting flavors and the Cadillac brought sweet pockets of fig jam, drizzles of balsamic glaze, and layers of salty prosciutto to balance it all off. Sounds odd, but you'll get it the moment it reaches your mouth. \\nOn the other hand, the Ambassador was a meat lovers paradise. I'm not one to reach for a slice like that, but now I've been converted. It had a proportional amount of meat for each slice and they've delicately pipped these beautiful, luscious dollops of ricotta cheese to lighten the pizza. MHH, mhhhhh, MH!?! I'm mentally eating this pizza as I write this review! \\n\\nIn the end, Via 313 is definitely worth a try. In my opinion, for once, the hype is telling you the truth! The experience and the food from the restaurant is great and it shows!"},{"name":"Super Burrito Express","address":"10506 SE 42nd Ave","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"3.5","text":"Been coming here for years and it's always good.

We arrived at about 1am and when I tell you the atmosphere was so trash. Everybody is smoking, nobody's dancing and there isn't much room for anybody to sit or stand. The VIP sections are a joke because people waiting at the bar practically overflow into the sections. Also every time we found a place to vibe stupid security told us we had to keep moving. Sir where are we going??? There's literally nowhere to go. OH, and let me not forget about the bottle service waitress that practically pushed and shoved me, my friends and everybody out the way. I get it's crowded but there's no reason to do all that. Luckily I was in a good mood but someone else may not be if your waitresses keep pushing the wrong people. The DJ was trash too. We left in a hurry, literally 20 mins after we entered.\\n\\nEscobar needs to get it together. Until it does a whole revamp I will not step foot in here, idc what they have going on. \\n\\n\\nPREVIOUS REVIEW: Man..... I don't even know where to start. But I'll try. \\n\\nI came into Escobar last night after 255 up the street was a bust. First, I will say that the hostess and waitress were very nice, and were also accommodating. They are the reason why I gave a star. Also, the decor is nice and the music is good, giving this another star. But the rest?\\n\\nService here is SLOW SLOW SLOWWWWW. My friends and I placed an order for a fishbowl (which isn't even a fishbowl it was more like a goblet cup that they give you) and I swear we waited about an hour for that fishbowl alone. The waitress came to us and said the reason for the hold up was that they didn't have all the ingredients needed to make the drink. But apparently, they made it work because finally, the drink had arrived. Drink was strong but it wasn't anything I'd rave over. Then, we ordered some food that took at least another hour to come out. I ordered the fried calamari and it was ok, nothing special. After reading  the reviews about the food and failing inspection I'm lucky to be alive (definitely won't eat here again). After about 3 hours, the waitress asked if we wanted a hookah. The hookah was subpar, and burned out quickly. If the music wasn't good and if I hadn't had drinks prior to Escobar, I definitely would've been ready to hit the door after the wait for the drink. \\n\\nI would be willing to give this place another chance but I think it'll be a while before I come back here."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Like the rest of the reviews on here say...chicken and waffles are amazing.

A mango chutney accompanied one of the dishes on the table and it was done very well. Tofu was marinated in Indian spices and then shallow fried. That was the unhealthy part. \\nTook off one star, coz deep inside me somewhere it felt, veg/vegan food shouldnt ever cost more than a non-veg dish! A little steep on the $ I should say.

I decided to head into the seaport location and give that location a try.  The location was easy to find using GPS.  I was concerned that I'd have to pay for parking but as it was a Sunday afternoon, I was able to pull up right in front  where they offer a few spots for up to 20 minutes.  As I wasn't planning on eating there, it worked for me!  I also noticed there was a parking right across the street for those who plan on staying longer.  (not sure of the garage pricing though).\\n\\nI ordered the following:\\nIced Latte- (very good and prepared the way I like it!)\\nSticky Bun (I'm not a huge fan of sticky buns and thus don't have much of a comparison but as this is their signature item, I gave it a try.)  Perhaps a few too many pecans for me but it had plenty of caramel and the breading was soft.  Not sure I'd order another one but it was worth a try.\\nChocolate Cream Pie slice - quite tasty and not overly sweet!\\nBreakfast sandwich - the egg was more like a soufle, very light and airy.  I didn't taste much cheese on the sandwich and I wasn't crazy about the sauce they threw on (tasted like a dijonaise dressing of some sort).  If I were to get the sandwich again, I'd ask them to leave off the dressing/sauce.\\n\\nAll in all, I would say that Flour offers quality baked goods/coffee/sandwiches.  I probably wouldn't attempt to go there on a weekday as the location is rather small and parking would be a pain.  There were several tables crowded.  Many families were there on a Sunday and took up all of the tables with parents sitting at separate tables away from their children and taking up the whole dining area.  They had a few high top tables with two seats.  I would never plan on bringing my laptop to work there as there were just too many noisy kids.

The crab cake was not my favorite, but it wasn't bad.  I think it might have just been the combination- crab cake and bao- that ultimately just didn't work for me.

The ambience is great during off-peak hours when you don't have to fight to the death for a seat. However, the dining room can get pretty toasty because of the ovens, so if you sweat easily then mentally prepare yourself for possible pit stains. The dining and kitchen/oven area is really just one room, so it can get a little awkward when the sweaty pizza bakers are just watching you eat. I actually feel pretty bad for them...they must feel like they're working in a sauna. \\n\\nAnyway, the margherita pizza is just under $20. Not cheap, but not expensive, either. \\n\\nI gave the place 4 stars because even though the simple margherita pizzas are delicious and taste fairly healthy (as far as pizzas go), the bottom is usually soggy or charred black. I don't know if Antico is merely emphasizing the \\"authentic, oven\\" experience or just really bad at taking them out of the oven in time, but if I want burnt food then I could just stay at home and eat my own cooking.  \\n\\nOverall, this place has a lot of hype, and I can see where it comes from.

When we were seated the hostess gave us the regular menus and made no mention of restaurant week. Our waiter (when he finally came to our table... I'll get to that later) also said nothing. We finally asked him for the restaurant week menus, we immediately felt like subpar diners.

While food may be great it is the service that really defines a place...this place has VERY poor customer service. As a minority individual I am appalled at the treatment I received while dining tonight. After paying $28 on a pizza (which while good just isn't THAT great) our order was missing. Why you ask? Because they gave it away to someone who claimed they had our order number without checking the ticket. \\n\\nAfter 30 minutes we inquired about our pizza ourselves. When the servers noted their mistake they assured us our food would be out right away. It came 20 minutes later incorrect. After sending the food back I requested to see a manager. He finally made his way over after we received our correct order with not a hint of remorse. We were told that mistakes happen and I should take a look around and see how busy they are. After I asked for a refund he berated me and raised his voice. I then told him I would never return to Antico...he shrugged then returned to the kitchen to give an animated recap to his staff. \\n\\nDisgusting. Mission number one...I'll be contacting the owners of Antico and pressing post for this review. TERRIBLE... Mr. Manager...whoever you are...though you may have felt smug in front of your employees when you went to the kitchen and laughed and gestured how you silenced me in front of my young mentee (who raved about your place - well used to).

This place is not easy to find. It's next to a gas station and has some limited parking. I've come here several times and I love it. The place is not too big but we havent had issues getting a table. The last time I went was for dinner on Friday night. It was pretty busy but we got a table after waiting like 5 minutes. \\n\\nWe ordered the thai tea (my favorite!), Tom Ka soup, fried tofu, pad thai with tofu and pad see ew with shrimp. Everything was great! They are very vegetarian friendly and they were able to made the soup with tofu instead of chicken and same for the pad thai.\\n\\nThe Tom Ka soup is a must! They bring it in this container with like a flame in the middle. The portion is pretty big. Ours had mushrooms and tofu but the regular one has chicken. Soooo good! The fried tofu was good but there are other appetizers I like better like the spring rolls. \\n\\nThe Pad Thai and Pad See ew are both really good! The portions are pretty good and it's not expensive at all. The pad see ew is sweeter but both were great! \\n\\nWe tried ordering the mango sticky rice for dessert but they did not have it. I think they only have during mango season (in the spring/summer). \\n\\nOverall we paid $20 each (2 people) for so much food! Their lunch menu is even cheaper. I definitely recommend this place.

He was quick to greet us and provided drinks immediately. He recommended a dish not on the menu called Dirty Bird- 2 waffle sliders with chicken, medium egg, pepper gravy. We asked if it was big enough to share and he said yes... but we did get a side of grits. I was worried after We ordered the meal would be too heavy and a gut bomb but it was the opposite. The waffle was light and fluffy, the egg perfectly cooked with yolk yumminess, the chicken - wow, just wow - it was incredibly juicy and perfectly seasoned, the gravy was not heavy or thick it was smooth and delish! The gravy had the right amount of black pepper to taste everything all together. Demetrice also said I brought the syrup for a reason - oh my - just add a dot of syrup and you are in flavor town! The grits were creamy and no extra butter was necessary. Demetrice asked if we liked our meal and I told him I would lick the plate clean if it was not rude. This place is reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive. The portions are more than enough for two people. The environment was clean and a hoppin joint. Parking - well we parked a few blocks away but honestly this place is worth the walk! I look forward to our next food adventure here and hoping to see Demetrice again.

Once I got there, my doubt died down a bit because you saw a long queue. I don't mind a long wait because I've stood in longer queues before. You just learn to use that time for other things like catching up with your friends, talking about everything anything.\\n\\nMy friend and I decided to go all out. We ordered the Zuppa di Pesce with the fracomo sauce and the bottle of red wine. When the pasta platter arrived, you have a moment of awe. This beautiful giant platter full of seafood layered on top of linguine pasta and fracomo sauce. It was gorgeous.\\n\\nThen you take the first bite.\\n\\nOvercooked linguine. Yeah, the pasta was hammered. I still have nightmares about it. Like I wanted the best for my experience, especially after that long wait, but I feel like I'm reaching because how can an italian restaurant overcook their pasta like that. The pasta sauce is amazing, the seafood spread is spectacular... but the pasta was so done that we left it behind.\\n\\nThe staff and service was amazing Our waitress was welcoming and made the experience fantastic. Overall, the wait outside is because of how small the restaurant space is and how good the sauce is, not because of how good the pasta is. Remember that, or hopefully you'll see this review when you are in line so that way you can make a decision whether or not you want to stay in the queue."},{"name":"Universal Orlando Resort","address":"6000 Universal Studios Plz","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We have been here a variety of times over the years, and must admit that Universal Studios Orlando is our favorite theme park.

At first, we were quite impressed with the atmosphere and how quickly we were seated.  We had reservations for a party of 12 and a nice group of tables set up for us.  Things seemed to be going smoothly and then...we met our waitress.  I'm not going to beat around the bush here, I'm just going to come right out and say that our waitress was an absolute BITCH.   There, I said it.  You would think that she'd be cheery because a table of 12 means a big tip, but she was just miserable.  In addition to her horrible attitude, she screwed up our orders and did not put in a meal, so our friend had to wait 10 minutes after everyone else had gotten their food.  And at the end, when we were all sitting around after our $555 meal, she came over and said \\"is there anything else you need or do you want the check\\", and she said it such a rude manner that she should have just said \\"Please get out of here I am tired of you\\".  \\n\\nMoving along...aside from our bitchy waitress, all of the other staff were friendly and attentive.  The food was very good, but OVER-PRICED.  This restaurant has the audacity to charge an extra $2.00 for everything on the menu for the \\"outdoor patio\\" seating.  I'm not getting more food, why should I pay more money?  The Thai Mussels (appetizer) were delicious, my meal (grilled pork chop with excellent bbq sauce, mashed potatoes, and asparagus) was very good, but small and expensive.  My wife had a seafood risotto, which was good, but also a small and expensive portion.  \\n\\nOverall, I would have given this place 3 stars, but our rude waitress brought the rating down to 2.  It's a cool place to hang out, have some (over-priced) drinks, and socialize.

We were so pleased to find the reviews were well earned!\\n\\nFor those familiar with the block Promise Land sits on, you'll be as surprised as we were to walk into a dining room with chandeliers, warm red walls, comfy booths and elegant tables all decorated with gold cutlery and lovely plates and linen.  Despite how fancy this felt, at heart this is truly a family restaurant with very well-prepared Mediterranean comfort food.  But be aware, maybe not the right place to take younger children more used to pub atmospheres.\\n\\nWe all began with the Habibi, a luscious cocktail made with vodka, gin and pomegranate juice, to accompany our hummus, dolmas, pita bread, olive oil and za'atar appetizers.  I'm not a big fan of dolmas, as they sometimes seem a little slimy to me.  These were fantastic, rolled tightly with a nice acidic balance, and accompanied by carrots and tabouli.  The hummus was creamy and rich and the bread warm and fresh.\\n\\nFor dinner, one of us had the Vegetarian Fiesta (Azooma) which was huge, and lovely and well prepared.  One had the Lamb Tenderloin and couldn't stop talking about how tender and tasty the lamb was.  One had the seafood pasta, ordered on a whim because he's not a seafood lover, but liked it enough to bring the leftovers home.  I had the Chicken Fresh Herbs - this was not my mother's chicken; it was tangy and rich, accompanied by mushrooms, broccoli, carrots and rice.  It was also huge, and I brought about half home to eat today for lunch.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Baklava and Toasted Pound Cake, and the owners gifted us a chocolate dessert with a birthday candle on top.  All were yummy, but we agreed the Toasted Pound Cake was the clear winner.\\n\\nWe were greeted, feted and tended by Laila, and Chef Nazeeh came out to meet us and talk with us a couple of times.  \\n\\nOverall:  Lots of fresh veggies on each of our plates, regardless of what we ordered.  Portion sizes were universally huge - it would be possible to share an entree and appetizer and still feel very satisfied (but don't forgo the Toasted Pound Cake).  Warm, friendly, engaged service.  Beautiful space.  Everything exceeded expectations for us.\\n\\nThis restaurant was not busy enough on a Saturday night - perhaps because of the cold, but more likely because word of mouth hasn't spread much yet, and the location and type of restaurant may be confusing for some.

The fish was cooked perfectly and was quite a sight to behold on the plate. The fish was served with a salsa verde of sorts and a mustard aioli which went well, but wasn't my favorite sauce.

The idea of combining a bookstore and cafe is genius and, if you go at a less popular time, eating here can be a comforting experience. As for the food and coffee, it is good. I have eaten here about 6 times and am not close to making it through the monstrous menu. My review of the food is only based upon the breakfast food and vegan tacos. With a menu as large as Trident's I am certain there are some dishes that are sub par, but in my opinion breakfast food is the best food so it doesn't really matter. The service is fine. The people who work here are generally nice, accommodating, and always smiling which makes up for the forgetfulness.

The Chinese restaurant in town that has a modern, attractive building, updated interior and looks like it would be a high-quality establishment (Golden Chopsticks) is actually just a notch above your average mall food-court Chinese fast-food joint.  Golden China, on the other hand, looks like a complete dive.  Based solely on appearance, you would expect greasy mass-produced mall food from Golden China, but in reality, it's the best I've had in Hilliard so far.  (note: will update if I find something better)\\n\\nThey didn't drown the food in a sea of oil.  The rice was perfectly cooked.  The broccoli was al-dente and not the over-cooked mush you get most other places.  The egg rolls were fried to crispy perfection and not soggy. The won-ton soup tasted like chicken broth and not salt water.  The shrimps were huge!  It was a very pleasant meal.  Please note that the portion sizes seem small in their take-out containers.  They don't use the traditional white buckets but instead use covered plastic trays.  However, don't let the presentation fool you-- there's two days worth of dinner in one tray.\\n\\nThough the food is fantastic, I would not dine-in.  The interior is kinda depressing. Florescent lights illuminate a sterile white-and-green themed interior with lanolium floors.  They also have the usual rear-lit panoramas of a river valley and the Great Wall where the middle of the picture sags backwards because it's become unglued over time.   Take all that, add flimsy tables and chairs and the female owner screaming at her chefs in Mandarin and you'll want to order take-out.  They hired two gringo's to run the counter, but they kept talking about their go-carts and lawn mowers.  Dirty and rough, they looked like they had just finished repairing a small engine. \\n\\nSo in a nutshell:.   This place serves awesome food cooked by real Asians in a family run establishment. This is the best Chinese restaurant for takeout in Hilliard I've reviewed so far.  I will update this review if I find better.  They even have a \\"diet\\" menu where the meals are steamed instead of stir-fried.

The line was literally almost coming out the door and might I remind you that this place can seat a good 50-80 people. As soon as I walked in I saw everyone holding their own beers and wine as they do not serve alcohol here so I actually left the line with my buddy and went to the gas station around the block and grabbed a 6pack of that Perroni Italian Beer to match with this authentic Italian pizza. \\n\\nSo let me start by saying the line moves fairly quickly because of the fact that they use some legit ovens imported from Italy that cook these thin pies in about a min or so. I ordered the San Gennaro based on alot of reviews and it did not disappoint. While waiting for my pizza and fighting to look for a table to sit at I saw they had a little condiment section which is self serve. They had fresh garlic / olive oil / spicy chili garlic sauce / and of course parmesan cheese. They somehow find you in the midst of a 100 people and scream out your order number as its pretty loud in there.  I believe Georgia Tech is right near by so there was alot of young people there and it was very lively. \\n\\nHonestly this is the type of joint you can go to on the weekends as a casual hang out or even on a date. The people that were sitting in front of me, a party of 6 were from New York and we were talking about all the great pies we've had as I travel to alot of different states and look for the best pizzeria every place I visit.  They couldnt stop telling me how good the pizza is and how it was even better than the stuff in New York.  This place is by far the best authentic italian pizza ive ever had and we didnt leave a single slice on this huge pie.

There's a minimum to use your card which isn't posted anywhere but that's what I was told and then I was basically forced to buy additional items to use my card. The lady behind the counter wasn't particularly friendly either. She had the \\"I'm just here to do my job personality\\". I added on a chocolate dipped pizzelle to my order to make the minimum. The pizzelle was a bit pricey considering its just two pizzelle with a little chocolate. Around my way an entire bag of pizzelle's are $3-4 so two dollars for just one is pretty insane. I also got a vanilla cannoli and a lobster tail. \\n\\nThe lobster tail was amazing. It was filled with soooooo much delicious cream. It was short and stout rather than the really long kinds I see at other bakeries. That definitely saves space on the baking tray and allows for a bigger bite of creamy goodness that oozes out the sides. The outside crunch seemed be be wrapped around the inner dough in a layer because as I bit into it the outer crunch started to separate. Not really an issue but can get a little messy. This lobster tail is definitely in my top five of best lobster tails ever. We walked back to our friends apartment and the cannoli did not really hold up as well as the lobster tail did in terms of melted filling but was also still quite delicious. \\n\\nThey have a small selection of beverages as well including sanpellegrino, yum.

You park in a huge dirt parking lot right off the side of the road in Driftwood, TX.  When we pulled up, I was shocked by the number of cars in the lot.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is made up of two buildings and an outside area.  The outside area has popcorn, drinks and live music most of the time.  It has plenty of shade so it isn't too sweltering for those who have to wait to be seated. Everything about the setting feels authentic.  I came with two friends on a Sunday night and we were seated immediately in the building with the BBQ smoker.  The pit is a spectacle for sure and you should check it out even if you are sitting in the other building.  \\n\\nFor our meal, we were focused on the meats.  I ordered the half ribs, half brisket plate which comes with potato salad, beans and slaw.  They bring bread, pickles and onions for the table.  I will say the sides are nothing to write home about (between the three of us, we didn't finish one order of sides).  The greatness of the meat makes up for the lackluster nature of the sides.  As someone who doesn't eat a ton of red meat, I was pretty blown away.  The brisket is served in long, large strips and the pork ribs have plenty of meat on them.  \\n\\nIf you come with a larger group, I would recommend the Family Style meal so you can sample everything Salt Lick has to offer. It is about $20 and comes with brisket, sausage, and ribs in addition to the sides.  Or you might just want to order the meats...the sides just really aren't worth it. They also have a little gift shop where you can purchase commemorative T-shirts as well as Salt Lick sauces.

I have been about 3 or 4 times and have reservations coming up in a few months. Yes, you read that correctly-a few months, because it is only open Thursday-Sunday and seats about 18 to 20 people. It is located in the back of another restaurant with a secret door to enter. I made my reservations in October or November and will not be going until April getting treated by my brother and sister in law for a birthday gift :) I'm really looking forward to dinner.\\n\\nLangbaan offers a prix fixe menu with about 10 courses I believe and you have the option of wine pairings. My favorite is the Rice cup filled with some cucumber concoction of which is very pleasing to the palate. There is one chef and 2 sous chefs that prepare the food right in the room where you are and fills the place with so many different aromas of authentic food of Thailand. Take that one person you know for sure is down to try new food and will not waste your money and a great experience.

Regrettably, this cannot be one of them. \\n\\nAn NYC author and I dined there this weekend, and we were genuinely shocked when I was treated to a sneering response to being a teetotaller (truly, a dangerous response that implied it was a problem that I was not drinking---always the sign of an amateur, backward restaurant) and we were later given a lecture on green tea by the waitress who made her impatience that we depart relentlessly clear. Finally, the manager came by and paced our table (we had ordered a full meal---h'ors d'oeuvres, entrees, tea, etc.) after our only having been there for 90 minutes and after having a decent conversation despite the intrusions and snobbery, and all but asked us to leave. We gladly departed, and we will not return."},{"name":"Origo Club","address":"110-6888 River Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"The number of places that you can enjoy Afternoon Tea has certainly ramped up in Vancouver over the last couple of years. One of the newer and splashier places is Origo Club in Richmond. What sets Origo apart from other places that serve Afternoon Tea is their attached gallery that displays various contemporary Asian art pieces. I know it sounds a bit disconnected from the French-inspired fare that Origo strives for, especially when you consider Afternoon Tea being so closely associated with old world English culture.\\n\\nOrigo Club is located near the Richmond Oval and, as you can imagine, street parking is a bit difficult to come by. They do, however, have an parkade but it fills up quick. Tip: there is an unassuming door that leads you from the parkade into the back of the restaurant so you don't have to walk outside to the main entrance.\\n\\nWe came, of course, for the Afternoon Tea ($45) which is stunningly served in a rounded display case which plays off of their attached art gallery. It truly looks like this could be artwork that is on display. Even the teapots and teacups that they use here are elegantly designed. It is a bit of a departure from some other Afternoon Tea places where the teacups don't always match the saucers.\\n\\nNow, about the tea here itself (we ordered the Imperial Green Tea and the Early Grey)... which you would think would be one of the main parts of \\"Afternoon Tea\\", there really isn't a large selection of teas to choose from. However, they do have other drinks such as coffees and lattes. I do appreciate the ability to have other drinks other than tea but don't come here expecting to be overwhelmed by the tea itself... that seems to take second stage to the sweet and savory items.\\n\\nOverall impressions of the Afternoon Tea... the teas here really weren't very flavourful. However, the aesthetics of the presentation of the food as well as the environment were enjoyable.\\n\\nAfter our Afternoon Tea, we stepped into the adjoining art gallery. This isn't a huge gallery but it does have some very nice pieces. If you turn around, you'll see a grand display case which surrounds the entrance into the cafe.\\n\\nMany of the pieces here included ceramic porcelain and pottery which related to tea.\\n\\nWhile this isn't a huge art gallery and some of the pieces located in the top of the large display case are difficult to see, it was a nice change and I enjoyed it."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Small portions (tapas) but very filling.

The hotel staff recommended ABC and after checking the menu and the ratings, we went. We arrived, checked in with the hostess and received a text that we were on the wait list and could in fact check the number of guests ahead of us. An hour and 15 mins wait time. If it's as good as everyone says, no problem. After noticing the procedure for how everyone checked in, it was noticeable that several parties were being seated before us. They were not asked their name and if they had received their text like some were. Obviously they had just walked up and were seated. I wasn't the only one to notice either. Two other parties noticed the same and left. The hostess would look to see who was looking and proceed to lead them to their seat. Even after we got our text, an hour and 35 minutes later, we approached the hostess stand where we were ushered to the side to stand to wait again for 10 minutes. Two parties arrived, did not announce their having received a text or state their name but were taken straight to a table ahead of us yet again. When we finally are seated, the waiter was rude at best. I asked if they served sweet tea and he replied, \\"Well, yeah!\\" Like he couldn't believe I had asked. It wasn't on the menu so I asked. He brought the drinks, came back 15 mins later to ask what we were having. I was looking in my purse and he turned as I looked up and said to my daughter, \\"Well maybe you are ready!\\" She ordered, he turned to me, \\"Made up YOUR mind yet?\\" I ordered and he left. Twenty minutes later, daughter's chicken and waffles, peach cobbler French toast and my salmon croquettes came by another waiter. I asked where were the eggs I ordered and he shrugged his shoulders. Ten minutes later our original waiter came with the eggs. The food was good, not great, but good. I actually may have enjoyed it more had we not been treated so shitty. The only complaint I have with the food is that the lettuce was terribly wilted and the fact that I got the eggs 10 minutes after the rest of our food arrived. The waiter never came back to inquire if we were doing okay, to refill drinks, see if we needed anything-but when he did come back he brought the check. I don't mind paying for good food and good service, but you would think that $55 for breakfast/brunch you would be treated as well as other patrons in the restaurant. I would have loved to have given this establishment 4 or 5 stars but until they learn to treat EVERYONE the same regardless of their skin color, I can't. It was THAT obvious.

The line is long and the seating is tight, you might find yourself nearly shoulder to shoulder with other guests. \\n\\nMy friend and I ordered and shared two entrees. \\n\\nFirst was the fettuccini with swordfish and tuna in pesto sauce. This is essentially salmon and swordfish chunks that have been seared and cooked with pasta and a pesto cream sauce. The fettuccini is not handmade, but cooked satisfactorily. \\n\\nThe fish meat itself was also satisfactory. Provides a protein aspect to the dish. The tuna was a little more tough and chewy than the swordfish bits. Neither was particularly flavorful, but offers a mild fish taste. \\n\\nThe pesto cream sauce is what brings everything together. Very creamy, with chopped herbs for some mild nuance. Unfortunately, the pesto is somewhat one dimensional and can get a little monotonous due to its rich nature. I would have appreciated another layer of nuance or complexity here. \\n\\nFrutti Di Mare was the other entr√©e we ordered. This is spaghetti cooked with shrimps, mussels and scallops in a  red sauce. We chose the Fracomo sauce, which is a combination of the staple lobster based red sauce and a red sauce with some b√©chamel. \\n\\nAnd yes, the star of the show is indeed the sauce. Creamy consistency, mild spice, lobster complexity,  light tomato tang with some seeds, and sticks to the pasta and meat. \\n\\nEach ingredient retains its uniqueness. The mussels are good, no dirt or complaints there. Scallop is meaty and tender. Calamari is tasteless. Shrimp has a slight bitterness and was rubbery. Perhaps not the freshest shrimps were used, or best techniques applied here.  \\n\\nWhile Giacomo's red sauce is indeed addicting, what the sauce smothers is only satisfactory. Pasta is not handmade and lacks the lovely silky, dense texture of a superior handmade pasta.

Not to say we don't eat at nice places, but we have never been to a steak house. If it's the same rule for dollar signs as it is for karats (A karat for every year), we should have eaten at a 7 dollar sign location... but i was beyond ecstatic to be going to Ruth Chris'.\\n\\nWhen it comes to bread, I am high maintenance. I will be the first to admit it is hard to please me.... bread has to be the wow factor... since that is often the first part of every great (Hopefully) meal. The bread here was a 10/10, one of the richest, thickest, moist breads, and ciabattas to be specific. What Gster and I agreed made the difference was the whipped butter... it had such a strong, soothing flavor, the butter sealed the deal. It was so enticing to Gster that he failed the bread draft by dipping the bread into the butter rather than using a knife. Come on, we are at fine dining! I can't take him anywhere...\\n\\nThe best part about Gster taking me to a steak house is that I don't eat steak. Foruntatley, they had a swordfish special, and foruntatley it was unfreakin-belivable. It was so fresh, perfectly cooked in a basil tomato and lemony saute with breadcrumbs. One of, if not the best swordfish I have ever gotten. Gster got the petit filet, which at first he was hesitant about but his stomach thanked me after. The steak came out sizzling, so thats an automatic win. For sides, we got the grilled asparagus, which was fresh and full of flavor. However, the best part about dinner, and one of the only reasons you should go, is the sweet potatoe casserole. Yes. It was covered with sugary, pecan crumbles that melted in your mouth before they even got in your mouth. Sweet potatoes have a whole new meaning and will never be the same. NEVER. \\n\\nFor dessert we got the chocolate duo. Which surprise surprise... was frankly one of the best chocolate mousse and chocolate lava cakes i have ever had. And if you know me, I am equally as hard on judging the dessert as I am the bread... especially my mousse. Yes, this is worth it. Yes, you shouldn't think twice. Yes, it will be the second best decision you make your life( after the sweet potato).\\n\\nSo after every one of my dishes being a 4/5 do I give it a 5/5? Well, I do know that there are signs saying they are under construction, but that doesn't excuse them of being completely careless. They always say you can judge your food by the bathroom, right? Well the bathroom was ... disturbing. I went twice over the evening, and neither time had it been cleaned since the last. Also, there were several spots in the dining room where the paneling and molding was missing, leaving a massive unpainted and obscure hole, that was directly behind my head. Lastly, our service was very slow and inattentive. Given we are paying the hefty price for our meal, I expect the best service I have ever had in my life. I have had far better service at places where my expectations were much lower. Was the food here unreal? For sure. Was it the best i have ever had? One of the best. Was the overall experience worth the price? Not quite. However, one of the pushing factors torwards my rating to be a 4.5 is the uniquneness that this is in the Old City Hall building. Walking up, you don't even know its a Ruth Chris.. it's very mysterious, enchanting, and you feel that you are gonna see some crazy mafia or old city politics go down.

No, its not the best pizze I've ever had. That honor still belongs to some hole in the wall restaurant in Finland. I suspect there is far better in Italy and other places, but in Georgia it just doesn't get better than this.\\n\\nI had a pizza margherita and added pepperoni. People will tell you that a perfect pizza is made of great ingredients but they leave off a very important fact. The ingredients have to go together too. Thats what this place does the best. Every flavor plays off another and melds together perfectly. Im sure this crust by itself would be mediocre but this crust goes excellently with this sauce and this cheese. That is what places this pizza well beyond any other in Georgia. \\n\\nPizza this good should garner five stars and nothing about the food held back my rating. It was the ambiance that pulled back that one star. When I get food this good I want to sit back and enjoy it. I want to savor it and take my time a bit. I would of done that here if it weren't for the crowd lined up against the wall waiting on me to finish so they could have my table. The staff never made me feel rushed at all but its a bit difficult not to feel rushed when people are lined up like that. I'm a firm believer that communal tables in restaurants are a mistake and there is pretty much no other option if you plan to eat inside Antico other than the communal table. The blaring Italian music could be turned down a bit, and they could have a far better ordering system than yelling out order numbers in a loud restaurant. \\n\\nThe one thing about the ambiance that they get right is the ability to see the pizza ovens and to watch the pizza get made. Its clear that care goes into every pie and thats what this place is about -- excellent pizza. If you live in Georgia you absolutely have to try this place at least once.

The waffle was equally unique and impressive, relatively airy for being very clearly filled with cornmeal, which is often pretty dense stuff.  The cranberry sauce on top, accompanied by dried cranberries, gave it just the right amount of moistness without drowning the waffle - I was the first one at my table to join the clean plate club.  My lovely brunch companions got the chicken-fried steak and the brunch burger (as well as one more order of waffles with a side of plain grits).  We all raved about our meals, though my friend's only even minor complaint was that the grits were a little too much on the fluffy side to be authentic.  I tried 'em and didn't have any complaints - I thought they were straight-up delicious, but I'm no grits connoisseur.\\n\\nI would've maybe wished my tiny glass of orange juice were bigger for $3 considering that my pal's $9 bloody mary was a completely full pint-glass, but I think upping the charge on juice is pretty standard at brunches across the board - I know real fruit ain't cheap to come by.\\n\\nThis place still seems to be low enough on the radar that it's neighborhood-y and not yet mobbed, but rest assured once the secret gets out, there will be a line to this restaurant.

We were on I-Drive looking for a good place to eat. I turned to my trusty Yelp app and this place came up with high reviews by Yelpers I trust.  So it was a no brainer to give this place a shot.\\n\\nIt's in the middle of Tourist Hell but once you get past that, it's certainly worth the visit!  My husband and I had an exceptional experience. There was a little bit of a wait for a table as the restaurant seemed to be packed with tourists AND locals! Very good sign.   Once we were seated, we both started with some of the fresh made juices- my husband had the passionfruit while I had pineapple. Sooo good and refreshing considering it was brutally hot that day. My pineapple juice was so icy and chilled. It was hard not to gulp it down before the appetizer came!  My husband's juice was just as tasty. No disappointment from either of us. \\n\\nThe rest of our meal was delicious and it was hard to not want to keep eating more. We decided to start with a few appetizers so we ordered a plate of tostones with guacamole along with a chicken empanada (for me) and a beef empanada (for my husband). The coupling of tostones and guacamole was almost life changing. How the heck have I never had this before??!! We really couldn't stop....and it could've easily been a meal for one but what's the fun in that?    Our empanadas were small(can fit in the palm of your hand) but stuffed to the max and very flavorful. I highly recommend using the complimentary sauces to dip them in. There's a white garlic sauce as well as a spicier, green garlic sauce. \\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough food, I ordered the grilled chicken breast with onions entr√©e. It comes with a side of rice, a cup of red bean soup and your choice of plantains , yuca or tostones.  The chicken breast was pounded flat and thin and had sooo much flavor. It was perfectly seasoned and went really well with the saut√©ed onions. The rice and red beans were also a huge hit. My husband had a similar entr√©e except he opted for the grilled steak. If you want the closest thing to a home cooked meal, I would recommend this place and especially this entr√©e. According to the server, he said everything is housemade which makes so much sense. Nothing tasted premade and reheated.      The roasted chicken seemed to also be a popular dish here as several people around us were ordering.   My only plan for next time is to try to save some room for dessert!   \\n\\nThis will definitely be a \\"must eat\\" place when we're in the area.

We ordered 3 appys to share and noticed that the portions were very skimpy, especially on the beet salad (literally 3 pieces of beet and one piece of roasted pear about the size of my thumb).  For dinner I ordered the tenderloin and there were 2 (count 'em) less than half-inch slices in a huge bowl with some wilty bitter green things, a couple of roasted onions and 2 rather bland raviolis.  Two at our table ordered the chicken roulade which was coated in the thickest, heaviest breading known to mankind.

This course tasted pretty delicious. So does the oyster dish, fresh and juicy.\\n\\nAs for our second courses, they were both too salty and my guess was right. They were cooked by the same person. The saltiness covered the original fresh taste of the half cooked egg and the dough taste of pasta. Apart from the saltiness, the dishes themselves tasted pretty flavorful. Especially the squid ink pasta, it was very juicy and chewy.\\n\\nThen the main course wagyu beef, I honestly did not know what was going on. The beef itself was way too salty as well. It was wagyu beef. I felt it was a waste. Other than the \\"salt\\", the scallions provided a sweet taste and the delicate mashed potato worked well with the beef.

The pancakes were good! Very light and airy. We had ordered the classic and the matcha one. Classic was with maple syrup and butter. You get 3 pieces of pancake. Whereas the matcha only got 2 pieces. The matcha one was a bit weird as I thought  the mocha was matcha mochi but just regular mochi. The matcha sauce and plating was very nice. The chocolate ice cream was a bit weird to go with the match pancake. They make the pancakes when you order, so it's about 20 minute wait for it. Also ordered coffee and it wasn't that good. I would say go to blenz for coffee. Price point for the pancake was $12-16. I think it's over price for what it is. Nice to try at least once.

You know that's important in the South! The chix and churros were like a spin on chicken and waffles. Everyone at the tables raved about the chicken. I think everyone agreed that of the tapas, the torrijas was the best. It was like a fat piece of bread cooked as French toast and then rolled in cinnamon and sugar. It had a nice crust with a chewy inside. We also ordered the paella mariscos, or seafood paella. That was my personal fave. It had the right amount of seafood, great flavor, and I especially liked the rice crust on the bottom of the pan. So darn good!

It really is the most incredibly amazing and delicious barbecue I've ever had in my life. \\n\\nFirst of all, get a plate of some sort. Try everything you can. I had Thurman's Plate and honestly, I couldn't pick a favorite even if I tried. Each item from the sausage to the brisket was cooked so well and had such wonderful and distinct flavors, you can't really choose. I mean, can you really compare ribs and sausage? \\n\\nThe sides, oh my. The coleslaw was fresh, the potato salad/beans had the perfect consistently and flavor, and then there were the heroes of the meal -- the sauces. All the sauces, all the time.

The only negative thing I have to say is that for lunch, there is no valet and no street parking whatsoever to be found during the day. So we were forced to park in the $27 garage nearby (not even that nearby). That made us kind of grumpy.\\n\\nHowever as soon as we got there we were cheered up. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, clean, and elegant while not seeming stuffy. The service is friendly, quick, and there seem to be more staff than customers. The bread was warm... always a plus.\\n\\nI have to start by saying that I am not really a steak fan. If I'm at a buffet with lots of choices, I go for chicken and fish and ignore the steak tips, no matter what people say about them. We went to Ruth's Chris since my husband is such a huge steak fan and he wanted me to taste a \\"real\\" steak. I've been to Morton's and Capital Grill before, but I had never tasted anything rarer than a medium well steak. \\n\\nAppetizers: I had a good basic salad while my husband had a miniscule, yet tasty bowl of jambalaya that featured tiny shrimp. I thought it was so cool when our waiter warned us that the salad was a \\"significantly larger portion\\" than the soup. We still wanted to try both though. \\n\\nEntrees: My husband, the steak freak, ordered the strip steak rare, while I, the steak newbie, ordered the filet medium. We ended up switching because I guess I love strip steak. thinking back, we really should have switched what we ordered to strip steak medium, filet rare. You live and learn. The steaks came sizzling on super hot plates they constantly warned us about (yet we both managed to burn ourselves on them) and drowned in melted butter. They were so amazingly delicious. The hot plates kept cooking the meat which I thought was so neat... I was able to \\"cook\\" slices of my husband's rare steak to medium rare. Mashed potatoes were creamy and yummy. The creamed spinach had great consistency but tasted very much of spinach, so those of you who eat creamed spinach because it tastes nothing like spinach beware.\\n\\nDessert: The only dessert choice was a chocolate mousse cake, and looked completely not impressive at all. But it turned out to be light, sweet, and the perfect ending to a meal that completely stuffed us to the gills. I had a cup of coffee and it was the nail in the coffin... I am officially a Ruth's Chris fan.\\n\\nWe walked out saying over and over, \\"that was definitely dinner, not lunch\\". I can't imagine what it would be like to eat dinner there.

Flash forward to 2019 and I'm finally in Portland where I can try it once and for all. I will say that I am unimpressed and feel that every Thai restaurant in LA Thai town has been robbed of hundreds of Michelin stars. The food here is good but the flavors are nowhere as balanced. The papaya salad was overly sweet and did not have enough fish sauce/shrimp flavor and lacked a bit of acid. The fish sauce wings are way overhyped and the spicy version is very mild at best.

You're at the top of your industry, a 2011 James Beard \\"Best Chef\\" winner, and one of the finest chefs that Boston has ever produced. Yet you're mostly known for (and will probably be remembered for) a goddamn hamburger that is not even officially on any of your menus. And you're seemingly not bothered by that at all.\\n\\nMaws has had ample time, personality, cachet, and industry-wide respect to write a cookbook or develop a Food TV persona, and yet every time I'm in his restaurant, he's in the thick of things directing traffic, he's finishing plates, he's whisking a velout√©, he's asking patrons what they thought of their dinner, he's running food to my table. I started coming to Craigie shortly after it moved from Harvard Square to Main Street in 2008. Craigie was one of the first open-kitchen restaurants I had been to in Boston, and it has always been a treat to see its indefatigable chef in action.\\n\\nMy most recent visit began with an amuse bouche consisting of a crispy cracker and a piece of speck smeared with pork aioli, a subversive hors d'oeuvre in an era where too often this mini-course is centered around a small piece of fruit or cube of tofu rather than a fantastic bite of smoky, salty cured meat as it is here. Following the amuse bouche, out comes the bread -- and you will DEFINITELY want to have the bread because here they make it this heavy, funky, misshapen and chewy but splendid-tasting roll with a yeasty nose and crispy pointed edges, and I can never get enough of it.\\n\\nWhat else can't I get enough of? The whole-bellied \\"Crispy Fried Essex Clams,\\" and especially the pit-black squid ink ancho√Øade that is essentially standing in as a \\"next level\\" tartar sauce, its brininess and robust flavor derived from the garlic-anchovy paste therein balanced by a tremendous amount of tart from a pur√©e of preserved lemon and pickled pepper. The clams themselves have fat round bellies filled with ocean and half-digested gunk and are fried until the exterior has a golden crunch such that a small geyser of hot liquid will erupt in your mouth upon the fried batter being penetrated by your teeth.\\n\\nMy entr√©e, the \\"Grass-Fed Sirloin √† la Po√™le,\\" was a tender 6-ounce pan-saut√©ed sirloin with buttery browned sweetbreads, fiddlehead ferns, and charred onion in a wine sauce - the kind of unpretty brown dish that doesn't look like much, but wallops you in the face with powerful flavors and luscious textures. Similar to this is my favorite Craigie entr√©e of all time: Maws' \\"Vermont Pork 3 Ways,\\" which consists of slow-roasted shoulder, sous-vide'd pork belly, and spice-crusted rib. There are lots of upscale places in Boston for dainty tweezer food decorated with the freshest microgreens available - and Craigie on Main ain't one of them! This is truly a restaurant for unrepentant carnivores.\\n\\nAnd about that burger? It is unquestionably as good as you've heard. Yes, you need to get there early because they only serve 18 of them per night (as they are made from a specific cow from a farm in Hardwick, Massachusetts that can only slaughter a few cows per week), and it is only served at the bar. Before \\"umami burgers\\" were fashionable, Craigie was spiking their burgers with dehydrated miso and using anchovy ketchup. The juicy combination of three blends of grass-fed beef, suet, and bone marrow ensures the meat under the browned outer crust of the patty is soft and its flavor bold. Every supporting detail is both deliberate and delicious, including the melted slice of aged cheddar from Shelburne Farms and house-made sesame-seeded milk bun made with rye flour.\\n\\nService is as professional as what you'd expect from a fine dining restaurant in Boston, perhaps a bit less fawning and looser here across the river in Cambridge. The venue hasn't changed since it opened and still seems modern; Despite aging a bit since my time in Boston, my recent visit demonstrated that Craigie has done so gracefully -- and is still one of the best dining options in the region.\\n\\nFood/D√©cor/Service: 4.6/3.9/4.6\\n\\nWhat to Order: Craigie Burger, Crispy Fried Pig Tails, Vermont Pork 3 Ways, Fried Essex Clams, Roasted Beef Bone Marrow"},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Really great authentic Peruvian food and at a great price.

There were only two shrimp, but they were big, and perfectly cooked with some bacon and seasoning.  The enchilada was pretty good, filled with pork and topped with sauce.  There was also a side salad (very good except for plasticky tomatoes,) and papa rellena which I remember from the other location: mashed fried potatoes, with a crisp crust and cheesy inside.

The pasta is made so fresh as well as the sauce. Each bite is so perfectly made. \\n\\nHowever, food is not the only important thing on the menu. I get that they have to have people in and out in a timely manner so they can serve the big line- but I believe they need to provide better customer service. Every time my family comes here (because i insist that we do ) they have given us a hard time whether it be because we need another plate or because they are enforcing us to order one dish per a person. The problem is, there are times when I come with little kids & we simply cannot finish the food. When the ladies do not get what they want, they begin to throw a fit & they make the  environment quite awkward and hostile. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food is amazing - like I said, the best I have had; but, you still need to provide great customer service.

I came 10 minutes before opening, jumped in line with about 15 other people waiting and was able to snag a table.\\n\\nFor 2 people, we ordered the five spice beef sandwich, sweet soybean milk (you must get the fried dough with it!), chive pie, short ribs, and pig ear salad. Everything was decent, however my personal favorite was the fried dough and the five spice beef sandwich. The chive pie was okay and sounds exactly as is. That's something I probably won't get again. \\n\\nPrices here are kind of high, but the portions are fairly large. We paid 40 before tip for 2 people. I will definitely be back to try out the other dishes!"},{"name":"Revelry","address":"210 SE Mlk Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Generous portions (especially for the appetizers), great customer service, just yes.

I'm not even a big sausage fan and after trying this I regretted not getting it myself. It was sweet and almost caramelized but also spicy. This plate comes with beans, potato salad, and coleslaw.

Then someone just walked up and cut in front of us! And the cashier didn't say shit, even though he glanced over at us when this happened and knew we had been standing there waiting. Finally after serving that guy he acknowledged us and we paid. I wanted to leave a tip and we told the cashier how much we wanted back, but he still gave us all of our change back. I was like ooook, guess I'll put the tip in the tip jar. Nope of course that was wrong too. The cashier actually glared at me and said \\"was that for your waiter?\\" and I said \\"yes\\".

Any Chinese restaurant has dinner combos from $6.95 to $8.95 that include fried rice and an egg roll.  They don't have them but you can make any of the orders a combo by adding $3.99.  So my small beef and broccoli for $6.49 was $10.48 as a combo which would make that the most expensive beef and broccoli combo anywhere.  A quart of fried rice on its own is a hefty $8.49. Again, all would be well if the food didn't stink.  The rice is flavorless with limited pork and the trademark Central Florida peas and carrots. The beef in the beef with broccoli.  Was off.  I think it was over marinated to try and make it tender which affected the texture and the taste.  The General Tso's chicken was all breading.  I cannot tell if it was dark meat chicken because I literally couldn't find any chicken.  I wouldn't eat here again under any circumstances."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My first stop in every city is the number one pizza spot on trip advisor. Antico Pizza did not quite live up to the hype. Front of house is manned by younger staff. Cordial but no friendly. Back of the restaurant has an open kitchen which is cool. I approached the pizza maker to take some pics, not a smile or acknowledgment. Had to go to my car for my charger, when I got back I was greeted with \\"what number are you?\\" I guess my pizza was ready. It's quaintly served and a 24x36 cooking tray. Table service is non existent. Not a single person came up to asks if I needed anything. I watch an older lady with a crutch pick up a carry out pizza... do you think the staff helped her with the door? Nope. By the time I noticed she was half way out the door and the way the restaurant is set up I would not have made it there in time. Idk. I guess it's next to a college so they keep the service to a minimum. Now onto the pizza... finally. Flavors were there. Basil, garlic, tomato... more garlic. I like garlic but it was definitely the stand flavor on the margherita. The bread was a little chewy at the ends. I normally like crust but this was like a bread stick at the end... which would've gone great if there was a spicy olive oil somewhere in view. But there wasn't and after 20 min... no one has asked me if I need anything else. On the tables are clear plastic quart containers filled with plastic silver wear and a stack of plastic 9oz cocktail cups with the plastic still wrapped around the bottom half of the stack. No one else seems to mind. I just think if you're going to make a good product and display Giovanni DiaPalma certificates... at least train your staff to put in a little more effort.  Meh.

Within the past two months they have started charging for an extra scoop despite this never being added to their extras on the menu. I told them the first time I paid extra that it should be added to the menu so customers would know that it's extra.

Alas... the mediocrity of 111 East (its short-lived predecessor) pervades LoLa Burger as well. \\n\\nOverall, the place looks good. Modern and interesting with an open kitchen. They turned a whole wall into a chalkboard and have the menu up there in a neat way. We were seated quickly and our waiter was nice, if a bit clueless and soft-spoken. \\n\\nWe tried the \\"jumbo\\" buffalo chicken wings, short rib grilled cheese, double-stack burger, LoLa spicy fries, and regular fries. \\n\\n- Chicken wings: Insanely tiny but delicious. I wouldn't have been so taken aback if they didn't say \\"jumbo\\" on the menu. These could have starred in \\"Honey I Shrunk the Chicken Wings.\\"\\n\\n- Short rib grilled cheese: The short rib inside was amazing, overall a really tasty sandwich. \\n\\n- Fries: They're shoestring fries, McDonald's style, and pretty good. The LoLa spicy fries just come with a spicy aioli on top/on the side. \\n\\n- Burger: This is their namesake. We were looking forward to that burger when it came out. And let me tell you, it was a bit underwhelming. We ordered it with all the standard toppings (and we saw the waiter write it down), but two completely bare (slightly charred) patties on a bun came out. When we noticed, we flagged someone nearby (possibly the service manager, not sure) to mention that we ordered it with toppings and cheese. The guy apologized and brought a side of the toppings and two slices of cheese. On the surface, that seems fine. ... But... there's a lot of things my dining companion could say about this, the least of which is that building the burger yourself and then eating a burger with a piece of cold cheese on it is suboptimal. The bun-to-burger ratio was also a bit off with the double stack, as the bottom bun soaked through before he had the chance to bite in. The burger patties themselves were good, as long as you're okay with them being pretty dark on the outside.\\n\\nThey have beer and wine, so I also had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, which was good but served in a tiny-looking stemless wine glass. \\n\\nOverall, we were underwhelmed. It would have been great to have another go-to neighborhood place.

The two best dishes we got were the vegan sausage (not on the tasting menu) and a pasta dish with lentils that was on the tasting menu. The mole dish was only so-so (I've had much better for far less at a number of local Mexican places) and the dessert was downright weird (that cinnamon ice cream is really overpowering). The drinks were only okay for the high cocktail price. While the people there were lovely and the place itself it beautiful and intimate, there are so many better places to go in Cambridge/Boston/Somerville if you're looking and willing to pay for a good meal.

Yes, it was as hot as Satan's titty in there, especially because the a/c was on the fritz.  As such, the owner gave our group FREE BEER!  Yes, three or four buckets of FREE BEER!

No chance of free beer that day, but I am happy to say they have Coke Zero on tap.  I got two breakfast tacos with eggs and cheese.  Simple?  Yes.  Delicious?  Definitely.  Folks, Screaming Goat has the best breakfast tacos in Austin.  Okay, true, I haven't tried every single breakfast taco in Austin, but I'm still prepared to say that Screaming Goat has the best.  The employees are all really cool, despite the fact that they're hipsters.\\n\\nAnd the price is right, too.

There are three tables in the restaurant (a 2-seater, a 6-seater and an 8-seater). \\nLuckily, we didn't have to wait at all, but I hear that's rare. I had a cajun tea, a fried shrimp po'boy with a side of smothered potatos and mac and cheese. The cajun tea is a cross between tea and peach lemonade, which I liked a lot. The best thing I ate was the smothered potatoes. I would not order the mac and cheese again as it was quite dry. The shrimp on the po'boy was huge and very flavorful. There were also thin onion rings on the po'boy. Although it was tasty, the rings really made the sandwich too heavy for me. In fact, I could only down about half the po'boy! I do think it's a bit expensive, but Lola is amazing! She's warm, funny and so entertaining. Even though we waited about 50 minutes for our food to come out, we didn't mind because Lola came to talk to us and we also looked around at the eccentric decor (described in previous reviews). If I visit Lola's again, I will probably try the gumbo or red beans and rice. \\n\\nStreet parking was fairly easy to find on the side of the restaurant.

I said okay. And then decided no this isn't accurate it's a sauce I've gotten before. I again explained this. She continued to be condescending and rude. Moving on my order is complete, which after that attitude and extremely poor customer service I ultimately wanted to cancel my order. But I decided to suck it up and move on. A good 15-20 minutes passes and no one has called my name I looked over at the cart several times, where I was given eye contact each time. Figured my order can't be ready or the girl at front would say something. Finally after 10 more minutes my brother went to the cart and asked if my order was ready. The gal said she had taken my order but I didn't provide my name but it had been done for awhile. This is funny, aren't they supposed to ask my name? Or wait when my card is ran doesn't that also supply my name? But at the very least you would think if I truly didn't give a name, and you continued to give me eye contact you would just bring me my food?

Sally's, Pepe's, w.e. The list goes on. But Antico, despite it all is still my favorite pizza place. AND on top of that, the have the SECOND best cannolli that I have ever had (the best is at Modern Bakery in Hartford, CT).\\n\\nI've now tried the Lasagna, Margerita, Diavalo and San Gennaro. If anything, the pizza has gotten better since I've first come here. And to all the people giving it less than 4 stars, please tell me a better pizza place in Atlanta. \\n\\nThe crust now holds its crunchy integrity throughout the meal, resisting the plentify juices from the meat and the sauce. The crust is still delicious, with a unique saltiness that makes you come back and take bite after bite of empty carbs. \\n\\nThe ingredients are still top full of flavor. Especially the sausage. Man, I wish Krogers sold Italian sausage that tasted like that. My favorite would have to be the San Gennaro pizza. Lots of meat, lots of flavor. \\n\\nAnd to be honest, the last few times that I have been here, I have never been lacking for a seat (I come with groups of 2 or 3) and have never waited more than 10 minutes for a pizza (probably around 5 minutes). I don't find the lunch room to be extremely loud, and if you think it's too crowded, you can always sit out front where the sole table used to be.  \\n\\nAnd the cannoli, let me tell you, this cannoli is better than any that I have tried in NYC's or Boston's Little Italy. The cannoli is filled on order, and the crust isn't overly thick (like how it is in the big cities).  The crust is the perfect texture, crisp, shattering when you bite into it. The only possible downside is that the ricotta filling has a slight pepperminty taste to it. I sure don't remember that being traditional.\\n\\nAnyway, 5 stars goes to the best of it's kind. And Antico is the best of its kind in Atlanta."},{"name":"The Brewer's Table","address":"4715 E 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"An artisan chef that knows what he's doing and isn't trendy just for trendy sake. The atmosphere feels like luxurious settlers home with the raised wood fire pit, concrete slab interior with elegant design. I sat at the bar, and the bartender/server was clairvoyant of my every move. Her attention to service was worthy of Michelin star status!  \\n\\nThe swordfish belly lardo is a damn good starter dish. The swordfish was comparable to Toro in its fatty structure. The smoked apple water provided a light yet robust dimension. The pumpkin toffee was a complete 180 on paper, yet provides a beautiful counterpoint that never feels awkward or gross. It felt as if the swordfish was swimming around in an autumn lake.  \\n\\nThe winter green salad was a medley of flavors. My only real complaint I that it becomes a little too wet. The ham flavor in the vinaigrette was awesome. The Persimmon marmalade provided an earthy sweetness, along with a citrus feel without using straight juice. I'm not sure what the greens were, but they were quite different than romaine or iceberg.  \\n\\nThe rabbit carnitas are worthy of any fine dining establishment in southwestern cuisine. The pork blood mole provides an unexpectedly delightful tang and sweetness to the meal. The rabbit was cooked just right texture wise. The marinade was a beautiful concoction of ancho chile, chipotle, and other spices. The corn tortilla is house made and I can tell. The razor thin slices of whole squash or zucchini were a great touch. There's a part of me that wished there was sour cream, but it was great without it. Overall, having everything compiled together was real treat.   \\n\\nThe ice cream cone was delightfully fun. Super small, yet gets the message across real quick. The caramel and cone at the very end reminded me of a strop waffle. I kind of wish the hops in the honey and the barley in the ice cream was a little stronger. But   \\n\\nThe cheesecake semifreddo was deconstructed cheesecake. Altogether, it hits the cheesecake taste on the nail, but I feel it was a little heavy handed in the tart department. I love the black tea gummies that were added. The poached pears offered a fleshy texture, that bloomed with the browned cinnamon on top. The meringue like pieces were firm, yet easily soften in the cream.  \\n\\nThey made really good beer here. Especially the land grab. That beer lew me away. Light and crisp as a lager should be, but much more complex from the maltiness of the hay, and the smoked apples to add an extra dimension.   \\n\\nIm quite excited that this chef is here.

I should have sent it back, but given the bad attitude we received from Ben, we did not want to inconvenience him by asking him for warm meat.  This is very disappointing seeing as our bill was $166 dollars for 8 people. The final straw was when my daughter swapped a full BBQ sauce dispenser from another table with ours since it was empty for a while and Ben was nowhere to be found. Just as she was sitting back down with the full dispenser, he walked over and said \\"I saw your daughter get that bbq sauce off the other table, where is the empty one?\\"  The empty one was on the other table in place of the full one we swapped it with.

Actually the last 2 Sunday's we have visited with 2 completely different experiences. The first time was amazing and the bar staff was friendly, attentive and took great care of us. The food was good as well and we really enjoyed it. The Bloody Mary bar is really cool and you can load up on the garnishes! This past Sunday was the exact opposite experience. The bloody Mary bar was still great, but overall it was disappointing.  We sat at a table this time because the bar was full. It was busy and we understand when it's slammed, things take longer. No problem.  We sat down and waited about 10-12 minutes before being greeted. When our server came up to the table, she had quite an attitude with us and from that point on it was hard to get anything. Water refills were impossible. We had no silverware when the food came and with waiting about 30 minutes from the time we ordered until the food arrived, I think there was plenty of time to get us silverware, napkins and water refills etc... We will strike this experience up to just having a server who doesn't really care, but it did leave us with a bad taste in our mouth.  We may eventually make it back here but will try some other places out for our next brunch adventures. I'd still recommend trying it out.

It seems to be baked, then cut, then either re baked or pan fried.  I like that concept, but the cornbread is so dry and dense, and completely unsweet.  ALL southern cornbread is sweet.  All of it, always.  Southern cornbread is usually not whipped or soaked first, it's usually very gritty inside, but light.  I'm not sure what the difference is here, but it's tight, dense, hard and crumbly.  It should be more cake like and much sweeter.  The molasses butter helps, but doesn't make up for how floury/ corn-like it tastes.  \\n\\nMy date had the catfish po' boy and was mesmerized by it.  Catfish is such a hard fish to serve outside the south.  It's sort of an acquired taste because it is so muddy and fishy tasting.

Oh, Craigie, I was ready.\\n\\nThe BFF and I had ourselves a reso at 9:30p.  The host was super perky and kept using the word \\"absolutely\\" to answer any question we had.  I never realized the versatility of that word, but love it!  (Absolutely!)\\n\\nWe ordered the 4 course and braced for the chef's whims that would ensue upon our table shortly.  We tried to reject the cold, crusty bread basket, but the lure of the triangle wedge of butter was hard to ignore.  The butter was good.  The bread was cold.\\n\\nThe amuse bouche was a salty flat cylinder of white tuna topped with shiny black caviar and paired with a parmesanesque cracker.  I liked the flavor of the fish but yo, that amuse bouche seemed as if it had been am-bouched by a salt canister.  The amuse bouche had been as-salted.  Man, I will be here all night.\\n\\nThe appetizer was a tiny salad of greens and late summer tomatoes, topped with slivers of fried pig ears.  Crunchy.  Juicy.  Ripe.  Light.  Solid.\\n\\nThe second appetizer were deep fried cod cheeks topped with pickled lemon.  Tasted like fish tempura you'd get from a Japanese resto.  Like.  Piping hot, crispy and good, but not that interesting? That pickled lemon was spot on though.\\n\\nThe entree featured two slices of ribeye, some strands of oxtail pastrami and steamed/sauteed greens that tasted like bok choy and seared/griddled baby carrots.  I think I was most bummed by the size of the entree because two slices of meat seems a bit on the skimpo side, but maybe because I'm from TX, I just expect a whole cow to be slaughtered and served up on a platter for dinner.  The BFF said her ribeye was too chewy, and she ended up chewing the meat for flavor but then spitting the meat out on her napkin.  Reminded me of Seinfeld and the mutton episode.  I think the meat ended up falling out of her napkin at some point though - she didn't seem too concerned with seeing where it landed on the floor.  She's funny and gross.\\n\\nFor dessert, we were presented with two different plates: one a stone fruit cobbler with anise ice cream, the second whole wheat crepes with pear compote and goat milk ice cream.  The crunchy streusel on the cobbler was top notch, but the licoricey ice cream didn't really add anything to that dish / really didn't enjoy it.  The whole wheat crepes were bland and boring - bordering dry.  The compote was equally dull.  Appley and cinnamony.  C'mon Craigie!

If you're looking for a place where you can randomly find and eat dim sum from carts, this is NOT the place. Because there are no dim sum carts, you need to know that you want and order each plate at the table. Also there is no dim sum menu except for what's on the wall and no prices are listed. The tough part is that you're looking up on the wall at pictures of what's available dim sum and so end up starring over other people eating at the tables along the walk where the pictures are.  They really need to have a dim sum menu with PRICES on them. It's not good not knowing how much each dish costs. \\n\\nThis is almost a regular Chinese restaurant. Most of the sauces were bland or just way off. Yu choy and broccoli dishes were good. The fresh shrimp rice noodles were OK, but the sauce was watery.\\n\\nI mean come on, how can anyone not like pork belly? Pork belly dish tasted like beef stew. Plus they hid other meat on the dish besides pork belly to make the plate seem full. Myself and son didn't like that $13 dish at all.\\n\\nThe shark fin dim sum was soapy tasting, like it had some bad ingredient in it. The waiter comped us when we mentioned that it tasted bad.

I tried the new prime rib steak sandwich and have to say I was surprised.  Pretty darn good, and I grew up outside of Philly.  No it was not amazing and nothing like Philly but for a chain restaurant in Florida...pretty good.  I felt the bill was a bit on the high side though.  I have nothing against a $50.00 dinner for 2 but there are so many amazing places that I could have had better food/experience for that price.  That being said, I don't think it's a bad option to eat if you are in Waterford.

It happened to be the case that Portland is one of the American cities where Thai cuisine has really thrived, starting with such pioneers like Andy Ricker (whose Pok Pok even opened in Brooklyn at one point; I still can't believe the restaurant closed with all the wonderful things going on). One of the Thai restaurants that I really wanted to try was Langbaan, a tasting menu-only restaurant behind a bookshelf door in PaaDee, had been winning all kinds of accolades for its original take on the country's cuisine. It also was one of the hardest restaurants in the city to get a table, with reservations fully booked up to three months in advance. I put my name down on the Resy waitlist anyways, hoping that the Fourth of July week during which we were visiting Portland would lead to last minute cancellations. When I learned that I got off the waitlist, I was beyond ecstatic and was very much looking forward to a visit. Our experience at Langbaan turned out to be one of those rare moments where Jun and I had some different views on the restaurant's directions.\\n\\nThe summer tasting menu, inspired by Thai family gatherings, began in a promising manner, as we both enjoyed the bite-sized snacks that welcomed us, from the \\"miang som\\" consisting of navel orange, shrimp and herbs, to \\"kanom krok\\" which was a very pleasant crispy rice cup with refreshing scallop ceviche in it, to \\"cha-om khai naam neau\\" with Japanese wagyu beef in a Thai \\"omelette\\" that was quite fantastic. We showed up at Langbaan after a full day of wine tasting in Willamette Valley, so having an aromatic soup with braised pig's feet and soy beans helped as a cure to all the alcohol we consumed that day. It's after the soup that our opinions started to diverge. Jun, fully expecting plenty of heat, was turned off that a couple of salad dishes following the soup, one with octopus and another with salmon and mussels, didn't offer the kind of addictively spicy qualities she would typically look for at a Thai restaurant. On the other hand, I thought both dishes were quite thoughtfully prepared with beautiful plating that displays the kitchen's high level of creativity. Both the octopus and salmon had very good texture, especially the latter which was also accompanied by mussels prepared three ways (pickled, steamed and fermented). Jun took a peek at the menu again to see what was coming next and got very excited that there was a curry dish; unfortunately, the Issan style curry with halibut lacked the coconut-based spicy flavor that she came to love so much, and she was sorely disappointed. On the other hand, there was some heat to the shrimp paste relish with salted duck egg and Dungeness crab that you can wrap in fresh lettuces. I also liked the whole roasted pig with garlic, lime leaf and dry chili that was moderately spicy but had complexity of flavor I was quite fond of and worked very well with black and white sticky rice. The desserts were also solid, starting with Thai-style flan whose silky smooth texture worked well with incense-smoked blackberry caramel and charred blackberry puree, followed by jasmine-tofu pudding with ginger candy, melon and fruit ice m√©lange that blended the flavor of Thailand in a refreshing way.\\n\\nAs noted above, getting a reservation at Langbaan can be quite a challenge if you don't want to commit yourself three months in advance; I guess the best way is to try your luck on Resy's waitlist and pray that you get off the list? There is full bar with cocktails inspired by Southeast Asia's ingredients and flavor. The cozy dining room will you feel you are dining at an exclusive supper club that no one wants you to know about. Langbaan is one of the restaurants where it was really hard to pinpoint the score. Jun even initially wanted to give \\"Incomplete\\" score because she appreciated all the fun things happening behind the kitchen, but couldn't just get used to the idea that Thai food can be delicious without being spicy (and she loves spicy!). Maybe there was too much fish sauce in the food overall that just didn't agree with Jun? I do agree that we would've had a much more memorable meal had the kitchen been liberal with the spicy elements (much like the way our dining experience worked at Ugly Baby in Brooklyn, which is our favorite Thai restaurant in the city). Going forward, Jun will certainly appreciate even more those Asian restaurants that are not compromising when it comes to displaying authentic and numbingly spicy dishes."},{"name":"Daedalus Restaurant","address":"45 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"We were here for dinner last Friday and we had very good, quick service.

There are many wing establishments in the metro area, but I am looking for a place near home in case I experience one of those last minute-can't-do-without-cravings. I ran into this place on my way home from the Chiropractor and decided to give it a try. I was a little skeptical when I pulled up because the place was virtually empty, but I decided to proceed.\\n\\nNothing fancy about this place-Typical wing spot. I decided to order two 6 piece wing combos: one with mild wings and fries, extra crispy and the other with garlic pepper wings and fried rice. Both combos came with drinks and I paid $11.66, which was a great price for two meals. The wings were not too big and not too small. They were perfectly crispy like I like and seasoned just right. The fries were a nice golden brown. Not burnt and not soggy and undercooked. The only disappointing thing about this meal was the fried rice. The rice lacked seasoning and tasted like it was leftover rice from the previous day that was simply warmed in the microwave. I wasn't able to eat it even after dousing it in several packs of soy sauce and I ended up throwing it away.\\n\\nThough my quest for the perfect Eastside wing is not over-I am definitely a fan of Wings Houses wings. This will be my go to spot in the meantime while I continue my search."},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My friend and I wanted to treat our selfs for the holidays so we decided to come here.

How on earth have I not reviewed this glorious restaurant yet?!\\n\\nI eat at MeeT on average of once a week because the chain seems to be THE go-to spot for the group of animal rights activists here in Vancouver.  MeeT boasts a very expansive all vegan menu, so you definitely need time to wade through it.  At first glance, their main features seem to be rich greasy comfort food but you can also find healthier options like quinoa salad.  (For truly healthy vegan option head to Eternal Abundance on Commercial Drive)  If you have a big company you need to impress, or just generally not sure about the pickiest of eaters, just please do yourself a favor and choose MeeT- it takes away the busy work for you.  \\n\\nI have taken some of the most stubborn meat lovers here and they've all been superbly impressed by the \\"realness\\" of imitation meat.  For those really craving the satisfaction of meat without the cruelty, I highly suggest trying chiggin things, double double burger or beyond meat burger. Or, if you are craving cheese then the Mac and cheese is your safe bet.\\n\\nI personally typically gravitate toward their rice bowls like Seoul Bowl and Lovely.  \\n\\nAs far as service goes, I've had zero complaints at this particular location.  I feel that the Yaletown location does it best just because of the upscale neighborhood.  I'm also surprised that despite being such a lively place I've never had to wait for a table, whereas in Gastown location the wait can take as long as an HOUR during the weekends!\\n\\nSuggestion for the MeeT management team: Give a discount to the Vancouver animal activists groups.

I showed up six minutes before they opened, thinking it would be a breeze to walk in since there was no one else dining with me. But when I walked up, there was already a sizable line. Sooo I suggest coming at least twenty minutes before 4:30 PM to have a better chance of being in the first wave of diners. There is a reason why there is a long line. Yes, because the restaurant is small, but also because the food is worth the hype and it does not break the bank! For a seafood pasta dish (the frutti di mare) big enough to split between two people, it came out to be around $22. There is also a complimentary loaf of bread that is the perfect sponge to soak up one of the best sauces I have tasted.

This review is coming late but I am finally doing it because this has been one of my worst experiences ever. I had gone here a year before and was not happy, but I went back after a year (last year) because I was with my family and they wanted pizza and there weren't many options around. TERRIBLE BEHAVIOR from the Italian lady who is the manager/server. We got a pizza, and 2 veggie  lasagnas. The lasagna was fairly good. But unfortunately,  the pizza we had ordered had anchovies (the majority of us were vegetarians). We had not noticed that upon ordering (definitely our mistake). But we noticed when took the first bite to the pizza.  There were 4 of us and we each had taken a tiny bite from a slice. We called the server right away and told her that the pizza had seafood in it and we couldn't eat it. At that point we didn't even know what it was. She said, \\"yes, there are anchovies in it\\". We asked her if she could change that for something else since we couldn't eat it.  In response, she SMIRKED and said, \\"you want me to take a half pizza?\\" Yes, 4 slices had been taken from the pizza pan, but they were on our plates since we couldn't eat them. Now, if this had happened in a restaurant with a tiny bit of quality service and decency, the server would have instantly sought to please the customers. But of course, since you are in the North End and business is always good, you shouldn't care to make the customers happy, but instead focus on making the most money.

Heavenly honeyed, crispy yet fall off the bone, we gobbled these down with gusto. We tried their roasted pork dish which is quite good - seasoned just right. For lunch, I tried their shepards pie which was delicious - made with a hint of lamb.\\n\\nThe Irish soda bread was also very good - the sugared olive oil a perfect match.\\n\\nHowever, I do admit - I was not that adventurous. I did not order the infamous Dalkey Duo - Cocktail wieners deep fried. I did however observe an unfortunate soul who did.

Really good if you want something simple and not too aggressive. \\nI had skirt steak with beans and rice for my entree. The steak had a chimichurri sauce and was cooked well and flavor was on point. I loved the sauces they brought to the table with the steak. There was a garlic sauce and a jalape√±o sauce. The beans and rice were average but the ripe sweet plantains were delicious.

So after waiting that long, it was really disappointing to be sat next to two very drunk men who pretty much ruined our meal. They were loud and crude, even interrupting my meal a few times even though I made it pretty clear I wasn't in the mood to chat with them. You may wonder why this reflects poorly on Langbaan. Well, it's because they served these men cocktail after cocktail, despite them being drunk upon arrival and their increasingly obnoxious behavior as the night went on. Only after 4 or 5 cocktail did one of the wait staff cut them off. Maybe serving 4+ drinks to drunk customers is fine in other restaurants, but this is a small (25 people max I believe?) area that many people wait months to dine at. Not cool at all.

The place was packed and now I'm thinking that it's graduation week which explains why I was seeing parent-looking people in the dining room. \\n\\nI was seated right away and given a wine/cocktail list until husband arrived. I sat waiting smelling the delicious food cooking in the kitchen (which is in the middle of the restaurant). The service throughout the evening was attentive. We had the same waitress who took our order, but the serving and busing came from all different people. They were well staffed, for sure. The seating area (at least the one to the left from the entrance) is a little tight for all the foot traffic but we were pretty comfortable. \\n\\nWe decided to do the Prix Fixe menu; this way you can try most of everything and it does save you a few dollars overall (not much, mind you-- this place is muy expensivo). I had the Rose' they had by the glass ($12). \\nBefore we even began our meal, a server gave us two little tastes of something from the kitchen (complimentary). I can't even remember now what it was exactly, but it was definitely bacon. :)\\n\\nTo start we had the Octopus (a large 1st course!) and the Six Oysters. Then, I had the Vermont Pork Three-Ways: Suckling Confit, Spice-Crusted Rib, Grilled Belly and Husband had the Swordfish. For dessert, I had the Apricot Frangipane Torte\\n(pistachio, grains of paradise, amaretto ice cream) and husband had the Banana Millefeuill (parsnip, dates, cocoa wafer). Each part of this meal was amazing and delicious. I was pretty full after the second course, but I also had taken my time to savor and taste every bit of the dish in the way I would think the chef would want me to enjoy it. The spice crusted rib: the meat fell off the bone with a little knock from my fork. \\n\\nHusband and I tasted each others dishes. This was an indulgent meal, so tasty and delectable. Husband received a perfect pour of his Full Sail Session Lager (perfect head).\\n\\nThe service was classy, with the addition and removal of appropriate silverware, wine service, bottled still water, etc. But, I think you are are reminded you are in Cambridge when the waitress and and staff are unpretentious, friendly and attentive.

There are multiple reasons for this.\\n\\nFirst of all, the good.  The BBQ was smokey, flavorful and delicious.  I got the all you can eat option and was full beyond uncomfortable.  Then, it was an experience.  That is the best word to describe it.  When we drove up, the parking lot was Disney size due to it's popularity.  They had their act together, checking you in, a large waiting area, and notifying you with those buzzy things when your number is called.\\n\\nThen, the negative.  Do you have time?  Well, you better, because you will have to wait and wait and wait.  I think this place got a lot of hype for being the best, and they were really good, but the best, no way.  The Disney parking lot should have clued me in.  When we checked in, they warned us that it was going to be at least an hour.  Technically, they were correct.  We waited an hour and a half.  The large waiting are could hold twice as much as the restaurant and they did.  Then we we got it, we waited forever to get a menu and and then waited forever to get some ice teas.  Then we waited forever to get our order.  BBQ is already cooked, so I thought we didn't have to wait long to get our meal.  Wrong.  They had to catch the cow, butcher it, cook it before we got our meal delivered.  Perhaps I'm exaggerating, but should we have to wait another 30 minutes for meat that was already cooked.  BBQ is cooked low and slow so it takes hours to cook.  So, it was already cooked.  No one came back to us in a timely manner to get our next round.  The first round was truly disappointing, dried and overcooked.  The 2nd round was perfect,  Delicious, smoked perfectly and tasty.  The drive was in bull dunk miles from anything.\\n\\nSo the extra long drive and the extra long wait will make me reluctant to recommend this place.  The good BBQ was very very good, but not great.

Sometimes I get the same feeling when my wife calls me by my first and middle name........... And when I walked into a shoe box of a restaurant name the Maple Street Tavern and there was only three people in the restaurant at 7 o'clock on a Saturday night I got the same feeling.                    \\nDrinks\\n It started out trying to order a drink which was a complete joke, it should not be that complicated to get a couple drinks, but it really was quite complicated, and after figuring out what they do serve and what they don't serve and what flavor they serve and what flavor they don't serve .......the drinks were just terrible.\\n\\nAppetizers\\n we split a dozen of chicken wings and after eating four I realized the remainders were disgusting ...... The were dark on the outside and when I open them up the dark on the inside too.... seems like they were just old.\\n\\nEntr√©es\\nI ordered a burger and my wife ordered the salmon which were told there was no salmon....?........ Maybe the three other people in the restaurant all ordered the salmon?     I now realize my first mistake was walking in the front door and my second was saying \\"why don't you try the special instead\\"?......... Just a few moments after ordering, the girl comes and erases the special and just writes Fried scallops.... So my wife says to me, it looks like I'm getting the last piece of fish and it tasted like it was the last fish .....the scallops were huge and cold in the center.        The whole dish was just very bland.                    Now for my cheeseburger I requested that it be cooked medium and it came out raw...... Not medium rare, not rare, but raw ........it is just unbelievable that somebody that cooks for a living to be that off....... The bun was completely soaked I left the complete burger on my plate and the waitress never asked why I did not eat it.      I would explain to her that it was raw and loaded with plastic cheese on top of it...\\n\\nDessert.....NONE\\nI realize that if they cannot get pub food right then they have no business trying to make desserts.......... But there is an epic bakery right next store that you think they could make some deal to work together.\\n\\nRecap\\nThis whole experience was just terrible........ I live in Danvers and I try to spend my money locally but there are just too many restaurants nearby there are far superior to this one....... Do not waste your time or money here. And of course everybody knows that it was my fault because I told my wife to order the special...."},{"name":"Papa John's Pizza","address":"411 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"I would provide a rating lower than 1, based upon how many other people they simply disrespected this night. \\n\\nI had a simple order, a single Double XL based on the deal they were offering. Nothing special, but please put only pepperoni on one half. And what followed was a level of blanket disrespect to customers that was new to me. \\n\\nSome context: I'm staying the weekend for an event, so it was delivered to a hotel. I usually get Domino's, but the deal seemed decent. It's 9pm on a Saturday when it starts. This is for me and a friend. I'm paying cash. \\n\\nHere's the basic timeline of the night:\\n9:12 I place the order. Expected delivery is 9:46 at the latest. \\n9:30 I check up on it, it is in the \\"boxing stage\\"\\n9:40 still boxing\\n9:46 still boxing. I'm a bit concerned now but wait. \\n10:01 it's 15 passed the latest expected time and still boxing. I give them more time\\n10:15 alright 30 minutes late, I give them a call. I'm asked to hold, I agree, queue 8 minutes of silence. Finally someone comes back and I ask where my order is and give them my name, queue 8 more minutes of silence. I give up and hang up. \\n10:32 I go to the lobby to wait in case they show up. Amazingly, my order moves to the En Route step. I am now convinced they simply forgot my order. \\n10:42 (Now an hour after initial expected delivery) it says my order was delivered, but I'm sitting in the lobby with no pizza. I call the store. Busy signal. I call again, 4 more times, all busy signals. \\n10:47 I call their corporate support line, they attempt to contact the store, no avail. They log an incident report. \\n10:56 I get a call from the driver, he is here. I ask him what the heck happened. His answer (paraphrased) \\"We are super busy, we are understaffed, and to deal with the issue, we disconnected the phone lines.\\" He offers to give me the pizza for free and \\"I'll just say I took it for a roommate\\" to which I decline (this should be on the company or manager, not one of its employees). I check the pizza. It's at least there and the toppings look correct, although the amount of pepperoni on the pepperoni only side is a little sad looking. \\n11:00 Driver leaves, I actually feel the pizza. It's barely warm. I'm just going to eat it at this point. It's been 74 minutes since the latest expected delivery time and I just want to sleep. \\n\\nIn the end, they completely blocked themselves off from any kinda of customer service or contact because they were busy. They gave me a barely passable product. They offered sketchy compensation. And this is just my experience. \\n\\nMoral of this story, if Papa John's is going to be busy, (which is the main time people get pizza obviously), go somewhere else with you time and money."},{"name":"The Juice Truck Shop","address":"28 W 5th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I was a pretty loyal 'trucker' and went daily when they were in Gastown, and now the 5th Ave location is closer to me, so I went back a lot but I had a super disappointing last experience here and I don't know that i'll be back, I won't for food at least.\\n\\nI used to get their fresh spring rolls frequently, and at $6 for two, they're not cheap. The best thing about the spring rolls is the dipping sauce - it is delish. Well, last time I went I could see that the punnet of sauce was significantly less full than other times, I said something to the woman at the counter and she dismissed it and said I was wrong, which struck me as quite rude. I'd had this many times and wasn't just saying it. She offered me more sauce and I said yes, and then after a few seconds she asked the girl at the smoothie machines how much extra sauce was, I thought it was cheeky to kindly offer something that has an extra charge.... Then they told me another punnet was $2.50! $2.50 for a 1/3 full punnet of dipping sauce. What a joke, and a sneaky money making techinique. It really annoys me when they reduce portion sizes so they can charge extra, and I thought Juice Truck was better than that. I declined the offer of another sauce and, low and behold, I ran out of the dipping sauce (which has never happened before, proving that there was way less sauce) and I was left with lacklustre rolls. That's why they need the dipping sauce.\\n\\nI've also brought the salad from here, and it's a rip-off. $11 for kale, some spiced lentils, a small amount of quinoa and cauliflower. The dressing is tasty, but for the price it is not worth it. I wish it had a bit more too it, as it needs something to make it a full meal.\\n\\nI also got the pumpkin spice smoothie last time I was there and I really didn't like it. It tasted like sweet, spiced almond milk and it was so runny. A smoothie should be a little chunky. It didn't really taste like anything and at $8 it was overpriced, and I didn't finish it because it was just gross. The chocolate one is always good though, so I guess I just caught a bad one.\\n\\nI like the service (generally) and the fact that it's all vegan whole, healthy foods. The smoothies are yum and so are the sweet treats. \\n\\nThis whole experience really put me off and makes me not want to go back. It felt as though the veneer of the place wore off and now I see that it's overpriced. For $14 I expect far more. I might go back for a smoothie but wouldn't go for the food again."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Tip: check into the waitlist on yelp!
