First time I came wasn't good experience the food was not up to par, I had gotten boiled yucca w/garlic sauce and it was just no bueno. Second time, I got the wings and guayaba cheesecake and it was actually pretty okay. Today I went with a couple of friends from school in which the vast majority got the tropi bowl and I got the \\"light meal\\" which consisted of a small portion of Caribbean soup and half of a chicken wrap, I also bought the Lg portion of tostones, and then a guayaba cheesecake. The total of my meal was $11. It was nice for them to have a sauce bar where we can get as much as we wanted so that's a plus. \\n\\nI was only able to get through the soup and two tostones because I got full. The soup was actually pretty good, it had yucca, sweet potatoe, chicken and some other veggies; was nice portion for lunch. Tostones was really big, I got the Lg batch so it had about 5 of them. They were really crispy, no sal on them, tho . I'll update later for the cheesecake & chicken Cesar wrap!\\nUpdate: the wrap was just \\"okay\\". The tortilla was  multigrain (I believe) and I didn't taste the \\"Cesar\\" aspect of it. The chopped grilled chicken that it was stuffed with was actually juicy and seasoned- good  . The cheesecake was alright and edible. \\n\\nMy friends thought their bowls were pretty good, one was not offered to add any toppings at time of order so they were pretty disappointed with that. Two ordered the mango tea and they said it was sugarless and very watered down.

The vanilla dipping sauce that comes with them is divine!\\n\\nMy Yelp friend Susan R. went with me last night and we split the Slow-cooked Lamb Shank and the Kouzzina Trio (tasting size portions of Pastitisio, Char-grilled Lamb Burger, and Cinnamon-stewed Chicken with Orzo).  Tasting size was right, very small portions.  I would rather spend the money on a full portion but it was nice to finally taste the Cinnamon-stewed Chicken with Orzo and the Pastitisio.  I loved the Cinnamon-stewed Chicken so much, I got a full order to go!!!  Guess what I'm having for dinner tonight;o)  The Pastitisio had good flavor but I would not order it again, not with all of the other good dishes to be had.  The Lamb Burger had good flavor and has a spicy kick.  I'll let Susan R. post her review on Yelp with the other things she ordered.  But I tried some of it and it was very good, too!!  \\n\\nI've had Greek food in the past but now because of Kouzzina, I'm HOOKED on it!  I even found as many recipes as I could for what they serve at Kouzzina so I can make them when I visit my family and for the future when I may not live close enough to eat here anymore.

I also know its a popular gelato flavor, so I figure I can't go wrong with a classic. The lady who helped us also mentioned that she intentionally went to Italy to learn how to make gelato, so I thought great, we hit jackpot. However, I wasn't completely impressed with their gelato. It didn't taste any different to me.. compared to other gelatos. Don't get me wrong though, it was still great, but I'm not sure if it was worth $5 great.

We didn't freak out, and weren't mad, as what can one do about weather, and, it is better for everyone to be safe!\\n\\nWe checked in, registered/paid and were given our key. We were hungry, so ate at the burger bar in the lobby. It was very good.\\nThe key to our room that we were given didn't work, so I went back to the lobby to get a new key. Something on their end happened at that point, unbeknownst to us.\\n\\nWe just wanted to sleep, as we had just finished a long trip. About three hours after we fell asleep, there was a banging on the door. A gentleman who identified himself as the 'Engineer' was yelling that there was no one supposed to be in 'this room.' He was demanding we open the door to provide picture i.d. I called security in a panic, and the woman at the desk who checked us in (Kelli) said, \\"Oh, it's ok, I sent him.\\"\\nThis has never happened in our entire life, having someone yelling through a door, and asking for photo i.d. AFTER registering/paying for a stay.\\nI went to the lobby to inquire about what happened. Kelli was embarrassed and offered a pathetic apology, only because I was standing there. She was very confused.\\n\\nCut to arriving home cross Country. We disputed the charge due to what we thought was definitely not a good 'happening.' There was no explanation of what happened, or why they thought we had occupied the room no one was supposed to be in. OR...a simple phone call to say, \\"Someone is on their way up to speak with you.\\" We're reasonable, good people.\\n\\nIn the credit card dispute, we had a three-person call with the hotel and it's manager on duty. They are so disorganized/confused at this property. A manager phoned me and ASKED me to return her call. I dialed the number of the property, not a personal  line, and asked for 'Kenyatta.' The girl (Holiday Inn employee) who answered the phone asked if I was 'Kenyatta's ex-husband. I said, \\"What?!!!\\" SO unprofessional.\\n\\nLong story short, when I called to speak to another manager, her VM message announced that she would be out of town until a date nearly 3 weeks before I was calling. It had never been changed, AND her message box was full. When I did finally speak to her, she was unkind, unprofessional, and defensive. Her 'go to' was, \\"If it scared you so much, why did you stay?\\" i.e. I guess we were supposed to head out to find another hotel at nearly midnight in a City we had never been to. Oh bother. When I mentioned about the unprofessional question of weather I was the ex-husband calling...the Manager said, \\"Yeah, there's lots of problems there.\\"  Tragic, personal dramas have no place in any customers life. To call a corporate phone number and have to deal with that?...stupifying!\\n\\nI write a lot of good reviews. I don't ever look for 'bad.' This was simply a horrible experience, with zero offer to make it right. They could have offered 1/2 off or SOMETHING. We ended up having to pay for the nights stay. The money was not the issue, it was the principle. \\nThese days, there are simply too many places to choose to stay, than to have to put up with a less than peaceful, disruptive, pounding-on-the-door-night. \\nHoliday Inn corporation would FLIP if they knew of this occurrence. But, it all stops with the managers of each hotel covering themselves, to save their jobs. Sad.\\n\\nFYI. We booked through 'Booking.com.' In the past, I have liked them. This booking taught me something to keep in mind. If you do not book directly with the Hotel itself, you are re-directed to the booking site/company for ANY complaint. No matter what. The Hotel says, 'You'll have to take it up with them.'"},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I've been here twice in the past 2 visits to Portland.

She sat in the redroom in the bar area when she heard the bartender call last call, but he never came and checked on her. I got there about 5:50pm and she had moved into the main bar area. Servers kept walking by us without smiling or making eye contact, and no one had been by to place our order. Finally about 5:55pm I got the bartenders attention and he came over to take our order. I told him we wanted to squeeze in happy hour before 6pm and he stopped me by saying that it was already over and that there computer system shuts happy hour off at 5:45pm... It said that nowhere in the bar or on the menu. He told us that he had just informed another girl of this and she ended up walking out... Way to lose another customer. \\nHe then said he'd check with the chef to see if it could still be honored, but the chef said no, but the bartender offered us hh price on the wine...now its past 6pm.\\nHow can you give us hh price on wine after 6pm but not food when you told us that your computer system completely won't allow you to do that? Hmmm....\\n\\nAfter we left, my sister and I were still upset and so she called the restaurant to speak to the manager. The girl at the front answer the phone and told my sister that the manager was too busy to come to the phone and asked to take a message. My sister asked her what time happy hour was at and the girl replied that it was from from 3 to 6 p.m. My sister asked her if you could still order food up until 6 p.m. The girl seemed to hesitate and said well, we really only do happy hour until 5:45p.m. \\n\\nSo yesterday I decided to call and speak to the manager whose name is Ivan. I called and told him about the experience that my sister and I had a few days ago and explained to him how disappointed and upset we were that there was no signage or information about happy hour being shorter than what is stated. He told me that he appreciated my feedback, but then became extremely defensive over what I was saying and was defending himself and the wait staff. He agreed that they should redo their signage, however he could not get me off the phone fast enough. Every time I started to voice my opinion, he basically just tried to smooth it over by saying, \\"yeah,\\" \\"okay,\\" \\"alright,\\" like he wanted to end the call immediately, which made me even more mad. I told him that he just lost a lot of business as we would not be back, and to prove he wasn't listening to me, he said \\"okay,  well we will do our best to make your next visit with us better...\\" He also got rude with me by saying that everywhere that serves happy hour shuts it down about 10-15 minutes before the top of the hour. That is so false.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we will not be returning to Sinju Bridgeport and Ivan needs a complete overhaul in professionalism"},{"name":"Caff√® Nero","address":"298 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Ever since I saw the sign that Caffe Nero was opening in Brighton, I've been eyeing to go - and when I finally did, I was happily satisfied!

Arriving past nine, we waited for about fifteen minutes for a table (no reservation) as we drank a pitcher of the excellent sangria at the bar. So far so good. Everything was going well until we ate our first dish, which was a special tapa with white asparagus: it was awful. They clearly had not cut off the dried up tips, and the vinaigrette sauce just wasn't good. The other two vegetarian tapas we got weren't all that much better either. The leek quiche was pathetically flimsy, small, and lacking, and the goat cheese empanadas simply tasted like bad crab rangoon. Then again, Spanish food isn't really known for being vegetarian friendly, so Tasca did regain stars for its meat dishes. The duck confit and the sausage plate were both great, and I devoured them quickly as I drank four glasses of sangria. The duck in particular was just fall-off-the-bone incredible.

Overall the food and service were great, and I'm already planning a night to go back with friends.\\n\\nOne thing to note about reservations/availability:\\n\\nBe aware of their \\"reservation\\" policy if you are going to eat with a group of people.  I called ahead as we were going to be a group of about 10 originally, and was told that they don't take reservations Thursday through Sunday, or any other day between the hours of 6pm and 9pm.  Moreover, they won't seat you unless your entire party is present.  Weak.  To make sure we wouldn't be waiting all night for a table, the hostess suggested we head there before/at 6pm.  Our group ended up only being 5 that night, and when we arrived at 6pm we were seated without a problem.  As soon as 6:15/6:30 hit though the place was PACKED.  \\n\\nOkay on to the awesome stuff.\\n\\nWe started out with homemade biscuits and an order of fried green tomatoes, along with some cocktails.  The biscuits and honey butter were the best thing we ate that night, and were HUGE.  Our table of 5 split one bucket and it was more than enough.  \\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes were pretty good considering you can't really find them around Boston (at least I haven't been able to), and were served with a ranch style sauce on the side.  They were fried perfectly and the tomatoes were firm and had great flavor.  I'd order them again, but will probably check out some of the other apps next time around.\\n\\nFor drinks I had a Houston AFB which was tart and delicious, and strong.  For $10 it was a bit small, though.  Colleagues had a manhattan, some other mixed drink I can't remember, and a few beers which they all enjoyed.  It's a pretty extensive drink/beer menu which is cool.\\n\\nOkay, more food stuff.  The table ordered: a pork belly tray, rib tray, pulled pork sandwich on texas toast and a brisket sandwich on bulkie roll.  For sides we had farm salad, baked beans, and broccoli + cheese casserole.  All of the meat comes dry, but they have 3 different kinds of sauce on the table: a Texas-style BBQ, a vinegar-based BBQ sauce, and finally some sort of hot sauce.  I had the pulled pork sandwich on toast with the Texas BBQ sauce and it was heaven.  They give you so much meat that I had to remove half of it from the sandwich just so that I could pick it up and eat it.  I'm down with that (especially since you're paying about $12 for a sandwich).  I wasn't as huge a fan of the sides, and next time will probably just skip them entirely (I had farm salad and broccoli cheese casserole).  On the side also comes onion and pickles, and while I don't normally eat pickles these were garlicky and had a bite to them which was unexpected.\\n\\nAll of my friends really enjoyed their meals, and we all pretty much had to have most of the food wrapped up (yes, even the men).  \\n\\nFinally, I can't say enough great things about our server.  He was really attentive, had a great sense of humor and was helpful in recommending drinks for us.  A+.\\n\\nFor 5 people the apps, drinks and entrees came to just about $174.  Not the cheapest, but for the money you're paying they definitely give you a lot of food.  I've paid $40 for much worse in shittier atmospheres.  \\n\\nTo top off the great meal and drinks we had a Tiffani sighting which was a fun way to end the night.  Nice to know she's a constant presence in her own restaurant.  She'll definitely be getting more of my money soon!"},{"name":"Nar Mediterranean Grill","address":"3402 Technological Ave, Ste 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"As someone who is not wild about Mediterranean cuisine in general, I was reluctant to go to Nar, even at the behest of some of my friends who had given it a rave review.

I ordered the chicken doner rice plate with bulgar rice, which came with two sides. I elected the to try the hummus and bean salad as my sides. While we waited, the owner of the restaurant visited our table several times making conversation, talking about the music that the restaurant plays, making recommendations, and telling us where he's from and how the restaurant came about. He was very friendly, and has obviously put a lot of thought and work into the restaurant which showed in the quality of the food. \\n\\nThe hummus was spectacular, served with sides of lavas bread, and the bean salad was likewise delicious. The chicken itself was seasoned deliciously, and was juicy and tender, served on top of a bed of seasoned bulgar rice. The meal came together exceptionally well, and it was obvious that the owner knows what he's doing with the food. Again, as someone who previously was not a fan of Mediterranean food, I wasn't sure if this place would do it for me, but the atmosphere, the owner, and the food have convinced me that I need to give this place several more visits.

I imagined gooey, cheesy, mac and cheese and what I received was anything but. The rosemary fries were tasty at first, but by the end of the bag of fries I was tired of them. I did not feel that the 10 bucks I paid was worth it. I believe in trying everything 2x since sometimes it can just be a menu item or an off day, but I will not be getting that burger again. I love that they have a vegan menu and when we are in the area I will take my wife since she is vegetarian/vegan.

It is a nice, clean, and upscale establishment on whose service, food, and drinks one can rely on. As a bonus, my wife is very sensitive to many kinds of preservatives used in food preparation and is prone to severe migraine headaches. As you can imagine, this often makes eating out an unpleasant experience.  To date, she has not suffered from a headache as a result of eating at this cafe. Kudos to you.\\n\\nAs you might be wondering, if we are so happy with Cactus Club then why am I giving a 2 star review? It was an exceedingly unpleasant experience  when the waitress brought out meals and accidentally knocked over a glass of red wine. She was obviously inexperienced as she served the food on the side of the person where the wine was sitting. There was plenty of room all around the table so we do not understand why she chose this location. Anyway, as you might have guessed, the wine went all over the place, including my designer pale blue dress.\\n\\nMy wife was upset and the waitress went to get the manager; a young man of about 30 years. He went to fetch a dirty and stinky dishcloth. My wife protested that she would not want to even touch such a horrible cloth. The manager said that my wife should take the dress to the dry cleaners and return to the restaurant with the bill.\\n\\nI thought that my wife had been very patient up until this point in time; however, now my wife let him 'have it'. She laid into him stating that she should not have to do his job. That she living in North Vancouver and shouldn't have to travel all the way downtown for such a reason. She said that the waitress ruined her dress and the otherwise pleasant experience of everyone sitting at that table. It was an upsetting experience fro everyone, to be sure.\\n\\nThe young manager went to get the General Manager who told my wife that they would send someone to our home and pick up the dress to be cleaned. He also said that the restaurant would deduct the cost of her 2 drinks from the bill. Little consolation for all of the heartache this experience had cased all of the guests sitting at her table.\\n\\nI have to agree with my wife. The amount of angst that was required to get to the final 'resolution' is unacceptable. I put 'resolution' in quotes because 2 free drinks hardly makes up for the mess and horrible feelings caused by the incident. \\n\\nThe restaurant must accept full responsibility for ruining the dress and the good feelings of all of these guests in an instant. This should become policy. One should not have to FIGHT with the staff to get satisfaction. It took my wife the rest of the day just to calm down.\\n\\nNot happy.\\n\\nSincerely, Felix Daske\\n\\nEdit - \\n\\nThe General Manager contacted my wife via email, a full 4 days after the event, to ask for the address so that the dress could be collected. My wife had taken the dress to a professional on Saturday (the day following the event) because she did not trust the Manager. Obviously, one cannot leave a stain soaked dress for 4 days!\\n\\nMy wife told the manager as much and informed him that she would be contacting head office.\\n\\nA couple of days after we contacted head office we were pleased to receive an apologetic phone call. They agreed that this matter should not have been escalated as it was and should have, instead, been resolved to the customer's satisfaction 'on the spot.' I believe that they are taking appropriate action to see that the staff are properly educated in these matters.\\n\\nThe customer service representative assured my wife that things would be put right.\\n\\nWe are now happy with the outcome on this matter and will plan to return to this restaurant when the opportunity presents itself.\\n\\nSincerely, Felix Daske"},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I visited Sweet Cheeks Q for the the first meeting up with a friend in city. City parking is always tough but I knew this when we selected this spot so I won't hold that gainst them. Upon walking in, the first thing that caught me was the unbelievable aroma from the kitchen. It was a great smell without the smokey feel you get from some BBQ joints. After a short wait, as we requested a separate table rather than the community seating, we got out table and sat. Our water mason jars were filled rather quickly and we ordered drinks and a bucket of biscuits. These biscuits were to die for and filling enough to be a meal. The honey butter was amazing. Our waiter took our order (we loved the fact that they used utility belts instead of aprons) and our food came out quickly. I got the tray with two meets and two hot sides, brisket, pulled pork, Mac and cheese and BBQ ranch beans. Everything on my plate was AMAZING, including the pickles. Their light brown colored BBQ sauce in the larger bottle on the center of the table made everything even better. My companion also got the pulled pork along with the broccoli casserole which was also delicious. Our only complaint is that our waiter promptly gave us the bill when taking away our dishes when we would have preferred another drink as we stayed to chat a while longer.

Food and napkins littered the dated and dirty carpet. The booths were filthy as well. Apparently, cut orange slices were left in the open with no concern for food safety---which is probably why I felt queasy after eating there. In addition, the staff wins the rudeness award. Never have I eaten at a place which has such disdain for its customers.

But I'll talk about that later and get on with the food. My boyfriend and I shared a Fat Cheeks Tray which comes with your choice of 3 meats, one cold scoop, and one hot scoop. For only $26, that is a pretty good price. For the meats, we got the pork belly, ribs, and bbq pulled brisket. For the hot scoop, we ordered the broccoli casserole and watermelon salad for the cold scoop. The ribs were really good and juicy (kind of lacking in flavor, but that is where the BBQ sauce comes in) and was easy to pull off the bones. The pork belly was crispy yet juicy. Again, lacking in flavor a bit. The bbq pulled brisket was definitely my favorite of all three. It had the perfect amount of bbq sauce and it was so tender and juicy. I couldn't get enough of it! The broccoli casserole was also one of my favorite components of our meal and couldn't get enough of it. It almost tasted like a broccoli cheddar soup - my most favorite soups of all time. The watermelon salad was quite a disappointment. I expected chunks of watermelon salad dressed in a vinegrette, but all it was was a slice of watermelon with a sprinkle of cheese and a garnish on top. It was a juicy and sweet watermelon though - I'll give them that. I wished I ordered a different cold scoop. Their biscuits are to die for! I was expecting small/regular sized biscuits, but they were HUGE and so buttery! I love LOVE butter. It came out hot and fresh and it was just so good. The spread itself was really good as well - it was a great complement to the buttery biscuit. \\n\\nAlright service - it wasn't the worst service I've experienced, but it was certainly VERY slow. It probably took him 15-20 minutes to get me my beer and when he got it for me, he literally just put it down on the table without acknowledging any of us to see if we were ready to order. 5 mins after we sat down, he asked if we were ready to order and we said no, so when he got us the beer, he should've asked if we were ready. We waited so long for someone to come to us to get our order and it also took a long time for us to get our food as well. I don't know if thats how the restaurant is: slow, but I'll disregard it.

This review is pertaining to a visit last month with my customers.  If a server comes and greets your table and says he'll be taking care of you...and his name is Jim.  RUN!  Either request another server or depart and find somewhere else to eat.  The cost of eating at Watershed and the lack of value Jim will bring to the experience will net you negative.  There were so many negatives, I'm not going to list them all.  Some of the highlights:  no refills on water and tea, long spans of not having any service at the table, a creepy factor of Jim continuously talking about a table of young girls (assume he meant ladies) that were drinking it up and they seem to be looking to 'party', etc.  The last straw was that Jim did not have anything to do with bringing any of our courses out including our entr√©es.  That's not a big deal and not uncommon with upper end dining.  But, the four of us had finished our entr√©es including one of us not getting a $8 or $9 side dish and we never saw Jim or anyone else...until I excused myself and spoke with management.  It's server 101 to stop by and ask how it looks, tastes and if we need anything else very shortly after receiving any course...let alone the main course.  Once I stepped away from my customers to bring my concerns and issues to the attention of the dining room manager, Seble Sacchinelli, we never saw Jim again and the service was lightyears more positive compared to what we were experiencing.  Jim...I'm sure you were wondering why you had been taken off our table service and most likely were told.  You should have been taken your lumps and at least come by and apologized.  We were directly in your path of movement since our seat was next to the kitchen entrance/exit!\\n\\nThe Emily, Seble and other management, the four of us thought that Jim brings absolutely no value to your restaurant and the dining experience.

I remember when IHOP first opened here we really enjoyed coming here.  We always felt welcomed by the employees who were very friendly and had good senses of humor and good food.  Now it seems like both the service and the food has slid downhill.  This was the second time we were served by a waiter named Adrick.  Adrick seems to have the worst serving attitude.  When he brings you your dishes he literally throws the glasses and plates down in front of you and takes off even before you have a chance to say thank you.  When he turns away the look on his face makes you feel like that is the last place he wants to be.  It makes you feel very uncomfortable like you shouldn't be there.  The food was not very good either.  Not the worst thing ever, but no where near good and bordering on bad.  And the menus had not been cleaned at all.  On two different page turns the pages were stuck together!  The floor needed a good sweeping too for as slow as it was it shouldn't have had debris all over.

We looked at the menu before trying to decide. The prices here were kind of pricey and I made a remark about it. One friend of mine, who ran the BMO Vancouver marathon a few times and is from Surrey, agreed to treat us all out to lunch. I was like okay and thanked her after we got a table near the entrance. Apparently, we 4 got here at a good time when lunch service was kind of winding down, but it was packed as hell. The ambiance of the Cactus Club Cafe was noisy, but casual. The service here was quite nice, an upscale approach to Hooter's, since the servers here were dressed similarly to them. Not that I was complaining, but just observing. The overall experience was a mixed bag and I enjoyed hanging out with friends, good food, and talking about the upcoming marathon (the next morning).\\n\\nThe Cactus Club Cafe is centrally located basically across the way from the west building of the Vancouver convention center at 1085 Canada Place. My friends and I were fortunate to be seated so quickly, so that made my stomach happy. The prices here, as aforementioned were kind of pricey, but I guess it was in CAD and not in USD, but I thought it was all the same, more or less. The restaurant was quite clean, orderly in a jazzy atmosphere with music playing in the background. While it wasn't as much as a nightclub, it was a happening place to have lunch with friends. The parking situation for me was kind of a no brainer, considering that I already had parking underneath the convention center's west building. They may be street parking nearby, but probably its limited and you'd need to pay for it. Regardless of that, coming here was a nice change of pace from fast food options and other places that were just too blah for my tastes. The Cactus Club Cafe accepts the major credit cards, so that's always a plus. The service here was decent, positive, and friendly. It wasn't too fast, but fast enough for our stomachs.\\n\\nI ultimately ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich with French fries. I also ordered a longboard lager. Not sure if it's the same as the signature Kona longboard lager, but it was the one that hit the spot. The Cajun chicken sandwich tasted pretty good and the French fries were decently good too. I know that this place is decidedly good, but not terrific. It was above average for what it does, but can see myself coming here for special events - if I ever come back to Vancouver. Needless to say, my experience was good and it left a smile on my face, especially because I was among friends in a great city and on vacation. I would recommend this place for happy hour. Definitely recommend trying a beer or two before getting loaded with friends. The food here can be a mixed bag, but still a nice place to try with friends on a great weekend in Vancouver.\\n\\n4.0 solid stars.

I will post lots of pictures and give you a brief description of ones not pictured.\\n\\nThis is a beautiful spot to share a meal with anyone. The environment from the moment you arrive outside of the building is filled with tranquility and positivity. The combination of the ultra clean design of the restaurant and the quite but happy servers  allows you to really focus on the two most important things; experience of the food and those whom which your sharing it with.\\n\\nDining options:\\nInside in the sleek white walled, oak furniture stainless steel setting or \\nOutside under the Christmas white light light lit trees \\n\\nAs you are seated you will be given a short but informative dialogue of the specials and how the experience works. I suggest asking your servers for their favorites and pairings with wines as mine (Anna) was so informative of these things.\\n\\nI would described this restaurant as a high end tapas style establishment. I would suggest ordering a few appetizers from the menu and a larger pasta dish (homemade.. pasta.. need I say more?) . As you dine on the dishes you ordered another server throughout your dining experience will travel by with a dim sum cart featuring several different small plates you may choose from. These will change each time they stop by along with the price.\\n\\nThese plates will start at $8 on the first round and increase by $2 a plate each time they pass by. \\nOnce you have finished tasting and pairing every delicious farm to table item they have to offer you MUST try at least one desert.  They are the kind you wish you could have everyday. Perfectly sweetened with fresh fruit and natural sugars which leave your brain screaming with feel good endorphins.  \\n\\nThese are my cliff note tips to making this experience as amazing as mine:\\n\\n* pork carnitas : recommended by server. Simply delicious. \\n* you can split a glass of wine to allow you to pair with different dishes while keeping you blood alcohol level and price down. \\n* ask for Anna.

You can get 2 sandwiches, a large coffee, 6 bagels to go and a tub of cream cheese for under $20! Yes, we OD on bagels when we visit the store! \\nThe one negative, and this is a direct result of the overall awesomeness of the place, is the line. It is incredibly long, especially on weekends. If you go an off hour during the week, say 1pm on a Tuesday then you won't encounter a line. But, if you're like most people and really just have time on the weekend, you are sure to find a line. A very long line. Sometimes it goes fast, but most times it's pretty slow. I average about 15 minutes in line per visit. Other locations have a drive-thru, but that is just as bad. I think we waited 35 minutes (insane, I know!) one day in the rain in that drive-thru line at the Reading location. \\nI definitely recommend this place, it is well worth the wait.

They started by taking my favorite lobster roll and decreasing the size and quality, and increasing the price.. and now it's not even on the menu. The service keeps getting worse and worse. Last summer we tried to go a few times, and while the patio was almost empty, they were so understaffed that they wouldn't let you sit down. This was a major turnoff, especially after happening multiple times. \\n\\nTwo weeks ago we went on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm. It wasn't busy at all so we were seated on the patio. I ordered the grilled portabella sandwich with onion rings. My 2 girfriends got what was advertised as a \\"grilled veggie pocket\\", and my husband got a pizza with sausage and peppers. First of all, we didn't receive our food for 70 minutes after we were sat. It was horrible. And it wasn't busy at all, there was no excuse. \\n\\nWhen our food finally came, I was horrified at my \\"grilled portabella\\". This thing must have been about 2000 calories. It was served on a huge sub roll. The portabella was sliced up and for sure not grilled, it must have been steamed or something. Then, it was DRENCHED in a thick, bottled teriyaki sauce, and then drowned in some sort of honey mustard dressing. I was so grossed out. I picked at the portabella, realized it was awful, and then put it aside and tried the onion rings. I'm a huge onion ring fan, and these were probably the most bland onion rings I've ever tried. \\n\\nThe \\"grilled\\" veggie pockets had also never seen a grill. The veggies in some cases were raw (squash mostly) or very slightly steamed, on a non-grilled pocket. We asked the waitress why it wasn't grilled, and sent it back. It came back out virtually untouched. We told her it looked steamed and she said something like \\"yeah, it's probably steamed\\". Not the same as grilled. \\n\\nHubby was overall ok with his pizza, though the peppers on the pizza came out chopped with large stems on. I'll be posting pictures of all of our meals soon. We will not be going back, and I don't recommend Seaport Cafe at all anymore.

We now live in Buda, but I work at Parmer Ln occasionally and went there today for my usual choice of either Lemon Pepper shrimp or the Shakin Steak bowl. As I walk in I notice right away that the decor has changed and that the usual staff was no longer there. I asked the woman at the counter about the new management and she confirmed the change.\\n\\nI ordered the cashew chicken as I was afraid to order my usual special with a whole new staff and kitchen crew. The food came out and was your typical run of the mill fast food Chinese. It tasted nothing like previous Food Shui dishes where you would get a  dish that tasted more like an upscale Chinese restaurant than fast food. \\n\\nI know it's a minor item but just the difference of going from the heavy duty reusable plastic containers to the cheap and flimsy Styrofoam containers makes a difference in the dining experience.\\n\\nI am very sad to see that the previous owners of Food Shui have moved on. The good food and atmosphere has moved on with them. The new owners should change the name as not to confuse loyal customers like myself into thinking the food is the same.\\n\\nI am not sure where I will get my fix for the Lemon Pepper shrimp and the Shakin Steak bowl now. The family's other restaurant at the Lakeline Mall called Dragonfly is also closed now."},{"name":"Felipe's Taqueria","address":"83 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This food IS NOT MEXICAN FOOD, but Tex-Mex food (believe me), i.e. recipes created by Chicanos in Texas, not by Mexicans living in Mexico.

The menu is simple, with about 25 or so items ranging from grilled cheeses, burgers, vegan options, along with a few salads & sides.  After placing my order, I was handed a placard to put on my table.

The only thing that I am reviewing are the two carne asada burritos that I ordered (it's all I ever order). They cost $6 each. Burritos with other traditional pre-cooked meats cost $5 each. I read somewhere else that this place made 1-1/2 pound burritos. I didn't have a scale with me, but I have to say, it was a big honker - easily over a pound.\\n\\nUnlike some burrito joints that load up on beans and rice and skimp on the meat, this place does the opposite. It was almost ALL MEAT! There was so much meat in this thing that it left me actually wishing I could trade some of it for more rice and beans!\\n\\nIf your looking for a burrito with maximum bulk value, this place is it. They packed so much flank steak in these things that there's no way you could make it yourself for cheaper.\\n\\nOK, now that I've got the quantitative review out of the way, let's move on to the qualitative part. The tortilla was obviously fresh. They threw it on the grill for a minute before assembling my burrito so it had a nice toasty exterior but was still tender in the middle. I didn't ask, but it must have been made with lard. Tortillas just don't taste this good unless they were made with real lard. The bad thing is that they only use 12-14\\" tortillas. They pack SOOOO much stuff in them that even the best \\"peel and eat\\" foil-wrapped burrito master cannot help but make a mess. Even I dropped three or four tasty morsels on my plate. Oh, the humanity!\\n\\nThe carne asada was pre-made, but grilled to order so it was nice and sizzling hot. It had great flavor - not too salty, but definitely marinated. Some things I noticed about the carne asada:\\n\\n1.   They could have done a better job trimming the fat.\\n2.   Fat is tolerable if the steak is chopped up small enough. They did not chop it small enough. I just picked out the fatty chunks and threw them away. I didn't mind too much since there was an overabundance of meat anyway.\\n3.   The onions were not carefully prepared. There were several pieces of onion skin and some of the hard stemmy parts in there.\\n\\nI cannot comment too much on the rice and beans since they were overpowered by the meat. Mmmm, meat. It is worth noting that they offer both pinto and black refried beans. Didn't notice any whole beans, so I didn't ask for any.\\n\\nThey have a pretty big selection of salsas. I only tried two and they were awesome. The orange haba√±ero salsa was really flavorful, but not as hot as I expected. Fine by me. It allowed me to really pour it on!

Being quite familiar with the Boston location, I was looking forward to try out this new location.  It is located near some major thoroughfares, so getting there was pretty easy.  Shortly after the exit, I caught sight of the building, kitschy pagoda architecture and all.  The parking lot was comically inefficient in layout design and egress, but I digress.\\n\\nI never know with Chinese food places if the interior design is over the top.  How does one discern between tacky and tasteful when everything seems a little over the top, but might have cultural relevance?  I think I wanted more of a Last Emperor, and less Enter the Dragon, but to each their own I guess.  I wasn't there for sight seeing anyway.  Bring on the dumplings.  \\n\\nI was pretty hungry, so I really didn't even register the first few things I ate.  It wasn't until the initial frantic face stuffing slowed down that I started to notice the subtle differences.  First of all, 1pm is not the right time for Dim Sum.  The best Dim Sum I've ever had was at 9:40am.  The food is just fresher the earlier you go.  Not exactly the case here.  While everything tasted ok, you could tell that a few dishes may have made the rounds a few times already.  It would be pretty stupid to list out each dish and what I thought, so suffice to say that it was a predictable Dim Sum experience.  Nothing was exceptional either way, save for the Chinese broccoli which was cooked to a noticeably bitter point.  On the plus side, the selection was pretty wide considering it was 1pm.  I didn't get my fried taro, but just about everything I wanted was available. \\n\\nI will say that the wait staff was pretty attentive, particularly the cart women.  It was bordering on pushy, but with smiles.  I felt like I was walking through a seedy neighborhood, and pimps and drug dealers were going for the hard sell.  I kept on thinking \\"word up, two for fives over here baby.\\"  Overall, it was nice having so many carts come by, so the wait staff gets a thumbs up.  However, I did have one waiter ask us what we wanted for drinks, but he never returned.  I like to imagine that he went on some sort of vision quest, where he decides he wants to be something more than an average Dim Sum waiter and sets his sights on a prize that many don't think he can win.........wait...what was I talking about?\\n\\nAnyway, I will give this place a solid 3 stars.  Food was good, just not spectacular.  I also liked how the bathroom was on the cleaner side when I went to wash my hands.  I will have to come back again earlier to possibly upgrade that rating."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here with some expectation, both good and bad, and came out with both, but mostly good. The layout is nothing fancy, reminds me a little bit like Tasty Burger's layout down the street. A good choice of beers and cocktails, didn't hear of any disappointments from my group. The BBQ trays are $20's-low $30's. The meat comes out on a tray with the sides. Having friends who share, I had a good sample of meats they offer, I only missed out on the ribs. The pork belly was meaty, not fatty, and moist. The brisket also moist and tasty. I had the buttermilk fried chicken which was moist with a nice flaky batter. It was even better as leftovers! I only found the chicken bits to be tasteless. They do have three BBQ sauces you can choose from, so you can always add what you like. My sides of collard greens with pork and mac n' cheese were both so good. In agreement with everyone else that you need to get the biscuits. They are big, flaky, and moist!

The Mrs. ordered a steak and mushroom dish and it had a sweet maple flavor to the steak, WTF?! Who the hell puts marinates maple flavor into steak and mushroom with onions? So she had it sent back and ordered sausages which took another 10 min. to get. Meanwhile my omelet was tolerable but they skimped on any veggies that were supposed to be in there. Bacon was about the most pathetic bacon i'd ever seen in my life and the toast cold and rock hard. I sent the toast back for it to never return.

I had noticed the Five Guys Burgers & Fries location on Guadalupe some time back, but wasn't familiar with it, and the name just didn't \\"speak Burger\\" to me. I wasn't sure what to make of them, and after all, there seem to be enough different burger joints to go around. Who needs another one? But curiosity (and a recommendation from a friend) got the better of me, and recently I happened to be \\"in the area\\", so I decided to check out Five Guys.\\n\\nFive Guys employs a business model more companies should employ, ESPECIALLY the airline industry. I'd call Five Guys the \\"Southwest Airlines\\" of the Fast Food business. Of course, I'll explain what I mean.\\n\\nBut not before touching on SW Air, since there are similarities. Between an Airline and a Burger Company?\\n\\nSW Air is possibly the most successful airline in history, and I tip my hat to its founder, one Mr. Herb Kelleher. They were perhaps the ONLY airline NOT crying for a Government \\"bailout\\" after 9/11, and MADE A PROFIT every quarter after the tragic event. They were possibly the only airline to do so.\\n\\nThey're cheap, actually the cheapest; everyone knows that (and one way Five Guys is NOT similar to SW Air). They also have one of the best \\"on time\\" records, and one of the best safety records.\\n\\nUnlike EVERY OTHER airline in the business, SW Air flies only ONE type of aircraft: The Boeing 737. Why is that significant? Well, with only one type of plane, they need to only inventory PARTS for one type of plane. Their MECHANICS only have to know how to work on one type of plane. Their PILOTS only have to be able to fly one type of plane. THAT'S why they can undercut their competition, cuz they don't have a dozen different type of aircraft to deal with, and THAT translates into not only lower costs, but a more streamlined business model in TOTAL.\\n\\nBut that's a complicated answer there, there's GOT to be a simpler way to put it than THAT. And what would \\"that\\" be?\\n\\nIt's called: SIMPLICITY, stoopid!\\n\\nFive Guys is basically the Burger equivalent of SW Air, and they remind me of the old SNL sketch with John Belushi as the immigrant Burger Joint Owner. You know: \\"No Hamburger, Chee-burger!\\" \\"No French Fries, chips!\\" \\"No Coke, Pepsi!\\" \\n\\nOK, maybe Five Guys isn't so similar to that after all, mean, it's no Pepsi there, just Coke (and OK, a few other flavors of drinks).\\n\\nBut the rest of the menu? It goes like this:\\nBurger\\n\\nHot Dog\\n\\nFrench Fries\\n\\nThat's IT. \\n\\nOther than that, you can add cheese, bacon, onions, mushrooms, mayo, ketchup, mustard, A-1, and quite a few other condiments, but they all go on either a BURGER or a HOT DOG. It might just be \\"flippin' burgers\\", as we like to say, but every time you add a menu item, it's one more thing you can run out of (like Strange Brew is ALWAYS out of lemons), and one more thing you have to \\"train\\" your staff to cook. \\n\\nShort Stop started like that, but then branched out into other items. They're still around, but have fewer stores than before, & I don't like their burger as much as the \\"original\\". So much for \\"branching out\\".\\n\\nSorry, we're done with \\"Business 101\\" for today, but it's pertinent as to WHY they make such a GREAT BURGER.\\n\\nFive Guys' business model translates into a GREAT BURGER, and for a franchisee, EASE OF OPERATION. It also makes Five Guys the FASTEST GROWING burger chain in the nation.\\n\\nThe \\"standard\\" burger is a Double-Patty, half-pound mountain of meat! If you want something smaller, you have to ASK for it. And the burgers are mighty TASTY, if ya ask me.\\n\\nAnd the FRIES? I don't know, this is a very subjective sort of thing. But I couldn't stop EATING THEM! Again, the \\"standard\\" fry size is (I think, I'm going from memory here, and ya know how THAT goes) a \\"regular\\". They say the \\"large\\" will feed two people? I say the \\"regular\\" will. Trust me, if it's just YOU, get the small. And I'd suggest the Cajun Seasoning. I don't know if it's a proprietary mix, but it's damn GOOD!\\n\\n Now for the \\"down side\\": They're NOT CHEAP. But then, they know it, and are trying to take up what has now become the \\"middle ground\\" between the \\"Boutique\\" burger \\"Parlours\\" and \\"DacaMo\\" (my little pet name for McD's). There is NO value menu.\\n\\nThen there's the fact that their burgers are rated as some of the most \\"unhealthy\\" burgers around. Again, they know it. And WE know it, when we chow down on a great, greasy, over-size piece o' COW. Hey, put some SPROUTS on it, that'll make it more \\"healthy\\"!\\n\\nBottom line: Five Guys Burgers & Fries make a really good burger. I'd eat there again. But as I've said when reviewing some other burger joints, as good as they are (and they ARE), I still have my own personal Favorites, and those would win out in an all-out contest. But if I'm \\"in the area\\" and Five Guys is close by, I know I'm gonna get a VERY GOOD burger, even if I do pay a lil' more for it than I'd pay with the \\"other guys\\".\\n\\n\\nlarrythediner\\n\\n\\n."},{"name":"Full English","address":"2000 Southern Oaks Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Really good food but somewhat limited on choices.

Today I asked for a small container for the side of chips and extra containers for the salsa and the lady got very mad and shook her head and gave me a container with no lid. I realized she wasn't going to give me any containers for the salsa so I went ahead and bought a huge container of it even though their is no way that I will eat all of it and it will go to waste.

The restaurant is about a 45 min. trip for us - esp. due to traffic in this area. We forgot about the Groupon, and the expiration date passed. With a Groupon - you'll never lose the value you paid for it - thus the Groupon is always  worth that amount. It said to make reservations on the Groupon - so we did - my wife explained the Groupon expired - the hostess replied \\"no problem - it's still worth the value you paid\\". We did not expect anything different.\\nWe arrived - got seated - The waitress showed up shortly after - my wife stated that we had a Groupon, and before she finished - the waitress cut her off - and stated \\" Oh Yeah, We all know how that works, it's worth $30-.\\" As my wife attemped to tell her it was expired and only worth half the value - The waitress spoke over her - now with the Groupon in her hands - and opened it to full page - placed it on the opposite side of the table from us - face up - and said \\"Just leave this right here.\\"\\nThen she took our drink order.\\nI have no idea why a Groupon has to be displayed face up on the table while you are dining - in a \\"theoretical romantic setting.\\" \\nShortly thereafter the waitress returned with a basket of bread and an olive oil dipping sauce. She explained it would be a little while on the drinks - due to my wife ordering a Sangria - it had to be made fresh.\\nI held off on the bread - due to not having a drink with it - water was never offered - and not realizing there would be a wait for a Sangria and a bottle of beer - i did not bother to ask.\\nFinally - she returned with a Blue Moon and a Sangria - took our orders, and disappeared.\\nWe both ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana - and I ordered a house salad - the dressings were very limited so I agreed to a House dressing - and the waitress said \\"When I bring it out, you can try it, if you don't like it, we'll get ya something else, it's on the side.\\"\\nIt took quite sometime - but the salad finally arrived. The waitress was gone. The place started to get in more customers - I'd say about 10 tables total - and you could tell they were regulars - because the waitresses were speaking to them on a first name basis.\\nService went downhill - dressing was not very good - beer was empty - waitress was busy refilling regular's drinks.\\nEventually entree's arrive - my wife asks for a glass of water - waitress is gone before I can ask for a beer - waitress returns - I ask for a beer - she didn't look the happiest.\\nPlates of food \\"LOOK GOOD\\" - we begin eating - due to the amount of marina sauce and cheese covering the eggplant - the first couple of bites were tasting O.K. - as I continue to eat - developing a funny taste. I ask my wife her opinion about hers - she says it's not the best, but edible.\\nMy guess - frozen food - bad, unchanged oil..??? Hopefully not leftovers from prior night.\\nMy wife gets the remainder of hers to go - I pretty much finished my plate.\\nWe order Tiramasu for dessert - actually pretty good.\\nWe get our check - look it over - the waitress takes the Groupon that has been nicely displayed on our table for the last 1-1/2 hrs along with our debit card and returns the quickest she has of the night.

I will give them credit, the mac and cheese was outstanding despite the fact that it was served in the most infuriating container available.  I will also admit that the service was good.  \\n\\nOverall, Sweet cheeks has a few things going for it, but the food quality suffers because it seems like they care more about cultivating a cutesy atmosphere than actually cooking good bbq.  High quality bbq sells itself--you don't need to dress it up in some misguided fancy northern interpretation of what a southern restaurant is like.  Some of the best bbq joints in the nation serve their food in styrofoam cartons because it speaks for itself, which unfortunately is not the case for Sweet Cheeks."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"9840 NE Cascades Pkwy","city":"PORTLAND","stars":"2","text":"This place is open 24 hours and was the only place open during a crazy snowstorm, glad they were!

Sheared among 4 people.  Fish was fresh.  some stringy tendon in the tuna.  Some of the smaller rolls were breaking apart a little.  the uni had a hint of alcohol like taste which i didn't like.

Uchi had some nice flavor combinations, I also like Yu sushi and Origami wasn't bad.  I'm not a fan of having sushi chefs who didn't train in Japan make my sushi and when half the sushi \\"chefs\\" are hispanic, that raises questions. (same thing at Mikado)  At least at Yu sushi one of the Asian chefs is Japanese and at Origami, I believe the sushi chef/owner is half Japanese and spent time in Japan.\\n\\nNot to be a snob but in japan you have to go through years of training to become a real sushi chef and it's not something you can just teach someone without a background in the cuisine or the palate to appreciate the subtle nuance of the flavors.  i'm not saying non-Japanese people can't make sushi but it almost borders on fraud when you have other Asian ethnicities and Hispanic people masquerading as Japanese by shouting out \\"irashaimase\\" and singing japanese birthday songs in their broken Japanese.  It's like they assume that regular Americans just won't know the difference.\\n\\nSo not as pricey as Uchi, fresh sashimi (low risk of getting sick here), good selection of rolls, some innovative appetizers with good flavor, good presentation.  As a Japanese person, I don't like it when other ethnicities pretend to be Japanese - it's like when I went to go watch madame butterfly played by a white woman wearing a yukata as a kimono and closing and tying the front the way a man would in Japan.

I went the day before Thanksgiving in the afternoon for lunch with a friend. It was pretty empty -- the bar was pretty much ours...which is just how I like it. \\n\\nAfter warming up with a refreshing hard cider...I ordered the pork ribs, she had the brisket. Both were great. Super smoky taste -- the ribs were a beautiful pink color -- they came off the bone, but didn't fall apart in your mouth...allowing you to chew into that smoky flesh and really taste the love and time that went into serving them to you. \\n\\nThe brisket was equally smoky and delicious. The meat was so smoky-flavor-good that you didn't need to add bbq sauce to enjoy it. It stood strong as it was. Naked and smoky. And good thing the meat could stand on it's own four piggy legs -- cause the bbq sauce wasn't anything great. It's the reason for a three-star rating versus a four-star -- which I really wanted to give this place four stars. The hot wasn't hot enough, the regular wasn't flavorful enough, but mix the two and it was an ok addition to perfectly bbq'd meat. \\n\\nThe sides were solid. Farm salad was amazing -- fresh and delicious, a great contrast the the heavy beans and meat on the other half of the tray! \\n\\nThe whiskey selection is top notch -- and you can't beat the beer list. Also, the country music makes me happy. \\n\\nCongrats to Tiffany Faison on opening a great bbq joint in Boston. And thanks for taking time to meet and greet the patrons at the bar.

I'm going to be 100% honest here because that's just the kind of Yelper I am. \\n\\nA group of One Brick Orlando volunteers helped out at Relay for Life last night and decided to celebrate our fantastic work by stopping downtown for drinks. While the plan was to go to Wall St., we were looking for a spot with less chaos than the craziness of the Styx? Eddie Money? fundraising event going on and wandered over to Brix.\\n\\nAmbiance: If you like to people watch, Brix is a great spot. Grab a corner table inside the window, as it's much easier to make fun of drunk passersby when they're not puking next to your table by 10pm (true story). You also have quite a diverse cross-section of bars nearby so you'll see a variety of girls that don't work at Mako's but look like they're on the way to a shift, wannabe rap stars, punk rockers, and preppy frat brats. \\n\\nCrowd: I don't know if we scared everyone off, or Brix was just a pre-drink spot on the way to hit the more hardcore bars, but the place was pretty empty. By 11pm we were the only group left in the bar. Even when we walked in, there were maybe 10 other customers at a time tops. \\n\\nDrinks: Meh. I tried one of their $4 ladies night specials. It was supposed to be 'twisted tea' but they ran out of fresh mint, and apparently, vodka and tea. It tasted like a very watered down can of Arizona, and that's pretty bad coming from me. The stronger the drink, the more sugary the mixers necessary. I switched to a (proud moment for our Yelp Community Manager) cider 1/2 way through the first drink, but see below to find out why I didn't bother finishing it. \\n\\nService: I get it- it's not the most fun activity working in an empty bar or restaurant. And hey, it's fun to flirt with the DJ. When your only customers order a round of drinks and some food, though, I mean...the flirting can wait. There's no reason to have to ask for a drink 3x's before you get it when you're the only 5 guests in a bar. There's also no reason to wait an hour for a 'pizza.' \\n\\nThat being said, the waitress was very nice. She also went out of her way to make up for the service itself with some drink specials reflected on our tab, but I promise, I'm still tipping for the service I get, not the price of the drinks. It definitely helped getting a hookup, especially for this review. I gave Brix an extra star for the attempt to redeem the service, but that still only earned it 2 stars in my book.\\n\\nFood: We ordered 'buffalo chicken pizza'- which was made of a tortilla (not kidding), chicken fingers from Publix, and some hot sauce. It was supposed to be the best pizza they had, and any bar serving food after 6pm on a weekend is a strike of luck. I tried to give them credit for even having food, really, I did. But on a tortilla? Ew. That's a flat burrito, not a pizza. With the long wait, I thought maybe they were making the dough from scratch- hahahahaha I'm so silly. \\n\\nI'm always willing to give second chances, but it's going to take a lot to redeem Brix for me. I'll let you know if my experience improves or gets worse next go around.

The potatoes (especially the sauce) was amazing. Chicken and salmon were both hits as well.

Our waitress seemed new and overwhelmed. We were there for 2.5 hours late on a Friday from the time we sat down to the time we got our check.

We've been to sushi places all over the U.S. (NYC, SF, LA, San Jose, Las Vegas (don't laugh)).  We have also spoken to many other Musashino diners who have also had sushi all over the world.  Musashino ranks up there with the very very best.\\n\\nI love Musashino not just for the quality of the sushi/sashimi, but also because the owner/chef, Smokey-san, tries to incorporate good elements of every cuisine into the menu, while managing to not stray too far from traditional sushi.\\n\\nThe newest rolls are proof of that.  The Texas Hybrid roll borrows from both Vietnamese cuisine (rice paper wrapping) as well as Argentine cuisine's chimichurri (garlic and cilantro sauce).  The new \\"South Sider\\" roll shows Mexican influence.  The South Sider is our current fav roll:  sweet, spicy (with habanero tobiko (flying fish roe) and jalapeno), mint, and cilantro.  It was invented by Julian (pronounced who-lien :-), a South Sider himself.  And have you tried the desserts, particularly the tiramisu?  Tiramisu in a sushi place?!!!  Yup!  You should try it before passing judgment on it.\\n\\nFinally, some people think Musashino's interior is \\"cheesy\\".  Personally, I love it.  I detest, for example, P.F. Chang's yuppie, more-money- than-taste interior.\\n\\nAndrew N.:  sorry, man, I think anybody who thinks Osaka has good sushi cannot be trusted!  :)\\n\\nEJL:  you tasted vinegar in the sushi rice because, well, sushi rice has vinegar in it!  Don't take my word for it.  Google or wikipedia it.\\n\\nEJL & Allison B.:  it may interest you to know that Tyson Cole of Uchi apprenticed under Musashino's Smokey-san for seven years.  (In fact, when we started coming to Musashino in the spring of 1996, Tyson hasn't even started working there yet!)  That does not mean that one should prefer Musashino over Uchi of course, but people need to know that in comparing sushi quality between the two places.  Musashino is a top-notch sushi joint, as is Uchi."},{"name":"Harry Buffalo","address":"6150 South Sunbury Rd","city":"Westerville","stars":"3.5","text":"The remodeled dining room/sports bar is an upgrade from Gordys, but the service has been inconsistent.

By no means does this taste like cheese, but I was pleased with this dish and I loved the addition of kale with this. Now the not so good - I had high hopes for the pasta salad. I didn't really get a good handle on the flavors because the bulk of the dish (the pasta) was really dry and hard. I like my pasta al dente, but there was no chew to this gf pasta at all... It tasted dry and undercooked. Definitely just ate the raw veggies and left the pasta to be thrown out. For $10, I would skip the pasta.

He agreed and so I went went forth and found a great place for us to dine. To my dismay he told me,  \\" unfortunately I cannot cancel our reservation at the Rio Brazilian steakhouse because if do, they will charge my CC $300.00\\". I approached the manager in regards to this, and in the end  she told me that what I'm saying is lie and that we could have cancelled at any time.

Yes, they came late but no matter what your GPS'S ETA says, it cannot always count for the red lights you hit and other variables driving in a big city on a Saturday night brings.

The manager denied they came late even though I described the appearance of the tardy guests and how long after the first set of people from that party arrived. \\n\\nCon: Half of us ate the meat option and the other half of us opted for the salad bar. Due to the incompetence of our \\"server\\" she charged all of us the meat option. Of course nobody is willing to pay for something they didn't get so naturally, we disputed the bill. In the end, the server and manager cursed at two of my co workers and said to \\"get the F out\\". \\n\\nCon: Again, after reading the reviews, I did not want to put myself or my soon to be born baby at risk for contamination, so I opted for the salad bar. For $27.00, I would have preferred to shop the Safeway deli section or make it myself. The kale was not cut into bite size pieces, the beets were not a beautiful red but a faded red going pink, the artichokes were bitter, the coleslaw was a absolutely basic and drenched in mayo, the olives were small and ones you could buy at Safeway and my co workers spat out the Kalamata and shrimp. \\n\\nTo conclude, this place is an embarrassment to the Tourism and  Food/ Service industry of Vancouver and may also be a shame to the Brazilian community. \\n\\nI urge locals and visitors alike to explore our amazing local, West Coast inspired and sustainable restaurants."},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Great breakfast, brunch, Middle Eastern and French dishes!

Because our group was large (approximately 20 people), we were seated in a private room that is off the kitchen. Although that may seem odd, it was actually a very cute room with it's own private patio (for the smokers in the group). The room fit us comfortably, the only problem was the acoustics. It was so loud in there with everyone talking that it actually kind of hurt mine and my boyfriends ears. The rest of the restaurant had a very nice atmosphere in both looks and feeling, replete with a great outdoor seating area. The whole place reminded me of something out of a 1950s chic movie...it was pretty cool.\\n\\nThe menu was pretty extensive, and they had a small clipping attached with the specials. The server told us that everything is basically served family style, i.e. set out for everyone to enjoy, but the portions are small. Although I wasn't too happy about this (sharing small plates with 20 people then trying to figure out the bill is not an easy thing), it ended up being much simpler than initially thought. While we did share food, the server was good about giving each plate to the person who ordered it.\\n\\nPrices are high here, but we knew that going into it. The plates all looked delicious when they were served. My boyfriend and I started with the Frita Mista salad (fried seafood, basically). It looked delicious and was a generous portion, unfortunately it was COVERED in salt. It tasted like the chef dumped the salt shaker on top once it was finished cooking. The salt was definitely not mixed in with the batter as you could see individual grains resting on the plate. In spite of this, we ate the food and luckily the pieces on the bottom were saved from the salt bath.\\n\\nFor our meals, I ordered the gnocchi special and my boyfriend ordered a salad with chicken (the chicken was extra and literally cost as much as the salad). His was good, but it's hard to mess up chicken salad. Mine was ok. The gnocchi, homemade I might add, came out in a row of 6 or 7 pieces on a rectangular plate. I must say that I've never seen gnocchi served this way before, but ok, we were at a hip restaurant so I figured, what the hell. Unfortunately it was completely bland. Literally just tasted like dough. I was disappointed, mostly for the price we were paying for it. \\n\\nWe were able to try some of the things our friends ordered, including sauteed peppers (which were actually quite delicious), the watermelon mozzarella concoction (which was spicy but good), and the meatballs (which were also bland and not very flavorful). Another friend ordered a seafood (clam, I think) pasta for dinner and it was also just ok. \\n\\nI will say that one of our friends ordered a couple of desserts and passed them around and they were quite delicious. The cheesecake and a peanut butter chocolate something. \\n\\nAll in all, the experience and ambiance were really great, but the food was not worth the $75 bill that we had.

Sure, why the hell not.\\n\\nIn some sense it surprises me that the mix-and-match, assembly line pasta concept hadn't landed at a strip mall near you before now. Sure, Noodles & Co has existed as a similar quick serve noodle/pasta business for a while, but it doesn't offer as much ability to customize. Piada has so similar a feel to the Chipotle process that it's almost surprising Piada hasn't gotten sued. Then again, there are other faux Chipotles, including a Mediterranean Chipotle (Cava Mezze Grill) in my home town of Bethesda, MD. So perhaps this sort of restaurant layout isn't quite patentable.\\n\\nYou know the drill by now, if not from this restaurant than from its Mexican companion. The real question I had walking into Piada for the first time was whether the pasta bowl or piada would impress me more. My first pasta bowl attempts were tasty but perhaps unexceptional. The pomodoro sauce is a decent standby and offers good flavor, the diavolo enough heat to put a touch of sweat on your brow. The same cannot be said of the hot peppers that accompany the tender calamari; deigning to call these hot deeply insults peppers which actually contain capsacin.\\n\\nTo me, the piada is a much more interesting concept and is what would keep me coming back to the restaurant. My combination of Italian sausage/pasta/basil pesto/feta and fresh tomato, spinach and onion came together to form a deeply flavored but hyper oily mixture. Near the bottom of the burrito-I-mean-piada, I turned the wrap on its side to drain. A half tablespoon of basil-infused oil had dripped out before long, and even after reading a full page of my book, the flow was still going at a droplet every couple seconds.\\n\\nThe more I think about it, the more I get the feeling I'm going to find some unique combination of piada-packing ingredients that will thrill me and cause a new obsession. Grilled chicken/pasta/diavolo/feta, I hear you calling my number.\\n\\nThere's a guy who used to work at the Dublin Chipotle who up and disappeared a few months back. On my second trip to Piada, who do I see at a rear cooking stand? Same guy, now preparing Italian grub.\\n\\nHuh.

So we made a reservation for our anniversary, which is Valentine's Day. I was so excited!! To be fair, I am familiar with truly authentic Scottish food, and perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, so I will start with the things I liked about the place first.\\nIt is a very cozy little place and the staff is generally very friendly and most of what we ordered was very good. The little oat cakes and butter that greeted us were delicious and unusual for Americans. We ordered two drinks and two appetizers. The sazerac was unusual because of the restrictions in their liquor license, so for my second drink I ordered a Bobbi Burns, since he is an ancestor. That was yummy and my husband's beers were very good - where else can you get a beer list with 50 Scottish beers?? The cullen skink soup was fantastic, as was the Scotch egg although neither was quite hot enough, but not enough to send back for a warm up. \\nMy husband ordered one of the Valentine's Day specials, pork shank, with a crazy good grain mixture that only the Scotts could invent and broccoli rabe, also very good. He was totally satisfied. Then on to me... of course I grilled the waiter regarding the haggis before ordering. Turns out they make it on site so, since the restaurant is run by a Scott, I figured it was safe to give it a try. Unfortunately, while it looked beautiful in presentation, it was not hot when it came to the table. I sent it back for a re-heat but never had a single apology and it took so long that my husband was already done with half his meal by the time it returned. The neeps and tatties were delicious but the haggis suffered from the same problem that all American-made haggis has. Because many of the ingredients involved in making a proper haggis are illegal in the States, they invariably have too much liver in them and taste too much like it. In addition, the plate has two small haggis on it and each was quite different from the other!! I mentioned this to our waiter but he seemed more interested in proving me wrong than making me a happy diner. In fact, I had the distinct feeling that he was tired of hearing from me and, believe me, I was not an unreasonable customer. However, it was the maitre-d who served our dessert so maybe he was trying to address my concerns with good customer service. We ordered the 99 to share since it conjures up memories of summer vacations in Pittenweem, on the east coast of Scotland. It was pretty perfect. However, I was a bit disappointed that no one ever apologized for the meal's shortcomings and no one seemed to care that I was a true Scot and that it was our anniversary. I found that a bit odd and certainly not very charming.\\nI would still go back, I would never order the haggis again, and I am dying to try their brunch since there is nowhere else in the area which serves a proper Scottish breakfast!!"},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Lots to choose from, surprisingly generous portions for a tapas place and generally pretty good.\\n\\nWhenever a friend suggests getting tapas my reaction is to grudgingly acquiesce and look up the nearest McDonald's I can hit up post-tapas para Cenu Numero Dos.   Tweet this: Despite our valiant efforts, we had leftovers to take home (which we forgot at the restaurant, but that's neither here nor there)!  Okay, time to dive right in:\\nI love sangria and Tasca's sangria went down like juice... although maybe that's just what it was because half a pitcher later I still couldn't feel the pleasant lightheadedness I was striving to achieve. So it goes.  Between the two of us Rhea and I split 7 tapas.  Okay okay, so maybe we went a little overboard but I wanted to make sure we had enough food!  Girl's gotta eat!  First up, the Pincho de pollo y chorizo was one of my favorites.  While I can appreciate twists and turns in my food there's a higher probability I'll like it if the food matches the menu description because I ordered it for a reason, right? The pincho was exactly the way I wanted it to taste in a not-too-chili, sweet chili sauce.  The chorizo was very flavorful and complemented the chicken well.  The Croquettas de pollo, basically, mozzarella sticks filled with chicken instead of cheese,  was my least favorite.  This dish had so much potential but the most predominant flavor here was \\"fried,\\"  (sadly the word \\"fried\\" is used more and more to describe a flavor instead of a cooking technique).  The empanadas with goat cheese were definitely skimpy on the goat cheese but still so freakin' delicious.  The leek quiche with smoked cheddar and manchego cheese had a very smoky flavor, with the right consistency.  The Salchicha de cordero consisted of two thin lamb sausages underneath a mound of yummy Isreali couscous, with the flavorful sausage cooked just the right amount.  The brie with apple and raisin chutney served with buttered toast was OK.  The brie was amazing but the apple and raisin chutney didn't taste very fresh, like it'd been bottled up for a while and just exposed to the air.  Finally the calamari  was pretty standard, hard to mess up calamari, and I didn't get to try much of this because I was so darn full at this point.  \\n\\nGo to Tasca in a group of more than two because the tables for two are all positioned awkwardly all over the dining floor.  It's like they fit as many tables of four or more in the space as they could and filled the crevices with uncomfortably shaped tables for two in the way of the waitstaff.  The waitstaff and especially  the owner of the restaurant were all really nice.  Steeped in conversation and oblivious to how busy the restaurant really was, Rhea and I stuck around for about another hour after our meal, at which point the owner kindly asked us to move and offered to top off our sangria for the \\"inconvenience\\" of moving one table over.  Heck, I'll move from table to table if I get a drink with it every time!  Altogether I think our bill came out to ~$75, ridiculously cheap for how much food was on the table.  On weekends Tasca gives you the option of entrees which I can't vouch for but just know that it is an option.  If I could change one thing about Tasca it would be the consistency in the quality of their food.  Check this place out, right off the green line at Washington Street - literally right where you get dropped off.

His Dolly-something drink was incredible, and I was jealously stealing sips through our meal. \\n\\n I went \\"light\\" and ordered pulled pork on Texas toast.

The sauces are extraordinary, especially the spicy BBQ.  I appreciate that not everything is slathered in sauce, and you can add lacquer as you please.  The guy got the Fat Cheeks (choice of 3 meats) and while it was one of the more pricy menu items the amount of food was ample.  He really enjoyed the pulled chicken and the ribs, and while he also rather enjoyed the brisket he thought it would have used a bit more seasoning.

They have an attention to detail that definitely comes through in their flavors and seems to have extra level of complexity that will subtly elevate each dish to make your taste buds happy you decided to eat here.\\n\\nDessert here is not to be missed! That same attention and care throughout the rest of the restaurant is expressed here so expertly. I'm usually not a dessert person, but I will always save room for it here. And I usually end up with more than one because they are done so well.\\n\\nOne time, I let them know one of us was paleo, and a year later during an anniversary, without a reminder, we sat down to a menu with paleo options marked along with a card signed by their employees.

That's what Sazon is supposed to be.  It's not the fanciest place you'll find and the parking lot is pretty horrific but you get the standard chips and salsa as soon as you are seated.  The Salsa is pretty standard and standard really doesn't cut it in Austin.  I ordered the Carnitas Michoac√°n.  Okay, I love carnitas and I've had them in plenty of places in plenty of cities, in the US and in Mexico. This wasn't my first carnita rodeo, I'm in the Union. I was disappointed.  Yes, the serving was large and the tortillas were good but the pork itself wasn't fried particularly well, and they were also lacking in zip (flavor/spices)  Basically they were just soggy hunks of fried pork.  And everywhere else that I have ordered Carnitas they have always come with their own special salsa.  Not at Sazon, I had to just use the plain salsa and that really doesn't cut the mustard, especially as the regular salsa, well, it may not have been made in New York City but I kind of got the feeling that it wasn't made in Texas or Mexico either.  My carnitas came with sides of refried beans and rice and again both were lacking that little kick to raise them above what you get at a place like Taco Bell.  If you're looking for authentic Michoac√°n you'll have to do what I'm doing in Austin and continue looking.

It was around 8:00pm on a Friday night and the three of us (my sister, cousin and myself) wanted to get something to eat pretty close. My sister went on yelp to find out what was around my cousins apartment. Tasca came up so,  I called to find out how long the wait would be for the three of us. 45 Minutes and you have to be here for me to put your name on the list... ahh.. okay, so we all decide to walk up the hill. By the time we got there, the wait changed to 1hour and 15 min. AHHhhhh, seriously? Okay, lets just put our name in.. we decide to walk around to find somewhere else to eat. We walked like a half a mile away and found a couple of places that were equally as crowded. So we made the hike back grabbed some $5.00 sangria's and only had to wait another 10 min (40 min total, so not  bad) \\n\\nBy the time we got seated the three of us were pretty hungry. So here is the breakdown of the food:\\n\\nPortabella Mushrooms: From reading the menu we didn't realize that this was a salad, but it was and it was delicious. Served w/ a perfect compliment red bell peppers toast. \\n\\nSizzling Garlic shrimp: As we were waiting for our food to come out we noticed almost all the tables were ordering this dish. So we did too. It pretty much is just that... butter, garlic, and shrimp served in a skillet.  It was good, but not the best dish we had. I would opt to try something else. next time. \\n\\nCouscous w/ Veggies: We wanted to make sure we had something somewhat healthy and not soaked in some type of fat. So we opted for the couscous. Which is made w/ large couscous. It was pretty good. Nothing we had was bad. \\n\\nShort Ribs: Which was more like a beef stew. Short ribs is probably one of my favorite cuts of beef. If you like meat and potatoes you'll like this dish. \\n\\nGrilled Brie with baked apple chutney: If you like bre, you'll love GRILLED brie. It's a pretty good simple appetizer. \\n\\nDuck confit w/ red cabbage slaw: Was the star of the night. It came out and when we cut into it steamed started coming out of the leg. It was moist and eating it w/ the slaw created the perfect bite. \\n\\nALL that food and a pitcher of Sangria cost us $27 dollars each. Which is SUPER reasonable for the quality meal we enjoyed.  My two suggestions are make reservations and make sure to go w/ a group so you can try a bunch of different things."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"So.. we came here for a lunch after hearing raving reviews. However the experience left us feeling so empty, we probably wont ever return for the overpriced food choices that they offered. The quality of the food was equivalent to yardhouse located in dedham, but the prices were that of mistral or sorellina. As for the dishes we ordered, we had the lobster guacamole, scallops with bacon and leek risotto, and the cuban sandwich with fries and coleslaw. For the food they did put effort into it, but for the price it was ridiculous. lobster guacamole was 25.00 we had 4 claws worth of meat, the avocado was ripe, and the tortilla chips that were fried were slightly overcooked so a bit bitter. The scallops were cooked just right i have to say so props for that but my risotto was undercooked so i had bites of undercooked rice that was too salty as well. Everyone would agree likely that its unpleasant to eat undercooked hard powdery tasting rice and for a whooping price of 25.00 i expected  decent risotto. Lastly the cuban sandwich was average tasting served with cold fries, the coleslaw was bland and sweet wouldnt bring it to a summer picnic though.  Last thing i promise, my plate was not clean!! it had crusted old food on the corners! \\n\\n  The worst part.. here it comes. When we walked in the host semi ignored us to attend to his menu shuffling duties.  You would assume that at a location like this, the hostess would drop what hes  doing to seat us, afterall the customers should be treated as priority compared to putting away some menus.  He didnt allow us to sit where the sun was, and forced us to sit right outside the doorway outside when not all seats were filled.  He just didnt take the time to listen to our preference and just seated us where the next server needed guests.  Then we had the least genuine server possible, who was unattentive, slow, and well fake as fxck. She had this tone she used with us that was different from how she spoke to other customers. That really made me uncomfortable, since she made me feel like i was less than the other people they were serving and she didnt have to time of day to serve us. She didnt even bothering telling us her name. \\n\\n  Overall terrible experience, disappointing food, and wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Both were super nice and accommodating, happy experience so far... Drink Menu, veeeery nice, big White & Red wine selection, plus a \\"Pink & Orange\\" wine option (Of course that's what I chose  ). They also have a small but nice cocktail list, featuring classics with a twist, like the \\"Pasado de Moda\\" (Spanish for \\"Old Fashioned\\") made with Tequila, grapefruit bitters and cinnamon. Yummers!\\n\\nTheir beer selection is small but substantial, their Scotch/Whisky program is bigger, as far as drinks go, you're pretty much covered...\\n\\nI perused the bar food menu. At first it was confusing because it's not thematically defined menu. It has Hispanic inspiration, some Italian, American, and bits from everywhere else. After trying some of it I was impressed by it's quality.I stuck to the Hispanic inspired cuisine and went for 2 amazing dishes, a Lamb Pozole with Hominy and Cabbage, and The White Bolito Arepa with Lamb and Pork Merguez sausage, relish and Cr√®me fra√Æche.\\n\\nFirst I got the Pozole, and it was DE LI CI OUSSS!!! I've had Pozole every way you can imagine, but this one is something else, the hominy is so fresh & meaty, complementing the Lamb broth and meat like you cannot believe! They also brought me \\"Roti\\" which is neither tortilla nor bread, but something in the middle. I had never tried it so I asked the server about this amazing thing that was making my pozole even better; he told me the Pastry Chef made it based on his Grandma's recipe. This completely made sense; those flavors and layers of flaky softness are nothing mass produced -- let me tell you!. As we were talking, the Pastry chef happened to pass by and the server was kind enough to introduce him! He explained that Roti originally came from India. This type which they make in South America (where his family is from) its way more flavorful since it's not only meant to accompany dishes but it's supposed to shine on its own, as well. In the Caribbean every piece of the meal is supposed to be as flavorful as they can imagine. This is no exception, it does shine like a diamond, shine bright like a diamo-o-ond (sorry, I had to) I just cannot explain how good that thing is.\\n\\nAaaany way, I was almost full now, the portion of Pozole was generous plus, I almost finished my big and glorious Roti, so I was making an effort at this point, when along came my corny Arepa. The Arepa was filled with amazing sausage, subtle relish and to my surprise, perfectly bitter Okra that when combined with the Cr√®me fra√Æche nearly made music. So much goodness out of this place! This plate is not too small either, so keep that in mind, because I didn't and I had to leave without having dessert which is sad but then again, it gives me a very decent excuse to go back soon! They had some stuff listed that I'm dying to try, like 3 Leches Cheesecake!.\\n\\nOh and FYI the orange wine was delicious! It's orangy, not overly dry, and just the right amount of sweet. I would have it again whenever!\\n\\nThe promoted highlights about this restaurant are Farm-Table ingredients, Seasonal/changing menus & dim sum service, so there is a lot to look forward to here. The prices are not crazy, and the service is outstanding, plus the 90's music goes well with everything, so there you go, a feast for all your senses!"},{"name":"St. Honor√© Boulangerie","address":"2335 NW Thurman St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Always enjoy this French bakery!

This was about 7pm, so I was shocked...happy, but shocked. \\n  We had the \\"Yard\\" sampler which consisted of: pretzels, bier cheese, fried pickles, potato pancakes and sauerkraut balls.

I made a reservation on their website and specifically requested a booth or table along the wall as last time we sat in the middle of the restaurant and we got jostled around way too much by wait staff and patrons.\\n\\nWe were seated at about 8:45 and we promptly ordered some sangria (tasty, although not out of this world great like Dali).  We ended up ordering WAY too much: two plates each of the filet mignon (great), calamari (pretty good), duck confit (excellent), beef short rib (good), goat cheese empanadas (our least favorite; not nearly enough filling in the empanada and I would've liked it crispier) and one plate each of the smoked salmon (didn't try it) and the salt cod (ditto).  The plates are really generous and on a few of them - the calamari, the empanads - we would've been fine with one plate for the four of us.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and had no problem having the kitchen stagger dishes for us.  He was never very far away when we wanted a refill on sangria or when we were finally done and wanted our check.\\n\\nI do agree with other reviewers who have said this place would benefit from having less tables just to add an extra level of comfort for its patrons, but... seeing how many people were waiting for tables while we were there, I understand why there are so many tables."},{"name":"Rio Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"1122 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Rolling through Vancouver on our way to Whistler and saw this place and decided to try it on an impulse.

We walked in on a Saturday at 2:00, the restaurant was almost empty. As it turned out, the conveyor belt was broken. We ordered off of the menu that our nice server handed to us, and checked off the plates we wanted. I thought that there could be a upside with the broken belt, our sushi would be super fresh. However that upside was not enough to win over sushi that was just not-to-great.\\n\\nWe ordered Salmon, Tuna, a few rolls, and some calamari. The fish was fine, it just lacked flavor, and for the life of me, I do not know how Salmon loses flavor. The rolls did not impress me either. There was so much cream cheese in the roll that I could not taste anything else (this was a full $7 roll). I could barely see, let alone taste the salmon in it.\\n\\nI am searching my mind for a soy sauce that I have ever encountered that tasted as salty as Sushi Boat's. I know soy sauce is salty, of course it is, but this soy sauce burned my lips with salt.

We were greeted & seated promptly, with an early reservation, we were the first ones seated in the back room.  Jazz playing (a bit loudly for such a small space) in the background, our waiter dropped off menus and disappeared for a while.  He returned with butter-biscuits, which were absolutely delightful, and my highlight of the meal!  \\n\\nWe had looked at the menu online beforehand, and knew what we were going to get.  The website shows the cheese board & charcuterie board separately ($20 & $25 respectively), but the hard-copy menu only showed the combined for $45.  We inquired about just getting the cheese board, and were told that's no longer available as a separate item.  How very odd... m'kay, sure, well, we'll opt for something else then.  Tangent - while our waiter Alex was friendly, he wasn't great at it, and was underdressed for a place that charges $50 a steak (jeans & a plaid button down).  It was clear Alex was a bartender that was doubling as a waiter.  Back to it then... we order, Alex doesn't write it down, goes back to the computer, then comes back and double-checks how we wanted our steaks prepared, and what we wanted for a side.  Really not an issue, but a bit unprofessional.  We overheard one of many conversations he had with another table that got seated, where Alex had sustained a concussion several weeks before, and it was impacting his memory & other things. Perhaps you should write things down (not trying to sound like an asshole, it's just a sincere recommendation if you're in a service job & can't remember 2 ppls order).  Also overheard to the other table... \\"feel free to order off menu or customize anything.\\"  Ahem, but you can't give us just the cheese board... seriously?!\\n\\nSo the food.  Salad came out.  I think there was a half a piece of bacon on there, I'm not sure.  And there was one tiny tomato cut in half too!  In other words, it was sorely lacking the accoutrements advertised.  \\n\\nAlex had several nice conversations with the other table, apparently one of the guys used to work at the restaurant, or something.  Oh, and the owner of the restaurant came in, had a nice chat with the other table as well; didn't ever bother to say hello to us or anything.  Not that I really care about meeting the owner, but if you're going to come in and say hello, take the 5 seconds to greet your other guests.\\n\\nMain course!  My wife like's her steak burnt to a crisp, so ordered her filet butterfly cut, very well done.  I ordered my tomahawk medium well (I know, for shame!).  Her steak was at the start of being charred on the outside, but medium rare on the inside.  She asked to have it cooked more, Alex was confused at the request, asking what he should tell the chef. They dropped off the side of asparagus we ordered.  It looked like a garnish.  This side cost $9, which meant we paid more than $1 per asparagus spear.  It was advertised as \\"roasted asparagus\\", it tasted boiled to me (soggy & flavorless).  This was probably the most disappointing item of the entire meal.  Later on someone dropped off my wife's steak, and apologized; it was cooked to her liking this time, woot!  Alex said something earlier about the steaks \\"resting\\", I'm assuming that's where they let the steaks cool a bit before being brought out?  Both my wife & I felt the steaks were not served warm enough.  We dalloped some butter on top, and it took its sweet (honey butter) time melting.  Chalk that up to personal preference?  \\n\\nWe finished our meals, and waited a bit.  Eventually I stacked the plates and slid it to the corner of the table, as a not-so-subtle message to our waiter.  In this time he stopped at the other table a few times...  Eventually he took the plates, and went back behind the bar to make more drinks for the other table, without asking if we wanted to look at the dessert menu, or to get the check.  When he dropped drinks off at the other table, we flagged him down and asked for the check.  He asked if the manager had stopped by, we said something to the effect of, \\"someone dropped off the steak\\", because we weren't sure if that person was the manager or the chef.  I left still being hungry, I would've ordered dessert if Alex hadn't wandered off for so long.  \\n\\nWorth noting, throughout the meal, several employees wandered through the back dining room, seemingly looking for something, or just confused.  It appeared to us they weren't used to having guests in the dining area, it definitely bordered on being disruptive based on how frequently it happened.\\n\\nTLDR - It was a disappointing experience, and the food was not worth the price, by a long shot.  Our waiter was nice, but not polished, or what I'd expect for a place I'm spending $75+/pp.  If you're a regular, it sounds like they take care of you... but I'm not sure how you transition to regular when they pretty much ignore you otherwise."},{"name":"Brodie's Seaport","address":"215 Derby St","city":"Salem","stars":"3","text":"Can't get your order correct.

The shoestring fries and homemade sauce are a wonderful complement.\\nSushi is very good and fresh; although nobody has been able to dethrone #1 Murata.  Service is upbeat and fun, the wait just a little long (but I did visit during Happy Hour), and prices were as expected.  There are some creative drink concoctions on the menu.  I was not a fan of the miso soup with clams for $7, I prefer a simple version for less."},{"name":"Hanami","address":"3211 Grant McConachie Way","city":"Richmond","stars":"2","text":"Hanami was probably the worst restaurant I had ever been to - even in light of the fact that it's in an airport. Don't get me wrong - the food was good, but I wasn't really able to sit down and enjoy my meal.\\n\\nI arrived at a fairly slow Hanami with about two hours to spare before my flight, and spent about 20 minutes seated before a waitress arrived with a glass of water; mind you, she hadn't acknowledged my empty table or bothered taking an order yet. After waiting an additional 30 minutes for my food to arrive, I rushed through my meal and asked for the bill before I even finished, knowing the waitress would drag her feet to bring it.  About 10 minutes later, I had to ask for the bill again (because the waitress forgot about it) and she spent another 10 minutes trying to figure how her credit card machine worked. By the end of it all, I had less than 10 minutes to get through security, customs, and boarding.\\n\\nLong story short, the service wasn't even horrid; it was simply nonexistent. This was the first time I had ever deliberately not left a tip and didn't feel bad about it; if anything, I would have tipped the kitchen for trying to keep up with such stupidity, but I was more concerned with making my flight at the time.\\n\\nMy recommendation?

The restaurant soft-opened during the first week of December 2013 and officially opened on December 9, 2013.  In Korean, ssam means \\"wrapped.\\"  This often refers to a wrap one might make when eating Korean BBQ, using lettuce to wrap meat and other condiments.\\n\\nSsam Burger opened in a small strip mall on Defoors Ferry Rd, not far from Collier Rd.  It's located in the same neighborhood as Verde Taqueria, Big Easy Grille, De Palma's, and Hankook Taqueria.  In fact, the strip mall where Ssam Burger resides is where De Palma's used to be.\\n\\nThe restaurant isn't very big.  It seats roughly 20 customers.  Seating consists of a communal, wooden, high top table in the center of the dining area and bar-style seating along the front window and perimeter walls.  The space has just been renovated and feels modern, clean, and fresh.  The atmosphere is casual.  You stand in line and order at the register.\\n\\nThe menu currently features burgers, rice dishes, and creative sides such as lotus chips and Korean sweet potato fries.  They also have bubble tea!  The kitchen is headed by a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu.  Since the restaurant is new, the chef is still making changes to the menu.  Exciting creations are on the way.\\n\\nThere are a lot of good burger restaurants in Atlanta, but none have an Asian twist like Ssam Burger.  That's what makes them unique.  All burgers use Holeman & Finch bread and Angus beef.  The burgers are beautifully presented, open-faced, on metal trays a la BBQ restaurants like Heirloom Market BBQ and Community Q.\\n\\nFood is ordered a la carte and is reasonably priced.  Burgers are $6.99 each, rice bowls $7.25 each, and sides about $2.00 each.  There's also an Asian kale salad for $4.99.  Teas are $3.50 each, one size only.\\n\\nSo far, I've tried the following:\\n\\nBurgers:\\nSeoul - Korean beef BBQ patty, sesame, arugula, red onion, ssam sauce\\nKimcheese - Korean beef BBQ patty, provolone, kimchi, ssam sauce\\n\\nSides:\\nLotus chips\\n\\nOther:\\nAsian Kale Salad - kale, Mandarin orange, crispy chow mein noodles, white and purple cabbage, cilantro, and sweet plum sauce\\n\\nThe burgers are delicious.  I believe all burgers are cooked to medium unless otherwise specified.  The beef patties are hearty and overall, the burgers are quite filling and flavorful.  The ingredients are fresh.  In the Kimcheese burger, unfermented kimchi is used as opposed to the traditional, more sour, pickled version.  It works well.  The ssam sauce is similar to the sauce eaten with ssam (wraps) at Korean BBQ.  It's savory and made of ingredients like sesame oil, onion, garlic, and sugar.  The wondrous H&F bread brings it all together.\\n\\nThe lotus chips are made fresh in the kitchen.  Raw lotus is thinly sliced and then fried and seasoned.  The chips are crunchy and addicting.  Definitely order some.  They're fun and distinctive.  I've yet to try the glazed Korean sweet potato fries, but plan to on my next visit.\\n\\nThe Asian kale salad is a basic salad.  It's very healthy.  I'm a big fan of kale and love it when restaurants offer healthy options like kale on their menus.  The leaves are nice and crisp.  I think the salad works well as a side (to balance things out), though you may want to split it with another person due to its portion size.\\n\\nThe bubble tea is surprisingly good.  It reminds me more of Honey Bubble's tea than Sweet Hut or Quickly's teas.  It's not as sweet as the latter two, which is a good thing.  There are about 10 different milk teas to choose from and over a dozen clear teas to choose from.  Toppings include tapioca pearls (the \\"bubbles\\"), coffee jelly, lychee jelly, and more.\\n\\nI recommend the pistachio milk tea and the lavender milk tea, with tapioca.  They have some of my favorite flavors, such as Thai tea and taro, on the menu too.  I also like that they have green tea (matcha) milk tea.  I would prefer if the tapioca was a bit softer, but generally, it's fine.\\n\\nService is fast and efficient.  To-go containers are made from recycled materials and are biodegradable.\\n\\nPlenty of parking is available out front.  Weekday lunchtime is the restaurant's busiest time.  In the rare case parking isn't available, additional parking is available behind the building.\\n\\nI am very happy Ssam Burger has opened, mainly due to its close proximity to my home, delicious burgers and bubble tea, affordable prices (better than nearby Flip Burger and Yeah! Burger), and quick and friendly service.  I look forward to many visits in the future."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Plain and simple. This is the BEST ramen and tori karaage, not just for Portland, but for the Pacific Northwest. Sorry Seattle, I grew up there and I'm embarrassed to say they don't have anything even close. \\n\\nKaraage is a method of marinating food in a sacred ratio of soy sauce, garlic, and ginger, lightly coating it with seasoned potato starch, and deep frying it to a nice golden brown. The chicken at Yuzu is moist and flavorful thigh meat that is marinated to perfection. Why most other places in PDX use breast meat, I have no idea. The batter is crisp, light, and flavorful without ever being oily. There is even a little bit of skin left on each morsel for extra flavor and crunch. \\n\\nRamen has an extensive history and culture all its own. If you visit Japan, you will witness firsthand the degree of variability in its preparation and presentation depending upon its heritage from different parts of Japan. The only similarity is the pride the ramen chefs take in their daily reproductions of this perfect food from their secret family recipes. At Yuzu, you will believe that a little of this heritage has immigrated successfully across the Pacific to this town called Beaverton. The texture and taste of the ramen noodle here are of the quality one would expect when it is made fresh daily and cooked to perfection each and every time. As they say, if the ramen noodle is the body, then the ramen soup is the soul. The soup here can be described simply with one word, umami. Umami is a savory taste considered one of the five basic tastes in addition to the better known sweet, sour, bitter and salty. Directly translated from Japanese, umami means \\"pleasant savory taste\\". Not to be confused with artificial MSG, umami is achieved naturally through a perfect blend of umami-rich ingredients balanced with just the right amount of salt. Yuzu's mastery of umami is why every spoonful here is simply divine. \\n\\nFor ramen and tori karaage in the US, this is as good as it gets, unless you want to fly to San Franciso, LA, Las Vegas, or Manhattan.\\n\\nTip: If you don't have a reservation on Fri/Sat night at opening, expect to wait 1.5 hours.

It combines rich, rich history and tradition with timeless, homey conviviality.  Plus lots and lots of delicious beer and satisfying food.\\n\\nThus, while the American versions capture all of the surface trappings, the magic isn't quite there.  Whether you find delight or disappointment in palely reflected glory, they can't disguise the wolfish commercialism of the enterprise.  In Bavaria, a dirndl is simply a traditional costume; in the United States, it is an excuse to turn the cleavage up to 11, to extract some extra tip money from the salivators.  Here, the clientele are all white midwesterners rather than a marvelous pancultural array of world travellers as in Germany.  And of course, you know, you gotta have a ton of big screen TVs, bro!\\n\\nSo...it doesn't cast the beguiling spell of the original.  It may feel a little false.  It's baldly American, not charmingly European.  HOWEVER, regardless of all that, any Hofbrauhaus is still a fine place to spend an afternoon, or an evening.  Or both!\\n\\nSit in the main room for the full effect.  Sit on the patio (not a beer garden, please don't call it that) for 95% less atmosphere but 100% more weather.  Sit upstairs for 75% less atmosphere but 95% greater ability to converse in a normal tone.  There's a seating area for every group's taste.\\n\\nThe food is good, the beer is good, the music is oompah-ly good.  Settle down with a liter and the supreme pretzel (a more perfect snack was never invented).  If you're there for a second hour, order another of both.

I asked the waitress why is the price different and she stated \\"the drink is only on sale on Sundays\\" . I asked the waitress to bring me the menu to show her the correct price.

I expressed to her that it was worth the argument and the $2 overcharge would be her tip from me (she had overcharge each of the 3 adults which totalled to $6).

We got there about ten minutes before the restaurant opened at 11:30am and got a good place in line.  We were the fifth party seated.  I of course understand that when a restaurant opens and there is a line, there will be more of a wait than at other times in the day.  But when you've been seated with your menus closed for forty minutes and your waitress continues to give you the \\"I'll be right there\\" snotty brush-off when you try to flag her down, I consider that unacceptably bad service.  There were people who were seated after us who were done eating before our waitress could finally condescend to take our order.  Additionally, we had to flag her down for every drink refill, and she didn't check on us once after we got our food.  It took her about 15 minutes just to take our check at the end.  Luckily we weren't in a rush to get anywhere, and to be fair, it seemed as though the rest of the waitstaff was much better and nicer.

The spacious interior coupled with the warm staff help create a perfect ambiance to accompany their uniquely crafted food. Their fluffy Ricotta pancakes are aptly named 'Cloud Nine' pancakes. If there was a pancake heaven, these belong right up there! Their 'Shooting Star' elevates OJ to another level with the addition of carrots, lemon and ginger. Oh..and did I mention their coffee that's sourced from local roasters? What sets Northstar apart are really the subtle finishing touches like the delicious herbs and ginger on their sweet potato fries.\\n\\nTheir service is just impeccable. It shows you they care when they hand you a card for a free entree when your food is brought out  late or when they give away praline scones on the house when they're winding up brunch service. \\n\\nOverall, definitely worth the long wait during weekends to get a table!"},{"name":"Ru San's","address":"3365 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food fun atmosphere.

By now, more people had come in, including a large group that took the one large table in the separate dining room area. We asked the server about my croque madame and she said she would check on it. I started seeing people in the large group who had ordered well after me getting their food. A few more minutes pass and the guy who had taken my order comes to our table and asks me if we had ordered together. I tell him we didn't.

Hey, whatever will bring them in, right? Looking over the menu, I was drawn to the \\"Hail Seitan\\" sandwich, as it seemed a good contrast to the rest of our weekend (six BBQ joints in two days). The menu promised \\"house made buffalo seitan, tangy carrot slaw, lettuce, provolone and ranch dressing on a Hawaiian bun\\"; it sounded great, so I placed my order.\\n\\nFor those not familiar with seitan, it's what vegans call a \\"meat analogue\\", a substance that can be prepared to have the texture and \\"tooth\\" of chicken or other meats, while still remaining animal product free. Made from wheat gluten, it's also referred to as \\"wheat meat\\", and I had experienced its goodness on a number of occasions prior to this. \\n\\nUpon delivery, I observed a very good looking sandwich. All of the promised elements were in view, so I dug in. The bun was great, the carrot slaw definitely had the promised \\"tang\\", but sadly, it might have been the best part of the sandwich. The seitan was presented in \\"strips\\", almost like a fajita cut, rather than a \\"shredded\\" format that might have worked better on this sandwich. The strips were too chewy and, while they did have good buffalo taste, the texture was just too off-putting. I did finish the sandwich because everything else about it was quite good. \\n\\nBottom line: If they could work on that seitan texture a bit, this could be a knockout sandwich.

Their bread is crispy but not hard, and it's very thin so you don't choke on a mouthful of bread. Their thin layers of fillings complement the thin bread very nicely, and I don't feel cheated out of food there because the length is making up for the girth. I have to say their pickles is probably the most disappointing part, because it wasn't the big matchstick crunchy pieces, but rather shavings or very thin julienne carrots. The pickles are supposed to have a little bite to them and add a bit of sour to counter the heaviness of the pate and mayo.

The soup and seaweed salad were nice, but not exceptional.\\n\\nNormally, I knock at least a star off for the side being less than expected, but the fish was so far and beyond surpassing my expectation I'm not going to do so.  \\n\\nIf they serve sushi, we've pretty much tried it in Austin.  From Uchi to take out at HEB and every restaurant in between, I've hit at least 3/4s of them.

I so wanted the experience to be 4+ stars, but I think there's a point where Disney actually hurts themselves and the restauranteur when trying to \\"disney-fy\\" something.\\n\\nI got to Kouzzina right at opening for dinner (5:00) so I didn't have the problems of the long wait times even with reservations that some have had below.  When I left there were quite a few people standing in the lobby so I'm not sure how it was going for them.\\n\\nBeing an Iron Chef fan, I was excited to see what Cat would put her name on and that really is what tipped my decision to eat here.\\n\\nI started out by ordering a Saganaki as heck, why not, right?  Very disappointed to learn it wouldn't be en flambe tableside.  To be honest, I question whether it was flambed at all.  I wasn't all nice and melty and the toast points that came with it were very hard.  I never asked but I'm assuming that Disney/local authorities are putting the stops on flaming something tableside because of all the children.  Okay, not happy but fairplay on that, but at least flame the damn thing back in the kitchen.  The cheese was actually propped up on top of the bread so there was no chance of even hearing it sizzle.  Major sadness.\\n\\nNext course I ordered up the Avgolemono soup (Cream of Chicken & Rice with Lemon) and I actually liked it very very much.  It sort of comes to the table de-constructed.  The rice and chicken are piled high in the middle of the bowl (above the soup) and then the cream soup and lemon are actually separated (naturally) and there was a tiny slice of lemon in it.   If you do not mix all the ingredients together, you will get what several have said below as a very tart soup.  But mixed together this was excellent and I could have had another 5 bowls.\\n\\nFor my main, I ordered the Kouzzina Trio which was a combo of the Pastichio (Greek Lasagna), the Char-grilled Lamb Burger and the cinnamon chicken over orzo.\\n\\nI loved the Cinnamon Chicken, taste was spot on and the orzo was extremely tender, it's a winner in my book, don't know how it would be as a full dish.  The Lamb Burger had a great flavor but to me, was too salty.  I think the combo of spices plus the olives used kicked it into that realm and that's sad.  I love the taste of lamb but depending on the bite (since there was a lot of things in the burger), it either delivered or was too darn salty.  sadness.  I saved the Pastichio for last as that is my favorite comfort food dish at most greek restaurants.  It is served in a ramakin and to be honest, I think that takes away from it all.  Sure it keeps it warm, but alas, I found it difficult to get decent forkfuls out of it given that instead of macaroni, they are using bucatini which is a thick spaghetti type noodle.  So frequently I'm cutting and trying to pick up a forkful but having to deal with long noodles hanging and swinging.  The bechamel was very good however, it was sort of \\"glopped\\" on top of the noodles and then covered with cheese that was melted under a sandwich melter in the kitchen.  The seasoned meat in this dish however was spot on.  So I would encourage anyone ordering either the Trio or the full order of Pastichio to dump it out on your plate and enjoy it that way.\\n\\nI did skip dessert as frankly I was full.  I ate all 4 slices of fresh bread that came to the table before my food and combine that with 2 Mythos beers and well, it was a very filling dinner.\\n\\nI just hoped for so much more.  It's not cheap if your not on the Disney Dining Plan and from that perspective, that's why it's getting 3 stars.  If not for the Avgolemono, cold beer and fresh bread, it would have gotten 2 from me.  \\n\\nSorry Cat, I really really wanted to like this more but your talents have been Disney-fied."},{"name":"Haiku Poetic Food & Art","address":"800 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here with a big party of 17, food took an hour and a half to come out...

I can think of four times that I've been in the drive thru lane for more than 15 minutes on my lunch break - and most of the time something about my order ends up being wrong anyway.

There are menus for the 3 or 4 markets that Bill Miller is in, and they all have different #s for the menu items - this has led to confusion at my workplace, especially by people who don't go here often.

This was my first time here. I live very close by and specifically avoided this place for the first few months after opening because I didn't want to endure \\"rookie\\" staff, and then I forgot it was here so I finally made it over. \\n\\nThe food:  2.5 stars. I had gyoza ($4)which was burnt on one slide and raw on the other and the little reservoir for the ponzu sauce was not enough and had to be used sparingly.  The filling was sparse, and not remarkable. I ordered the Dank wings (5/$5)and they took almost a half hour to come out and they were under done. Burnt flavor because of the uneven cooking.  Again, no remarkable flavor there either. \\n\\nThe service: 1 star. Poor and not very attentive even though there were 4 tables and 2 servers. See first paragraph. There was a rookie behind the sushi bar and a rookie server who didn't know how the dank wings were flavored. It turns out buffalo. Why don't you just call it that?  Since you called it something special, I thought it was something special.  The server that seated me was nice enough, but had no idea there was a happy hour and had to ask. There was only one happy hour menu that the server had to keep coming and getting it every time someone else came in.  The server over charged for the draft beer which was BOGO. I had 2 and she rang me up twice. I guess that's what happens when you don't know it's happy hour. \\n\\nCleanliness:  2 star. Glasses over the bar dirty. Every time the sushi chef opened the fish cooler, a weird smell came from the cooler.   One chef had on gloves and the other one did not. The windows were dirty. \\n\\nSo why 3 stars?  Because I'm hoping that I came here on a bad day. I may have to try one more time only because I live so close, I'm not ready to count them out yet.

It comes in a giant mason jar and it perfect. \\n\\nBiscuits: OH. MY. GOD. With honey butter. Honestly, if you don't drench them in the butter, what are you even doing? You can get these individually if you think a bucket is too much (it usually is.)\\n\\nFried okra: served differently here, cut in half lengthwise, but the breading is not too heavy and the ranch dipping sauce is yum. Massive dish, definitely to share.\\n\\nFor lunch, I always go with the fried chicken sandwich. It is crispy, golden on the outside, juicy and plump breast meat inside. So great. For dinner, I always get the fried chicken. Fried chicken is hard to cook well and Sweet Cheeks does it really well. The seasoning is the right amount of salt and spices, and the chicken is never overcooked or dry. Caveat: you're getting half a chicken for $20 (breast, wing, thigh, drum). It's a ton of food if you try and eat it alone. I've found it doesn't do so well the next day.\\n\\nSides: Mac and cheese is heavy, creamy, salty, gooey, cheesy and served in a cup. Slaw is different, served animal-style on your platter, not overly sauced with a lighter tasting dressing, I like it a lot. Beans are nice, not too sweet and not too bean-y. \\n\\nDessert: I've only had the nutter butter cookie, it's the size of a dinner plate and is intensely sweet but yeah, so dang good.\\n\\nService: hit or miss. I've had wonderful service and I've had servers that could not give a rip about anything except for gossiping with other staff. The waitstaff leans very hipster while the patrons are more young professionals or tourists. \\n\\nAtmosphere: the last few times I've been, the music was a trip back to 1997. Lots of Backstreet, Britney, Christina, and it was loud for no reason. I don't know if they were listening to that station ironically.

It's also local to boot. Yet another bonus is the fact that the food and desserts they carry come from Lavash Cafe in Clintonville.

Among those options offered are some vegan items. \\n\\nBack to the coffee: it's good without any half and half (I usually prefer at least a little) and while I'm no expert I like the espresso. The only aspect that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the ambiance; it's in a retail space of an expensive condo building. Even though it's a small space it doesn't feel crowded when full, which is a plus, but it lacks a great coffee shop/house feel. I think the blank walls are the main culprit.

Considering there are only ~2 restaurants in downtown serving Shanghainese food (the others being Peaceful Restaurant in the Davie/West End area and Dinesty close to Robson and Denman), it's not like we can be too picky or expect too much. In fact, I'd say this is better than Dinesty. \\n\\nThe XLBs, while a bit smaller than your average XLBs and with dumpling skin a bit thicker than I'd like, had great flavour. Our group also ordered a hot and sour soup which was definitely more than adequate (at least it brought both the hot and the sour!), crispy duck, green beans, and ribs with red vinegar sauce. The ribs were probably the weakest dish: none of the pieces had that much meat, and it didn't taste too different than a sweet and sour rib dish. I was expecting a much richer and more flavourful sauce. \\n\\nIn the end, while nothing wow'd us, we didn't have any complaints either. The owners have another location in Ackroyd Plaza in Richmond, and while it is clear they know what they are doing, they admitted that the crowd they're catering to in downtown is a different demographic than what they get in Richmond (read: not as many critical Asians).

But aside from their famous veggie burger, Northstar never really blows me away like I want it to.  And being the notorious cheap-ass that I am, I can't help but notice that the food doesn't always live up to its price point.\\n\\nI would give the veggie burger five stars on its own merit.  It's not chokingly dry or oddly flavored like other meatless burgers-- it's moist and delicious.  Though I am a hardcore carnivore, I crave this bad boy.  If you've never had it, the bright-pinkness of the inside can be temporarily off-putting, but don't worry.  It's not bleeding, it's beets!\\n\\nThe last time I went to Northstar, I took my husband.  He ordered the Niman Ranch cheeseburger, which was a major disappointment.  I've had much better grass fed beef in my life, and $14 is steep for a burger that came out 15 minutes after my food, and burned as well!\\n\\nThe other food at Northstar is kind of... meh.  The Thai Burrito is good, with chicken and rice and slaw tucked into a tortilla, but it would be better if it was warm.  It's served with a peanut sauce that really makes the dish, but it tastes like the same shizz I buy over at the Asian supermarket.  The Classic Tomato and Cheese flatbread is flavorful, but nothing to write home about.  I've had the same kind of dish at a bunch of places.   I've also tried the Chicken and Avocado sandwich, and while the roasted red pepper added major deliciousness to the sandwich, the advertised avocado was barely noticeable.  Since nothing else lives up to the excellence of the veggie burger, I've pretty much given up on trying anything else on the menu.\\n\\nThis particular Northstar location is nice due to the ample close parking behind the building, the good amount of seating, and the Jeni's ice cream a couple doors down.

As we were making our way to the end of our appetizers, enjoying the company of our family, we decided to order another bottle before our entrees arrived. This was when our waiter decided to publicly embarrass and insult our party. He told us that he would not serve us until we had something to eat, and that he thought we had had enough. \\n\\nWe were not being loud, obnoxious, or offending any other patrons. In fact, the only thing I could think of that would make our waiter think we were enjoying ourselves more than he thought was appropriate was our many toasts throughout the beginning of the meal. One of my family members took this offense personally, and was deeply saddened that she may have ruined the anniversary celebration. This is her nature, an absolutely beautiful person inside and out, bubbly, happy and a beam of shining light on all those around her. She lives to make others happy and this waiter squashed her loving heart by having the audacity to assume a single glass of wine would be over the line. I am appalled that our waiter was unable to tell the difference between happiness and drunkenness.\\n\\nWe left immediately after paying for what we did get to eat at that point. This completely ruined our evening, my parents anniversary, and likely our vacation as a whole. What an absolutely disappointing and horrible staff.\\n\\nMy family has spent numerous nights all over the country at the Gaylord Resorts, they are our absolute favorites to stay at, especially with family. Old Hickory is a tarnish on their reputation and I am saddened to have provided any level of patronage to this poor establishment. I hope management has the good thought to retrain their staff to act with more grace and tact in the future."},{"name":"Goldbergs Fine Foods - Toco Hills","address":"3003 N Druid Hills Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The finest of fine foods!!

We got a bottle of wine, 1 app, 2 entrees from the comfort food menu, and 1 dessert for $75. Considering the food totaled around $65 that made this a good deal.\\n\\nWe got the mussels as our app, and they were delicious. The portion was also very big and worth the $18 price tag (I would estimate 35-40 mussels).\\n\\nI got the fish n chips, which were average overall. The fish was perfectly fried, and the fries were pretty good, but for $18 ($19?) I expected another piece of fish. I understand that being on Newbury allows you to raise your prices, but that just sounds steep for fish n chips.   SO got the ravioli, which was really tasty and the portion was just right.\\n\\nWe got the gingerbread sundae, which was a piece of warm gingerbread cake covered in chocolate with vanilla ice cream.

The cake was moist and perfect, and it was warm long enough to pair perfectly with the ice cream and whipped cream.\\n\\nThe only problem with the service (would have been 5 stars otherwise) is that our entrees came out while we were maybe 80% done with the mussels. I don't know if this is because they like to churn out the people with the Gilt vouchers to make more room for full-paying customers, if they just have too-fast service, or what, but it irked me that the entrees were on the table at the same time as the app. And it's not like we were eating really slowly- we went to town on the mussels as soon as they arrived and they were good enough that we never slowed down. It had to be maybe 10 minutes from when the app was placed on our table to when the entrees arrived. \\n\\nOverall they get 4 stars instead of 3 because of how smoothly the Gilt voucher redemption process was.

So I think okay, I'll just call them and see if they can remedy that in some way.\\n\\nThe first time I call, a female employee answered my phone. She put me on hold for no particular reason (I could hear her chatting in the background). When she picks up the phone again, I tell her what the situation is, she seems annoyed, checks my order in her system and informs me \\"Yeah, it's not a thin crust. We didn't make a thin crust. We made it with the regular amount of dough.\\" \\nI tell her that I had indeed received a thin crust pizza when I had asked for their regular crust.\\n\\"Call us back in 15 minutes\\", she said as she is about to hang up.\\nI asked her why and she tells me the manager isn't there so i need to call them back when he is.\\n\\nGreat, so now the pizza is sitting there getting cold and I don't even know how you're going to offer to resolve the situation....\\nI waited and called them back. \\n\\nA person called Mohammad picked up. Asked me what was wrong with my order. I told him, and he asked me again \\"So what is wrong with the order? It's just the crust, there is nothing wrong with it. If there was something wrong we could make your order again but you're just saying you got a thin crust. The pizza is okay.\\"\\n\\nBy now it was clear to me that this was how they dealt with complaints at this store. By not acknowledging them and trying to intimidate the customer. Speaking in a level tone I explained to him that the people who had ordered the pizza for their dinner specifically asked for the regular crust because they do not like the thin crust and in fact some of them will not eat the pizza they had sent.\\nHe cut me short \\"You don't like it, that's no problem, then don't order from here again.\\" You think I will send you a new pizza? No. I don't think so.\\"\\nI told him that I hadn't suggested that he do and that he really hadn't given me an option on how he would remedy the mistake his store made.\\nSo he tells me \\"Okay, I'll give you a discount next time you'll order\\", and is ready to hang up when I ask him \\" How?\\". His answer,\\"Ask for Mohammad next time you call and I'll give you 10% off your next order\\".\\nSo, to recap: You mix up my order, ask me to wait and call you twice to deal with people who seem to have no sense of customer service and are rude, you tell me to take my business elsewhere, and then offer me a $2 discount for the next time I order from your store to make up for the mistake you made? \\nNeedless to say I hung up soon after.\\n\\nI have gone to a couple of the Megabite locations in the past, and have been to the New West store in person before. After this experience I will take my business elsewhere, as their employee suggested.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it really doesn't matter all that much that you slipped up with my order. Mistakes happen, I get it. A simple and genuine sorry would have done. But being rude to a customer and wasting their time by arguing with them? That's the stuff that will make them sign up for Yelp and leave a 1 star rating."},{"name":"Canton Cooks","address":"5984 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Solid Chinese food with some good specials and some traditional American-Chinese items as well.

Being that this is in a strip mall close to the old Palace, I wasn't expecting \\"greatness\\".  The food was just OK and the inside is smoky and very basic.

Despite the name there was no music playing, be it Mozart or otherwise. The pianist is there between the hours of 11 and 3, we were told. Music lovers take note. \\n\\nWe were seated in a booth, and my wife's side was a sticky mess. The waitress came by, cleaned it for us, and then left us alone. After 15 minutes with no coffee and not even water she returned and with a smile told us a young man would be with us soon as his shift had just started. Then she left. Still no coffee, and not even water. \\n\\nShortly, surly boy arrived and we were able to order. My wife ordered the brewed coffee, and I got the Rock Me Amadeus, brewed coffee with a shot of espresso. While my wife's brew was very light with little discernible flavor, my espresso was very strong and tasted of the classic bitter roast traditional of Vienna roasts, which make it only a step or two milder than an Italian roast. I was in Heaven. God it was good. I may return just for that. \\n\\nFor our meal I ordered the Prelude #4, a smoked salmon omelette and my wife ordered the quiche Lorraine. My omelette arrived loaded with salmon, spinach and cream cheese. The smoked salmon was of an age, however, that the smell from each bite fought against the delightful presentation of the meal overall. The quiche, on the other hand, succeeded on many levels from the presentation to the layers of favors from herbs to the Black Forest ham and eggs. \\n\\nThe bread that came with each meal is worth the trip in and of itself. That the server brought butter that steadfastly refused to yield any flavor whatsoever was frustrating. What I still can't get over, though, is that they serve Welchs jelly, the same stuff you can buy at the cheapest of wholesale grocers for the lowest price because there's little actual fruit involved in its production. Really? Really. For that bread? It would have been like putting Turtle Wax on your Ferrari. \\n\\nTry this place, just don't go in with high expectations. The decor is beautiful, and I appreciate that the owners want to bring a piece of Europe to our fine neighborhood.

It does not come with rice and beans on the side despite being listed under plates in the menu; maybe the menu is referring to the rice and beans on the inside. Either way, a $6 price tag means that I don't care.\\n\\nI could also go on an on about the pupusas and tortas and everything else, but it's inexpensive enough that you should just go and try all of it. But I do have two important notes. One - get the fried plantains which come with a creamy dipping sauce and are actually crisp on the outside in addition to being caramel-y brown.

We were seated around 9 AM and we were outside and enjoying the Sunday morning sunshine and the sound from the nearby waterfall. \\n\\nThe waitress was quick to bring menus, but it took awhile for her to come back for drink orders. Regardless, we were enjoying the brunch chit-chat and didn't notice the wait that much. We got our first round of drinks and my friend asked for water at the table. The waitress came back in two intervals to bring us water, two glasses each trip, she mentioned that they had run out of glasses and needed to wash more? Okay...\\n\\nShe then took our food orders and the waiting began... \\n\\nAnd waiting... \\n\\nAnd waiting...\\n\\nWe got our first round of drinks around 9:20. The food didn't come out until 10:15. Granted that the waitress had come back several times to say it was in the process of being prepared...\\n\\nSo, we get our food and this takes several trips from the waitress, we had six plates and it took her three trips, plus a trip for the silverware we needed to eat with and ketchup.\\n\\nThe waitress mixed up our orders and we had to swap plates back and forth to get the right food... And the food wasn't even that great. Someone in another review mentioned most of it seemed frozen... I'd agree with this. The potatoes were gritty, which means they're either old, or cooked from frozen and only kissed a frying pan long enough to brown. The sausage was gray, which means it had been microwaved and the omelettes were runny in the middle with undercooked egg. We wanted to ask them to reheat a portion, but didn't bother.\\n\\nWorst part: I was playing the check at the counter and I had a woman come up from another table to return her coffee cup and hand them a opened package of liquid creamer that the restaurant had given her... The creamer had expired in 2013... I went back to my table and we'd also been given expired coffee creamer... It was spoiled...\\n\\nThe cashier said it wasn't their creamer, but the waitress had brought it from somewhere, in a metal food prep bin and placed it at our table..\\n\\nWorst $70 dollars ever... Watch out for microwaved food and spoiled add-ons...

I brought my siblings (17 and 18 in age) to Sweet Cheeks when they came to Boston because we were craving BBQ. The place was crowded for a random weeknight because there was a Red Sox game on. That meant the only seat available to us was in the beer garden. The hostess told me it was first come first serve and that you don't have to be 21 to sit there. Not wanting to wait, my siblings and I grabbed a high top. None of us ordered alcoholic drinks and immediately you could see annoyance spread across the waiter's face. I understand I was in the \\"beer garden\\" but that shouldn't mean I needed to order drinks in order to get the same service as other tables. Our waiter seemed to be super attentive to other parties who had ordered beers, constantly checking up on them and bringing them more drinks, while I had to chase him down a few times to even get our food order! \\n\\nFood was also bleh. Biscuits are still probably the best I've ever had especially with the honey butter. My siblings didn't like them too much so I ended up eating two for myself. While that sounds good, the biscuits were so big that I was stuffed after this. My brother got a tray with pulled pork and ribs with corn and watermelon salad as sides. My sister got the fried chicken tray with mac and cheese and potato salad. I chose to go with a prime beef brisket sandwich on Texas toast. My brother's meats were average, lacked seasoning and needed to be drowned in BBQ sauce. The watermelon salad was literally a slice of watermelon with cheese and herb on it. He said it wasn't a good combo and ended up scraping everything off to only eat the watermelon. My sister's chicken was juicy but lacked flavor even with the \\"hot shake.\\" I had warned her that the mac and cheese here wasn't that good and she concurred when she had a bite. My prime beef brisket was actually pretty good and not as fatty as most other briskets. I took two bites and then gave the rest to my siblings because I was so full. \\n\\nUsed to be one of my favorites but has now slid to the bottom of the list.

My experience with the deli and restaurant has generally been pretty positive, however, the service at the Toco Hills store is slipping a bit.  I went to lunch there earlier in the week and before getting a table I grabbed a paper and tried to pay for it at the front counter.  The cashier (a new hire I believe) had his back to the store and was staring out the window.  I had to say excuse me a couple times to get his attention all the while a line was forming behind me.  After getting seated, I found the service from the waitress unusually slow.  As I sat with menu closed and clearly ready to order, three of the staff were at a booth chatting away with each other.  It was an unusually long wait for the food and for the check.  On top of all that, the busser tried to clear my table when I clearly was not finished eating.  The food was good as usual although I tried their chili and it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I added jalapenos to the order (no standard) and that helped a bit but not enough to order it again.

I have never had an issue with the quality of food that I've purchased here but the behavior of the employees among each other is just unacceptable.  I work around the corner on High street and this is a very convenient location for me to go to but I have limited my visits due to the lack of professionalism behind the counter.  I was at the register one morning (probably in the winter) and there was literally almost a physical altercation between two employees.  There was yelling and verbal violence and I was just in pure shock, everyone was.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing and seeing.  Just appalling. This morning I witnessed a manager (or supervisor/person in charge on duty) very disrespectfully speak to an employee right in front of customers...really? Are you telling me that the basic common sense to pull that employee aside, out of the view and earshot of paying customers, just didn't exist?  It's hard to believe they don't cover that in training.  I was embarrassed for the employee being so rudely questioned.  I don't want to make it seem like this type of behavior among employees is exhibited all the time...but again, I don't frequent this location like I used to.  As a customer, I can say that the cashiers are diligent and friendly towards us.  They are fast and very polite.

We were given water and the menu promptly. I wasn't too sure if all peaceful restaurants have the same price for their food but this place was more expensive than the other ones, or maybe they raised their prices recently. I had my beef noodles with blade sheared noodles. I've been to the Peaceful on Kingsway as well as the one on Broadway, so I had some expectations.\\n\\nOur noodles came relatively fast. Upon first glance, it looked pretty good but I was quickly disappointed. Firstly, the beef pieces were way way way too dry. I felt like I was eating cardboard. It was so dry that it lost all flavour. Secondly, the broth was very salty and dark in colour (I had never seen beef noodles this dark). In my opinion, Peaceful ultimately messed up on the two major components of this dish. Fortunately, there was a good amount of noodles and they had the just the right chewiness. However, I didn't enjoy my noodles overall because of the beef and broth. \\n\\nService was almost non-existent, even though there were barely a handful of tables occupied. But I guess I should have expected that from a Chinese restaurant. My water was never refilled. Servers didn't come by to check on us. One thing I didn't understand was when there was an error with their credit/debit card machine and my friend had to redo it: she had already put her card away so obviously she had to take it out from her wallet again. The server gave the machine to her even though she clearly didn't look ready. So it was an awkward situation where my friend was holding the machine while trying to grab the card at the same time.

A lot of sushi places tend to put a bunch of fish together, top it with something crunchy or spicy sauce on top and call it a roll. Majority of the time, it's overwhelming. Just a hot mess in your mouth. The rolls at musachino are carefully craft to enhance the flavor of the fish, in a good way! \\nAnkimo appetizer: monk fish liver in ponzu sauce. This is one of my favorites. I love that the appetizer already comes with the ponzu sauce. A lot of other restaurants, you have to ask for!\\nAvocado kama: An avacado topped with spicy crab and shrimp! I like to call this, the asian version of guacamole. You take everything out and smush it all together. The spicy sauce tastes amazing with the avocado! \\nGyu tataki: raw sliced beef in a soy sauce vinaigrette. You cannot go wrong with this dish! It has a citrus soy sauce flavor that I can't get enough of!\\nchicken teriyaki: for the non-sushi lovers. This. is. the. BEST. chicken. teriyaki. EVER!\\nTexas hybrid: my favorite roll!! You can choose between tuna or salmon. I prefer the salmon. It is wrapped in rice paper vs. the usual seaweed. Paired with a jalopeno garlic spicy sauce. Do yourself a favor and dip the roll in the sauce (not the soy sauce). It would not disappoint!\\nTexas chainsaw: (off menu) shrimp and salmon in rice paper, surrounded by a citrus fish sauce flavor. Again, this roll does not need soy sauce! It's a very simple yet delicious roll. \\nTexas road kill: again, you can choose between tuna or salmon. It's topped with various types of smelt caviar (masago, habenero, jalopeno). With a spicy sauce on the side. If you like a little kick to your roll, this is the one for you!\\nThe rolls are simple yet delicious!! I highly recommend this place!

From Taco Truck, we both got an order of their aguacate tacos with a side of guacamole and chips (the tacos were amazing. The guac and chips were standard). From the Frozen Hoagies truck, I got a ginger cookie slider with cream ice cream (heavenly). I wish I had more room in my stomach to sample some of the other trucks, but I guess that's what my next trip to Boston will entail.\\n\\nThe place was a bit crowded, but not nearly as crowded as Smorgasburg in Williamsburg.

The biggest mistake was when the waiter's thumb was literally in my food when he was serving it since I think it is the most important no-no for restaurant workers. Also, we asked them to put everyone's food on their own card and wrote it down on the back of the receipt-the amount for each card.

Our server disappeared mid meal and I hadn't gotten the capers that came with the plate, but I asked another waitress and she brought me a heaping bowl of them. Prices are a little steep (around $10 and up), but I consider it a convenience fee for a place where you get seated so quickly.

The coffee was good- overly sweetened, but good. Each little cafe table had a red rose. I guess the ambience was just a little strange, and everything felt a little weird. It was fancy but not fancy.

I found this gem on their site:\\n\\nMuga, Reserva, Rioja, Spain 2008 $ 65.00 \\nThis quintessentially over-rated and over-priced Rioja is a well structured wine with an excellent balance of fruit and oak. There's lots of smoky cedar and tobacco notes in this reserva, which shows complex berry and hints of mineral and graphite, ending with firm tannins. If you feel nostalgic for the aroma of your high school pencil case, this is the wine for you. .\\n\\nWhy would you clearly copy/paste a BAD review for a wine that calls it overpriced and overrated?!?!\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSo this place has a great reputation on Yelp and some of our friends raved. So, we were excited to take our $30 gift certificate here from Bloomspot and give it a shot. \\n\\nSo, the 3-star review is probably generous, if I'm being really objective. I had pretty high expectations but as soon as you step in you sort of realize this place is probably not super high end, which is fine as long as the meal is solid. What saved it were the relatively cheap prices and convivial staff.\\n\\nThe sangria started us off...and I'd rate it somewhere between a \\"good\\" Spanish tapas place and a chain Spanish/Mexican place. It was probably just below average. Very artificial tasting, the fruit was added to the pitcher just prior to soaking. Maybe it was just a fresh batch that they decided to not let meld before pouring it but that's not really better. I've had far, far better sangria, but it's cheap so I'd let all that slide and enjoy.\\n\\nThe tapas were a mix of decent to downright awful.\\n\\nThe good: shortrib (huge portion for $8, flavorful), spanish tortilla\\nThe mediocre: Patatas bravas (clearly microwaved just before serving...piping hot and steaming and mushy but the sauce was pretty right on in terms of authenticity), pincho de pollo y chorizo\\nThe poor: roast duck, jamon y manchego (dried meat but not in a good way - in a \\"it sat out sliced for a while\\" way), three sausages\\nThe down right misexecuted: Pulpo Gallega (parts were raw, parts were overcooked, flavorless, one of the worst examples of the dish I've had and I've had it more than a few times)\\n\\nIt was a bell curve in terms of enjoyment and that's not really what I want in a meal. I had a class of garnacha that was flat and tasted like it came from a bottle that sat open for a week or so. I should've asked which wines were most popular so that I could get a fresh glass...\\n\\nI can certainly see why it's popular on Yelp. The other diners were almost  all BC undergrads (I recognized a few from a mixed undergrad/grad class I just took) and for the price point this place is pretty average and it's like 5 stops up the B-line from campus.

I am guilty of this, and I really just view that ~$4-5 per meal as a way to put something new in your mouth and write a review for Yelp! The things I do for yelp... buy coupons solely for the sake of trying something new.\\n\\nNever on my own would I ever decide to eat at something such as Extreme Pita, or Pita Pit, for that matter. Check it: why would you take the components of something so American like Hawaiian pizza and throw it on a Middle Eastern staple, like pita bread, that is actually toasted like a pizza... Let us rewind and remember that typically pita has some lamb or salad involved. Not ham, bacon, or pineapple... and not served open like a pizza. Craziness.\\n\\nExtreme Pita follows the trend of all ethnic eateries-gone-American. It provides busy bodies with a way of eating \\"foreign fare\\" that is convenient, cheap, and easily tailored to taste. What I mean by that is essentially Subway... without subs--see How Do You Roll?, Make-Your-Own-Thai joints, and Chipotle.\\n\\nMy falafel had a boat load of fresh veggies spanning from tomatoes to mushrooms to bell peppers. The actual balls o' chickpea were soft and had sort of an off-flavor. Almost processed in texture and flavor. The actual pita was thinner than most but still quite tasty. It allowed for easy \\"rip and chew\\", which typically happens when I am famished.\\n\\nI also tried a flatbread here with a good amount of veggies and feta. It tasted like something I could easily procure out of my own kitchen. Canned sauce, toasted pita, some crumbled feta, and some veggies. Sure, I did not eat a \\"special\\", but I mean... with the ordinary ingredients, I really had no preference. I just wanted to see if I would be surprised. And surprised I was not.\\n\\nThe Jalapeno-cheddar chips were oddly not crispy. They were bland, but at least thy had a slight spice.\\n\\nThis Middle Eastern deli is convenient for those downtown, but I would branch out to some of the more \\"authentic\\" ones around town.

It is \\"The Rent is Too Damn High\\" category. Allow me to explain.\\n\\nWhile Stephanie's appears fancy, using ingredients like crab, poached egg, and hollandaise sauce, in fairly conventional ways, I feel that much of the food is just iterations of the same pieces. There are home fries, there are some greens. Then there is the main piece of your meal, whatever that looks like. It's probably fine, and somewhat bland. The food overall is something that I would expect at a breakfast diner... but they try to upscale the appearance.\\n\\nThat's another theme. The location just underwent significant renovation, and has been given an upscale look, with luxurious but ultimately awkward orange booths. Everyone is dressed well, and it feels like a brunch institution. But when the food comes out it ruins the whole upscale vibe, because it's just, well fine. And when I want brunch like this, I want it to be gooey and greasy and cheap.... I don't want the pretense, and I don't want the bill.\\n\\nAnd that's the problem here. This place feels like the only reason that they try to look upscale is because they can't afford not to be. Their rent is too damn high. Where else can you charge $18 for french toast (the cheapest brunch item), which is really just some bread and eggs? Yes, we all know there is a restaurant premium -- but they take it one step further. At Stephanie's there is a RENT premium.\\n\\nI get that they can't afford to stay here without charging an arm and a leg. But I think they need to take this one step further, they need to really commit to their status as a fancy brunch/lunch/dinner spot to justify their sky high prices.\\n\\nSo, Stephanie's -- I am seeing straight through you, and I am not impressed."},{"name":"Sichuan Garden II at The Baldwin","address":"2 Alfred St","city":"Woburn","stars":"3.5","text":"This should be a branch of Sichuan Garden.

I also noticed that even the salmon terriyaki was at that same price.  \\n\\nWhile I waited for my order I was served with standard but good green/jasmine tea, and received my miso soup for my combo which wasn't salty and didn't seem from a package.  The bento box arrived with the appetizer tempura, 4 pieces california roll, chicken terriyaki on a bed of rice and the salad.  The terriyaki sauce was not too sweet and the california rolls were standard large maki with aritificial crab but freshly made and the rice wasn't gummy.  Also, the tempura batter was shredded looking and coated very well- and not greasy at all.  I was a little surprised to see actual 'mixed spring greens' for the salad vs. the typical bento box lame attempt at three pieces of iceburg lettuce.\\n\\nOverall, my food came quickly, was fresh, showed effort- and with a 20% tip to the waitress came to only $9 and change.

We decide to go with it, some good reviews, some OK but a new Asian eats place is always worth a try. On to the food, I ordered: the full Chirashi bowl with handpicked sushi by the chef, it comes with miso soup and salad. My bf ordered Beef Tataki and the Yaki udon noodles. After we ordered, we were told the restaurant was only a soft opening, it had been open only a few weeks. The soft opening meant a limited menu and new staff training. We appreciated the heads up and were even more eager to try. \\n\\nMiso soup was good, no complaints here. It's hard to mess up a miso soup and the soup tasted just fine. The ginger salad was plentiful, and the dressing was a sesame-ginger.  On to the entrees, the Chirashi bowl, wow-is this what I ordered?! The food looked so nicely presented, I almost didn't want to eat it. Was this as good as it looked? I took a bite and OMG, the quality of the sushi was so dang good. The rice bowl itself was perfect with all the right amounts of seafood and fish eggs. I was so happy I ordered it because it was tasty and plentiful. The quality of the seafood was definitely top notch and it was enough to share.\\n\\nOn to my bf's food. I'm not a big meat eater but I took a bite of the beef tataki. MMM very tasty, it was lemon with a soy sauce base. The meat was medium but it was not chewy, but soft and melt in your mouth. I had a bite of the chicken yaki udon. It was a medium sized portion, with small shreds of chicken. The noodles were cooked well and tasty although the dish maybe could've used a little more chicken. \\n\\nWith all that said, the quality of the food was great and the portions were good too. The staff was nice, and inviting. The atmosphere inside was inviting as well. In 2 weeks, I believe the menu is expanding even more. Oh yeah, on a side note-we woke up the next day still full! We want to go back, maybe for Korean BBQ which I'm hoping and believing is just as good. :)"},{"name":"Cambridge, 1.","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I am a huge fan of any establishment that serves Saranac Pomegranate Wheat beer and the fact that they specialize in super thin crust gourmet pizza makes this place one of my favorites for a casual night with my fellow upstate NY college buddies. \\n\\nAfter drinking Saranac pom wheat for most of my college experience -- the brewery was right down the road, it's a real treat to be able to find one of the more elusive Saranac varieties here in Bostonl I love the rustic decor--high top slate tables and the smell of the brick charcoal fire oven is drool worthy for any pizza fanatic.

The onion rings are pretty good and as a side order it comes in a giant take-out container. It's definitely something you want to share with 3-4 people. I'm a sucker for their pizza rolls and Steak and Cheese subs. \\n\\nLocation: It's on Broadway Revere. They have a parking lot in the back, but it seems to be full most of the time since there is a Church next door. There is also some meter parking out front. Broadway is a busy street, so you may have to circle the block or give up and park in the Walgreens parking lot.\\n\\nRecap:\\nPrice: 5/5\\nDecor: 2/5\\nService: 3/5\\nFood/Presentation: 5/5\\nLocation 3/5\\n\\nTotal: 3.6"},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4241 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I remember the huge hype around Northstar, and while their food is tasty, I do not understand the prices.

They were lacking in flavor and had the consistency of canned corn beef hash. The \\"green peppercorn sauce\\" was under seasoned (no salt at all) and was a very unappetizing pink color. They were topped with what appeared to be canned potato sticks. Did a frat brother make this dish up? I'm from southern california, and I know mexican grandmothers who would cry that they even had the nerve to serve this and call it Albondigas.

This is not a one time issue, this has been the case for years and at each of their locations.  They are either buying surplus ingredients or storing them in a damp and unsafe environment.  You can steer clear of the seeded bagels and go for something else but then you still have a bagel that is coated in burnt cornmeal.  This shows that they are too lazy to scrap the ovens.

Afterwards a refreshing fris√©e salad special, with beets, candied carrots, and to die for local feta. Unfortunately, my wife's sister who we were dining with has an allergy to tree nuts (uggh I know!!). Albeit this is annoying, we once again had a problem with our server regarding this somewhat minor issue. She didn't seem to comprehend what a tree nut is, and when she returned with the manager, she also didn't seem confident as to what this means. After returning from the kitchen, our great dining experience resumes. \\n\\nMarket fish, somewhat vague, but when I taste the texture of that perfectly seared snapper skin, WOW! Perfectly seasoned, well balanced, this is just great! My wife got the Roasted Lamb Shoulder: succulence defined. Rich but not overly decadent, tender and crisp, simple and great. \\n\\nDesserts were not as memorable. The cookies presented in the cookie bag were stale and uninventive. The \\"very good\\" chocolate cake was as good as you'd imagine, good. The mint leaf \\"garnish\\" lacked originality and brought the dish to an underwhelming hum.  \\n\\nOur server seemed to have vanished.

The American style of greek salad has never appealed to me, since it cheapens this robust entree down to a mere side attraction and adds cheap filler for higher profit.\\n\\nSo, the two stars is not for the lettuce, but for the total failure in even trying: there were no olives.
