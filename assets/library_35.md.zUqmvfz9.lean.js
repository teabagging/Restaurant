They also make everything extremely complicated and bureaucratic. Customers need to follow rules that benefit management at the cost of good service.

Waiter was nice when he came to the table, though. \\n\\nWhen closing, they will kick you out with no tact or grace. I understand staff is tired, but train them to kick clients out with a better protocol.\\n\\nWine at the Beat tastes more like and rancid Ocean Spray juice. Also, no offence to vegans but having \\"Gluten free\\" or \\"Vegan safe\\" in a wine description is like putting a \\"led-free paint\\" sticker over an oil painting. If it is important to the drinker, let them ask if the wine has these characteristics.

Remember that with chain \\"fine casual\\" restaurants like Earls, Joey, Cactus, they have an assembly line type kitchen set up, with relatively inexperienced staff (other than the \\"leaders\\" who are generally Earls etc lifers who have climbed the ladder), so feedback is key to the management team. If your steak is actually over cooked, or wings missing the dip! or salad over dressed (when you asked for easy dress) the management wants to know about it, seriously, it's built into their model and they much prefer to comp your wings rather than you telling your friends later that you had a poor experience.\\n\\nFront of the house staff at these places is pretty good generally, so make sure you tip them! What most people don't know is that your server must \\"tip-out\\" at least 5% of their sales, even if you don't tip!! So if you don't, just be aware that your server is paying 5% of your meal total out of their own pockets. I agree, it's like we are subsidizing the restaurants labour cost, but without this comp structure your service would go way down, and the restaurant would not be able to attract nearly the same talent, even if they bumped up the wage from minimum.\\n\\nThe menu has really evolved in the past 20 years, and has lots of variety, and they add new items all the time after testing what sells at their test kitchen downtown.\\n\\nNice breezy patio at this location too. \\n\\nIt's also, like most locations, very clean, including their kitchen which is viewable from the seating area.\\n\\nCan't miss happy hour. \\n\\nWorth it for a casual outing or night out for drinks."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"7913 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"I had the Thursday special - stacked enchiladas, and it was fabulous!

It's got crafts from plenty of breweries both foreign and domestic. The only lager they had was Brooklyn (which is nice) and the prices weren't anything to write home about. I'd go back there for a beer but not specifically because they've got such a great selection/value. \\n\\nSecond came the food. A pretty average boar brat and some very tasty beer cheese with a pretzel.

Which is odd because we've never known a good Mexican place unless we're in Washington, though I know there are highly rated places on Commercial.\\nYelp to the rescue!! This is a total hole in the wall in the worst part of Surrey that I never knew existed. As mentioned elsewhere, It appears to be run by a Mexican mom with daughter serving. I couldn't confirm this because she wasn't entirely welcoming or warm to us and offered no chance for conversation. This alone would be a loss of a star.\\nHowever, the food was basic and honest. No frills or frou-frou and very enjoyable. We ordered a beef burrito each, one verde, one rojo, and one dry. Also a chorizo taco. I thought my rojo could have used a bit more seasoning inside and have some heat to it. But I guess they need to cater to all palates here and our daughter didn't complain about spicy heat.\\nI fixed that by using the hot salsa left over from the chips and salsa brought out after we ordered. Not nearly enough chips for 3 people but enough mild and hot salsa for almost 6. I only got 4 chips, myself. The remainder worked great on my burrito, so no big deal.\\nWe'll definitely return again to try something new next time. It sucks that cheese is so expensive in BC. At a restaurant in Kent, Wa that we tried, there was easily 4 times the cheese on a similar burrito for the same cost.  That would be my only complaint about the food itself.\\nDefinitely worth a try if you can get over the poor location."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Randomly looked this place up trying to find a place to have a late lunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

My fiance and I went here for dinner this evening, because he'd been craving fried chicken, and heard theirs (a Monday night special) was delicious. We started out with drinks. I got the Mulberry Street: sort of like a riff on a Manhattan with Bulleit Rye, Carpana Antica, Cynar, and orange bitters. It was bittersweet with a touch of fruit, and delicious. My fiance got a Left Hand Sawtooth Ale on a nitrogen push. It was a nicely balanced beer with a creamy head.\\n\\nHe ordered the fried chicken, and I ordered the pan roasted chicken. The server advised us that the roast chicken would take a while, so we elected to get an appetizer of smoked salmon dip with what looked like house-made potato chips. It was creamy and tasty, and the chips were nicely brown and crisp, a far cry from the pathetic things in the supermarket.\\n\\nWhen the entrees came out, they did not disappoint. The pan roasted chicken was moist and tender, with a fabulously crispy skin. The gravy on it was heavily flavored with sage and black pepper. For some people, the amount of pepper might have been excessive: it was spicier than one would expect most gravy to be. I enjoyed the flavor, though. The sweet potato \\"hash\\" wasn't very hash-like, but instead tasted like roasted cubed sweet potatoes. Hard to go wrong there, though--sweet potatoes are always good in my book. The broccoli raab was perfect, its bitterness accented with a generous amount of garlic, and not overcooked.\\n\\nThe fried chicken, according to my fiance, was delicious, though he thought the breading might have been a bit crisper. He loved the bacon-laden collard greens (and the bite I had sure was good), and seemed to enjoy the mashed potatoes. He said that the rather dense biscuit was the least impressive thing on the plate, but he still ate it all.\\n\\nFor dessert, he got the beignets, which were crisp and slightly eggy, like the bastard offspring of a yeast donut and a popover. I got the hot fudge brownie sundae, which was decadent and yummy, not excessively sweet.\\n\\nIn spite of being somewhat hipster-y, this was a nice, informal place with quality food, and a place I'd gladly visit again."},{"name":"Simply Thai Restaurant","address":"1211 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I was in Vancouver over Labor day weekend and had to get my Thai food fix.

The building looks like it was built in the 1980s and has a diner vibe to it.  My first impression of this place was that it was your run of the mill corner pizza place style restaurant.  That is, until my friends brought me here.\\n\\nThe first thing that came to my mind when I walked through the door was Kelly's.  Yes, the infamous Kelly's Roast Beef (which is a couple miles down the road in Revere).  However, unlike Kelly's this seemed more like a family owned restaurant; welcoming and unpretentious.  I looked at the menu, and found that it was similar to Kelly's.  But that's where the similarities end.  This place is *gasp* BETTER than Kelly's!\\n\\nI couldn't decide between the roast beef or the seafood.  So, I decided to get them both.  I ordered the Super Roast Beef sandwich, and the Fried Seafood Combination Dinner.\\n\\nOn the roast beef sandwich, I kept it simple.  Roast beef with cheese and barbecue sauce on an onion roll.  I wanted to find out how their roast beef sandwiches were, so I didn't want to dilute it with toppings.  The beef was warm, tender, and flavorful.  (Take notes, Kelly's!)  I enjoyed it very much!  I'd say that it was the second best roast beef sandwich I've ever had.  The sandwich came with fries.  The fries didn't look very special, but when I took a bite, WOW!  The fries were delightfully crispy.  I'm around this area all the time, and occasionally have lunch at the Burger King.  Burger King's fries are so horrible that I take them to the beach to feed the seagulls.  Not at Royal's.  Royal's fries are so good that I may never eat at that Burger King across the street again!\\n\\nThe fried seafood combo dinner had clams, scallops, shrimp, haddock and onion rings.  The onion rings were good.  The batter they use gets crispy and delicious, and the onion gave it a good flavor.  The clams were whole belly clams, the largest I've ever seen.  They were also DELICIOUS!  I loved Kelly's fried clams until I tried these.  Sorry, Kelly's, these are better!  The shrimp and scallops were also very good, and were decent sized, especially the shrimp.  The haddock was good too, but by this time, I was getting full and didn't really want the haddock anymore.\\n\\nThe platter was served in a box, which was convenient to take the leftovers to go, because I couldn't let such delicious food go to waste!\\n\\nNow I just need to resist the urge to have extravagant lunches when I'm here!

The classics are Pear and Blue Cheese (my boyfriend's favorite), Honey Lavender, Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons and the Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper.\\n\\nNow, I know I might get some flack for this, but while Salt & Straw is incredibly perfectly creamy, I did find some of their flavors were a little imbalanced. Like the black pepper? Only slightly sweet, with a strong flavor of pepper. Almost zero balsamic if you asked me. The Sea Salt Caramel was too salty for me, and then the Pear And Blue Cheese,  while d.e.l.i.c.i.o.u.s. didn't have as much blue cheese as I wanted, at least to the ratio of pear! The blue cheese was mild and there was even less pear. So it just became like a redundant sweet to me. The Honey Lavender was absolutely perfectly balanced, but was an extremely mild flavor, for as odd and rich as the others are.\\nOh and the last one I tried which I think is a constant, is the Almond with Salted Ganache. I got zero brittle :( \\n\\nSo, while I think they have a good idea, chunks and the like of their special ingredients or the balancing ingredients need to be spread out a little more evenly, if they could take one note of feedback haha. \\n\\nWe were in and out pretty quick, and I was the only one that got the massive handmade cone haha. We did also get a souvenir t-shirt LOL just to be touristy.\\n\\nI mean, we went here and then to another S&S location as well while we were up here, so clearly I AM a fan, I just think there could be improvements. Like making sure the ice cream is all the way down in the cone, so its not imbalanced. I do like that they do ask which one you want a scoop of first. They're all about pairings.

Big mistake ....\\n\\nFlexibility\\nMy daughter is not a fan of the burgers, sandwiches, and the meaty dishes on the menu and sees that another diner has spaghetti and meat balls.  We didn't see the spaghetti and meat balls on the regular menu and we ask the waitress if she could see the children's menu and it was on that menu.  We then ask the waitress if she could have the spaghetti and meatballs but she says she has to check with the manager.  My daughter is 15 and the waitress comes back and says no they won't serve her something off the children's menu to her because it's for 12 and under.  I told the waitress I would be willing to pay extra if they wanted to charge me \\"adult prices\\" - she still says no.  So my daughter ends up ordering fish and chips and she eats one of the 2 pieces of fish and a few fries - so $12.85 for eating 1 piece of fish and a few fries.  They could have served the spaghetti and meat balls for the same price and at least my daughter would have eaten more and enjoyed her meal.  It's easier/cheaper for them to make spaghetti and meatballs and make the customer happy. Isn't that what business is supposed to do? Make the customers happy so that they continue to get business?\\n\\nService\\n3 tables who were seated at the same time we were received their food and were half way finished and our food had not arrived (after waiting probably 45 minutes) so I asked the Manager (who was clearing and setting up tables) if she could check if our food was going to be ready soon.  She gives a sour face ( eye rolls etc.) and starts banging the cutlery and salt and pepper shakers down.  I just asked her to check on the food, the kitchen is not that far to walk!  I asked her politely and wasn't demanding, just politely asked her to inquire on the progress of our meal.\\n\\nFood\\nI ordered the Salisbury Steak and the gravy slathering the steak made this the saltiest dish I have EVER eaten in my entire 50+ years!   \\n\\nI would not return to Tomahawk and would not recommend it to other Yelpers.

The salad was very fresh--each piece was very crunchy, as though it was just picked today.  I ordered a medium cooked burger, and they did cook it to medium; however, it was a little dry on the outside. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  I really appreciated, though,that their food was not very greasy. Perhaps that's part of the reason for the dryness. I liked the drink that I got. I could definitely taste the vodka, but the grapefruit balanced it out very well.\\n\\nValue: other than the drink, I thought this was a great value meal.

Now, I've worked in the food industry myself, but it was never ok to not only take you lunch out on the floor, let alone at the milkshake bar, tossing fries back and forth at all the other coworkers. At that point, no one was on a register and a few people were waiting as these 5 employees just joked around. I felt bad for the girl making milkshakes who had to keep saying excuse me to her coworkers, because she was actually doing her job. There was also a very nice redhead who was busting her butt around the dining room clearing plates and tables and offering up Togo containers and recommending sauces.\\n\\nLong story short, if you want a good burger and to spend at least $15'a person, then feel free to go here.

They have a bunch of drink specials rotating through, and there is always a unique one that sounds intriguing. I get it, and I love it! So this adds an additional star for me for the fact that the option always makes me go for the special, rather than what I typically get at restaurants--a Bloody Mary or a gin and tonic.\\n\\nMy boyfriend likes the food more than I do. It is not bad, but I have learned to go with food that I \\"know\\" (e.g. breakfast foods) rather than food that would be new for me. My biggest issue, like others have mentioned, is the value. You just don't get the food that you're paying for, and I have found this to be the case no matter what I've ordered---breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It would be much less noticeable if they fluffed the dishes up with extra hash brown, salad, or whatever, but they seem keen on pretty presentation, which often means that much of the plate is empty. There is nothing more annoying than paying $50-$60 for two people to have meals and drinks, and you leave the place still hungry. \\n\\nAlso, like others have mentioned, some of the (non-breakfast) foods seem bland, especially veggies.

My boyfriend and I went last night for his birthday dinner and I don't really see what all the fuss is about ... in terms of the food. The ambiance, location and atmosphere are great! However, I can't say how much I really enjoyed the TuPac or old school 1990's rap on a Friday night at a trendy restaurant in 2012. Maybe when I'm at karaoke with my friends or reminiscing for shits and giggles. Not at a restaurant like this. Sorry.\\n\\nI'm conflicted on how to report the service because the server was knowledgeable and attentive, however, we felt extremely rushed for the sake of their turnover to earn more business. Don't get me wrong, I get that, but when I'm going to spend more than a hundred bucks on a nice meal, I want to take my time and enjoy it. Our first dish arrived maybe 2 minutes after we placed our order.... which tells me they pre-make the dishes in the kitchen. Our second dish arrived maybe 3 minutes later before we were even finished our first plate - and the plates are small so the point is to savor every bite and enjoy it, right? Lastly, they kept bringing new dishes to the table before removing the plates that were on the table so we had to make room and give them our plates once they set it down. I don't mean to be nit-picky, but I expect better service when going to a nice place like this. \\n\\nNow to the food.... The menu LOOKS delicious and seems promising.... but I guess I set myself up for a let down. We started with the Albacore tuna dish. The tuna itself was yummy, however the sauces to complement were bland and boring. Not much flavor and certainly not worth the price. Next came the charcuterie which was maybe the biggest let down. It only came with one sampling of actual cured meat which was delicious and 3 other pate's which were meh.... NO big deal! The toasted, buttered sourdough bread may have been the highlight of the dish. Next came the muscles which provided hope for the remaining 2 dishes since this one was the best we had yet. The broth it came with (I believe smoked carrot) was very flavorful and I found to be a refreshing new taste with the muscle rather than the same ole garlic and white wine sauce you typically get. However, it came with the same toasted, buttered sourdough bread as the last dish. Next came the pork cheeks and guess what? It ALSO came with the same damn bread we just had on the previous two dishes! A restaurant trying to go up against the big guys in Austin is certainly not going to wow me when you serve the same side item on 3 dishes! Big let down there. The pork cheeks themselves were good but it needed to be paired with something different - polenta, potatoes - SOMETHING else other than that damn bread! Lastly came the quail. This was the one I was looking forward to. WAY too salty! My date didn't seem to think it was too salty but man, I was thirsting for some water after each bite. Don't get me wrong, I love me some salt on a nice meat like quail, but they overcompensated. \\n\\nOverall, we were disappointed. For the price, you are much better off going to Barley Swine for what it seems they are trying to compete/compare. If you're going for snacks, drinks and atmosphere with friends, it's a fun \\"it\\" place to be seen, mingle and people-watch.

THERE'S MUCH BETTER PLACES TO GO IN SALEM. I have absolutely no desire to return. After dealing with the extremely crass and rude manager Pauline or Paula or something like that (we were treated like outcasts and so rudely when all we wanted to do was have a nice meal together-She gave me the WORST first impression but we held on to see if the night would get better.), we decided to sit at the bar in the main dining room to the right. Our horrible experience continued with a guy who was a complete spazz running around and not getting anything done, we couldn't even understand the guy! he was so rude and mean to his coworkers and it completely turned us off to this place. It wasnt even that busy and this guy was acting like 200 ppl walked through the door. Seriously relax-it wasnt that serious! I could tell he must have been inexperienced in the service industry because it was completely exhausting dealing with him at the bar. I think his name started with a G, Glen or something...I dont know. Whatever it was I could care less. Had it not been for my extreme hunger I could have left right there. When we finally sat down we actually did have a very helpful and super nice server. While dining however I noticed how miserable and lackadaisical everyone working there seemed to be. I commented on this to our server and was told its probably because everyone is forced to pool tips so noone has any incentive to actually try hard bc they always take home way less then they bring in because of this rule so whats the point- then said or it could be that everyones starving! They dont feed us or even let us eat and we work hours on end. How inhumane and cheap can u be Turners!!  Although they didnt have to be so honest I instantly got pissed! So my tip im giving MY server for the job and experience well done is essentially being split with people that had absolutely nothing to do with my dining experience?! I tip MY server for a job well done...not tip the whole establishment. If you do a good job you get better tips and its an incentive to do well, try harder, flip tables. The whole system is so screwed up and I feel so bad for the servers who are constantly (im sure) affected by this. My impression of this place is that the owners are obviously only in it for themselves and dont support the people actually making them money and for that I have lost all respect for turners and have no desire to return, Oh and your food? WAY OVERPRICED for what I got, after spending almost $100 i was STILL hungry!!! The fish may be fresh but its skimping on size and I felt ripped off! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! rude front desk and bar staff, cheap portions, cheap owners! -the server was great so u have a select few that are assets but this place is definitely not worth spending your hard earned money.

Why the review downgrade? They have made the experience horrible over the last 5-6 times, almost seemingly deliberately. Why? We theorize that it is because 3-4 of us come in an we eat a decent amount which probably eats into the profitability of the $15 all you can eat deal. So when we paid for the upgraded $26 lunch menu, we expected the experience to improve to VIP level since the profitability would seemingly no longer be a factor for them. We were wrong. \\n\\nSo here are the problems:\\n\\n1. Long waits in between orders means you need to shell out your entire order all at once, or else you will run out of time and have to leave anyway. This is fine if you know exactly how much you will eat but if you are exploring the menu and trying a few different rolls or things, it's not so great. They also threaten to charge you if you don't eat everything, so you can't just over-order to solve this problem. \\n\\n2. Nigiri - shaved fish on top of a block of rice. The fish is almost translucent. You aren't fooling anyone here. \\n\\n3. The Sexy Girl roll used to be awesome. Unfortunately, they jam it so full of filler now, it's become disguising. The filler is this crispy, panko-like substance that tastes like saw dust. In fact, it looks like saw dust too. Then they also slather it with the spicy mayo so much that it no longer resembles spicy tuna at all. It's becomes a mayonnaise roll.\\n\\n4. The upgraded $26 lunch menu gets you sashimi. The sashimi plate with 10 different types of fish that they brought out for the group of 4 was basically an appetizer. They have a \\"rule\\" on the menu that you can't order more than 10 pieces at each time. 10 tiny pieces, that is. Only after your order comes out can you order 10 more pieces again. So when we placed our next order for sashimi it took over 40 minutes. They were obviously running the time off the clock because all that needs to be done is SLICE FISH!! We should have just went to H-Mart and sliced our own damn sashimi and it would have been a lot cheaper, since there was no way that each one of us was eating $26 worth of fish!\\n\\n5. The upgraded menu also gets you access to additional special rolls and items. The Tuna Tar Tar was foul. More of the sawdust mixed in with chopped fish in a 75% sawdust to fish ratio. The special rolls like the Godzilla roll, Tiger Roll, Rainbow roll were all disappointing. Low quality. \\n\\nPros: Tasty Crab puffs and deep fried Oreo dessert. \\n\\nSo overall we decided we won't be coming back. Hell, maybe that's what they wanted in the end anyway."},{"name":"Proof and Cooper","address":"18710 Hamilton Pool Rd","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Visited 05.21.18 at 1830.

It's also the first that I have seen.\\n\\nThis place is situated on the infamous 6th Street and next to Waller Creek. It's location is ideal since they're able to have a basement that opens up facing Waller Creek and evoke memories of San Antonio's River Walk (which I believe is the end goal of the continuing construction along the creek).\\n\\nWhen going into the entrance on 6th street, you'd see that the first floor is primarily a bake shop (you'd see all the bread making activities behind the glass) and coffee house. They have an assortment of breads and pastries to choose from, and their coffee is locally roasted from Texas Coffee Traders. All looking good, and the pastries were affirmatively good (but not great), having tried the Danish Krans, which has a apricot-glazed pastry exterior and an almond paste filling inside. I love seeing the guys at work behind the glass, carefully preparing the pieces of carb heaven.\\n\\nTake the stairs downstairs, and it'll feel like you stumbled into an aged saloon that hawks local craft beers among its large beer menu. They also proudly boast their house-made sausages, and it comes at a pretty steep price - $7 for the link on its own, and a dollar more in a pretzel bun, hot-dog style. No sides, no extras. So these must be premium sausages indeed - and I ordered the rosemary and duck/pork link (in hopes that the duck helps make up for the hefty price) - and it was perfect. The pretzel buns that came with it, however, was cold and dense, however - and felt uninspired, even though it was baked in-house. I really did not think the links were really worth it for the price, considering great sausages can be found in many places across Texas.\\n\\nThe poor showing of the pretzel buns have me concerned about the breads here - and the guy sitting next to me at the bar ordered a sandwich, and a quick survey of the bread tells me that the bread shop here needs some work. It too looks too dense, and \\"stiff,\\" if you know what I mean. Upon further investigation, I discovered that Easy Tiger is a part of the ELM Restaurant Group - basically a conglomerate that owns several restaurants in Austin. This might be the reason behind the lack of the focus in churning out top-quality breads compared to the individual bread operations, like that of Zak the Baker in Miami.\\n\\nBut that being said, I could see how this *beautiful* spot can be the place to be to drink beer, coffee, and eat some pastries - and maybe some food if they have Happy Hour going on. Happy Hour runs weekdays from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. with beer and drink specials, and food specials. They also have ping pong tables in the patio that's open and free for fun use (at least during the off hours).\\n\\nIf they don't change anything in the kitchen, then I'd like to at least suggest that they stop selling canned beers. The reason? While this place is situated beautifully by the creek, it seems to be the only creekside pub/bar and looking into the creek, I could see countless number of beer cans in the stream. It's a bit disturbing to see nature-loving Austin getting trashed, and I do think this place can do its part to keep Austin weird, and yet clean."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh my God!

If it would have been a problem, we would cancel no big deal, but it seemed like a common situation to have being a restaurant in a family neighborhood.   When she received certain plates her options were to either give me what she couldn't eat or have them left off the plate. I know it can be a pain to make an alteration to the meal based on one person, but other places took it as almost a challenge to provide a dish that was equally delicious without the certain items. They did change the cheese plate and replaced a non pasteurized cheese with one that was, and it was delicious.

This is a rarity in Portland.\\n\\n* Got seated at the bar and watched Tasty n Sons cooks in action. They are very efficient and know what they are doing.\\n\\n* Our breakfast food were so darn delicious.

Love the Biscuit & Gravy so much! The only thing that I wasn't crazy about is the Bacon wrapped dates but it's more because I'm not a big fan of sweets. It was too sweet for me but then again it's not the food fault. \\n\\n* Coffee is strong, hot, and they have Soy Milk option as the creamer. \\n\\n* Service was top notch. Very friendly, warm, and attentive. We didn't feel rush even though they had other people waiting for tables. \\n\\nThis place worth the wait and if you don't want to wait for a long time, get there before they open or right after they open because after 9:30 we saw a lot of people than before that time. \\n\\nWe will be back probably more than we should, but who cares.

No problem. We were also told that we couldn't wait inside at the bar because the restaurant was too full, and because the bouncer/owner (it wasn't really clear which, but he did mention this was \\"his\\" restaurant - for simplicity I will call him the bouncer from here on in, because clearly that's how he envisioned himself) had already made the other two parties of two wait outside, so it \\"wouldn't be fair\\". We could live with that, but when we asked if there was a list we could put ourselves on in case we wandered down the street, he just said \\"No, it's first come first serve\\", essentially forcing us to wait outside in the rain with no alternative. I was hungry and by now in the mood for Mexican, so we decided to hope for the best and wait our 20 minutes. We became annoyed when a party of five showed up after the three parties (including ourselves) waiting for a table and were immediately shown to a large table that had just become available. All of us waiting asked the bouncer why we weren't given the table, and he just replied \\"Well, they're a larger party, and that big table just opened up\\". Never mind that the \\"big table\\" was actually two small tables pushed together and the fair thing to do would have been to separate them and seat the two parties of two in front of us who arrived first. Those two parties were eventually seated, and then a party of two that showed up after us was also seated before us. By this point we were getting increasingly annoyed at being ignored and proclaimed (just loud enough for him to hear) that we were leaving in another couple of minutes. Just as I was about to give him one more chance and ask if he could give us a revised time estimate as to when our table might be ready, he suddenly proclaimed (as if it was the most brilliant and original idea since the bread basket) \\"Hey, could you guys fit into a table for two?\\" OF COURSE WE COULD!! We had suggested that from the very beginning, when he kept updating us on which tables were opening up inside! So we were finally seated (at a perfectly decent-sized table for three people, just FYI) and, now confident that he no longer had any power to further delay our dinner, I said \\"You know, you could have seated us at a table for two a while ago when you seated that party for two that arrived after us\\". He replied that those people had arrived before us, and we corrected him. Clearly if pulling out a pen and paper and writing down a first name and number of people in the party hadn't been far too much trouble, he could have kept track of those trivial details.\\n\\nAnyway, the rest of the meal was good, and there were no problems with the food or our server, but I still left annoyed at what I perceived as the bouncer's attitude of seating whomever he felt like or whichever party didn't require him to alter the seating arrangement at all, however small an effort that may have taken.\\n\\nI'm disappointed and definitely will avoid this place on a weekend night."},{"name":"Nemesis Coffee","address":"302 W Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Hip, modern coffee shop serving a selection of specialty roasters.

It wasn't our day here apparently. \\n\\nWe had a 15-20 min wait and the hostess alerted us via text that our table was ready. I love when restaurants do this. When seating us, she asked us to leave our stroller up front. No biggie, but I had some bags and such which I would need to remove as I wouldn't leave my shopping bags sitting upfront unattended. Get to my table and we're sitting in the are where the tables open up from inside to the patio....there's plenty of space on the patio side of the table that would not restrict any walking or serving areas for the wait staff....but whatever, I've already moved all of my bags out. Still smiling, this place looks great! \\n\\nWe get situated, read over the menu and narrow down what we want to eat. A little chit chat and we're still waiting about 10 min before finally being greeted by Aarielle.  She let us know that she'd seen us sit down and how long we'd been waiting, but was putting in a complicated order. She apologizes and we're like no biggie, let's eat! She takes our order, Chicken and waffles, greens, cornbread and the daily omelet along with 2 sweet teas. Still smiling....\\n\\nWe get our teas and I hold it up and take about 3 sips when the bottom of the glass literally falls from the glass. Just drops on me and hits the floor along with all of the sweet iced tea that was inside.\\nI didn't hit the glass or set it down hard or anything. I was literally just holding it. Thank God it didn't cut me. So I look down and remember those bags I took out my stroller.....all wet including my purse/diaper bag. Phones...wet. Diapers....wet. Spare outfit for my baby...wet.  Everything in my bag, basically. And I've got sweet tea dropping down my legs and on my sandals. We use what we have at the table to start cleaning up and a manager comes by and asks how we're doing. I tell him what happened and he says \\"well, ya gotta stop breaking those glasses\\"....I'm no longer smiling. I get it, he was trying to joke, but I wasn't really on joke time at that point.  I'm still polite though. He says well let me get someone to help you clean that up. Okay, cool. Guy comes to help clean up. Manager drops by again to ask if we're good as I'm still standing and wiping any cleaning everything in my bag, and my legs, shoes, etc. I tell him that everything in my bag is wet. \\"Anything ruined?\\" I respond I don't think so and that I just need to wipe everything down. Everything else can be replaced or washed so it's not ruined so to speak. Then, he says \\"I've got your meal\\". Now those are the magic words to make my inconvenience better and put a smile back on my face and momentarily forget this disaster in my bag. \\n\\nFast forward...we continue on with our brunch happily. The food was delicious. I loved the fried chix and the collard greens. Enjoying our meals and then boom, my husband knocks over his tea. Ugh! But we catch it before it spills everywhere like the broken glass but the manager probably thinks that's what happened the first time even though we give him the bottom of the other glass. I say that because we get our  check, the manager slides our card and closed the check and we paid every penny of our $57 meal. We weren't looking for the entire meal to be comped but didn't you tell us you were gonna take care of my meal. Be a man of your word. He even came over and apologized again so he basically just said that to us so we wouldn't get mad. That left a bad taste in my mouth. I've worked in the restaurant business as a waiter and trainer and even worked manger shifts from time to time and that is not how you build a good report with your guests.

The 'shrooms on toast was one of my absolute favorites with its generous portion of mushrooms tossed in a creamy, dreamy sauce and the ahi tuna carpaccio was light and delicious. If your appetite is calling for a \\"Biggie Small\\" plate, choose the provencal duck confit with beluga lentils, celery salad, and poultry jus.  It's bursting with flavor and unforgettable. The hangar steak \\"frites\\" came with great expectations, however, we found it to be improperly cooked with a severe lack of seasoning leading to much disappointment around the table. In fact, that is the only reason why I couldn't give Saltyard a perfect 5 star rating.\\n\\nI'm attending a birthday celebration here this coming weekend and can't wait to return to try more of the menu...including the desserts that we were just too full to sample last weekend.  If the amazing culinary creations and the friendliness of the waitstaff continue, Saltyard looks like it'll be an amazing place to spend a significant amount of time at this summer. Oh yes, the price is right too which is something a fine dining establishment in South Buckhead has needed for quite awhile.

His parents are first generation immigrants from a small village outside of Bari, \\"Near the heal of the boot\\" as he says. His mother is his favorite cook and he is skeptical of any boasting and claims of authenticity made by Italian restaurants and their critics. Especially those obvious places in the midst of \\"Little Italy\\". So you can imagine how dubious I was about bringing him to Boston's North End.\\n\\nWe looked online for recommendations and made a reservation at a place that looked sufficient. But after surveying the rest of the neighborhood and finding Maurizio's, we cancelled our reservation at the other place. Manny, accompanied by his lovely girlfriend Kerri, just had a vibe about it. Call it an Italian 6th sense, an \\"Old- World Radar\\", whatever. He liked the place. He felt at home there.\\n\\nThis is just one of the nice things about Maurizio's. The waiters were friendly and family-like. Attentive but not intrusive. And after sending a bottle of wine back because it just didn't taste right, we were accommodated with a new bottle and not charged for it. Without hesitation. The people at Maurizio's know that if you don't like the wine, you're not going to have a good meal. They seem genuinely concerned with everyone having a great meal. .. Just like an Italian mother would! \\n\\nIt is easy to get lost in the overwhelming landscape of Italian eateries, cafes, and pastry shops in the North End, but this little gem is really worth the visit. Take it from my friend Manny who sucked down a couple of appetizers and a big plate of pasta, all the while saying, with genuine surprise, \\"This is really good.\\""},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"To say my expectations of Beast were sky-high could be an understatement. I'd had amazing experiences at similar fixed-menu restaurants (Cinc Sentits in Barcelona; Schwa in Chicago) -- so when The Mister and I went to Portland to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, Beast was a natural choice. Besides, I saw the phrase \\"foie gras bon bon\\" and nearly shat myself. How could we go wrong? \\n\\nThe meal started off quite well with a chilled cucumber and creme fraiche soup, topped with a dainty scoop of dungeness crab. Very refreshing, given the warm, humid weather. \\n\\nThe charcuterie plate was next, consisting of eight items including the much-anticipated foie gras bon bon, which was topped with a gelee made from Sauternes wine. The bon bon itself was slightly gritty and lacking in that velvety mouthfeel that I associate with foie gras. And it was REALLY salty. FAIL. The other charcuterie plate items were good, if nothing to write home about.\\n\\nThe entree, pork cheeks, were similarly quite salty. (Maybe there was a blue light special on salt at the market that week?). It was accompanied by a perfectly flaky potato and creme fraiche turnover, which made up for the oversalty pork cheeks a little.\\n\\nThe only other standout dish among the rest of the courses was the pork belly, served with a little salad of shaved radish and parsley. That beautiful cube of perfectly marbled pork fat and meat practically redeemed all the shortcomings of the courses that preceded it. And the radish and parsley salad? Brilliant -- the lush texture and taste of the pork belly really made the flavors and texture of the parsley salad pop. Oh, yeah. \\n\\nI definitely recommend getting the wine pairing, though beware if you're a lightweight -- the pours are generous, and I was definitely loopy by the fifth course. \\n\\nThe service was great, though I was not too into the communal-seating style of my table. I'd been hoping for a more romantic, intimate dinner. However, at least our table-mates were nice and interesting enough, so it wasn't as painful as it could have been. \\n\\nI'd definitely like to go back the next time I'm in Portland.

You can feed two people, including two beers & soft drinks for under $40. I've been to many a BBQ place in Orlando, & that's definitely a steal.\\n\\nThe food is GOOD. Not great, but you can easily taste the different flavors & car put into the smoked meats & sides. I could live without the fries, as they lacked any taste. But I've had almost everything on the menu, & have no complaints.\\n\\nThe street corn. LORD. It's so dang good. With cotija cheese, butter, & green onions, I about DIED. Order it to go. Seriously. Last time I was here I drove home munching on some.\\n\\nThe customer service is wonderful, the cashiers, waiters/waitresses are very attentive, & I love having my food brought to me after I order.\\n\\nNow, the cons. And I hate even going into these cause there's no way these changes will be made unless they choose a different location.\\n\\nThe place is SMALL. I'm talking sitting on top of everyone in the place small. There is an entrance where you can either grab a menu, or look at the one on the wall & memorize your order, but you honestly don't have to as it's just a short walk to the register. With the place being so small, & being frequented by couples & folks with dogs (who are always outside), a line can form quickly, & can go out the door & through the outdoor seating area.\\n\\nThey are always out of menus. Folks grab them and take them to the register, but no one ever brings them back to the entrance, so you either get out of line so you can see the full menu, or you squint from the register. I just opted to look at the menu on my phone.\\n\\nIt can get super loud. It's a small place, the kitchen & bar are RIGHT THERE, as well as the testosterone, dining area, front door, outdoor seating, street, parking lot.... you get the drift, it's a tiny place.\\n\\nAnd that leads me to my final con, parking. It's almost nonexistent. There are about 8 spaces behind the building. Maybe 2 in front, no back street parking or additional parking whatsoever. We ended up driving around, then just parking on a grassy area near the restaurant. No big whoop, but it can get frustrating. I have an SUV & trying to park & maneuver in that little lot can be a chore.\\n\\nOther than that, would I eat here again? Absolutely. The food is good, the quantity for what you pay makes sense, & its in Mills50, an area I'm in love with.

You order ground pork and that's pretty much what you get, a small bowl of ground pork. Although it did come with a side of rice for $13 I expected a bit more. The table in front of me also ordered it and they looked at each other saying, 'is that it'?

Afraid to be disappointed by any other cooked items.     \\nThe sushi - I reason I came here.    They got smaller, not the rice, but the fish.   It's about half the size that I remembered from previous visits.    The salmon is not as fresh as previously experienced.    The tuna was okay.     Eel avocado handrolls was heavy on the sauce, but little on the eel.   Spicy tuna was okay, but again, it didn't taste fresh.     On the rainbow roll,  I didn't think you are supposed to see the rice when looking from above.   The fish on top were small and could barely cover the top of the roll.   \\n\\nI hate to give up on what I thought was a little gem hidden in the back of Cummings Park, but I am afraid to be disappointed again if I go back.

It was a bad sign when I got there and there were no samosas on the buffet. I can tell the owner of this place is cheap, so I tried to order one figuring it was just a scheme to make more money, but they didn't have any prepared at all. \\n\\nNow to the buffet:\\n\\nThe Saag Paneer- \\nThe paneer was soggy, not browned, and the spinach used was admittedly frozen. All this may have been overcome by proper seasoning, but the dish was just bland. This is actually one of my favorite Indian dishes, so it was shocking to see this poor of a showing by two \\"traditional\\" Indian cooks -- Indian Mothers, none-the-less. This is not the first time that they have tried to take shortcuts and the food has suffered. I attended one of the opening nights with a date and was served an \\"amuse bouche\\" (waiter's words, not mine) that consisted of processed cheese cubes and canned fruit cocktail on a toothpick. That's a whole other story, though. Onwards...\\n\\nThe Tale of Two Chicken Dishes- \\nTandoori chicken was completely bland and so overcooked that I considered that it might be reheated from the night before, and the restaurant had not even been open for two hours at this point. The rub looked bright but the dish itself had zero flavor with the texture of rubber..  \\nThen there was another chicken dish that was in a brown gravy that actually was quite tasty, despite the fact that I suspect it had flour in it (cheap route again). My  stomach can vouch for me.\\nThe killing blow to both dishes is the cut of the chicken. \\nBones. Sticking. Out. Everywhere. \\nI had to give up trying to eat it after being unable to avoid sharp 1-2 inch pieces of chicken bone in my food and there were small children eating at this place! They could get seriously hurt! Not a joke. Scary stuff. \\nWhat rings through? Cheap, unauthentic, and lack of care.\\n\\nThe dessert dish, which was seemingly a \\"take\\" on sticky rice pudding, tasted like cream of wheat. They attempted to disguise it with tumeric (or food coloring!), but the proof was in the pudding.... or lack there of.\\n\\nNot everything was a loss though, I did actually enjoy two or three dishes, in the \\"I'm already here, might as well see it through\\" spirit. These were the Chana Masala, the beef in brown gravy, and the spicy cabbage dish (which I would say was the best item in the whole buffet spread.)\\n\\nIf the \\"Modern Spin\\" they're talking about on their website is that you can make Indian Food much unhealthier and cheaper in America and get away with it, then they have put it very nicely. However if that's what I wanted, I would have stopped by Taco Bell instead. \\n\\nThe bottom line is that they seem to be trying to cut too many corners while charging higher prices than most other Indian restaurants in Austin, and they consistently fail to deliver the quality necessary. \\n\\nTwo solutions: Improve the quality of ingredients, or lower the prices. \\nI hope the management can take this as seriously as I take my search for good food."},{"name":"Hop's Chicken","address":"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Really bad experience.

But the first great impression came as we opened the door and entered the restaurant; the amazing smell of delicious food was intoxicating and I wanted to eat everything in the menu. The prices were reasonable and the service was good. \\n\\nWe came for brunch and ordered the chicken and waffles which were hands down the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. The waffles were made out of cornbread and after having these, I will never be able to have regular waffles ever again. They were out of this world delicious. The chicken was juicy, tender, and oh so flavorful. We also had the butcher's hash which was also very rich, flavorful and full of pork goodness. Lastly we tried the chicken liver toast, and although we enjoyed the dish, there was a pungent taste I believe in the chicken liver mousse (perhaps a type of cheese?) that threw us off a bit. The truffle in the scrambled eggs was a nice touch however. \\n\\nOverall we had a great experience and will definitely be returning if we visit Orlando again in the future."},{"name":"Saltyard","address":"1820 Peachtree St NW, Ste 1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Loved our waitress, Paige.

The other was a choice of sustainable fish, with a qinuoa salad and creamy herb dressing. Was very light and fresh, but there was just so much fish it overpowered the bowl by the end. Last was the dessert. We ordered the blueberry cream cheese mousse. It was so pretty! The banana custard on top tasted sour and nothing like banana. There was a square of I think green tea flavored white chocolate, some reduced passion fruit sauce and almost like a motchi of blueberry cream cheese with a neon blue shiny outer coating. \\n\\nYou could sit inside or out.

She told us over and over how understaffed they were that night.  At first, we all felt bad for her, but after awhile it came off as passing the buck for shoddy service.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  We did receive the drinks, after having to tell the waitress what was in a cosmo, because the bartender was too busy to make them, so she made them. We placed our main course orders while waiting for our appetizer.  We waited quite a while for our food.  Then she brings out the main dishes.  One of the dishes was not what my friend had ordered.  The waitress apologized, and took it back to the kitchen.  Two minutes later, she came back with the same dish!  My friend just took it, and said \\"whatever\\".  We did not want to be late for the concert.  My dish of pasta with eggplant and chicken was pretty good.  As for the appetizer, never did receive it.  The waitress once again apologized, blaming it once again on being short staffed.  To try to make up for it, she brought us out one slice of chocolate cake that we did not even ask for, that she told us was on the house.  Like that would make our bad experience better somehow.  Well no one wanted the cake, but two of us decided to at least try it.  Well, as one reviewer had warned, the cake was ice cold, and tasted like it had freezer burn.  Yuck!  Worse cake ever.

I live in San Diego I have been to mexico a number of times. This place so much wrong. \\n\\nCorona with Lime please!\\n\\nOk so we had a big group apparently there is a group menu we could only order from which was small. So when it came time for me to order I was 4th to order from a group of 18. I had questions so I asked if the meat in the burrito was shredded or chunked the waitressed looked and me and said it was \\"GROUND BEEF\\"  Now I really don't feel like ordering. but I shrugged it off and asked for a Chimichangas.\\n\\nChips and Salsa. The guacamole was a green mayo and the salsa was an orange sweet and sour hot mix. Chips were only thing worth it. \\n\\nSo good 20 minutes go by and the people that got in last got their order first, I'm the only one sitting there with nothing. Waitress comes up and said they made a 3Beef tacos and not my Chimichanga if I like that they will give it to me half off or they can whip up my chimichange real fast. As I was starving.\\n\\n3 large beef tacos was beef chunks no marination just cooked meat. I took as many limes as I could and put it on the meat. The Rice was under cooked and my beans just weren't right they had some veggies on the side but wasn't worth it. I complained about it and the waitress offered me the Chimichanga as a replacement. As my group finishes their food I still haven't gotten mine. Another waitress brings out a group behind us but drops the plate on accident behind our group and food flying all over one of our parties Canadian Goose Jacket (Didn't know how much this Jacket was worth till I looked it up) I guess my plate was in that group that fell. They scrambled and finally I get a Chimichanga with an orange and Green sauce I have never seen before. plus it was small I finished it in 4 bites. Sadly I was charged half price for my food which wasn't even worth it. I was highly disappointed. The food wasn't worth it the options were poor and they messed up my order. As someone that has grown up on mexican food this was a completely lose for words and a sorry excuse in my mind. I will not go to this place ever again.

We spent about an hour at Little Trouble and managed to try a good cross-section of the menu: both the pork and beef steamed buns, crab dumplings, shishito peppers, pork meatballs, and a couple of cocktails. \\n\\nThe steamed buns still take top honors, in my opinion. Not to say the rest were bad, no sir, it was all quite good, but those steamed buns are the go-to items. I love shishito peppers and these were big, juicy, and just right on heat. The lemongrass pork meatballs were tender, with the lemongrass flavor playing strong. The crab dumplings were just okay. I think I expected more filling and less crunchy shell. \\n\\nOn the beverage front, I had an Improved Whiskey Cocktail and a Bobo T. Baggins. I thoroughly enjoyed the Improved Whiskey Cocktail, but the Bobo T Baggins lacked the kick I was hoping for in a drink that included habanero in its ingredients. My favorite so far would still be the Found Art, though. \\n\\nWhereas last time I sat at the bar, this time we hung out in the lounge area on the other side of the hallway.

The husbands had a couple of drinks and they seemed to enjoy those as well :)\\n\\nPLAY: After we ate it was time to play some games. We all got something off the eat and play combo menu so we had a $10 Power Card to play the games. I agree with on reviewer that says this is like a dressed up Chuck E Cheese since most of the people playing games were pretty young. Despite that fact it wasn't hard to play a game that you had your eye on. Most people were pretty good about not spending 30 minutes on one game. We ended up winning almost 900 tickets and walked away with a mini D&B basketball for our toddler and a D&B cup leaving about 60 points on our card. \\n\\nOverall it was a good night out with our tab being about $75 including gratuity and hubby rounded that on up to $80 so our waitress received about a $14 tip just from my family alone. I'd go to this D&B again and try to leave the children at home or put our infant in a stroller so I could really get my hoop on ( he was strapped to my chest in his Moby Wrap)!"},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Thursday night dinner out, great location and cool ambiance.

It has one of those modern industrial converted warehouse feels to it, which I can't get enough of in cities.  The ceiling is incredibly high, allowing for great ventilation so it doesn't get too hot and stuffy.

I ordered a bloody mary hoping it wouldn't be too spicy, but was told they use a bloody mary pre-mix and they'd try to use more tomato juice to lessen the heat.  If I could knock off half a star for the pre-mix, I might, given the quality of the rest of the food in a restaurant like this, and their specialty bloody mary menu, I kind of expected them to be made from scratch.  I ended up getting a mimosa instead, which was beautiful and tasted great!  http://bit.ly/14XetPv\\n\\nThe whole meal was done family style, which I honestly love. We ordered the Chocolate Potato Doughnut, Cast Iron Frittata, Fried Egg n Cheddar Biscuit with Fried Chicken, Burmese Red Pork Stew, Blackberry French Toast, and Polenta & Sausage Ragu.  My favorite was the Burmese Red Pork Stew, followed by the Blackberry French Toast.  I probably wouldn't order the Cast Iron Frittata again.  It wasn't horrible, but compared to the rest of phenomenal treats we feasted on, it came in dead last as far as taste-bud orgasms go.\\n\\nThis easily satisfied three people, and it was brought out staggered so we could pick through our feast and enjoy the company as well as the food.

The parking lot was crowded on this Saturday afternoon so that was a good sign that the place was at least popular. We walked in (5 of us)  and was greeted by no one. We decided to seat ourselves but had to push two tables together which I don't like doing cause that makes a waitress lose a separate check. We were told by the waitress who happened by and helped put the tables together that she would be right with us. There were only two waitresses working and one of the tables ahead of us was an 11 top. We were not handed so much as a glass of water or menus for at least 15 minutes and another \\"I'll be right with you.\\" \\n\\nI understand that the waitresses were swamped. The right thing for them to do would have been to inform the manager so that he could help pick up the slack. Instead, we sat and waited.\\n\\nWe finally got menus and drinks. Several minutes later our orders were taken and it seemed like things would improve. The smell of other food being delivered was nice and promising.\\n\\nWe finally get our food. The appetizer was brought out with the entree which the waitress admitted was her fault because she put them in at the same time. The entree was the stuffed skins which should have been a home run appetizer. Potato halves stuffed with onion, brisket, cheese etc. yummy! But unfortunately they were way overcooked and ruined. Girlfriend's mom ordered pork sandwich but they brought her beef. Girlfriend's father said no onions but got plenty. I said medium on the burger but it was well and too dry to enjoy.\\n\\nWe summoned the manager, Joe, who promptly came to our table and after letting us get halfway through our woes immediately said the tab was on him. He didn't make anything right but he did relieve us of the check. Ultimately he should have done both. Also it did seem that we were only able to get halfway through our complaints because he was just interested in ending the conversation as opposed to really addressing the problems. Paying the tab takes care of our otherwise poor investment but does nothing to solve the real problems which will likely continue if there isn't more sincere concern.\\n\\nI also gave the waitress my feedback. She was kind enough to listen to all of it and made -no- excuses. (Joe made none either but I don't feel like he really felt like there was anything to fix.) I felt like the waitress cared more than the manager.\\n\\nThe restaurant was decently clean and maintained. Bathrooms do need some work. Prices were a teeny tiny high for what they offered but if their products would come out like they are supposed to, it's a price you would be willing to pay. Unfortunately that was not our experience. Final observation was that the uniforms for the staff is meant to be comfortable, laid back and apparently a little sexy. One of the waitresses there took it a little to far but wearing cutoff shorts that left her cheeks in the open for all to see as she loaded ice into my drink and walked about. It's ok to cater to make clientele by using a sexy female body but keep it on the classy side, not the trashy.

The burger came out loaded with the toppings that we specifically asked to not be on it. We had told our waiter/bartender that it would be totally fine if we could just have a replacement bun brought out that wasn't drenched in the toppings we didn't want. They insisted on bringing out a new burger which is a great offer,  but when we just waited 45 minutes for the first burger that certainly didn't seem like a great option to us. We ensured them just a new bun would be fine, mostly because we were starving and just didn't want to wait any longer. I think a nice gesture would have been to give a small discount on the bill for the mistake, but that didn't happen. I don't even think there was much of an apology. \\n\\nIf you have to eat here for some reason, one of the flatbreads is probably the way to go.

Their grilled cheese had a couple of different \\"gourmet\\" cheese on it and was one of the better grilled cheese I've had, period.  It was grilled just the right amount and absolutely perfect for dipping into a delicious soup.  I also tried their stuffed portobello mushroom, which was amazing.  It was stuffed with so many different veggies and piled so high (a welcome change from other places that put a little filling in the cap and call it \\"stuffed\\") that it was almost hard to eat.  The grilled vegetables inside were amazing, especially the little bites of Brussels sprouts.  YUM.\\n\\nBut the highlight of what I tried there was, without a doubt, their curried roasted cauliflower with golden raisins.  Sounds awful, I know.... but it was amazing.

Ten minutes later (when we were about to just leave), she returned and told us a table had just opened up for us.  When we were brought to the table, we discovered even more empty tables.  Some never even filled up the entire time we were there, making me wonder why we couldn't have been seated immediately.

Definitely one of my favorites from my weekend trip to Vancouver - I will definitely be back!\\n\\nFew places offer a triple threat: great coffee, food, and ambiance. 49th Parallel delivers on all 3 of these, and more. \\n\\nThe coffee: I had the Venezuelan, and it was phenomenal. The coffee was bright and flavorful, with just a little spicy cinnamon kick. I have pretty high expectations of coffee in general (I blame the Seattle upbringing) - and this place can compete with the best of 'em. Take that, Seattle coffee snobs! \\n\\nThe food: Lucky donuts. No words can fully describe how unique and delicious these little pieces of heaven are. I had the matcha, which I loved. Never had a matcha donut before, and now because of 49th Parallel it'll probably be an item I'll continue to crave. So good. Also sampled some of the blueberry lemon which was also great. The fillings here are so true to flavor, and somehow the donuts are not too sweet. We also ordered the beignets, which are made to order and came out hot. Fantastic.\\n\\nThe ambiance: Despite being pretty crowded on a Sunday morning, there was a ton of seating to accommodate everyone (and different types of seating too: outdoor patio, wooden community table, small tables for couples, and booth seating). Surprisingly not overrun with hipsters when I visited too; there were a good number of families just hanging out. The space itself is a converted garage, and it maintains an industrial vibe while incorporating a lot of hardwood and teal accents. Manages to be trendy and yet pretty cozy at the same time.\\n\\n49th Parallel fulfills all of my wildest dreams.

The burger was okay I guess and my first 2 bites I thought was no better than a double whopper but the meat and bun was actually edible without giving me the runs. The cheat was melted and my bun looked like it has been sat on like a regular soggy fast food joint such as Burger King. The free peanuts were fine but annoyed again that there is a rule if you take peanuts and don't finish em, you are forced to throw shat u didn't eat away or they might put em back which I think is very wasteful. I personally think when the Frack Burger was still in business...it was much better and your meal would have actually came with frys like it supposed to. Meh on my part.

They offer you wine with Asian dishes, which was a first for me, and not something I was willing to try. I ended up ordering a Thai iced tea, which was delicious.\\n\\nI'd recommend the Samosas for appetizers. I was really pleased with them, and was expecting the same for the entree. I was wrong. The Kapitan Chicken was OK, although it was a bit strong on the lemongrass. What I really had a problem with was the Pad See You. Having had this dish at many restaurants before, I knew what to expect, and it was not what I got. There was a very bizarre flavor akin to breakfast sausage in this dish, and my friend and I ended up not finishing it, even though we were absolutely famished.\\n\\nThis all could have been overlooked had it not been for the absolutely awful service. It took the waiter about 20 minutes to get us our drinks the first time, and then we had to call him over to get another round and finally the check so that we could leave and go home to eat.

So I tipped.  Which seems crazy.  I would never tip at Costco.  All in all, without any drinks, I spent $44 for two plain hotdogs, two of their more snazzy sausages and a salad.  Total ripoff that didn't taste very good.  You weren't even paying for atmosphere as the doors were wide open so it was freezing and fruit flies were flying around everywhere.   Plus, if you eat in, they serve your sausage in a high-sided box, which is pretty hard to eat out of.

Again, might be a good choice for folks aiming for more lean protein and veggies in their diet. I'm usually not all that excited about tuna and salmon, but I must say that this was AMAZINGLY fresh seafood. Perfectly seasoned. Usually I don't like dishes that contain tunafish with lettuce, but the flavors are just right! Portion is very generous, enough to be an entree. Also there's the price. I don't think I've ever spent less on a meal of sushi for two, unless I were buying it at the grocery store/Asian market. \\n\\nMy hubby went with the standard sushi sampler, but here's the kicker - All the choices of fish in the sampler were the ones we actually LIKE. It was roughly $10. WOW!

Holy Taco is the first place I've tried that really made me say, \\"Wow.\\"  On my first visit, I tried the skirt steak entree with a side of butter beans and creamed corn.  Three extremely well-composed and well-executed dishes.  The notoriously thin and easily over-cooked skirt steak was prepared *exactly* how I liked it, just a shade on the rare side of medium-rare.  Cooked through, but still cool and red.  The cilantro, almonds, salsa verde, and onion marmalade that barely topped the the sliced steak was portioned perfectly to complement the meat without overwhelming it.  The butter beans were fantastic.  The pieces of sauteed lardon gave them the right amount of salty smokiness and the oven-roasted-'till-they-pop jewel-box tomatoes gave them a perfectly contrasting sweetness. Finally, the creamed corn with the white lardon, scallions, and cayenne was every bit as good as the butter beans.

Fortunately we got in with the first flow of people even without a reservation.  When we left, we overhead the wait time as 45min-1hour!\\n\\n2) They describe their service as \\"family style\\".  Basically this means the kitchen sends out the dishes as they are made and they don't wait for the rest of your table's food to be ready.  The \\"family style\\" of it isn't the portion sizes (regular sized) its that your friends/family at the table will want to share your food while they are waiting for theirs.

It doesn't have carts (THE HORROR. I KNOW.), but honestly that might be what I like best about it - no carts means they make everything fresh and it comes straight to you from the kitchen. The space is tiny, cramped, and stuffed to the gills with people, especially on the weekends so get there either really early (like, at opening time), or go at an awkwardly-late time of day (2-3pm) if you don't want to wait. If you're part of a small group (2-3 people), you'll likely have to share a table with another small party.\\n\\nFood-wise, I won't go into too many specifics, but the chicken feet, fried pork dumplings (the football-shaped ones), and the rice noodle rolls with the fried dough inside are some of my absolute favorites. Everything comes out steaming hot and fresh, and I truthfully haven't ordered a single thing I didn't like. \\n\\nThis would be a perfect 5 star if it weren't for a few (minor, in my opinion) service issues. Don't go expecting good or even half-decent service.

I was not expecting the service and the food to be THAT good. I went here a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend on a lunch date. We wanted to try something different so he mentioned Pig Floyd's. I was a little skeptical, especially after reading Yelp reviews about the crowded seating. I definitely didn't want to just stand around during my lunch break, but I figured it was worth a shot. When we arrived, the small parking lot was full but there's a small street behind the building you can park on and it wasn't out of the way. A lot of people were sitting outside because it was nice out. They have a nice outdoor deck that seems well kept. When we walked in, we found the menus immediately in front of the door. We placed our order and got our table number and drinks. Their sweet tea... Phenomenal. Coming from a true southern sweet tea addict- do order their tea. My boyfriend noticed something else pretty rad on their menu: jarritos! We have to buy those at the store usually so he didn't pass up on the mandarin one. We talked as we waited for our food. Our food was out and commenced with stuffing our faces. The food was on point. I was extremely impressed with the brisket and my boyfriend loved his combo. I devoured the yuca. If you're curious about the sauce, I actually used make a baja sauce like it at home, which is why I recognized the flavor and it made me smile. It has a little tang with a medium bite to it. So if you're a sissy with spices, I don't recommend, but if you can tolerate a jalape√±o, you can handle this sauce. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. They checked on us a couple times, offering refills and to-go boxes and if everything was cooked to our liking. They were definitely on top of keeping the place clean. Someone would get up and a staff member would be wiping down that table asap. Overall, I definitely recommend this place.

Also, the portions are huge so you can get away with splitting most dishes (especially when you're having dessert). We've also never gotten very good service at this location. Most of the waiters and waitresses are surly and have an apathetic attitude (although I'd imagine waiting tables here is very, very stressful considering the huge volume of customers flowing in the door at all times, so I can kind of understand why they aren't beaming with excitement). The only true complaint that I have is that if you get cheesecake to go, they will give you a very small slice that's probably 1/3 of the size that it would be if you ordered it in the restaurant.

Devilishly delicious but killer on the diet.\\n\\nHop's Chicken inside the Ponce City Market food hall is probably one of your most affordable options. The menu and prices are on the wall next to the register for all to see. I had a hard time deciding how much exactly I wanted to eat... So I ended up ordering a la carte: I got a chicken breast (Nashville style) and a chicken thigh. Note if you want them both Nashville style outside of a combo, it will cost extra. I also splurged with an order of Mac and cheese. \\n\\nI was so freaking excited. My food came out relatively quickly - it took me a while in the line, so it took about the same time to get my order. It ended up coming out in two bags, thus making me appear to be a fatty. There are some hot sauces at the pick up counter for your fried chicken dining convenience. \\n\\nSeating is somewhat plentiful in the PCM if you're not scared of communal dining - aka sharing a table with strangers. We were lucky enough to get a table for ourselves. \\n\\nThe chicken breast was BORDERLINE dry. Because it was warm, it seemed tender enough to swallow. It was bathed in the Nashville style spice, which was definitely very spicy. I decided to take this to go and eat later. Why did I decide to take it to go? Because I ended up with THREE pieces of chicken instead of two. Why? They got confused as to whether I wanted a spicy chicken breast or regular breast. So I ended up with one hot AND one regular, along with my original thigh order. It was so awkward hearing them call to the back \\"Tiffany's breast is HOT! Tiffany's breast is hot!\\" I was the only one who seemed to notice, though...\\n\\nThe thigh was just juicy enough. I love when the juices of the dark meat dribble down my chin or fingers. It wasn't quite that, but it had just enough to satisfy my fried chicken craving. \\n\\nThe Mac and cheese was just ok. Might not be worth the splurge. \\n\\nOverall, my fried chicken craving was satiated by my meal at Hop's Chicken. It helped that they gave me an extra chicken breast, but in general, the chicken wasn't bad. I just can't give them a three star after their free accidental chicken breast and not only that, but calling my breast \\"hot.\\" Not the best fried chicken by far, but enough to give their fried chicken a try."},{"name":"Saporito's","address":"11 Rockland Cir","city":"Hull","stars":"4","text":"I have to admit that I have heard nothing but rave reviews for Saporito's and yet this was one of the worst dining experiences we have had in a long time.  \\n\\nFirst, walking in to the restaurant was like walking into a breakfast place on the cape.

It needs to be featured on Boston burger wars - and I'm pretty confidant that it will win! Better than even a steakhouse burger - and cheaper! Also the $28 bottle wine list is phenomenal - great price, not too many downtown bars offer bottles this cheap (equates to about $8 a glass - which is a steal!). The margherita pizza and calamari is also delicious! The atmosphere is beautiful, breathtaking  - great for a girl's night or a date and happy hour (and not expensive! The decor may throw some people off into thinking its pricey but the prices are actually a good deal! The beautiful chandelier decor is a bonus!). I'm in the culinary industry and can safely say that is my favorite restaurant in Boston! Especially in downtown Boston. I've celebrated my culinary school graduation here with my brother and he loved it (especially the 49 Social burger - and he's from Texas where steaks and meats are suppose to be incomparable).

It's like eating a cracker instead of a pizza.  And surprisingly, the thin crust is almost always soggy and doughy.  It shouldn't be hard to make the crust crispy, but for some reason every slice I've had here is floppy and chewy.\\n\\nAlso, while their ingredients appear fresh, they really skimp on the amount of toppings.

The fermenters loom through the windows behind the taps as one of the staff will take your order from the queue that often wends its way out the door.

This lends the final product a unique terroir specific to the region in which it was brewed, and Jester King takes pride in both its Texas roots and old world traditions.

He asked whether we had a table, which we didn't and then once again refused to let him in.  There wasn't one other person outside.  There was PLENTY of room inside.

I don't know how anyone gets a table.  \\nThey have a bar across the street where they don't serve main courses, just appetizers?  If you don't get there when they first open, good luck.  You'll be waiting a while.  You're better off on getting a bunch of friends together so you can make a reservation, they take them for parties of 6 or more, otherwise you'll be wasting your time waiting.  My opinion is if you really want to eat here, get it to go, same great taste with a fraction of the wait.  I was a party of one and wanted to eat there.\\nI had to wait 2 1/2 hours, and every time I walked in they had an small empty table for an hour and a half of that time.  But pointing that out to the hostess (who was very nice) was useless as she couldn't formulate a full sentence on why it was vacant.  Thankfully she went to the back and the waiter there saw this and managed to seat me and I ate and left, but poor hostess skills were in full effect.  \\nAfter all that, what can I say, Lobster Ravioli was amazing, comes with a salad and bread.

The poor execution shows that they are lacking serious and honest feedback. \\n\\nFor starters - the entire taco menu should be axed.

The tortillas were so thick, cold and chewy that they alone ruined any filling. \\n\\nThe taco with sausage and shrimp was poorly conceived and the sauce really doesn't work with shrimp and sausage. \\n\\nThe butter chicken taco was the only decent one I had but was so cold that it was more like leftover Indian food and didn't have a hint of spicy heat to it at all. \\n\\nThe pork belly taco was ok but could use more seasoning and flavor to it. Pork belly is a really flavorful cut, but this was almost purposefully masked. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the plain Jane sandwich and was moderately satisfied. The pork was rather dry (especially compared to bbq down the street at 4Rivers) and not enough sauce to moisten it. \\n\\nThe side of sweet plantains was really the only high point. Most sweet plantains I have get the sweet flavor right but rarely do they have the crispy edges that Pig Floyds nailed.  \\n\\nThis review is meant not so much to be negative, as much as it is to be a wake up call to the restaurant to reevaluate some of your dishes and particularly to throw out every tortilla left in your pantry.

Don't be a server/bartender/barista. There are plenty of people in other states who would shit themselves over making minimum wage plus tips, it's seriously $4.77 plus tip in Florida, those people actually have to work for a tip. \\n\\nPlease Portland service people, pull the collective stick out of your asses and cheer up at work, or just find a different effing job.\\n\\n\\n08/27/13\\n\\nAlright, so here's an update to this review in response to the owner's interesting comments:\\n\\nI actually did compliment your restaurant by saying that the pizza was very good, just that the attitude of one server was mind-bogglingly horrible, which it was. I should have said that the server who came to pick up the bill after we had split it up had a much better, polite attitude, but that skipped my mind due to irritation.\\n\\nInstead of writing a response possibly apologizing for the service, or at least explaining that it was a fluke and there are many other positive reviews that other people have posted, you tell a disgruntled customer that they should work on this with their therapist? I can see why you'd have no issue employing someone who would yell loudly enough to be heard from the kitchen to the back patio over an overlooked policy on payment.\\n\\nNo one in our group gave the waitress \\"a hard time\\", and we also weren't seated at a large table. We were seated in the back patio at two table that were close to each other, which worked perfectly fine and we had no issue with it. There were no big issues with the service (it was ok, not amazing, not bad), until the bill came and the waitress was visibly and vocally irritated. That's not \\"gracious\\" service, and if anybody needs a therapist, it's the person who can't control themselves at your workplace. Customers don't read everything, you can't tell me it's the first time, we weren't skipping on the bill, we apologized for not observing it, and we wrote our individual totals on the back of the bill, so all that had to happen was for it to get rung up and we could pay for it. What horrible people we were!\\n\\nWe also had 6 people in our group, two couples and two single people, providing 4 cards to be run. So yes, there were more than two cards for that check, but there we were still apparently in line with your policy of two cards per table, right? \\n\\nOn a side note, since you're writing as if you were there first-hand, and we were destroying your policies, and giving your waitress \\"a hard time\\", why didn't you come to the table to deal with such a monstrous group of customers, or possibly calm an agitated waitress down?\\n\\nHow would I like someone to review me and my work product? I get reviewed every day by co-workers and supervisors, and periodically by the FDA because I'm involved in a process that verifies the safety of life-saving medications. \\n\\nYou're making a comment about someone critiquing your establishment, on a site that exists in order to critique places, what did you expect? Or are people only allowed to leave nice comments about your place?

Frankly, I believe they should come up with their own name for this dish. Then, any preconceived idea of  what Oysters  Rockefeller should be  won't leave you as disappointed as I was. I have always loved oysters Rockefeller and even though the preparation was  adequately explained by the waiter, I don't think I was able to conceptualize the difference.\\n\\n\\nThe second appetizer was the cheese souffl√©. Unfortunately,  it was also bland.

Strangely, the person that seated us asked us what we wanted to drink before we even sat down at the table or looked at a menu, which really didn't bother me, but was definitely unusual. We ordered a grapefruit juice and an apple juice. The grapefruit juice is definitely Ocean Spray Ruby Red, and pretty sure the apple juice was Mott's. \\n\\nThe ambience is a bit dated but still clean and nice. The breakfast menu options were varied and well priced. I looked on Yelp and noticed that the tamales and eggs were recommended as well as the Benedicts. \\n\\nFirst off, our food arrived promptly.\\n\\nI ordered the pork tamales and eggs, which comes with hash browns and eggs any style, but also is covered in your choice of mild or spicy green chili. The green chili had a strange gummy texture to it, as if it had been thickened with a cornstarch slurry or something similar. My scrambled eggs were cooked low and slow without color which was nice, but were overcooked and dry. The hash browns are definitely not home-made and just griddled and they were undercooked.\\n\\nMy fianc√© ordered the classic eggs benedict. As a cook myself, I can tell when hollandaise is made fresh / properly, or if someone uses a packet and holds it warm. I feel like the Garden Cafe uses the latter option unfortunately. One of her poached eggs was cooked perfectly, the other the whites weren't quite set and the yolk was overly runny (she loves runny eggs). \\n\\nOverall, our bill was only $25, which is completely reasonable for breakfast. As we left we noticed multiple groups waiting for tables as the remaining tables had filled while we were eating. I don't understand how this place captures 4 stars on yelp whatsoever.

The guy who gave me my food needed to staple the bag for my sandwich shut for some reason.  To be honest, there wasn't really anything that stood out that would make me want to go back.  \\n\\nAside from a cheap menu and not knowing what kind of food they serve now, I have no idea why I would go back.  I got a Turkey Bacon Club.  It was really a shitty looking sub with turkey, and day old dried bacon on it.  Nothing about it said Club to me.  Club sandwich is usually three slices of bread, this was a sub roll.

I had a great Merc Perks certificate and knew the $12.50 I spent for $25 worth of food would be well spent.

Shucks ..next time\\n\\nOur meal arrived and my mom and I quickly split our plates so we each could try.  My biscuits nice and fluffy, whith thick sausage gravy, with a bit if kick to it, I'm thinking cayenne, but could be Aardvark sauce ... This dish is like many other biscuits and gravy, but was still good. However, I must say, I devoured my half of my moms french toast.  It comes with (on the side) fresh berries (I passed), maple syrup, and fresh vanilla bean whip cream... Its was really good. They prepared the french toast on top of the stove first and finished it off in the oven. Its was moist and decadent..almost like a dessert.  We both finished off the plates and were stuffed...

If it's not obvious already, I do my research, so I knew it would be busy and I knew we were in for a pretty decent wait.  I made sure everyone in our party was aware that we would be waiting.  We are all restaurant folk so we knew we could manage a wait as long as we could mingle by the bar for a cocktail or ten.

After walking around the neighborhood, we got a call that our table was ready and we were seated across from the open kitchen. I have issues with restaurants that say that their menu is family style and meant for sharing, when some of the dishes clearly aren't for sharing. A small plate of eggs, a biscuit, and a strip of bacon? I'm not sure what type of family you're feeding with that. In Portland, it seems \\"family style\\" = \\"we can't time our food, so we'll bring it to you whenever we want and your dining guests will watch you eat while they're hungry.\\" \\n\\nI understand that Tasty is busy, but it's not a new restaurant and they should be accustomed to the amount of people who flood in for weekend brunch. Since we were sitting across from the kitchen, we could see the pace at which the food was coming out. If you wanted a Dutch Baby or an egg sandwich, you will be getting your food at a reasonable pace. Anything else, settle in. It was about 10 minutes before 1-2 dishes came out of the kitchen. All together, 1 doughnut took about 15 minutes, stewed green beans and a Bambino Plate took about half an hour, a cheesesteak- 45 minutes, and finally shakushka that took well over 1 1/4 hrs to get. The bizarre thing was that the table next to us also ordered shakushka and was served at least half an hour before us, even though they were seated 15 minutes after us. They did comp the shakushka because of the huge delay, but we did not expect to spend the majority of our morning waiting at a table for 1 dish.\\n\\nFor vegan diners, Tasty is not accommodating. The only things on the menu that are vegan are side dishes- maple sweet potatoes (which are delicious smashed whole potatoes baked with syrup), stewed green beans (which are a pile of onions in tomato sauce with barely any green beans), and sauteed spinach without the egg. They also mentioned they could make the salmon hash vegan but I imagine it's a plate of potatoes since the rest of the ingredients were not vegan. In a town like Portland where nearly every menu has vegan items marked, this is a huge disappointment to not offer any full vegan dishes. There weren't even any consolation breakfast items like oatmeal, fruit salad, or toast. I ate a few sad green beans, enjoyed the sweet potatoes, and went home to eat more.

The waitress I started out with was helpful, friendly and attentive. However, she left halfway through and we were left with multiple waiters who did not communicate with us or each other causing several mix ups along the way. \\n\\nThe food- main course : the soups were spectacular. The salmon chowder and the tomato basil were to die for. The salads feigned in comparison. My rice based salad had undercooked root vegetables and very limited root vegetables. The beet salad was missing a key ingredient (dried apples). The fried Brussels and broccoli were splendid. \\nThe food - dessert : the mint chocolate chip ice cream was great, you could taste the fresh mint. The strawberry rhubarb sorbet was OK.

We didn't get a table right away due to there having been a couple of reservations ahead of us (the entire place seats maybe 40). We followed the crowd the to bar across the street, owned by the same people. At the bar we had  a couple of drinks, and ordered a pizza appetizer. About five minutes after ordering the pizza (maybe 45 minutes after sitting in the bar) we got the call. The waitress told us they would bring the pizza over when it was done.\\n\\nOne we were seated, the waiter took our order. We already knew what we wanted because we had the menu pulled up on our phones. Shortly after placing orders, the pizza arrived in a box. We each pulled out a slice and were promptly asked not to eat any more because they don't serve that at this restaurant and \\"other patrons may ask about it\\". Say what? You own both places, have people deliver a pizza over to us at our table, and reprimand us for actually wanting to eat it? Ok... Aside from that, every other table got bread. Our bread never came. One of us ordered a glass of wine. We had to remind the waiter half way into our meal that said wine had been ordered. We did get a single refill on our waters after we had all mostly finished our meals. I am not sure if we pissed these guys off with the pizza, or if they were just completely forgetful of our table, but at the end of the day, the service was severely lacking.\\n\\nThe food did redeem this place from one or two stars. Gnocchi, Stuffed Peppers, Chicken Parmesan, and Lobster Ravioli were the entrees. The Gnocchi was the most tender I have ever had. Lobster Ravioli was meaty and delicious. I didn't sample much of the chicken or peppers, but am told they were delicious as well. You guys can cook. I think your reputation there is proven with the incredibly long lines. But your lack of tact for service has me putting two thumbs down.\\n\\nTo Rino's Place staff:\\nI can totally understand a policy of not allowing outside food at your tables. Please understand that when you own (and advertise on your website) that place across the street AND you are having people make deliveries to us from there, we are not going to associate this as \\"outside food\\". Some suggestions. 1. If you absolutely MUST see the order to its end, let patrons know that it will be delivered but that it's not something to be eaten inside the restaurant. 2. That first one is tactless right? Ok, here's an idea. Cancel the darn order and eat the cost of the pizza. I saw your cooks snacking on stuff in the kitchen. This is perfectly fine. Let them eat it. Food doesn't go to waste AND you have one fewer PO'd customer. 3. (The best option IMO) If you are going to make these deliveries, just allow us to eat the dang pizza. If you have a different menu, maybe, I don't know, add it to your menu of appetizers."},{"name":"George's Greek Coney Island","address":"2396 Old Stringtown Rd","city":"Grove City","stars":"4","text":"Great coney sauce: reminds me of Philips Coney Island.

There's an endless beer menu, cool waitstaff, ping pong tables, waterfall, beer cheese, sausage and the best Pastrami sandwich I've ever eaten anywhere ever. They make their own sausages, sandwich meats and fresh baked bread. They cook up their green beans with Fireman's 4. They're just awesomeness the whole way around. \\n\\nOn my first visit, I ate alone inside. The head chef personally came out and asked me how my food was. It was amazing. He was amazing... too bad I'm married. \\n\\nOn my second visit, the hubby and I split a Pastrami sandwich with the Fireman 4 green beans, and I haven't stopped talking about it since. I can still taste it in my dreams.\\n\\nOn the last visit, after escaping the madness of 6th Street's 4th of July crowd, Easy Tiger was absolute salvation for my silly little group of friends. One bar wouldn't let us in because of swim shorts, another because I was toting around my ukulele (we had trekked up here from the river), and the rest of the bars had music blaring that was so awful I wouldn't even take a piss on it. So we passed the nonsense by, and ended up at Easy Tiger. They welcomed us with open arms and great music (though it was just Pandora). They were quick with the delicious beers & sausage, and of course the Pastrami sandwich."},{"name":"Istanbul'lu","address":"237 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Awesome!

I got to Giacamo's early.  530pm on a Tuesday and there was already a line out the door.  So I walked down a few doors and popped in here.  It had four stars on Yelp so I thought - why not, it's the North End after all.  Well, the place is quaint and very small.  I had a Caesar salad and pasta bolognese.  The salad was not flavorful.  It was missing that amazing combination of lemon and cheese mixing with the anchovy.  Instead it was dressed in olive oil with a wedge of lemon and anchovy fillets.  It didn't hold together and was disappointing.  Next came the pasta - overdone.  The bolognese was unremarkable.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I keep giving you chances, Boston.

So 5 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service (the waitresses are nice but the place really should take reservations and be more friendly to its customers). \\nI have lived in Italy for 15 years and this is probably the best food I have had outside of Italy. The home made pasta is amazing, the white clam sauce has the right amount of garlic and a lot of full clams in the shell. The rigatoni amatriciana are rich and creamy, the gnocchi are soft and come with mozzarella on them. But the specials for pasta are even better, any of the ones with seafood come with generous amounts of shrimp, clams and lobster. The homemade pasta is so good you could eat it without the sauce. If you ever see the limeoncello shrimp as an appetizer I strongly recommend in. I have had the veal saltimbocca and it is terrific as well. I find the prices to be very fair considering the portions and quality of the food. \\nNow for the bad- this place is a victim of its own success and I find the attitude of the hostess to be in need of work. I live close by, and very often I am told at 5pm that there is a 3 hours wait for dinner since they do not take reservation (the place is really small). Yesterday I placed a take out order at 315 (right after they had opened), I called and was told the kitchen was not open despite the fact that the restaurant opened at 3. I was told to come 45 minutes later, when I showed up at 4 they had no idea when my food would be ready and they gave me an attitude by stating \\"you knew the kitchen wasn't open\\". This was the second time I had issues with the takeout service. \\nAt 4 the place was jammed and people were told there was a 3 hour wait. \\nBottom line the food is simply amazing, they can get away with the attitude issues once you actually eat it, but it would be nice if they dropped the whole \\"you should feel lucky to be here and enjoy our food\\" gimmick."},{"name":"Little Trouble","address":"1170 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"1- This place is legitimate. great for older crowed who want to get away from college kids who there seem to be a lot of them around. \\n2- the staff seem a bit too young and a tad on the attitude side, but its alright since they are quick. \\n3- The drinks are great\\n4- interior design is not as Tron as you might expect but still cool\\n5- the crowed is small, and seems very mature and open and a great mix.\\n6- great for friends to get together and hear each other over a taco? or drink.\\n7- The bouncers are great though, they really give you the feeling that you are getting into some Tokyo ghost club after Bill."},{"name":"Cantina La Mexicana","address":"247 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been going to Mexico since I've been 10.

It has been on a protracted soft open for two weeks prior to its grand opening on Feb 2. My experience is from combining the dining experiences of the soft and official openings, neither of which were impressive. \\nAs the name implies, this is a Mexican restaurant, family owned, that includes the standard assortment of tacos, taco salads, quesadillas, etc. with the protein options of steak, beef, chicken, and seafood.  Fountain and bottle soda, tea, water, etc. are offered. There is very limited seating inside and a larger patio outside for dining. \\nThree issues warranted a 1-Star review: Price, Quality, and Quantity. Prior to writing a poor review, I did check with a few local friends who ate there and who confirmed via similar opinions. \\nPrice - Single taco price $4. Get the 4-taco special for $12 but don't expect to get filled up. Easy for 3 people to have lunch for $45 and still be hungry. One thing that often sets Mexican restaurants apart is that prices tend to be affordable for tasty food. You won't get that here. Expect to spend $15 - $20 pp to get your fill.\\nQuality - Florida may be known as the sunshine state but it is also known for South American flavors, typically represented as \\"Mexican\\" since most Americans do not know the difference - don't be offended, just enjoy the good food. Whether it's a well-established chain or a local hole-in-the-wall where no one speaks English, the food can be counted on to taste great and satisfy the palate. Sadly, 4 Locos Tacos disappoints in every imaginable way. I have tried the steak, beef, and chicken only to find each time that the protein was so overcooked it was a dry jerky that was both tasteless and chewy, I could not recommend it. Similarly, the taco (soft only), comes \\"naked\\" so a quick trip to the unshielded condiment bar (think flu season) consists of 8 items that also are tasteless. Cheese was not available during the soft open but a white cheddar? was provided after the grand opening. The cheese was cool-ish and did nothing to enhance the flavor.\\nQuantity - This is the saddest part as paying $4 for a taco would make one think they are buying a pi√±ata of food stuffed in a single taco. NO NO NO, all you get is a small tablespoon of meat in a larger soft taco shell. Since it happened on both visits and other expressed the same shock, this is where a stingy kitchen will kill the business (as well as the aforementioned overcooking). Same goes for the tiny, tiny, tiny quesadillas that you would think for the price, would be pizza size. Instead you are treated to a what appears to be a small tortilla cut in half. If you are going to eat quesadillas, break out your credit card and order 6 or you are going to be back in line for another order.    \\nSadly, 4 Locos Tacos misses in every possible way. It tough because I love Mexican food and the location of this new restaurant was so desirable I wanted them to be great...or even average. Instead it is hard to imagine they will be around long without an immediate and extensive overhaul of their pricing, portions, and quality control.\\nI do not recommend 4 Locos Tacos."},{"name":"Giggles Comedy Club","address":"Prince Pizzeria","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"I had a lot of fun tonight!

One girl ordered a drink and the bar tender commented that her vodka soda with a splash of cranberry was \\"obnoxious\\" Then one other person ordered a gin a tonic...and without anyone asking for his opinion he said \\" this order is even more obnoxious\\" We brushed off the comments and continued to order for the rest of the group. He then tells us, \\"can you get the whole order together so i don't have to keep running from one end of the bar to the other?\\" we were very understanding and tried to get our order in...mind you it was 1am on a saturday and the bar was NOT packed by any means. We tried to order a long island...and he said, \\"I don't MAKE long islands, if you want one got to dirty sixth\\" (the bar is located on 6th st.) so he refused to make it and we willingly changed it to another drink...we he continued to voice his opinions on. When he handed us the bill...the person paying kindly asked for the name of the manager. and he said he was the manager. So the person paying for the drinks simply said that he felt that he was very rude to our friends and was not happy with the service and gave his card. The bar tender rang the card for all 9 drinks and came around to the front of the bar and got in all of our faces and forced us to leave. Mind you we just received our drinks like 2 minutes before he did this. We LITERALLY pried the glass out of 3 of our hands and forced us out. We were not belligerent drunk undergrad students... we just came from a nice dinner and were looking for a less crazy part of 6th st to hang out and none of us are from Austin. We didn't understand what ticked him off...if its b/c of our drink choice...didn't think that was a reason to throw us out of a bar. I've never experienced this type of service and deeply regret the experience my friends from out of town had. it really gave them a bad impression of Austin."},{"name":"Buckhead Bottle Bar & Bistro","address":"268 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"We went to Buckhead Bottle Bar this Saturday for girls night!

The menu is pretty light, with salad, sliders, and appetizers.  I had the Chicken Chopped Salad, there were tons of veggies on it and it was served with a wasabi ranch dressing.  \\n\\nFor my second drink I tried the Burning Mandarin flute, it is made with mandarin vodka, sparkling white wine and spicy mandarin nectar - the drink was so spicy that I only had a few sips before sending it back to the bar.\\n\\nWe continued our night back inside at the bar, I had another Ladybug - be sure to ask for Mike the bartender, he was great!\\n\\nOverall, Buckhead Bottle is more of a social scene than it is a restaurant.

They've really reduced the amount of meat on the sandwiches, and the prices are now very high (roll and a fountain drink ~10 bucks) compared the competition. For this price i'd expect top-notch, but even using boars-head they manage to screw it up. If half my Roast beef sandwich has too much gristle to eat, I'm not going to be happy. If my tomatoes are a day or two too old, i'm not going to be happy.

It takes its theme of urban picnic and brings it to life in its atmosphere. \\n\\nThe decorative elements here combines the classic touches of the natural outdoors (a huge wooden picnic table including chairs of logs and moss simulated on some walls, and the wall behind what appears will soon be a deli area has a scene of tree, river, and forest animals), all while also lining the walls with printing blocks and touches of vintage 1920s Parisian chic with the fabric of the lounge and bar stools and various wall art and fixtures, interplaying all these various textures to add an air of romance and hint of antique treasure. A bear head with a bowler hat and monocle perched and presiding above the bar embodies all of these with a dash of whimsy. It's not often that I find a place that presents such style and character in its atmosphere\\n\\nEverything seems to be of high quality bistro fare you'd find hope to find in the romantic Paris you would drop by in your neighborhood route- homey and smart and elegant all at the same time. Here and there you see a call back to their theme with an actual picnic basket, as well as signage letting you that these straw baskets, fully stocked with plates and silverware and glasses and even a blanket, can be rented by the day + filled with food.\\n\\nThe mixed greens with fresh berries, toasted cinnamon honey almonds and house made ricotta with a pickled blueberry vinaigrette had a tart freshness to it balanced by a touch of sweetness from the cinnamon honey. The arugula, roasted corn, spring onion and roasted tomatoes with avocado in a grilled lemon dressing on the other hand offered a piquant peppery contrast with each tomato giving a little burst of ripe sweetness here or there.\\n\\nThe dessert was one of the best chocolate cakes we ever had, a chocolate sour cream bundt cake with chocolate ganache that was served slightly warm, with rich milk chocolate in every soft moist bite.\\n\\nAnd ah, pavlova. Ah, this light airy goodness of egg whites and sugar into meringue with fresh berries and vanilla cream. At first this plate looked intimidating as it is basically the size of a whole pie but then we realized you were being given the best part, the crunchy top half, a thin shell of firmness surrounding an inside that melted in our mouth so quickly that we needed another spoonful carefully balancing crisp bits of meringue with soft vanilla cream and such beautiful sweet strawberry in each bite to extend the rush.\\n\\nI also discovered my favorite two cocktails that the Picnic House offers from their cocktail menu. After trying the lighter cocktail sparklers of the Fleur de Lis and Sauvie on previous visits, this time I welcomed the Moulin Rouge martini with Indio Marionberry infused vodka, Clear Creek Blackberry liqueur, blueberry simple syrup, fresh squeezed lemon and garnished with a pickled blueberry, a combination of sweet with a touch of tart so it was not too sweet. But, my favorite was The Nymph cocktail, both delicate and strong, with Pink Spruce gin, fresh squeezed lemon juice, and a simple syrup muddled with cucumber. Refreshing citrusy but you can feel the magic afterwards!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The food was very tasty.

I will make a journey for a good croissant, so excuse my tunnel vision.

I've visited several times just for croissants.  \\n\\nHere's the skinny:  the croissants are smallish and somewhat dry, a little browner than I'd like on the outside, but do have the right texture on the inside indicating that they've put the love into them.  I will go out of my way for croissants here.  \\n\\nHowever, if you're in this neck of the woods, you might as well also try the 1886 Cafe at the Driscoll just a few blocks west.  1886 isn't nearly as consistent as Easy Tiger but 1886 is invariably more moist which allows you to further enjoy the flaky, buttery, silky smooth aspects of a good croissant.

Life gets in the way sometimes. Anyway, today's review is on a local restaurant called Avenue Thai and Sushi in Winter Park, FL. My husband and I got a groupon deal for this place and since I'm always in the mood for sushi, we decided to try it out. We were not disappointed! \\n\\nAvenue Thai and Sushi looks like your average thai/sushi place...simple decor, booths and tables, and of course, a full, open sushi bar. But, the humble surroundings really allowed room for the food to shine. Something else that was pretty cool - they give you the option of forks or chopsticks or both right there on the table. \\n\\nWe started of with some traditional spring rolls.  There were six pieces but we kind of ate most of them before taking the photo, lol. The rolls were fresh, hot and crispy with a tangy dipping sauce. Delish! \\n\\nSince we had $40 to spend, I had to order more than my usual maki roll. I decided on the Spicy Tuna Salad because raw tuna is always awesome. The Spicy Tuna Salad is a neat little package of raw tuna chunks atop a bed of diced cucumbers, and dotted around the plate with green and orange spicy sauce. The tuna was fresh and soft to the palate, the softness was balanced with the crunchy cubes of cucumber. And dipping the tuna in the sauce dots gave it just the right amount of \\"kick\\". The portion was small, but it was a perfect side to the main event...the Crunchy Mango Sushi Roll!!\\n\\nThis roll is MASSIVE! On the inside - tempura shrimp, crab, avocado, cream cheese, sweet mango. On the outside - black sesame seeds, masago, and crispy wonton strips...all drizzled with both eel sauce AND their signature \\"Avenue\\" sauce. The sushi was BIG because of so much stuff going on, so I could barely fit the piece in my mouth, but ohhh man there was sooooo much flavor! The crispiness of the tempura shrimp and wontons combined with the suble sweetness of the mango and the eel sauce took me to sushi heaven...Oishi~!!\\n\\nBottom Line: Avenue Thai and Sushi has the right flavors with the right price!

So I will certainly be going back, but this was bad enough to drag it down to the near-lowest score I've given a restaurant.\\n\\nFirst, the good;\\n-All of the food was high quality\\n-The prices were very reasonable\\n-The waitstaff is friendly and the cooks seemed to know what they were doing\\n-The wine selection was short but perfect. It had everything I could possibly ever be in the mood for.\\n-Best. Fries. Evar.\\n\\nThe bad;\\n-The service was horribly slow and when I asked if they were understaffed they said 'not at all, why do you ask?' ... details below.\\n\\nWhen we got sat, it was over 10 minutes before anyone came to take our drink orders. We worried at this initial sign but figured it was just a fluke. The drinks came fast enough, but then it was another 15min until our order was taken. The salads were delivered quickly enough (and were quite good and very fresh) but it was 35 minutes until our entrees arrived. Why? Well.. Many times we watched as plates stacked up on the counter (no heating lamp) and sat for ~5min. We hoped it was never ours. They weren't, but I overheard our waitress mention 'The steak was supposed to have fries with it'.  Only I'd get a steak with fries at a semi-fancy place so I knew it was mine. Five minutes later our food was delivered and a friend leaned over and said 'My vegetables are cold, are yours cold?' ... not only were my veggies cold, so was my steak. Everything but the right-out-of-the-fryer fries were cold. My other friend ditto'd it. \\"Should we send them back? Mine is not even luke warm!\\"\\n\\nNone of us were really offended enough to send anything back, but I brought it up (nicely!) to the waitress and she offered a free dessert and apologized but said that they were not understaffed and wasn't sure why the food would be cold.\\n\\nI think this could all have been solved by a heat lamp. Oh, I know a few folks just cringed but c'mon, it just keeps food warm when minor corrections need to be made! Far better than resting on the counter for 5 minutes getting cold. Hopefully the new management reads this and takes into consideration. Otherwise, don't change much! The menu was a bit all-over-the-map but the fillet and fries are sooooooo good that I'll be back (so long as the food is done right the first time and hence no cold meals for an entire table).\\n\\nSo it likely deserves 5 stars, but COLD food at $50/person is not ok =("},{"name":"Country Cookin Diner","address":"704 W Ave","city":"Cocoa","stars":"4.5","text":"Worst service ever.

I really enjoy bisquits and gravy, and I love the game-meats. Double-pleasure for me here. This dish was rich, warm and wonderful.  They offer small-plates and large-plates and the bisquits were from the small-plate menu. I had been eyeing the Auntie Paula's French Toast with  with pear-maple syrup & whipped cream ... so I grabbed another small plate (and another mug of that tasty coffee).

We later overheard that the next table over had some of their order forgotten as well. I can't blame him entirely, the restaurant was so ridiculously under-staffed that he had to literally run between tables to keep up.\\nOnce the food finally arrived, my Eggs Benedict were alright, aside from a rather unappetizing presentation.

Unfortunately the catfish was incredibly spicy from all of the seasoning and after a couple of bites I couldn't taste anything else. I usually like spicy food, but not when it's overpowering to the point of not being enjoyable and I feel like that was my experience with this entree. The remoulade and pickles in the sandwich were lovely and the catfish was actually cooked really nicely, but sadly it was hard to get through even half of the sandwich. That said, I would go back since a lot of the menu looked great, and my friends seemed to enjoy their food.

Many interesting choices, although the corresponding prices were a bit high compared to other Asian restaurants of comparable quality (as other Yelpers have mentioned, this is likely due to the restaurant's location--being near Newbury often gives establishments the gall to jack up prices). The drink list involved a whole slew of fruit smoothies, non-alcoholic mixed drinks, sake, wine and beer. \\n\\nWe started off with the lollipop shrimp which were good but I expected more than 4 little pinky-sized shrimp rolls for $7. The virgin Moscow Mule made with ginger beer and lime juice is quite refreshing and it made a nice accompaniment to my entree of Hainanese chicken.  Since I've never traveled to Singapore or Malaysia, I can't vouch for the authenticity of this dish, but it was very tasty. A mound of yellow chicken-flavored rice was flanked by a well-dressed, simple green salad, and tender boiled chicken (skin on) topped with minced ginger. The chicken was a bit oily, but I think it's meant to be that way. The boyfriend had five spice duck, which was covered in a dark brown sauce and accompanied by white rice and green salad. It lacked a depth of flavor that you'd expect from a combo of five spices, but the meat was tender.\\n\\nThere was just one server working the room (possibly due to the late afternoon hour and only a handful of tables were occupied), but he was one hardworking dude! I saw him take orders, bus tables, take photos for celebrating diners AND deliver an order in the bitter cold in between serving. All of this contributed to the somewhat slow service, but I give him props because he maintained a cheerful and polite demeanor throughout. And maybe I'm just cheez-tastic, but I kinda liked the decor; it was really colorful and inviting. \\n\\nSo for the funny/memorable part...I was left with a souvenir of my visit that involved me slamming the bathroom door in my own face upon exiting. I don't exactly know how this happened, but it did. Later on, after I got home, I discovered yet another souvenir...The leftovers that the server had packed for me had leaked all over my brand new Adriano Goldschmied purchases! Mostly I blamed myself for putting the leftovers in the same bag, so I don't think these incidents will deter me from visiting Island Hopper again when I'm shopping on Newbury St. and the craving for pan-Asian cuisine hits. If anything, the main deterrent would be the prices (how ironic)."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"The restaurant was in an attractive building, and we were looking forward to our first meal on vacation.

Meh.  \\n\\nThe flank steak I didn't try - you'd have to ask Nick R about it, but he thought it was okay, I think.  The veal sweetbreads were just plain boring.  They were so completely NOT memorable that I can't really think of anything to say about them.  The trout was served in a cold potato salad, which pretty much overwhelmed whatever flavor the trout may have had.  (Sensing a theme here?)\\n\\nThe tacos were good - braised oxtail on a puffed taco shell.\\n\\nThe bright spot?  The scallops were DIVINE - seared to perfection, the squid ink sauce was delicate, bright, and gorgeous. Plating with the pears was gentle and attractive, reflecting the light flavors.  The scallops were clearly fresh with no rubberyness to the meat, a light brown char on the flats, and the perfect amount of firmness.  The seawater flavor was present without being overwhelming.  I cannot rave enough about the fracking scallops.\\n\\nWhere else do they get points?  Service was kinda good.  Plating was excellent.  Atmosphere (other than the noise level) was excellent.  The noise was OBNOXIOUS.  I don't know why so many drunken shrill former sorority girls were there, but man.. what a turn off.\\n\\nNick had a pair of cocktails and wasn't impressed.  At 12$/cocktail, prices are on bar with the better mixology bars in town, and the quality certainly wasn't.  The bottle of Divine Droplets I had (a junmai daiginjo sake) was $65 - it sells in stores for about $20.  I can appreciate that there's a markup, but that's ridiculous.\\n\\nAlso, what's with the delay in dishes?  The waitress told us they'd come out as they were prepared, but we didn't get the grilled cucumbers until we were more than three quarters through the meal, and the steak took over an hour (it's served as medallions).  I get that some things take a bit longer, but the service was so shuffled and out of order that it was bothersome.\\n\\n\\nBluntly, only the scallops keep this place from a one star review.  It was otherwise an ear-splitting, bland, and boring waste of $250 for three.  Avoid this joint unless you want the scallops, in which case, order nothing else."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"12553 State Rd, Ste 535","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was seasoned great, cooked great, and served great! \\nWe loved the wonderful woman who did balloon sculptures for our boys."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Oh Highland Kitchen, I have see you at my best and I have seen you at my worst and I am proud to call you my local.

I asked if we could turn on the game and she just handed me the remote....does this feel like home or what??\\n\\nMenu isn't huge, but what we had was pretty good.  Wife had a wedge salad and the small mac & cheese.  I won't say the m&c was the most inventive we've seen in town, but it was hearty, cheesy, warm and good.  I had the kobe burger, after giving Belle a choice of me having that or the pulled pork sammich.  Burger was good....I heart attacked it up a little with some gorgonzola and bacon.  Resolving to avoid fried sides this year, I had their potato salad, which we both found interesting and refreshing.  A nice list of funky cocktails made the meal a success!\\n\\nService was solid and upbeat.  The owner stopped by to check on us which always strikes a good cord with me.  Had live music going on up front...a guy, a guitar, a microphone and the sounds of Jimmy Buffet, Billy Joel, and Billy and the Beaters coming through the speakers in the back.\\n\\nBilly's doesn't look like much on the outside (I don't know what it was before), but they've done a nice job on the inside.

We were told these were small plates and we should order a few. Very true, but when we ordered a few we were asked to place our full order which we did not understand. The first dish presented were the squid fries. A lot of potential here but the breading was soft indicating to me that the oil was not quite hot enough for frying. Brussels sprouts were out of this world good. Loved the various flavors. Then came the scallops which had been over seasoned and were entirely too salty. Also, with only two on the $22 order, we felt a little underserved. The dish could have been spectacular with two more scallops and no salt.

Also, the Marge is made with cherry tomatoes, which are kind of hard to eat. One bite, and the tomato is gone, as opposed to sliced tomatoes.

As good as the chicken is, and actually it's great, it's really all about the roti (warm, doughy, and with just the right amount of subtle sweetness) and house curry sauce for me--the sort of perfect combo that becomes a trusted comfort food after one bite--as if you grew up eating it.\\n\\nCouple things I thought were cool:\\n\\n* The setup is similar to a Lardo-esque place in that you order at the counter, take a number, and have your food brought to you, but it differs in that you're not expected to bus your own table.\\n\\n* If you order a mixed drink (served in a mason jar, natch), the person who takes your order also prepares the beverage for you.\\n\\nCouple other things to note:\\n\\n* Perhaps an unfamiliar concept to some, the curry here is just sauce/broth (think of it as a condiment, as I overheard one of the staff say), so it will need to be supplemented with something more substantial, e.g., roti or jasmine rice. But getting some of said curry is flat-out essential; it's simultaneously complex (such that it's difficult to pinpoint specific ingredients) and so well executed that it exudes a power of simplicity.\\n\\n* The Muu Hong is pretty tasty, but I feel it needs a broth/sauce (a sentiment reminiscent of mine about Tasty n Sons' Burmese Red Pork Stew; in fact, the two are very similar dishes, thought at least the Muu Hong doesn't create the expectation of a broth component by categorizing itself as a stew), because it's just rice, fried egg (quite crispy), and pork belly and so is a bit dry, especially once you've eaten the protein and are left with just rice. It occurred to me that, if I order the Muu Hong again, I will definitely get some of the house curry to add. Actually, that sounds pretty amazing."},{"name":"Tremonte Restaurant & Bar","address":"397 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"3.5","text":"After being contacted twice (and basically scolded) by two separate parties regarding this review, I decided to update it:\\n\\nThe food was great but when I asked to split a bill AT THE BEGINNING of our service I was told to remind our waitress at the end so she could do that. When the bill came, we had to put up a fight to split the bill (24 person party). I understand that it's difficult, though possible, to split it amongst that many people, but that's why we asked at the beginning. \\n\\nMy two suggestions for this establishment: \\n\\n1. If you have a large party, you can simply name groups on your POS system that are broken up into the larger parties OR use the old pen and paper before ringing folks in, draw a simple chart with the table lay out and number of seats and (since you already have to write down everyones order) write the order by the seat number so you know who it belongs to.\\n\\n2. When responding to reviews (that were originally written to let management know about a less than satisfactory experience, say, constructive criticism) to be courteous and ask further questions about anything you may be questioning. I understand as a business emotions can run high when someone has a comment about the way you do things but it is usually easily rectified so long it's approached with grace. Instead, I was \\"told off.\\" (Yelp even offers tips to business accounts on how to respond to reviews, you may want to refer to them)\\n\\nEven though I really want to just leave one star because I'm rattled at the way I've been treated by a server (unknown) and who ever the second person was that messaged me the way they did (someone else that works there but also unknown) the cooks there do a great job and the three stars is SOLELY for them."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"12553 State Rd, Ste 535","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"It's a chain, so I'll keep it short.

The offerings of charcuterie were plentiful, and if we hadn't already had hors d'oeuvres prior to our big date dinner, I would have been happy to try something. \\n\\nWhat I was most impressed by was the staff at The Butcher Shop. Considering it is small and there are people standing and drinking and eating, it maintained a very efficient level of comfort.

We were served quickly, but felt no rush to finish our glasses.\\n\\nI would like to go back to try the eats, but until I do, this is what I have to say about The Butcher Shop: in a neighborhood full of places that often seem like they're trying too hard, this is a place where at least the staff is trying just hard enough.

This I mentioned to my server with the expressed hope that he'd convey it to the kitchen so that future orders would be improved upon.

We really appreciate that. It was like Shane was serving a member of his own family and not some strange people literally walking in off the street. That's how careful he was and how much he took it upon himself to be sure of the ingredients. That's pretty rare, and we won't forget it!\\n\\nAnd then the food came...gah!!! SO GREAT!!!!

However, I can comment on the food, drinks and bowling experience.\\n\\nThe music is fun, playing classics like Journey and Joan Jett. They serve pitchers of beers and delicious big bowls (sangria and fish bowl are both awesome). The other drinks I've tried haven't been too exciting or strong. The waitresses are always MIA. We've learned just to stand somewhere and grab waitresses as they walk around. Our bar bills would probably be about 3-4x higher if a waitress actually came by on a regular basis. \\n\\nThe food is somewhere between mediocre and good- I like their turkey burgers. The first time I got a turkey burger, I asked for waffles fries instead of regular fries. She charged me $9 for the change and didn't mention that it came with sauce and cheese on the fries (I can't eat cheese). The second time, I asked for a turkey burger without cheese, and it came with cheese on it. However, if you're not picky, have any food allergies or on a diet, you will like the food here- it is definitely better than typical bowling fare. I do wish they had tables for food/drinks near the bowling lane, though. There are only tables behind the bowling sitting area, so when we order food and drinks, we have to awkwardly stand behind our lane, separate from the rest of the group. I think they did this to maximize the number of lanes in the space.\\n\\nThe bowling itself is pretty fun. Each time we've gone, our lane has jammed a few times, and once we had to get someone to come fix it. However, that's happened to me at other places as well. They also have air hockey and video games (I saw Big Buck Hunter last time I was there, very tempting).\\n\\nBased on hearsay, this place can get pretty ridiculous on certain nights.

I got the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl and my friend got the Mother Earth Bowl along with the brussels sprouts side. My bowl was decent and tasted kind of like pad thai, but with quinoa. Ingredients were fresh and complemented each other very well. I actually really enjoyed the Mother Earth bowl though. It's simple, but very fresh and the flavors were great. The brussels sprouts didn't seem that fresh as they were kind of cold. I think the food is good, but not worth the price, especially since they charge around $5+ for protein in addition to the base price of their salads/entrees ($8/$9). It's just way too expensive for what you get if you want to add a meat option as well. I get that they have fresh, organic ingredients, but that's still not really worth it for me. \\n\\nBesides food, I got one of their seasonal lemonade flavors which was really good and you get refills too!

The atmosphere is very cool, with a nice mix of folks.  My only complaint, and it's a major one to me, is that the host asked me to take my hat off.  Maybe if I had a baseball cap??? A wool Kangol, though?  I think not.  Especially since it leaves me with hat hair.  Look Wine Loft: This would never happen in San Francisco.  Such a cool place, and you have a dress code? leave that to the uptight places.  I mean, that customer that your concerned about isn't going to go there anyhow.  It's a wine bar!!!  Wine attacts only a certain customer, and they know how to \\"act\\".  Also, the selection could have been a slight bit better.  There were no Petite Syrah options, and the Cab options were minimal.  A lot of Merlots, although it seems merlot is making a comeback.  Overall, kudos to you.

Crowd pleaser right here.\\n\\nSteak + Eggs with Cornmeal Pancake - I Love corn. Which makes this already delicious dish even better. The meat was pre-sliced, but it did not take away from the tender, perfectly medium-rare cooked steak. The corn pancake had a nice griddled bottom crust, brought out on a cast-iron skillet. Top that with jalapeno butter, the nectar of juices from the steak, and I'm in heaven. \\n\\nPolenta + Sausage Ragu with Egg/Cheese - The seasoning was a tad bit salty on this dish, but it disappeared along with the rest of the dishes. Fantastic polenta, with bits of sausages and melted mozzarella in every bite. A dish that makes you nap for sure.\\n\\nIf my stomach would only allow, I would've ordered more.

Excellent food, great service, and a cool atmosphere. \\n\\nWe made a reservation on Yelp and after taking a few minutes to find the restaurant, which is awkwardly positioned relative to the parking garage, we were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. This is a non-Spanish tapas style restaurant and the menu is broken into several parts (raw, charcuterie, pastas hot plates, etc), so there is a fairly wide selection for any palate. \\n\\nMy wife and I shared poke tacos, duck confit, tomato bucatini (a pasta), and fried okra (a special). We started with poke tacos were good, but nothing crazily special. That said, everything else was absolutely fantastic. The duck fell off the bone and tasted absolutely delicious- I'd definitely order again. The bucatini was absolutely fantastic, with fresh made pasta and huge white shrimp in a delicious basil cream sauce. This dish rivaled pastas we ate in Italy. Finally, the fried okra, though simple, had an awesome chipotle kick that set it over the top. \\n\\nWe ordered drinks, and our wine/cocktail came in record time. My cocktail was probably the biggest letdown of the night, as I found it a bit watered down with too much ice. That said, the beer selection was very good and I enjoyed my second drink (a Creature Comforts rye ale). My wife enjoyed her wine.\\n\\nOur server was very friendly, attentive and knowledgable, but not annoyingly so, and the food came quite quickly (though not rushed). I liked the atmosphere, as it was intimate yet semi-open, though it was a tad dark inside. \\n\\nOverall, this was a reasonably priced place with great food and quick, personalized service that made it something really fantastic. We had no idea this place existed, but will definitely be back."},{"name":"Little Trouble","address":"1170 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Probably my most favorite bar to go to in Atlanta.

The place was absolutely packed and there were already a handful of parties waiting ahead of us outside. In my defeat, I headed across the street to China Pearl, however I am so glad I decided to give Winsor another shot! This time, it was later in the evening during the week (they serve dim sum all day).\\n\\nWalk up the stairs, swing to the left, and enter a narrow - 2 tables wide by 5-6 tables deep - dining room. The second time coming, my boyfriend and I were one of 4 tables, so I suggest coming during an off-hour if you want guaranteed seating without having to wait.\\n\\nThe dim sum is made to-order so everything is piping hot upon arrival. This is a nice change compared to most restaurants where dim sum is offered where the food is usually lukewarm from being carted around. The hot dishes definitely add a positive spin to the experience, as it makes the food seem fresher than most dim sum. Also a plus is the picture menu (of most dim sum dishes). If you are a newcomer to dim sum, this will prove very helpful in addition to the english titles. That said, practically everything is absolutely delicious. I suggest mixing the soy sauce, vinegar. and chili oil on your plate for a yummy dipping sauce.\\n\\nI have now gone on several occasions and can confidently say everything consistently tastes fantastic. My favorites are the fried shrimp balls (5), fried dough with rice noodle (3 pieces), u-choy with oyster sauce (several pieces), shrimp with chive dumpling (3), and sesame balls (3). The stuffed tofu (3), stuffed eggplant (3), shrimp and chive noodle (7), shrimp and spinach dumpling (3), shrimp dumpling (4), fried shrimp roll (3 pieces chopped), and lotus seed bun (3) are also yummy. The carnivores love the pork and veggie bun (3), BBQ pork bun (3), chicken feet & spareribs & rice, and spareribs and rice noodle. Pretty much anything you pick (dim sum) is a winner. Unfortunately, I have never eaten during a time when I can order the egg tarts (only during weekends), so I always wind up across the street at Ho Yuen Bakery for them. \\n\\nDelicious food aside, the service is pretty friendly compared to typical Chinatown standards. The people actually smile and say \\"Your welcome,\\" after you say, \\"Thank you.\\" They also refill your water glass consistently and don't make you feel rushed. \\n\\nTwo gripes: blasting A/C (that cools down the dim sum quicker) and the fact that, no matter how you pour the tea, it always spills everywhere. Notwithstanding, free tea, cheap, piping hot, delicious dim sum, and a friendly smile make for a wonderful experience that I will come back for again and again."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I stopped ny for a quick grab and go lunch and wasn't disappointed.

If you go to Easy Tiger and you are mildly hungry, get the beer cheese and a pretzel. You won't be disappointed. The sausage buns are pretty great as well. I wasn't a fan of the muffaletta.

My cousin got the skirt steak and Mexican rice .. the rice was lacking in flavor but the steak she ordered medium was delicious and she very much so enjoyed it . I got the quesadilla with Mexican chorizo sausage , roasted poblano , fingerling potatoes and pepper jack cheese . This was ridiculously amazing . Soooooo good .

Another excellent selection is the taco salad, one of the more healthful (as in \\"more healthful than extremely bad for you\\") items. Get it with the creamy jalapeno dressing. You can also ask for that as a chip dipping sauce, which is delicious.\\n\\nSpeaking of chips, perhaps the very best thing about Chuy's is the ultra-thin chips served when you sit down.

There are two dining tables that seat around 10-15 each but we found our table mates to be on the extremes: talkative, loud, almost bordering on drunk or not interested in stranger interaction. I do have to admit I'm not sold on communal dining in general, outside of family style dining with large groups of friends, because it feels forced and awkward. It is a very nice touch that Beast waits until all diners have arrived and settled in before service begins.\\n\\nThe first two courses- soup and chacuterie were great starters that made us excited for the rest of the meal. The foie gras bon bon that seems to be a regular on the chacuterie plate was my favorite item of the entire dinner, seriously I could just eat a plate of those.\\n\\nThe next two courses - lamb and salad weren't as successful. Most of the table agreed that the lamb was way too cumbersome to eat, it was a huge chunk of meat and bone. The meat wasn't soft which required a lot of cutting around the bone and chewing. The sauce and accompaniments to the lamb also all blended into something discernible. The salad course was nice but nothing new or special.\\n\\nI am happy that the last two courses left our dinner on a high note. The cheese plate had 3 wonderfully stinky cheeses with classic sides - crackers, honey, fruit. Dessert was a decadent chocolate ganache tart that was a great balance of pure unadulterated chocolate indulgence.\\n\\nAll in all, I think a dinner at Beast is an essential experience of Portland dining.

The eggs were so good that my party ended up ordering another order HAHA! \\n\\nFor entrees we got the chicken and waffles and ribs. The fried chicken was perfectly seasoned and crispy. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about how delicious the waffle was. The ribs full  of flavor but on the thinner side. The Mac and cheese and cornbread were the winner though.

The sauce was simply way too overpowering and it was all you could taste to the point where five hours after my meal, all I could STILL taste was the sauce that was too vinegary. I ended up leaving most of the pork which is supposed to be the star of the dish.

If you're a food lover, you get to check out a skilled butcher (the ladies tell me he's super hot) explain how to cut down the meat of the month, whether pig, lamb, whatever, and tell you excellent things to do with each piece.  Right then and there, you've got an excellent experience that I'd pay good money for (though not the full price of a month's share), plus you get fresh meat that was cut from the body just minutes before.  Each weekend following, you get a new cut. Perhaps a dry aged steak this time, or a pate, or a sausage. It's almost a challenge to come up with a new use for the same animal every week, but the flavors are so exquisite with the animals they choose, you can't help but love everything you make.\\n\\nMy favorite month so far was a spring lamb, killed just a couple days prior, we watched the butcher take down the animal quickly, and then took home some chops of lamb to grill that very night.  For future weeks, we received aged steaks, lamb confit, and an ridiculously flavorful lamb sausage.\\n\\nNow, the CSAs are expensive, but you're getting enough meat for a meal for 3 every week for 3-4 weeks, for a share price of about $100 - which comes down to ~$8 per person per meal. Not a bad deal for some truly killer meat.

Yes, it was dark, yes the plants were dead, yes the china was mismatched and cracked, yes there was an old first communion dress hung on the wall. BUT, the owner was so friendly and knowledgeable about the food, the waitstaff was top notch and the kicker? The food was amazing! Now fast forward to a Friday night summer 2010... The only bright spot of the night was the new bar and the bartender, Stacey, who was fast, friendly, and great at what she does. Then we moved to our table in the new jazz room. It was brighter than the old part but the decor: plastic wrapped photographs mounted in an old cooler? Strange. The tables are slick granite topped and the seating is crowded. The china is the same, but alas, the waitstaff is so bad. One server did our drink order (he said many more would wait on us, he wasn't \\"our\\" server) and we never saw him again. We were pretty much ignored for some serious stretches of time. Once our food order was placed, the visits were sporadic and no one seemed to know what the last person had accomplished when there. So the appetizers came (calamari and scallops). They were good, but no real care was taken in presentation. The entrees came, mine was wrong and was sent back. Three different servers came to apologize. Now more drinks arrive and the rest of my companions are eating, because they have all been served. Finally my correct dish arrives, the zucchilini with a gorgonzola pear sauce, which again is good (although I never found a pear), but looks like something I would make in a rush, no flourish. The owner delivered it to me, he is still very friendly. No effort was made to keep empty dishes cleared, silverware replaced. It was just bad, bad service from the get -go. We brought our own cake to celebrate a birthday, so I didn't get to compare to what I remember to be fabulous, authentic, fresh italian desserts.

Thinking this would be good for pics and your taste buds, I ordered a steak bowl and a hot dog off the kids menu for my son. With a fountain soda, the total came out to be about $26.\\n\\nThe bowls have very little options. Besides the protein of your choice, you can only choose 1 out of 3 bases and 1 out of 3 sauces. I was assigned to order from the cashier that was the farthest left. Little did I know, this would turn out to be a huge mistake. The cashier took my order accurately and quickly. However after paying and stepping forward, I noticed that this was also the mobile ordering line. The food runner in charge of this next area was unable to perform quickly and concentrate. There was a long wait. I probably waited on my food for about 15 minutes. When my food finally arrived, as in she grabbed the tray and brought it to where I was standing, she didn't hand it to me. She had already grabbed my drinks and left it on the table so I'm wondering why she didn't pass the tray to me. I watched her go back over to mobile ordering and call out numbers / names. After a few minutes had passed, she went to grab another tray. The tray of the party behind me. Now that she had both trays on the table, she handed me mine. About 5 minutes had went by of me staring at my tray. So yup, the food was COLD by the time I sat down. Not to mention, the rice in my bowl was not cooked properly. It was hard. The rice and steak were completely flavorless. The meat was thinly sliced beef versus grilled beef as stated. The onion chimichurri sauce was thrown on the rice versus the meat itself. I was not happy with this bowl at all.\\n\\nAs for my son's meal, it was pretty decent. The hot dog came in a heavy dough.

I order their signature chicken and waffle and was able to specify that I wanted all dark meat pieces, I received two nice sized chicken thighs and a leg, they were cooked perfectly and super crunchy. The waffle was nice and simple and not doughy. I tried a piece of my friends cat fish, it wasn't bad, I do believe that they could have made it more crunchy, it was a bit too soft for my liking.

It had a weird, grainy texture as it rolled over my tongue. \\n\\n* Honey Balsamic Strawberry with Cracked Pepper: Our one fruity ice cream, and it tasted so fresh! The balsamic and honey enhanced the strawberry taste, and the cracked pepper gave an occasional kick. \\n\\n* Sea Salt Ice Cream with Caramel Ribbon: Sea salt and caramel has become a very popular flavor for all desserts, so this was our safe bet and it delivered.

This place did not disappoint.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\n\\nLaid back and tucked away a level under the street. You have to walk down some steps to get to the place. Overall there is indoor and outdoor seating. Inside was full so we had to sit outside, which was not too bad considering the weather. Not too loud outside so it was not hard to have a conversation. However, I think if you sat inside you might be raising your voice to be heard. Seems fairly chill place to hang out and grab a drink.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nI got a corned beef sandwich along with a pretzel and beer cheese. The sandwich was good, but the meat was a little too salty to my liking. The pretzel and beer cheese though, that was my favorite of the night. The pretzel was crispy and salted just the right amount. The beer cheese, was some of the best cheese that I have ever had hands down. It was creamy, and had the right amount of texture and firmness that it didn't go dripping all over the place. If you are going to come here, definitely get the pretzel and beer cheese. My friend got the New yorker board and it was a lot of food. He couldn't manage to finish the whole tray. A good smapling if you want to try out what they have to offer. So in all decent food.\\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\nThey have a lot to choose from, including beers and cocktails. I had the Harris tweed, which if you like ginger, this is the one to get. My friend got a 512 Pecan Porter and he enjoyed that as well, it is more of a darker beer and a little on the sweeter side if that is what you are looking for.\\n\\nService:\\n\\nI take a star off for this one. It took us about half an hour before we could flag down a server to get us drinks and to order our food.

Austin, Texas happens to be one of my all-time favorite places in the country when it comes to finding outstanding cuisine, mind-blowing atmosphere and hands down fantastic service. Swift's Attic; a GREAT spot on Congress falls right into all of the above! First things first... the overall vibe in this Downtown hot spot is purely awesome! The restaurant and bar was literally jam packed with patrons in a fun and incredible party vibe that you'd expect from a successful gastropub. The crew and I enjoyed SO many aspects of Swift's that I could go on forever fawning over everything that they have to offer a potential diner! The ambiance is not so much 'restaurant' as it is a ritzy NYC style loft; I felt as though I was attending a high-classed socialite party uptown with baller food  (mostly all Gluten free) - VERY cool!\\n\\nMoving right along... we sat at an extremely spacious circular booth complete with a huge 'Lazy Susan' (for sharing with friends & family). Everything is served Tapas style; with the point being to order a variety of different plates and combine them in order to create a full meal. We were excited to see if the food held up to our surroundings; so we ordered an array of their most popular morsels!  We also decided to partake in a Swift's Attic tradition called, 'Omakase' which means \\"I trust you\\" in Japanese - this option allows the server to surprise the diner with dishes picked by staff. As we waited for the eats; we partook in some of their interesting cocktails and cold distilled water (served in the coolest water flasks I've ever seen - points for originality). The Prince Edward's Ass (LoL) had a delicious sour lime-ish flavor with a tickle of ginger thrown in for good measure.  I had the Cuidador Piso Mojado which was uber-spicy... Tequila and St. Germain with muddled jalapenos (floating gracefully in the drink) and a housemade sweet & sour. We also endulged in a gigunda glass of sweet Grog! - Black Rum, Mead and lime topped with white rascal - hands down amazing drink!\\n\\nOn to the food... the Kimchi was a variety of fresh & delicious fermented veggies with a bit of a kick!  We indulged in the celery and daikon radish (white style) and nappa cabbage and summer squash (red style); all delicious with a fantastic variety of tastes and textures!  The Apple & Arugula Salad was a killer salad that is evocative of autumn. The Raw Maine Diver Scallop Tiradito offered thinly sliced raw Maine diver scallops and marinated cucumbers with an unbelievable cucumber sorbet hidden in the center which is BOSS... cool and refreshing following the scallions and spicy Aji Amarillo pepper sauce!  Rainbow Trout came out seared to perfection, topped with sundried tomatoes & lightly doused in a slammin' sweet broth that made our mouths tingle with pleasure. The fish itself was sweet and melts in your mouth!\\n\\nThe Lockhart Quail was uber-scrumptious, tender and juicy - marinated in rosemary and coriander, grilled and served with red grapes, homemade cornbread and an unreal rum spiked golden raisin butter... OH DAMN! The quail was lightly soaked in a BOSS sauce that could only be described as a hybrid of a BBQ and Teriyaki glaze; while the crispy cornbread and butter proceeded to blow our minds. No really... this raisin butter should be wrapped, packed and sold - this stuff should not be contained in one place... YUM! As if things couldn't get any better... it does. The Attic's take on a classic Vietnamese sandwich... Pork Belly Bahn Minis were out of this world - twice cooked, braised and boiled - soft, tender and to die for; as were their Warm Pork Cheeks served on a sourdough toast with a dab of Dijon mustard and a house made fig preserve.  \\n\\nSo I mentioned 'Omakase' earlier right? If this were a video game; this was the BONUS round! We were brought out the ANTELOPE Steak Frites... *OH MY* (spoken in BEST George Takei voice)... the African sausage was crumbly-ish in texture & filled with intense flavor behavior - sweet chili offered incredible sweet & spicy love! This was actually the first time eating Antelope and it was fantastic.  The Goat Belly was ridiculous! Soft, tender and Mmm tasty; topping a baked portabella mushroom - exquisite. Lastly was the Edamame - uber-sweet with a tiny hint of spice, sea salt and poprocks candy; Ridiculously amazing! \\n\\nOn to the phenomenal dessert. The Popcorn and a Movie - a salted popcorn gelato with house made candy bars (picture Twix and Butterfinger had a lovechild) & cracker jacks (YUM) all wrapped up with a root-beer gel... sweet, salty, and refreshing! Chocolate 7 Ways... simply put; death by chocolate. Now for the WIN - Caramelized White Chocolate S'More gasp! A decadent display of pure awesomeness - roasted and caramelized white chocolate mousse, graham cracker-hazelnut gelato and house made marshmallows... OMG; unreal - soft, smooth - utterly amazing! Swift's Attic is certainly a must go if in the Austin area; I give it 2 thumbs up and a get S'More!"},{"name":"GT Roti & Curry","address":"1790 W Sand Lake Rd, Ste B130","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We were recently in Orlando Florida celebrating our Thirty year wedding  anniversary.

Yes, it is not authentic Mexican, it is the Americanized version -evident by the \\"Elvis\\" platter.  It is touristy - Lots of kitschy d√©cor items - hubcaps on the ceiling; colorful interior paint all funkied up with garage sale chic.  It is cute and offers tons of punnily-named items on the menu and a wide array of margaritas.  To get the good stuff, you pay dearly.  But if a cheap tequila is okay, the frozen margaritas were a little over $6. I found the frozen mango to be quite tasty and a good counterpunch to the spicy sauces. Premium beers are $4.\\n  \\nThe food was tasty, although often a bit too spicy.  I had the Elvis fried chicken meal and opted down in spice level with the queso cheese topping, instead of the green chile cheese topping.  I tried a little on the side and it's VERY hot.  Spicy warning on the rice too, you can order it mild.  My husband loves hot, but thought that the hatch chile sauce was a little overboard on the hot side.  He felt it for days afterwards so you might take that as a warning, but he loved the flavor - smoky chipotle.

After most of the crowd pushed it way into the front dinning room. We tentively peeked into the dinning area... a waitstaff gave us the stop hand sign. When we were finally \\"waved\\" back by the waiter, we mentioned that we were new patrons, asking if it was a buffet or table sevice. At that moment, several paterons started arguing over a table. While im certain the offerings are excellent. The service was just awful and the crowd quite rude......I will be not returning anytime soon and would only encourage those who want to feel treated with less regard than cattle, to dine here. Management would be wise to spend some time on customer service skills, and dinning room managment."},{"name":"The Rambler","address":"4205 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Many places tout their patios in the summer but it's hard to find cozy places in the winter. This is one. We stopped in for a couple of hot beverages on a cold and snowy Christmas Eve and were not disappointed. We recommend the hot toddy and Irish coffee!"},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Ate here for the first time the other night. The place is cute and I like the outdoor seating. The food is definitely good... I just tend to like more full service kind of places so I was slightly bummed at the setup where you go order and pay and then someone brings your stuff... But whatever that's just me. I'll be back again for some more good food sometime :)"},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"Great margaritas, but the food is standard.  Ordered chicken fajitas as it is a popular dish and received the entree in under 10 minutes.  Service is fast to keep up with demand and operations seem to run pretty smooth.  Border, even with the new-ish loaction, remains firmly in the restaurant lore with Hilltop and Kowloons of landmark Rt. 1 Saugus dining destinations."},{"name":"Cask & Larder","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This is damn near as close to a genuinely magical place as you can find in Orlando, where the word \\"magic\\" is often bandied about with little genuineness or potency.  The dining area is always immaculate and full of little touches of luxury and comfort and overflowing with unique character, like the collection of prohibition-era glass supposedly found on site during construction.  The waitstaff is always friendly and helpful and seem genuinely invested in your experience.  The food is wildly decadent and creative, and it's always evident that the people in the back of the house have real passion for what they do.  Everything on the menu is fresh and in season up to the millisecond, and combined in surprising and inspired ways.  I'm not exactly a wealthy globe trotter or anything, but for what it's worth I can honestly say the cocktails and beer, almost all of which are originals or brewed in house, are the best and most interesting I've ever had.  The truncated bar menu is both fantastic and reasonably priced.

The first time we came on a Saturday night where it was extremely packed. It also smelled like puke that time by the door, but even though it stank, I didn't see any puke so either they cleaned it but didn't Febreeze or someone puked in a corner. Either way, thank God we were seating towards the back the first time. We had an asian server whose name I forget but she was awesome, always checking in and getting our drinks even though it was super busy. \\n\\nBTW this place has a co-ed bathroom which is all the rage nowadays but I just don't get it. I don't want a guy staring at me as I tease my hair and apply my makeup; it just takes the mystery out of girls getting dolled up lol. Am I the only one that thinks that? Maybe I'm old fashioned or just out of touch!\\n\\nAnyway, second time tonight and it was less busy (it was a Thursday night) but the music was still pretty good. \\n\\nOverall it's got a great vibe and atmosphere. People dress up here (it's Yaletown) and it's hard to find a table/seat but if you're patient enough it's worth the wait. Crowded but nice scene for Yaletown that's not a club. I would recommend because there's nothing really like it because places are either a club or casual bar, no lounges in downtown really. If you find a good lounge, let me know!"},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Super super yummy.

The line was not so long as other dinner places in the area. This is actually why we chose this restaurant in the first place. At the end it took a very long time to get our check, and I was in a hurry. Not entirely pleasant. The food we ordered (some pasta, osobucco) was decent but somewhat lacking in flavor. Bread was store bought. The downstairs area was loud (music playing) and somewhat reminiscent of a dungeon. The television was blaring some sports show which I found kind of tacky. Overall a fine experience. Not going to complain about a reasonable meal at a reasonable price."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Being an avid traveler and once a New Yorker, I have to say that this place had a very posh/NYC/London feel. As we arrived, we were greeted with a beautiful, graceful hostess- and had a short wait until we were seated. Our waiter was incredibly charismatic and knew the menu in extreme detail (which was helpful given the dim lighting and my vegetarian restrictions). He provided AMAZING recommendations based upon our preferences. \\n\\nThe plates, although small, provided a perfect portion of food to split and allowed us to try several different yummy dishes. I don't recall exactly what we ordered, but I know it was all very pleasing to the pallet. The drinks were equally as refreshing- the wine selection was awesome.\\n\\nOverall, great place- awesome food- just a bit pricey; however, a great \\"splurge\\" restaurant."},{"name":"West Coast Bento","address":"2368 NW Thurman St, Ste A","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"OK, so don't try to find this place using the accompanying map which has it gawd only knows where.  It's near NW 23rd and NW Thurman, rather than where the map shows it with a question mark.\\n\\nThis used to be across from the Uptown Shopping Center back in the days when Smith Hawken garden store and Calif. Pizza Kitchen were also in the area along with the Foothill Broiler.  \\n\\nThe chicken yakitori here is great and about 3 or 4 times the size of any chicken yakitori you'll ever find in a \\"real\\" Japanese restaurant.  There is minimal seating outside here but it's mainly a take-away place, no ifs, ands or buts.  \\n\\nYou can get lamb, beef or shrimp here but the chick on a stick is what drives this place.  I always get it without the rice cuz there's way too much rice for me to finish and I hate to throw it away.  I recommend the slightly spicy sweet chili sauce with the chicken and do get the teriyaki? sauce with the rice.  It may come that way automatically unless you ask for your rice plain\\n\\nThe baos are good too. \\n\\nWhy Willy Week doesn't list this among their best Cheap Eats any more is a mystery.  Think they used to do so."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Friendly and quick lunch time service.
