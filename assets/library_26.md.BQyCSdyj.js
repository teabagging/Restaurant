All of the sushi and sashimi that I've had are great and very fresh, and they have some very creative rolls to try as well as a large selection of hot food. The only thing that's a little disappointing is their shrimp tempura, which can be oily and usually has too much breading for my taste. Another downside is that sometimes they seem to offer multiple promotions (i.e. something like a punch card, coupons, joining some social media group for a discount), but last minute, they will tell you the promotion/discount does not apply for a certain day or for AYCE.

The restaurant has three sections: when you first walk in, there is an air conditioned dining area, then you go to the back past the rest rooms, and there is shaded outside patio seating. Then keep walking straight back to the third area with more air conditioned seating. The host, waiter and food runners were all very nice and provided great service. Now let's get into the food! Let me start by saying that everything that touched our table was absolutely amazing and fresh. We ordered two appetizers: truffle deviled eggs (bacon on the side) and the oyster boudin fritters (scrumptious). Both appetizers were really good, however, the oyster boudin fritters stole the show and I wish there was more on the plate, this is a must have!! Moving on to the next round, we decided to order everything from the chefs special menu. I got the Mediterranean Harvest Salad with the whipped feta goat cheese. This is by far the best Mediterranean salad I have ever had! The food was freshly sourced and seasoned to perfection. Each ingredient complimented each other making a freshly made salad. My husband and our friend ordered the Bacon Butter Stacked Duroc Pork Chop and I got the Shrimp fried rice with Red Snapper in a lemon butter blanc sauce. Absolutely deliciousness down to the very last bite. We were literally stuffed, but decided to split a dessert, hey, live a little right! The special dessert for the night was a blueberry pecan bread pudding with whipped cream and a side of vanilla ice cream. Now, I told myself I would only take one bite . . . Nope, I had three!

Others at my table ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and the house burger.\\n\\nThe pancake is very tasty and also VERY thin, these aren't fluffy buttermilk cakes but they are very airy and easy to eat without feeling full (I cute mine into thirds and layered on top of each other to make a more typical pancake thickness). The eggs were tasty and very buttery (which felt like too much after a couple bites). The chicken sausage is all sweet, no spices... like the meat was mixed with maple syrup and that's all. The burger is very generous in size and probably one of the most substantial items on the menu. The lemon ricotta pancakes melt in your mouth and I would recommend as a item to share with the table.\\n\\nFor a limited size menu with truly no substitutions (eggs come either scrambled or fried to a medium), you'd think that it would mean turnaround time would be crazy efficient. I'm fine with waiting in line for good food, but the hype + quality/price of food doesn't measure up. \\n\\nI don't have a overly healthy sized appetite and can normally not finish my meal, and I left hungry after already spending $15."},{"name":"NYC Bagel and Sandwich Shop","address":"2245 W Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This NYC Bagel is closed!

You can tell they pride themselves on experience from the moment you step in the door. You're immediately treated to champagne, as well as a steakhouse vibe with modern and Art Deco touches, but don't forget the white glove service. From tableside flamb√©, extensive wine list, salad chopped tableside, to poke on Himalayan salt, American Cut has the steakhouse perks of New York here in Buckhead. \\nLet's walk you through our food journey at American Cut. Starting with the salad, boring can be its middle name, but this time we got to see an entire double head of romaine, a large cracker and cheese crouton toast, and all its ingredients chopped right at our table. With pepper, mix of salty-sweet, and well-balanced crunch, the salad was far from boring. Beyond that, the next course was the poke on a Himalayan salt platform and some thick-cut bacon. You heard us right, poke ON Himalayan salt. this is when we realized every course has some experience that is different from the norm. This one was a pink salt platform that lent a salt to the delicious mix of tuna poke, creamy avocado, spice, and peaches. PEACHES! How did they get them to crunch like that? Plus, we don't know what they rub on their bacon, but it's like cocoa, coffee, cinnamon all mixed together! If you're like us, we love bacon. This one was no disappointment. Delicious, flavorful, thick, more please.\\nAt one point in the night, we looked over and watched a chef stroll out with a big pan and start to combine butter, herbs, brandy, and light in on fire. We talked to the server about what was happening. FLAMBE. Next time, we're getting THAT. We had filet steak with herb butter and a sea bass entr√©e. The best thing all night was that flaky, deeply rich, buttery sea bass. They kept the skin on which really yielded to the deep flavor and paired it with a pan-fried potato and rosemary, asparagus, and a splash of lime vinaigrette on the fish really gave it the brightness and depth. As for the filet, it had a similar succulent finish as the bacon, but more smoke flavor, butter, and chive. It was very tender for a medium well and had a nice, tangy finish from the chive. Where is my white napkin? Surrender.\\nWe're full.

Three coworkers and I came here at around 8pm on a Wednesday and ordered an appetizer of Artichoke Dip and a round of steaks for everyone. The dip was heavenly and creamy (not to mention enormously portioned). There were many huge chunks of artichoke throughout. The filet mignons themselves were incredibly tender and well seasoned. I ordered mine medium rare, and although it didn't bleed as much as I wanted it to (probably not the freshest cut), the filet was very well cut and didn't have any stringiness that I associate with low quality steaks. I loved the sides of crispy brussel sprouts and asparagus as well. The asparagus was very tender and the brussel sprouts were so good that we ordered a second helping of them for the table. \\n\\nComing from the bay area, $40 for a decent filet mignon is a fantastic deal.

Be sure to take a look at the menu beforehand to expedite the process for others.\\n-You can drink in line but they don't allow visible cans/glasses. I would suggest pouring it out into another cup.\\n-You can also buy beer from another counter inside the store.\\n-Small parking lot but lots of street parking.\\n-Bring lawn chairs if you don't want to stand for hours."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It is extremely rare that I compliment others' pie...

This causes huge delays when they could just have either a dedicated pos checkout for bbq orders or go through the line with an IPad to let people give their orders and pay and then just present a receipt to the food counter to get their order. We waited for 40 min and barely got anywhere. Unfortunately for us, my friend and I came inside to order a beer and realized how badly and inefficient the process is at La BBQ. We went back in line we waited about 5 more minutes before deciding to leave. \\n\\nThis isn't the first day they've had customers and I'm upset that it seems like they just are either ignorant or trying to make the line move slowly just to have the mystique about having to wait a la Franklins.

I am not sure what is in them but it taste like a delicious sweet honey mixed with a spicy Asian chili sauce. Fresh sage is tossed into the finished product. They were a real treat. \\n\\nLastly we indulged in a Cookies & Cream Milkshake. Every milkshake has a suggested alcohol \\"add in\\" to enhance the flavor. With Cookies & Cream you can add in Kuhlua. It was delicious.

By 11am, the line was out the door.\\n\\nThe bbq was outstanding.  Moist, tender brisket with a thick, peppery bark, pink smoke ring, and perfect amount of smoke.  Pulled pork was very good.  Hot links popped when bitten into with the perfect balance of tang, heat, moist, and smoke.\\n\\nBut the real stand-out was the beef ribs.  Giant bronto-ribs caked with that outrageously addictive, black, peppery bark.  The meat fell off the bone in hunks, with an amazingly moist, mouth-coating unctuousness.  We downed hunks of it like candy, sucking on the bare bones without care or embarrassment.\\n\\nLa has a fine selection of beers--bottles and drafts, big names and craft brews.\\n\\nSides were much better than the norm.  \\n\\nFranklin's gets all the hype, and deservedly so.

The flavors odd to bland and the atmosphere a bit lackluster. The fact that they were playing talk radio when we came in and the fact that the decor is second hand picnic-y could be excused if the food was really good. The short: It wasn't. \\n\\nThe long:\\nDeep Fried Collard Greens: Good flavor, but because they weren't cut into small enough pieces parts of them were greasy and limp.\\n\\nMac and Cheese: Pasta shells sprinkled with a shredded cheese mix and served in a paper container. It is pasta and there was cheese but without a really good cheese sauce to stick to the pasta, it's really not mac and cheese. It was ok.\\n\\nBrunswick stew: This one is a bit odd as the flavors were pretty good. The tiny pieces of potato were odd, but tolerable. It was really meaty and eventually, once I got over my expectations of brunswick stew, I really enjoyed this one. \\n\\nBaked Beans: If you are just expecting beans in liquid, great this one's for you. The flavor is excellent and if the beans had hit the table piping hot I would have really enjoyed them. But they aren't baked beans. Baked beans are a way to show off a really delicious barbecue sauce and usually feature a bit of sweetness to balance out the salty spiciness of bbq pork and chicken. These had none of that. They were a mixture of pinto and black beans cooked to perfect texture but in a thin savory liquid. Add a bit of one of the barbecue sauces on the table and it will improve the flavor tremendously. \\n\\nBBQ Chicken: Four slices of dry chicken that must have been either reheated or sliced off a good bit of time before we got there. The spices were really good and I expect smoked chicken to have a bit of dryness but this was a bit much. \\n\\nPulled Pork: Moist and pulled apart fairly easily but the smoke layer on the meat was pretty thin and the meat tended to be bland everywhere except on the edges. Add some Purple Haze and Hotlanta sauce to it and it'll go down pretty well. \\n\\nThe Potato \\"studs\\": Fried until a bit black on the outside. \\n\\nThe Peach Cobbler: Again, not really what I expected. It has a crumble top not a pastry one, so this dish is probably more accurately a Peach Crumble. The biggest issue is the peaches were under ripe and therefore had a horrible bitter/sour flavor to them. The sauce was bland. The only thing with any real flavor to this dish was the crumble topping. I was really disappointed by this as Peach Cobbler is one of my favorites. I could have made a better peach cobbler than this with frozen peaches. \\n\\nAll in all the food has some interesting flavors and some of those things work or at least would if the food was hot and there was a bit more due diligence going on. But I am offended that the side of the building says \\"Put a little south in your mouth\\" as what I had was anything but southern style BBQ."},{"name":"IQ kitchen","address":"1158 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"3","text":"Im a repeating customer.

Thai restaurants are one of those things that I feel everyone evaluates differently - but for me, I've had lunch, dinner, and take out from here - and it was all pretty forgettable. They have a great, affordable lunch special - which includes a lunch entree, salad, and spring roll (all for about $8) - but the food is average to OK.\\n\\nService seems pretty scatterbrained and even a calm version of chaos at times....lunch is definitely hit or miss on service, depending on the crowd. You might wait 30 seconds for a table, or 5 minutes. You might wait a few minutes to get a drink, or it might come after your appetizers. They have made me feel weird picking up a to-go order 5 minutes before they closed, which was just....odd.  I have tried their Thai Basil - and it just seemed like food court Chinese food to me - where was the basil, and oh - where was the Thai?? I have had several curries from them before, and overall the depth of flavor just isn't there, and they always seemed and looked oily.\\n\\nPortions are a little bit on the smaller side (I think for take-out they give you less than if you dine in!). A few positives: produce/vegetables always seem super fresh though, and the staff does seem to be working hard. The decor is decent, modern-ish but a little cold.

Sadly despite its name, the tea was not unfortunately up to expectation.\\n\\nBoasting organic choices, Tea Haus's menu is limited compared to the usually big selections at typical boba places to focus on quality over quantity. As a huge boba, my first instinct was to order the classic tapioca milk tea ($3.15 with tax for regular 20 oz) and at first taste, it was delicious! The boba was also fresh too judging from its texture and has a light honey undertone, but the amount of boba in a cup was rather small. After finishing the tea, I also became more thirsty afterwards - not a good sign since it is usually an indication of too much creamer powder.\\n\\nHowever, just when I was disappointed with the tea, the basil chicken brought this place back to me! Other places, either in America or Taiwan, sell fried basil chicken in small meat chunks that are often dry, but Tea Haus's basil chicken was huge in juicy chunks. Along with the classic Taiwanese fried chicken seasoning, the basil made the lightly battered chicken even more irresistible. For $5.95, you can get a nice portion of perhaps one of the best Taiwanese fried chicken in America and Taiwan I had.\\n\\nOverall, although the milk tea was rather disappointing, the basil chicken was enough to make me revisit again.

However, the kind person manning the reservation system acknowledged I am pregnant and suggested they could seat us if we could eat within 1.5hrs or so, as they needed the table in 1.75hrs. That was not a problem for us at all, as long as the food came out quickly. It was very kind of them to accommodate (and who knew my \\"condition\\" could get us such a perk?!)! Anyway, we're seated at about 6:15 (we watched the time because we knew they needed the table). The kind gentleman who seated us immediately served us warm tortilla chips and salsa following the menus. We were not seen by our server at all, but after 6:38 (the last time I looked at my clock), Kelli came over and said she saw us sitting here for a while, and she decided she could either, \\"find [our] server or serve [us] some water.\\" She gave us water and asked if she could offer other drinks and guacamole. The heaping portion of guac was flavorful, nice and chunky, and well proportioned with all the mixings. We were halfway through the guac and all done with the salsa when server Kelli came by with our other drinks. She observed the situation and replenished the salsa and warm chips. We waited around for a while again for our server, but no-show. Kelli came back and took our orders--not sure what happened to our server, but we lucked out to have her. Kelli was very sweet and attentive, and I'm grateful she gave me a pitcher of ice after I asked for a glass of ice, but something pulled her away after she cleared my husband's plate of Alambre a la Mexicana almost immediately after he was done eating. Side note: My husband really enjoyed his meal! Both sauces were so flavorful, but he liked the tomato-chipotle sauce better (I thought the tomatillo sauce was much better). Anyway, I finished my excellently flavored  and portioned Alambre de Camarones meal less than 10 minutes later (a beautiful marriage of flavors, and \\"picante\\" is no exaggeration!), but we didn't see Kelli for a while. We waited around for Kelli to give us the check at least 10-15 minutes after I finished my meal, and when she came out (after 7:30, the last time I looked at my clock), she thanked us for waiting patiently, as there was a situation in the kitchen that she \\"had to be present for.\\" Busy night, unforeseen circumstances. I'm just glad we got a table, delicious food, and excellent service from Kelli when she was available! I'm hoping this was just an off night in general, as we did a lot of waiting around without being acknowledged--no fault to Kelli.  We weren't in a rush, but we knew we had to leave the table within a certain timeframe...\\n\\nAll the individuals with whom we spoke at the restaurant tonight were very polite and kind to us, so that was a huge plus. We liked the upbeat music, but it was so hard to hear each other across the table. We ended up hearing conversations at the tables beside us throughout dinner better than we could hear each other.\\n\\nI came to this restaurant about a decade ago and had excellent food then, as well. I'd probably go back at some point, maybe at a different time or after having made reservations.

I, suddenly, woke up freaked out like a little girl and thought I saw the dead fish laying there.I looked twice trying to clear away this vividness, but I'm blind every morning since I don't sleep in my glasses--- I couldn't really clear up my vision . Instead since I was frighten, I ran to my roomie' s room scared out of my wits. She and I analyzed the situation-- New Jumbo is mad at me that I've been far from home. Either the latter or the person I use to go with cast an evil spell on me. \\n\\nAnyway, just so there isn't any confusion Jumbo Seafood is actually called NEW Jumbo Seafood now. I remember when the owner told us he was going to do major changes with the place (when it was just called Jumbo Seafood). But I think the only major change was the new giant sign outside the restaurant--it's bright and florescent orange. Nothing has changed much, and there was no need anyway. This Chinese restaurant is probably the best in the Boston area. \\n\\nThere are so many times I've gone to this place, always late on a weeknight, and always with my favorite person to go with. Us two, would order the fried squid with red pepper and salt mixed in with hot green peppers, or sometimes we'd order clams in oyster sauce as an app. Then we'd move on to soup--they have the best hot and sour soup I've ever tried. But for a change we'd get the seafood soup. For our main course we picked a fish out of the tank, and request that it be cooked with ginger and scallions--UNBELIEVABLE.  I'll be going home soon.\\n\\nPs. This place is great for taking your time not only for enjoying the food, but for great conversations as well.

Plenty of variety on those drinks as well such as lattes made with both Ghirardelli chocolate and caramel, coffee with a sea salt creme, and one of my favorite drinks in the world the Affogato which is normally vanilla ice cream and espresso but here they add caramel and chocolate to it too because why not?\\n\\nObviously they have a nice tea selection, but believe it or not they even have creative lemonades like coconut chia with mint. We got to try their basil chicken and brick toast as well. I've always been weird about chicken and hadn't eaten it in a while, so when I got a piece that was fatty that was it for me. Everyone else really enjoyed it though because the spices they use are amazing. Make sure to squeeze the lime on top first to even out the flavors.\\n\\nThe brick toast however was right up my alley. It's a slice of thick toast where the top has been soaked in sweetened condensed milk. Before serving they add sliced strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar. YUMMMM!

However, the service we received (and the rudeness following our expressing our concern to the manager) was deplorable and ensured we would never be returning. From the very beginning, our table was inexplicably ignored. It took them quite a while to even take our food order or fill our waters. Don't even get me started on the bread - we didn't receive it until well into our entrees. We asked about it about five times and each time received a curt reply that the bread was in the oven - despite the fact that all the tables around us received bread before us and when we did get our bread, it was cold and not piping hot like it just came from an oven. My friends meal came out about ten-fifteen minutes after ours and while I understand things cook differently, that length of time is ridiculous - particularly when she ordered the same thing as someone else at the table! Finally, after they plopped down our dishes without saying a word, no one ever came around to see how our food was or if we needed anything, and we had to flag the waitress for the check. The coup de grace was finding out they can only split the check on two cards - which apparently isn't even true, as by that point we engaged in a conversation with the manager about our dissatisfaction and he told us that we were lying and could split the check on my cards. I was, most of all, SHOCKED by how they treated our concerns. They preemptively took the late dish off the check, which was nice, but when we expressed our concerns about everything else they were rude and dismissive, stating that it was busy. I understand that, but if you cannot handle that amount of clientele, don't seat that amount. It seemed like everyone else around us was treated much more attentively than we were so I am not sure what their problem with us was (maybe that we are locals and won't take their crap?). But I was so shocked when, after the manager listened to our concerns, we could see him and his staff LOUDLY complaining about us and then he just threw the check back to us without another word. I didn't want a gift certificate or something, but at least a polite, \\"I'm so sorry for your experience and I hope we can see you soon\\" would be polite human behavior. As someone who has worked in service and just paid for an expensive meal, I was very upset with the treatment.

Before leaving, my mom wanted to use the restroom and noticed still no paper! So I went to tell the rude server that said the terrible comment \\"hey my mom would like to use the restroom can someone put some paper in the stalls?\\" She said \\"oh no one has put any?\\" Called someone and still did nothing.

Nothing special.  We strayed from a favorite restaurant located next door where we have gone for more than 2 decades to try this place that had been highly recommended to us.  We were headed to a concert at the Garden.  Since we knew it would be a busy Friday night in the North End, we made a reservation.  When we walked in, the older gentleman asked us \\"how many\\"  (note, not a hello, not anything!) and I mentioned that we had a reservation and gave our last name.  He said he didn't have any record of our reservation, and, I mentioned who I spoke with he just nodded (bad start, should have turned around then).  We tried to make small talk as we waited with him and another couple in a very small area at the entrance to the restaurant at the base of a set of stairs.  He seated us and gave us menus still not saying anything, so strange.  We waited about 10 minutes for someone to come to our table and say hello and we ordered our drinks and dinner together.  The waitress (so we thought)  wanted me to upgrade my Kim Crawford Sauv. Blanc to the reserve brand, I said sure.  She came back and said they didn't have it.  and then waited another 10  minutes before our drinks were delivered.  We ordered. We should have savored our drinks since it was virtually impossible to get another one.  Our meals arrived, chicken parmigiana and veal parmigiana.  My husband's was fine but my homemade noodles with sauce were cold, not even warm.  Our drinks were empty about 5 mins before the food hit the table.  It took about 10 minutes to get someone to get our waitress.  She came over, I told her about my meal, she took it back. At the same time, we ordered drinks, I switched to a mix drink and my husband ordered the same thing.  Another 6 minutes go by and she returns with our drinks but brings me another wine.  I mention that I ordered a mixed drink and inquire as to what the problem is, lack of service, etc. and she says, \\"I am not a waitress, I am the bartender and we are really busy\\", NOTE, no apology ever.  Also, if you are the bartender, how did you not know you were out of the wine you recommended and how do you not remember a drink order.  I have worked as a waitress, a cocktail waitress, a hostess and at corporate at Fortune 500 restaurant chain, this is unacceptable.  My husband was upset because it is so infrequent that we have an opportunity to go out to dinner without children.  He just wanted a nice meal with drinks and good service. We picked La Famiglia Giorgio's and they didn't seem to care.  My  meal came back, it was fine.  Nothing special.  In the meantime, our server went out to the man that was serving as host (now we presume he is the owner or manager) and presume she told him the chain of events.  She brings our check and tells us that she removed my meal, again, NOTE, no apology.  We pay and leave and still nothing from the \\"host\\" at the door.  Don't bother with this place it is not worth your hard earned money.  They don't care that you are there, it shouldn't be stressful and difficult to patronize a restaurant.  Maybe hire a few more people or at least have waitresses be waitresses.  Obviously the tempo is set at the top, no urgency no emotion and no cares.

I haven't had a problem finding good barbecue in metro-Atlanta, but a lot of places have good Q and then fail or do 'okay' on the sides.  Since I figured that TDH's BBQ was probably good I went with a non-traditional request.  The way I see it, if you're gonna put a non-traditional item on the menu of BBQ'd items, it better be good! I took the jump and ordered the BBQ Turkey Ribs.  ...yeah, I know.  WTF, right? Look, I would never even think to put Turkey Ribs on a BBQ menu as an entr√©e because I didn't even think that turkeys had ribs big enough to satisfy an adult human being.  Maaaaaan was I wrong, and I kudos for TDH to even think about making them! The ribs were a good portion and they were slightly crispy on the outside from the fire and tender on the inside.  The fact that they were tender tripped me out because I thought bird ribs were considered white meat, which normally dries out on a grill.  Not these.  If you're looking for a traditional BBQ meat alternative, try these ribs.  You won't be sorry.  The sides also get notable mention.  I had the baked beans (very good), and the mac 'n' cheese (also tasty), a cornbread muffin (loved their sweet cornbread with butter), and I was able to taste the collard greens (very good too!), the TDH cocktail (had to try the namesake), and the Hennessy Peach Tea cocktail (you can't NOT order sweet tea in GA).  I really can't complain about anything that I ate or drank here, although the parking lot is a bit small.  Aside from that, I'm dying to go back and try some more traditional BBQ options and ANOTHER cocktail.  The only thing stopping me from leaving 5-stars is that I have to try the brisket or the ribs when I go back; something more traditional that is the standard by which BBQ is judged.  Keep up the good work TDH crew! I'll be back, and if I taste that the traditional entr√©e options are as good as everything else I tasted you definitely will get 5 stars from me!"},{"name":"Toast of the Town","address":"348 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"4","text":"On Sunday morning my family and I went here seeking breakfast.

As for taste, it's like eating a very crispy, fatty piece of steak that well done. \\n\\nSauces, again, just a-okay. The vinegar based on was pretty good and the other sweeter one was too sweet. \\n\\nThe wait is horrendous, even more horrendous as you watch only 2 people weigh out the meats slowly. Like, ive had authentic bbq in other cities and they weigh out their meats as well, just not as laboriously as they do here in Austin. I know that's the culture and it builds suspense.

It's not local based on asking a few different servers on different occasionss. And no information on the Tilt web site says anything about the sourcing. Also, the burger is not a local farm or higher quality purveyor, thus, it comes from the industrial food chain. Likely, a confined animal feed operations (CAFO). Know this--if you do know what farm or source is providing the beef and it is not organic or pasteur centered, it is likely CAFO! \\n\\nCAFO = best value! CAFO costs less due to high density stocking of the animal. If you have ever driven by a CAFO operation, you'll see thousands of beef cattle standing in mud shoulder to shoulder--not as humanly treated like cattle grazing on open range. CAFO cows get sick, get injections of antibiotics and hormones to fatten cup.  However, I get-it, the FDA regulates practices that are safe for the consumer for the industrial food chain. But what is in the beef? I know, but best you do your own research!\\n\\nSo chow down, Tilt does taste good!

Our table was ready at the time of the reservation and we were quickly sat down. The waiter brought around menus and quickly sold us on guacamole for the table. We then put in drink orders. Drinks came about 15 minutes after the guac was served. I chalked it up to 12 mixed drinks being a relatively large task if the bar was busy.\\n\\nBut then...the waiter didn't return for quite a while to take our dinner order (or even check in on drinks). About a half hour passed between the guac and our orders going in. Thankfully, our table was full of friends and we passed the time.\\n\\nOne of my guest attempted to order enchiladas without the sauce. The waiter was unsure if the kitchen could do that, which is completely understandable. The waiter put in the food orders, never returned to the table and so, of course, we assumed that the adjusted order was acceptable.\\n\\nWhen our food did come out - the whole table was served at the same time...except for that one order. My guest encouraged everyone to dig in, assuming his meal would come shortly...but it didn't. A hostess came over and told my guest that the chef refused to make his order. Not that he would make something else...but he simply refused to make it as ordered.\\n\\nI was immediately upset on his behalf, but being my birthday, he was gracious and accepted a substitution of another meal, but I was miffed that he wasn't told prior to the entire table getting their food. Why wouldn't the chef immediately send the waiter back to our table and say that he had to choose something else? That would have been FINE and he would have happily ordered a substitute.  It was a calculated decision to not make his food and to me, it showed an extreme lack of care of concern for their clientele.\\n\\n\\nTo note: not everything went wrong. I very much enjoyed the guacamole as always, the queso fundido was again, very tasty and overall, I enjoyed my steak tacos as well.

I wish we had prettier plates in the hotel room to get a shot of the inside but we forgot them. When we had picked up the cake, one of the employees told us that we could leave it out and it would be fine but since we had taken a few pieces out the cake, it collapsed the next day and we weren't able to get a better picture.

By the time we came across this I was out of options.\\n\\nThis restaurant is like all Golden Corral's and trust me I have eaten in enough of them. They are everywhere! You get an all you can eat buffet of home style food. This restaurant seemed a little older than other I have been in, for example worn carpet on the floor but my daughter is a golden Corral fan so this place was more than adequate. There was a sign on the wall that said this was a model restaurant but I don't know what that means.\\n\\nSome things that were different than the one by us is that when they carve the meat for you they really give you a huge portion. When my daughter asked for a slice of beef she couldn't believe the portion cut for her. She asked if the slice was all for her and the guy said yes and when you finish come back for more! The also did a great job of having the bags of cotton candy ready to go that seems to be lacking in other locations. They had scoop yourself ice cream that I haven't seen before elsewhere. Table service by John was excellent. He never let a drink go more than half way without refilling it. He was constantly clearing plates and was extremely attentive. Other than that everything is pretty much the same as any other location. I really enjoyed the steak and cheesy potatoes on this trip. It helps if you like fried foods when you pay a visit.\\n\\nAs always I ate way too much but the coffee they provided me with dessert woke me up enough to make the final leg home. In addition to the hot items and cold salads there is a full buffet of desserts. Cakes, pies, cobblers, and of course the chocolate fountain.

Everything is clean and neat inside with plenty of space to sit. They have a variety of desserts from cakes to pies. \\n\\nMy husband and I ordered cappuccinos, a banana-carrot cupcake, and a slice of peanut butter pie. The cupcakes were really great; moist with still having the texture of the veggies inside. The frosting was lemony and sweet, but not overpowering. The peanut butter pie was also good and tasted almost identical to the real, dairy-filled thing. We liked the banana cupcakes so much we took some to go. I wasn't expecting much on the cappuccinos, but they had a good espresso flavor and foam ratio. \\n\\nThe baked goods taste delicious for being gluten-free. As someone who recently had to go on an elimination diet to determine food sensitivities, gluten-free just isn't the same as the carbolicious, soft baked goods/breads I've been used to. These desserts come in VERY close to the original, and it's definitely worth the price of admission if you DO have food sensitivities. However, if you do not have an intolerance for gluten or are vegan, the price tag may not be worth it to you. You can get similar (if not better) quality at other places for a lower price.

There also has to be value. In this case, it has friendly service if it's not busy. The service may be slow sometimes, but the last time it wasn't. A thing to be sure of is high prices for tiny amounts. For what you pay you should be full. Even for lunch it's still too much and there's no smaller portions to choose. This may be because the portions can't get any smaller. It's the same for any entree. The portions aren't enough for what you pay. I had the tofu curry. The curry comes with a choice of brown or jasmine rice. It's about $15 for the tiny amount. The tofu tasted really good and so did the vegetables.

I got down to my last slice and really felt like I had to chomp down to get a bite. I went with my team at work and everyone felt the same way. Also, upon first glance, looking at the list of stuff underneath each pizza name makes it feel like there's a ton of toppings on it. But then you realize there's mainly just one meat and the rest are just drizzles of some sort. Makes me a bit sad. I love their soda machine in the back but the options are too no-mainstream for me.

Also nobody in there helps you or talks to you unless it's another customer. I mean nobody that worked there even acknowledged that we were even there. I was clearly having an issue with the screen ordering system. I couldn't even ask for help, because every time I moved towards the direction to ask, the employee just kept moving further away and turning her back towards us. I used to love Wendy's. Now I don't think I'll ever go back to any Wendy's not just this location. No point in it when I don't get my fast food fast!

At Chilacates, they load their quesadillas with a blend of perfectly melted cheese, with an appropriate amount of meat (had the carne and the shrimp because...well, because I can). Cooked an the stovetop just like grandma's. They give you lettuce and healthy helpings of sour cream and guacamole ON THE SIDE AS THEY SHOULD BE. Also some delicious pico de Gallo to top it off. Oh, the best part? They ask everyone if they want hot sauce. That in itself is a great metric for the quality of your Mexican food joint. They are essentially saying \\"hey, we know the food isn't complete without our bomb-ass salsa verde or salsa roja, so in case you forgot to ask - we got you\\".\\n\\nTheir elotes also look bomb and aren't overpriced foo-foo-fancy gentrified garbage (lookin at you, EVERYWHERE ELSE IN BOSTON).

I ordered the grilled squid combo with minced meat and he ordered the grilled beef with plain white rice. The squid was pretty good and not chewy at all. The portion size for the squid was also larger than I expected considering the price and left me more than satisfied. We also loved the seaweed salad that came with the plate. Both our plates came with a regular side salad, seaweed salad, a vinaigrette dressing, and two pickled vegetable slices. My husbands grilled beef portion was on the smaller side but the overall plate left him satisfied. We also ordered two different types of tea which took longer than expected because they didn't have so many options that were on the menu. I don't know if it's because they recently opened or if it's just been a high demand. My husband asked if they had dairy free options and the man at the register said they didn't even though their was a Lactaid (Lactose free milk) bottle of milk behind him on the counter. I thought that was a little odd, but we decided to just let it go and order something else. They were also out of orange tea and grapefruit tea. He decided on the passion fruit tea and I decided on the melon tea. The passion fruit tea was significantly sweeter than the green tea, but they were both refreshing and delicious. My only thing is that I don't think I can justify paying $10 (after tax) for two of these teas again. Don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but a bit overpriced for the size. You could get a similar tea in a bottle at a supermarket or corner store for half the price and wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I would say the food is worth the price, but the tea not so much. Also, the use of space in this intimate restaurant is awesome.

So half of appetizers get put out at cocktail hour...and they were supposed to all have been set up before the ceremony started so my guests didn't see people setting up during the ceremony. \\n\\nDinner was late too of course..appetizers and utensils that we paid for to use FOR cocktail hour were put out at dinner because they were so late. \\n\\nThe 12 bags of ice we paid for didn't get used..they were late. NO ONE got ice in their drinks at the bar I spent crap loads of money on. \\n\\nTo top it off NO ONE has contacted me this entire week after my wedding. Not one lousy email! Nothing. \\n\\nI had so many vendors and guests coming from Portland and NONE of them were late. Catering was THE most important and high dollar vendor that day, and they ruined everything. \\n\\nI can't get a do over..I paid for late cocktail hour food, late dinner, late utensils, late ice, and horrible service. I am SO upset. \\n\\nThe mariachi band that was hard to get in contact with even showed up on time. My cake showed up on time...everything but the $3,000 catering showed up on time. Imagine that this was your wedding day. Imagine the things you paid for not getting used...your guests not getting food..no ice for drinks...and then the company couldn't care less to at least apologize after the event or try to make it right. \\n\\nAbsolutely disgusted with the situation. Anyone that runs a good business knows how to be on time for important events where you're paid $3k to be there. Anyone that runs an honest business knows you empathize with the customer and make it right when you've wronged them and the damage is irreparable. \\n\\nI'll never support this company from this point forward and I will never recommend this company to anyone. If anyone from the company reads this I hope you can reflect on this situation and think about how much you negatively effected our one day..and how you failed to do a single thing to fix the damage.

I must have been very lucky that day. Line wasn't long as I recall, and the staff was friendly. And the food was good enough to make me want to come back, but not overwhelming.  Went to go a second time a couple weeks ago, and what an awful change it was.  Line went clear back to the door entrance, seemed to take at least an hour or more to get to order, with inconsiderate self centered millennials line jumping in front of me, joining their friends already in line. One dirty punk weasel even tried to slip/sneak right in front of me in line, but it wasn't going to happen! I'd had enough of that already!  But the staff was nice again this time, which doesn't seem to go along at all with a lot of other reviews I've read. But this second time it was the extremely unfair price of the food and the dangerously unhealthy animal fat/oil content of the beef rib and the one link of sausage I ate that assured me that I must never consider this place ever again!  Seriously, I felt like I had consumed at least 1/2 cup or more of animal fat/oil after eating a beef rib and one sausage link. Seems like the health department would/should look into this and check it out. I would imagine they have cracked down on other eating places for far less offenses.  And the price?  One beef rib, 1 pound of chopped beef and one sausage link came out to $78.00.  I had to settle for those choices because they were out of sliced brisket and pork ribs three hours before they closed.  And the sausage had tough knots of gristle and the casing was very tough.  This place seems to have perfected the art of screwing the hell out of its customers better than any place I have ever seen, and I am 56 years old and have been eating barbecue and mostly dining out my whole life.

Though I don't like to admit it, I'm a pizzaholic at heart, and I deeply appreciate a good slice of pie.  So why does my love for Crazy Dough's burn as brightly as five stars?  For one, Crazy Dough's has chewy but not overly soft crust, which is fantastic.  Second, their sauce is wicked good: \\"plum tomato sauce blended with roasted garlic and fresh herbs,\\" to be exact.  And they manage the sauce well, adding enough to bring flavor without being drippy/sloppy.  Third, there's cheese for miles yet not a ton of grease (I think because they use low-fat mozzarella).  Fourth, the price is right.  Yeah, their prices have spiked a tiny bit recently, but what food prices *haven't* spiked recently?  I think it's still only $6.00 for two slices of cheese and a drink or $7.00 for two slices of 'roni and a beverage.  On that note, though they have more versatile options, I have only ever gotten cheese or pepperoni here (as it should be in a joint with paper plates and plastic forks).

We came here around Sunday at noon and the line wasn't too long. The line took up about half of the line area inside and we waited for about a half hour. We ordered 1.5 lbs of brisket (we asked for the fatty part), 2 beef ribs, 2 chipotle sausage links, a personal serving of pickles and a personal serving of the beans, and 8 slices of bread for four people. The prices seemed to be lower than online, with the brisket $20/lb and chipotle sausage links $4.50. The beef ribs were only marked as \\"market price,\\" and they ended up being pricier than expected so we did experience a bit of sticker shock when our final meal price was tallied up, but I would say it was still worth it for our first visit. (It totaled about $125 for four of us, but we definitely were stuffed, so you could get away with ordering less)\\n\\nThe brisket was an absolute dream - it was incredibly tender and moist, with the fat practically melting off and a remarkable smoke ring. The beef ribs were also amazingly tender, with a well-seasoned crust of spices on the bark that lent great flavor. They're also huge, so be sure to bring at least one friend if you want to try some - otherwise, you'll fill up on just one rib alone! The chipotle sausage was made with a nice size grind, creating a hearty texture that isn't too fine. I don't usually enjoy sausages at barbecue places, but I thought this one had a perfect balance of texture and flavor. If you're planning on ordering some sausage, I suggest getting the chipotle sausage while you can - it was the first item on the menu to sell out while we were eating. \\n\\nThe pickles were too sour for my taste - at one point, my throat practically closed up from how incredibly sour a slice was. The beans were really flavorful, with a hint of smokiness and really nice and saucy. For bread \\"rolls,\\" they use Martin's potato slices, which is a welcome step up from standard white bread. I'm still appalled that we had to pay for bread, but I guess that's the downside of going to a new school hipster barbecue place over an old school joint. There's a choice of two sauces, with one more vinegary and the other sweeter. I preferred the sweeter one, but the more vinegary one is still pretty pleasant and not too sour. \\n\\nOverall, the barbecue was absolutely amazing. Brisket is definitely the best bang for your buck here, and, as always, brisket reigns king of Texas barbecue. The beef rib was also great, but at practically 1.5x the price of brisket, I'd rather double down on brisket next time. If you come alone, I suggest ordering a half pound of brisket and an order of bread (50¬¢ for 2 slices) to make your own sandwich. You'll get a much better deal doing that over ordering one of the sandwiches on their menu.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure they keep only one person working the barbecue register and one person cutting the brisket to artificially slow down the line. They're not nearly as efficient as Franklin's and they could speed up orders over twofold if the cutter would just slice faster! One of the registers is kept open for Quickie Pickie sales, but they could go much faster if they used it for barbecue orders in between drink sales. The line here might be shorter than at Franklin's, but it's definitely not nearly as efficient. Given that you can still catch brisket here before it sells out without waking up at the crack of dawn, however, I can see myself coming back here far more often."},{"name":"Tang Dynasty","address":"18070 NW Evergreen Pkwy, Unit C","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"Saw this place when it opened and finally got here.

There was happy hour from 5 to 6:30PM so we were able to get the appetizers for around 5 dollars. We chose the crispy brussel sprouts and eggplant fries. Both were excellent! The brussel sprouts were so thin and crispy and the eggplant fries were fried to perfection. \\n\\nFor entree, we got the candies pork belly and crispy chicken. Both were excellent!! The pork belly was so flavorful and tender. I will say that it was a bit salty but this place is called the 'salty sow'- it was still delicious. The chicken was crispy and the fingerling potatoes were so soft and paired nicely.\\n\\nThe service was excellent. We came with my husband's 98 year grandma. She was nervous about cutting up the chicken so she asked me to ask the chef and waiter to cut up the crispy chicken entree. I asked and didn't expect them to but they did! It was so nice and I can't express how much she appreciated it. Oh and they had some deal in July 4th that was buy one entree, get one free so the bill was very reasonable (but this place is already reasonably priced with very good food!)"},{"name":"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen","address":"875 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Me and my husband went to this Cheddar's on a stormy Monday evening (Aug 26, 2019).

My husband ordered an app and a salad before his meal and all the food came out at the same time. When the food came, my husband said I thought this was my appetizer, the waitress said \\"its a slow night\\".  Ok, I guess.  My husband ordered the chicken pot pie, and I ordered the fried shrimp with a side of mac and cheese and french fries.  My husband enjoyed his app and meal, but my fried shrimp actually tasted like it was sitting under a heating lamp.  They definitely were not cooked fresh and it also was more bread crumbs than shrimp.  I was hungry but I lost my appetite with the first bite, but did not want to complain.  I did not touch the macaroni and cheese, it looked like the most driest mac and cheese I ever saw! Nope, not eating it. I actually had immediate indigestion!  Ive had much better meals from Cheddar's in the past, but I told my husband Im not coming here anymore, not worth the stomach pains!

The dishes were otherwise pretty good. The interior of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous with artwork all along the walls and gorgeous hung beads in the windows that have peacock designs.

Good.\\n\\nHousemade sweet local corn ravioli with sauteed arugula, roasted red peppers and fresh sage - two little ravioli with delicious sweetness married with the bitterness of the arugula. Very nice dish.\\n\\nSalad:\\n\\nBaby Spinach mix with sliced pear, toasted almonds and fresh tarragon - this was a throwaway dish for me. I didn't need it and it wasn't anything special. It tasted good, for sure, but after the amazing tuna...I really didn't need the salad.\\n\\nEntree:\\n\\nSlow-cooked beef short rib with black truffle, garlicky greens, and stone-ground gorgonzola polenta - I'm not sure what I can say about this that hasn't already been said. I mean...melt in your mouth short rib...with truffle...garlic...and cheesy polenta. What's not to like!?\\n\\nThere was also a seasonal dessert platter, but I honestly can't remember much about it.

I'll start with the pancakes.  They are literally the best I've ever bad, bar none.  I ordered the buttermilk.  Everything from the flavor to the texture was perfection.  Secondly, I do like the location, the aesthetic and the atmosphere.  I'll be sad when the day comes that this place is flooded with big families and loud groups that push the wait times through the roof.  All that being said, given the pancakes and the establishment itself, the name \\"Pancake Social\\" certainly fits.  Great place to sit and have a nice breakfast.  In a perfect world they'd ban computers from this place because I can already see tables being taken up for hours by people facebooking on their MacBooks.  \\n\\nI understand the area and a la carte menu items being costly but I got what I call a \\"thin slice of egg\\" which was a little disappointing for $5.  Also, my companion and I both got triple stacks of pancakes but we each only were given one tiny jar of syrup--reminiscent of a place I recently visited in Toronto where waiters were literally (and I do mean literally) coming out of the kitchen with endless cups of syrup for customers who requested more than the default serving.  Most annoying:  My waiter seemed to be better at making conversation than actually making sure we were okay.  We had to wait around 15 minutes just for salt, ketchup and extra syrup...which we eventually had to ask another server for.  Then our waiter came and took my syrup while I was still eating!  We watched him go back and forth between the tables on both sides of us and for whatever reason he became too busy taking their orders and pouring their coffee to remember to bring us what we needed as our food got cold.  9 times out of 10 I tip $20 as a minimum for good service.  That day I tipped just under $4.00.  \\n\\n\\nAll that being said, the pancakes alone are a reason to go back and I will.  Plus I won't judge the place (especially a new one) based on one waiter."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love me some BBQ. When we started planning our girl's grip to Austin, I immediately thought of Franklin BBQ. However, we didn't want to spend over 4 hours in line on our short weekend in the city, so my friend did some research and decided upon la Barbeque. \\nWe ordered brisket and beef ribs, with sides of potato salad, shells and cheese, and house made pickles. The brisket was really good. There was a nice red ring around the edge of the meat, and it was tender and delicious. The fat just melts in your mouth. But what really stole the show for me was the beef ribs. I am usually not a huge fan of beef ribs, mostly because they don't usually get it right. But la BBQ gets it right and then some. It was smoky, fatty, meaty, and my absolute favorite bite of food from that entire weekend in Austin. I literally kept thinking, 'Oh my God, I need to come back to Austin with my husband so he can taste what I'm eating.' The shells and cheese were a gooey queso-y mac and cheese dish, that was perfect in a bbq setting. The potato salad was also really good and provided a little bit of mustardy brightness that complemented the fatty beef. House made pickles were also really good! They were vinegary and actually pretty spicy. I enjoyed the spiciness, but I just want to warn people that if they cannot handle heat, they might want to order something else.\\nWe came here before they opened on a Sunday morning. The market itself was open, so they let people wait in line inside the building. We waited about 30 minutes for them to start taking orders. Not bad at all for a top tier BBQ joint on a long weekend.\\nNow, brb, while I dream of the beef ribs!"},{"name":"Ceili's Modern Irish Pub","address":"7311 Westminster Highway","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Kay and Simon went over for a couple of beers at New Year's Eve early in the afternoon it was dead there's like four people in the whole place that's the so cold I could see my breath and it was so cold you didn't need to put the beer in the fridge you can see his breath you told me to turn up the heat be home in hard and did nothing for IT services pretty bad and they're frozen sitting there two of the guys caught the flu they're going to avoid this place so just be careful or maybe folding them and let them know to put the heat up you don't want to go and grab a beer when it's bloody cold"},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"\\"Honest.\\"\\n\\nThat is the word my friend Penny used to describe the dishes emanating from El Naranjo, a new(ish) food trailer that has garnered some serious buzz since arriving on the scene about a month ago. Indeed, just a few minutes of visiting with owner/chef Iliana de la Vega helped me understand the element of her food that so spoke to me, but that was so hard to put my finger on:\\n\\n\\"I cook as if I'm cooking for my family,\\" she said. \\"I've just expanded my definition of 'family' a little.\\"\\n\\nYes, the meal we shared here - under the trees, in the rain, tended to by a welcoming Chef de la Vega, who insisted on pulling dry(er) chairs out for us from under the awning of the house where her trailer is parked and wiping them down herself - spoke of community, of tradition, of family. For me, the mole in particular - a rich, complex concoction tasting deeply of chocolate, paired with tender pork - evoked a feeling of comfort that seemed somehow larger than the dish itself.\\n\\nWe also sampled the molotes, little cigars of corn masa that were stuffed with either chorizo and potatoes; or plantains, black beans and cheese, then fried ($4.25 for three), and an order of tacos, one al pastor and one cochinita pibil. At $4.50 for two generously-filled tacos, these are the bargain on the menu.  We crowned our meal with an order of fried plantains with cream ($2.95).\\n\\nDespite the modest surroundings, Chef de la Vega - who previously owned an acclaimed restaurant in Oaxaca  also called El Naranjo and who is currently an instructor at the Culinary Institute of America - takes as few shortcuts as possible, making most everything from scratch. The one exception to this, at least at the moment, is that they purchase their tortillas - but that may change in the future when they have more space (they are hoping to eventually open a restaurant in the house where the trailer is currently parked).\\n\\nEl Naranjo is showing Austin, once again, that remarkable food can be found in the most unexpected places. I loved everything we tried here and am thrilled that Chef de la Vega and her family have decided to expand their definition of \\"family\\" to include Austin."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"Picked this place based on other reviews and extremely happy with this place!

Food server just stood there looking at the plates and finally moved them aside, stacking them on top of one another.\\n- Clueless server didn't know whose entree was whose.\\n- Entrees sat there getting cold while they went to retrieve silverware.\\n- Wine was never poured when the entree was served.\\n- This one is the killer ... because they rushed to serve the entree, my fish was undercooked.  I cut into it to show the waitress it was undercooked so she took it away.  Meanwhile, my husband sat there awkwardly with his food in front of him.  When the indifferent waitress finally came back, I mentioned that my husband's food was still at the table; she said \\"let me take this and get you a fresh one\\".  Well, a \\"fresh one\\" turned out to be the same food \\"brought up to temperature\\".  And the part of the fish I pulled away to show was undercooked was gone ... $26.00 for a piece of fish that was missing 1/4 of it.\\n- Complained about receiving the same fish \\"brought up to temperature\\" and the cold, indifferent waitress sent over the cold, indifferent manager who stood there like she had better things to do, explained that they couldn't simply throw the food away (Really?  at $26.00 for a piece of $4.00 trout??) and said \\"do you want me to give you dessert?\\" (Really?  An $8.00 dessert to compensate me for a $26.00 piece of fish??).  We told her no.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering dessert and despite the fact that we said we didn't want the \\"free\\" dessert, we were charged for it.  Wouldn't the right thing to do have been to comp the desserts?  Or maybe the $20.00 corkage fee?  Or something??\\n\\nWe are big fans of Bacchanalia and Abattoir so my hope is that Anne Quatrano reads reviews of her restaurants and fixes the staffing and service issues that could create the demise of what could otherwise be a great dining option in Atlanta."},{"name":"Kabayan Grill Filipino Restaurant","address":"1328 North John Young Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"Finally made it.

If you catch them with a good special you can get amazing chicken and a great deal. \\n\\nPopeye's sides are also amazing. I don't know what's up with whatever artificial flavor they use in the beans and rice but it tastes better than my legit Cajun beans and rice recipe. I've tried to replicate it several times but with no luck at all. \\n\\nIf you're hungry you cant beat Popeye's!

Its been along time since I tasted some authentic American free Mexican flavors.  Love the fresh home made authentic quality of the food.  The prices for what you get are fantastic.  I was expecting them to be higher.  The restaurant is in a fantastic renovated house on Rainy Street, and has a great modern homey charm.  \\n\\nYou have to start out with the Guacamole and chips.  When you say fresh, they don't even make the guacamole until you order it, can't get fresher than that - simply amazing.  My friend had a mole, and I had a Rellenos.  The server was also great, and knowledgeable about the menu.  He let me know that I could try two different types of the Rellenos, even though that wasn't an option on the menu.  There is also a choice to do a tasting of the 3 Mole's, even though that isn't on the menu either.  But, my friend decided to just get the 1 Mole, and I chose the taste of 2 Rellenos (Cheese and Pork).  Everything was fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  They even included in the cost of the food brought out a tasting of their 3 salsas and some hot fresh rolls.  I couldn't fit the rolls in, but tried the salsa with some left over chips, and they were great.\\n\\nMy only problem was that my stomach was too small.  They don't even have a dessert menu, as their pastry chef makes everything daily, and the chocolate almond tart sounded good with homemade ice cream.  Yep, they even make their own ice cream, fresh.

There is only one co-ed bathroom, and what I like is that they have the sinks outside. This is smart because if there was a line, it makes it go faster. Also, I think that having the sinks outside encourages hand-washing because people can see you (for all the gross people out there who don't wash their hands lol)\\n\\nThe staff is always so friendly and helpful.

Also, the milk tea is pretty bomb, and the bobas/bubbles in it have a really good consistency and texture. The grapefruit green tea was okay. I think I should try it again with less sweetener, so I don't want to set my judgement on it just yet. The basil chicken is so worth it guys. I got it after being full from eating hopdoddys across the street, and it was still amazing. The subtle basil flavor is perfect, and I like how it's a lot of meat and not just thick pieces of batter.

Small drink was also $2.00. These price hikes of course are attributed to being close to so many willing paying Disney trip goers. So as for the 3 star review it is what it is a slightly more expensive Mc Donald's experience that is slightly cheaper than eating at the hotel. \\n\\nAlso this Mc Donald's does not participate in many if any of the promotions.

However, it was fresh and I really liked the amount of cilantro in it so I got over the lack of advertised spice and just compensated by licking the rim of my cocktail.\\n\\nI had the Alambre de Camarones for dinner which is Grilled wild jumbo shrimp marinated in garlic vinaigrette with tomatoes, onions and serrano chiles, over achiote rice with salsa verde picante. Plated it resembled shrimp resting on a bed of rice that formed a sort of barrier between two green puddles on my plate which made for a colorful feast for my eyes.\\n\\nThe dinner was satisfying if not extraordinary. The spice was there on this dish a little and the flavors hit all of my tongue.\\n\\nThe real star of the night was dessert.

I absolutely love the semi-traditional exterior architecture, the small, yet, cozy interior layout with tables and booth, the freshness of the meat and vegetables served on the dining table, the interesting side dishes that usually come when ordering an entree. The restaurant itself is a bit small on the inside and they tend to get extremely busy on the weekend. Therefore, I would recommended coming during the weekdays to avoid the crowd. If you have a large group, I suggest call and reserved a table ahead of time! \\n\\nWhat about the foods? \\nMy family, friends, and I personally love to grill our own meat (need to order at least 2 portion of meats in order to use the grill) so we usually order Galbi/Kalbi, brisket, and pork belly, which are seasoned perfectly according to our taste buds. Personally, I prefer the meat here compared to anywhere else since the quality is better and taste fresh! In addition, we would order seafood pancake, spicy rice cake, crab rangoon, mandu or dumplings, and a soup of either galbi tang or seafood soft tofu. And of course, the complementary side dishes are a plus! Usually there are kimchi, pickled radish, carrot, cucumber, fish cake, bean sprout, seaweed, mashed potato, all of which as its own distinguish flavor. I like the fishcake and bean sprout, so I would always request for more (w/o additional fee or anything!). \\n\\nFor the authentic ways of eating grilled meat, Soju and Sake is a must! It helps the meat better better 2x. And it is a good way to relieve stress and bonds with family member and friends. \\n\\nDessert? I am not a big fan of patbingsu (shaved ice) but it taste refreshing during the Summer. The macaroon are in mini (so cute) and does not taste as sweet. The aroma and the texture are perfect! I tried the hotteok for the first time last week but it is hard to describe how I feel about it.

The ravioli at Buggattis and the smoked Salmon tortellini at Pasta Pronto are both substantially better flavored and are priced way less. \\nAfter our food arrived we were avoided by our server,  matter of fact she never came back after dropping off some parmesan.

Even after she gave us to-go boxes it took her about another 30 mins to bring the check and we were more than ready to go because the food was not good.  I got an order of tamales, they barely had filling and the little filling they did have was bland.  Then they were covered with some meat and bean mixture that did not redeem them.  They took away from whatever flavor the tamales were SUPPOSED to have.  My husband got a chicken chimichanga and he said it was baseline at best.  The chicken inside was not well seasoned but it was ok because chimichangas are covered in queso and hard to mess up.  Lastly we got an order of chile rellenos to share.  I was expecting a stuffed pepper, NOPE.  The plate was covered in cheese.  The cheese was so overwhelming I couldn't taste the pepper or anything else.  The dish was some kind of fried bread thing, idk what it was, it had ground beef inside and a lot of cheese and the thinnest most over cooked slice of pepper at the bottom.  I will not be going here again.  That food was not worth it.  I have had better $0.25 noodles.  Save your money\\n\\n\\nUpdate:  I was so disappointed in this restaurant that I had to go eat Mexican food somewhere else.  I ate at La Parrilla in Toco Hills.  It was great.  Go see my review on it."},{"name":"Route 1 Grill House","address":"817 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3","text":"Went to grill house about 3 months ago food was great , steak tips and the burger was excellent.

I was in town for the week and wanted to stop for a bite to eat. I took the sky bridge from the Marriott Marquis here to Peachtree Center. Initially, I was going to dine at Ray's in the City across the way, however, I became leery of all the random stragglers following me around downtown. That said, I decided to enter back through the CVS doors and down the stairs into the food court area. There were a number of options: Moe's, Subway, Dairy Queen, Aviva and, GLC. Initially, the reviews persuaded me to try GLC for the huge grilled chicken wrap or salad. However, as I continued to walk, I discovered more food options. There were long lines for Chick-fil-A and Checkers, but I wasn't interested in something I could get back home or elsewhere. I would've loved to try Farmers Basket, sadly it was closed. \\n\\nBistro 7 peeked my interest. They let me sample the honey chicken which was similar to orange chicken. The grilled chicken and curry chicken were also tasty. I liked the assortment of vegetables being offered, so I made the decision to eat here.\\n\\nThe honey and grill chicken satisfied my appetite. However, I wish they would've seasoned the cabbage and cooked it a bit longer. It was very bland. I've had better plantains, but these were decent for a food court. The rice was pretty good, I doctored it up with the extra gravy I asked for from the chicken.\\n\\nAll in all I had an OK experience here. I will not likely return because there are just way too many other options in the food court and in the general downtown vicinity.\\n\\nI'm torn between giving this place 2 or 3 stars. The service I received was really good and deserved a solid 4 stars. The chicken entr√©es were pretty good, but one piece had what seemed to be a bone in it. No bueno - 2 stars. The sad vegetables were bland. And, some were undercooked. They were only 1 star worthy. And, the egg roll was an epic fail. All in all I give this place 2.5 stars.

Staff was very welcoming and the place was very clean and neat seeing as it was a bar. Being a college student myself I related to a lot of the younger staff. Very chill environment. My companion and I were offered to buy something off of their seasonal drink menu. I ordered the Apple Cider Mule which was better than I expected. As for the food, we ordered the $2 chicken slider, the $2 onion straws, a classic burger with a sub of mac and cheese, and teriyaki wings. The food was amazing. Everything came out great, each plate with great flavors. The mac and chesse is a must if you ever visit. I was skeptical at first because I like mac and cheese a certain way so I ordered the regular bowl. It was very cheesy as creamy and it was served in a unique way; the penne were all turned upright so that when they poured the cheese over, the cheese would also get inside the actual pasta which I think is very clever. The chicken slider was so good; it was gone in a couple seconds. The onion straws were perfectly cooked and the sauce paired nicely. I didn't try the teriyaki wings because I had a burger but my companion finished them quick so I'm assuming they were good  overall great experience"},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"10000 Research Blvd, Ste 142","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"My son digs it and I have gone with him a couple of times.

The pie was okay. They forgot the avocado I asked for for my second order (which was a Mad Andy), the egg was supposed to be over medium, but it was over hard. The cashier was not rude but wasn't all that pleasant either. It felt like I was bothering her. I didn't want to come back to her to tell her the avocado I ordered was missing because I didn't want to deal with the attitude that I could see from her face from just ordering food. \\n\\nIt's an interesting place, especially lately with tipping being 15% (?) of your order added to your bill, which I think is not okay.

My review is only really about the cooked meals. \\n\\nMy first visit, I chose the Chicken Katsu Don. It came with miso soup (very good -- loved the tiny, cubed tofu) and cucumber salad (very tasty and fresh). The chicken was perfectly cooked, with a nice crunch to the coating. However, missing was the sweet, tangy sauce that I'm accustomed to. The chicken was served dry, with the sauce on the side, which is perfectly fine, but the amount of sauce provided was laughably small. And it was very thin and mostly just sweet, so I found it disappointing. \\n\\nTonight I decided to try the Teriyaki Chicken, and I really wish I hadn't. It was hot but sort of greasy, and there was no discernible sauce. I requested some extra sauce on the side, and like the katsu sauce, it was kind of thin and sweet. The vegetables were the typical broccoli/carrots/cabbage that many restaurants seem to buy in bulk, which I don't mind, but they were overcooked. The chicken itself was all dark meat and kind of... spongy? I found it to be unpleasant and only ate about half. \\n\\nI'm giving three stars because I did like the katsu don, and next time I will ask for a bit more sauce (tho I do wish it were thicker and tangier). And as I said, the fam likes the sushi, so I'm giving Akira a bit more credit for that. \\n\\nI do like the decor and atmosphere, though I wish the lighting wasn't quite so bright and coldly fluorescent.

Luckily, not only is Contigo friendly to your taste buds but also friendly to your canine child. The hostess was very accommodating and made sure that Atticus, my pup, had a water pan to keep him hydrated and, consequently, also unnecessarily muddy. Our waiter, tall and bearded, didn't seem to mind my puppy's antics, his friendly disposition challenged only by my fascination with his personal style. To be fair, I have a distinct fascination with people's beards and the urge to shave them.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was friendly and casual, the restaurant consisting mainly outdoors. It was East Austin hip: filled with lots of jorts, plaid shirts and girls with boys who look like girls. I think the place would be great for a date or just a casual time with friends and puppies. I thought the food and drinks were excellent. The Old Fashioned had a nice kick, smooth but with enough oomph to fill the warm whisky down your throat. I really enjoyed the lamb pot pie I ordered, my only wish being that the portions were slightly bigger. I opted for the S'mores desert made with homemade graham crackers.  While the chocolate and marshmallows melting in my mouth was both instantly gratifying and enlightening to palate, I was slightly disappointed by how little you were given.

My husband felt the salmon could have used just a touch more seasoning but then he likes his food really spicy.  My duck was excellent and perfectly cooked, the skin was nice and crispy but the duck meat was so tender and delicious.

The richest, thickest dulce de leche you could imagine, with its salted caramel and whipped cream had me forgiving instantly the two weak martinis I'd had with dinner.\\n\\nI a nutshell, the Salty Sow is a worthy meal and Austin experience.

A female employee was standing in one spot off to the side with her back to the dining floor the entire time we were there.

However, I can share my experience from stopping in for a drink with my girlfriend.  O'Leary's bills itself as a neighborhood bar; I liked the vibe, which is reminiscent of a traditional Irish pub hence the name.  My visit was in the dead of the afternoon.  There were a couple of regulars at the bar.  I told the bartender of a similar pub next door that was called \\"The 1006 Lounge\\" where we would hang out often during college.  She said someone was in the other day who mentioned the \\"1006\\" and I told her that it was well known for many years; not sure when it closed.  Nevertheless, she did not seem very interested in a nostalgic walk down \\"memory lane\\" nor very interested in new customers.  Usually I've found that if you go into a local watering hole and your face is fresh that people generally are a wee bit more welcoming in the hopes that you'll become a regular.  As such we opted to finish our beer and move down Beacon Street in search of another venue for drinks and dinner.  O'Leary's could amp up their customer service.  Just saying.....  Otherwise, give them a try if you want to experience a fairly quiet pub with a full menu that is moderately priced for Brookline."},{"name":"Floramo's Restaurant","address":"213 Everett Ave","city":"Chelsea","stars":"4","text":"I'm grateful I don't live too far from Floramo's because I will be back.   This place is nothing to look at, especially from the outside.   However, it was packed when we arrived.   Clearly it's a neighborhood favorite, and now I see why.\\n\\nTheir menu is extensive, but the clear stars of the show are the steak tips, as they have them listed in multiple selections.    Actually, they have so many choices of different meats in different variations, I don't see how you can go wrong.  A low carbers dream!  \\n\\nI settled on the steak tips with 1/2 rack of ribs.   The salad that came out first was fairly bleak, but the main dish MORE than made up for it.   The ribs, of course, fell off the bone as the place boasts, and the bbq flavor of the steak tips was music to my taste buds.   They were so tender and tasty, that I could not stop eating.\\n\\nOther reviewers have talked about how big the portions are, and it's true, so although I ate until I was ready to explode, I still was able to take some home for lunch the next day.   And everything was just as good.   I will say the meat is 100% their specialty.  The sides were so-so.     Nothing to go nuts over.\\n\\nI've read other reviewers commenting about slow service and I can see it.  Ours wasn't the best.   We had to flag down another server to get the attention of ours.

American Cut has a very nice ambience, perfect for a date or just hanging with friends. We started at the bar located on the main level. They had a happy hour menu until 7 weekly, but I didn't really see any drink specials. I paid $15 for a smoked Old Fashion, with no orange or cherry. It was just okay. Stella beer was $9 so I'm not sure what type of happy hour this is? We were escorted on the elevator to the second level for dinner. I ordered the tomahawk steak for two, twice baked potatoes, and spinach. The sides were good and the steak was tasty I ordered a bottle of Merlot recommend by the waiter. I must say that all staff were attentive, and very accommodating. I did have to send the baked potato back because it looked either overcook or old. The second order was only a tad bit better, the part near the skin was rubbery. I was a bit disappointed by the attire that I saw. I thought this was an upscale restaurant, so I felt that the atmosphere and prices dictate a certain dress code. However, there were quite a few men that came in with tennis shoes and t-shirts.. This was part of my 50th birthday so I let them know that I was celebrating. They brought me a plate with Happy Birthday written on it with an extremely dry piece of bread pudding. I could only take two bites, it was that bad. To my surprise I was charged $8 for this mediocre dessert without ever being told. We ended the night on the third floor, which is partially enclosed with a rooftop view. Very nice atmosphere but not sure why they have limited inside seating. Most of the outside tables were reserved. I also wondered why we were escorted upstairs after having the remaining wine corked at dinner. There's only one way in and out, which is on the first level by the hostess stand so it's not like you can take the wine with you without being noticed. The escort couldn't even find us an appropriate place to sit to finish the wine. I ended up standing at the bar. The Old Fashion was better upstairs, at least I had an orange peel. I'm also glad we decided to take a chance and sit in one of the reserved areas to finish our cocktails. No one ever showed, and it appeared that most people walking in decided to sit at the reserved sections too. There was a one-man band when we first got there. I expected the band to play at around  9 since the week before the band played at that time. Upstairs tends to get crowded so I suggest getting there by 8,  particularly if you don't want to stand at a table and around the bar all night. This night, we were told the band would sstart around 10. That was a bummer! Overall it was a nice evening, but probably wouldn't go back to the restaurant unless it's a special occasion. I may return to the rooftop lounge on the third level."},{"name":"Rustica Pizza","address":"146 - 148 Belgrade Ave","city":"Roslindale","stars":"3","text":"The service is great.

For the entrees, I have tried the Gnocchi al Forno, the Penne Gorgonzola, the Rollati di Pasta, and the Baked 4 Mushroom Rigatoni.

First, there's the ambience. A house converted into a restaurant, Lupo feels like you've been invited over by a friend to enjoy their Italian grandmother's specialties. It's cozy and welcoming, not pretentious. Then, there's the service. Our waiter was lovely, but the entire staff made a point of checking in with us, keeping our water glasses filled, and making sure our needs were met. Finally, there's the food. Wow. While other places might heap on the flavors, Lupo seems to specialize in simplicity, letting the ingredients speak for themselves. Example: I ordered the special, fresh noodles in a light, buttery sauce topped with truffles added at the table. Probably four to five ingredients total, but the effect was pure magic. Easily the best pasta I've ever eaten. Honestly, everything we sampled was mouth-watering. The burrata was light and melted in the mouth. The wine was perfect and kept chilled, the waiter deftly refilling our glasses when he noted they'd run low. The desserts were light and creative and simply delicious. I feel like I can pick and choose things I liked less than others -- the mozzarella appetizer, for example, wasn't my favorite, and I didn't love the lemon tart -- but that's only because some dishes were so amazing that they set the bar insanely high.

Not much care seemed to have been put into its preparation since there were pieces of onion skin, fatty skin, and a small bone. Dumplings were bland. It was enjoyable, but not great. Our meals were good. They came somewhat cold and were nothing special. For desert, I ordered red velvet cake. The bottom layer was frozen and the cake itself was a bit dry. Their silver was in dire need of polishing.

I would think just for the sake of self-interest and avoiding liability, SOMEONE would care.

All baked goods are vegan and made in-house with plenty of gluten free options. Weekends are particularly special because there is a rotating menu of vegan donuts. The lemon meringue donut was pretty incredible. The texture of the donut was doughy and soft and fried to perfection. The ratio of lemon curd filling to meringue was perfect. The meringue was like real deal, light as air, whipped egg whites. \\n\\nOn our first visit, we had the Monte Cristo, BBQ pulled jackfruit, and the old bay cauliflower as an appetizer. The cauliflower was in large chunks and some areas were a bit under done. I love cauliflower in any form, so this didn't bother me. The fried old bay coating had good flavor and the remoulade dipping sauce was just as tasty. I wasn't the biggest fan of the Monte Cristo, it was actually a bit dry due to an overcooked egg. The pulled jackfruit was good. The barbecue sauce had a nice rich flavor and the texture of the jackfruit flaked up like some slow roasted meatiness. \\n\\nI've also been here twice for brunch, the first time we ordered the vegan Harvard omelet and red flannel hash with tofu scramble. I was hooked. The menu is just as vast as you would expect from a traditional diner, but those are serious crave worthy dishes. The omelet is crispy and crepe like in texture. The filling with the kale, roasted garlic and the smooth vegan cheese sauce is the best combination of flavors. The red flannel hash was meaty and I like adding their house made salsa on top. The bits of raw onion add to the texture and flavor. The big fluffy biscuits are the perfect vehicle for sopping up that dreamy vegan hollandaise. All that comes with a generous helping of scramble tofu and a heap of potatoes. And there you have the best version of eggs benedict I've ever tasted. \\n\\nWe also tried the chocolate silk pie and seasonal pumpkin pie. The chocolate pie came had a chocolate pudding filling and topped with mile high whipped cream. It was hard to believe it was a vegan dessert.

We went over to the cash counter and she explained to us that as first time guest in the Hollywood Fino we would receive a five dollar voucher that would allow us to utilize it at one of the machine. She was so very nice, I hate I forgot her name, but she was an Indian lady. I remember her because she got so excited when I said my name was Anisha. Indian people tend to get excited when they find out my name because it's of Indian Origin lol. \\n\\nAfter chatting with her she told us to walk over to the first time guest machines and use our vouchers where we can win up to $5000. Unfortunately I only won five dollars so I used that five dollars on the penny machines.

We pick the Chinese restaurant and I ended up getting the date and broccoli with rice. My sister got the crab Rangoon's as well as the spring rolls.

Deviled eggs were tasty and musky. Farm salad was a mouthwatering combination of arugula and frisee, bacon lardons, beets and cucumbers and shallots and blue cheese, tossed in a tart and sweet light dressing.\\n\\nFor mains: we ordered the NY strip steak (a special) and the duck breast. I don't know what I was thinking but I asked for a medium for the NY steak - big mistake - do rare or medium rare. It was delicious in a red wine sauce, served with duck fat fingerling potatoes and smoky garlicky greens, but was quite tough (my fault - I played myself). Duck breast was interesting over a bed of mashed potatoes and crushed olives for saltiness. I think the duck itself could have been salted more on its own and the dish could have done without the olives. It was also very emollient and fatty and I think the fat / skin could have done with some extra torching around the edges to diversify the flavor a bit.\\n\\nEven though we were full at the end of the meal, we were beyond glad that we ordered the Mexican creme br√ªl√©e to share. One of the best creme br√ªl√©es I have had in a while because it was fresh-torched. The custard was cool and creamy and juxtaposed with a hot, hard crispy top.

They were a lil greasy on the outside instead of crispy. The insides are pur√©ed which was different then chunkier versions.  I felt I was missing the peas inside.

I thought the tikka sauce was quite vibrantly orange as was the paneer. The consistency of both sauces was fairly thick, fairly smooth but not liquified with an Emerson blender. As for the flavors of the sauces, I felt I needed a bit more flavor. We did order mild which could have been a slight factor. The chicken was all white meat and cooked well. Personally, I wish the meat had marinated longer. It needs at least 24 to 48 hours. You can easily identify this by looking at the ring around the meat. If you are using white meat it needs longer too.  To me the sauce tasted very fresh and actually felt healthier then most indian restaurants. I feel that they used less butter and cream and relied on more pur√©ed veges.  This was actually a pleasant surprise! Both sauces were similar in qualities with subtle flavor differences. I enjoyed them both but a lil more flavor would have taken them to the next level.  They make their own hot sauce which is very good and was the X factor for me to accompany both dishes. \\n\\nI feel that their prices are very good compared to most other Indian restaurants.

They are open! \\n\\nWe decided to phone in takeout about 6:55pm. It took several tries to get through. A nice man took our  order. He asked for my name and number. We ordered  kind of a lot because we can never agree on things,  we want to try a representative sampling, also we like cold Chinese leftovers for the next two days.  \\n\\nHe said 20-25 minutes.

He said oh will you look at a menu? I said no we already called it in. \\n\\nHe said , please list what you ordered? I said it's under Janet. He said no please what did you order? Well embarassing. I said broccoli chicken,  potstickers,  Szechuan tofu...\\n\\nHe said ok. He came back with two bags. It was very crowded in the area now. There are no chairs there. He gave one bag to a couple, he came over to us and started reading the receipt and I heard \\" broccoli chicken potstickers tofu\\" and said yep and then he said $56 which seemed higher than I thought it'd be and handed him my $60 ( I usually tip way better but that was all my cash and I was not gonna credit card in that chaos) and we escaped. \\n\\nOnce home we realized my kiddo's small egg flower soup and the house special chicken appetizer were missing.

I came in checking out the menu and seeing it was set up like a lot of other recognizable restaurants like Chipotle and Poke restaurants. As i stood there looking over the menu at first i didn't know how to order. I didn't get a greeting  to invite me in to order everyone was pretty much hanging out until a worker yelled out \\"I know what you want!\\" and i approached and seeing that she had the bowl ready in hand for my order.\\n\\nShe quickly asked step by step what i wanted and i quickly answered in same speed, I grabbed a little cup of Kimchi and checked out by another worker. The price was a little above $9.00\\n\\nFood review:\\n\\nThe food as a whole was just okay. The meats were precooked and the whole bowl was cold (even the rice). The pickled veggies were all delicious and perfect. The kimchi went in a different route using a different type of cabbage (more like a chinese style) but, pickled well. The meat was a little watery which pooled to the bottom of the bowl but had pretty good flavor to it. \\n\\nThe rice was just weird, it tasted like day old rice that you usually make fried rice with. It was grainy, didn't clump nor did it soak up any of the flavor leaving a dry taste every bite you take. Even the next day it didn't soak up anything and tasted super dry. The gochujang (they call it Korean chili sauce) was laid on too light to be desired. I've had way better fast food type bibimbap.\\n\\nEnd food review\\n\\nI'm not quite sure why they called this restaurant Bibibop when the actual dish is called Bibimbap (now everytime people order this dish at other restaurants they're going to call it bibibop IMO). What makes this a fusion spot is the option of corn, kale cheese, black beans, potatoes, and all the other sauces that's not gochujang (korean red/korean chili sauce).\\n\\nIt's not bad for an Americanized Korean food spot that doesn't try to teach you the culture of Korean cuisine (or how to pronounce or name some dishes properly like bulgogi, gochujang,  even pronouncing bibimbap correctly, sorry my heritage is kicking in). That's probably my main gripe. it'll be really cool if they gave a little insight of the culture in the establishment for diners. Like purple rice is really black rice or multigrain rice (didn't really check it out), bulgogi is grilled meat, bibimbap is mixed riced (with other ingredients). \\n\\nI checked out their website to see why they named their establishment bibibop with no avail. Their website talks briefly or show some culture and one of the tag lines is \\"it takes a lot of history to create something new\\" but i just didn't buy it on my visit."},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"155 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Went here as part of a work group.

The filet was delicious! Great flavor and juicy. Devoured it all! Two filets for $24, and you can pay extra for a third. The brussel sprouts were yummy, and were presented as a crunchy salad with a mixture of sweet and salty flavors! I wanted to get the other desserts but opted for the creme br√ªl√©e because of the sheer size of the other desserts! All in all, I had a wonderful and complete dinner. Left very satisfied! \\n\\nOne con was the single seating area which was in a corner, facing the window and the back of the heads of other guests on the other side.

My friends thought their pasta dishes were only okay as well. The parmesan souffle served puffed up in a ramekin, it was more like a bland puck on the plate and the crispy piece on top was stale.

His response - slams $5 bill on the table \\"don't do that again!!\\" Guess they missed out on customer service 101.\\n\\nAlright, maybe it was a one time thing let me try again - Bartender (girl, dark curly hair) is sitting on the ground, face in her hands and looks seriously sick. I asked her if she was ok. Her response was that she ate some \\"organic mushrooms\\" and that she was feeling sick. Hokay...\\n\\nSuch a shame.

The food is good and as a vegetarian that dabbles in pescatarian eating occasionally there's a lot of choice which is not always the case when it comes to breakfast eateries. I like that they're sub-friendly too so you can take something out but sub in something else in its place, some places won't do that either. \\n\\nThat said a couple of negatives: it's really crowded during peak hours, and the first time we went there they squeezed in five people at a four person table right next to us.  The girl next to me was so close she was elbowing me, her perfume made me nauseous and she was one of those girls that likes to shout at her friends about mimosas.   Normally I can handle that, but not when she's been squeezed in to my personal space. It's just not for me.  Second you do sometimes come out smelling like the food and I dislike that, but it's forgivable as the building is older and I imagine ventilation isn't the most recent. \\n\\nThe second time we came back we were earlier and breakfast was a beautiful and peaceful affair.

Let me just say, it was one of the loveliest meals I have had in a long time. Point of reference; if you have ever been to Charleston, SC, you will walk into Floataway and feel like you just saved yourself a 6 hour drive. \\n\\nIt is a bit of mystery trying to find the front door. It is in one of those warehouse areas where everything looks the same and the words are engraved into hard to read signs. when you are looking, just hear my voice like yoda saying, \\"Go all the way back!\\"\\n\\nOnce you are inside, you will suddenly feel like you have \\"arrived\\". It's very peaceful and chic. I am a sucker for places with great furniture and this place was designed by someone with a definite sense of style. Think spa resort, think shabby chic, think I need to request banquette seating.\\n\\nORDER:\\n1) Kumamoto oysters: close your eyes as your slurp these from the shell. the taste in your mouth is ocean... the cleanest, freshest, oceanest of ocean flavors. The gentle texture of the oyster bestows a sensual and pleasing feeling that like so many things... is only too fleeting. Now you know why oysters are aphrodisiacs.\\n\\n2) Caserrece w/ Veal meatballs; beautiful plate. the pasta was obviously handmade and fresh from the kitchen of some rubenesque \\"Mama\\" in the back with a white dusty apron.\\n\\n3) Vegetable plate: semolina gnocci, spicy eggplant caponata, charred corn. Being a non-meat-eater, I thoroughly enjoyed the gnocci, eggplant, and mussels as my entree course. The vegetable offerings were too delicious and interesting to not try. The gnocci was soooo delicious. Like biting into baby's bottom each time. I do have my suspicions the sauce had meaty bits, but oh well. As I say, once you've bitten into someone's bottom, there's no turning back ;)\\n\\n4) Gulf Blue Crab Fritter; perfect portion. When i inserted my fork, big flakes of crab meat fell from the fritter. I love knowing they use high quality ingredients. the tomato jam provided the perfect amount of sweetness and acid to create the perfect bite.\\n\\n5) Bangs Island Mussels: If you know me, you know... I always order mussels if they are available... I don't care how you spell the month.The mussels arrived in a red sauce perfect for dipping the charred garlic bread. delicious.\\n\\n6) Palate cleanser of 3 sorbets\\n\\n7) warm Toffee pudding\\n\\nWe ordered the calamari also, but due to a mix up in the kitchen did not receive. The restaurant was very apologetic and brought out the sorbets as an apology.\\n\\nWe did not leave unsatisfied.

I really don't understand that you order anything in the form of food, and the server asks if you want a side which normally comes with your sandwich. So far that makes sense. What doesn't make sense, is that you would be under the assumption that the side is no charge. This is certainly not the case at Local 7. If you want horseradish with your French dip, there is a tiny cup that comes with it, but they charge $0.50 for it. If you want a special sauce that would normally come your fish sandwich, there is an charge for that sauce.\\n\\nWhat they don't tell you when you order anything that has a side dish with it, there is an upcharge.\\n\\nThere are a lot of bar type restaurants out that give you the side at no additional charge, but Local 7 isn't one of them.\\n\\nSo when you come to Local 7, be prepared to bring extra money as I am not surprised if the charge you for the free glass of water, but charge you for the ice."},{"name":"Hooligan's Sports Bar and Grill","address":"8220 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Great service and great food especially for the price.

That's not to say waiting in line for an hour-plus, as we did with La Barbecue, isn't a worthwhile expedition. It's just that a half-pound of Rudy's extra moist, a jalape√±o sausage link, potato salad, banana pudding, and a sweet tea that's ready immediately hits the dang spot. But I digress.\\n\\nThe most enjoyable part of the hour-long wait was our ever-increasing hunger and, because a good majority of that wait happens indoors, eye-inducing jealousy. We got to the point where our group of four was more than ready to order 2 (or 3!) whole beef ribs, in addition to the trough of other finely smoked meats. Which we promptly did at the cutter, until said order was in excess of a benjamin, at which point our brains promptly reset to sensible and we ordered the one. So, beef rib and brisket are the stars, because Texas, obviously. Now is a good time to note that La Barbecue does take advance orders, similar to Franklin, with two subtle benefits. First, unlike Franklin, you can order said beef rib as a pre-order. Second, you can purportedly eat the pre-order then and there, rather than having to truck it off-site.\\n\\nOther non-beef based meats were fine, too. The sides are a bonus plus. The mustard-based potato salad is above average and the mac and cheese is borderline exceptional. For added funsies, like Rudy's, La Barbecue has a retail section where you can pick up your finest craft brew for the wait in line.

No worries, I am not a huge restaurant complainer, but I will not quietly drink from a glass with funk on it either.  Waiter sucked.   Looked at me like I was unreasonable, there was actual baked on food from the dishwasher on this glass.  Idget.   Not much of a grasp of the English language, not a good waiter in any way, but smiling and nodding took our order and got around to us  eventually.   I noticed chips and salsa on other tables, we never got any and he was not around enough to inquire about how things were going etc.  My first bad tip in a loooooong time. 2 bucks for this clown, maybe he will get the picture.\\n\\nI ordered a beef brisket chimichanga.  Sounds like a great idea right?  It would be and someone that knows how to cook should make one and sell a couple million of them.  There was very little brisket into what was mostly a mostly flour  tortilla, deep fried.  I will say that the flavor of the little bit of brisket that was in there was pretty good, but I really couldn't get a great handle on how good, as there was not nearly enough in it to justify a 12 buck burrito.   A couple of ounces tops, no kidding at all.  The bed of lettuce that accompanied the scant other needed garnishes kept nudging me to leave as it had that just pulled from the bag vibe that makes me certain.  Could have used some salsa, but the waiter was nowhere to be found...Oh, and an 'artful' squirt of sour cream on the burrito was done is such an amateur fashion that I was kind of embarrassed as the attempt to be 'fancy'.   Rice good, beans dry and needy...just weak and like a 3rd world dining experience.\\n\\nWife had a salad with blackened salmon on it.   The fish was quite good really, and cooked well.  The salad did not seem to come from the same bag that my chimi did.

The service was really bad & not efficient at all . The second issue is the food , we asked for 2 different main dished of grills , the meat was not cooked at all , inside the kefta it was still RED with blood . The same thing happed with the other dish . I know that tips is given upon satisfaction of the customer either to service or to the food .

You can do a blind taste test with ten different people, and the majority will not be able to taste the difference. \\n\\nMy bf stood in line at Franklin's while I waited at la BBQ. We tasted both and could not tell the difference for the most part. \\n\\n1. Pro: la BBQ has the best looking beef ribs I've ever seen. Franklin's, TMK, does not offer beef ribs. Con: I was in line very early, and some very greedy people in front of me ordered several beef ribs, (there was one guy that ordered over 10 from what I could see), and they ran out two people before me. I wanted to shoot myself. \\n\\n2. Personal Pro: The sausage here is better than Franklin's because it's spicy. But you may not so YMMV.\\n\\n3. la BBQ has a better sauce in my book. It was a bit tangier and spicier. Again, your personal taste.\\n\\n4. Con: You won't get beer in line like you will at Franklin's.\\n\\n5. Con/Pro: To me the meat was too soft.

Everything else was exactly the same to me. I agree with other reviewers, the brisket here is fatty greasy, but that is because unless you specify a preference, you are getting half moist and half lean with every order. If fat bothers you, go all lean. Franklin's was the same deal. Pork ribs were EXACTLY the same as Franklin's. Fall apart, fell off the bone before I could even sneeze on it.

Do yourself a favour and stay away from this place. I would give it a lower score if I could. The service that I had at this restaurant was among the worst I've ever experienced in my life. I will never visit this restaurant again. \\n\\nI was really hungry and excited to visit this place for the first time. The staff greeted me in Chinese and continued to speak in Chinese until I told them I don't speak Chinese. I shrugged it off but I thought it was unprofessional of them to assume my nationality. I asked for some recommendations from the server and I got a blank response from the server. Expressionless blank stare. It was now evident she did not speak fluent English and she eventually pointed at the pork buns and dumpling lunch menu saying \\"Everything good.\\" I was lost at what to order but opted to go with pork bun, spicy pork bun, shrimp dumpling, pork dumpling, and spare rib.\\n\\nThe server took my order and came back with another server who spoke English. He told me that spicy pork was not available and recommended the chicken deluxe bun. I agreed. In literally 30 seconds we got the pork bun and chicken deluxe bun. They were cold. Intolerably cold. On top of that the chicken deluxe bun was the worst tasting bun I had in my life. The chicken was dry, hard, it didn't even look like chicken. More like mashed potatoe. I called the first server and asked the bun to be exchanged for a warm one. She responded with a sneer \\"microwave?\\" I eventually got in touch with another server who spoke English and he was able to exchange my chicken deluxe bun with a  regular chicken bun. The bun this time around wasn't cold but not warm at all either. The contents of both buns were lackluster at best. It was 75% doughy bun no exaggeration. Barely any meat. I left good 50% of the buns on the plate. The dumplings were pretty tasty. Soft and flavorful no complaints there. But the spare rib oh boy. Stay away from that dish. Nothing but bones and three bites of stringy low quality meat. \\n\\nTo put the nail on the coffin, the waitress by the counter did not know how to use the debit machine. She waved over another younger waiter and proceeded to serve another customer's dish without even saying or making eye contact with me. The younger waiter punched in a few numbers and gave me the machine to pay then he proceeded to face the other way and walk towards the kitchen.

She then asked if we would like white or whole wheat bread.  We chose white because why bother pretending to order something healthy at this point?  \\n\\nWe found seating outside in their covered back patio.  After a while, we had juicy burgers in front of us, so full of toppings that they had to be held together with, not toothpicks, but sturdy short skewers.  The fries were spicy and served hot, but to me they only tasted okay.  I tried the Willie Nelson; it was so good I basically inhaled my half.\\n\\nThen I switched over the the Chi Cheng.  One bite and I realized that it was in a league all by itself.   This was the One. Burger. That. Ruled. Them. All.  The chef has created an superb taste combination: ground beef stuffed with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions, teriyaki sauce, wasabinger spread, shredded lettuce, fried wonton strips all sandwiched between a toasted bun.  I loved the wasabi/ginger spread and wished he'd put twice the amount on.  Nonetheless,  it's the best burger I've ever eaten.  \\n\\nMy friend, amid cries of satisfaction, said she enjoyed her burgers immensely (but the fries... not so much).

Great fries and poutines at every location ive been to so far.\\n\\nOn this visit, as i approached the counter to order food, i was ignored for the first 30 or so seconds. maybe they were too busy to notice or they didn't see me. anyway, that day they only accepted cash for some reason. Luckily i had store credit on my NYF mobile app that worked. Thankfully it went through. i ordered The Works regular sized poutine.  Wait time was a tad slower than usual. I ordered poutine at other locations and it took 2-3 minutes with 2 people working. 3 people were working at this location and it took almost 5 minutes to get my order ready.  There was only one other person ordering fries at the time. (Maybe some of the staff were trainees.) \\n\\nOn a positive note, the staff were nice enough and even thanked me for my order.  I also like how every NYF location have a bunch of spices and sauces on the counter which you can put on top up your fries. (I wish every place that serves fries had these! Ketchup is just boring) So i put some random spices and a dab of chili sauce on my poutine. So good! The beef chilli underneath makes it a hearty meal which is great if you're very hungry. The blend of the sour cream, cheese sauce, green onions, and bacon bits are what makes it so unique and flavourful. Not too salty either. \\n\\nI also like that this NYF is located in Richmond center food court. Always nice, spacious seating booths, and very clean. More often than not,  when I shop at Richmond center I end up having a meal at the food court.

It's pretty unremarkable at first glance -- situated in a strip mall filled with chain restaurants --  but as soon as I sat at the bar I felt welcome. The bartender asked me my name and introduced herself as \\"Lindsey.\\" She promptly brought me a menu, and my drink order. I was there during happy hour, which promised $2.50 well drinks. I ordered a double rum 'n diet expecting it to be five bucks. I had previously been spending $12 to $15 at the two resort hotels I had been staying at for the same drink, so a fiver was a welcome. I found out later that Kitty's up-charged doubles by only $1.50 -- bonus! As I sipped my drink, I watched as Lindsey interacted with a slew of obvious regulars. Within a half an hour the regulars had introduced themselves to me and I had been assimilated into their group. Here I was, this big burley, bearded New England dude sharing shots and laughs with an amiable band of Floridians -- all of whom worked in the Orlando hospitality industry. We lingered until late and formed a trivia team for trivia night. We had a lot of laughs until I finally Ubered back to the hotel to crash. I returned the next night and was introduced to the owner who immediately bought me a drink and joked about Kitty's need for a bathroom attendant. In the last two days I sampled Kitty's nachos, wings, \\"beef on wek\\" and a simple bacon cheeseburger. The food came fast and was inexpensive. They are known for their wings and offer a lot of different variations and specials. I enjoyed the wings and found them meaty with just the right amount of heat I'd expect. The burger was a real surprise, though. It was hand formed, cooked just as I asked, and big. It was much better than the pricey burgers I had the previous week. Kitty offers bar food, but bar food they take pride in. Because they cater to a crowd of local regulars, they are upheld to certain standards by their clientele, and it shows. On my second night there, their regulars included several Disney cast members, timeshare sales sharks, and other guest service professionals. Thanks to the friends I made at Kitty's I was given some insight into the local hospitality culture, and I sincerely enjoyed it. As much as I'd love to keep Kitty's a secret, I need to give them props for making my vacation more than tolerable."},{"name":"Rock Sugar Thai Cafe","address":"38 Batterymarch St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I found chicken in my tofu dish.  \\n\\nThis irritates me more than anything.

This little bistro is across the street from the Seaport World Trade Center, away from the madness near the Pavilion on a Saturday night. There was no wait when I went, but a good amount of customers were there. I suggest getting an outdoor table to enjoy the beautiful breeze/scenery on a nice night. \\n\\nFor drinks, I ordered the Tamo Mai-Tai. It was meh. Very strong. It wasn't as creamy or fruity as others I've had and I like it creamy and fruity. My friend had some kind of alcoholic lemonade. She said it had a tint of coconut to it. It was definitely milder than mine, but I like it better and I don't even like lemonade. \\n\\nFor food, we shared a clam chowder and calamari. She then had the Tamo burger and I had the chicken and waffles as entrees. The clam chowder was is best part of our meal. Heck I'll even say it was some of the best I've ever had in Boston. It had little bacon crisps sprinkled on top along with the perfect amount of seasoning. The calamari was sadly a miss. Only about 2/3 of the dish had actual squid. The rest was fried dough, jalape√±os, and bell peppers. The first bite I had was a piece of airy puffy dough. So disappointed. The flavors were interesting though. Peppery and spicy with a side of sweet & sour dipping sauce. My chicken and waffles was also just ok. It was a tiny piece of fried chicken sandwiched between two equally as small waffles. A bit dry and bland, I dipped it in ketchup. My friend's TAMO burger looked huge and delicious though.\\n\\nShout out to the impeccable service and cute little condiment bottles.

It's smack-dab in the midst of a bunch of restaurants and a huge plaza. Pretty easy to access with plenty of parking. \\n\\nThe interior is nice with some soft music playing in the background. Unlike many places, the music isn't blasting which is great for studying or just hanging out with friends. There are plenty of table spaces to sit and study at or to just chill. The plugs are all close to the walls and so if you need access to that definitely sit close to the walls. There are about 3 long tables that seats about 10-12 people if you really had to that could be used for studying. An additional 3-4 small tables for two are to the side for others who prefer that. There are also a couple \\"couch\\" seats that are around a small table for people to chill at. A raised bench area provides additional seating as well. The only part I don't like is that it can be a bit dim in certain areas of the shop which could make it hard to study.\\n\\nThe drinks were pretty good.

Started browsing Yelp reviews to see what other customers ordered and was a bit disappointed bc some of the things that people raved about seemed far more interesting than the items on the menu today.  \\n\\nWith some suggestions from my server, I narrowed my choices down to the Crispy Pork Ribs, and the Fortune Cookie Waffle.\\n\\nMy expectations were pretty tempered at his point.  When my food arrived...the plating was beautiful.  I thoroughly enjoyed how visually striking the food was. The Crispy Pork Ribs were served in a cast iron skillet with cheesy grits, a soft boiled egg, avocado, and a hazelnut pesto.  I took a small spoonful of the grits by itself and already had a preconceived expectation for them.  I'm generally not a big fan of grits, I'll eat them but they just don't really do much for me.  Well...Hunnymilk totally changed that.  These grits were unlike any I've ever had and everything about them was so perfect, the creaminess, the mouth feel, the richness, the umami...everything was just mindblowingly good about them.  I probably ate 10 bites of the grits before I even touched the ribs.  Seriously...I couldn't picture grits being this good ever, and not only that, but that I had a foodgasm from them is insane.  The ribs were good, but not on the same level as the grits for me.  The pesto was fantastic as well and added a nice contrast to the grits.  Both the pesto and the grits were both very good individually...but the chef made a killer decision to pair these things and balance them in a way that didn't make the pesto overpowering or the grits too rich from liberal uses of cream or butter.  I looked at all of the tables including mine...and noticed that there were no condiments on the table.  It's kind of a bold statement to make IMO, and I instinctually have to mess with my breakfast whether its with S&P, or hot sauce, or some syrup or jam or whatever...but while eating this dish it was so well balanced, so well seasoned, that I didn't even pause to ask for condiments. \\n\\nThe fortune cookie waffle was lightly sweetened with a honey butter and vanilla marscarpone.  Some lightly sweetened wine jelly and blackberries and peaches topped the dish along with broken pieces of fortune cookies and I think what was a meringue.  I was amazed at how damn good this was...the marscapone and honey butter and the fortune cookie waffle complimented each other perfectly.  It had a nice balance of subtle sweetness, richness, soft/firm/crunchy.  I couldn't believe it but I had a foodgasm from this waffle dish as well despite being underwhelmed when I selected it.  I loved how all of the elements interacted with each other, but I will say that the meringue and the cookie crumbles were a bit distracting in terms of texture.  I was expecting a on of sweetness from all of the fruit and maybe a maple syrup but the sweetness was really toned back like asian desserts are which I really appreciated as well.\\n\\nMy favorite part of the meal was noticing a long hair embedded in my waffle early on in the meal.  I was deeply into my grits dish at the time and pointed it out to the staff and they made sure to get another one rushed out, so I wasn't really sitting all too long after finishing one the ribs.  Maybe 7 mins at the most.  When the bill came...the servers were deeply apologetic and took the waffle off my bill even without me needing to request it.  I told them they didn't have to do it as I appreciated they fixed the issue in a timely way and I understand things like this happen and I was just glad to have caught it early on before eating.  He mentioned that the staff were aware and insisted on it...and I thanked them.  Very rarely do you get treated with the respect, and empathy that I was treated with on this day...especially at a place that is in demand like Hunnymilk.  For this reason alone, I will remember this meal for years to come."},{"name":"The Local Pizzaiolo - Westside","address":"1000 Marietta St NW, Ste 202","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"First time coming here and it was such a great experience.

I live near Stoughton so I used to go to Su Su quite a bit for their AYCE sushi.  The quality of their sushi was slightly below par for this area, but I go for the convenience, and if it's not the best sushi place in town, it's not the worst either, so I went occasionally.\\nToday I went back for lunch for the first time in half a year, and to say that it was disappointing would be a gross understatement.  Their hot food menu had not changed much, so that was okay, I guess.  But you go to an AYCE sushi restaurant for the sushi, and I was aghast when I saw their sushi.  First of all, they had apparently gone to an all-brown-rice recipe for their sushi.  The spicy salmon maki that I ordered, as well as all the nigiri, all had brown rice.  Now, I know that some places offer brown rice, as a healthy alternative.  But those are ordered by choice.  Sushi is mostly about the quality and taste of the sushi rice.  So to get brown rice for my sushi without asking for it is like going to a steak house and being given a soy steak instead of one made of beef.  Is it more healthy? Sure.  BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I ORDERED! Then, I looked at my tuna nigiri and my salmon nigiri, and I couldn't quite believe my eyes. The tuna was not a bright red, but a dull, brownish red that cried \\"we're not fresh!!!\\"  The salmon was much worse.  In 25 years of eating sushi all over Eastern Mass., I had never seen salmon that was a dark, orangish brown.  Not in cheap AYCE Chinese restaurants, not in supermarkets, not in ANY restaurant of any kind had I seen salmon sushi that was so far past fresh that it looked toxic.  I am actually not that picky when it comes to sushi, and I love sushi in general, so even when it's not exactly toro fished off the pier that morning, usually I am okay with it.  This was horrible, horrible excuse for sushi. I don't know what happened to management that they decided to offer such ridiculously sub-par sushi to customers.  When sushi is old, you just have to throw it out.  It's part of having a sushi restaurant.  You CANNOT just try to sneak the brown salmon out to customers!!  People have eyes, and they can get sick! I can imagine that it won't be long before someone eats the wrong chunk of way-past-fresh fish and end up in the emergency room.\\n\\nI highly recommend that you take this restaurant off your list.  Unless you are from the health department.  Then I urge you to make a visit to this restaurant as soon as possible to save the public."},{"name":"Boxer Ramen","address":"2605 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is absolutely the best ramen house!

I ordered one lamb gyro and fries for myself and a falafel gyro for my girlfriend and it came to 16.50 (11.50 when factoring in the coupon). The lamb meat was seasoned decently and wasn't on the heavy or light side (average amount of meat). The pita was kind of spongy and had a different aftertaste them most, wasn't bad but wasn't great or anything either and the tzatziki was pretty good.. all flavors combined it was a overall average, or slightly above average gyro.. definitely didn't blow my mind like a Sultans Kitchen Doner and you surely can find a better gyro in portland without too much effort, but this was a decent one none the less.. My girls experience with her falafel gyro was similar, not bad but not amazing.. and the fries were just your average fries.. with that said 16.50 for this order is not good value, 7 dollars for a super gyro that was the same size as any 6 dollar gyro i've had is not a good value when comparing it to other places.

In reading the reviews, I noticed that if you mention that this place used to be a strip club, you get mentioned in the highlights for this restaurant. Now I would think that this establishment would get tired of being associated with a strip club. I'm told that for a long time when you went into this place, you could tell that is used to be a strip club.

Today I took my wife, daughter and grand daughter here.  My wife mentioned that she went here with friends a while ago and you really could tell that it use to be a strip club (6).   However, walking into today she said the place has been remodeled. I thought it looked great, and a bit different than any place else. \\n\\nAnother thing I learned from the Yelp reviews is that first generation Chinese people really like this place and their \\"authentic\\" offerings. That seems to be their niche.  However, they do have an \\"Americanized menu\\".   When it comes to food, I don't care that much about authentic, I just know what I like. I can't help but feel like the Americanized menu is an insult, but it has the stuff I like.   \\n\\nFrequently when I go to Chinese restaurants I start with the Americanized offerings such as General TSO to see if I like it and then branch out from there.   In many Chinese restaurants they have a notion that American's can't handle \\"spicy\\".   I laugh in their faces.  Most of what they offer as \\"spicy\\" wouldn't qualify as mild this this former and retired Wing King .  They did offer to make it \\"extra spicy\\"   I ordered that with Brown Rice.    My daughter ordered the Worsugi (sp).   I was in the mood for a Cola, and asked if they had Coke or Pepsi and was told both. This means it comes in a can and no refills. They do give you a glass and ice.  \\n\\nIn the end, the food was good, the restaurant nice with an interesting d√©cor.

I was quoted $89 for their \\"whole house special,\\" and given an appointment \\"window\\" between 1-4PM the next day.  The contractor showed up nearly TWO HOURS later than the latest time, nearing 6PM, with an over-sized Rug Doctor.  The machine was a small portable that had to be dragged up the stairs.  He also showed up in an unmarked car, with street clothes on; no uniform, whatsoever.  Immediate payment was requested, before work was even started, which I found very unusual, but I was assured by the contractor that there was a money-back satisfaction guarantee, should the work be sub-par.  My credit card information was also taken over the phone. This should have been my first clue something was not correct.  I was also charged additional money for my hallways, as I was informed that they were \\"unusually large,\\" as well as being charged nearly 50% of the ENTIRE bill for 15 stairs.\\n\\nAs the man showed up so late, I was forced to leave a roommate at home to appraise the final work, as I was going to miss an important appointment.  About an hour after arriving, my roommate called to inform me that the man was already done, and wanted a signature on a \\"contract\\" that said I was happy with the work, and also included a hysterical clause at the bottom of the contract which basically states that if you sign the paper, you're not allowed to leave ANY sort of negative review or comment ANYWHERE online, or verbally about poor work done by this company.  When I asked my roommate about the quality of work, he stated that they basically sprayed the carpets with cold water, and left them wet and as dirty as when they arrived.  I instructed him NOT to sign anything.\\n\\nWhen I returned home, the carpets were INDEED wet AND dirty.  There was absolutely NO improvement in the carpets condition, AT ALL.  Keep in mind I have NO pets, and the carpet is vacuumed, with a Dyson, 4-5 times a week, and professionally steam-cleaned at least 3 times per year.\\n\\nI immediately left a message for them to call me in the morning.  An hour after myself and my roommates went to sleep, the doorbell began going crazy, and there was a succession of loud pounding on the door.

I was told that they could only help me if I paid the extra money for \\"deep cleaning,\\" and that the service I had paid for was only a \\"light, maintenance cleaning.\\"  After nearly an hour of back and forth, Cindy FINALLY let me know that the SAME contractor, using the SAME, crappy equipment, could do the SAME crappy level of cleaning that he had done previously.  Cindy, the managers, and the contractor talked in circles for nearing another hour, before I finally had to kick the contractor out of my house and hang up on her.

Jade Sushi, located in College Park on Edgewater, fits in that tier, so I was excited to go check it out the other night as part of the Yelp Restaurant Week.\\n\\nI arrived with my group of about 10 people around 7pm. Parking in this area isn't great, but there is a parking lot behind the shopping center that did have some spots. The venue itself is rather clean and nice, including some outside seating if you want to bring your dog. When you make a reservation, they write your name on a cute little mini chalkboard that goes on your table, so that's fun.\\n\\nWe sat down at the table and proceeded to look over the menu. Jade has a rather extensive menu (front and back) with sushi, ramen and other appetizers and entrees. I decided to put in an order for the Hamachi Truffle to start (based on tips from various Yelpers) and a Rainbow Roll and Wow Bao as a main course. The prices for everything were pretty reasonable (range from $10-$20 for most things). \\n\\nWhile it took a while for everything to come out and eventually get our checks (slow service was the one negative part of the experience, but we expected that coming in based on other reviews), the food itself was pretty good. The Hamachi Truffle was very solid with good flavors and a great \\"melt in your mouth\\" texture. The Rainbow Roll was a solid sushi dish, with tasty coconut shrimp and avocado topped with a good complimentary eel sauce. The Wow Bao was fairly good with a good pork belly and good sauce (although I'd recommend getting it without the cucumber that was added for crunch because it doesn't work with the dish). \\n\\nOverall, Jade Sushi is a solid sushi spot with a nice venue and good food for a good price. While it wasn't perfect, it made for a very pleasant and satisfying sushi experience."},{"name":"New Golden Gate","address":"66 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Near the gate of Chinatown, easy to find.

The spicy clams came with like 20 clams smothered in a spicy cherry tomato sauce. They are spicy if you can't handle heat but I kept rating and cooled my mouth with water and two bottles of Italian wine. My main course was the stuffed center cut pork chop. It was salty from the prosciutto and mozzarella but savory with whatever tomato based sauce it was covered in. The root vegetables underneath the behemoth of a meal was very tender but didn't dissolve when you bit into it. The waitresses did a great job of bringing all our meals on such a small table but cleared it as fast as they could.

Those of you who read my reviews are surely thinking:  why does he write this stuff?  Nobody cares!  Yet the three of you continue to read.  I have each Friday off from work and that means a few things.  It means I can play poker darts on Thursday night.  It means I can get a head start on my weekend chores.  Most importantly, it means I can go out to breakfast on Friday morning.  Typically, I'll head to IHOP in Revere.  While the food at IHOP is one of the few joys I have in life, the total dining experience leaves much to be desired.  If I wanted to watch kids climb, color, and cry, I'd go into work.  My IHOP Revere experience is usually tainted by frequent glances from young, sad eyes that I suspect are thinking: are you my daddy?  I headed to IHOP again this morning but along the way, I accidently but thankfully discovered Frank's Suffolk Diner.  Frank's is located just north of Suffolk Downs on the long driveway to Target, Wendys, and my favorite store, The Dollar Tree.  Trying new places is usually a decision I immediately regret, but not today.  Frank's Suffolk Diner is everything you could want from a diner.  The service is stellar, the environment is well light and clean, and the menu is unique and full of variety.  The omelet I ordered was huge and cooked to perfection.  The owner of Franks also waits on tables and intelligently yet lightly converses with the patrons.  She is knowledgeable and proud of the food she serves but more importantly, makes the customers feel welcome.  She cares deeply about her business and it shows.  Coffee refills are free and mine was never in danger of being empty because she was always there to fill my cup.  I really can't say enough positive things about Frank's Suffolk Diner.  I rarely tip over 18% but the owner/waitress at Franks deserved it.  Great customer service and quality food that's priced at an affordable value are rare, but you can find it at Franks.

I think it was especially difficult for us to find the restaurant because we are not from Boulder. \\n\\nThe first thing you will notice about the restaurant is the strong smell of spices when you walk through the doors! Personally, I loved the smell that the whole restaurant emitted. The spices in the air just makes you more and more hungry. \\n\\nMy friends and I went in a group of about 12 people. The staff were very accommodating and kind. They situated us in a very timely manner. And they served us all very quickly. \\n\\nThe food was excellent in my opinion. I am very open to trying new food and I can definitely say that trying Ethiopian food was definitely worth the gamble. We ordered from the large group menus. Our meal came with large family style portions of various meats and vegetables. It was also an interesting experience to eat with our hands. I have never really eaten with my hands before, but it was an enjoyable experience. The food and spices were delicious! I also enjoyed the hot tea! \\n\\nThe waitstaff were very good to our group. They filled our water and tea accordingly. Prior to coming on this day, none of our group had ever been to a restaurant like this. So, the staff explained how to eat with the sponge-type bread.

It was a great experience! \\n\\n The only downside is that the large group meal does cost about $23 after tip and taxes. So, it is a hefty price to pay for a college student.

I'd suggest putting up a more detailed menu somewhere, but having dealt with people in various situations has proven that some people can somehow miss all the details right in front of them. So yeah, don't expect customers to pay attention or read. Instead, at this point, the manager should have stepped in and opened up the other register to keep the growing line moving along. \\n\\nThere were plenty of staff available. I mean, this isn't a sit-down restaurant where the staff come by your table every 5-10 minutes or so to ask you if you need anything. The staff just brings your food and drinks to your table. That's it. There really shouldn't be any excuse for having one cashier at a time.  \\n\\nThe other thing is, for a place that claims to also serve dinner, you'd think they'd be a little more prepared. My friend and I were there around 8pm and only two of the teishoku sets were available. I took that as a sign of either (a) they lack staff in the kitchen so they can only prepare two teishoku sets or (b) they haven't figured out how much they should be ordering from their suppliers so they ran out of ingredients. \\n\\nShortcomings aside, the drinks and pastries were decent. The souffl√© cheesecake was airy and moist. It reminded me of the Japanese term \\"fuwa fuwa\\". The matcha roll cake was good but slightly lacking in matcha flavor. At least it wasn't overly sweet. Same goes for the matcha latte. It's not earthshattering good but it satisfies the craving.  \\n\\nI'd like to return and try the other pastries and drinks.

Too bad the experienced was ruined by the manager.\\nSo I went in to grab some chili and a sandwich to go then to go home and nurse a terrible cold.\\nI asked the bartender if they had a chili/half sandwich combo or something like that since I wasn't extremely hungry. She said yes we do, explained what it was and I was pleased.

Nope.\\nHere comes the manager to make sure he puts his 2 cents in. He said the same thing she did, but I'm a real annoying, condescending tone and like it was a big deal. Then went on to explain that \\"the idea is to draw people into the restaurant to sit and eat and maybe enjoy a beer or two while they're here. It's a marketing ploy\\"\\nThat was really what pissed me off. I ordered a $12 scotch while I was waiting. Which is likely more than a couple of beers, I already understood her explanation and didn't need to hear it from him.\\nI told him I'm well aware of marketing ploys and I'm sure he noted my irritated demeanor.

Learn not to piss off people that are ordering food and expensive drinks at your restaurant.

Moreover there was also a menu \\"but it was still in the works\\" with no mention of draft beers.  This was semi perplexing because the website clearly states that The Garden at Community Smith is \\"a modern bar and grill, The Garden serves small-plates and casual outtakes from the Community Smith menu, plus local and craft beers on draught.\\"  Moving on the bartender used his creativity to put forth two cocktails that were extremely solid, until I saw the $25 dollar check.

Our bartender, Stacey, was friendly, professional and creative beyond what you would normally find behind a bar. His skill with concocting unique drinks tailored to your taste was as artisan as the funky wall hangings. A good representation of this magic craft is the Moscow Mule-esque drink borne from a dissatisfaction with the sweetness of Ginger Ale and the lack of a well-balanced ginger beer that could satisfy Stacey's particular demand for perfection. Instead, he found heaven in a glass of muddled fresh ginger, a splash of lime and a generous pour of vodka topped off with ice.

Then God said, \\"Let the earth bring forth vegetation: every kind of plant that bears seed and every kind of fruit tree on earth that bears fruit with its seed in it.\\" And so it happened.\\n\\nThen God helped Eric Silverstein create The Peached Tortilla, and God had to take more than the Sabbath Day off because it was so fucking delicious.\\n\\nWhether you believe in God or not, believe in The Peached Tortilla.  Good eats, good employees...  So glad I found this place!\\n\\nI follow them on Twitter, so I always know where they're gonna be.  I had asked the day before where they would be for lunch the following day.  When they tweeted back to me that they'd be in the Arboretum from noon until 2pm, I was all over it, intending to get there by noon.  Then, around 11:40, I got a tweet telling me, specifically, they were running late, but that they'd be at the Arboretum by 12:45.  That's class, folks.  Had he not tweeted that to me, I would have been there by noon wondering where on God's green earth they were.  Since the owner tweeted a warning to me, I knew not to show up until 12:45.  And the owner even knew who I was, based on my Twitter profile, when I showed up there!\\n\\nGot a Bbq brisket tortilla (brisket, jalepeno slaw, and smoky roasted peach bbq sauce), and some Belgian fries with bacon Ranch dipping sauce.  Why is it that *I* can never think of putting bacon and Ranch together?  Seems like a natch, but I'm no culinary prodigy.  Thankfully for people like me, there ARE culinary prodigies who put these things together.\\n\\nIt wasn't the best brisket I've ever eaten, but it was still quite good, and the peach bbq sauce made my mouth beg for more, as did the bacon Ranch.  I couldn't eat all the fries, and that made me depressed for a few minutes.  But I felt better once it occurred to me that I could simply go back again and get more food some other day.\\n\\nI now stalk Peached Tortilla.  When they're at the Arboretum, I'm there.  When they're at the Domain, I'm there.  They should come by my house, as I'm usually there, too.  I buy a taco and a drink, and I slink away to hide and eat, carefully watching their activities, like a vice cop stalking a man propositioning a prostitute.\\n\\nOkay, no, I don't stalk Peached Tortilla.  I've actually only been the one time.  But I plan to go back several more times to try a cornucopia of items.  I love the word \\"cornucopia\\".  I had a cornucopia of positive emotions when I tried out Peached Tortilla's food.  And they had a cornucopia of customers at their trailer.

We both ordered the blank + blank, which means you can order a soup or salad with something else. We both opted to select a soup with a salad. I ordered the winery salad (candied pecans, dried cherries, and crumbled blue cheese atop mixed greens with a balsamic vinaigrette) with the tomato basil soup. My mom also ordered the winery salad but with the French onion soup. Both soups were fantastic and flavorful. The salad was delicious as well, but had too much dressing to the point that I could barely finish it. Next time, I will order the dressing on the side. The waiter was okay...he didn't seem genuinely friendly but was at least quick to take our orders and bring the check.\\n\\nThe second time I came, I decided to check out the happy hour with my husband and some coworkers. Happy hour runs from 3-6pm Sun-Wed and 11-5pm Sat. You can get $5 house wines and well liquor drinks, $1 off their draft list, and discounted select items from the menu. We ordered the pepperoni flatbread (1/2 size for happy hour) and the half hummus trio. I thought both of these items were tasty, but not blow-my-mind delicious. I would definitely want to come back to try the meatball and the Juliette flatbread (brie, pear, garlic, caramelized onion, and parmesan).\\n\\nThere's parking in the back, which is convenient. However, if you come after 4:30 pm, the lot may be filled up completely. They do take reservations so I'd recommend doing this if you have a larger party, as the place gets pretty busy. If you're looking for an intimate atmosphere, this may not be the best place since it was loud enough that it was hard to hear even the person sitting next to you as they spoke. Overall, I love the atmosphere, as the walls are filled with many varieties of wines that you can purchase to go or to drink in house (no corkage fees on Mondays and Tuesdays!).

It's just the overall waiting experience + quality of food gives la Barbecue the upper hand. Read below to learn why you should choose to go here over Franklin...\\n\\nTHE WAIT\\nI got there 15 min. before it opens and waited for a total of 1.5 hours -- not bad compared to the 5 hours I waited at Franklin. The best part about waiting at la Barbecue is the live music and FREE beer! You can't beat free beer -- you just can't, even if its lone star. \\n\\nTHE PROTEIN\\nBrisket: While I can't accurately compare Franklin's brisket to la Barbecue's, I will say that la Barbecue's brisket does NOT disappoint. The two are very comparable. While la Barbecue doesn't give you the option of choosing lean or fat meat, they give you a good mix. Both of the lean and fat pieces were juicy, tender and melted in your mouth like buttery heaven.\\n\\nBeef Ribs: We got so lucky, because we were the last people in line to get the famous beef ribs!! So if you want to try this bad boy make sure to get here early. The beef ribs are a game changer and were hands down my favorite. I don't even know where to begin or how to describe its amazingness. Just know that this is a must and if you're a meat lover, you'll leave more than satisfied. \\n\\nSausage: I do not recommend the sausage. It reminds me of a dry chorizo. Bleh.\\n\\nShredded pork: Not the main highlight, but still juicy and tasty. Goes great with the barbecue sauce they have!\\n\\nTHE SIDES\\nThe sides at la Barbecue are hands down way better than Franklin's sides. The chipotle cole slaw and the potato salad are delicious and go well with the meat. While sides are not the most important part of a BBQ experience, they still are important. So don't forget to get some sides while you are here!!"},{"name":"Sushi A-Go-Go","address":"801 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Hand made rolls when you order them, whats not to like?

Finally, when everyone arrived we enjoyed each other company while we dined, sipped spirits, and laughed over any topic that came to a drink mind. For starter I had both east and west oysters which I could went without, a bone in rib chop steak with lobster atop, baked potato, and mushrooms. Everything seemed to be running smoothly until the checked arrived and the waiter mentioned they don't split checks and that's when I got annoyed because he could've mentioned that from the beginning when he asked for the occasion. So now we have to let the dissecting game begin. After that task which brought my tipsy meter down a couple notched decided to stay and go to the rooftop bar because I needed about 5 drinks to put me back in the game.

If you like bourbon, you will pee your pants over their selection.  Hubby tried, I think, 5 different kinds, some straight up, some in Old Fashioneds.  He was in heaven.\\n\\nWould you, reader, look down on me if I told you I sampled alot here?  No, of course not.  This is Yelp and it's what we do.  We \\"recon-order\\".  \\n\\nWith that in mind, I had the Spicy Mexican Martini, which ended up being my fave with it's healthy dose of Cazadores and Paula's Orange kicked up a bit (BAM!) by the chile powder and sugared rim.  Also tried the Pop-Rock tini.  Had to.  Pop rocks on the rim that sizzled and popped with every sip, leaving a very pleasing vibration on the tongue.  The 'tini was too fruity and sweet for me, but the pop rocks were fun.  Then I moved off menu and asked our super nice (and super cute!) bartender, Shane,  if he could make me something with my new alcohol obsession, St Germain.  He produced a tasty concoction that had some fresh-slapped mint on top (mint likes a good slapping to put out more...aroma).\\n\\nNever fear, we did not consume a vast amount of liquor without some belly waddin for absorption.  Ten Oak has a decent food menu with some intriguing versions of bar food.  We tried the mussels, which instead of being served in a wine sauce, they came swimming in a bourbon sauce.  While tasty, they were tiny and sparse (about 12? for $10) and beware the numerous chunks of fresh garlic in the broth.  I got a mouthful and was crying (literally) for water.  \\n\\nWe were disappointed with the pulled pork nachos as they were just a mountain of chips with dry shredded pork atop.  You had to hunt for some with the promised cheese and peppers.  The \\"frites\\", I thought, were very good and atypical in that they were more like mini steak fries, cut from fingerling potatos.  These too had alot of garlic with them.  A vampire would not be caught dead in here!  Our fave food was the triple mac n cheese with tangy goat cheese and bacon.  So creamy, so savory, soooo fattening and so good!  Want to check out the little pizzas next time.\\n\\nAlso, I loved the decor!  Nice brick and wood finishing and fantastic artwork in the sensual, surreal vein of Michael Parks.  You would not even know it used to be Cuba Libra.  They've even got some tables outside on the sidewalk.  Also while we were there, they had an all girl Guns and Roses band playing in the back.  And while that was hot and all, for a minute, their noise overpowered the music at the bar (an eclectic mix of jazz and roots, i.e. Man of Constant Sorrow).

Family style is the way to go baby! Anyways, the items on the menu  looked bomb in writing and I was so excited to try everything. However, almost every single item just missed the mark for me. Here are the dishes we've tried:\\n- Duck Fat Fries: I was so excited for this since I am a french fry connoisseur and I loove duck. And the fact that it is triple fried?? :O However, it was kind of cold by the time it got to us and it wasn't thatt amazing. Maybe if it were super fresh when we had it I would've liked it better :/\\n- Chicken Liver Mousse: This comes in a jar with a side of bread and pickled red onions. The pickled red onions pairs well with the flavors but the bread they serve could be better. It was good but not outstanding.\\n- Crispy Brussel Sprout Leaves: I guess I should've been better with my reading comprehension but these are literally only the leaves of the brussel sprouts deep fried. I was hoping for a little more veggies since I haven't had much on my entire trip to Austin so far. The flavor profile of this dish is on the sweet side due to the raisins, which some of my friends loved. I didn't find it as appealing as they did though.\\n- Crispy Chicken Thighs: comes with fried smashed potatoes on the bottom (which were my favorite part of this dish actually), drizzled with gravy. The chicken was tender but it was very salty on the skin. It's not a dish I would order again.\\n- Candied Pork Belly: comes with collard greens that has a tang to it. Didn't taste much of the \\"candied\\" part. The pork was tender but just really didn't stand out as a dish.\\n- Slow Cooked Beef Shoulder: comes with mashed potatoes and mixed root veggies. Pretty much like your ordinary pot roast. Again, the flavors didn't really stand out to me and the beef was a little overcooked."},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"In the middle of Rainey Street lies my shattered expectations for El Naranjo.  \\n\\nNever made it here during the trailer period, but I have to say the building is a nice step in the evolution.  So, given the afternoon temp pushing 100, by dinner time sitting outside wasn't appealing when the a/c beckoned.  Nice wood floors and high ceilings, eight to ten table dining rooms.  Took a seat, and within ten minutes thought my head was going to explode from the incredible noise level.  Nothing to dampen the sound amplifies the loudness, which leads to more volume as everyone tries to talk louder to be heard.  Vicious cycle that they have to fix.\\n\\nOK, on to the food.  Ordered the chayote salad, and the special mole rosa with seared duck breast.  Brought the rolls and a house butter.  The rolls were as hard as a rock - maybe supposed to be that way?  The chayote salad was indescribably good.  Sliced chayote squash, crumbled queso, pickled red onion and the ingredient that made it - a marvelous fruity olive oil.  Perfection.\\n\\nBy now, the noise is getting painful, so I move outside.  Entree arrives.  First taste is great - nice green rice with the cilantro flavor subtly hidden, nice light tomato flavor to the mole, and the crispy skin of the duck breast.  By bite three, though, I am overwhelmed by a heavy hand on the salt shaker.  Rice, mole, or duck?  Tasting each, I narrowed it down to the duck skin.  It was easy to avoid, but being deprived of the wonderful goodness of crisp duck skin was a downer.\\n\\nSo, a couple of negatives - one positive.  But a huge one quickly became apparent - from the time my food arrived until they asked if I wanted dessert, I was invisible.  No \\"how's your food\\", no \\" everything OK\\" - crickets.  Head front of the house person comes out - stops at every table on the deck.  Gets to me, spins on his heels and goes inside.  Several have questioned the price point of the entrees - I'm OK with the $20+ entrees, but not with the Shady Grove/Magnolia Cafe service.  These prices are bumping up against fine dining, and the service isn't there.\\n\\nSo, don't see any need to darken El Naranjo's door anytime soon.

I don't know why it took them so long to verify the change of address, but the information is accurate now.  I've moved my review and pictures to this listing since it's the location I originally reviewed.  I've also added some updates to my review since I've been back to the restaurant and have tried additional menu items.\\n\\nA great thing about Bon Ga is it's open late: Monday through Saturday from 7am to 2am.  They're closed Sundays.\\n\\nI like this place and think it easily stands up to the more popular casual Korean restaurants on Buford Highway, such as So Kong Dong and Cho Dang Tofu House.  Compared to the other places, Bon Ga is newer, nicer, cleaner, and feels more modern.\\n\\nService is fantastic.  The restaurant is easily able to accommodate large groups.  Food comes out in a timely fashion.  The middle-aged Korean lady servers are friendly and attentive, which isn't always the case at Korean restaurants.\\n\\nThe menu is simple and the prices are affordable.  There are six soups/stews priced between $7.55 and $11.99.  These soups/stews are their specialties.  They have $7.55 bibimbap (Korean mixed rice), which is a steal.  They also have standard Korean BBQ items such as galbi (short ribs), daeji bulgogi (spicy BBQ pork), regular bulgogi (BBQ beef), and other items like the seafood pancake.  BBQ is in the $14-15 range.  I've tried the following:\\n\\nSoondae - Korean blood sausage\\nSoondaeguk -  pork soup mixed with sliced soondae (blood sausage)\\nSulung Tang - rich beef bone broth with sliced beef and noodles\\nDogani Tang - beef tendon soup\\nDdukguk - Korean rice cake and beef bone soup\\nSoondae Juhpshi - Korean-style pork sausage with rice noodles\\n\\nSoondae is made out of pig intestines which are stuffed with cellophane noodles, barley, and congealed pork blood.  It's savory and delicious.  One glistening order is good enough to share as an appetizer among a small group.  It comes with salt and chili pepper flake seasoning and shrimp paste on the side.  I think the sausage tastes just fine by itself.  Its consistency is softer and more \\"tendony\\" than the typical pork sausage.\\n\\nYou can also have the sausage in soup form (Soondaeguk), which is one of many tasty soups here.  The blood sausage soup comes with other pork parts including meat and tendon on the bone.  If you're looking for a hearty soup, I suggest the Soondaeguk.  Another place that makes good Soondae is Cafe Todahmgol in Duluth.\\n\\nThe Sulung Tang is one of the restaurant's most popular dishes.  This is a simple soup.  Bon Ga's version consists of a milky white broth with slices of beef and thin, slippery (presumably rice) noodles.  Sulung Tang is served bland.  You season the broth yourself with the provided sea salt and scallions at the table.  You can also add black pepper and whatever else you'd like, such as the banchan (Korean sides).  This is traditional Korean comfort food and I think people who are not used to it could get thrown off by the lack of flavor.\\n\\nThe Dogani Tang and Ddukguk are more flavorful.  The Dogani Tang comes with a lot of beef tendon in bite-sized chunks.  From what I was told, this is a very traditional Korean soup.  The Ddukguk is one of my favorite soups here.  It's quite flavorful on its own (no additional seasoning required) and it comes loaded with several ingredients including seaweed, egg, and appetizingly chewy Korean rice cake.\\n\\nBanchan (Korean side dishes) can include dishes such as spicy and pickled greens (watercress?), cucumber, radishes, and kimchi.  Compared to other Korean restaurants, the banchan selection is not very good here.  What is served is fresh and sufficient.  This is value Korean dining after all.\\n\\nReceipts print out in both English and Korean and are organized/itemized well.  It's very clear and easy to read.\\n\\nIn the end, I'm a fan of Bon Ga thanks to their tasty and authentic food, inexpensive pricing, clean and casual atmosphere, and friendly and attentive service.  It's a place I'll keep coming back to."},{"name":"Midwest Grill Brazilian BBQ","address":"1124 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"The Midwest Grill is definitely not what I expected.

Slightly salty but given that they looked paler in color than the Singapore noodles I'm used to, I thought they would be bland. Glad they weren't.

Their prices are not great but not ridiculous either; the food however is flavorful if you order the right things.  Problem is, the menu is 60-70% in Chinese and the English translations suck...for instance, a fish dish may not specify that the fish is battered and fried (argh!!! the bane of Americanized Chinese food).\\n\\nOur dining companions were unlucky; we on the other hand struck gold with the \\"salt and pepper squid\\" which was the best fried calimari I've had in ANY restaurant, Asian or American or Italian.  The \\"sauteed vegetables\\" turned out to be sauteed Chinese broccoli, which were quite good, and the \\"roasted duck\\" was among the best I've had in any Chinese restaurant including ones in NYC, Philly, and DC.  Their \\"sweet and sour soup\\" was also very good, had a real kick to it rather than the bland boring kind usually designed for timid Western palates.  \\n\\nWe ate around 8pm on a weekday and the place was only about 1/4 full but the clientele were predominantly Asian, which is always a good sign.  Didn't realize that they're open until 4am, though to be honest I would imagine the wee hours probably involve a fair number of drunken jerks into whose food the wait staff would be well justified in spitting or depositing other bodily fluids, lol."},{"name":"Louie's Grill","address":"4453 Cemetery Rd","city":"Hilliard","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I get into arguments over whether to go to Louie's or Starliner Diner, but Louie's wins more often mostly based on convenience.

We definitely seemed to arrive during the lunch rush, but they worked quickly to clean tables and get us seated promptly.  The menu had a lot of variety, and I was pleased with to find my go-to dish, Pad Woonsen, on the lunch specials. \\n\\nThe special came with a salad, a spring roll, and the entree.  The salad and spring roll came out quickly - no complaints on the roll, it was crispy and flavorful.  The salad was fine, nothing to write home about.  I requested peanut dressing on the side, and it was an adequate dressing.  Nothing wrong with it, per se, I've just had much better.\\n\\nThere were three of us in our dining party, and after the initial salad starter, one member of our party got their entree while the others waited at least 15 minutes for ours to arrive.  As I was eating my dish, I made a comment that it was a good thing I liked garlic, as this dish was especially strong.  I didn't hate it, it tasted good, but I've never had a Pad Woonsen quite so savory.  \\n\\nMy husband had ordered something that he's never had before, Yum Woonsen, and he offered me a bite.  It was at that moment that we realized that we had the wrong entrees. Apparently Yum Woonsen is also clear noodle based and has more of a garlic lime flavor where as Pad Woonsen is sweeter.  Mystery solved.  At that point, we were so far into our dishes that it wasn't worth saying anything or swapping. . .but it was a little disappointing that we were given the wrong items.\\n\\nAfter we finished our meals, we waited a LONG time before receiving our check.  We kept trying to make eye contact, but it wasn't until a cell phone from our table went off that we were finally able to get the attention of our waiter.  Also worth noting, we never once received water refills. . .my glass had been empty since just after the entrees arrived.\\n\\nOverall, I did not hate it here. . .I've definitely had worse Thai, but I think there are better options nearby."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Orderd the Spicy Miso Ramen w/sweet corn and fried garlic chips.

For me to compose a review is simply because I either had a fantastic experience or the total opposite. \\n\\nUs and our friend's family went to brunch last Sunday at Pancake Social. \\n\\nLet's start with the pros:\\n1. My Dutch Baby pancake was good. THAT IS IT.\\n\\nNow the cons:\\n1. My pancake was brought out WAY after everyone else's food had came out. Fine, I brushed it off, wasn't a biggie. \\n2. Our friends ordered some fried eggs for their son and it was not served until about 25 minutes after it was ordered. By that time, we were all finished with our food and paid the bill. Then we found out we were charged for it.\\n3. The waiter also did not ask if we wanted to split the bill, so we asked him to split it amongst the families accordingly. It was done incorrectly. It usually isn't a big deal for me but there were just so many mess ups that it started to compound. \\n4. This is what really irked me. The Dutch Baby pancake was served in a skillet that which was EXTREMELY hot, and I wasn't not informed by our waiter. On top of it, he placed it right in front of my 1yr old who was in a high chair!!! I don't know if you have a 1yr old boy or been around one, but man, are they wiggly and ready/willing to touch and grab ANYTHING that's within their reach.  \\n\\nSo the waiter sat down the skillet and walked off. He failed to mention the temperature of the skillet, and as I begin to quickly move it away from my son (because he was ready to grab it), my index finger barely grazed the skillet and was burned. Just to clarify, I did not grab the skillet, I only moved the plate that it was on and my finger barely touched  the skillet's handle. I immediately felt the sting and it started to swell. That's how hot the damn thing was. \\n \\nI've been to restaurants where foods were served in skillets that were not hot. Whenever the skillet is hot, the waiter would always inform us of the temperature. That was not the case this time.\\n\\nHonestly I'm just happy that it was my finger and not my son's hand. What if I decided to grab the handle instead? My entire hand would've been burnt!!!!!\\n\\nAfter the incident, not once did the manager come by and ask how my hand was and offer any type of comfort or apologize. I guess the waiter thought it wasn't that big of a deal and didn't need to mention it to the manager or the manager knew about it and didn't feel the need stop by, not sure what the case was.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the good food was trumped by a (literally) painful and awful experience. Not cool. \\n\\nIt has been almost a week and my finger is still in severe pain."},{"name":"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen","address":"875 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"On the way to Disney, we decided to stop and eat before we hit the park...

The food is a tad pricey for what it is and you're paying a premium just because you're in the city. The burgers are good, but you'll find better burger joints in the surrounding suburbs especially over in Gresham, the fries were good, but again nothing too amazing. The area where Tilt really shines and what they're known for are their pie shakes. Tilt has a selection of pies that you can choose from, they'll take a full slice of pie, add milk and ice cream and blend it up into a shake. The result of texture and taste varies from pie to pie but is delicious every time. The problem with the pie shakes is the pricing. I get that they have a whole slice of pie in them, but $8 for what would be considered a small or medium shake at most ice cream parlors is extremely steep. It's a cool idea and tastes great, but it's one of those novelty food items that you may stop in to try just once or twice.

I was confident, perhaps even a bit cocky that they'd be blown away by La Barbecue and have to declare it the winner as the best BBQ brisket in Austin. None such thing happened.\\n\\nThis was only my second time here. My first visit was almost exactly a year prior and it was remarkable or should I say, their brisket was remarkable. As I mentioned in my previous review, out of 5 things I ordered last time, I only liked the brisket. Not only did I like it, but it was what brisket dreams are made of. The biggest challenge I find with brisket is ensuring the entire amount served is a combination of juicy and flavorful. Minus my visit last year, brisket is too often a tad dry. I should note I always order moist/fatty brisket. The brisket I had here a year ago defied all brisket I'd ever had. It had the perfect balance of smokey, salty, peppery with just a subtle hint of tang. And not any single part of it was dry, at all. Unfortunately the same could not be said for the brisket yesterday. Upon the sampling they gave out before we ordered, my friend declared that she liked it a lot, but that Franklin's was better. It tasted good, but did not induce a feeling of euphoria the previous visit did. We got our brisket, sat down and started digging in. Some bites were really good, but far too many were dry and I actually needed to use bbq sauce to help it go down. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Inconsistency stinks and for all I know, this visit was an anomaly. Unfortunately, it's a hard one to ignore. The brisket seemed ordinary to me.\\n\\nI genuinely feel bad about giving them two stars. They are really nice here, but the definition of a 2 star review is \\"Meh. I've experienced better.\\" and well, I have. Ironically, the better I've experienced was the same place. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I hold them responsible for setting them that high to begin with."},{"name":"Louie's Grill","address":"4453 Cemetery Rd","city":"Hilliard","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a great place, and I think a lot of people don't know about it.

We arrived at noon and the lined reached to the back of the store and before we left was even doubled back almost all the way back to the front. However, the kitchen was working hard and we only waited less than 5 minutes to order and another 5 minutes for our food.

They have quite the selection of meats, ranging from basic chicken and beef to lamb, beef tongue and more. The salsa bar is amazing, after your order is ready, just take your plate on over and grab a pepper, salsa, etc. This salsa bar really takes taco la villa to the next level.\\n\\nThe tacos are small and tasty, much more authentic than your average taco in Atlanta, with corn tortilla. The meats and generally very good. It is cool that they offer specialty meats like beef tongue, but since they don't sell a lot of those, they maybe aren't as good as the more traditional meats.\\nGreat value and tasty tacos which are truly authentic.

I can't compare lunch to dinner portion sizes quite yet, but we are already a little afraid of the prices we might encounter for dinner. Thai Bloom will have a super hard time competing with Thai Kitchen's all you can eat lunch buffet just 4 blocks north on Cedar Hills. That buffet is only 8.95 and is the best on the west side.
