My husband and I went for dinner on Saturday night, and the host was amazing and got us a table without reservations right away. When we were seated by another staff member- maybe an expediter or bus boy?, We were shoved in the back of the restaurant behind a giant party of people. We squeezed our way to our seats and were told our server would be right with us. Our server approached the table asking for our drink orders. My husband ordered a glass of wine, and I ordered champagne. We were not offered water (which has been offered in the past) nor did our server inform us of the specials. After 10 minutes, my husband received his wine, and I was told my drink would be right out. About 15 minutes later, my drink arrived (warm!). We asked for water, and the server took our order. My husband had a question about the size of the oysters. The server wasn't sure and clearly didn't know how to answer our questions about the menu.  I ordered the salmon, and my husband ordered the chowder and half a dozen oysters. Our server suddenly remembered to tell us the soup of the day, which was lobster bisque, after we had already placed our order. We received some bread and the oysters came out right away. Our entrees took about another 25 minutes to arrive. The salmon dish was piping hot, but the food was not. My husband's chowder was OK- piping hot bowl - the soup was lukewarm.  My salmon tasted ok but had bones every few bites. This is NOT acceptable for the prices they are charging us. We finished our food, and the server was overwhelmed and unavailable. My husband flagged her down for the bill. She didn't offer us dessert or anything else. When she brought the bill, we gave her the credit card to pay, and she lingered next to our table waiting for another table to order an entree because they were out of scallops. She stood there for another 5 minutes waiting for the guy next to us to decide on his next entree. Finally, the server brought our bill, laid it down next to my husband, and turned her back on us. We both said, \\"Thank you, have a great night\\", and she didn't respond. This was the worst experience I've had in a restaurant which overcharges for food that lacks flavor and is under par - especially French cuisine.

Top it off with a killer dinner service, featuring a heavily seasonal and local menu that changes DAILY, and it really becomes a contender for one of the best restaurants PERIOD in this area. \\n\\nI've been to Scratch many, many times and I've never been disappointed. Not once. \\n\\nAtmosphere: 5 stars\\nEclectic, quaint, and cozy; just the perfect smorgasboard of unique garage-sale-esque finds creatively and purposefully sprinkled throughout the classy yet hip interior. One word of caution: there's only a handful of tables, so get there early or be open to sitting at the bar - which is what I always do. Don't worry, it doesn't impede the experience whatsoever. \\n\\nFood: 5 stars\\nEverything - and I mean EVERYTHING - I've ever had here has been absolutely delicious. Chef Dustin Haney is a culinary genius and one of the best kept secrets in Orlando. I mean, I literally hesitate to tell you because I don't want you to go and take up one of those precious bar seats I referenced earlier. Though the menu changes daily, they frequently carry 3 signature dishes for dinner: \\"Broccoli and Chedder\\", seared broccolini with pistachios, chile flakes, aged cheddar, and lemon, \\"Grilled Loup De Mer\\", a mediterranean sea bass with citrus thyme marinade, potato & fennel hash, and a beer blanc sauce, and \\"Pork Belly Adobo\\",\\nwhich, as it sounds, is a pork belly portion with soy glaze, over black rice, calamansi, carrots, and cilantro. They usually carry the latter two during Sunday Brunch as well, and all three are phenomenal. When going for Sunday Brunch, you can never go wrong with any variation on their Steak and Eggs or their to-die-for French Toast. The best advice I can give when going for dinner is \\"be adventurous and share\\". Bring friends. This is, after all, a tapas restaurant. \\n\\nDrink: 5 stars\\nA very extensive list of delicious craft beers and wines in accompanied by a handful of craft cocktails, created in house by one of their bartenders. All are good, but don't go expecting a full bar - they don't have one. \\n\\nService: 5 stars\\nI have never, ever had a poor experience with service here. Even on nights when they were in the weeds and/or understaffed due to unexpected circumstances, I barely felt the impact. In addition, the servers are great at communicating everything that goes into the masterful dishes that come your way from the kitchen, which makes this a really unique dining experience. Michael, Brittany, and David are my regular gang and all three are stellar. \\n\\nScratch is one of those places I take my \\"foodie\\" friends to and all of them have absolutely loved it. If you're not into tapas, try going for brunch where the portions are a little more full. If you're looking for something more mainstream, this place is not for you.

The pizza was 'meh' and the play area, while fun for the kiddos, smelled of feet, sweat and I-don't-wanna-leave desperation.  This was a couple of years ago, and I hadn't been back since.\\n\\nThat is, until last night when I was prompted to go to help out with a school fundraiser.  We went for dinner around 5pm.  The staff was super helpful and friendly and we were able to order two kids buffets and one adult buffet.  The menu says the buffet is only until 2pm, but we didn't have any issue ordering them for dinner.  On top of that, I asked if the buffet included any gluten free pizza, to which the manager said he'd be more than happy to include a gf pizza of my choice.  I asked for a half pepperoni and half Hawaiian.  Once the pizza was ready, a staff member came and found me to make sure I knew it was coming out so I would be able to get a few slices before others swooped in.  Above and beyond!\\n\\nTAKE NOTE: if there is a red checker printed paper under the pizza in the buffet area, it is GLUTEN FREE.  It's not the best gf pizza, but it's edible.  The sauce was a little on the overly generous side, and is more of a tomato paste than a sauce, but it was okay.  My husband joined us later and had the regular pizza; he said it was pretty good.\\n\\nAll in all a good experience.  The buffet is a pretty good deal and the kids had a blast playing in the play area, which still smelled of I-don't-wanna-leave desperation, but at least it didn't wreak of feet.  We'll be back again."},{"name":"The Park on South Lamar","address":"4024 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here a dozen times already but always at the outside bar. I've had pizzas, chicken wings and I'm sure more but can't remember.  I just remember they were good. I really like the diverse crowd I find when I go. They have this huge plastic cocktail shaker that they drop at your table when you order their special mexican mart. I had to have one of the shakers for the bar I work at and the staff was kind enough to sell me one which I use it often. Thx allot guys! The mex mart was pretty good too. Plenty of big screens, projections, and giant sized connect 4! I felt like I was getting a tan from their outdoor heaters but they do their job. One of these days I'll hang out inside but their deck area is so chill. Plus from the deck you can go for happy hour and just relax and watch south Lamar activity. One of my favorite south Austin watering holes. Not a bad date spot either but more its more suited to watch a game or hang with friends I think. Can't move to 5 stars till I go inside and see what they've got going on in there. I've seen bingo and trivia I think.

For such a tight (and its TIGHT) room, the service was pleasant and efficient; they knew what they were doing, and did not detract nor add to the experience, which is how it should be.  HERE is my problem:  the price is terribly inflated.  You are paying $30-$40 per entree and $9 for an ok glass of wine.  The quality of the experience just does not support that price point.

The top slice was mushy.  The bottom slice was soggy.  And full of butter.  The turkey was not fresh, nor was it seasoned.  I frequently get fresher lettuce and tomato slices at my local deli.  The \\"cucumber mayo\\" consisted of mayo with chunks of cucumber in it.  Wow.  Very innovative.  The \\"homemade chips\\" were waffle-cut potatoes, which were, you guessed it, also soggy (and greasy).  It's not as if there was a problem running the food, either, since it was very hot when it arrived.  Totally a kitchen issue.  Basically, the food wouldn't have passed in the worst of retirement community dining halls.\\n\\nUnderseasoned, overpriced, and generally unacceptable-- especially for a $12 sandwich.

I'm not sure what happened to Lee's that was here before, but I never had a chance to try it so I can't say I'll miss it (or maybe it's the same place, but re-branded?). Anyway, not only can you get sushi on this side of town, but it's reasonably priced and pretty damn tasty! Not only that, if you order the hibachi meals, you get a really good amount of food for your money. I had the veggie teriyaki hibachi meal, which comes with rice, a good pile of mixed stir fried veg, some noodles, and choice of soup or salad. I had the miso soup, which didn't have a strong miso flavor, but was okay for a brothy soup. This whole meal was $5.99. WHAT?!? If you chose chicken with it, the price only increased a dollar! I think this will keep them relevant on this side of town, because people 'round here like a good deal (myself included). I had the vegas roll, which was SO GOOD but a little rich - I didn't realize until after ordering that it was a deep-fried roll. My sisters had the sunny roll, which had mango in it. It was really good, if not a little loosely rolled. \\n\\nThere is seating in here for maybe 30-40 people, and it definitely has a quick-service kind of vibe. Don't expect table side service or your table to be bussed, but they do have nice sushi plates and reusable chopsticks. My only real gripe is that they only have bottled drinks here - so you get your choice of 20 oz beverage from the cooler. Also, the print on the menu/tv screen that listed the sushi roll ingredients was a little small.  But, the people working here are REALLY NICE. They all said hello when we walked in, goodbye when we left - including the cooks in the back! The woman behind the counter even stopped by our table to ask how everything tasted. It looks like there will be a sit-down hibachi place across the street opening up soon (in the old Fiesta Mariachi space) so I hope that it doesn't push these guys out.

We had to repeat our orders several times for her to get our correct.\\nWe ordered beef bone soup, spicy sausage something soup (no.5), and cold noodle with beef. The food we ordered were so great! These three stars are just for food, not the service.\\nLastly, we were paying separately in cash. I got five dollars and some thing as change and they gave me in one dollar coins. Since im not from canada, i just asked for bill (like paper bill instead of coins) because i didnt like keeping coins. I think they thought I wasn't gonna tip so they straight up told me to tip them 10% and i had to tell them i was going to after i got my changes back in bill. Then they were smiling and said okay. Then, when my friend paid and got changes after me, the lady told her to give tip too. Like wtf, you can't tell us to tip when you did no service for like 50 minutes. Like we had to raise hand and ask for things and now you are asking for tip? We gave them tips but they are the one of the worst service!!"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"How can I even start?

We've enjoyed several of the Po Boys, I was looking forward to an oyster po boy, I was not disappointed. Tip: the Po Boys come with mayo, but for the authentic NOLA feel, skip that and get your oysters (or shrimp) tossed in their Remoulade sauce. Yum, that is good stuff and the way the oyster and the shrimp Po Boy's should be listed on their menu. However, I should note it is Remoulade and not Romulan, which is what one of our servers called it, though I was very tickled at the Star Trek gaffe. \\n\\nThe \\"small\\" Po Boys are around 6\\" and very filling.

As I surveyed the dining room, the lunch special of the po boy and a side are extremely popular and a great deal. Regular fries top the sweet potato fries, which seem to be missing something.

For all of my life, I have had an intense distaste for capers. Even when I lived in Italy in college, capers were only acceptable as a hidden element of a dish--one that I couldn't notice and/or identify.\\n\\nScampo sold me on capers. Not only do I now recognize their usefulness as an ingredient, but I have tasted a way in which they are essential to a dish. \\n\\nI wish the current menu was online, because after the delicious wine (recommended by our server) and gluttonous nature of the meal I've forgotten quite a few of the elements of each dish. I'll do my best. What I do remember, what is seared in my mind, is the use of those freaking capers. I got the fried Haddock with Saffron Risotto and some sort of chip (parsnip maybe?). As I took my first bite of haddock, carefully avoiding the mini capers in a neat pile on the center, I was disappointed. It needed salt. I'd heard so much about this restaurant, and the haddock needed salt (of course there was none on the table). Thrown off and slightly disoriented, my mind raced. I couldn't ask for salt, but I also couldn't eat a saltless piece of fried fish. Ok, the capers are baby capers, maybe one or two won't be totally disgusto if I just combine them with everything else on my plate as a seasoning. Holy crap. That haddock just went from slightly bland to oneofthebestmealsI'veeverhad. I guess if you don't know me, its less shocking that capers had this effect on something I ate. But seriously. Capers.\\n\\nMoving on from that life-changing moment, the rest of the meal was fantastic. The presentation was phenomenal--we ordered the beet and almond buffala mozzarella and the ciccio bread as appetizers. I've never had garlic powder on my bread at a restaurant of this nature, but somehow, it worked. A little garlic powder surprised my mouth with every steaming bite of bread. Combined with the plethora of cheese types with which this bread was stuffed--it was a delicate combination of not-so-delicate ingredients. \\n\\nWe stared at the mozzarella for a few minutes, confused as to how to split it and make sure that we both got a bit of every element of the dish. Our waitress--obviously enjoying the novelty of two young'ns sporting New Englander work boots at her table--brought us some spoons to aid the effort. When we finally found a way to split this beautiful creation we were blown away by the different tastes we discovered in every bite. Even my last bite had a little taste surprise for me, a new combination of truffle oil, beet juice, and almond that I'd never had before. \\n\\nI could go on. The desserts were fantastic; they will be the inspiration for many a baked good to come out of my kitchen in the next few months. The decor was absolutely sick (the good kind of sick), with sculptural hung orbs and brickwork, piles of naan doubling as centerpieces of the dining room, succulents on every table, no detail left unattended to. \\n\\nThis place is fantastic, if you want to go to a nice restaurant in Boston, this is a sure bet. I didn't give it five stars because the website says \\"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\\" is five stars. I can only say \\"as good as it gets!\\" for places that I can go back to on a regular basis without having to then eat pb&j the rest of the week.

The wine arrived shortly thereafter without apology. Again, the food was very good. But at no point did anyone ever refill our water glasses. We all finished our meals with empty glasses. Since we were a party of seven, they added 20% gratuity to the bill. I guess the server figured his money was guaranteed so he didn't have to put forth effort. By the way, our reservation was at 5pm.

How awesome is that? \\n\\nI ordered the crab stuffed halibut that came with saffron rice, which was on their specials menu. I rarely (never) order fish, but I like halibut and I love crab...and it was on their specials menu. This dish was $32. My date ordered top sirloin, which came with your choice of baked potato or mashed potato, and veggies. This was also $32. We got a caesar salad ($9) to share, and it was a pretty big salad. It was really delicious! When we got it we were kinda confused because it doesn't look like a typical caesar salad. They also give you warm bread and butter. My halibut was cooked perfectly, and there was the right amount of crab in it. The rice had a lot of flavor, but not too much. It didn't take away from the flavors of the crab/fish.

I passed the Allston location a few months ago and saw their tagline was \\"alternative ice cream + cafe\\" and remembered that they had dairy-free ice cream, so I suggested to a couple of lactose intolerant friends that we should check it out.

I was surprised that the Matcha White Chip was so good. Not all green tea ice cream is good. It had great matcha flavor and did not taste at all of coconut. I would have preferred it without the white chocolate chips but I didn't mind them. The Peanut Butter was amazing. Very smooth and tasted just like you'd expected a peanut butter ice cream to taste. My friend raved about her Cherry Amaretto (I couldn't try it due to allergies) and the other friend was happy with the Cookie Dough. \\n\\nThe vanilla was very plain (though it cut the tartness of the Purple Mu), we all thought the Salted Caramel was not very exciting, and the coconut really came through with the Cake and Batter (which may be a plus or minus in your book). \\n\\nOur server was great. She was patient, encouraged us to try samples, answered all our questions, and was happy to make recommendations. They had a much larger selection than I was expecting (because of the photos of their board that I'd seen online) and my friends commented that a lot of the flavors were very interesting. I wanted to try the Cardamom Pistachio but they were out (well they just hadn't brought up more from the deep freezer). \\n\\nA note for the soy allergic - some of their baked goods and cakes contain soy but it sounded like all the ice cream was coconut-based. They make their sorbets with coconut water. Everything was well marked but if you're in doubt, make sure to ask. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back! Such a treat to have ice cream without taking any lactase pills or having any ill side effects afterwards! \\n\\nIf you're driving, parking is very difficult.

We lucked out and got a spot very close to the shop but we'd actually passed it up the first time we drove by because there was broken furniture with nails sticking out of it, glass, and other trash in the space.

There's never a wait, their service is attentive, and it's a good place to go to get a straight up decent dinner.  Oddly enough, Brandy Pete's has hands-down, *the* best steak that we've had - and at a ridiculously cheap price.  My boyfriend claims that the steak at Pete's is better than KO Prime, Grill 23 and other high-end fine dining establishments, and we aren't broke at the end of the meal.  My favorite dish to order is the Fillet Medallion Salad - it's a huge, leafy green salad with all the proper veggie accents and blue cheese and 5-6 large cuts of Fillet Mignon, cooked perfectly medium rare (and I've never been able to finish it) - for a mere $12.95!  We also enjoy the steaks with scalloped or mashed potatoes, which are the perfect cheesy consistency.  The salmon and side vegetables are also delicious.  For appetizers we enjoy their white pizzas, and the calamari is perfect.  Their portions are big enough for two, and even big enough for leftovers.  Pete's drink menu boasts some great red wines, their Malbecs and Pinot Noirs are delicious, and they have a decent beer menu as well.  \\n\\nThe crowd at Pete's in the evening is very post-work financial district, with a few jean-clad diners sprinkled in the mix.  Lots of dress shirts with loosened ties and slacks running around and the crowd lingering after work tends to get loud, entertaining and drunk as the evening progresses.  Their outdoor seating during the summer is lovely and on the inside we prefer the bar area with it's solid dark-wood high chairs and tables and low lighting. \\n\\nI could see Pete's getting very crowded for lunch, but for dinner and drinks it's just right.

The interior is stuffy, crowded, and overall a stressful place to eat. We were neither greeted with a polite hello nor a friendly smile. The lady at the front looked incredibly annoyed. She informed us we had to wait 2 hours before getting any seating at all. We checked in a couple of times just to see where we were on the waiting list. The lady told us to she would call when a table cleared in an irritated tone. She proceeded to tell me to \\"Go. Away.\\" I was speechless, and left the place in a pretty bad mood. Maybe she was overworked at the time, but it is less than professional to so crudely speak to a customer like this. Over 2 hours passes and still no call...we went to the lobster roll place nearby called Pauli's. Please don't come here. I instead suggest the restaurant next door. Much faster service.

All the high reviews got me in the Texasstar drive-thru (which is a good thing - had never heard of it before), but the \\"best food in Lakeway\\" or \\"on 620\\" as some other reviewers have stated. Uhhhhhh...Maybe we just ordered the wrong things? \\n\\nFor a \\"fast food\\" type \\"home style cooking\\" joint some items were \\"good,\\" while others were \\"good enough.\\" \\n\\nI had the Star Chicken w/ 2 sides. It was a good sized meal; however, I thought the protein was a tad on the small side but had great batter and was cooked very well. Forgive me in advance if I'm incorrect, but I feel very confident in saying that the mashed potatoes were instant (consistency) and the green beans in the casserole probably came from a can (slight tinny taste). \\n\\nMy husband had the Country Fried Steak-again small steak. He ordered the onion rings and fried pie as his sides. As many other people have stated in their reviews, the rings were AWESOME (yes, had to snag one)-but, does 4 onion rings a side dish make? As far as the pie, doubt it's house made-think McDonald's type in a small cardboard box. \\n\\nOverall quality, I would say cafeteria like (or equate it to a Grandy's if anyone around here knows what that is - it's a chain that has several locations in TX, just  not in Austin area). Really nice concept, but at just under $9 a plate I can imagine it's hard to compete with places like Chilis that offer 2 for $20s and have an order in advance and curbside pickup option. \\n\\nThe reviews about the wait are true. They do cook the food to order, so if you don't call ahead you will have to wait. It is drive-thru ONLY and there a few small tables out front. \\n\\nI'm glad to see that this local business has been around since 2001. They must be doing something right. I REALLY like to and prefer to support local businesses as opposed to chains. \\n\\nWill definitely visit Texastar again, but maybe opt for a burger and rings as that seems what most people rave about. \\n\\nOh, extra kudos to them for using recyclable cardboard serving boxes in lieu of Styrofoam!

And there was a sauce...that frankly I'm pretty sure was just charred bits of an old building that must have burned down in the area and was now soaking in dirty peanut oil.

The chocolate syrup is homemade and a little darker than what I'm accustomed to, which I had no problem with since I love dark chocolate too. It had just the right amount of sweetness. I only wish it were a little frothier, but that's not a deal breaker because of how good it tasted. \\n\\nI will come back and give the coffee another try when it's the weekend and I can actually have some without still getting the jitters at midnight. \\n\\nAs mentioned in my first review, the ambience is spectacular, and I'd love to come here and read sometime...when I do have the time."},{"name":"Monica's Mercato","address":"130 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The best Italian sub in Boston!\\nAll their sandwiches and prepared food is Excellent!\\nThe bread is baked in house and is incredible. \\nParking is tuff, but it's the North End and well worth it."},{"name":"101 Beer Kitchen","address":"817 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Westerville","stars":"4.5","text":"We had such a wonderful experience!

On the bright-side, you know the food should be worth it. At least while you're waiting for your table, there's a Stumptown cafe down the street and a blue-star donuts to keep you from staring at all of the food that you wish you could scavenge and scurry away with. \\n\\nThe place is set-up Tapas style, so expect to be sharing a lot and prepared to try several plates while everyone else goes foodie for a day.\\n\\nSmall Plates: \\nChocolate Potato Doughnut with creme anglaise. It's essentially a semi-sweet chocolate doughnut hole with semi-sweet condensed milk (except a bit milkier than condensed milk). It's a great start to a breakfast because it doesn't leave you feel like you're body will punish you for feeding it a greasy-sweet mushball that normal doughnuts would leave you feeling. It also doesn't overwhelm you requiring the milk or coffee that normally goes with doughnut consumption. \\n\\nThe FOODS:\\n(Meats) Steak and Cheddar Eggs Cascade blah blah in a skillet. A very well seasoned Steak and good cheddar eggs, but what made the dish was the bed of cornmeal pancake & jalapeno butter underneath it all. It adds the right amount of sweetness from the cornmeal and the zest from the jalapeno butter to complement each other to where it tasted more like a well-done dinner concoction, like southern-style steak and egg dinner. \\n\\n(The Boards) The Fried Egg & Cheddar Biscuit ‚Äãwith fried chicken was equally appetizing. Though harder to share with people, it was like a well prepared breakfast sandwich. Even it that doesn't sound exciting, at least it was one that felt worthwhile getting. The Chicken was seasoned well and wasn't covered from the egg and cheddars stronger flavors, but all components were noticable. The only issue was that the Biscuit was a bit thick, making the bites inconsistent due to awkward gripping, so prepare yourself to shred this thing beforehand with your awesome knify-forky skills.\\n\\nI feel like this place is cheating by remaking lunch and dinner dishes with a breakfast appearance, but either way it's hard to argue with a breakfast place that's worth going to"},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love this place!

But no one judged, and that made me feel really nice in this place.\\n\\nNow on to the food/drinks.

AND they have sweet potato fries [sidenote, these come with some sauce on the side that is absolutely horrid, it tastes like robotussin], which I adore. But even better, they have CURLY FRIES! Om nom nom, they are so greasy and crunchy and delicious. My boyfriend usually gets some variation of a burger, and they're always tasty, about on par with mine. I did get a chicken sandwich from there [I think it was a cordon bleu-esqu sandwich if I can remember] that was awful. It was super dry and hard to choke down, so maybe steer clear of that. But with a menu the size of a small book, it's hard to not be able to find something to please your tastes.

I have no idea why, exactly, but I guess it's a combination of extremely fresh greens and interesting touches.  I remember (after looking at the menu last night) a salmon salad that I used to have there for lunch.  The hearts of palm really made the salad, but I do think they just use overall quality, fresh salad ingredients.  Anyway, last night, I did not have the aforementioned salmon salad, but all of our entrees came with side salads.  The house salad is great--by default, it comes with a honey mustard/hot bacon dressing but their bleu cheese is good too.  It has bleu cheese crumbles and real bacon bits.  There is no way for me to effectively describe why it was so good, but it was.  It's like Yuppie Crack or something.\\n\\nAlso, every salad is served with a croissant.  But when I say \\"croissant\\", let me assure you that what comes to mind is not what is served at \\nJoey D's.  It is soft and gooey and chewy and warm and drizzled in some sort of honey glaze.  It's really good.\\n\\nMy steak (I had the filet) was really tasty as well, but to be honest I think I would have been equally happy with ordering one of their huge entree salads.

I typically tell people, if you want to try this place - go mon-wed. Once thu hits, the line gets long, real long. We waited over 2 hours. They took our number down so we could roam around while we waited. At first it was fine because we grabbed a drink across the street - but once the hunger pains hit and I didn't want to waste my appetite on anything else, we started to get a little 'over tha wait.' We were finally seated close to 9:00pm - they actually had to turn a bunch of other folks away that they just couldn't seat before closing. Strangely, we sat there for over 5 minutes with no one taking our order. I got grumpy - hey, if you're going to have customers waiting 2hours, expect that they're going to look for very good service. When the waitress finally came by - my icey attitude melted away because she was very nice. We ordered a bunch of oysters for an appetizer and 2 hot lobster rolls for dinner. I had trouble deciding on a glass of wine and asked for a suggestion by the waitress. Well, I guess I should have realized that I may have set myself up, but little did I know she suggested the $15 glass of red. I had no idea it'd be $15...there were no other red wines by the glass on the menu for that much. It was delicious - so her suggestion wasn't bad - but I got sticker shock when the bill came. 2 glasses costing a cool $30 - add on 2 $25 lobster rolls, oysters, and my husbands beers - it was a legit bill. I was glad to be buzzed signing that tab. At the end of the day, I still think its the best lobster roll and the only hot, buttered version I know of in the city.

I tried Garrido's at ACL this weekend and the burrito they served came with the meat and cheese cold. Plus it was only ground beef and a rather stingy serving.

Pulled up to the location to find it was in a strip mall. No biggie. Walked in with my wife, son, and parents to find a raucous and jubilant crowd in the midst of celebration. The decor is fun and quite similar to Tijuana Flats, only with a more Cajun feel to it (naturally). \\n\\nWe were greeted and seated promptly. Our server was helpful and informative. He suggested a few appetizers and we went with the wings, onion rings, fried pickles, and cheese stack. Great stuff! For entrees, I went with the shrimp etoufee. Wife took the server's suggestion and ordered the shrimp and andouille sausage with cheese grits. AMAZING. The etoufee was splendid as well. Mom, dad, and my son all went with po' boys. The shrimp po boy may have been the best I've ever tasted. Each table has a bottle of an unbelievably-tasty hot sauce that is a blend of cayenne and horseradish. Tasty without setting your world on fire. \\n\\nIf you like quiet meals in a reserved environment, this might not be your place. If I have one complaint, it's that this place is L-O-U-D...but if you know that walking in, it's not that big of a deal. The service was spectacular, food was awesome, and we had a great time. In my opinion, the prices are quite reasonable as well. It's not that easy to make healthy choices with so much decadence on the menu (bread pudding and beignets for dessert!), but I ran 8 miles this morning to compensate. Guilt, my friends, is a heck of a motivator."},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"The cost was $27.00 for a dozen basic doughnuts in a box and a large basic coffee.

Saturday morning wait averages 2 hours. If you're looking for a table, try and arrive before 11 to put your name on the wait list because they stop taking names when the list  fills up. They do call you when a table is available, which was nice. When the waiter sat us, he encouraged us to eat family style, but the portions are definitely not large enough to share one serving with more than 2 people if you want more than one bite each.

The first things you notice when you walk in is its spaciousness and colorful design.  What I love about buffet is that there is no wait between entering a restaurant and getting to taste that first morsel of food.  Another thing you notice almost out of shock is that the service at Maki Maki is outstanding with clear attention paid to having waitresses who are friendly and attentive to customers and clearing your plates very soon after you finish and are up to the buffet again - you should definitely still tip 18-20%.  \\n\\nThe sushi buffet consists of many types of sushi, sashimi and a wide range of maki.  But wait folks, that's not all, there are snow crab legs (warm and chilled), raw clams and oysters, and cooked shrimp.  On the right-hand side of the buffet are a series of cooked seafood items, from ginger and scallion lobster (yes LOBSTER!) to excellent fried rice.  What has been most suprising to me on my subsequent visits is that I've actually eaten much more from the cooked items section than the sushi section, which I now approach as an appetizer more or less.  My relatively minor complaints are about the labeling of some fish (tilapia does not equal red snapper - they may have fixed this relatively common misidentification) and once the salmon was a little too fishy tasting.  In general I avoid salmon as a sushi/sashimi item and also because of the fact there is a high probability that it is farmed salmon, which depending on your ethical bent may be more sustainable but is likely less healthy.  \\n\\nYou can finish your meal after several rounds of buffet with fresh fruit and a gigantic chocolate fondue fountain the size of two Stanley Cups.  All in all, if you don't leave here full and satisfied then you haven't approached the meal in the right way.  Remember, this is a seafood and sushi buffet and for $30 I think it's exactly the appropriate price - any more would probably be too much.  \\n\\nLastly, this is an extremely family friendly place and we saw many families here having a blast of a time.  Overall, Maki Maki gets it right and I hope they continue to adapt and improve with time.  Get there before it becomes widely known and too popular."},{"name":"The Sound Table","address":"483 Edgewood Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The Sound Table is Old 4th Ward's newest, regentrifying business of the Edgewood area. Located on the corner of Edgewood and Boulevard, I think it's safe to say that this may become the most happening of Atlanta corners. Sound Table falls within eyesight of Danneman's, Corner Tavern, Cafe Circa and within earshot of Thumbs Up, Lotta Frutta, Miso Izakaya, Rathbun's/Krogbar and Lenny's. It comes as no surprise that the owners of Top Flr (Midtown's chic and successful restaurant/lounge) are in on this trendy endeavor. The feel is very similar to Top Flr but more laid back and urban. Upstairs is strictly restaurant dining with some light grooves playing and downstairs was all bar/lounge with full PA and DJ setup. I'm hoping the location will help filter out the douches who are still afraid to travel to this side of town.\\n\\nThe concept, from what I've read, is supposedly street food which is the biggest trend in the Atlanta scene since the exciting (sarcasm) hamburger. Fortunately, for Sound Table's sake, I didn't find the focus to be street food at all. The menu tends to lean in many directions. Each item was carefully thought out and crafted with unique takes on flavor and ingredients. Unfortunately, like it's sister restaurant, I found that most (3 out of our 4) of the dishes fell a little short on execution. Additionally, this is a small plate restaurant (like Top Flr), meaning that no main comes with a side, which also makes it a little pricier. But with a menu like this, I'll be back again to try more and perhaps retry some others.\\n\\nAlso of note, the cocktail and beer menu are more than impressive. The cocktail menu was a near three pages long and much like the food menu, featured singular and thoughtful combinations. I ended up ordering the Estate di Romeo - one of the more feminine (it came out pink and served in a martini glass) cocktails. Featuring housemade limoncello and a whole bunch of other ingredients that I can't speak intelligently about, it was highly enjoyable. Just please, serve it in a highball?\\n\\nWe started out with the Salade Frisee which was an absolute knockout. Every element complimented the next ingredient in this terrific salad resulting in an amalgamation of perfection. Tender and succulent duck confit adorned unique frisee greens tossed in a light, lemony dressing. Macerated raisins, preserved, tiny chunks of lemon and what we thought were crispy bits of duck skin topped off the tapered white bowl.\\n\\nThe Salade was followed by an order of the Belgian-Style Frites. This is an easy one to make and a lot of restaurants in town have it down. All the good renditions I've had started with a fresh cut potato. I think Sound Table skipped this step. The fries seemed frozen. In fact they were nearly identical to the ones I grew up eating at Brookwood Cafe long ago. Sadly, they weren't particularly crispy or golden brown. I think a double fry (starting lower and finishing higher) would really improve these guys. Additionally, the housemade mayonnaise could really benefit from some flavoring element. It was just plain mayo. Check out Leon's smoked tomato rendition for a real treat.\\n\\nFor our two larger courses, we went with the Morrocan Lamb's Bread and the Szechuan Fish Fry. The Lamb's Bread was essentially lamb pot pie. The cinnamon-spiced crust was really a thick and hearty delight. Unfortunately, the filling was a let down. There was hardly any gravy inside the filling and the lamb was tough. Curry was mentioned as a flavoring element on the menu but if it was there, it was entirely too subtle. A quick fix could catapult this dish into a favorite.\\n\\nThe Szechuan Fish Fry was also on the average side of the spectrum. A small fish filet, which is diced and quickly fried, was well prepared but didn't really excite me. The sauce was the star on this dish and was very reminiscent of the blood orange reduction I had at Top Flr.\\n\\nIt's imperative to keep in mind that while 3/4 dishes had some problems, this is the restaurants first week open, and I'm sure they have some kinks to work out in the kitchen. The food was still enjoyable because it was a nice face-lift to the junk food drab that the Atlanta dining scene has been dwelling on the last year. Pizza and burgers can only go so far. Innovative and inspired, I will be returning many times to retry sound table. Their smooth and romantic atmosphere alone was enough to draw me back and I think it's safe already (first week of opening) that this place will be a huge success. It really says something that I considered it a great meal, but only really enjoyed one dish.\\n\\n3.5 Stars rounded up on this one."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Have dined there twice in about 3 weeks.

Sun Sui Wah,  Shiang Garden , etc.. ). \\n\\nIf you plan on having the peking duck, you have to call in advance to reserve an order. I called a day ahead, but I heard you can call a few hours ahead to let them know and they'll have a duck prepared for you.\\n\\nThe duck is a very standard size duck (if you've had roast duck at ANY other chinese restaurant or BBQ joint; you'll realize they're all the same size).\\n\\nThe preparation is as follows\\n1) A very small portion of skin only is brought to the table ( apparently, it's cut from the duck breast only ).\\n\\n2) Two servings of thinly sliced duck ( with both meat + skin ) is brought out.  15 slices of those round pancake thingies as well as a dish containing hoisin sauce / sliced onions / cucumbers.\\nIf you want extra portions of the pancake / scallions / cucumbers. Each cost $2. A tad bit on the pricey side given how small the portions are.\\n\\n3) Finally a duck soup is brought out ( medium sized, suitable for 4 or 5 people ). The soup was very nice and I enjoyed the smooth rich taste of it.\\n\\nThe duck is quite lean as I didn't notice very much white fat at all. The meat is soft ( as you'd expect from a duck ). The skin is not very crispy. In fact, the skin has almost the same texture as a roast duck you'd find at a BBQ joint. This is a big change from what you'd get at most other Chinese restaurants where they'd serve the skin separate from the meat ( and it's very dry / crispy ). The only thing that differentiates this duck from one you'd pay $20 for at a cheap BBQ joint is that this duck is noticeably leaner. \\n\\n\\nThe entire duck course costed $88, a fair bit more than what you'd pay at most other restaurants.\\n\\nI didn't get a chance to try the other dishes but they did look quite appealing, from my observations of other people's tables. I will say the portions were quite meager given the cost of the dishes ( a trend that seems to align with the main duck course ).\\n\\nAll in all, not really worth it considering how little it differentiated itself (leaner duck) from other peking duck choices in the city.\\n\\nIf you want my opinion on the best place to get Peking Duck. \\nSun Sui Wah"},{"name":"Blue Danube","address":"2439 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"THE DUBE!!\\n\\nI just moved to Boston with my boyfriend in the Fall and we constantly comment on how we miss the Dube.

Friendly, informative, attentive, even with having what looked like 4-5 other tables near us, he still was always 1 step ahead, so we never had to ask for a thing! He recommended the Thursday special on pints of the variety of beers that are brewed by the brewery. I had the Buttface Amber Ale and it was awesome! My friend ordered the Blonde which she also loved! He also recommended a few of the appetizers and we went with the Pretzels and dip to share. So good, and a very large portion! With my beer choice I decided to keep it going, and go with the butt face amber chicken sandwich. All I can say is I will definitely be coming back to get that sandwich...wow!

The place itself is small, but the restaurant and the dishware are all cutely decorated. I ordered a beef and seafood tofu soup set (9.95), which came with a yummy congee and salad pre-side dishes. The congee was comforting and flavorful and the salad dressing was amazing. It was a refreshing strawberry balsamic that i'd never tasted before.  At first I thought those were the only side dishes and was kind of disappointed that I didn't get any of the regular sides, but then realized that the normal sides came with my meal. There were 5 side dishes - marinated potatoes, beansprouts, kimchi, broccoli, and seaweed that came with my tofu soup. All of them were full of flavor, but not overpowering, which was awesome, because one of my pet peeves is bland side dishes. I personally LOVE marinated potatoes, especially when they're very marinated, which describes these potatoes perfectly. \\nThe portions for the sides were small, but they were perfectly sized in conjunction with the tofu soup, which delicate but also full of flavor itself. I was pretty full after having finished everything, and it only cost me 9.95! (plus tax). Each table also has it's own tea thermos so you never have to wait around for more tea. The barley tea was also light and refreshing. \\nI enjoyed everything about my meal and went home with a warm, happy belly. \\n\\nThe only complaint I had was 1) the parking (which is horrible on Alexandra no matter what, so it's not really the restaurant's fault), and 2) the chopsticks, which were traditional, flat, stainless steel chopsticks that I just struggled to use. They were quite heavy, and hard to pick things up with due to their flat nature.

The vibe is a little claustrophobic and you might find yourself sharing a table with other people, but if you love a good raw bar, it'll be worth it.\\n\\nWe visited this past Friday night after a shotgun wedding, and the bride and groom specifically wanted to celebrate here. We waited almost three hours for a table, but luckily, there are plenty of bars in the area to kill waiting time. With a couple of beers and pub appetizers in us, we finally secured a table, pushed aside the menus, and began checking off orders of raw bar slip that the server dropped on the table.\\n\\nI've never tasted oysters of this caliber before. With many varieties from the East and West coasts, each had their own subtle hints and flavors the way that fine cheeses do. The Kumamotos were the group favorite with their delicate highlights of melon. The Bluepoints from Deep Bay were much saltier, but not without their charm. We washed the whole meal down with a bottle of champaign we had ordered for the celebration.\\n\\nWe racked up the most expensive meal I've ever had, very quickly. There were four of us and we ate several dozen oysters, drank a bottle of champaign, and ordered one lobster roll; the check came to $340.

We sat down at our table by the window, which was great for people watching because there was plenty going on the entire time we were there: locals talking to their neighbors, Dino's regulars coming in to pick up their takeout, etc. About a minute later, we were given fresh bread, which was delicious on its own and also was useful later to dip in the sauce. The bread was shortly followed by our tortellini, one of the best things I have ever eaten. The pumpkin was flavorful and not too sweet but yet sweet enough that it contrasted with the tortellini perfectly, and the sauce was wonderfully thick and creamy.

For the same chicken and rice served with a sizable amount of moist pita bread I get in NYC for $7, Halal Bros in Austin charges $7.49 and there is an additional $1 charge for each pita bread. In total, I have spent about $2-$3 more in Austin for more mediocre halal food and the same quantity than what I ordered in NYC.\\n\\nFrom a quality perspective, the meat tasted dry and the white sauce wasn't super memorable. For the extra money, I would skip the pita bread entirely. Warm? Yes. Grainy in texture and a little too chewy for my liking? Also yes. Furthermore, the plate was about 1/4 lettuce and 3/4 chicken and rice, which seems stingy for the chicken and rice portion. As a point of improvement, I would recommend the staff ask which sauces the customer prefer to have. Unbeknownst to us, both white sauce and hot sauce were included by default. My boyfriend didn't want the spiciness, so the added hot sauce was another disappointment.\\n\\nService (2/5)\\nWe came in on a Friday night between 10PM-11PM. Naturally, I figured this spot was a hot late night munchies venue given their late hours. There was a large group of students standing in line, which I wasn't annoyed at. If the place is popular, then so be it - I'll have to wait. However, what really got to me was (1) the majority of students were waiting with a friend, so out of the pack of 10-15 students, only 1/3 - 1/2 were actually ordering and (2) the staff did nothing to streamline the process or minimize the number of \\"loitering\\" students in line. As a common courtesy, I also would have appreciated the staff placing silverware and napkins in my to-go order, but they did not do so. Consequently, just remember to pick up your own silverware before you leave the premises!\\n\\nAtmosphere (3/5)\\nThe overall space is large. White walls with large tables, but not much personality in the building.

The sandwich comes with mozzarella, tomato, and greens (arugula I believe) on ciabatta bread. It also has a sundried tomato \\"aioli\\" which some days it looks like it contains mayo, other days it looks like it's just a sundried tomato tapenade.

I mentioned to my brother that I somehow always missed a chance to come to this venue or the one at Portland State Farmer's Market.  The one on Alberta is some out of my way, so that sort of explains that, and for the last two summers at PSU Farmer's market outlet, the lines have been too long (I get impatient with lines).  My brother just laughed at my excuses and picked me up in the new project he's working on, a 1966 Chev pickup, and made me go to Pine State Biscuits on Alberta.  He didn't have to put my arm up behind my back and force me TOO much and there was no kicking or screaming (just squeaks of happiness that I finally made it to the altar of outstanding biscuits (second only to my mother's heavenly biscuits) and fried chicken (oh the fried chicken).  \\n\\nWe both ordered the regular Reggie and coffee for my brother and water for me.  The counter helpers were very nice and laid back (considering the crowds I hear they usually have to deal with) and brought our delicious food out quickly.  We were able to walk in and get a table toot sweet (which is close to miraculous).  My brother suggested I slice off some plain fried chicken not covered with gravy or biscuit and be sure to eat that first just to get the amazing flavor.  I don't think I've ever tasted such deliciosity, really some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Then I sliced into the whole Reggie itself.  The mix of different flavors (spiciness, tang, subtle sweetness, salty, smoky, smooth) and textures (soft, crispy) blended perfectly on one hand and on the other hand also stood on their own.  Another thing that's great about eating here at Pine State Biscuits is the portion control.  The Reggie had the perfect amount of everything and was not overwhelmingly too much where you end up feeling like bursting after enjoy eating such a delicious meal.  \\n\\nIn between bites of Reggie goodness, we admitted we'd been dreaming of the best lunchtime treat ever since we'd set up the lunch time a couple of weeks ago.  We then had a great time discussing the Portland food scene and why people seem to hate Guy Fieri so much and why Bobby Flay seems like a reasonable guy compared to what the haters say about him.  It was particularly fun because the two of us remember when ethnic food in Portland was largely represented by Mexican restaurants and food just never was talked about except when you made reservations at the restaurant.  By the way, if you'd like to meet my brother, he's representing the family here on Yelp as Gary L. and has already written some 118 reviews since January 2014.  Don't ask me why my mother named us Kerri and Gary  (we're not twins) because we haven't yet figured that out.  Anyhow, Gary L., thanks for lunch and for finally getting my sorry self on over to Pine State Biscuits."},{"name":"Scratch","address":"223 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"My new favorite spot!

The restaurant wasn't particularly busy but she chose to chat with coworkers rather than attend to her tables (others in our area were noticeably frustrated as well).  Once we gave our dinner orders she was conspicuously absent from our table side.  Water glasses went unfilled.  She didn't ask how our meals were. There was never an offer of dessert.

I've tried a couple of the appetizer salads and they are great, too. \\n\\nBy the way , this is a great place for the gluten-free, dairy free diner...\\n\\nIf you'd like to get more authentic Vietnamese without venturing into the uncomfortable authenticity of Pho#000, this is about as good as it gets."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is amazing, but the service is blah.

Most restaurants seem to be all about quantity and getting the most bang for your buck and often lack when it comes to the quality of their food. However, that is not the case with Le Coq Au Vin.\\n\\nThis quaint little French restaurant is easy to miss because the building doesn't really stand out and tends to blend in to its surroundings. The sign is usually what catches peoples eye, although many people come here because they've heard about it through friends and family. Plus, there aren't too many restaurants like this that serve this kind of food in Central Florida.\\n\\nIf you haven't guessed, this place is considered fine dining so the prices are not cheap, but it's worth it for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary. Their signature dish is le coq au vin which is basically chicken cooked in red wine with various vegetables...the method of cooking is a bit more complicated than it sounds. This is definitely a dish to try if you never have. The flavors are unbelievable and so good. Their seafood is pretty fresh and also cooked to perfection. All dishes are cooked to order and served beautifully on what I am sure is fine china. For dessert, definitely go with the creme brulee, which you have to order at the same time as your entree because it takes so long to cook...that means its the real thing though!\\n\\nAs is expected of restaurants like this, the wait staff are amazing and truly take care of your every dining need. Your drink glass is never empty and they really know the menu, so if you have questions they answer them in complete detail. They are also pleasant to chat with. Reservations are usually a must for this place...especially on occasions like mother's day and Easter. Every now and again, they'll have brunch, but I'm pretty sure they're open only for dinner on most days.\\n\\nOverall, a must!"},{"name":"U-Sushi","address":"1393 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"NEVER EVER ORDER FROM HERE.\\n\\nI LOVED Ginga's authentic quality and friendly customer service, and was hoping U-Sushi succeed to the GInga's quality...\\nI ordered dinner through the phone, which is I used to do the same thing with Ginga.

I talked to her while I was watching over their website that has a whole menu, and ordered dishes clearly and specifically, but she said she was not good at communicating in English (she said she is a Chinese) and she could not get what I wanted. She passed the phone to another Chinese guy (they were talking in chinese over the phone), and I repeated my order again for him.

We nearly waited for at least 10 minutes before we decided that we needed to flag someone down in order to get service. We ultimately got our orders and started to eat. The food I can say was 'ok'. I guess I'm a little biased because our Mexican food back home was so much better-tasting. It would be so much better if they had home-made tortillas versus the generic store-bought products.

I ordered the Lamb sandwich, which turned out to be amazing! The bread was excellent, which is why this sandwich was above average. The lamb with the goat cheese and arugula was a very nice combination, but I can't remember another time when the most unique item on a sandwich was the bread, I really enjoyed it. It was pricy for sure, usually when you spend $10 on a sandwich you get chips, not in this case. I ended up getting and lemon merengue pie, which was very good, that was $5 but it was a very nice size piece and it was very tasty.

The problem here, I think, is that City BBQ has reached a point where they don't get a lot of traffic at the individual locations and the food isn't turning over quickly.

About 3 minutes after we were seated our waiter, Edwin arrived. He proceeded, with a great energy and presence, to great us and ask us about our experiences in Disney so far. He then mentioned this was a seafood restaurant, voted the best in fact, for 2018 in the Orlando area. Very exciting stuff so far!! He then proceeded to ask us about the dining plan, we get deluxe, so we can enjoy all the unique food options and indulge a bit, it is vacation after all!! \\n\\nEdwin suggested we get the most bang for our buck and was especially awesome with my Mother, who is not nearly as adventurous with food as I. He even talked her into getting the seafood tower!!!\\nWhich was one of the most amazing ones of its kind of seen and definitely better in taste than any I had had previously. Though, a little bit on the saltier side.\\n\\nI ordered the lobster boil. That was boiled to perfection in butter and old bay, as well as potatoes and corn. My only criticism was that everything seemed to have just a bit too much salt for my liking.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend got clams for an appetizer, they were some of the best she's ever had!! She got the scallops for her entree, the cook on them was a perfect opaque and buttery texture. However they were also a bit too salty for her liking.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, we had an amazing experience here!! Edwin was amazing and the service was first class, definitely recommend asking for him!

First, as Yelper Dean C. mentioned in his review of February 17, 2017, Redbones no longer offers mild/medium barbecue sauce, only hot or sweet.  The mild sauce was delicious, so I'm sorry that it's gone. Second, you used to be able to get a small green salad as one of the sides that come with a sandwich plate. No more. You can still get a salad as an appetizer, but not as a side. Why? Finally, they've done away with the corn pudding. The corn pudding was phenomenal, and I'm sure it was a fan favorite, so I'm wondering why Redbones removed it from the menu.

The empanadas, the cornmeal variety, were delicious. The fruit shakes (Mamey, an interesting almost chocolatey fruit) were amazing. But the woman at the counter is one of the star attractions here: she is extremely friendly, patient, informative, and appreciative of your business. My companion ever mistook her for flirting with me, but I really think she is just really proud of her business, and intrigued to see these avid blanco foodies, seeking this spot out. When she noticed I was *sort of* familiar with this kind of food, she informed me that they also have a bunch of Dominican specialties, since a large chunk of their clientele is Dominican. This is wonderful, but why Westy? She told me people are telling her she should move to JP, but I said, \\"hell no! Stand your ground. Make them come to you.

Although I did find the magnetized animal bodies that you could take apart and put together in different ways slightly creepy... Anyway, if you're wondering what a bunch of adults were doing in the kid's room, Cbus Universitas is a group of people (and you can too!) who are interested in innovation in Columbus - and that's pretty much it! We like to get ideas through any avenue, including play, so this is a good space for us. \\n\\nThe black box room (it has another name, I wish I remembered it) is more my speed; it is beautiful, all black walls with student black and white photography on the walls and black chairs, perfect for meetings and whatnot.

From the warm color palette of the decor to the toasty smells permeating the air, I immediately felt at home. The only slightly off putting thing was this like... fake fox? Dog? Maybe it was taxidermy. At first I thought it was creep but as I ate the darned thing began to grow on me! The hostesses were attentive and kind. Our waitress was a total delight! She was super sweet and came by go check on us just enough. She recommended we put eggs on our hashed out and it was a stellar suggestion! \\n\\nWhich brings us right to... the food! Me and my wife always get food to share. We got the shrimp and grits and the hashed out with 2 eggs. \\n\\nShrimp and grits: so delicious! The BBQ sauce adds a welcomed sweetness that compliments the saltiness of the cheese grits. The shrimp was well cooked and very tasty. It also has jalape√±os and caramelized onions, which I felt was so different but it worked perfect to create a complex dish with a lot of layers and depth. So many textures! I am a huge shrimp and grits fan and this was awesome. \\n\\nHashed out: imagine if you made a hash with fries. That's what this is like. It's like cut up chorizo fries. And it is marvelous. The toasty yet chewy hash is bound together by cheese and wowzers. It's as good as it looks. \\n\\nNow I'll tell you something. I grabbed a little bit bit of the hashed out and dipped it in my grits with BBQ sauce. I highly recommend you do that for maximum enjoyment. \\n\\nWe also had the blood orange cardamom house made soda. It was smoky and sweet and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend.

Didn't really care for them the first visit, but on return they were very good, so I'm going to assume the first visit was an anomaly. \\n\\nThe OK:\\n-The French Schnitzel. It needed more sauce. The sandwiches are heavily dependent on the sauces for flavor. As it was, not as much flavor as it should have had. \\n\\nThe not so good:\\n-Flavor of the chicken - without the sauces, it's just kind of bland. Not bad, but they really need to get more flavor in the breading. \\n-Speed of service. To elaborate, twice that I've gone in was only 1 person working. That's 1 person taking orders, cooking, running orders, and cleaning up. And he was busting his tail, but one person can only do so much. Only place I've ever seen that work is a Subway store. It doesn't work here. Both times I had several people come in behind me, so the employee had to take all of their orders before he could even begin cooking ours. One \\"slow\\" customer throws the whole process off (and there was one the last time I was there), as does a group arriving at the same time.

I'm a huge art fan and I paint at home; water colors & oil and I also use charcoals. I cant call myself an artist just as my husband cant call him self a philosopher; its not something you name yourself with, instead it's something you try to reach your whole life using dying before you ever feel worthy enough of the title.\\n\\nI wouldn't go so far as to saying I enjoy modern art so my opinion of this museum might be a bit biased in parts of this review. I generally disagree with 'art is what you make it' and/or 'anything can be art.' Art..true art..takes massive amounts of talent and not many people can call themselves true artists; such talent is rare. It seems that current times have relaxed the standards that society use to put on art. That's my beef, so to speak. Take it or leave it. That aside, this museum has both modern art and traditional art, everyone from Picaso to Monet to the great classics. When I went this past Sunday they had a few different areas closed. I figured I would go on a Sunday (free on Sunday) to check it out before spending money in case I didn't like it; like I said, modern art isn't my thing. While they did have a LOT of modern art the older modern art, like Monet, I love. Things like giant Camble Soup cans or flashing LED lights I just don't care for. I love sculptures and I couldn't tell you if they had any since so many areas were closed off. The whole first floor is for kids so really they only have one floor of art and half of it wasn't available to view so I cant write much of a critique here. The paintings they had I haven't seen before, which is nice. I LOVE Monet and for them to have so many of his paintings is amazing to me. They also have a whole room dedicated to Picaso, although not many in there are of his work. I could spend all day in the purple room. I'm not sure what it's called but it's the one where all of the old classics are found. They have so many all over the walls with benches for sitting & sketching. I can see myself coming back to see what else they have and to sit and draw. Overall a great little museum good for modern art fans and traditionalists alike.  \\n\\nThey have this ceramic floor from 300BC and it's simply amazing to see. Well worth paying just to see this one thing!\\n\\n3 stars...probably wont stay 3 stars.

Horrible. Well, that's not entirely true - I thoroughly enjoyed the mozzarella bar, but how can you really screw up burrata with tomato and balsamic?  The rest of it: horrible.  For starters, the menu is less than clear as to what is in anything.  Granted, on our first round we should have asked what their pizza with the one-word description \\"lobster\\" meant.  We assumed a traditional pizza with lobster on it.  This wasn't the case - it came with a thick, heavy orange cream sauce, lobster, and topped with globs of some brown mixture.  When it arrived and we asked our server what the \\"brown\\" was, he response was \\"oh... that's a shallot / onion mixture that's supposed to be in the base of the pizza. it's not supposed to look like that.\\"  That was it. The end.  I'm sorry, but as a patron, that is a terrible answer that offered zero solution. So you just admitted this food was a) not what we expected and b) wrong, and you just left us with it?  Grazie.  The second dish we ordered was the Bucatini w/ rock shrimp scampi ... get ready: described as \\"w/ lemon and herbs\\".  We think pasta...lemon...herbs... white wine/garlic sauce.  Instead, it arrived lathered in another heavy, orange cream sauce mirroring the pizza.  Completely disappointed (and realizing that I was going to have zero food in me for the night), I tried again with the server and inquired about one of her sides - the \\"small, colorful roasted potatoes\\".  The side arrived and I couldn't cut through them with my knife.  I pointed out to the server that they weren't done (perhaps if they had in fact been \\"small\\" they would have been) and they were boring and had zero flavor.  Disappointment #3.  A new bowl was returned to me, still not roasted enough and this time - they were no longer colorful - just a bowl of gold yukon potatoes.  I gave up.  I was equally disappointed that the server chose not to comment on the fact that I clearly hadn't touched my food and she cleared a full bowl of undercooked potatoes.

We were early, around 5:30 for a 6PM reservation, and were seated promptly.  The restaurant is beautiful.  And the service was very nice, very attentive.  My glass was always being refilled, the waitress explained everything nicely.  The breadsticks and pesto sauce is AWESOME!  These are the pros.\\n\\nThe cons - I was freezing the whole time.  I am not usually cold, ever.  But they sat me right underneath the A/C and it blew on my head the whole night.  With my hair blowing around, it was double-y annoying, but when I started to sneeze before dessert, I had to move seats.  \\n\\nThe food was also disappointing.  We started with the Walking Elephant, which was basically a huge nacho with tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.  I know I should call it something fancier than a nacho, but a nacho it was.  \\n\\nThen we had the mozzarella with prosciutto and figs.  The mozzarella was good.  The figs were supposed to be caramelized, but instead they were burnt.  They were definitely past the caramelized state.  So I was disappointed with this dish.\\n\\nMain entree was grilled salmon for me and the skirt steak special for my husband.  The salmon would've been delicious, but it was charred.  I like a little blackened, but the skin was absolutely burnt.  I had to peel it off to eat the fish.  And the side of spinach was overloaded with salt.  And the potato thingy on the other side was just not good.  I never knew you could do potatoes wrong, but those were not right.  I didn't even eat it past the first bite.  My husband's steak was so raw, it was pretty much carpaccio.  And the risotto side was just ehh.  \\n\\nWe finished with the Tiramisu and that was good.  It was a good slice to split between 2 people who typically don't eat sweets.  \\n\\nOur bill was $130 before tip.

If I want to pull back a little bit on the heat, I pour all of the sauce without the chili.

It's spicy, and the lime flavor is what jumps out to me most. It comes with one sticky rice, which makes great for dipping. I like ordering a second sticky rice since there's so much pork. \\n- The thai iced tea is pretty great. $3 is a solid price point. They give you a lot of tea, and it's not too sweet. If you have trouble handling spicy, the tea is a great companion with your meal. \\n- I really need to try the moo ping, mango sticky rice, and som tom eventually..

The Chicharron de Pollo is listed as Puerto Rican Fried chicken pieces.  \\"Pieces\\" is right. It was just chunks of dry over cooked and poorly seasoned chicken served with  flavorless rice and beans. The Chagos Pernil Asado is slow roasted pulled pork with pigeon peas rice and a side salad. The pork was under seasoned and had an odd texture to it, and rice was merely ok. The Puerto Rican Paella was the unanimous winner at our table.

My girlfriend's eggs (Irish Eggs Bennie) which she'd ordered over medium were over very easy (runny), the orange juice was sub-standard plastic-jug stuff, and my pancakes were just, alas, terrible.  WAY too much baking soda in the batter, so they both tasted like baking soda and had that weird chewy texture I associate with the first time or two I tried to make pancakes when I was like 8, before I learned how to do it right.\\n\\nOn the bright side the corned beef hash was fine (and the server asked if I wanted it crispy, so points for that) but it was just cooked hash from a can.  They apparently use a lot of prefab stuff (we saw the can of country time lemonade on the shelf for instance), which would be fine except that they aren't exactly cheap either.\\n\\nBetween the two of us breakfast was $25.  That was thrown into starker relief by the fact that I recently got back from a business trip where I ate at a Cracker Barrel and had a VASTLY superior meal (hashbrown casserole, fried apples, flaky biscuits, fresh squeezed OJ, good coffee) for $10.

The pulled pork is tender and moist with plenty of smoked-in hickory flavor. The ribs were meaty, smoky, and moist though  they could have been a tad more of the latter. I prefer hot BBQ sauce and theirs has good bite to it although I did add some Tabasco, but it didn't need much. The sauce cooked on the ribs also had lots o' tangy-and-hot goodness to it. Now, the sides. Redbone's mac & cheese is excellent. The mashed potatoes are pretty good. Not great but they do the job. I'd like to see them cook the collard greens a tad longer but their recipe is tasty. I'd also like to see some pickled pepper juice available so the collards can be eaten as God intended. Cornbread was good. I'm not a fan of sweetened cornbread, and while theirs is sweetened, it is less so than most. In the absence of skillet cornbread, it does just fine--moist, flavorful, a smooth texture (not grainy or mealy, as with some cornbreads). And the banana pudding is the real thing! Made from scratch, not Jell-o pudding. Our waiter was extremely nice, very helpful, and efficient to boot. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable with lots of sweet soul music.

Alongside was a dipping sauce for the tempura. The wasabi was, strangely, a vibrant mint green. The filling of the potstickers was grey. I have no idea what it was, but it was a tasteless, grey mush. The dipping sauce was brown and tasted like slightly salted water. Puzzled, I asked both waitresses and the waiter what was in the tempura dipping sauce, but none of them knew! The chicken teriyaki was cool to the touch on one side, so maybe their cooking temperatures should be checked out by the local health department. After nibbling and pushing everything around on the plate, I couldn't stomach trying the California Roll.

We tried out the new Oak Long Bar today for lunch arriving about 11.50a (they open at 11.30a). The new menu is short, the flatbreads, a couple of salads, some heavier appetizers like chowder, then a hamburger with fries, a bacon/cheese/tomato sandwich with fries, a halibut entree. We both got the bacon/cheese/tomato sandwiches with iced tea and a sparkling water. Then we waited...there were at just after noon 27 people sitting at 8 tables and two positions at the bar. While there seemed to be a lot of staff (we counted at least 10) scurrying around there was certainly not much coming out to the customers. A bistro table next to us hadn't been set with place-settings: one woman came by and gave it a token wipe (leaving circular cup and glass stains on the table) then put down napkin and utensils. Five minutes later another woman came by and cleared the table..figure that one out. Our two sandwiches came out about 20 min with a quick apology...they were both too tall to eat simply but the bacon was good, the gouda cheese was good, the artisanal bread was good but nothing was great. We were offered one refill on the iced tea, then left alone, alone and alone. It is not a place which trains staff to look out for tables which are not theirs apparently. We did ask a waitress to get our check, then had to ask yet another one to take it up. She walked with the payment and my credit card in hand around the restaurant for almost five minutes talking to other staff: either many of the swipe card machines were not working or she did not have access--we finally saw her get a card from a maitre d' after which she brought the check. Two sandwiches, iced tea, sparkling water, tax and 10% tip was $61. Meh. The volume in the place was ok when we were there, but, yes, the floor is now all tile and wood so I imagine if it's full you've got a full din. The new logo is perplexing too...you see an A and a K in loopy script sort of but it's small and hard to read (both on the outside awnings and on jacket lapels). Eventually you can get the O from the design, but the effect is a weird French-scripted cow branding, certainly nothing elegant or easy to read. We also did not find the seating comfortable: the leather tall chairs at the bar looked nice, but the rest of the place has either deck chairs (leather on the back instead of canvas) or plush cocktail bar type chairs. Either one was deep: if you sat back all the way (by preference or to rest your back) you were way too far from the table and your partner, if you sat forward you were hunched over the bistro table in a cramped position. In all, it's better than the moribund previous Oak Room, glad we tried it out but won't be back any time soon: far too many fun places to drop $61 for lunch elsewhere in the area. BTW, despite the heading info there are two TVs set into mirrors over the bar and they do not take reservations: they have an entry in OpenTable but it doesn't let you book and staff told us they both do not take bookings over the phone and also don't know when they will be taking reservations at all."},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I came here on a very busy Saturday night, after hearing all the good reviews from my friends about this place.

I ordered the Chatfield, which featured fried chicken, bacon, cheese and a tad bit too much apple butter, but I still ate every last crumb. I personally prefer really sharp cheddar cheese, which could have countered some of the extra sweetness from the apple butter. I believe the founders of the restaurant are from North Carolina, so there are some southern style favorites like North Carolina barbeque and fried green tomatoes. The fried green tomatoes are best eaten hot, and since it was my first time ever trying them I have nothing to compare them to, but they were warm and tender inside with a nice crust on the outside- a very nice balance of textures. We also ordered the Reggie, which is a biscuit sandwich with fried chicken, bacon and cheese topped with gravy. The food was filling enough to keep us satisfied from breakfast time to well past lunch. We also ordered half a dozen biscuits to home to share with friends, and got the pimento cheese spread and the marionberry jam.

One thing she added, but \\"its expensive\\"! I said YES, can't wait. \\n\\nIt was our last night in Portland, my daughter set up the reservations on line via Open Table. All the reservations were taken that Sunday night and we had to settle for the 9:30 PM time slot. Which is perfect, since we had some last minute errands to do before we leave the next day. \\n\\nValidated parking is available, its located next to building. We found street parking right across the building so we parked there instead. Portland City Grill is on the 30th floor of the U.S. Bancorp Tower. Head straight to the elevator to the 3oth floor. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we entered the long hallway to get to Portland City Grill, we checked in with the friendly hostess in front and she took us to our table.

She mentioned that I have to try the calamari. Of course I had my mind set on getting the calamari, since my daughter raves about it. \\n\\nSince it was a late dinner reservation, we snacked before our meal. My daughter wanted to get her usual chicken and I told her to get the special, which was their salmon. Since she always eats chicken and that she is starting to love salmon. I told her go for the salmon, since its my treat!!  \\n\\nOur orders : \\nKung Pao Calamari (19.00) Bell Peppers, Spicy Hoisin, & Ginger Sauce. The Calamari tasted like Kung Pao Chicken except you are eating calamari. The calamari tasted so crispy. It is best to eat it right away as it gets soggy. \\n\\nNorthwest Cioppino ( 18.00 x 2) Salmon, Prawns, Scallops, & Calamari in a lobster saffron broth. This dish was just right for me and my other half. Although we had better, this cioppino was mediocre. \\n\\nFire Grilled King Salmon ( 44.00) requested sub for rice, instead of baby carrots and chickpea. This entr√©e came with piece of grilled king salmon, rice, with squash, cauliflower, brussel sprouts & carmelized shallots. My daughter enjoyed her entree except that she didn't care for the vegetables.  \\n\\nFor dessert we tried their lemon cheesecake,  made with Meyer lemon. (9.00) this was really good!! \\n\\nWe really enjoyed our dining experience here, enjoying the last night with my daughter before we say our good-byes and before we leave for Hawaii the next day. \\nI will never forget the precious memories dining here at Portland City Grill. \\n\\n Portland City Grill is Portland's most popular award winning restaurant with unsurpassed views of the city and cascade mountains.

They have a gigantic superstore here, it's beautiful, and has everything you could need in a shopping trip (think toiletries, food, booze, and home goods).   \\n\\nOur first visit was seriously overwhelming as the place was packed and absolute madness Sunday around 6PM.  The regular aisles were fairly empty as the masses were found in the bakery, prepared foods, deli, fish, and charcuterie sections.\\n\\nMost of the prepared foods are very similar to Whole Foods in terms of quality and selection.  The stand outs were the sushi and some of the fish items.  Sushi looked really good on opening day with a lot of different rolls that looked well crafted.  They were even slicing up some octopus sashimi from a whole octopus they had at the sushi counter per a customer's request.  Definitely the most legit sushi I've seen in any supermarket setting.  Fish market had a lot of selection but the fish didn't look great/fresh (I'll stick with Market Basket).  Their jumbo lump crab meat did look great though. They also have a reasonably priced charcuterie section which I'm definitely going to be buying from soon.  Boxes of fresh meat (soppresata, house prosciutto, salami) and cheese were only 5-8$. The bakery was equally impressive featuring small cakes and pies for as little as 6$ and large cakes for 20$.  There was also a large selection of small pastries that all looked very good.\\n\\nDon't skip the craft your own 6 pack in the liquor section!\\n\\nWhere Wegmans succeeds it also fails.  The store has everything you could possibly need but it also takes a long time to make it through the store.  Could you avoid a trip to Market Basket, Whole Foods, and possibly even Target with one trip to Wegmans?  Yes.  But if you just need to go food shopping you're probably going to spend more time than you want to coming here.  \\n\\nAnother weakness we noticed was some ice on the store cream cheese indicating it was previously frozen, and still thawing.  How many other items were frozen and not fresh?  I would guess that a lot of the fish market had been previously frozen by the looks of it but I don't know.\\n\\nAll in all I think the prices are better than Whole Foods and they have a very interesting selection of goods.  You can't write this place off without at least one visit, they just offer too much goodness in one space.  We'll be using them sparingly as an alternative to Whole Foods since they're close by, but for now I'll stick with my cheaper market basket."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Nearly a year after I visited Neptune Oyster, the lobster roll is still haunting my dreams.

We ordered potatoes brava, bimbop bacon and eggs, and their blue fin tuna special.  The potato chunks were cut too big and not crispy at all (not as the server had described).  The sauce was ok but pretty bland.  The bimbop bacon and eggs were good but no better than a bibimbap in an iron bowl from a good Korean restaurant (and 30% higher in cost).

Also a very good appetizer, although it may be a little heavy on the garlic for those sensitive to that sort of thing.\\n\\nTheir beer selection is limited since they're a martini bar, but it includes Hoegaarden, and they serve it in a glass that looks like a bucket and makes you feel like a man, so I'm OK with that. Chicks tell me there is a Pop-Rocks Martini that is one of the best things that ever happened to alcohol for chicks, so I take their word on that. Give that a try.\\n\\nThe decor is also very cozy, comfy, dark, mysterious etc. etc. There's a cool fireplace along the back of the restaurant and it really adds to the feel.\\n\\nBang-for-Buck: 6/10 - 9/10- depending on whether or not you get the $1 burgers"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Coming from the south I have to say that this place is the real deal.

I remember when my small town of 3000ish people had the ability to sustain four different coffee and doughnut shops.  All of them made their own doughnuts.  All of them had an immense variety offering a variety of powdered fruit filled doughnuts (the \\"Jelly\\") along with various cake/yeast doughnuts (plain and glazed), fritters, dutchies, cruellers, etc..  All of them were delicious, however, none of them were on a Food Network doughnut  competition show.  \\n\\nI get the idea of \\"boutique\\" items (boutique everything, really).  However, I can't relate to the idea of boutique doughnuts.  Traditionally speaking, doughnuts are blue collar food.  Being calorie dense confectionery convenience food, doughnuts were typically consumed to sustain the efforts of hard-working, lower-earning people like construction workers and police who can't spare the time to linger in a coffee shop for hours on end and had to eat on the go.  \\n\\nNow, to comments specific to Revolution Doughnuts:\\n\\nThe Good News:\\n\\n- There is a great variety of novel toppings available on their doughnuts.  \\n- The coffee is hot.\\n\\nThe Bad News:\\n\\n- Expensive.  $20 for a dozen regular (read: plain) doughnuts?  The first time I saw that I nearly spit out my coffee.  I know they're using organic ingredients and hiring free-range hipsters, but come on.  \\n- Service is painfully slow.  S. L. O. W.  It's as if they're making each doughnut to order (they're not).  Why does it take so long to pull a doughnut or six from the glass case and give it to the person waiting for their order?  It's even self-serve coffee!  Se we know that's not holding things up.\\n- Revolution lacks of true variety of actual doughnut types.  The variety here comes in the glazes/toppings on top of the doughnuts.  \\n- No Jelly doughnut.\\n\\nThe take-away:  It's just a \\"meh\\" kind of place.  Given all the gushing reviews, I'm not really sure people in Atlanta understand that doughnuts need not be sugary, dense, hockey-puck shaped cakes.

You can just tell when you have ate in many places and order the usual seafood dish. Here- it was phenomenal. When I've been hungry lately, I'm still thinking about how great it was here!

It's packed but I was seated right away at the bar. The couple behind me had an estimated wait of 1 hour, and the restaurant actually had to start turning people away at around 8:30 (by 8:30, the estimated wait was already at 2 hours) because their list was so long that they couldn't fit everybody in before they close. \\n\\nThere were about 12 different oysters to choose from and I chose to have 1 of each. Very fresh oysters - ranges from very high salt to medium salt; creamy to briny; ocean-y to metallic-y. My favorite kind is the medium salt ones that are crisp and fruity. \\n\\nI also ordered the clam chowder. It's definitely made to order, unlike many other places where they just left it in a buffet warmer to keep it warm. The consistency of their chowder is very thin; it actually tasted more like milky seafood broth than chowder, nonetheless, it was still pretty good. However, if I get chowder, im expecting it to me thicker. \\n\\nBecause it's a Tuesday, I ordered the Uni Bucatini. They gave you a decent amount of uni on top of the pasta. However, I could not taste any uni within the pasta or within the sauce. I do not get the point of green peas. I think the pasta could be better executed, maybe blending the uni into the sauce and top with uni. The pasta is soaked in broth-like sauce (again, liquid-y, think sauce), so there is almost no sauce on the Bucatini. When I get pasta, I want sauce on each individual pasta. \\n\\n\\nI would come back again for the oysters and maybe other dishes. The clam chowder and uni Bucatini are more like \\"I tried it\\" kind of dish."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My family and I really enjoyed our visit to Scampo.

Different than my Thai Bloom stand-by, it had pieces of chicken, not ground like I'm used to.  Rice was perfect,  not gummy at all,  which is rare for take-out.

Couldn't taste the crab at all and the wonton wrapper was thick and chewy, barely crisp. Tasted like a salty, gluey glob of cream cheese and onions.

I didn't understand her so I proceeded to go get my fountain drink. When I was returning to the counter to get my order she and who I thought was the busser were joking about my situation ..they had been caught so the guy rolled his eyes and awkwardly walked away. It was embarrassing I told them it's unprofessional to speak of customers in that setting. The other girl who gave me my food heard me and was attempting to offer up an explanation on why I was still being charged full price for an additional side .. What I was charged and what they were saying didn't make any sense and I was a little embarrassed already that staff thought it was appropriate to discuss and cackle at my lack of understanding. I left and contacted the restaurant because I was then missing items from my order .. The manager instead of apologizing made excuses and blamed me in saying \\"I was trying to help but you just left\\" I explained to him the situation had been going on for 10 minutes and that I was embarrassed already and was not gonna stand there and feel like some dumb ass .. Ultimately instead of rectifying the situation the manager hung up on me. I contacted corporate and no one called me back. I will return to city b in the future possibly But never this location.

I showed up with a friend from high school, and we were taken care of exceptionally well by our waitress, who brought out a plethora of increasingly spicy concoctions in order to challenge my friend's impervious palate, including a free order of the atomic relish. But the pulled pork and Memphis ribs were both of disappointing consistency - overcooked and stringy, leaving both of us hunting for toothpicks. The meat was only lukewarm when it arrived, a far cry away from being toasty and melting off the bone as good barbecue ought to. The portions of sauce provided were stingy, though our waitress was willing to bring whatever we wanted on request. The beans were equally disappointing, bland to the point of being flavorless. Indeed, the tastiest thing there was their cornbread and their delicious lemonade and sweet tea, served in Mason jars. Their sauces are pretty good as well, in particular the jerk, though not advisable for the faint of heart. If I eat a single delicious meat dish in future then I will up the rating to 4 stars simply because of how much fun it was to be there, and given that it's a ten minute walk from my house I'm sure I'll be back to give it another shot. But the mediocrity of the meat prevents it from going any higher right now.\\n\\nAs far as Boston-area barbecue places go, my vote goes to Smoken Joe's in Brighton, though I'm clearly biased since its owners live downstairs and used to give us dishes to try out when they were about to open. I also remember Blue Ribbon being almost as good, though I haven't tried it in a few years."},{"name":"Chago's Caribbean Cuisine","address":"7301 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Once again with the wonderful experience.

We got the check promptly and were cashed out in a timely manner. Overall I was just disappointed in the whole experience as I was the last time I ate here. This place has potential but I feel most of the staff are just complacent because they know they work at a popular spot and have just slacked off on their jobs.

We ordered the clam chowder for $11 frankly I thought it wasn't the greatest but there were plump pieces of clams all over, the only thing I didnt like was the celery I thought it gave it a strange taste. They had probably the best list of oysters I've seen so far with 12 different types and I liked how they described each one with size, salt level and the finish. We ordered a pair of WellFleet, Katama Bay, East Beach Blonde, Tatamgouche, Summerside and Ninigret. All were delicious but three of the most memorable in terms of taste were the WellFleet - sweet butter finish, Summerside of cos from Malpeque PEI with a nutty finish and Ninigret - a sweet pea finish. The oysters were $2.40-2.90 a pop but it was well worth it. We were not feeling full for obvious reason but we had an early dinner planned so we wanted something light - the waiter recommended the fried oysters with white sardines salad - it was interesting with a sweet finish.

I made reservations on the day of around 7:30, which looking back it's crazy that I was able to get a table because when we arrived there was a huge lineup at the door. The restaurant is quite spacious; I think there was ventilation above every table, although our vents weren't working. I found the sauce department to be very lacking. You make your own sauce at this little trolley in the middle of the restaurant. There's only soy sauce, a peanut sauce, chili oil/sauce, and a satay sauce. You have to pay extra for anything extra, like cilantro, sesame oil or green onion. There are also only two types of soup broths, the original or spicy. You can also do half half. The peppercorns in the spicy broth give you a slightly disturbing numbing tingly feeling. Over halfway into our meal we couldn't handle the flavors of the spicy broth anymore and dumped all our food into the original. The food item selection is not bad, but as with most hot pot places, sometimes you don't know how much (or little) you will get. We tried ordering multiple orders of noodles or vegetables and they would only show up in one portion (or not at all). It's pretty annoying, but I find this to be pretty par for the course at most hot pot establishments. Surprisingly, I found the service to be quite good. I had read previous reviews and was expecting curt and huffy servers but the ones we encountered were actually quite nice. Our drinks were refilled regularly and they even asked if we wanted more food. I didn't feel pressured to hurry up and eat despite the lineup of people outside waiting to get a table. \\n\\nOverall, I've probably had better hot pot elsewhere, including the comfort of my own home, but Little Sheep is a decent place to go in the Burnaby area when you get the craving."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent place to eat after midnight.

It's relaxing to see the geese and dogs walking around, a very peaceful place. Or if you're from a bubble like me (Orange County), you'll be easily amused by \\"Germantown\\" and the brick buildings.\\n\\nIf you plan on coming for a date, note that there is loud music and lots of TVs - not very conducive for conversation, unless yelling is your thing. \\n\\nThe environment is extremely friendly, lots of energy. I would recommend this cafe for a guy's night out or for a family meal. Very chill place, great ambiance, great food. I would not recommend going with a group of 6 or more simply because of the wait.\\n\\nA detailed description would not do justice to the goodness you will experience at Thurman, but here's my attempt: The burger itself is about 7 inches tall - it was held together by 4 sticks. The order? Top bun, few layers of ham, 3/4 lb patty, sauteed onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, bottom bun. The burger was cut in half - two sticks were arranged in an \\"X\\" shape to hold both sides together, and two sticks were stuck straight down to hold the burger in place. Maybe you'll be able to pick it up and eat it like you would a normal hamburger, but I had to use the hands/fork-and-knife hybrid approach. My first bite was an attempt to get everything in one bite - it was pretty successful, but I knew I could not do that for the whole burger without making such that it would distract me from the burger. I took the top bun off with the ham and placed it to the side. Then, I cut a piece of the patty, took some lettuce, onions, and mushrooms, used a fork to eat it, then picked up the top of the bun and the ham and ate it with my hand - ladies and gentlemen, behold, the hybrid approach. The taste of the mixture made so much sense and I think I found myself in that burger. Life made sense to me. What stuck out to me was the meat quality - the beef did not taste or feel greasy at all! It was not over-seasoned and cooked to the perfect temperature. The ham made such a nice, simple, subtle complement. The complement of the crunchiness of the lettuce, onions, and shrooms to the patty make peanut butter and jelly feel like estranged acquaintances. I think I'm going to start putting ham in my burgers from now on.\\n\\nOverall, great establishment, great food!!

For the life of me I can't understand why this place gets such rave reviews; it's mediocre at best.  I consider myself an Indian food junkie, and if you are looking for traditional Indian cuisine, you couldn't be more disappointed had you walked into Kell's Irish Pub by mistake - they do have the Dublin Chicken Curry after all, and you'd save a pretty penny!\\n\\nSeriously though, \\"Vindalho\\" (presumably replacing the 1st \\"o\\" from the commonly accepted \\"vindaloo\\" with an \\"h\\" lends this place the cache required to charge an extra couple bucks per dish) describes itself as a \\"modern interpretation of heirloom recipes from the Indian subcontinent\\"...uhh, yeah like onion rings, flatiron steaks, and PORK vindalho.  I mean, on some of their dishes I guess their description is accurate...as long as you remember the words \\"modern interpretation\\" comes before the phrase \\"recipes from the Indian subcontinent\\".\\n\\nSo, let's just all agree that Vindalho is NOT authentic Indian cuisine, but rather some Pac-NW/Indian fusion.  This in and of itself is not a bad thing; not unlike the Asian-Fusion craze that seemed so big about a decade ago.  Honestly, many of the spices and ingredients of Indian food would work well in non-traditional dishes, but Vindalho manages to bungle even that by deleting most of the subtleties of flavor in the translation to \\"modern\\".  And they completely waste one of the traditional strengths of Indian cuisine by offering only TWO vegetarian entrees; that's very disappointing, and will leave non-carnivores with very few options on the menu.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, much of what we ordered was poorly executed at best.  The chicken ended up tough, leathery, and stringy - that's just unacceptable no matter what type of cuisine you're aiming for.  The stir-fried seasonal vegetables were overcooked, limp, and mostly flavorless - there was nothing even remotely Indian tasting about them, \\"modernly interepreted\\" or otherwise.\\n\\nThe samosas were actually the best thing we had, filled with tender, mildly spiced potatoes wrapped in a crisp, salty shell; though I would have stuck with the traditional peas rather than corn.\\n\\nInside Vindalho goes for that industrial-chic decor that seems all the rage at many newer restaurants in town. Large, open, and undivided seating areas with high ceilings and huge windows dominate the main floor of the restaurant, with a smaller mezzanine overlooking the rest of the space. Full of hard surfaces and industrial-grade materials, the place is quite loud - we were seated upstairs in the mezzanine which did nothing to shield us from the constant background white noise of the place, though with about a third of the tables as on the main floor, there are fewer people to avoid bumping elbows with\\n\\nThe colors are pleasant with a sort of avocado green contrasting nicely with touches of vibrant orange. Overall the style is visually appealing, though when it comes down to it I prefer more traditional designs that offer at least a modicum of privacy and allow for a more personal dining experience.\\n\\nFinally the prices.  I expected items to be a bit more spendy given the \\"gourmet\\" crowd they're shooting for, but even if the food had been good it would barely have been worth the scratch they're asking.  It would be very hard to walk out of there spending less than $25 per person if you give a decent tip, especially when considering they charge $14 for the cheapest entree (the aforementioned veggie stir-fry), almost $20 for the lamb boti kebab, and an average price of over $8 for each of the starters.  So within the \\"Yelp\\" guidelines, they qualify for 2 $$ ($11-30 per person), but only just barely.\\n\\nDon't even get me started on the fact that they charge $2 PER chutney, and don't include naan with anything.  Come on, it's bread for god's sake!  But then again, it's not like the curries are so delicious you'll need the naan to scoop up every last bit.\\n\\nIf you want authentic Indian cuisine, go elsewhere and save a ton of money.  If you still want Indian, but want to go upscale, head over to the Bombay Cricket Club.  If you couldn't care less about Indian food, but just want a good dinner... well you'll be alright with the menu, but disappointed with execution.\\n\\nThe only reason Vindalho avoided getting my first ever 1* rating is that our server was very good, and I'm willing to give them that 2nd* for at least the intriguing idea of melding European and Indian cuisine."},{"name":"The Chef's Pantry","address":"322 Alexander St","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food!

I'm from Portland, Maine but lived in Chicago for over two years, so I have a good basis for comparison of high-end restaurants in very urban areas and small cities. I'm also a communist, so I was annoyed by the reviewers who felt privileged and personally snubbed by Barcelona's waitstaff (I doubt very much that they have any person investment in making you miserable, but that's just my opinion). Okay. \\n\\nI went to Barcelona last night, around 9pm, for dinner. The waitress was friendly and helpful, especially when we asked her if she thought ordering some tapas and sharing a meal would be enough food - she was also helpful in picking out a bottle of wine with us that would go with what we ordered. It was busy when we got there, but people trickled out as it got later. We were never in need of more service than we were given, and everything from the food to the service to the ambiance was really sweet. \\n\\nThe interior reminds me of restaurants in both Portland and Chicago in that the exposed brick is very New England and/or urban. It almost seems like Barcelona is in a vortex, because I've never been anywhere else in Cbus that make me feel like I wasn't still in Cowtown... We had wanted to sit on the patio, which is just gorgeous, but when we arrived, there was an hour wait, so maybe next time - I'll definitely be taking other friends here - and by then it will be a bit warmer out, too. \\n\\nMy first thought about the food was that I liked it better than Lindey's, which I recently tried (and which was excellent). We ordered the olives, the quail eggs with bread and onion hash, and shared the pork chop stuffed with chorizzo and covered with bacon and cranberries, which came with oven roasted potatoes. HELLO? Delicious, everything, esp. the pork chop. It was really nice to share everything, as well, as I wouldn't have chosen a quail egg by myself! \\n\\nI am certainly not saying that the complaining reviews were unfounded, but I didn't have any problems with service or food at all here. The only thing I didn't like was the annoying yuppie-types (including stripper-esque MILFS) who remind me of Lincoln Park trixies in Chicago; I could just personally do without that whole crowd - you know the ones, who probably used to hang out in the Arena District when they were a bit younger, or worse, who still do.

I personally didn¬¥t care much for it (too earthy, similar to truffle, but too much), but other people in my group seemed to like it.

It was a raining night, but the hospitality inside was warm and made us not care it was pouring raining during our Florida vacation for the 2nd night in a row. It was expected to rain at least another 3 hours and we decide to spend that time eating. My brother ordered a full lobster- the chef cracked it all open prior to it being served. My brother devoured the lobster, said it was perfectly cooked. I had tasted it and agreed. My sister-in-law and I had the scallops- I prefer mine more cooked than she does - again the chef cooked them perfectly as we had ordered them. My honey had the NY strip and said \\"I love it\\"! He also said he felt the portion was generous.  As a table we also tried the lobster bisque, the mashed potatoes and the Brussel sprouts. My sister-in-law was also celebrating her birthday and had a Disney bday pin on. Our server noticed and delivered to the table a complimentary desert almond crusted cheesecake for us to share!  We ordered another one, along with the creme br√ªl√©e - all were delicious. All their drinks were generously poured. We had a wonderful server. I wished I could remember her name. I do remember she was from Morocco though. Her service was 5star.  The only reason I gave an overall 4 star was due to the loudness where we sat. We sat directly behind the hostess stand and it was slightly annoying to have several people soooo close to the table. It was 5:10pm when we arrived with reservations and the restaurant was barely 1/3 full. We should have been given a better table. Yes, we could have asked for another table, as more people came in and it got louder, but at that point didn't want the fuss. While at Disney if you are torn between Narcoosee's or the California Grill on top of the Contemporary Hotel, do Narcoosee's. Much better chef, especially at a price comparison. The California Grill has the view going for it, but your tummy and wallet will like Narcoosee's better!

Because we're major procrastinators, we waited until about 3:00 to try to get reservations for dinner in the evening, but they didn't have anything available until about 9:00. The person on the phone assured me that getting either a walk-in table or a seat at the bar wouldn't be a problem if we arrived before 6 though. Sure enough, we were able to walk right up to the bar, which actually worked out perfectly, because we got happy hour specials, and we were able to sample several appetizers, instead of feeling obligated to get an entree. We ended up having oysters, a cheese plate, the foie gras torchon, and roasted marrow bones.\\n\\nThey had several varieties of oysters, and the bartender was very knowledgeable about the the differences in size and taste. Because we're incredibly indecisive, we got several of each, and all were quite good. The cheese plate had an excellent variety, and included several raw cheeses (one cow and one sheep), which you don't find in restaurants very often. The foie gras was of course deliciously rich and creamy, and a ridiculously generous portion. There was probably more there than two people should eat, but it was so good that we couldn't help but finish it off. I think the most interesting dish though was the marrow bones. They came on a large rosemary flatbread covered in garlic and mushrooms, and various other stuff that I don't remember. The flatbread kind of seemed like a cross between a pita and a tortilla, and as you were eating the marrow, the bread would absorb the drippings, leaving you with a plate full of marrow-soaked flatbread to finish off. We also had a couple cocktails each, and all were very good.\\n\\nThis definitely isn't a place to go to all the time-it's extremely decadent, and I don't want to think about all the calories and cholesterol I consumed that night.

Maybe this was the problem and we should've just gotten a reheated slice?\\n\\nThe pizza was finished reasonably fast, but the first slice we tried, the toppings & cheese slid right off and the crust had a little cardboard feel to it. By the time we got home, the toppings stayed on but the pizza took on more of a rubbery feel. Personally, I don't like this kind of pizza. The toppings did taste decent though, so if you're not picky about crusts, then maybe this will be just fine for you.\\n\\nIf you're itching for a quick slice of pizza on Newbury, then you could do worse than here, but if you have time, I'd seek out an Otto's or head to Picco or Scoozi or even Sonsie for pizza."},{"name":"Margarita Factory - Downtown Vancouver","address":"1004 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Our go to Mexican place.

It did not disappoint!\\n\\nThe restaurant is located just off the monorail, within the Grand Floridian resort.  And it is just that...grand.  We were on the dining plan and arrived an hour before our reservation in hopes of scoring one of the premier window seats.  The hostess, Brittany, was wonderful.  We were actually seated 10 minutes early and had amazing seats that overlooked the water.  Because of my tomato allergy, the chef came over to talk with us and spend a good deal of time talking to us about food in general.  Then we were greeted by our server, who was cheerful and welcoming.   Good start!\\n\\nNarcoossee is two credits pp on the DDP but they allow for you to order anything on the menu and a dessert per person.  We chose not to add any appetizers because our planned meals would be filling and we wanted to be able to finish them.  Therefore, we began with the bread and I ordered a glass of wine.  The bread was a full loaf!  It was hot, fresh and served with two butter choices; unsalted and seat salted.  I opted for the unsalted but my mom went with the salted.  We both enjoyed them equally.\\n\\nThen came dinner.  I had ordered the Filet and Lobster.  It was accompanied by whipped potatoes and string beans.  The Filet rested in a red wine reduction.  \\n\\nI had been thinking about this dinner for over a year, so I was a bit concerned that I had built it up in my head and would end up disappointed.  Additionally, I had read some unfavorable reviews about the same meal which worried me a little as well.  All worries were for not; as soon as I saw my plate, I knew it was going to be amazing.\\n\\nThe lobster, which I ordered butter poached, was extremely fresh and melted in my mouth.  It was simply delicious.  The filet was cooked perfectly to my order and also melted in my mouth.  The reduction was a perfect pairing, especially with my Pinot Noir.  The meal was rounded out with creamy whipped potatoes and green beans cooked exactly how I like them, a bit on the al dente side.\\n\\nI was sad when this meal was over because it was one of the best I ever had.  I enjoyed every single bite.  I could only be so sad for so long though, as next up was my amazing strawberry shortcake dessert and french pressed coffee.  It was a delicious end to a perfect meal.  \\n\\nAs a bonus, we were able to go out to the deck and watch the Wishes fireworks.  We had seen them at another restaurant and once in MK, but this was by far the best viewing.  \\n\\nIf you are visiting Disney, I highly recommend this place.  I would also suggest you go at a time when you can view the Wishes.  The staff was great, the food was amazing and I will definitely visit again if I get back to Disney.

Remembering that the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Garlic Naan at the original location were very good (don't know if it still is, this was 1.5 years ago), I ordered the same. My friend got the potato naan.\\n\\nWe found a table and sat down, the restaurant was half empty, with about 4 servers - give about 2 tables per server. Nobody came with a water or silverware. After considerable time I went where the food was being picked up to get some water & cutlery of my own. Service here is nothing to speak about. The place seems confused between a self service fast casual joint, where they only deliver your food and a full service restaurant, but remember you need to order at the counter.\\n\\nThe food itself was nothing great to speak about. The Chicken Tikka Masala was okay, the garlic naan, a fluffy, aromatic , garlicky piece of cooked dough in the RR location was nothing but an ordinary naan, with some garlic thrown on top as a garnish. My friend who landed from India a month ago, didn't think much of the potato naan or aloo paratha as we call it. Whilst the naans where huge, the curry itself was a much smaller considering an average of $9-10 you pay for it. When I was a student, I would always expect to make 2 meals out of a $10 entree, no such luck here.\\n\\nDon't go out of your way to visit this place, there are better fast casual Indian places like Tarka or Masala Wok.

We arrived shortly after 11 AM and had the restaurant to ourselves until about 11:30 AM. The menu had many more options than I expected. We started with the Mexican egg rolls which were fantastic with just the right amount of spice. For lunch, I had the Fit Chick which consisted of a perfectly spiced and grilled chicken breast with broccoli and Spanish rice. Our food came out fairly quickly and the server was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant has a large outdoor seating area if you choose to brave the Texas heat.

Before that I would have said Mighty Fine or Dan's but anyway story goes that my best friend and I were looking for something new and she said that Yelp reviews are raving about this place called Lebowski's grill. I never heard of it. I look up the address and tell her \\"umm, this says Highland Lanes bowling alley\\"...we kept reading the reviews with skepticism but decided what the hell, let's try this. \\n\\nWalk in to the left and see this little counter and around that corner a nice cozy seating area inside this nostalgically old school bowling alley. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, my friend the patty melt both with fries. As I was looking to get my son a high chair I saw him put fresh(not frozen) patties on the grill, as I walk back I see him put these amazing looking strips of bacon on the grill, I mean this burger looked good before it was cooked. \\n\\nThe guy who made the burger as super friendly, humble and gave us free drinks for my birthday and later on delivered the food to our table. My burger was f'n heaven. I mean, dang, the bread was perfect, toasted slightly on the inside to perfection. I'm having trouble right now because I'm like drooling. Flavor enters your mouth and fills it. I moaned during the first few bites. Anyway, it was so good I gave the guy an extra tip at the end of the meal. \\n\\nNo more driving to Dan's(thank you Dans for being my favorite for a long time!), waiting 2 hours at Hopdoddys(you were good but not that good) or shelling out $$$ at Mighty Fine(yeah, if Lebowski's ain't open), I have found my new burger, my new love. I towards the end of the meal I realized that I didn't need salt for the fries like I usually do at other burger joints. My 3 year old son who is super picky about food, loved the burger and fries. Anyway, I feel like this should be kept a secret but I'm going to share this for my fellow burger lovers to enjoy. Whew, long review. \\n\\nI moved to Austin in 1986 and have tried all burgers in town, Sandys, Dans, Hopdoddys, Hilberts, Mighty Fine, Pterrys, Frans, Casino El Camino....this one just shot them out of the water. I'll see you soon Lebowski's grill!

I was disappointed that it does not offer good options for vegans or vegetarians who don't want their food smothered in cheese and butter at every turn.  A few notes:\\n\\n1) My first impression walking in was that the place is dirty.  The floors are gross and they don't appear to have anyone doing any kind of cleanup maintenance among the tables.  \\n\\n2) You need a \\"code\\" to get into the three unisex, single-occupancy bathrooms and two of the three stalls were broken.  I was in line for forever (and this wasn't even peak hours) as everyone had to use the middle one. I heard two workers talking about how the first and third doors just showed that they were occupied all the time (but were we supposed to break in?).  Needless to say, the one bathroom was dirty. \\n\\n3) I ordered the spinach quinoa salad that promised also tofu and edamame.  While it tasted good (yeah!) and the ingredients were fresh, they were skimpy on the expensive ingredients that really \\"make\\" the salad (the tofu and edamame).  I counted only 4 tofu chunks. Disappointing.\\n\\n4)  There is no soup and salad combo option; again, another strike against those seeking a healthy option. \\n\\nBoston seems to have a pretty poor selection of healthy restaurants (at least that is what other yelpers say), so perhaps this is the best they can offer.  In that case, my food was fine and it is a good concept (especially for those who like lamb and bacon).  I would probably return to this location if there weren't better options.

The woman who served us was pretty friendly, and although she didn't say too much, she did treat us pretty well and keep my drink pretty topped up.\\n\\nWe got the Chagos Pernil Asado and the El Jibarito sandwich, both of which had the same marinated, super juicy and delicious pork. The El Jibarito sandwich was really interesting too, since it uses mashed plantain instead of the bread and American Swiss cheese plus a side of arroz con gandules. For reference, arroz con gandules is rice with pigeon peas, not literally only pigeon peas but still pretty good, and it as the side on both of our dishes. Also, the Chagos Pernil Asado included a salad with sauce, and upon adding the sauce to the salad we noticed it didn't taste like a standard salad sauce we'd had before (it was different, and really good!).\\n\\nI love it already. It might be one of my new favorite Austin restaurants.\\n\\nNext time I'd like to try the Mofongo since that's also a pretty typical Puerto Rican dish, as well as the Cuban sandwich (only because I love cuban sandwiches).

This time they suggested Tasty n Alder, and I've gotta say, it's now one of my favorite restaurants of all time!  \\n\\nWe didn't have reservations, so we walked over from our hotel and put our name on the list.  They informed us of a wait of 30-40 minutes, took down my cell phone number, and we headed out to walk around the neighborhood while we waited.  Maybe 15 minutes later, our table was ready and they called us.  Our friends hadn't met up with us yet, but they sat us anyway.  \\n\\nOnce seated, the wife and I ordered a drink and an appetizer for all of us to share.  Once our friends arrived, we went over the menu, and with the help of our server, made the rest of our selections.  During that time, our first item had arrived, which was the Smoked Trout & Accoutrements ($13).  The trout was just as good smoked salmon in its own, unique way.  While hot smoked, it wasn't hard or tough at all.  It was accompanied by some whole grain bread, soft boiled egg and roasted beets. \\n \\nNext up was the Goat Cheese Dumplings Arabiata ($15).  These dumplings were more like goat cheese gnudi that melts in your mouth, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and swimming in a zesty tomato sauce.  The grilled bread that accompanied was really tasty and was great sopping up the sauce. \\n \\nOur third course was a no-brainer to me - Chanterelle & Squash Orzo Risotto ($15). Chanterelles are among my favorite mushrooms, and while I prefer rice based risottos, this was very flavorful, light and seasonal.  Loved it.\\n \\nThe next dish is really a side, but I had to try it when I saw it - Duck Duck Potatoes ($8).  As you may have guessed by the name, these were potatoes fried in duck fat and topped with a fried duck egg!  What isn't there to like about potatoes cooked in duck fat with a runny duck egg on top?!\\n \\nOur fifth dish was a challenge to eat splitting 4 ways - Baja Tacos ($18).  Halibut, apple avocado sauce, escabeche. Admittedly, I wasn't really looking forward to this one since I don't like fish tacos, but this changed my mind!  The halibut was perfectly crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside, and the whole thing was so full of fresh flavors and so well balanced... I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. \\n \\nOur 2nd to the last course was the Wagyu Skirt Steak from Snake River Farms ($22).  The steak was served with a side of chimichurri and was cut for family style sharing.  It was well seasoned and perfectly cooked to medium rare.  While there were more expensive wagyu options, I'm not really a fan of super fatty wagyu steaks, so this one was a perfect balance for me and plenty tender. \\n \\nOur last course was by far the most memorable one - Cedar Plank Salmon ($29).  We weren't told what was on the salmon since it was a chef's choice creation, but man was it good!  I'm not generally a fan of cooked salmon, as many I've had weren't so good.  But this was cooked to a perfect medium/medium-rare.  The herb/green blend on top married well with the fish and smokiness from the cedar, and just look at that caramelization!  This was hands down of my my favorite dishes of the entire trip and a real eye opener for me.  It's now a must whenever we return to this restaurant. \\n \\nSo, despite the large quantity of food earlier, we still had dessert, which was perfectly proportioned for us - Chocolate Potato Donuts with Creme Anglaise.  These were by far the best chocolate donuts I've ever had.  If I wasn't so full, I probably would have wanted an entire plate to myself!  The sauce really helped to balance out the entire dish too and is a definite order again. \\n \\nIn all, Tasty n Alder was an amazing meal with incredible company.  It is the quintessential Portland restaurant I was looking for serving uniquely Pacific Northwest cuisine done to an extremely high level of precision.  The price wasn't too bad either given the quality of food and service.  But, don't think this place is a great romantic date night... Between the crowds and the open kitchen, it has a lively atmosphere, but is an excellent restaurant and is conveniently located.  It's also worth noting that all dishes are ala carte; no starches served with the fish, steaks, etc. and are all meant for sharing.  So bring a group so you can sample more items! \\n\\nWhen in Portland you MUST visit Tasty n Alder!"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"There was a little wait when we arrived.

Walking in, the place is cramped but beautiful.  A long bar stretches the whole place, with marble table tops, and nicely patterned tiles on the floor.  We were told it was a 50 minute wait by the hostess, so we went and bought dessert for after.  About 40 minutes later, we got the call that our table was ready.  The couple we were seated next to weren't really friendly, but not that annoying either.  Our server was very effective, although she could've been better in some regards.  For instance, not checking in with us for awhile when I would've liked to order a glass of wine, acting unpleased when we asked for bread and then only dropping off only 2 small slices, etc.  Nothing earth shattering, just little things that are memorable.  At the end of the day none of these other things matter though, as it's all about the food and in this regard Neptune delivered.  This was easily one of the best meals I've had all year.\\n\\nTo start we had 3 kinds of oysters: 2 Kumamoto, 2 Beau Soleil, and 2 Island Creek.  I wanted to do sea urchins too, but unfortunately the table before us got them all (bastards).  The Kumamoto weren't as tart as I had remembered and were actually a little small, but the Beau Soleil were buttery and much better than I had remembered.  The clear winner though was the Island Creek, which had an acidic fruitiness to them and which are from nearby in Duxbury, MA.  I came close to ordering more, but we had more than enough food coming.  Next up were some steamed Wellfleet Littlenecks.  I found the clams to be a little bit tougher than I expected, but all the right flavors were there.  The roasted garlic sauce they were in was drinkable, and the chorizo added in was crazy good.  The bread our waitress reluctantly brought was good on its own, and was perfect for soaking up some clam juice.  I had the North End Cioppino with lobster added for my main course, and it was superb.  Think big chunks of lobster, different kinds of fish, whole shrimp, mussels and clams all together in a spicy stew with some great saffron rice.  Heaven, right?  Damn straight.  My girl got the seared Georges Bank scallops, which were rich and velvety with a nice crispness on the outside.  I was confused that this delicate shellfish was paired with duck confit and a very sharp blue cheese (Maytag) on the plate though, as it detracted from the dish significantly; this is a great example of a great chef trying to do too much.  On the other hand, the miniature brussel sprouts it came with were absolutely addictive.  The dish would've been pretty complete with just the scallops, sprouts, and 1-2 other not-so-overwhelming elements.\\n\\nSo my first trip to Boston wasn't too bad after all!  Small missteps aside, this meal was pretty epic.  Considering dessert afterwards--a combo of stuff from Mike's and Modern Pastry--epic is the right word.  I am very glad we chose to go here instead of Union Oyster House and chose to wait for a table.  To those complain about price or the space, you knew what you were getting into when you walked in, and to those comparing lobster rolls, you sound like me with pizza.  I don't have the experience to say where Neptune stacks up in that competition, but they do put out inventive, amazing food.

Basically, he'd interview a celebrity but ask them non-questions (\\"Do you remember when you were in The Beatles?\\" to Paul McCartney). Whenever he'd mess up during the interview, he'd slap his  head really hard and yell, \\"STUPID! STUPID!\\" That's exactly how I feel right now when I realized that I had been eating at Tibby's for over a year now and haven't reviewed it yet.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I've been eating at Tibby's for various dinners and brunches for a while now at both locations. I visited New Orleans once when I was a teenager, so I'm not sure if I'm really an expert regarding authentic Cajun food, but what Tibby's serves seems about right. I usually get a half po boy and a side. You can get a full sized po boy if you want, but one half is pretty gigantic on its own, so you could save the other half for lunch or something. I recommend Walter's Spicy Southern Club Po Boy and the Cajun Sausage Po Boy with either dirty rice or andoulle & cheddar grits because if you're going to eat Cajun food, don't get something basic like French fries as your side.\\n\\nEver had fried pickles? No, seriously, they're pretty good. Get some as your appetizer and munch on them while you wait for your main course. The muffuletta spring rolls are also a good starter.\\n\\nIf you're not in the mood for a po boy, I highly recommend the Who Dat Cajun Blackened Chicken. The chicken is delicious and seasoned perfectly and the house made lemon butter sauce that blankets the dish is something that I want on everything from now on. The Cajun Shrimp Pasta and Seafood Gumbo are also great dishes.\\n\\nThe Winter Park location is a little smaller than the Altamonte one but it never feels cramped. The decor is total goofy New Orleans themed stuff (in a good way). The staff are always friendly, and they're very patient when describing Cajun dishes to newbies. Both locations have been pretty busy in the times that I've gone, so take that as a sign that they're doing something right.\\n\\nThe food is amazing, the prices are fair, and the decor is cool. Go.

I'm a recent college graduate, and money is tight. So, in the hopes that the gift card would cover a meal for two, I planned to go for lunch with my boyfriend instead of dinner. The problem: Barcelona only serves lunch on weekdays from 11:30a-2:30p, and our work schedules always prevented us from getting over to German Village in time. I didn't get around to using my gift card until September 2008. \\n\\nDuring my nine month wait, I heard a lot of chatter about the place. Everyone raved about how great it is and told me I just had to sit on the patio. The more people talked, the more excited I became. By the time my lunch date day rolled around, I had researched the layout of the restaurant via internet photos and basically memorized the food menu.\\n\\nI stood in awe at the hostess station, admiring the original art pieces in the corridor, including a bunch of blown glass that may have been a product of Chihuly. We requested a table for two on the patio and were led through the chic interior seating area to a beautiful garden with lush plants a soothing fountain. To my dismay, we were seated right by the patio door, so we endured a lot of scuttling around us as the wait staff catered to the diners. My chair was bumped several times.\\n\\nOur waitress must have been new, otherwise, she was just off her game. She rushed over to us as soon as we sat down and asked for our drink orders. I hadn't had time to review the specialty drinks (which I later found to be intriguing, i.e. basil mojito), so I stuck with my water. Greg ordered a queer tasting ginger ale. His glass ended up being dirty, so when the waitress came back to take our orders, she also took the drink away. Our food was served to us before the drink returned.\\n\\nTo start, I ordered the chilled spiced peach soup, and Greg got his customary Caesar salad. The salad was excellent. The crunchy, salty homemade sourdough croutons really made it. My peach soup...not so much. While the texture wasn't bad, the supposed palette cleanser had a strange flavor that I can't quite identify. Something tells me it was laced with celery seed. With the help of my fresh bread with tomato and olive oil sauce (very good), I managed to choke down half of the soup.\\n\\nGreg's main dish was the day's special: a panko crusted cod sandwich with fries. It was a bit bland, which, in my experience, is typical with fish. I got the farfalle pasta with shrimp, spinach, tomatoes, basil cream, and shaved parmesan. It was good, not great. The portions were very generous. Greg couldn't finish his sandwich, and I ended up taking half of my pasta home.\\n\\nOverall, my Barcelona experience was underwhelming. My expectations might have been too high on this one. The patio was beautiful. The presentation of our dishes was clean. Most of the wait staff was courteous and professional. The manager was very visible in the courtyard and mingled with the guests. Valet parking was complimentary. The atmosphere was utterly great. And while we even covered most of our meal with our gift card, spending a total of $39.50 plus tip, I don't think the food was worth the price."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I came here after hiking and was starving.

It's especially something a lot of Californians like me would travel for, as it's banned in our state.\\n\\nAnywho, be sure to make reservations  a couple weeks in advance, as OpenTable had few seatings left when we were making reservations.

The restaurant had a cute bird theme going on. We decided to split the chatchuterie, which was amazing. I love the variety... but it could have portioned the meats differently.

As for the main dishes, the bf got the infamous Le Pigeon burger and I got the special fish of the day, which was salmon in some basil sauce? I can't quite remember... which just means the food wasn't that memorable, unfortunately. The salmon didn't have much flavor and could have had more potential. On the other hand, my bf claimed his burger was killer delicious.\\n\\nWe opted out on dessert, as the the menu didn't look enticing at all... bummer :( Luckily, the small macarons at the end were satisfying.\\n\\nIn total, without drinks, costed ~$80."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Had dinner here last night .

The bartender asked if we wanted to order more but we said we would continue to wait for a table, when she found out how long we waited we were pretty much sat right away (perhaps a mistake on the hostess station) and she said that the calamari and drinks were on the house and also offered to send a pizza to our table, but we declined.

This ranks in the top 5 of my worst meals I have ever paid for. The good: the appetizers were amazing. We got the bone marrow and beef tartar which tasted fantastic. However, the meal went down hill when it came to the main entree: the duck confit is best described as cheap duck marinated in salt. The main point here is that the dish was bathed in salt; there was no flavor besides salt. I needed a glass of water just to wash down a bite. The second entree we got was the Roasted Pork Shoulder, which once again was only seasoned with salt. It was rather atrocious how much salt covered the cut of pork. The best part was that we could tell by our server - Alison's - look on her face that she realized that we had a problem with the entrees and decided to skip over our issue and only provide us with a check, instead of addressing the problems. Alison is best described as having the most un-hospitable service personality in our dining experience ever. I have never let a review this bad in my dining career.

Trying to be healthy I asked for a double order of seaweed salad with my tuna instead of pasta and it was drenched in butter. I frequently order seaweed salad at Asian restaurants and it is usually crisp clean and healthy this was over cooked in butter, something I have never experienced before . \\n\\nMy 85 year old mother in law asked if it was possible to have her fish without potatoes and a double order of vegetables. She was told that would be no problem. The order came with potatoes . We reminded the waiter that he offered to substitute the potatoes for vegetables and brought an order of vegetables. When the bill arrived we were charged extra for the vegetables . \\n\\nAdding insult to injury we ordered coffee with desert the coffee never came . We waited for a long time and finally went to the manager and asked for the bill. When the waiter eventually showed up he said it would be just a few more minutes for the coffee . We said we only wanted the bill and handed him the valet receipt. He asked us what we wanted him to do with the valet receipt ? I am used to going to professional restaurants where they ask you to give them the valet receipt when you are ready and to act surprised. \\n\\nWhen we finally eft , and when the manager did not help , the waiter told us he did not have the time to give the valet the receipt. \\n\\nWe left $300.

Sure it was a little sparse in terms of people eating here when I was (who takes a 2pm lunch break?!) while I dined, but hey, after the trailer spot and waiting in the heat for my bahn mi, I am a happy clam sitting in the a/c. The view out of the windows has me sadly acknowledging all of the eye sore/sights around (condos across the street, Ruta Maya no longer slinging coffee across the street - RIP Ruta Maya, a strip club, etc etc.), but it doesn't deter me from not getting my bahn mi. \\n\\nAlso - you do know there are maybe 1-2 cooks in the back, at most, making your food, right? One of them is the owner herself, ya punks! Tip the waitress and your cooks - they deserve some positive acknowledgement from your hungry stomach and some appreciation. \\n\\nLulu B's I love you and everything you have to offer me. Keep it real always with your bad self and your picture of Elijah Wood visiting your space. Frodo Baggins knows where to get a damn good (and cheap!) bahn mi in this city."},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I've always really liked Barcelona, but it's never been my go-to for a big dinner. Usually I'm looking for something new and fancy to try, but those days might be coming to an end. I had the most wonderful experience at Barcelona last week, and during 614 Restaurant Week, no less!\\n\\nFirst, I must mention that our server was a total delight. She was very excited, and talked up the entire menu, including the Restaurant Week menu. In my experience, this is unusual, as many times I've ordered from the RW menu and I got the distinct impression that the service is not as attentive as it might have been if I had ordered off the regular menu (cough, Rigsby's, cough). I detected none of that, which pleased me a great deal because the RW menu looked delicious. \\n\\nMy friend and I each decided to order the RW menu. For the first course, I got the Esp√°rragos con Jam√≥n and my friend got the Setas Fritas. Both were good, but his were better. The fritters were lightly fried, and the aioli was a nice compliment. My asparagus was cooked well and the ham was tasty, just not as remarkable as the fritters.\\n\\nOur second courses were Bistec a la Parilla (him) and Camarones (me.) This time, mine was better. The flavors in the shrimp and polenta and onion straws were amazing. And it smelled so good! Just delicious. His Bistec a la Parilla was a good size for a skirt steak and yummy in its own right, but we both liked the shrimp more.\\n\\nFinally, for dessert, he had the Churro Cupcake, and it was good if a little awkward to eat. I ordered the Maple Pecan Blondie, which came with a little ice cream. Yes, yes, yes! It was exactly what I wanted, and a superb finish to a lovely meal. \\n\\nOh! We also ordered a bottle of wine, a rioja, on our server's recommendation, and it was lovely. \\n\\nI am really surprised at myself for not coming to Barcelona more. The service, the atmosphere, the food, the wine--it was all great. This year, my resolution is to eat at Barcelona more often!"},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The service is so so, but it is a busy super cheap pleace.

I went to ICOB my first night and didn't think I could have another lobster roll as good until I hit Neptune my last night and was proved wrong. I ordered the hot version of the roll which has lobster with hot butter as opposed to the alternative of cold margarine. When it arrived, there was extremely generous huge chunks of lobster that were buttery and delightful. Definitely more lobster than ICOB's. Also, where as ICOB'S was more \\"artisan\\", this was more hit the spot soul food. If you want something more fancy, I would recommend ICOB, but if you want down-to-earth pure and delicious good grub, definitely stick to Neptune. Just based on my personal taste, Neptune had exactly what I was looking for in a lobster roll and I would definitely pick this as my go to for rolls in the future. \\n\\nThe one negative is if you are driving, it is literally impossible to find parking. I actually drove to Neptune my first night in Boston but after almost half an hour of circling the neighborhood, I gave up. When I actually ate there, I had to park near the waters, which was a 20 min walk away. The wait time is also ridiculously long even at odd off hours. I went at 2pm and still waited for about half an hour. Also expect to rub elbows with the person sitting on both sides of you because the tables are all communal and the place is extremely small.

I rarely say something like that, but this meal was all-around disappointing. \\nIt was my third visit to Cuatros and almost certainly my last meal there.\\n \\nFirst time I came, I had a veggie burger with sweet potato fries and a drink. The burger was utter mush and the fries not so good, and the service was glacial, but it was right around when they first opened, and the queso and chips, when we got them, were decent, so I didn't write it off.\\n\\nSecond time was just for drinks.

The beans were crusty-looking and sour-tasting, not at all pleasant -- I could only stomach a nibble, and I love black beans like nothing else. The rice was oddly textured, over-seasoned and salted, and just plain not good to me, though he liked his enough to nibble at it. \\n\\nMy entree (the first one) was pretty good, if not incredibly filling -- finely diced squash and cheese were the dominant ingredients, and neither was plentiful -- and the parsley that topped the tacos was wildly out of place. Cilantro would have made much more sense. \\n\\nI saved my second entree (mushroom tacos) for dinner, and it was just gross -- I ended up getting something else to eat because I couldn't try another bite. The 'ubiquitous sauce' is some kind of funky take on thousand island, not even close to good. The mushrooms were cooked to rubbery, and the accompanying flavors just didn't blend well on the tongue.

The burger was a great size so I was okay with paying $7 for it. I got it home and began to eat it. One thing that I thought could be improved was the temperature because it wasn't that hot. It had a pretty good taste, but I felt that it was more chorizo than anything and with the toppings and just became a little too salty. The fries were decently hot, so no complaints there.

Called ahead to see if they take reservations, they said it's first come first served. Bummer, but that's fine. I asked if they had free parking. They said yes, there's a large lot, but street parking is available as well. I knew the restaurant is located on Memorial, which you can't park on, so I asked where the closet street parking is located. I was told, \\"just anywhere, just drive around the neighborhood.\\" Hmm, okay. Lot was full when we got there, and come to find out it was valet anyway. That's acceptable for a Friday night and considering it's a newer place so I can't hold that against them. So, we drive around \\"the neighborhood.\\" There isn't a neighborhood, just a few apartment complexes and warehouses that don't allow parking out front. There was literally one street with about 15 cars worth of space that allowed for parking in a two block radius. The area is not well lit, so we didn't want to try much further due to safety.  Finally we luck out on a space and walk up to the \\"front\\" of the building. Turns out that's not the entrance. We see the patio to our left, so there must be a way into the restaurant form there, right? Nothing was marked and it was hard to tell if anyone was staff to ask for directions, so we walked back around the building to find the parking lot side with a door that for all I know may have had a sign, but it was so poorly placed it was just a guess that that would be the one to get us in. Success, we were finally in. We walk straight ahead to the host stand. Immediately upon greeting, we're told there is more than an hour wait. We noticed while wandering the patio that there were a handful of open tables so, innocently, we asked if the patio was \\"seat yourself.\\" We were rudely told by Graham that, no, it's first come first served. Right... I get that, but at some establishments that means first one to get the table gets served if it's open seating, so being first timers, and knowing that lady bird's patio is fair game, it was a fair question on our part. To Graham, that was apparently a stupid question. We shrug and comment that we will just go to the bar. Graham then said, \\"don't go to the bar, its full over there.\\" Okay dude, please try harder to not take my business. That was the last straw. We turned around and left. I'm extremely disappointed in how he handled the situation. I was willing to wait the hour for the eventual table, despite there being many unoccupied, but being talked down to by the host when trying to do anything as a guest to eat at that restaurant really puts a bad taste in your mouth. I would really love to come back and try the place out, but until the condescending staffing and horrible seating situation is figured out, I will tell everyone I know to stay away."},{"name":"Mi Mexico","address":"4775 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I am stationed in California but every time I come home to Columbus I ask my fianc√© to take me to get Mexican here.

I explained that our mignonette tasted only of alcohol and asked if there was anything with vinegar.  Our waitress stated that she thought there was vinegar in the kitchen.  For some reason, she then dropped off a cup of syrupy balsamic vinegar (never eaten with raw oysters) and studiously ignored us the rest of the night.\\n\\nChastened, we picked at our food and left soon thereafter.

One of them is not having to debate about where to go to breakfast. I was a guest at the Hosteling International on Hawthorne. I only stayed one night there, as I wanted to explore the neighborhood, which is totally new to me as a transplant in progress. :) \\nAs a former resident of San Francisco, I am used to an almost overwhelming array of food options. I lived there for 5 years and don't recall every waiting for a table. Ever. I find it odd that folks in Seattle and Portland actually seem to enjoy hanging around a restaurant for 40 minutes or more for a meal as simple as breakfast. I guess it's a cultural thing. \\nI checked out of the hostel, put my bags in storage, and set off down Hawthorne towards 22nd. \\nI could tell I was coming up on Jam (which I scoped out on Yelp!) because of the people thronged around the entrance. There were folks on both sides of the building. Normally this sort of scene keeps me out of an establishment. I decided to walk in to scope it out. In the room I walked into, there was a little seating area in the front which was full of folks seated and waiting for tables, and a small high table with a clip board that had a waiting list. I looked around, and saw only 7 or so tables and booths, and no counter. No wonder the place is full! \\nUpon further inspection, I saw that there was a door which led to a much large room, with even more tables, and a bar! I glanced at the wait list again, wondering if I should put my name down if I'm just going to sit at the counter. I saw a couple of parties of 1 that were on the list. This party of one had no intention of waiting, so I walked towards the bar and seated myself at the only available seat at the counter. The bartender took my order of coffee and a Florentine Benedict. The coffee was strong and good, and I got to watch the action as they made mimosas and Bloody Mary's for a big party that ordered like 10 of them. My food came out in 10 minutes, and I was offered a lot of coffee refills, for which I paid 2.95. The Benedict was 10.95, and the Hollandaise was really unique, and the heirloom tomatoes were delicious.\\nI was in and out of there in a fraction of the time some people are willing to wait.

Right off of Ponce with plenty of parking in the lot and across the street.\\n\\n2.  Monday is $5 burrito day. That's for any burrito. A great price for a what is ultimately a filling meal. It's made right in front of you too.\\n\\n3.  Nice and spacious. Friendly staff. Very clean.  Plenty of options for soft drinks and now they have five sauces for your food.\\n\\nThe cons:\\n\\n1.  Bland. Bland. Bland. Just a bland burrito in general. The only way to bring some flavor to it was to drench it in some form of sauce. It really felt like I was chewing up some bland food in a soft cardboard shell. It just was not tasty at all.\\n\\n2.  The sauces say all-natural but really have some type of weird aftertaste. Definitely not what I would consider to be fresh. Their cranberry-lime sauce is way too sweet. It's really just syrupy in regards to the taste and texture. The chips were also a little stale. \\n\\nI would sum it up to say that Moe's seems to have become the Subway of the burrito world. They used to be pretty good but now it defines the meaning of fast food. I gave it a shot, filled my stomach, but not with a quality product. Next time I'll take the extra drive along the way and go to El Myr. From what I remember Willy's is also much better."},{"name":"OAK Long Bar + Kitchen","address":"138 St. James Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I write this review, maybe unfairly, as someone who really loved the Oak Room, so bear in mind that if you had never been to the old Oak Room or didn't like it, you may find this place much more appealing than I did. Granted, it was clear the old place was getting dated and business was slow. The renovation and relaunch as Oak Long Bar & Kitchen was long overdue. Gone are the separate dining room and bar area. Now it is one large, loud room. Seriously loud. The techno/trance music is blaring, no more live jazz piano. It is so loud, you have to shout to be heard. Tables are packed tight. Instead of individual tables and booths, seating is mostly at a crowded long banquette along the wall, with a few high tops and four tops in the middle. There is ample seating at the bar with nice wide leather stools. The dark stained warm mahogany wainscoting has been painted over with milk colored paint, and the carpet has been replaced with tiles and hard woods (contributing to the noise.) There is a new outside entrance and outdoor seating available, weather permitting.  Though we didn't have a reservation (they weren't taking any the night we went) we were seated immediately at the banquette, along with our wet coats and umbrellas. Strangely, there is no longer a coat check. While we perused the menu, a small glass with two crackers was set on the table. I realize they made the crackers in house and they were very good, but only two? And no bread, despite the beautiful new oven?\\n \\nFor cocktails, I ordered a Manhattan ($18 with the little ice bucket and carafe) and she had the Watermelon Margarita ($12). The Manhattan was the same as the old Oak Bar Manhattan, complete with the house cured cherries. The margarita was not as sweet as a typical margarita, and only had a subtle taste of melon. \\n\\nThe menu is actually quite moderately priced, with main courses in the teens up to $40. The wine list is much shorter than before and has several value priced wines. For starters, we tried the quinoa salad ($10). It featured chopped vegetables, grilled peaches and pistachios. We found it fishy, salty, and it had an off aroma, like it was starting to go bad, almost as if it was a few days old. We asked the waiter to substitute the beet salad and it was promptly replaced. The beet salad was very simple. Chunks of beets, scattered with a few pecans, and lightly dressed. It was good, but for the price, I would have expected a little more. For our mains, we had the organic mushroom flatbread ($16) and the \\"Bone-out\\" ribeye ($39). The flatbread was a delicious pizza, featuring sauteed wild mushrooms, garlic, arugula, and an egg plopped down the middle. Absolutely would order it again. The ribeye, was a boneless cut, served with onion rings and a roasted marrow bone. The steak was topped with roquefort butter, and cooked a tad over the medium rare that I ordered, but was still tender and juicy. The onions were excellent, crispy shoestring style, though a bit on the salty side. The fried parsley mixed in was a nice touch. The marrow was a bit dry and a small portion, but what I managed to scrape off the bone was rich, fatty, and unctuous. I only wish there was bread to spread it on. We paired the meal with a nice full bodied Spanish tempranillo, which was a real bargain at $44/bottle. (Note to management: you misspelled tempranillo on your wine list.)\\n\\nI get what they are trying to do here. The old place was a special occasion, once or twice a year, fine dining suit and tie kind of place. The new place is more casual, reasonably priced, and geared towards attracting a regular daily afterwork crowd. Unfortunately, they sacrificed the intimacy and individual attention that made the customer feel like they were being given the royal treatment. \\n\\nAt the Oak Room, you never heard the conversation of the table next to you. It was too far away, and the room was quiet enough you didn't have to shout. Here's the conversation I overheard at my recent visit. \\n\\nTable to my left: \\"Hey Harry! How you doin? Haven't seen you in a while...\\"\\nTable to my right: \\"I'm good, just hangin' out. How about you?\\"\\n...this goes on for a few minutes while the two men have a conversation, right across my table...\\n\\nWhen did this ever seem like the proper behavior in a restaurant? I remember in elementary school being told that it wasn't polite to shout to another table. I think Oak Long Bar overshot the casual, because it feels like it is just another bar that serves decent food. In the future, I may return, but only for drinks and a snack."},{"name":"Demo's","address":"146 Lexington St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"I often go to this place.

It's across from the Music Hall.  The balcony of the restaurant overlooks Shoal Creek which makes for a nice outdoor experience.  They tend to seat families with young children on the patio, which makes for a nice indoor experience for the rest of us.\\n\\nThere's a lot of things that make up a dining experience.  The food is probably the most important.  Garrido's gets a solid 4 star for that.  It's probably best described as trendy Mexican-fusion.  Some of the dishes are quite inspired.  Others are okay.  Lots of complex flavors and not overly spicy.\\n\\nWe've often eaten there on weekends for lunch or brunch and it's a good choice for both.  You can have a lighter meal of tacos or a couple of appetizers or you can go for the god-what-a-rough-night-I-need-comfort-food dish like chilaquiles or migas.  \\n\\nThe desserts are quite nice too.\\n\\nThe restaurant is moderately sized- large for downtown when you include the patio.  The times that we have been, the restaurant has not been too loud, so we have been able to have a conversation and we've gone with friends, so it's a good choice if you want a place that's not too loud, doesn't have mondo televisions tuned to sports channels and doesn't have music blaring in the background.  \\n\\nIt's a convenient place to eat if you're at Ballet Austin, the music hall or you're going out to the clubs.

Done!  \\n\\nWe had been frightened by tales of a long wait, but there were only three other tables occupied when we arrived.  Of course, they only have about eight tables plus the counter, but it was the perfect balance of quiet and cozy with warm and alive.  (This was a cold Sunday evening around 7 pm.)\\n\\nNeither my girlfriend nor I much care for oysters, so we forsook the raw bar in favor of early courses.  She got the famous chowder, and I tried the lobster salad with baby iceberg wedge, grape tomatoes, stilton crumble, crispy pancetta bits, and tarragon vinaigrette.  It felt simply off somehow, as if one ingredient was seriously amiss but the rest all worked together in wonderful symphony.  It may have been either the tarragon or the lobster meat itself.  I tasted the chowder but failed to appreciate the heaps of praise that I had read.  It was rather bland, actually.  We would have liked to have bread or rolls with the salad and soup, but none were offered.\\n\\nThankfully, the quality of the meal picked up from there.  I ordered one of the daily specials--the Gloucester fisherman's plate, a monstrous assembly of cod, scallops, swordfish, and various shellfish over potatoes and cabbage, with a savory, slightly creamy broth.  Very, very good, especially the cod and scallops.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend wanted to eat lighter and ordered the scallops.  Those were some of the best that I've ever tasted.\\n\\nNo coffee or dessert at this restaurant:  there are plenty of great bakeries in the neighborhood, and Neptune Oyster knows its niche.

Having lived just around the corner for the last seven years, we couldn't be happier a place like this has arrived.  As other reviews mentioned, this joins Local 149 and Franklin as some finer dining options in the neighborhood.\\n\\nThe place is massive inside, with an entire separate back bar and dining area.  It almost feels like a place downtown or something.  I cant even think of a restaurant that is actually this big in Boston.  What's great is although it feels full, even up at the bar area there is still room to hangout and drink comfortably.  I will say, it is pretty loud due to the high ceilings and all exposed brick walls.  They don't blast music though, so it's bearable and you get used to it.  After two rounds and about 30-40 minutes we found a spot at the bar.  The front called us for a table around that time, so as an estimate, on a busy Thursday night, expect to wait that long for a table of 2.\\n\\nThe bartenders were great and very attentive considering how full it was.  We just had some beers, of which they had a very extensive list.  For dinner, we split the bacon wrapped dates to start.  They came out on a plate of four and were excellent.  Sweet and savory.  For dinner she got the smaller plate of pumpkin ravioli (for some dishes you can get a large or small serving which is awesome).  The pasta tasted very fresh and might even be made in house.  I got the steak sandwich which comes on a toasted bread with cheese and onions.  I thought it was excellent.  Also had a side of fries.\\n\\nIf you are itching to try this place get here early or try a weeknight.

Yes, flagging down someone might have taken about 2-3 mins longer than another place but considering how crazy busy they were on a Friday night I was pleasantly surprised on how \\"nice\\" the servers were. In fact we overstayed our welcome since I think it's a 2 hour limit and we were there for 3 hours. No one came by to hassle us and we were 4 people sitting at a 6 person table. Primo location too. Food was decent and we were not shortchanged on any of our orders at all. \\n\\nOverall we would definitely return to this location again for hot pot w/friends. Would be way too much food for just for 2 persons. Most orders are enough for 4 persons. Really like their $2 non-alcoholic drink orders w/free refills. Generous sized glass to fill the plum drink or pop. \\n\\nOnly thing to remember, not exactly sure at what time, but we left at 10:35 pm, elevator needs to be \\"called\\" up by using restaurant's pass so staff has to come outside and use the pass electronically to call up the elevator to get people down to the underground parking garage to retrieve their car. No other way, the one & only way.

We always thought PCG (portland city grill) would be our best bet for consistent good food with nice view in the Portland area. Totally did not expect such low quality food. Like what I said, what the freak happened?\\n\\nFirst of all, after we got seated we sat there waited for 10 minutes because our server forgot/didn't know about us. No bread, no water, just menus from the hostess. Then server (he) came by and gave us water, and another 10 minutes before we had to flag someone to notify our server to take our order. Still no bread.\\nNote: They weren't busy. The whole restaurant was less than half full.\\nThen we ordered our 3 apps and entree.\\nLess than 5 minutes later, all 3 appetizers came out. Wow. This speeding food preparation is so unreal it's so pre-made. We literally just ordered and out they came. And of course, as we expect it, all not fresh. We ordered the Kung Pao Calamari, Seared yellowfin tuna, and Yellowtail sashimi. The Kung pao calamari was so old and not fresh that the fried part came off of the squid itself; they were slightly warm and soggy. \\nOur seared yellowfin was also not fresh, none of the ingredients on that dish was cold, they were all slightly warm. None of it had fresh taste.\\nNeedless to go on with the yellowtail sashimi, worst sashimi ever. Again far from being fresh.\\nEach app was around $16, and who would be happy to be pay $16 for pre-made apps?\\n\\nAt this point we lost all hope for the oncoming entree, the Porterhouse steak for $62. It came and it literally tasted like nothing special. We told our server we wanted to share the entree when we ordered, and he brought out the steak on one plate and another empty plate. This part confused me as I wondered what happened to the good service when they would split 1 entree into 2 plates instead of making the customers cut and split the food themselves. I wouldn't expect this in Applebee's because it's Applebee's, but I'm having a $62 steak at PCG, it better include professional service.\\nMidway of eating this average $62 steak off the main plate, a busboy came over and saw my \\"empty\\" \\"sharing\\" plate, and he asked me if I'm finished with it and if he could take my plate away. (Note it wasn't professional the way he asked me). It was awkward and weird. Shouldn't I have my own half of the entree? or shouldn't he know that it was a \\"sharing\\" plate?\\nP.S. Our bread finally came. WITH the entree. Wow, it made so much sense it blew my mind.\\n\\nWe were disappointed enough after 3 pre-made appetizers and 1 average expensive steak, we decided to save the money and not risk being more disappointed by going somewhere else for dessert.\\n\\nBottom line:  PCG seems to have become a place that nothing makes it worth going BESIDES the view.\\nIt's way too overpriced for the food quality. I would never ever go there again (I'm so sad to hear myself say that). But perhaps I should've taken the signal when I saw PCG on Groupon...\\nService: 2 stars for a fine dining place\\nFood: 1 star for a fine dining place (I mean if I wanted this level of food quality, I could've gone to Applebee's)\\nPrice: Way too over the top for what it's worth."},{"name":"Roadworthy","address":"125 Washington St","city":"Dedham","stars":"5","text":"Loved this little place.

There were available parking spaces in front of the restaurant which came as a pleasant surprise. I was expecting to have to find street parking or get my car valeted (do they valet in the morning?)\\n\\nThe restaurant was pretty much empty and we were the first to be seated in the \\"air-conditioned\\" patio area. It was pretty warm at first but not unbearable. I didn't think about the temperature after we were seated so it might be a non-issue.\\n\\nI was looking forward to trying one of the bellinis but seeing that I had only two hours of sleep the previous night, I settled for a good ole cup of joe. Our waiter was good about providing refills and even offering me a refill after we had paid for our meal.\\n\\nWe were given a complimentary basket of baked goods - two strawberry muffins and a scone. We finished our muffins (tasty) and my sister had taken half the scone. Before I could grab the other half, our food arrived and a server quickly snatched the basket with the scone. No \\"can I take this?\\" or anything. It's not like they can give it to anyone else and I hate to think that it might feed hungry staff members. Well, my sister loved the scone. I, on the other hand, have no opinion.\\n\\nWe ordered the French Toast and Eggs Slum Mulligan. The French Toast came out on a big plate with four large halves of sliced challah bread, topped with a scoop of cinnamon butter. It was good, but not amazing. The Eggs Slum Mulligan was served in a small cast iron skillet, very colorful with the cheese shreds and diced pepper and onions on top. The poached eggs were cooked well, but the \\"potato hash\\" was just diced potatoes. I don't expect it to be shredded potato hash, but it was like diced French fries with no salt. On top were pockets of bacon, then the eggs, shredded cheese, and the peppers/onions. So you're left with just the yolk to bring all of these ingredients together. That's a lot to ask of yolk. Now I understand why the server offered me ketchup and hot sauce. I would have preferred a complementary sauce.\\n\\nWe left at 9:30 and the patio area wasn't even half filled.
