What it was instead was fascinating.  \\n\\nDan ordered this pork leg dish that came out all shredded like pad kee mow with mustard, cherries, and this fermented, old-wine taste that had the initial kick of something off, but resolved into tangy bliss.  \\n\\nMy main course, swordfish, honest-to-god looked like a spam patty with fake grill marks on it.  Dan and I stared at it and tried not to burst out laughing as it was set down it front of us.  However, it tasted savory and flaky and amazing, especially when you got a bite full on with the beans and pancetta.\\n\\nContrary to most of the fancy meals I've had, I preferred the entrees here to the appetizers.  The gnocchi broth tasted like high-sodium minestrone soup and, when informed, much to Dan's scarlet-faced embarrassment, the waiter insisted on removing it and bringing us something else instead.  We chose the risotto, which was insanely rich, but would have probably been wonderful had we not just finished the also insanely rich, but much tastier polenta.\\n\\nThe polenta came with big chunks of succulent blue prawn and fava bean and was the favorite of the first courses, beating out the hiramasa crudo, which was fine, but honestly, I think it's never OK to put onions or anything pickled on a perfect cut of raw fish.  It just overpowers it.\\n\\nThe pasta alla chittara was incredibly al dente, almost to the point where you think, \\"Is this a vegetable or a noodle?\\" but it was very refreshing - a true cooling summer dish.\\n\\nOh, and the salumi - I'd skip the breadsticks, they taste like Goldfish - but the meats were all distinct and all tasty, wonderfully accompanied by horseradish cream, which we scooped up liberally with each bite.\\n\\nThe tasting of chocolates was nothing special except for the passionfruit one, which was stunning.  Apart from that, I much preferred the rich, espresso-laced caramel shake, which came with what I pronounced the best part of the meal: soft cinnamon-y cookies.\\n\\nI know I'm showing my true colors in this write-up: I'm a street-food-seeking, hole-in-the-wall-loving deal hunter who's most comfortable discovering unexpected, truly delicious grub in strange places.  I prefer to eat with my feet up, loudly exclaiming, fumbling my chopsticks, and only about $5-$10 lighter in the wallet.  It's true.  \\n\\nBut for a fancy restaurant experience, Frasca's service was outstanding, the best part of the night.  We were treated like royalty, seated outdoors in a secluded spot, and given a magnolia leaf with 'Happy Anniversary' written on it with our dessert.  Our waiter truly wanted to know how we were enjoying our food, and rushed to correct things when we weren't.  There was no part of the service I would have wanted better.\\n\\nAm I glad I went?  Yes, for the experience.  Do I want to go back?  Not particularly.

We quickly placed appetizer orders: spring rolls and beef satay with peanut sauce. Minutes later, we were happy devouring the two dishes. The spring roll crust was near perfect: light, flaky and not too greasy, and the inside vegetables were just the right amount of substance and flavor. The beef satay was something special; there were two good-sized beef skewers sprinkled with ground peanuts and served with a delectable peanut sauce that was used for not only the appetizer it came with but for the spring rolls and the main dishes as well (yes, it was that good). The beef was soft and mildy chewy, seasoned with a sweet and light teriyaki sauce (yummm). \\n\\nAs a lover of pho, I went with the pho beef satay for my meal. As one of the spiciest dishes on the menu (two peppers), my palate was not disappointed. Unlike other pho soups I've triend (such as the beef satay at Pho Lemongrass in one of my previous reviews), this soup was not broth-dominant; instead, it was loaded with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, beef slices, vermicelli noodles and the homemade house special sauce, which was sweet and spicey. The vermicelli noodles were the best I've ever had; light, slippery and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The broth was spectacular and very spicey. The beef slices were very good, especially when doused with the peanut sauce and the homemade hoisin sauce. Amidst the \\"oohs\\", the \\"ahhs\\", the \\"yummms\\" and the \\"oh my gods\\", I managed to tell the owner that it was myfirst time here and also how much I was enjoying the soup. He asked how I knew to order the pho beef satay since it was my first time...I told him it was a lucky guess. So people...trust your luck no more!

And contrary to the opinions of others, I actually enjoyed my Ribeye Steak Sandwich for $13. (Sliced ribeye steak with onions, mushrooms and provolone on a French baguette). You can pick your own cheese, but i just chose the provolone. I found the sandwich tasty, and I thought the house salad that was served with it was fresh.\\n\\nNow, the not-so-good: \\n\\nEither I lucked out with my steak sandwich or maybe I'm just not that discriminating when it comes to my lunch.  This is a possibility, as I like the stuff that comes out of 4Rivers and yet have been told by others that it's nothing special. But I'm getting off track: my co-worker ordered the Avocado Club Sandwich for $10 (Turkey, Ham, applewood bacon, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, cilantro mayo and avocado spread).  His reaction: meh. For a sandwich that uses Avocado as its first name, it apparently doesn't have much avocado at all. In addition, it's triple stacked but its taste apparently didn't match its size. as my co-worker said: it would have been better to get a smaller sandwich that was better quality. Finally, he said his sweet potato fries were decent but did not come with the proper dip; apparently sweet potato fries deserve a particular kind of dip that the guys at Spice aren't aware of.\\n\\nbut here's what my co-workers and I can all agree on: when a restaurant is about 10% full on a Monday at lunchtime, it should not take 15 minutes to bring out a couple of beers. It should also not take 40 minutes for our food to arrive. \\n\\nI don't blame the waiting staff for the slow service (well, maybe they should take some blame for the slow beer service - or is the bartender who should be blamed?)

The shakes are very tasty and if that was the only thing I was judging it would be higher. The service was fine, it's just the price. I don't go there very often just because the price of the Shakes are expensive and since the boyfriend and I are usually getting one late in the day we will often turn to Sonic since they are half off after 8. The quality of shake is much better at Mighty Fine, that is definitely a given.. but for the amount you get and the price, it is something that does stop me from going more often."},{"name":"Lime Fresh Mexican Grill","address":"500 N Orlando Ave, Ste 100","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Food: Good; Chips: Meh; Salsas: Not great; Music: Way too loud. \\n\\nWe ate here before a movie. It is a great place to grab something quickly before heading to the Regal next door, especially since everything else in Winter Park Village is a sit down restaurant. I got a steak burrito. I liked it. It came with a side of tortilla chips. Due to a chewing fail, I ended up jamming a piece of the chip into the roof of my mouth and started to bleed. Though this was my own fault, it kind of ruins the mood of a dinner.  The music was oddly loud in there.

However, do not go there expecting the Fogo De Chao experience, for you will be disappointed. It just isn't Fogo, thus it is not as pricey. I enjoyed the salad bar, but there are no premium items such smoked salmon or artichoke hearts like at Fogo. The quality of the salad bar was still pretty good. One thing I would like is for the side dishes (mashed potatoes, corn, plantains) to be served hot with the meat, instead of cold on the salad bar.\\n\\nThe meats were brought out relatively slowly, but that was understandable given that we were the only diners at that time. Our favorites were the ribeye, filet, and rump steak. I do not recall being served the chicken hearts. Our Travelzoo deal was $49 for two dinners + bottle of wine. The wine selection was limited to the $29.99 bottles (more expensive bottles required paying the difference). Overall, we enjoyed our salads, meats, and wine. Despite being charged for sales tax and 18% gratuity on the non-coupon price, it was still a pretty good deal."},{"name":"Smokebelly BBQ","address":"128 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"GUYS.

I've never tried their standard dinner menu, but I likely won't be returning anytime in the foreseeable future given that my lunch experience was largely underwhelming. In La Grotta's case, the viewing definitely beats the chewing. \\n\\nFood: The standard dinner menu at La Grotta is largely comprised of traditional Northern Italian fare, but the lunch buffet would best be described as casual American. Available options included green salad, pasta salad, vegetables, cold cuts (turkey only), and rolls. The food was selected by the luncheon organizers from a set menu, so I won't hold the lack of options against the restaurant. However, the offerings that were available were simply not that good. I've had more flavorful food in hospital cafeterias. The food was also served in miniscule dishes, which caused the line to come to a complete standstill while the staff attempted to replenish each item.    \\n\\nService: Both the food and drinks were self-service, so the staff was largely absent for most of the luncheon. However, the limited staff that was present was quick to clear the tables.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: One of this restaurant's greatest attributes is its location. The dining room is relatively secluded from the rest of the hotel and features large windows with picturesque views of the surrounding gardens and waterfalls. The restaurant has a centrally located, open kitchen, as well as several private rooms. \\n\\nCost: Again, I can't comment on the standard menu, but the luncheon buffet was severely overpriced at $25 per person. Gratuity was included; nonetheless, the food quality still wasn't commensurate with the cost.\\n\\nOther: La Grotta is located on the lower level of the Crowne Plaza Ravinia hotel. The restaurant is only open for dinner, Monday-Saturday, 5:30PM-10:00PM. Valet parking is available and free with validation. Additional free parking is also available in the hotel garage."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I read all the Yelp reviews about the sweet potato sandwich and had to try it too.

My wife and I came in for the Monday Tasting Menu. It was so good we are coming back for the Jim Meehan event later in March. Service was perfect, food was perfect, and the drinks were on-point.\\n\\nFor cocktails I started with the Amaro Shoga. Excellent drink with a tasty candied ginger garnish, Toki Whisky, Amaro Nonino, Lemon Juice, and Spiced Ginger Syrup, and Honey. Only things I would change is to bump up the whiskey slightly for balance. It's still and excellent cocktail that I think would appeal to a very wide audience, especially cocktail newbies. But it's not just a froofy drink, it's complex and challenging, and the execution is excellent.\\n\\nMy wife got the House Paloma. A typical Paloma is a tequila, grapefruit juice, lime juice, club soda cocktail with a little salt. Not here. The same character and flavors you expect are there, but it's so much more complex and powerful. They combine Tequila, Campari, a grapefruit cordial, and lime juice. Very well balanced, sophisticated. The bitter from the Campari balances out the sour from the lime juice perfectly. And that cordial is something else. It's basically an oleo saccharum with grapefruit peels instead. Such a great idea, because you get the total characteristic of what you expect to be a grapefruit taste, but with a reduction in the acidity and sometimes overpowering tartness. This is the true Paloma, this is what they should have tasted like in the first place!\\n\\nI ordered a Sazerac. Perfect execution and seems to follow the Death and Co. style recipe to a T, and there's everything right with that. My wife got some Ohishi Whiskey neat by recommendation of our server Alex. Very interesting Japanese whisky, slightly reminded me of Akashi red oak that I had while in Japan, another small distillery brand. I got a glass of Braulio Amaro which was a little earthy, grassy, sweet, herbacious, and perfect for a dessert situation to tie everything together. Alex recommended that as well. She seems to have a really distinct passion for spirits, someone needs to get her behind the bar! We need more women in craft bartending!\\n\\nDinner was amazing. The carpaccio was a unique cut for this use it felt like. The beef was kind of gamier, cut slightly thicker than a typical carpaccio that I've had, but it was perfectly seasoned. They let it stand on it's own strengths with the light olive oil and anchovy sauce. About the best beef carpaccio I've had.\\n\\nThe risotto al funghi was perfect. The choice of carnaroli rice, which I've never had before, really paid off. That extra starch permeates into the dish giving it a natural creaminess which I assume was achieved through less butter, and of course skipping the cheat of using cream in the kitchen. The mushrooms were perfectly matched for this dish. Risotto was just slightly harder than al dente, but that actually worked in this dish's favor even if it was unintentional.\\n\\nThe brasato di manzo was a super fatty shortrib (yum) with michelin-star-grade UK-style mashed potato. The shortrib was cooked perfectly with a nice crunch, soft interior, consistent color, and the mash was like a cream sauce which went perfect with it.\\n\\nThe Panna Cotta for dessert was absolutely perfect. Light, tasty, fresh. Those three words described it for me. I'm not a big dessert guy because usually they come on too strong or they aren't interesting. This was both delicate and very interesting. Basil, almond, mango, and coconut in a dessert is a great flavor combination.\\n\\nAll in all, I would recommend this place to the entire sum of my friends, family, and even enemies. Had a wonderful experience which was certainly made even better by talking a little cocktail shop with the bar manager (forgot your name buddy, sorry!) and Alex (get her behind the bar ASAP!).

They take pretty crappy meat and they over-work it into random sized patties (we got 3 half pound burgers all very different sizes). I didn't taste salt or pepper. The burger came out extremely dry. Not like well done dry, like the burger was cooked at too low a temperature for too long dry. Like you got frozen patties from Costco and you didn't even get the nicer frozen patties kinda dry. My bottom bun was soaked, I just got rid of it and ate open face. The grilled onions were hardly cooked. The tomato on my burger was completely green. The cheddar was completely flavorless. \\n\\nThe fries are alright. I don't like crinkle fries generally cause they cook unevenly I find, but since these are smaller it wasn't a huge deal, I would even say I liked them.\\n\\nThe onion rings are also pretty good, a nice medium not overly battered onion. It also had no salt but that was an easy fix.\\n\\nMilk shakes are meh. The strawberry milkshake was alright but I wasn't crazy about it for some reason, maybe I just prefer one made from strawberry ice cream. The chocolate milkshake tasted good but as I got to the bottom I started getting some weird graininess (is there malt in these?) which was fine but not great. The lemonade milkshake doesn't work.

It wasn't too packed which was great considering we walked past Little Donkey next door and it was slammed. We were initially surprised that there were only two soup options- original and spicy. We ordered half and half and since the restaurant is called happy lamb we ordered the New Zealand lamb as our protein, got lamb dumplings, and then ordered a bunch of veggies and noodles.\\n\\nThe spicy broth (as you can tell from my picture) was super spicy and so full of chili's that we had to scoop most of them out in order to be able to cook our food. It was almost too spicy to sip alone or cook the greens in but gave good flavor to the taro root we ordered and the lamb. The original flavor was great. BTW usually I love spicy more than not but the spicy was just REALLY spicy. \\n\\nThe lamb dumplings that we ordered were not part of the hot pot- they came cooked and were pretty good. Between the two of us we ordered one order or the New Zealand lamb, one order of mushrooms, one order or watercress, one order of taro root, and one order of baby bok Choy. We also got an order of potato noodles which were interesting but really hard to chew even after cooking for a long time, and the dumplings which I mentioned before. Our check was just under $50 and we were stuffed.\\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was that they had sake on the menu but they were all out.

They are VERY heavily flavored with cumin, so you must love it to enjoy them fully, that's where I knock a few stars back, a bit too overwhelming for me.  I also knocked a few stars back for the meat.  The beef in the noodles as well as the crispy beef rolls is as thin as deli style lunch meat, paper thin and almost flavorless.  It's very weird, I've never seen a restaurant with that style of beef.  The general chicken was a very small portion for the price with a few wilted pieces of broccoli.  The sauce was alright, sweet and spicy, but swimming in oil, and the chicken was soggy.

Just like any other GB I've been to, the restaurant is very large, with many separate seating areas and a bar. The look is all rich dark woods and granite. The place is clean and classy. \\n\\nThe Food: GB has a HUGE menu. I count 14 appetizer items, 13 salads, 8 pizzas, 7 steaks, 10 seafood offerings, 3 taco offerings, 11 pasta/stir-fry dishes, 8 sandwiches, 5 burgers and 5 desserts on the menu. I've eaten at GB 3 times, and each visit has yielded delicious, high-quality food. Every meal has impressed me. I've personally had the 14 oz. New York Strip (cut well, seasoned well, cooked to perfection, and served with delicious potato wedges under crumbled gorgonzola cheese and crisp, fresh and delicious asparagus) and the Marzen Barbeque Burger (a HUGE 10 oz. burger, again seasoned and cooked to perfection and topped with thick and crispy smoked bacon, a veritable chunk of fresh cheddar cheese, and a healthy helping of GB's own signature Marzen barbeque sauce; served with awesome garlic fries). Five-star food in my book. \\n\\nThe Drinks: 43 wines on the list (ranging from $22-86 a bottle), 8 martinis, 11 \\"specialty cocktails,\\" 4 mojitos, 5 margaritas, and a full bar. That's a great menu by itself, but where GB shines is in their BEER. They've got Bud and Miller Lite (who in their right mind gets one of these at this place?!), and 6 house brews. At any given time they've got a house brewed seasonal beer, Golden Export, Hefeweizen, Czech Pilsner, Marzen and Schwarzbier on tap. During each of my last two visits I've done the 6-beer sampler. It includes 4 oz. of each of the beers on the menu, served on a paper place mat describing each of the beers. Every single beer I've had here has been fantastic. I especially liked their Oktoberfest beer (so much so that I ordered a liter of it, then bought my liter-mug as a bit of a souvenir). \\n\\nThe Service: great every time. The wait staff is professional and attentive, the drinks are always full, and the food is prepared at a decent clip.\\n\\nThe Price: on par with the experience/food quality: $10 for a burger, $15 for pasta, $25 for a steak. More expensive than your Applebee's and Ruby Tuesdays, but rightly so. Less expensive than your Ruth's Chris and J. Alexander's, but rightly so (as the food is great, but not on the same level as those two places, in my opinion). \\n\\nOverall: I don't believe I have any complaints with Gordon Biersh. My heart pulls me towards 4 stars just because of my bias against chain restaurants, but I think that's unfair. For what it is (a mid-level price chain restaurant), GB is pretty darn awesome. The beer by itself is reason enough to come. The great service and excellent, quality food are just kickers - more reasons to come - for me.

The second time I was there I had their ribs, and they were the driest ribs I've ever had in my entire life.  They took back the ribs and gave me something else, but not without a bad attitude - and a visit from a manger or owner who asked me what the issue was, said he REALLY wanted me to be happy, but then instead of listening to my complaint, argued with me that the ribs were dry and not at all tasty.  Who argues with a customer who doesn't like his/her food?

This would really increase the nice vibe in here. I was bummed out they didn't have any of your usual house made Mexican drinks. Horchata, Jamaica. House made tortillas would also make the tacos taste better. The meat had lots of fat on it. I felt I was pulling it out of my mouth every other bite. The vegan tacos had some good flavor to them. I got a complaint from the order of chilaquiles. The tofu on it was too salty. The taquitos order came with store bought taco shells. Another bummer in my eyes. The taquitos lacked flavor.

The Szechuan Style Spicy & Crispy Prawns - again, a truly tasty dish.  Watch this one, though, it's HOT!  It's not only covered in hot oils, but there are numerous chili peppers infused within the dish - more than enough to satisfy even the most jaded purveyor of hot food.  It also includes dry-braised string beans and oven-toasted peanuts to make a truly delectable dish!  Even their special fried rice dish - Yang Zhou Fried Rice is a MUST TRY!

I'm hungry, and I've already done some work downtown.  What would make a good way to start the day, Mr. I Went To Bed Early and DON'T Feel Like A Douchebag?\\n\\nThat's right, kiddos, it's breakfast tacos!  Now, as a no-meat-a-tarian, I cannot order chorizo anywhere but Curra's (whose soy chorizo occupies its own shelf on my bookshelf of love), so my breakfast tacos usually end up being egg and cheese or bean and cheese; rarely anything to write Mr. T about.  I'm also a Southie, so I really don't know much on the north (or north-central) side of town.  As I approach my buxy destination, I see a sign for breakfast tacos and think - \\"Why, self, you should eat food!  Caffeine is bad for you!\\"  So I flipped a bi**h and pulled into Casa Chapala.\\n\\nThe outside tables were empty, but for a single septuagenarian reading the paper, but I ventured in nonetheless.   After checking the menu, I decided to order two egg, cheese, and black bean tacos as well as a more standard bean and cheese taco.  With extra salsa, of course.  My food is quickly prepared - as it should have been since I was the only customer in the joint - and brought to me in a plain white bag.  I checked (and found two good-size cups of salsa), and made my way to the office.\\n\\nI sat down about five minutes ago to eat these rolls of food, and boy, and I impressed.  Seriously.  This food was frakking fantastic!  The eggs were obviously real (and no reconsituted or powdered) with fresh cilantro diced in, and the beans fresh out of the pot.  Diced tomatoes made for fresh yumlish and it was topped off perfectly with lots of gooey monterey jack cheese.  The salsa was flavorful, cold, and had LOTS of zing (there's diced cilantro in there too, as well as carrot shreds and jalepeno seeds), which offset the cheese perfectly.\\n\\nThe bean and cheese was a bit more standard, though the amount of gooey, creamy, cheesycheese is notable on its own.  That one was harder to eat, and my Tab key will never be the same, but still tasty.\\n\\n\\nI haven't had any of their other food, nor have I had drinks at their bar.

The place was clean and the staff was reasonably friendly and obviously a little busy, although the dinning room was nearly empty which lead me to assume this is a popular Sunday take out spot. I ordered my egg rolls and after a substantial amount of time, like people who were sat after me receiving their entrees amount of time, I received cold mushy egg rolls. The dipping sauce was nice. Fifteen minutes or so after I finished my egg rolls I stood at the counter to pay, and waited another 5 minutes until my food was ready. Finally, pho in hand I headed back to my hotel, eager to try the MUCH awaited pho. The dish was hot, they provided me with the necessary pho accompaniments, and the meat was sliced thin, as it should be. However there was one thing missing: FLAVOR. It was the blandest broth I've ever tasted, like all the ingredients neutralized one another, or perhaps didn't cook long enough to complement one another. The likelihood of me going here again is slim, mostly because I don't live in the area, but considering it is so close to a high traffic business park, I wanted to pass my experience along to other travelers.

This is the first time this has happened -- the other times I have had great service and the owner stopped by once to chat and was very cool and a delight to talk to. Grey Suit Guy asked us more than once to \\"come back soon\\" and strangely enough, it made me less inclined to do so. This was a special dinner and I am sorry that my friends and I couldn't sustain our connection with each other over dinner before one of them moves out of the country without being constantly interrupted with questions like, \\"HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTING?\\"\\n\\nA busboy whisked away my cocktail way before I was done with it and I told the waiter, and I appreciated my dessert being comped for that. Well done, there.  That's why you want good management and attentive service.  I just think the balance was way off last night and thought they'd want to know.\\n\\nBut again, the FOOD IS GREAT! And it's a pretty restaurant with a good ambiance in Lynn, Lynn, City of Win."},{"name":"City Barbeque","address":"5979 E Main St","city":"Reynoldsburg","stars":"4","text":"Was having a hankering for some barbecue so decided to check out city bbq.

I've eaten at the Reelhouse  at least 5 times, each time hoping the next experience would be more pleasant than the last, and now feel compelled to write a review (my first review on Yelp ever). Every time I have come here, the service is very poor. It has the potential to provide a high tiered experience, given the waterfront location and view. The food is generally good but not great. But even if it was great, the service would have tarnished the experience anyways. The waiters come to the table at most once or twice. Employees of the restaurant walk through the restaurant swearing and making crude marks to each other, staining the experience. In the most recent instance, I was siting outside with about 30 other patrons as rain approached and nothing was done until rain poured all over everyone and their food and everyone had to run inside with their meals stumbling over each other. The only thing on the menu I have gotten that I would order again is the burger. In general, the food isn't that bad. But, service makes the whole experience something to be desired--very slow and unprofessional. I likely won't be coming back here again, which stinks because it is so convenient for me. If I'm going to the amount that the restaurant demands, then I'd expect higher attention to detail from its employees. \\n\\nUPDATE: We came back here to dine again because we wanted a quick meal and it is so convenient!

I've lived in Japan for 2 years and have loved soba noodles for many more years, and I truly think they're on to something. We've had Sushi, we've had Ramen. Soba could be the next big thing in terms of Japanese foods hitting it big time in the states. If you haven't tried it before, Sugidama is a great place to start: they have all of the traditional offerings when it comes to soba, and I urge you to try soba not only due to its deliciousness, but its versatility in the ability to be enjoyed as cold, refreshing tsukemen in the summer as well as hot, broth-based soba in the winter.\\n\\nIn terms of Sugidama itself, the interior is just beautifully designed. Besides the soba, the rest of the menu also features both authentic and fusion Japanese foods which I always appreciate. The takoyaki was a wonderful starter, and the three \\"yakitori\\" grilled dishes I had (scallop, pork belly, and kalbi) did not disappoint. I also sampled the sukiyaki soba, which I will order next time for sure! The sweet and savory sauce, poached egg, pork, and soba all went perfectly together.\\n\\nAdditionally, their wine prices were very reasonable. We had a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for 25$ that was very good!

The building's exterior was rather ho-hum and the restaurant's tiny lobby was very chain restaurant-ish (complete with a case selling its wares). Once we were taken back to the main dining room, however, my impression totally changed. The large and super-clubby steakhouse atmosphere really distracted me from the fact we were eating in a mall parking lot. \\n\\nOverall, I'd say this place is Houston's-ish. Booths, steaks, white jacket waitstaff. But Wildfire has more of a art deco vibe. I could see this place in the first floor of an old Chicago office building, and I mean that in the nicest way.\\n\\nNot a big fan of chains, the whole reason we came to Wildfire was a $25 off coupon we'd received in the mail. It was a good excuse to try some place new and it allowed us to have a nice dinner for about the same price as going to Chick-Fil-A.\\n\\nWe started out with the spinach and artichoke fondue. While not bad, this was my least favorite part of the meal. The fondue was more creamy (and less dip-py) than I would've liked and the toast was a little too thin to support its weight. Just a few minutes into eating, I had a piece of toast break en route to my mouth, which dumped some fondue down my shirt. \\n\\nWhen the entrees showed, however, we were pleasantly surprised. I order a \\"stuffed\\" burger, which had a cheddar cheese and bacon center a la a Juicy Lucy. My wife, true to her steak-loving ways, ordered a steak sandwich. Both had a great hickory flavor from the grill they were cooked on. My burger was extremely juicy and had a nice fresh taste, while Nova's steak sandwich was really good. The perfectly cooked beef was complemented by a creamy, melted cheese and a tasty pesto sauce. Needless to say, there wasn't much left of either of our entrees by the end of the meal. I can say the same about the fries too, which were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. \\n\\nOn the whole, the service wasn't bad, but not great either. Well into eating our entrees, we still had the appetizer plates sitting on our table. Just because we had a big booth table doesn't mean there's room to leave everything, you know? \\n\\nIn the end though, we had a mostly enjoyable experience. Especially considering after using the coupon, our meal was only $13 (before tip). Oh, it's worth noting that for the time being they're running a 3-course deal that's pretty good. You can get an app, small steak or other protein, and a dessert for around $30. While that's not a $25 off coupon, it will give you the opportunity to have a pretty good meal for not nearly as much as you'd think."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"14985 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 127","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"There are major perks about this location:\\n\\n1.

An absolute great donut.  Light, fluffy and delicious.\\n2. Old fashioned buttermilk glazed  - fantastic.   A thick crust I've never experienced before and absolutely loved, cake like inside and their very good glaze.   We loved these too.\\n3. Blueberry Bourbon Basil - ok.   The same light donut as the glazed but no hint of basil or bourbon; just overly sweet frosting (kind of blue berry).   It was fine, but no one went wild for this one.  Should have tried the blueberry cake one...\\n4. Dolce de leche and hazel nut - was fine.  Not spectacular but was enjoyed.\\n5. Coffee coconut chocolate - not good.   Both the coffee lover and coconut lover really disliked this donut.   The one we bough went 1/2 into the compost.  Skip this one.\\n6. Mexican hot chocolate - looks like a great kid donut but they all walked away from it after 2 bites; adults loved.   Lots of flavor and a little spice.  Great donut just not for the little ones.\\n7. Carrot cake - a miss.  We didn't really like this one either, 1/2 went into the compost.  Just didn't taste at all like a carrot cake...the donut or frosting.  Was weird.\\n8. Hard apple cider fritter - excellent.  Love it and I am a fritter fan - one of the best I have ever had.   From great outside crunch (like the old fashioned) to the inside...really a great donut.\\n9. Maple & bacon - good.   The one person who swooped this up did enjoy it quite a bit.\\n10.

The ginger wasn't too overwhelming, the pork wasn't too fatty, and the noodles were cooked just right; it was a very tasty dish.\\n\\nMy boyfriend got the BBQ chicken with fried rice...the rice is your standard fried rice with bay shrimp, bits of BBQ pork, peas, and eggs, the best part is, it doesn't have bean sprouts.  I have nothing against a little sprout-ish but sometimes folks go overboard and it really ruins the integrity of the rice...which was okay but not as good as the noodles.

However, they limit the quantity you can order b/c they're so strong (maybe 2 drinks in one) - LAME.  Not that I really wanted a second one, but kind of an arbitrary house rule.

Most times when you go to a \\"Mexican\\" restaurant the Chile Relleno is usually pretty small and just part of a combination plate.

I mean, it's Portland, Beervana, there's a high standard for beer and I love to try new beers (my personal list is over 2200 different beers) so why not give their product a try, especially since happy hour prices are $1 for their house brews. Well, it's still overpriced. I never thought I'd be drinking a micro and thinking that the bar down the street that serves $2 PBR would be a better deal.  It's what you'd expect if a frat house decided to home brew.  First off, the IPA. I love IPA's and Portland is IPA nirvana. How do you brew in Portland and screw up an IPA????  Well, Splash did it.  It tasted like a skunky pilsner, I got no bite from the hops, no bitterness or complexity that is at the core of a good IPA.  Maybe they forgot the hops? Next, the Lager. Well, swill is a kind description - if Natty Light got left out in the sun. It had a weak flavor that somehow left an unpleasant aftertaste.

They were even setting up more tables and chairs in the aisles to try to offer up some more seating. I finally wormed my way into a free seat at a table of about 16. \\n\\nThe waitress (Barb I think) was amazing! She was waiting on about 50 people and though a tiny bit surly was super quick to offer service. The bartender must have had about a dozen arms as quickly as Barb was bringing drinks out. I was definitely impressed with the service. I ordered my typical Long Island Iced Tea ($6 by the way) and was told that I could only have two of these. I haven't heard that for a while.\\n\\nI was told by the man next to me that the Fish and Chips was great but I just wanted a little 'snack' so ordered a chicken quesadilla. I didn't see the price but when I gave her a $10 all she gave me back was three quarters. $9.25 for a quesadilla? WTF? I have a feeling she might have charged me for the fries the lady next to me also ordered. The quesadilla was great. It filled so full of chicken, peppers, onions, cheese, and (bacon?) that I had to use the utensils provided instead of picking it up with my hands. Maybe it was $9.25. It would have been worth it even at that price.\\n\\nI didn't stick around for the second Long Island as it was so crowded you couldn't even dance.

It's global, eclectic, and full of classic items one would find in the den of a sophisticated world traveler. Really incredible ambiance.\\n\\nEvery seat in the restaurant is comfortable, and all lend themselves to conversation. This would be a great place for a date, or drinks and tapas with friends. \\n\\nThe menu concept is incredible. Every 90 days, they move on to a new \\"destination\\" and focus on global cuisine from that part of the world. Don't worry if you had favorites from a prior menu cycle- they may appear in the \\"residents\\" section. The food is delicious and authentic. Drinks are all handcrafted by a mixologist and they are creative and delicious. Nothing average here. There is also an extensive beer and wine list, which includes single pours of wines that are not usually available by the glass!\\n\\nAs far as the menu items we had:\\n\\n- Duck fat fingerling potatoes: very tasty, and certainly enough to share\\n- yucca fries: incredible! Authentic and delicious. Aioli was flavorful - the perfect compliment. \\n- grilled octopus: phenomenal. Tender and perfectly seasoned. Smaller portion-- would be great to have a larger size option on the menu. Could have eaten that all night! \\n- smoked salmon: fresh with the perfect amount of cream and caviar. Love that it was served atop a hearty piece of bread- no mess! \\n\\nThe visa is changing to Guam next week. I can't wait to go try it and update my review based on that experience. Doug, the owner, really cares about his customers and it was great to speak with him personally. Additionally, the server for the section next to us - Jackson- was one of the best I've ever seen, and he really helped improve our night as well. Looking forward to coming back and sitting in his section- I think it will be a real treat."},{"name":"Pizzeria Ludica","address":"189 Keefer Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The service is not good.

My fiance orders lunch from it frequently because he works nearby, he loves it as well.\\n\\nI don't have much experience with Indian food, but I love the lamb bhuna. It is very flavorful and the lamb is perfect. Not too spicy, but I only asked for medium - I could try it spicier next time.  The rice they serve is delicious as well.  I could eat the entire to go box if I could.  They seem to have a pretty big menu with chicken, lamb and veg items.\\n\\nWe went at 2100 one night, the ambiance was very nice. There were a couple of other people in the restaurant.   We spoke to the owner for about twenty minutes while we waited for the food; he was very genuine and nice.  I enjoyed our conversation. He had a ghost pepper growing on counter - but I didn't touch it! \\n\\nHimalayas seems to be a very authentic Indian restaurant.

The waiter made sure to let us know that everything is made from scratch here, and we were already intrigued. We came at kind of a weird time, like 3:00, so they weren't busy at all. \\n\\nWe started with the tri-dip appetizer--hummus, guac, and goat cheese and pepper jam. LOVED the goat cheese take on the pepper jam dip, and the hummus and guacamole were noteworthy and very obviously homemade. \\n\\nSince it was a weird time of day, we wanted to split a burger. We told the waiter we were deliberating between a couple, and he told us about the \\"burger snack\\" on the menu: a 1/4 lb. size of any of the burgers on the menu (for $7!!), which allowed us to get two different kinds of burgers. I don't even remember which one my dad ordered because the Proven√ßal burger was the star of the show. The basil aioli was so fragrant, and the goat cheese was perfectly creamy. Underneath all the sauce, amazingly, the burger flavor was not lost. Totally delicious burger on its own. One of the best burgers I think I've had! Perfectly cooked, too.\\n\\nWe also ordered the buttermilk chicken tenders, which were really good. Homemade batter and BBQ sauce that was tasty. \\n\\nI had the Forbidden Fruit Mule which was basically just a mule with Pama, but my, it was great. My dad was pleased with the draught offerings. Mom got the white chocolate peach bread pudding to go. She has yet to try it as of writing his review...but I doubt she will be disappointed. \\n\\nLoved this restaurant!

Well these too were a disappointment. They were bland, greasy, and had obviously been fried not hot enough on a flat top griddle instead of a barbecue grill. \\n\\n-The only items that we ate were the few fancy rolls which weren't really very fancy or very great, I've had far better at a mall food court!\\n\\nIf you were going to Kimura's restaurant because you read great reviews, they are all from a different era, or from the odd person who has no taste or pallet or discerning opinion.

Not Iberian Pig tasty, but quite good. Nice fat chicken tenders. Quick seating and service.  Friend loved her beer.\\n\\nCons: The chicken fingers didn't taste the greatest and the BBQ sauce was pretty terrible. My friend and I were supposed to have two chicken fingers each, but she didn't even want another one after eating the first. My Crispin sucked, but not really their fault. But I think our waiter could have guided me a bit better when I was selecting my drink. We were all discussing and my friend asked if I wanted something dry. I said no. Well, Crispin is a dry cider- exactly what I was trying to avoid.\\n\\nNeutral: What a weird menu. Not what I was expecting out of an Irish joint.

We tried three different tacos (bean, fajita and soyrizo) and bean tostadas. I LOVED the tostadas. Nothing fancy but definitely hits the spot.

Over the past several months  I have seen the quality of service and food deteriorate. Consistency in food quality being the biggest issue. After receiving an extremely sub par order of wings for take out, I decided to put a call into the store to express my concerns. The manner in which the issue was addressed was shocking. I was told that the issue was with the supplier and that I would need to call the general manager to discuss. This, after being put on hold and told that the manager was too busy to talk to me. Clearly management and staff at this location are not interested in keeping loyal customers or concerned with putting out quality food. Sorry to have to share this review but hope the right eyes see it and take action to improve food quality, consistency and customer service before it's too late. As I mentioned, I've enjoyed Galla's food for many years and hope that they can continue to be successful, but felt compelled to speak out about the increasing number of poor experiences I have had recently."},{"name":"Atlas","address":"88 W Paces Ferry Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"UPDATE: recently saw that Atlas received four stars from AJC's Jennifer Zyman, yet her review said the food was \\"fine,\\" add she felt, as I did, that there was lack of cohesion and purpose in the dishes...but everything else constitutes four stars...? I know the food isn't everything when it comes to a restaurant review but ffs, it should count for 80%... If creative loafing deems \\"fine\\" food worthy of dour stars, then that explains why restaurants in Atlanta don't even try...\\n\\nDined here a few nights ago, and it was pleasant. First off, I understand the chef de cuisine is a TFL veteran, but I don't think they should have pretty much jacked their groove with the very familiar door at the entrance, albeit it was brown. Other tha. That, the atnosphere near the front is very chill with the fireplace and red leather seats. We pretty much ordered all the apps since none of the entrees stood out besides the rabbit. The salmon dish with trout roe and the mascarpone was very reminiscent of Keller's signature salmon cornettes, but nowhere as delicious, and extremely heavy. The oyster with cucumber tea and grapefruit could have been great, but was actually washed out in flavor, but the quality of the oy ster was great- just wish there was less cucumber (for once) and more ocean. The hiramasa was excellent: well cured, great flavors, though slightly too sweet, great dish in adjustted proportions. The scallops were another great dish, cooked perfectly with bright flavors, and nothing overpowering the scallops. The potato leek chowder was cooked well, but I really only enjoyed the leek in it. I wish I had chosen something other than the rabbit as a main since although the dish seemed rustic, theflavors just didnt do much. The kumquat and Riesling braised cabbage were great with the loin, but everything else seemed more like a filler. This place has great potential, so ill be back around spring looking for some vibrant dishes. Oh, and the honey wheat bread is one of the best baked breads I've ever had. The flavor itself was meh, but the bread was cooked ridiculously perfect, with a flaku crispy crust and cloud like inside- bravo. The butter is also served at a great temperature.\\nForgot to add, I got a mixed drink, and there was a serious lack of alcohol.

This is a cool and unique idea! Homemade marshmallows are a fun treat and the concept isn't anything I've ever seen. \\n\\nBut here are some problems I see, and hopefully the owners read these things and take it into consideration.\\n\\nThe shop almost always looks closed or empty. The inside is nice, however the walls are stark bare. I would love to see Wondermade use some of the photos I've seen them post on Facebook, blow them up really big (like close-up's of marshmallow, etc.) and either have them made to wall canvas or matted & framed. They need some serious decor. My neighbor went today and it was her first time. She told me it looked like they are just moving in or something. Fill up the walls with some of your own shots using a vintage filter to give it that \\"Wondermade\\" feel.  \\n\\nNext, add something more flashy outside the door when you're open. Some colorful balloons tied to a good-sized hot air balloon statue or something. People don't know you guys exist with the way you've got it going now. Marketing needs work to draw in customers. \\n\\nGranted, this isn't my business, but I'm going to guess that the way Wondermade stays in business is probably 85% online orders. I can't imagine what they are paying in rent, and it's a shame when the place has never looked crowded. Why aren't you guys saving your money and doing an online store only, or even doing the Farmers Market on Saturdays and getting rid of your overhead? It's bizarre. I'd hate to see this business crash and burn because it's such a cute concept. But I can't fathom how much longer it can be successful in Downtown Sanford without more street revenue. You NEED customers coming in off the street. Which brings me to another point..\\n\\nIs it so amazing that I would literally leave my home and drive down to Sanford (I'm 10 mins away) to grab an almost $3 s'more? No. I would not.  I'm not sure how many customers they could possibly have that love it so much they crave it and head down there. What you are getting for the $ isn't much and it's possibly overpriced. The boxes are adorable which could be why there is a markup on price, or maybe it's the rent. Either way, we need more product or more WOW factor.  Again, most of their clientele HAVE to be random walk-ins or online sales.  \\n\\nNeighbor goes today and comes back with not-so-great reviews. She tells me that there was no menu in sight. Nothing but packaging boxes, and the young girl behind the counter isn't very helpful either.  Guys, put a nice menu up on the wall. Something that looks cool. Just do it. And include the pricing. That's a major turn off and it makes it look like you're hiding the price because you don't want to turn people away (meaning, it's overpriced for what you are getting.)  She didn't leave impressed. \\n\\nMy last suggestion would be that they blast this thing out of the water if they truly intend on becoming the next most popular shop down there across from the Willow Tree. Marshmallows alone aren't cutting it. Can you throw in some other fresh, homemade candy? Caramels?? Chocolates?? Taffy??? Something that brings that sweet candy smell out into the street. I know they brought in a little ice cream thing but I really feel like that's not going to get the job done. Wonderworks is unique, as I mentioned before, but it's obviously not unique enough to have people lining up out the door.  I sound critical, but it's just truth. I hope they succeed and become an awesome attraction in Sanford, but I also hope they take the advice of the patrons who will be bringing in the cash flow!"},{"name":"Villa Nova Ristorante","address":"5545 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Stopped by for lunch when going through Columbus.

I'm a vegetarian but it looked like a friendly enough place, so i stopped in to see what they had to offer.

Even if you eat meat, skip the ribs one trip and try it. \\n\\nI've tried similar sandwiches all over Boulder, and being a veggie-friendly town, most are excellent... but this one put them all to shame. \\n\\nThey also had quite a few bottled beers, some good draft options, and a good sized wine list.

I got \\"The Santa Fe\\": a cumin festival with chicken (or shrimp, or both if you choose), black beans, and corn served on a bed of rice, accented with some fresh chopped tomatoes.

That's how I felt at Jiko. From the wild boar tenderloin and inguday tibs in brik, to the Taste of Africa spreads and the bread, oh the bread, my meal could've ended there and I would've been happy. Thankfully though, there was more. \\n\\nIt was my first time to the Animal Kingdom Lodge and let me just say, I've definitely added a Disney must do to my list! To be able to wake up and see zebras, giraffes and more right outside your window? I mean, come on! I'm a hotel junkie (meaning, I have a weird adoration for staying at hotels), and fell in love with this place. Next time, I'd arrive to dinner early just to walk around before the sun sets.\\n\\nBack to the meal. Our server was super friendly and made a great recommendation on one of the most important parts of the meal, the wine. We got a Black Pearl red wine from South Africa which complemented all of our food perfectly. With a little left in a bottle, she was able to seal it back up so we could take it home! Always a perk. \\n\\nMy favorite appetizer was definitely the aforementioned wild boar tenderloin. Now, the menu is very authentic so words like mealie pap and chakalaka, although fun to say, probably don't mean a lot to you so we asked a lot of questions. This dish was sweet from the veggie chutney (similar to a pisto?), and creamy from the grits-like mealie pap underneath. Most importantly, the meat simply melted in your mouth. I wanted the whole thing for myself!\\n\\nThe inguday tibs in brik was similar to a samosa with spinach and cheese. Definitely recommended! Now, I couldn't stop eating all the bread. Especially to clean up scraps from these appetizers. That alone is a reason to order the Taste of Africa which comes with three different spreads.\\n\\nFor my main, I went with the garam masala-spice sea scallops with warm bacon and spinach salad, and pilau. I was really impressed with the size of the scallops and absolutely loved the spinach and bacon salad. I couldn't even finish it all so glad I went with a lighter dish but was definitely eyeing the lamb shank next to me. Would love to try a filet next time. \\n\\nCan't forget the MAC AND CHEESE we all shared. It had four different types of cheese, sausage, and the chakalaka. It might have been a little much with all the other food we had on our table but, as a mac and cheese fan, I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nDessert, oh, dessert. Just when we thought we couldn't go any longer, we got a Ghanaian Chocolate and Kenyan Coffee Pot de Cr√®me to share. Just do it if only for a bite. \\n\\nThe rest: It's expensive, yes.

Ichiban definitely chose to do the ladder.\\n\\nI enjoy eating at different places and I give everything a chance, but if a place only serves a menu that is basically 90% tempura shrimp or include tempura flakes on everything, there's got to be something wrong.\\n\\nI ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer: chewy. I ordered a plum sake as a drink: mediocre. I ordered four rolls: horrifying. We did order a roll that included tempura shrimp because of the limited options, but they put so much batter on one of the shrimps that it resembled chicken! Also, all of the rolls tasted similar... everything was bland and I couldn't really distinguish each roll because they covered almost each one with tempura flakes or spicy mayo (which didn't have a flavor to it either). Even the rice seemed like they didn't put enough (or possibly any) rice vinegar at all.

As the name suggests, this buffet is different than any other on Disney property. This one is best enjoyed by those with an adventurous pallet. I'd go again for the soups, alone. I particularly enjoyed the Cape Malay Lamb Curry, the carrot ginger soup and the Tunisian seafood stew. As for desserts...people lose their minds over the Zebra domes. Pretty tasty!\\n\\nAt 38.00 per person one really can't go wrong here unless they simply refuse to try new things. With \\"flavors of Africa\\" in the restaurant's name, they're telling you right up front, you will not find burgers, pizza or lasagna, here. You will; however, be treated  to a wonderful selection of African cuisine... The atmosphere is pretty much what you would expect at The Animal Kingdom resort. Heavy African theme, complete with a tribal drum (at opening time) welcome. \\n\\nBoma is located inside the larger Jambo House. You may want to leave yourself some time before or after your visit (if you're not staying here) so you can roam around and check out some of the animals that are on property. There are plenty of observation points/balconies just off of the hotel lobby.\\n\\nBe sure and follow me on Yelp for all my Disney reviews. I'm updating a number of them, now.

The dosa's crepe like texture was something I have never had before, light & crunchy, and it's flavors exploded in my mouth with each bite.  I have to go back and try more dosa's!  The lunch buffet was very good, just needed the chafing dishes to keep the food hotter.  Basmati rice, chicken tikka masala, samosas, all met my expectations.  What was interesting to observe was the crowd that poured in filling the restaurant to capacity within the hour I was there.

My girlfriend (at the time) & I started visiting this location frequently as we're both members of Gold's Gym (now Fitness CF) right up the street. Furthermore, she was a bikini competitor & I was just looking to get into my first show. We loved FitLife foods & promotes it regularly on our social media platforms & referred other fit-conscious people. We ended up inviting & physically bringing in about 7 guests with us in 1 month to introduce them to FitLife Foods! Then, our shows were approaching.\\n\\nAbout 2 & a half months out from our shows, we inquired with the manager about possible sponsorship. We proposed that we could continue actively promoting FitLife Foods on our social media platforms & with our network in the local community, as well as physically driving traffic to the establishment, in exchange for the meals we would need to help us win our competitions just over two months down the line. To some it may sound like a lot, but to entrepreneur they know the long-term value we were bringing would far exceed the cost of the meals. Again, 2 months of meals for continued social media promotions & physical traffic that may yield repeat business & potentially even a few life-long customers. ..The manager was excited to see what they could do, but after a couple of weeks of correspondence & talks with corporate, ultimately she wasn't able to fulfill our request. We were sorely hurt as we had been promoting them & driving traffic to their business for over a month before we even proposed the idea. Also, meal prepping is a big part of competing & it was both of our weaknesses. Needless to say, we stopped going to FitLife Foods.\\n\\nJust recently, with that having been a couple years ago, I figured I'd give FitLife Foods another shot! I've already gone 3 days in a row now & am sad I missed out over the last 2 years. I love the variety of prepped, clean food, & the atmosphere inside the small shop. The staff is super friendly, just as they always were. Kudos! And the fact that they have microwaves & a counter to sit at to eat your meals on the spot is crucial! Not to mention, it's less than 5 minutes from the gym (Fitness CF), so you can be sure to catch that anabolic window after your workout where you need to feed your hungry muscles.\\n\\nI still love FitLife Foods!

It was bound to be a busy visit at the Magic Kingdom, but a week prior to our departure, we checked for dinner reservations at Be Our Guest and we scored a 4:50pm dinner reservation.  **Pro tip: Always check several weeks before your departure - even though people book dinner months in advance, cancellations pop up and you can score a reso! \\n\\nAlso note that Breakfast and Lunch do not have the same fanfare as the dinner service, so keep that in mind (Breakfast is fast casual and Lunch is casual dining).\\n\\nAfter checking in for our reservation in front of Be Our Guest, we are escorted to some pretty expansive double doors which swing open to invite you to the Beast's castle.  For theming, I will have to give Disney some major props because you feel like you've been whisked away into a beautiful ballroom.  There are three main halls you can dine in:  The Grand Ballroom (where we sat), The West Wing (which features the Beast's dying rose and his torn portrait) and a third ballroom that I dubbed \\"Belle's room\\" because it features a giant music box of Belle and the Beast dancing and portraits of her many adventures with the household staff.\\n\\nWe were seated in the middle of the ballroom and even though we were a full week into January already, the Christmas decorations were still up.  No matter!  Be Our Guest does serve alcohol only for their dinner seating, so my husband opted for a beer while I went with a sweeter white wine.  For our dinner, I opted for the signature dish - Saut√©ed Shrimp and Scallops\\nwith Lobster, Mushrooms, and Seasonal Vegetables in a creamy Lobster Sauce.  My husband, however, got the Braised Pork (Coq au Vin Style), featuring \\"Eight Hour Slow-cooked Pork with Mushrooms, Onions, Carrots, and Bacon served with Pur√©ed Cauliflower and Seasonal Vegetables.\\"  \\n\\nThe service was great and both of us were pretty pleased with our dishes and it left just enough room for dessert.  Our server wheeled out an impressive dessert cart and we decided on desserts.  I had to get the \\"Grey Stuff\\" because I'm told it is delicious, and it was.  The best way I can describe it is, the mousse is made from Oreo cookies that have been blended into a splendid grey frosting on top of a crisp chocolate cookie.  Husband got the lemon meringue cupcake, which was a bit on the dry side but he devoured nonetheless.\\n\\nAfter your dinner, you can take your time browsing all three rooms, taking photos, and soaking in the atmosphere before you are ushered into a final \\"exit\\" room where you can take a photo with The Beast, because he is your host after all.  Once you take your photo with The Beast, you conclude your experience at Be Our Guest.\\n\\nOverall, for \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" fans looking for a good meal with loads of theming, this restaurant is a  must-visit if you're at Walt Disney World.  I'm glad I crossed it off my list but it's unlikely I would return for dinner - while, I love the film, I found it underwhelming.  I was hoping for more entertainment or something that would entertain for the price tag, but I've heard that they have undergone many changes since it first opened."},{"name":"Bellmont Caffe","address":"80 Leonard St","city":"Belmont","stars":"4","text":"The food here is excellent and the owner is very pleasant to deal with .

For those of you in the magical world of Disney, it's \\"as good as it gets.\\"  By far, the best meal of our stay.\\n\\nJiko is one of Disney's \\"Signature Dining\\" restaurants, which in theory is equivocal to upscale or fine dining, and therefore justifies the high price tag even by Disney standards.  In reality, not always the case, but Jiko did live up.  Although Disney apparently relaxed it's dress code somewhat, you'll find many diners here actually make an attempt to look like they did not just step off of the Kali River Rapids water ride.  \\n\\nJiko is billed as a fusion of African, Indian, and Mediterranean cuisines and accomplishes what many restaurants at Disney fail to deliver...food with flavor and excellent service!  We arrived nearly 2 hours before our reservation since we left the park early, and the staff was very accommodating and we had only a short wait.  Upon being seated, we were presented with an anniversary card signed by all the staff in their native languages!\\n\\nWe started with the seared ostrich filet, which was delectably tender and well-seasoned.  We also had the Taste of Africa, three dips and an assortment of breads and naan.  I love samplers, fantastic concept!  For my entree, the swahili curry shrimp, served with coconut rice.  It was spicy enough to bring a tear to my eye.  I was so happy to find not everywhere in Disney is afraid to put a little heat in the food.  We were also given a small complimentary dessert for our occasion, but of course, we had full-sized desserts as well which were fantastic as well.\\n\\nThe only downside to the meal was the entertainment provided by the family seated across from us.  Mom never ate, and dad must have taken a half dozen cigarette breaks to get away from their out-of-control children.

I do like how they do NOT salt the fries and let me choose how to season them. Also like the soda selection but the bottles are overpriced. Try the smaller sized burger as it's juicier. The big ol' burger is too much meat and not enough seasoning, feels like I'm eating a big hunk of unseasoned ground beef when I get the half pounder or whatever it is. They should mix in some egg and seasoning to make it more interesting. Staff is always friendly. Love the foot thing on the mens room door so I don't have to use my freshly washed hands to open the door. The wait here can be really loooooong on a busy day, and it's hard to hear when they call out your name as there is nothing in here to absorb the dull roar of conversation. The fresh lemonade is really good but again expensive. I don't like the small wavy french fries they serve, would prefer steak fries or just thicker version of the fries. I'm going to stick with 5 guys burgers and fries but this place is a solid second choice or great place for lemonade or a shake.

They also, offer La Croix sparkling water which is a perfect compliment with your pizza. In some of the comments I have read that their service is slow but I have to disagree!! For one thing they make each pizza by hand and it takes time to do that! Second of all every single time I have been there I have always received my pizza in a timely manner! So for those of you who are reading these reviews, I highly suggest you ignore the comments regarding the time! I am a regular customer and have never had a problem with that!

The texture is incredible, the flavors well developed and complex. It's a pretty decent serving for a single donut as well (as it should since they're about $2.50-$3 each). But they are intensely sweet - you have to order a coffee just to balance it out. As long as you keep that in mind and don't have more than one at a time, you'll be fine. \\n\\nIf you order anything with a glaze, be sure to grab some extra napkins.

(I had them put the roe on the side, so it did not touch my other food and I had no trouble passing this off to another eager dining companion).  The tartare was perfect.  The scattering of other flavor enhancers on the plate worked beautifully.  This was light and delicate and a nice way to start the four courses.\\n\\nMy Primi was the \\"Tortelloni\\" (Cure Farm Fava Bean, Lamb Sausage, Spring Onion and Mint).  This was good, but was probably my least favorite course.  The pasta was nice, the sauce was rich, and the spring onion bits were some of the best things I had all night.  However, the sausage seemed a tad dense and overly mild.\\n\\nMy Secondi was the \\"Agnello\\" (Boulder Lamb, Cure Farm Cauliflower, Curry, Almond and Champagne Grape).  If my lamb could always be this good, I would order it much more frequently.  It was very tender, not the slightest bit gamey, richly delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The crispy pieces or cauliflower were a great contrast and intensely flavorful.\\n\\nMy dessert (Dolci) was the Torta di Olio di Oliva (Meringue, Ligurian Olive Oil Cake, Raspberry, Blackberry, Blueberry and Zabaglione).  Great flavor and texture.  The tart berries on the side cut the richness of the cake perfectly.\\n\\nFinally (well, firstly and somewhere in the middle) I had two exquisite and potent cocktails.  The Planter's Punch (Suerte Tequila, Cocchi Americano, Pineapple Gomme Syrup, Lemon Juice & Absinthe).  And the Old Tom Smash (Ransom Old Tom Gin, Yellow Chartreuse, Nonino Amaro, Fresh Strawberry, Lemon Juice& Rhubarb Syrup).

So much fun that we vowed we'd book this show again on any and all  return trips, no question about it. We returned to WDW last week and booked the show again. I was a little apprehensive approaching the date hoping that I wasn't just exaggerating my memory of our first experience.  Nope. We had a BLAST!!  The characters are endearing the and the jokes are corny but it's all super-clean family fun. At several points during the show I looked around and every single person  at our table (ages 9 to 78)  was full-on belly laughing. It was great! The food was actually very, very good. I didn't have terribly high expectations of the quality considering they put on THREE dinner shows a night and have to seat a saloon hall full of people at each show. However, the fried chicken was extremely moist and well-seasoned and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender. The bbq sauce on the ribs was sticky-sweet (yum!) and the cowboy beans were chock-full of chunks of tender beef. Mash taters were better than average and the cornbread (on the sweet side) was yum-yum too. If I had to gripe about anything, it would be the beer selection. Only option is Bud-Light and, frankly, that is an insult to real beer. Love, love, love beer but I'd rather drink room-temp tap water than that swill. I opted for the Sangria (wine snobs can go ahead and laugh here - I don't mind!) and it was was just fine. Yes, HDD is pricey but it is absolutely, positively worth every penny. Next time we hit WDW we'll try and book this show for our last evening at the parks.

We were greeted at the door by a beautiful and charming woman, whom we later learned is a co-owner with her husband (she is Mongolian! he is Japanese). I think my husband and son are in love! The menu is small but offers plenty of variety. The owner suggested my husband order the mussels as an appetizer (we don't eat meat or poultry) and he raved about them. I had the tiger shrimp which was nice, though not spectacular, and my son had the chicken wings, which he thought were terrific. The appetizers were very reasonably priced.\\n\\nFor our main course, my husband and I had the Chilean Sea Bass which was really wonderful. My son raved about his salmon. All this was served in an unrushed (but not too slow) style by an attentive staff. \\n\\nFor dessert, there was only the durian parfait and a fruit salad.

It is quite a popular restaurant and bar.  So, you are likely to going to have a wait at peak meal times.  Drop in and they'll put your name on a list, hand you a paging device then step over to the separate bar area to imbibe in  some adult beverages.  The wait is not too unreasonable, maybe 30 minutes.  \\n\\nThe d√©cor on the walls is a mixture of pictures and collectibles of copper pots, license plates and gauges.  The decorations have been around for quite a while and might even use a good dusting.  The bar has its own separate area that is usually standing room only during peak times.   They do serve meals at the bar, if you don't want to wait for a table, and has TV's for watching the news or a game.  \\n\\nRestaurant seating is separate from the bar area, but can still be quite noisy.   It's good for groups and families.  Seating can be quite tight, however, as they try to make the most of the available space.  Their menu has a wide sampling of traditional Italian faire, (i.e. soups, subs, pizza's, pasta dishes and main entree's).   I recommend checking out their specials of the day.   Overall, their food is \\"okay\\".   It's good comfort food.   Portions are quite filling.  Side salads are out of a bag with some croutons tossed on top.   Soups are more broth as opposed to being hearty.  Garlic sticks are out of a bag and not warmed.   Usually ample sauce and cheese on their pasta dishes.   Their pizza's usually have a good amount of toppings on them.  Menu prices are competitive and quite reasonable.\\n\\nThe service on the restaurant side is rather hit or miss.   They are often efficient and fast, but too many times I leave the restaurant feeling like the wait staff simply just does not want to be there.  That carries over to how welcome I feel as a customer when I walk out the door.  A typical experience has been that when they bring out your salad they will just \\"drop\\" them right in front of you.  All the wait staff are not like this, but my experiences are the staff are more like this than not.   It can be a challenge to get your server's attention when you need him or her and they are not always responsive for keeping your drinks full. \\n\\nVilla Nova is quite a local popular place.   Their menu is mostly Italian, reasonably priced and good place to take the family or hang with a group.   Service could be more personable and attentive, but is efficient.  I likely will return again when out with friends as I have been here a number of times over the years, but there are so many other good Italian restaurant options available that I likely will go for more of my own first choices."},{"name":"Ginger Root Chinese Cuisine","address":"136 Adams St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered  a delivery at 4:06 and was told it would be 40 minutes.

It's not bad, but you know that you're not in a \\"trendy\\" restaurant -- you're in a place that cares about the food and the customers more than keeping up with the Joneses. There is a mural on the wall painted in 1982 by a friend of the owners. He comes over from France occasionally to touch it up. You have to love this type of dedication to food and friends.\\n\\nThe prix fixe menu is a bargain. I had pork rilette (pate), steak with roquefort sauce, and chocolate mousse.

The chocolate mousse is served without frills, but I imagined how it might have tasted with a blackberry-pepper reduction.

Back then, we were super impressed with the restaurant, rating it our favorite dining experience at Disney World. Unfortunately, Disney has not maintained the exceptional level of service and food quality that the restaurant used to have, and we were fairly underwhelmed with our meals this time. Here's a rundown of our experience, as well as what's changed in the last two years.\\n\\n1) The service: A bit disappointing this time. First of all, while we had a reservation, we still had to wait about 20 minutes after arriving for a table. This was despite there being quite a few open tables when we walked in. Our server was nice enough, and our food came out in a reasonable time, but the magical, attentive, detailed service we received last time was simply not there. \\n\\n2) The food: A big drop in quality and size since last time. Looking back on our photos from our last experience, the portion sizes have decreased substantially and the prices have risen. Although we had an appetizer, entrees, and deserts, we were definitely still hungry when we left. This was pretty unacceptable considering how much the meal cost (over $100 for the two of us), and also considering that we were able to eat our fill and still have leftovers at a different famed Disney restaurant the following evening (Sanaa) for slightly less money. As for the food quality, the pork tenderloin was just ok (it came out pretty dry), and the \\"grey stuff\\" desert was not nearly as good as it used to be. My lamb was actually pretty tasty and cooked well, but again, the portion size was really small. \\n\\n3) Drinks: Wine choices were pretty good, but much pricier than last time.\\n\\nYes, the theming of the restaurant is pretty cool, and it's fun to meet the \\"Beast,\\" but the dining experience is no longer what it was a couple years ago. Sadly, Be Our Guest has definitely become an overpriced and overrated restaurant that's no longer worth the difficult process to get a reservation or long wait for a table."},{"name":"Chile Verde","address":"4852 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I had my birthday party in Chile Verde last night.

Beauty and the Beast is my absolute favorite Disney movie, so when I found a breakfast reservation I snagged it quick. I really wanted to book a dinner reservation, but our trip was last minute (52 days out) and this is one of the more coveted restaurants. For breakfast and lunch it's a quick-service restaurant, which I guess means you do most of the work yourself, there are no character appearances, and the customer service is lacking. \\n\\nThe cast member that handed me a menu gave me two and when I asked for a third she condescendingly stated, \\"we'll just have to share\\". I didn't realize that there weren't enough menus for each person in every dining party to have one of their own. I figured she miscounted when she handed them to me or maybe that she heard me incorrectly when I stated there were three people in my party. There was certainly so reason for her tone. I brushed it off and continued to the line. Once you step into the actual restaurant it's complete chaos. It's loud and there are several signs with instructions on what to do. It's a bit nerve-wracking with everyone trying to read and keep track of everyone in their party, but the line moves fairly quickly. It's very much like an assembly line. \\n\\nThe next cast member we saw was the one directing people where to place their orders. I'm not sure what system they use for deciding, but the options are to either have another cast member put in your order or use the kiosk to place your own order. We were directed to a kiosk that already had a group placing their order. They were having trouble and we watched as people in line behind us moved along. It would really help if a cast member were stationed at each kiosk to help guests. Instead there was one cast member to help with all of the kiosks and everyone seemed to need help. \\n\\nAfter we placed our order we walked into the first dining room. It was beautiful for sure, but other than that I'm not sure what all the hype is about. We took the first set of seats we could find. A cast member happened to be cleaning the table at the time and seemed annoyed that we were waiting for it. It just wasn't as \\"magical\\" as I had expected it to be. It might be a completely different experience at dinner, but if that's the case perhaps it shouldn't be offered as a quick-service location.

Totally a win for a bunch of foodies. We were placed in this private dining room located back-center of the restaurant and it was enclosed which really set the mood for our experience. It was like eating dinner in a museum at midnight. Totally stunning. I recall thinking \\"thank God there are walls around us because we look ridiculous taking pictures of everything.\\"....yes we were those people...\\n\\nThe food was fantastic. I will say you really should take advantage of the shared plates concept in order to enjoy this restaurant. If you're going here for a steak and a side of mashed potatoes and you're really hungry it doesn't make sense to come here. It's not that type of situation. The concept is to explore in every sense of the word \\"explore.\\" The plates are based on a certain region of the world I believe the chef sorts this out and than a portion of the menu remains constant. We simply got one of everything and shared amongst our party. It was great and everyone was very pleased with the food and the flavors. The cocktails were so interesting and full of kick. \\n\\nDon't hesitate go check out The Consulate and two tips of advice walk around left of the deck it's on the side of the building down the steps (we got lost lol) and bring  your imagination!

I usually don't hold a grudge, but I gave you a couple chances and you never fail to disappoint me. \\n\\nFirst visit. A friend I haven't seen in some time and I sat at the bar to catch up and have a couple drinks and a snack. Mexican martinis. Not bad. Nursing 2 of them over a three hour period, we tried to order another round. Bartender tells me \\"There is a two drink limit.\\" \\"OK\\", I say \\"...I'll have a beer then.\\"  \\"No...two Mex martinis and NOTHING else. You're cut off.\\" Seriously? Nursing 2 over 3 hours, completely sober and I'm cut off. All the while the sloppy young lady to my left was so drunk, she was falling off her chair, yelling, and slurring...but SHE can have another drink? \\"I didn't know about this policy. Where is it written?\\" I ask politely. The reply...\\"Not my problem.\\" \\"We're obviously sober. Can you make an exception, since we really didn't know and were not made aware of this policy?\\" I ask politely. Bartender...walks away. OK, we ask for the check. Making sure he sees me pay, I make sure to slide a solitary penny his way with a big grin. He calls me some colorful name. I wave and smile. This angers him more. More obscenities. I'm entertained. I blow him a kiss while walking away. Didn't stick around to see what that did.\\n\\nFast forward about three years. Much to my disapproval, some friends really really wanted to go here for lunch. The day was a lovely one, so we sat outside. Nice space...until that crazy screeching over the loudspeaker! WTF was that? It's to scare the birds off. OK...actually pretty funny. Service was better this time. Stoic waitress was very efficient. Not friendly, but efficient. Food straight up sucked. No flavor and overpriced.

Oh, and because they use special olives from Spain (I know a Whole Foods Castelvetrano when I taste one), you'll be charged $0.50 per additional olive you request in your dirty martini. That means you'll pay $13/martini (if you get three olives like we did). In a restaurant in the mall. UGH.\\n\\nThis place gets a few things right: the fresh hummus on the tapas menu was on point; the anchovy-stuffed olives were weird and tasty; and the fluffy pita bread was top-notch. The sangria is yummy, as were the other cocktails we sampled (e.g. Jack Rose and The Maple Leaf); however, the fuckery (excuse my language, but I'm pissed) with the olives and the extra $2/martini almost negated Fino's yumminess. \\n\\nThey also seem confused about what time Happy Hour is since most of their printed materials (and their website) list Happy Hour as 5-7pm, although it's apparently been changed to 4-6pm. \\n\\nAnyway, if you don't have anywhere else to go in Austin, DON'T go here.

I started out with a bloody mary and was pleased to see it came with a large piece of celery and was just spicy enough to jump start my morning. Then I went for the sweet potato fries as an appetizer with Eggs Benedict being my main course. The fries were sweet and crisp with a zingy mustard accompanying them. The Eggs Benedict, my favorite brunch dish, was one of the best I've ever had.

The menu describes the fried rice as being fried with carrots, peas, and eggs. It sounded like a pretty complete dish on its own, so I ordered a large. Although I debated adding tofu, I figured I'd be fine since I was buying such a large portion. The cashier's were friendly, service was fast, and leaving the restaurant with my fantastic-smelling takeout I thought I'd discovered a new favorite restaurant on campus.\\n\\nSo imagine my shock and disappointment when I got to the library, cracked open my laptop,] and carefully opened my box only to find a mountain of plain fried rice. I counted exactly two carrots, a few sickly-looking cooked pea skins, and not a single piece of fried egg in sight.\\n\\nI was now faced with either packing up my things, rewrapping my takeout, and braving the cold and wind to demand a full refund, or sucking it up and eating just enough of this lifetime supply of rice to sustain me for the night ahead. I chose the nibble on the rice and focus on my work, instead of storming back to the store to complain about the misleading menu. The rice, by the way, also tastes unlike any fried rice I've eaten before. It's more like plain steamed rice tossed in seasoning than anything else.\\n\\nIn the end, I'm extremely disappointed by this dining experience and, frankly, extremely upset that I spent my money on this below-par \\"meal\\" (it doesn't even deserve that title, honestly). I've attached a photo of the veggie-less, egg-less steam-fried rice to show I'm not exaggerating, if only I could capture exactly how disappointing it was to open the box.

It was great how they had three or four table-mounted outlets for work-groups who meet here, for plugging in their computers or whatever. Our waiter was a seasoned gentleman and he seemed to primarily focus on one lady in our party who was in the hospitality business. I was pretty much ignored. So much so that he forgot my napkin and later my cutlery. (He brought everyone else's though). While the waiter was talking to my friend, I made a point of taking the white linen napkin that served as a coaster under the wine bottle in the middle of the table. The waiter saw me take it and put it on my lap as I casually mentioned to my daughter that I didn't get a napkin. The waiter said nothing, continuing to chit-chat with my friend. Ditto when I asked my daughter to share her cutlery with me. I was not impressed with the service.\\n\\nThe food took quite a while to come out, as the waiter informed us (and later the manager) that they had moved the kitchen off-site, to an upstairs floor. Strange. But we were all chatting and having a great evening, so we didn't mind the wait.\\n\\nAnd I must admit, the food was really really good. My kid and I split a salad with brie and beets and it was fresh and delicious. My friends had various flatbreads which they loved. The cheese one was very rich but wonderful. The Sicilian one was equally wonderful. My daughter also had a tomato bisque which she raved about for hours. Yes, the food was terrific.\\n\\nThe next day when I visited for drinks, my friend had some wine and my daughter and I ordered tea. We had the same waiter. He made a few comments how tea service is the most involved due to all the pots and tea cups and tea selections. Not sure why he went on about this; perhaps to get a bigger tip? It was a little off-putting. But the tea was good, my friend's wine was good, and the ramekin of nuts and pretzels was surprisingly good, too. So no complaints here. \\n\\nAs noted by another reviewer, there isn't a huge food selection but what they have, they do very well, And they have a good wine selection, too.

There are multiple lines which go to different manned-machines where you order your meal. \\n\\nWe originally had plans for dinner but had to change to lunch on a different day because of family stuff. I was not really impressed with their options for lunch as nothing appealed to me. Next time I want to come for dinner. You can get the Grey Stuff cupcake anytime even if it's not listed on the menu. I didn't get to try it but I definitely will next time. \\n\\nAfter you order they give you a rose and you get to pick your seat in different areas. Hubby's favorite room was the ballroom as he liked the ceiling paintings and that it was in the movie. My favorite room was the East Wing, which had pictures both from and not from the movie. I especially loved the ones not from the movie because those are things you can only find here. The West Wing was all dark and scary, with the rose on a raised platform like in the movie and different things \\"torn up\\" around the room. I just wasn't impressed with it though. Maybe if they had more than two or three things torn up I would be impressed. But I guess the rose is supposed to be the star of the show.\\n\\nHubby said it would be better if they had some way to let you know how many tables were available in each room or if someone helped people find tables. After you find your seat you get to chill in the cool room until they bring your meal out in these really cool and fancy carts and find you by the rose you get when you order. \\n\\nApparently, Belle and Beast sometimes pop in while people eat, but not always. One customer actually left and had her entire family leave when she found out Beast and Belle wouldn't be making an appearance as they were in a parade at that time, so check ahead of time if that's going to be a deal breaker for you. It wasn't for me. It was a really fun experience and I would totally try it again and let hubby pick the room. \\n\\nUpdate: We returned for the Halloween events and ate in the West Wing since it fit! It was fun! We got breakfast this time and it came with assorted pastries which we all split up and devoured. The chocolate stuffed pastry was my favorite that I got to try. It was a lot of fun.

When I have, it's been good,   But what really impressed me about this place was the happy hour, which is the best one I know of currently in Austin, especially on Wednesdays.  \\n\\nOn Wednesdays they have $2 pints and $7 pitchers of ANY BEER in the place -- and they have some mighty fine beers.  We're talking Guinness, Trumer Pilsner, Fireman's 4, and a bunch of others I haven't even heard of.  Plus they have half price appetizers.  I went here with my girlfriend, and we got an order of chicken tenders and the spinach and artichoke dip, and it was almost too much for us to eat.  We got like ten large chicken tenders with the order, which would have been a bargain at the normal price of $8.59.  I'm not sure who pays normal price, though, as these specials apparently go on all night (at least on Wednesdays -- not sure about the other weekdays).  They also had live music, which was better than I expected for some random happy hour band at a pizza place.  \\n\\nDuring happy hour on other weekdays, pints are $2.50, and pitchers are $10.  Appetizers are still half price.  \\n\\nBesides the happy hours, I really like their new Chicago hot dogs.  These seem pretty authentic -- they've got almost all the same toppings I've had on hot dogs in Chicago (more than I can remember at the moment, really, but including onions, hot peppers, cucumber slices, and pickle relish), with the exception of tomato wedges.  It's still more toppings than you can comfortably fit on one hot dog, and it's a quality hot dog to boot."},{"name":"Canton Buddha","address":"2900 Peachtree Rd NW, Ste 115","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"By far the worst service I've ever received.

But otherwise, this pho totally hit the spot...I even managed to finish the entire bowl, which I usually can't do! It's true, you can really smell the cloves in this broth, and I love it. My Thai tea was really delicious and not as crazy sweet as I've had at other places. And I still can't believe how cheap Xinh Xinh is! Love the prices.

Because they don't take reservations for parties under 5, we assumed the wait wouldn't take too long (we should've expected it as it was on a Saturday night).  We thought we'd pass the time by enjoying a cocktail at the bar.  The wait was nearly 20 minutes, and this wouldn't have bothered me if there were stools by the bar.  We felt awkward standing in front of the room, and since the aisle between the bar and tables was very narrow, we felt like we were in the way of the hustle and bustle.  However, when the bartender, who I believe was the owner, greeted us with thick French accent and poured us two glasses of Kir Royale (Cr√®me de Cassis and Champagne), I found myself feeling far more relaxed. \\n\\nEverything that followed can only be described as a blur from which I emerged fulfilled in all dimensions--physical, emotional, and spiritual.  My only disappointment was the Escargot which, to my surprise, already shelled when it reached our table.  Some may actually prefer this, but as a seafood purist and an adventurous eater, half of the fun is removing the shells yourself and sucking the juices out.  Oh well.\\n\\nWhile I complained about the wait earlier, I did very much appreciate the longer than usual wait between courses.

While I have been in this brewery once - I had two sucessive Irish car bombs and left - I feel like tonight I should have tried said burger, and maybe my experience would have been less... less than average. Worst of all, my cousin is visiting from Maine and it was between Barley's and Tip Top, and I realised almost right away I should have taken her to Tip Top, which (I now know) is leagues above Barleys. \\n\\nIt was really loud in Barley's when we arrived around 7pm, and a cover band was setting up (imho they just provided an unwanted distraction and lots of \\"what?\\"s on our part as we tried to catch up and hang out).

I wasn't bowled over, but it certainly wasn't bad. It was dinner that was most ehhhh to me. When we saw the plastic flip-page menu, we knew this wasn't exactly what we'd been looking for - our discussion on the way over was about how the perfect menu is one page, printed often, with a few great choices. For some reason I thought Barleys would at least be more like Press Grill, with its casual atmosphere, and few great choices, albeit stand-bys (Thanksgiving Thursdays!!). But not so much. \\n\\nI didn't really find anything that tickled my fancy, and deciding not to go with the much-touted burger may have been my biggest culinary faux-pas. I had the turkey apple-bacon sandwich, was was a bit too greasy for me and came with a side of also slightly greasy pirogies. I ended up taking half the sandwich home, mostly because I just lost interest. My cousin had and enjoyed the portabella sandwich, but this definitely wasn't the experience we were after - especially not for the price!

The macaron I received was already cracked before I bit into it, and the filling completely squished out the other side. The stale shells themselves were completely hollow, and the macaron barely tasted like strawberry.

Whatever flavor you choose, you will not regret the wings, they are grilled and their flavor is delicious. You will end up licking your fingers for sure, on Wednesday Wings are just 65 cents but you have to order Minimum 5. \\n\\nOne thing that I must highlight, and one of the reasons I did not give more stars to this place.  They charge extra for the condiments, I understand that if you ask for extra condiments you will be charged but at least if you order wings you should come at least with a seasoning."},{"name":"Sabrozon Fresh Mexican Restaurant & Catering","address":"17770 Pilkington Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4.5","text":"I think I was expecting better food having read the reviews.

From the Reggie to the Wedgie to the one with flank steak, the sandwiches have it all packaged together in a delicious bundle. \\n\\nMy biggest complaint of PSB, however, is the lack of space. While waiting for your food (and it is a LONG wait), you are basically stepping over several other peope to get around.

When I finally get to sit down, too, it's even more uncomfortable, as I often bump elbows with the folks next to me while eating.\\n\\nOverall, the food is comforting, but the space is uncomfortable. While I have enjoyed everything I have ordered, the dine-in experience is bad enough that I have to knock off a star. Also, while the issues with waiting a long time to get your food is no different from any other quality breakfast establishment in town, I found that it is too easy to scarf down my food too quickly, especially in proportion to my wait. That leaves me often feeling like I didn't get to truly savor the meal, which is not really what I want to be feeling out of breakfast.

My first visit to Blue Star was about four years ago in Los Angeles. With the knowledge that Blue Star Donuts originated in Portland, it was a must that I visited Blue Star during my trip to Portland. Also, don't worry about the cost per donut (~$3-4). The price is just a number here; it's worth it. Here are some more specific thoughts: \\n\\nDonuts: When it comes to picking flavors of donuts, I try to go for the most creative and unique. Most of the donuts here are distinct, with some uncommon flavors that you might not normally be exposed to. My girlfriend and I ordered the blueberry bourbon basil, passionfruit cacao nib, the O.G (horchata glaze), and the chocolate buttermilk. My favorite is the blueberry bourbon basil. This is a \\"must get\\" for first timers. Don't worry, the basil taste isn't strong, but enough if you enjoy basil. Also, the flavor is really light. The passionfruit cacao nib donut did indeed taste like passionfruit. It was a little too sour tasting for my liking. The O.G donut was also one of my favorites. The horchata glaze is light and not overbearing. Definitely does taste like the horchata drink! The chocolate buttermilk has an early grey flavor to it, and the consistency is similar to cake batter. This donut is on the heavier side. I would recommend some coffee for this donut. In all, the dough's consistency, and lightness of a bluestar donut is ultimately what separates them from the rest of the competition.  You won't feel bloated after eating a Blue Star donut. Blue Star does sell coffee and other beverages alongside their donuts.\\n\\nAmbiance: Blue Star is clean inside, with a modern feeling. The glass is clean and the floors are swept. There are a couple of tables inside for enjoyment. It is a spacious place, but everyone hovers over where the donuts are on display, and taper off along the walls of the shop to take pictures and check into yelp. :p \\n\\nService: The employees are all kind and willing to answer any questions, or provide recommendations on which flavor you should order. \\n\\nIn conclusion, Blue Star donuts is a must go to if you've never experienced it before.

Our waitress, Chesley (that's how it was spelled on our receipt...chesley or chelsey aka rudest waitress) in my opinion, should not be working as a waitress if she doesnt like to wait on people. First of all, we sit down and we ONLY get salsa, no chips.  Ummm, who brings just salsa with no chips??! Our waitress tells us 'the chips are being cooked and will be out in a minute'.  We wait and we wait and we stare at our salsa, stare at each other, and 15 minutes pass and no chips nor does she come by to check on us.  In the meantime, I see another waiter bringing chips out to multiple tables, yet we dont have any chips because ours are apparently being specially 'made'. We finally see her and ask for some chips as shes rushing by our table.  She didnt even stop at our table or even make eye contact.  And this is how she treats us the entire time. Like its some chore to do her job and check on us.\\n\\nAfter we finally get chips, my drink is almost empty.  The waitress NEVER comes by to ask me or my boyfriend how we are doing, if we need anything, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  So then our food comes and someone else brings it out.  My boyfriend had asked for a side of french fries instead of mashed potatoes with his meal and our waitress acted like it wasnt a big deal to make the substitution BUT she failed to tell him there was a $2 substitution fee. But when his order comes out, guess what, no french fries.  I tell the lady who brought the food out that we asked for fries not potatoes.  She finds the waitress and I hear her tell our waitress they asked for fries and the waitress says, 'oh i forgot to put that on the order, didnt I'?  OK, so then a manager comes to our table to apologize and tell us the french fries will be out in 2 minutes.  Well, by the time they get there were already almost done with our meal but whatever, we ate them. Keep in mind, our waitress still has NOT come by our table this entire time!!!! She didnt come by after our food was dropped off to ask us how our meal is or to apologize for HER MISTAKE. Nor does she ever come by to ask if we need drinks and she walked by our table a million times but nothing!!! I mean seriously??!! WTF!!? We are paying customers and you cant even come by our table besides to take our damn food order?!? This girl seriously needs a new job and Trudy's needs to hire staff that dont treat their paying customers like shit!!  Last night pissed me off and I will never eat there again. Oh and guess what, lovely Chesley still charged us $2 for the damn french fries when she forgot to put the order in.  Seriously, if we knew she was going to charge us after they were brought to us after our meal was there, we wouldnt have asked for them!!!  What kind of customer service is that?!  You make a mistake on our order and you still charge us?? Also, why does the side salad come out with the meal???  It should have come out before but of course it didnt. \\n\\nI used to love going to trudys but even the quality of the food has gone down.  I always get the chicken quesadilla and this time it was horrible.  There was no pico in it and it wasnt filled all the way.  Half of my quesadilla was just eating tortilla!! I paid $7 for 3 triangles barely filled with anything. That was a pricey tortilla I ate.  Wish I would have had been able to at least enjoy a margarita with my tortilla but that didnt happen because our waitress avoided us the entire time.\\n\\nBasically, if you didnt get what Im trying to say, the service sucks and there is no customer service at all.

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. I usually sit at the bar for drinks and order food there and haven't been disappointed. Bartenders are super helpful and attentive.\\n\\nHowever, sitting at a table can be hit or miss. I watched as one waitress was extremely attentive to all of the tables around us, getting their food promptly, letting them know the specials, and also any substitutions that had to be made on the menu that day. Unfortunately, she was not our waitress. \\n\\nWe sat for lunch at noon and were not leaving until almost 2:30 (a party of 3 adults and 1 child). Our waitress came over at 12:10 to ask us for drink orders. Water and drinks come out at 12:20, then she asks for our order. We overheard the other waitress explaining substitutions and specials, so after ordering some oysters, we asked our waitress if there were any specials today. She replied with, \\"No. We have no specials today. The menu is it.\\" We all looked at each other while looking at the other waitress' tables being served the specials. I also even walked through the dining area to check it out and sure enough, there were a few tables eating the special pasta dish being offered. I asked again and our waitress said that wasn't for outside (even though there were tables with the pasta dish outside). We drop the issue and place our orders by 12:30 - 3 burgers and one salad. Waiting for our food or to order another drink, our waitress can't be found, but the other waitress is floating to her tables, grabbing their food, again explaining more specials. Now's it's 1:15 and our food comes out. Burgers were ok. Toppings were excellent, but the patty tasted like a plain store bought patty that was overcooked. We just decided to eat and try and keep things moving since we had already been sitting for over an hour at this point. We finally flag down our server around 1:45 and ask her to wrap the leftovers and bring the check. Now, it's 2:00 and she brings over our food, but not the check, so we remind her again about the check. 2:15 and we finally have our check and immediately put cards in so that she can cash us out. 2:30 and we're finally done with lunch.\\n\\nChalk it up to a bad day for our server, but it got worse. I ordered my daughter a kid's burger, but she didn't want to eat the burger, just picked at the fries while we were at the table. When we got home, I offered the leftover salad and burger to my husband. He opened the box and ONLY HALF THE BURGER was placed in the to-go container.\\n\\nI call the restaurant that evening just to explain what happened and let it go because I didn't want to publicly post something negative about a place I usually like, but was unable to get through to anyone so I wait until the next day. I call again and finally get through to someone. I was placed on hold for 10 minutes until someone comes back on the phone to tell me that the manager is busy and can't take my call, but to leave a message and they'll get back to me later that day or Friday. I explain everything that happened, even through the person giggling on the other end of the phone.

The waiting area is pretty tight and crowded (we had a stroller with a sleeping baby) but made it work.\\n\\nThere were millions of tea flavours, but I chose the $30 afternoon tea set which meant I had NEVER-ENDING TEA! (Nobody needs this much tea, but it's nice to know you can sample a bunch so you're not just stuck with one flavour.) The demi-tea set is a more affordable option at $18 and includes 2 less finger sandwiches and a few less desserts and only 3 tea choices. (This would have been the better choice for me!)\\n\\nEach time we received a new tea, we got brand new tea cups... it was my favourite part to see all of the unique tea cups. (I'm obsessed with them and collect them of course!)\\n\\nThe food was good, the scones were good, finger sandwiches were all delicious as well... Overall it was a pleasant first \\"tea time\\" experience!\\n\\nI loved my experience so much that I came back the first week of January with my bestie and daughter for some more afternoon tea!

Parking, however, is plenty with many slots out front. The establishment itself is large and nicely put together with dark tables and clean tableware. \\n\\nThe menu offers more than just pho, such as other noodle dishes and broken rice plates. We, however, were in the mood for something soupy so we chose pho tai (rare steak strips) and pho ga (chicken). Service was friendly and, considering we were one of the few parties there, quite efficient. \\n\\nWhile we both ordered the small bowl, we were surprised to see that the bowls were indeed small (unlike in San Jose where the \\"small\\" is quite large). The ratio of noodles to broth was practically 50/50 and we liked how the broth wasn't oily or glistening with fat.\\n\\nWhile the pho tai had tender pieces of steak that cooked well in the broth, I wasn't nearly as impressed with my chicken pho. Firstly, the broth wasn't made from stewing chicken bones and the chicken itself was strangely grilled, making me believe that they use the same grilled chicken in their broken rice plates. Because the chicken was grilled, there were pieces of charred bits swimming in the broth and the broth itself was a tad sweeter than what I was used to.\\n\\nPrices are extremely reasonable (no sales tax to boot!) and the portions are expected.

We were sat down and taken care of pretty quickly and initially they checked in with us because I indicated on the reservation that my husband had a peanut and fish allergy. The waitress was kind to confirm that certain dishes wouldn't be appropriate for him but, it was a bit overkill after my husband was asked 4x..maybe more throughout the evening. We appreciated the safety concern, but it also caused a major delay in our service or so it appeared to. Our appetizer came out after a long period of waiting. We try not to compare wait time with other tables but it's hard when you see other groups with larger number of people and who sat down after you get their entree and you're still waiting for your appetizer. \\n\\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque - good, not stellar. Had it with the complimentary bread and it was fine. \\n\\nThe entrees were okay. Ok in size but if you're hungry.. I'd recommend adjusting your expectations for portion control. The portions were fine, but my husband was still hungry after he finished his tortellini dish and I was still hungry after the seafood bouillabaisse. Both meals had a beautiful presentation but the taste was mediocre. \\n\\nIt took so long for our dessert to come out. I'm talking at least 25 minutes after our entrees were cleared. Our server didn't tell us what we were having.. The dessert came out and while the presentation was impressive, the flavors didn't quite go together.  The raspberry macaron with lemon curd and the fresh raspberries were great if you like very tart/sour. The white chocolate chip cup with grey stuff.. was not as much of a show stopper as we expected. It was tasty nonetheless. The chocolate truffle was very rich - I mixed the Grey stuff with my truffle and it was pretty good. \\n\\nYou really do pay for the experience when you're here. I wish our experience was a bit better.. we weren't asked if we were celebrating anything and at times we really felt forgotten. If the ambiance wasn't so beautiful, I might give this a lower score.

CAUSE IT'S DELICIOUS!\\n\\nIf you are a fan of Beauty and the Beast, then there is no better experience than eating here for DINNER which does require reservations.  Sure, the dining quarters are the same for lunch.  However, eating here for lunch is more about getting your food and eating wherever you find a table.  Getting the full wait service during dinner makes waiting a few more hours to eat here completely worth it.  \\n\\nThe reservations for dinner usually need to be made about 6 months in advance supposedly, but i was able to check with the check-in stations for dinner cancellations and (thankfully) snagged a dinner reservation.  Unfortunately, this is only available if you have access to the Magic Kingdom.  Therefore, I would highly recommend going as early as possible.\\n\\nThey call groups of people based on the time of their reservation.  Once at the front of the castle, they then begin call out the name of the reservation and a host will guide you inside to the breathtaking view of the majestic ballroom where Belle and Beast have their first dance.  The West Wing of the restaurant features the iconic rose sealed in its glass as well as dark moody fixtures as expected from the movie.  The other wing is cute, but nothing too special.  I pray for anyone who dines here gets seated in the ballroom or West Wing, but I am not sure if that is within your control.\\n\\nThe wait staff also adds to the authenticity of the experience.  When we had asked where the Beast was, our waiter said, \\"He is very busy, but he may take time to come down.\\" And he does come out at regular intervals to greet guests at the end of your dinner service.\\n\\nFOOD-\\n\\nLemonade in Special Cup - My friends and I were sooo awestruck about the experience we were desperate to have something to remember our experience.  We thought we were buying unique cups that were only available at the restaurant, but if you walk to the Beauty and the Beast store a few feet away they carry the same cups!!  The lemonade was a little sweet and covered with a foam that slightly cuts the sweetness but not enough.  I would not recommend getting this unless you REALLY want something to take home.\\n\\nPan Seared Salmon on Leek Fondue-  The salmon was pretty standard and cooked well.  What I really loved was the potatoes that served as the bed for the salmon.  It was creamy and well seasoned.  I thought it was pretty good and would recommend if you prefer fish.\\n\\nLemon Meringue Cupcake - A very refreshing finish for the meal. The cake was spongy filled with a gooey lemon filling.  It was nice, but not as good as...\\n\\nGrey Stuff - Also available on a cupcake, the waiter brought out some on a plate for my friend to have since it was his birthday!  It is hard to explain because when asked what was in it, the waiter said \\"Mrs. Potts doesn't like to give out her secrets!\\"  I would describe it as a nutty, sweet, but not-to-sweet cream.

The restaurant was virtually empty when we arrived (just before 5pm), and upon entering were shown to a table that would accommodate four people.  When seated, a menu and two cups of tea were brought to our table.  So far so good.\\n\\nWe ordered what they called 'assorted beef in hot pot' - it came to our table on a plate, not in any hot pot - along with sides of a small salad (of thinly sliced onion and ?), and small serving of kimchi.  The beef offering was a totally un-flavourful mess -- a few slices of beef 'stuff', placed on and about a small mound of 'veggies', and the whole works sitting in what looked and tasted like a pool of water!!  The salad was 'ok', the kimchi was 'not', mostly just a few small chunks of cabbage 'ends', with little taste, and in no way representative of what kimchi is, or can/should be.\\n\\nAfter leaving the food at our table, the server never returned until I was able catch her attention, and request more tea.  She filled our cups, said nothing, and left - never to be seen again until I walked up and paid our bill.  Then the only thing she had to say was - \\"What, no tip?\\" - I told her to check the table.\\n\\nWe enjoyed some very good Korean food during this mini-stay in the area.

I would order any of these again! The old-fashioned donuts have the perfect bit of crunch. The glaze on each of the donuts was perfect without being too sugary.

Beautiful space.  Light and airy with bright colors.  It's hard to believe that dirty, dingy old Rife's Market used to be in this same space.  The food was delicious -- I had mac and cheese mixed in with BBQ pulled pork.  There's not much to say about it, as it was pretty straightforward, but those are two of my favorite comfort foods, so if you mix them together, I'm going to be happy.  I wish the portion had been a little bigger, but it was okay.  There were tons of other comfort food options that sounded amazing, and I look forward to going back and trying other things.\\n\\nThe service was so-so.  Typically when service isn't the greatest, it's because a server is either inattentive or rude.  Quite the opposite here.  We sat at the counter because the tables were full and the server just stood there in front of the two of us the entire time we were there, pretty frequently peppering us with awkward small talk questions.  We tried to politely brush him off, but he wouldn't be dissuaded.  It was really awkward.\\n\\nMy only other complaint was the price of beers.  We both had a couple of beers, which we wouldn't have done if we'd seen the prices.  I can't recall exactly how much, but they were about $7 for pints of decent, but not extraordinary beers.  That's our fault for not paying closer attention to the menu, but it felt out of line with the prices for the rest of the area.\\n\\nAll in all, a good trip.  Nice place with delicious food.

My husband and I like our food spicy and when we asked for \\"Indian Hot\\" they did it perfectly. This is in contrast to many other Indian restaurants that we have been to where the spiciness level is often hit or miss.  Another thing to mention is that we are vegan.  There are a few dishes that are already vegan on the menu, but many of them that are vegetarian can be made vegan per request (which we did).  They were so accommodating and everything tasted awesome.  You are presented with papadam and chutneys to snack on while perusing the menu - their chutneys are great!  We have had the lentil soup and the tomato soup to start, both of which were exquisitely flavorful and delicious.  We have had the following dishes: Tadka Dahl (Lentils), Bhindi Do Pyaza (Okra), Chana Masala, Baigan Ka Bharta (Eggplant), and the Madras Vegetable Curry.

It's basically kept the same menu as Shabu-Ya, but expanded to include an extensive tofu soup menu.\\n\\nI've been to the Allston location and loved it so I was extremely excited when I found out that Kaju Tofu house was opening up just a stone's throw from where I live.\\n\\nTonight, I went with 2 other friends and we ended up leaving almost no tip (which I've only ever done once before in my life). Here's why. Not only was tonight a Friday night (so pretty packed) but it was the Friday night before the Head of the Charles. SUPER PACKED. They were just really under-staffed.\\n\\nWe didn't get water or silverware until ~10 min after sitting down, and when our main meals finally came out, they were completely wrong. We sent them back and immediately they came out with new meals that did not look fresh. One of the dishes was wrong again. I felt bad blaming the waitress, but she should check these things! We asked to see the manager because at this point, we wanted some compensation but she just said \\"sorry\\" and that was that. We didn't push too hard since we were so hungry by then. A little while later, we heard the table next to us complain since they had been waiting ~50 min for their order. Oh, and we didn't get water refills the entire 2 hours that we were there. The list goes on. I think tonight was just a chaotic and embarrassing night for the restaurant. I guess the moral of the story is don't come here when it's busy. It'll just be a frustrating and hectic time. Or go to Wagamama the floor below which is basically always empty.\\n\\nFood-wise, this fulfilled my craving for tofu soup and I'll probably frequent here during cold winter weeknights when it's not crowded. The meat specials were also wonderful. The seafood pancake is *not* crispy and tastes more like an omelette with frozen seafood in it. And the banchan is just okay. Definitely affordable on the graduate student budget.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong. I am rooting for Kaju to stay in business, at least for the winter. I just hope it can do better in terms of service and management."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"IM RATING THIS ON OVERALL EXP NOT JUST FOOD.\\n\\nThis was one of the two restaurants my friend and I made reservations for on our stay at Disney ...

Yea, from the outside of the \\"castle\\" to the inside , the west wing, the dance hall, and the library, everything looked like a real life replica of the movie. In the library, they put a curtain of the picture of the beast human form , and whenever they made a thundering sound, the image would change to the beast , so cool! \\n\\nAs for the food, the positives first.. they let us order what we wanted in advance through the Disney app, so that we didn't have to wait. We got  the braised pork and tuna nicoise salad.. the pulled pork was one of their more popular items... But my gf said it tasted soggy and bland.. I thought she was exaggerating because we had a horrible experience from pulled pork the day before but no she was right.. THIS trip ruined pulled pork for us ! LOL and my salad was just seared tuna, arugula, and green beans.. no real flavor.. so yea was really disappointed in that.. \\n\\nBut we did get the cupcake with the grey stuff , to see if it was actually delicious , and it didn't disappoint ! It's pretty much an Oreo flavored cupcake, but whether it was a refreshing taste or because of the letdown from the entrees , we enjoyed it a lot. \\n\\nOverall, the food left more to be desired but I would still come again just foe the experience."},{"name":"Habibi Restaurant","address":"1012 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love it.

The dirty bird bao is a piece of Taiwanese fried chicken served on a bao with cucumbers, carrots, and a wasabi sauce. Another tasty dish.\\n\\nThe Beef Noodle Soup is excellent. The broth is extremely tasty and they don't skimp on the beef. You get some pretty nice sized, tender chunks. The noodles are plump. \\n\\nThe Oxtails are slow cooked in sauce with potatoes and served w/rice on the side. Oxtails are always a premium at places that usually serve them (eg. Caribbean spots), but they give you a decent amount and the sauce it's cooked in is really good. Mixed all my rice in there and went to town. \\n\\nOverall the food is really great and not expensive.

It was restaurant week, so I thought I'd give it a go. I wanted a place where I could have a drink and a meal while watching the harbor... unfortunately, it lacked both.\\n\\nI started out with the clam chowder. Not horrible, but definitely not \\"award winning\\". I couldn't imagine paying more than 3 bucks for a cup of this. It was pretty bland and really didn't have a lot of anything.\\n\\nI tried the bread scrod stuffed with crab, in a lemon butter sauce. The scrod wasn't bad, but the crab stuffing was lukewarm and tasteless. I think their intent was that it would heat up when they put it in the broiler to toast the crumb topping (also tasteless, oddly, not even a butter taste) and failed. Most of the lemon sauce wasn't present, and the little that was there was soaked up by the mashed potatoes (which were by far the tastiest thing on the plate). I felt like I was eating at my school cafeteria -- which sucks, because I've had better fish dinners there, and I get that for free. The waiter asked if I wanted the rest to go and I declined, which is pretty rare for me because I hate wasting food. I knew these were leftovers that I didn't want.\\n\\nLast was dessert. The mudpie was pretty good, I actually finished that.\\n\\nService was alright. The server was pretty slow for a Wednesday late afternoon--I waited 20 minutes between when my plate was taken away and dessert came. Luckily I wasn't in a hurry.\\n\\nOverall, for a $50 dinner with tip, not worth it at all. This restaurant is a splurge for food that really is not good. I wouldn't come back."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"A satisfying biscuit when you have the craving. \\n\\nIf the sausage and cheese biscuit was a little bit juicier or buttery, I'd give it five stars.

The idea of having adult beverages in the magic kingdom alone was enough to get me in.\\n\\nLet's start with check in.... we showed up 10 minutes early for our reservation, got our beeper and were called at exactly our reservation time, great!\\n\\nGot in and were shown around the castle, told that we got beast pics post dinner and were seated in the main dining room, again, great.\\n\\nThis is where things get a bit off and stars get lost. Our waiter came by about 10 minutes after we were seated and seemed very rushed, somthing that did not change throughout the evening. He went through the menu ... really pushing the steak (more on that later), then let us be to decide what we wanted.\\n\\nThe menus (wine and food) are of smaller size as I'm sure too many options would extend service time, and that is fine. Also, as would be expected, the prices are inflated as your in a theme park, also no big deal.\\n\\nThe wine / beer menu is fine, maybe a bit uninspired, but fine. We ordered a bottle of the Louis Jadot Pinot Noir, I'm usually a Washington state pinot guy, but the choices here were California or France so might as well go with the theme... I also ordered a bottle of Chimay with dessert, the beer here is going to upset alot of palates, no macros available (bud, miller, etc) and no inspired crafts (maybe a Belgian ipa people?) But once again, I'm sure they had their reasons and aimed for the average.\\n\\nNow the food. \\n\\nWhen the waiter came back, he kept pushing said steak, but I couldn't bring myself to order a strip steak that was only a few dollars less than the prime ny strip I had the night before at yachtsman. So, we ordered the following...\\n\\nMussels starter - good, solid app. Maybe a little salty for some people, but we liked it. We were torn between this and the salad trio. We saw other starters at other tables and everything else looked pretty boring compared to other resturants.\\n\\nWife got the salmon - said pan seared, but looked almost poached, was cooked to proper medium rare temp, just seemed a little like what you would get as hotel banquet food. Tasted good.\\n\\nI got the pork rack chop - was very tough , sauce, macaroni and veggies were good though.\\n\\nSon got the \\"beast casserole\\" - looked like stoufers mac and cheese, but that is fine dining for a 4 year old, he also enjoyed the large light up castle goblet.\\n\\nDessert - got the gray stuff of course, very good and a lemon cupcake thing, also good.\\n\\nSo in conclusion... unlike most 3 star places I would say to try it once and by all means, get the steak as that seems to be the star of the menu!?! But we will not be returning for dinner. For a $250 tab you could just hop over to citricos, California Grill, etc for a much better meal.... but no beast pics I guess ;)"},{"name":"Burger King","address":"2682 Candler Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"1.5","text":"This was the worst Burger King I ever went to.

It would've been more...had we stayed in Portland longer.\\n\\nWhat makes them phenomenal is not only their strong taste but also their outstanding texture. I never really paid attention to the dough part, since we all pick our donuts based on just the flavor (topping/glaze/jelly), and I could only tell when the dough is stale or bad. But Blue Star, oh my god, the brioche dough part was noticeably amazing on top of its own flavor. Some donuts (like Vanilla Cinnamon Sugar) were as soft and light as marshmallows, while the glazed buttermilk ones (literally heavy when you hold one) had a firm shell but softer inside.\\n\\nMy favorite donut is definitely Orange Olive Oil. It has a refreshing orange tang, while the powder + dough has a really unique texture - I feel like there are tiny sugar crystals when I bite into it. It's too perfect...

I came here at 7:30pm on a Saturday and there was a crowd waiting when I arrived and still a crowd wait as I was leaving around 8:30pm. \\n\\nI ordered the pork kimchi dip cold soba. The cold soba comes with a plate of cold noodles, very generous portion, and then a broth on the side where they light a flame under the broth to keep it hot. And the broth was absolutely delicious. It's not a spicy soup, very sweet and flavorful. There's a hot version of dish, where the noodles are already in the broth. My friend ordered the uni soba which I tasted - the uni is so fresh! The meal is so light and tastes so clean. But their ratio for uni to soba noodles is a bit disappointing. I'm not sure if there is an option for extra uni, but I would recommend doing an extra side of it. \\n\\nThe restaurant is new and I felt like they were having issues in the kitchen and service that I would expect to improve with more experience. The waitstaff is very attentive. Immediately, after we sat down they gave us our waters and they were constantly refilling our waters even though our glasses were still half full. We ordered two appetizers and 4 different soba dishes for the table. A hot soba dish came first, and it was at least another 15 minutes for the other 3 sobas to come. So by the time we were ready to eat my friend's soba was already lukewarm because she was waiting for everyone else to get their food. One appetizer came, but we weren't given small plates. So literally we had to pick off a bite and eat it and then grab another bite. Not good if your friends are germaphobs. The second appetizer was completely forgotten about. We had to remind our waitress so we didn't get it until after we finished our dinner. So a bump down in the star rating.

Someone in our group (in 2003) left a note to the owners suggesting that they change the noodles for their jja jang myun. And I didn't disagree with her. I wasn't expecting hand-made noodles, but it felt like we were eating spaghetti. Seriously. Unacceptable.\\n\\nFast forward to 2008, and the jja jang myun noodles are up to par. They've got some shape to them, but now it's the sauce that's lacking. It was very light, almost watered-down. It lacked a lot of the richness that it's supposed to have. \\n\\nThe jjam-bong, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious. The noodles were even thicker than the jja jang myun noodles, and they also had a great texture - not overcooked, or shall I say, \\"Korean-Chinese al dente\\"? The soup was plenty peppery, spicy while still being full of flavor, and there was an abundance of seafood, even though I only ordered the regular jjam-bong.\\n\\nThe dolsot bibimbap is pretty hard to mess up, and this place did a nice job with it. Not much more to say about that.\\n\\nAlso, the general ambience of this place is kinda weird. They had the radio on this afternoon, and there are posters of Korean people all over the walls. I would prefer Korean pop over the soft rock + tons of commercials we had to listen to today.

The atmosphere is nice, a mix of modern and simple combined with elaborate Persian textiles, the highlight being a couple of low-to-the-ground tables up on a dias and surrounded by cushions.  They look quite comfy.  For those with big parties, Nooras does have a couple of long tables as well.\\n\\nService is great.  The waitress was very helpful and happy to explain items on the menu. The owner also came out towards the end of my meal to make sure everything was satisfactory. Things like this do a lot to make you feel welcome.\\n\\nFor this visit, I opted for Gheymeh, a hearty lentil stew that is served with Noora's saffron Basmatic rice.  It's the perfect choice for a chilly fall day with the warmth and comfort of chili, but flavors of tumeric and lime.  The rice it came with is also great, with a fantastic chewy texture and gentle flavor.  \\nThe meal is served with their bread, which is worth the trip in itself.  Gently crisped on the outside, the stuff is terribly addictive, and goes wonderful with the yogurt based sauce that comes with.  ...I don't even normally like those sorts of sauces.\\n\\nIn need of a caffeine fix, I also ordered a mug of Persian tea, made from loose black leaves for a strong, rich flavor I really enjoyed.  Do note, though, that refills are not free on this beverage as is sometimes the case with tea elsewhere.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, I really wasn't planning to order dessert, but... the waitress talked me into it  I went with \\"Persian ice cream,\\" which in this case tastes of saffron and rosewater, with a bit of whipped cream and pistachio.  The flavor is nice and light, and the texture dense and creamy.  After a heavy meal, it leaves you feeling satisfied without being overly full.\\n\\nPrices are not terrible, at least not for this sort of food.  Most plates run between $11 and $15, and you certainly won't be leaving hungry.  Not the sort of prices I would say are an \\"every day\\" sort of thing, but fine on occasion for a nice meal on a weekend or when wanting something a little special.  There are some lunch specials as well, though only during the weekday it seems.  \\n\\nI will mention that Noora is planning to make some changes to their menu before long here.

My girlfriend and I came here on a Thursday evening.  Our first indication that we should have turned around and left was that they have a huge banner above the entrance that says \\"Under New Management - 25% off!\\".  A \\"Going Out Of Business\\" sale, perhaps?\\n\\nSo we walk in, the place is almost empty, and there is no host or waiter to be seen.  Just an old man behind the sushi bar.  We take a seat at a booth and wait for something to happen.  We soak in the ambiance of unintelligible screaming music from the kitchen marinated over a rerun of Pawn Stars on the TV behind the bar.  This really set up the mood for some great food. After about 15 minutes a blue-haired girl emerges from the kitchen and finally comes over to us with some menus.  We peruse the options until deciding on a spicy tuna roll, two shrimp spring rolls, a pad thai combo, and a traditional Vietnamese salad dish with lemongrass chicken.  The waitress came back twice while she was putting the items into the computer to verify our order. I'm glad she cared enough to try to get it right, but I guess her memory recall is shorter than the 20 seconds it took to walk from the table to the computer.\\n\\nThe spring rolls were the only passable item we ordered.  The sushi roll tasted weird and was loosely packed.  The pad thai was missing some items that were stated on the menu (bean sprouts, eggs), but it was not as bad as the dish my girlfriend ordered.  The dish stated it came with \\"Spring mix, broccoli, onion, basil, tomato, picked carrots, and snap peas\\".  The dish she ordered, which came out of the kitchen after a surprisingly quick amount of time, was some undercooked chicken over chopped iceberg lettuce surrounded by raw carrots and some sad tomatoes.  Yikes!  Unfortunately we left our phones at home so I couldn't take a photo, I wish I could. This was a pathetic excuse for a dish even an amateur at home could whip up. My girlfriend sent it back and didn't even order a replacement.  After my she said \\"I don't even want anything else, sorry.\\" the waitress mindlessly asked \\"Okay, do you want to order anything else?\\"\\n\\nSo she picked a little off my plate of disappointing pad thai and we reluctantly pay for our meal.  The waitress apologized and asked what was wrong with the dish and I showed her the menu and told her none of those items came with the dish.  She blamed the kitchen and apologized again.  I felt bad for her, but it's not an excuse.  I immediately felt sick after we left.  My body was like, \\"Bruh...what did you just put in me?  Get this shit OUT of me or you will regret this tomorrow!\\"  Long story short, whoever was working in the kitchen that night needs to be fired yesterday and never work in food service again.  \\n\\nApparently the other locations, particularly the one on Anderson Lane, are supposed to be better per the Yelp reviews.  But I'm not chancing it, it was that bad.  I love Vietnamese food, I eat it all the time.  This place is embarassing to even crappy Vietnamese places.  I can't imagine we're the only people to ever send back food and be very disappointed with our experience, so they have to know.  It's so bad they had to knock off 25% just to get people through the door.  Do yourself a favor and do not EVER even CONSIDER going here.

This sophisticated and laid back lounge offers a large patio with wonderful views of Vancouver. With both comfort and style, D/6 is a delightul choice for casual drinks with friends or even for happy hour. HAPPY HOUR runs 2:30-5:30 with drinks only. Prosecco $6, 49 North red and white wine $5, draft beer $5, and cocktails for $10! It would be nice to see some happy food added!\\n\\nThis is not a venue for younger folks, which means you will not find a bunch of rowdy, sloppy, and inebriated 20 somethings hanging off the bar and pool table. How refreshing! I would say there is more of a late 20's-40's crowd at D/6 and the dress code in always in effect. Business casual, so put your fine threads on!\\n\\nD/6 is tastefully decorated with elegance and style, and dare I say a little sexy? The lighting is soft, maybe even a little romatic, but not as dark as bars like Prohibition. Cozy couches and chairs throughout the lounge, even the bar stools are cushy, and plenty of outdoor seating and space for mingling.\\n\\nWe came to D6 on a Tuesday night at about 8:30 to play pool. It was relativley quiet, which meant we didn't have to wait long to play.  I hear it gets \\"line up\\" busy on the weekends and it's highly recommended to reserve yourself a table and/or arrive early. Bottle service is also offered for $$$. As I sipped my vino and melted into the ultra comfy, low profile couch, I realised that it didn't matter as much that I was losing at pool, because I was very fond of this lounge.\\n\\nPhenomenal bar service with talented mixologists, whirling you up liquid masterpieces, while entertaining you with their antics. DANIEL gets a shout out for being especially wonderful!!! Not only was Daniel incrediably funny, but he was mad serious about making sure my girlfriend's Bourbon Sour was on point! We had a good chat and laugh with the bartenders and they all seemed just as classy as the D/6!! For drinks, I stole a swig from my friends Moscow Mule and just had to have one. It was stellar!! After ordering the Charcuterie, I decided to switch to wine, for obvious reasons. Wine is overpriced, as per usual, with $14 for a 6 ounce glass. The by-the-glass wine list is a rather small selection and I wasn't blown away by the options. Its hard being a wine snob. Bottle wise, there are a lot more options, but again the prices are a little cray. I appologize, I forgot to grab a snap of the wine list and I can't find one online either.\\n\\nI was pleased with the food menu, with lots of deliscious options and resonable prices considering the upscale ambiance. Menu is share plates, think tapas style. Day menu is served 11:30-9:30. Is there a \\"night menu\\"??  With Daniel's suggestion, we decided on Charcuterie and the Margarita pizza, but I had to add chorizo of course! The Charcuterie was a good size and presented well, but I was disappointed there was no bread and only crackers. I was also sad to see no blue cheese on the board and no real spicy meat. I guess it was a little lackluster for me personally, but still enjoyable. I wonder if the board ingrediants change regularly or if you could request different selections? \\n\\nThe Margarita pizza with chorizo was also a satisfactory size and I don't really have any compliants to mention (cause we ate it all). It was good but not fantastic. I look forward to tasting more food here in the near future.\\n\\nOverall, this lounge gets 5 stars for ambiance and service, but loses a star for the food and wine list.

If you're looking for a real Japanese dining, you've come to the right place."},{"name":"Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant","address":"401 N Front St, Ste 120","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"The food is a little pricey but it's so good.

The restaurant is small and a bit cramped (and its tiny tvs are usually turned to soccer games), so we usually end up taking our meals home to enjoy.

I had this wonderful pork belly papardelle that day that left an indelible impression on my mind, all for not too unreasonble of a price. I told myself then that if this was representative of the quality and value of food in Portland, then moving out here would be wonderful.\\n\\nFast-forward two years later: after having moved to Portland and having enjoyed much of the culinary delights that this town has to offer, the memory of that lunch still lingered. I thus recently returned to Clyde Common with fond memories and high expectations.\\n\\nFirst, some words about the atmosphere. I really like the layout of Clyde Common with the simple decor, the open kitchen, and the balcony areas. It just feels very classy and cozy. I didn't really care to sit at one of the shared tables, but it was still intimate enough of a setting for myself and a date.\\n\\nAs for the food, it once again was wonderful and memorable. I had the gamehen with brussel sprouts and fois gras pear. It's a shame that other yelpers have had bad experiences with that dish because it was absolutely lovely for me. The gamehen was tender and well-seasoned, the brussel sprouts was lovely, and the pear with fois gras was just decadent. I also had a bite of my date's tagliatelle, which was also very delicious. We ended sharing a parsnip cake with caramel and nuts for dessert, which was very luscious and well-balanced. \\n\\nOverall, I had a very lovely experience once again at Clyde Common. It just simply hit all the right notes for me, from the classy environment to the wonderful food (bonus points for their selection of bourbons).

However, it never really dawned on me to go there because I just assumed by the name that it was \\"rabbit food.\\" Haha! I just pictured a big salad bar for dinner and that was it. Obviously I had not done any research. So after a friend recommended it, we went together on a cold Thursday evening. \\n\\nI had at least done research online a few nights before we went and found out that they had good brisket! I was super surprised given the name of the restaurant, but all the pics on Yelp looked intriguing. When we got to the register, I asked the associate for her opinion. She said that the corn cake was the number one base and then the brisket or pulled pork was great as well. I opted for the brisket. I had also heard a lot about the mac & cheese so I got a side of that. And since I love sweets, I had to order a carrot cake! \\n\\nMy friend and I sat down and her order came out within about five minutes. Mine on the other hand took quite a bit longer. We got the same thing except she got pulled pork so not sure what the hold up was. My friend sat there and finally I told her to start eating without me. I'd say that mine took ten extra minutes to come out after hers. I was literally on my way back to the counter to inquire and then I saw a server with my food. \\n\\nMy food was alright. The corn cake was kind of dry, but it was a unique dish so I liked that. The brisket was good, but I expected everything on top to be warm. It was odd because the brisket was lukewarm and then coupled with the cold coleslaw, my palate just couldn't figure it out. I wanted it all to be decently warm but it just wasn't. I also love condiments but this BBQ sauce was just okay. I did ask for extra on the side when the server brought my food bc I thought I'd really like it and they brought it very promptly. But I honestly barely used any of it. Not a fan. The mac and cheese was very good! Definitely as great as everyone said it would be. That was my favorite thing. Perfect temperature and very creamy. \\n\\nLastly, the carrot cake was HORRIBLY dry. It was so unfortunate because the frosting was delicious! But the cake was so dry that honestly if a server would have happened to walk by and ask us how we were, I would have probably told them to throw the rest of that batch away bc it should not be getting served to customers. I don't know if I just got a bad slice or what, but I would not recommend. \\n\\nI do have to say that the staff was excellent which makes my rating very difficult. My friend and I were SO engrossed in conversation (we hadn't seen each other in 7.5 years!) that all of a sudden we looked up and al of the chairs were up on the tables and they were mopping. We were the only ones in there! We asked when they closed and they said 8pm and it was 8:40! We felt horrible!!! They were sooo nice about it though. And the initial girl who rang us up was so friendly. So customer service-wise, this place is a 5, but the food is a solid 3, so that's how I get to my 4 star rating. I probably won't be going back anytime soon but I'm glad I tried it out! Would recommend trying at least once!"},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my favorite restaurants on Walt Disney World property!\\n\\nThe menu has something for everyone. I know this because my husband is one very picky eater and even he enjoyed our visit to BOG! I had the over the moon delicious Roast Beef Sandwich and he had the Carved Turkey Sandwich. We went to BOG during lunch for quick service. I have never been to BOG for table service, but I will tell you that I don't feel like I am missing anything doing it quick service. \\n\\nFirst of all, I get to choose which of the 3 sections I want to sit in. I believe if the reservation were table service, I would not have this kind of freedom. This visit, I chose the West Wing, as it was the only section I had never sat. I loved the dark, ominous feel of the Beast's lair. The two coolest things were the holographic rose in the bell jar slowly losing petals as we ate, and the torn portrait above the fireplace that would periodically change from the prince's image, to the beast's, with just the right bolt of lightning and thunder. \\n\\nEven as a quick service, this restaurant feels full service. You help yourself to your own drinks, but aside from that, you are served. You are given a pink rose which you take with you to your table, which assists the wait staff in locating you throughout the expansive restaurant. They roll your meal over to you on elegant carts with glass domes and your food is served on real china with real silverware. \\n\\nThe best thing of all though, comes in the form of dessert! Yes...you guessed it! I am referring to the Grey Stuff...it's delicious! Don't believe me, ask the dishes. ;) During quick service hours, the grey stuff is served as part of the Master's Cupcake, which is divine! A super moist chocolate cupcake with grey stuff icing, which tastes like a heavenly light cookies and cream concoction. \\n\\nThe hardest part of this restaurant is getting in. For table service, you will need to make your reservations 6 months out from the date you are wanting to eat there, or stalk the Disney Dining website regularly for a cancelation. Quick service is a little easier, and occasionally you can score a walk up, but generally speaking this also requires advanced reservations and a credit card hold. \\n\\nA little tip for good measure. Even with a reservation, there will be a line to get in and place your order. The Disney Dining website allows you to pre-order your meal anytime up to 5 minutes before your reservation. If you pre-order your meal, you get to bypass a good part of the time that would be spent waiting and march ahead to pay your balance and be seated. \\n\\nOverall, one of the best times you can have at Disney World.

I wouldn't be my #1 app to pick, but it's great to try at least once.\\n\\n*Three Cup Chicken Wings: Twice fried, they pack a nice crunch (but it's a little over fried for my taste). And it's topped with chopped basil.\\n\\n*Chili Oil Wontons: Pork and shrimp wontons, Szechuan chili oil, crunched peanuts, sesame seed, and cilantro. Oh, these are very tasty. \\n\\n*Dirty Bird Bao: With Taiwanese fried chicken cutlet, wasabi aioli, pickled daikon radish and carrot, it's a blend with the South. Although, I prefer the pork belly bao over this one. That's just my preference, though.\\n\\nThey also serve Mexican Coke, Ginger Ale, and green tea. Their drinks are quite limited, but it's not an issue. Just be aware, if you're a drink snob.\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nI've never really had an issue with their service, and they've always been on point with communicating whether they're running slow on a given night (e.g. slammed kitchen because of Uber Eats). They're great.\\n\\nIII. AMBIENCE/ DECOR\\nEverything from my previous review is the same. And I'm glad they ironed out their AC issues.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\nJustified! As I mentioned before, it's damn challenging getting some decent Taiwanese food in the ATL. Take my money.\\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nNot only has Ah-Ma's improved, but it's also been a consistent destination for me to satisfy my Taiwanese food cravings. But here's the caveat: while they do serve Taiwanese food, I feel like it's more of a second-generation Taiwanese-American take on the cuisine. So really, they're kind of paving the way for their own style and flava. And that's cool.\\n\\nSo, if you've eaten Taiwanese food before, just use whatever criteria or experiences for authenticity as a baseline and keep an open mind when dining there."},{"name":"wagamama - prudential","address":"800 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I wish we had one of these in Miami.

I was greeted seated and served in a very timely manner. My server made me feel right at home as we conversed about the Raiders leaving to Las Vegas and him checking up on me regularly.\\n\\nI ordered the Pasta sampler and when I was asked if I wanted soup or salad I told my server I didn't want either and he told me instead of the two I could get mozerella cheese instead but, I kindly declined. It's great that he tried to give me an alternative option.\\n\\nFood review:\\n\\nThe Pasta sampler came with Gnocchi stuffed with cheese, Ravioli stuffed with cheese, in-house made meatball all drizzled with marinara sauce, lasagna, Ravioli stuffed with meat and herbs, and a bowl of spaghetti with marinara sauce.\\n\\nThe gnocchi and ravioli was cooked perfectly packed full of flavor. The Gnocchi could be one of the best i've had with it not being too heavy (which is hard since it's potato based) nor too big in size and could be my favorite dish on the plate. The close second was the lasagna that was perfectly baked with stringy cheese and just the right amount of marinara sauce to make a perfect balance between pasta, sauce, and cheese. The meatball was packed full of flavors from the different meats and herbs it gave a nice bite that's not overly tender yet not hard as bricks, just perfectly well made and cooked to let you know you're eating a real meatball where all the fibers aren't totally broken down.\\n\\nThe spaghetti was a little disappointing as the pasta had a hint of a soapy taste, after mixing the marinara sauce it just tasted like a chef boyardee canned spaghetti. The marinara sauce for all the dishes were chunky and thick whilst being light the flavor was there but, is it real Italy style sauce? well, no, it's not it's a mix of american and italian with a heartiness to it and poured on top of your dish instead where the most pasta in Italy is tossed with a light and a little watery sauce where the flavors are absorbed in a al dente pasta to enrich it full of flavor from this light, yet crazy flavorful sauce. \\n\\nThe Pasta Sampler may seem like a heavy dish but, I managed to finish everything without having to wrap anything up to-go. The pasta dishes are well done and a great way to sample everything all in one plate!\\n\\nEnd food review.\\n\\nI really had a great experience here and would really recommend this place for their beers, watching sports and dining in with family and friends.

After my second visit to Borgata I felt it was necessary to provide feedback for all to read as there has yet to be an enjoyable visit. Each visit we were instructed to sit anywhere we wanted from someone behind the bar. Both times, we waited and waited for someone to come to our table to take our drink order. This was extremely frustrating because we were the only table needing service and there were way too many workers just standing around. Drinks take forever, apparently the servers are too young to bring alcoholic drinks to your table so they sit at the bar until someone realizes it. Both times we asked questions about the menu and the server didn't know and had to go ask. We ordered an appetizer and pizza. The restaurant starts getting a little more busy and we're waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally, the pizza comes out... followed by.... the appetizer, which we could see sitting on a rack for several minutes.  Appetizer was cold, we had it sent back and taken off the bill. Now for the pizza, great flavor, first slice was perfect, slight crunch to the bottom and the right ratio of ingredients. As we ate another and another slice, it got spongy and doughy, not crisp or even brown on the bottom.  There appears to be a severe inconsistency in the cooking.  We noticed the oven is often left open for quite some time, possibly losing too much heat? or the oven cook needs more training? Either way, it's what you're known for, you should make sure there's some quality control.  Now, before everyone starts saying, it's new, they're working out the kinks...It's a new location not a new business model. The fundamentals of having trained staff and quality food shouldn't be new to them. they should know how to operate.  First impressions are everything, not off to a great start in my mind.

We were there easily 40 minutes because the person behind the register moved so slow.\\n\\nThey didn't have any flavors that were extraordinary, or make you think I absolutely have to have this one. When we finally got the order I asked if they had any vegan donuts and the guy said no we don't plan on carrying any at this location. It would've been nice had they had a sign or something like other stores that noted this.

The outside from a far looks like the real Beasts castle. As you walk the bridge over to the castle you come up to these large dungeon like doors where you wait for your name to be called. Once you are invited in you are either brought to the main dance hall for dinner or for lunch/breakfast you are brought to the hall to make your food selections. The food for breakfast and lunch is on the average side with a lot of options. What's great about those times is that you get to pick what wing of the restaurant you eat in. We have eaten in all three and it is pretty fun to get to see how all three interact with each other. I would vote the food and experience 3 stars for breakfast and lunch. I would vote dinner 4 stars on the other hand. The food gets kicked up a notch for dinner and you actually get a waiter this time instead of a machine for breakfast/lunch.

This place serves up some true Mexico style food but also has unique Tex-Mex offerings as well.  For those of you scratching your heads right now, there is a difference between Mexico and Tex-Mex food.  Think of Fonda San Miguel vs. Chuy's, they're just not really the same.  But I digress... on with the review!  On most weekend nights Don Lupe, the owner, will probably greet you at the door.  There's usually no mistaking him, he has a big Pancho Villa mustache and always reaches out to you with a big \\"Hola Amigo\\" handshake.  At times, he does don a giant sombrero with a bullet belt full of shot glasses and holsters with tequila bottles.  Watch out though, if he offers a shot he'll charge you.  Don't worry too much, because they are good and not very expensive.   The restaurant itself is pretty much the caricature of what you'd come to expect a Mexican food joint to look like.  Bright yellow and pink colors on the inside with all kinds of cheesy art stuff hanging on the walls.  Somehow I do think it works fine for this place and it does add a bit to the \\"Fiesta\\" atmosphere they're shooting for.  \\n\\nThe menus are gigantic leather slabs with the word \\"Catering\\" misspelled to \\"Cartering.\\"  I'm still not sure why that is, but it always makes me giggle.  The food choices are muy grande and vary from standard tortilla soup to sizzling fajitas.  Take note of their specialty section and I highly recommend the \\"Molcajete.\\"  This is a lava rock bowl that is oven heated (watch your hands!) that is full to the brim with a mix of chicken and beef mixed in with veggies and a spicy tomato sauce.   It is delicious and will feed two people easily.  Other menu items worth noting are the \\"Tampique√±a,\\" which is VERY spicy and the \\"Arrachera\\" steak.   For drinks, try their $5 house Margarita... it's cheap, strong and has a funky Windex color.  Quit your whinnnnning!  It's $5 bucks and two of those will get you a nice buzz.  I do like that they make your salsa at the table and make sure to ask for it spicy!  If you splurge for the guacamole, they'll also make that tableside as well.   \\n\\nService here is fair at best and most waiters often looked a bit confused.   Come here with a little bit of patience and a whole lot of room in your stomach.

And waited. \\n\\nThe broth was amazing, even if it was less spicy than anticipated. It wasn't a canned soup broth, it was a flavorful and rich soup that may be able to stand on its own after twenty minutes of boiling. I agree that you don't need any additional sauce, the broth was enough. The meats and veggies were average, but the homemade fish balls were very good.

I must say, service was excellent. They asked how everything was. They came back to pour more water and tea. I had my 2 kids with me. My 5 year old enjoyed it too.
