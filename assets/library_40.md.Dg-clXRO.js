It's more of a tapas place, and I think they are creative. I ordered mushrooms with brioche and sausage because I read many good things about it, and that was actually my least favorite dish. The taste was weird and brioche was soaked. Then I had octopus plate which was a pleasant surprise! I had something similar at Kyma, and I must say,Salt Yard, makes it better.

Our server was very nice, except for one thing. When we got our checks, we did not have our orders listed which could have been confusing for some. We just saw the amount we had to pay.

Nobody realized it except one person. I, personally, do not like being tricked, and that was probably his purpose. If he had told us about it, I would have left him whatever he included (probably 20%) plus additional 20% because I liked it there! but since he never told us I scratched it, and left him extra 5%.

The corn was pretty good, all the flavor was over the top of it with the cotija cheese and scallions and what not.

The cheese was melted just right and not overcooked. The ingredients were all high quality. John, the pizza guy, really cares about fresh, organic, local ingredients, including the meats.

The Steak Tartare was good but nothing too special compared to the cured meats, pates and hot dog. The Hot Dog was the best hot dog I've ever had! It was huge though so I would recommend sharing if you decide to try a bunch of appetizers. \\n\\nI think the best part our meal was the Antipasti and Pates.

Instead, we walked down the street to Pasta Da Pulcinella, next to CosmoLava. I've always noticed the little house that the restaurant is located in, but figured it was outrageously expensive.\\n\\nWhile it's definitely more expensive than Macaroni Grill, it's not unreasonable. This is the kind of place where they make their own pasta, and it shows. \\n\\nWe had the Fried Calamari to start. It was definitely different than any calamari I had -- they coated the squid with cornmeal? It made for an interesting texture and was a lot lighter than other fried calamari I had. The marinara sauce was chunkier than I am used to but went great with the calamari, especially with a squeeze of lemon.\\n\\nI ordered the Pappardelle with Pan-Seared Sea Scallops with mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. The boyfriend ordered the Red Pepper Gnocchi with Grilled Chicken. I don't think those are the names of the dishes word-for-word, but I can tell you that they were both specials. One side of the menu had their house favorites and the other was an entire page of specials.\\n\\nI've had pappardelle at other restaurants and envisioned a light bowtie pasta, especially since it was being served with scallops. Imagine my surprise when I received my dish and it contained thick flat orange noodles covered in tomato-ey alla vodka sauce. The pasta was delicious, though. It was thick and almost chewy, which is my preference when it comes to handmade pasta. The sauce was nice and flavorful. The scallops were amazing. The sun-dried tomatoes kind of killed it for me though because they had such a strong flavor, plus the dish already had a ton of diced fresh tomatoes. I personally couldn't taste the vodka but my boyfriend said there was definitely an alcoholic taste. Oh well. I wasn't expecting vodka in the dish (and am still not positive there was any there at all, but it definitely reminded me of penne alla vodka).\\n\\nThe boyfriend's gnocchi also came out in an orange hue -- was that red pepper? It was doused in a white Gorgonzola cream sauce and had slices of chicken on top. I was not really a fan of his dish. I've only had gnocchi a few times, but this gnocchi seemed a little too doughy for my taste. It was also slightly sweet, which made me wonder if it was sweet potato gnocchi (that would explain the orange color). It didn't seemed to be paired with the sauce all that well. I think at first taste, the boyfriend was not a fan, but as he continued eating, he grew to like it.\\n\\nWe sat out on the patio and enjoyed the nice weather.

The server took the food back to the kitchen straight away and placed the amended order.

KFC is probably better.  No sides included.  For $21 this entree is expensive.   Should be about $15.

The only real drawback for me is that there wasn't a wide variety on the menu, in my opinion.  I liked the burger but I'd don't know if I'd want to make the price jump to the entrees, which seemed interesting but didn't really grab me.\\n\\nThe music they had going when the band wasn't playing was pretty cool.

We had a party of six. We stood in the empty entry for almost 10 minutes before the hostess came to say we would have to wait.... the place was about a third full. So we got seated, and waited almost 20 minutes for a server to bring water. Didn't ask if we wanted anything else. We asked a server Bethany about getting some drinks, and she said in the vernacular of shitty servers everywhere\\n 'I am not your server. I will let him know.'  \\nOk, eventually got some drinks. Our server took our order, then at the end of all of us ordering, he said \\"I think I will use my phone to write down your orders. Just so that I get them right.\\" So we had to repeat the whole ordering thing. \\nIt took one hour and twenty minutes to get food. On a Friday night in a mostly empty place. Half of us got our food. The others sat for another ten minutes! What, the cook's joint went out and he had to run home and get another?!? And the food, dear god the food. If it was edible at all, it was bland and tasteless. Did I mention bland? My friend ordered the tenderloin. It was burnt on the outside to a crisp. But damp. Like they knew they had cooked the living shit out of it and then spritzed it to make it look like it was remotely edible. Amazing. Another friend ordered plain salad with some chicken. Basic food, right? It came as a plate of lettuce. No chicken or the salt and pepper that she had asked for. The list goes on, I won't bore you with the rest of the debacle other than to say Joshua was really great, tried to fix all the crappy food and previous shitty service, but at that point it had become a tragic comedy and we just wanted the hell out of there."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Highland Kitchen is a really great spot.

Sadly, I'll have to make an exception today for Cafe Agora Midtown. I gave 1 star because the food was edible and the customer service wasn't outright offensive. Nonetheless, there are fundamental errors here that I wouldn't tolerate from a McDonalds. If I screwed up, best believe it'd be posted online: CAM should be no exception. \\n\\nI've had this place bookmarked on Yelp for months and walked here from bar Eleven at Lowes as I was in search of good customer service and reasonable prices in a quiet setting (a fools errand in Midtown, I know). The good news is that I'm no longer hungry, had a tasty slightly dry lamb gyro per other Yelpers, and discovered the creamy addictive rice pudding-like mystery of Sutlac. The bad...well, more irksome news is that I paid $19 pre-tip for a gyro, red potato salad with olive oil and 1 glass of white wine kept out next to the cash register and had an otherwise pleasant experience with a guy whose conversation about sports with his two friends was more interesting than my presence as a paying customer.\\n\\nThe ugly was something fundamentally unacceptable: dining area cleanliness. After ordering and paying at the counter on the main level, the gentleman, a handsome fellow with a beard and hipster glasses, instructed me to take a seat and he'd bring my food. Since the guy's friends were taking up the entire lower area with their man chat, I headed upstairs. The picture I posted of dirty plates and napkins left at FOUR out of EIGHT tables for who knows how long. The gentleman followed me up there soon afterward, knew I noticed the trash but bounded back down the stairs as soon as he set my food on my table. This occurred 25 minutes ago. No bugs are here yet, but the guy's friends have since left and thusly so did his excuse for not cleaning these tables. I'm going to offer to bus my own table upon leaving as I'm feeling more empathy than most diners would right now (blame the wine), but that will have to be the last thing I contribute to Cafe Agora Midtown\\n\\nHey Cafe Agora Midtown, I get it.

To be fair, I only discovered the Border Caf√© a few months ago and have been there a half dozen times, sometimes alone, other times with clients or friends. First the service: very inconsistent. To date, I have never seen any of the hosts/hostesses smile or even appear welcoming. They never say \\"Welcome\\" or even \\"Hi\\". Instead, they look at you as if you automatically know what to say (which, of-course, you do) and then begin walking toward your table trusting you will follow. It's a petty thing, but it does set the tone for the place. The food servers range from very efficient, friendly and helpful to borderline surly and neglectful. \\n\\nThe food: I will be up front - I spent many years living in the southwest, so my standards for Mexican or Ameri-Mex are high. In addition, at one time, some years ago, I cooked professionally, therefore; again, my standards may be a bit higher than some others. I have had great food at the Border and I have had borderline inedible food. The odd thing is that on several different occasions the best food and the worst have been the same dish served on different occasions. Example: Several weeks ago I stopped at the Border when I was by myself. I ordered the swordfish tacos, which were fantastic. They were served with one of the best chimchurri sauces I've had east of the Mississippi. The dish included a grilled avocado half - an unusual treatment not often seen in this area of the country. The swordfish was very fresh and tender and the accompaniments were equally good. I enjoyed the dish so much that when I returned to the Border today, this time with a client, I ordered the same dish. Only it wasn't the same dish, not at all. Today the swordfish was dry, tough and obviously well past it's prime. The dish was served with a tiny - and I do mean tiny, perhaps half a tablespoon - bit of mango salsa and a pile of greens that could have done with a more careful wash. (grit doesn't quite make a good salad) The mango was under ripe, the salsa one tone, merely hot with no depth of taste. There was no chimchurri sauce this time and the grilled avocado was burnt, not grilled. My guest ordered from the Cajun side of the menu having the \\"Jim Bowie\\" filet. He reported the steak as tough and overdone and that the shrimp placed atop were equally tough and tasteless. \\n\\nI would have brought the overdone steak and the lack of sauce for my dish to the attention of our server, had she made a reappearance at any point. Unfortunately, after taking our order, we didn't see her again until it was time to present the check. I suspect, from her general surliness toward not just us, but the other tables near us, that she was having some type of personal crisis and perhaps was attempting to deal with that crisis in addition to waiting on her tables. \\n\\nIt is impossible to tell whether the inconsistency issues encountered at the Border are due to lax management at this one location or more serious, related to lack of oversight by upper management. I'll give the place at least one more try and hope, sincerely, that things will have worked out and that I can come back here and give the glowing review I once hoped to offer."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't get it we ate at Bollywood down the street my friend tells me how wonderful the ice cream is at Salt and Straw, so we go in.

I'm basing a 4 star rating on the food only. As far as an enjoyable dining experience, they have some serious issues to work out. It seems like they want to be more of a restaurant than a traditional BBQ place, but they do not take orders at the table. A month after opening, the lines are still huge. Your reward for standing in line 20 or minutes is to give them your money and put the order in for yet another 45-60 minute wait for the food. In my experience, you go to a restaurant hungry, so waiting around another hour with no option but to buy drinks is not really acceptable. In most BBQ place, you go down the line cafeteria style and when you have paid, you have your food and you are ready to eat. Wouldn't that be a better system? It can't take too long for someone to make a taco in front of you if that's what they are ordering. The staff did try to be helpful when we saw the long wait. We were allowed to step off the 30 person deep line and place a take out order at the bar. But it really made no difference, as we still waited 45  minutes for our takeout order. The good is they have a lot of seating both indoor and outdoors if you are not hungry and want to have a few beers. It's the food delivery system that needs to be re-thought, and I would imagine most are coming here wanting to chow down pronto. We got home with our food and experienced a couple of other mis-steps: we got a ribs platter and a chicken platter with our two sides, but they failed to put the tortillas that should have been included in the bag. Also, there was no sauce in the bag. We were not asked if we would like any sauce, or what kind which is pretty standard for BBQ places and take-out. I would have liked to try it, but it was not a big deal (the sauce) as the ribs didn't seem to need it. They had a bit of sweetness on the crust like they had been brushed with some sauce at the finish. They were smoked pretty much to perfection with beautiful pink color. I have been unimpressed with all Barbeque in Orlando I have tried thus far, but this was really pretty darn impressive. The slaw was a nice rough cut style that tasted fresh and healthy with a tasty apple-cidery light sauce--no heavy mayo. The corn had a wonderful grilled flavor. My BF is a big beans and rice fan and he found them outstanding. I tasted what I thought was Thai Fish Sauce in the beans and it really worked--yummy! So, big props on the best tasting food of a new restaurant we've tried in many months, but please work the kinks out so we can totally enjoy the experience without reservation."},{"name":"Portland Wine Bar and Winery","address":"526 SW Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great find on our quick trip to Portland.

The stir fried udon goes great with the crispy noodles. They also have a Pad Thai mixed with a curry sauce, which name I'm blanking on right now, but is equally tasty.

Facts\\nA party of five stressed-out ladies decided to venture out to the North End on a warm Sunday morning to escape law school.  While they were driving down Commonwealth Ave, they decided to place a phone reservation for a brunch meal at the famed North Street Grill (heretoforthwith referred to as NSG).  The hostess on the phone confirmed that for a party of five, the wait for brunch would be 20minutes.  Because the ladies were 10minutes away from their destination, they decided to put their name in to secure prompt seating.  Once they arrived at NSG, however, the hostess they previously spoke with on the phone was nowhere to be found and their name was not on the list.  Because their name was not placed on the list, NSG informed the five ladies that they would be seated in an hour and a half.  Frustrated and hungry, the five ladies decided to hedge their bets and seek out another brunch restaurant.  They eventually chose to eat at Maurizio's which had a \\"Yelp Loves Us!\\" sticker placed prominently on their door.  \\n\\nThe purpose of this [memo/review] is to evaluate whether Maurizio's warrants a 5-star Yelp rating.  We conclude that it does.\\n\\nII.  Discussion\\nAlthough there are several factors used to rate food establishments, restaurants may typically receive high Yelp ratings if they satisfy or exceed the following requirements: 1) menu variety, 2) taste, 3) service, 4) value and 5) overall ambiance/experience.\\n\\nMaurizio's brunch menu offered just enough variety and selection for brunch.  For an Italian restaurant, Maurizio's actually had a very diverse selection of egg entrees, sandwiches, and pasta dishes.  In the present case, the popular choices were the pancetta omelette and the prosciutto & fontina pressed sandwich.  \\n\\nAll the food ordered at the table also exceeded the taste test.  The pressed sandwich was rich with cheese and the focaccia bread was toasted to a warm crisp.  The omelette also included generous dices of vegetables and pancetta.\\n\\nEven though there was only one server working, service was very quick, efficient, and extremely friendly.  The party of five ladies was promptly seated once they entered through the doors, unlike the excessive wait at NSG.  Orders were taken and given directly to the chefs in the kitchen, which is an open kitchen located in the back.  Because the kitchen is open, food could be seen being prepared promptly to serve orders.\\n\\nMaurizio's was also very fairly priced for their big portions of food.  Because the party of five was comprised of all current law students surviving off of school loans, price was a very important factor.  They were indeed very surprised to note that one could eat a warm brunch meal at Maurizio's for about the same price they would have to pay for a measly turkey sandwich and soda at their law school's overpriced cafeteria.\\n\\nThe small and cozy atmosphere of Maurizio's greatly enhanced the overall dining experience.  The quirky art on the red walls provided character to the establishment.  Maurizio's truly presented itself as a very cute North End restaurant.\\n\\nIII.  Conclusion\\nBased on the examination of the facts, Maurizio's should receive 5 Yelp stars.  The menu was just right, the food was delicious, the service was efficient, the prices were affordable, and the restaurant had charisma.  The ladies were happy with their choice and made plans to return to Maurizio's again in the future."},{"name":"Gladstone Street Pizza","address":"3813 SE Gladstone St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"YUM!!! \\nWe finally tried Gladstone after a ton of great reviews and hearing about it from friends.

I am not used to the big bowl of pure blackbean with pork and sausage, i find all i can taste is the blackbean itself.

However, I would not advise going with a group.  The concept of small plates and sharing and staggered food delivery makes no sense whatsoever.

Call me old fashioned, or just pour me one, but I like everyone in my party to eat together.  It just seems like an excuse for the kitchen to be lazy.

The only drawback is by midnight when it gets crowded, she is pulling double duty between bartending and taking requests. So, the take away is, if you want to sing, get there around 10 PM and you'll practically have the place to yourself like a private room!

Definitely a good spot for large groups. Service was also decent, much better (more attentive) than other order as you go buffet places (I'm looking at you Yamato!). \\n\\nThe food was just okay though, and the variety on the menu sadly slim. Other than sushi, there wasn't a lot of choice in terms of other foods. Also, they pulled the bait and switch on me for at least 2 of the items I ordered. The lobster puffs were in fact crab rangoons (I was also previously tricked at Yamato, where they called their crab rangoons \\"crispy crab\\" leading me to think it was deep fried softshell crab, but I digress...). For pete's sake, however, just call the damn things what they are, CRAB RANGOONS! Don't try to trick me. Also, I ordered the grilled sea bass and they brought me mackerel instead, hoping I wouldn't notice. I think they saw the funny look I made when I saw the mackerel though and they quickly said they didn't have bass that day so they gave me mackerel. Err.. ok, would have been nice they told me first as I didn't want to waste my yummy space for salty mackerel. But whatever, I ate it (as a note, it wasn't good--the mackerel was cold and salty).\\n\\nAs another tip, beware of their special rolls, particularly the ones that sound like they might be expensive (i.e. contain lobster). We ordered the Bruins Roll and Patriots Roll (I think), both of which the descriptions said contained lobster, the lobster in the rolls was minuscule and the rolls were loaded with rice. To make things worse, they were wrapped in this terrible non-seaweed wrapper and were just difficult to swallow overall.\\n\\nI think this is a place that's good enough to try once so you can say you've tried it, but not so good or economical to be a standard go to spot.

The salad I ordered with it was a bed of fresh baby greens tossed in lemon, olive oil, salt and pepper. Simple and flavorful. A refreshing, crisp, delicious meal all around. We finished the meal with the most orgasmic banana bread pudding anyone has ever had. Banana Bead pudding with a thick, sweet homemade caramel (Bourbon?) sauce and creamy vanilla ice cream Seriously. Get the banana bread pudding. I don't care if you are full. I don't care if you don't like bananas, or bread pudding, or anything. You need to eat it. \\n\\nNow, beyond the food, I need to point out that Jim is the best server ever. We have had him the past two times we have dined at Highland and he has been awesome both times. His drink/food recommendations are spot on and he always makes me feel like I just ordered EXACTLY what he would have ordered. All in a very subtle, quiet, contained type of way. He's great. He didn't even chide me when, on my birthday, I got intoxicated off of three Mark and Stormy's (drink them, you will be happy) and started spewing my liberal political ideals next to the well-to-do conservative couple who appeared to be having a second date next to us (sorry, everyone). Seriously, Jim is a knowledgeable, warm and welcoming server. Thanks, Jim!

They used a particularly thick leaf of spinach, which isn't as pleasant and light as some other types of spinach. \\n\\nFor our entrees, I had the spaghetti al salmone and my mom, the penne con pollo alla griglia. Our main complaints for both dishes were that 1) the sauces were a little watery and 2) the dishes not particularly flavorful.\\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere made for a pleasant night but the food was a letdown. There's lots of wonderful Italian restaurants in the North End. and unfortunately, this one didn't deliver for us. \\n\\n(One final note: I have only ate at this place once.

Your papas bravas make me sing for joy, the raddicchio salad is something dreams are made of (and I was never the hugest fan of raddicchio previously), ice cream-soaked French toast (who is behind this genius?!?), beef jerky in my bloody mary, and chicken liver pate on a breakfast board, boudin blanc, tartufo AND celery root all rolled up in the perfect food (eggs), delightful. And you have sons? I would love to meet them.\\nI have eaten my way up and down the revolving menu, and have yet to find a dish that has been a disappointment, although, as they say, love is blind. After 3 visits, I was hooked, and it would have had to be a disaster of a plate to lose faith. \\nThe wait is always worth it, although I am wise enough to not attempt weekend mornings, the service always friendly and efficient, and the tables close enough where I can share the dishes as I inevitably over order when dining out. \\nThis evening I went in to try out their happy hour. Kept it simple with (surprise) raddicchio salad, cheese steak, fried cauliflower with olives, and a little panna cotta with caramel, candied walnuts and apples. I generally do not have much of  a sweet tooth, but the panna cotta itself was very, very lightly sweetened, so its creaminess made a lovely contrast with the caramel/apple/walnut toppings. Again, service was attentive without being intrusive, smiles on the faces of all the waitstaff as they made eye contact (an indication that the owner is doing his part in keeping them happy), and delicious Tasty Mary. \\nAside from having outstanding food and good service, the prices will allow you to dine on the cheap if it is your desire. Tonight, 4 dishes, 4 cocktails, $50. Last week, three of us for breakfast (I think 6 dishes, 2 coffees, 2 cocktails), $58. Me and mom for breakfast, two coffees, two Mary's, 5 dishes, $50.

As mutual meat lovers, we were pretty excited about this (I mean, name alone). Unfortunately, it was not quite what we expected.\\n\\nWe had: the bread, marinated olives, hot dog a la maison, tenderloin topped with corn and fennel salsa, and apricot pork chop. Unfortunately, we couldn't try the wine, but that's the problem with being underage. Bread was decent, but really nice with the salted butter and honey--a winning combination. Olives were of good quality and pretty enjoyable, also in a nicely sized proportion. The hot dog, while supposedly excellent (we read our Yelp reviews before going into this), was really just okay, maybe good, but not a culinary sensation by any means. The tenderloin was the night's biggest disappointment. You'd expect a steakhouse called \\"The Butcher Shop\\" to know how to do a piece of meat justice, but it was really overcooked. We ordered medium rare and ended up with something medium, barely even pink in the middle. The corn and fennel salsa on top also left something to be desired, but maybe I just don't like corn that much...perhaps the beef jus would have been a better accompaniment. Saved the best for last though! The pork chop. OH. MY. I really like some fat on my meat and they gave it to me. Seriously the most tender, flavorful pork chop I can ever remember having and I just...my mouth salivates as I think about it, and I don't even like apricots! I wanted to tear the meat off the bone myself, but I left that to my friend. SO good!\\n\\nAmbiance was nice too. Sitting on high chairs in a cool little shop with good service. It's also fun to watch people as they prepare meats in the open area charcuterie; a lot of people coming in for dinner would stand and watch or take pictures. It's quite an enjoyable experience in that aspect.\\n\\nHowever, there's an overall 3 for not being mindblowing. There may have been one SHINING light in the night (I have serious pork chop love now), but it couldn't overcome my disappointment in having a steak overcooked like that.

After a drink, this cost just over $16, so not super pricey, but not cheap either. I think the price is well-justified, though, because the place is really well kept, clean, and overall a nice place.\\n\\nThe slaw is a nice balance between the usual \\"creamy\\" and \\"vinegar-y\\" variants that you usually see. Not sure I tasted the \\"apple\\" in it, however. The fried plantains were excellent for the most part, though they had a varying degree of doneness - some were perfectly tender while others seemed a bit burnt on the outside, with the inside being a bit firm. However, the sugar sprinkled on top gave me the feeling I was getting a dessert with a nice balance between sweet and savory.\\n\\nThe meat was overall well executed. Pulled pork had a bit of dryness to it but still good flavor overall. Unlike the sandwich on the last visit, the brisket this time was from the flat instead of the point. Was very tender considering it being from the leaner portion of the brisket, and a good bit of smoke and seasoning on the outer portions.\\n\\nI ordered the hot barbecue sauce again this time, but it actually had a nice kick to it.

The mustache guy doing the cooking works very hard. When not at the BBQ he's straightening out the chairs at the unoccupied tables, cleaning, in the back making rice, or even ensuring the spoons for the sauces are all pointing the same direction! As someone who is also a chronic scowler, I feel for the guy. Even when sharing a laugh with the other staff (as he did today) he looks unhappy. Give him a break! He says hello, thank you, and goodbye ~ to each their own. I found the place very clean once again, and the staff clear the tables of dishes and then clean up very quickly.

So I guess it was like being a fancy caveman.\\n\\nMy friend and I came here based on the strength of the Yelp reviews and a friend's recommendation. And it did not disappoint. It was everything we had hoped for and more. The name is incredibly apt, with a master butcher in a tie and apron working in the open kitchen at the back. A lot of attention to detail was given to the decor. The hanging meat saw beyond the butcher, the framed pictures of their meat products, the butcher paper on the tables, meat scale in the bathroom, and lots of other features.\\n\\nWe arrived on a Sunday just in time to order from the lunch menu (the cut off was 3:30). Our waiter was friendly and answered all of our questions, confirming our original inclinations.\\n\\nWe decided to start with the steak tartare and an individual portion of the petite charcuterie to share. We were given bread before our food came: Irish soda bread and French bread mix with sides of organic Vermont Honey and whipped butter with sea salt. I thought the honey was good but didn't mesh well with the bread, and the butter was delicious and made me feel bad about the Norwegians for having a butter shortage (this review is super topical, I know).\\n\\nAnyway, it did take longer than we expected to receive our appetizers (the table next to us showed up after we did and got their charcuterie first). But it was well worth it. The petite charcuterie had so many types of meat on it (in most cases two of everything sliced) that we thought they had accidentally sent us two portions. Thankfully that wasn't the case. I can't remember everything we had, but the highlights were definitely the prosciutto and the venison sausage.\\n\\nThe steak tartare was every bit as good as the reviews made it out to seem. Amazingly fresh and not overspiced. Exactly how high quality beef should taste, methinks. Well worth the $17.\\n\\nFor our main courses, we opted to share a hot dog and roast beef sandwich. A word of caution- the hot dog is huge! We saw a picture of it on Yelp and assumed it was smaller portions, but we were wrong. The sausage was tender and fresh on the inside, and the casing wasn't too tough. It came with a side of rosemary chips, which we couldn't even make a dent in because we also had to eat the roast beef.\\n\\nThe roast beef was a bit too much. Tons of meat, a huge chunk of cheddar, and I think it was pan fried in butter. It looked and felt like it would take years off my life. Ironically came with a side salad. Random story- the couple who showed up after us received the dinner menu instead and was jealous of our roast beef sandwich and asked what it was. I guess it looked good from a distance but I don't think I'd order it again. But then again I was so full after the first three dishes.

A little pricey for lunch, but the atmosphere was perfect.\\n\\nMy only major complaint is that we were seated at the last table in the back corner. There's a back exit, and for some reason this family could not control their kid and they had to storm out angrily chasing after him multiple times. It was one of the coldest days of the season so far, so it was annoying (combined with people who had legitimate reasons to leave out that exit).

I mean we are humans and we ALL make mistakes right? In life you learn that it doesn't matter how you make the mistake, it's what you do to fix it and more importantly that you learn to never make that same type of mistake twice. \\n\\nWith that being said... Cinco Mexican Cantina has definitely learned that lesson 100 folds over! The first time I went to Cinco my experience was not so pleasant, and I did voice my opinion not expecting anything in return but WOW! Did that establishment prove me wrong! It all started when the CEO of FIVE Restaurant Group (owner of the Cinco Mexican Cantina restaurants) called me personally (yes little ol' me) to apologize about my experience and invited me and my 30 guests back to the restaurant for dinner.\\n\\nWhen we arrived for the dinner party the customer service was outstanding! Our waiters- Tony and Levon treated us with 5-star service. Levon reviewed and explain in full detail about each item on the menu, I was totally impressed! Not only was I impressed but my guests were so happy.  One guests said I feel like I am on the Food Network because the wait staff was there for our every need! How could I forget the food... very very very good! My food was excellent; I had the grilled salmon with a jalape√±o potato cake and asparagus. This dinner was really for my guests because had it been just for me I would have never complained about the first dining experience, but my guests came to support me and I wanted to make sure they were happy and they were more than satisfied with our Re-do dinner yesterday!\\n\\nI learned a very important lesson- why not give a second chance?  You never know, the second chance might be a lasting impression.  I will remember Cinco Mexican Cantina as a restaurant with great service, suberb food, cool atmosphere and amazing customer service!

Great? no, not really.  Interesting and well prepared, but nothing that made me go \\"wow\\".\\n\\nAm I spoiled? maybe.. but as I was sitting there, I was wishing that we had gone to Toro Bravo or Higgins, for some food that was really interesting.\\n\\nI was very excited to try the foi gras bon bon.. and after eating it.. was just \\"meh\\".. I prefer my fois gras simply seared. This was an interesting experiment.. but fell flat in my humble opinion.\\n\\nService was good.. but again, could have been better.  I was watching a female server and a male server who were involved in a very Funny conversation while we were watching our soup get cold on the counter. Other than that, they kept the wine flowing and water glasses filled.\\n\\nI too, think that $30 for every 750ml corked is a bit excessive, but after experiencing the wine flight ( $140 for  for 4 ) I know why they stick to their guns.  between the four of us, we consumed approximately 2 bottles of wine ( most of which I recognized and none have a retail of more than $15., most are less ).   So they easily made $100 on wine alone.  I should have brought the magnum of Oregon Pinot Noir I had planned.. would have saved us $50 and given us better wine to drink.\\n\\nI don't want to appear as if I'm slamming Beast, because I'm not.   I think it's a great experience and for $100+tip per person, it is definitely something every foodie should try once.

This may sound silly, but on our week long honeymoon in Portland, OR my wife and I ate here 3 different times.  That should tell you how incredible this place is. \\n\\nThe Food: \\nThe first time we ate here it was 8pm and we sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender.  After some small talk and a few recommendations, we decided upon Mac n Cheese, Clam Chowder, Bacon Wrapped Dates, and a wonderful Parmesan salad.  Our favorite was the Mac n Cheese.  This and Clam Chowder is our must try at any restaurant that offers it.  Tasty n Sons blew us away with both Mac n Cheese and Clam Chowder.   \\n\\nThe second time we ate here was for the famous brunch that they are known for.  We were told that Tasty n Sons initially opened and only served brunch, then later added dinner.  So we had to try! Again, we were so impressed by the flavor of the Inventive menu.  We loved the Dutch Baby served with lemon curd and berry sauce, and their special for the day, the Roast Beef sandwich.  This sandwich was unlike any I had ever tasted.  Hands down the best RB sandwich I have ever had.  \\n\\nThe third and final time we ate here was on our last day in Portland on a Sunday. , and we decided to do the brunch.  We had a feeling that because it is famous for brunch that it would be packed. And we were right! Luckily, it was just the two of us and we were sat in only 15 minutes.  Unfortunately, the busyness significantly lowered the service by the wait staff and food runners/helpers.  We ordered the sunday special, the \\"Low Country Bambino\\" which took 35 minutes to arrive.  The people sitting next to us sat down and ordered, got their food, ate their food and finished before we even got our first plate.  I suspect the server forgot to put our order in, and didn't apologize, which surprised me (this is the reason for 4 stars).  The food of course was outstanding, and we were so hungry after waiting that long for our meal.  We also ordered the Shakashuba (spelling) which is cooked egg in a tomato sauce with bellpeppers served with bread. This was my favorite.  \\n\\nThe Ambiance:\\nFor dinner, the feel was romantic and fun, with cool music and nice laid back servers and bartenders. \\nFor brunch, things were a bit hectic, very loud and crammed.  With our food taking 40 minutes. \\n\\nIn all, wonderful place with a mostly great service.  Avoid the Saturday and Sunday brunch, unless you have just one or two people in your party.

The restaurant is a long-ish room with wooden benches/stoools along each side of the wall, rustic looking walls (made to look like they were made of mud), and Persian carpets lining most of the room. I do like the feel of the room albeit uncomfortable seating (their benches and stools are hard and pillows, far from soft). The ambiance is unique - you have to give it that. Nowhere else in Vancouver can you find someplace like this. You have live bands that play unique instruments like the tabla to entertain you, flamenco dancers gyrating through the night, impressive partner yoga demonstrations, and individuals reciting Rumi poems (yes, pretty deep! :p). Depending on the night, you might see a hodgepodge of performances but they are all fairly unique. The fact that their  band members also look/sound like foreigners also add to the exotic-ness of this place. For ~$30, you get all you can eat dinner. I find it a little steep given the variety (or lack thereof) of the food. Some are yummy, others palatable. Dessert is typically fruits, chocolate mousse, and rice pudding which is my least favourite (tough for me to have rice for dessert when rice is my staple growing up). Entree also depends on what they have for the night - it changes and I have had overcooked fish. I have heard their chai is tasty (chai isn't exactly my cuppa tea!). If I have friends visiting Vancouver, I do like to take them here. It's a different kind of experience (in a good way mostly) if you don't think too hard about whether or not you believe in their marketing/philosophies. Just go, be entertained, and prepare to overpay.

The salads are the highlight for me, so fresh and flavourful.  There was a chicken liver stew that was over the moon.  A dessert is also offered if you have room.  Don't forget the tea dispensed at the far end of the buffet table.  It is unusual in flavour and delicious.\\n\\nThe staff seem to be related to the owner.

We arrived around 6pm on a Friday to find out the pulled pork (what I came for) had already sold out. Other reviewers have mentioned that staples have been unavailable for them as well. It sounds like while others have had issues, management resolved their issues with freebies, which was not done for us as it can't be done for everyone as this continues to be an issue. I only paid $1 extra for my burnt ends but that's not what I wanted. My husband ordered Mac & cheese and corn bread as sides which were both dry.

Winsor Dim Sum is a busy restaurant, and the servers do not have time to engage in small talk. They exercise professionalism by respecting your privacy, and I appreciate that: I am not coming here to make friends, I am coming to eat.  Servers at other restaurants may check-in every five minutes to ask how your food is, and I hate that.  Servers here are attentive to your needs, but do not meddle or waste your time; they allow you space to enjoy your meal and your company.  For this reason, I have brought clients, partners, and colleagues here; I do not have to worry about my conversations being interrupted.  \\n\\nIf you enjoy frivolous and unnecessary conversations with a sever who is feigning interest in your life for a good tip, don't come here, because you won't find that.  What you'll find instead is a professionalism and a respect for privacy that is not available elsewhere.  \\n\\nPrevious reviews have also criticized frivolous aspects of the restaurant space itself, and while I cannot respond to all of them, I will highlight this one:  \\n\\nOne reviewer wrote that \\"the carpet smelled moldy.\\"  Really? Did it? Did you physically get on your knees and smell the carpet?  What a stupid comment to make. The carpet is fine.  I suppose it's common knowledge to sift through the irrelevant reviews but there is a lot of unnecessary negativity directed at this establishment.  \\n\\nWith regards to the food:  I have ordered nearly every available item off the \\"dim sum\\" and \\"special snacks\\" menus, and have not yet been disappointed.  I particularly enjoy the steamed roast pork buns, the steamed shrimp dumpling, and the fried sesame balls.  The steamed pork dumplings are also good, particularly if you are coming with a larger group (comes with 8 or 9 pieces).  As other reviews have mentioned, there are no carts, but this is actually very convenient if you are eating within a short timeframe; you can generally be confident that whatever you order will be at your table within 15 minutes.  Also, carts would not work very well here due to the space constraints, and would ultimately make the lines longer than they already often are.  I really enjoy this spot and consider it among my favorites in Chinatown and the greater Boston area due to the privacy, great food, and convenience."},{"name":"Taco Cabana","address":"8620 Burnet Rd.","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"I'm not a \\"foodie\\" nor to I claim to be.

We have spent the last 3 Mother's Day weekends at Renunion. The first year we had brunch downstairs at Forte, it was AMAZING! The following year (last year) they held the brunch at Eleven, it was fabulous. \\nThis year was a complete disappointment & a waste of money. I made reservations in March. When we got to the restaurant at 10:30am they did not have a table for us. There was a mistake with the number of guests in my party. I do understand that mistakes happen. However when we were finally sat it was a table all the way in the corner & no one even came over to get a drink order for a solid 10 minutes. I took my daughter up for a plate & nothing was labeled. Most items were lunch items. My daughter is 3 so she is very picky. I assumed since the previous 2 years had breakfast items it would have been similar. I was wrong. Way wrong. All my daughter would eat was a dinner roll. Finally I flagged down a waitress & asked if they could make her 1 scrambled egg. It seemed like a huge inconvenience to the staff. After my daughter ate her egg I told her she could have something off of the dessert table. She chose chocolate cake. She took a few bites of it & told me it tasted funny. I tried it & it had an alcoholic taste, again nothing was labeled. I asked and sure enough it had alcohol in it. Despite the FEW breakfast items they had my husband went to get Eggs Benedict & they told him he was not able to have it because the machine was broken. The bill for 9 of us was around $600.00. I barely ate anything myself. When we went to the pool we ordered food because we were still hungry. Very disappointed!

My dream Malaysian restaurant would be reasonably priced and focus solely on food that you would expect to stumble upon in a hawker's center over there (minus the \\"Western\\" stalls that sell beans on toast)- because when these restaurants start throwing pad thai, sesame chicken, and whatnot on the menu, things tend to fall flat.  It's similar to how some Chinese restaurants throw sushi on the menu because it's a trendy thing to do.  I cringed when I heard the couple next to me ask the waiter \\"What's your most popular noodle dish?\\" and his response was \\"Probably the Pad Thai.\\"  Sigh.  \\n\\nMy dream Malaysian restaurant doesn't seem to exist 'round these parts, so for now I'll be grateful that Island Hopper is around.  For dinner, I ordered the \\"roti island hopper\\" (aka roti prata), Mee Goreng, and a coconut juice (coconut water).  I got the vegetarian version of the roti, because usually I wouldn't expect anything to come in the curry served with roti besides the curry sauce itself.  What came was curry sauce with some fried tofu and potato chunks, but the flavor of the sauce and the texture of the roti was right on.  The portion of Mee Goreng was generous, and I thought it was pretty tasty.  The coconut water was really tasty- slightly sweeter than expected, and served over a large portion of shaved ice, with a couple of fresh coconut strips on top.  It wasn't quite the same as drinking out of a fresh young coconut and scooping out the tender coconut flesh, but it was a clever approximation of the experience.  Overall, I was quite pleased with my meal.\\n\\nIn summary- stick to what they do well (the Malaysian dishes), and be aware that prices are pretty high for some of the seafood dishes.  If you're looking for straight up Thai or traditional Chinese food, I'm sure you can find better."},{"name":"Cafe Fresh Bagel","address":"1155 Washington St","city":"Norwood","stars":"3.5","text":"Girls are amazing, bagels are wonderful.

This review is strictly for the sushi. I started with won ton soup and the ahi salad. I've had both of these at numerous restaurants. The soup was way too sweet and the ahi tuna had little flavor. It was just spicy and not flavorful. The ahi quality was low as well. Then we waited nearly an hour to get the 4 rolls that we ordered. The restaurant was less than half full and there were 3 sushi chefs so the wait was inexcusable. Nobody apologized either. The rolls had way too much rice which was stickier than most other places. The worst part about the rolls though was the lack of substance. It was all rice and no fish. I had the dragon roll and it didn't have more than 1 shrimp. The avocado on top might as well have not been there either. It was a total waste of money. Publix sushi is not much worse than the sushi here.

This was so great after the onslaught of carbs and sweet breakfast we had. Great depth of flavor..it's like chili but NOT!

I understand that this was probably a factor in our poor service but still. \\n\\nWhen I first walked in the door the host staff was either off work or something and didn't even make eye contact with us until a server came to help us out, although she was sitting behind the host stand. Which already but a bad taste in my mouth about the place. I was the first one there in a party of 12, and I was there early. I didn't mind waiting but we waited a good 25 minutes for them to just put two tables together. Mind you the restaurant only had maybe 6 tables occupied at the time. \\n\\nBy the time we sat down and everyone came in we wanted to order apps & drinks. We ordered a few guacamoles & cheese dips and margaritas and our server (who I still don't know his name because he never probably introduces himself) ended up forgetting two of them, which I let slide at first because hey, we're a big table with a lot of noise come from it. I get it. \\n\\nAfter my 2nd drink I finally just have to ask the server to take our order because it was getting late and I was hungry so I ordered the chipotle lime shrimp (which is awesome get it!) and the carnitas taco a la carte. It took about 35 minutes for our food to finally come out but I put that again on well we're a big table I know it takes a while, but I look around the restaurant and there's literally maybe four tables left all with food, so I get a little irritated by then. \\n\\nWhen our food finally arrives my taco is set in front of me and it looked so unappetizing. It looked like soggy slop on a tortilla..sick. Atleast the shrimp was good and I had eaten a number of chips and queso to subside my hunger. Our server forgets to tell one of the people at the table that they were out of spinach tortillas and didn't mention it until he came out with just a cup of saut√©ed spinach..mind you this guest is on a strict diet so needless to say he gets thoroughly upset. And the chicken fajitas he and one other was supposed to be sharing only had three pieces of chicken on it! So he really didn't even get to eat it. Finally he walked up to each wait staff in the building until he found our server and was like \\"what the hell is going on..you're forgetting orders, you couldn't even tell me that you were out of spinach tortillas until almost everyone was done eating?\\" He stormed back to the table all upset and the manager finally ended up coming over. \\n\\nAfter the manager came over things cooled down after he discounted all of our tickets and didn't charge us for what was forgotten. So when our server finally brings our tickets there are STILL things wrong or mixed on our tickets but just being tired and irritated everyone paid and left. \\n\\nMoral of this story: souly because of this wait staff and host staff I will not be returning to this restaurant. The food wasn't terrible but it's not worth returning to have that kind of service again. The manager handled it well, and the atmosphere is fun.

Came here on a very nice and sunny Thursday afternoon.   Parking around this place can be a little tricky as this strip of eateries are located between residential area and businesses.  Street parking in the residential areas are probably your best bet.  The crowd to this spot was busy but not crowded.  You order your food first then choose your table.  The space was a good size as it included a seating area outside as well.  We ordered the Hat Yai Combo  (fried chicken, sticky rice, roti and curry), Oxtail Soup, and the Hamachi Salad.  Oxtail Soup was very spicy... hubby loved it but I couldn't get past the heat.  The Hat Yai Combo was served on a tray with generous serving.   I found the fried chicken to be fairly salty for my taste, rice wasn't necessarily what I would prefer rice to eat as it was way too sticky, but I loved the roti with curry for dipping.  Curry had just enough heat and was a great complement to the roti.  But my favorite dish at this spot was their Hamachi Salad which was a special that day.  It had freshly sliced hamachi, pears, red onions chilis, shallots, mint and fish sauce.  It was such a simple dish but was so refined!  You had the salty taste from the fish sauce but was subdued just enough by the sweetness of the pears... probably one of the best hamachi dish I've tasted!  Although some of their dishes I tasted were a bit on the salty side, I applaud this place for keeping their Southern Thai culture in their food.   We will definitely come back to taste their other dishes."},{"name":"Cinco Mexican Cantina","address":"2851 Akers Mill Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Thursday night Happy Hour on the deck is fantastic!

My party was very understanding but we would have liked to know that information in advance, none the less the food finally came out and the issues grew from there. The 8 piece BBQ chicken was not cooked to perfection and still had chewy pieces not to mention a bit salty. The garden-Veggie pizza was luke warm and at first they forgot to add the chicken.

But the place is such a legend that my daughter convinced me that we needed to go.\\n\\nI'm glad we did, but I still wasn't 100% thrilled. I had Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache, which was delicious, except for the ganache. I guess I'm just not a fan of salted chocolate, because even though the texture was divine, I couldn't get past the flavor of the huge chunks. It might have worked better for me if the piece were smaller, but as it was, I just tried to eat them with a good portion of ice cream in there to try to balance the salty with the sweetness of the ice cream.\\n\\nNo complaints about the Chocolate Gooey Brownie, though! It was delicious and smooth, with big chunks of moist brownie and NO NUTS to interrupt the flavor. I'm a fan!\\n\\nMy daughter had Cow Pie, one of the flavors designed by a local grade school. It was chocolate mint with mint patties in it; very tasty, but could have used more patty pieces, in my opinion. Her second scoop of Snickerdoodle was a winner, though! Really delicious, and the cookie pieces were somehow soft without being soggy. Genius!\\n\\nThe line was about 15 feet out the door when we arrived, and though I didn't time it, the wait didn't seem that long. Maybe 25 minutes? But you get the full attention of the staff when you get to the front, and they're happy to give you samples until you find one that you like. A bit on the pricy side, for sure, so because of that and because of the distance we have to drive, for us this will be a very occasional special treat.

OH MY goodness they were phenomenal. Perfectly seared and served with yummy risotto and roasted brussel sprouts. I absolutely loved it. I was also impressed with their wine list. I had the Montepulciano which was such an awesome wine for $7. Our waitress was fantastic. It was obvious that she knew what she was doing and was proud to work for Mezzo. She answered all of our questions ( and there were a lot ). A lot of people have complained about the noise level being too \\"energetic\\", but we found conversating to be very easy. The ambience of this place is unrivaled in the area. Absolutely stunning. One thing I'd like to stress is that you should give Mezzo a second try if you've been there once and it didn't blow you away. It seems like they have really made some adjustments in order to cater to the reviews and negative comments about certain dishes. My server confirmed that when I asked her about the menu changes.

The place looks sketchy from the outside and only gets worse on the inside.  We arrived about a half hour after they opened on a Sunday.  The buffets were barely functioning and were only half full.  There was no clear instructions as to whether we should seat ourselves or wait for a server.  We waited for 5 minutes before anyone even glanced our way and then a server rolled her eyes at us and ushered us to a dingy torn up booth.  The table was disgustingly dirty and not a single attempt was made to clean it.  We should have left then but we were starving and were hoping the food might redeem our experience.  The food was awful.  Just awful.  Everything was fried, left to get cold, then re-fried.  The sushi had tofu instead of actual meat.  There was an entire dessert section made up of store bought items from places like Costco or BJ's.  I purposely picked the biggest pieces I could from the sweet & sour chicken hoping there was something other than batter.  There wasn't.  Our soft drinks were flat and the server took our glasses away to refill them and then brought them back.  Servers are supposed to get customers new glasses or refill at the table.  Overall it was one of the worst experiences at a restaurant that I have ever had.  I have traveled quite a bit and eaten some strange dishes but none as old, mangy, and disgusting as the dishes this restaurant serves.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the food. Maybe I picked the wrong items, but we were just there for lunch and everything was overly priced and they don't offer the lunch specials on the weekend, no even the lunch portions(crazy). So we started with the plantain cups filled with shredded beef and shrimp. The plantain was over cooked and almost burnt, so it made them dry too.  Next I had the red bean soup, which didn't taste much like soup, it was more like a side of beans which should of been eaten with rice.  Next was the steak sandwich, not impressed either, skimpy with the meat.  So in summary, not impressed with the food and definitely think their food is way over priced!  However service was very good and the two for one drinks are reasonably priced, that's how they lure you in.  Will maybe just have a couple of drinks next time.

My main complaints were the general heaviness/oiliness of the items we ordered and the lack of noting some key ingredients on the menu... Case in point: we ordered hush puppies - huge but delish - which came with what I think was jalepeno butter, but the menu didn't specify. We also ordered the radicchio salad, but I was disappointed to learn after a few bites that it had green olives in it, which I really loathe and wouldn't have ordered if I had known that. The lamb souvlaki was more of a lamb sausage with little piles of various pita toppings on top of a flatbread, which quickly got soggy.

They were great at accommodating food intolerances and allergies. Our waitress was super great and let us know it was actually mandatory to have a manager speak to us prior to ordering. He knew exactly what he was talking about and let us know, from memory, what we were able to eat. Dang. And the list was pretty long. They were also happy to accommodate us in making dishes we were able to eat. Bueno!\\n\\nI ordered a regular margarita to split with my mom- it was good. Strong, for sure. We all ordered some kind of combo, T ordered steak tacos with fries. The complimentary chips and salsa were great. And even when they accidentally put cheese on my plate, they were so quick to remake it and were super nice about it. I don't hold it against them because it was packed on a Friday night. I totally get it. \\n\\nThey have a balloon animal guy! Complimentary, but he deserves a good tip. He made a Spider Man. Seriously. I didn't know they could do that.

I enjoy the small plates experience, but Ping suffers the same downfall as its sibling, Pok Pok: it is overpriced. I understand I'm eating downtown, in a restaurant opened by a totally trendy chef in a proclaimed foodie city, so I am reasonable enough to understand there will be a premium on my experience. But my Kobe steak skewers should not, then, be chewy and gristly (the hot salt block the skewers are served on is a nifty presentation, but seemed to impart little flavor...if that was the point?).\\n\\nNot unsuccessful, but still disappointing skimpy, were the regular beef and prawn skewers. Much more intriguing was a special for the night, a lamb and noodle soup. Not the prettiest plate - the lamb was an unappealing gray, but each morsel was tender, and as flavorful as it was colorless. The broth was aromatic and delicate, a nice surprise given that the dish centered around a heavier red meat. \\n\\nAnd the hit of the night for me was the Chinese tea egg - as per the menu, \\"farm egg steeped in black tea, soy sauce, ginger, star anise and cinnamon.\\" I mean, I'm going to come across as a total hypocrite after complaining about value, and then recommending a $2.50 egg, but damn, this is where it was at! Something completely unexpected - slightly savory, slightly sweet, mightily delicious. If they were $2.00 or less, I would have probably ordered another on the spot.\\n\\nAnyway, even with five people at the table, there were still many items we didn't get to. With luck, more of those items are in the \\"hit\\" category, rather than the \\"miss\\". As it is, I won't likely return unless someone else suggests it. If I do, the tea egg will be the first thing ordered, and I'll cross my fingers for the rest of the meal.\\n\\n(Service = very good / aesthetic = good / drinks = so-so)"},{"name":"Burlington Cold Cut Center","address":"195 Cambridge St","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"i have gone there many, many times.  past xmas eve order tray of chk ziti broccolo with other items.  xmas day tray was sour. had to toss it out.  wrote a letter saying not expecting anything monetary, just wanted to let them know.  did not even receive acknowledgement.  very disappointed in that."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"While I like the food here, it really rubbed me the wrong way when we stopped in for dinner around 9:20 on a weeknight only to be told by the staff that they were closed without any other explanation.

Either way, he wasn't on top of his game, especially for a sunday. \\nOnto the good...\\n\\nI got the 'No meat for you Omelette' and it was fantastic! Fluffy, perfectly salted and peppered eggs wrapped around a nice pile of buttery but not overcooked veggies and herbed ricotta! The potato rosti was a nice little cake of hashbrowns, crisped on either side. Could have used a little more flavor and a little longer on each side but still really good. Interestingly enough it didn't come with Toast and the server explained that they make their bread from scratch and they would have to have a whole separate storefront if they served toast with everything..which didn't make much sense to me...so I ordered a side of toast and by the time it got there I was done with my meal, even though I ate really slow...and the toast was cold. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had the 'go home thomas' or something..which by the way, the names of the food really annoyed us for some reason.

I trust that a lot of people do the same as well and luckily for us, parking enforcement is pretty lax over there.\\n\\nWe were a party of 11 and to be honest it was a bit of a blur. We only had a bowl of soy sauce and a bowl of satay sauce for the table; not sure if we could have asked for sesame sauce or green onions. What I do remember was that the menu was in both English and Chinese and conveniently described exactly how many pieces of each item 1 order meant (e.g. beef was 4 pieces each order). We had a large table and there was a imbedded stove in the middle and we were given a portable gas stove as well. There were a lot of soup bases to choose from with differing prices. We decided on the a pork-bone soup/tomato and fish soup mix for the pot with the grill and steamer, plus a chicken soup base for the individual. I didn't find that the soup had a big impact on the flavour of the food though. Usually I go for satay which is not too spicy and gives the meats and seafood a bit of flavour.\\n\\nUs group of guys ordered every meat they had, maxed out on the oysters (1 per person), got a lot of tofu-based items, and some veggies too. My favourites were the bean curd, boneless short rib, pork belly, pork jowl, lamb slices, and cuttle fish paste. Some of the meat balls were supposed \\"hand-made\\" but didn't taste like it so I would avoid those. I've never had a grill-steamer-hotpot and was excited to try it out. They had a grease sheet on the grill which I appreciated and helped the meat not stick to the grill. We tried grilling beef, beef cubes, and pork jowl and the results were pretty good, but it took kinda long to cook. For the steamer, we tried the fish slices and that went really well. The fish was still quite tender even if we put the fish in there for half an hour.\\n\\nWe spent around 3 hours there, over the 2 hour limit, but wasn't rushed out. Service was average: the food came out somewhat quickly, tea refills was hard to get. Getting everything we ordered was a bit of a hit or miss: certain items we always got, some took a few tries such as the fish skin (not that good) and bean curd (so good, ordered a bunch of those). I would say that the food was general fresh and the veggies seemed clean.\\n\\nI'll come back if someone invites, but otherwise I would prefer Mongolian Hot Pot instead where the soup bases have a lot of flavour (maybe a lot of MSG, but I'll ignore that) which makes the food taste so much better and it's around the same price as well."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I work just down the street from fresh roll and have gotten so tired of my usual lunch spots.

When we arrived the place was dead which I thought was strange for a Friday but we had been looking forward to steak so decided to give it a try.  We sat outside and the staff took quite a while to get over to us.  Once arrived, our server was very friendly. Hubby ordered the cowboy steak rare and sadly it arrived grey with no sear. The fat wasn't even rendered.  The ribs were good - if you have to order something- I would go this route.  I had the filet medallions  and they were good.  Not great - when you are spending good money - you want great.We called over the manager and frankly he was really unapologetic about it. We asked if maybe they had let the executive chef go home early but he assured us that the chef was there and that he had many years of experience with Manny's.  They took the steak off the bill.

The homemade muffin/scone bites that you get right as you're seated to hold you over until the food arrives are usually delicious and are a perfect little nom. \\n\\nOne thing I've noticed about their food is that they let the flavors stand for themselves. So if you're used to blasting your taste buds with over-salted, over-sweetened, artificially flavored food-like substances, you might not enjoy Toast because you won't be able to savor the subtle, real flavors. I've noticed that some reviewers define Toast's food as \\"bland\\" or \\"tasteless\\". I was shocked to read this, as I have never once had to salt my food there, and I have always found the meals to have complex and well-balanced flavors. If you generally prefer to eat artificial or heavily processed foods, you should probably head to Wendy's or Denny's for a more satisfying experience. \\n\\nHowever, if you enjoy fresh, elegant, well-balanced and genuine flavors, well-cooked food, simple and attractive presentation, and kind and friendly service, you should try Toast.\\n\\nThe Breakfast Club (available on Friday, \\"Club Day\\") and the Occasional Hedonist are standouts. I've had the Vegan scramble and it was superb. But keep an eye out for their funky Blue Plate specials, which are frequently adventurous and worthy of the brave. \\n\\nThe only negative experience I've had is needing to remind a server a couple of times for a pitcher of milk for my tea. But I had to scour my memory banks in order to remember a bad thing about Toast. When gently reminded by me, my server did a facepalm and said, \\"I'm so sorry! Let me get that for you right away\\", then brought it right to the table. It was a busy morning, and I'm not going to bitch them out because they forgot one little thing. In general, if you're pleasant to them, they will be pleasant to you. But doesn't this apply to the world at large? Welcome to real life, folks.\\n\\nIf you don't want to wait at least 45 minutes to get a table, you should get there before 8:30am on the weekend. I wish people wouldn't whine about it this - it's just the way things are. I challenge anyone to find a table at a good Portland breakfast joint after 9am on the weekend.

The spicy wonton dish had a somewhat commercial tasting soy-based spicy sauce on it and the wontons in the soup dish came in a fairly salty soup broth with a few pieces of American broccoli (cooked nicely al dente, I should say).  Most of the wonton ingredient was pork - my companion found something that looked like a small shrimp inside one of his but neither of us could really taste anything but pork. The ingredients and preparation for both of the main dishes were OK but not light or fresh to the taste.

I have been to the Border Cafe in Saugus quite a few times, andI would go there more often if it weren't for several things. \\n\\nLet's start with what is good. The food. (Notice I didn't say fantastic, just  good. But good is good, right?) Their ingredients are fresh, and their spices are authentic. The chips are made fresh and put on your table and the SALSA DOESN'T HAVE TOO MUCH CILANTRO IN IT. The black beans taste like black beans should - not gummy and the beans are individuated. The rice is the same - not a coagulated mass...it's well made. guacamole is great. \\n\\nMoving on to service....I'm almost always disappointed. The servers seem like they really WANT to be better than they are...but they forget the water, or bring the wrong beverage, or just forget to come over to take your order for 20 minutes. And this segues nicely into my next point...the utter CHAOS that is this dining room. I can understand family style, and I can even admit that there is something desirable *sometimes* about a loud, talkative room. But on a busy friday night it's like eating in the bus station. How can you expect the servers to remember anything in this madness? \\n\\nDrinks....good. Margaritas are great, their wines are even a decent selection, though I pronounce anything served in a water glass \\"mer-lawt\\" They have all the obscure mexican beers like Tecate and suchlike, so that's good. The bar is a fun little singles farm, though with any place on Route 1 north of the city, you takes your chances with the guidos wearing satiny warmup pants and puffy jackets. \\n\\nHere's the verdict: If you're going out with a whole group of your favorite loudmouths, you don't mind asking twice for your Negro Modelo and you want some good Mexican grub...head up to Saugus."},{"name":"MJ O'Connor's","address":"425 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Most bland tasting over priced food I've eaten in a while.

The scallops are arranged over the gelato scoop.  Aji Amarillo (yellow chili pepper) sauce is drizzled in an artistic swirl along the sides of the plate, adding some heat to the dish while creating the finishing touch to a very pretty plate of food.\\n\\nRainbow trout in a leek and radish both, with a sundried tomato tapenade:  My favorite dish of the night.  My companions and I scooped up every last bit of this flavorful \\"soup\\", and then we ordered another one.\\n\\nTres Leches cake with peach sorbet:  the cake part was not as dense or rich as traditional Tres Leches, but this lighter version worked well with the delicateness of the refreshing peach sorbet.\\n\\nPopcorn and a Movie: \\"Buttered Popcorn\\" gelato and a \\"homemade\\" candy bar, drizzled with a root beer sauce and sprinkled with bits of caramel corn.

There were large pieces of ham in them. The potato casserole was also good. I do like the idea that you can get a drink with a souvenir cup but paying over $2 for a drink is a bit much. I will say that most restaurants have gone up on their drink prices. If you order 2 drinks its almost as much as having an extra person ordering a meal.

You can definitely tell they're still working the kinks out of being a relatively new restaurant. We decided to give it a go anyways. \\n\\nMy friend and I got \\"small plates\\", he got the bayou tacos and collards, and I got the hog and hooch biscuit. Neither were good. \\n\\nOur waitress greeted us and talked in a corny southern accent. We weren't sure if she was just messing with us or if they make their staff fake the funk of being southern. As a son of the south, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. \\n\\nFor beers, this place only has hipsterish local beers. If it wants to be southern where is the lone star, shiner bock, or any other southern staple? Also it took about 6 minutes for my friend to get his bud light can. \\n\\nThe hog n hooch biscuit consists of a wicked buttery biscuit half with some pork belly and a fried green tomato, with some peppers/relish on top. The pork belly was not good, had more of a beef jerky consistency and not really flavorful. The biscuit was good, and the tomato was meh. Overall, about a 4 out of 10. \\n\\nThe tacos were tiny, for 3 of them it did not feel like you were eating 3 of them. Flavor was there but for the price you can definitely do better. Probably should be served with 4 since they are so small. The collards were really good though. He gave them a 4 out of 10 as well\\n\\nOverall, we will not be going back there. There's a lot better food in assembly row too, even if you're hankering for \\"southern comfort\\".

And maybe it did say \\"wedges\\" on the menu, but in our minds we were picturing the loaded \\"skins\\".\\n\\nMy wife had the pulled pork sliders....also yummy.

Praise to the waiting staff that having a massive parallel start, managed to take our order by 11:05 and most dishes were on the table by 11:15.  My disappointment came from the lackluster menu.  There was little choice and not much of surprises or creativity.  No special of the day whatsoever.  The coffee is diner style - bland and watery.

In Portland, we vegans are lucky with regard to restaurants -- nearly every restaurant has at least one vegan option, many have multiple explicitly vegan options, and we even have multiple all-vegan restaurants. It is axiomatic that there will almost always be SOMETHING a vegan can order on the menu, regardless of the restaurant. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule, like Tasty 'n Sons. I was very surprised to see not a single all-vegan item on the menu. \\n\\nSo, I asked if I could have the potatoes side dish without the egg and aioli, and instead substitute the spinach they make for a different dish. The answer was no. Tasty 'n Sons does not do substitutions. I was told I was welcome to order both dishes without the eggs or aioli, but the price wouldn't differ. So I ordered the potatoes bravas alone. Actually, they were very good, but I thought that charging me $7 for them was a bit much.\\n\\nI realize that if you have a very busy restaurant that it's probably difficult for the line cooks to make anything different, like a substitution. But you know what? Plenty of other restaurants have no problem doing that. So what's your problem, Tasty 'n Sons? My wife (not a vegan) loves your food, as did her parents who came with us.

Finally I had the chance with my partner and we just needed some Chinese food, rice noodles to be exact.\\n\\nIt was dark, and suprisingly enough it was not the easiest to find parking. There is an abundant amount of parking around here, just park anywhere on the street, but you have to remember this is Kingsway, and if your going to park across the street, that is quite a few lanes you have to play 'Frogger' over to not get hit by a car, so I kept on looking for a spot on the restaurant side.\\n\\nWhen we got in, it was your standard congee-noodle type place, simple flooring, so if you spill anything it can be moped up, simple tables and it was roomy enough. Standard procedure, sit down, white tea pot with the right amount of tea cups for your party at the table with some menus and chopsticks in a bunch for you to set up yourself, nice and simple.\\n\\nTwo orders of rice noodles (or lai fun in Cantonese for all of you who know!) and the dishes came fast.

It's not bad but seems more mediocre than the restaurant south.  We could live with that and not even yelp about it, but, our last visit was a deal breaker for going to the north store.\\nWe were one of two tables seated for a weekend lunch.  The food was still ok and still 'mediocre' but what really bothered us was that there were about 30+ glasses of water and maybe another 20+ glasses of tea half filled.  We noticed that we (and the other table) each got one of the water glasses (and tea).  The restaurant makes it 'convenient' for themselves by having half full glasses of water and tea, and all the wait staff have to do is throw in some ice and serve. Yuk.  I have a serious problem about that.  How long was the water and tea sitting there? An hour, overnight?  Did any critters find their way into the glasses (airborne or otherwise)? See when I don't see someone fill my water glass from empty, I wonder about these things and my mind can go to dark places.\\nThe second thing is that, after we got our food, there were only about 3 tables in the restaurant.  The staff obviously wasn't busy but we never once got our water glasses refilled, despite the subtle clues (empty glass at end of table, occasional 'thump' of an empty glass, etc.)  It might have not mattered as much but spicy food requires ample water.\\nSo that's it, no more north store.

It's not wheelchair accessible, it's catered towards the college student set who can be a finicky bunch anyway. There are about 20-25 tables for up to groups of 8-12, although they can certainly accomodate your needs if you ask them to. \\n\\nThe first thing that will hit your table will be glasses of water. I never had any trouble reading the menu. It's a fun and unusual concept that caters to the customer. There are so many ways to create noodle dishes (which can have pan friend, spagetti, udon, etc) with grilled or fried chicken, beef, tofu, veggies, etc. You also have choices in sauces as well as extras. \\n\\nThe menu is really not that hard to read, and you can always select from their \\"Lazy Street\\" which shows the standard items without the jazzed up details.\\n\\nThey are usually pretty good about getting your order to you and are generally pretty friendly, if perhaps overzealous in filling your water. The less friendly help tends to disappear after a while, so don't sweat it if you get a bad waiter/waitress. They also have student specials that are great for late night/study snacks or for people on a tight budget. \\n\\nOn cold nights soup or tea can be great. Tea comes in nice single serving pots.\\n\\nRecommended items: Chicken or beef satay, spring rolls, fried rice, yellow curry, pad thai, pad see-yew, thai iced tea, and to end it, fried ice cream."},{"name":"Cask & Larder","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Really loud.

I went on a Friday evening about a month ago and was fortunate to be seated immediately at the oyster bar without reservations. Score!\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\nBlood & Sand. Duck Breast. Service. Ambiance.\\n\\nAs weird as the name may sound, the Blood & Sand was awesome. I am a whiskey fan, so this drink was right on target for me. It also looks nice in the glass, which is a bonus.\\n\\nOnce again, my entree did not disappoint. The Duck Breast comes with grits, caramelized onions, and blackberries, and the onions are soaked/sauteed in coffee beans. So freaking good. I polished off the whole plate with ease, and I enjoyed myself in the process. I enjoyed this more than the Lamb Heart I tried before, but I still recommend both.\\n\\nAs usual, the staff were courteous and friendly, as well as knowledgeable about the menu items. The ambiance is still engaging, though I prefer a regular table to the oyster bar seating.\\n\\nThe Not-as-Good:\\n\\nWaffle Fries. Fried Dough.\\n\\nThe Waffle Fries were pretty much my favorite menu item from my last visit. I mean, wow. The acidity, the not-too-crispy fries smothered in gravy, the sourness of said gravy, the cheese... Oh my word. The Waffle Fries this time around were too crispy, and some were almost burnt. This ruined the dish for me because the main delicious factor from the previous visit was how the fries would get slightly soggy from being smothered in gravy. The fries were crispy and didn't really pick up the gravy the way I would have liked, which was disappointing. I feel like frying potatoes shouldn't be that difficult, so it felt a bit sloppy to me.\\n\\nThe Fried Dough was not only not fresh (an unfortunate part of sitting at the oyster bar was being able to watch the desserts be pulled out of their respective containers and placed on a plate), but the caramel was runny this time. I'm not sure if that's how it was supposed to be, but the caramel the last time was freaking phenomenal, and was much firmer. This time the caramel was still tasty, but it felt more like the dipping sauce for the doughnuts, which was disappointing.\\n\\nOverall, I'm still definitely a fan, and I look forward to my third visit, but I hope that they keep the food consistent, and consistently good at that. 4 stars."},{"name":"Sweet Hereafter","address":"3326 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"So I'm definitely no vegetarian or vegan but I have to say the food here is AMAZING! tofu curds! to die for.

We actually had a 10 minute wait between getting my dish and my husband's, and I'm not one of those rude people who eats while the person I'm with just sits there.  Hold onto my dish in the kitchen if one is taking longer, but don't serve a table just one plate while the other person sits there.

Today I actually had food IN my hand when the guy took my plate - he didn't even wait til I myself had eaten, and my husband was not even half through his.

The wine glasses themselves are the cheap crappy variety purchased at 15 cents a pop from a bulk wholesaler. Not professional tasting wine glasses. \\n\\nThe experience is far less luxurious and sophisticated than wine tasting should be. You are handed a four page menu, where the days \\"selections\\" (AKA only bottles open) are checked off with a black sharpie. A very small selection - maybe 3 Pinots, a cab and a couple of other red blends on the sweeter side. The same goes for the white wine page. The selection of wines is far from impressive and can be found on the lower shelves of most local grocery stores.\\n\\nUpdate: Harassing messages from owner.

The service was slow as the restaurant was busy. Our waitress was training another waitress at the same time, so it was distracting. Another waiter was filling up water glasses as well. Lots of activity but no food. \\n\\nSmall plates: deviled eggs (although small with three pieces/plates, so we had to order 2 for party of 4). The yolk was creamy and the combo of the fish eggs, pickled shallots and cured ham was good. The hog and hooch biscuit was good as well, but the pork belly may have been just a little overcooked. Both dishes would order again. \\n\\nLarge plates: shrimp and grits was the best dish overall. The chicken and waffle was okay- sad that it didn't come by country gravy like they do in the South. The chicken was nicely fried and surprisingly the white breast meat wasn't overcooked and dry. The waffle was fluffy but didn't taste much of the Cheddar or chives. While the Mac and cheese and cornbread were fabulous (sides to the ribs plate), the ribs were not. Similar to another review, the ribs were cold. It was very odd to eat a cold dish expecting it to be at least warm. The flavor wasn't to die for, but the cornbread was one of the best. Soft and buttery, too bad it was only a small piece. \\n\\nHad no room for homemade pies but they sounded delicious. Will have to make a return trip to try. \\n\\nCocktails: both the peach daisy and the one with raspberry mint were strong and fruity.

I was very excited there was one opening closer to my home.  My family went for lunch close to when it first opened and were very disappointed with the food.  My hummus wrap, which is huge and fresh at the Brookline location, was skinny and sad.  My daughter ordered a grilled cheese which came with the bread barely 'toasted', not grilled, and the cheese not melted.  I chalked the experience up to it being new and crazy and they hadnt found their groove yet.  Fast forward to last Friday, when my husband and I stopped in at 9:00 am.  The place was empty except for 2 parties of 2.  The hostess greeted us with a friendly smile and hello.  We decided we would just sit at the counter.  We sat down and there was a waitress right there doing some side work.  She didn't look up at us, didn't turn around, nothing.  After about 2-3 minutes she turned to us, plopped down menus and said \\"ya want some coffee?\\"  No hello, nothing.  Ok, fine. We both wanted coffee.  After pouring it I asked for a glass of water.  She said nothing, no acknowlegement that she even heard me.  I did get the water though.  We placed our order, my husband got an omelette and I got a couple of eggs and sourdough toast.  After a few minutes, I got up to go to the ladies room.  Apparently, at that point my husband noticed food sitting in the pickup window, (the advantage of sitting at the counter).  Super waitress was still standing there doing her side work.  When I came back and sat down, my husband said, \\"I think thats our food there.  Its been sitting there since you left.\\"  After another 2-3 minutes, our waitress brought it to us.  She put down my dish in front of me and it literally had a pool of oil sitting in the center of my over-easy eggs.  I asked as nicely as I could, (not to upset super waitress), if I could have new eggs.  she took the plate and gave it back to the cook and asked him to remake them with just 'butter spray, no oil'.  He acted as if he didn't understand and kept making her repeat it.  I piped up and said, \\"if its easier, I will have them poached.\\"  She said, \\"oh, no, you don't want that, the first poach of the day takes forever.\\"  Ok.  Got my eggs back and noticed that I didn't have sourdough, just plain old white toast, that mind you, was not re-toasted while my new eggs were made, as were my deep fried potatoes masquerading as homefries.  Both were left to sit in the window getting cold and hard while waiting for my eggs.  At this point, I kind of gave up, as we had an appointment to get to and I knew if I said anything else, I would not be eating at all, or worse.  Mind you, this is not an inexpensive breakfast.  Our bill for 2 small egg dishes and 2 coffees was over $25.  Now, I don't mind paying more money for good food.  This was NOT good food.  Even if everything else was fine, the fact that they are just deep frying their homefries is ridiculous, and the nasty attitude of super waitress who was clearly doing me a favor is totally unnecessary.  I was a waitress for 20 years and this behavior is uncalled for.  While the Brookline Zaftig's is just as expensive, the food and service is always great.  I will not go back to the Natick Zaftig's."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It was a late night and didn't want anything heavy, so I settled on two sides: brussel sprouts & cauliflower soup.

At about 7:45pm on a weekend the hostess said to expect a wait for 45 minutes, maybe even an hour. Ok, fair enough. This wait turned into 1 and 25 minutes. My girlfriend and I had a glass of wine each while we waited. The manager apologized about the wait and said he'd make it up to us. When we were seated he said the first round was on him. We thought this meant our drinks or appetizers. Although his intentions were great (you can't predict how long people are going to loiter at their table when you are trying to seat another party) he failed to follow through. What he ended up doing was sending over a complimentary appetizer that we did not order. Why send something over we did not order when there were things we actually wanted he could have comped? I'm not looking for freebies but in my mind the manager would have been better off saying nothing. \\n\\nOne other note before the food. The very friendly and knowledgeable waitress asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and we told her we were. When this is asked a drink or desert or something is usually comped. Again, I am NOT expecting anything for free but I just don't understand why'd you be nosey and ask if you were not going to do anything special. This and the manager were very minor items; overall service was above par. \\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes had great flavor but the batter fell off the tomatoes. This being said, I would not hesitate to order the dish again. The buffalo mozzarella was literally one of the top five mozzarella's I have ever had. \\n\\nThe tenderloin in au jus sauce and prime rib with muhummara sauce were excellent., and cooked to near perfection. I was pleased to see the muhummara sauce not drowning my steak. \\n\\nThe side of potato au gratin was excellent. Collard greens could have been cooked a little bit more to soften them up. The ratatouille was a great version of the French classic. It had a great flavor from just the right amount of roasted tomatoes. \\n\\nThe Butcher Shop has a great selection of cheese with many options form the local New England area. The Drunken Goat from CT was not on the list but out server suggested it and it did not disappoint. \\n\\nThe the blueberry cobbler could have been a little bit more sweet for me, but, if you do not like very rich deserts this would be a great choice. The creme fraiche ice cream was delicious but served too cold for my taste. \\n\\nFinally, it was refreshing to have a server who was knowledgeable about wine. We told her a specific wine region and she showed us many option and explained the grape composition to us. \\n\\nI am very excited to come back to The Butcher Shop. I just don't think I'll be back on the weekend. \\n\\nAnother note beyond the food is that this place should really take cell phone numbers to call you when your table is ready because the restaurant is so crowded. The butcher block in the back of the restaurant is an interesting concept. It takes about one third of the restaurant's space and is the only area to have a drink or small bit before your table is ready. I just waited by the door because the butcher block area was way too crowded. I really think they should take cell phone numbers in such a small space."},{"name":"McMenamins Tavern & Pool","address":"1716 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We came here because it was just a block from our hotel, and I had heard of the Mcmenamin brothers and wanted to check out one of there many places. \\n We first ordered a Hammerhead beer, It was nice, crisp and refreshing. \\nTo start we shared Hummus Plate,  ($8.95) It came with marinated olives and onions, cucumbers, carrots,  tomatoes, feta, pita bread.

The brisket is out of this world, and everything else is solid BBQ fare. They keep their local micro-brew taps current, and the music is as soulful as a BBQ joint should be.\\n\\nA helpful tip - I've heard that if you go later in the evening on a slow night, they load the platters with more meat.

The service was excellent, although the pace slowed down a bit too much after dinner was served and the restaurant got crowded.  Some of the portions were smaller than we are used to - definitely plenty to eat, but nothing left for take home. \\n\\nThe price in my estimation is closer to $$$, primarily because everything is a la carte.

My wife had the shrimp lo-mein and the crispy spring rolls.  We also ordered the steamed clams.  This was my first visit, so I didn't know what to expect...but I wasn't disappointed.  The #47 pork dumplings were simply out-of-this-world delicious.  I could've easily eaten 4 or 5 orders of them by myself.  They were fresh and hot and just melted in my mouth.  The crispy spring rolls and hot & sour soup were okay...nothing wrong with them, but nothing really special, either.  There doesn't seem to be any meat in either one of them, and I'm a carnivore...I like a little chicken in my hot & sour soup and some pork or shrimp in my fried spring rolls.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp lo-mein, but wished there were more shrimp in it.  The clams were excellent, but they use just a little too much oyster sauce on them for my taste.  The pork buns were good, but I would like them even more if the filling was just a little less sweet and a little more savory.  The sesame balls for dessert were outstanding.  Those are a must-eat.  Service is good and efficient, but more business-like than friendly.  Place is small and doesn't really jump out at you from the street, but I would definitely eat here again, if for no other reason than the pork dumplings.

Extra points if it makes you feel super hip. Cue Beat Hotel.\\n\\nBeat Hotel is not a hotel at all. I know. CRAZY, right? Misleading names are hip. As is the space. The funky interior decor of the large room features hemp. Hip hemp. The stage is on the far end of the restaurant, so from where we were sitting the music wasn't too loud and provided a nice backdrop to our conversation. If you're more into the jazz part of jazz brunch, try to sit closer to the stage because I kept forgetting about the performers.\\n\\nThe waitress arrives and says she's here to \\"guide us through our brunch experience.\\" We're pumped. Every brunch should be an experience.\\n\\nMy buddies' bloody mary's are savory and spicey. They dig 'em. I order some tea, but for some reason the waitress brings a third bloody mary along with it. She's confused and asks if we want it.\\n\\"Well... I don't really need another one. Will it just be thrown in the trash if we don't take it?\\" asks my thirsty but broke friend ($10 for a b'mary - no matter how tasty - is no joke). \\n\\"Probably\\" is the only response my friend receives. We don't want to straight up ask our waitress if it would be free, but my friend assumes so and agrees to take it. I mean, we can drink it if we really have to.\\n\\nAnd the food? Also hip. Classic brunch staples with a twist appear alongside more nontraditional offerings like bowls a la Life Alive in Central. I opt for the Inca bowl which features a nice mix of quinoa, avocado, greens, hominy, and other tasty morsels. You can pick your protein, and I opt for poached eggs. It's brunch, after all. The eggs were not runny at all, so I don't know what they think a poached egg is, but the mix of goodness was yummy, filling, and at least seemed healthy. A brunch slam dunk.\\n\\nMy other friend enjoyed her soy-based Earth bowl, and my more traditional brunch copatriot dug into her American breakfast featuring truffled scrambled eggs, bacon, and skinny frites that rivaled McD's in tastiness with far more class. Triple hip.\\n\\nThe check comes around, and y'all this place ain't exactly cheap. We're disappointed to see that that extra bloody mary was in fact charged. Not hip. We were deciding whether we should be annoying and ask about it, when a manager comes up to our table saying that she heard us say something was \\"obnoxious\\" and wanted to see if it was something to do with the restaurant. The walls have ears! Embarrassing. We then explain the bloody mary mishap, and she agrees that it shouldn't have been charged. It was so nice of them to go out of their way to make sure we were pleased with our experience (albeit a little creepy that they were listening to our conversations.. who knows what else they heard)!\\n\\nA nontraditional, hip brunch experience is waiting for you at Beat Hotel.

The buttered noodles were fine, it was a little too al dente for my liking, it could've used another minute, but it was fine. As for the pork, there was nothign wrong with the way it was cooked, it was just not flavorful. It tasted a bit too salty and the sauce didn't add anything to the flavor. \\n\\nThough, one good thing about the food was the bread. The bread and butter in the beginning were very good. The butter was clearly european butter and the bread was very good. It was nice and crusty and buttery and warm and chewy and good.

Plus, if you have the wine pairing, your wine is usually consumed with your food, so you don't have anyting to sip on between courses except for water. Like I said, the food was really createive and tasty. It was just hard to sit there watching the staff prepare each course and realize it would be another 10-15 minutes before you got any food again.

After those two hours passed, I called Rino's and was told that there were 14 parties in front of us, and the wait could be another two hours. We were already pretty committed to having dinner there, so we decided to hang out a little longer at Kelly's Pub. An hour and a half later I called again and was told there were still 10 parties ahead of us and it could be about a two hour wait. At this point we called it a night and picked up take-out on the way home. I finally got the call at 10:15 that our table was available, nearly five hours after we put our name in.

The vegetarian stuffing is well seasoned and the grape leaves were firm without being hard and moist without being soggy.\\n\\nThe falafel was very well prepared and not overly fried.  Great flavor and texture, especially when paired with Habibi's excellent tahini.\\n\\nThe tabouli was very good and wonderfully fresh.

I still have yet to learn the correct information regarding the ownership, is it the same as before, partly different or a complete overhaul? At first glance it appears to be more or less the same place, with a few new items on the menu (namely subs) but a familiar West-Coast style burger. The focus is still burgers, done simply and prepared quickly, I was in and out in under twenty-five minutes, call it fast-food if you will (I will) and realize that with an interior so small, it has to be fast-food. I loved Flippin' Burgers, it was beefy, the perfect size, affordable and downright delicious. Lee's is almost identical in every way, except for two major flaws, the beef and the fries. Gone are the fresh, knock your socks off beefy burgers, only to be replaced with 100% Sirloin, (bleh) pre-formed, probably pre-frozen patties. It's a thin patty, at first thought appearing to be juicy, but quickly realizing it's tomato water, not beef fat dripping down on my plate. It's got no personality (a real buzz word for me lately) and is as run-of-the-mill as you'll see in a burger. And it's such a shame, because every other aspect is top-notch. For $9 you can order a bacon cheeseburger and a small order of fries, with free toppings to boot, and incredibly fresh one's at that. The lettuce, tomato, and bun are all perfect complements to what used to be a great sandwich, with the house sauce (a kind of spicy mayo) adding the perfect finishing touch. The fries feel frozen too, crispy yes, but un-salted and standard all the way, nothing special. I have to mention the service, which is phenomenal, family-run, they are amazingly attentive and friendly, passionate, and you can feel the good vibe from everyone in there. I'm just sad for my lost love, the burger that once was, and now is forgettable in every way. I just can't understand why you would close down, re-open with very little changes, except cheapen out on the quality of the burger, when, after-all, you are a burger place.

Everyone seemed fine with plain ol' ice cream and all of a sudden we have places serving it up, a pinkberry opening, and orange leaf carpet bombing Massachusetts by making sure every single town has a franchise. And now we have Top it Your Way Yogurt Bar, which at the very least wins the award for having the most unoriginal and un-catchy business name ever. \\n\\nThis has pretty much the same setup as Orange Leaf only it's a kind of a flat corridor instead of a fancy curved wall. Grab a cup and fill it up with whatever you want. The price is the same (.49 / ounce) which means if you go crazy with the coco puffs and hot fudge you're going to paying out the ass. They have dispensers for the dry toppings like cereal and sprinkles, pumps for the sauces and a bar to scoop on toppings like fruit. A bunch of yogurt flavors (only it seemed like less than Orange Leaf... not sure) and tons of toppings (which seemed like more than Orange Leaf..but again, not sure). \\n\\nCompared to Orange Leaf I actually liked this place better. Maybe it's because I didn't completely butcher my yogurt with a stupid amount of toppings. I got a tart/blackberry mix with a little bit of granola. It cost less than 5 bucks and was absolutely fantastic, I had to resist going up for more. This place also has a little card where you get a free cup if you buy 9 yogurts (which seems like it would be pretty easy to scam given you pay for the ounce). \\n\\nGiven the choice, I would go to this place over Orange Leaf just because I liked what I got better. It's a solid choice if you're in the area and dying for some \\"froyo\\" and the price is right if you don't go off with the toppings. Just remember not to trick yourself into thinking you're eating something that's healthier than ice cream when you load up on 10 dollars worth of marshmallow sauce and peanut butter cups."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I hate to give this place only one star, but I was just very put off by what I experienced.

Friends of ours--who happened to live right up the street--had raved about it time and time again, so there was a considerable amount of hype and excitement to try it. On my first visit, I had very high hopes, and was just a bit let down. While I cannot pinpoint my disappointment exactly, it was just a little meh. The food was OK; there were no obvious offenses--I think I just happened to order a bit outside of my taste preferences (example: I was not a fan of the house pickles, which are a crowd favorite), and was, subsequently, underwhelmed with the results. \\n\\nCut to my second dining experience: a friend of mine and I were in the area for a local show, which was conveniently located right down the street from the restaurant. Being so close, I suggested we walk over and stop in. While this place can get hopping, with quite the substantial wait, we made it in just before the dinner rush and were seated immediately. As for the restaurant itself, it has a fun (dare I say, hipster) vibe to it. Being so small, it can feel somewhat claustrophobic (especially along the back wall of 2-seaters), but certainly not to the point of straight-out discomfort. While they have a small bar area, it is (plain and simple) a small place... at busier times, I would expect that most people are forced to wait outside.\\n\\nEach of us ordered a cocktail: I the Elderflower Margarita, and my friend a lemony gin drink. No complaints: these beverages were yummy, and not outrageously priced for the area (although, after more than a couple, this would certainly add up; they do have more reasonably priced options, including $3.50 Gansetts on tap, and an assortment of bottled craft beers at various price points). We decided--in lieu of actual meals--to order a bevy of smaller dishes and sides. Starting with the ricotta and mozzarella fritters, with the chile-honey dipping sauce, this was--hands down--my favorite and absolutely delicious. All of the flavors and textures worked perfectly together, and this will--with no hesitation--be ordered again, upon my next visit. We also ordered the deviled eggs, guac and chips, roasted beet salad, and 2 bowls of the vegetarian soup (sun chokes and leeks was the daily offering). The deviled eggs and guacamole were a bit expected, nothing elevated, but solid snacks and enjoyed by both. The salad and soup were both fantastic; fresh and flavorful, and left us with full bellies. In its entirety, this was one of my favorite meals in recent memory. \\n\\nAll in all, yum. A menu that is unique and not offered elsewhere, where one can experiment a bit and try new things.

Terri and Ryan make delicious comfort food for a fair price. They have only been open since August 2009, but their food shows years of experience in the kitchen. \\n\\nThere are a couple of things that set Che' apart:\\n-Indoor Seating- Che has an agreement with Vignetti's coffee cart and you can eat inside, you know in case its ever raining in Portland.\\n\\n-Dog Friendly- They make dog treats out of dehydrated chicken, My picky dog Riley snaps them up immediately. He's even allowed in the indoor seating. \\n\\n- Location- Che' is located on a biking artery which makes it easy to get to, even without a car. \\n\\nBut the thing that is really amazing about Che' is the food. Huge portions of comfort food made to order with their delicious homemade ketchup. I promise you will be daydreaming about the food for weeks. I had the Pulled Pork sandwich first. The onion bun comes from a local Italian bakery and is the perfect canvas for a PILE of tender, slow-cooked pork topped with crispy or carmelized onions with fries on the side. Today I had the Meatloaf Sandwich, it was big enough for two people, but I finished the whole thing and promptly fell into a food coma. The meatloaf was topped with mayo, tomato, and lettuce held between two pieces of grilled como bread.\\n\\nChe' is also veggie-friendly with a black bean burger that is one of the best veggie patties I've ever had. Its dense with the perfect spice that will fill up even the most jaded carnivore. \\n\\nhttp://foodcartsportland.com/2009/11/03/che-cafe/"},{"name":"SanSai Japanese Grill","address":"539 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I do not understand what all the hoopla over Mio Sushi is about, yeeeeeuck! I'm not saying I've got some fabu sushi palate or anything, but I know when to learn my lesson over some real, real bad nigiri. And who can't make a caterpillar roll taste good, honestly? It's cooked for god's sake. Do I mean  \\\\sk\\\\ or  \\\\s√§-k\\\\? Mmm sake...\\n\\nANYWHO. For cheap sushi, which unfortunately is all I can afford unless the 'rents are in town and feeling generous, I turn to San Sai. Personally, I don't understand the concept of an all day happy hour. If it's always the same low price...doesn't that just make it THE price? Not that I'm complaining, I'm just a bit baffled by the logic. But I digress.\\n\\nI always have to start with the miso soup. The tofu in it has kind a weird texture, but overall it's scrumptious and literally warms me up for my meal. I love the aforementioned caterpillar roll. It's one of few things that satisfies that craving in me to eat something bad for me, when I actually didn't (for once). The cucumber seaweed salad is also an A+. All of the basic appetizers are just the right quality for the price--the tempura veggies being a particular standout option. Even the nigiri here is fresh, firm, and not at all slimy (which was my unfortunate experience at Mio).\\n\\nThe service, though...well, sometimes the service is spotty. Once they read my mind and gave me extra pickled ginger without me having to ask, other times they've forgotten to give me my miso until I reminded them. Forgivable? Yes--the food totally trumps the service in this case.

The other patrons there at the time were also curious neighbors who stopped in to see what the fuss was about.   \\n\\nThe clientele has changed slightly- it seems like there's the younger, trust fund set there for lunch, and the older singles crowd there for dinner/drinks.   \\n\\nOverall:  Not a bad place to go with other people for a drink and a snark, but I wouldn't go for an amazing eating experience."},{"name":"Top It Your Way Yogurt Bar","address":"85 Andover St, Ste 1C","city":"Danvers","stars":"4","text":"Clean fro yo place in the same plaza as Prime and a bridal store.  There is a myriad of toppings to choose from, as well as yogurt flavors.  They do the sampling of the fro-yos a little differently from other places - you have to tell someone what you'd like to try and they'll get it for you.  Plus you are limited to two.  At most fro-yo places I just get the plain one and load it up with toppings.  My husband likes the cookies and creams one and thought a few were on the too sweet side for him.  Wish they had more fruit toppings(I am particularly fond of blueberries) but I did enjoy that there was pomegranate.  Overall the topping selection is pretty diverse and you have a lot to choose from.  I especially liked that there was moochi - which not all fro-yo places have.  They also had a warm apple pie topping, which I thought was different.

Tasty!\\n\\nFor my meal, I wasn't adventurous but got the Firinda Sebzeli Guvec which is your basic white rice and roasted veggies with a light type of tomato based sauce.  Very good.  My fianc√© got a lamb and white bean stew, which he proclaimed, \\"Delicious.\\"  I wish the portions were a little bigger but that is only because I am an American and I know we eat more than necessary, but I still wish my plate was a bit more full.  It was a filling meal and the service was great.  Our waitress, Aksana was sweet and helpful and we had another waitress who helped us choose a dessert.  They even had one of my favorite wines, Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc, though I wish it was a bit colder, kinda had a room temp feel.  Finally, for dessert we wentwith a baklava type dessert but it was made with shredded phyllo dough, pistachios and honey.\\n\\nI would give one more star if my wine was colder and my portion was a bit bigger.  I know that sounds picky but that is what really stuck out.

Portland brunch has turned into a full contact bloodsport, if you don't take it upon yourself to go at a less busy time, just know what you're in for... literally ALL the breakfast joints I've gone to have sketchy service during rush, it's positive attitudes that make the difference for me with servers and hosts, because when you're getting run over you're getting run and you can't do much about it but smile and try to make guests feel good. It is insane how much Portland is obsessed with brunch.

The service was good. However, the food was AWFUL. We were a party of three and ordered Bruschetta and Calamari as appetizers. Then ordered Lobster Ravioli, Chicken Cannelloni and Veal Marsala as our main courses. First of all, the Bruschetta was served with very little tomato, goat cheese and a bunch of lettuce on top drenched with balsamic vinaigrette... Anyone that knows quality Italian food would knows that is NOT Bruschetta. Personally, I don't even eat regular salad with dressing. Therefore, I was annoyed that the appetizer was covered in the vinaigrette. Moving on to the calamari - they were flavorless and served with a green blob that tasted horrible. The main courses: Veal Marsala - the meat was tough,  chewy, the sauce it was served with tasted like a poor attempt at Salisbury sauce. Perhaps, what I would imagine old meat and canned sauce would taste like (not Marsala at all). The Chicken Cannelloni - it looked like enchiladas instead of Cannelloni, the tomato sauce tasted like enchilada sauce, the stuffing was cold, and the chicken inside was pur√©ed (which is gross). The Lobster Ravioli - five pieces of ravioli swimming in a sweet cream sauce. The person in our party that had that dish ate one ravioli, we all shared (just to taste) another piece and left three on the plate. We really should have paid the check and left after the appetizers, but we had good faith that perhaps the main courses would be better that the appetizers. They were not.\\nWe had Valpolicella wine and prosecco to drink (those were good).\\nWe finally paid the check - $125 + $20 tip (we could not bring ourselves to tip better because the food was of such poor quality and taste) - and went to another Italian restaurant to eat so that our evening was not entirely ruined."},{"name":"Church's Chicken","address":"4267 Lougheed Highway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"The chicken was MUI CALIENTE (VERY HOT), physically.

This has a nicer layout, with the indoor/outdoor bar and open table seating along with some booths along the wall.\\n \\nCan't rate the food or drinks, but the menu looks extensive. My wife and I were led to a table by the cheery hostess and she gave us each a menu to read. Nice menus. \\n\\nAt that point we became invisible. We weren't the only ones, so I don't feel bad. A few tables over, another couple was sitting, each with a glass of water. They didn't look happy. I think she was carefully urging him to be cool and not make a scene, but after a few minutes they stood up and left. I guess neither of us had made our reservations correctly.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a group of four people was led to a booth beside us. Somehow, they were seen by their waitress, who came over and greeted them and took drink and appetizer orders. After a few more minutes, a man who carried the appearance of a manager came towards us. Aha! Maybe the boss will take care of us. What luck!\\n\\nSadly, that was not the case as again, we were invisible. He walked past us and asked the quad in the nearby booth if they'd been waited on and if everything was alright. They said \\"Sure, nifty-keen\\" and other nice things. Before we could get his attention, he was off to the bar to check on the football crowd. \\n\\nBy now, my wife is carefully urging me to be cool and not make a scene, like the earlier couple. All this time, I could see plenty of waitresses moving around and surprisingly, one was sitting at the table beside us with a group of guys, one or all of whom may have been her boyfriend(s). Making eye contact was impossible, though, since we were invisible. \\n\\nTime moved on and the group at the nearby booth got their drink orders (good for them!) and shortly after their appetizers (OK, again - good for them). No waitress had yet been able to pierce our cloak of invisibility, so I finally drew a line in the sands of time and told my wife, \\"One more minute and we're done.\\"\\n\\nThe minute passed without fanfare and we stood to go. I collected the two very nice menus and we headed for the entrance. Strangely enough, as we neared the hostess station, we became visible again! The hostess asked if everything was alright as if we had just finished our meal. I could hear my wife yelling at me through that amazing mind-talk wives sometimes use, saying \\"Be cool and don't make a scene\\", so I handed the menus to the hostess and politely said \\"We'll come back sometime when you're not so busy.\\"\\n\\nYou know what, though?

If you are new to Vietnamese food you won't know the difference.  However, if you are a Pho lover you will be VERY disappointed.  This is not authentic Pho.  I have gone twice because it is only about 15 minutes from our home.  I hoped the first time was simply a bad night but sadly I was wrong.  The flavor is so bland and they don't even offer one of the most traditional & nourishing items for the Beef Pho (tendon).  The rare beef on both occasions was actually well done & difficult to chew.  The second time we went we told the waiter and he took the \\"over done rare beef\\" we picked out of our soups and brought us some fresh \\"closer to rare\\" beef that was somewhat chewable but nothing like you would usually get at an authentic Pho restaurant. The broth for both the Beef and the Chicken Pho were HUGE letdowns.  Simply did not give you that nourishing feel you have when dining at a more authentic vietnamese restaurant.  I so hope they can improve this because it would be so nice to have a place to go for Pho that is close by.  Additionally, the service was absolutely horrible.  I mean beyond terrible.  Actually, our waiter was going back and forth to the bar and our table but moving very slowly and with an \\"I don't care attitude.\\"  The restaurant was not busy and the waitress the first time knew less than I know about Vietnamese food, and the \\"bar tender/waiter\\" the second time didn't even know what tendon is?????  This is simply not a authentic place to go for Pho.  The chef needs lessons on how to prepare a good broth.  \\n\\nI am so sorry I had to write this unsettling review but it has taken me months and every time I drive by it bothers me.  Additionally, over the weekend we went to a Pho restaurant in Waltham that was just fabulous...it reminded me to save others a trip & a let down if they are headed to Green Papaya.  Again, if you don't know authentic Pho, this will probably be fine, but if you have previous experiences you will be very let down.  If you are looking for authentic I can confirm there is a good location in Lynn, Dorchester, Waltham, and an ok place on rte one in Peabody.

Pretty much a what do you want attitude.\\nWe selected 2 Bagel Melts; Chicken Mozzarella and Turkey & Cheddar.

No.  She could have motioned over to the case where you can see all the different kinds.  We selected Onion and Spinach Florentine.  We had no idea that there was an up-charge of $.70 for the 'gourmet' bagel until we got our receipt at the end.  I didn't see that anywhere on the menu nor did the server offer up that information.  (So now that Turkey bagel cost $7.65!)  \\n\\nThe server yelled over to another server asking if the bagel melts come with a side.  The answer she was given was no.  Clearly no one who works there knows the menu or can read it.  As we walked over to the other side of the counter to pay for our order, we could see on the menu (in small print) that our orders DO come with a side.  We told the cashier, who happened to be the person that our server originally asked.  After reviewing the menu he agreed.  He indicated that they are constantly changing the menu so it is hard for them to know.  We were told that the chips could be found over at the beginning of the counter.  Why they have them at the beginning and not at the end is beyond me.\\n\\nMy chicken mozzarella was served open face.  It was simply a plain (so plain) piece of chicken cut in half, with half placed on each side of the bagel with mozzarella melted on top of each piece.  So boring, so bland and so expensive I definitely would not order it again!

It makes for a cozy atmosphere. Also note - we went for dinner.\\n\\nNoise: It's a loud space so if you have a large group, hearing may be an issue. Just two people is fine. \\n\\nFood: Excellent. I'm gluten free (my food can touch wheat and I'm not in horrid shape later) and I found a lot of items on the menu I could enjoy. The food was well prepared, hot and well balanced. The \\"arrive as it's completed\\" style is a little odd but very good if you eat too fast. It keeps you pecking at the food so don't order as much as you think you want. Some plates are much more filling than you might imagine. \\n\\nService: Also very good. We sat at the bar facing the window over the street and we were well attended to. \\n\\nNotes: Not family friendly. If you bring the kids on a Sunday morning, know that many will give you the stink eye. They don't seem very well equipped to kids and if they are there, they had better sit still. Narrow walkways make for dangerous liaisons with underfoot children. If you are strictly celiac - don't come here. You'll find cross-contamination to be an issue. There are a lot of options for vegetarians. \\n\\nIs there a super-hipster \\"too cool for the room\\" client vibe? A little, but who cares? The food is amazing and the staff doesn't act that way.

It wasn't until an acquaintance out of town visiting who did her own meeting place research did the opportunity to visit Little Trouble present itself.  All I knew was that \\"it's near Taqueria (del Sol).\\"\\n\\nAnyway, park in the WPD garage instead of the Taqueria outdoor lot, if you're the type that must park as close to the business as possible, otherwise, you'll have to endure walking across the bridge and inevitably 12 people taking selfies for social media as the sun is setting.  Little Trouble is discreetly tucked on the ground level of WPD next to the furniture store of furniture you probably can't afford and underneath the stationery store with stationery you can't afford (are they still even in business?).  Once they're open, the gigantic neon red sign is impossible to mistake with YEAH(!) Burger, or JCT.\\n\\nArriving at Little Trouble, it's easy to see where the Blade Runner influence comes from.  At first blush, it really does kind of feel like you've found the little urban ramen stand at the end of the alleyway.  But instead of a dead end where the protagonist (you) gets assaulted by gang-members throwing glass bottles at you like in Rumble in the Bronx, it's instead a fork in the road where one side takes you to a surprisingly relaxed bar, and the other side takes you into a spacious dining area, both of which are appropriately lit for atmosphere and mood of a kind of underground hiding place.\\n\\nDespite being a Saturday evening, Little Trouble had little trouble (NO PUN INTENDED) in accommodating a group of eight which grew to like 9-10 people due to the the people on Facebook who don't respond to an invitation, or the Maybes that actually do show up.  The staff was polite and cooperative, and made no mistakes, which is pretty much half the battle as far as my mental criteria goes.\\n\\nThe menu is not large, but it features a decent variety of Asian-inspired items, as well as implores you to not impale your hands with chopsticks (seriously).  I'm not much of a cocktail/well drinker, preferring to stick to my swine water (beer), and I will say Little Trouble has a fairly eclectic variety in that regard, but most importantly not seeing Bud/Miller/Coors listed at all was pleasing to my inner-hipster.\\n\\nI think the food prices are a sliver of a hair on the high end of the spectrum, as a single meat-filled bun runs $5 a pop.  Drizzling a little bit of honey on pork rinds tasty, but not $6 tasty.  The ramen is a little high as well, at like $14, and the portion size is not as favorable as you would find at any other popular Atlanta ramen eatery.\\n\\nHonestly though, I don't think anyone comes to WPD because they're looking for economical eating options, they're coming to WPD because it's a trendy dining district with a combination of decent food, drink, atmosphere, drink, convenience and drink.  Between Little Trouble, JCT, Yeah Burger and West Egg, dropping $30-40 for two is kind of the norm.  Frankly, I think Little Trouble's food menu is almost entirely, more economically available at Raku about a mile away.\\n\\nBut if you're going to Little Trouble solely to eat, I think you'd kind of be missing the point.  Overall, Little Trouble is a pretty unique atmosphere, that's pretty centrally located that most Atlantans know how to get to WPD, parking is free, and a pretty good staff.  Prices are a tad high, but it's still a great place to get some food, soak in some spirits, and enjoy the scene."},{"name":"El Camino's","address":"3250 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Great flavours, fantastic service and perfect margaritas.\\n\\nGot there at 6.30pm on a Monday and had to wait five minutes but once seated we were attended to promptly.

We had 2 boards, a few drinks, and ended up spending +$50?  Waitron didn't know what the hell she was talking about, ever, and didn't help us navigate the menu or beer options, since you couldn't see the board from anywhere, and almost nothing on the printed list was available.  (by contrast, Bangers, Chicago House, Gingerman, and Draught House have very knowledgable staff) They did have a good selection of beers, but the process of getting one I wanted was a pain in the ass: I selected one from the board, and they were out, so I picked one from the printed menu; no they didn't have that, so I picked another, nope, out; so I picked another they were out of, and she asked if I wanted something in a half-pint.  Huh?  Wth kind of question is that?  Who picks a beer according to the size of the glass it's going to come in (especially since only 2 of the 4 I originally selected were listed as half-pints)?  This was mirrored at another point when I asked for pickles because I had ordered the New York board, and she asked \\"What KIND of pickles?\\"  I dunno, maybe it was valid and I was just tweaked from before, but it seemed absurd: first off, a plate of corned beef, pastrami, pretzels and mustard should ALREADY have pickles (who is the executive chef here??), and secondly, if you have so many kinds of pickles to choose from, why don't you tell me what they are and I can pick, so we don't go through the same \\"no don't have that\\" exercise we did with the beer list.  On top of that... hipsters playing blues music... that shit needs to never happen again anywhere in the universe.  How about we just all agree that Austin never needs to hear blues again?  So yeah, this place needs to work on their food, service and vibe.  That said, the pastrami was utterly ridiculously good - almost bacon-like.

Their noodles came in a single piece requiring you to manually separate them with your chopsticks; and once separated, they broke up into smaller chunks. They're also relatively stingy with their meat allotment, in fact, they even skimped on the bean sprouts. The beef slices were rough, meatballs rubber-ish.

After reading some of the reviews on Yelp I was a bit hesitant to go, but went anyway. It wasn't bad.\\n\\nWe went around 14:30 on a Saturday, which seems like the perfect time to go: Hardly anyone else there. We were greeted and seated promptly (crisis #1 averted) and a waitress dropped off water right away (crisis #2 averted). I was a bit disappointed that they didn't bring the chips and salsa until after we ordered, but it wasn't a big deal.\\n\\nI ordered a Chicken Chimichanga and a Frozen Mango Margarita and my friend ordered a Combination #2 (Floutas and Tortilla Soup).\\n\\nThe drink arrived after a couple minutes (just after the waitress dropped off chips). Unfortunately, the Margarita was terrible, tasting like shoe polish. I'm guessing they used extremely cheap tequila (Sauza Gold or Aristocrat ?). In hindsight, I probably should have said something.\\n\\nThe chips were surprisingly good: Quite thick and a bit of flavour on their own. The two dips brought with them were a bit strange. The green one looked like pesto sauce but I didn't recognise the taste; the red one tasted a bit like salsa. Both were smooth/creamy (not what I expected). I didn't care for the green, but the red was good.\\n\\nThe Chimichanga was a mixed bag: I was pleasantly surprised that the re-fried beans are vegetarian, and quite tasty especially when mixed with the rice. There was some strange sauerkraut-like side that was also good. Alas the Chimichanga itself was not great (but not awful). The chicken was not fatty but was still rather low-quality and I encountered several bones.\\n\\nTo finish up, I got a slice of Tres Leches cake. Now this was the highlight of the meal! Perfect mix of creamy/soggy and cakiness. Also it had very firm bits of peaches which were delicious."},{"name":"China Hut","address":"16721 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"Fucking worst place ever.

It was served very nicely on a wooden cutting board (?) making it  perfect for taking photos.

The scallion pancakes where crispy and hot perfection. We found the tofu skinwrapped dim sum okay but not terribly flavorful.  The sticky rice was very flavorful, well cooked, with lots of items imbedded in the sticky rice. Savory and sweet. Really good.

The staff was very friendly and helped us through the menu.  Our waiter really understood every bit of it and we probably spent more time discussing beers than was reasonable.  I settled on the Texas Hill Country Plate and a local sour beer from Blue Owl.  The Texas Hill Country Plate was more than enough for 2 people.

It was really quite delicious - flavorful and not too much or too little.\\nI had a swordfish special - w parmesan mashed potatoes and butternut squash all in a sweet sauce. It was really tasty. The swordfish was meaty but quite mild. I would've like a bit more spices/pepper/something to flavor it. But that's more me I think - I really like an indecent amount of pepper on stuff.

They don't take reservations: they that take your phone number, and *call* when a table is ready for you.

It's a Friday, you're an awesome place, that even Guy Fieri's been to, no problem. So we get on the T at 6:30p starting from Davis, and arrive at Wood Island at like 7:15p, trying to give a little time for them to call us before hand. I walk in, and ask \\"Hey, I've got my name down for a 7:30ish reservation?\\" \\"Oh, yeah, we tried calling you at 7p, letting you know your table is ready.

I had a bad waiting experience, but one more time, the food was totally worth the hassle.\\n\\nI recommend this place whole-heartedly, but it might be a good idea to already be on that side of town for a while when you call in for a table, that way you'll have cell reception when they call you.\\n\\nP.S.

Horrible decision.  As we were walking to our table one of the waitresses squeezed in between us and the customers already dining, making me move to the side with my six month old daughter in my arms. Not even a little \\"excuse me\\" came from her mouth. We were seated in a VERY noisy area, the kids were given coloring pages that doubled as the menu with NO crayons. Our waiter (a squirrely looking man with glasses and a silver hoop in his ear) came to the table and was immediately overwhelmed with the situation. He took our drink order and repeatedly asked how to split the checks. We ordered drinks,a couple of appetizers, and a bowl of soup. The drinks, chile con queso, quacamole, and soup were delivered to the table with no chips, no plates, and an added bonus? Hair in the soup..YUMM. After repeatedly asking for plates we all just decided to dig in.. once we had the chips, of course. About 30 minutes into the whole ordeal we had not ordered any entrees and were pretty much being ignored. Our waiter must have told the manager about the hair in the soup situation, so the manger came over to the table to talk with us. He apologizes and assures us he will make sure our meals are on there way to the table-ASAP. Only thing is..we didn't order any meals yet. BOTH families were fed up and just ready to leave. We received the checks which were completely wrong... Just as the manager realizes that we haven't even ordered yet.Then he did the ONLY decent thing that happened in that restaurant, told us to go ahead and go, he would take care of the bill for our drinks and appetizers. We thanked him and left promptly and went to Orlando Ale House.Good decision.\\n\\nAnother point I would like to add is that we were told numerous times by a few different people that they were making new chips and that's why it took sooo long for them to get to our table.

Chai samples were handed out to everyone.\\n\\nI hate the idea of \\"buffet\\" for my birthday but the food was great.  Everything was fresh, hot and full of flavour.  There was a salad/fresh fruit section which was great as well.  For $25 per person, it was a lot cheaper than most places for a party this large and I enjoyed being able to move around easily and catch up with everyone since it was a casual environment.  \\n\\nAll in all, I had a great time here for my birthday and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a spot for a large group."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Where to start?

Even if the food sucked, we would go back for the service. The decor is gorgeous, subtle lighting, tiny colorful christmas lights all around, specials on a blackboard to the side, right amount of darkness, tables not too close together, and the best chandeliers you will ever see in your life. But the food, OH, the food.... we started with calamari, which were good, but their shrimp and grits is to die for!!!! So tasty and well seasoned, shrimp cooked well. Then we had chili fries, fries look homemade and chili is so good we each ordered 2 more cups - spicy, fresh, creamy. He had the burger with cheddar, which he liked, but we both fell in love with my scallops and mushrooms and ham bits. Never have I tasted such perfectly cooked scallops, and the chanterelles complemented the ham which danced with the crispy ham bits which melted in my mouth. Will go back very soon.

We have genuinely never had a bad meal here and the service has been friendly and attentive. We normally order a combo meal that has the oriental salad, teriyaki chicken and a tempura mix. Lately, we've included a shrimp skewer. It is very reasonably priced with so much food that we normally have to take some home. For a little extra, you can have brown rice instead of white rice. It is surprising how well the salad complements the other foods.\\n\\nThe teriyaki chicken is remarkably consistent - the meat is juicy, well seasoned but not too salty with a hint of smokiness  that is hard to achieve. The tempura has never disappointed but we would recommend that you eat that in the restaurant because it will lose its crunch if you take it to go. It's still quite good but not quite the same as when freshly brought to your table.\\n\\nWe have tried their sushi and it was fine but it is  probably middle of the road in terms of quality for high-end sushi lovers. Still, for our tastes and certainly for the price, it is enjoyable and we have never had any of the issues noted in other reviews. Their salmon collar is also very good and worth a try if it is available.\\n\\nThe service has been consistent on the many occasions we have dined here. In one instance, one of our party noted in passing to the waiter that her salmon was dry and the chef came to our table and immediately offered to replace the dish. It was not necessary but we were impressed nonetheless with the expressed concern.

Two minutes back to hotel and it was still hot, albeit presentation in styrofoam was not particularly appetizing, that's my fault.  Noodles were par, but the sauce was very taste, sweet and penuty.

Highly recommend it. \\n\\nThe beet salad was delicious too...with sweet walnuts and solid bites of the purple-ish vegetable. \\n\\nI can't say enough good things about this place; its intimate with a great social  atmosphere, great beer selection (for those who care), immediate service, and delectable food!"},{"name":"Ichi Teriyaki 27","address":"585 W 8th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I had the teriyaki chicken with fried rice. I've walked by this place numerous times going from where we always park and the farmers market and I've been wanting to try them ever since I noticed the picture of their fried rice in the window. \\n\\nI grew up in Okinawa and we had a maid that made the best fried rice in the world. Haven't had anything close until today. Eggs, carrots, peas, beans......lots of goodies giving it great flavor. Really enjoyed it. \\n\\nDropped one star because, although very good, I thought the teriyaki chicken was a little salty and the lady server went into the bathroom long enough to wash her hands or use the toilet - not both."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Welcome to Tasty n Sons, a staple restaurant styled in the traditional Portlandia hipster fashion. Even on a Wednesday morning, the place was packed and we had to wait for thirty minutes. Luckily, the waitress took our cell number so we were able to explore the nearby stores instead of waiting in the restaurant. When we finally did sit down, I was starving. I had already practically memorized the menu (after browsing through photos online) and ultimately decided to order the shakshuka (tomato and red pepper stew with two eggs on top). My sister ordered the polenta and sausage ragu with my encouragement and my mom had the chicken, egg, and cheese biscuit (she's not a fan of \\"strange\\" spices, in her words). I also couldn't resist trying a chocolate potato doughnut and a cup of coffee. Served family style, the waitress brought each dish out as soon as it was ready and placed it in the middle to be shared with everyone. \\n\\nThe coffee arrived first - with its own little bottle of cream and container of sugar. Having been deprived of good coffee for a while now, I really enjoyed this perfectly brewed cup. Add that to the constant refills and I was definitely on the road to caffeine high. \\n\\nThe doughnut was probably my least favorite dish. At 1.5 a piece, the little donut hole we were given was underwhelming. While the potato flavor was definitely unique, it's not a taste I crave. Also, the creme anglaise didn't really complement the doughnut either.\\n\\nMy sister's polenta, on the other hand, was much better. Though soupier than I expected, the flavors were well done. A bit on the greasier side though - healthy eaters be warned. The oil probably came from the sausage. However, still tasted good to me.\\n\\nMy mom's biscuit took a while to arrive. The chicken was a bit overfried - unfortunately - but the rest of the entree was good. The biscuit was one of the best I've tasted: flaky, buttery, and delicious.\\n\\nFinally, my shakshuka came last, served with an extra two slices of AMAZINGLY fresh white bread. (Definitely stood out to me.) The spices were well combined and the stew tasted great with the bread, both grilled and regular. Again, a bit on the oily side but delicious. If you like tomatoes, peppers, and onions, this dish is great.\\n\\nOverall, a positive brunch experience. I'd love to go back and try a few other things on the menu as well. Those who are visiting Portland in search of local, hipster-ness, this is definitely a great restaurant choice!"},{"name":"Izzy and Mo's","address":"249 King Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Best Ruben I've EVER had.

Though it may be my fault partially as I read the articles about ecoli at this location but assumed it was just a fluke. Given the high volume of stuff that comes out of the kitchen I guess food poisoning is to be expected sometimes, but I don't think I'll be returning to this as food safety seems to have taken a back seat to speed of food delivery."},{"name":"Pho Broadway","address":"835 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"What?! \\n\\nThere's a new Pho place on NE Broadway?! \\n\\nYES!\\n\\nPho Broadway took over a dilapidated Chinese food restaurant really recently and in celebration of their Grand Opening, they're offering $5 Pho for the entire month of November (watch this review get dated so fast). \\n\\nYes, Virginia, they do have vegan pho. And it's good. The broth is a little bland, but part of the beauty of pho is the ability to customize your own bowl.\\nI enjoyed the vegetable selection--button mushrooms, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, cabbage and onions. The tofu was not served fried, which is definitely healthier, usually blander, but in this case it wasn't so bad. I ate it and liked it. \\n\\nI know I'll love a pho place when there's fresh jalepenos on the side. Pho Broadway delivered. With the ability to choose between a small and a large (both $5 for November), the small is still so big I had leftovers. \\n\\nThe service was not spectacular, but I'm fully acquainted with less-than-stellar-service at Portland pho places and barely bat an eyelash at the lack of smiles anymore.\\n\\nThis place passes the test of being within radius of close-to-my-home and offering extremely decent Pho at a reasonable price. I have a feeling it will become my go-to Pho place. \\n\\nBasically, I just wanted to see how many times I could say 'Pho' in this review. 11."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},O={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],F={key:0},R={key:1};function D(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",O,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",F,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const G=u(H,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-9cbe758e"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/40.md","filePath":"library/40.md"}'),q={name:"library/40.md"},Y=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(G)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
