Went inside and were greated right away. So we asked how long is the wait since it looks like a few parties were already ahead of us. We were told \\"a few/couple minutes.\\" Because i requested the fast table they had available (we didnt care where due to hunger).

Very informative but might forget about me from time to time. We ordered the lobster corn dog, blue crab ceviche, lobster guacamole, and 4 oysters total. Now let me break down the food quality for you.\\nThe lobster corn dog skewers were FANTASTIC. Good amount of meat and banging sauce. Some spicy mayo aioli type but better. The crab ceviche was great and worth a try. Not to bad of pricing for these items so far. The chips came with this ceviche was 60% stale. You can taste it. Either its been left out or just not a new batch. The oysters were pretty good and fresh. The lobster guac was quite a show. They brought a table and ingredients everything. I was just a bit upset because about 3-4oz worth of lobster in it. They used about 2 and a half of avocado which is a lot for such little pieces of meat. Thats not enough. The blue crab felt even meatier more of a meat ratio compared to the guac. Once again the chips came with this one was stale but not as bad. I cant believe i paid $36 for some good quality food. Money is not an issue but i felt like i paid more for the lobster guac show itself then the quality and quantity of the dish itself. ... my reccomendation for this place is the view/atmosphere/vibe on the 2nd floor during sunset time.

Not until around 9:20am, she let us sit at two small tables that were put together make a size equivalent to a four-person table. The two small tables were empty and ready the moment we walked in, so why did we wait for half an hour?? The small tables were directly facing the entrance of the restaurant, so every time when the door opened, the icy wind blew in and it was very cold. My husband saw some four-person tables were still empty and ready inside the bigger room so asked her if we could move before the food arrived, but she turned us down again saying the tables were for others.

With a restaurant name like that and a tag line with those items, it conjures up memories for me. Therefore it has a lot to compete with but overall a okay.\\n\\nThe two dishes I tried was the congee with seafood and Pork chop with tomato sauce. The congee is basically rice porridge with seafood that consist of shrimp and scallop at 9.95. The porridge was too thick and just a tad salty. Its supposed to be silky ish. At 9.95 I expected it come with a fried dough or at least a few pieces of it on top for garnish.  It is the size of a normal cereal bowl. \\n\\nThen the Pork chop with Tomato sauce was a lot better. The pork chop was seasoned well and was place on top of a bed of tomato sauce with a side of white rice. This was at 7.95. The tomato sauce the pork chop lays on it a quick tomato sauce that has a slight sweetness to it.  I seriously feel that this plate could have easily been price at 9.95 and have the congee at 7.95. \\n\\nThe owner mentions all the dumplings are fresh made in house and the milk tea are suppose to be the same tea leaves from Hong Kong cause it original from there to make the tea and you really can't substitute it with Lipton black tea. \\n\\nIt took about 30-35 minutes from since I sat down at 1215 to leaving around 12:50.

Because I was really looking forward to this dining experience and I have heard such good things about this place and my original experience (almost a year ago). As a large group coming in at 8:45, I would also hope that we would get the attention that we deserved. Sadly, I cannot be the bearer of good news on this review.\\n\\nWe had a large group.... For 8:45... and when we got there, the table was not ready and I felt bad intruding on the people who were sitting at the edge of the bar by the front door. With no where to stand but the front area, the staff who were walking past the bar to the front was pushy, and rude.... I'm not sure if I'm at fault by this but I felt bad for being in their way.\\n\\nAbout 10 - 15 minutes later, we were finally brought upstairs to our area -  two different groupings because one table could not seat us all. The service was extremely slow throughout the whole evening, and I was surprised to see that there was one person serving all of us. The whie sangria I ordered tasted like pure sweet white grape juice and nothing else.. I'm not sure if that's the way it's supposed to be made.\\n\\nWhat was most disappointing that for $45, our meal consisting of the appetizer platter and a main course was poorly proportioned. One table consisting of 10 people had two platters to share, and one table of 15 people ALSO had two platters to share. How is a table with 5 extra people sharing the same amount of food? There were approximately 4 pieces of each item on the platter so not everyone had a chance to try everything (I'm not sure how it works). Thanks to our hosts, they ordered extra burata for all of us, and I was very happy with the taste of the cheese and bread that it came with, but if that wasn't ordered, I'm sure that the rest of the guests would be pretty hungry considering that it was after 9:30 when the first course even came out. I would have suggested that the first course been put into the kitchen earlier because it only main courses had an option anyway.\\n\\nFor the mains - our option was Spaghetti and Kobe Meatballs, Wild Salmon with celery puree, and Chicken with Proscuitto and Panzella Salad. I have had the Kobe meatballs before and loved them so wanted to try something new to get a taste of what else they had to offer...... bad idea. When ordering the salmon, I requested my salmon be a little underdone and the waitress assured me that the kitchen knew what they were doing and they usually cook it that way anyway... well... not sure what happened but my salmon was TOUGH and dry and overcooked... well not just my salmon... I talked to everyone around me who ordered the salmon and they all got the same quality. Everything else was very pleasant but I did not order a plate to be eating veggies and puree.\\n\\nI hate to be tough on this one but I can only save glowbal group restaurants for special occasions because I would consider it a higher end restaurant and a higher price point so I woul also expect the same quality and service.

The fruits are not ripened so they are crisp, subtly sweet but has the sauce and fried onions to balance the flavor. Spring Rolls are not traditional and even better; there's no vermicelli noodles but lots of fresh herbs and veggies. All the proteins are seasoned well, vinaigrette completes it perfectly.\\n\\nEntree - Vermicelli Bowls, Com Fragrant Rice, and Flat Rice Vermicelli. \\nI would not stray from these three if you've never been here before. The star is the meat that is served on these; marinated with so much flavor and grilled perfectly. I usually prefer the sliced beef or sliced pork as they take the marinade the best I think. Vermicelli bowls have lots of fresh veggies and herbs. \\"Special\\" rice plate has a lot of different components but that egg on top just adds richness and ties it all in. I only order the flat noodles if I feel like DIY spring rolls; you gotta tell the server to add rice paper. \\n\\nOverall their speciality IMO is the marinade/spices they use in their meats, it is so so good and flavorful.

I loved their d√©cor and the open kitchen. The crudo were fresh, but the crostinis and pastas stole the show. Each crostini I tried was an interesting mix of flavors and textures that blended together deliciously. The pastas were bold and cooked perfectly al dente. Best dishes: the eggplant and speck crostinis, the asparagus casoncelli. \\n\\nGeneral:\\nWe had a late reservation for 9PM on a Friday night but the restaurant had many open tables at this time. The restaurant has a more modern d√©cor. I'm always a fan of open kitchens that face the tables. Service here was good but one of my few complaints is that the pacing of the dishes for the family tasting menu was slow. Dishes within each course arrived quickly but there were was a significant lag between each course.\\n\\nFood:\\nThe tasting menu ($52) included three crudo, an antipasti, two crostinis, two pastas, a secondi, and two desserts... quite a lot of food even for me. The yellowtail, Japanese sea bream, and sea bass ceviche were very fresh. I appreciated how the cuts of fish were thick but not sinewy at all. The crudo were colorfully decorated with citrus flavors and textured with some crunch. The crostini were absolutely incredible. Eggplant/chili/honey and taleggio/speck/hazelnut stole the show. I loved how the smoky, sweet and tart flavors complemented one another. The asparagus casoncelli was another showstopper. Rich and creamy... yet without being overly so. The orecchiette was very robust but a little too oily for me. The Delmonico steak was cooked medium rare and wonderfully tender... except parts were unchewable sinew/fat and kind of detracted from the great portions of the steak. Unfortunately, dessert was a little of a letdown. The interesting ice cream flavors (like olive oil) could've been great but were too salty or too sweet. Still overall, I'd come back over and over again for their tasting menu.

Each entree is packed with a lot of flavor; I tried Karah's Diavolo and the Great Leopold. I found both entrees to initially taste amazing, but throughout the meal, Karah's Diavolo got too sour for me and it was hard to finish. Overall, though each dish was delicious, there was a bit *too* much going on in the dish for me. Each flavor came through pretty strong which got overpowering at the end. We got a side of the Italian Sausage which was pretty flavorful as well; it wasn't uniquely amazing, but I would be okay with ordering it again.\\n\\nSERVICE: They got our dishes out to us pretty quickly considering how packed it was on the particular Saturday evening we went.

First the restaurant was very beautiful and our server was truly upset at the experience that we encountered. We had taken our family out for a very special evening and were expecting a dining experience on the level of the Dr. Phillips area. Our drinks came with no problem and that was about all that went right. We received our appetizers that were delicious and at this point the experience turned to something that I would expect from a 1 star restaurant. The couple that we were with that recommended Big Fin, received their meals first and then my son and daughter received their meals about 10 minutes later. I had ordered steamed oysters and they were brought a few minutes later raw and cold. I told the waiter of the error and he apologized and returned them back to the kitchen to fix the issue. This took another 15 minutes and during this period, my wife's meal was no where in site. When my meal finally arrived my children had already finished their meals along with our friends. At this point I had to bring to our waiters attention that my wife still had not received her meal. He then quickly went back to the kitchen to see what the problem was while the rest of us were all finished with our meals. The evenings Mod/Owner then approached our table at our waiters request to see what the problem was and we very calmly explained the issues to him. He stated that he would help with the problem and take a look at our check to compensate our chaotic dining experience. During our continued wait for my wife's meal I had ordered a Margarita. When the drink was brought to our table by another waiter, it was the wrong drink. I again brought this to our waiters attention and he shook his head in disbelief as he brought my wife's meal that we had to ask for a to-go box due to the amount of time that we had to sit and wait for everything to be corrected. When my wife's meal was brought to our table in the to-go box, we were astounded to see that the only thing in the box was 4 asparagus a few green beans and a scoop of mashed potatoes when the waiter had said that the chef would make something special for her as she is a vegetarian.Our checks were brought to our table and these too were incorrect. The checks were given back to our waiter and he corrected them and there was no compensation at all by the manager/owner as was stated by him personally. I normally will let small things pass as I have worked in the food industry myself, but I truly felt for our waiter as you could see that even he was disgusted at the things that we had to endure. As for the manager/owner, he was never seen again and I think that this has upset me the most of all. It's nothing to come over and get a pat on the back for a great meal and dining experience, but when you are faced with a legitimate lack of a great dining experience by your doing, a follow up to your initial,\\"I will take care of this for you' would have made things a little better. The only things that were taken off of our bill was the wrong drink and and my wife's vegetables and mashed potatoes. She had ordered the Vegetarian platter and I hope that this is not what the meal truly is. You know things are bad when the server says that it has been a horrible night and that the kitchen has been backed up all night. This is really not what we wanted to hear nor was it approiate to say to a customer. When surrounded by heavy hitter competition very close by, Big Fin had better get back in the game or become just another failed business in a very saturated upscale restaurant market in the Dr. Phillips area and shared in the social media arena."},{"name":"El Guajillo","address":"12725 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"This mole right here is the best mole that has ever touched my lips .

They offered to re-make the prime ribs and seared the top with the insides still bloody, it was cooked in less than 10 min. We asked for the manager and they said Andrew was not working today.

Decent portion size, not too sweet but strawberry fields tasted just like vanilla ice cream. Consistency was not rich and creamy was watery more like a sorbet.

The food was still good, but couldn't make up for our experience.\\n\\nThere were several frustrating things that happened during the meal, and I'll list the few that come to my mind immediately.  We arrived on time with an Opentable reservation and were seated immediately.  Even though it was not busy, it was 15 full minutes until anyone approached our table.  When we received our first course (soup and salad), we still had no utensils nor napkins.  We asked 3 separate staff members over the course of 10-15 minutes to bring them over, all of whom promised they would do so immediately, but never did.  When our meals arrived, only 3 of the 4 were brought to the table and 1 of those was cold.\\n\\nI also was alerted via email after we left that the restaurant cancelled my Opentable reservation.  Although I've yet to get anything in return for my Opentable points, I'd like to think some day I will and should have gotten the points for my visit.\\n\\nI really love the Boston location and am overall disappointed in the service in Lynnfield."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Any place that makes as much from scratch as Magnolia gets three stars by default.

In fact this new sibling of Tasty & Sons is hitting on so many cylinders right now that I can't imagine giving it anything else. \\n\\nFrom the moment we walked in our experience here was top notch. There is a wait (expect that always) but the hostess is in firm control. She's lazer quick to get our name and phone number (they'll call you if you want to go wander around while waiting), fast to get tables turned, and made sure during our 35-40 minute wait to check in with us every once and a while to know that we had not been forgotten. All this with a smile. First impressions are so important, they have a good one here. \\n\\nThe space itself is cozy, packed and lively. There's a bar area (first-come, first-served) and a separate area with tables for sittin'. The menu follows the same form as Tasty 'n Sons - brunch tapas. Such a brilliant idea. I love sharing, and after 30+ minutes waiting (and smelling the incredible food) it's great to have plates start coming out right away. \\n\\nLET IT BE KNOWN - this food is meant for sharing. Don't expect to each order one thing and have all the dishes show up at once. That's never going to happen. If you need that, go elsewhere. \\n\\nThe food? Dare I say even more impressive than Tasty 'n Sons? The potato chocolate donuts are as good as on N Williams. Radicchio salad with egg and lardons is incredible - a must-order. Polenta with pork sugo, mozzarella and egg is creamy, comforting succulence - very similar to the polenta with merguez sausage ragout at 'Sons. The Duck... Duck... Steak! is a menage a trois of confit, piedmontese beef and a duck egg. Fantastic, but honestly, I wouldn't order again simply because I'd prefer to fill up on dishes like the sugo, with lots of interesting sauces and flavors. The duck/steak combo has great meat - no doubt. \\n\\nBut honestly, the dishes here that shine are ones like the Korean Fried Chicken served up over rice with kimchi and egg. I was hesitant to order this with my Korean friend across the table. How good can KFC be at a non-Korean restaurant anyway? Fucking extremely good. In fact, I heard something I rarely hear from my dining comrade - \\"This is better than my mom can make.\\" I've had his mom's food. It's better than any Korean restaurant. And damn if 'Alder hasn't come up with something so crazy delicious as to shame all other KFC I've had. The sauce is a perfect mix of vinegar-y, gochujang-y goodness. Wow. \\n\\nThree main plates and two starters (and a ginger ale) came to $46. Way too much food for two people (enough for 4, probably), and incredibly reasonably priced for what we got. \\n\\nOh, and the rest of our service? Fantastic. Food pacing was excellent. All around experience was tops. \\n\\nSeriously I write a lot of glowing reviews on Yelp, but this is one of the easiest 50-star gusher's I've put down.

It is served with a jalapeno butter which complements the hush puppies nicely. \\n\\nShrimp Scampi - which was delicious as well and the sauce that it is cooked in is to die for. Our waitress was kind enough to bring us a few more slices of grilled bread to dip into the sauce. \\n\\nFarro Risotto - warm, creamy, and fresh. I may have had to go for 2nds or 3rds on this one. \\n\\nAlder Burger - was pleasantly surprised how good this burger was! Nice coarse ground meat packs huge amounts of flavor with each bite. I'd totally come back just for this burger. \\n\\nWagyu Skirt Steak - wow. wow. wow. This steak was so soft and tender, it literally melted in my mouth. Super flavorful too. The Thai basil chimichurri adds a nice flavor as well. \\n\\nFor dessert, we had the cotton cake and the chocolate potato doughnut. Both were a nice end to an amazing meal. Overall my experience at Tasty n Alder lived up to the hype and I could not have had a better last meal in Portland.

Friendly and good service too.  A nice addition to Northwest Hills.\\n\\nUPDATE--we've been back several times and the food has been fantastic each time.  The wait staff is friendly and the owner has stoped in on us a couple times when we were there and is very friendly and wants to do everything he can to make it a great experience.  It may be the times we've gone there (has tended to be later), but it's been non-existent for us.  In any case, at this point I have every reason to make this one of my Mexican (I would say it's fancier than typical Tex-mex) go-tos in the area (along with Azul Tequila for a more Tex-Mex flavor, which I should probably review because it's pretty good too).\\n\\nThis is all in stark contrast to another restaurant not too far away on the edge of Allandale, El Dorado Cafe.  While the food I had the one time I ate there (twice if you count picking up desert once) was good, I don't think the food is worth the waits I have been quoted almost every time we have tried to go there.  The wait times quoted have usually been long (40 minutes plus) and that's deterred us from going there much.  We tried El Dorado again recently but first by calling for the estimated wait time (when we were about 10 minutes away by car) and were told VERY CLEARLY it would be about 15 minutes for our party with no hint that could rapidly change.  But when we got there within the 10 minutes were in person quoted up to about about 3 times longer.  When I had the temerity to point this out and say that was unacceptable they tried to make me feel like I was crazy in reporting what I had unequivocally been told and that somehow I had been mistaken.  That didn't sit well with me (and if you had been on the receiving end of how they handled it, probably would not have sit well with you).  No statement by the staff like we are sorry, a bunch of big parties came in right before or they just goofed.  Rather, they asserted that I must have gotten it wrong.  And then the owner proceeded to harass me for my Yelp review (with a comment attacking me and and then a private harassing message when I defended my account), asserting I was rude and not in any way acknowledging her staff inconvenienced my family and tried to shift their mistake onto me.  \\n\\nI generally only review someplace I have an excellent experience or the polar opposite.  And in these two near each other restaurants (Cielo and El Dorado) I have experienced both.\\n\\nCielo is where it's at for fresh, original Mexican-inspired and delicious food with good service, reasonable prices for the quality of the food, and an owner who knows how to treat people.

Checked out the bar beforehand. The bartender was very sweet and made me a really yummy Judy Garland (Grapefruit/elderflower/basil). Only $10 for specialty cocktails, which was reasonable. However, be warned that there is BARELY any alcohol in them. My friend got this interesting concoction that tasted like dirty soda water. After spending $20 (plus tip) on two drinks, I came to the realization that I basically spent $20 on soda/juice. Felt no buzz, and I am not a heavy drinker so usually two cocktails will get me feeling something. Stick to beer here.\\n\\nAs for the food, it's pretty cheap. Entrees were less than $20. However, I didn't think it was that good. We got the fig/goat cheese baked dip which tasted like cheap jam and wasn't worth $15. The pizza was good though, but I don't have high expectations for pizza. They have interesting varieties. \\n\\nService- our waiter was nice, but he forgot to give us our appetizer! I asked him about it and he said he forgot to put it in, so we ended up getting it AFTER our entree!

After looking through menus and many Yelp reviews, I decided on Little Bird Bistro. I made a reservation through OpenTable table about a week or so prior for Sunday, October 9th at 7:30pm for a party of two.\\n\\n*Charcuterie Board: pig ear terrine - vadouvan curry aioli, radish; pork rillon - remoulade; deviled egg - smoked trout; pork rillettes - dates; salmon tartine - mustard pickled onions; chicken liver mousse - port-glazed shallots ($25)\\n*Roasted Marrow Bones: grilled boule, chorizo, pickled salad ($19)\\n*Seared Foie Gras: parsnips trois fa√ßons, vadouvan curry honey ($25)\\n*Hanger Steak Au Poivre: frites, goat cheese on side ($27)\\n*Oyster Mushrooms: black garlic vinaigrette, hazelnuts ($10)\\n\\nSince this was stop #7 on our eating and drinking tour of Portland, we actually kept the ordering pretty tame. The roomie loves charcuterie, so we had to get the board. I really enjoyed the fried pig skin. It was drizzled with honey which I normally wouldn't like, but somehow, it worked! The bone marrow was good as well. The dish comes with three bones, but they're on the smaller side, so I was able to finish a whole bone by myself. The salad gave it a freshness and the chorizo, a nice savoriness. The seared foie was amazing! Such good, creamy, fatty, foie flavor. I was in heaven. The only thing that would have improved this dish was if it was seared a little longer. It was a touch undercooked. The steak was cooked perfectly. Though I'm glad we asked for the goat cheese on the side cuz I think it would have overpowered the meat. I'd skip the mushrooms next time as they were too sweet for me. I barely ate them. They also gave us tiny Macarons with our check which I thought was a nice touch.\\n\\nHappy I picked Little Bird as our dinner spot.

I haven't been here for 15 years, but it hasn't changed one bit. It's still got an incredibly small parking lot right off of South Congress Avenue and the wait for a table anytime of the day can potentially be 15 minutes or longer. I specifically came late after the lunch crowd, but there was still a wait, so I opted for the bar where you can grab an open seat and be served quickly. Sitting here was just like old times. I once worked at the university across the street and would pop over here for a late afternoon lunch. Even then, I would pop a squat at the bar. \\n\\nI was tempted to get my old standby on the menu (black beans with avocado and pico with a cornmeal pancake), but I went for the Eggs Zapatino instead which is somewhat of a twist on an Eggs Benedict (my other love!). The Eggs Zapatino is scrambled eggs on a toasted muffin smothered in a white queso concoction that probably has some green chiles or jalape√±o bits in it for a slightly spicy kick. Also on the plate are some well-seasoned, bite-sized, new potato chunks. For $2 more, they topped my plate with avocado slices, and they even offered to go heavy or light on the amount (I went for the former or course!). \\n\\nThe portions really are well sized despite me scraping and licking every last drop of gooey goodness of queso off the plate. The price is a good value (about $15 for the meal and a soda). \\n\\nThe hostess and waitstaff were all incredibly friendly, prompt with service and very accommodating. Interesting to note that checkout devices allow you to swipe your credit card yourself, sign and select a tip amount. Tip choices have been modified to 30%, 25% and 20%...in that order, so your first inclination is to select the highest. I think you can still select the option 'other' and write your own amount, but it requires more work, so it is doubtful that people will take the opportunity to do it.

The same cannot be said of the frozen, bland, over cooked vegetables or the garlic mashed potatoes that lacked any hint of garlic, salt, butter, or any semblance of flavoring. The side accompaniments were like retirement home food fare. There is no welcome or acknowledgement upon entering the front door, we walked in and waited for anyone to notice us standing there, 2 servers walked past without any eye contact and said somebody would be with us shortly before a third person told us to go find a table in the bar.

We were told 45 minutes, so we walked to the bar next door to have a drink in the meantime. They said they would give us a call when our table was ready.

So we show up 10 minutes later, and Bonnie (hostess? manager?) seemed all pissy for having to hold our table for us. First red flag, but we wanted to try the lobster rolls, so whatever.\\n\\nAnyway, we sit down, order a bottle of champagne, and 2 minutes later our waitress comes over and very rudely asks, \\"You gonna order any food or no?\\" Yes. Yes we would like to order food. That's why we came to a restaurant. So we order 3 lobster rolls, and wait for our champagne to arrive. But it never did. Finally, the lobster rolls come out, and we ask where our champagne is. The waitress responds, \\"Oh, we ran out of that champagne, but I can get you a bottle of the other one.\\" The bottle we ordered was $49, while the \\"other one\\" was $93, so of course we didn't want the other one. My mom tried explaining to the waitress that typically, when restaurants are out of a bottle, they will honor the next level bottle at the same price for the original bottle. The waitress got super angry and started yelling at my mom, saying that's not what they do. So we figured we would just eat our lobster rolls and get the f out of there.\\n\\nLobster rolls were good, don't get me wrong. But they are WAY overrated. There was so much bread for the amount of lobster that I shoved all of the lobster to one side of the roll and only ate half of the roll.

That's all we had to eat.\\n\\nBefore going to leave, I wanted to speak to a manager and tell them about our terrible service and not even being able to order a drink before dinner. When I asked to speak to a manager, Bonnie came back out, and I told her about what happened. Bonnie has to be the rudest person I've ever dealt with at a restaurant. Instead of offering an apology, she started arguing with me! Seriously. We just spent $100 on 3 lobster rolls, didn't even get to have a drink with dinner, and you can't even say I'm sorry?

The counter worker (the same person we had met before) didn't care, didn't apologize, just stood there and said she \\"didn't think it was a big deal\\". The owner came over to complain about how she had had to \\"go back and forth with us so many times\\". This isn't even true. We had had one brief visit (where we tried to order a cake, and were prevented from doing so), and one quick phone call to ask about icing flavors (which change weekly).\\n\\nMy partner was the one who had done the talking during our visit, he also made the phone call. He is not from the United States, and sometimes needs English words repeated. My partner is not white, and he felt there was a \\"racist element\\" to the owner's hostility. This is particularly upsetting, given that the owner had hung a sign saying \\"Refugees Welcome\\" on her bakery's front door. She certainly was not \\"welcoming\\" to us. \\n\\nI can put up with unpleasant people if they produce a decent product, but Violette truly does not. We did not use the cake for our celebration, but we did taste it, and we were glad we didn't serve it to our guests, as the cake was really disappointing, bordering on gross. The cake was soggy, crumbly, and flavorless. The cake didn't hold its shape at all, it came apart into a pile of wet crumbs at the slightest touch of the fork. It fell apart like sand, you would have needed a spoon to eat it. The cake had almost no flavor, like overcooked oatmeal. The rough texture gave way to a soggy paste in my mouth; entirely unpalatable. The icing was thick, heavy fudge, its rigid texture and cloying flavor overpowered the cake. A total failure in every regard."},{"name":"Korean Grille","address":"1429 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3","text":"Probably the worst experience, ive walked past this place for years wanting to try their food.

Located in an excellent courtyard shared with Vortex Theatre and Butterfly Bar, the vibe is about as good as a food truck can offer. The food is always honest and the thin, flat handmade pasta is qualitatively different from most. Prices are reasonable for what you get. \\n\\nThat said, you may want to sit down or stop reading now while I go off on a bit of a rant: It's a frickin' pain in the ass to eat here. You stand in a line to order. You won't get a good look at the menu posted next to the window until you're next up to order. They'll ask you where you're sitting but unless you've left some valuables parked at a table you won't have one claimed. If you want anything to drink other than water from an igloo cooler you'll have to then stand in line at the Butterfly bar next door. You'll be halfway through that beer/wine before you get your food and you're not getting a second glass because flies will cover your plate the second you get up to go back to the bar. Your food is served on a paper plate with a plastic fork, but don't ask for a f**king paper copy of your credit card receipt because they're, ahem, \\"zero waste.\\" When you're done you'll feel like a bit of a tool if you don't bus your table and sort your waste between landfill, recycling, and composting. You'll have to decide up front how much of a tip this level of service does or does not warrant... pick a number between \\"tool\\" and \\"sucker\\" or split the difference and feel a bit of both.\\n\\nThe food, as I mentioned previously, is always honest. And while it presents with a hipster foodie kinda of authenticity, I'm less certain of its *Italian* authenticity and you can't help but notice the limitations of running a restaurant out of a small trailer: There's one variety of pasta. You pick a sauce and a protein as a side order. Then maybe they tell you they're out of chicken after you've ordered and would you mind having a meatball and tomato sauce with your arugula pesto because those go together about as elegantly as...\\n\\nAhem.\\n\\nSo, why am I writing a pissy rant and still giving four stars?

This makes for a... different dining experience when you're not planning to do any bowling. Noisy too, btw.\\n\\nI ordered their fusion burger with bacon. It's a cross between two of their burgers, which look tasty and seem to be their spicy burgers (well, if \\"inferno\\" is referring to the spice and not the color of the sauce or meat, that is).\\n\\nThe ginger guy taking orders was very nice and friendly. He brought the burger and asked for sauces and such. Very happy with his service.\\n\\nI want to start with their jalape√±o ranch. Awesome! My second favorite of any I have ever had. I doubt they make it there but whoever/wherever it comes from, they do a pretty sweet job of it.\\n\\nThe fries have some spices added that make them good without ketchup but they are unquestionably better with the aforementioned ranch.\\n\\nThe burger is great. I imagine the meat is nothing special, likely being a frozen patty (please forgive me if I am wrong and have offended). But it doesn't matter because the burger is great. It has a little bite, it's juicy and there's plenty of flavors with everything on it. I love that the bacon is actually crispy so you get a crunch when you take a bite. My only criticism is it could use bite. It's probably spicy for normal human beings, I don't know. But if I'm ordering a burger labeled \\"inferno\\", granted it's supposed to be the hybrid, as I mentioned, but I expected it to be -- HOT. It's not hot. It's a medium. So as a result, I'd have to rate it as my 3rd favorite spicy burger. \\n\\nI definitely plan to be back for it. Hey, I'd come back just for the ranch.\\n\\nGood job to whoever designed their burgers. Quite unexpected for a bowling place."},{"name":"Stretch the Noodle","address":"232 SW Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place, simply put, is awesome. I love hand pulled noodles and this place has some incredible noodles. \\n\\nThe biang biang noodles here are my favorite that I've had anywhere - the chili vinegrette is slightly sweet, not too spicy, smoky and deliciously coats the noodles perfectly. The dough, is perfectly chewy and soaks up sauce like a champ - it has a perfect al dente mouthfeel. What is furthermore incredible is the noodle when it comes to you is more or less in one (maybe two) continuous strands. The stir fried noodles are very good too - probably a more complete meal, but plenty of thick spaghetti type noodles, some sauce again (medium spicy) with saut√©ed spinach, onions, shredded carrot and chicken - which comes in large chunks, which I greatly appreciate since you can see the chicken and have more char on it. Everything is delicious.\\n\\nNote: the portions as astronomical - one box, cheap as it is, can easily feed 2-3 people and feels as hefty as it looks. If you wanna carb load, this is definitely the way to go, or if you're more like me, grab a few friends and go order some stuff from some of the other carts and have a potluck."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Pizza Company","address":"118 Washington St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"My life for a bit better when I discovered this place.

People were just getting off of work and getting ready to dine here later. We decided to sit out at the patio as it was a beautiful day. The patio was gorgeous. \\n\\nWe spent some time looking through the menu and decided on tapas and paella. Why did we go with those options? Well my friends, if you don't remember my check in from last August I was in Barcelona and those were the primary dishes I ate on a daily basis on my vacation there with my family. \\n\\nThe tapas were small as expected which was just their suggestion of us trying the cooked shrimp, it was very good. If my husband could get more, I would have liked to try the calamari as well. \\n\\nI was trying to see if the chef got his idea to cook the same as the Catalan's did in Barcelona while I spent time there. I did notice a few variations to this dish from the original one in Barcelona. Less mussels, because we aren't very close to water and it would have to be shipped. More mussels in the dish in Spain due to plenty of water nearby for fisherman to catch them. The dish here is a bit smaller then what they serve in Spain as it's in a much larger skillet and the Spaniards don't only use rice to make it, but they can also use pasta. Rice is just one of the staples they are known to put in it. \\n\\nAs if we weren't full enough, we topped our meal off with a tres leches cake. Vlad doesn't realize I've had this cake before so I pretended to just enjoy it during the present time. I believe I tried it before years ago, when I first made my trip to Spain alone without any family to discover the river my ancestors were from. I didn't make it to the Rubino river, but I made it to my aunt's home safely in time to try the same cake we had here. The cake here was very moist and definitely five star quality.\\n\\nIf you want a five star meal in Columbus, consider Barcelona. It is expensive but you are paying for quality.

We've encountered zero problems with waitstaff, zero problems with food quality.  We found the owner to be very attentive---actually visiting each table and inquiring about the food we ate.  The twist on every day items (homemade ketchup!, homemade potato chips) makes it\\" jump ahead of every other American bistro style place.  This place is a combination of superb pub food (burgers, fish and chips) and wonderful dinner items that  take the all -American food (meat loaf, for example) and raises it to a whole new level.  Garlic potatoes, stuffed meatloaf, roasted veggies (not the boiled gray things). Perfectly prepared All American  red meat.   Superb.  Price is extremely reasonable.  And I love the idea that this local business supports other local businesses by purchasing locally grown and available meats and veggies--right down to the sirloin that was grass fed practically next door. I do have one thing that does not affect the food or the service, though, which is why I gave it 5 stars.   The high top tables.  If you want to watch TV and you are at a regular table, the occupants at the high top will block your view.  I understand the owner is looking to change that.  Maybe he can move them against the wall until it is changed.  But like I said, never a problem with the food or the service.  And we are headed back there in a few days.

I've tried both locations and they both are pretty similar, but I really like this location better although I don't have any particular reason why. In my opinion no Cajun dining experience can start without having a cup or bowl of gumbo I prefer the chicken and sausage file' gumbo here over the seafood but that's a personal choice and probably because of all the bowls I've eaten growing up, a version of this type was pretty much a staple in our home. I also tried the bbq shrimp appetizer this visit and like lots of Cajun dishes they tend to vary quite a bit depending on the region and honestly this version was extremely soupy so the shrimp were more boiled than anything, this is not anything I want to experience again. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Cajun Shrimp Pasta and the Fried Shrimp and Catfish Basket and of course beignets to complete the meal. The Shrimp Pasta was really good it could of been a little spicier but the hot sauce table side helped out a little. The fried shrimp and catfish were delicious as well - the beignets were amazing too. The service was very good, attentive and very friendly the restaurant's decor is festive and the drinks are strong so any disappointment I had in regards to the food I can overlook after all this is not New Orleans or a mom and pop cafe in southwest Louisiana so your not going to hear me complain.

So I sat and I waited. They tell me everything is ready, but when I look in the boxes I noticed some items ordered were not there but some items not ordered were. They tell me they are out of the items ordered and just decided they were going to substitute for other items I didn't want and couldn't eat instead of asking me if I wanted to substitute or just get a refund for the items they don't have. This all left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. I get home and finally get to eat over 2 hours after leaving to pick up the food. It's not only all cold, but it's not very good at all.

NEVER ORDER FOOD FROM HERE (sit-ins are ok). \\n\\nFirst of all, Halal Bros FORGOT about my $1000 catering order until I called a day before our event. I even got the confirmation email, but received no response to my attempts to follow up. The management (aka the 3 brothers) tends to shift responsibility to another brother whenever anything goes wrong - organization is very lacking in the business. After the order was finally completed and I tipped them a generous amount for their efforts, the next problem was that they couldn't follow through with sending me an simple itemized receipt even after 6 REQUESTS. When I called in to ask if I could also get a printed proof-of-payment receipt (because they failed to give me my first one), a different person each time told me that they would email me a copy or that they would find out what they could do about it. Over the course of 2 WEEKS, after I'd called in at least 5 times to follow up with their promises, I finally was told to go to the restaurant in person. When I did, I was YELLED AT (literally) by the manager for \\"badgering\\" them. He said that every one of his employees had reported to him about me and said in my face, \\"You think your order is big? NO, $1000 is NOT a lot. We have 50-60 catering orders a week and yours was in-sig-nificant.\\" First of all, if they reported to him, then WHY WASN'T ANYTHING DONE ABOUT IT? Second, when I picked up the pounds upon pounds of food that day they even exclaimed, \\"You worked us hard today!\\" How is that insignificant?! \\n\\nI stopped the manager before a huge argument happened and said all I needed him to know was that his employees weren't following through. His response? \\"Does that matter now? You got your receipt now, what more do you want? (Me: \\"I want you to have more responsibility over your employees\\") But what does that MATTER?\\" \\n\\nIt matters because your customers are the life and blood of your business. Even if I had ordered a single gyro over rice for $8, I should still have been treated with respect and dignity. Because of their incompetence, my reimbursements for the $1000 I paid out of my OWN POCKET were delayed a whole month, no less. \\n\\nMY ADVICE TO THE 3 BROTHERS IN CHARGE, should you be reading this: Please consider all of the above and learn better communication skills - not only with each other, but also with your customers.\\n\\nSimilar situations have happened with other student orgs in the past and I ignored the warning, because the food is delicious and popular.

I walked up to the hostess who seemed to be completely occupied as she didn't even notice that I was standing there so I patiently waited. There was another lady at the front of the house who was nice enough to offer us a sample of chickpea bruschetta which was a very nice gesture. I told her that I had made a reservation and she went to help me. Simultaneously, another couple walked right in, gave them their name and reservation and they were directly to their table immediately. That does not give me a very good first impression because I was initially ignored and while I had reservations as well, someone who walks right in gets immediate attention.\\n\\nAfter waiting about 5 more minutes, my name was called and my friend and I were brought upstairs to a table for two by the window.

I felt like the table was just put there are the end of the banquette, where there was not enough walking room for food servers.\\n\\nOur waiter was very friendly to start, letting us know what was good and what wasn't. We ordered the calamari to start and before it came out.. we saw the salad next to us and my friend had a craving for greens. Asking what it was, we ordered the Panzella salad in addition to the calamari. The calamari was delicious... crispy and not over fried, and the tomato sauce gave it additional flavours. The Panzella came out shortly after and considering it is one of their \\"favourites,\\" I found it completely overdressed.... it was drenched in the dressing and I could not taste anything in my mouth except for it. The burata was nice, although I would have much rather had it with a drizzle of the vinagrette. The grapes were sweet.. and I think I got one heirloom tomato out of the salad.\\n\\nI saved the rest of the calamari for leftovers in order to have room for my main course. Originally wanting to share the pasta platter, I found out my friend doesn't eat beef, so I ordered the Spicy Kobe Meatballs with Spaghetti, while my friend ordered the linguini with jumbo prawns.

BEWARE. as I mixed the spaghetti together, the pasta got larger and larger. I got through one and a half meatballs and half my pasta (yay for leftovers). At first bite of the meat, there was definitely a good kick to it, but once you mixed it in with the rest of the dish, everything was fantastic and I could not complain..\\n\\nWe were so full that even the ever enticing tiramisu could not win me over.... The restaurant has a great atmosphere although it was extremely loud and sometimes it was hard to communicate ... but that reflects how people are having a good time and enjoying themselves.\\n\\nI felt that by the end of the night, our waitor was getting a little impatient, as I felt like I was being rushed to make decisions, including whether to get dessert, coffee, and the bill. \\n\\nHowever, I would try italian kitchen again for their pasta platter if someone had a pasta/ italian craving...

The portion was definitely too small for me, but I dig the meal. The veggies were seasoned well and the duck egg on top was a nice bind to it all. The gnudi was interesting and made up the majority of the meal. It was a needed starch to fulfill this stomach of mine. \\n\\nI'm pretty glad that His meal of steak and eggs came out a decent size.

Pointing out the reasons below (along with an update):\\n\\n(1) There is no way to see what baked goods are available until it is time to order, and there is a group of impatient people behind you. It would be so much nicer to see what is on offer while waiting in line.\\n\\n(2) All the payments are done with the workers and customers reaching OVER the case of baked goods. This skeeves me out every time. Again, just by re-arranging the set-up, this could be easily solved.\\n\\n(3) After paying with a credit card, I'm handed the reader (again, over the food I'm about to receive), and asked to sign it with my finger. The same screen hundreds of people before me have touched. Ewwwww. It's 2019. There must be a way around requiring a signature for an under-$10 payment.\\n\\n(4) There is no convenient place to wait for the food. Everyone crowds into the narrow area in front of the creamer and cutlery supplies, blocking the people who need to access that table. \\n\\nUpdating my review after an email from one of the managesr, who pointed out that there is a dedicated smartphone app that lets you order ahead. I tried this and it works GREAT. So I'll use that in the future.

The neighborhood is pretty tired looking, and although there are hundreds of homeless people within a few blocks of the restaurant, it didn't seem dangerous. \\nMy main problem with the food was obvious when we walked into the restaurant and smelled the smoke.  It was strong and wrong and bitter. The brisket, pulled pork, and sausage were all cooked correctly and were fairly tender and moist. The sausage had very little smoke flavor, and I highly recommend it. It had good texture and flavor.  The brisket was ok, but the bark had a bitter and off-putting flavor. The pork was worse. I think this place could be a 5, if they just change the smoking wood.  Texas BBQ is not done with maple, alder and birch. Strongly suggest they dump the alder and birch, and just use maple (or oak), and applewood. BC has lots of applewood. This would fix all of their smoke flavor problems and significantly raise the level of their BBQ. \\nAll that's left is to get rid of the horseradish in the coleslaw and add enough vinegar or creamy dressing to taste something besides cabbage and horseradish. \\nDixie's is very close to making some world class BBQ."},{"name":"Slapfish","address":"783 N Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Should you visit Slapfish?

I'd give working here a shot, if I didn't need a quiet place.\\n\\nBut the coffee and the food....seriously, they've got it going ON.  Since this was my first visit, I put myself in the barista's hands.  I got a large latte (their special spiced version) and the sampler plate, which included 2 empanadas and 2 things I had never heard of.  You'll see it, it's the first item on the menu. \\n\\nThe latte came out first, and it was pretty.  Like, really pretty.  One sip, and I was suddenly far more eager for whatever was coming out on that sampler plate.  It was delicious.  Rich, creamy, ginger-y, I don't know what all was going on in that cup of latte but I was glad to be part of it.\\n\\nThen the plate came out, and it too was pretty.  A round chewy thing, a round thing with a point on the end, and two empanadas.  Not sure if any/all were fried or baked, but they weren't greasy.  There was also a little ramekin of mysterious colorful substance.  I asked the friendly barista what this was, but the answer was mysterious, and I decided to forge on for myself.\\n\\nI bit into the round chewy thing first.  It was a light, fluffy, yet chewy cheesy ball of yum.  \\n\\nNext, the pointy thing, which was a surprise.  It had a very crispy exterior, which was thicker than I expected.  Kind of like a shell.  Inside was a ball of shredded chicken.  Very yummy and went with the mysterious substance, which turned out to be a vegetable sauce similar to garden flavored cream cheese, but not as thick.\\n\\nThe empanadas were quite satisfying but not heavy.  I got the vegetable one, which was quite savory,  and the guava/cheese one, which was sweet.  Loved the savory, wasn't a fan of the slab of guava jelly.

I feel you'd need to be in a different state of mind (and wardrobe) depending on where you're seated. But with that said, I still loved it.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nThe menu wasn't \\"advertised\\" this way but it's a menu of small plates - some a little closer to entree size, but still on the small side. Everything tasted great! Unique combinations and lots of flavor. In terms of price, you could go full out and have it be a fairly pricey meal or stick to their house beer and wine - and lower priced small plates - and make it out at a pretty reasonable rate. I appreciated that!\\n\\nThe Atmosphere: Inside\\nThe entire place is stunning. The interior feels like a romantic, dark den where you could settle in for hours. No matter where you sit (bar, table, window-bar, sofas and coffee tables) you get full waiter service. We had a cocktail at the bar and I'll definitely be back inside to dine sometime soon.\\n\\nThe Atmosphere: Outside\\nThe outside patio consists of a smaller, raised deck filled with tables, umbrellas, and heaters. (That's where we sat for dinner.) There are so many heaters that no matter where you sit (when it's chilly) it appears you'll stay warm! You also have the choice of being seated at ground level, in the more casual - large - patio. I haven't been down there yet but it seems ideal for daytime (Muchacho). That's one thing I struggled with; I couldn't imagine sitting down there while dining from Golden Eagle's more formal dinner and drinks menu, being waited on by servers dressed head to toe in black - refolding your napkins every time you leave your seat. I almost wish the lower-level patio was more Ladybird-style where you can order drinks and more casual bites from the attached Muchacho space instead of getting the full service of Golden Eagle. Just my two cents.\\n\\nMisc:\\nThere's an attached parking lot, which seems plenty large enough for the restaurant most of the time. If it filled you could find free street parking a block or so away. While it was being constructed I questioned what the patio would feel like, sitting RIGHT by the busy intersection of Memorial & Bill Kennedy. They did a great job designing the space: putting up wall segments to block headlight from shining in your eyes and lots of umbrellas, string lights, chandeliers, and foliage to fill the space. And the music is cranked up just loud enough to drown out the car noises.

I have had this place on my to-so list for quite awhile and it did not disappoint.   From food to service the experience here was top notch.\\n\\nTo start when we walked in we were instantly greeted by all the staff.   As this is a build your own bowl concept the process took a few to figure out what we wanted, and this isn't your typical ingredients list so it takes a bit to figure out what you are doing, but the staff is patient and helpful.   When adding items to bowl the employee would happily explain items if needed and warned when there were up charges when they would apply, which I appreciate the upfront nature.   When putting items on, the employee happily added extra when asked.   Upsells were offered but never in a pushy manner, which was also appreciated.\\n\\nThe food itself is excellent and very flavorful.   Being as the food is fusion there is a wide variety of flavor going on, but everything is well seasoned without being overpowering.   My wife had a steak bowl on the brown rice with lentils, mushroom, broccolini, and pickled onions topped with tabbouli and tzatziki with feta cheese.  My bowl was brown rice with pork, picked onions, eggplant/squash and topped with Pico de Gallo, tabbouleh, tzatziki and feta cheese, finished with chimmichurri on the side.

There were so many deliciously seasoned and sauced shrimp they spilled out of the perfectly crusted bread. The lettuce and tomato were fresh and cold.

It's important to know that it will take you about 20 mins to order and then you will have to wait at least 40 mins for the food to actually come out. All of the seating is outdoors which is nice but I think it could be a downfall in the winter or mid summer. Although there is a small parking lot, it's important to realize the spots don't turnover because everyone has to wait an hour before they get their food, so you are limited to side street parking, but because there are so many restaurants around there is very little convenient side street parking. \\n\\nWhen the food did eventually come it was room temperature. The garlic bread was cold and then than average. It came out with about 8 garlic cloves on each piece which was a little over the top. The bread itself was nice. \\n\\nThe side salad also had far too much garlic in it, although the dressing was nice, the overall salad was mediocre \\n\\nI got the pomodoro pasta on the recommendation of one of the workers and it was so far below sub par. They taut themselves as authentic Italians good but having been to Italy several times in the past, this was an embarrassing comparison. The pomodoro sauce lacked any flavor and the pasta was stuck together. Although you could tell it was fresh pasta, it was clear they did not add olive oil to it to keep it from sticking. The only redeeming quality of the entire dish was the meatball which had fantastic flavor and was a good size, unfortunately it was not warm either. \\n\\nMy friend got the carbonara pasta, and although it was not a true carbonara it was nice. \\n\\nI am extremely disappointed with this restaurant. I was extremely excited to eat freshly made pasta. I knew the wait would be long, but after eating here I could not justify waiting for this food at all. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Although the wait staff and the atmosphere was nice, it cannot make up for the small amount of parking and the long wait for sup bar food.

Forever. As a Beverly resident for 28 years, I'd been anticipating the arrival of Franks for quite a while. \\n\\nMy first visit was for breakfast. Days after they opened. The coffee was exceptional. I had a latte. Strong coffee taste which I love, even though it was a decaf. Thank you for that. I got a pastry. It was fine. The pastry part which was like a croissant was excellent, crispy, perfect, the middle was a banana praline, I guess I didn't personally care for the combination, which I would say is my fault. This was days after they opened, so during the breakfast time there were construction workers in the other part. \\n\\nI got a reservation right away for my family of 4. This was the Sunday before Thanksgiving when they'd been open just a couple of weeks. The 2 males in our family got hamburgers and both thought they were excellent. They are hard critics for hamburgers. If you have someone who will eat little else, I feel the hamburger is there for them. \\n\\nFoodie vegetarian daughter got the sweet potato agnolotti with mushrooms though she doesn't like sweet potato. She felt it was done perfectly, and though the amount given wasn't generous, it was enough. She felt that each bite was a gift and highly recommends it. This is high praise from her, trust me. \\n\\nI got the half roasted chicken brussel sprouts jus. An odd thing for me to get. I had wanted the duck. A disappointment, is that all of us had studied the menu ahead of time, and not all items were on it. I don't know if that is because the menu are samples, or because they were not yet fully operational. \\n\\nThis chicken was done perfectly. It was a very small chicken, slightly larger than a cornish game hen, again, more than large enough. I did take some home to have the experience again the next day. I wasn't because I couldn't finish it. The skin was crispy, the meat so tender and juicy, the brussel sprouts were very nice and soft though browned and carmelized, I usually cook them to be crispy. Their flavor had many layers to it and I appreciated it. I wanted to find out how they were cooked. \\n\\nPart of the charm and secret here is obviously starting with excellent ingredients. And that was evident in everything. \\n\\nWe did have some issues with out waiter. None of us could understand his name. Could have been Justin, or Jason. Not sure. He spoke very softly and we asked for repetition of many things. At the onset we asked for 2 bottles of water. They were quickly empty and we had to ask for new bottles a couple of times. He wasn't that busy, either. Was odd. We waited a bit too long for dessert menu, then bill. \\n\\nDesserts. I wanted to skip, my daughter ordered a couple to try. Creme brulee is more of a taste though it is a piece of art on the plate. Although I am not a fan of carrot cake, and won't usually even have a bite, this carrot cake it something else. Passion fruit puree or granita on top is just great. It is a generous piece and is light and fruity. \\n\\nYes, during breakfast the sandwiches were pulled back so they could rework them and now I just read they are back on the menu. Yes, they need to make sure their staff are consistent, some are excellent and from L'espalier in town. But don't discard this new Beverly eaterly. Franks is here to stay.

Frustration mounts from the size of their long lines waiting to get your food made and from the parking lot that is too small to handle the volume of the business they generate.\\n\\nAfter swearing I was done coming to this location, I was working in the area and thought I would compromise by using their online ordering system. \\n\\nMy mistake as I wasted ten minutes finding a parking spot, five minutes to walk to the store, fifteen minutes waiting to pay my bill as there were several other pick ups ahead of me and they were checking out two customers for each of us that went through the line, and another five minutes to walk back to my car.\\n\\nChipotle isn't too big to fail and they are failing when it comes to their online ordering. Why not have a line and a checkout to process call in and online orders instead of integrating them into to their regular line. If the call ahead/online is not busy they can jump in and help the regular line. \\n\\nInstead of thinking and working smarter, they choose to be inefficient and irritate all of their customers at the same time. Upper Arlington or Grandview should have required them to have a bigger parking lot before ever letting them put that business there or they should require them to have designated carryout/pick up spots that turnover quickley.\\n\\nI do think that cashiers or workers should offer an apology for long wait times or obvious inefficiency and at least thank the customer. When they don't, I watched seven consecutive people walk out without a thank you, they let their customers leave agitated, indifferent, and unappreciated.

The pasta, even a full order, is not too large or heavy a meal.  I got the carbonara and added the pork milanese.  The carbonara had a nice egg on top, spilling rich yolk on the pasta, which was delicate in flavor and definitely NOT oversauced, bringing out all the flavors.  The pork was nicely fried with some crispy ends and was fork tender.  And of course I can't review Nic's place without recommending his balls.  THE BIGGEST BALLS OF THEM ALL.

I mean, I was a hot mess!\\n\\nThe spot: The building is very unassuming. We have driven past it who knows how many times and never noticed it. If you blink you will miss it. It is directly off of 71 less than a mile west of the Bee Cave Galleria. The interior is also very unassuming. Very simple, paneled walls, and cafeteria feeling. \\n\\nThe service: Art, out host and waiter, happily welcomed us in and showed us to our table. Quickly brought chips and salsa. We ordered a tea and a water and I asked Art about BYOB. \\"Hey, yeah! It takes 5 minutes to go Spec's. Hurry back.\\" About 7 minutes later my hubby returns with a six pack of Corona. Art immediately asked if we wanted them \\"iced down?\\" \\"Yes, please.\\" Next thing you know the bottles were in a bucket covered with ice. Talk about quality customer service!!! \\n\\nThe food: #3 Combo - One crispy beef taco, cheese enchilada and a tamale (of course had to try a tamale) both covered with chili con carne. Taco - So good! The smaller sized, really thin shell, bite into it falls apart, juices run down you arm, using a fork to clean the plate kind. Could eat 10 of those! Enchilada - A-OK. Tamale - surprisingly not my favorite thing I sampled. They are pork, which is spot on...there was just a textural thing...maybe too firm...A-OK. \\n\\nCarne GUISADA Plate: How have I never heard of or has this dish before???!!! The MOST tender beef tips smothered in a very tasty (tad salty) brown gravy that I could have drank from a cup! Came with guacamole, rice and beans. Some of the freshest, most creamy guac I've had. Rice a-ok. Beans were phenomenal. So creamy and savory. I swore they had lard in them, but I was told no. They were lardy good beans!\\n\\nOverall: Definitely going back for the Guisada, tacos, and guac!!! Plates average about $10 and add the fact you can BYOCoronas (or bev of choice) = a bargain! And a fulfilling, tasty meal. \\n\\nTips: Call ahead and order take-out. Tell them your preferred pickup time and they'll have it ready for you.

We swung by again recently, after visiting Savannah and Charleston, to attend a nephew's graduation ceremony at Emory University. We celebrated with a memorable experience at La Grotta. We were a party of five, so I won't go into minute detail about everyone's dinner choices, but we were all in the mood to share, so I can comment on a few dishes I sampled. I had the veal scaloppine. It was served with a tableside shaving of an entire black truffle. Yes, it was conspicuous (in a subtle way) and delicious! I also enjoyed a side of linguini with my choice of putanesca sauce, which in living up to its character, had everything but the kitchen sink in the sauce--very rich and satisfying. One of my dining companions had the lamb chops. I felt guilty after having a bite. It was the best lamp I'd ever tasted. Another standout dish was Gamberetti Fra Diavolo con Linguini Aglio Olio, a saut√© of jumbo Mediterranean shrimp with a spicy Tomato sauce and linguine tossed with olive oil & fresh garlic. The shrimp were so large, I almost mistook them for lobster tails. Suffice to say the food is outstanding, but not too heavy.\\n\\nFor dessert, we all shared five different sweet treats: Tiramisu, Creme Brule√©, Torta di Cioccolato Rustico (a rich chocolate cake), Panna Cotta (a silky custard drizzled with a berry sauce), and Torta di Formaggio (a ricotta cheesecake with lemon zest). All of the desserts were a success. It took a lot of restraint to keep from hogging it all, but I didn't stab anyone with my fork. How do I even stay in shape?\\n\\nThe atmosphere at La Grotta is unique. Just finding one's way down to the basement with its rich decor, bustling atmosphere, and an unexpected outdoor garden view was exotic and exciting. The entire staff appeared semi-formally attired, yet approachable. They moved easily around the room of full tables like a well-oiled machine. I felt a comfortable sense of family among the staff. They provided an appropriate sense of urgency, but showed up at just at the right moments, never making us feel rushed or ignored.\\n\\nIf I lived in Atlanta, this would be a list topper for restaurant choices.

It is a low move to keep removing, freezing (if you will) your competition out of your building, just to keep your melting ice cream business afloat. It is no secret in the community that your product is sub-zero and far worse than your immediate competitors (Jeni's, Queen of Cream, Cookout, McFlurries, Kroger Brand, Ice Cream Trucks, Zesto's, King of Pops, DQ, just to name a few). Your ice cream is grainy and clumpy. It isn't smooth, and you can taste small frozen bits, as opposed to a creamy blend. The flavors that have fillings taste stale (like the red velvet for example). Putting in old, mediocre red velvet cake into flavorless vanilla ice cream doesn't hide the lack of quality in both ingredients. In this instance, two negatives do not make a positive. In coffee shops, when I see they are housing your low-grade, overpriced product, I turn the other way.\\n\\nBut, let's get to the more important matter at hand. First, you infamously removed a local favorite from the Irwin Market, Bell Street Burritos, only to replace it with failed business after failed business (did you really think a restaurant that only sells f****** Kebobs for $10 a stick would be a good idea? And now, you put in your own ice cream store, that as I described earlier, clearly never lived up to the quality Bell Street provided to the community. But now, I think you have crossed the line. You have pushed out a true gem in the city, O4W Pizza. I know you are saying all the right things publicly about the situation, but what you lack in ability to produce good ice cream, you also seem to lack in integrity. The truth is, if you wanted them to stay, they would. Why would they behind this location in the heart of the city, along the Beltline, to just be opened in Duluth? That doesn't add up at all. But do you know what does add up? Your proven history of pushing out local favorites from your building that appear as threats to your own business/personal brand.\\n\\nIce cream is supposed to be a lavish escape, not a cold reminder that greedy businessmen care more about money than providing an amazing product to a loyal, local following. I will surely miss eating O4W's amazing pizza, but I will not miss indirectly giving you money, as I know I will never buy anything in your building again. It will be really tough for me to not buy those $50 dollar Globe lamps that hang in the communal seating area, that I could make myself for 2$, but I think I will be able to manage. Maybe the next vendor that replaces O4W will be great too, but as history has shown, it will just be a matter of time before you scoop them right out too. The freezer burn on your average-at-best ice cream will inevitably melt off, but what won't ever melt is your cold heart. \\n\\nSincerely,\\nThe Atlanta/Old Fourth Ward Community"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Don't even know what the food tastes like cause the first time trying this highly raved brunch spot- they messed our order up.

I thought NACHOS was a big pile of chips drenched in melty cheese and hefty protein-packing beans, a fill you up kinda meal, but this was the faux nachos favored by fusion Mexican restaurants.

An hour later, still no drink, despite the server having told us 30 mins before that she was sorry for the delay and that drinks would be right out.  After an hour with nothing to show for it, we let her know we were done waiting and were  going to go some place else. She replied, \\"Oh, okay.

There's every other restaurant in the world to try, nothing is clang the bells good about it, but I keep going back there. About once every 18 months or so, I find myself soaking Dube Nuggets in Berties Inferno sauce and drinking the shot of tequila that comes with CC's margarita.\\n\\nI don't know what to suggest to you other than the Dube Nuggets, batter-fried lumps of white cheddar served with a hot-sweet berry sauce, I think of them as the signature item on the menu. Everything else is unremarkable in my opinion. They have lots of crazy liquor behind the bar and the specials are interesting.\\n\\nI would not call the service good. To call it hit or miss would suggest that it is sometimes a hit, it is not. You could probably call it adequate considering what the servers are working with. The menu is huge, the customers are mostly drunk, tips probably aren't all that great, let it slide.\\n\\nAm I telling you to try the Blue Danube? Is this a good review or a bad one? I don't know. What I do know is I'm going to order more Dube Nuggets, drink more tequila shots, and wait far too long for the server to pick up the bill. I'm still going to tip well, and the Dube will surely remain standing in my mind as long as it stands on High Street."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I had the pork schnitzel  for lunch, it was over cooked to the point of cardboard and over salted to the point of being inedible.

Along with with that we also added two 9 oz glasses of wine. \\n\\nThe pasta for the girls was fantastic and the Tuna Stack was exactly as always (yummy). Then came out mains. Ugh. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the 8oz sirloin creole, medium rare, with shrimp and veggies. I ordered the 12 oz peppercorn New York, medium rare with veggies. \\n\\nMy wife's steak was overcooked and tasted of charcoal. The shrimp, were actually perfectly cooked and the sauce was excellent. Her kale salad was also excellent (she had the salad instead of her potatoes). \\n\\nMy steak, on the other hand, was not only overcooked, but way overcooked. It tasted of briquettes. Literally. \\n\\nUnfortunately, for one of the very rare times, we sent our food back. It sucked to have to even do it....but there really was no choice. \\n\\nManagement came by and was awesome about it, which was much appreciated. Any time you send something back, you get those inevitable feelings of regret, even when you know you need to do it. \\n\\nOur second order came out (and our two little girls were somehow still keeping it together!) and.....even worse. My wife's was overcooked, which sucked, but mine?  It was charred BLACK on the bottom. Again, it tasted like absolute as*. I couldn't believe it. A medium rare steak, on a remake, comes out charred and medium well-well. Like.....really?\\n\\nWe tried....but we couldn't eat it. We flagged the server down (again, not her issue), and told her it was inedible. She had the manager come over and he apologized profusely when he saw the steak in front of me. He asked if he could bring us anything else, but already seemed defeated. He didn't say 'dude, this is unacceptable, we should be able to cook a $45 stead properly', he just asked if maybe he could get us something other than a steak. He actually said 'maybe I could do a pasta for for you?.....really?  No confidence in your kitchen to cook a steak properly?  I don't get it....not at all. \\n\\nWe gave up. Our bill was over $100 and we left....I still haven't eaten anything more than a few bites of a Tuna Stack and it is almost 10pm. This wasn't our server's fault....this was a kitchen issue and then an issue with management. You shouldn't ever have a good customer walk out your door feeling like we did. It's sad. It should be embarrassing. $100 for two kids meals and some wine.  \\n\\nIt's tough, because we are quiet, nice people. We don't want to make a scene, and to even ask to send the meals back is tough. \\n\\nBack to The Keg I guess. Sad, missed opportunity for management to turn it around and keep a valuable customer."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Finally made my rounds at this place. My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon. This place is so authentic and really felt like a good BBQ joint. This place has been running for 30 years and I love all the vintage images posted around. There are 3 portions of this restaurant. There's the dining area, the bar area, and the downstairs lounge area. They also have nights where they play blues music on certain nights.\\n\\nMy friend and I shared the Barbecue Belt and the Fried Chicken Dinner. The Barbecue Belt consists of: 2 St. Louis ribs, 1 Texas style ribs, 2 baby back ribs, beef brisket, and 1 sausage. My favorite from the belt was the St. Louis ribs because it didn't even need sauce. With the Barbecue Belt came with 2 sides and we got collard greens and mac and cheese. Both sides were great. Fried Chicken Dinner came with 2 pieces of fried chicken, boneless, mashed potatoes, fried okra, 2 biscuits, butter and peach jam. Everything on this plate was absolutely amazing. We also got their beignets. It comes fresh in a white paper bag with 4 small ones and it is SO GOOD.\\n\\nThe service was very good and the food came out reaaaallly quick.

The atmosphere (we were in the lounge) was fun, and we loved the red velvet booths and the knight in armor greeting us. \\n\\nCons: The ravioli was around $17, and we thought that was a bit pricey for the food we got. Also, the service was a bit slow, but we weren't in any rush. One noticeable disappointment (not a Huge disappointment, but still) was the absence of live music. We were expecting live music to start at 7, but it never appeared.

All have been delicious enough to order again.  The salads are super flavorful with fresh ingredients and light dressings.  I highly recommend the Farmer salad; the soft boiled egg adds so much flavor to it and the smoked bacon chunks are huge.  The salads are easily large enough to split between two people as a pre-dinner dish.\\n\\nFor my main entr√©e, my favorite dish has been the Grilled Local Cobia.  It was served with Charlie's new potatoes, grilled artichokes, green olive tapenade and pickled gypsy peppers. The fish was very tender and I loved the artichokes. I'm not a huge fan of green olives, but the tapenade was the perfect complement to the Cobia. This is definitely a dish I would order again.  I've also tried the tortellini variation with lobster, corn, okra, etc.  This was easily one of the most delicious pasta dinners I've ever eaten!\\n\\nFinally, DESSERT.  You can't NOT order dessert here!  I love that every time we've gone, the dessert menu has all kinds of new treats to try.  I'm a sucker for anything chocolate so for our anniversary dinner I was immediately drawn to the chocolate raspberry tart. SO GOOD!

Drunken scallops, pork tenderloin, chicken Parmesan and fresh salmon are just a few of the entrees featured. Delectable desserts like the brownie meltdown, vanilla bread pudding and a classic Florida favorite, key lime pie with A cookie crust round out your dessert options.\\n\\nOf course a round of cocktails was in order to get the evening started. The \\"French 65\\" features triple sec and angostura bitters over ice topped with orange juice and Champagne. The Strawberry Mojito is made with Shellback silver rum. This is hands down one of the best Moscow Mules I have ever had. Even if you are not a big fan of this drink...give it a try at Cork & Fork. New Amsterdam vodka, fresh squeezed lime, simple syrup shaken together and poured over ice and topped with ginger beer will have you coming back for more.\\n\\nThe house made Spinach and Artichoke Dip is served warm with pita chips and has water chestnuts added to it for a unique texture and crunch. This stuff was pretty addictive. \\n\\nCrispy Calamari is fried crispy with a bit of spice and tossed with cherry peppers and jalapenos. the calamari was good on its own, but the citrus chili dipping sauce was a great addition. The Ale Battered Onion Rings are house made, hand cut and served with a very delicious creamy lager fondue. Fried Zucchini sticks were pretty exceptional as well with a garlic yogurt dill sauce.\\n\\nThere are plenty of places to get a good burger in Orlando, but sadly most places rely on the toppings for flavor and don't season the ground beef properly. The Cork & Fork Burger with additional bacon and cheese was seasoned to perfection and served on a buttered bun and needed no condiments at all. The beef used here is sourced from the Seminole Tribe of Florida.\\n\\nI love Fish and Chips. That may sound simple and basic, but you'd be surprised how hard it is to find it done properly. The cod is brought in fresh everyday and never frozen at Cork & Fork, and this makes for some of the most flakiest and delicious fish and chips that I have had in quite some time. I usually like to soak my fish in malt vinegar, but that would have been an injustice to this delicious fish.\\n\\nSteak & Fries consists of local, best available steak prepared your way with French fries, house made ketchup and veggie of the day. This was cooked very well and the fries were crispy as well. Now if I had a brown gravy sauce to go with those fries....\\n\\nCauliflower Steak is a great vegetarian option with pan seared cauliflower in garlic, thyme, browned butter and saut√©ed spinach and shallots served with veggie of the day.\\n\\nThe Chocolate Lava Cake with chocolate ganache and vanilla bean ice cream was just plain stupid good. This Vanilla Bread Pudding with Hennessy cream sauce will have your taste buds spinning. Even if you are not the biggest bread pudding fan, give the one at Cork & Fork a try, you won't regret it.

The rest of the party also had issues with their meals and shared a general dislike of the food. When we asked for the manager the waitress said he was busy, which was unacceptable.

This wouldn't have been an issue except that there were 6 people ahead of me at the hostess stand and every time she left to take someone to their table she'd be gone for a while so essentially I waited a long time just to give her the name of a person I could see right from where I was standing.

I've ordered food in plenty of loud establishments, rowdy bars, etc so I didn't understand what the issue was and he seemed very impatient. One nice touch was the waiters coming around with warm water and towels so you could wash your hands before eating. Unfortunately, the towel I was given had a sour smell so I still had to use my hand sanitizer. \\n\\nNow for food...I started with the lamb chops which were really well seasoned and tender. I also ordered a side of couscous tabouli that was really filling, had a good amount of vegetables and had nice acidity. One of my favorite items was the spinach and feta spanakopita. It was flaky, buttery and the feta added a nice richness that went really well with the balsamic drizzle. For dessert, I ordered the baklava and I wasn't a fan.

She came out every few minutes to dance and had to come out to sing happy birthday to each birthday table which seemed like every table that night.

If you arrive early, be sure to feed the parking meter as I had no idea that the City of Portland was ticketing on Sunday ($60 fine :( ).\\n\\nOn a Sunday, if you arrive at 5:40, expect to wait up to 1 hour unless you're lucky enough to find a seat at the bar.\\n\\nThe menu is an interesting eclectic mixture of meats, veggies, and dishes ranging from Beef Tartar (very delish!!!!), Grilled Octopus (not bad), veggies, breads, and other dishes.\\n\\nFood is served tapas style and the atmosphere is wonderfully social.  Loud but not too loud to carry on a decent conversation.  The staff are very friendly, assertive and reliable.\\n\\nI ate the following on an empty stomach after having run the marathon:\\n\\n1. Ryan's Hmong Style Steak Tartare  Piedmontese (5 stars), with raw egg on top and watercress as a garnish, this was one of my favorite dishes here.  They are served with a crostini (a bread cracker), and a fennel.  \\n\\n2.  Foie Gras (4.5 stars), My favorite dish here and what I came here for.  Seared perfectly like in Paris, it melts in your mouth.  I didn't really that much for the jam.  It was good but they put too much of it on the plate and I thought because of its sweetness was a tad too overpowering.  I wound up eating the Foie Gras with just a tiny dab of it resulting in a lot of jam untouched.  The Foie Gras I ate here was the best I've ever had in the US.\\n\\n3.  Cocktail: Memphis Kilt LIfter (5 stars): This cocktail was out of this world weird in a very good way.  It's a mixture of whisky and an assortment of all sorts of elixirs. The cocktail consisted of a mixture of bank note scotch. mezcal vida. rhubarb amaro. lime. memphis bbq bitters.  Absolutely loved it.\\n\\n4.  Kale and Rainbow Chard (3.0 stars):  I love kale and although I liked it, thought it lacked flavored and seemed as if too much butter or oil was added to it.\\n\\n5.  Bone Marrow Toast (4.5 stars): Very tasty though I didn't think the bread was necessary.\\n\\n6.  Wagyu Skirt Steak (4 stars): The beef tasted good but seemed too raw..  I love raw meat but if its too raw, it's too hard to chew.  It although tasted as if it was doused in lighter fluid.  The oil could have been burned off a little better.\\n\\n7.  Bulgogi Short ribs (3 stars): This was good, but for the price, I'm getting what I could get for 1/3 the price at any decent Korean BBQ house.\\n\\n8.  Radicchio (3 stars) This salad of lardons (clumps of bacon) . manchego. chopped six minute egg had a weird after sweet creamy taste that I didn't really care for.  It's served cold and was too much for two people eating tapas style.\\n\\n9. Grilled Spanish Octupus (3 stars): It was too mushy for me.  I prefer octopus robata grilled style so this wasn't that special to me.  \\n\\nAll in all, I had a wonderful time here and would come here again."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Italian Kitchen on Burrard\\n8/18/19 last visit.\\n\\nCalimari fantastic: 2nd best I've had outside Barcelona, *narrowly* edged by the calimari 2 ways at La Terazza. Refined, crispy, and the deep fried peppers really complemented rather than overwhelmed the calimari. 4.75-5 stars. Puts casual dining ones to shame.\\n\\nWe couldn't decide which pasta to order, so we ordered the Pasta Platter (literally a sampler of all 3 that we wanted to try: truffled spaghetti and meatballs, gnocchi funghi, and seafood linguini.\\n\\nWhile I would've preferred more cream sauce on the truffled spaghetti (as we've had at sister Glowbal restaurant \\"Trattoria\\" on W. 4th Ave), it was still very good, and likely the result of our ordering the sampler version of the dish. The marinara on the meatballs themselves was plenty. Compared to the one we get at Trattoria, this was about 2/3 the size of the full plate, but just about as delicious. 4.25-4.5 stars.\\n\\nConveniently enough, the couple next to us ordered the gnocchi and seafood linguini so that we could compare the full versions.\\n\\nThe gnocchi fungi was hearty, flavourful and elevated; a little *too* much mushroom for me, but mushroom lovers would be in nirvana. 4.5 stars.\\n\\nCompared to the full serving next to us, this was about 2/3 of the full serving. The full version might not be that much bigger, but since gnocchi is mostly potato, it really doesn't need to be much bigger to be filling.\\n\\nThe seafood linguini had fresh, juicy prawns and perfectly cooked scallops. The linguini itself was just the right amount of al dente; the only negative was a cream sauce would've been preferable. This was tossed in tomato sauce, but the proteins were exquisite. 4.25-4.5 stars\\n\\nThe full portion dwarfed this sampler size... So much so that had we simply ordered that, we still would have had leftovers. Our sampler was still a good size, but maybe 40% of the size of the full portion.\\n\\nSo in summary, while you'd get more food ordering 2 full portions rather than the sampler plate, but we still had leftovers and prefer the variety.\\n\\nThe desserts... Are worthy of an upscale Italian restaurant. $11 each, and they're not huge. But they are delicious and unique. My wife ordered zappole... Which are essentially large doughnut hole (aka timbit) mini lava cakes. Deliciously decadent. 4.75-5 stars.\\n\\n... But smaller than we anticipated (we thought there would be more than 4 balls), which freed me up to partake in my own dessert. I chose the limoncello lava cake; similar to a chocolate lava cake, but much lighter and less rich. Loved this; while the Disney Limoncello tart served at the Paolo is still slightly superior, this is *really* close. And more unique. A must-try. 4.75 stars.\\n\\nOverall 8.9/10 4.5 stars."},{"name":"Slapfish","address":"783 N Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"First time here...thoroughly enjoyable experience, food was excellent and the staff is attentive and very friendly."},{"name":"Angelina's Pizza","address":"1437 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Hadn't ordered from here previously and the Foodler reviews looked decent.

Bacon lardons, manchego and a chopped six minute egg all mixed beautifully together; especially the egg - it was cooked just enough to solidify but still maintain it's creamyness. This might be my new favourite salad...although the amount of cholesterol and salt probably throws out the idea of having it everyday!\\n\\nFries were thinly cut and crispy while the sauce was a surprising play on upgraded Big Mac sauce.

After almost 5 hours of zigzag driving (we're awful drivers with no sense of direction), we made it to Neptune around 3pm -- our first destination. We made our way through the mass of people standing outside only to wait inside for about 20 minutes before the hostess acknowledged us. She was doubling as waitress so whatever. We were quoted a 2.5 hour wait which I had anticipated, based on the reviews that I had read. Soo, we went on a little lobster roll sampling run in the area (Pauly's, North End Fish Market, Boston Chowda Co) to wait it out. The host called us exactly 2.5 hours later!\\n\\nEven after devouring 3 lobster rolls, we were determined to sample a good portion of the menu. We ended up splitting some oysters, a lobster roll, and their scallops entree.\\n\\nThe oysters were AMAZING. You're given a little paper oyster menu and pencil to check off the ones that you want. We decided on the Beausoleil (hints of champagne), Kumamoto (hints of honeydew melon), and Kusshi(sweet, cucumber finish) based on the interesting descriptions. I'm not sure why I was so surprised when they all tasted exactly as they were described hahahha but that was indeed the case. So fresh. Soo good. My favorite was the Kumamoto!\\n\\nSince all the lobster rolls we sampled before Neptune were cold, we decided to get the warm lobster roll with fries. Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed. It wasn't even that we were lobstered out or maybe we were? There was definitely a lot of huge, fresh lobster chunks but not any more so than on the ones we had tried at the other spots. Meanwhile, this roll was practically double the price! I also think the lobster could have used a pinch of salt. The roll was also a tad soggy. The fries were solid, though!\\n\\nThe scallops that we ordered here are THE BEST THAT I'VE EVER HAD. These babies were monstrous -- plump, seared and seasoned to perfection. This dish  comes with d'anjou pear butter, duck confit, brussel sprouts and Maytag blue. Seemingly an odd combination of rather complex ingredients but everything worked perfectly! It was the ultimate flavor explosion. The brussel sprouts were roasted perfectly. The pear butter was very mild but welcome -- I soaked the brussel sprouts and scallops in it. The duck confit was salty, rich and flavorful. We didn't get the blue cheese on our dish that it was supposed to come with, but it was fine nonetheless. I actually think the flavor of it would have been too sharp if there was more than a sprinkling. \\n\\nThe meal was definitely not cheap but I can't get over the amazing oysters and scallops. I most definitely will be back to Neptune the next time that I am back in Boston -- probably go on an oyster run while waiting it out!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Had to wait 4 hours for a party of 6.

Once we were seated our waiter wished our friend a happy birthday and took our drink orders. He brought out our waters with some bread, and gave us the specials and recommendations.

I had to bump it down a star because the waiter asked if by medium well I meant if I wanted it a little pink in the middle and I said yes, but there was no pink in my steak at all when I cut into it. The heaping pile of mashed potatoes was great! But I had to bump this down another half a star because the house vegetables this dish came with came with a strong overwhelming taste of lemon that I couldn't taste anything else.\\n\\n- Honey brined pork tenderloin (4.5/5): So delicious! The pork was soft, juicy, and cooked to perfection. The house mustard was strong, so be generous when you're dipping your pork into the marmalade and sauces. I'm usually not a fan of mixing my sweets with my salty foods, but this was an exception! Definitely recommend this dish.\\n\\n- Scallops with butternut squash risotto: I can't rate this dish because I didn't get to try the risotto, but the scallops were incredible!

One of their pipes was dripping.. probably from condensation, but poor construction to have that right over where you sit. There were 4 young hostesses. I don't know what kind of restaurant needs 4.. maybe they had been displaced from the downtown location but it seemed absurd. \\nWhen we walked into the restaurant we saw open seats on the patio but still had to wait.. once we were seated on the patio, we saw why.. one server was covering the whole thing. We were given food menus but not the drink one, which the server brought over and then immediately asked what we wanted to drink. Obviously we're going to need to look, my friend had never been there before. We did put in our food order however since we were afraid it would be a while before he came back. We were right. He didn't come back for drink orders so we just stuck with water. We also added a side of vampire fries. Our meal came out.. food was fine.. nothing to write home about. Fries were decent but shouldn't be served on a large flat plate.. presentation made it look like there were a whole 4 fries on the plate. When they brought out the check we immediately paid.. same deal.. worried about them not coming back. \\nFood was fine. Service sub par.. but I don't necessarily think it was the servers fault.. probably not well staffed that day.. and definitely did not need 4 hostesses. Just odd.

The mystery surrounding the exterior (no sign, just a lion's head knocker on the front door) had me intrigued to see what was inside. Was it a speakeasy? Was it a classy AF environment only to be enjoyed by those who decided to walk in? Was it going to be a seductive atmosphere with all this allure?\\n\\nThe answer to all of these questions: it wants to be, but it fails (to be it gently). It has elements of a speakeasy, but there's a huge flatscreen behind the bar which screamed sports bar. The cocktail offerings screamed upscale, but they tasted mediocre. The environment had the lighting and the furniture to be seductive, but with classic rock playing throughout the restaurant and an eyesore of a metal coat rack along the back wall, I was left wanting to put my coat back and run away.\\n\\nI've come here twice already to make sure I wasn't being a jerk, and both times I was disappointed. On each occasion, I came for drinks to keep it simple and less expensive if I wasn't vining with the environment. My strategy proved more successful than Lion's Tail's concept. I ordered The Nog off their menu which is illustrated like something out of a steampunk dream (they got an extra star from me because of that).\\n\\nLike our parents told us: don't judge a book by its cover. In this case, I judged it by its illustrations and will have to apologize to my parents later for not taking their advice.\\n\\nWith there being a minimal amount of guests on both nights I went, I was shocked as to how long it for me to get my drink, and the drink I received was only okay. The presentation was on point - like most things at Lion's Tail - but it lacked a lot of everything. It felt light on the tongue, almost watered down. The flavors were just as light, and even I struggled to find them as it passed over my tongue.\\n\\nWith drinks being lackluster on two out of two occasions, I don't foresee myself going back for food...or ever. I wish them luck, I guess? But it's not luck they need. They need direction and a solid concept, and they're far from figuring that out."},{"name":"Bootleg Special","address":"400 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Millennial staff who appeared too cool and felt begrudged having to wait on us.

Apparently, I am not the only one with this idea! I stopped into Vanbarry's to watch some of the college basketball and grab lunch. The inside dining area was nearly empty, with only a few patrons at the bar. Everyone was sitting outside on this beautiful day and watch the world drive by Lake Jennie Jewel. A waitress welcomed me and told me that I could sit anywhere I like. Friends of mine have visited here, and they were really happy with the food and service they received. And with the late lunch crowd here, this looks like a popular place to go on a weekend. So that should tell you that Vanbarry's is doing something good.\\nThis was my first visit here. I picked a table across from a row of televisions hanging above the patio tables, and ordered a Sam Adams FreshAsHelle Draft and ordered The Dizzy Pig ($9.35). A cheeseburger served on either a kaiser bun or pretzel bun, The Dizzy Pig comes with bacon and mushrooms. I also asked for lettuce and tomato, as well as french  fries. \\nMy server brought out my draft beer along with a jar of kosher deli style sliced pickles. These are good as is!  \\nMy Dizzy Pig, cooked medium, was delicious.  A burger about as good, if not better, than some of the restaurants I have been to.\\nThe next time I visit here, I will have to try one of the appetizers.

And there is also a full liquor bar featuring some house drinks and specials throughout the day.\\nThe dining area both inside and outside is very clean, as well as the bathrooms. Televisions are all around, so there should be a game on that you would like to watch.\\nService is fast and friendly. But it seemed like my waitress was either having an off day, or figured that since I was dining alone, she would not get much of a tip. When I have a server laughing and talking with patrons at other tables, but acts like it is an effort to ask me if I would like anything else, it makes me feel like my business is not wanted there. \\nOther than the experience with the waitress, the food was great.

This place was hyped very much by several so maybe my less than stellar review of it may be due to it being overhyped. It's the definition of a dive restaurant which I like. It is very small. I ordered the Therm burger and my friend ordered the therminator.  They are big. But it's kinda more of a marketing ploy. It's difficult to eat and the taste was lacking. Service was so so my party of five never could get a straight awnser on their beer selection or a recommendation. If your looking for a really big hamburger with a much of odd toppings this place is for you. If you want something that tastes very good I would pass."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I think the fact that we went on a rainy night increased our chances for getting a table for 5 without much wait on a friday.  It was crowded, but we only waited a few minutes to sit down.  I take this as something of a feat from other yelp reviews.\\n\\nOn to the food, the consensus was mostly delicious and a little pricey, but worth going back for a special occasion.  The extensive raw bar was delightfully fresh and well-priced, a definite treat.  The clam chowder was good - much lighter and more complex than the usual thick and hearty style, but perhaps not worth the $11 price tag.  Another appetizer, the grilled squid over polenta, looked fantastic and could serve as a main entree if you're not too hungry.\\n\\nThe trout on the menu right now is wonderful - crispy corn crust, generous portion of perfectly cooked fish, and a light but sweet blueberry sauce as a contrast, enhancing the asparagus and whipped parsnip accompaniments, as well as crab hush puppies.  \\n\\nThe cioppino looked decent, although being from San Francisco, I have very high standards, and a friend who got the lobster roll (not surprisingly) raved.  I was sad the lobster clam bake was priced so high ($55!), way out of my range for a casual dinner with friends.\\n\\nNice wine list, good beers, and a pleasant experience.  The food wasn't mind-blowing, but it was incredibly fresh and well-made, and the prices were a little higher than expected, but not a complete rip-off.  Definitely a worthy option for high quality seafood, just keep your expectations reasonable and your wallet stacked."},{"name":"Stretch the Noodle","address":"232 SW Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The noodle is freshly stretched in front of you how amazing is that.

Thankfully one of the tables by the fireplace opened up and we were able to take a seat.\\n\\nFor food, we tried a couple different dishes:\\n\\nSausage pizza (4 stars): This pizza was a little bit too thin of crust for me and was burnt, but the housemade sausage was extremely tasty and was liberally distributed throughout.\\n\\nTuna tartare (5 stars): Wow, this was an impressive dish. The amount of flavor they packed into it was quite astounding. Definitely a nice, refreshing appetizer worth trying.\\n\\nMacaroni and cheese (5 stars): I am not usually one to indulge in a dish like this, but this version was worth it. The cheese was super tasty and the noodles were cooked perfectly with a nice helping of toasted bread crumbs on top for texture.\\n\\nPork belly (5 stars): This dish was also a surprise as the meat was so tender and flavorful. Sometimes when you get pork belly it can be chewy, but this almost melted like butter in your mouth.\\n\\nI also tried a couple drinks:\\n\\nCucumber cocktail (3 stars): This cocktail was good and refreshing, but I was hoping that there would be a bit more ginger flavor coming through.\\n\\nMoscow Mule (2 stars): I don't know what happened with this drink, but I was not a huge fan of it as the ginger beer they used did not impart much flavor--which may explain the lack of ginger in the first drink as well.\\n\\nOverall, the food here was very impressive and the setting is quite magnificent.

The dressing on the salad with the Gorgonzola cheese...wow so good!  My fianc√© got the halibut special and I went for the pork chop dish which I have to say was one of the best pork chops I've ever had.  First off the dish is huge they certainly do not skimp on the portions on that dish. It came with 2 pork chops, green beans and an awesome white cheddar Mac n cheese.  The honey mustard sauce on the pork chops was bomb!!  I had to have a little help to make it through and luckily my fianc√© has a bigger appetite than me to lend a hand.\\n\\nUnfortunately we couldn't breathe to be able to order dessert but we had a great time and our waiter Mike C was awesome!

($6.50)\\n\\nAs my sandwich was prepared I perused the wall art.  I especially liked the wood panel painting on the west wall.  It had Animal Farm-type characters, with toothy smiles, hoisting steins of something good.\\n\\nEverything about the sandwich was perfect.   I especially loved the thick (olive?) spread and the greens steeped in the compelling balsamic vinegar dressing.\\n\\nWhat was a cool touch was this little wrapping of paper that I found underneath my sandwich when I was done.

Even the staff in these areas are imported directly from those countries. So when the nice English bloke was our waiter at Rose & Crown pub (in the United Kingdom area of Epcot), coupled with the authentic food with excellent vegetarian options, it only enhanced our dinner experience.\\n\\nAs I said, the vegetarian (vegan in fact) options are outstanding. The classic dish at an English pub is fish and chips. They've got a vegan version of that. Feeling more adventurous and have never had Bangers and Mash (because bangers are sausage), well get ready to get it on with the vegan bangers and mash!\\n\\nThat's what I did and this was no run of the mill veggie sausage from the frozen section...take a look at my picture...it looked beyond authentic and the taste was awesome! They even served it up with a vegetarian gravy which was super tasty. This dish really filled me up.\\n\\nOur kid had the vegan fish and chips. (We made him try a chip with malt vinegar on it and although his 10 year old sensibility didn't quite allow him to appreciate that, me and his mother sure enjoyed the face he made while eating it. He love the Gardein fish it was made with. This is the same thing you can get in the frozen section of any Target and most supermarkets, however they actually deep fried them which made them much crunchier and more authentic than what we typically do at home (baking them.) He loved it.\\n\\nWe also had a side of mushy peas which was delicious, and a side of roasted carrots which typically come with another dish, and which we also enjoyed\\n\\nIt was great that they could do the vegan options as part of the kids meals as sometimes restaurants will not allow that kind of substitution when ordering from the kids menu.\\n\\nOh and of course there is the English beer...you can't have an authentic British pub experience without a pint...I had a cream ale which was all head when they brought it to me...it settled down quickly and though not served warm-warm-is like in the UK, it still was the perfect compliment to this meal.\\n\\nI'll be craving a future experience at Rose & Crown Pub and praying they open one up here in Southern California."},{"name":"The Sound Table","address":"483 Edgewood Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"If I ate anything I don't remember because the DJs were so friggin' good.

It approximates the vibe of the famous San Fran landmark for oysters.   So I get the cloned appreciation to Neptune.  The oysters being shucked and featured next to the glass window case, tempts one to come in and enjoy no doubt.     After traveling to Boston for 8 years or so, IMO, the seafood is fresh here  but is not the best preparation of seafood-- very San Francisco and North End recipes and therefore average.  Maybe I'm too spoiled living in SoCal where seafood is not only fresh but is prepared in a variety of inventive and/or multi-cultural kitchens that the preparations at Neptune become easily recognizable as generic blah from San Fran Fisherman's Wharf/North Beach and Boston's North End.    The lobster roll is verifiably good, there are many others in Boston prepared similarly-- if you have sampled many lobster roll spots in the city.  If this is your first visit, I wouldn't wait 2 hours for a lobster roll which is often the case here. \\n\\nI did enjoy (mucho) the oysters-- crisp,  COLD, juicy and clean tasting, with variations of brine and sweet (depending on the kind you get).  And they get kumamotos now from WA state. \\n\\nService was super attentive (plus one star)  and helpful since I sat at the bar for the two times I went.  \\n\\nVisits: 2 and more -- I want to try the razor clams when they have it.\\n\\nTip: There's almost always a line, like that famous oyster joint in San Fran; you may end up sharing a table with others so I'd get a spot at the bar."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"HUGE lobster roll.....itty bitty restaurant!

For such a cosmopolitan area as Orlando, one would expect better quality independent restaurants. I have eaten at several Chinese Buffets on the Mexican Border that would put Orlando's offerings to shame. Crazy Buffet is the lowest of the low. Those who equate a cheap fountain entrance and lines of buffet offerings with quality and/or price worthiness will love Crazy Buffet. Yes, you can \\"fill your gut,\\" but less expensive and better quality can be found at Costco's sample stations. \\n    The problem is food quality and flavor. The first is poor due to leftovers from lunch served for dinner, and the kitchen's inability to adequately prepare the pre-cooked, pre-prepared, and pre-packaged food from an unknown purveyor. \\nThen, for the flavor....(and over powering odor from the steam table.) It is not putrid, but is unlike any associated with Chinese cuisine. Neither management nor cooks could not possibly be verifying the food they are selling. (Or, are they? Or, do they care)\\n   In a lifetime of eating at Chinese Buffets, I make the following observations:\\n1.  Someone wants to open a Chinese Buffet in one of the 50 states.\\n2.  They find a Chinese financier/consultant.\\n3.  This person (remarkably) knows of one for sale that is relatively new, and making a great profit.\\n4. He convinces the aspiring restauranteur to buy. He does and embarks on a training time provided by the consultant. Weeks pass and the consultant leaves. Sales remain high as does the food quality. \\n5.  Soon, with the inevitable employee turnover, costs for food and previously over reported sales and underreported costs the new owner cuts service, food quantity and quality. \\n 6. The result is a restaurant like Crazy Buffet. \\n\\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!!"},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Pains me to leave this review, as our first visit here was actually quite good.

Served with an over easy eggs and an incredible aioli it was an unnecessary dish for my meal that I was still so happy to order. My main was the Duck...Duck...Steak!. Duck fat confit potatoes served in a spicy onion cream covered in a sunny duck egg, served alongside a skewer of medium rare steak. Rich and decadent, and the sauce leaves you wanting to lick the plate. Then came the Banana Walnut Bread With Seared Foie Gras.

The outside does not stand out too much from other nearby spots with a few tables lined along the corner restaurant. Inside the space has that hip brunch vibe, but on a larger scale than I'm used to. Two areas draw your focus, the large bar and the open kitchen. I loved the addition of ladder to the bar as the shelf goes up to the top of the high ceilings. In terms of music they were bumping 90s dance music, which was a bit much for Monday morning, but don't tell that to the staff.\\nCrowd: Extremely busy on a Monday for brunch, so I assume the line is out the door on the weekends.\\nService: I was well taken care of my entire visit.

The bar is small with big numbers attached to average tasting cocktails. The stories and process behind the cocktails are more impressive than the taste.

We made a reservation and requested a window seat. We arrived 10min prior to our reservation and they informed us it would be a 35-40min wait for a window seat. We opted for a regular table as she said it would only be a min. We waited about 25min and were surprised with a window table. The table also had a nice Happy Birthday greeting on it. Our server came over and introduced himself and was very helpful with recommendations. We started off with the calamari appetizer, it had a very flavorful sauce and wasn't to heavy. Then our main course came. All had a very nice presentation, the lamb came out very rare, we ordered medium but were able to have to cooked a little more. I ordered the shrimp carbonara. The sauce had a great flavor and I was shocked by the large portion. The shrimp on the other hand lacked flavor and had a char to it that I wasn't a fan of. Overall everyone has pretty happy with their meals. They brought out a special dessert for my mom with a candle which was nice. I would say our server was a 10/10.

Our waiters name was ___ but I kept calling him Justin LOL! He said he would be Justin for us :-) Very nice and very sweet to treat a lady that is tipsy with mimosas.

Go figure\\n\\nFOOD: The food is always delicious and satisfying. I usually get the French toast with the caramelized bananas, but today I just didn't want that much food. I ordered the half French toast (it was plenty) and eggs and bacon. Along with the fresh bread/muffins and jam, jelly, and butter, I was very full. Everything tasted great. The menu selection isn't very unique, but you can never go wrong with the basics either. The Grand Mimosas are definitely the way to go. It has a shot of grand manier in it, and if you haven't tried it, today is the day for you to do so. Thank me and give me a compliment on my Yelp page :-)  \\n\\nPARKING: The parking situation is critical. If you arrive too late for valet, you will be searching for parking forever. This is a busy little area in Virginia Highlands and there is limited parking, even if you are willing to pay! Its just so close to a residential area so there just isn't many parking lots. I was able to make several loops around the block and came back and the valet did have spots available #Winning\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: It is busy, trendy and always packed with young adults, birthday parties, and dates. If you don't like sitting close to other people eating, this place isn't for you. Its very intimate and also there isn't much walking space. You will bump a table or two as you navigate within the restaurant. The thing is nobody really cares. The mimosas are gong and the laughs are on high, its a fun place to be on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon for brunch. You might even catch a celebrity or two in the establishment.

I was especially grateful for that option--since we did end up sitting in the outdoor area--because the patio seating was covered with a tarp, and it was a super windy day!\\n\\nWe hit up PSB after a trip to the nearby Waffle Window--we basically trekked through Portland on a self-planned breakfast tout--so we weren't starving, but we weren't full. My friend said that the line here can get notoriously long, but I can see why--even if you order, you may not find a place to sit if people are still eating. This isn't a place where you can take your sweet old time eating and talking because there are people always waiting for your seats, but I was just happy that this caf√©-like eatery did have seating options.\\n\\nI would say we waited in line for about 45 minutes (or maybe less), but the time passed pretty quickly. Plus, all that time in line gave us time to decide what we wanted to order. My two friends had been to PSB before, but this was my first time.\\n\\nI had originally decided on \\"The Chatfield,\\" but once I saw the description for the \\"Earl's Blue Ribbon Special\\"--and I didn't know how long that would be featured--I changed up my order to get that instead. Note: Pay attention to the specials board (which you'll see once you hit the entrance), because you might end up like me and changing your order to get something that's a limited-time offer! But do see what PSB is serving as a special because it might be gone the next time you're there!\\n\\nYou order from the counter, pay, get a number and wait for your food to be brought out. After you're finished eating, you buss your own table and clean up for the hungry customers who are waiting. Simple as that.\\n\\nThough my friend said she prefers the biscuits from Salem's Word of Mouth breakfast place--one of my FAVORITE restaurants--I still really liked the biscuits at PSB. Here's what we got, and I can assure you, I'm SO coming back to this place the next time I'm in Portland:\\n\\n\\"Earl's Blue Ribbon Special\\": Getting this special (and I'm not sure how long it was featured for) was worth every single bite (and every extra minute on that exercise bike). This sandwich sort of reminded me of a Monte Cristo, since it featured a savory blend of ham and swiss and a slightly sweet flavor from the honey mustard (I swapped out the sauce that was featured for honey mustard instead ... definitely recommend doing that). This was basically a glorified fried chicken sandwich because the fried chicken was STUFFED with the ham and Swiss (and THEN fried), so you get that tender ham and melted cheese oozing out of each bite of chicken. And the chicken's covered in that delicious honey mustard, in between pieces of a fresh, warm, buttery biscuit. This sandwich was amazing; one of the bests I've ever had. I like biscuit sandwiches in general, but this one just blew me away! I really liked each of its components and thought the flavors complemented very well. I'm not sure if I'll ever see this sando again, since it was a special, but PSB, please bring back Earl's ... or make it a part of the permanent menu! It's a winner!\\n\\n\\"The Reggie Deluxe\\": My friend's BF got this sandwich so I could try a piece (since I didn't end up getting this ... OR the Chatfield). It featured fried chicken, bacon and cheese topped with gravy and an egg (basically \\"The Reggie\\" topped with an egg). The gravy was flavorful and thick--always a must when it comes to gravy, as I prefer thick gravy over runny gravy--and the bacon was cooked nicely (not as crispy as I would want, but definitely not soggy). The egg and melted cheese gave this sandwich added flavor and texture. This sando (besides \\"The Reggie\\" is one of the more popular dishes, from what I could tell, and I'd love to get it on my next visit!\\n\\n\\"Shrimp-N-Grits\\": My friend had ordered \\"The Reggie\\" before, but since we were planning to go to Word of Mouth the next day for breakfast, she decided to steer clear of biscuits altogether and get something completely different. She ordered this Southern classic entr√©e, which featured Pacific caught shrimp saut√©ed in garlic, green onions, mushrooms and bacon, served over a bed of Ayers creek grits. I've only had grits once--and my friend never had grits prior to this meal--but her dish was a WINNER and I would highly recommend it (I got to try some). The mushroom-to-shrimp ratio was definitely like ... 6:1 (there were a LOT more mushrooms than shrimp on her plate), but my friend loves mushrooms so she didn't mind. I got to taste one of the shrimps and a creamy spoonful of grits and both were really flavorful. The shrimp wasn't as small as I thought it would be, which is a bonus, and I could definitely savor that garlic flavor. The grits, though, were the highlight of the dish for me. They were buttery and you could taste the chunks of bacon throughout."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The hostess has never had a happy moment in her life like Jesus Christ I have never experienced such negative treatment in my life!!\\n\\nHer Grey streak in her hair is probably from all the souls she's sucked with her depressing and rude ways.

You walk up the stairs and can sit on the spacious covered outdoor patio or at one of the few seats inside.  They are open late, and often have live music events.  If you aren't into Kava you can have a coffee or tea instead.  Kava is not for everyone.  If you are pregnant, have liver or kidney issues you shouldn't drink it.  Also, they recommend not mixing Kava with alcohol.  The mixture is not meant to be slipped slowly. I chugged mine.  It is thick, and muddy in texture.  The taste is medicinal and bitter.  They have flavorings you can add to the mixture to make it more palatable, but I just had it straight. They have three different types of Kava of different strengths to choose from.  Also they have it in a margarita type mix.  They have a flight of Kava that you can purchase so you can try each one.  Each one definitely has a different taste and physical affect.  For the first few minutes your tongue and mouth will tingle as you get used to the Kava. For each person the effects they said are different, but I could feel my body and mind relax and become clearer.  It was the end of a long and stressful day, and the Kava definitely wiped that all away.  Matt was working the bar and incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.

I have to admit, it's been quite a few years since I was last here and things have changed a bit since my last visit.  Previously you were requested to remove your shoes when walking on the carpets.  Well it seems the oriental carpets are gone and a rather ugly gray carpet has taken its place.  The pillows that you can sit on, on the floor for your meal, are also gone and have been replaced with red velvet chairs.  The ceiling, which I recall was lavished with flowing fabric, has become a bit tattered in areas.  But beyond these aesthetic observations, the reason I went here was for the food and belly dancer show.  In these two respects, Imperial Fez did not disappoint.  The service was warm, gracious and even nicer than I recall.  On that same note, the food even better than I recall too.  I had the baked lamb m'hammer paprika and it was truly excellent... the lamb was well cooked and the sauce was just delicious.

That's why we come here -- the food. We haven't ordered something that didn't turn out delicious.\\n\\nBut let's start with the beginning... Each time we've come here (twice with a reservation, once without), we've had an uncomfortable wait at the hostess station. I'm not sure what it is, but each time it was not crowded at all, we were the only ones being waited on, yet the hosting staff seems to make a big deal each time about where to seat us. Like it's something they're figuring out for the first time. Every single time we come. The hosting staff, while pleasant, never seem to make much eye contact nor engage in any chit-chat while they're furiously figuring out their seating chart.\\n\\nSeating and the environment is very nice, either inside (dark and luxurious, with high ceilings) or out (although your view is limited to a parking lot). There aren't any really bad tables, although we prefer the booths.\\n\\nWaitstaff has always been friendly and mostly attentive. Last night was pretty characteristic of our experience... Initial attentiveness that drops off precipitously as the night wears on and new covers come in. After our food came, we saw our waitress more than half-way through our meal asking whether our meals were to our liking. I expect a waitress to ask that question after the first bite or two -- not halfway through your meal. \\n\\nMy \\"duck steak\\" was more medium well than medium, dry and not at all juicy like a properly cooked duck steak should be. But by the time I could complain about it, I had no choice to eat it because I would've been sitting there watching my partner eat her properly done regular steak. \\n\\nAs the evening wore on, so did the wait times. It devolved from a nicely choreographed dinner into a, \\"please let this be our dessert!\\" We literally waited 15 minutes from when we ordered our dessert until the single plate of a chocolate cake came out. We watched as fellow diners, who came in nearly 30 minutes after we did, finished their entrees. \\n\\nThis location has now been open for some time, so these really shouldn't be \\"growing pains\\" any longer. We expect service and food to be on par with what they're charging (like $13 for a carrot salad). I can safely say that after three times coming here, neither is up to snuff. When the kitchen starts getting bogged down leaving your earlier diners waiting 15 minutes for a piece of cake, something is terribly wrong there. \\n\\nI hope the management works on these issues, because the food -- when it's cooked properly -- is very good and delicious.

He didn't seem like he wanted to be there and went outside to smoke on the patio while we were eating, gross. \\nWhile we waited for our food, another guy came walking from the back im assuming and I wish i was exaggerating, but he THREW a water cup on our table. Some of it spilled on the table and he didn't even bother to ask if we were doing okay. \\nThe Naan follows afterwards and it was burnt on the bottom, it was completely black. I would've rather eaten paper. I ordered tikka and saag and the chicken in the tikka had such a horrible wild like taste. The saag tasted like it was burnt as well. \\n\\nIn addition the parking situation was HORRENDOUS. I had to walk about 10 blocks just to eat this trash.\\n\\nI cannot believe how many good reviews this place had. I either have high expectations or everyone else has low standards. I will not return here or waste my money on this trashy so called \\"restaurant.\\" It was dirty, service was disappointing, and the price was too high based on the quality of the food and service I received. I regret going here and I will continue to take my business down the street to Clay Pit"},{"name":"Aztec Willie's Taqueria","address":"1501 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"so basically i just wanna say that this spot has the best ceviche in town!!  The music is always entertaining and the bartenders are hella cool."},{"name":"Taqueria Los Rayos","address":"3473 Clairmont Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Like Taqueria El Rey Del Taco, Taqueria Los Rayos is a good late night option for authentic and inexpensive Mexican food on Buford Highway. Unlike El Rey, Los Rayos is located deeper ITP (inside the perimeter) near Buford Highway and Clairmont Road. While the business address is on Clairmont, the restaurant actually has two entrances, one on Buford and one on Clairmont.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review, Los Rayos' business hours are as follows:\\n\\nMonday to Thursday - 9am to 1am\\nFriday - 9am to 4am\\nSaturday - 9am to 5am\\nSunday - 9am to 3am\\n\\nLike popular El Taco Veloz up the road, Los Rayos has drive-thru service. Inside, the restaurant has eight four or five-top tables, three two-tops, and a bar that seats eight for an approximate comfortable seating capacity of 50 customers. There's also a fanned, covered patio outside featuring a half-dozen circular tables. Parking isn't an issue as there's plenty of space.\\n\\nThis is very much a casual, no-frills Mexican joint. There's a big TV at the bar and a smaller one facing a dining area off to the side. The small restrooms are clean. You can place and pick up your order at the counter or you can sit down for table service.\\n\\nLos Rayos specializes in their version of al pastor, which is marinated and sauteed pork *and* steak (in many cases, al pastor is prepared only with pork). It, along with other meat options, are offered in taco, burrito, platter, and torta (sandwich) form. Along with al pastor, meat choices include:\\n\\nBistec - steak\\nChorizo - Mexican sausage\\nSuadero - \\"flat meat\\" (thin slice cut between belly and leg)\\nPollo - chicken\\nCabeza - cow's cheek\\nLengua - cow's tongue\\nBarbacoa - made with goat here\\nCarnitas - pork\\nTripa - pork chitlins (intestines/bowels)\\n\\nTacos run from $1.75 to $1.95 each, quesadillas $3.00 to $4.50 each, burritos $4.50 each, tortas $5.00 to $5.50 each, special plates $9.00 each, and fajitas $9.95 each. Seafood is offered Friday through Sunday and includes items such as campechana (shrimp cocktail) and ceviche made with red snapper and lemon juice.\\n\\nThe tacos look great. Each is served with two filling corn tortillas. After all the juices and sauces soak into the tortillas, one tortilla isn't strong enough to hold a single taco together. Each taco comes with chopped cilantro and white onion. Marinated onions and a lime wedge are served on the side.\\n\\nTaste-wise, I think the tacos are OK. I'm not a huge fan of the somewhat dense tortillas and I think some of the meats could be seasoned better, but that's what the salsas are for. The carnitas (pulled pork) are partially chewy and dry. Lengua (tongue) is probably my favorite and the bistec (steak) is satisfying. The lengua texture is smooth and soft. Cabeza (cheek) isn't bad, though it's a bit rubbery and bland. Tripa has an expectedly unpleasant flavor/odor. I like tripe, but not in this form. Overall, the ingredients seem sufficiently fresh.\\n\\nThere are two salsas, one red and one green, available in squeeze bottles. Both salsas are tasty. I prefer the green salsa. It's milder in both spiciness and tanginess.\\n\\nI've also tried the al pastor special plate. The specials are served on metal plates that are pretty much like hot skillets. Corn tortillas serve as the base and are topped with bacon, melted cheese, fresh tomato, avocado, and white onion slices, a whole cooked jalapeno, and the meat of your choice. Additionally, each plate comes with a side of hot corn tortillas (wrapped in foil) and lime.\\n\\nWhile it looks terrific, the al pastor special is simply too heavy and greasy. It's delicious for several bites, but the excessive oil makes it a difficult entree to finish. The savory yet fatty bits of bacon only exacerbate the issue. The extra tortillas aren't really needed for this dish unless they're intended to sop up the fat.\\n\\nTry a Mexican beverage with your meal. The horchata (sweet rice drink) is good and isn't overly sweet nor chalky. They've also got juices (e.g. jamaica - hibiscus) and Jarritos Mexican soda.\\n\\nService is fine."},{"name":"Shine Distillery & Grill","address":"4232 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This a brand new place on North Williams.

At this point I've probably had just about every sandwich on the menu. I tend to stick with the same three most of the time now. The three are: #1 Dac Biet, #5 grilled beef, #4 grilled pork. \\n\\nThe #1 Dac Biet is the quintessential banh mi, you can find it at any banh mi shop in town, but rarely will you find it for $4.25. Although the price has climbed in the past few years, it is still a steal, especially considering it is in a new building, on the PSU campus, in downtown. The #1, since it is mostly made of processed foods, keeps and reheats the best. If I am getting a sandwich for later, which I will most likely need to reheat, this is the one I get with the veggies on the outside. \\n\\nIf I am getting a sandwich to eat on the spot, it will either be the grilled beef or the grilled pork. You can't go wrong with either, and due to the marinade, they have a fairly similar flavor profile. \\n\\nOne sandwich is never really enough, two is a little too much.

I canvassed friends across social media in advance, laying up my situation and asking, \\"If you were in town for only one meal, where would you go?\\" A hefty order, I understand. But along with top marks from a certain crowd-sourced review site I happen to hold in high esteem, the majority of my peers recommended Neptune Oyster. I was not led astray.\\n\\nEven with a meeting that ran long, my driver hitting some traffic on the way into town (business obligations were actually 45 minutes outside the city), and a short wait for a seat upon arriving, I made it happen. I sat at the long, packed bar by myself, spent a solid half-hour enjoying some of Neptune Oyster's most popular menu items, threw back a couple Massachusetts beers (I see you, Cape Ann Fisherman's Brew), and chatted up the bartender/waitress about Boston in general, all with time to spare before my short shuttle flight back home.\\n\\nI basically Bourdained the shit outta this place.\\n\\nSeriously, if you find yourself in the same situation, Neptune Oyster is a perfect place to grab a bite by yourself. The aforementioned bar takes up half the room (and the room is small to begin with), so requesting a single stool seems pretty standard. \\n\\nThe service was delightful, attentive, and on point. When I asked if I should get my Maine Lobster Roll hot or cold, I was immediately told hot, without a shred of doubt.\\n\\nWhat my server failed to mention was that this was easily the biggest lobster roll on the planet. Even at $27, you're totally getting your money's worth - just ginormous chunks of hot lobster, with a simple coating of butter (I could've gone with more of a dousing, but maybe that's just me), on a lightly toasted roll. We're talkin' a two-hander here. Not counting the giant heaping of fries that comes with it. Maybe not the absolute best lobster roll I've ever had, but still very much up there, and without question, the most monstrous.\\n\\nI also ordered the Wellfleet Clam Chowder because, like the lobster roll, this seemed like the right move while in New England. I typically like my clam chowder a little thicker, but the flavor here was great, and didn't warrant the extra cream. The potatoes, however, were noticeably undercooked.\\n\\nMinor nitpicking aside (and that's all that it is, because this place is fantastic), Neptune Oyster is seafood central for all the right reasons. The tiny restaurant is bustling, the tiled walls and pressed-tin ceilings possess old-school charm, the staff is friendly and convincing, the food is fresh and generously portioned, and it's all of a ten minute taxi ride from Logan.

Ridiculous. Two slices of tomato and they wanted $1.79! Ha! I was like there is no way I'm paying that much. So they agreed to 80c. I can't say it's their fault, clearly the whole place is disorganized and this is a management issue. How is it possible that it took 15 mins to slip together a pre-cooked egg sandwich with 4 staff (and 3 customers)? You tell me.

We even had several birthday celebrations there. For some reason, they decided to switch from cafeteria-style to table service. This wouldn't have been a bad change, except for two things:\\n\\n1. It's really slow. We've gone at least a dozen times since the change, on various days, and at different times, and every time the same thing: it takes forever to get your menu, then an eternity to place your order, then too long to get your food. It wouldn't be terrible if they at least tried to keep your drink from getting empty, but most of the time you just want to leave by the time they get around to asking if you'd like a second one. From what I can tell, the slowness is entirely because they shifted their food prep people to table service, instead of adding staff. \\n\\n2. They dramatically increased their prices. If the price increases had been accompanied by some - perhaps any - kind of improvement, it would have been warranted. But, because of #1, it feels more like an insult than anything else. At one point, there was a screed from the owner in the menu explaining that the price increases were because he was being forced to pay his employees more because of the min. wage increases. That didn't help - it made me, and perhaps others, feel like he was a bit of a jerk - and it was removed after a short time. That might have been the only good decision that's been made recently. \\n\\nOver the years, I have personally recommended Aztec Willie's to scores of people, and I should have left them a five star review here on Yelp. However, because of the above, I now either don't recommend them, or recommend to avoid them. \\n\\nIf you want to know what the place used to be like, I recommend that you instead go downtown to Maya's Taqueria.

As bad as it's appearance was, the texture was worse...chewy, tough. On top of all this, literally, the ginger scallion sauce was unbelievably, unpalatably, salty.

What's great is that there are not only solid New England craft offerings but also well-curated choices from all over the country and the world that you can sample in the form of flights. I ended up ordering two and especially enjoyed the Notch zwickel, the Medusa Polar Vortex stout, the Springdale Good n' You IPA, the Mast Landing Double Dry Hopped Tell Tale Pale Ale, and the Mast Landing Gunner's Daughter stout. If a particular draft offering was sold out, the bartenders were able to come up with exceptional suggestions for substitutions. \\n\\nAnd, of course, as any self-respecting gastropub should, there's a solid food offering here that's several notches above divey pub fare. Restaurant-quality, in fact. There should be something for everyone, whether burgers, poutine, fried chicken sliders, hummus, or even dessert.\\n\\nThe venue itself is gorgeous. It's very wood-paneled and high-ceilinged and feels like it used to be a bank lobby.

Warm, proactive, and just top-notch all around. With quality venues like the Ginger Man firing on all cylinders, there's no reason to patronize a stodgy Downtown Crossing-area rival when, in the latter case, certain bearded, middle-aged staff there act as if they're God's gift to mankind and feel like they can be total a**holes as a result."},{"name":"Fiesta Jalisco","address":"2700 Northland Plaza Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Great service good food.

The staff has always given me excellent service, and I want to give a big shout-out to Joseph for being just delightful last week and for helping me pick out an excellent cocktail. he was also honest with me when I was looking for something with a good amount of protein and suggested against one of the price your options I was looking at.\\n\\n\\nAtmosphere.\\n\\nI've sat outside for both of my visits, and the porch is a wonderful place to enjoy the evening. You're sitting right next to the beltline, so you get to watch some dogs and bicyclists and that's a fun small amount of entertainment.\\n\\nI haven't sat inside yet, but I'm looking forward to doing this at some point in the winter and feeling like I'm in a bar from the 60s.\\n\\nFood. \\n\\nI didn't expect this, but Golden Eagle rotates its menu. I visited in summer and then the menu was completely different when I visited again in the fall. to me, this speaks to their commitment to freshness, and it allows you to come back multiple times without getting bored.\\n\\nI appreciate how they have a modest-sized menu. The variety is good and I can't imagine you not being able to find something that you will enjoy, but not offering loads and loads of options shows how the focus is on their excellent cocktail menu.\\n\\nI've had a plate of fried chicken, which was an unexpected huge portion and very tasty. I had a spinach and artichoke dip in the summer which was okay. Last weekend I had the fried fish, which was very good. I'd love to come back sometime with a larger budget so that I could try more things, because the menu has some really fancy tasty options.\\n\\nDrinks. \\n\\nI haven't had anything that I've disliked here! Joseph helped me pick out the cocktail called future success last weekend. It has a refined and nuanced flavor and goes down very nicely. It's not overly sweet or herby but feels just right. I could also have so many of the grasshopper cocktails, but I ended up having just one. The minty creaminess is such a treat at the end of the meal.\\n\\nOther.\\n\\nRight now my least favorite part about Golden Eagle is getting into the parking lot, leaving the parking lot, and having to use the valet only parking option. Maybe they don't have the valet going all the time, but when I visited last weekend, all the spots had been coned off except for the ones used by the valet. The parking lot is so small, walking to my car would have taken less time than waiting for the valet to go get it. Maybe they use valet to keep logistics right, but for me it was just a nuisance.\\n\\nConclusion. \\n\\nAll in all, I love Golden Eagle and I can't wait to go back. I do recommend checking out the prices ahead of time so you know what you're getting into. This place presents itself more as a cocktail bar than a restaurant, but it can be both for you if you want it to be. I only ever have one or two drinks, and so having a good food menu is important to me.

It is aimed at local hipster types who clearly (as the owners have so eloquently pointed out) wouldn't have the funds to afford the furniture they sell - their patrons are simply there to shill out $5 so they can take an image to post to the 'gram. To be fair most of their customers probably didn't even know what mid-century furniture was until last year when this shop opened and their minds went crazy eyes all exploding with hearts and sh*t, bc white walls + wood + succulents... OMFG groundbreaking!! *eye roll* This shop is catering to a group who is trying so desperately hard to be cool that they don't even care about the subpar service or coffee. Why don't they care? Because we all know going to another coffee shop wouldn't be so grammable, and for these patrons it's all about aesthetics of their overly curated social media presence.\\n\\nI am a fan of the decor, but my interest stops there. The coffee has been mediocre despite having sourced their beans from \\"the best\\" places. On more than one occasion the drinks were made improperly to the point they weren't even able to be consumed. Clearly they didn't take the time to figure out how to best make the drinks before opening... which live and learn, that's fine. It takes time to get a business perfected and running smoothly. I understand shops have a learning curve and that things need to be worked out, etc. What I don't understand is the pretense. You're selling COFFEE and a couple pieces of random furniture (maybe). The responses of these owners to other Yelp reviews are hideous and down right embarrassing. This is a sad sad showing for Orlando small businesses.

Had a coupon for a steak and shake meal: doublesteakburger, fries, classic milkshake for $5.99. They wouldn't honor the coupon, though it expires 2 months from now; saying they didn't have the stuff for the meals anymore. Even though I recreated the meal by ordering everything a la carte. That made me go back and have to re-do my order, and the girl at the drive thru obviously hated that (bad attitude). Got my order and though I asked for no ketchup/mayo on my burger, it had them on there. I can't eat or even smell ketchup residue on my burger, it makes me nauseated, so its not like I can just wipe it off. I didn't notice until I had gotten the order home, and had fought my way through 5 o'clock traffic to get it home, and would've had to fight the same traffic for 30+ minutes to correct it. When I went to call them, no answer though I called constantly for 20 minutes. I ended up drinking my milkshake, eating my fries and tossing the burger. They also gave no receipt, without which I'd have trouble disputing the order. I won't be going back here. I typically go to Steak and Shake because they're more upscale than McDonalds so you can expect them not to put ketchup on when you ask, McDonalds ALWAYS does so I never go there anymore.

After being seated, the Chef sent out a complimentary order of potstickers that was fantastic. We started with two appetizers, Lobster Mac-n-Cheese and Point Judith Calamari, both were very good, but the Lobster Mac-n-Cheese with the bacon was absolutely wonderful with the creaminess of the cheese and tenderness of the lobster made for a fantastic start to our dinning experience. Not to make this review too long, but I chose the New Zealand Lamb Chops(6), which was slightly over cooked but the crispness of the seared Lamb actually made the dish taste good despite the inside temperature being more well than medium. My wife had the Oyster Rockefeller and our friends had the Surf & Surf and Blue Crab Crusted Grouper. The drinks were delicious.  \\"The Mule\\" was a table favorite. The only reason BF didn't get five stars was the ambience.

All of the wait staff seemed to be gathered around both of these tables  with their backs to us engaged in lively Spanish conversation.\\nAfter about 15 minutes, one member of the staff turned around and placed two glasses of water on the table.  He told us he'd be back with us momentarily and walked away.\\nThe rest of the staff continued their lively conversations.\\nEventually (probably another 10 minutes later) the same server who gave us water returned to the table with the aforementioned two women with an ice cream dessert that the restaurant was promoting that was served in a guacamole bowl.  Two other members of the wait staff joined him, breaking away from the conversation they had been in all this time, and began to speak (this time in English) about the awesomeness of this dessert.

Purely speaking from a chicken wing lovers' perspective, the three wing choices we tried were insanely good.  Easily the best I've had in I don't know how long.\\n\\nThe OG and the Spicy Pineapple varieties were both slightly coated in delicious moist sauces with a hint of heat.  I believe Sriracha sauce is one of the ingredients in the OG, but that was only a subtle component to these flavorful wings.  While the bits of pineapple mixed into the Spicy Pineapple wings gave them just the right amount of tang to pair with the spice.\\n\\nMy favorite was their Ranch on Fire variety which is a dry rub wing.  These had a decent kick and in my opinion leave Pluckers' Spicy Ranch wings in the dust.  These crisp wings were so moist and meaty on the inside and not overly greasy like Pluckers' version.  The ranch dust on them also has noticeably more heat with some staying power on the palate - which is a really good thing.\\n\\nAll the wings are prepared lollipop style which make them slightly easier to eat than the standard kind.

After a time-consuming research on restaurants that can ultimately satisfy my high standard for food quality and taste, we fix our eyes on Little Bird. Being a sister restaurant of Le Pigeon put us temporarily at ease.\\n\\nAfter a long day of roaming around the city, from downtown to Japanese Garden then back, we found ourselves footsore and exhausted. But the night just barely began.\\n\\nAnd our spirit lit up by the first sip of garlic soup with [some type of fish]. Weird as it sounded, this tiny cup of soup was all we can ask for - rich, creamy, with an immense taste of seafood elevated by a kick of garlic to finish.\\n\\nThe next highlight was lamb tartare. It is audacious and challenging to present lamb in its raw form, but Little Bird did it so elegantly that in a brief moment, I thought this might not be too hard to get from another street-corner bistro. However, this is probably the first time I got lamb tartare, I don't remember if I've ever seen it before.\\n\\nOur favorite dish of the night was foie gras. The chef transformed richness of foie gras into tenderness with full of flavor from the magic sauce, and paired it with French toast that easily put other brunch places in shame. You have to get it!\\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the fried chicken didn't surprise us on the same level as other dishes did.

It was fast, fresh, friendly and a good value. I just visited the restaurant for the first - and last - time. \\n\\nFirst, it's a very confusing set up. As you walk in here's some sort of bar. But you order your food to the left of that. Though there isn't a counter or sign or any other indication. I walked up to the counter where the food is on a steam table thinking I would order there. But then a not very helpful young woman said from behind me that I needed to order from here (with her tablet). Then I had to walk to the other end of the U to pay. \\n\\nWhich brings me to two - prices went way up. At the truck I paid $7.50 for a large bowl, it's $9.21 at the restaurant. For a bowl of rice and beans!\\n\\nThird, they didn't put enough sauce on the rice so it was tasteless and dry. And by the time I got back to my office the whole thing was cold. A problem I never had at the truck. \\n\\nI was happy to see Mighty Bowl succeeding to the point of having a brick and mortar shop. But they won't see me again unless they bring back the truck. \\n\\nUpdate from January 2019 - Despite my reservations (see above) I did visit Mighty Bowl again a few days ago and was pleased that they have simplified the ordering/paying process (it's all done at the register) and installed signs to help you get there. The food was also better and stayed a bit warmer.

It was accompanied by cherries and pears and roasted carrots. All of it was perfection, I mean perfection, nothing was left. Even the duck leg was outstanding. For dessert I had the cr√™pe Suzette.

It was great....warm, not windy...and proceeded to start us with the first of several rounds of drinks. From that second on....they had us!....their willingness to right a sticky situation with the reservation was only seconded by the outstanding food that Big Fin Serves.

Main courses were an 8oz perfectly prepared cold water lobster tail, my wife had the snapper with shrimp. OMG!....the food was a 12 on a scale of 10. But what was better than all of that was the way that this management team took a situation that was turning south (everyone was late for their reservations that night so things backed up a bit)....and made it into a 5 star occasion. A group of guys and gals came into the back bar and within 10 min...we were all toasting each other...and exchanging business cards, perhaps meeting again somewhere down the line. This is what makes a good evening a phenomenal evening....great food, great crowd....and superior management. As we live in Boca Raton, we do get to \\"O TOWN\\" often.

The queso was not your standard question, it's much thicker and served with tortillas. Still was good which tortilla chips but hard to eat. The nachos were amazing! They were very very small in terms of the number of chips, but they were good.

As we were about to find another restaurant nearby on yelp w a shorter wait time, I noticed only a few couples where hovering at the bar and there were about 3 couples who looked like they were almost done eating at the bar. You can bet we joined the hover party and swooped in for that 3rd couple's seating area.  The bar is full dining service and we waited a total of 20 minutes for our seats! \\nRunning off the adrenaline of the huge win of getting seated so soon after putting our names on the hour plus waitlist, we decided to split the korean fried chicken and lemon ricotta pancakes and each get a chocolate potato doughnut.\\nOur chocolate potato doughnuts came out first and that was the best thing we ate for this meal. My husband has this weird rule that he has to finish eating all savory items before digging into sweet items but I warned him that if he didn't eat his doughnut while it was still warm, he may regret it for the rest of his life. Lucky for him, he followed my advice and enjoyed his doughnut warm.\\nThe korean fried chicken came out next, the kimchi was super vinegar based and did not taste like traditional kimchi at all. I ended up abandoning it. The korean fried chicken is definitely overhyped and I'm not sure all the rice at the bottom of the bowl was fresh (old rice sticks together a certain way). The sauce on the korean fried chicken was mostly sweet, could've used more gochujang or korean pepper paste to balance that out. The beauty of korean fried chicken is that crunchy texture with juicy interior, obtained via the infamous double fry. This korean fried chicken was soggy, mostly from trapped moisture and heat between the rice and the fried egg on top. Definitely could've benefited from a double fry. \\n\\nThen we entered this long waiting period wondering what happened to the pancakes which we thought would come out first as it's listed as a smaller plate. The lemon flavor was lost by ricotta cheese. I loved the fresh blueberries on top and wished there was more blueberry syrup. \\n\\nThe waitress at the bar was very pleasant and very attentive and so I upgrade my 3 star review to 4 stars as I really appreciated her attention to service."},{"name":"Creole Kitchen","address":"1052 Mt Vernon Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place has some good food but is inconsistent.

We sent it back then the chef came out, with the steak re-plated (why was it re-plated if he was going to bring it back out? It even had fresh sides, and an additional side of asparagus. hmmm, several possibilities come to mind. Was that even the same steak? Was he going to serve it to someone else? Did he think we'd suddenly think our overcooked steak is perfect because of better plating?). He put his little keychain light on the steak and pointed to the dim lighting, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and even made another cut. I still felt it was overcooked, and told him so, but I knew at that point that it's now going to come out undercooked - the chef was saying things like \\"you can see that it's pink under this light. it's going to come out red n more rare in the middle if you want it less cooked....\\" so yea, he was kind of a jerk-off who got defensive when we didn't like how he cooked our medium steak medium-well, then brought us a medium-rare steak. At that point I was afraid to send it back again, would rather have an undercooked steak than overcooked (I actually prefer medium rare but I was sharing with my gf)\\n\\nIt wasn't just the color, cutting into the steak felt like it was well-done.

I felt like dancing  when I left this restaurant it was such a wonderful find!  Who would've thought that a random little chicken place off Chamblee Tucker Road would serve up such crispy, tender, chicken goodness?!  This is one place that lives up to the hype! \\n\\nThe menu is minimalist and quite simple.  It focuses around delicious Japanese-American fusion chicken.  This chicken is served up breaded (Ponko) or grilled, and they also offer a vegetarian pattie and tofu option as well.  All chicken is prepared with a sauce, and the choices include the original sweet sauce, a spicy sauce, and a barbecue sauce.  \\n\\nThe quick summary is that you have three primary options  - a salad, plate, or sandwich.   The plate includes five generous chicken tenders along with two sides, while the sandwich includes one side.  Sides include various kinds of french fries and rice, along with cole slaw, potato salad, and garden salad.  It's also worth noting that you can purchase the chicken \\"ala carte\\" by the number of pieces and simply purchase the sides separately.\\n\\nI opted for a plate of Ponko Tenders with the spicy sauce, along with Ponko french fries and a side salad.  Folks, these tenders are da' bomb!! The ponko fries were also tasty, and the salad was pretty fresh.  A plate will just set you back $10 and is quite filling.  I must admit that I had my doubts about how filling the plate would be but I left pretty darn full.   \\n\\nMy wife had the grilled chicken and it was also very good!  The grilled chicken is available in Teriyaki or Island sauce, and the Teriyaki sauce had a great flavor.    \\n\\nThere is not much seating available - just a few chairs on the inside and several more on the outdoor patio.  Most patrons took their food \\"to go\\", but there were a few that stuck around.  We were able to grab one of the few seats available and eat inside the restaurant.  I found the restaurant to be very clean.  \\n\\nKeep in mind that all the food is made to order and you will wait 5 - 10 minutes before your order is ready.  There is plenty of parking available in the front and sides of the restaurant.  \\n\\nI will definitely be back for another fix of this wonderful chicken!!  Hats off to Ponko for executing such a wonderful, delicious idea!!!  My simple advice to you is to get yourself down here NOW and check this place out!"},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Part of growing up is accepting that nothing is perfect.  Your face has imperfections.  Your boss could use a personalityectomy.  Medicine is an imprecise science.  And Comcast is just a sack of shit.\\n\\nBut Bar Mezzana is perfect.\\n\\nThe restaurant looks amazing.  The service is efficient.  And the cider I had, W√∂lffer Estate, was great.  Not too sweet and not too pink.  Christ forbid that strangers think I like men because of the color of my drink. \\n\\nThe food, though, is the point and every bite made my taste buds crackle like a welder's torch.\\n\\nWe were having dinner with another couple who also knows food and they ordered the grilled octopus as a starter while we ordered the eggplant, chili, and honey crostini.  I ate octopus once in college but it was in sun-dried form.  It was like chewing on a salty shoelace.  There was some give but not enough to bite through it so I had to swallow each petrified strand whole and feel it wriggle its way down my gullet.\\n\\nSurely grilled octopus had to be better.  \\n\\nIt turned out to be the creamiest, softest piece of a dead animal I have ever eaten.  It had a consistency almost like cream cheese and a subtle flavor that was vaguely nutty.  I prefer turf to surf but I would have that grilled octopus again.  I also thought it was cool that I was eating a tentacle.  Something about this made me feel like an apex predator.  Not much could remind you that you're at the top of the food chain like a dish that requires someone to cut the arms off another species and serve them to you.\\n\\nThe crostini was a perfect indicator of the culinary creativity at work in the kitchen.  Eggplant has a neutral taste and a puree consistency.  This makes it a great vehicle for other flavors.  Sweet and spicy rarely doesn't work so honey and chili as the passengers in the eggplant vehicle was ideal.  It had such a vibrant tang to it, I ate slowly for a change so I could savor it.  The bread was as good as it gets too; crisp, chewy crust and an airy interior.\\n\\nOut came our main courses.  \\n\\nI ordered the garganelli with duck ragout and Miss K ordered the chicken under a brick with panzanella and broccoli rabe.\\n\\nI don't know enough synonyms for delicious to describe the ragout.  It was thick, seasoned perfectly (which is usually what restaurants can't get right), and hugging every inch of the tubular pasta.  Garganelli has grooves in it and the sauce and duck had settled into the grooves.  The attention to detail was phenomenal.  It is the best variation on a bolognese I have ever had.\\n\\nMiss K gave me a piece of her chicken.  It was so good, it depressed me.  It depressed me not to have the skill and knowledge how to cook something that well at home.  The skin was crisp and delicious and the meat was juicy.  Even the parts which tend to be drier and leaner were juicy.  I was humbled by the clinic that  Mezzana's chefs were putting on for us.  I would give my left arm for either recipe.\\n\\nTo top it off, we shared the chocolate and cardamom ice cream.  I was the only one who thought there should have been a more pronounced cardamom flavor.  Cardamom is a spice with a big personality.  Whenever I use it at home, I let it shine.  But this doesn't take away from the meal's perfection.  A 0.000003% imperfection doesn't count.\\n\\nWhen the check came, we paid a hefty amount for the meal.  Each couple paid over $100 including the tip.  But it was worth it.  It was one of the best dining experiences I've had in recent years."},{"name":"Manuel's","address":"310 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great house and specially margaritas.

I've been to Sound Table over a half-dozen times since moving here in Late 2015. Although the crowd has changed, the music has stayed consistently good! It all depends on the night you go, which can vary from which DJ is hosting that particular evening. I prefer Saturday's to Friday as the music is a mix of house/r&b/dance and old school hip hop. \\n\\nWhat needs Work? - \\nNot a big fan of the bartenders whenever I come here. Usually they have a smug look on their face as if they haven't slept or too annoyed to make you a well mixed drink! I come back for the music and people itself, but the bar is almost always slammed and they don't really show you attention you have to stand waiting for someone to grace your existence. I would definitely bring people from out of town here for the music vibes, and the patio during the summer. Check out the spot next to it called Space 2! Usually its a privately rented out venue that can support smaller crowds, but I find the bartenders over on that side easier to deal with. \\n\\nOverall, middle of the range venue that has lost its appeal over the past couple years, but still a cool place to spend your Saturday with endless jams and good people. \\n\\n3 STARS"},{"name":"Wichita Pub","address":"11481 SE Hwy 212","city":"Clackamas","stars":"3","text":"Best play to hang, have breakfast, lunch , dinner or to just chill at the slots...

I came with my girlfriend at 9:30pm to grab a few drinks and dessert. After being seated with our reservation, within a few minutes, someone who I assume is one of the managers came by to tell us that their system was down and that they could not take credit cards which we said that it was fine and that we would pay with cash. My girlfriend volunteered to go get some cash and within 5 minutes of when she was gone the table next to us paid with a card which I thought was weird. The table in front of us then also paid with a card. And then another table. Aside from this it took about 15 minutes for the waiter to come by with water and another 10 minutes to get drink orders. And then we realized it had been over 40 minutes and we had never been asked if we wanted to order any food....which we had planned to. \\n\\nAt the end of drinks a total of 5 tables had paid with a card that we saw. We received our bill without being asked if we would like another drink first and decided to try to pay with card and it worked without hesitation from the waiter. Upon leaving I decided to ask a different manager in front of the hostess if the card system was down and there was about 5 second of silence prior to him unconvincingly saying \\"yes it was down\\" I said \\"ok, it was just very inconvenient to get cash when within 5 minutes people started paying with cards around us\\". The manger was clearly lying and had no idea what I was talking about the hostess seemed uncomfortable with my question. And we left. I'm not sure what the situation was for them to say that their system was down - were they trying to get us to leave? It made the entire experience very uncomfortable as if they didn't want us there.

It may look like a quick dine in, until the hostess busts out the wait list and tells you that the wait will be 2hr plus for a table of 2. The nice thing about the wait though, is that the hostess will call you instead of sending a text or buzzard, which is better in my opinion, because it allows you to frolic as far as you please without worrying about the connection. The bf and I did that and ended up snacking on some frites at Saus (highly recommend) and walking around the Boston Public Market until the hostess called me. \\nNow for the food:\\n\\nClam chowder 4.5/5: light and creamy. It wasn't heavy at all like some clam chowder soups I've had. The soup is made on the spot when ordered, which you can taste! All the ingredients tasted fresh. I have it a 4.5 because I didn't like how hard the potatoes were, I like them a bit more soft. But it's whatever preference you have.\\n\\nLobster roll (4/5): I don't know why, but I thought lobster rolls were supposed to be creamy, like smothered with some mayo and such? Instead, it was present on a toasted challah bread with butter and fresh shredded lobster pieces. Nonetheless, it tasted great! Call my ghetto or whatever, I do like a bit of creaminess in my lobster roll. It also came with fries that were very crispy and pretty much took over the plate.\\n\\nOysters (5/5): I honestly didn't know there were different kinds of oysters. Our waiter handed us a slip of paper that showed the different types and flavor style of each oyster. I only ordered 4, they're on the pricy side ($2.90) a piece. But tasted very fresh. I thought it was cool that we were able to see the chef chuck (?) the oysters and prep all the fresh sea food.\\n\\nSome things to keep in mind. They don't take reservations, so expect to wait. I would suggest to come here when you're feeling semi hungry, so you can be placed on the waitlist, and by the time you're hungry, you can eat. I don't recommend coming here as a group, like 4 people. You'll have to wait longer, and restaurants is pretty small."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"7300 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"so I normally have an amazing time at the garden but this visit was not the best my girlfriend and I were out for lunch and instead of going to our original choice we decided to go to olive garden . well from the get go it was off to a rocky start when we were goin to our booth the bus boy dropped everything on his tray onto our table and even though there was plenty of other places to sit we were told to head back up to the front and wait some more.

As we were leaving the manager tried to tell us our table was ready finally, but at this point my fianc√©'s well planned night was ruined since we were now tired, hungry, already spent money on bar drinks and appetizers, and it would've taken even longer to order real entrees once we sat down.

Some of the best things we've had here haven't appeared to be for sale. For instance, I was looking in the deli case, and saw in the very back, mostly wrapped in paper, what appeared to be a ham. Obviously not on display for sale. (Turned out to be a component of one of the types of subs.) But I asked the guy behind the counter if I could get a half pound, and he sliced it for me without a problem. Just about the best ham we've ever eaten. Another example. Taleggio is my favorite Italian cheese, but there was none in the case. I asked, and lo and behold, there was some Taleggio behind the counter. And not the fresh, mild Taleggio, but aged Taleggio, all stinky and creamy. Yum. So, don't be afraid to ask or point out. \\n\\nThere is a small but good selection of wine, in a range of prices.

The Hangtown fry with fried oysters and biscuit was definitely my favorite- so salty, fatty with great texture added by the biscuit (ask for their honey butter to eat it with). The lemon ricotta pancakes were fluffy, but not the best I've had. Same for the Korean fried chicken. And in terms of the polenta n sugo, the polenta wasn't the perfect creamy consistency and the pork wasn't tasty enough to make up for it. \\n\\nAll in all, would recommend others to come and try out their food and delicious cocktails.

The resturant lived up to billing with the burgers and buffalo wings being very good. Beverage selections were very good as well.We waited 2 1/2 hrs before being seated and for me it was a negative.\\nThe second time a couple of weeks ago, my wife and I went it was a terrible experience. The greeter was rude in her comments to some of the patrons waiting or inquiring when a table would be ready. Also,she was eating a chicken wing at the sign in station and that was unprofessional. She was then replaced with another rude greeter who secretly mark patrons who inquired when they would be  seated and made them wait longer. My wife and I had been there over 21/2 hours when another couple who had arrive an hour after we had been waiting were seated before us. When I saw this, I went to inquire why this had occurred and she gave a rude response and placed another mark by our name. It was only after my wife threatened her that we were going to speak to the manager about this, we were quickly seated. This time the quality of the food was worse and I was ready to toss in the towel. If management reads this review, I would strongly suggest hiring more competent people to work on the front end and end the practice of selectively seating people. I spent $100 bucks on the first visit and additional $80 visit with the poor service. We will not be returning to Thurman cafe due to the extreme wait time and games staffers are playing with customers"},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"In town on a Saturday night and our first choice reported a 2 hour and 45 minute wait, Barcelona wasn't much quicker for a table but we were able to sit at the bar right away, no complaints for that! We were all excited about eating Spanish and Barcelona had a very nice atmosphere. I've had some really good Paella in my time (made by the spanish military while I was in spending a year in Bosnia), so I was excited to have some as good as I remembered it. The bartender was very attentive and friendly, did a very good job of explaining the menu and specials, overall the customer service experience was very good. I ordered the paella Barcelona and it looked pretty good when it was served, the taste did not match however. The paella very soggy and did not taste good at all, it was as if they dumped an entire container of black pepper into the dish, I'm ok with spicy but this was straight up black pepper flavor, yuck! The large piece of chicken in the middle of the paella was very bland as well, overall the dish was not good especially for $27. My wife complained that the tortilla soup had the consistency of runny grits, she was not happy with the food either. Maybe we just had an off experience but I'm not sure we'll be back for a second chance and Barcelona. In my opinion this is just another overpriced restaurant that people rave about with mediocre food, too trendy with no real substance or flavor.

Our entire trip in Portland, this was hands down one of my favorite meals. We ordered the Reggie, Hash Up with brisket, shrimp and grits, and a side of gravy fries. My mouth is watering just thinking back on the food. That's how good it was. The Reggie with egg is a must order. The biscuit was light and fluffy but had a crispy crust. All the ingredients complemented each other really well. I did wish that they smothered the biscuit sandwich with more gravy though! But for me, the highlight was definitely the shrimp and grits. It stood out the most to me because I've never actually tried grits before. In my head, I imagined it to be grainy but this was so fragrant and creamy. They don't skimp out on the shrimp either. If you like garlic, definitely order this! I lightweight wish I could have this for breakfast every day. The hash up was also really good. I love that they make their hash browns extra crispy -- none of that soggy potato stuff. Their gravy fries were also delicious. Tip is to get a mix of their sausage gravy and their mushroom gravy.

Hip, trendy, with great food, great coffee, and great people. Definitely scored on all accounts!\\n\\nWe finally got here last Saturday morning with a very minimal wait time. Why? Well, we came before they opened of course! We got seated as soon as we got to the front and it was pretty awesome! The person who met us at the door was extremely friendly and almost couldn't wait for us to sit down and relax for brunch.\\n\\nWe got a little corner towards the front of the restaurant which was dimly lit, but it didn't bother us. The ambiance here at Tasty n Alder screamed modern hipster, as their was a good playlist of new/newish pop music playing in the background. Pretty much everyone around us checked into Yelp, posted pictures of their food and talked about reviews. Funny culture we have here with Yelp, right?\\n\\nThe food was excellent! The coffee was amazing (I had 4+ cups)! Chocolate Potato Donut was bomb! The french toast was amazing! Their Hot Damn! omelette was delicious! Their Fried Chicken Cheddar Biscuit was deliciously savory! I love that their menu allows for you to order multiple dishes and they come out family style. It really allowed us to enjoy all the plates. The plates weren't huge portions, but the quality was great. Lots of places are trying to do these huge dishes, but their quality suffers. Not Tasty n Alder!\\n\\nOne negative was that they forgot about one of our dishes and after numerous times we had asked about it's status, we still didn't end up getting it for about 40 minutes late. The positive is that they comp'ed two of our dishes due to their mess up. That's customer service! $19 for our entire meal! Wow!\\n\\nI could have stayed longer and just sat there and ate and drank coffee, but alas we left pretty full, and really looking forward to our next trip here to not only Portland, but back to Tasty n Alder!

Nestled down from a sonic and not too far from the Whataburger is a little bit of family-owned heaven. You might find the owner working when the kids have gone back to school. Customer service is top notch. The customers seem to enjoy being nice as well... \\n\\nThe limestone \\"Hill Country Style\\" building has a lovely porch with outdoor seating (well-behaved dogs are welcome) which is blissful on spring or fall evenings. Somehow, even in August they get a nice breeze. They are open late, by small-town standards (this isn't a chain, people) and the kids like to hang out under the fans. \\n\\nThe menu is varied and its prepped but cooked fresh. Keep this in mind in the summer heat and call in your order. More often than not you'll find a fleet of Escalades (with AC on full tilt) waiting in the drive through. I've never had onion rings left under a warmer for hours.\\n\\nOh did I mention the onion rings? Yeah. The onion rings are from heaven. Light and crispy, not dripping oil. I'd put them on my salad... and in my breakfast cereal if my waistline would handle it. The French Fries and made of real potatoes. They aren't dreamed up in a chemist's lab. That means you can chew and enjoy them. The salads have all been crisp and lovely. My favourite is the Greek Spinach with chicken; however, they have each been lovely. Make sure to check the weekly specials. Those are always good.\\nThe burgers are made with good quality beef that, again, you can chew and enjoy. All of their meat products are good, their fish is excellent and either dipped in polenta (corn grits) for those of you watching your glycemic index (have wheat issues) or uses tempura.  Their vegetarian options really shine! Their vegetarian \\"Austin\\" burger is great but you can get any of the burgers with a veggie burger. What I don't know for certain is if this veggie burger is vegan. I'm not a vegan, but I like that the owners treat their *employees* like human beings and not like cattle, so I won't complain.\\nOver all, a place to go when you don't feel like cooking, but don't eat chains either.

Loved.\\nBefore coming to Boston, I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and knew it was my must-eat in Boston. We came for Marathon weekend, so I knew the entire city would be slammed, but I was prepared for a wait. We arrived around noon on Saturday and completely lucked out! An hour wait! :) I gave the hostess my number and we got the chance to peruse Mike's Pastry and grab a couple brews at Goody Glover's before we got the call. \\nWhen we returned, we got a seat right by the door. This place is tiny, but so full of Boston charm! We did get a kick out of people coming in, seeing no line, and then thinking there was no wait only to get totally blindsided when they find out the wait was now up to 3 hours :) Ha! So happy that we planned ahead! I knew before we sat down that I wanted that lobster roll. Hot and buttered. We decided to share it along with some a la carte shrimp cocktail, crab claw, wine and the New England Clam Chowder. The shrimp was very good. So fresh tasting! The crab claw I was less enthused over. It was kinda hard to eat, but I still really enjoyed the flavor. The clam chowder was VERY good. The broth was thin, which was surprisingly because I love thick, chunky chowder, but it was SO flavorful. The clams were huge and plentiful... we basically licked the bowl. Our first NE chowder experience was a special one ;) However, it was quickly forgotten once that lobster roll came out. Paired with fries, the sandwich looked small, but looks are so deceiving. The bun it was served on was mostly gutted so it was PACKED with lobster instead. And not just any lobster... this was warm and fresh... it was buttered, oh it was buttered, but not in a 'dunked' or 'globbed' way.. it certainly wasn't too much or too greasy. Even though we shared the sandwich, it was still a good portion.. the best being the middle bites where the bread was soggiest... YUM. I told the husband not to resuscitate me if I choked on the lobster roll. Gone too soon, maybe, but doing what I love: eating Neptune Oyster lobster roll. I will come back here each time I am in Boston. Fantastic food! Pricey, but not unreasonable.

The concept is not unique as many restaurants is opting for this service style. You go into an assembly line. Pick up base (rice, noodles, etc), protein, veggies, sauce, done.  Most of the ingredients are super seasoned and I personally wish they were more less seasoned as when you put them all together it is going to be either a hit or miss.  We created a bowl with sweet potato noodles (almost no taste) which I think were seasoned with some sesame oil, added on top BBQ chicken (didn't like the taste at all- not sure what kind of BBQ sauce it was), sweet potatoes (they were good), added a few veggies and done.

Really good food, fair prices, attentive service, food arrived promptly- it's my new favorite place! My \\"Huntress\\" cocktail was the perfect balance of sweet and bitter, with a lovely rosy color. My husband's \\"All the Tricks\\" was tasty and refreshing, not sweet. Calamari were perfectly fried and a little spicy. Smoky tomato-basil soup was wonderful, with a side of grilled cheese that could be a meal in itself, but then you'd miss the mains. We had the porchetta- crispy and flavorful, with roasted Brussels sprouts and a silky sweet potato pur√©e which were a perfect complement to the pork. \\nNot too many gluten-free options among the sandwiches and pizza, alas, but nearly all the appetizers and mains could be modified, and our server Mario worked with me to assure a safe meal.

We ordered and waited for the food, not too long, and the food was good.  We got the goat cheese gnocchi and cauliflower soup to start, which were both flavourful and light.  \\n\\nMy other friend and I decided to split the burger, and we ordered it medium.  This is where the lunch started to go downhill.  The burger came and we cut it in half.  I took a bite and didn't notice anything off.  Was not the best burger, but not bad either.  However, I went to take another bite and noticed that my burger was raw in the middle.  Not rare, raw.  So I pointed this out, very politely because I felt bad, to the waitress and she acted like I was being ridiculous to even bother her with such trivial nonsense.  She said we shouldn't have cut the burger since they just have to make me a new one.  I said ok, and off she went.  \\n\\nI got the burger back, just a half, which is fine, but then don't yell at me about a whole burger, and asked for it in a to-go container because we were on lunch hour.  The waitress came back and asked about dessert and since it was a birthday we ordered one to share.  The creme brulee, which was good as well, but VERY lemon-y.  I like lemon, but if you don't then avoid it.  The waitress, however, had an attitude change since the beginning of the meal and was not pleasant. No smiles, no attention, nothing.  Just the routine.\\n\\nMy dining companions also noticed how bad the service got towards the end.

We returned at 10:55am Monday and there was already a small line forming.  \\n\\nOrdered #1 noodle soup w/ beef medium spicy and #2 noodles w/ chix mild spicy.  Both seemed about the same level of spice, which is probably spicier than a typical mild or medium at another restaurant.  I love spicy, so I could probably tolerate spicy, but it might overwhelm the flavors.\\n\\nThe soup had more flavor than the stir fry, but both were good.  The beef is more of a short rib, tender and fatty type of beef, which was awesome.  Portions were large--could easily share one order between two people, but then again, you may be fighting over noodles ;) The food is so inexpensive, may as well get your own.   \\n\\nNoodles were legit.  Only minor critique (and I'm just nit-picking) was that the noodles in the soup start to get really soft after awhile, so you kind of have to eat them pretty quickly so they don't overcook.

Not the case with PCG.\\n\\nOver the years I have had many business dinners, lunches, and Happy Hours with friends. The decor has not changed in 20 years! Very dark inside with bar height tables and chairs, stools around the bar, and the much coveted booths by the window.

I was craving dessert and saw the beautiful pictures of your souffl√© pancakes! I was so soooo excited to try it out I practically begged my boyfriend to drive me to Boston just to get your pancakes. Of course my loving boyfriend wanted to make me happy so we drove an hour down to come and dine. ***Warning: There is only street parking, almost impossible to find*** I scrolled through the yelp photos and also notice your amazing seafood boils. I am a huge fan of seafood, so I decided I'd also get some of it while I'm there anyways. I made a reservation before I got there, which is honestly the best idea. It was so busy there, if you don't want to end up waiting, especially if you have more than 2 people, make a reservation!!! Souffl√© pankcakes are only served during brunch. I was very disappointed about this, I'm sure if you had this all day you'd be making a few extra bucks! Although they didn't have the souffl√© pancakes I still decided to get the seafood boil. We ordered mama sue's big bowl of crabs, it was sooooo full of crabs and it was very delicious. The food was great, but the service was mediocre at best. Our waitress took quite some time before she got our order. She didn't really come check on us either. There was a large table behind me, their kid spilled a bucket of shells right under my seat. I had to move because obviously I don't want to be stepping in shells. A waiter that finally noticed had a terrible expression on his face as if he was upset. He took a paper towel off OUR table to clean up the mess near my seat (even though it wasn't us who spilled it). My boyfriend was still using the napkin. He then clears my shells but slams the plate back on my table. I was confused and thought maybe he thought we spilled and didn't pick it up? That was a pretty irritating and uncomfortable experience. I'm just trying to have a good time on my two year anniversary with my boyfriend. I shouldn't feel like I upset someone over something I didn't do in the first place.

I probably could've eaten these all day.\\n\\nI also had the hot lobster roll with salad.  I did not feel like the dish warranted the high price tag ($27) compared to the other 2 lobster rolls I had in town.  The meat was plentiful and very good, but slightly over cooked and not quite sweet enough for my liking.  I also found the bread to be slightly overdone, but it seemed like this was the same as the other rolls I ate.\\n\\nWhat really made my meal stand out was the service.

We stared our meal with Charbroil Oysters which were absolutely delicious! So fresh and flavorful. My favorite part of the entire meal. The next appetizer we had was the crab claws, they were okay in my opinion. A little on the oily side and not as flavorful as I would have liked. We also had the honey croissant which were soooooo good! Yes we were a bit on the hungry side. Next we had a Caesar salad before out entree came out. It was perfect. My meal was the Shrimp D'Angelo and OMG! The pasta was cooked perfectly. The flavors were just right for my taste buds. It comes with Shrimp and mushrooms which were fresh and not overcooked. I was so full I actually took a doggy bag and honestly the pasta was EVEN better the night day. I gave 4 star simply because of the crab claws. They were just not that good. Service was great.

For food, bf went with carne asada and I got enchiladas blancas. It was love at first bite, OHMYJORGE it was so. FREAKING. GOOD. The plates were annihilated. The food put us in such an awesome mood that we decided on another round of drinks. Then another. Then maybe one more... Then those drinks put us in such a good mood, that we decided on dessert.

First off, the interior is beautiful - white tablecloth, small flowers and a candle on every table, spacious and soft chairs, chic lightbulbs. Perfect for a romantic date night, celebration/get-together, or just a nice dinner in downtown Vancouver. \\n\\nDinner service felt pretty slow... so slow that a table decided to walk out after too long of a wait with no word or update from their server. I'd say the speed of dinner service had to do with it being a weekend night in downtown with a full house. Plan accordingly and don't walk in super hungry or if you're short on time (or patience) on the weekend. Although my friends and I spent a lot of time staring at the interior decorations and wishing we could get more of the fresh, soft bread** while waiting for the food, our server was really kind and genuinely friendly, so the long wait for dinner wasn't too bad. We opted out of having dessert at the restaurant because we wanted to explore other local eats, and our server wrote down a list of nearby bakeries and gave recommendations on her favorite eats at each place!\\n**Fresh, soft bread was unlimited, but the person bringing the basket of bread around the restaurant was out of sight and reach most of the time.\\n\\n***Food thoughts below***\\n\\n* Scallops\\nIf you're a seafood fan, get this!! We started off with the scallops as an app. Pancetta wrapped around pan-seared scallops with a decadent beurre blanc (three scallops per order). We licked up all the sauce, leafy greens, roasted tomatoes and all! Wow, so delicious, wish I could have it right now. \\n\\n*Truffle Spaghetti & Meatballs\\nOne of the most popular dishes at Italian Kitchen. A large dollop of ricotta atop truffle cream and spaghetti? Three larger than life meatballs? I loved every bite of my dinner. I couldn't finish this plate alone, but I had a fun time while it lasted... then my meatball loving friend helped me finish the rest. If you're not sure what to get and you think you're a basic spaghetti and meatballs person, try this out. Delectable, but certainly not basic.\\n\\n*Seafood Linguine\\nAlso a very popular dish. If you love seafood, this is your dinner. Prawns and scallops atop a bed of linguine with a light, creamy tomato sauce. They do not skimp on the protein. Btw, the prawns are jumbo prawns, booyah!\\n\\n*Beef Agnolotti\\nI believe this is a seasonal or limited-time dish on their menu. Ground beef and herbs stuffed in perfectly shaped agnolotti. The agnolotti was served with some greens for garnish, onions, and a savory beef broth. I had one agnolotti and loved it - the pasta was soft, but not overly soft, and the beef filling didn't feel heavy. I wanted to reach for another bite, but... my meatball and beef loving friend had demolished the whole plate.\\n\\nWould I dine at Italian Kitchen again?

The napkin dispensers had just been refilled by a co-worker of yours who hadn't taken to snacking the way you did, but your obliviousness to the befuddled looks he directed your way made me even weaker at my knees.  I can't resist a man with no work ethic and even less regard for those around him!  \\n\\nBut, my King, it is at the moment the clock struck three today, during the coldest afternoon we've had in months, when the planets certainly aligned in our favor, that I knew you were meant for me.  When your Casio DataBank watch gave the oh-so-familiar beep indicating that it was 3:00 p.m., you jumped from your hiding place and happily took off your apron. Oh, my heavens!  Your work day was over and my fantasy had just begun!  And at the same moment, my taco \\"salad\\" was ready.\\n\\nI reached to retrieve it at the very moment you whisked past me in quite a hurry, perhaps to catch a train home, or maybe to go to Lids and get another cool hat like the loud Yankees one you had on today.  As you sprinted past me, your arm grazed my shoulder. And before I could take a mental picture of this unbelievable moment so I could never forget it, your afternoon of snacking presented itself in one large, smelly, glorious sound.    \\n\\nAnd you, my King, you did not lose your stride as you only stopped for a split second to take a satisfied sniff and continue towards your final destination.  That determination stayed with me, but not as long as your flatulence stayed with me and my taco \\"salad\\".  \\n\\nI hope that one day I can tell you these things in person.  I am shy, and I am sure somebody like you has many women just waiting for you to finish your snacks every day and are already wiping off those pieces of congealed cheese from your luscious lips.   But if you have room in your heart for me, I'll return to Qdoba at the same time next Tuesday and I'll fart on *you* this time.   Wouldn't that be so much fun, my King?  Even more fun than eating those 'burritos' your store makes!"},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I have visited Joey D's twice.

She raise the prices, the portions got smaller and finally we just stopped going.

I was a little bit nervous about it, but was pleasantly surprised that the food was good.  It wasn't as good as ______, wait, I actually cannot think of a brewery with really good food that I like.  IT is either \\"ok\\", or it is over-the-top trying to be fancy but it isn't-sort-of-thing.  Raccoon Lodge is not trying to be pretentious, it  just serves the food in an expected way, \\"it is what it is.\\"  Besides, I rarely go to breweries for the food anyways, I usually go for the beer. \\n      I've had the Raspberry Wheat for years, ever since my first time going to Oregon's Brewfest in 2004 and I'm a little embarrassed to say that I never made it out to Raccoon Lodge before now (about 10 years later).  I also had a glass of the Sang Noir and the Strawberry which were both wonderful.  I had a few tasters, I tried their Saison de la Maison (which was a great saison, I was just more in the mood for a sour beer) and I also tried a taste of the IPA, the 2014 Summer Solstice, which I mistakenly thought was a sour IPA, but it turns out it was a regular IPA, which I was not a fan of at all, I gave the rest of the taster to my husband to try.  And, he loved it!  Also, my Mom really liked red beer they had on tap, the Kellarman.  My husband also really liked the Black Wheat Stout that they had on tap.  ANd, we were excited to find the beer cooler with all the cascade brewing beers in bottles, or most of them.  We bought a bottle of Vlad the Imp Aler and called it a night, it was hard to walk away with out buying a bottle of the Kriek as well!  \\n     And, a little more about the food-  in our group we ordered a few different things and shared them.  Someone ordered the CHicken Quesadilla's with the chicken on the side (to accommodate vegetarians like me), and it was served Mexican style, with all the toppings, lettuce, extra sauce, and yumminess on the top.  Also, we got an order of the loaded sweet potato fries, with gorgonzola, green onion, balsamic glaze (and chopped bacon on the side)  and they were very good.  We even got a second order with traditional fries instead of sweet potatoes, but the consensus of the group was that we were all partial to the sweet potato fries more.  I also ate the beet and green salad, it was yummy with mandarin orange pieces and hazelnuts and some other yummy things.  My hubby ordered the Anasazi and Roasted Veggie Wrap, he must have liked it because he ate the whole thing and I didn't even get a chance to try a bite of it!  The food was great for brewery food, compared to all the spots I know.  \\n     Also, the grounds and general atmosphere of Raccoon Lodge was exquisite.  The downstairs aka \\"The Raccoon Den\\" has a more bar-like-feel a good spot to hang out and drink beer and play pool etc (and buy more bottles of the sour beers if you desire).  The upstairs is the traditional restaurant.  And, the back patio is ideal, a very rustic lodge feel, being surrounded by very tall trees and a great open space.  You are basically right by the parking lot, but it doesn't feel like it.  When we checked it out for the first time, the weather was ideal, about 80 degrees and cooling, it was a beautiful day to be outside.

For me, not a good match.  The meal came with a glass of juice, coffee, and a cinnamon role at the end, about the size of a coaster around and maybe a 1/4 of an inch deep.  $11.94 I think it was.

In talking with one of the owners, they are planning to expand their kitchen menu in the future and slowly introduce new dishes. I can't wait! You do have to order your food at the kitchen counter (separate from the bar). One of the owners highly recommended the peri peri chicken tacos but I was in a fry kind of mood. \\n\\nWe ordered the drunken chicken fries and the truffle fries. The chicken fries had like a green curry chili with beer cheese Queso, made with their own IPA. This was my favorite and had a slight but good kick to it. The truffle fries had Parmesan cheese and small rosemary sprigs. All their fries are beer battered with their own beer. Both fry dishes were delicious. I did request a little more truffle oil for my fries but they were super accommodating about it. \\n\\n(Again) In talking with one of the owners (it was a long conversation), Oviedo Brewing will be hosting quite a few upcoming events, including weekly Trivia on Wednesdays...and eventually a Yoga And Brews type of thing.

I don't usually order bi bim bap at traditional Korean restaurants because my experiences with the plate is that it's usually too bland, but the flavors here were outstanding.

And, to top it off, they had a few day old loaves that weren't sellable (but definitely edible), so they threw in one of those, so technically, I got two loaves for $9. I'm not a sourdough girl, but their sourdough had my eyes popping out of my head at a recent event, so definitely try a piece of that before naysaying it if you're a fellow sourno, like me. I'm loving the olive bread. It's great as a stand alone with just a little butter or spread of some kind (leftover chipotle pecan pesto from\\nBouldin Creek Cafe, let's say), but also a great base for my egg sandwiches in the morning.\\n\\nCookies: Ooooooooh child. Their most notable one is the banana Nutella and if you like either of those things, you'll be head over banana peels for that. A surprise one for me was the PB&J. I think most peanut butter cookies fall short, but this actually had PB in it (it wasn't just the cookie dough) so when you pulled it apart, it was a medley of PB&J, much like a sandwich can be.

We were quickly sat down and our waiter was amazing, very honest with his recommendations and was very patient with us.  Now maybe because it was a week night there wasn't that many other patrons inside the restaurant, though the people that were there seemed like regulars.  I had ordered the Manhattan to drink which was on special and was only $5.  The drink definitely did not lack on the alcohol by any means which was a nice surprise since it was such a bargain.  For the food I had ordered the turkey burger with fries.  It was a very big portion and for the price you really can't beat it.  The burger was tasty and the fries were good as well.  Now was it something I hadn't seen before? No, but did it satisfy my hunger? Yes.  I was way too full to order any dessert but I definitely want to try them for next time.

There were two reasons why this place gets 5 stars.  The first is the food.  And let me start by saying I don't think I have ever had a salad, let alone a house salad, worth reviewing.  This house salad was hands down AMAZING! Every single bight just taste better and better and I could gladly just have an entire meal of house salads.  The pasta was also fantastic but I don't know if I would say its the best I have.  Well worth the price though of $10.  I highly highly highly suggest you get the half salad and half pasta deal, because you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\\nNow the second reason why they get 5 stars is for service.  When I got there, there were probably around 6-8 people in line so I gladly moved my way to the back.  As I got closer, there was a very friendly guy there to tell me about the menu and answer any questions I had.  He wasn't taking any orders, just there to help.  I don't know why more places don't do this, it made choosing my meal a bit harder though because he made everything sound great. \\n\\nOver all, great food and even better service.

It's a place that has established itself and built a lot of hype and reputation as an authentic and truly fresh Italian restaurant/food truck. At the price point of $12-$15 per plate of pasta it's really hard to justify paying $20-25+ for other pastas at other Italian restaurants when the price and food all hit the spot at Patrizi's. The only thing missing for me is the consistency and the actual quality of the food. After visiting and trying most if not all pasta items off of the menu (mainly through sharing and trying other dishes through friends and family), the menu for me got jaded pretty quick, and that's something that I don't like at all, especially at an Italian restaurant. The pasta is bland at times, it's inconsistent from time to time in terms of the flavor and seasoning, and it sometimes is just okay. \\n\\nAnother thing to add-- the line at Patrizi's is quite long most of the time, and this is usually a testament to show for its quality food, however, in my honest opinion, I'd rather just go somewhere then wait 30 minutes or so for the food.\\n\\nIt's overall a very solid place, and I think that it's more of a 3.5/5 than a 4/5, but I'd rather round up than round down because I do like the place and I think it's great for the price!"},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Another great example of how popularity can actually be a restaurant's downfall. This place is famous for its giant burgers featured on Man vs Food on the Travel Channel. The food is good but the shockingly horrendous service, and the chore of actually being there overwhelm any quality the food could ever have. I wouldn't go back to this place again if the food was so delicious I fainted because my brain couldn't handle it. This place is a nightmare. \\n\\nIt all begins with the parking, or rather the lack of it. Do a few laps up and down the road to find one and hope you know how to parallel park. \\n\\nThen you get inside and you wait to be seated. And you wait. And you wait some more. Then when you're done waiting, you wait some more. Then you start to wonder why you have yet to see a hostess come out and check the waiting list or give you any sign of hope that you might ever get into the place. Then you wait longer, a lot longer. Then when you finally give up and decide to leave, you finally see the hostess for the first time who calls somebody and lets you know that you are in fact actually in line to get in. \\n\\nSo when we finally got in, we got rushed into ordering our drinks when we hadn't even seen the menu yet. Then all that time we waited to get in, we waited again for the food to come after we finally got to order it. \\n\\nThe food finally got there. It was a cheeseburger. Yay. It was mediocre. No cheese melting all over the side of it like in all the pictures you see. It's a good hamburger, flame broiled, plenty of toppings. But it's a good hamburger that's been hyped to be a life changing experience and really, it's just a good hamburger. No different than any other good hamburger I've had. \\n\\nThen it got even better. Somebody was cleaning up the booth next to us and dropped a glass. Pieces of glass flew up and hit me in the face and fell in my food. I thought about it for a couple minutes and decided to ask for a new one because I didn't know where all the glass shards had gone and didn't want to find out the hard way. So after a long time when I finally saw an employee to ask, she was nice about it and obliged eagerly. So then I got to wait longer for a new burger. But, the guy had taken my fork when he took my plate and I asked for another. Think I could get a new fork? Nope, not in this place. The guy never came back with it and when my burger was cold and the cheese coagulated, I finally found somebody else to ask for a new fork. \\n\\nAs for the eating experience, well the place is old and charming. But it's so crowded in there, and this was on a Tuesday evening, there just is no privacy. There was a line for take out right next to our table where the podium-esque thing was. So the entire meal, we had several strangers' asses close enough for me to feel their farts rustle my hair. If I didn't have their asses, I had them looking at me. Plus the people hanging out right outside the window. I hate being watched while I eat. When I go to a restaurant, I want to have a semi personal conversation. Here, I was a public display like mannequins in a shop window. \\n\\nThis place is ridiculous. It can get away with anything because it's such a popular local place. But if this were a new mom and pop stand that no one had ever heard of, it wouldn't survive its first year. \\n\\nThey hype machine won't be enough to get me back in this disappointing, out of the way hole in the wall."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Being the typical tourist that I am, my priority while visiting Boston was to find the the best lobster roll, and I think I did.

The first time I came was with a school field trip on my birthday, ten years ago. My family and I have been patrons of this place ever since. We get take out, mostly. They're quick to prepare the orders and always get the spice levels right. Though you're never going to get a completely \\"mild\\" order - most of these dishes spices are integral and you couldn't possibly have them removed. I used to hate spicy food and their mild was just the right level for me. \\n\\nMy family's classic order is garlic naan, meat samosas (they're lamb), chicken Tikka masala (ordered medium), chicken vindaloo (hot), and the chicken makhni (medium). When I'm at the restaurant I also get a mango lassi, of course. \\n\\nBoth at the restaurant and take out comes with rice (for each main dish) and a type of tangy cracker that I've never managed to pin the name of.\\n\\nThe samosas are flaky and filled with lamb, onion, and peas. They also heat up really well if you have leftovers. The flavor is incredible, and since it's only 2 to an order you'll be craving more.\\n\\nNaan at this place is great, fluffy and soft, but the garlic adds a little extra that really makes it.\\n\\nMy dad gets the chicken Tikka masala. He's not an adventurous eater so the classic take out is perfect for him. Anmol's Tikka is creamy and buttery, and the chunks of chicken are large and satisfying. This is a great dish for those just venturing into Indian cuisine.\\n\\nMy mom's favorite is the chicken vindaloo. She's the adventurous eater in the family, and handles spice extremely well so she gets it HOT. It's definitely too hot for me to eat a lot of, but the taste is not at all ruined by the spice level (which I find can happen easily at some other places I've tried). The vindaloo has bits of onion and bell pepper strips in it as well as the creamy sauce and chicken chunks.\\n\\nMy favorite it the chicken makhni. This is your classic butter chicken, but Anmol does it best. A bite of this to me is absolute heaven. This dish has a lot of chicken, but unfortunately they're more like strips than chunks. I don't mind too much, because the sauce is king, but I know others might.\\n\\nDespite my glowing review of the food, I often don't enjoy the vibe in the restaurant or of some of their employees. Employees can be great, and the atmosphere is best in the evening, but sometimes it's quiet and awkward in the dining room. I expect it's better in the bar area, but I've never eaten there.\\n\\nThanks though, Anmol. A whole decade of special dinners and comfort food take out makes this place a five star find.

Please bring back the music they used to play when it was the Easy Street...the stuff they were playing was too hipster/Mercedes commercial annoying.  But I digress, on to the food.\\n\\nWhile the food was good it was also pricey.  A Caesar salad was $9.00.  It was an interesting salad in that it looked more like a lettuce sandwich.  A slice of toasted bread on the bottom, then the lettuce, another slice of bread, extra shaved cheese and a couple of anchovies on the top.  A different slant on a classic salad but very tasty.\\n\\nWe ordered the mussels with bacon and garlic fries as the entree.  Good bacon, good sauce for the mussels, but unlike most places where the fries come separate from the mussels, the fries where placed in the middle of the pile of mussels which meant there were less mussels than what I've gotten at other places....and no bread to dip into the sauce.\\n\\nThe mussels were larger than any other place I've ever had them at and were a bit rubbery with a few of them a bit gritty.  The serving size was more appetizer sized instead of entree sized.  And the price for this was $16.00.  We asked for some mayo for the fries, was told no but they had a tomato aioli or something like that instead.\\n\\nOh and my glass of wine for $7.00 was served to me in a little carafe but not with a wine glass that I'm familiar with.  I had what looked like the bottom third of a water glass.  Interesting...\\n\\nOur dinner of one salad, two mussels, a glass of wine, and that aioli (yes they freaking charged us 50cents for some fancy ketchup) came to $51.00 tax included.  Well dang!

But still cheap for dinner... since the prices stay the same all day.\\n\\n4 stars.\\n\\n*** 9/2011 ***\\n\\n$10 for a lunch of vermicelli with pork and fried spring roll.\\n\\n*** 2/2012 ***\\n\\n$7.95 for a big plate of the flat wide rice noodles with veggies and my choice of meat.  The chicken was a bit dry, but the food was plenty for lunch, and for $10 I got out the door with enough for a snack for later.\\n\\n*** 1/2013 ***\\n\\nPrices have gone up a tad - the chicken chow foon is now $8.25, and even though they don't mention celery in the list of veggies on the menu, they do arrive stir-fried into the dish.  Flavors are good though along with the generous portion.\\n\\nThe pork chop rice plate is also now $8.25, and the chops were more generous in portion than the chops I spotted at Pho Hoa around the block and just a tad down the street later in the month.\\n\\n*** 5/2013 ***\\n\\nThe pork chop rice plate has stayed at $8.25, and the portion stayed generous.  The grilled sliced pork & egg roll vermicelli was $8.50 and I had no trouble finishing it, but I was most definitely full after doing so.  I liked that their fish sauce and peanut sauce arrived sans spicy red sauce, which is available on the table for the spice lovers.  An $11 meal, and a great dinner option.\\n\\n*** 10/2015 ***\\n\\nRating adjusted down a star to 3, primarily due to the sticker-shock of half my normal Vietnamese faves surpassing the nine dollar mark at this, the priciest of the Vietnamese establishments I frequent in the Chinatown area:\\n\\n#96 Tofu Vegetables Chowfoon stir-fried (flat rice noodle) $9.35\\n#51 Grilled Sliced Pork and Egg Roll Vermicelli $9.35\\n#39 BBQ Pork Chops (2) Rice on Plate $8.95\\n#14 Beef Noodle Soup $7.75/$7.95/$8.95\\n\\nAnd it didn't help that my #96 came with plenty of celery after I asked for it to come with no celery, and it took two requests for me to get a box for my leftovers.  Oh, well, at least the portion did me in, so I took near a third of it home with me.\\n\\n*** 1/2016 ***\\n\\nNew year, new menu.  I guess they have to stay ahead of their competitors in price after I noticed that one of their nearer neighbors had seemed to match Pho Pasteur's old price iteration.\\n\\n#8 Vietnamese Pancake (Pizza) $9.35\\nA selection of beef noodle soups $7.95 (S) $8.50 (L) $9.50 (XL)\\n#35 Chow Foon with beef, chicken or pork $9.95\\n#39 BBQ Pork Chops (2) Rice on Plate $9.50\\n#41 BBQ Pork Chop, shredded pork skin, and steamed ground pork cake on Rice on Plate $10.00\\n#51 Grilled Sliced Pork and Egg Roll Vermicelli $9.95\\n\\nAdmittedly, however, my order of #39 BBQ Pork Chops (2) Rice on Plate $9.50 arrived with a 3 on the plate - I think they gave me a third chop to provide me with a more satisfactory portion since they were a bit on the small side.\\n\\nI found it odd however that the lady counted the money right at the table as our party were getting our jackets on, instead of taking it and counting it out of sight.  What, were you planning to jump us if you thought we under-tipped you?\\n\\n*** 1/2017 ***\\n\\nA tablemate's lo mein with chicken was a great portion, so we needed take out containers for both that and my BBQ Pork Chops, Rice on Plate.\\n\\n*** 4/2018 ***\\n\\nI should stop trying to get them to not include celery in my Chow Foon - never works.  Tofu Vegetable Chow Foon $9.95 is still good!\\n\\n*** 9/2018 ***\\n\\nThe wait for a table didn't take too long.  I went with the #20 Rare Steak and Well-Done Brisket Beef Noodle Soup $7.95 small with yellow noodle.  The noodle was soft and overcooked... should have gone with the rice noodles.  Otherwise, it was good.\\n\\n*** 9/2018 ***\\n\\nOn another visit, we tried their Seafood Chow Foon $10.95 and fried egg rolls $4.50 (2).  The chow foon lacked that addictive sauce that I remember from the far off past, though they managed to nix the celery successfully per my request.  The fried egg roll came as a count of 3 despite the menu stating that it came as an order of two.  But this was perfect for a light meal for 2 lightweights who were trying to eat lightly."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],H={key:0},F={key:1};function D(s,e,n,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",F,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",H,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const L=u(N,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-90b069c4"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/22.md","filePath":"quotesmag/22.md"}'),G={name:"quotesmag/22.md"},V=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(L)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
