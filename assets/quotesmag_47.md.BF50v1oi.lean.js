Old school Austinites will recall this space was home to the original Angie's (excellent puffy tacos) location.  Gabriella's moves that tradition of killer Tex Mex into the 21st century in all the right ways.  Al Pastor tacos featured tender, marinated big cubes of pork goodness prepared with skill in estilo tipico.  The basics done perfecto with homemade corn tortillas, limes, cebolla, and cilantro.  Chicken Doradas (flautas) shine with shredded well seasoned moist chicken cooked just crisp enough and all smothered under mega-sabor chopped red cabbage, pickled red onions, cilantro, crumbled queso fresca, and drizzled with crema.  Both came with rrrreally good arroz and borracho beans.  Street elote appetizer had big carved fresh off the cob sections (not just kernels)and all the right classic ingredients.  Great horchata further enhanced by the fact the menu advertises one refill.  Nice!  Server and staff super kind and on the ball working together as a team.  A/C cold like you want it on a blazing summer day.  Cool phases of the moon wall paper.  It's a small space inside and it's a great restaurant so it's crowded and it's LOUD.

Many people have commented that the breakfast/brunch menu is an interesting hipster fusion and the Good Dog fits that description quite well.

There's also nice benches out front and the center of Ladd's Addition in front of the cafe sometimes has an old-time music circle going. At the very least, it has grass and space for people to hang out w/ coffee, etc. \\n\\nBUT Palio has no A/C and can get very hot sometimes. AND the brewed coffee is weak -- definitely weaker than it should be brewed. (I actually walk an extra mile to the Ford Building coffeeshop because the brewed coffee there is better. And less expensive. And yes, the staff are friendlier at the Ford Bldg too. And the Ford building is better lit overall for reading and writing. )a\\n\\nIt is also true that the place can be too uptight about customers not paying enough for their seats/tables. The worst thing I witnessed -- by far -- was when a group of 4 or 5 people arrived toward the end of the night, clearly there to visit and share a dessert or two -- but when the server saw that they were going to -- god forbid -- SHARE just one or two desserts and drink self-service water (and maybe buy a drink or two, I don't recall), the server went to the table, told them to buy more or leave. They ended up leaving. \\n\\nYet a single person could have sat at the same table, ordered the same thing, and not had any problem. Moreover, it was 10pm or later, and the place had empty seats and tables, and the number of vacant spaces were only going to increase. \\n\\nHonestly, I think the group was discriminated against partly due to their looks & high energy (but they were NOT intoxicated or loud or distracting). They were, however, a group of tightly-knit friends w/ their own fashion and interests, and it wasn't your typical Portland hipster/barrista thing. Think maybe very long-haired, hippie/beatnik types who might also be into theater & drama. If that makes any sense. \\n\\nAs soon as they entered and sat down -- and yes, they took a seat before any of them went to the counter to place an order -- the server was paying very close attention to them, and did not seem to want them around. But nobody else appeared bothered. In fact, I think the few other people still there in that room that night were surprised at the server's rude behavior and his insistence that they pay, I'm guessing, $12-24, instead of, say, $6-8. (A slice of cake runs $5 or more, as a recall. Though I've not bought it for a long time.)\\n\\nI don't normally write reviews. But the weak coffee has bothered me for a long time. And I thought it was outrageous that the server told a group of 4 or so people at the end of a night that they could not all share a dessert.  \\n\\nGenerally, in my experience, there's no problem getting a coffee and spending 2-3 hours working there. I've seldom paid more than $2.50 or so. And never been harassed about it. \\n\\n(Quite a few people do order more, however, and their savory menu items are often sold out or mostly sold out later in the day.

After the movie they'd decided to try and find a good Mexican restaurant for dinner and set off with an iPhone to find one. Ranch 616 came up. It sounded good so we decided to catch a cab and head that way. \\n\\nOur cab driver had heard of the place, but thought it was French, we think due to serving frog legs, which was the only thing he really knew about the place, but we're not sure. We decide to try it out anyway and get there (was close enough we should of walked) and there's a big-ass snake on the side of the building made out of ducting. That was enough to sell me on the place so we head inside. We were greeted and quickly informed that on weekend nights they're pretty much reservation only, but he asked us if we were from out of town and after we answered yes, he said he's see what he could do. We headed over to the bar where there were 2 seats open, 3 of us. The guys on either side of us started talking to us, while they're eating, and said we should definitely stick around that it was worth the wait. Another seat quickly opened up and we decided to eat at the bar as the people had been friendly and the menu/food looked good. \\n\\nWe shared a frog leg appetizer, after the cab drivers mention how could we not. I order the mixed grill special and my friends ordered the fish tacos and chicken fried tenderloin (I think.) The food was ok, pretty high prices, substantial portions so I was ok with that, but tastes wise it was just OK. Kind of a let down for me, b/c the place and people were great. Anyway, four stars b/c it was a fun evening and cool place, but the food was more 3 1/2 star."},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Their chocolate cream pies are really good when they're good, and really disappointing when they're not. \\n\\nMaybe one out of two times, there is less chocolate pastry cream in the chocolate cream pie than there is whipped cream on top.

The first time this happened, I brought the slice back to them (completely uneaten) and asked them for another slice that had more chocolate in it thinking it must have been a mistake. \\n\\nThe woman at the cash register had attitude about replacing my slice. \\"Oooohhhkaaaaay I guess....\\" The description is chocolate cream pie with whipped cream!

We arrived on Saturday at roughly 10 pm. The place was very lively and probably 80% full. We were greeted by a friendly woman who seated us immediately and got us chips, salsa & drinks. After looking over the menu we decided to order a chicken burrito & an order of carnitas tacos to share. Food came out in about 15 minutes. We both loved the carnitas tacos! They were so well seasoned and very fresh. The rice & refried beans that came with them were also very tasty. The burrito was unlike any we've ever had though. It was more like an enchilada. It was smothered in sauce & cheese. We split it in half and ate it with forks. I was expecting a regular burrito. The one here was not terrible (it had guacamole without having to pay extra which is always A-OK in my book!) but I probably wouldn't order one again because it was a different style than I'm used to. I would absolutely consider going back here to try other menu items and get more carnitas tacos! Overall the experience was nice. The decor here is beautiful, they had live music and singers playing loud (but we liked it!) The waitress was very attentive and friendly. She promptly refilled drinks and even came over to ask how the food was which is wonderful customer service in my opinion.

On top of that there was nothing really outstanding about it. The soup was good, but again, nothing special and seemed rather salty. My partner's tomato and mozz panini was alright, but overpowered by a huge serving of sun-dried tomatoes. He ended up picking 1/2 of them off. The layout of this place is weird too. The drink area is right across from the trash station, so crowds form waiting to do their thing... in the meantime, the same aisle is where customers are funneled after ordering, and where they pick up food. It was crowded and people were doing a lot of shuffling. I digress... the food just isn't that special, especially considering the price. I paid $10 for a small 1/2 sandwich, and a tiny cup of soup, with a fountain drink on the side.

It was a pile of disgusting, butter-soaked mush.  When the server rudely commented \\"I guess you don't like vegetables\\" as she took my plate, I responded in my most friendly voice that nope, I don't like frozen bagged vegetables that are so overcooked they're disgusting.  She didn't respond.  \\n\\nFish and chips.  The fish was fresh.  It was breaded not battered, which was odd but fine.  The fries tasted like they were from a snackbar somewhere.

Again, fine for a cheap meal, but when you're charging more and claiming to be upscale, at least cut and cook your own freaking potatoes.\\n\\nWe asked for the check and it came pretty quickly, along with a \\"it was nice meeting you guys\\" from the server.  We put our card down and waited.  And waited and waited and waited.  The hostess came over and without saying anything, reached across the table to light a candle.  She didn't bother to ask us how our meal had been.  She didn't bother to take our clearly visible credit card.  So we waited some more.  And some more and some more.  Finally our server came and took the check without a word.  She brought the receipt in silence too.  I guess we'd already said our goodbyes, and she was no longer interested in pleasantries.\\n\\nAll in all, it was just a bad meal and we won't go back.  Service was bad, management was bad, food was bad, prices were high.  People here on Yelp have complained about the decor.  It's the only thing I wouldn't recommend they change immediately if they want to survive - they have bigger potatoes to fry."},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Love it.

While the food is a notch above similar places (think Chili's, Applebees, etc), the major strength is the bar area. Yes, their menu has some BBQ goodies and descent food but the bar is the main attraction.\\n\\nRight smack in the middle of the restaurant it isn't an afterthought, instead it's prominently displayed with TVs all around and a comfy setup. The staff is also great, first time I went the waitress took her time to chat with us and tell us what she really recommended on the menu. Last time I went, I was with two friends who have been here a couple of times and the waitress, Erica, knew their names and remembered what they had ordered last time they were in. Then she turned and asked me for my name - when's the last time a waitress or bartender asked you for your name at a chain restaurant?\\n\\nAs something of a beer snob I have to say I enjoy their draft beer selection with some imports like Heineken and Guinness and also some craft beers (including a draft made only for the chain). \\n\\nIf you're looking for a spot that has everything you want in a sports bar but is not as rowdy and has better food then I'd recommend giving this place a try."},{"name":"Maudie‚Äôs Hacienda","address":"9911 Brodie Ln, Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Go to the Taco Bell next door.

I figured maybe it was just this one time I ordered the wrong thing and planned on going again before I put my review in.\\n\\nNevertheless, I went a 2nd time and ordered the taco plate.  How can they screw this up?  Well, the Chef served the taco plate up in those pre-made taco shells (same ones from Taco Bell) threw ground beef in it, 3 slivers of cheese, burnt side of beans and charged me $12.00.  I took 2-3 bites, couldn't stomach it anymore so I just ate 3 baskets of chips to fill up and get my moneys worth.\\n\\nIn summary, they are over priced for the horrible food.

I don't remember a lot of details due to the amount of alcohol imbibed, but I know I had the pub burger, and I remember it being absolutely delicious. I also remember everyone raving about their food.\\n\\nMy second visit (this one, without my wife) was for one of the pig roasts. For $20, you get a small plate of ribs, collard greens, some black eyed peas, a piece of cornbread, a small dessert and a choice of beer or soda. A pretty great deal - but the ribs are a little on the small side. I know it's kind of implied being a pig roast - but there is no alternative option for non-meat-eaters. I'm not sure the kitchen is serving anything else during the roasts.\\n\\nOur visit last night was a belated birthday dinner for myself. They're closed on Sunday and Monday, so we had to put off dinner there until they were open. I asked a friend who dines there regularly if he thought I needed reservations for a weeknight. He said no. He was wrong. \\n\\nWe showed up at about 7pm. The hostess told us the dining room was booked until 8:30pm, but we could sit at the open seating bar and still eat off the full menu. There were, however, no seats left. We stood at the side for a few moments deciding what to do. I guess the hostess saw how dejected we looked and took pity on us. She squeezed us in at a small table.\\n\\nThe menu changes from time to time, but they seem to have at least a few items that are mainstays. While I loved the burger before, I wanted to try something different. I went with the steak frites, while my wife got the swordfish.  Of course, we started off with the gruyere biscuits and ordered a couple of drinks to go with it all. I had a \\"Old Fashioned\\" which is a bacon infused bourbon with a bacon garnish. My wife ordered a bloody mary, which our waitress said was very tomatoe-y and made with some sort of pickled fruit.\\n\\nThe \\"Old Fashioned\\" was good, tasting mostly of the orange. The bloody mary - not so good. The waitress said, when she brought it, that it seemed to have been made different tonight. Barely any tomato taste and woefully unseasoned. The biscuits were extra cheesey though - and delicious.\\n\\nOur entrees arrived. They looked fabulous. The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted great. The truffle fries were a bit salty, but we still could have eaten another order of them. My wife enjoyed her swordfish, but felt there were too many vegetables for the plate. A manager walking by asked her for her thoughts as it was a new dish and they were still testing it.\\n\\nWe didn't order dessert, but as we paid, the waitress said not to go anywhere, and returned with two half-bite size morsels of dessert - a peanut butter brownie. \\n\\nSo, if everything was so great - why only 4 stars? I debated this for a long time last night - and the fact is that while it's all delicious and the service is great, it still feels expensive for what you get. Our bill came out to $80 last night, and to be honest - I was still hungry. Yes, we could have eaten and drank cheaper there (get well drinks instead of signature cocktails, get burgers or pasta instead of fish and steak), but if I get a steak that costs almost $30, I only want to be left wanting more because it was so great - not because it wasn't enough food."},{"name":"Cafe Canela","address":"9070 Research Blvd, Ste 303","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We visit Cafe Canela very regularly and the food is ALWAYS great.

It's the best Mexican food I have ever had--I don't typically even like most Mexican food, whereas I love this place! They focus on fresh, local ingredients and their food is cooked in a traditional way from their region of Mexico: amazing roasted potatoes, fish tacos with just a sprinkling of cheese, lots of delicious veggies, cooked cactus, corn tortillas handmade from fresh masa, etc. Abundant handmade nachos are brought out as a free appetizer, and are served with a special, delicious salsa that they also sell in mason jars. And they serve great beer from a local company called La Familia whose proceeds partly benefit Portand-area immigrant communities.\\n\\nI have many dietary restrictions, so it's often hard to find things I can eat, but there are various things on Conin's menu that I love. My restrictions are no gluten, dairy, or sugar/sweeteners; to others with similar diets, I highly recommend the fish tacos with guacamole substituted for the cheese and cream. I'm also able to eat the salsa, which isn't too spicy and which I love; and the side dish of roasted potatoes that come with several entrees are a must-have.\\n\\nAlong with the quality of Conin's food, their service is also great. Staff are friendly, and Ivan, the owner, is often around and sometimes comes to check on people and chat. The ambiance is casual--a TV playing Mexican channels, a bar, and music creating a din just right for conversation.

Cheese plate- had several varieties of cheese as well as some yummy jam. Only complaint was that it only came with 3 crackers/toasts, but we had plenty of free bread to use instead. \\n3. Beet/arugula/goat cheese salad- super fresh and the dressing was vinegary and perfect. \\n4. Fried calamari- cooked perfectly. Had an interesting breading on it that I have never had before on calamari. Came with an aioli dipping sauce that was very tasty.\\n5. Paella- today's paella was the Barlata Paella, which has a ton of seafood, veggies, and a red sauce. It was very tasty. Almost ordered more but it was pricier than the other dishes at 7$ a pop. \\n6. Octopus and shrimp ceviche- this was one of my favorites. The octopus was prepared beautifully. Again, not enough crackers served with this but we had plenty of bread. \\n7. Chorizo in wine sauce- Very tasty. Came with mashed potatoes that were really good. \\n8. Catalan toast with Serrano ham- This was my favorite item. Thick bread with delicious thin shaved, cured Serrano ham dressed with a garlicky olive oil. Could've eaten several more plates of this. \\n9. Patatas bravas- fried potatoes with aioli and tomato sauce. So so so good. Perfectly greasy and salty and amazing. \\n\\nBetween the three of us, we each spent about 15 dollars including tip, which I think is a great deal.

My dad is a double amputee..we need to park in a handicap parking. When going to park today all spaces were full so we waited a bit.  My mom noticed that there was a car with no handicap parking tags parked in the parking stall... that's a problem within its self but that's not why this place lost a star.. \\n\\nThere was a person sitting in the car( let me say that the place was semi crowded and there wasn't many spots open)\\nMy mom went in and asked to speak to the manager. The manager rudely said that they can't help where people park and that they can't get us a parking so we might as well just take our food to go....\\n\\nThat comment really bothered me.

The luffa gave this too much of a fresh feeling, not what we expected in a steamed dumpling. \\n2) Pork and shrimp shiumai - excellent! An artistic rendition of a traditional dumpling.\\n3) Basa fish in chili sauce with vegetables - very flavorful. We added the vegetables to the fish on the menu and it turned out well. The mushrooms in the dish were particularly good. \\n4) Fried noodles with seafood - pretty good. There was a slight sweetness to this wok fried dish. \\n\\nThe service was a bit slow at first (they took a while to take our order), but the food came out quickly.  Everything came out at once, which was not ideal.  We would have preferred that the dim sum come out first, followed by the mains, so each item could be eaten hot.

We had some time to kill before our friends arrived and opted for Tuscan Kitchen instead of some bar food.\\n\\nMy initial reaction to this restaurant was confusion, and I left feeling the same way. Here is why:\\n1. Entrance: Unclear entrance with foot traffic going to the movie theater and bowling. You never really walk into the restaurant. I think the exterior part is supposed to be more casual, seat yourself, but it wasn't casual enough and there wasn't any guidance. Alas, we claimed some seats at the side bar and asked a waiter if it was ok if we sat there.\\n2. Vibe: It feels like Tuscan Kitchen has an identity crisis. We definitely weren't dressed in nice dining clothing by any means, but it's not clear to me even now if that was ok. It seems like they want to be a place where you need to dress up more, but also quite welcoming. I appreciate a place that pull this off aesthetically and am definitely not opposed to this concept, but was confused by the goals of TK here.\\n3. Food: It is difficult to truly judge the food ordered when it comes out at suboptimal temperatures. We ordered two things from appetizer menu because didn't have a ton of time -  the arrancini & the large meatball. The food came out in five minutes and both items were borderline cold. It was clear that this was prepped ahead of time and just delivered when we ordered.\\nSauce - pretty bland and uneventful\\nBread - SO GOOD couldn't get over it. Best part of night.\\nWine - good, could've used more help ordering and took a while to come.\\n4. Cuisine: I am not an Italian food expert, but the menu was definitely a generic Italian menu and not truly focused on the nuances of Tuscan cuisine. I think they have a great opportunity to distinguish in this way but aren't using it.\\n5. Prices: quite expensive, especially for what we received.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the food was disappointing given the price, and definitely did not give much reason to return. Maybe we should give it another chance in the dining room, but it is certainly not near the top of the list in the near future."},{"name":"Ginger Exchange Symphony","address":"250 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Today, I ordered a plate of Pineapple fried rice with pork and a plate of Mee Goreng beef.

It is not like I don't walk by (more like near) it almost everyday on my quest for a tasty lunch.  This changed on Monday only because someone else suggested it we go there for lunch.  The food was ok.  A little bland and a little too filling.  I am now thinking after reading Liz K.'s review that the filling feeling I got is from crazy amount of butter in the rice.  Not a huge drink selection unlike every other takeout place in the area.  But the guys behind the counter were nice and joked with us.

One night it's trivia, most nights its music that ranges from bad to unbearable (well, to me anyways. It's usually pretty full so I guess some people disagree).\\n\\nI live a stone's throw away, and the music is quite loud.

Meh.\\n\\nI typically order a filet mignon cooked medium because I like tender pieces of meat and do not like fatty cuts. I believe that any good steakhouse should be able to cook a mean filet; Fleming's falls short - very short - in quality meat and execution. Both times I have been there the steaks have been very fatty, stringy, and the texture in general off - a poor cut. The steak should be seared before cooking to seal in the juices and flavor, the Fleming's steak was completely bland. I requested some Madeira sauce to try to add some flavor, but that didn't help much. The garlic mashed potatoes I ordered seemed to be completely lacking garlic and they were dry.\\n\\nMy husband ordered one of their specialties, the peppercorn steak, and described it as being \\"not a very high quality meat\\" and also complained his steak had an odd texture. The mushrooms he ordered as a side were \\"not as good as Ruth's Chris\\".

However, when  we were ready to order  we start to ask for certain things on the menu the waitress then told us as we asked for item that literally 2 pages on the menu  were not available as one of their ovens was broken. Instead of making us a decision on what we wanted upfront we should have been told what items were not available that night.  Finally we ordered  a  chicken with french fries dish  for our daughter then for us a bread and chicken also Shrimp dish.  Our daughter order came out promptly and seem to be very sufficient.

It began with a cocktail, the Elderflower Raspberry Sour. Delicious! While we waited for our appetizers we enjoyed the complimentary fresh French bread, olive oil and tapenade spread they offer. Then my wife delighted in her fresh beet salad while I devoured the seared scallop appetizer. The scallops were very flavorful, though slightly overcooked. Next came the main courses and they were all fantastic. I enjoyed the \\"Fundy\\" salmon dish while my wife tried the Cod and my uncle the risotto. Everyone was very pleased with their dishes. We ended with cappuccinos and chocolate pot de creme. My only complaint would be the music. When we first arrived it was a pleasant mix of classical, but at some point they began play house dance music. It was entirely out of place in this beautiful, relaxing dining hall. After a while, the incessant thumping of the beats mixed with the repeating bass line grew quite tiresome. I have visited Miel once before and they did not play this kind of music the first time. Perhaps it's a Friday night thing?

In a recent Globe & Mail interview, famous Chef Vikram Vij says \\"I'm sick of Indian food\\" ... and it certainly shows! I'm sick of his food too! You know how sometimes something is just so very bad that it comes back full circle and ends up being so good? This is not that. Good taste is diametrically opposed to Vij's. This is not Indian whatsoever. A good Indian resto may or may not cater to non-vegetarian patrons but in any case it full well needs needs needs to have excellent vegetarian items. \\"Ahimsa\\" is the Sanskrit term for the ancient philosophy of non-violence. And goddamn if my tastebuds and sensibilities weren't assaulted and offended. As a racially ambiguous and post-race individual with a mixed ethnocultural heritage; half Indo-Guyanese-Canadian and half Qu√©b√©cois-French-Canadian ... and having had Indian food in (to name a few places) my Indian grandmother's kitchen in Montr√©al, restos in Montr√©al, Boston, NYC, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Bangkok, Tokyo, Greenville S.C., London, Amsterdam and all around Northern India for like six weeks and having cooked Indian food for myself, my friends and my family since I was like fourteen years old ... I think I can definitively proclaim that this is not Indian cuisine whatsoever. It is more like pretentious pseudo haute cuisine √† la fran√ßaise; a type of failed fusion involving some stale spices, bland lifeless portions and little effort. It might walk like a duck, it might talk like a duck but it's a chicken. Well, my fine feathered friends, the case with Vij's is exactly the opposite of anything delicious. While the toilet is spotlessly clean and the wine glasses are nice and the ambiance is okay but kinda loud  ... the food is meh. Vij's is beyond the hype. The hype waited two hours for a seat, finally got a table, chewed this place up, took some strong antacids and subsequently had violent gastroenteritis. I wholeheartedly affirm that Vij's probably at one point had a soul and was indeed a \\"real boy\\" ... but that was once upon a time ... that was before it sold its soul (and its ability to make good food) in a Faustian stroke of treachery in exchange for some paltry C-list notoriety. I'm sure the food was good when there was a place on Broadway but the hype burned it all to the ground. The hype killed it dead. The hype killed everything good about this place. Frankly, I'm embarrassed on behalf of Vij's, on behalf of Vancouver and on behalf of Canada and the CBC. There is such good, damned good, Indian cuisine in Vancouver. Isn't Vij's supposed to be one of the best Indian restos in the entire world? Nope, no Michelin stars here. Vij's just brings a knife to a gunfight. It brings a puerile scratch and an infantile pull of the hair, you know ... like a bottle rocket, to an all out Cold War style ICBM arms race. Seriously. This would be a total travesty if we didn't have the ghost of Christmas future to deal with. That ghost of Christmas future ... she wasn't a ghost, she was actually real; you never knew her name but she did make your iPhone when she was five years old ... with her small hands and big suffering in a Chinese sweatshop. Enough suffering; Indian food is supposed to envelop you in a sensuously warming glow of perfectly balanced flavour. It is ancient, nuanced, inclusive and scrumptious. It is the true and tested culinary science of spice. Indian food leaves you satiated and fulfilled. Vij's on the other hand ... gives you heartburn. Heartburn! Go to any five dollar Indian hole-in-the-wall in Vancouver and you'll have a delicious, filling and oh so wonderful meal ... without heartburn. But at Vij's you'll spend 250$ and it doesn't matter what you order ... you'll be served a ghastly and flavourless concoction of oiliness. There is a dearth of choice with the vegetarian options. The only thing worth eating here is the free amuse-bouche that they serve while you wait for two hours ... also the chai and mango lassi as well as their highballs are good. I love cardamom in any form. So, the food was meh. Please, please, just go elsewhere. Go to Chutney Villa on Broadway and Main or Annapurna on 4th Avenue or House of Dosas on Kingsway or Saravana Bhavana in the Toronto area or Thanjai in Montr√©al. Anybody that has the gall to wait in line for this food whilst exercising common sense and acknowledging the multitude masses of humanity the world over for whom poverty and malnourishment are simply second nature...are yellow bellied posers with the intestinal fortitude of lily-livered chicken shits. Instead of standing in line here ... volunteer at your local InSite, take a stand and protest against institutional inaction concerning murdered and missing First Nations women in the Downtown Eastside and across Canada, build a home or bring clean drinking water to the Attawapiskat First Nation, go to Darfur and build a well or try to raise awareness about the global pandemic of violence against women.

I reserved a table for 6 of us, the restaurant was tiny, but had a nice ambiance to it and by the time we got there it was full. (I would say there is probably only room for around 20 people max).  It took the server about 15 minutes to get to our drinks order and then another 10 to take our food order.  We ordered oysters, seafood chowder, salmon and a few steamer pots. \\nWe were just chatting amongst ourselves for the next 30 minutes (no sign of food) around this time we all smelled weed coming from the kitchen. We found it kind of comical and joked about getting \\"special oysters\\". Anyway, about 45 minutes went by with everyone beginning to get very hungry. Still no sign of food. The server comes up to us at this point, apologizes and says the oysters will be along in around 10 minutes but the rest of the food will be a long time (come again???) We had already been waiting for 45 minutes! \\n\\nI tried to catch the servers attention to order some more wine- she snapped and said she'd get to me in a minute. When she took the wine order I asked if we could have some bread and she said we would have to wait 20 minutes if we wanted any. I don't understand how picking up a baguette and putting it on a plate can take 20 minutes but whatever. \\n\\nOur oysters finally came about an hour after ordering, yay! They came with a nice selection of sauces and I have to admit, they were good. The rest of the food came about 20 minutes after that, great, except we had no cutlery. We tried to get the servers attention but to no avail, the server ignored us and went into the kitchen so we flagged down the chef/busser/dishwasher (I don't know who he was), and actually asked him for cutlery. The server popped her head out of the kitchen as we were trying to get service from this guy (**awkward**) and then she went to fetch our cutlery. \\nMy friend liked the look of my chowder and asked if he could order a bowl, for which the server responded \\"it will be at least 20 minutes\\" -we were getting quite used to that response.\\n\\nSo yay! We finally had our food, you would think it would be plain sailing from now on right? Wrong. As we were just getting started on our long awaited food, a group of around 6 people showed up at the door, having reserved our table. Luckily we were given time to finish our food and wine, but only just - We were handed the bill, which included a 17%service (service??) charge, and then pretty much told we had to get out to make room for the other people that had reserved our table. \\n\\nI have to say it's a shame because this place has potential- I love the venue, it has a nice intimate, cozy  feel to it.  The oysters were good, my chowder was delicious, my friends enjoyed their steamer pots and the salmon. It's just the service was horrendous. It wasn't really the servers fault, she was run off her feet - although she could have dealt with the situation better. I use to be a server and would never have snapped at customers or waited 45 minutes to tell someone their food was going to be a while! You can't help being busy but you can help how you communicate with your patrons.\\n\\nI put this down to very bad management, they were just too under staffed. Maybe this was a one-off but I don't think so, I overheard the server talking to people at the bar saying Monday nights are always like this because of the wine deal.

Let me begin with a few things just to set the climate:\\n1. I hope this review gets to the management department and even to corporate. \\n2. I waited two weeks to write this review because I was so disappointed.\\n3. People go to Chick-Fil-A for consistency and customer service. \\n\\nLet's start with the line- not a problem at all, I 100% understand that CFA will have long lines, plus being in the busiest airport in the US, I decided it was worth the wait to get food that I could count on during a long trek from the Northeast to the Southwest. The line supervisor was very friendly and helpful, moving the line diligently to open cashiers. With my luck, I got the most disengaged young man I have ever had (not just CFA might I add), when I asked two questions he said, it's not up there is it? I said, fair, maybe a bad day or he didn't want to be at work after the holiday. After placing my order with no eye contact from this young man, I waited for my food. It was pretty simple, a CFA sandwich meal with a large order of French fries. When my meal came out, I still didn't have my drink, so I asked the young man, could I get my drink. No reply, he grabbed a cup and got my drink. I went to my table, opened my bad and had a medium order of fries.  had I had great service, I would have let it be, but I decided, I would ask a complete stranger to watch my belongings while I go back to the counter to see if these team had any remorse for the error. The line supervisor was very nice and told me to keep my current order of fries as she told the kitchen manager about the situation to get me new fries and the rights size. The kitchen manager said who has the fries and I raised the bag and of course I got a nasty look. By this time I got the fries and walked to my gate. \\n\\nLet me say this, I've never had this kind of service from CFA. I'm a national recruiter and every event I put on at college campuses I order CFA, well I can tell you, I will give it a second thought now. I didn't get a my pleasure, I didn't get a smile, I didn't get eye contact, hell I didn't even get my order correct. \\n\\nOne thing I've always respected about CFA is that, any location you go to you get the same product and service. Not here! I love that CFA sticks to what their founder envisioned- great customer service, great food and give your staff Sunday off to be with their family. I think many businesses could learn from Sam Truett Cathy ( and yes I know the whole story of CFA without googling it all the way to their conservative contributions). \\n\\nThis team needs some help and attitude adjustments. It's the holiday time, easy to be frustrated at work but also easy to remember your 'why' even when it's difficult. I really wish to speak to that young man, because I started as a young man (15 years old) working at a pizza place, and because of my customer focus, has afforded me so many opportunities and blessings at a young age. You never know who is watching you and could be the next person to help you in your career. \\n\\nI want to end with this- the food was good and fresh. For this CFA site, please keep customer service at your core. CFA is a great company and we all get busy at work and have tough days. For the young man, I wish you many blessings and if something was distracting you that day, it's all good.

I grew up eating hella sandwiches from the chain and often catch a craving for that weird smelling bread and processed white cheese, not to mention that since I went vegetarian it's often the most convenient option when a brother is in a hurry. Given those factors, it should be pretty easy to please me. All I want is a Veggie Delite on whole wheat with extra cheese and A LOT of cucumber. That's not difficult, but this location PERPETUALLY skimps on toppings on the veggie sub,  which is infuriating considering the fact that it costs the same as a Meatball or Tuna sandwich. Look, I feel that if I'm paying the same amount as I would for meat, I should get an equivalent amount of vegetables to compensate. Most Subways are pretty cool with it when I'm like \\"Load that sub with Cucumber friend\\", they'll straight hook a dude up with a mound of greens or whatever.

Yep, no problem she said. You are also welcome to use the lounge if it is more comfortable. No thanks, I said, I'd rather catch a few minutes of the bruins game.  No problem, she said. Bar is pretty quiet, I tuck myself in the corner, out of the way of everyone. The bartender comes up and chats, we talk about different beers and then he brings me a nice IPA. I start casually sipping when about 5 minutes later, a different hostess comes over and says sternly, sir, I need you to move. Pardon me? I said politely. Yes we need you to move right now, you cannot be sitting here with a baby (granted she is in a car seat sleeping and completely covered). Ok, no problem I said, where can I move? Sir, you need to move over there (points to the seats directly behind me in the same bar area). I told her I had just talked to the other hostess and she said this was fine. No sir you need to move to those other seats now. I try to hold back my befuddled grin and quickly look around for Ashton Kutcher, convinced I am on some type of prank reality show.

The next two drinks we got were the coconut mojito and the paloma - two more really great cocktails.\\n\\nThroughout the meal, the waitress checked back on us, refilled our chips, got us water, asked if we needed anything. Additionally, the owner, Eric (at least I think he's the owner) dropped by to see how everything was, ask how we liked the place, etc. He was super friendly and receptive. When we left, he even stuck his head out the front door to say goodbye to us and thank us for coming in.

Potatoes in the duck  kofta were all but raw. The kofta were practically half sun flower seed, yielding an unappealing texture. (Credit to the house for removing this from the tab).

It was a great experience! We arrived at around 12 PM during the day of the Red Sox parade so it was somewhat bustling. We grabbed a high-top table right by the window, so you know what that means! Yep, stellar foodie pictures- yay for natural sunlight!! \\n\\nI started with the Pineapple Crush drink- a non-boozy refresher comprised of pineapple puree, lime, and soda. It was fizzy, sweet, and delicious! Its taste was watered down pretty quickly, so be sure to ask for light ice. I had the Thai Zucchini Noodle Bowl as my entree. It had cauliflower, roasted + salted butternut squash, edamame, zucchini shreds, shiitake mushrooms and cashews on top of a bed of noodles. There was an abundance of coconut curry! Yum! I really liked this bowl. The butternut squash was a delight- it was a bit saltier than I expected, but it added pops of flavor. Every addition tasted SO fresh. The coconut curry was rich, fragrant, and yummy. The dish's only flaw: the watered-down taste at the end of the bowl. I don't think they completely drained the water from the noodles, and as a result, the curry flavor was diluted at the bottom.\\n\\nI had a bit of their Plant Burger patty, which was soooo delicious! It might've been one of the best veggie patties I've ever tasted! Flavorful and not too mushy. :- ) The tater tots that came with the burger were FANTASTIC. Seasoned to perfection with a mild crunch. \\n\\nWhen the parade ended a whole crowd showed up, but that didn't stop the quality service. Every staff member was chipper and kind!

Tons of dishes for $4-7 of varying size.  For 2 people I'd recommend ordering 5-6 dishes off Happy Hour menu and a few drinks and you'll be good.  House wines were just that - house.  Olives were a pass and quite a small dish.  Tasty but not even worth $3.  Paella extremely tiny for $7 but a nice sample of what to expect if we go back and opt for a traditional size.  Nice crispy rice on the bottom and a few pieces of seafood.  Bravas potatoes quite tasty and would be perfect as a brunch accompaniment.  Calamari solid and tiny portioned.  Really good if you like a more citrusy rendition.  The jamon toast was my favorite.  $4 gets you two pieces of toast with tomatoes and more than expected ham.  Really good dish.

At 5:00pm we were still not seated. Finally at 5:15pm we were seated. Servers were  very good and we placed our order. All but 3 ordered  the Turkey. Food was brought out and the portions were absolutey the saddest portions I have ever seen and 5 out of the 8 plates did not have stuffing and the 3 who did get it got about a tablespoon of stuffing. We asked for stuffing for the 5 who did not get it and was told they ran out Sorry. We ate and then ordered desserts. Our choices we were given  was pumpkin cheesecake or a special  apple critter or crunch something.  Waiting for our desserts which 9 ordered the apple crisp whatever a manager came over and says I am sorry but we ran out of the apple  dessert but we can offer you something else. Our friend George Roma paid the entire bills which was about $1000.00 if you count $100.00 at the bar  and our food check for $694.00 and then the tip.  We had no idea he was paying the entire bill which made us feel worse that he spent about $1000.00 on a bill worth about total $300.00.

My girlfriend and me happen to yelp the area our hotel was in and found this place. Arriving at the restaurant we walked into a dead looking place. Only a few other tables were filled and the bar was pretty empty. This was definitely deceiving, after eating here I couldn't understand why it wasn't busier. We got chips and salsa along with our drinks fairly quick. The chips cone in a cone shaped holder with two sides of salsa. One big negative for me is that you only get one FREE order of chips. The salsa that comes with this chips was pretty good. It didn't taste like it was from a jar like some places. After reviewing the menu with my date we decided to share the fajitas. Our waiter said they were \\"Shareable\\" and put in a extra order for tortillas for us. Pretty much right after we ordered a giant skillet of steaming hot fajitas comes barreling out of the kitchen. This was the biggest negative of my whole dining experience. I hate when food comes out immediately after ordering, I like to enjoy my time dining. Back to the food, the toppings for the fajitas were all fresh looking. It came with the standard stuff like, guac, sour cream, pico, and lettuce. It was kinda disappointing seeing the portion of guac, especially for two people to share. On to that steaming hot skillet, it was very good. Came with lots of chicken and veggies and it was more than enough for two people to share. So we ended up saving money by only paying for one meal and a side of tortillas. In the end, we both left full and satisfied. If I can change anything about the meal it would have been the time the food came out. I know its Mexican, but come on! Slow it down a little! \\n\\nOverall, if you're in the area looking for something Mexican. Check this place out.

Though I love Chick-fil-A I wanted to sit down and get some southern type food. When you walk in the restaurant it is a lot bigger than it seems however since it was lunch time the place was packed and you have to seat yourself. So in doing that it takes a waiter a little bit of time to get to your table because it's so busy. When the waiter finally made his way over to my table it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks in about 15 minutes to be able to order the food. This was a little disappointing since I was on a one hour lunch break. I ordered the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans.¬† They were ot of Half the sides.¬† It took of the order about 17 minutes to get out to the table. The waiter said the hold up was because we had food from the grill but nothing we ordered came from the grill. Everything we got was Fried or roast beef which was not from the grill (not to mention it was a lunch special so they should have plenty of it).¬† Additionally we asked for the check when the food came and it still took another 10 minutes for the waiter to get us our checks and checkout. Needless to say I couldn't really enjoy the taste of the food due to having to eat very fast to make it back to work on time (barely).¬† Maybe dinner is a better time to go or a later lunch time?"},{"name":"Suerte","address":"1800 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Worth the hype!

My friends and I called it \\"The Bean\\", (Not to be confused with The Bean in Mesilla, which I Yelped about during the Las Cruces chapter of The Shoehead Chronicles.) I always just seemed to prefer it to Starbucks during my L.A. tenure.\\nSo the first time I availed myself of the Northwest Austin 'Bean', was during my experience with my new tire at Discount Tires, right across the parking lot.\\nthis location had an old familiar feel to it (about 8 years have past since my last visit to 'The Bean'), and I was greeted by the affable Kiki. I explained my quandry--as a coffee fanatic, and a fan of CB&TL, I really wanted a huge, steaming cup of hi-test joe; BUT as a newly-minted cardiac patient, I needed a *gasp* DECAF...  In my coffee dogma, decaf is sacriledge--with no real reason to even exist--but I guess as a placebo for the hi-test, it would have to suffice. I implored the affable Kiki, \\"Do you have a decaf that doesn't suck?\\" to which she gave me a sample of a decaf that kinda did suck. So, with Kiki's consultation, we agreed to go \\"half-caff\\". Problem solved, and I headed to the fixin's bar for all kinds of fancy doo-dads to put in my half-lame coffee. There was a great array of fancies to jazz up the joe with--cayenne pepper, kosher salt, white chocolate, dark chocolate, cinnamon, you name it. I poured some white chocolate powder and some yummy clover honey, and my \\"compromise\\" drink actually turned out pretty well! \\nSo I'm happy.

I can buy bootleg dvds in Chinatown with Visa, but not food and beverage in Harvard Square?\\n- All they have is regular sized boba. No mini boba. No pudding. No lychee jelly. Back in the bay, I almost never get regular boba anymore. \\n- They show random TV shows on their flat screen, with the sound inaudible, pretty much wasting the fact that its there. Flat screens at boba joints are supposed to play music videos or Asian movies or at least something other than silent Law & Order. \\n- No food except for the mediocre dumplings. Where's the popcorn chicken? Where's the fried squid? No waffles or any desert food either?Where's any sort of food which is half the reason I usually go to boba places.\\n- They're selection of magazines and games is subpar. \\n- The place doesn't have enough seating, and the seats are like old school wooden classroom seats. I guess it's harvard-esque but there are no big comfy couches or anything like that, which make it not the most comfortable place to chill. Which maybe is because they don't want ppl chilling there because the place is too small to fit that many pl anyways. \\n- It seems bland and sterile inside. Pale green and white are the only colors. But maybe I'm just comparing it to the bright orange and blue of Tapioca Express.\\n- There's nothing fobby and fun about this place at all. It seems incredibly stripped of the fobby background from which boba comes from. I'm all about inclusion, but the place is not Asian enough (accordingly, Wagamama is right across the street). At any given time, a random white person whose never seen a boba place could walk in and not know that boba is an Asian thing. Maybe that sums up a lot of what I've been talking about. Boston Tea Stop is a fake, plastic, stripped of fobby-ness boba place that reinforces my general feeling that there is no strong Asian-American presence in Boston.\\n\\nStill 3 stars since there drinks are pretty good, and their boba is reliably the right consistency.

Clever idea but could use a little work on the execution.  My food was delicious. The tomato soup was tied for my favorite with another local restaurant in SW.

I've never felt like such an inconvenience or less welcomed from these people . I'll be the first to say that customer service isn't a job that just anyone can fill and As someone who takes such pride in that position it breaks my soul to have to continue being treated so terribly by this establishment. Rude is an understatement ! I've been going there for over 3 yrs and after so long you would think I would have given up on them by now , but dining out is a luxury that not everyone can afford and my dollar always went a long way where food was concerned. I have tough skin and a big heart and I always hope next time will be different so I've given them the benefit of the doubt until now . The entire staff lack personality, professionalism, and any kind of care towards providing exceptional guest service . There was one gentleman today , the youngest male on staff who by the grace of god approached us with a smile and provided us with waters while I watched our server sit down to have himself lunch while we remained unattended, ignored and forgotten. Every thing we asked seemed to bother him, we had to ask for everything we needed to share and eat our meals which seemed to bother him even more . A previoustime I invited a friend with me to eat dinner and while we were finishing our desserts, my seat was faced towards the t.v , it was pushing towards closing time with time still to spare and spoon in mouth , check already paid , tip already given , our server pointed the remote to the t.v and literally powered it off . MIND BLOWN at the nerve she had and how comfortable she was with being that nasty to rush us out . Today while our server was still MIA our check was dropped off by another nasty staff member who proceeded to pull out the cash in the book and count the money bill by bill while she placed it on our table right in front of us . Needless to say I left 0$ dollars for tip and instead provided a generous one to the young man who graced us with not only a smile but attentiveness in the absence-of our  poor excuse of a server and it's poor excuse of a business.

It took forever to just get drinks and then another 45 minutes to an hour to receive our food. I do have to say that we did not call before we headed over there and they did accommodate us quickly. However, I still feel that with such a big party they should have done more to get us out of the way of other customers. We were squished between the restrooms and the bar. I got bumped so many times by waiters and customers headed to the bar or restroom that I lost count. In addition to where we were, there is the matter of our tables, they were miss matched sizes. 4 people out of a group of 13 were sitting with a plate that was 2 inches lower than there drink because there was just not enough room. I do have to say again, they did get our tables together quickly and they were very nice while arranging everything. As far as the food goes, I have had better and I have had worse.

Gyoza is a must everytime I go for ramen and I do judge the place based on how much I like it.\\n\\nTheir gyoza, It's one of those deep fried ones, not the pan fried gyoza (or at least that's what I think). Tasted like a typical gyoza with nothing more or special to say. Moving on to chashu bowl, this was very very disappointing. Honestly, I havent had chashu this bad in a while; tasteless and rubbery. Gave one to my friend and barely finished mine, when I got my kanji ramen and noticed it was the same chashu I just took it out of my ramen bowl and said \\"out you go\\". And now the signature kanji ramen, it's a tonkotsu ramen with soy based broth. The broth has the traditional tonkotsu flavor to it but also some mushroom ish flavor (I doubt its mushroom though), which is quite unique and I enjoyed it.  Noodles are your traditional Japanese ramen noodle with firm texture, not the straight or thin noodles. The bowl came with chashu, ajitama, wood ear mushroom, grilled corn, bakchoi, nori, fried garlic, bamboo and kuromayu.\\nNow I'm not going to pick on what needs to be or not in their ramen, especially since this is a signature ramen for them, but corn and bakchoi was definitely an interesting choice. Actually I enjoyed the bakchoi, it went pretty well with the broth. Ajitama though, I've had better, hell I've made some better tasting than that. \\n\\nThe server didnt seem enthusiastic about his job but the chef did come out and check on every table(which was really nice). \\n\\nHonestly if you want to try something different, come over and try the kanji ramen. If I ever do come back, I'll give regular tonkotsu a try but I do hope they do something to that chashu because it is not attractive."},{"name":"Souper Salad","address":"209 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Salad bar/deli/convenience store combos are so common in New York City, its nice to see a home grown variety in Boston.

We have always enjoyed the excellent, authentic traditional Italian food, and even the truly old-school decor. We went there recently as a group to celebrate a special occasion, and while the food was as we remembered it, we received truly poor service. The server taking care of our table was slow to appear at first. Because of the delay, we were already prepared to order appetizers when he arrived for our drink order. He began to walk away before even giving us an opportunity to do that and acted annoyed when we politely asked him to wait a moment so we could order those. The appetizers and drinks were brought fairly quickly; however, the server who was actually taking orders for our table did not reappear for an inexplicably long time. We had to flag him down. When he did appear, he gave no explanations about the menu--odd, since we had a group of 12 people and doing so likely would have saved him some time and trouble--and when he went to take orders, he was extremely curt and rushed each person, actually making a \\"speed it up\\" motion with his hand if the person did not order quickly enough. Servers there customarily ask what type of pasta one wants as a side. Not only did he not do that (and a few in our group did not even know there were other options), but he had to be hailed back again so we could make those requests. His rudeness was so egregious that one in our party actually had to ask him to speak with respect, a request a polite patron at a restaurant never should have to make. HIs behavior was not confined to our table. We witnessed it at the table behind us as well. They had to flag him down for routine things like taking entree orders after appetizers are delivered. He also rushed them along and spoke to them the same way he did us. Even superlative food cannot compensate for the sour taste such behavior leaves behind. It stood out far more than the food, which is truly unfortunate."},{"name":"Congee Noodle House","address":"141 E Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We came here for dinner.

Once for karaoke, once for Sunday brunch. The service was amazing both times--we had quick, friendly waiters who knew how to do their job. \\n\\nThere was a fun crowd at karaoke, very supportive (when the music cut out during my Billy Joel solo, everyone joined in to help me finish the song).

I had french toast topped with Bailey's and raspberry coulis, my sister had the sausage and sundried tomato scramble, and my other sister (vegetarian) had the crab cake eggs benedict with the crab cake on the side (they listened to her request and made sure it wasn't touching her food at all). We got sides of grits and rosemary home fries and shared everything so I got to try it all. And everything impressed me except the crab cake, which was unlike any crab cake I've ever had and just weirded me out a little bit. I couldn't see the flaky crab meat without cutting into it; it looked more like a little cylinder of grilled chicken to me from the outside, like smooth instead of flaky. I could taste shrimp flavor when I took a bite. It wasn't necessarily bad, just weird. I asked the waiter what was in it and he said it was held together by a shrimp, egg, and mayo mousse, which explained the shrimp flavor, but not really the smooth outer layer. My sister (non-vegetarian) liked it though. \\n\\nAnyway, I may have been a bit harsh about the inadequacy of this place as an homage to James Joyce in my previous review.

But I was even more excited to find that it was a buffet hot pot! Usually, I find eating at Shabu Zen  or Kaze not worth the money. Hot pot is probably one of my favorite dishes but it could get a bit expensive for my thrifty taste. My hope for an all-you-can-eat hot pot place had previously vanished with the closing of the somewhat overpriced Jin's in Saugus. But alas, spring is here and hope springs anew with Buffet Hot Pot! The set up is not as extravagant as Jin's--- there are no buffet tables overflowing with everything one can possibly dip into hot steamy broth.  However, throw-away menus are provided so you can check off what you want--similar to the paper menus at a sushi joint and reminiscent of Little Q in Quincy. The offerings are more than decent here--- big clams, crab legs, scallops, lobster (for extra 7.95), fish balls, different grades of sliced beef, lamb, chicken, watercress, taro, and many more. The size of the cuts and quantity of the items are definitely above those at other hot pot places.  Shabuzen and Kaze are for pansies that don't like value and depend on the surrounding and atmosphere to make their food taste better. Buffet Hot Pot is above that trickery. Like other old school places, it doesn't depend on furnishing but the food itself to rope in eaters. For a decent price (14.95 for lunch, 19.95 for dinner), you get a good variety of food and leave feeling full for hours. We had the Mala (spicy hot) broth at our table, it was herbal and very good. If you like the different condiments for dipping (garlic, red chilli pepers), you will have to ask the waiter for them. We ordered the crab--delicious--you will have to use your hands but who cares, this isn't the Oak Room!  Actually, don't order this if you are the type to prefer food that comes in pretty packages without skin and bones from the supermarket--you'll end throwing out the top crab shell containing the delicious rich mustard. Opt for just the crab legs. The salmon was good and the white fish was surprisingly good. The clams were cherrystones, way better than the littleneck clams at Shabu Zen. The different meats were tasty and didn't come out somewhat frozen like I've experienced at Kaze (don't get me wrong, I used to love Kaze and I think they are still a good place).  The tofu was big and lovely--- I hate going to places where they give you tiny cubes of tofu-- here, they give you hefty square globs, love it! My eating partner's main gripe was that the scallops were imitation scallop but I don't think most regular diners will notice. I myself thought they were a different type of scallops but who really knows. Besides that, service was more or less efficient in that we didn't have to wait too long for plates to come out or get our water glasses refilled. Although they could definitely tighten up their operation--- some items we ordered did not come and we jokingly wondered if that was their game--- to \\"forget\\" to bring something out so that we don't end up eating them out of business. I hope that's not the case because I really think this is going to be my to go place for hot pot!\\n\\nBottom Line: Asian's Asian restaurant (i.e. you know how to eat (order things to your liking like the side condiments for dipping, how to eat a crab in public and not care about how you look, etc), you don't care for d√©cor, you don't want smiling waiters sucking up to you, you value abundance over presentation, and good food above all else)"},{"name":"Cathay Pacific Restaurant","address":"111 Hancock St","city":"North Quincy","stars":"3","text":"I dont even know how to put this.

My friend had arranged an outing with our kids, who ranged from ages 3-10years old.    Everything started out fine. We reserved two lanes, and everyone was having a great time.   Unfortunately both lanes malfunctioned probably a dozen times between the two of them. (If you're  competitive bowler, take note! you will lose your score and your pens will randomly reset)   Anyway, we were with kids, so no harm done, we weren't exactly keeping score.  We made the best of it.  The last time one of the lanes malfunctioned, two of the older kids in our group took it upon themselves to reset the lane  (they had seen the tech do it a number of times, so they mistakenly took matters into their own hands)  they were already half way down the lane when two of the parents in our group reprimanded their kids and told them to get off the ally.  The kids were totally in the wrong, I get it. They crossed the line.  It happened so fast.  I can confirm the parents were very proactive, and corrected the problem immediately.  And they were sincerely apologetic to the employee who addressed the group.   He accepted their apology (from both kids and parents ) and everything was settled.... Well,  the manager found out what happened, so 5 minutes after the incident,  she shut down the entire bowling ally,  lights, lanes, and computers, and then over the intercom, SHE WENT OFF on a two minute rant shaming the parents and the kids for crossing the line. Her tone was unprofessional, hostile and down right angry.  I happened to be closing my tab at the bar when this rant over the intercom took place, and everyone (including the bartender) was in complete shock.   Jaw. Drop. Shock.    It was a public shaming and it was very embarrassing.     Were the kids in the wrong?  Absolutely.   Should the kids have been reprimanded?  Yes.   Should the parents have been lectured? Perhaps.  I totally get it.  The employees had every reason to confront the kids and parents.   They know they were wrong and they learned from it.     The kids weren't raising hell, they didn't damage anything, they didn't make a mess, they weren't' being disrespectful.   Yes they crossed the line, and they apologized, everyone apologized.  Both parents emphatically apologized. \\n\\nShould the manager engage in a face to face conversation with parents? Yes.   Even it's an unpleasant conversation? Absolutely, without a doubt.    Shutting down an entire bowling ally,  and then chewing out the parents/kids over the intercom for two minutes was extremely low, insulting and downright wrong.  In our group, we had a total of 10 kids and 6 parents, we spent around $300 for 2 hours of \\"fun\\"  and we were ALL humiliated and shammed in front of everyone.

My blackened chicken sandwich was okay - the spicy mayo had a bitter herb that clashed with the spices of the chicken.  The fries were limp and bland.  Pretty disappointing for $14.  Service was slow, probably because they have to hike the food across that vast lobby, but our waiter was friendly.\\n\\nAside from a flashy lobby and having maximum convenience to Sea World, there's not much special about this place except the great customer service.

The avocados and cheese further enhanced the fatty profile of this meal without feeling overboard. The bread was pillow soft yet sturdy.

For the newbies at hotpot, the experience goes like this, you're seated, asked what to drink, pick your choice of broth, check off the items that you'll want to dip in the broth and it'll be out in about 5 minutes. \\n\\nThe menus gives you a wide variety of beef cuts, seafood items, noodles, rice and anything else that you can dip. Here's the catch, if you're ordering over 10 items its likely that you'll get half of what you've checked off. So if you have something in mind, keep an eye out for it or you'll have to ask them to bring it out. For the most part, most of the items are fresh but there are days where they come out and it's clearly been sitting in the fridge all day.

A good deal for the amenities and upgrades that this HOTEL has. I emphasize the word hotel because that's what it is -- not a \\"resort\\" that many mid-to-upper scale hotels are now claiming to be in lieu of milking those \\"resort\\" fees out of customers ($25 a night plus tax here). To start, it's obvious that the hotel has been updated to stay with the times. The lobby and atrium are beautiful. The room itself: well appointed and clean. Service: overall well. Now for some negatives. You are forced into self parking or valet, $25 and $34 a night respectively. I am cheap and able bodied so I opted for self parking. For $25 a night, the parking isn't covered and is very tight but it is secured by gate at least. The major issue is that by evening the parking lot is full resulting in many paying customers having to park in the overflow parking next door at Seaworld - not even on hotel property and a 5 min walk to the hotel door and not secured by any means. This happened both nights. To pay the fee and not reap any benefits is unacceptable, so I encourage you to politely dispute the fee if you find yourself in this situation - the hotel obviously has a parking problem because we were told this happens frequently. Next, the bathrooms... Wow! I guess the renovation money dried out by the time the bathrooms were thought of. Very outdated and the toilet ran the entire time - cheaper hotels have better bathrooms!

My friend, a fellow Mexican, recommended this place to me. So, despite initial misgivings, I decided to try it, as I live nearby.\\n\\nDisclaimer, I grew up in Mexico City and know Mexican fare through and through. Also, I am a lifelong fan of pastor tacos, the Mexican gyro. And so, that is what I ordered. The server brought chips and salsa, a sign of a decent Mexican eatery. \\n\\nI was not happy with the pastor tacos they served me, if you can call them that. They were good tacos, but they weren't pastor. The marinade was thin and weak. The pork meat was lean. No pineapple on top of the tacos a telltale of non-traditional pastor fare. And no cilantro / onion garnish for the tacos. A single wedge of lime rounded up the garnish. Also, the salsa, while made with fire roasted tomatoes, was bland and weak. The chips, however, were legit.\\n\\nThe garnish was unusual: a side of potatoes, carrots and chorizo and another one of escabeche with nopal cactus. Overall, the food was filling and, while bland, was adequate. I had to add salt to everything they served me, from the salsa to the escabeche. The service was good.

Me especially, with my shrimp dumplings hard-on, was looking forward to what type of combinations they had to offer to amaze me.\\n\\nWell, let's just say although the variety was exciting, the end results weren't as much.  This place has plenty of great ideas of different dumplings, but the two we sampled didn't impress.  The pacific dumpling was undercooked, and the filling was too pastelike to be any good.  The emperor dumpling was a bit better as it was fried, and at least cooked better, but also lacked anything special.  Both dumplings were fairly small as well, and for the premium this place is charging for it's dumplings, I had expected better.  Otherwise, I'd rather go to my local Chinese place, and just get some peking raviolis.  We also tried their love noodles, which weren't bad, but also didn't come out as we expected based on their description of hot peanut sauce.  We thought it would be more of a thicker, creamy peanut based sauce, but it was more of chili chunk/oil sauce with peanut bits.  Not too bad, just unexpected.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the decor is nice, albeit small, and if it's your first check in, you get 15% off, so it's an incentive to trying this place out at least once."},{"name":"Vanbarry's Public House","address":"4120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I wanted to try this place out since it's not too far from where I work.

So my guest tried it and said to send it back. Our server, Mandi, was more than ok with getting me something else. So here came the Taco Mama and mami it was good. The short ribs were tender and full of flavor, and with a addition of 'beer bacon jam', well you couldn't go wrong. The blue cheese was a perfect addition. \\nThe taco and beer came up to $12.

They brought a completely wrong pizza to the table that my wife had built, and we were the only ones in the restaurant, not quite sure who's pizza we got, but hey exchanged it and made a new one fairly quickly. Now for the quality, kind of felt it had the same feel as the decor, not much personality, just a bland pizza, the wings also didn't have much flavor.  Crust was cooked fine with no issue there.  Maybe we just need to wait a while for them to develop, but have no plans to return in the near future.

My son has been going to Mini Miracles for a few months now. After visiting several daycare centers in the area, we fell in love with Mini Miracles. All the kids seem so happy and cared for that it felt like the right fit for our son. I was on the fence about sending him to daycare or getting a nanny and I am so happy with my decision! I have never felt like the center only cares about my money. In fact, I thought it was incredible that the director, first Nikia and now Amy, knows each child by his/her name! All the staff is very friendly, smile and say hello whenever we are dropping off or picking up our son. \\nI can only \\"review\\" the Infant 1 room as my son is still in that room. The teachers, DD & Stephanie, are amazing with him! When he sees them, his face lights up and he is genuinely excited to see them! I can tell that they love him and truly care about him and his wellbeing. I have seen them kiss him and I have no problem with it at all! If I can't be with my son all day, then I hope that whoever is with him is treating him well and showing him love! Babies need love and attention! I'm not sure why someone wouldn't want they're baby to feel loved at all times! The room itself is clean and organized and there is a \\"dirty toy\\" bin for toys that need to be washed before another baby can play with it. I have never seen anyone in the Infant 1 room with shoes on unless they are covered with booties. \\nAs for the Infant 1 curriculum... they are infants! They eat, sleep & play. But I have definitely seen changes in my son's abilities and I'm fairly certain he had his first giggle with DD at daycare! As he grows, he is learning more and more!  I have no doubt that as he gets older the curriculum will prepare him for kindergarten.\\nIn reference to the baby who had heat rash... I believe that was my son however the heat rash had NOTHING to do with daycare. He got heat rash from being in a very warm room outside of daycare with lots of people cuddling and holding him. I mentioned it to the daycare providers because I wanted them to keep a bib on him to keep his chest/belly dry and to keep him in a light onesie so he didn't get hot and irritate it. I have noticed the Infant 1 room is warm which is why I send him in a short-sleeve onesie and pants. \\nAll in all I would highly recommend this daycare.

Set up to be something like a sandwich bar, the ingredients for the rolls are laid out behind the glass at the counter just waiting to be chosen. But unlike most sandwich bars, there aren't really any clues as to how you're supposed to order or what the finished product will look like. After much discussion, I discovered that each roll is MASSIVE -- like a whole meal, kind of gargantuan (this would explain the $8 price tag on a single roll thing they've got going on). No need to order more than one. Trust me.\\n\\nOptions are either a nori or soy wrap, white, brown or black rice, two meats and two veggies, one sauce and two toppings. I'm not a huge fan of mixing my meat, especially in a sushi roll, but my (male, mind you) dining companion so kindly noted that so long as I don't look at the process as a sushi bar, but rather a strange mashup of North American stoner customs AND Japanese sushi, then it's a new game. One wherein meats are mixed, toppings include -- but are not limited to -- potato chips (because, why not?), tobiko, tempura flakes, wakame salad (yes, as a topping), fake crab, and a whole other assortment of confused cultural edibles. The finished product wasn't entirely what I wanted, but I'm the only one who can carry the blame for this. I made the damn thing. \\n\\nThis place has a few kinks to roll out (though it appears to be a fast food joint, it takes forever for a roll to be finished; they use too much rice in said rolls; and the ingredients themselves are cut a bit thick for my liking -- but like I said, this isn't traditional Japanese), but I still really like the concept. Hence the fourth star. This is a solid 3-star spot, but it's like that kid who could almost be flunking grade 7 but shows that he understands what's being taught so is passed based on potential. They just need a little time, is all. Also, the guys who started it are so stoked on the whole thing, that it's pretty hard not to be just as enthusiastic about it. \\n\\nI'd totally go back, if only to try the other dishes they have to offer (tofu ice cream, bubble tea).

And it was big, which was nice- we could share it.  That is basically what they get two stars for.\\n\\nThe sandwich was ok, but it wasn't really what I ordered.  The Ricky Ricardo was supposed to be pork, a mustard vinegrette, pickled onions and manchego.\\n\\n10 mins after ordering the spacy woman that took my order came and asked me what kind of cheese I wanted, since they were out of manchego. \\n\\nShe didn't bother to tell me they were out of pickled onions too.  So they just put raw red ones in the sandwich- not even thinly sliced- big diced pieces of them.  So really, my sandwich had pork in it, and it did have some sort of vinegrette on it, but otherwise I wouldnt think it was the sandwich I ordered.\\n\\nTo top it all off, it took us forever to pay our bill, because the woman who took my order didn't want to run my credit card, so we had to wait until we were leaving, and then the woman manning the machine at that point didn't know how to use it, so it took her like 10 mins to learn while she was checking us out- you know, not that we were in a rush or anything, it was fine for her to take our time while she fumbled around.\\n\\nI wouldnt waste my time at this place.  The best thing about this place is the names of the sandwiches."},{"name":"Chewies Steam & Oyster Bar - Kits","address":"2201 W 1st Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow!

So let's call it 3.4 stars for good measure.\\n\\nLast Wednesday, the fianc√©e and I met my sister-in-law for dinner at Artist Point. Like all the other 2 point restaurants on the Disney Dining Plan, you do need reservations many months in advance. Perhaps they take walk-ins, I can't say. I imagine if they do, and you try it, you'll be waiting forever for a table. \\n\\nDespite having reservations, when we checked in we were given a beeper to alert us when our table was ready. We took it to the bar and had a few unnecessary, ridiculous drinks. I ordered the manliest drink on the menu: a BluTini. The rim was laced with sugar and that's about all I tasted as I drank it as fast as I could to end the dumb gag. The glowing blue cube in the middle makes this truly a drink any lumberjack will curtsey for. Boo.\\n\\nWe were seated at a pretty decent table near the center of the room. Our waiter was fine, no complaints. Using the Disney Dining Plan, the fianc√©e and I were each entitled to an appetizer, entr√©e, dessert, and non-alcoholic drink. For an app, I got some bacon pork thing. It was better than I anticipated but not half as good as my fianc√©e's smoky portobello mushroom soup. This is the restaurant's signature app and when you taste it, you too will know why. My sister-in-law got the mussels and she liked them. \\n\\nAgainst my better judgment, I ordered the filet mignon for my entree. I've lost track of how many of these I've eaten on this trip. Because I've had so many different steaks in Disney, I think I can say with some authority that the filet mignon at Artist Point is the least appealing. It was a far cry from terrible but it certainly wasn't anything spectacular either. I asked for it to be prepared medium-rare and they took it upon themselves to cook it borderline medium-well. Brash! Beyond that oversight, it was also a plain and flavorless meat despite the lobster mushroom rago√ªt and roasted savory truffle that accompanied it. But here's the kicker--hold on, we need a new paragraph for this gem.\\n\\nThe filet comes with a hazelnut crunch donut filled with yukon gold potato and red currant gastrique. If it looks intriguing when you read those words here (or on the actual menu), back away. It is nonsense. What is it? I don't get it! You're offering a sugar donut filled with potatoes and this is enticing why? Well, I fell for it. And I ate half of it just to make sure I wasn't crazy. I'm not. The donut, she's not good.\\n\\nMy fianc√©e ordered the Airline Chicken that, despite it's horrid name, was excellent. We both loved it. It was so moist and flavorful. Five stars for the chicken here folks. Get that.\\n\\nMy sister-in-law had the scallops. She enjoyed them but wasn't doing backflips over the taste.\\n\\nDessert for me was the cr√®me br√ªl√©e and a specialty drink called the Nutty Mountain. The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was good and the Nutty Mountain actually had some nuts in it. I wasn't expecting that. Kinda weird to be drinking coffee one second and then realizing there are nuts in your mouth the next. Um.\\n\\nThe cobbler is highly raved about here on Yelp. Is it amazing? My fianc√©e (who ordered it) says no. But it's good. It tastes like a blueberry muffin with some ice cream on top. \\n\\nOverall, my meal was disappointing while my fianc√©e's was great and my sister-in-law's was decent. 3.4 stars.

In retrospect I should have assumed that a cheap sushi place would use farmed salmon... but to be honest, the colour wierded me out.

Chips and salsa come out fast. They don't have a liquor license, so no cerveza, which is too bad. There is a HUGE tv on the wall that was blaring some A&E doc about whether wrasslin' was real (spoiler: it's not)- since I was the only one in the place, I let the waiter watch his TV and just tuned it out, but atmosphere it ain't.\\n\\nI was feeling hungry and unimaginative, so I went with chicken enchiladas rojas. One nice touch is that they came out with plenty of delicious queso on top, in addition to the standard shredded/melted cheese. The chicken was kinda weird- it wasn't really shredded that much, just huge chunks. Nice mix of dark and white meat though- there's nothing worse than an enchilada full of dry white meat. Good flavor, though. The rice and beans were completely standard- the beans were more of the \\"glue\\" than the \\"soup\\" texture. \\n\\nOne big disappointment- the chips totally sucked.

Either way, I did not enjoy this restaurant. \\n\\nWhenever I go to a new Sushi place I always get a Sashimi combo or Chirashi bowl, because it allows me to judge a variety of fish and the quality of a restaurant. The Chirashi bowl was sub-par, their rice lacks flavor.  Rice makes sushi, sub par rice = sub par sushi. To add onto that the maguro was in pretty bad shape, it was sad looking and falling apart, it was definitely handled to warm before serving. The salmon, squid and octopus was average of what I would expect from an economically priced sushi joint, nothing special. The yellow tail had a bone in it, and there was one piece that I couldn't identify, but it was fishy, very fishy... no idea what it was so I don't know if that was an acceptable flavor for it. \\n\\nThe piece size was good, but you only got one piece for each which for me was about half of what I would expect from a Chirashi bowl. \\n\\nI cannot vouch for their other dishes, but based off this one experience I would not suggest going there for Sashimi or Nigiri."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This place is absolutely great!!

Lastly, the bathroom looked really nice but would it hurt the bottom line to install a jacket/purse hook on the door. Most women do not hold their purse in their lap while they do they're business.

Yes, I know that Atlanta is not the birthplace of Cajun food.   But ever since I moved out west, I make getting my fill of So Co  (food, not the liquor), my top priority whenever I am below the Mason-Dixon line.  Sure, I could have driven my rental Ford Focus even further from the Perimeter to hit up the ever popular chain, Pappadeaux, in Suburbia, GA.  (Had it been Tuesday or Wednesday, I would have strongly considered it since they have a rockin' boiled crawfish deal right now on those days).  However, I turned to Chowhound for real answers, and found myself searching for a place named French Quarter Too.  Apparently the name has now changed to Beyond The Bayou, but the location is the same and the menu is definitely Cajun--po'boys, gumbo, alligator, jambalaya, Abita, etc.  I had a cup of gumbo to start...dark and spicy...reminiscent of my old college friend's family's recipe.  I was torn between entree decisions: oyster po'boy or shrimp and grits.  I went for the shrimp and cheese grits...very flavorful, but I wish they had given me more shrimp instead of so many tomatoes, peppers, and onions in the sauce.  Unfortunately their oven was broken, so dessert wasn't even an option.  :(  The service was genuinely friendly and prompt.

The queso has three main ingredients which are curry, coconut and cheese :) I'm surprised on how all three ingredients are well balanced and not one over powers the other. My favorite taco was the fish. The fish was cooked perfectly and it had the perfect amount. I like how every bite there was fish because not many taco places add enough fish in the taco. There was a drizzle of curry sauce on it which gave it an interesting flavor. Second best was shrimp and grits taco. It was seasoned just right and the amount of grits was not overwhelming it was perfectly balanced. Last but not least was the picnic chicken.

The place where I felt they fell short was the pizza crust, it was doughy with no hint of it being crispy at all. This is really their only short coming, but when it comes to pizza, crust is everything. In fairness, I felt the same way about Blaze when they opened, crust too doughy, having gone back there, it seems they improved it significantly, so hopefully for Pie Five, it's just a growing pain and something they just need to optimize, cooking time and temperature etc."},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"Salad was heavy with arugula would have prefer a blend of lettuces \\nSalmon was delicious with the wild rice and quinoa mix"},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We booked a table for four on Tuesday evening and were seated upstairs.

Just an amazing, beautiful, cozy, and delicious restaurant.  Where do I begin.  Their motto on the menu reads, \\"Where the Hospitality and Cuisine of the Pacific Northwest Come Alive!\\".  They are spot on with that statement.  The restaurant is located in Disney's Wilderness Lodge Resort which is one of my favorite places to stay when down there.  Going into the meal I had very high expectations as Artist Point is one of the pricier restaurants on property. \\n\\nAtmosphere: High ceilings, big windows overlooking the pool, lake, and trees, and beautiful artwork and murals around the restaurant.  Easily one of the prettiest places I have ever eaten.  The space is cozy and intimate despite the very high ceilings.  \\n\\nFood and Waitress: I finally know what a Disney Signature Restaurant is.  Sure it is the atmosphere but the wait staff as well as the food make this place stellar.  Everyone at Disney World is nice.  Even the janitors have big smiles on their faces.  But our waitress was a step above the normal cast member at Disney World.  She made this meal special for my family and I.  Our waitress gave us a hard sell on the portobello soup but we declined since the entrees are quite pricey.  For our meals my parents each got the Swordfish and Buffalo respectively while I decided on their famous Cedar Plank Salmon.  So we talked and drank and it had been awhile since we ordered food.  A few minutes later our waitress comes out with three tiny cups of the portobello soup because she wanted us to \\"try it out\\".  I was not that dumb, Disney is not the company or place to just give you something free!  The kitchen was obviously behind and the soup was a nice touch.  This was definitely a \\"signature\\" move.  And the soup was killer; creamy, and just awesome.\\n\\nOur food finally came and my salmon was terrific and actually served on a cedar plank.  Best salmon I have had.  I also tried a bit of my mother's buffalo after I got over the fact it was buffalo.  It was a very dense meat, unlike the steaks and chicken we are accustomed to.  It was very tasty but a little too chewy for me.  It came three ways: in mac and cheese, a steak, and a sausage.  All were unique and good.\\n\\nTo conclude our meal, our waitress tried selling us dessert but we were all stuffed from our amazing meals.  As a Disney Signature of course, she brought out one final special touch; three glasses of champagne to conclude the meal.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:  Amazing atmosphere, stellar food, and world class service if you can afford it.

We were shopping at the nearby outlet mall and were trying to decide where to go for a later dinner (9:30pm) and El Patron had reservations available on opentable and had some promising reviews on yelp.  We were about to go to Bahama Breeze, but then figured we'd give El Patron a try,and boy were we glad we did.  When we got there the restaurant wasn't that busy as it was after normal dinner hours. Having never heard of this restaurant before, we asked if they were a chain, and the hostess replied that the restaurant is family owned and operated, and that they aren not a chain.   Our waitress was great, very friendly and prompt with brining out some delicious chips and salsa.  She was very knowledge about the menu and was able to answer our questions.\\n\\nAfter 9'pm the restaurant offers happy hour specials including a $4 margarita...which was delicious, my brother and I both had 2!  We also ordered the guacamole appetizer, which was great, and then I shared an order of the chicken/steak combination fajitas, and the shrimp chimichangas.

The problem is it was a busy Saturday night dinner and they only scheduled one server to wait for all customers.\\n\\nWe had to wait for a while to ask a question and to ask for a menu. There was another customer next to us who just left his money on the table, got up, and left without the server noticed him. She was busy and overwhelmed with what's going on.  Originally we wanted to order more food from the menu because there were not many options on the sushi track. We waited for a while for the menu and then we decided not to order anything else because we didn't want to wait.\\n\\nWe got up, paid for what we ate, and left.

Seriously, guys - like Brandi says, one doesn't have to be snobbish about BBQ, and there's room enough for all.  Plus, I can't abide the lines at 4R - guess I just don't care enough about food, but nothing is THAT good that I have to wait 30 minutes to hand them over my hard-earned money.  4R should just go ahead and jack up the price until the lines thin out, or offer variable pricing (cheaper before 11 and after 3...)  It's simple supply and demand: customer service will improve, and water will seek its own level.\\n\\nOh this review is about SMOKEY BONES??  Oh right, right... got side-tracked.  Back to SB: other than finding their rib portions on the small side, and the BBQ sauce a touch sweet, I think the quality of the food's been pretty good.  I'm usually surprised by how tasty and moist the chicken breasts are, and the brisket is beefy.  The sausage is a little spicy for the unwary.  Among the sides, the usual fan favorites like mac n cheese and mashed potatoes are both too calorie-laden.  I think I like the beans and fire-roasted corn the best.\\n\\nBeer lovers: they have a signature lager that I've got to try one of these days - $3 for a 22 oz. pour.

I hate how some even dare charge above 10 for a plate of meat. This is why I like Hotpot Buffet in Chinatown. The place opened up pretty recently, taking over what I recall to be a restaurant called Imperial Seafood. \\n\\nI've been here twice so far.\\n\\nThe first time with my eldest brother and boyfriend. Boy, was it hectic in there. We walked in the door to dozens of Chinese people hovering around the host's counter while the hosts were running around trying to get everyone seated. They really make do with what they have and try to squeeze in people wherever they can. The host gave us a table for two although there were three of us and the table was REALLY just meant for two. I didn't care too much. I actually thought the host was being efficient.  How much can we order anyway? Right? \\n\\nWell... \\n\\nThey gave us a sheet to check off whatever we wanted. We selected: \\nAll cuts of beef\\nAll cuts of lamb\\nAll cuts of beef tongue \\nAlmost all the balls: shrimp, cuttlefish,fish,pork,beef\\nAlmost all of the veggies: watercress, tong ho, bok choy, pumpkin \\nA lot of seafood: shrimp, crab legs, white fish, flounder filet, salmon clams \\n\\n okay we were super hungry and we chowed down on whatever came first. we had two broths (mala and chinese herbal). First came the seafood and vegetables. we finished almost the entire massive plate (they put it all on one big plate instead of a million individual tiny ones smart & practical). We were wondering where our cuts of meat were so we asked our waitress.She wasn't really sure and was kind of lost herself. So she told us it was busy and we should wait a while. So we waited longer. Its an hour into the meal and still no meats! So we asked once again and she suggested we fill out another sheet since they might have lost our original order. So we fill out everything we were missing and more! More seafood and more vegetables come out so we really nagged the waitress about our meat and alas two plates of meats came out. But its funny because we ordered at least six different cuts. So we asked AGAIN!  So the  waitress goes back into the kitchen and out comes the meat! voila. Tons and tons of meat. So we dug into our food. After a while we realized they never gave us the Tong ho veggie that my bf really wanted. So we bugged more people again about or order. the waitress goes back and out comes two giant plates of food. They looked kind of famliar, hmm could it be? It was the very first sheet that we filled out. This time they brought everything we order the first time out once again! Holy crap! What happens now? We were trying to explain that we only wanted the Tong Ho veggies and no more seafood and meat. so the waitress finally tells us that they ran out of those veggies. darn! We ended up stuffing ourselves with the rest of the food that came out. \\n\\nThe service was good because she really tried to find out what was going on for us and kept trying to give us all the food we wanted, but the confusion in the kitchen was so bad! Quality of food was decent so its A-OK for the amount you get and the money you pay.

It was my last stop and I'm glad because it was the yummiest taste left in my mouth when I left. I had Nana G's chicken and waffles which was really good. I liked the waffle more than the chicken, but that's because they had bacon in the waffles .  My next favorite was Dominic's NY pepperoni pizza. They were charging $4 instead of $3 and I'm not sure why, but whatever. The slices were a decent size ad it was good so I didn't make a fuss about it. Chef Marcee served red Velvet French Toast. I thought the flavor was good, but I have to get another taste while it's hot. It was really sweet and I didn't think it needed any syrup. Very good eats! Now for my least favorite: Bar Margot and Babalu. I got the duck confit chorizo and potato hash cake. It wasn't that it wasn't good, it was just such a small portion I really didn't get a really good taste of it. I will stop by their restaurant and give them another shot tho. Babalu's breakfast empanada was kind or boring to me. I expected a lot more flavor than I got ad I thought it was kind of dry. Given that they were bite size samples may have been the reason, but eh I don't think it's worth a visit for. I wish I would've tried the avocado toast. That looked good and definitely worth a visit.

I had the short ribs with pickled vegetables and a very tart-tasting polenta. Everything was overspiced. Either too tangy or too salty.

Kind of tough.  We weren't expecting a filet , but still.  Fries, on the other hand, were excellent.  \\nWe had the lobster tacos as an appetizer and I hated the breading on the lobster.

But there was space in the bar area.   Waiter was very pleasant.   Atmosphere is decent.  Lots of young folks at that hour.  Not too loud.   \\n\\nUnfortunately, the fun stopped at the food.   Got one of my faves - the Mac and Cheese.  M&C can be a crap shoot - everyone seems to have their own recipe - some restaurants are amazing, and some are dull.    I hate to say this one was blah.   \\n\\nDinner arrived in a nice cast iron skillet (\\"Careful, it's hot\\").  but strangely, while the skillet was hot, the pasta was not - pretty close to room temperature when it arrived.  Almost as if it it went under the broiler for a quick browning rather being an actual baked fo rme mac and cheese dish.  By the time I was half way through the meal it was getting cold.\\n\\nThe pasta itself was kind of chewy.   The pasta on top actually had no sauce at all on it, I had to mix it up myself to get all the pasta cheese coated.   After mixing, the taste was kind of bland.   No great creamy cheese flavour.   No interesting spices.  just kind of bland. \\n\\nI had ordered the chicken addition ($3 more).  The chicken was cooked well, but again it didn't have much flavor - the chicken itself didn't taste spiced or marinated, and none of the m&c flavor had permeated the chicken.   I have to say though - this is the first time I've found a bone in my mac & cheese.\\n\\nI was hungry and finished it, but would definitely never order it again and recommend you stay away.  The price ($16 for m&c with chicken) puts it at the high end - and for that kind of money I've had far better m&c elsewhere.    (Surprised at all the good m&c reviews here - either I my cook had a really awful day or the other reviewers haven't had really amazing m&c before)\\n\\nThe place was nice overall, and i would give them another chance and get something different next time - maybe I did catch a bad night."},{"name":"Alfredo's Italian Restaurant","address":"1989 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It was in the Disco era that Ann and I started going to Alfredo's.

Thanks to Christin K's suggestion, we came up with this place.  None of us had been, so we were all excited.  I mean, this helps us with our review counts, eh?\\n\\nIt was only a block walk, and when we got there, it wasn't too crowded.  The first thing I noticed was the patio area- looked awesome!  Long metal benches, fountains, and an open bar as well.\\n\\nIt is a counter order then bring food to ya deal.  So we all got menus and studied em.  Drinks on one side, food on the other.  As the name of the restaurant implies, everything is named after some sort of whateveryouwannacallit.  The items looked spotty- with nothing really looking like it would hit out of the ballpark.  No fries here or anything like that.  Salads, noodles, and sandwiches.  The sandwiches are served on 8 inch buns.\\n\\nI ended up getting I think the Montgomery Burns, the most expensive food item at $15.  I wanted to see what a sandwich of that price would do to my palette.  I also ordered some kind of iron drink (forgot what the whole name was). I also ordered a fountain drink.  I got a cone with a number, and my drink shortly came out, and so did my sandwich.  The food does come out quickly here!\\n\\nI tell you what, my palette was sure pissed off when I bit into that sandwich.  It consisted of shaved ribeye, and a horseradish brie.  I have not been a fan of horseradish, but I am trying to slowly eat more of it (hell, I finally started to enjoy mustard now!).  The cheese was the best part about it.  Unfortunately, the $15 sandwich literally tasted like meat, cheese with a kick, and bread.  The meat was juicy, but it was bland- as it tasted like it was never seasoned.  Bummer.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my drink (which was rimmed with a chili-salt) was pretty damn tasty.  I liked the rimjob (hehe) on it- complimented it well.  Since I was driving back to Memphis that night, I only had one- easily could have downed 5-6 more.\\n\\nAt the counter, they had dessert pushpops made by Sublime Donuts (hell yea!).  They had strawberry mango and chocolate peanut butter, @ 3$ a pop (pun intended).  I ended up buying them by the hordes.  The cashier realized I never got my fountain drink from earlier, so she knocked the price off of one of the pops.  Hell yea.  The pops were yummy!  I would say they were equally tasty- but the chocoPB tasted just like a reeses cup :)\\n\\nIt was time to then doll up and check out the restroom.  I like how the walls were painted like green ooze is pouring out of them (something I really want to think about when I am in a bathroom).  But they were clean.  The light fixtures in there were industrial and cool- I had not seen lights like that before.  Thankfully I didn't get attacked by a villain when I was in the restroom.\\n\\nIn the end, I got to spend some time with 7 special people and I enjoyed their company.  I think we all came upon the conclusion that this place is a great hang out spot for drinks, but do not get hung up on the food.  Hell, at least they have popsicles- but they also usually have King of Pops out front too (earlier in the day, at least)."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love the self serve coffee.

No need to return.\\nWent there for lunch with a friend. It was a gorgeous day out but the restaurant was not crowded. We wanted to eat inside but the TVs were so freakin' loud, we could not hear one another talk. We waited over 5 minutes for the hostess to appear, and when that didn't happen, we went & found her. We were seated outside in the direct sun. While there was a covered section on the back patio, there were no tables set up there for people who found the sun too strong. There were no umbrellas on the patio tables, so the sun heated the surface of the metal tables so much that they became uncomfortable to the touch. (It also melted the ice in our drinks, so they became luke-warm very quickly, which is not very refreshing in hot weather.) We waited about 10 minutes for our server, who did not bring us menus. She came over, without a smile & asked us if we knew what we wanted. My friend suggested menus, and she left without even asking if we wanted anything to drink. We placed our order several minutes later with the still unsmiling server, and it took about 30-35 minutes for our food to arrive. When the food arrived, we asked for our drinks again. No one returned to the table with the drinks. Five minutes later, our server stopped by to see how our meal was and we asked for them a third time. Still, it took at least another 5 minutes for them to arrive. The server station was about a 30 second walk from our table, so I don't understand why there was such a problem with our request. Meanwhile, a nearby table nearby had arrived after us, ordered & received cocktails 15-20 minutes before our drinks arrived. Food was good, but nothing fantastic.

I have no idea why so many shops in Massachusetts seem to ignore this point.  Just focus on the customer.  If they want water, bring them water.  Be courteous, be kind.  If they don't like the food, ask why and learn from your mistake.  Sometimes you'll get a wonky customer.  You'll know them when you see them, so just work to get them out as soon as practical, and don't inflict your anger on everyone else.

If you don't like groupon, then dont use it.  \\n\\nThird, advertise broadly!  Too many great restaurants in this area go under because they act as though everyone knows they exist.

A lockbox is on the door handle during business hours and it lacks a signboard or lighted sign or any other way to tell it's open without pressing your face to the glass. Inside, there is music (not too loud, thank you to the person in charge, for knowing it's lunchtime!) The decor is a bit odd: smallish round tables with two vaguely uncomfortable love-seats facing one another, forming sort-of booths -- making seating a bit awkward for four people. If anyone in your group wants a firm chair there is exactly one table in the front window for you.\\n\\nWho designed this? But the server/greeter/maybe the cook, too, that helped us was as gracious as could be. We loved her earnest desire (and ability) to be excellent! They serve Steve Smith teas in pretty teapots and china. We ordered soups and sandwiches for a good lunch. The French Onion Soup was delicious, good bread and melted cheese - pretty hard to argue with that. Sandwiches (we tried roast beef and chicken salad) were tasty, and even a half-sandwich was plenty of food, along with soup. The pricing is a bit high, but NW 23rd is high rent and I get that. I'm giving this place four stars, three for our meal and one to grow on. Its sister restaurant, Picnic House, downtown does well ...

I feel like it relies exclusively on proximity to the water, and the food is just completely secondary.\\n\\nWe live really close so we've been here several times. The Fajitas are good and a fine portion, but the sandwiches and burgers are so meh it's hard to function. Nachos are dry and sad. Even the poutine! How do you mess that up? It's not bad, just.... sad... flavorless. Stingy with sauces.\\n\\nAnd it seems like they are always understaffed. Bless the waitstaff, though, they really try hard to make it a good experience! But it seems like the odds in the kitchen are stacked against them.\\n\\nAnd they run out of basics on a regular basis. Even on a very slow Saturday night, they ran out of chips. The last time we were there for brunch, they were out of scallops, clams, sour cream, and a few other items. It made it so that each of our dishes had some sort of substitution on it, and another dish didn't arrive until long after the others. A waitress sheepishly said the chef was going to the store to get some key ingredients to finish up our meals.\\n\\nAnd again, the food is not that flavorful. \\n\\nThe drinks are great, though!

The restaurant was formerly the fledgling Sakura Stix, also a Japanese steakhouse and sushi bar.  New ownership took over, renovated the old Sakura space, and have revitalized the business.  Yoi Yoi is located in the Howell Mill Village shopping center, where Publix is located, near the intersection of Howell Mill Rd. and Collier Rd.\\n\\nThis is a relatively popular neighborhood restaurant.  It's one of the only places (perhaps the only place) to get real sushi in the area.  Many customers like to order take-out or delivery.  Online ordering is available.  I admire what the new owners have done, rebranding the place and putting more emphasis on sushi.  One of the owners, David, is the head sushi chef.  As he works away behind the sushi bar, he's often the first to greet customers as they enter the restaurant.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is casual.  The interior is Asian-themed with small waterfalls, Japanese paper lanterns, and bamboo at almost every table.  It also feels loft-like with exposed ductwork above.  The walls towards the kitchen and restrooms are covered in wallpaper made from Japanese newspaper.  If you look closely, the newspaper looks to be from Atlanta as you'll see ads for local businesses such as another Atlanta area Japanese restaurant, Umezono in Smyrna (now I Love Sushi).  The sushi bar has two flatscreen TVs so you can hang out at the bar and watch TV.\\n\\nIn addition to sushi, Yoi Yoi serves hibachi dishes.  Unlike a stereotypical Japanese steakhouse such as Benihana, there are no teppanyaki grills and chefs in the dining room here.  All of the hibachi foods are cooked behind closed doors in the kitchen.  Hibachi proteins include chicken, shrimp, steak, salmon, scallops, and calamari.\\n\\nYou can order bento boxes which are box-shaped containers with different compartments filled with various foods.  For example, one bento box may contain salad, sushi, a spring roll, rice or noodles, and teriyaki chicken.\\n\\nFor hibachi, I think prices are generally in line with, if not better than, other teppanyaki restaurants.  You can get a hibachi dinner or bento box for less than $15 per person here.  Some Japanese steakhouses charge $20 or more.  Sushi prices are comparable to other sit-down sushi restaurants.  Basic rolls are under $10 each and special, more \\"extravagant\\" rolls are as much as $15 per.  The restaurant has affordable lunch specials too.\\n\\nMy favorite is the nigiri sushi.  They serve all the standard nigiri and then some, priced around $2 for one piece.  The best deals are on the $4 uni (sea urchin), toro (fatty tuna), and ama ebi (shrimp with head).  I'm not aware of any specials on nigiri and wish they had some.\\n\\nI've tried a fair amount of Yoi Yoi's nigiri and overall, it's A-OK.  It's fresh and satisfying.  It's hard to go wrong with almost any of the selections.  I like to get assorted nigiri and prefer the egg omelet (tamago), striped bass, albacore tuna, fresh salmon, white tuna, mackerel (saba), smelt roe (masago), octopus (tako), tuna (maguro), yellowtail, eel (unagi), scallop, uni, and toro.  I like my nigiri simple and \\"pure\\" and tend to stay away from options such as smoked white tuna and smoked salmon.  I like how the unaltered, non-smoked fish taste.\\n\\nSome notes/observations: The tamago is a bit sweet.  The saba has a significantly different flavor and texture than the rest of the fish.  It's not as soft and has more of a chew and pasty consistency to it.  It's got more of a briny taste.  I still like it, though.  Masago nigiri contains tiny little bright orange fish eggs.  I've found the tako to be tougher and bit more rubbery here -- octopus is supposed to be this way, but I've found Yoi Yoi's to exude these characteristics even more so.\\n\\nThe unagi is not bad, but it doesn't seem to have enough sauce and almost tastes dry.  The uni and toro are good, but I can notice a difference in quality between them and their more expensive counterparts at a higher-end or more authentic sushi restaurant.  The uni, in particular, tastes slightly more fishy.  Keep in mind these are all nitpicks and I wouldn't hesitate ordering these nigiri when dining here.  I don't recommend ordering them for carry-out or delivery, however.\\n\\nIf I had to recommend a sushi roll, I'd suggest the Hawaii Roll.  It consists of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, and a soybean \\"seaweed\\" wrap.  Instead of rolled seaweed, a soybean skin is used.  It's different.\\n\\nPresentation of dishes is great.\\n\\nService is outstanding.  Co-owner Eeleen also works as hostess and server.  I think the servers do an excellent job making sure everyone is happy and taken care of."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"A local favorite.

I have not decided on a conclusive overall rating but at this point have no plans to return to Hudson, at least any time soon.]\\n\\n\\"A Bar Tale\\"\\n\\nThe scene: Hudson Brookhaven, just after opening on a weekday.\\n\\nThe players: CN, her date, and one of the bartenders she knows best.\\n\\nAct 1 . . .CN and date initially don't plan to be there long but have such fun that they stay several hours enjoying bloody mary's etc. Much pleasant exchange with said bartender.\\n\\nAct 2 . . . Date had made it clear he planned to pay for the festivities but realizes he didn't have enough cash since they had run up a bigger than planned tab; he is going to go to ATM and be back. No problem with CN or bartender, though CN does have to leave by 3pm to be somewhere by 4pm and date's bank is one of those annoying only-three-local-branch ones that isn't super close. Date is going to hurry because it's just after 2pm.\\n\\nAct 3 . . .It gets to 3pm and date isn't back. CN has to leave, so she leaves a credit card *just in case* - this is a place she's been known at times to come, oh, five or six days a week so there's no way she's gonna risk stiffing them. Also leaves her beloved laptop as collateral (kind of a joke bc they all tease her about always having it with her!) Bartender is cool with this.\\n\\nAct 4 . . .CN returns late, after midnight. Turns out, date never came back! [That's a whole other story and no, CN will not be seeing him again!!]  CN has $60 cash on her and it turns out she gave them the Visa that had just expired rather than the new one so her card wouldn't go through; she's only carrying one with her these days out of budget-mindedness, so she doesn't have anything else to give them. The tab is close to $90 before tip.\\n\\nAct 5 . . . The manager is a complete ass. When a very embarrassed CN tries to apologize and say she'll be back first thing in the morning with cash or another card - they know she lives down the street, they know how well she always tips, it would seem that based on the fact that a bar stool should practically have her name on it this would be acceptable though not ideal - the manager essentially acts like she's trying to weasel out of a tab. The following conversation ensues:\\n\\n[Manager, CN, and the late shift bartender that CN also knows very well standing at the bar register where bartender is closing out]\\n\\nMGR: \\"You don't have any other way to pay?\\"\\nCN: \\"No.\\"\\nMGR: \\"That's all the cash you have, really? And you don't have another card?\\"\\nCN [who is getting more and more embarrassed]: \\"No, I'm sorry, I don't.\\"\\nMGR: \\"We expect our customers to pay their tab every single time they come in. I know you come in a lot, but you have to pay.\\"\\nCN: \\"I'm sorry, it's not something I expected, I always pay my tabs-\\"\\nMGR [interrupts CN, as he's studying her tab]: \\"You aren't this time.\\"\\nCN: \\"Uh, I'm not sure what you want me to say here. I came back tonight because I wanted to make sure this was covered and I didn't realize about the card. I'll be back first thing in the morning, it's really late tonight for me to go home and get a debit card and go to the ATM and-\\"\\nMGR [cutting CN off]: \\"I guess we will let you go this time, but every time from now on you are expected to pay your tab. This is a business.\\"\\nCN [shocked at his tone and total rudeness]: \\"You know, I work in a restaurant, too, and I cannot imagine my manager talking to a regular the way you've just spoken to me. I don't think I'll be back after I settle this tab.\\"\\nMGR: \\"Sorry you feel that way. Hope you have a wonderful night.\\"\\nCN and bartender just look at him.\\n\\nAct 5 . . . CN drives to get money, comes back to restaurant and finds bartender still cleaning up. Apologizes to bartender, who apologizes for her manager's behavior. CN gives enough cash to cover bill and a 30% tip.\\n\\nAct 6 . . .CN doesn't return to Hudson, and she writes a Yelp update.\\n\\nThe End."},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yummy brunch on Sunday!

Now, the process is streamlined, fast and delicious food will come your way. \\n\\nThis place is not friendly towards first-timers.. I was utterly confused when I walked in on what to do. \\n\\nThe process: \\n\\n1) They greet you from behind the counter\\n2) You are suppose to know that there are paper menus stacked in a pile on this stand and your suppose to grab one\\n3) Pens are provided for you to mark down your choices once you realize why there are stacks of paper next to the pens\\n4) the menu just states the name of the dish , price and you make how many you want OR... you turn it around and there are two combo choices...1 or 2..\\n\\nThe combo..includes two dishes of your choice, house special for the day and for 1 extra dollar you can get a drink\\n\\n5) Once you mark down your choices, which is suppose to be self-explanatory once you read the menu and follow directions, you walk to the counter and pay. They give you a number and tell you to take your seat, the food will arrive shortly.\\n\\n6) Get your drink at the drink fountain along with soy sauce, spicy oil, napkins and chopsticks and find a table or stand during busy hours.\\n\\n7) Within a few minutes, your dim sum is brought to your table in these bamboo streamers and white plates (very classy). \\n\\nEnjoy.

The individual dishes are average pricing $2.5-5 a dish, but the combo saves you a lot of money and you can still get your dim sum. \\n\\nI recommend this place to everyone. It is very roomy and way cheaper than traditional dim sum.  Plus, if you don' t like dim sum...at least you can come into the restaurant with your friends, hang out, buy a drink and not have people always bothering your table about food and giving you funny stares. \\n\\nThe downside...I am so used to seeing food and just pointing that when I have to read the dishes in English...I don't know what I am eating..haha...and okay I am Vietnamese so seriously..when those ladies start to talk to me..I dunno what they are saying...I just look...and node gracefully...\\n\\nAre You Ready?

This particular hotel is also directly connected to the convention center which makes it even more convenient. Overall, the Hyatt is a fantastic choice should your travels bring you to Orlando. \\n\\nPros-\\nCleanliness \\nService \\nRoom size\\nLocation \\nAttached to convention center \\nPools \\nCentrally located \\nGood restaurants \\n\\nCons-\\nPricey \\nValet \\nSelf parking- $18 per day"},{"name":"Carlucci's of Winter Park","address":"501 N Orlando Ave, Ste 145","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES!!!!

For those who complain about the wait time, know that it is because the chef is literally making your dumplings to order - - none of this pre-cooked/re-heated garbage, just straight up fresh dumplings. The seasoning of the dumpling meat is excellent and you can distinguish many of the different flavors (unlike the mystery meat that you might as well chew without swallowing). Texture of the dumplings themselves is slightly thicker and slightly doughy, which you either enjoy or hate.  We found 9 dumplings per person would have resulted in the right amount of full-ness (we got ambitious and ordered 12/person - but the thought of reheated dumplings was worse than the prospect of leaving them behind or being a little overly stuffed). \\n\\nOrder the milk tea! Chalk full of tapioca balls and giant straws - a different type of drink to order with your meal that you won't regret. \\n\\nThe TV on the wall is slightly distracting, but meh, whatever when your dumplings arrive you forget everything else all together. \\n\\nDefinitely heading back soon for more, definitely not for a giant group, and definitely not for the impatient."},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Oppa sushi is the best sushi restaurant in Allston.

It's one of the best places to go in Columbus when you're looking to accomodate a large group. The food is good enough. For about $20 per person, you'll get to eat an absolutely absurd amount of food. My two favorite things here are the Eggplant Parmesan & the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. Both of them are delicious and will leave you quite satisfied.\\n\\nOverall, I take Buca for what it is: a fun restaurant with decent food.

We wrapped up with a traditional chicken & seafood paella, which was pretty small and was only fair.    \\n\\nThe worst part was the bar staff, who all were acting as if the world was ending.

Nice space, great decor with a hint of Asia, very friendly and attentive waiter (did not stop pouring my water), and everything on the menu looked absolutely delicious. Since it is tapas style, we ordered quite a few plates to share. \\n\\nWe started off with fanny bay oysters, fish sauce, cilantro, lime - this was my favorite dish. Very tasty oysters with Thai-inspired sauce, over a bed of seaweed (yes, it's edible).  The dungeness crab, wakame, nigella, egg, chili flake- however was disappointing. All I could taste was the chili sauce- which was so strong and salty it totally masked the flavor of the crab. We then had the fried broccolini, candied bacon, fish sauce, mint- the candied bacon was delish, but the dish was way too salty and oily. The broccolini was deep fried with too much starch. I requested rice to go with it and that seemed to help. I liked the dashi poached egg, trout roe, mustard greens- again, it was too salty but this time it might have been from the small trout roes. I would have preferred larger salmon roes. It went well with the poached egg and dashi sauce. The chicken lollipops, sriracha mayo- again disappointing, my chicken was still raw inside. Out of the 5 chicken pops, one piece tasted good because there was some ginger on it. I liked the halibut, chrysanthemum, mustard, hon shimejis, lime- my BF thought the mustard was too hot. The fish was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms were tasty. My only complaint would be that the dish was too salty, which seems to be the trend here.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with the house chocolate mousse with whipped cream, their only dessert option. It was good, at least it wasn't salty!\\n\\nOverall, I think they have creative dishes with potential, but it the taste still needs to be perfected. (hint - less salty). Also, it would be nice if there wasn't such a long gap between each dish (they brought out one at a time). \\n\\nI would probably come back and try a few other dishes at some point, and let the waiter know before hand that I have high blood pressure, heart and kidney disease and see if they would lighten up on the salt."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"265 Peachtree Center Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I read the reviews and saw the complaints about the wait.

We made a reservation through Open Table approx. a week in advance. The atmosphere was raucous but not too loud. Our waiter (unfortunately I can't remember his name) was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and all his recommendations were spot-on. The cocktails - though pricey at 12$ a pop - are delicious and strong. The Bacon Old Fashioned was pretty good, as was the Gin and Jam, but the star cocktail was a summer cocktail I never would have picked it out, but the waiter strongly recommended it - absolutely delicious. For food we pretty much jumped around the menu based on the waiters suggestions. I can't remember all the dishes we had, but they were almost all fantastic. IMO the most underwhelming was the Charcuterie plate - the meats and pates were great, the cheeses were so-so, and it only came with 3 small pieces of baguette. We were left eating pungent cheeses and pates without bread! The Gruyere biscuits were - as everyone else says - addictive, and slightly overpriced (and I usually don't like Gruyere). They also ran out of a lot of dishes, but that's understandable as it was peak time on a busy Friday night. Overall, it was a great night, with mostly great food, and fantastic service.\\n\\n----\\n\\nFlash forward a few weeks: Lunch. Our mission for this trip was to try the Burger that everyone raves about (and is always #1 in any Orlando's Top Burgers list). We were seated right away (@12pm Saturday) just as tables started filling up. Our waitress seemed a little less knowledgeable about the menu this time, and was less apt to offer reccomendations. We started with the Deviled Eggs (unique, but meh.) and the Shrimp Tacos - the tacos were the highlight of the meal. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the batter was light and airy. Highly reccomended. \\n\\nFor entrees we orderd the Po' Boy with porkbelly & shrimp and - of course - the burger (medium-rare). The Po' Boy was fantastic, very flavorful and all the ingredients meshed well. The burger was a disaster. It was *extremely* overcooked - close to well done. The other problem was the flavor profile. All we could taste was very sharp bleu cheese. It completely overwhelmed the dish. The bacon, onion, and beef flavers were completely gone. If you really really like bleu cheese, you might enjoy this - but don't go in expecting to taste the meat. The saving grace of this entire dish was the truffle fries. I typically find most truffle fries *overly* truffly but these had a subtle truffle flavor and were *very* good. I plan to go back during dinner, and try the burger again (maybe it was the \\"2nd-string\\" in the kitchen during lunch), but was let-down on this visit.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nOverall: If you are open to your waiter/ress's recommendations, and don't go in with your heart set on a dish, you will probably enjoy a fantastic meal.

My wife and I went here on Saturday night after making reservations a few hours before. When we went inside, the first difference that we noted was the host stand was further inside than we would normally expect, we had to go past the waiting line and the bar to go check in with the host. It seemed like even though we had made reservations, we would need to wait a few minutes, no big deal. The place itself is pretty small and you can definitely tell the age of the decor. It had pictures of \\"famous\\" people on the bar wall like you see in many restaurants, but the only one that I recognized was Michael Imperioli from the Sopranos. Of course, this may just be my ignorance of the others. The place was packed and had a few people waiting as well.\\nMy wife ordered a glass of wine at the bar, but the service at the bar seemed very inattentive. The bartender did not seem to acknowledge the presence of any customers besides those that she was currently serving, no glance over at the others or any type of \\"I'll be right with you\\" or any such notification that we existed. Of course, once she took the order, she obtained the wine quickly. However, once the host came to seat us, we waited at least 10 minutes to close the tab. When the host came back to see if we had closed, I sent my wife along with him to get the table while I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes without success. I don't really know how the bartender did not see me or my credit card waiting to pay. She was taking payment from other customers as well as arranging glasses and seeming to arrange checks for diners as well. Probably for 90% of the time, she had her back to her customers at the bar. I'm a pretty patient guy, but this was pretty ridiculous. Finally, the host came back and took me to our table and said he'd take care of closing our tab at the bar. All for one glass of wine!\\nI am able to compartmentalize well, so I put that experience out my mind. We were seated at a table close to the kitchen. Considering that the place was pretty crowded, I didn't mind. There were already some garlic bread slices at the table which were very good. It was toasted well and had a good amount of garlic and olive oil. There was also a plate of pickled vegetables which was fine, depending on your taste. It took a little while for a server to come take our order, but it gave us time to decide what to get. My wife had already decided on the pasta Alfredo and I ordered one of the raviolis along with the fried mozzarella and a glass of wine for myself. The fried mozzarella came out very quickly and was very well done. The mozzarella wasn't breaded too much and the marinara that was on top was well spiced. Of course, the server had forgotten to give my wine order at the bar and so I had to get his attention to remind him. The entrees came out in a reasonable amount of time though. I had a taste of the pasta alfredo and it was really good, it was the right amount of rich and creamy, yet was not bland either. I'm not usually a alfredo sauce fan, but this one was among the best I've had. My ravioli was also pretty good, it had lots of artichokes and there were enough ravioli pieces to satisfy. This wasn't one of those ravioli dishes where you get only 4 pieces so I was happy.\\nBy this time, the service was improving somewhat. A different server came by now and then to check on us so we ended up ordering the mousse of the day which was chocolate and a cappuccino. These came out very quickly. The mousse was good, but way bigger than I expected and almost more like a cake than a mousse.

We arrived at 8pm on a Weds night to about a half full dining room. We chose to eat outside because of the nice weather.  Sitting on one of the elevated sidewalks overlooking 13th street, we also enjoyed the passing street traffic, mostly pedestrian. \\nWe started with a couple of drinks from the limited cocktail menu which seemed to emphasize easy drinking fro fro drinkgs which aren't our favs. I had a grapefruit, gin and something else. It was very drinkable but nothing outstanding. the other drink we ordred was the only interesting one on the menu: drambuie, orange peel, cognac, lemon and something else. It tasted more like an after dinner drink, however.\\nOur waiter was very friendly but clearly just leanring his job. He didn't know the cheese on the beet appetizer (but it was listed on the menu, so we didn't really care) and he spent a lot of his time chatting with a buddy at a nearby table. We like to be served slowly, so we didn't mind but if you wanted quicker service this might have been very irritating. let me get the two other complaints out of the way and then I can focus on what we did like: french fries were lousy--seemed old and they kept setting our used silverware back down on the wrought iron table which just seemed dirty. Either get a napkin to set them on or bring me new silverware.\\nThe food though was quite good: our beet appetizer stated it was salt roasted (we couldn't taste any salt) but the tomme cheese and arugula with an orange glaze was quite tasty. The salad with bacon bits and English peas was quite tasty even with the subsitute dressing of thousand island (which was more like a french dressing). The salad comes with bleu cheese but we didn't want that. They were happy to accomodate the change. Our mains included the boar ribs which were outstanding. The undercooked baked beans were still very flavorful rich with maple and spice. Even the potato salad was flavorful, a large serving with hard cooked eggs, green onions and mayo.  The other entree was a combination of two of their four sliders and the fries. The sliders included a hawaiian version with kobe beef, pineapple and ham. The beef itself was quite thin and could have been juicier but the grilled pineapple was a tasty accompaniment.  The other was called a \\"roscoe\\" and included fried chicken between waffles. The best part of tihs was the spicy mustard that came with it.  We ate almost all this food (except for tthe sub par fries).

I am happy to say it hasn't changed much since then.  As far as I can tell the decor has shifted a bit, but almost imperceptibly.  There is a quote from Charles Williams painted on the wall a giant frog near the ceiling, and the same booths and tables as always.  For years the greater trumps has specialized in two things providing a place to smoke cigars and try lots of different ports.   They offer a full bar and many beers and food from the Baghdad next door as well, but cigars and port are the focus.  It is a dark moody space with an aura of mystery and intellectualism about it.  It is not a \\"swanky\\" cigar bar.  My friends and I tend to have philosophical talks there that don't seem to come up anyplace else.  \\n\\nWith the new smoking ban McMenamins applied for and received clearance for Trumps to remain a cigar bar.  The only thing officially allowed to be smoked inside now are cigars.  I think the occasional pipe may not be noticed but they do have to be strict on cigarettes... no cigarettes, but OK for cigars.  seems silly to me, but that is the rules\\n\\nTonight had a nice port, watched my friend smoke a fancy cigar and discussed the veracity of religion, and the priority of individualism  Good times!"},{"name":"Piece of Cake","address":"3215 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My place of business does up birthdays right, and (up until recently) that includes the birthday person getting to pick out the cake for our office party.\\n\\nThus my entry into the wonderful world of Piece of Cake.\\n\\nThe white chocolate cake, as others mentioned below, is their crowning glory.

I agree with Jennifer T. that these are by no means Belgian waffles, because if they were the sandwiches would be like 4 inches high. They are just regular sized waffles. These soggy waffles you all speak of never found their way to my plate, but the only issue with the food is the pricing. The entrees are reasonably (cheaply) priced, but the sides and condiments are a little off. They might want to re-think some of that.\\n\\nMy only suggestion: 24 HOUR WAFFLE SANDWICHES!!

First, there is no maid service whatsoever, and a total BS explanation is provided on a notecard in every room which states that that this is an effort to be eco-friendly. Really? Being eco-friendly requires not making guests' beds at all, even if the same sheets are used? Give me a break. That's not being eco-friendly; that's just being cheap. Please don't insult your guests' intelligence by misrepresenting your plainly obvious rationale. To me, it doesn't matter if I can *request* maid service when you've initially chosen not to provide it for budgetary reasons, while falsely claiming environmental benevolence as your rationale. I resent the deceit and presumption that guests aren't perceptive enough to recognize it as such.\\n\\nSecond, for the interior facing rooms with windows overlooking the atrium, there are no exterior windows, which isn't that unusual, but this hotel adds insult to injury by not equipping these rooms with overhead ceiling lights, and the lamps are all quite dim.. So, not only is there no natural light unless you are ok exposing your room to the entire atrium, to have any reasonable amount of dim light, you have to make a lap around your room to turn on 7 or 8 different lamps. But even then the room remains dark and depressing. No one comes to Florida with the intention of staying in a dark and dreary hotel room.\\n\\nThird, the powdered eggs at the breakfast buffet are runny and disgusting. I never want a buffet if it involves inferior quality food. Also, it is equally offensive that you provide what are tantamount to shot glasses for the orange and cranberry juice, clearly to deter guests from drinking as much juice as they would like. No restaurant with table service would ever in a million years serve juice in glasses so small, so what would make it ok to do so in a buffet, where the only way to get a normal serving of juice is to walk back to the buffet three or four times?\\n\\nThe bottom line here is that this hotel cuts corners for budgetary reasons in extremely customer-unfriendly ways. Although the building is nice and the staff is friendly, the policies are the pluperfect opposite. I will never stay here again without confirmation that there have been real changes made."},{"name":"Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant","address":"120-8100 Ackroyd Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm giving the super star for the pork shanghai dumplings I couldn't help burning my mouth on.

I've visited this location many times to watch NBA and college basketball games.  The only differences between the two locations are more space and free parking (as opposed to valet) at the Brookhaven location.\\n\\nThe menus at both locations are the same -- standard bar fare (salads, wings, burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, etc.) and over 50 beers on tap.  The wings and burgers here are decent.  Try their Maker's Mark burger, which contains Maker's Mark Bourbon BBQ sauce, bacon, and crispy onions.  It's large, cooked-to-order, and the onions are nice and crispy.  While the food is average, I come here primarily to unwind and watch sports.\\n\\nI used to prefer the Midtown Hudson Grille to this one, but this location has grown on me.  I do like how it's generally less crowded and has a more laid back feel to it.  Inside, there are plenty of TVs with multiple feeds, making this a great place to watch games.  There are two main areas inside: the bar with high-top tables and booths surrounding and a longer, more traditional restaurant-style area with regular tables and booths.  No matter where you sit, you'll have several TVs around you.  I've yet to venture out to the patio.\\n\\nAs expected of any good sports bar, they carry many premium sports channels and packages including ESPNU, NBA TV, and NBA League Pass.  Since they have League Pass, they carry *every* NBA game during the regular season.  During the first round of the playoffs, I came here to watch the Spurs' Games 2 and 5 against the Memphis Grizzlies.  These two games of the series were only available on NBA TV, a channel I don't have at home.

I am unsure what origin the owner is, but every person who has had these drinks will tell you that the condense milk is truly what makes the drink.

Especially when you know them - Lucy is one of the sweetest, kindest folks you'll meet.

Be prepared to have your mind blown away here, from the initial seating to the service to the food. A+ experience. \\n\\nThis restaurant is pretty expansive and gets BUSY. I've been here on numerous occasions and sometimes have had to wait an hour for a table. Luckily, they have a cozy waiting area with appetizers and drinks that you can order. \\n\\nThe servers here all seem very passionate about the food and dining experience, so you know that you're being well taken care of. The menu is very carefully thought out and caters to a diversity of palates. Everyone in your group will find something on the menu they love. \\n\\nThey recommend ordering family style, so ordering a bunch of dishes to share across the table. Entrees can be ordered in regular size portions (~$30) or half size portions for $18. The serving sizes here are not ginormous as expected, but it's nice to get a flavor of multiple dishes in family style sharing. \\n\\nI have tried basically every vegetarian dish/item on the menu here, as well as multiple non-veg dishes. Vij's rotates his menu occasionally so you never get bored, but the classic favorites always stay on the menu. Those lamb popsicles. Mmm. The goat curry is a little watery for my liking. \\n\\nIf you come here looking for an ordinary Indian meal, you'll be disappointed. Everything here is unique and can't be found at other Indian restaurants. That's what's so great about it. Vegetarian dishes include jackfruit, portobello mushroom, koftas, layered paneer dishes, and more. My favorite non-veg dishes include the sablefish in tomato curry and the lamb popsicles marinated in wine in a fenugreek cream curry. Everything is just bursting with flavor and screams \\"Indian food redefined.\\" \\n\\nNote: Vij's curries are a little thinner in general compared to most Indian restaurants. Doesn't take away from the flavor most of the time, but makes them better suited to eat in rice than with naan. \\n\\nA lot of Yelpers complain about the price here. I get it, $30 for a curry is high especially when other Indian restaurants serve larger portion curries for $12. However, the dishes here are all so different! You're paying for upscale dining here, so be prepared to dish out. Like the service here is top notch. One time my server heard us quietly say the food was a bit spicy and within seconds he brought out yogurt for the table. Super attentive and shows that the restaurant clearly cares about customers. \\n\\nMy one complaint is that they no longer serve unlimited rice and naan with the food for free.

All you need to know is that it's the best thing on the menu, blew my BF and I away. Sweet potatoes, black beans, jalapeno, Tillamook cheese in a flour tortilla, sure all good, but then they go all genius on you and put jam inside. It's. SO. GOOD.

I always determine whether I'm going to go to the restaurant based on Yelp reviewers. If I see at least three reviews that have 4 or 5 stars I trust it. Jonae's had 4 stars. As soon as I went into the restaurant I noticed right away how clean it is. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was delish and what I expect from an authentic West Indian restaurant. I had brown chicken; in Boston I know it as stew chicken. It was tender, seasoned really well and tasted really good. On the same plate I got cabbage and carrots and rice and beans both were delicious; however the rice was a little bland, but by putting the sauce from the stew chicken on it made it taste much better. It also came with plantain which were sweet and delicious. I also got a side of mac and cheese. It looked like boxed mac and cheese but it tasted really good; they seasoned it well.

It detracted from the excellent balance they had with the grapow.  \\n\\n- The mixed greens they served were a small handful of the type you get at a grocer with no dressing at all.  Just the greens.  Some were wilted.  They were a distraction.\\n\\n- They put two deep fried wonton crisps on top which were overly greasy and didn't have much flavour.  \\n\\nSo overall it seems like they can get good flavours on the main part of the dish (which is no small feat!), and now just need to get the rest of the plate in order to move on up.

I normally review new places, but felt the exterior from the highway, location and the word \\"grill\\" would be a suitable place for an afternoon lunch.\\n\\nBoy, were we mistaken. The exterior as you get closer is very old and not well kept. Once we went inside, there was a musty smell, that resonates with an older building. The hostess was nice, but had over applied make up and attempted to look years younger than she really is. \\n\\nThe dining room is very outdated. I felt like I should be living in the late 60's. The first table had a full table, everyone in a suit enjoying coffee. The table behind us was a guy who was writing notes.  We sit down in the old uncomfortable booth, listening to music that was so mind numbingly boring. This music makes Kenny G sound like rock. As we sat down, a 2nd gentleman comes in to sit in the table behind us with the solo person writing notes. Our waitress makes a beeline past us to greet the table, and asks how her \\"2 favorite customers\\" are. This is when we really knew we were not going to enjoy this. So after 5 min of conversation, never asking if they want to order, the gentleman passes her his notes, and asks her to deliver these \\"love letters\\". After a few more minutes of conversation she disappears to do so. She then comes back, ignoring our table and letting the guy know she could not find one of the ladies. After a few more minutes she visits us.\\n\\nShe explained our questions on the menu and asked if we wanted any drinks. My wife and I both asked for water, as we were going to order brunch.\\n\\nThe food was the only bright spot in this place. That is not saying much however, as it was over seasoned, cooked and perhaps previously frozen. I ordered the french toast, with potato cakes and turkey sausage. The sausage had obviously been frozen and probably purchased from some low quality bulk dealer. It was not seasoned and really tasted bland. At least it was edible. The french toast, was not seasoned properly. The cinnamon was not spread out well, and there were pieces that had none, while other pieces had a concentrated amount. The potato cakes were mushy and did not seem they were made at the restaurant. I really wonder if everything they make is frozen food? My wife had the same sides with the California Omelet. The egg seemed over cooked, but the avocado was fresh and good. \\n\\nAt this point, we had already decided we would not come back. However, the real kicker was when we received the bill. We were charged $2.50 for a glass of tap water each. Perhaps, when my wife and I are retired and want to visit with other older folks, we would visit there again for brunch, however the charge for water, quickly erased their thoughts. We left sad, depressed and confused why such a place could, would and does exist. What had been a great afternoon together, ended with such a lackluster lunch. I never felt so defeated leaving a business before.\\n\\nI can not recommend this place to anyone. The owner needs to update the space to be within the last decade at the very least, and need to hire new cooks. This place feels like it would really benefit from a show like Kitchen Nightmares to come by and overturn the whole organization."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"A bit of Cuba in Jamaica Plain!  Food is good for such an inexpensive place, and portions are very generous.  Mostly hispanic clientele, so you get the message.  I think the chicken and fish are the best, as the pork dishes are a bit on the dry side.  No alcohol, but that gives the place a vibrant, family atmosphere.  The many, many photos on the walls tell a heartfelt story about the 'old country'."},{"name":"Vij's Restaurant","address":"3106 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I'll start this review by saying the food at Vij's is absolutely phenomenal. Rated based on food alone, this would easily be a 5-star review. The highlights:\\n\\n-jackfruit and cardamom curry: I recommend ordering this, partially because it's such a unique menu item. The curry itself was fragrant with just the right amount of spice.\\n-lamb popsicles: listen to the other reviews: you must order this. Incredibly flavorful, very tender. The cream-based curry was light and delicious. Accompanied by spinach and potatoes. Perfection!\\n-rajasthani spicy goat: usually goat has a strong aroma and aftertaste, but this was really well done - Vij's somehow kept this really light. Fantastic flavor.\\n\\nThe common thread here: the food is innovative, an excellent fusion take on Indian dishes. Somehow packs a lot of flavor without being too heavy. Not overhyped in the slightest, in my opinion. I also disagree with the reviews that pan this restaurant based on it being \\"not authentic\\" enough...honestly, it's a fusion upscale type of restaurant and you're judging it on the wrong criteria. \\n\\nDespite the fantastic, 5-star quality food, here's why I'm only giving it 3 stars:\\n\\n-The wait is ridiculous, and the service does not mitigate this problem. Yes, it's a Friday night and 45 minutes really isn't too bad. But when you're waiting in a lounge area, and every other party is called before yours (including those who arrived after you) without any explanation or notice from the wait staff, that doesn't set a good first impression. And, this all occurred after I had called ~10 min prior and asked how long the wait was; the answer: \\"not too bad at all\\".\\n\\n-I appreciate the complimentary appetizers and lounge area (instead of waiting outside like in the previous location). But, this new lounge area could easily accomodate 30+ more guests; wouldn't this space be better used to expand the main dining area and serve more people, thereby reducing wait times? \\n\\n-Once seated, service was again rather inattentive. I thought the main server who initially explained the menu was fantastic and did a great job, but then somebody else came to take our order? Confusing, and again totally fine in the name of efficiency, but there was no explanation given for this. Complimentary naan and rice: yay -- but it was really hard to track people down to actually ask for this!\\n\\n-30 minute wait between when we finished our appetizer to when our entr√©es came out. Again, I completely get that a busy kitchen can be challenging on a Friday night. But we were never approached by servers telling us our dishes would be out soon, and we were not provided any naan or rice during this time period either.\\n\\nI appreciate the merits of leisurely dining, but this was a bit much. And again, if I felt like service was present and attentive, that would be a much different matter. \\n\\nOverall, there are some serious problems to iron out at this restaurant. I would recommend trying Vij's for the food in the case that you can snag a table without much of a wait. Otherwise, you'll inadvertently be in for a 3 hour dinner experience during which you will be hungry the majority of the time."},{"name":"BD's Mongolian Grill","address":"3977 Worth Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Soup, salad, and egg roll appetizer were good.

It's actually a clear soup that has no flavour, definitely not of seafood or lobster.  Not sure why it's not listed in The soup section of the menu.  The crab Rangoon was disgusting and overcooked.  The sliced pork was chewy as hell.  The rice was so overcooked and the teriyaki chicken tasted like absolutely nothing.  The egg drop soup was also flavorless.

But I can happily say that my experience was pleasant from start to finish.  \\n\\nWe arrived on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm which meant that the place was hopping with lunch goers looking to catch their football game.  Thankfully they offer the NFL ticket and a bevvy of normal TVs hung from the ceiling--in the bar area as well as all over the dining room.  Our host sat us fairly quickly and near the game we wanted.  We were elated to discover that individual sound boxes are one the tables so you can actually hear your game and see it, all at the same time!  \\n\\nNachos (a football staple) seemed to be the likely choice so we decided to test their skills.  The dish was large, covered in shredded cheese and topped with bbq chicken.  The salsa served on the side looked as if it was homemade and packed a flavorful punch.  They hit the spot and were adequately priced at $9.  \\n\\nBecause it was a cold and rainy Orlando day, the next obvious decision for my boyfriend was to order their Hot Bag of Donuts.  For $6 you are served 6 warm donuts, in a white bag, that have been tossed in cinnamon and sugar.  They smell heavenly and looked absolutely delicious.  They come with two dippings sauces: chocolate and a strawberry cream.  He commented that the sauces could have been better but that overall he was a happy camper.

Nope.  \\n\\nFirst, lets talk coffee.  Its awful.  That's just the truth.  Watery, flavorless, blah.  You're a coffee place, figure out how to make coffee.  Lesson 101.\\n\\nThe breakfast tacos were rocking for a while, but they started suffering serious quality control issues.  Somedays the tacos would be greasy monstrosities.  One day they decided to put my taco on the panini press or something.  So it came with these grill marks and the tortilla was all hard and dried out.  Nice.  One day I ordered a taco with potatoes, not realizing they put those shoestring potatoes on everything.  Lame.  I was kind of digging the Sol taco for a while, but come on, the thing is like redonkulous huge and has every known breakfast taco item known to mankind on it.  Gluttony only works up to a point.\\n\\nThen there's the 'bakery' part.  They stopped carrying a lot of their baked goods, which kind of makes the 'bakery' part a misnomer, no?\\n\\nThen they expanded to this full menu.  My gf ordered chicken tenders one time.  Don't know why.  Some people like chicken tenders.  Anyway, they were basically burnt bits of fried chicken.  Inedible.  \\n\\nThe staff: please take some anti-depressants people.

Very unique tacos and we're not talking about Taco Deli or Torchy's unique. We're talking chicken and waffle taco, Falafels, Banh Mi, Pull Pork BBQ, Fried Paneer, Poke Bowls, Fried Tofu or Tikka Masala inside a taco unique. I do praise this place but the only thing is that is SO HEAVY. Everything they make is to make you extremely full and extremely sluggish later. Open late so definitely satisfying to the bar goers. I do recommend to try at least once and come perhaps one or twice a year for the health's sake.\\n\\nThe Fried Paneer Taco is the vegetarian best seller. It is cornstarch, or tempera fried, so it has an extra thick but light and fresh outer fried coating and a melty cube of cheese in the center topped with a white creamy ranch like sauce. Spicy oil from the fry seeping on the sides and dripping down from the taco. For refreshment, sweet pickled red onion tops it with cilantro. (Still way too heavy for me though). Also had Elote corn with bacon (ok, enough for me) and then Loaded Fried Tator Tots with cheese and bacon (well, I guess I'll try one spoo, ugh...)\\n\\nUnlike Houston or Dallas locations, the wait is minimal and not detouring me somewhere else instead.

My friend got a half dozen of their oysters and couldn't stop raving about them.  I was tempted, but I was stuffing myself on my food.  The clam chowder was very good, pretty standard stuff.  The cod was okay, tasty yes,  but I felt like the batter was a bit thick and while it was crispy on the outside, you had to bite through a layer of it to get to the fish.  Also, I appreciated that the fish was a filleted piece rather than a fish stick.  The special was $10.99 if i remember correctly.\\n\\nThe service here was okay, there was mainly one waitress serving every table and I felt kinda bad since she was constantly running around taking orders, delivering food, getting people drinks, etc.  I mean, can she get a little help?

Inside, basically is one long room. The acoustics are bad and it gets so loud in there, especially when the clientele is there to watch a game. I felt like I was yelling to be heard to the person sitting across from me, I was straining to hear what they were saying and it was all-in-all not a good experience.\\n\\nNow, food is great, just like their Short North location. Love the menu. Staff and service is great. Laid back atmosphere and they have a great bar spanning an entire wall of the space, so if you're going to hang, drink, game watch, etc. it's perfect but sit outside to dine or lunch if weather permits (I really hope they enclose it for winter).

The cakes are oh-so-pretty and there are all sorts of random goodies along cleaning looking, brightly lit shelves.  I was excited to try the green tea cake and \\"wife cakes,\\" and highly intrigued by the taro something. [Aside: wife cakes = flaky shell pastry filled with sugared melon goodness]\\n\\nThe green tea cake had a fluffy-ish texture, which was nice but it's not nearly green tea-y for my preference.  The wife cakes were decent - the shell was loose and flaky and the filling was moist albeit not sweet enough.  To be fair though, I am uber picky when it comes to wife cakes so I am probably judging them a little harshly on that.  As for the taro something... I still don't know what it is exactly.  I fail as a Chinese person and could only understand from the Chinese only sign that it was supposed to be taro ____.  Aside from the funky purple layer of something (too bland to tell) outside and the vaguely purplish stuff inside, it doesn't remind me of taro at all.  [Hello bland bland bland].\\n\\nTaste wise, Yi Soon is definitely second string to the Chinatown bakeries (well except Bao Bao because that place reeeeaks even more than North Station).  Value wise, Yi Soon is pretty cheap by American bakery standards, but somewhat overpriced compared to the Chinatown ones.  \\n\\nI will probably come back to Yi Soon because going to Chinatown from my borderline boonie apt is just sooooo far, but I am not expecting to fall madly in love.  I did like the lady as the counter though - she seemed a little confused as to if she should speak to me in English or Chinese and was really cute, in a she kind of reminds me of my grandma sort of way."},{"name":"Basta","address":"410 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Bastas Trattoria was my first real meal during a visit back to Portland, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

My son brought the situation to the manager's attention in defense of server.  However, the server had many customers, and she was all over the place trying to attend to customer requests, so we did not get the best of service.  I have tried to do takeout with them before.  My order was not prepared with care.  Some of my items were missing.  TGI Friday's Camp Creek, please do an in-service training of your staff people.

I was not, however, willing to overlook bad service. \\n\\nThe good? The bar is still great and the service there is good.  Afternoon tea is still lovely and the service there is still good.\\n\\nNow, on to the hotel stay...\\n\\nI stayed here on Thursday, September 21 and Friday, September 22.  So I checked in mid-week which isn't super crowded.  \\n\\nWhen my cab arrived, there were several bellmen by the door chatting.  None of them came to my cab to help me with my luggage.  When I made it to the door with my suitcase, a bellman finally asked me if he could give me a hand with my luggage.  He then carried my luggage to the desk and waited for a tip.\\n\\nI had arrived about 45 minutes early so I checked in and asked if my room might be ready.  (It had been a long trip and it would have been great to freshen up.) The woman at reception said that their \\"system\\" was down and she would have to contact the housekeeping staff.  She took my mobile number and assured me that she would call when it was ready.\\n\\nI went to the cafe for coffee since there was almost no place to sit in the lobby.  Apparently, the Taj has leased out most of the space that was once included in the Ritz lobby. The cafe was lovely, and the service was excellent.  I waited for a half hour and did not receive a call, so I returned to reception where the woman I had spoken to acted as if I had never talked to her.  I was again told that the \\"system\\" was down and I would have to wait. At this point, it is only 15 minutes before the official check-in time.\\n\\nThis time I waited in a chair across from reception.  I watched as three people were immediately checked in with no questions asked.  Finally, at precisely 3PM the woman I had initially spoken with called me over and indicated that my room was ready.\\n\\nI was then given my suitcase back, and I proceeded alone to my room.  I was given no additional instruction or directions...\\n\\nI arrived at my room which was large but rather sparsely furnished. There was only one comfortable chair, so I was glad that I was traveling alone.  The room was clean, but there was a huge dark stain on the carpeting next to the bed.  The room looked pretty tired and in need of refurbishing but it was large, clean, bright and quiet.\\n\\nThe bathroom was VERY small, but it was clean and well appointed.  Even though the bath was small, it was very pretty.\\n\\nThe turndown service included turning the TV on, drawing the drapes, putting bottles of water at the bedside and filling the ice bucket.  No fancy chocolates here.  \\n\\nRoom service was prompt, and the service was cheerful, but the continental breakfast included dry croissants and barely ripe fruit.\\n\\nI stayed at this hotel during the last year it was the Ritz.  At that time it was in need of refurbishing, but the service was fantastic, and it was incredibly well appointed.  Just a bit worn.  When it was the Ritz, you felt special to be there.  I remember trying to walk out into the rain and being stopped by a bellman who insisted I borrow a Riz umbrella if I was going to walk.  Not only does the Taj not offer you an umbrella, they have plastic bags and a sign asking you to please not let YOUR umbrella drip all over their lobby.\\n\\nI am so very sad to leave such an awful review, but I love this building, and it breaks my heart to see the level of service and care to have deteriorated to this extent.  This is the best location in Boston.  Too bad the hotel is such a bad experience.  If it were an inexpensive place to stay, I would still recommend it based solely on the location.  Unfortunately, it is expensive and has poor service.  \\n\\nI will stay at the Lenox next time.

I asked if they could turn the air down and the guy that sat us said they couldn't because of the hot hibachi grills. That made no sense at all. I went to the bathroom and noticed there were empty tables and it was much warmer in those areas.  So he lied of course.  Even the family that sat next to us was freezing.

Really nice open space, clean, bright  and comfortable.  First time I stopped in I couldn't tell if it was a patron on the bar itself but someone smelled really good.  Not restaurant good but kinda like strawberry starburst.   When I returned the smell was absent so it must have been a fluke. \\n\\nThe beer selection is on point.  Lots of local beers and some you don't usually see available in restaurants. (Weihenstephaner is a nice break from bars with their usually IPA forward selections) \\n\\nThe first meal I had was only an app, the Mezze plate and it was pretty mundane.  Plenty of limp celery and carrot slices with pita triangles that got wet, a small cup of katamala olives and a soupy tomato, cucumber feta salad . \\n\\nJust a boring and flavorless attempt at a fresh summer dish, it could have benefitted from some hummus. \\n\\nOn my second trip I brought my wife along.  Beautiful day outside and they had the street side windows open.  Weymouth landing isn't the sexiest of locations but there's a certain charm to the suburban hustle and bustle and enjoyable to people watch with a couple of beers. \\n\\nBeer selection was still top notch.  It's not super exciting but a style for just about anyone.  The bartender made my wife a mixed drink with mint, watermelon and other mixers and she absolutely loved it (she lived the next one even more) \\n\\nThe food this time around was much better.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was fantastic.  It was juicy and the spicy slaw on top of it added a nice touch of heat and a cold crunch .  The fries were good too.  Pretty salty but enjoyable, especially paired with my wife's meal which was the chili. \\n\\nLet's get the bad out of the way here.  This might be he saddest looking chili I've ever seen.  Looked like a watery mole sauce with some cheese melted on top.\\n\\nBut never judge a book by its cover.  This was absolutely delicious.

The place feels crisp and clean and comfortable. The huge windows make for great people watching while you enjoy your burger.\\n\\nThe staff were very friendly and prompt. They are enthusiastic about the place and you can tell they try their best to ensure you are having a good time.\\n\\nNow to the important part, they real reason why you come to this place, the burgers. Overall I would say they are average for what you pay. I had the Stackhouse burger which consists of:  prime rib patty, pancetta, portabellini, guinness cheddar on a brioche bun. \\n\\nFirst the bun, brioche buns are nice but It's not my thing on a burger. They are a little to rich and a tad on the  sweet side so for my tastes they don't seem to match with the meat.\\n\\nNext the meat, prime rib patty. The meat was pretty good but could use a little more seasoning. I don't think i'm sold on using prime rib over something like ground chuck, then again I work with computers not food so i'm no expert here.\\n\\nThe cheese? Well i'm not sure how much Guinness cheddar really adds to the overall product compared to some of the other aged cheddars out there.\\n\\nWould  I come back? Sure I would, but right now it's not a place that I would put on my regular lunch pick list.\\n\\nSince I really want to see this place succeed here's a suggestion for the owners: \\n\\nYou use some great high end ingredients in your burgers which is nice, but sometimes the best burgers are the simplest ones. Offer me a burger with fresh regular buns baked that morning with a simple aged cheddar and a ground chuck patty with some of your seasonings. If i had the choice between something like this at $10-$12 over the Stackhouse burger, this would win 9 times out of 10, it could even convert me from a casual eater to a regular lunch visitor."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We're from out-of-town and took a chance on this strip mall restaurant and boy, are we glad we did!!

So, we did The Wave because we were super hungry. There was little to no wait at The Wave, so we were able to pretty much walk right in with no reservations, no problem. You can order a la carte at the Wave, but the server informed us that if you did the buffet, the drink was included. This seemed to be the better deal because most a la carte items are over $12 and drinks are $3, the buffet is $22. The food on the buffet is exactly the same as Chef Mickey's, there may be a few exceptions because it is smaller, but the mainstays are still there - mickey waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, etc. etc. The buffet also features eggs benedict, sweet potato pancakes, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and yogurt.

And since we start coming regularly, if went out of his way to make some dish that weren't on the menu. And oh my god, those were all excellent, and fresh. And that's how come we kept coming back because every day was a different experience.\\n\\nAbout the place:  Well we found it via yelp because of the great recent reviews, it's actually a very cosy place, with very friendly staff. Some staff made us laugh because they would actually spend their tips on the sushi. The chef laughs about it, says they work just to eat sushi. Yes it's that great in my opinion.\\n\\nAbout the sushi: Well most of the time we went for very traditional sushi, so we didn't try too many rolls, but the few we tried were excellent, we didn't go for the habachi, teriyaki and all that sort. The tempura also were great. But sushi and Sashimi we thought it was just awesome.  I'll post some of the pictures.\\n\\nWe also tried some premium sushis, like the Uni, the O-toro, lobster, Abalone, Jumbo Amaeibi, Jumbo prawn, fresh sea bass. Tomorrow he promised us some fresh crab. And we look forward to that. We end up spending more than we intended simply because the sushi were really great and we end up eating all the premium fish. But it was all worth it. \\n\\nSome other notes worth mentioning:\\n\\nThe chef makes his own soya sauce so it's not bought off the shelf. He also makes some special sauce on his own that he applies to each sushi. \\nHe has some wasabi oil that he puts on the sushi, the cuts are great, the fish is fresh. Honestly one the best sushi we've had. \\n\\nIf you are around make sure to stop by, and ask for the o-toro which is a real bargain currently at $4 a piece.

My friend got the snapper tostada that was recommended to her. It was quite tiny for her to share with her boyfriend. They each had about 3 bites. My husband got the pork belly carnitas tlacoyo as a main dish, and it appeared to be very small with half the plate looking as if it needed a side to go with it. He did say it was delicious and well made, I believe it could have been improved with more of a plate. I had the green chorizo tlayuda which was like a chorizo tostada. This was also very tasty, but I definitely had an appetite after eating it. I know our dishes weren't supposed to be entrees, but we also didn't want to spend $20+ each on our main course. I think going here for tapas is the best option if you don't want to spend a lot. \\n\\nThe service was decent, nothing to rave about though. Our waitress was pretty attentive and kind. She did have another employee who knew more about whiskey to come over and explain what my friend's options were for drinks. \\n\\nAfter our experience, we felt like Suerte is definitely a try once kind of restaurant rather than come back routinely."},{"name":"Cafe Mozart Bakery","address":"5938 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 109","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"It's a pretty standard Korean bakery in terms of food and drinks, but you gotta love it because it's new lol.  Because it's new, everything looks really fresh and clean.  Hopefully, this keeps up for a while.  Also, the place itself is HUGE; the seating capacity is comparable to that of WW if not larger.  I'm also a fan of the more \\"mellow\\" and modern feel of the design here: white walls, gray (dark green?) floor, with wooden and metal accents.  Something about it is really relaxing; you can lose track of time in there especially if you're studying / working.  Also, there's plenty of power outlets for your charging needs.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this place isn't exactly a secret anymore; so it will get pretty packed in the evenings especially on the weekends.

I ordered the pretzels and cheese appetizer, and an entree. The pretzels were alright, but the cheese was very bland. The entree was so average that I cannot even remember what it was, only that it was terribly average and forgettable. Maybe the chef was having an off day, but the food suffered nonetheless. \\n\\nI've heard that this place is packed in the later drinking hours and during games.

Yesterday we spent the morning volunteering and then wrapped up grabbing lunch at Taco Mac.  There were forty of us.  Taco Mac knew ahead of time that we would be coming and had our tables ready for us.  While that was great, what surprised me is that they only had two servers at our tables which eventually dwindled to one.   I feel bad that I cannot remember his name but I have to say for such a large party, he did a good job of getting everyone's orders right and bringing us second and third requests.  He did look a bit miserable though (can't blame the guy!) and service was as good as you can expect for a one person to forty ratio.  As for the food, I got the greek hummus wrap and thought it was interesting.  It was basically a greek salad w/hummus wedged inside of a spinach tortilla.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't something I would not go out of my way to order either.  Salad dressing inside of a wrap just had a strange taste to it.  On the other hand, the fries that came with the wrap were delicious.  They were long and crispy with a soft interior.  The salt was just right.  Honestly I would've been happy with just a big bowl of fries as my meal, they were terrific.  Price-wise, it was not bad to get a tab of $8 and change for a filling meal.  Oh, and I'm not sure if other reviewers have pointed it out - there is a parking deck next door where you can park in and Taco Mac will validate the parking .

We are not oyster experts, but they definitely looked different from our friends' oysters who have ordered the same thing.\\n\\nWe went back recently with a reservation for two at 5pm. The hostess guided us all the way to the back by the washrooms to our table.

She basically told us no and gave an excuse that didn't make sense (\\"just because of the way the reservations and the whole thing worked\\"), before I could question her more, she walked away. This was unacceptable as we were not walk-ins; we had reservations and the tables were both for 2 people. It did not affect any reservations. In addition to that, we were only given the regular menus without the drink menu or happy hour menu. The people seated beside us offered their happy hour menu to us instead. Later on while we were eating, the hostess came by to clean and wipe the table next to us. My husband got sprayed on the arm with the cleaning agent. That meant that our food might have been sprayed too (it's a small table). We brought it to the attention of our waiter and luckily he said the spray was only water, but still she should have been more careful with the spray while people are eating! When we left the restaurant, there was nobody waiting to be seated and the hostesses were just standing there chatting.

They offered the menu with Happy Hour and All you can eat - also a menu book. The menu book is helpful because it reveals more details on the rolls they serve from the AYCE menu. \\n\\nThe water here was ok tasted funny and I had drench it with bunch of lemons to make it feasable to drink.

I ordered Rainbow roll which was the most decent one than the rest of the rolls I ordered. 2/3 of the rolls I ordered were tempura fried. When took a bite of the tempura rolled rolls - it was HOT! Couldnt even eat throughout because it was too warm to chew! I was soooo hungry that I kept chewing anyway.\\n\\nThe rule to the AYCE menu is any sushi roll pcs leftover - you will get charge per piece that is left. Also no sharing. \\n\\nThe house salad was lukewarm with ginger sauce - the salad dressing actually good. Just lukewarm to eat. \\n\\nThe dessert was actually good - Fried Cheesecake with Green Tea ice cream. \\n\\nThe service here was bad imo - if you hear diners complain etc and food takes toooo long - its a turn off. The icing on the cake was I ordered another set of 2 pcs \\"egg cake\\" nigiri and Squid Tempura.. The squid tempura was never cooked because server forgot and the Nigiri came out as 2 triangle pcs of egg cake NOT NIGIRI. \\n\\nI quickly got up the woman server apologized etc to me while I was walking to pay the pill the teen server stated to me they are cooking the squid tempura and I couldnt stand waiting any longer for long wait on food.

My friend ordered the miso soup and said it was the best he's had in Orlando. \\n\\nWhy the three star rating? The rolls were just so-so, but I think it was because my dining companion and I have radically different sushi preferences. We tried a few rolls with cream cheese, tempura flakes and panko (the menu is loaded with 'em). I'm not a fan of overdone sushi and I think those ingredients took away from the flavor of the fish and vegetables. My favorite roll, by far, was the spicy tuna roll; the tuna was fresh and there was just enough spice and heat. \\n\\nI'm definitely going to return to Sushi Katana and sample some different rolls and the sashimi."},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Shabu shabu...buffet style for $20 per person?

Obviously, my friends and I went crazy. \\n\\nBroth definitely has a different taste from other shabu places I've been but its good. Just an FYI, they do charge an extra $4 on broth...which we didn't know. We ended up with a lot of seafood, a lot of meat, and a few vegetables. The seafood was pretty good and the meat OK...compared to other shabu places, this meat was a bit dry...and the sauce they provided wasn't flavorful enough. \\n\\nService was OK. Not the greatest. They forgot to give us rice, which we had to ask a busboy for and they forgot a few things on the paper that we checked off...but at that point, we were too full to really get into it. Not really the greatest service...could of been better and more professional. \\n\\nI wish they told us beforehand but apparently, they only accept a maximum of two credit cards per tables. In any student/young adult group setting, we all usually pay with our own cards when we have no cash, and MOST places don't mind charging each card...apparently, this place does.\\n\\nIn the end, I rather pay the $25 for better quality meat in the other shabu places.

That there showed me how sanitary this place is. He should have had a rolling trashcan and a separate door to put it out of or at least a trash can on wheels. That's my opinion.

The chips were fresh and crisp.\\n- Carne asada: Really well seasoned and prepared and very filling. Comes with beans, rice, shredded lettuce a small amount of guacamole. And several piping hot corn tortillas. The hunk of beef cuts easily so you can fill up one of the tortillas to make a taco, which we all do, right? The rice and lettuce were useless.\\n- Charro beans: Eh. Not the best. Considering how little flavor they get out of the added meat, I'd recommend making the beans vegetarian.\\n- Bean chalupas (some might call these tostadas): One of the few vegetarian options. Mexican food in general often isn't very friendly to vegetarians and La Hacienda does nothing to dispel that notion.

The place is definitely funky and easily worthy of the Austin motto of \\"Keep Austin Weird\\".  The food, while not what I would consider gourmet, was very flavorful.  Every item that the four of us ordered was tasty, filling, and unique.  And, I usually don't admire the \\"texture\\" of food but, the food had lots of crunch (when appropriate).  We started off with the fried oysters (a specialty according to the waitress - she was on target) and a few drinks.    (By the way:  The drinks were very reasonably priced and strong.)  I got a great Caesar Salad that they mistakenly divide onto two plates for my wife and I to split.  It was just as well since \\"my half\\" was plenty for both of us and we brought \\"her half\\" home.  My wife had the Divorced Trout which was way more than she could handle so she shared with me.  It was great!  I crudely put a part of my trout on one of the biscuits they brought for the table.  My make-shift fish sandwich was awesome.  Our dinner partners shared a steak that they loved - although it appeared a little too rare.  (At Ranch 616 if you ask for rare, you get rare.  I can't complain about that.)  Also, the table got a side order of onion rings and jalapenos.  I highly recommend this for all future diners!  If I had one complaint it would be the noise.  When we first arrived at 6:45 (on a Thursday), the noise level was reasonable (and fun) but by about 8:00 is was loud (and obnoxious).  By 8:00 we wished we had sat outside where the noise would not have been so suffocating.

They seemed fairly busy and about to get busier. Our server was very nice and checked in with us often. We ordered a couple margaritas, the queso with chorizo, bacon wrapped jalapenos and a cup of their tortilla soup. The queso was good, loaded with pico and meat, but not the best I've had. I really enjoyed their jalapeno poppers, though they could have had more heat. I didn't personally try the soup but was told it was delicious. I had the shrimp salad and it was great! The mango vinaigrette dressing is subtle on the mango, which I prefer. There was a fair amount of shrimp and they were very good. It is a large salad, more like an entree salad. \\nThe ambiance of the Matador doesn't scream \\"Mexican restaurant\\" so much as Spanish Gothic night club.

I selected some smaller pastries.

While the culinary experience is certainly different from the cloud-soft bites in hip GF cupcakeries, an open palate will enjoy the old-fashioned farmstead flavor in their baked goods. It's a \\"whole-grain\\" tasting sweetness without the allergens. A tip: try to get the goods same day, the next day they are noticeably preservative-free-tasting! \\n\\nThe Vibes:\\nI love that it is located in the cheerful Boston Public Market (major plus) and the staff seem reserved but quite friendly and accommodating.

It's just folks trying to hurt and help the cafe because of recent political controversy. \\n\\nAn honest break-down of comments:\\n\\n1. Cleanliness/Smell: any review suggesting that the Red & Black Cafe smells bad is utter B.S. These comments come from people who want to hurt the cafe's reputation and are just assuming a radical place must be filled with dirt and foul smells. Having visited the place this afternoon, I can honestly say that I was surprised at how clean and well-organized the cafe was, and that includes the bathroom.\\n\\n2. The food: ignore all comments from people who are not used to eating vegan food. They expect the flavors of animal fats and dairy in all of their foods and aren't used to tasting grains, herbs, and vegetables without other substances. That said, I think the rice & beans could use less cilantro-- it was incredibly overpowering.\\n\\n3. The coffee: strong! Yeah, it's a little bitter because of this, but dang, you'll be up finishing that book or article for hours after a mug-full.\\n\\n4. The \\"unwelcome\\" attitude: five bucks says the customers who felt uncomfortable weren't exactly emanating non-judgmental vibes themselves.

We had a great time chatting with the buzz around the restaurant. \\n\\nService: 5/5 - you order at the front and wait for your name to get called, nothing special.\\n\\nFood: 3/5 - so this is obviously where the stars fall. We got a fair amount of tacos and they tasted interesting but it wasn't an amazing experience. The Cuban Pig is definitely a pass, but the brisket was notably good. I've definitely had a better specialty taco elsewhere. The elote was good, but a little too salty for my taste. Queso was alright, pretty unique but nothing to go crazy over. The red velvet cake was good but, just a normal cake you can find at any drugstore bakery. \\n\\nOverall, it was a mediocre experience. If the atmosphere wasn't as great as it was, we would have had a less-than-good experience here. It's a good place to try out, since we only had three of the many taco choices!"},{"name":"PJP Cleaning Services","address":"1 Bromfield St, Ste 5","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went from being decent to OK to completely unreliable. They drive out all their good employees over time. No shows, several hours of delay, constant excuses (traffic, they had an accident, someone is sick) and waste hours and hours of your time for mediocre service.\\n\\nUtter incompetence. Stick to the top few on Yelp list, strongly recommend avoiding this place."},{"name":"Nook","address":"781 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I thank to the staff for creating a great evening for us. It was a tired, crappy and moody evening when my girlfriend had an idea for a walking to this place. I was a little concern about the line-up, but it was well worth a short wait.. When we were seated at the bar, we were immediate greet by the bartender (I think it's the owner). He was patient, informative and funny, which makes our mood much more pleasant. We order the Rigatoni Boscaiola and Prosciutto pizza. The pasta was well cooked and we both loved the taste of the pizza a lot. It was a thin crest pizza, topped with arugula and prosciutto and cheese. All I can say, it was not heavy, but light and refreshing with every bite.\\nJust a note, if you go to this place with more than 4 people, I don't recommended to this place and you will have to wait for a long time for your table."},{"name":"Conin Mexican Cuisine","address":"9111 S Barbur Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Been exploring in hopes of finding good Mexican food that doesn't looked like the processed stuff you get at chain restaurants.

The bar was gorgeous and the furniture was great as well.  They have one of the largest couches I have ever seen.  It was fun to be able to eat on the couch.

The wine menu was decent as well.\\n\\nI tried the veggie burger as they do not have many other options for us veg-heads.  It was okay - homemade, but very mushy.  We all agreed that the mustard greens and edamame left something to be desired.  \\n\\nAlthough they have a couple of tvs, this is not a sports bar.

I'm vegan, and had to let the kitchen know in advance so that they could prep accordingly. For a place that doesn't emphasize its vegan cuisine, the chef prepared an exquisite, well-rounded meal; it was undeniably the best meal I've ever had. The server was also super accommodating and generously provided a few different wine pairings for each of the dishes, in order to cover the bases for flavor pairings. I hardly ever write reviews, but this experience is something I hope other folks - especially couples with an omnivore & an herbivore - can enjoy as much as we did.

I would not recommend that to anyone, unless you are a vegetarian.  The flavor was fine, but I was still very hungry after that bullshit snack.

Every birthday and special celebration has included a cake from White's.  Therefore, it was very disappointing and upsetting when the cake we had most recently was well below their standard.  As we cut it, it was falling apart.  We contacted White's and explained the situation.  The lack of concern or good customer service from them was quite surprising.  They eventually relented and said to return the cake. \\n\\nWhen the cake was brought to them, they would not refund what we had paid for it.  Worst of all, they laughed at my father and he could see them mock him in the back room.  Rather than coming out to speak to him, they sent out one of the young girls to deliver the message that he could have a partial store credit and his money would not be refunded.\\n\\nRegardless of how much we have enjoyed the bakery goods at White's, the poor treatment of a long time customer has just caused the loss of business of our family (11 adults and many children)."},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Great service and food the patio was hot but with a cold beer got better my whole family members had a great time and this place never disappoint me."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],j={key:0},G={key:1};function D(s,e,n,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",G,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(E,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-410b6bdf"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/47.md","filePath":"quotesmag/47.md"}'),L={name:"quotesmag/47.md"},Y=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
