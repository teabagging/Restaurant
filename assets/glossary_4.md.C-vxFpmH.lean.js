You know those moments when you eat a particular food in a particular setting and it seems a transcendent moment? Sounds corny, I know, but so it was for us several years ago for the incredible food we ordered from the then Pok Pok trailer and carried to the picnic table to eat on the sidewalk on a bright but chilly Portland afternoon. We liked Thai food to that point and, in fact, we had even had some of what we think was the best available in the US through making a couple of pilgrimages to Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. But it was transcendent for us, that first lunch at Pok Pok, for what was possible in Thai cooking and how it nourished our bodies and spirits. We've been fans ever since and weren't surprised at the success and growth of Mr. Ricker's efforts.. \\n\\nSomething else we really admire is that success has not spoiled Pok Pok. It seems to continue the remarkable trajectory of focus and success. Thanks to Mr. Ricker. He well deserves the James Beard Award for Best Chef NW. \\n\\nYou deserve to eat at Pok Pok if you haven't done that yet! Or to go back if you have.

The advertised drink specials for the bar were $3 vodka drinks. When we went up to order our drinks, the bartender told us that whiskey drinks were the only ones part of the special, and charged us $54 for 5 vodka cocktails. Later on, we went back up to the bar to a different bartender and were told vodka was in fact part of the specials and we should have only been charged $3 per drink, totaling $15 for 5 drinks. When confronted, the bartender who overcharged us said that she didn't know vodka was part of the specials (even though every other bartender who worked there knew). When we brought this up to the manager, Will, he dealt with it in the most unprofessional manner I have ever experienced in my life. Even though the bartender admitted she overcharged us, the manager would not refund us our money. He then backtracked and tried to tell me that the $3 drinks specials were \\"not real and were only advertised to lure people into the bar\\" which is simply not true, and also illegal. Every other bar that was part of the bar crawl honored the drink specials they advertised. The manager refused to deal with it in the right way and was being extremely rude and talking down to us. The only thing he offered us was one round of drinks which would have only totaled $15, nothing close to the $54 we paid. He never even apologized for what happened. He did not refund our money and was not trying at all to find a proper solution to the situation that his bartender caused.

The lobster roll was packed with savory, buttered lobster and had a really delicious bun. The buttermilk coleslaw served with it went really well with it. I also really enjoyed the potato chips, which were crispy yet a little chewy.\\n\\nThe oyster slider was really crispy and had some really good sauce on it.\\n\\nWhat I enjoyed most were the raw oysters. I didn't put any garnishes on them and they were the best  oysters I have ever had. I have only eaten Pacific oysters before, but I really loved the taste of the Atlantic oysters.

My exposure to Indian food can be counted on one hand, so I knew enough to be dangerous but had no clue what to expect.\\n\\nAfter passing by several options, we landed at Amul because of the great rating it has on Yelp.  It's nestled in a seen-better-days shopping mall on Sawmill Road that's half vacant and so curb appeal is at a minimum, and the interior is nothing special.  But what it lacks in asceticism it more than makes up for in food and service.\\n\\nWe were immediately greeted at our table with wise-cracks from our waiter.  Huh?!  You read correctly.  Wise-cracks.  Digs.  Jokes.  Totally didn't see that coming.  This might put off some diners, but my family is both jocular and sarcastic so we were in stitches the entire evening.

Granted, I'm no expert on Indian food, but one can get the impression of quality ingredients and good preparation even if it's foreign.\\n\\nWe were famishing, so we started with the Vegetable Platter appetizer that came with like 5 or 6 different vegetable-based starters.  I'm not sure what some of them where (we could clearly identify fried cauliflower, samosas, and some fried cheese) but they were all wonderful, especially with [what I believe was] fresh cilantro chutney.\\n\\nWe ordered three entrees that we passed around the table.  The star of the course was definitely the Lamb Korma.  I'd had korma before at other restaurants and adored it's creamy sauce.  Again, this creamy, slightly spicy sauce with a definite note of cashews was absolutely spectacular, and the lamb was tender and flavorful.\\n\\nDish two was Chicken Dal, which was basically just chicken cooked in a sauce of lentils.  It didn't have as sophisticated a flavor as the korma but it was still very good and had a wonderful blend of seasonings.\\n\\nDish three was Chicken Sabaji, basically described as \\"chicken with vegetables\\".  It was good, but didn't knock our socks off as much as the first two.  \\n\\nWe ate all of this with their wonderful basmati rice which was cooked with some caraway seeds for a surprisingly deep flavor.  We also had some garlic naan which was fresh and so wonderful.\\n\\nFor dessert we passed around Ras Malai (homemade cheese in spiced cream), Kheer (rice pudding), and Kulfi (Indian style ice cream).  All three were simple in their cream + pistachio bases, but all very good.\\n\\nOh, and we all had what they called Special Tea which was a basic masala chai with cardamom and milk.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we left fat and happy.  Between the food and the awesome service, it was a fantastic experience.  Even though it's pretty far from where I live, we will definitely be doing back.

Instead, I was told I would have to stand by the door, staring at said empty tables, waiting for one of the \\"single\\" tables to open up, which they claimed would be 15 or more minutes. Clearly, this is a naked attempt to avoid smaller checks, and it's something I've encountered once in a while as a single person who loves good food. \\n\\nI don't care if you're alone or with 15 people - you should be afforded the respect of being seated as soon as space is available.

Let's take a look at why such a beautiful building loaded with everything a girl can imagine for herself and her doll, combined with a happy-go-lucky staff, deserves such a horrible rating. \\n\\nThe quality of the dolls themselves? Beautiful works of art unlike any other. The product? Creative, intuitive, and amazing: in addition to dolls, AG sells beds, furniture, and matching clothes as if to bring the toys alive. The books? Fun to read and educational. The extras? AG at the Natick Collection has an elegant cafe where a girl can eat with her doll, a doll hair salon where a doll's hair style can be changed at the will of the girl, and a humungous variety of hand-crafted goodies for girls and dolls alike. There's even a doll hospital if a doll should get damaged in any way. American Girl is literally the Disney World for girls, and the product, if not so expensive, is so wonderful that it should be owned by every girl in the world. The store is so enormous that every visit seems like an adventure.\\n\\nSo why? Why, may you ask, with the above evidence, would I loathe the store so much that I believe all girls and families alike should stay away from such a sugar-coated, upbeat, mystical place?\\n\\nBecause that's exactly what everything is, at least at this location. A dreamy, sugar-coated lie. I can't speak for the others because as a little girl I loved the store in New York, but the team here at Natick is awful. Prices are ridiculous. Wait times for the cafe and other services is outrageous. The store is constantly out of stock of certain dolls and accessories that corporate must be called only to tell the customer that the item they seek will take weeks to get to them, if it is even available at all. There are never any sales or discounts. Worst of all, behind the benevolent faces of those employees, the very ones who make girls laugh and guide them to their \\"inner star,\\" are a bunch of heartless, gossipy, sales-driven managers that constantly dump on their employees lower than them god forbid they make the littlest mistake. Among the younger team members the college students and seasonal people are really genuine, which is an exception, but otherwise this location is a wolf in sheep's clothing.\\n\\nI speak as a former employee at this store, as well as a customer many years ago, that American Girl in the Natick Collection is one of the worst American Girl retail locations in the Midwest. I only worked their for four months and I couldn't tell you how happy I was to leave. Upper management is terrible. They bark at you if you don't greet the customers, they snap constantly and make you look like an idiot in front of the customer if you \\"put the products in the bag the wrong way\\" or \\"fold the clothes inappropriately,\\" and, WORST of all, working the cash register is like reading another language. You are expected to be able to operate it IMMEDIATELY, while it takes a million steps for simple transactions and you are only trained for an hour. Literally.\\n\\nWant to know something even more ridiculous? One time a person next to me didn't give a customer their change because they didn't want it. Within seconds a bunch of managers were circling over them demanding to know why, that the security cameras caught them doing so. The poor employee had to sign a bunch of paperwork saying they violated the company policy and was never allowed to return as a seasonal worker, meanwhile the rest of the seasonal employees had been working their for years and allowed to return whenever they pleased. It was heartbreaking to watch and I felt so bad for them.\\n\\nTo make a long story short: this store is HORRIBLE. For customers and for people seeking employment here, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND AVOID IT LIKE A PLAGUE. You are better off elsewhere. \\n\\nThe product itself is wonderful. I owned Samantha as a little girl and am happy to keep supporting the company. But this particular location?

Instead, as we are waiting I saw another party walk in from the mall entrance and be sat immediately. I went over to the hostess just to check-in and ask if there was still a wait. She said there was still a 15 minute wait and then lied that those people were on the list. \\n\\nOnce we finally got a table, which didn't require a party leaving, since there were plenty of tables available, we got to try the food. We started with the pretzel bite appetizer. It was okay, though they do not give enough dipping sauce.

I liked the place overall a lot. We had the seafood platter which had a dozen signature Island Creek oysters, two lobster claws, four little clams, and four sweet shrimp for $95. The lobster was really hard to eat because they don't really crack it for you, so it was not a pretty sight if you need to care about image. The oysters I thought did not meet my expectation, it was really salty and it was too ocean-y(Don't know how else to describe it). I am open to trying some of their other oysters next time, since this is after all known for an oyster bar and they should have good variety. \\nOut of all, I love the shrimp cocktail the best! It was comparable to Mastro's shrimp cocktail, although I have to say they taste slightly different. While Mastro's shrimps are more fatty and very meaty, Island Creek's are more crisp and sweet. The size of the shrimp cocktails is also huge! I would def. order this next time. \\n\\nThe lobster roe noodles was nice but did not meet my expectation. I guess after being spoiled by the fresh lobster in the seafood platter, the lobster in my noodles simply just tastes more bland.

They have 10+ types of oysters to choose from, and the horse radish/champagne vinaigrette they serve with the oysters is also delicious.  They also have a tray of hot sauces to choose from, and I highly recommend the gypsy juice hot sauce!

Definitely a VERY small, \\"hole-in-the-wall\\" joint that I'm sure is a nightmare to seat during peak times. \\n\\nThe menu is terrifying. It's definitely not designed for your typical \\"americanized\\" foodie. Everything was some type of \\"salad\\", which is ridiculously confusing, and alas, no pictures. However, I feel like I made some good choices. I would never order chicken wings from a Thai restaurant, but I would have kicked myself in the face if I didn't try them at least once. I wouldn't order them again, but they weren't anything I immensely regretted. The beef salad was effing. amazing. The vinegar sauce was not too heavy, the beef was tender, and the cilantro, garlic, and spices were perfectly balanced. $2-$3 per bowl of rice was stupid, but you have to have rice with your main dishes. You just do. \\n\\nThe pandan leaf-infused water pitchers are left at each table so you can hydrate with style on your own schedule.

It's basically, AYCE sushi, including seafood, dessert, and hibachi. I've been here a couple of times over the past few years and so far it's been good. My recent visit was a couple weeks ago for early weekend dinner. Sushi wasn't as good as the first few times I've been. The price is about $30-$36 per person for dinner. Lunch is about $26, however don't quote me on the price. Just know it's definitely a pricier buffet. I actually like the other foods they offer such as the salads, crawfish/crab legs and definitely the dessert bar. I always get their green tea soft serve and if I have room, I'll go to their crepes. However, sub par crepes but it's cool to see them make it. They have a great selection of fruits, fruit tarts, tiramisu, jello/puddings, etc. available. If you get tired of sushi, they have a hibachi grill where they'll cook it in front of you. I was hoping steak, but one can dream. They have steak skewers and chicken and other regular hibachi sides like fried rice and egg drop soup. Only thing that I would recommend is having salt and pepper at each table. I love eating my seafood with lemon juice, salt and pepper to dip. Other than that, everything is good if you want above average buffet.

The thickness of the patty was anything but.  A drippy eat, most likely because of the house sauce and tomato.  \\n\\nThe fries were handcut and made fresh. A bonus.  Not as crispy as I would have liked, so overall, I would give them an average rating.  \\n\\nOne tip for those who go eat with another person:  Only one of you needs to order the burger platter.  The order of fries that comes with it is large enough for two people.\\n\\nI do love the ambience.  I wish more places had that classic burger joint look and feel.

To make a long story short, I'll just say it was one of the most racist experiences of my life, and we left within 15 minutes of being there...However, I think it's safe to say that going to this Red Robin was worse. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I came in last night, and were very excited as we both hadn't been to a Red Robin in a long time. Like many of the other reviewers have said, we were told there was about a 20 min wait even though there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes to be seated at one of said empty tables. And it took another 15 min before one of the bus boys, named Kevin, came over and asked had anyone helped us yet. It was at this point that we should have gotten up and left. So the continued awful service experience that followed is half our fault for staying at this terribly run restaurant. \\n\\nA waitress finally came over, and apologized for the delay. She told us that the waitress we were supposed to have was super overwhelmed and couldn't come to help us, so she came to take our table. Throughout this entire night, we heard other waitstaff apologizing to their tables for the delay and saying similar things. It sounded like something she made up, but she was very apologetic so we accepted it and moved on. We ordered our food right away, and also ordered two beers and water. It took about 5 min before she brought us our waters, and we asked about the beers. She said she was just waiting for the bartender to make our drinks and they'd be right up. another 5-10 min went by, and a different waitress brought us our food. We thanked her, and asked her about our beers, and she said she'd go check on them. Another 5 min went by, and we had to ask Kevin about our beers. He apologized and got our beers right away, even though two different servers couldn't.\\n\\nOur burgers tasted pretty good, which was one of the only saving graces of this entire thing. Though of course it wasn't completely ok, since mine had mayo on it even though the menu didn't specify that it would. I hate mayo, so I told our server, who damn near had a panic attack because she didn't know what to do, so she ran to tell the manager. The manager comes over and then proceeds to ask me why I didn't want mayo on it. Ummmm why does it matter?! I'm at a restaurant, and I don't want something on my burger. No questions need to be asked. Any other normal place would have just replaced it immediately. But whatever, I ate it with half of the bun because I didn't want to have to prolong this visit anymore than we needed to. The waitress comes over and we ask for the check, and I also order a milkshake to go at the same time. She comes back with the check and we pay, and then a min or so later comes back with the milkshake that's half empty. Not a joke or an exaggeration. It was literally half empty. So I ask her if they can add more to it, and she looks at it goes, oh ok I guess. As if there was nothing wrong with bringing me a half empty shake. She brings it back, and we waste no more time in getting out of that place.\\n\\nSo to sum up this novel of a review: 30 min to be seated in a mostly empty dining room. 15 min for a server to come over with a made up story. 20 min and 3 attempts to ask for two beers to be served.

For background, we have been to Pok Pok numerous times during lunch and off-peak times and have always had an above average experience.  We would order the \\"safe\\" items like the popular wings, papaya salad, the beef salad, the Khao Soi with chicken etc. \\n\\nWith past positive experiences under our belt, my husband and I decided to check out dinner. What an  underwhelming and unsatisfying evening, thanks to our waiter. We were ready to order the wings as an appetizer, and the Siikhrong Muu Yang (baby back ribs) and Hei Paa Naam Tok (spicy mushroom salad) for the main course. As we began rattling off our selections, the server literally turned his nose up and proceeded to coerce us into a 360 spin. Although he was pressing us to order the whole fish, we ended up -- or shall I say, he ended up -- ordering the Kaeng Hung Leh (pork belly and pork shoulder curry hot pot), the veg of the day, spicy squash, and  the eggplant salad. We are an open-minded, think-outside-the-box, some-what adventurous couple, but jeez, the hot pot dish was simply awful. I have had pork belly prepared various and delicious ways; however, this dish had few small morsels of pork belly and shoulder swimming in a vat of grease. There was absolutely NO hint of curry. The squash was totally saturated in, what I believe was, fish sauce -- extremely salty, and the eggplant salad was one dimensional.     \\n\\nEven our divine bourbon and cocktail selections could not save this horrendous meal. We walked out of the restaurant stunned and taken-advantage of. \\n\\nTo Andy Ricker: Please re-program and reform your wait staff to the classic customer service attitude of: \\"if the lady wants the red dress with white polka dots, give the lady what she wants.\\"  Also, your kitchen needs a refresher on quality control."},{"name":"Tso Chinese Delivery","address":"3909 N Interstate 35, Ste E-5","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered the following;\\nSzechuan Been - so greasy I ate one but a threw the rest.\\nCombination Fried Rice - absolutely tasteless and been was a sad Grey color.\\nGeneral Tao Chicken - quit good. \\n\\nAll in all, a VERY POOR experience and will never use them again."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Our first visit tonight and we were so impressed.

I picked 3 and wow, it was spicy! I wonder how hot 5 would have been. But nonetheless, the curry was delicious! My tongue quickly got used to the spice, it was hot but not overpowering. Vegetables were perfectly cooked and there was a good portion of chicken in the dish. The lunch special came with a spring roll which was nothing special but still delicious along with rice and salad. A good amount of food for $11!  My friend ordered beef pad Thai and I had a couple bites, it was equally as delicious as my curry.

For such a popular place, this was already a win in my book.\\n\\nAnother win was the fish sauce wings, ordered spicy. They were lathered in an almost Korean-style wet sauce with spices and red chili flakes. The meat was tender and juicy in their slightly crispy outer skin. Unfortunately, this was the only real high point for me.\\n\\nThe charcoal rotisserie roasted game hen was good but not enough to impress. The marinade added a lot of different flavors to the subtly smokey meat. However, the meat could have been juicier; and whenever there are extra dipping sauces on the side, I feel like it takes away from true taste of the meat. Good meat and seasoning should be able to stand by themselves.\\n\\nEverything else we tried was just OK. The grilled boar collar had a citrus-y garnish. The grilled baby back ribs were small and lacking in meat.

The cashier didn't know much about the sides, so that was a scary sign. I played it safe, got a 3 piece w/ two sides, which was cole slaw and potato wedges. I even got AN extra piece in my order making it 4 pieces - I like good and yummy surprises! I must've struck someone's fancy haha!!!\\n\\nFood was actually amazing and reminded me of my childhood. Everything tastes fresh and wasn't overly spiced or salty. I would give this place 4 stars if it wasn't for the soda fountain tasting flat in 2 of it's 5 options. On top of that the fountain area and table areas were pretty messy... Pretty gross when you decide to eat in...

Why does this place get such great reviews?! Flavorless food that has too much heat. Complete waste of money.  Service is fine enough. Space is small.  But the food...I can't understand why it gets raves. Less than mediocre. And way too much hype."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here with a group of friends this morning, based on the suggestion of another friend who was not in attendance (and whose future recommendations will be taken with a large grain of salt).  There was a bit of a line when we showed up, and we were told it was a 30-40 minute wait.  No problem, it was a nice day, we'll just hang out.  30 minutes pass.  Then 40, 45, and 60.  We ask for an update, and the response is \\"we can drop the checks, but we can't make people leave\\".  After some pressing, they say we're next on the list. Another 15 minutes pass, and we check for another update.  Now there's only 4 people ahead of us.  Wait...15 minutes ago we were next on the list....WTF? They explain that it's easier to seat small groups.  There were only 5 of us, but apparently at this place, that isn't a small group.  And also, based on that explanation, small groups get preference.\\nBeing the age of the smartphone, at this point some of us start searching for other options nearby, but there isn't a lot, especially if what you want is breakfast.  Apparently a group of angry people huddled around their I-phones got the attention of the staff, and soon we were called in....after a 90 minute wait.\\nThey place us in a corner table for 4.  Yes...there were 5 of us, and we got a table for 4. They put a chair and setting at the end opposite the wall, and I sat there, turned half sideways because of the solid table leg in front of me, with my back against the adjoining table.  Comfy.\\nThen there's my second complaint about the table.  In the interests of speeding up the process, we had abandoned the idea of grilling our own pancakes, and just told them to give us whatever was available first.  Our table did have a grill in it, but they put a wooden cover over it.  That would be fine, except that the grill took up most of the table anyway.  There was just barely enough room for a plate between the grill and the table edge, and there was not room for the typical setup, with your drink above the top of the plate.  It would have been possible to put things on the grill cover, except it had one leg that was shorter than the others, so every time someone put something on it or bumped it, the whole thing rocked.  And, since we had an extra person at the table, there really wasn't much room.\\nOK, so...crappy greeting and hosting, crappy table.  Strikes one and two.\\nOur server was pleasant, and our food was delivered 12 minutes after ordering (yes, we timed it, expecting the worst).  So at least the cooks are quick.\\nProblem was that the food was below average.  Four of us had dishes with eggs, 3 of them were not prepared as ordered.  The fourth had them scrambled, so no points for getting that right.  Biscuits & gravy was a very dry biscuit and thick gravy that really appeared to be right out of the package - except that it was visibly congealing on the plate by the time it was placed on the table.  The chicken fried steak kind of looked like a knarled cinder, required a knife to cut, and had the texture of leather.  The buttermilk pancakes were standard issue, out of the package flavor, which you can get anywhere - including at home.  The potatoes are probably Ore-Ida, and were overcooked and dry anyway.  The toast was crunchy, and served dry.  We used the butter that was provided for pancakes.  There was no jam or anything.  \\nNow onto the server again.  While she was pleasant, she didn't split our check, or offer to do so.  Everything came on one ticket.  Three of us paid with cards, and two (a couple) with cash.  Instead of re-running it, she just marked the receipt with which items belonged to who.  Then, for those paying in cash, she did not bring back change, apparently electing to tip herself generously (40%) instead.  \\n\\nBottom line - the wait is very long, and the time estimates are not reliable.  They apparently have preferential seating for smaller groups, so if you've got more than 2-3 people, you're going to watch people who got there after you get seated first. Kids may kind of like the idea of cooking their own food, but I can't imagine too many kids handling a 1-2 hour wait.  The service is mediocre at best.  And the important part - the food - isn't that good.\\nHonest assessment - go to Denny's.  You don't get to cook your own food, but you'll get the same quality food, and you'll get it faster.  This place is not worth the effort."},{"name":"Brothers Kouzina","address":"25 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"Great place appetizers where excellent don't miss out on the Greek Cheese and Moussaka I had the Lamb dish which as cooked to perfection.

With that said, though, we were missing two sushi rolls 20 minutes after the rest of our food arrived.  We finally were able to flag down the waiter, who tried to blame it on the kitchen.  We were seated right next to the sushi bar, and overhearing his conversation, he'd forgotten to put the order in.  Despite his charade, and his request for the sushi chefs to make them quickly, it still took another 15 minutes for them to deliver it.  In that time, he'd stopped by our table twice to say, \\"They're working on it\\", then, \\"The manager's making sure they get it out right away\\".

The tables indoors can be a bit tight but the sights and smells are well worth it.  The servers clearly have extensive knowledge about the various dishes and have great recommendations.  We weren't sure about a dish once and the server said that if we didn't like it he wouldn't charge us, he just wanted us to taste it.  Needless to say, we loved it.

I started with the black squid ink pasta, which was really good, but when we switched plates, I practically had an out-of-body experience because the traditional linguine dish was delectable!  Mind you, anytime I visit an Italian restaurant or a region in Italy I have to order the \\"linguine alle vongole\\" to compare it to one remarkable rendition of a classic linguine and clam dish I had at Chez Panisse back in 2002.  Over the years,  none have matched up, but this one came close and plausibly surpassed Alice Water's creation (and I adore her)!  It smelled and tasted of pure butter and garlic-- in a good way.  The pasta was cooked al dente and the clams were de-shelled so you didn't have to waste anytime scarfing down the dish.  And I scarfed it down!  As an added bonus, unlike most linguine alle vongole  dishes, the Daily Catch throws in fresh, grilled calamari. It really doesn't get better!  My husband was sweet enough to let me finish the dish he ordered and took over the black squid ink dish.  (Don't get me wrong, it was equally robust in flavor but the linguine strands were a little thick and chewy so I didn't love the texture).

It's always the same couple that greets us.  They're super friendly and accommodating (we bring our noisy bratty kids and they STILL treat us well).  In our experience the food is very authentic.  We recommend the dolsot bibembap - for those not familiar with Korean food, this is a sizzling bowl of hot rice mixed with assorted vegetables and meat and an optional spicy red bean sauce.  It's topped with a fried egg.  Wait a couple minutes before stirring it up so that the rice on the bottom becomes toasted and golden brown.  Yum!  Everything is served with an assortment of Korean side-dishes - pickles, tiny fish, tofu, bean sprouts, and eggs - that are a wonderful accompaniment to the meal.\\n\\nOther dishes to try - the seafood pancakes (also called omelettes) are oddly priced ($11 for something considered an appetizer?), but are delicious - oh my gosh dream-worthy delicious.  That's what we usually order for the kids.  The mandoo (the Korean take on a Chinese pan-fried dumpling) are perfect.  Don't be afraid of the big pricey entrees - they will easily feed two large hungry people like my husband and me, or three more reasonable appetites.  We got the bulgogi style soup today (the 'small' portion for about $23) and it was phenomenal - exactly like the one we used to love at a restaurant around the corner from the apartment we shared in Seoul.\\n\\nA word about the fried chicken:  Korean fried chicken tends to be butchered really differently from American chicken, which may be why some previous reviewers were not fans.  It kind of turns into a bunch of unidentifiable lumps of chicken.  We really like it a lot, though it's not the best version of Korean fried chicken that we've tried.  \\n\\nThis is by far the best Korean food we've had since we moved to Austin.

We shared a bunch of plates for dinner, and it was more than enough food, let me tell you! There was a huge menu packed with fabulous dishes, starting with appetizers and ending with desserts. Many of the items have the option to have tapas OR an individual meal, so if you want something all to yourself, you can get the big portion. Otherwise, the tapas portions are really enough for several people to have something and not feel at all deprived. \\n\\nA few dishes we enjoyed: \\n\\nCeviche de la Casa- Unfortunately, our family friend had most of this since it was her idea to get it. She got to the shrimp and stuff I liked before I had the chance. I tried a piece of the raw fish...I'm not a raw fish girl unless it's in sushi. So although I'm sure it was good, I would have preferred trying it sooner. Our friend ordered some hot sauce to go with it in case you like more of a kick. \\n\\nAtun Estilo Tartaro- This is raw, sushi-grade tuna with capers and sesame oil. Delicious! It comes in sort of a clump, and you have to sort out the pieces for yourself, but it's delicious. It comes with some toasted bread slices and also cucumber slices so you can put your tuna on either one, if you wish. \\n\\nQueso de Cabra- A baked goat cheese served with baked tomato pieces. Delicious! If you like goat cheese and herbs, this is lovely. \\n\\nPargo a la Andaluza- Red snapper grilled and served with tender-crisp peppers, onions, and capers. Very good, but I am not a snapper fan, so I had very little of this. \\n\\nPollo al Jerez- I LOVED this! Small pieces of chicken topped with pesto and served with a sherry cream sauce. This was my favorite, along with the goat cheese. There were three small chicken pieces, which was plenty for our group. \\n\\nMy dining companions shared some of the croquetas, but I abstained because I'm not much for ham. However, they looked crispy and came with a dipping sauce and three large croquetas. \\n\\nThe atmosphere here is lovely. It's very peaceful and just has a great Spanish theme to it.

We got there on a Friday around 1:35 PM.  We were told the wait for five people was 20-25 minutes.  About 40 minutes later, after people who came after us were seated, we asked how much longer it might be.  We had 3 very hungry and hot kids.  It seemed we had been forgotten.  The maitre d' quickly said, \\"I'll just add one more chair.\\"  No apologies.  We were seated inside where there were multiple empty tables.  So I have to conclude that this is not an efficient operation.  Wait staff, although very nice, seemed harried and doubled as bartenders, taking orders and mixing drinks.  There is also a section of the restaurant that is accessed through a completely separate, outside entrance--- stairs leading up to a second floor. This may seem charming, but again was understaffed and inefficient.  There is no reason for this kind of budget crunch in a restaurant of this reputation.\\n\\nIs there?  I mean, was the food worth it?  \\n\\nThe food was \\"Asian fusion\\" with a Thai base.  Thai food is not rocket science.  Many, many restaurants are very good at it.  The legendary chicken wings were good but not transcendent.  They were good wings with a fish sauce base, with a caramelized coating that had a hard crunch.  The papaya salad (\\"spicy,\\" though pretty mild by Thai standards) was good but again, routine.  The Thai beef salad had a different and pleasant sprinkle of corn meal for crunch and texture.  The clear noodle salad was a little overdressed and soupy.  And the pork spare ribs were similar to Chinese cha shao style ribs with tender meat and a smokey, sweet flavor.  Again--- good, but nothing special.  Thousands of Chinese barbecue places do this better.  \\n\\nThere were many beautiful young people, trendy patrons.  Tellingly, there were few Asians.  Perhaps it's a great place to be seen or to say you enjoyed, but it isn't a place for people who are looking for special Asian food.  The caliber is not there.  It isn't good enough.  Something is lacking.  And having to pay extra for rice, given the small portions, is something of a joke.

If you opt for entree size, the server will bring the pan to your table so you can eat out of it. I ordered the Putanesca: pureed olive-anchovy butter sauteed with mushrooms, onions, and peppers. The squid ink pasta was perfect, soft, and chewy. It was also very unique. I added scallops for $6 and was glad I did. They were cooked perfectly. The scallops were totally soft instead of rubbery if they were cooked poorly. The other two options for Black Pasta are Afredo and Aglio Olio (ground squid). The Aglio Olio is the most popular of the three. In addition, I returned a couple of days later for lunch and ordered the swordfish. It was one of the most incredible fishes I have ever eaten. It was tender and smooth. If there were bones, I would give the analogy that the flakes of meat fell off the bone. The sundried tomato basil sauce was also great. The fish entrees also come with a side of pasta: linguine. It was a generous portion and awesome. The pasta also had a lot of garlic. If Black Pasta is not your thing, I highly recommend the fish.\\n\\nLike the other top Italian spots in the North End, it is a small space and popular. As a result, the restaurant fills up quick.

The waiter also didnt know how many people one order of the pancake mix would feed, how am I supposed to know what 6.5oz makes? this should be listed on the menu (which needs proof reading, some toppings were listed twice). I did like how they text you when your table is ready. The final thing that lost this place a star was that they charged $.50 for salsa for a burrito, (it should come with salsa) and that you had to ask for ketchup. For a place with (mediocre) breakfast potatos, ketchup should be on the table.

Food, service, and ambiance have been excellent each time: thus the 5 stars. Although their menu changes frequently, it looks like their fried chicken and salt & pepper biscuit is a steady menu item that you can count on again and again. I really love Busy Bee for a good southern fried chicken, but AF&B is pretty freakin' amazing, too. But the real reason I love their fried chicken dish so much? The collard greens that come with it. Holy crap, best collard greens ever! (Pork included.)\\n\\nAnother favorite of mine is their starter dish, the heirloom tomato toast. Their version with their homemade ricotta is simply heavenly. My only wish was that it came with more tomato chunks because I'm not original and have jumped on the heirloom bandwagon.\\n\\nOther mains that I've tried with much satisfaction include the salmon burger and their regular burger. \\n\\nTheir desserts paired with Batdorf and Bronson coffee is so worth the extra calories.

Nothing about it would suggest it is on government grounds. With stylishly naval decor and plenty of Boston-themed menu options, this fast-ish food restaurant with somewhat less fast-ish service would be quite a bit more popular were it more easily accessible - but that is part of the allure.\\n\\nI tried the Decca Burger and the Lobster Poutine. Speaking of the latter, how could any seafood lover resist the temptation? Sure there may be other places to get poutine in the hub, with downtown's Saus coming first to mind, but having lobster on this Canadian classic is unheard of. Overall, the flavors went well together, but the lobster neither looked nor tasted as fresh as I would have hoped. For the burger, the size was on the less-manly side, and the taste was good, but not nearly amazing.\\n\\nAll in all, Decca is a very good casual restaurant with options for everyone, including vegetarians. Were it standalone in say, Back Bay, a cross-town trip could be recommended but not required. However, being where it is, one should make it a visit to the Navy Yard itself with the bonus of good food rather than a trip solely for the restaurant.\\n\\n(^_^) Decor\\n(^_-) Service\\n(^_^) Options\\n(^_-) Taste\\n(^_^) Bang for buck\\n\\n[3.5 rounded up]\\n\\nGlad I came.

We ordered a pretty decent variety of dishes, including the ceviche in avocado, which was nice, but the flavor could have had more of a kick to it. The salad we got was pretty amazing--it tasted like and resembled a cobb salad, but I think the bacon really gave it a deep, savory flavor that was hard to resist. The Puerto Rican pot roast was mediocre (flavors were a bit muddled), and the yucca shrimp in bacon was unfortunately not particularly crispy. I really wanted to like the lamb sliders, but the meat was pretty heavily burned. We finished with the tres leche cake with meringue, which was a great dessert (but also not easy to mess up).

He did so but did not apologize for the food poisoning or comp the meal, so we simply paid and left, as my boyfriend was in urgent need of medicine. I began feeling ill later that night.\\n\\nNeither of us had eaten much that day and neither of us have allergies. We had eaten raw seafood before without a problem. What's ironic was that I had read a review from December 8, three days prior to our visit - in it, the reviewer describes her and her boyfriend getting sick from ICOB and hospitalized. They had also ordered soups and raw oysters, as we did.\\n\\nThat night, I contacted ICOB and received a response from management about refunding our meal and sending a gift card for a future visit.

When I followed up this week, I did not receive a response either.

Don't get me wrong, both were great, and I preferred the succulence of the crab claw, but for $18 you got more lobster meat than the $25 jumbo crab claw.  \\n\\nThe oysters were very good.  I'm used to larger oysters done this way at a couple of spots in New Orleans like Drago's and Mr. Ed's.  Also, we did have to ask for bread, which is kind of a must to soak the garlic butter out of the shell with.   \\n\\nOverall, we had a very nice time.  I definitely plan to go back and try a full meal."},{"name":"Raso's Grille","address":"209 Mystic Ave","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"Raso's is a traditional Italian restaurant that offers more. In addition to classic Italian dishes it has a nice selection of meats and seafood at very reasonable prices. \\nI'd been wanting to try this place since moving to the area a couple of years ago but was always put off a bit by it's location- kind of a mixed industrial/business area on busy Mystic St. in Medford. \\n\\nOn this Saturday night the only real challenge was finding parking. The front and side of Raso's can fit a small number of cars. After that you're stuck looking on the side streets where most of the parking is for residents only. It shouldn't be such a pain. Perhaps Raso's can strike a deal with some of the local businesses to open their lots in the evenings when they are otherwise closed. Every local business lot has bold signs- parking for customers only. Enough parking rants.\\n\\nThe place was packed. We enjoyed a drink at the bar. The local patrons were friendly and made room for us. No draft beer- a significant shortcoming these days. A good selection of bottled beers- See them up on that shelf? No- they were too far away to clearly see the labels.  A beer list would be helpful. The wine menu was reasonably priced but not very appealing. Unlike the large food menu, I would have preferred a broader selection including some heartier red wines. I settled for a passable Shiraz. The Cosmo was perfect.    \\n\\nSeated in 15 minutes we were greeted by a young man who couldn't have been any better of a waiter- friendly, always checking in on us, offering informed suggestions and highly professional and responsive. A+ \\n\\nNow to the food. We started with Crispy Calamari in a hot peppers and garlic aioli. Not crispy but some of the most tender calamari I've ever eaten. The peppers added zip. Light if any garlic though. We shared the Shrimp Scampi- large perfectly cooked shrimp on angel hair pasta in a very light  and fresh scampi sauce- but where's the garlic? Still delicious. Portions was reasonable.  The side salad and bread were OK. The salad was not served chilled. \\n\\nThe restaurant is cozy, friendly, busy and with enough space between the tables and booths so you don't feel cramped. The service was impeccable and friendly. The food selection was outstanding. It was fresh, well prepared and reasonably priced. Good local spot. I hope Raso's will update the beer and wine selections and work out some parking options on the weekend. 3.5 Stars"},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place for lunch and happy hour.

It is a simple minimalist approach to serving coffee, on the upscale, and also a good place to buy coffee beans to take home. \\n\\nThe offerings are simple: a few drip systems and an espresso machine to make your espresso drinks (latte, cappuccino, etc). You come up to the counter, select 1) drip coffee, pick the beans that you want, they will grind them and brew them in any specific system you want. It is a no-brainer. Or select 2) your espresso drink. Just make sure you read the notes on the coffee, and this will improve your coffee experience in regards to tasting.\\n\\nI had read plenty about Lineage before I had a chance to stop by. Coffee is one of my latest obsessions, and whenever I travel I try to hit one or two roasters/coffee shops. I always prefer to stop by a place that roasts coffee, simply because all the other \\"cool\\" coffee houses will be brewing the roaster's coffee. In other words, all the other \\"cool\\" coffee houses in Orlando and the vicinity will be brewing Lineage coffee. So, I just go to the source and skip the middleman. Also, and this may be just a personal problem of mine, I feel that roasters always brew their own coffee better than the other places. Just me.\\n\\nMy first cup of Joe at Lineage was a coffee from Kenya, recommended by the staff, and I kid you not, this tasted like wine. I tasted it without sugar and that was it. It had a strong taste of plums and figs, it was just wine minus the alcohol. Wine for breakfast, hell, why not! After this experience, I always try to make a stop and pick up some awesome coffee from these kids. I go \\"whole beans\\" for dripping, versus the espresso roasts, just because notes are much more predominant and easy to pinpoint. It is just more enjoyable.\\n\\nLineage is located in the back of the East End market. It is just a counter, and there are tables outside if you want to sit and enjoy your coffee under the Florida sun. This area is very hip, by the way, so don't be alarmed if you get a lot of snarky or obnoxious remarks. Just laugh it off and get your one-two ready. \\n\\nHey, is it time for you to buy a grinder and a better coffee dripper? Just saying...\\n\\nLineage also offers cold brew coffee bottles, some t-shirts, and free hugs.

A little pricey but food is good; portions are just right and it's in a very convenient location.  Great stop for lunch.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI first tried Pepper Lunch in HK back in 2011 and I was so excited to hear that they opened up a legit location in Vancouver! I visited Vancouver back in May 2015 and one of my first stops was in Richmond for lunch... to Pepper Lunch.  Parking is limited on No. 3 Rd... so you're either going to park on the street, at the mall/plaza and walk... or there's some underground parking behind the actual plaza.  It's free (for up to 2 hours I think?) so make sure to take advantage of that.  \\n\\nWhen you walk in, there's plenty of booth seating and the whole location probably seats more than 40-ish people.  You first order from a menu on the wall and they assign you a seat with a number.  I came with my boyfriend and there was no line at all.  Probably only 20 or so people inside during lunch on a Thursday so I'm surprised it wasn't busier.  If I worked in the area, it's definitely a prime spot for me to grab a quick bite.  We got our order very quickly after sitting... probably less than a 10 mins wait (but hey! The food cooks in front of you so not much to wait for).\\n\\nOur order:\\nWhat they're known for, the Beef Pepper Rice  Combo - My boyfriend got the combo since it came with soup and refillable Coke.  The beef cooked really fast and there's plenty of rice and corn.  It's not small and he was full afterwards but it was his first time there and he wasn't ecstatic to come back.    \\nJapanese Hamburger - With corn/veges and no egg.  But it does come with rice in a bowl on the side (not pictured).  I found that the beef cooked faster than I would've liked so perhaps I didn't turn it over quick enough.  The butter on top melted almost instantaneously after I took this photo.  Very good burger nonetheless though.  Very crumbly which is fine but flavorful and very peppery.  \\n\\nOverall we paid about $25 (before tax and tip) and I think that's a little expensive for what it is.  You can go to Aberdeen and there's a restaurant in the food court that serves something similar for a fraction of the price.  However, Pepper Lunch does offer service and it was average (not spectacular).   You have to call over the wait staff to get more Coke or water which I thought was a nuisance but the guy at the front was very patient with us as we humm-ed and haa-ed over the menu for 5 minutes.  Other than that, I thought the food was very close to what I remember in HK (both in portions, taste and interactive-ness).  You can't really miss it up and the experience of cooking your own food is always fun.

I didn't even finish mine. Friends had the mushroom crepe and the salmon with capers crepe, and both looked delicious as well. We split the sweet Normandie crepe, though we veganized it by getting the creme fraiche ice cream on the side, and opting for the vegan lemon \\"butter\\". (The other toppings were cider poached pears and cider caramel sauce.) Holy hell. I'm almost pissed we split it, because even though I was full from the savory crepe, I could have easily put that entire thing away. The creme fraiche ice cream was a delicious surprise, though I was suspicious at first. The ice cream flavors all sound super tempting.\\n\\nGreat atmosphere with nice lighting and warm colors.

Very good consistency too.\\n\\nChicken-fried Steak - My friend ordered this, and it was GIGANTIC. I think he even declared it one of the best he's had (as a chicken-fried steak connoisseur).

Though I've never actually had the pho, their b√∫n thit nuong cha goi is by far the best I've ever had, bar none.

The vermicelli is always perfectly al dente, and I don't know what brand they're using or if they make their own, but I've never had better hoisin than here. I've had the b√∫n thit nuong cha goi with grilled chicken, grilled beef and grilled pork, and while all are completely delicious, juicy and grilled to perfection, the grilled pork is by far my favorite. Even without egg rolls, I believe this dish would be perfect, but the addition of the egg rolls pushes it over the top from perfect to divine. \\n\\nWhile the spring rolls at Pho Hoang are fresh, crunchy and just plain beautiful to look at, the egg rolls are the real stand-out here. They are perfectly fried and never greasy, light while still hearty and have a better flavor than any egg roll I've ever come across, and believe me, I've come across more than my fair share. Pho Hoang is the winner of any egg roll race in my book.\\n\\nThe food more than makes up for the lack of ambience in the restaurant. It's not plain but I don't think anybody would go there for the ambience alone. The seating is mostly family style, which I really don't mind.

Now that I finally know the name of this tiny noodle house, I can write a review!  I was introduced to Pho Hoang back in college, by my Vietnamese friends who referred to this place as \\"the ONLY place you should get Pho from,\\" here in Austin.  Now, being from Houston, where there's a plethora of delicious Pho easily accessible to a moment's craving, I was disappointed at the lack-luster Asian fare here in Austin.\\n\\nThen along came Pho Hoang to save the day!  Well, my pregnancy, to be exact.  During the first six months of being pregnant, I seriously jonesed for a piping hot, spicy and sour, brothy-bowl of Pho (that and some Thai from Madam Ma'ams)!  Though we live a good 20 minute drive away, I made my husband trek over to Pho Hoang almost every week, just to satisfy my cravings!\\n\\nThe Pho broth itself is worth the drive.  Not too salty, and delicious with the additional lime juice.  I like the Pho with brisket, flank, and tripe, and I love watching the rare meat cook in the broth!  The meat is always tender, and the tripe is always just the right texture-- not too rubbery, and not crumbly (bleh!).  The basil, cilantro, and bean sprouts served alongside the Pho is usually super-fresh and crisp (mmMMm, I can smell the basil now!), although there've been the occasional brown sprout here and there. \\n\\nI also love their Charcoal-Broiled Pork & Eggroll Vermicelli dish!  The pork is cooked juicy inside and just slightly crisp on the outside, and it's perfectly seasoned. There's also actually a decent amount of fresh lettuce and shredded carrots to balance out the dish, so that you actually feel as if you're getting a complete meal instead of just an after-thought of veggies.  The eggroll?  Crunchy and flavorful to perfection!  Top it all off with the fish sauce with a dab (or scoop!) or Siracha, and oh my world please get in my belly!\\n\\nI will say the spring rolls aren't as impressive.  The shrimp, wrapping and sauce are just not as flavorful as the ones at Madam Ma'ams.  Can't win 'em all, I suppose.\\n\\nBut all the above for a mere $15??  How wonderful!  Although you can definitely see that the inexpensive meal comes at the cost of the decor.  Doesn't bother me though, as I've eaten at plenty of bare-boned, hole-in-the-wall Asian places, and as long as the food's good, I don't care how cushy the seats are.\\n\\nI don't know why it took me so long to think about learning the name to Pho Hoang (who needs to know the name, when I can just know it as \\"the Pho place off 183 & Burnet?\\"), but now that I do, I can say, \\"Everyone: Pho Hoang is the ONLY place you should get Pho in Austin!\\""},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"The selection was awesome.

They offer a nice array of items on the menu that you wouldn't commonly see. I really love the larb papaya salad, it's so crisp and refreshing with warm lamb sprinkled throughout. Any dressing with fish sauce is a delicate balance that is hard to achieve so I commend them on that. I also enjoy the lamb stuffed grape leaves, with the rich fattiness in the lamb, perfect balance of sour and sweet in the sauce, and the fried goodness of the grape leaves it's an adventurous substitute for your typical egg roll.

It looked like we only had 2 cocktail waitresses, which didn't seem to be enough to me, but no one was complaining. Then again, many in our group ordered at the bar... maybe that was why no one complained about waitress service... or maybe BECAUSE?    I had no problems.\\n\\nOur party included a buffet. The \\"bowl 'o'salad\\" was lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onions with a side bowl of Italian dressing - nothing fancy, but certainly satisfactory. Nothing special about the meatballs. The chicken \\"fingers\\" were breaded chicken cutlets sliced into thirds. I thought the breadding was a bit heavy, but the chicken itself was juicy. \\n\\nTwo entrees were worthy of note, for different reasons. While delicious, I noticed that the primary ingredient in the sausage & peppers was actually ONIONS. The amount of sausage was also inadequate, and the sausage was sliced quite thin. The best selection was the bacon-wrapped bay scallops. If this is an option on their regular menu, I'm ordering it!!!  \\n\\nI had only 2 minor complaints about the function, neither of which is too significant. First, whoever does the marketing for special parties needs to communicate better with the staff. We were told we would be able to go in a side door for convenience. The staff maintained (and won the battle) that they could not do that because it would skew their \\"clicker count,\\" which was probably to keep the crowd at some limit. Second, the buffet wasn't really set up right. The Italian bread for the meatballs and sausage was at the opposite end of the table, causing everybody to get in front of each other when trying to go through the line."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We had the wings are a must, it's what put them on the map.

The food was ok but I noted that the corn tortillas wrapped around the enchiladas seemed like straight-out-of-the-bag tortillas, that had not been cooked or even heated really.  When I prepare enchiladas at home I usually flash dip them in some kind of heated oil, and I heat the enchiladas in the oven.  Most restaurants do that too.  This is why I've taken off two stars.  Everything else was ok here.  Our server was marvelous.  The atmosphere was perfect.  \\n\\nMy friend, and the other guests seemed to enjoy their meals.  I did not hear any complaints.  \\n\\nI don't know, perhaps I'm being too hard on this place...\\n\\nThe guest of honor ordered something that came with several meats, including a whole roasted quail.  Seeing the quail every now and then when she would lift it up to see if anybody wanted to try it was quite unusual for me.  It seemed like the poor bird sacrificed it's life in vain.  Maybe someone did end up trying some quail.\\n\\nThey're trying to make this a creative and interesting restaurant.  Hasn't quite come together yet.

We liked some better than others, but that's a matter of taste. They were all fresh and delicious. Loved the accoutrements they bring to accompany the oysters - all manner of sauces and such.\\n\\nMain courses: Monkfish and Lobster Roe Noodles. We loved both dishes, but they were disappointedly served lukewarm. Flavors were spot on, but food this good (and pricey) needs to get on the table, stat!\\n\\nDessert: Housemade lime sorbet - excellent flavor and abundant portion! If you are charging $8. for sorbet, I appreciate getting three large scoops of it.\\n\\nRandom: My husband loved the bread and salted butter, but was not happy when it was whisked away by an overzealous busboy mid-meal. Seriously, why? Drink (wine, beer, cider) selection is good, but the mixed drinks were just okay. Overtaxed bartender?

Gravy!  ***omg the gravy!!!!***\\nBiscuits and gravy are so good, it's worth going just to try them out.  I love biscuits, these were a little denser, so they stood up well to the gravy--it melts in your mouth not on the plate.  The gravy had a hint of sweetness but it wasn't too sweet because the biscuits were more savory, made partly with masa flour I'm guessing.  A nice balance of flavors.  The gravy has huge bits of meat/sausage but the meat melts in your mouth.  Now for full disclosure I try to be GF/paleo so I had a bite of my bf plate to start out.  I raved about it to the cook, he was a total cool guy and gave me my own portion for free.  (Slow Monday no one in there but us around 2ish).   If I could eat it all the time, I would need a special pass/lights/wide load sign to be rolled through the streets of se to get there. I would pay epic prices if they made a GF version.  It's almost as good as dessert, I actually thought \\"what would the gravy be like over ice cream?\\"  Mmmm gravy!!!\\nSo if your in the mood for some killer biscuits and gravy, I recommend arleta.\\nI always go for the coffee, stumptown...

While the menu has obviously had some additions to keep with the times, you can still get a classic pastrami or corned beef sandwich here.  I went with the combo which is both, topped with coleslaw, Swiss, and Russian dressing.  Nothing particularly innovative about this sandwich, but what they do, they do well.  I'm sure there are better versions of this classic out there, but I can't think of any right now.  It's a very good sandwich.  The only real issue is the price, while the portions are pretty big, just a sandwich is a bit over $13 which is pushing it.

Disappointment number one. \\n\\nNext up were the wings, which were flavorful and well spiced, but nothing that I couldn't find at one of my local Korean joints in SF. Yes, I know, different flavor profile between Thai and Korean, but very reminiscent of one another. \\n\\nThe next two dishes, which involved fatty pieces of porky goodness and a noodle coconut curry-based soup, were good, but again, nothing that knocked my socks off. \\n\\nThe wow moment of the evening for me was the drink menu.The cocktail list is what seemed unique and inventive to me. Drinks that combined ingredients like tamarind, rhubarb and bergamot is what got me excited. I love Asian preserved fruit and the salted plum collins was amazing. It tasted like a fizzy salted plum. Refreshing and tasty.  \\n\\nI ended my evening with a rhubarb drinking vinegar from the extensive drinking vinegar list. I've never seen drinking vinegars outside of Asia, so this was a wow, this is unique moment. The vinegar was served with seltzer and tasted just like the stuff I lived on in Taiwan.

My sister had recommended it to me on numerous occasions. The words that come to mind when describing the ambiance are \\"cozy\\" \\"French cottage\\" \\"exotic\\" and \\"lively\\". The art on the walls is mismatched and colorful, the table cloth on the tables are checkered and crisp, the silverware speaks of the history of the place, the walls are not whitewashed but sparkling clean, the space is not too big and the owner is the one serving and seating every customer. In other words, the beauty of the place is in its uniqueness and the quality of the food. If you want to impress your clients with how well you know your wine, you should not even consider Baraka but if you want to impress your friend or date with your knowledge of the gastro world, this is the place. And before we leave this topic, if you are in a hurry, this is not the place either... the frozen food at the Olive Garden might be a better choice instead. \\nSo my friend and I ordered three appetizers, an eggplant dish, merguez, and cheese in olive oil. We got our freshly baked wild oregano bread with it (Alia replenished it as soon as we were done with our first so we appreciated the new hot and fresh batch all over again). For our entree we ordered the lamb chops and the couscous. Both were amazing, my friend and I shared them so we got to taste both. The lamb chops were served with succulent greens that added both taste and texture to the medium rare cooked lamb. It was simply amazing and the only place that I know of that serves couscous this way! Just from that dish you can tell that the culinary influences on the chef are both European and North African. \\nTheir lemonade is worthy of an Ode! I could wax poetic about it but since so many already did, I will just say, you will be doing your self a disservice if you forget to order it. \\nAmazing deserts, their creme brulee is better than many I have had at French restaurants! In fact, I will go as far as saying that theirs is the best in Boston. If you had the the creme brulee at Balthazar in NYC you will know what I am talking about. \\nThe chocolate cake is perfect, my friend had it and both thought that the flavor was rich, it was not overly sweet... unlike a lot of chocolate cakes that look brown and don't actually taste like chocolate this one does... and it has bits of chocolate in it that go so well with the ice cream! \\nOf course, you can not go to a North African restaurant and not order their mint tea! Baraka's is the perfect combination of mint and tea leaves and they bring a fresh pot for the table if you ask for one. My friend and I went through two pots! Remember to ask them to hold off on the sugar if you don't want it with your tea (I am one of those few who drink their tea sans sucre... I do make up for it with the deserts though). \\nLast but not least, I see that the owner has generated a number of reactions from other reviewers. In any other restaurant, the owners are usually behind the scene or just so \\"blah\\" that they are not worth talking about. Not Alia. You can tell that she is there not as your typical owner but more like a mother serving her children, making recommendations, inquiring about their health, and if you have the time she will offer you advice on any topic you have in mind. We all have our prejudices and I must admit that because of the way she dresses one assumes that her life has been limited in some ways... Let me tell you, that's so wrong. She is worthy of an anthropological study.

This place is decent compared to the more top fine-dining places in Portland.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I dined here tonight and we had their most popular entrees, the crab ravioli and the seafood pappardelle. We also had the tartara (tuna) appetizer, and the caprese (cheese and tomatoes) appetizer.\\nThe portion size for the appetizer was rather large, for appetizers. It is larger than usual appetizers you would receive elsewhere. One order of the caprese came with 5 cheese/tomatoes. The tartara was also large. We were getting full just from two appetizers.\\nOnto the taste of the appetizers, the caprese was lacking a lot of taste especially in the cheese. And the tomatoes weren't exactly ripe therefore doesn't have much taste as well. This sums up to a rather tasteless appetizer. I only had one and left the plate alone.\\nThe tuna on the other hand was better, but also nothing fancy about it. Just tuna with some veggies. The veggies did not compliment the tuna like \\"wow\\", but just alright. They could replace the veggies they  use with something and it would be about the same. Nothing fascinating.\\n\\nWhen my pappardelle came, it smelled good. However my pasta was still hard... and so were the calamari. The whole pasta had one single taste, and it seems like the seafood in the pasta were steamed thus, does not have special taste.\\nThe ravioli my boyfriend had was also still a bit hard, and didn't have much filling in it. Usually raviolis have a lot of fillings and that's where most of its taste come from, however this was not the case... the taste in this dish was mostly from the sauce on top and the flour of the ravioli pasta.\\n\\nBottom line: the prices were cheap compared to most Italian restaurants we go to.

My girlfriend got a curry type dish that was decent tasting, but nothing you couldn't get for half the price somewhere else.

I expected noodles in curry with a decent amount of spare ribs. It was an actual soup, however, not really spicy at all, and only had 2 spare ribs.

I want to watch the game with the sound on.   (this is apparently alot to ask of many bars) 2. I would like to have a decent selection of beer, not heavily titled toward cheap swill or artisanal micro brews (also alot to ask of many bars around here) 3. I don't want to be surrounded by douchebags, small babies and their annoying god damn parents who insist on rolling them in to bars in $500 strollers or frowny patrons who smack talk the Blazers and/or show their recent PDX immigration status by having no knowledge of the team.\\n\\nEstablishments get bonus points for allowing my teenager to watch with me, having good staff that is friendly and compentent, and a menu that isn't 90% fried or chicken wing based. \\n\\nAs such I felt excited to stumble upon Old Town Pizza on MLK Blvd. and it became my go to location this spring as the Blazer's made another late season push to the playoffs and then embarassed themselves in the first round.\\n\\nThey meet all of the above criteria, though inconsistently.  Shall I explain?\\nThere is a great bartender, with a great accent, (I'm thinking Scottish or Welsh, maybe) and he is friendly and compentent and helpful and awesome.  If he is not working you may get stuck with \\"Bluto the manager\\", or \\"What. Do. You. Want.\\" the other bartender, or \\"Ijuststartedandimnotsurehowtodoanything\\"or \\"dude, which table does this pizza go to again?\\" .  These people suck, in the sense that any fun or enjoyment that could be derived from watching the game is sucked from having to interface with them. They don't have to do table service,rather you must approach them to order pizza, salads, beer, etc. AND you have to shag your own soda from the machine. You'd think they could at least bus the table for you or bring you napkins with your food. Or be pleasant. Grrr.\\n\\nOkay, next point. There have been times when I watched the game here in relative peace and with likeminded folks.  There have also been times when I've witnessed toddlers raining down toys from the second floor onto unsuspecting bar patrons below as their parents patently refused to pay attention. Not f-ing cool.\\n\\nIn favor of OTP, good beer selection, including the requisite PBR as well as Ninkasi Total Domination.  Not a chicken wing in sight and my daughter can sit with me in a smallish area and watch the game.  \\n\\nIn summary, this place will likely continue to be a Blazer watching option next season.  I will hope the good bartender is working all Blazer games and I'll stay on the look out for a place that meets my ciriteria all the time.

While this restaurant does not serve the classic Pad Thai and other favorites such as a green curry chicken we were pleasantly surprised at the intense flavors inside each dish we tried. \\n\\nI have two words for you. Chicken Wings. My wife is not a fan of chicken wings at all. She is very much a texture eater. but; after one bite of these chicken wings she was having multiple food-gasms. We couldn't get enough of these damn things. Each bite delivers a layered flavor experience including sweet with the spicy and the gooey delicioiusness. For someone who usually leaves a lot attached to the bone, she nearly ate the bones.\\n\\nChicken wings were on the pricey side, but well worth it ($14/plate)\\n\\nWe also tried the Kaeng Hang Leh which is a sweet pork belly with pork shoulder. The portions were a little small in my opinion but the flavors were explosive. By the end of the meal you nearly want to drink the juice out of the pot. I recommend putting it on rice instead.\\n\\nThe other entree we tried was actually not that great. We found it to be pretty bland. Kung Op Wun Sen is a dish with prawns baked in a clay pot served with pork belly and bean thread noodles. It wasn't too terribly impressive but not everything on a menu will blow you away.

Overall, I was a bit disappointed in the food here, minus the fish sauce chicken wings and sticky rice.\\n\\nLike everyone says, the fish sauce chicken wings are a MUST.  These chicken drumstick and wing pieces are marinated in fish sauce, deep fried, then coated in more caramelized fish sauce.  You can't go wrong.  It is a little saltier to eat as a stand alone item so it's nice that they provide some light veggies on the side.  I would actually get sticky rice to eat with this as well.  One sticky rice portion is small, literally enough for one person, so get more.\\n\\nNext up was the Muu Paa Kham Waan which is boar collar meat with an extremely pungent sauce with crushed up goodies on top.  You wrap this in the mustard greens they provide on the side and use the crushed ice to cleanse your palette.  The menu says that this is drinking food so I think beer would've lessened the intensity or made it more eatable.  The meat itself was a little on the tough side and I've noticed this when ordering this dish even at other places.  I won't accept it though; I know they can do better!\\n\\nKhao Soi is a coconut chicken curry noodle soup but this was the biggest disappointment for me.  The Burmese version is thick and creamy--true comfort food.  This was watery and flavorless.  They do give you a lot of tender chicken pieces but that didn't make up for it.  Also, it needs a lot more of the condiments (lime, chili flakes, shallots, pickled mustard greens) to make up for the lack of flavor.  \\n\\nBloody Mary is $9 for a 12 oz. cup, didn't have enough tomato juice, and is on the lighter side.  Not a must get.  I like the hut style restaurant which is nostalgic of some of the indoor/outdoor combo restaurants I've been at in Thailand.

There was no crispy chewiness to be found anywhere! Just a whole lot of slightly mushy brioche. The pumpkin spice flavor could have been taken up a notch as I also found it to be a bit bland.\\n- Corned beef hash eggs benedict: Advertised as \\"addictive,\\" this dish was quite good. I loved that the poached eggs had runny yolks and that they were sparing in the use of Hollandaise (not too rich). The corned beef hash was a little bit on the salty side.\\n- Western home fries: Standard fare-- nice mix of ham, onions and bell peppers.

That said, what makes Pok Pok a PDX must-try -- yes, even in spite of the ridiculous line you're bound to encounter -- is the completely one-of-a-kind dining experience it offers. Between the vast menu of authentic street fare-driven dishes, the cramped premises, and the din and bustle of the slinkily opaque dining premises, Pok Pok offers a straight up no frills taste of Bangkok without the airfare or the cockroaches (I hope). \\n\\nWe had the Yam Tuna ($12), 2 orders of sticky rice ($2 each), and papaya salad ($9). The papaya salad and tuna dish featured similarly loud and complex flavor profiles that burst with the signature umami pungency of fish sauce balanced by the bright freshness of citrus. However, I was particularly impressed with the tuna, even though the way that it was served flaking apart unappetizingly reminded me of the canned stuff -- the meat was extraordinarily tender, juicy, and thoroughly marinated.\\n\\nUsing price as a cue, we thought that would be enough food for two to share, but the serving sizes were seriously TINY. For the price we paid, we could've easily gotten 2x more food at a comparable Thai restaurant. Plus the food wasn't so mind-blowingly amazing in either quality or execution to justify the price. Sadly, we left Pok Pok still hungry and in utter puzzlement over how some onions tossed in a can of tuna could add up to $12.\\n\\nEven though it exudes the self-aware pretentiousness to match (e.g. aloof service, a stubborn kitchen that absolutely will not accommodate the smallest of substitutions so don't even think you can try to get away with a request), Pok Pok is certainly a Portland institution for good reason, if not one of the most unique and singular restaurants in America."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Terrific ambiance with Austin history.

Their pot stickers//gyoza are pretty standard with nothing terribly special going on, and their pork bun was okay but not great.

And to be honest, it's mostly miss, even given the best intentions and resources.  Chomping methodically on a roll that was made 15 minutes ago and has sat on a cold plate all during that time is a completely different experience than sitting at the bar at a quality sushi restaurant, ordering omakase, and watching the chef expertly make your sushi.  The rice, still holding a hint of warmth from the chef's hand, and the fish yielding and almost liquefying under pressure, and then a hint of wasabi.  Really, you don't need soy sauce.  Fish has flavor.  Rice, too, has flavor.  As you chew and savor, starch in the rice interacts with your saliva and turns sweet, as starch turns to sugar.  It's that dance of flavors that makes sushi so damn good.  \\n\\nEven aside from quality of food, the whole buffet environment really isn't conducive to that savoring of a finite, all too few morsels.  The buffet lines, however well lit and well stocked, is just a food trough.  So there is a limitation to the concept of sushi buffet.\\n\\nHaving said all that. Nori Nori's efforts are actually pretty damn good.  Of some insanely large variety they offer, I primarily focus on two or three.  And I think your experience will be better if you do too. \\n\\nDecor and service are better than some full service restaurants I've been to.  I've been to the previous two incarnation of the business that were in the same location, and in fact, some of the plates and glasses bear the old logo, and Nori Nori is easily the best of the three.  If you have been to the other two, perhaps the snarky ones among us may say that is a faint praise indeed.  But Nori Nori would stand on its own as possibly the best sushi buffet in town, although that is in itself subject to qualifications and limitations I've made in the beginning of my review.\\n\\nSo let me just say it.  Nori Nori is one of the better sushi restaurants in ATL, and rise to near the top if value is considered."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"The lure of this bookstore is the way my husband got me to move to Portland.

He also made perfect recommendations after asking us a few question. Everything we ate was fantastic! I only have a few minor suggestions for improvement... First I'd highly recommend fixing the signage to make it more clear which name is correct and what exactly you are. My close friend lives in the neighborhood and has never stopped because she thought it was a store to buy meatballs in to take home and prepare later. While we were there more than once I heard discussion on it being Stoppe not Shoppe. So a common mistake which could make it difficult if someone was trying to Google you out find your website, etc later. Small menu suggestions... As someone who was only traveling through I had a very hard time limiting which choice to make because they all sounded delicious and I knew I probably wouldn't be able to come back so offer a trio or other sampler option every day. And lastly as it's been mentioned in other reviews the soda options are in can form at a $1.75 a can. If you must keep the simplicity of the can then the price needs to be lowered significantly. I had the spicy pork Meatball and drank my can of soda rather quickly and wished for another but wasn't going to spend $3.50 in beverage. But if it was $1.00 a can I wouldn't have felt bad ordering a second one because $2 is still within reason for a beverage expense. And when bought in bulk that price still allows plenty of profit.

However, recently this week I came to get my sushi fix since I haven't had any in a very long time and the sushi wasn't as great as the first time I came to Sushi Kiku. I ordered the Super Crunch Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll for dinner, as they have all sushi half price, but dine in only. \\n\\nThe Super Crunch Roll had avocado, tempura shrimp, and crunchy topping on the roll. The shrimp tempura was simple, with just shrimp tempura wrapped in seaweed and sushi rice. The rice on my rolls could have been better and some of the pieces almost fell apart. That signals the sushi wasn't made right. I think that day, the sushi chef was training a new person because I was at the bar and the usual sushi chef was looking over the new person's shoulder. He looked like he was seeing if he was doing it right. I also ordered vanilla ice cream for dessert ($2.95), but it was too much for me to finish because it was 2 big scoops of ice cream topped with some fudge, with a side of whipped cream and some sour apple sauce and possibly raspberry sauce. It was a tad too sweet for me so I couldn't finish it all. \\n\\nThe service was fast and very friendly. I was greeted entering the restaurant, there was friendly service as I ordered and then was greeted when leaving, so I was pleased. The restaurant is pretty trendy and nicely decorated. I'm giving it 4 stars because the other countless times I've been here, the sushi was great! But just not this time because of the sushi. Although I've had better sushi, this is good enough if you want a fast fix to your sushi needs for half the price! If you have never been here before, definitely try it and it won't cost you much if you go during their half price sushi time!"},{"name":"Toichi Ichiban Japanese Cuisine","address":"5 Kendall St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Food is great, staff are almost too nice if that's possible.

Everything was so good - well spiced, seasoned, with meat that was cooked perfectly. The couscous was such a surprise - it was a lot richer and finer than I was used to. The vegetables that it came with were also cooked really well, and together they all melted in my mouth. The lamb chops were one of my favorites - it was cooked perfectly and was so juicy. \\n\\nWe also had a carafe of the cherbat - the lemonade with spices and rose petals. While it was really tasty and complemented the meal well, we both agreed that it was a bit too sweet for our tastes. We actually ended up diluting it with a lot of water and enjoyed it a lot that way. \\n\\nWe're so happy we found this place and definitely plan on coming back to try other things on the menu.

Always out of town did not help either, my love life was dismal at best back at home in San Francisco, never had I felt this alone, that was, until I found Powell's Books. It was really the mothership for me. Every evening after work, after working out, I'd come to Powell's and spend nights after nights devouring books. \\n\\nThen life happened. For over a decade I did not return, until this evening. I took the entire clan. We spent hours. Three large paper bags later, and over a hundred dollars later, we came out of the bookstore, happy and satisfied. This was a good trip. I was thanked for having introduced them to this Portland institution. The place had not changed from my memory, perhaps larger, more renovated and now a very nice cafe adjacent to it.\\n\\nStill no expert about the romantic love business just like I was in the 90s, but I can definitely speak about the love for books business.

The ambience is nice, a little small but it's cute! Now It's not to say the other places are bad but the quality of the milk tea and tapioca pearls at vivis sets it above the rest. The pearls here are very soft and don't feel like they are plastic, and the milk tea isn't tart or overly sweet (and I got the normal sweet 3Q milk tea!).

They had their growing pains at first--a friend had a really delicious spinach salad in which the delectable baby spinach had long stems attached, so she looked like a giraffe as she ate. Not cute. But they have accommodated my pickiest friend--the kind of girl who considers sending back her plate a badge of honor--without batting an eye.\\n\\nI think my best trip here was a dinner with my husband. We split an entree after having appetizers (the calamari are the best I've ever had!), and the kitchen split it and plated it really attractively. This level of service is huge for me.\\n\\nI went back today for a lunch with a good friend, and it was, again, consistent. My burger was delicious, and perfectly medium rare. She really enjoyed her caprese sandwich (which was recommended by the server), and we had this really crisp, sweet fruit salad on the side. I really love it when I can go to a place and be totally pleased that I ordered the thing that is good for me rather than feeling like I settled.\\n\\nI wish there were more restaurants in Atlanta at this price point that offer this level of service. It's a bit cheaper than my usual special-occasion fare, but the service is every bit as classy. \\n\\nI am disappointed that they have changed their dinner menu to an eclectic mediterranean-inspired cuisine because I really have enjoyed every \\"new American\\" dish I've eaten there. Well, and I just don't really think pasta when I want to go out for a nice meal.

Unfortunately, I never even knew about Din Ho either. \\n\\nOn our first visit, we ordered snow pea leaves, the eggplant with shredded pork hot pot, and beef in garlic sauce. I like pork-eggplant dish, but the beef dish seemed especially watered down and overall, there was just a lot of oil. Of the three, the eggplant had the best flavors.\\n\\nAfter the first visit, we figured that we needed to try other things - certainly seafood dishes and bbq - but our initial visit was a let down.  \\n\\nOur second visit, we went with a large group and shared a variety of dishes from the menu. I tried the bbq pork and the duck. I kinda liked the pork. The other dishes though i found pretty bland. Passable, but lacking. Of the many dishes ordered last night, i most enjoyed the General Tso's and the hot and sour soup. \\n\\nIf the dishes had more flavor and less oil we definitely would like Din Ho better. \\n\\nPortion sizes are large - we have leftovers for the next 2 days.

So in my usual format, here is the skinny on this place.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Delightfully modern with a slight throw back to mid 60's but with a 1/2 sports bar thrown in.  Kinda doesn't know what it wants to be.  Lots of dark wood and angles and TVs in the bar area.  Simple chic meets sports fans? \\nDrinks:  There were four of us at dinner.  We ordered margaritas, how can you miss?  And Bloody Marys.  The bartender apparently thought we ordered virgin drinks....Penalty flag for weak drinks, although we could all drive home very safely, so there's that.\\nService: Our waiter was attentive and prompt.  Not too intrusive.  He did a nice job.  Looked fifteen though...seriously.  Did anyone check his ID?\\nMenu:  Short and to the point.  This is not a vegetarian place, but you might look at the menu and wonder where the other meat choices are besides the slim pickens you find on the one page entree side.  If you take away the sports bar items (burger and french dip) then you have few choices left.  Where's the chicken fried ribeye for instance?\\nFood: Well, my french dip was ok, but $12?  Really?  Go to Hoody's in Round Rock for their Philly cheesesteak if you want perfection in sandwich making.  And at half the price...  The other couple ordered the pork chops, and something else I didn't recogize, maybe scallops?  They said it was good...\\n\\nOverall impression...meh....we probably won't come back.  A little pricey for just ok food and less than average drinks.  And at 7PM on a Saturday evening in Austin, there should have been a long wait for a table, but the place was half empty...that should have been a clue.  My guess is they won't make it as is.  Change or die.  Wanna be a sports bar, then commit.  It's all the rage.  Wanna be a classy restaurant?  Commit.

My husband may have made a pancake in an inappropriate shape while I stuck to hearts and smiley faces.\\n\\nThere were lots of families with kids there and the kids appeared to be having a blast making their own pancakes and spelling out their names in batter and such.

Oh, and my apologies to the parents of the little ones for my husband's naughty pancake.\\n\\nFor the gluten free folks, just be sure your griddle is very clean before you start cooking to avoid cross-contamination. It appears they wipe them down with a rag between uses. I cleaned mine again myself with a wet napkin to be safe.\\n\\n The only downside to this place is that it gets warm in there with all those griddles on. I imagine that's not a huge problem in Portland most of the year, but it was pretty warm out the week we were there and the fans in the restaurant were no match for the combo of warm weather and hot griddles.

We called ahead to check availability.  The woman who answered the phone was friendly and helpful, suggesting we arrive at 4:45pm and that we'd have a good chance at sitting in the bar with full dinner service, even though they didn't have any tables available in the dining room until 7:30pm.  \\n\\nWe arrived at the front door at 4:35pm.  A well-dressed couple showed up a few minutes later, tried the door, and proceeded to cut in front of us as if we weren't there.  When the door opened, suddenly they acknowledged us and gave us the opportunity to go in first although we let them go as they were obviously more eager.  The maitre d' was busy chatting with his back turned to us, but finally turned around and assumed his role, pointing us to the bar area.  \\n\\nHere are the pros and cons:\\n\\nThe pros are that most of the staff are very friendly, accommodating, and on top of their game, with the exception of the distracted maitre d'.  We received excellent, attentive bar and full dinner service from all of the different staff who took our orders and brought food and drinks to us.  One staff (the manager?) even took care to encourage me to enjoy myself after he could see I was perturbed with the couple at the door.  I ordered a mixed drink and it was very good.  The seats at the tables in the bar are very comfortable and spacious with tables that are large enough to fit several plates and glasses.  Desserts are presented on a tray so that you can see examples.  \\n\\nThe cons are that some (not all) of the clientele here are pretentious and can be obnoxious to deal with and listen to, including our neighbors at the table next to us.  The dress code is business casual, but you'd better be dressed to impress if you want to fit in with this elite crowd.  My husband really enjoyed his food.  I didn't like the taste of my Chicken Christopher or the mashed potatoes.  The chicken was salty and the mashed potatoes tasted as if they came out of a box.  My husband commented that the bread that came with his salad was much better than the bread served before dinner.  The food servings are huge.  The food options are limited.  Food is a la carte so you end up ordering a $28 chicken dish, but that is absolutely all that you get.  You cannot see the prices in advance.  With tip, we ended up shelling out about $154 for two.  \\n\\nWe are glad we tried Morton's, but discovered that this is not really our type of place."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Hands down the greatest bookstore of all time.

'No soup for YOU!'  or \\"The food was good, if they could just leave the drama at home\\".\\n\\nSo, we arrived at Baraka Cafe on a Saturday evening at 5:10pm and already a line was forming for dinner.  I had misread their website and thought the place opened at 5pm, but alas, not until 5:30pm.  We waited patiently and then around 5:30pm, a little man opened the front door, and walked away.    We sat ourselves, as did the other groups of people, and then waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Everyone in the restaurant looked at each other,  trying to figure out what was going on.  Was this a candid camera episode?  No waitress.  Nobody at all.  It felt like we had intruded into someone's home, unwanted guests.\\n\\nat 5:50pm, the man walked to each table to take orders, but he spoke no english, so we needed to point each item, and forget it if you had questions.  And then, the man disappeared for another half hour.  Around that time, another threesome entered the restaurant, and after standing in the doorway for 10 minutes, the man finally saw them and seated them.  One of the other customers asked him if he was in the restaurant alone and he responded 'yes, til she come in an hour'.  \\n\\nI am not sure who 'she' was, but luckily (or not) it didn't take that long.  Around 6:30, she came in with a bag of groceries.  I don't know if she is the owner, or the man's wife, his boss, or what the relationship was, but she started yelling at him, for a HALF AN HOUR, so that everyone in the restaurant could hear.\\n\\n\\"No, when I'm not here, don't take no orders. I don't care. They can wait!'  And then she just went on and on about it, storming around the dining room (it is one room only) and slamming cabinet doors and taking out water pitchers and slamming them on the tables as she angrily had to put up with people being in her restaurant at 6:30pm on a saturday night. \\n\\nI understand Algerian women cover themselves head to toe in black garb, and normally that's fine.  But when you are in one of their restaurants, which apparently has no lights or electricity, and this woman is ranting and raving at the poor helpless chef, well, I wasn't the only one who commented that she looked like Death and we better not let her touch us.\\n\\nFirst she brought out the rose lemonade, which everyone in the restaurant ordered.  Okay, Yelpers, I get that so many of you raved about the lemonade.  But hell, it is Wyler's with some mint leaves and rose petals tossed in it. Sheesh!   I imagine on a warm summer day on my porch, laying back in my reclining chair enjoying the sun and breeze, that this would be a wonderfully refreshing drink.  But when trapped in a dark room with a lunatic, well, Jesus, like I said, it's just Wylers!!\\n\\nMy friend nervously said 'don't say anything. just thank you. don't make eye contact.'  Unfortunately, the girls at the table over from us didn't heed that advice. 'We ordered a carafe, not a pitcher'.  IDIOTS!  Don't you know not to make her mad!  \\n\\n\\"This is CARAFE!\\" She stormed away.  Came back with a pitcher for the next table which was in the identical plastic pitcher except it was filled to the top instead of just under the spout.  She shoved it in their faces.  \\"THIS IS A PITCHER!\\"\\n\\nI swear. I'm not making this up.  You could see the terror in the girls' eyes.  Hell, I was about to jump out the window and make a run for it.\\n\\nFortunately, she stopped yelling at the customers for so rudely intruding on her evening, and went back to yelling at the chef.  \\"Tell him he's late! Get off the phone! 30 seconds is all you get on phone!\\"  And \\"When I tell you to go to Shaw's or Stop and Shop, you get THIS. Don't you read the menu.  What you got isn't on the menu!\\"\\n\\nIn rapid succession, she began bringing out each table's appetizers.  'This is for table 7??! They don't need 3 appetizers right now! They can wait! I don't care!'.  The coupld at table 2 were, well, IDIOTS! Doesn't anyone LEARN!!!  She brings them their appetizer and the gentleman says 'excuse me, we didn't order this.'  His wife then tried to add 'it is probably for a different table' but before she could, the woman yanked the food away, stormed to the kitchen and screamed at the chef for getting the order wrong.  Not only had he stupidly taken our orders when she wasn't there, but he GOT IT WRONG TOO!!\\"\\n\\nI think everyone had sympathy for that poor, poor, poor man who must have done something wrong in a previous life to end up in this hell.

And I was not disappointed, food so good, I had to come back twice before I left.\\n\\nThe first time I came here, it was on a Friday night, I read about how crazy the wait could get. My boyfriend and I decided to wait it out at the bar. We got the Moonshine \\"Corndog\\" Shrimp, a Moonshine staple. Definitely would recommend, it came with honey mustard with blueberry. A twist on a classic corndog. There were about 4 skewers and by the time we finished, our table was ready.\\n\\nWe were seated on the patio, which was brightly lit. Our table was already set up with water and seasoned popcorn. We ordered the chicken and waffles and green chile macaroni. While waiting for our food to come out, our waiter brought us corn bread muffins (complimentary) and it was delicious.\\n\\nOur food did not take long to come out. Presentation was very nice. The chicken and waffles was good, albeit a basic choice, nothing TOO outstanding. The green chile macaroni on the other hand, was amazing. I'm not a big fan of mac and cheese. But this dish shattered my expectations. All the flavors complimented each other very well. It was not too cheesy, the corn prevented any over cheesiness.\\n\\nThe portions of all dishes are huge, you could probably share with someone. We were so full, we had to pass on dessert.\\n\\nThe second time we came was on a Sunday night. Admittedly, we were those annoying customers that came literally 15 minutes before closing. But the staff were all very nice and did not try to rush our meal. We got the same treatment as we did on Friday. This time around, we got the shrimp and grits and seared rainbow trout with mac and cheese (this plate comes with a side of your choice). Both dishes were great and did not disappoint. The mac and cheese was super creamy and the bacon cornbread stuffing sprinkled on the trout gave it a nice texture.\\n\\nSince it was our last night in Austin, we decided to get dessert, despite how stuffed we are.

We were up north, so I remembered Zed's and made a beeline for it. I grumbled a little that the new chef had taken the delicious chicken pot pie off the menu, but I followed the server's recommendation and tried the halibut on a bed of Brussels sprouts. My friends got the chicken fried chicken and a second order of the halibut, this one with green beans.\\n\\nThe fish was delicious (my friend, a coastal native who's eaten halibut all her life, said this was the best she'd ever had), but it was the sprouts that really caught my attention. I would have been happy to eat a plate of just those for dinner. They were crispy, caramelized, and more flavorful than I've ever experienced. I rationed them through my meal so I didn't gobble them all down at once. I speared one of my friend's green beans, and it was similarly delicious -- fresh, ripe, and juicy, cooked just to perfection.\\n\\nAfter dinner, I was slightly more than full, but when the server mentioned creme brulee, we couldn't resist. We ordered that and apple pie, and we two seafood eaters shared the brulee. Again, it was the best I can remember having, with a thickish crust of perfectly caramelized sugar and topped with flavorful, ripe berries.\\n\\nZed's is a little spendy for a weeknight dinner, but I'll remember that meal for a long time.

My favorite dish to get is a combo mixed platter that consists of dolma grape leaves, lamb gyro meat, rice and a salad with cucumber, tomato and onion and vinegar. It is open very late on the weekends, which make this a popular place for college students coming in after a late night. I have also tried  the gyro and a chicken combo platter, which were both delicious and not very expensive for the amount of food you get.

The bartender although showed great knowledge of the drink menu and gave good suggestions for what we would like. He also accommodated our needs for taking things like bacon and steak out of their giant Bloody Mary. The only other positive was how nice the server was even though he didn't come back to our table often enough and could not answer some of our questions about the menu because of how it did not have any variety in the vegetarian department and also had written down multiple times to not ask for any modifications to your order. I understand that if you have a busy crowd where that can come from but if that's the case you should have options that are much more well-rounded for customers like me and my family who can't eat meat or eggs for religious reasons. On top of that the French toast was not appetizing in the least and was very blackened to the point where it just tasted like burnt bread. The totchos were basically a mountain of regular tater-tots with a little spoon of pico de gallo and were soggy by the cheese from how long it took to got to our table. Another off-putting point was how out of all the tables out there we were the only ones served water in plastic cups with little to no ice while everyone else, even the groups that came after us, were all given normal cups filled to the top with ice and were refilled too. They didn't refill ours at all even after we had asked. It's from all this that made me decide that The Nook deserves this rating from our experience.

We are originally from NY and my wife is a steak lover and knows what's good.  This turned out to be the most disappointing steak experience we had in Atlanta.  My wife ordered the 8oz filet and I ordered the Elk chop with a blueberry sauce, we also ordered 2 sides FF and spinach (nothing elaborate).  The main course arrived with no sides and we assumed they were on the way.  Five min. Later they still hadn't arrived and I could not find the server.  When the server arrived and asked how we were enjoying the meal I asked him where the rest of the meal was.  He advised the sides would be out in a couple of min.  The sides did arrive in a couple of min. But the spinach was half cooked, the FF were great.  \\n\\nMy wife's steak looked like it was cooked in a microwave and thrown on the grill to get some marks on it.  The steak was presented on a large plate with some onions that looked like they were from the bottom of onion soup, that was it, no garnish very unappetizing. The steak itself was gray in color and had no char on the meat.  My elk chop was cooked well but was over salted on half the chop and unseasoned on the other half.  The blueberry sauce would have worked better on pancakes.

We all ordered, and waited around for our food to come. My friend had ordered a new menu item, pancakes with pulled pork. Once the first two meals came, the dopey waiter informed my friend in a super non chalant way that he forgot to tell my friend they were out of pulled pork and asked if he wanted to substitute for another meat. That's like ordering a poutine and being asked if you  wanted teriyaki sauce instead of gravy..anyways, since the whole reason my friend ordered the meal was because it was the pulled pork, he said no to a substitution. The waiter seemed insulted and my friend asked for a menu to order something else. Since by this time everyone else already had their food and it would take at least 15-20 minutes to order something else, he just decided to share what another friend had ordered and was pretty bummed about it. The waiter wasn't apologetic at all and didn't even seem to care that it would suck to watch all your friends eating in front of you while you waited for the kitchen to make you something new. To top it all off, the pancakes sans pulled pork was plated in the warming area and the waiter just started chowing down on it. He didn't even offer to comp the screwed up meal or even the coffee. I've have a ton of experience in the food service industry and it took everything in me not to tell the waiter how crappy his service was. My friends aren't the type to cause a fuss, but we were all pretty bummed and none of us tipped him a cent.

I've taken dates as well as out of town guests there, and everyone has really enjoyed it and had a lot of positive things to say about it, which I'll try to capture the essence of here.\\n\\nI'll start with the most annoying meal for an intown Atlanta resident - Saturday or Sunday brunch with its dearth of options and long queues.  Not very many people know the Sweet Lowdown not only serves brunch but has one of the best brunches around.  We always get a table immediately, inside or out, which is certainly a bonus.  The food is consistently outstanding.  The biscuits are great, the breakfast sandwiches superb, they have amazing grits, even she-crab soup (this is coming from a former Charlestonian mind you), and if you have a sweet tooth any waffle or similar plate I've had or sampled is top notch.\\n\\nAt lunch they offer great value, especially the 2-for-$6 deal where you can combine two smaller portions of their extensive menu.  They have great salads, po' boys, and other southern classics such as fried green tomatoes.\\n\\nIn the evening I suspect this place at times is a bit of scene, but I won't comment on that since I don't really care to judge it.  I can say I am baffled by certain reviewers who claim this place is expensive.  First, they have a huge menu where you can share small plates, just have a [very nice] salad, or order excellently prepared \\"home style\\" dishes such as chicken and dumplings which are modernized but not deconstructed and run around $15.  Moreover the other main plates are completely in line with what you would expect at a good restaurant in the city, esp. right on Peachtree in Midtown.  Just because it takes inspiration from Southern dishes doesn't mean it's like or trying to compete with Mary Mac's tea room in price or any other way.  You can spend a lot there if you so wish but you are not 'forced' to do so. I suspect most of people's bill is, as usual, the booze and wine not the food.\\n\\nI've haven't mentioned service because I haven't really had a bad experience; servers have always been competent and unobtrusive.

He got a beer but no water for me, even when we asked the guy who brought the beer... Finally seated at our table, it took forever for our waiter to actually come and greet us. He dropped off some complimentary nuts and left without really saying much. We waited a good 15 minutes for him to take our order. My finace ordered the wings and I ordered the Pok Pok special. The waiter came back to inform us that the hen on my dinner order would take 15 minutes and asked if that would be ok. I said it would. I asked to have the grilled corn special while I waited\\n\\nA few minutes later my fiance's wings came out. I thought they would be brought at the same time my dinner was since they were his meal... He started eating. The corn came a bit later so at least I had something...\\n\\n25 minutes later I was still waiting for my dinner... We asked around 20 minutes in of our waiter when it would be ready. He didn't bother to check with the kitchen but just said 1-2 minutes. It was not ready after that. By 25 minutes we were both irritated, I was hungry and we decided to pay for what we already had and leave. We couldn't even find our incompetent waiter so went to the hostess stand to tell her. Not very sympathetic, she told us to go back to our table and the waiter would help us cash out. We cashed out and paid- no comp was offered on anything. We left and went to Little Big Burger so I could finally eat at 8:45PM...\\n\\nThis place is overhyped, disorganized and not worth the wait.

The boar came with a fistful of moist rice in a small woven basket on the side, and a bundle of bok choi (??) laced with ice accompanied the dish, both as it turns out, meant to extinguish the inferno. The boar meat was very tough and chewy. The overwhelming spices prevented any chance of actually tasting the meat -- some kind of citrusy/cilantro-ish/habanero (ok, probably those tiny Asian peppers) spice medly that was more Mexican than Vietnamese (or was it Thai?) covered the undercooked meat strips.

It was good but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. We didn't order a ton we ordered the Khao Soi, a curry noodle soup and some coconut rice to start and then the fish sauce wings since the waitress and everyone who had recommended it said they are a must. The restaurant is super funky, pretty dark and smells a little weird but a cool place, seems like it would be great in the summer outside. The coconut rice was a very small portion and really just tasted like rice I didn't taste any coconut and it wasn't that toasty sweet flavor you expect with coconut rice. We got the soup with chicken, it was a bit hard to eat and dish up, there were two large pieces of chicken on the bone in the soup and a ladle to dish up which make dishing up a little tricky and messy with the noodles, we ended up pulling the chicken out onto a separate plate and without a knife we used spoons and forks to try to cut it up. The chicken itself was very tender. The soup is served with limes, pickled veg, chili and shallots. I added lime, chili and shallots to mine. The soup had a pretty good flavor but it was missing something in my mind but I couldn't put my finger on it, maybe a bit too much fish sauce or not enough heat(they said the chili was very potent so I was maybe too conservative with adding it). The wings were surprising a lot of reviews said they were too salty but I though the flavor was good, sort of like a honey barbecue wing I could have done with a bit spicier and crispier but pretty good, very unique!

Many of the shelves facing out to the main walkways of the bookstore serve as features for recently released books as well as older classics.

It definitely adds a feeling of intimacy and community that huge chain bookstores like Barnes & Noble don't have.\\n\\nIt was too easy to lose track of time while exploring all of the different books and different sections, and I know that we didn't get to all of them!\\n\\nThis bookstore is so amazing, I would move to Portland just for this book lover's wonderland!"},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've been to many ramen places and I'm really glad I decided to try this one!

I also had the chicken karaage, which was amazing. The pieces were large, crispy, and juicy in the center. The prices on the menu are all reasonable, and I'll definitely be back to try more. Even though we went at a really busy time, the wait time wasn't very long. We checked in through an online system in the store and inserted a phone number which they texted once our table was ready.

Delightfully sour, they go well with some of the spicier dishes and work as good palate cleansers between dishes.\\n\\nPapaya Pok Pok is lovely, and yes, a bit spicy. I still say go for it, as it's a refreshing way to start a meal. We also had the wild boar collar with a side of sticky rice. The boar came with mustard greens on ice, and the contrast between the ice cold greens and the warm, spicy boar was delicious.

We came in just as it opened for dinner time and you could already tell that it was going to be good because there were a whole bunch of people just waiting to be seated before it even opened. At first I thought it was going to be like every other sushi/Japanese buffet we've been to, but this one really surprised me. They had a whole array of hot foods and sushi. It also didn't taste like the bland frozen foods that most Asian buffets have. It was fresh and it seemed like they had to cook more plates every 5-10 minutes because it would be gone that quick. The only drawback I would say about this restaurant is that one of the waitresses knocked over my 2 month son while he was sitting in his car seat sleeping. While she did somewhat help get the chair back up (he was sitting in his car seat that was placed on top of the child seat that was upside down so that the car seat could fit in it) she did not apologize or ask if he was ok. After that while incident happened I just grabbed him from his car seat to calm him down. Had he not been buckled up in the seat, he would have been seriously injured. I don't see how that could have happened as the aisle we were in was pretty much empty and there was a lot of room for that waitress to walk through, but she was not paying attention. I wouldn't even really pay that much mind to it if she had apologized and showed sympathy and wrote it off as an accident, but she didn't. Our own waitress was more sympathetic and caring even though she did not see it.

I'm not sure what has happened as I hadn't been here in a while (a couple years), but I assume new ownership or a new chef? I was under the impression that it was family owned and operated with the family actually cooking the food (which I think is what USED to take place), but there is no way an Italian chef is cooking this food at this point!! I was actually asked if I wanted to \\"UPGRADE TO THE HOMEMADE PASTA OPTION FOR $3.\\" Ummmm what!?! They aren't all homemade!? Nope. I was told they use boxed store bought pasta unless you pay $3 for the homemade pasta of the day. Our pasta dishes then came out in literally 5 minutes!! How in the world can you make a dish that fast!? The answer was clearly that the sauces were pre-made or store bought too. I could barely eat a few bites; I felt like I was at Olive Garden, only to be honest, this was actually worse! The bread isn't even good anymore. They use poor quality olive oil now as well, which I did not care for at all. The bottle of wine we purchased wasn't good either and there were no waiters that even knew anything about wine to help us make a decision. WHY PIAZZA?!? WHAT HAS HAPPENED! I don't think I'll come back unless I can clearly see the place has turned around, but there are so many other amazing Italian restaurants in portland, who would come here!?

They really are; from the shores of the left coast to the waters more local, be assured that they are as fresh and tasty as they come. I didn't see any coming from the Gulf Coast (which I'm completely okay with), and none from our friends in France, but what is offered will more than suit most shellfish aficionados every desire. The decor is smart, yet sleek and seductive with a style that embraces life in Massachusetts Bay while catapulting this gastronomic pleasure-dome into a chic and contemporary outfit. Server stations are strategically located throughout the dinging areas as to keep the flow on the floor and business running as smooth as possible. There seems to be a real team atmosphere here, often multiple servers helping out at your table - pooling tips or not, this helps to streamline the entire experience so that the diner is not waiting around, even when they are relatively busy.\\n\\nIt should come as no surprise that their raw bar and shellfish selections are superb, but more importantly their entrees hold their own as well which is an essential element to making this much more than a snack shack (of sorts).

Nothing is so seductive that you'll find yourself losing your inhibitions and doing something regret, but it is one of those places that you meet friends after work or on the weekend and take in a perfectly respectable seafood meal. I would highly recommend the bar as opposed to a sit down fine dining experience if you're looking to impress someone.\\n\\nSome of my favorites include: \\n\\n- Fried Clams: plucked right out of the waters on the South Shawwh (Shore) and served with tartar sauce, these are a New England staple and executed perfectly.\\n\\n- Local Clam Chowder: again with the same native clams, add buttermilk biscuits, and house-cured bacon and you've got yourself an interesting take on another New England classic. If I had to be specific, I would say that this represents a marriage of New England and Manhattan Clam Chowder(s) as it is not as creamy as we've come to expect.\\n\\n- Lobster Roll: How could you ever go wrong with this, really? Nuff said.\\n\\n- New Bedford Sea Scallops: served with red potatoes, ham, caramelized onions, and garlic parsley pur√©e; a very delectable dish!\\n\\nOthers not mentioned are sure to be sufficient, but if you've come accustomed to exquisite fine dining profiles, they may fall short.

Apparently, this place can make it happen. If I have to describe this place in one word, it would have to be sophisticated. This word is probably defined as refined and classy. It is also a little hard to believe that one of the most sophisticated restaurants in the somewhat decent city of Boston is actually near my school. This place is located inside one of the most sophisticated and \\"posh\\" hotels in Boston's Kenmore Square area and it is also within a good walking distance to Fenway Park. I decided to come here to hang out with a few friends. \\n\\nFor drinks, my friends decided to order some cocktails. I got a \\"Snug Harbor Smash\\", which is a four rum blend with lime, sugar, served with a lot of crushed ice and a mint. I thought it was a decent drink, nice, cold and refreshing, but a little strong due to the rum. It is fairly expensive, about $10 for a drink. \\n\\nAs for food, I got some small dishes. I got the Island Creek Fried Oyster Slider, and a couple of oysters from the raw oyster bar. These oysters were the Island Creek and the Summerside. The Island Creek is from the somewhat sophisticated community of Duxbury, MA while the Summerside is from Prince Edward Island, a small province located in Northeastern parts of Canada. \\n\\nThe slider sandwich was tasty. Loved the crispy oyster meat. It was fairly small, about 4 cm wide, and 4.5 cm high. It's a great choice to splurge $4 on a snack sized sandwich. If it was bigger sandwich, I think it could be one of the tastiest seafood sandwiches this somewhat decent city could offer. As for the oysters, the Island Creek was a little larger than the Summerside. I put some cocktail sauces on both of the the oysters. Both oysters were fresh, had this juicy meatiness, and were deliciously tasty. I think if you do not get at least one piece of oyster, local or Canadian, you might be missing out on something special. I liked how they also give you a box filled with flavorings such as Sriracha sauce, horse radish, and even Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard if you really want to put more flavor on your oysters. \\n\\nService was really good. My friends and I actually sat at the bar. I think this place definitely has some of the most sophisticated bartenders Boston can potentially offer. He was really friendly and attentive. He also had some style to how he presented a bottle of wine to a sophisticated-looking couple. What he did was that he held the wine bottle similar to how a butler would hold the wine bottle. He also poured the wine in a decanter (a glass container used to serve wine) in a really stylish manner. It shows that these bartenders really know about cocktails and wine at the same time. My friends also really liked talking with the bartender as well. \\n\\nAs for the interior and atmosphere, when I came inside, I actually did not feel like I was in Boston. I actually felt like I was in a great and sophisticated restaurant either in New York City, Toronto, or San Francisco. The interior has this contemporary post-modern look as if Norman Foster or even Frank Gehry did the interior design. I think you may have to dress nice for this sophisticated place (maybe something similar to a Kenneth Cole buttoned collared shirt and nice trousers by Calvin Klein?) but it's not really required since my friends and I wore something a little more casual than what a typical sophisticated person would wear. \\n\\nOverall, I think this is probably one example of Boston's restaurants and food at its finest. Although I do not think it is the best place to get some tasty oysters, this is still a good choice to splurge a lot of money on drinks, and tasty oysters while sitting in a sophisticated environment in Boston. I hope this place still maintains the sophisticated charm that makes it distinct from the typical American restaurant in Boston and continues to attract the non-typical but somewhat sophisticated American clientele that is distinct from the typical New England clientele or the typical American clientele."},{"name":"Jerusalem Cafe","address":"516 SE Chkalov Dr, Ste 45","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"took my mom to the chaklov location to check the place out.

I like how the place is not as dimly lit as other dining locations of similar style. \\n\\nFor the food, the seafood and oysters are consistently fresh. I love and always get the salmon tartare which is well seasoned and goes perfectly with the side of crispy chips. The clam chowder, while I've had better elsewhere, is still delicious. It's creamy, not too salty, has bits of bacon, and is good for those who prefer thinner chowders. I've also probably had the best fish and chips in Boston here. The fish is definitely high quality, moist, and flakey. If bland, you can season them more with their collection of different vinegars and hot sauces. \\n\\nAnother recommendation is the lobster-roe noodles which you should definitely try at least once. It is an interesting but perfect combination of grilled lobster, braised short rib (super tender), brussel sprouts, butternut squash, oyster mushrooms, and noodles, topped with pecorino cheese. The lobster can be a little tough, but I like how there are actually chunks of lobster and they don't skimp out on it.\\n\\nFor dessert, I recently had the flourless chocolate torte with almond ice cream(?), which was super luxurious but absolutely delicious and nicely personalized for my birthday. It was a surprising combination of flavors, the chocolate with the sauces, nuts, ice cream, etc. \\n\\nMost importantly, I'm impressed by the service which has been consistently top-notch. There is always constant bread, honey butter (yum), and water refills and the waiters are attentive. They divide and plate the food nicely if you're sharing with someone else and aren't annoyed by it. If you make a reservation, they can add personalized messages to the menus which they print new daily. For birthdays, even if you don't order a dessert, they give you a plate of chocolate/fudge with candles. \\n\\nAll in all, I highly recommend checking out the Island Creek Oyster Bar if you're craving seafood and are searching for a pleasant dining experience."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome service and best big chain bbq you will get in Austin.

I arrived at the front door which was locked. It turns out their stated closing time is untrue, but they say they're still open after not letting you in. Even after you show the ISBN and the route to the section where the book is located. The bouncer offered to reserve the book for me since I had all the info. I thanked her, wrote down the book's location, title, author, and ISBN, and came back the next day. After waiting for 10 minutes the reservation desk said it hadn't actually been reserved, and I had to go find it myself. The desk was maybe 30 feet from its location, so I'd waited because somebody was lazy. It was small and out of place by a few spaces, but still only took me a couple minutes.

Not a big deal, but I would be a bit upset if I came in and didn't have a seat.  The waitress was very nice and took our order promptly.  We both decided to go with the Tuesday lunch special, which is your choice of 3 balls, focaccia and a small salad.\\n\\nI opted for a chicken, sausage and Rueben.  The food came out fast and was definitely tasty (Rueben was my favorite), but not overly filling for the price.  They come in cute divided plates (kind of like cafeteria separated plates).  The plates are nice in that they separate each ball, but they are a bit deep and make it difficult to cut your meatball.  I would also like a bit more sauce.  In hindsight, I could have probably asked, but just didn't think of it.  Also note, you cannot get tap water.  They only have bottles or soda.  So this drove the price up to over $13 with tip for 3 small balls.\\n\\nBottom line: I don't think I will be back due to the value of what you get for the money.

Luckily, my cousin planned a lunch with our family, which brought me here today. Are the prices high? Possibly, compared to similar style restaurants in Asia. But there are plenty of affordable dishes here that will leave you full.\\n\\nI opted for the beef pepper rice for lunch. Since I had never been here before, I figured I would try the most basic dish and see how I liked it. The meal came on a hot skillet with thin slices of beef, rice, and corn. The beauty of the hot skillets is they keep your lunch warm, right until the last bite. Pepper Lunch lives up to its name, as the meal is so well seasoned with pepper - great if you're a pepper fan. The dishes come with two sauces on the side - one salty and one sweet. I only tried the salty one (which was tasty), but others at my table said the sweet sauce was just as good.\\n\\nIf thinly sliced beef isn't your style, they have different meats (pork and chicken) as well as hamburger steaks and actual beef steaks. You can cook your steak to your liking by putting it top of the vegetables they put in your skillet to keep it from cooking further.\\n\\nWhat really made this place special was the phenomenal service. I was a little confused when I first walked in, since you put your order in at the counter and pay before you sit at your table. I always find it difficult to tip before my meal, but I wish I had left the staff more. From the minute we sat down, the staff was attentive and friendly. Every single person working in that restaurant had a giant smile on their face. Each time they dropped a dish off at our table (and there were 7), they would patiently explain how to cook our meals properly. They came back several times within the hour we were there to pick up our dishes and to give us more water. The thing that really stood out to me about their service is how well they listened. The staff would come by and ask if we needed anything else, and you could see that they were truly waiting to hear what we said. Even when they came back to ask if we wanted water, they would stand and wait until we answered yes before reaching for our glasses.

Many are based on the family recipes of the Colombian and Puerto Rican owners.\\n\\nAll the dishes we had were delicious, if a bit on the heavy side, in part due to our choices. My favorite was the yucca stuffed shrimp wrapped with bacon and my companion liked the cheese fritters the best. Next time I will be more careful to order some of the lighter dishes. I also recommend ordering a few dishes at a time because the food comes out of the kitchen as soon as it is prepared. The servers are very attentive and friendly, but do not have a sense of timing or pacing. We found ourselves eating too fast and shuffling too many plates around our space.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at Casa B is fantastic. The owners are architects and it shows. They made great use of the small space. It's modern and cozy at the same time. The restaurant has four distinct seating areas: The upstairs is a narrow space, all white, with beautiful white framed mirrors above each table. Downstairs is a bit larger and does not feel like a basement at all. You can dine at bar of the open kitchen, relax on soft furniture in the \\"living room\\" or sit at traditional table seating along the vegetation covered \\"green wall.\\"\\n\\nIn closing, I must mention the tres leches.

I ordered three tacos and two tamales when we had finally decided on red sauce because it wasn't as warm as the green.  She apparently thiught I didn't want any sauce so I git none on the tamales, which was no big deal they were great plain.  The tacos I  got was steak,chicken, and carnitas. All were ok just sooo much cilantro and onions.  My wife ordered the chicken fajitas and it looked really good it alsi came with avacado, lettuce, rice and beans.  And to top it all off was the corn tortilla and flour tortillas for the fajitas were both made on the spot just for our meal if not it certainly taste like it. The only negative aspect of the experience was the tortilla chips she sat in a basket for the salsa, they were stale and when you dipped them they turned into an unchewable piece of rubber.  When we were done waiting to get our bill paid she brought back 5.00 and I told her it was hers and my wife realized I was missing some of my change 10 dollars to be exact when I brought it to her attention she went and got it and simply apologized for the mistake.  Which i felt was in fact a mistake nothing else behind it.   Overall the food we felt lacked seasoning but was good and authentic.

It has a nice relaxed restaurant feel...a true oyster bar type of feel.  The menu is very unique and has multiple different types of oysters to choose from.  What!?  There's more than one type of oyster?  That there is...I also did not know that until stepping foot into this establishment.  Also, every oyster tastes a little different.  I personally recommend the East Beach Blonde oysters, they are delicious!  I also had the fried oyster slider, the clam chowder, and the lobster roll.  So, first off, yes this place is worth coming to if your looking for a cool place to sit back and have a few oysters.  The rest of the food is pretty average for a restaurant of it's caliber.  The clam chowder was pretty good, it isn't New England style, but there are some legit chunks of clam within the chowder.  The fried oyster sliders were alright.  Not much oyster, but the bread and aioli sauce were quite tasty.  Finally, the lobster roll.  I'd heard so much about the lobster roll here and had high hopes for it.  I've been looking for a lobster roll that could topple my experience at Belle Isle, but alas, this was not the place.  Don't get me wrong, the lobster roll was good, but not as good.  In conclusion, I'd have to say that I highly recommend this place for some oysters (oh, and order their house beer, it goes oh so well with oysters) and that I would definitely go back for some delicious oysters!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love, love, love!

Solid 4.5 stars,\\n\\nCame here yesterday when it wasn't too busy on a Saturday evening. I was told by the server that I could pick any seat, looks like he was the only server for the entire restaurant. \\n\\nThe selection here is pretty basic, filled with your classical Korean staples. I ordered a mushroom and beef soondubu jjigae which came with a bowl of rice, and of course it also came with the classic Korean side dishes. Then I also shared a Japchae, which was pretty tasty but a bit on the expensive side. \\n\\nThere is a note on the menu that says you can only have refills on the side dishes once and an extra bowl of rice is $2.50 if you are still needing more. \\n\\nOther reviewers are right that the service here can be a spotty if there is only one person. It took us awhile to get some tea, but when we did, we got a whole pitcher from the server so we were pretty much self sustaining after that. Besides that, the service was pretty friendly and did not have the bad experiences that other reviewers had. \\n\\nOverall, a good restaurant with pretty authentic food. I was recently on a trip to Korea so I was pretty particular about the quality of the food but I was surprisingly satisfied. If you are looking for a more traditional meal come here.

The wait was an hour or a little more, but we were informed when we showed that the wait would be about that long so no problem.  Good food, good service so all was well.\\n\\nThe second time, even longer wait as we got there around 1130 almost 2 hours! And the service was mediocre at best, food was still good. \\n\\nThe third time we arrived right before closing the brunch..215 and we were seated very quickly, all food was still available and hot so we dug in and as we were seated directly next to the bar our service was great. She refilled our drinks, sold us drinks in the first place and was friendly. She was rewarded fairly.\\n\\nThe fourth and final visit to Moonshine was an epic fail for restaurants. \\nWe got there at 11 and were the first visible people in line. We were told 45 minutes for a 2 top.  No problem as we were prepared for a wait, so we took a walk.  We returned a little more than 30 minutes later and the hostess told me \\"you haven't made much progress check back in another 30 minutes\\" as she gave me a pager.  So here we are with all these people outside who must have come after us and we watch as one by one they get sat.  I watched 2 other 2tops get sat ahead of us.  I was furious but I kept my cool.  After waiting a total of 1 hour now I went back to the hostess and informed her that I had been waiting an hour and she said she would get us sat right away.  One more 2 top was sat ahead of us and then finally after 1 1/2 hours we were sat in the back.  We were seated and were waiting to receive drinks (Water) and have our drink order taken. After 2-3 minutes another table was sat opposite of us, and the waiter came right out and went straight to their table.  He took the drink order and disappeared into the restaurant.  A minute later he is back and wandering around the section looking at drink refills I suppose and at this point it had been about 5 minutes we were sitting there waiting once again. So I asked him as he walked by what it took to get a drink order in and he gave a snotty nod as another server came around the corner.  Our server had finally arrived and he promptly took our drink order. All seemed like it was going to be ok...until....we left for our first return trip to the buffet....me and my girlfriend had both left our dirty silverware on the dirty plates to be removed and replaced with fresh silverware as is customary.  Well....when we came back the plates were gone...but the silverware had been taken off the plates and just laid back on the table..clearly soiled.  This happened each time we took a return trip, which is absolutely unsanitary. \\nThis was the last straw.

I sat at a high top table, with a couple right beside us, it's that community feel type dining. The ramen I ordered was great, a little more salt in the broth and to me it would have been perfect. The broth was rich, the pork shoulder cooked so that a fork could easily break apart the rich morsels of buttery meat, and the noodles are the thin kind; they weren't soft and mushy, they held their shape and texture well. The chilli fried eggs, were packed with flavour and although I only had a few bites off my husband's plate, I used the bread to soak up the flavours, and boy, was I glad I snuck a nibble!  Lastly, their dessert option, the clafoutis, is worth saving room for!  It had hot and bubbling sweet maple syrup on top of a hybrid pancake.  The sweet flavour was cut with the tart ligonberries, and finished off with  dollop of bourbon icecream. Each bite was heavenly!  The service was attentive, our waitress even ensured that our take out container wouldn't leak on our walk after brunch.

The beef in the Korrito was fantastic! Well seasoned with great flavor and texture.  My biggest pet peeve with multi-ingredient burritos is when the ingredients aren't blended.  Sadly, Hae-Paul's hit my nerve on this one.  I had many bites of just rice and tortilla.  Like I said, the bites of beef were heavenly.  The bites with hummus also rocked.  The bites of just rice . . .well, it's rice.  Next time I'll be getting the Bolgogi as it looked very delicious (and was, according to my friend). \\n\\nThe Korrito comes with a side choice.  I opted for the slaw.  The slaw is vinegar based, but the tartness of the vinegar is balanced by an end note that is earthy, bordering on smokey.  Very unique, light and delicious!\\n\\nOn the decor . . . . well, it appears to be a turnkey operation from the old Serenity Cafe (which I dined at way back when).  The counter, furniture, floor tiles, glass blocks on the entry - it all appears exactly the same.  The molding on the wall/baseboard even stops where Serenity's old soda machine used to be.\\n\\nAnyway, this dynamic duo definitely know how to prepare great tasting, unique food. With that foundation, I'm sure the place will grow into its own.  The space and operations do seem to be already evolving.  Together with the name change, they now have beer (craft beers!) and wine.  I was also told that they'll be open on some evenings now.  With those changes, I also hope the menu grows.\\n\\nBottom line - the food tastes great and I'll be back.

Not so much.  \\n\\nReluctantly, I opted for the Baked French Toast with Eggs and Bacon.  \\nI had high hopes for the French Toast, given the fact that they are a bakery, right?  I should have been clued in to the fact that they are not a bakery because when I walked in, I was not overwhelmed by the smell of freshly baked bread.  I don't know if Corner Bakery Caf√© makes their own breads or not, but by the lack of smell, and the baked goods on display, I'd guess not.\\n\\nThe only sign of a bakery was the few baked goods that they did have on display which consisted of some bagels and loaf of bread, both of which looked completely stale.  \\n\\nStill, I had high hopes for my French Toast.  It sure did look good, with the bubbly-looking top.  The eggs and bacon were fine, but the French Toast was hard and gummy.  Blech.  Not good at all.  The coffee was pretty bad too.

My breakfast was around $10, which is double what I usually pay for breakfast.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it was the fact that my friend and I came directly from a run, or what, but we both felt a weird vibe from the staff and the other patrons.

The atmosphere is wonderful and cute. It's relaxing and there's comfortable seating inside and sitting outside is nice where you can watch the cars go by. Parking isn't fun on a busy day if you're parking in the front. It can be difficult backing out. The cakes, cookies and other desserts are pretty good. I assume the ones making them make them for the cafe and probably sell them personally. They're excellent and moist. I've tried Summermoon's coffee near Dripping Springs at their food truck location. It wasn't great. The coffee tasted burned which means it was a dark roast but tasted so so burned. I used to think this was an excellent flavor because it was so strong. As I began to try all kind of cafes and coffees, I've learned what makes a good coffee and when you bring two different roasts to people, what they ultimately choose and it's rarely ever a dark roast and never a burnt taste. Still, people will choose a dark roast over the atmosphere. I chose their cold mocha drink and was asked how many shots, 3 or 4. I chose three since I was told that was the norm. I sat down and waited. I noticed they have a changing table in the bathroom which is excellent. Parents do not have to leave and change their kids in the car. So glad. The aqua paint on the wall is very inviting. The employees are very sweet and they offer bags of coffee to buy as well. \\nMy coffee was ready and I tasted a lot of sweetness to it. I was glad that I didn't notice a Hershey's syrup taste, not that they use it. I'm so glad since every time I'm near the Alamo and ask for a mocha coffee, I'm given a coffee that tastes like they dumped syrup into it. This was different. I drank it anyway as I needed some caffeine to get through the day. \\nI think I'll be back for the atmosphere but I do hope I can find a coffee of theirs that doesn't taste this way and instead has a full coffee taste like Newman's Own by Green Mountain. That is a rich and strong coffee flavor or Lula Savannah's You can buy online or the Sugar Land Blend only found in Sugar Land with its roasted coconut. If you don't mind that dark coffee flavor, Summermoon is great. If you do, buy something else off the menu. I think their cool thing is that they say they roast with an open flame.

Cafe Luna is nestled in Cambridge in a very busy area near public transp. but still maintains its charm and uniqueness. They have an outdoor patio seating area, as well as a full indoor seating area, both of which were jammed on this warm summer Sunday. \\n\\nWe put our name in and were told an hour, but to come back in 45 min. as tables generally open up quickly. We did as instructed, and came back to a wonderful patio seat outside. We were greeted by a very warm and welcoming man, who we later found out was the owner. He had to be the most wonderful owner/server I've ever encountered. He happily answered all of our questions then took us through the menu suggesting not only Luna favorites, but his own personal picks. The fact that he asked me as I first sat down if my T-shirt was a Johnny Cupcakes shirt, also impressed me!\\n\\nHe gave us complimentary homemade buttermilk biscuits, served with homemade honey butter from VT. These were such a treat, all because as he put it, we were the nicest people he helped all day. We then ordered brunch, consisting of Lobster eggs benedict, and steak and lobster eggs benedict. My god, not only were we so stuffed and satisfied, but truthfully no words can aptly describe just how tasty these were. The lobster and streak were prepared to perfection, and the homemade hollandaise was one of a kind. He even let us know his wife does all the cooking and is a perfectionist. Many compliments sent to her!\\n\\nI'll preface the end by reiterating how stuffed we were, and yet we had already pre-ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with fresh berries for a dessert treat. These pancakes were outstanding, and even in splitting them were so much for the two of us, but we wiped our plates clean. As if we didn't exude a thanksgiving style full look already, the owner came back once more to ask if we had any room left, as he had other ideas in store for us and planned to keep giving us more food! While we were extremely thankful, we had to stop there or may have needed to be rolled home. \\n\\nAll in all this place is a gem, and if you go there, make sure you try some form of the lobster brunch dishes, you will not be disappointed! We will def. be going back! \\n\\nThanks again Matt, the food and experience were fantastic."},{"name":"Lisa's Family Pizzeria","address":"2312 Main St","city":"Tewksbury","stars":"4","text":"I stopped for a bite to eat at Lisa's Family Pizzeria in Tewksbury  (former Bianca's Roast Beef & Seafood) on my way back up Route 38 towards Lowell.

Based on the Yelp reviews, we were expecting a fabulous italian meal but unfortunately walked away very disappointed and rather queasy.\\n\\nThe kitschy decor and stereotypical italian music didn't do much to set the stage, but dinner started off well with one of their salads and a split of proseco.  Partly through the salad we ordered our entrees and a bottle of red to go with dinner.\\n\\nThe front of the menu states that everything is hand prepared and to please leave time for dishes to come out.  Given that statement, you can imagine my surprise when our pasta dishes came out very quickly after we placed the order and before we were even finished with the appetizer and proseco.\\n\\nTiming was only the beginning, unfortunately neither dish met expectations.  My gnocchi was hard in the middle, and the sauce was incredible underwhelming - almost like it was previously frozen.  My girlfriends ravioli also tasted remarkably store bought, and the accompanying tomato sauce did not do it an favors.  I rarely send back food when eating out but my meal was so bad I could not eat it.  Our server was nice about it and offered to exchange my meal for something else, but since my girlfriends was no better than mine I decided to cut my losses and just have another salad.\\n\\nNet-net we ended dinner far sooner than expected with 3/4 of a bottle red wine and no decent food to go with it.  We felt rushed the whole evening and to cap it all off both of us wound up feeling sick a few minutes after we left.  I'm really sad that dinner here ruined the only Saturday night we had in such a beautiful city.\\n\\nThere are a ton of fantastic restaurants in Portland as we discovered the next day.  Do yourself a favor and go to one of them instead."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I just drank at Shigezo, I didn't have a meal there.  But, I had a nice time nonetheless.  After dinner one night we were out looking for a bar near our hotel, the Heathman.  Well, in this particular area of downtown, there's not a ton of bars open after 10.  We happened upon Shigezo and told the hostess we wanted to drink but weren't eating.  She invited us to sit at a small bar that was kind of separated from the rest of the restaurant.  There were maybe 8 seats at the bar, and it had a projection TV showing a baseball game.\\n\\nThere wasn't a permanent bartender at the bar, which was understandable given its size.  But, we never went wanting for a refill.  The bartender serving us was super friendly, as she was cleaning up for the night (they close at 11), she talked TV and movies and whatnot with us.  She was also very quick with the water refills.  We had fantastic service during the hour or so we were at Shigezo.\\n\\nI had one of the house cocktails and we ordered a bottle of wine.  They didn't have a huge non-sake selection of wine and they were cheap.  We had an Oregon pinot noir and paid $36 for the bottle.  It certainly wasn't a great bottle of wine, but it was well worth $36.  It is a cozy space, but comfortable.  We had a great time and I would return for dinner."},{"name":"Taste of Peru","address":"9521 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 117 A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We are tourists visiting from Chicago and tasted Peru food for the first time, it was amazing!

With so many other great restaurants in PDX, this crew is moving on."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Crowded spot that is clearly not hurting for business. However, this seems to have sadly given some of the staff members a sense of hubris that resulted in a less than delightful experience. Placing orders for drinks was quite the battle with our server (Jeff or was it James - very tall Caucasian guy)\\n\\nDrink Order 1: French 75 with muddled cucumber \\n\\nServer \\"I could do that but that would be weird... the cucumber\\". Sure buddy it is so incredibly odd which is why low level joints like the Mandarin Oriental (LV) carries them on their menu. Next, your taste profile of what is acceptable doesn't govern the rest of the universe. \\n\\nDrink Order 2: Old Fashioned w/ Maraschino cherries with instructions to use Knob Creek for the bourbon. \\n\\nServer \\"We don't carry Maraschino cherries and don't stock Knob Creek either. Why don't you try the drink in its original form instead. I think you will like it\\" and proceeds to write down that as an order when I indicate no I would prefer it the way I ordered. He walks away muttering something about rye as opposed to using bourbon. Dear Lord - ordering drinks should not be so hard!! Any other life choices of mine you care to question you all knowing sage/oracle of ICOB?\\n\\nDrink Order 3: Someone in our party tried to order a vodka drink and asks for Grey Goose and the Oracle of Liquor strikes again. \\"We don't carry Grey Goose. Instead we support some local niche brand of Vodka\\". I was curious and asked why they don't stock some of the more high end liquors. Response \\"Who says they are high end?\\" Then points to the crowded restaurant \\"Frankly we don't have to carry them because we have enough business\\". Wonderful. \\n\\nOrder a drink at the bar and the bartender would turn away before I could even fully complete my order. Yes some people would like something more in their drink than just the standard Gin & Tonic. So next time listen till I indicate I am done ordering as opposed to when you decide and serving me a drink with half the ingredients I had in mind. \\n\\nWhile contemplating the Salmon entree I ask if they used farmed or wild salmon. Response \\"Do you know how expensive wild salmon is!?\\" Proceeds to tell me even though their Salmon is farmed it is done so using sustainable methods and acts like Wild Salmon in an absolute rarity in the high end restaurant scene. Someone else in our party orders the Salmon and it is served borderline rare. Next time how about saying something like \\"The chef recommends it still flapping. How would you the paying customer prefer it?\\"\\n\\nTo be fair, the saving grace was the food. The oysters were good. The crab cake was exceptional and the lobster roe noodles was rather good. Without the quirks of our server that came across as arrogance and sometimes just plain ignorance this place would have garnered 4 stars. However, based on my experience I am forced to give it a 3 and is not on my immediate repeat / hit list till they get off their high horse and retrain some of the servers. The decor is nice but the acoustics means shouting to be heard."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"If you are going to eat Thai food anywhere else in Vancouver, stop!

We were looking for someplace to eat in Dunwoody and I turned to Yelp for suggestions. \\n\\nAgain, as other reviewers mention the wait for a table in an 1/2 empty restaurant was about 45 minutes. We were not warned that if we didn't place our order immediately after seating we'd be in for another 45 minute wait. Seriously, we looked up and there wasn't a single employee in the entire place. I was the lucky person that got the blame because I choice the restaurant. \\n\\nWe started with Chicken Satay, I guess it was good. We were so hungry that I don't remember much other than the sounds of chewing.  I had the Bun with beef and all I can do is yell YUMMO! Now I understand why you go back, the food is incredible. I had a taste of the Co'm with salmon and that was excellent also. \\n\\nI'm not sure how to even end this because the experience was insane. The wait is ridiculous, all of the employees completely disappear and just when you've chewed all of the ice in your glass...they appear with the most wonderfully prepared dishes. The smells are unique and curious, the seasoning combinations have your taste buds doing a gig and your stomach has relaxed with the arrival of these tasty morsel. Curiously, our waiter was all over us after we got the food. After the first few bites, he came by with water and asked us how it was (I swear with a smug smile), all of the things we planned to say were gone...only thing left were happy smiles. I'm not sure if I was drugged or it's mind control but I want to go there every week, complain about the long wait and eat scrumptious food.
