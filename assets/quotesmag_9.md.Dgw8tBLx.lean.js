If it had a better memory, we wouldn't go back.\\n\\nWhereas the service and environment are good, the food is bleh and the prices are excessive.\\n\\nfood: The signature dish is an approx. 2 foot diameter, thin, crepe-like pancake and it is quite tasty.  You can choose from a large variety of toppings which will be placed in the center of the pancake.  \\n\\nHowever, I've tried some other things on the menu and was quite disappointed: the apple-sauce french toast looks exactly like the photo, except the scale is off--what you get is MUCH smaller than what the photo shows.  And as french toast goes, it gets a 'meh' from me.  \\n\\nOne point I have to emphasize is do not order the turkey bacon!  De Dutch doesn't have regular bacon, so your alternatives are canadian bacon or turkey bacon.  the last time I was there I made the worst decision of my breakfasting life by ordering the turkey bacon -- it was the most tasteless, disgusting, artificial meat product I've ever put in my mouth.  Seriously, tofu bacon tastes better than that crap.\\n\\nThe coffee also get's a solid 'meh' from me as well.\\n\\nService: the staff are nice and prompt, and I couldn't ask for more.\\n\\nEnvironment: nice little restaurant with a couple oddities. First, you have to walk through the kitchen area to get to the bathroom; that left me wondering if any health regulations were being broken..?  Second, if you sit against the wall and you're over 5' 4\\", watch your head -- there's all these pictures and things hanging on the wall that are just waiting to poke you in the head!\\n\\nPrice: this was by far the most disappointing aspect of De Dutch -- items are way over priced.  Yeah, it's a unique place, with unique food, and yeah it's Dutch so you can expect the Dutch thriftiness, but when the bill for one person hits $25 and nobody is really full and definitely not satiated, something's not right.\\n\\nreminder: stay away from the turkey bacon! ew!"},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I visited on a Thursday night.

It is very nice out there now that the heat won't kill you.\\n\\nWe had the same waiter that was slow on my last visit, which at first annoyed me (see: conference call to get to), but service was just fine this time around. Maybe it's because I cheated a little and let him know that I was in a hurry, but we were in and out in 40 minutes this time with dessert to go--perfect timing for a workday. Really it's a little bit of a shame that we couldn't linger, because the weather was so nice and the patio so pleasant. \\n\\nWe both ordered off of the three course lunch menu (mini appetizer of your choice, entree, mini-dessert--a good value at $12, but still kind of a lot for your average workday lunch) I got the brisket tostadas (again) and I somehow convinced my carnivorous mister to get the potato enchiladas and we split them. He liked the meat dish better (no surprise), but really liked the sauce on the enchiladas. For dessert we got the creme brulee and the chocolate mousse--the creme brulee is still my favorite!\\n\\nIt's still a little expensive for Mexican in my opinion, but I think I think I'll have to bring my family by the next time they're in town--especially if they are paying ;)"},{"name":"North Quarter Tavern","address":"861 N Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I never write reviews, But this place deserves it!, I just had the Best Braised Beef Tacos of my Life!!!, \\nI strongly recommend them!,\\nBartender was amazing!

The roll has giant pieces of warm buttery claw and tail meat, which goes perfectly with the toasted bread. I love it. It's not bad for $29. If you're already going to pay around $20 for a lobster roll, might as well pay a little more for a high quality one.\\n\\nI also got the lobster spaghetti, which they serve on Mondays. It's very good with generous pieces of lobster meat (tail and claw) in it. I was surprised at how good the sauce was - there's plenty of chunky tomatoes, and they definitely don't skimp by just giving you tons of pasta. The spaghetti was also well done, as it was the perfect chewiness. Usually I get really picky about pasta being undercooked, but this was great. However, if you're really going for the best bang for your buck, the lobster roll has more lobster meat than the spaghetti.\\n\\nMy friend and I also shared a clam chowder. The bowl is big! I don't know if one person can finish a bowl of clam chowder AND an entree. Anyhow, it was definitely different from what I'm used to. The chowder wasn't thick - a little bit watery - and besides the regular potatoes, there was also a turnip vegetable in it. The clams were very fresh, though. They were large and not overly salty, so you can tell they weren't canned. However, I don't know if the clam chowder is really my cup of tea, as it's very untraditional.\\n\\nGet here expecting to wait an hour. They'll take your phone number, though, so you can explore around the North End for a bit. Also, don't come at the end of the night thinking you'll be able to get a table because it's late.

When I found out they'd opened up a new restaurant, it was immediately on my radar.\\n\\nI must have driven by The Sound Table a dozen times before actually checking them out. Thank goodness, otherwise I'd probably had a difficult time finding it. The next obstacle is navigating their crazy parking lot. It is deceiving in that it looks like there are more parking spots available, but once you get inside you see how teeny tiny it truly is. But if you don't score parking here, you better have a bunch for quarters for the meters that line Edgewood Avenue.\\n\\nDon't you hate it when the waiter keeps coming by to get your order and you haven't even glanced at the menu? I always feel like I'm being a bad guest if I don't have an order by the second time a server comes by. Our server was pretty patient with us. On the third time we were finally ready to at least order some appetizers. We settled on the Curried chickpeas and the Arancini (fried rice balls coated with breadcrumbs). Our Arancini was scrumptious filled with black truffle, roasted garlic, and pecorino. But I think it was the Curried chickpeas that we both fell in love with.\\n\\nMoving onto dinner, I was clearly ready for some meat. The Chinese Pork Ribs caught our eyes as did the cheeseburger, add frites for 2 bucks more. Yes please. The ribs were nicely flavored; the sweet chili sauce a nice contrast to the slightly salty soy sauce and scallions. And the burger, medium just as we asked was and flavorful and juicy. \\n\\nOverall, I think the Sound Table is a fun destination for a group or couples. In comparison, Top FLR has a great cocktail list that is unique without going overboard.

Unfortunately for me, they are incredibly close to work and there's little you can do when you crave Chipotle. \\n\\nAs everyone has already mentioned, the parking is atrocious. I haven't actually counted the spots but there's probably 8 or 9 total. On a weekday evening the line itself will roll 10-12 deep, so there is no hope of parking. What I've done is park on the plaza next door (with the Bibibap) and run over while praying I don't get towed.\\n\\nThe staff here is by far the most inefficient of any Chipotle I've been in. The kitchen is constantly behind so they are always low on all the protein. This is why everyone complains of the miniscule scoops - they are just rationing until the cook can catch up. These are by far the smallest burrito bowls of any Chipotle I've been to.\\n\\nSomething is up with their rice process as well. The brown rice is usually always too dry and has little of the classic lime flavor Chipotle is known for.\\n\\nIf there is another Chipotle you can make it to, then go for it.

She had seen them featured on Chronicle and was interested in trying some of their fare.  Unfortunately, we didn't check their meal times before we went and when we showed up, we were given the brunch menu, which had only a limited selection.  A little disappointed by the menu (she didn't see anything on the brunch menu that she had seen on Chronicle), we asked our waitress if there was any way we'd be able to order from the dinner menu.  She said she would talk to the manager.  Minutes later, we were approached by the manager who, after we explained why we had chosen Lincoln Tavern, said he would speak with the chef to see if he would be able to accommodate our requests.  He was straight up with us and told us that some items on the menu he wouldn't be able to finagle, but there were other items that would be more likely to be available.  Thankfully, our selections were on the do-able list.  \\n\\nI was really impressed with the speed that our food came out.  My Lincoln Burger took a little longer because I requested it to be more on the side of medium well, but we had other delicious goodies to snack on while I waited, so we were happy.  I typically can't finish a meal, no matter the size.  But I had no problem finishing every last bite of my burger.  It was THAT good.  I think my favorite part of the burger was the caramelized french onions which gave the burger a really amazing flavor.  The truffled mac & cheese that my friend got was so rich and creamy, she had a hard time finishing it all, but made sure to have it packed up to bring home for later.\\n\\nI don't go into Southie very often.  Parking is hard to find and I typically stick to the suburbs.  But the exceptional & accommodating service that we received, combined with the delicious food gives this place 4 stars.  I'd also say that my experience here will definitely have me coming back.  There are so many other items on the menu that I'd like to try.  Oh yeah, and they take Discover!"},{"name":"Boston Foodie Tours","address":"","city":"Boston","stars":"5","text":"The best Foodie Tour we have ever been on. So much history about the area and FABULOUS food. Audrey (the founder and owner) was our tour guide. Her love of Boston and passion for food shine through as she shares stories and interacts with vendors and staff at various stops. After we met our tour started at the Boston Public Market where Audrey explained the food sold at the weekend outdoor market comes from the food warehouses that supply grocery stores. The food is what has not been sold to groceries and is now brought to the market at ridiculously low prices. $2 for blue berries or strawberries, 5 cloves of garlic for $1 or cactus pears 2 for $1. We then went inside where we sampled apple cider doughnuts from Red Apple Farm. We moved on to Taza Chocolate, Corner Stalk Farm, Botanical Springs and Q's Nuts where we sampled chocolate, Spikers Shrubs, flavored maple syrup and extraordinary roasted nuts. We then had the best Lobster Roll I ever had from Red's Best (went back there for a 2nd roll for dinner). Then we headed to The Union Oyster House for their famous clam chowder which did not disappoint. \\n\\nStuffed at that point we went to Little Italy where we had a piece of sub from Monica's Mercato. Then to the hidden treasures of the tour Bricco Salumeria and Pasta Shop where we sampled fresh mozzarella and nextdoor to Bricco Panetteria where we sampled Ciabatta with Proscuitto & Parmesan both made me wish I lived here to be able to buy weekly.

Keep in mind if your goal is to just eat, you must get a drink of some sort for HH. Yes, it can be something easy like Sprite, but theres a one drink minimum\\n-They have a fabulous looking buffet option for $42. It includes things like crab legs, and various Benedicts! Something think about for you brunchers. If you like bottomless mimosas, they have an option for $10 extra. \\n\\nWhen we got there, OH-EM-GEE, what a gorgeous view of Portland. You have almost 360 degree views. If you're lucky to snag a window table, you'll be treated to a beautiful view. Apparently it's always busy, however, we visited around noon on a Sunday and got a window seat right away. Score! Our first server seemed a little impatient with us, probably because she was almost finished with her shift. The second server was super nice and accommodating, wish I got her name. In any case, here's what we had: \\n\\n-Caesar Salad for $4.95. For the price, it was totally worth it. Romaine and radicchio, garlic herb croutons, lemon dijon vinaigrette and reggiano parmesan. It was quite a large salad and totally worth the price!\\n\\n-Oven Roasted Salmon Cakes for $7.95. Old Bay, green goddess dressing and fresh chives. The cakes were filled with salmon, not a lot of filler. Loved the sauce, super flavorful!\\n\\n-Grilled Steakhouse Cheeseburger for $6.95. Bulleit bourbon steak sauce, lettuce, tomato, mayo and bbq chips. GREAT DEAL once again! The chips were dusted with seasoning and seemed homemade. Great flavor from the burger :)\\n\\nOverall, it was a success. I had a relaxing time looking out to the city and enjoy good food. If you're ever in the area, come check them out.

The shrimp are small but you get plenty of them and they are seasoned just enough so its flavorful but you can still taste the freshness of the seafood - which I'd imagine is what most are looking for. The roll is perfectly grilled and has the right amount of butter - you'd be surprised how many places can mess that up, but they do it right.

The same omelette used to be on the menu as the Sunrise Omelette (mag fanatics correct me if I'm wrong about that), but they never fail to make it just the way it tasted back then. Nostalgia for the taste buds.  If you go for lunch the California Salad is always a win or if you'd rather have a sandwich get the Flamingo with turkey and/or bacon (home fries on the side of course).  Want dessert?

This place has over a thousand reviews...mostly bragging about the lobster roll.  Well, I have a different perspective...\\n\\nMy friend and I got on the list for the last table for the evening at 8 pm.  We had a 2 hour wait to be seated, which was expected.  It was crazy to see people being turned away for the evening, but I figured it was a good sign.  They take your cell number and call you when your table is ready, which is awesomely convenient.  To me, the wait is not an issue if the food meets expectations.\\n\\nSo, our table was ready and we started to dine.  I ordered the toasted lobster roll, hot and buttered.  My friend ordered the curried mussels and the clam chowder.  Maybe it was the fact that we were the last to arrive for the evening, but my lobster roll was very underwhelming.  There were some tender, delicous pieces of lobster, likely from the claws, but a good deal of the meat was chewy and lackluster.  The roll was soggy and untoasted and the butter did nothing to help.  For $26, I would expect more.  I noticed other patrons with soggy rolls left on their plates as well.\\n\\nNow, my friend's dishes, the chowder and mussels, were much tastier.  I absolutely loved the mussels, and our server brought bread to dip in the curried sauce.  Very tasty!  Her chowder was just okay to me, it seemed like a \\"broth\\" that was mostly cream and not much else.\\n\\nBut there is one most notable character missing from my review and that is...the oysters.  I ordered two Thacher Island oysters based on their description of being plump with a buttery finish.  Talk about amazing!  Those were the best I'd had and very memorable.  They were perfect with a squeeze of lemon.\\n\\nFor the price, the wait and the overall meal, I'd say this place ended up being average.

The cool thing here is that they take your cell phone number, rather than giving you a buzzer or making you wait within a holding cell like some restaurants, and allow you to mull about the city while you wait. \\nWe chose to hawk over the bar and within 20 minutes scored ourselves some seats. While waiting for the bar we were given prompt drink service and once we sat down we were pleasantly surprised by a full menu and an extremely friendly and helpful bartender. He gave some great recommendations for our dinner, helping with the pairing their unique and tasty menu items. It is an a la carte style where you pick and chose different items, rather than a set menu. I had the Pesto and Mint Scallops with peppers. My wife was also very pleased with her meal. Originally her meal came out \\"under cooked\\" or rare (how id prefer it lol) and they took it back and cooked it well done as she asked. To make up for this mistake, totally unnecessary to do so, they comped her meal! I wore a t shirt, shorts and flip flops and would ave been just as comfortable in a tie and jacket. We will definitely come back! Those who couldn't wait or were put off by the service must not get out much and should go back to McDonald's. Very cool, up scale but not stuffy place."},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Two friends and I came here awhile back for dinner around 6pm. We didn't have a reservation but the hostess was able to accommodate us. We ordered a round of drinks (a mocktail for one friend since she was pregnant at the time), a few different crostinis, and pastas. The dishes must change with the seasons because I no longer see them on the menu, but we ordered three different pasta dishes: one with uni, one with duck, and another with lobster. Although the food is on the pricier side, everything was delicious and you can taste the quality in each dish.\\n\\nFor a dinner for 3, we were there for over 3 hours.. not voluntarily or because we lost track of time, but I think they forgot about us and may not have put in our entree orders. Our drinks and crostinis were served promptly shortly after we arrived, but it took almost an hour before our entrees came. It seems that they realized they forgot to put in our orders because they sent over a complimentary dish of a tomato salad. We appreciated the gesture and the tomatoes were possibly the most delicious tomatoes I've ever tasted. The only down side that night was the service, but it's a minor detail in our overall experience."},{"name":"Wild Wood Bakehouse","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have been curious when passing by this place for a while and after dining next door we popped in to grab a couple cupcakes to go.\\n\\nIt's a cute bistro style storefront and they were also offering gluten free food options in addition to desserts.  the cupcakes are almost too pretty to eat but, I purchased a lemon cupcake with coconut on top and a reese's style one.  I also grabbed a latte to wash it down with and a lemon bar for good measure.\\n\\nThe cupcakes can be described in two words: decadent and flavorful.  I really enjoyed the lemon and coconut one because it wasn't too sweet but, my favorite part was the amazing frosting.  The peanuts and the chocolate drizzle on the reese's style one were a nice touch.  I couldn't tell the lemon bar was gluten free and it wasn't as good as my favorite lemon bar of all time but, it came in a close second.  My latte was decent and drinking temperature but, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for coffee.\\n\\nWhether you are gluten free or not this place delivers in satisfying your sweet tooth."},{"name":"Osteria Nino","address":"19 3rd Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm writing this review after visiting this  restaurant last Friday.  I got there 10 minutes before 8. I was told it was going to be a 20 minute wait. After a 35 minute wait, I asked the hostess if we would be seated soon. Five minutes later we were seated at a table by the bar. We waited 20 minutes before someone came by our table. I believe it was the manager who came over and told us, \\"They have forgotten  us\\".  He took our drinks orders and food order. We still hadn't been greeted by our server. Our appetizer was okay, we ordered the calamari. I ordered the fettuccine al ragu. The pasta was very under cooked. I was very disappointed, especially after waiting so long to be seated & to get service. Also our server never came over to check on us. The  only highlight was the manager,  after noticing my discontent, paid for our meal.

I ordered the Walter; a double meat, double cheese monster that was too big to get my gaping maw around on the first attempt. I had to nibble my way down the sides just to get a start on this behemoth. They were kind enough to offer to grill jalape√±os to kick it up a notch and I was in burger bliss. This is the best burger in Austin. They were also kind enough to offer a jalape√±o ranch cream sauce for the seasoned fries that put them over the top.

My friends and I came in on a Friday night and the place was packed.  But the manager Jacob was able to find us a place at the bar for a party of three.  We were so thankful to Jacob because I think the bar had the best seats in the restaurant.  I've heard from friends that the bartenders are amazing.  I was hoping to see Michael because of his rave reviews as a bartender.  But he was off that night and deservedly so.  For the evening, Miriam was our bartender.  She was pleasant and very welcoming.  Miriam made us an awesome drink called the Siesta.  I highly recommend the drink.  We ordered several appetizers:  the devils egg and steak tartare.  Both were flavorful and tasty.  For our entrees we ordered the Fried Chicken \\"Coq au Vin\\", Grilled Pork Chop, and Hanger Steak Au Poivre.  Our party of three shared the dishes and our conclusion -- they were all great.  The flavors were popping and the meat cooked to our specification/liking.  The only thing I could do without is the goat cheese with the steak.  The cheese smell and flavor were a bit overwhelming.  But that's my preference.  And for dessert, the dessert menu looked so appetizing.  But in the end, we opted for another round of Siestas -- liquid dessert!  Overall, I would highly recommend the Little Bird Bistro and would definitely be back.  Excellent staff and service.  Food and drinks were amazing."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Love the oysters and big thumb up to the lobster rooooooll!

It is cozy and well decorated, really romantic and great for a date night. It looks like a cozy little French country bistro, complete with mismatched china plates, extra firewood under the church pew benches, butcher block table to hold the wine selection. There are only a few tables, so I'd assume you have to call ahead if you'd like to get a reservation.\\n\\nI came into Boston for business, and arrived at Bondir early (about 5:45PM). I didn't have a reservation, but because I was so early and was only 1 person they graciously were able to accomodate me.\\n\\nWhen I was seated I received an amuse bouche. It was interesting, I think this is where the chef gets to be totally creative without repercussions. It was 2 very small breadsticks with 2 different accompaniments, dehydrated olives  (which were too salty) and a jellied olive oil square. Creative, but definitely not something that I'd need again.\\n\\nThen I was served 3 different types of bread that were all excellent. My favorite was a seaweed & squid ink, and they also had a hops & currant and some kind of wheat bread. After the bread came a small shot of soup. It was delicious--some kind of creamed celery and leek with candied walnuts as a garnish on top.\\n\\nAfter the amuse bouche, bread & soup (none of which I had to order) I got my main dish--a braised pork shoulder with mushrooms & caramelized root vegetables. It was delicious. The pork shoulder was very tender and melted in your mouth. The jus was really good--I just wish there was even more of it! The best part was that they fried up a piece of the pork skin so I had a delicious crispy pork skin to go with the super tender pork shoulder.\\n\\nI wasn't able to stay for desert (I needed to get going to where I was actually supposed to be for my business trip), but they looked amazing. I think the tasting menu would be the way to go, but I was definitely full after just the entree. Maybe if you go as a couple you could do one tasting menu and one a la cart entree.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend Bondir for a wonderful night out."},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We had basil pizza, olives and a salad.

I was pleasantly surprised by the (extremely tasty) cornbread that is brought to every table.  I ordered the Texas Scramble ($12.99?), which consists of scrambled eggs with cheese, peppers, and onions.  It comes with three sides; I chose home fries, bacon (our waitress said it was better than the sausage), and a biscuit with gravy.  It was all incredibly good, although I wasn't completely sure what to make of the gravy.  I feel compelled to comment on the amount of bacon that I was given; I had expected to receive two, maybe three strips of bacon.  Instead, I was given with a small nest of bacon.

Charlestown really has a serious dearth of quality restaurants, so I was especially excited when I learned about Grasshopper's opening. \\n\\nI suppose my hopes were a little too high when Katie B. and I decided to venture over the hill early last Saturday.  We arrived and there was a short wait, but nothing upsets people more than seeing empty tables that just need to be set when their tummies are grumbling.  We were patient knowing that they had recently opened and probably needed to be cut a little slack (others were not quite as forgiving and one couple left in a bit of a huff).  \\n\\nMy thing with dining out for breakfast (or really any meal really) is that I want something that I can't easily make myself.  Unfortunately, I really struggled to find something that I couldn't have made cheaper and, as it turns out, better at home.  They had the requisite breakfast foods but nothing particularly special (though I did like the Charlestown inspired names like Townie Toast).  I ended up with a Belgian waffle (I don't own a waffle iron) with honey butter and bananas which was fine, but not life-changing.  Their syrup is only 70% maple (my fear of fake syrup is the main reason why I usually go for savory breakfasts). But you know, I would pay more for the pure stuff, man.  I also ordered a side of home-fries, which were totally uninspired and dry (maybe I'll go for the loaded version if there's a next time).  Katie B. had 2 eggs (over-easy) with bacon and home-fries.  Except they forgot the bacon on the first try.  Eggs looked fine, but I sampled the bacon when it arrived and it wasn't anything special (a bit on the salty side). In fact I think we even left some on the plate - when does that EVER happen with bacon???\\n\\nMy favorite part was the honey butter which is something I have always loved.  The service was also very pleasant, albeit a bit disorganized.  And everything was spotless (as would be expected in a brand-new restaurant).\\n\\nBottom-line: I can forgive lapses in service (especially in a new restaurant) as long as the food is excellent, but I do not feel this is the case at Grasshopper. It would probably be a nice place to have a cup of coffee and a muffin on-the-go, but I don't think it's enough to encourage me to make another trek to the other side of the Monument anytime soon."},{"name":"American Craft","address":"1700 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Three words:  save your money.

The view is always amazing if you can get one of the prime booth seats (Frist come first serve). Parties of people to spread out and be really keen on scoping out seats.\\nI'm one of them people. So we arrived at 8:40ish and start walking around to get a prime booth. A couple left at around 8:45ish and I went *ka ka!* and swooped in to take a seat (yes, one have to be agile, fast and speedy for that prime real estate).\\nI text my hubs to come over and claim our territory.\\n\\nCustomer service: I guess the servers are used to guests coming in early to take advantage of HH, because they didn't care that we sat down early to wait for HH start time at 9pm. The server we had was nice and understanding. Our water is refilled constantly so that's a benefit to be close to the bar service area.\\n\\nKitchen service: we ordered our drinks (Basil Gimlet and Buffalo Trace Mahattan) and 3 dishes (spicy ahi tuna bowl, oven roasted salmon cakes, and spicy chili pork riblets). Ahi tuna came in first within 8 mins of ordering (that was too quick? Makes me wonder where it was supposed to go prior to our table?), then our drinks arrived at 11 mins mark, while the riblets and salmon cakes finished off at 15mins mark.\\n\\nPortion, price, taste: their food portions are decent for the price, but the taste is a bit lacking. The riblets are way too salty; the salmon cakes are not too bad, not great, just ok; the ahi tuna is good, but we can't really taste 'ahi' portion in the tuna. The HH cocktails are priced between $7-9. The basil gimlet is ok - more on the refreshing side. The hubs liked the Mahattan. It is more boozy tasting for him.\\n\\nOverall: Given that there is a lot of other HH's in Portland, I would come back every now and then for the great view and enjoy the mediocre food."},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"109 Chapel St","city":"Needham","stars":"3","text":"I used to love this place, but half the time I come here, the food is served room temperature.  \\n\\nMy waiter was chatting with the waitresses as my food sat and sat and sat.

We sat in the front dining room, which is a nice fairly modern-feeling room that has a 'dark' feel, kind of like a really nice bar. We sat on the wall that has a long continuous bench seat the entire length of the wall. We were seated with no want and immediately offered drinks.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were fine, tasty but nothing special. I wanted a lighter meal and decided to choose from the appetizer menu. I ordered the chicken in mole with cheese and the small guacamole. My wife ordered the mole enchiladas with cheese. When the waiter brought our drinks, he said it was happy hour on Sunday afternoons (don't know the hours) and everything on the appetizer menu was half-price. Bonus for me. The chicken in mole appetizer is a good-sized bowl of chicken covered with mole and melted cheese and comes with tortillas. It's a lot of food, basically enchiladas that haven't been put together. I wanted a lighter meal but I'm pretty sure I had as much food as my wife had with her enchiladas.\\n\\nThe mole is very good, second only to Fonda San Miguel in my opinion. My appetizer came with flour tortillas, which are very good and fresh. I prefer corn so I asked for some corn tortillas. I felt like they were pretty slow coming out. I realized why it took so long when the waiter brought them and told me they were freshly made. They are big, thick warm tortillas that will make you never want to eat any other kind again. The waiter said they're made by hand by a little old lady who's been doing them for 30 years. Awesome corn tortillas that you have to try!\\n\\nThe guacamole was served in a corn tortilla cup. It's the biggest 'small' sized guacamole I've ever had. It was very tasty and especially good dipped with the fresh corn tortillas. The biggest surprise to me was the ring of oil around the rim of the plate on which the guacamole was served. Almost by accident, I got some of the oil on a piece of tortilla. It has a great, peppery flavor that I wasn't expecting. I sopped it all up! The waiter says they call it the 'magic oil.' It's just olive oil with seasonings but it tastes great and was an unexpected and good complement to the guacamole.\\n\\nBecause it was happy hour, my meal was really inexpensive. My two appetizers were less than $8 and it turned out to be a full sized meal! My wife's mole enchiladas, however, were regular price at a fairly expensive $18. The normal prices are at the expensive end. If you're having an earlier dinner, go at happy hour and order appetizers. They have a lot of choices. The service was excellent, friendly and attentive. Overall, this was a great dinner."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I can't get over how dark it was downstairs. I braced myself so I didn't fall because I couldn't see where the last steps were.  I joked that I needed night vision goggles to find our party and everyone agreed how dark it was.  It was almost night-club dark, not romantic mood lighting.  Eventually your eyes adjust, but honestly, I'd like to see my food under brighter lights.\\n\\nAs for the food, I got the catfish dish and a couple side orders.  Both were good.  The catfish was tender and the mixed vegetable side dish was sweet and tasty.  I tried some of my friend's fritters and those were light and tasty.  Overall, the place has decent food, and I do hope they adjust the lights downstairs."},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"109 Chapel St","city":"Needham","stars":"3","text":"Amazing food, great service!

It's a really good deal for either breakfast or lunch, as obtaining similar quality will both cost you more and constitute a longer trip into Harvard Sq.  Both the Cambridge and Mt. Auburn St.  locations attract an eclectic mix of grad students and middle aged-locals, who linger endlessly, enjoying the free wireless and semi-quiet space to sink ever-deeper into solipsism.  The problem isn't the food  - its great.  The problem is the clientele.  Darwins makes the mistake of letting its staff indulge the clients, as they mentally debate the merits of lowfat or skim, while the line behind grows ever longer and impatient.  Really - its just a friggin' coffee, how important can the dairy component be?  Are you writing your dissertation on it?  Don't get me wrong - you get great service at Darwins, when you get it.  But getting it is the problem - you're likely to waste more than a few minutes while some middle-aged person wearing a sweater that looks like a barf mat informs the cashier that he can't fathom paying for his sandwich unless he knows the lettuce is organic.  People that annoying deserve to die early of cancer just on principle.        \\n\\nAbout fifteen years ago, when I lived in Philadelphia, I witnessed a similar phenomenon that has handled to much greater effect.  The Starbucks on Walnut St., near Rittenhouse Square, back when Starbucks in the East was very new and trendy, was frequented by over-privileged UPenn students and affluent locals.  Rather than let the clientele turn the coffee shop into a salon meant for the indulgence of the matching pearls and sweater types, the manager hired baristas who treated the customers roughly: \\"What size do you want that mocha f*cking frappucino in?\\"  Nothing like a Broad St. Bully to keep the traffic flowing smoothly!  The crazy thing was - Starbucks, like Darwins, was the best thing going for blocks, but the Starbucks had phenomenal sales turnover as it got 'em in and hustled 'em out efficiently, all with a little help from some foul-mouthed and irreverent baristas from South Philly.   I like Darwins a lot, I really do, but I'd love it if they'd just poach a few Dunkin' Donuts employees from Dorchester to keep the customers in line and get the place running smoothly."},{"name":"Demo's","address":"146 Lexington St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"I love going to Demos for lunch.

Very smooth and honestly, a generous portion. With our drinks, we were served mini biscuits with a cheddar aioli -  tasty, but they should have been served warm. We followed up with the small charcuterie board. What a lovely combination of every good taste - sweet, salty, savory. For entrees, I ordered the halibut and my fiance ordered the pot roast. He said the plate was a good portion, the meat was moist and tender and the vegetables were \\"roasted to perfection.\\" I loved the combo of the halibut with the fried clams and sweet corn. I couldn't even finish the dish - my portion was also very generous.\\n\\nHonestly, it was a great dining experience and we will be returning to try other dishes but will most likely repeat the charcuterie board.

The two of us were seated immediately and our server was prompt and helpful. After some of the stories I had been hearing, I was anticipating some sticker shock on the menu prices but found them to be quite fair. About $3-$4 for a taco? That's what Torchy's charges and you don't even have waiter service. Granted, the tacos at Garrido's are going to be much smaller, but filled with more interesting and higher quality ingredients.\\n\\nI had the Ahi tuna taco and a pork carnitas taco (it had grilled pineapple on it. Yum!). I really liked both of them and I added a side of black beans that were pureed which is kind of how I prefer them. \\n\\nFor about $40, we got 2 beers, an appetizer, 2 entrees and a dessert. That's pretty hard to do in downtown these days. I'm definitely a fan and will be back.\\n\\nThe only reason I am holding off on 5 stars is the location of our table. It was the one closest to the door and when the place got packed with people waiting for table, we felt a little claustrophobic having so many people standing around our table trying to get a drink at the bar."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Perfect hash browns.

Other than that, the aesthetic is obviously just pleasing a very surface-level hipster crowd (nothing against hipsters, it's just apparent what Propagation was trying to go for). \\n\\nStay away from this shop at all costs, ESPECIALLY if you're just browsing for furniture. They take chairs and tables very seriously, pricing some in ranges I can buy a whole room of furniture for. And they talk a lot about their clientele in New York and California; how about you focus on the city you're in rather than trying to please cities on opposite sides of the country as Orlando? If you're not going to focus on Orlando, get out of Orlando and live closer to your precious Californian clientele. \\n\\nTravis and Brittany, get a grip. You have a nice space in Orlando that many other businesses would love to use, but use it with Orlando in mind.

So don't be surprised when you get hit with a crazy expensive bill at the end of the meal - hey, someone has to pay for the entertainment.  The food is decent and  the sangria is strong (again, I think purposely so the shock of the cost of the meal doesn't hit you until the next day when you are sober).

The first time I tried it, I had a kind of pounded steak with some peas and rice, and it was really good. Today, I had some kind of soup with beef, pork, chicken, olives, potatoes, corn on the cob (IN the soup) and other stuff, including one of these \\"Mofongos\\" floating around in it, all in a brown stock, and it was simply fantastic. I was impressed. I have to imagine that if my Mother was Puerto Rican, her cooking would taste like this. \\nBoth times I visited, the Owner was in the kitchen doing the cooking, and he obviously knows what he's doing, and does it proudly.\\nThe food is made from high-quality ingredients, it's well-prepared, seasoned exactly right for anyone, not spicy, intense or weird, but still savory, extremely tasty and very interesting.\\nOnly a couple of things kept me from giving this place 5 stars: the speed of service and the price. The server was very friendly, nice and eager to provide a great dining experience, but didn't get in a hurry about anything. She didn't ignore me, she was just a little slow, and the place wasn't busy. But the food is worth the wait.\\nMy other issue is the price. The ingredients are pretty much everyday items, not like the dishes are full of crab, lobster, Kobe beef or other expensive ingredients, but your average plate is about fifteen dollars. My opinion is that it's overpriced by 25% to 30%. maybe there's a good reason of which I'm not aware, but I really think 9 or 10 bucks would be more like it.\\nTake it all around, it's a great place to eat, and I'll go back even if it's a little pricey and maybe a little slow.\\nI think they really are committed to serving quality food, which is, after all,  what a restaurant is all about, and that deserves at least 4 stars all day long."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely delightful.

We waited 15 minutes before anyone even took our name, so that was slightly annoying.\\n\\nAfter only waiting 30 minutes, we were seated but it took at waiter 10 minutes to even get to our table. The reason they didn't get 5 stars is because of customer service. Our server was a jerk. He wouldn't just take our order.

There was absolutely no room on the table because we sat in a tiny high top table in the middle of the restaurant. That was another thing I did not like.

I will be going back just for the wings. They were so great. We ordered the BuffaQ sauce. I would definitely recommend it. I ordered the 3 cheese burger with mayo and it was really great. The only complaint is that the bun was burnt and I ended up tearing most of the bottom part off. My boyfriend got a regular double cheese burger. He did not love his, but he could not get enough of the wings. He tried mine and said my burger was a lot better than his. \\n\\nOverall, the experience was good.

The Santorini has very strong flavors so mixing in the veggie moderates the overall experience. \\n\\nThe pizza was exceptional - crisp crust and think layers of toppings. Over the years their salads have improved over the prior iceberg lettuce offering - they now mix in some Romain. The salad flavors are typical of Greek pizza joints - very classic oil and vinegar with feta, red onion, ripe tomatoes and Greek olives. This is one of those foods if done right bring back the serendipity of first having such as a kid. Athen's certainly brings back the nostalgia.\\n\\nI would have given them 4 stars - call this a 3.5. The service and food were good, however getting at the restaurant at 9:15 (45 minutes before they closed at 10 PM) wasn't a great experience. I can understand that the staff wants to leave - however with a couple of still seated tables you would think they wouldn't make so much noise and turn up the ugly lights, especially in today's economy?

Here, I'll show you where it is...\\"\\n\\nSo emphatic was the rotund Faneuil Hall pub bouncer about  the quality of the lobster rolls at Neptune that he'd personally escorted us - cig still burning in hand - all the way to the edge of the throughway that faces off with the North End. He pointed out the entrance to Salem Street, the infamous culinary artery of the best Little Italy in the world. We started towards it.\\n\\n\\"GO...THEY TASTE LIKE A PAIR OF DOUBLE Ds!!!\\" he shouted after us. With this echoing endorsement, we went from walking to running towards the establishment despite the comment's general vulgarity and logical strangeness (just think of an analogical statement for a heterosexual female to make, and in reference to a lobster roll?!).\\n\\nThe compact ground floor space was lit up by soft-hued electric lights to evoke a grotto - an aesthetic standout in the midst of the more traditional decor of neighboring pasta and canoli houses. The paneled ceiling was like a giant bar of white chocolate, raised with ornate and antique patterns.\\n\\nSadly, the cozy scale inside (15-seat bar, 27-seat banquette) meant that there was no space at the inn for us. There were three of us and only two empty stools at the shiny bar, so my resourceful girlfriend located another stool in the back and dragged it forth. She was stopped by a server, who told her she couldn't just move furniture around as she pleased, and that even the bar spots were earmarked for the arrival of others. (On a President's Day Monday night at 8:30 p.m. at a no-reservations place?)\\n\\nThis resulted in my friend shrilling about the elitist bullshit of the place and the bitchiness of \\"that elitist bitch,\\" so her man and I quietly ushered her into Rabia's down the block. There, we sat deliberating over the strange lobster roll variations (involving toppings of bleu cheese and onion) and grumbling about the $24.95 price until the server covering the empty floor chirped that they were clear out of lobster rolls anyhow.\\n\\nBack to Neptune we went. This time, there were three seats at the bar. We asked a different server if it was okay to sit, and suddenly it was. Ordering was easy because it was only a matter of choosing between butter and mayonnaise dressings. \\n\\nHere, the price was $25 even. For someone who grew up in New England and has therefore scored plenty of snapping-fresh rolls in many points North for less than half the price, a QUARTER OF A HUNDRED BONES was a tough fare to choke down. But I did it anyway, recalling the bouncer's enthusiastic advertisement.\\n\\nOur rolls arrived quickly. A fair portion of butter-drizzled claw and tail meat - slightly too well done for my taste - was embedded in a fluffy but otherwise non-remarkable bun. It was good, but not arousingly so. After all, it's a G.D. LOBSTER ROLL.\\n\\nBetween our hard won (or bought) mouthfuls, we stared up at a chalkboard displaying an impressive variety of local and Pacific oysters with prices like 2 9/10...per shell. Still, my NYC price goggles easily had me considering a couple Kumamotos from Washington but I decided to save my dizzough for when I'm actually out in the Pacific Northwest.\\n\\nWe asked for the check, got it, and paid up. My card was charged twice, so we called the server back. She wasn't particularly apologetic and seemed more hassled, but promised that she'd fix the problem and that I wouldn't see two charges on my account. \\n\\n\\"Good, or else I'll be making a phone call,\\" I said obnoxiously, breaking into laughter with my friends...because what would a night in an Italian neighborhood in Boston be without empty threats? She turned around with a look on her face like she wished she could scratch my eyes out. \\n\\nAnyway, the moral of the story seems to be: If you want lobster rolls, go to Woodman's in Essex MA or to Jack's in Hampton Beach, NH or some shack in Maine (not NYC, which skimp on me no matter what) or anywhere in between. Or go to any Market Basket between Mass. and Maine in season, get some steamed ones and make your own. If you want seafood in Beantown, don't be above going to an Irish pub near Faneuil ($13-$15) or to Legal Seafoods (standard MP). \\n\\nIf you want special oysters, get closer to their beds, or hit up B&G for a more focused hunt.\\n\\nIf you want crowded old world nooks with alternately sassy or warm service from young girls or grandmas, THEN come to the North End, but note that pasta or pastries will provide a cheaper and more congruous experience.\\n\\nIn Neptune-land, a placid (i.e. NOT my girlfriend) out of towner might be wowed, and a gastro-snob with a bankroll to burn on accompaniments of fine wine without crying (reportedly: Bennifer Affleck, Flea, The Edge, Leo, Kelly Clarkson, JT) might be deliberately under radar.

Although by around 6:45 the place was filing up fast, so make reservations or arrive early people!  We were sitting within eye/earshot of the bar, and got to enjoy the antics of the bartender a bit too before it got really busy.\\n\\nOur server, Lorne, was very polite, professional, and friendly.  He only came to ask how things were through the appetizers and once again during the meal, which to me is perfect.  He kept drinks on the table discreetly and quickly, not interrupting our meal/conversation which is the way I like it, attentive, yet not intrusive.\\n\\nWe started out with the Beefsteak Tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and basil with the balsamic drizzle.  They were cut in THICK slabs and were very tasty and firm (3 servings total).  We were torn between appetizer choices and also tried the lobster ravioli which there were 4 in the appetizer, and more than enough to get a good taste for the both of us, and not get filled up too much.\\n\\nThe timing could not have been more spot on, as soon as we were finishing with our appetizers, the plates were cleared and our salads were set on the table. And let me tell you, those croissants are like little flaky pillows from heaven.  I have had bacon/honey mustard dressing before, but not like this.  This actually had less honey flavor and more of a true ground mustard bite to it, which I liked.\\n\\nBy the time we had finished our salads, our drinks had been refilled (I had a spicy bloody mary to start off as well, and it was mixed perfectly) and then the prime rib hit the table.\\n\\nMy friend chose the 16oz portion MR, I had the 10oz M, both with creamed spinach (which has an unusual spiciness to it I couldn't place that made me want to know sinct it was delicious).  Most of the time you get a little smattering of horseradish with prime rib, but this was served with au jus and it was cooked to perfection.  I think they may have been a bit happy on the cuts because mine seemed more like a 12 and his was more like an 18/20 because they were both HUGE.  I ate every last bit of mine (even the fatty parts people squirm over) and my friend could barely finish his.

From the reputation Le Coq au Vin has had in the past, I expected much, much more...and my family and I were sorely disappointed. \\n\\nFirst off, my dad is in a wheelchair, so getting in and out can pose a problem sometimes. Thankfully, there was a ramp to wheel him up, but the ramp was steep enough that both my mom and I (along with some help from my dad) had to work fairly hard to get him up to the top. It's not like he's some morbidly obese person, either.\\n\\nOnce inside, we were kindly greeted by the hostess who confirmed our reservation. We had let the restaurant know at the time of making the reservation that we would be celebrating my dad's 70th birthday. Nothing was mentioned by the hostess, nor was anything ever mentioned by the server - ever.  \\n\\nIn contrast, when we celebrated my birthday the night before at Seasons 52, a hand-written birthday card from the restaurant was ready and on the table at the time we sat down. The hostess even wished me a happy birthday, as did our server, and it was mentioned up front that a complimentary dessert would be offered for me at the end of the meal if I was interested. They even had a candle for me to blow out!\\n\\nAt Le Coq au Vin, not a peep was made. No mention, and certainly no dessert. Smart restaurants have impeccable customer service right down to the smaller details. They appreciate the business, they want to make sure you have a very enjoyable experience, and they certainly want you to come back and visit them again. Le Coq au Vin didn't seem to care if they had our business or not. \\n\\nAs for the food -- it was good, but nothing to rave about. My glass of Cabernet, was good until I got to the end and found myself gagging on a lot of sediment. I got the bottom of the bottle. Yuck! That's not acceptable at a restaurant trying to market itself as fine dining.\\n\\nAnd as for the ambiance, it reminded me of a French country bistro. It's not glamorous, it's not modern, but it has charm. On the other hand, for the prices they want to charge, and the reputation they'd like to hold onto, I'd expect them to step it up a bit more. For instance, in the restrooms, a Renusit solid air freshener and a plastic trash can are somethings I might expect at a Denny's. \\n\\nIt seems other patrons were also an accurate reflection of how this once popular restaurant has fallen since its heyday. Dressed in jeans, talking on the phone at the table, burping loudly...  Really? Don't get me wrong, this isn't the fault of the restaurant. However, if the restaurant stepped up its game more, patrons might feel a little more pressure to act with more appropriately.\\n\\nNext time we have an important celebration, we'll be going elsewhere."},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"4.5 stars - rounded up!\\n\\nIf there is a milkshake on a dinner menu, my husband will get it.

If you're looking for cutting-edge curation of million-dollar Monets and expensive experimental expressionism, go elsewhere.\\n\\nBut the CMA does have an important role, which is to provide art and inspiration with a local as well as international scope.  In addition to their many galleries covering a wide variety of styles and centuries, efforts like their Center for Creativity plant the seeds for future inspiration.  Yeah, that mission sometimes takes the form of visitors making twisty-tie art... but some of that twisty-tie art IS pretty impressive...\\n\\nWhile The Wexner Center for the Arts is a great and world-class alternative to the CMA, it sadly seems like the ONLY alternative to the CMA for art in Columbus.  As such the CMA crucially champions a wider variety of more traditional art with less turnover than the Wexner.

I stayed away and it was probably a good idea.\\n\\n9. Ice cream is absolutely awful. It tastes rubbery almost. The texture is confusing and unpleasant. Worst green tea ice cream I have ever had.\\n\\nBy the end of our Friday evening meal, we fully understood why their restaurant was only 1/4 full. Awfully bland and unfresh food. We spent $80 including tip for the most unsatisfying meal I have ever had.\\n\\nIf I had to find reasons for the 1 star, it would be the kind staff. They cleared our plates and refilled our drinks well. But when they were not clearing dishes, they stood on the the side or crouched over the ground in pure boredom. They clearly did not want to be there.\\n\\nInvest your $$$ at a better sushi buffet. I recommend takusan in Brookline if you are looking for fresh sushi and raw bar (they have the best crab legs.. so well seasoned). If you are more into the hot food aspect, just make the trip to Minado in natick. It would be worth your time and money. \\n\\nIm confused why some people gave more than 3 stars to this place. Either Maki maki is not consistent with its food/cooks or most people who have reviewed this place and gave 3+ stars dont know good sushi or food in general. Never coming back here again."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The burgers here truly are great:  well seasoned, well decorated, and huge!  All burgers on the menu have a 3/4 pound patty.  And since the prices range around $10, it is a good idea to bring a friend and split one along with a side of fries.  Alone I attempted the bleu cheese burger, no mayo.  The taste is good enough that I ate way more burger than I would normally think possible.  No mayo was necessary because for this selection the patty is blanketed in bleu and mozzarella cheese.  A truly divine heart attack on a plate...  \\n\\nSome things not to do at Thurm's: don't bring a family, bring a large group, or show up very hungry.  Seating is very limited and wait times for a table can easily run over an hour.  The waiting area is somewhat unpleasant and cluttered, and the eating area is cramped and dark (maybe you like this kind of atmosphere, but I don't).  The Thurman Caf√© is really a rustic bar that happens to serve great burgers.\\n\\nAfter getting seated, you have to wait more for your order to be taken and meal to be prepared.  I avoided this whole trial and ordered take-out, and had my burger within 20 minutes of arriving.  Weather permitting you can enjoy your burger in the beautiful and historic Schiller Park one block to the north.  If it's summer you might catch an outdoor Shakespeare production by the Actor's Theatre (the show is free but donations are encouraged)."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Excellent snow crab roll and the clam chowder was to die for!!!!!

At least 8 sandwich assemblers, two order takers, and three drivers ready-to-go (no idea how many were on-the-road)\\n+ Courteous service.  As compared to the JJ's on Red River, which can have surly if not downright unpleasant order takers if you don't walk in chanting the menu mantra, these guys were pretty laid back.\\n+ Relatively fast.  I didn't \\"freak\\" per their slogan, but I was in and out in under 5 minutes during the lunch hour, and they were busy as ants with orders.\\n+ Clean.  Even though it was the peak of the lunch hour, the restaurant seemed well-kept and spotless.\\n+ As is the Jimmy John's hallmark, always fantastic French bread.\\n\\nCons:\\n- This shopping center sucks major goat balls when it comes to parking, and Jimmy only has two dedicated parking spaces.  Yes, I know they have complimentary valet parking, but it is antithetical to go to Jimmy John's and have your car valet parked.  Not entirely JJ's fault that the parking situation is egregious, but figuring out that angle when you're an in-and-out fast food franchise is part of the business decision when choosing location, location, location.  Minus 1 star.\\n- The sandwiches (both Slims) longed to channel Clara Peller.  This is the first time I ordered Slims at any JJ's location (\\"slims\\" have no veggies or sauce) and certainly the first time at this store, but the meat between the buns did not satisfy.  My typical experience is at the San Marcos location and the sandwiches are usually plump, albeit fully dressed.  It was enough of a disappointment to demerit another star .  The sandwiches didn't really seem worth $3.50 each, and I honestly get more value from the equivalent $4.00 Skinny at Potbelly.\\n\\nWill I be back?  Yes, if in the area, but I won't go out of my way to get here.  Too bad their service-delivery area doesn't extend far enough South to reach me.

The restaurant was pretty quiet and we had our choice of where to be seated. The bar area was somewhat dark and chic, and the side room was more of a dining room feel. We chose to sit at the \\"bar\\" in front of the wood burning grill, so we could watch the chefs making the pizzas, which was quite entertaining. The service and staff were extremely friendly and helped us to feel comfortable immediatly. There is an extensive wine list, with wine by the glass, carafe and bottle. We ended up ordering a carafe of chianti, per the servers recommendation, and it was fruity and slightly dry- just the way I enjoy it. The menu is a modern italian style farm to table vibe. They showcase the local farms where they source their ingredients on a mural on the wall as well as on the menu. This is a nice touch. To start, we ordered the Beet Salad ($12), which was roasted purple and golden beets, topped with frisee, goat cheese and hazelnuts, and drizzled in balsamic. This salad was perfection. There was the perfect amount of each ingredient and the right variety of textures and consistencies throughout the salad. It was so good, that my husband, even though he claims he doesn't like beets, enjoyed it! We also ordered the Warm Goat Cheese Salad ($12), which was lightly breaded and herbed, warm goat cheese served on a bed of garden lettuces and drizzled with balsamic. The goat cheese was incredible, but the rest of the salad was a bit boring. It would have been delicious to have the warm goat cheese on the beet salad! Since we were sitting at the \\"pizza bar\\", it was only fitting that we ordered a pizza (although the pastas and other entrees all sounded delicious). They have a variety of craft - type pizzas, and we went with the Melanzana Pizza ($13), which was a nice size pizza for two to share (after having a salad). The pizza had a slightly sweet sauce, mozarella and pecorino cheese, and then topped with eggplant and red onion. It was fun watching the pizza chef make our pizza and watching it cook in the wood burning oven. The pizza was good, and the cheese was gooey, the way I enjoy it. The eggplant was crispy, and not watery as it can sometimes be on a pizza. Overall, it was a nice meal and I'd like to come back and try some of the pastas and other entrees."},{"name":"DEE DEE","address":"4204 Manchaca Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Finally got to try this place.

It was Labor Day and the restaurant I had planned to go, closed for the holiday when I arrived.  I got on yelp and feared that many restaurant would be closed for the the holiday.  I found that PCG had a happy hour for Labor Day.  Without calling,I started my car to PCG.  It was only 1 mile from where I was so it was a short drive.  \\n\\nWhen I turned into the basement garage of the building I saw PCG logo.  and on the logo it says that PCG is on the 30th floor!  We were like, it must be a fancy restaurant to be on the 30th floor.  Then were were joking it can't be, fancy restaurant don't have happy hour...lol...We started to wondered if there would be a dress code because we were all in jeans and sandles.  \\n\\nSo we headed up on the elevator.  when we entered the restaurant, yup it was a fancy restaurant.  The light was very dim. So make sure to watch your steps.  The first thing we smelled was sushi.  that was interesting we thought.   we were seated on the bar side because it offered both happy hour and regular menu.  The dining room only offered regular menu.  \\n\\nIt had a great view of the city.  too bad all the window seats were occupied.  We took a nearby booth where we still could see the some view.  Then we noticed there was a bottle of soy sauce on the table.  hmmmm...thats interesting..lol...Then there was eighties music playing. hmmmm....thats interesting...lol. it just felt kinda interesting with all these things put together which was not what I imagined a fancy restaurant would be.  \\n\\nSo were ordered ordered sushi roll, salmon cake, and salad from the happy hour menu and top sirloin and pork tenderloin  from the regular menu.  OMG, that pork tenderloin was so amazing! it was tender and juicy and very flavorful, supper yummy.  It did not have the texture of pork at all.  I would almost describe it as smooth and melts in your mouth.  Aweh.....just can't get over how good it was.  \\n\\nNow the  top sirloin steak was another story.  It was a disaster.  The outside  was so dried and hard that I had to battle the piece of meat with my steak knife.  It felt like I have the kill the poor animal a second time.  It was so tough, I almost wanted my waitress to bring me a hand saw.  Needless to say, I abandon the steak.  \\n\\nNow I am sober writing this review, I should of asked them to replace my steak last night, it cost me $35.  I guess I was happy on my margirita and mojito drink....lol...  overall, my friends and I had a blast at the restaurant.  The service was awesome.  \\n\\nwhen we headed to our car, my friend said that she is on a mission to look for a fancy restaurant on the 30th floor, that serves amazing pork, smells like sushi, offers happy hour, and plays eighties music back home in San Francisco.,,,lol"},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"From a dining experience, the food and service is just plain and simply not good.

When our entrees showed up, we reminded her about the app.  She went back to check and then it showed up a few mins later (at which point we didn't even want it).  Getting back to the entrees, I ordered the chicken sandwich with French fries and sauce on side.  When it came out, there were no fries, salad instead, and sauce was not on the side.  My boyfriend ordered fried chicken and he was not impressed at all. He said it tasted frozen then thawed.

We ordered the 3 bruschetti, which are three different toppings on bruschetti.  All were delectable and gone in a few minutes, but the garlic-carrot topping was my fave - it reminds me of a Turkish dish.  We also ordered pasta.  The Carbonara pasta seemed to lack the right proportions of its classic ingredients, particularly eggs - and as such came off a bit dry.  I could taste neither the type of cheese nor the bite of the pepper.  The traditional guanciale was replaced by bacon, it seemed, which was a tad over cooked (considering guanciale is typically more juicy and fatty when in this dish).  However, the pasta was a stand out.  This pasta itself (probably a fresh-egg fettucine) is some of the best that I've had in Austin in a while.  For our other pasta we tried, the Cacio e Pepe, we ordered an addition of a beef / pork meatball; it had a loose form and juiciness, filled with fresh green herbs.  It seemed homemade and fresh.  All in all, I feel that we'll be coming back and going through more of their menu, because I suspect the other reviewers are right and there are a lot of excellent choices here.  However, since I'm a bit of a Carbonara snob and that's what I ordered, I've based most of my present rating on it.

I was shocked at just how good it really was.  The environment was a bit cheesy, but colorful and trendy.  The bread was soooo soft I have never seen or tasted anything like it.  It was sprinkled with onion flakes...ahhh, so good!  For my lunch I ordered a Mediterranean-type salad, which was a large portion of crisp lettuce, deliciously marinated grilled chicken, carrots, celery, olives, feta cheese, etc.  I exchanged the low-calorie zinfinndel dressing for the lemon one that came with it.  \\n\\nI would definitely go back for the fresh food and amazing bread."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great little breakfast spot!!

You definitely get what you pay for and more as the portions are very generous. \\n\\nI typically get the pulled pork plate or brisket plate, which come with the typical BBQ sides. Cornbread is not worth writing home about and the potato salad is pretty bland, could use some pepper or any sort of spices. I usually skimp on eating the sides and focus on the meat as it is flavored very nicely. Something worth trying, if you are really hungry, is the corn fritters and asking for whip cream on the side...

Our service was prompt and attentive and our server really seemed to know what he was talking about.  Evidently Food 101 introduced their summer menu a few weeks ago which includes a nice variety of some of their year-round favorites plus some seasonal additions.  I had the ravioli with mushrooms, asparagus and lemon which was delicious.  It was on the lighter side but  just what I wanted.  I also had a hearts of romaine salad which is their interpretation of a Caesar salad and quite tasty.  \\n\\nWhile we did not indulge in dessert, I'm sure it would be good.

I think you might need to check it out!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Before I discuss the food, I would like to address the individuals who complain about waiting too long and the size of the restaurant. Nothing worth having in life comes easily, unless you are a spoiled brat who is used to getting everything you want instantly. \\nSmall, local eateries are difficult to maintain in busy, expensive cities like Boston, and for this establishment to uphold a standard of quality for so long without compromising their culinary integrity is notable. \\nSo go early, plan ahead, and find something to occupy yourselves with, KNOWING that you will have to wait. Don't be one of those people who stands awkwardly gawking at others while they dine. \\n\\nThat said, the food is excellent. The Lobster Roll is of course, as many have said before me, amazing. But rarely have I found a Northern Spot that accurately prepares a southern dish like Shrimp&Grits, and rivals Southern cooking! (I lived in the South for 15 years and my Man is from SC). Delicious, just the right amount of spice, and a whole lot of shrimp! Seriously. It's rare when eating a shrimp dish that when you get down to the last bites, you have shrimp left. Even with me sneaking them off his plate, he had a large last shrimpy bite!\\n\\nWe tried 11 different types of oysters, and found the written descriptions to be accurate and enticing. We found we enjoyed them best with just a tiny squeeze of lemon, as they are ridiculously fresh, but to each his own. The mignonette is nice and the cocktail sauce had plenty of spice. \\n\\nHowever, despite the awesome food, the BEST part of our experience was the service. Although, as it was our first time at Neptune's, getting our name in with the very busy hostess (poor thing, what a tough job) at first was a bit confusing, we ended up with seats at the bar which was awesome, as our bartendress Julie turned out to really make our dinner more of an enjoyable meal. She has a great sense of humour, honest recommendations, and, as it was my birthday, sent out a few extra oysters on the house.. totally unexpected kindness but much appreciated and really sweet! \\n\\nI have worked in the service industry since I was 14, and this was an overall exceptional experience. If you want to be coddled, go find an overpriced place with white tablecloths where they crumb your table in between courses. If you want great food, an authentic, feel-good-busy atmosphere, and stellar service, and some of the freshest damn seafood I've ever had, come to Neptunes.

Nice variety that you chose on a sheet that describe the location where it is harvested and the taste profile - similar to a sushi sheet. One advise, they do not list Uni on the sheet or on their menu board. You should peek at the window display area where the oysters are prepped and look for the sea urchin. Must have this - really tasty. All of this is not cheap. $2 .50 and up per oyster and other item - crab claws, shrimp, etc.\\n\\nAnother must is the Neptune Caesar. Great salad with marinated anchovies and grated cheese. Lobster roll (butter) was good and must also be ordered.\\n\\nStaff is great and place is nice.

We walked in, gave our names, and were seated immediately, while a party of equal size who came in without reservations had to wait a few minutes while the staff prepared a table for them.\\n\\nWe decided to take advantage of their Dine Originals menu, but also ordered the spicy chickpea hummus with flatbread and vegetables from the Tapas menu.\\n\\nI've been in restaurants that would take the tapas label as an excuse to give out a relatively small plate, yet still charge a hefty price. Not Barcelona - our appetizer was easily two, possibly three cups worth of tasty goodness, with a chunky texture that worked perfectly with the provided dipping vegetables and crispy flatbread.\\n\\nComplimentary bread with a mix of olive oil, dried tomatoes, and chiles made a nice counterpoint to the richness of the hummus, and it was with a mixture of regret and anticipation that we admitted we couldn't finish the hummus if we wanted to have room for lunch (though our server was kind enough to box it up, and I look forward to assaulting the leftovers tomorrow.)\\n\\nWith the Dine Originals menu, you had a choice of several sandwiches and a side item - I had to go with the house Chorizo, with the link split and grilled to crispy, spicy goodness, topped with caramelized onions, sliced peppers, and a slice of melted manchego cheese, and a side of Patatas Bravas.\\n\\nThe patatas were a taste of Spain in each bite of crispy potato wedges, with a gentle spiciness accented by Spanish paprika and a garlic & tomato aioli.\\n\\nThe sandwich itself was satisfyingly spicy, with the thick crusty bread doing a good job of countering the soft melted cheese and the chorizo's residual grease, and despite looking a bit small when you first see it on the plate, it left me sated and happy without feeling overstuffed - the perfect sensation.\\n\\nThe service was excellent, with our server taking care of us each step of the way, and the bar area where we were seated is a nice combination of old brick and dark wood against more modern artwork and beautiful glass.

I made a reservation very early in the day for an outside table at 7pm. We arrived a bit before 7 and it took them until 7:35pm to seat us. Seriously?! To their credit, they had tables inside, but the reservation was specifically for outside. Once they took us outside we also saw they had a ton of 4-tops open. For customer service they really should have seated us at a 4-top instead of making us wait 35 minutes. \\n\\nIt took what seemed like a long time for a server to acknowledge us and take our order. Once the order was taken, the timing for the food was off. Main courses came out about 4 minutes after the appetizers so we had to stack plates on our little table. \\n\\nFor appetizers my husband had the caprese salad which he said was fine. I had the mussels done \\"white\\". I was really enjoying the unusual flavor (kind of spicy, not just white wine) and then I got to two mussels that were literally filled with globs of mustard. Well, that was the flavor. It was a basic mussel water base (not even sure if there was white wine) with mustard added. Umm, ok. The bread was the best part, it was served warm and had good flavor. The oil they served it with was way too thick, but I did like the mild red pepper flake taste. I'll also say the drinks were good and from our time at the bar the bartender was very friendly.\\n\\nOur main courses were a big disappointment. I ordered the lobster agnolotti because I love lobster ravioli. They should really be honest and call it crab and lobster agnolotti. The majority of the pasta was filled with crab meat and then it was topped with a small lobster claw cut in two. It was still fine, and for the price I wasn't terribly surprised but still be honest about it, especially when there are people with crab allergies. The pasta was unusually thick. The sauce tasted like a vodka sauce and it was pretty good but nothing to write home about. There was nothing else, no veggies, just a sprig of basil. Overall, fairly bland. My husband had the orecchiette on the waiters recommendation. He didn't eat more than a few bites and he made me taste it because he said it had no flavor other than the cheese on top. He was right. The \\"sauce\\" was just melted butter. You could barely taste any of the hot pepper (and I hate spicy things but I would still have wanted more than this), overall it was very bland and oily. He's also a meatball lover and ordered one meatball to go with it and said it tasted like Chef Boyardee and he only ate half of it. I have never seen him leave a meatball on his plate.\\n\\nWe got the chocolate fondant cake to go, that was great and I'd happily eat it again. The last weird thing, that I'm sure they have no control over, was the water. I don't believe I've ever complained about water before but my husband and I both thought it was too gross to drink. I thought it just tasted really chlorinated, but he kept saying it tasted \\"milky\\". I'd imagine it's tap water though so, again, nothing the restaurant can control but still really weird.

I think mainly because we didn't come here for brunch, but rather dinner. Our party of 4 split the beef tartare, mushroom risotto, and the gaucho ribeye. The tartare had an Asian fusion feel to it since it came with some veggies to make wraps. The overall taste was aiite. The risotto had a nice texture and the slow-poached egg was a good addition to it. The ribeye was picked amongst the other meat dishes because my friend was a fan of chimichurri but honestly, it was just whatever. I felt like the ribeye was cooked medium, rather than the preferred medium rare, despite the red color in between the pieces.

I think my party of 3 waited a little over an hour - which we used to walk around the neighborhood, glimpse  Paul Revere's house, etc. Once seated, you are subject to hearing every loud conversation around you because of the small space, and a constant line of people at the door, which never seems to close. A woman at a neighboring table was yelling almost constantly at the patrons waiting to \\"close the door\\" as the draft of the 50 degree day was quite chilly coming in. \\n\\nWe only ordered oysters and drinks and although the oysters were delicious, we had no idea what we were eating. All three of us had ordered 9 or more oysters of many different varieties, but the restaurant refused to put them on separate platters, and they are not labeled. They simply told us to start at the lemon slice and work your way around the platter with the oysters in order of top to bottom on the menu. There were multiple circles as we ordered about 18 oysters and with the varying sizes, it was impossible to tell which circle was which.

My husband said his meal was a-ok and I have to say my club was one of the best and freshest I've ever had.  Avocado and sprouts were perfect.\\n\\nThe main reason I deducted one star is because the ambience leaves much to be desired.  I know that sounds harsh.  It was basically one giant room with tile floor, there were tables and booths.  Some commercial artwork hung un-thoughtfully and there was no music.  That was my complaint with the other \\"Breakfast Club\\"..add some smooth jazz or something.....I'm not a big fan of carpet but something should be done for all of the noise.  Like I said - Giant Room, tile floor, sterile looking furnishings..people eating and talking....I like something more warm and inviting.\\n\\nThat being said, menu was great, the service was top notch and the the food is definitely solid.

I wanted to take advantage of the roof deck for my birthday, but the promoter never responded to my email.  When I texted him, he only responded when he thought I was going to book a table or cabana with a $500 minimum.  WHAT?!  At any other place in Boston, bottle service is more like $300.

I rarely order omelettes and have NEVER ordered grits in my life.  I tried them based on the reviews here and am glad that I did.  They are fantastic, and even have a hint of a ceyenne pepper zing.  The omelette is just a great omelette served with lots of cheddar cheese, onion and ham and served with some home styled potatoes that have a nice kick.\\n\\nMy kids get the Vanilla French toast.  It is very good and served with the obligatory dusting of powdered sugar and little serving cups full of syrup and sugared pecans;  a very nice touch for the small ones.\\n\\nCoffee is decent, service is prompt, and the whole place is well lit and noisy enough during weekend brunch that we don't feel guilty about bringing the kids along when not properly napped."},{"name":"Chili's","address":"12181 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Worst service ever!!!!!

For the temperature, I asked for my burger to be medium. When it arrived, I was in awe! I couldn't figure out how to bite into it, so I settled with using a fork & knife to help me with the task. I loved every component on my burger - the cheese, caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, banana peppers, and I added jalape√±o peppers to give it some more heat.

She mixed me up a couple of cocktails (don't remember what they were.....this was the end of my trip and I had had A LOT to drink so details are a little blurred).  They were great.  Well crafted.  \\n\\nI have to admit that I wasn't extremely hungry when I went in, so I ordered the foie gras torchon first (even though the bartender told me it was a little on the sweet side and would be better as a dessert).  She was right!  I would have been better after the main course, but, like I said, I was here for the foie and I didn't want to spoil my appetite.  The foie was served with three medallions, almond biscotti, apricot puree and a charred  apricot on the side.  The flavors all worked together very well, but I would have preferred if it wasn't so sweet and the foie had a little more of a chance to shine.\\n\\nFor my main, I ordered the chicken fried trout.  This was awesome!  For the price of $22 (remember, I am coming from the bay area), I was expecting something a little smaller, but when it came out, it was a whole boneless filet that took up the entire place.  It has some horseradish sauce on top of it, with a bunch of chervil and other herbs along with some thinly sliced pickled veggies (mostly radishes).  They served some butter lettuce on the side, and the concept was that you were supposed to break off pieces of the trout and the fixins' and load them up into the lettuce to make your own lettuce wrap taco thingies.  It was perfection.  Very casual yet elegant at the same time.  I ate all of it and I was already kind of full from the foie.  \\n\\nAll in all, a great experience.  Would have given it 5 stars if the foie dish was a tad more standout, but this place is totally solid and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.

First, the bread is amazing. Solid crust, fluffy inside, but doesn't hurt your mouth like some italian breads do. Second, they slice each meat and cheese individually before making your sandwich. They are sliced incredibly thin, making it so easy to bite through while eating-it doesn't fall out like many do. On top of all that, the meat and cheese is top quality and tastes amazing. Also, all the produce on the sandwich was perfect, including the tomatoes, which tend to be grainy on many sandwiches in the area. \\n\\nThis is very likely the best italian hoagie in boston, so hurry up."},{"name":"BBR Columbus","address":"106 Vine St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"BBR is just okay.

With so many options of cool trendy bars, dive bars, sports bars etc in Columbus, BBR's night life blends in with the genre of other bars in the same general vicinity. \\n\\nThey do have a moderately respectable drink list, but not one that I would call competitive with some of the best bars in Columbus.

It was so bad that we sent it back, and I'm spice-tolerant.  The waitress says that the green chile seems to range from very mild to wildly hot.  She suggests ordering a taster or getting it on the side. Too bad we didn't get this advice up front.  Companion's replacement choice was a chicken enchilada.  Under the top layer was a handful of uncooked onions.  Like a small pile of them.  Really?  Even if you don't saute them, you could at least spread them around.  \\n\\nThe chips were over-fried and tasted almost burnt.  Unfortunately, this was the worst meal we've had out in a while.

The next thing you'll notice is the awesome restaurant decor.  The wall fountain is really neat.\\n\\nSue me-- I had a good experience.  The waiter was odd (I think he was stoned out of his mind), but most of them seemed to be a little off.

It's always amusing to me when chain restaurants try to portray themselves as overly-nice.  It was whatevs.\\n\\nWe ordered the guacamole, which was made at our table and was ridiculously good.

They also bring steamed corn tortillas with the appetizer.  Next, I ordered the lamb tacos, which were tender, nicely seasoned, and served with beans.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the dish I ordered.

Okay, I know I'm from the Midwest and therefore my review may be categorized by some as uninformed, and to some degree it is. But in Minneapolis' defense, we have the Smack Shack, which has made a number of national lists for their lobster roll.\\n\\nNow that that's out of the way ... Neptune is truly in another universe and it's an excellent one to visit.\\n\\nI went on a Sunday afternoon around 2:30 to find the place full up with a 30-minute wait. I wasn't too hungry yet, so decided to continue walking the Freedom Trail and hit it later when more hungry. I intended to get back around 4, but that got delayed to about 5:15. At that time, the wait was more like an hour (keep in mind, this was for a single spot at the bar). Now normally, I'm not down for that, but I really wanted to try this place and stuck it out.\\n\\nAnd I'm glad I did as every morsel was worth it.\\n\\nThe staff were great. They remembered me from my earlier run by and although I didn't get in any faster than they told me it would be, they were gracious about it, not snooty. (After all, a place that commands that sort of wait throughout the day could well get full of itself.) My waitress at the bar was knowledgeable, prompt, and attentive. And despite the busyness, I didn't feel rushed, though I also didn't drag out my meal.\\n\\nI got a couple clams (Littleneck and Cherry Stone) and a Katama Bay oyster. All were fabulous and insanely fresh, but the Littleneck was my favorite (and the one I'd really wanted to try).\\n\\nNeptune serves their lobster roll two ways: warm with butter or cold with mayo. I'm not averse to mayo, but given a choice between it or butter and I'll take the butter any day. I realize that's not the traditional Boston way, but went with my gut.\\n\\nThe roll was amazing.\\n\\nSimple. Just huge chunks of perfectly cooked lobster, a little butter (and perhaps a touch of the broth/brine), and a fluffy, grilled roll to mop it up. No celery, no nothing else. Just pure perfection, celebrating the lobster itself.\\n\\nI've seen some complaints (on other sites and here) about the price and size. Granted, I don't live on the coast and I'm sure that fabulous lobster rolls can be found at many places, some for less. But the quality of the ingredients did not leave me lamenting the $25 price tag for the roll. The individual clams and oysters seemed reasonably priced to me and there weren't any minimum purchase limits like I've seen elsewhere. And the portion size ... Are you kidding me? If Neptune's lobster roll and accompanying fries is too small a portion for you, I think you have some issues! There were two women sitting next to me and between us, one finished her roll (with some effort), one was only able to eat half (a crime I say!!), and none of us came close to finishing our fries, which pale by comparison to the roll, but are good in and of themselves.\\n\\nMy advice: go early, don't eat lunch, wait however long you have to to get in, and start with the lobster roll. And if you're still hungry, then order some chowder or a la carte items.\\n\\nBut if you're in Boston for a short time, definitely go here!"},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We had a longish layover at Logan so we looked to Yelp for a good recommendation.

While \\"noodle\\" is in the name, that's not the only food this eatery serves. Like other Asian food court stalls, Noodle Cafe has a selection of pre-cooked Asian foods ready to be served off a hot buffet line. There are a few of these types of restaurants inside the Mall at Peachtree Center, but I think Noodle Cafe may be the best because their food seems to be the freshest and highest quality, relatively speaking of course.\\n\\nNoodles served include pad Thai noodles, su mein noodles, noodles stir-fried with proteins such as chicken, shrimp, squid, and beef, and Singapore noodles. They have noodle soups such as Thai tom yum seafood noodle soup and Vietnamese pho. Examples of non-noodle options include Thai spicy chicken, red curry chicken, sesame chicken, hot braised tofu, eggplant, mushrooms, and stir-fried string beans. I think these selections are comparatively healthier than the cafe's intra-mall competition.\\n\\nPrices for most entrees range from $6.25 to $8.25 (plus tax). I tried a $6.25 lunch special which nets rice or noodles plus any two entrees. One thing I like about this place is the noodles on the hot bar are pad Thai noodles, not run-of-the-mill lo mein noodles. The pad Thai comes with bean sprouts, thinly sliced carrots, and cilantro.\\n\\nI had the pad Thai noodles with stir-fried eggplant and red curry chicken. During my visit, all of the foods had just been cooked and looked quite appetizing. The light purple eggplant was glistening. It sat in a light brown garlic sauce with bits of red chili pepper. The pieces of red curry chicken were lean and came with green bell pepper and red chili. It was a quick, filling, and rather satisfying food court meal.

Did enjoy the pickles that came with it though! Two of my friends ordered the mac and cheese, one opted to add in bacon and the other to add in truffle. Probably the worst mac and cheese any of us had ever had (obviously not including Kraft or Velveeta lol). The sauce was just so watery and had no flavor to it. If it was me I would have sent it back, which my one friend agreed with but the others didn't want to so we just dealt with it. The manager did notice we were not enjoying it and came over to offer if we wanted to send it back, so that was really nice and attentive, but she didn't want to say it was that bad and kept it.

I split a sandwich with my friend which was fine and they had a tomato soup which was pretty good. But the beet salad was basically an arugula salad with minimal remarkably small diced beets and minimal goat cheese. I don't care that much for beets so it was fine for me but I have just never seen a beet salad with so few beets. I also ordered the chop salad later as I was really craving veggies, it was barely edible after they drowned it in dressing. Not shocked by that as this seems to be a common issue with chop salads. \\nBar itself is pretty cool and the vibe is pretty fun.

They have several vegetarian items on the list-- particularly of note is the cactus burrito. Cactus, for those who have never tried it, does not involve a slow, painful process of de-thorning the flesh, as you sometimes have to w/ bony fishies. Cactus is something like a mild pepperoncini,  or yellow bell pepper. Delicious! Highly unusual menu item, and very nicely done, especially in this remote neck of the woods (remote in the sense that the nearest cacti to here must be, what? 800 miles away in Nevada or So Cal somewhere?

For happy hour, we had the pate, radicchio salad, and the steakhouse sandwich. It was plenty of food, shared, to make a meal. The pate board was delicious, rich, and nicely portioned. We've been sampling radicchio salads at many places since we just don't get the monster heads seen around here in the Midwest, and I love the slight bitterness. Tasty n Alder and Oven & Shaker were the best I've had, both playing on a classic Caesar, this one with manchego cheese, bacon, and a beautifully runny egg. The steakhouse sandwich - $9 on midday happy hour - was big, and equally delicious and well-done.\\nFor breakfast, I was very tempted to go with the Korean fried chicken, but my partner doesn't like kimchee and we were splitting our dishes. It looked fantastic and the guy at the next table said he loved it. Instead, we had the oyster (Hangtown) fry and the omelet. The omelet was good and original, with chips of nutty roasted parsnip and a Croque Monsieur combo of Gruyere cheese and dijon mustard that worked nicely with the sausage. But the oyster fry was our fave of the two - crisp-fried oysters with a biscuit, bacon, cheddar, and a zingy remoulade that was great with the oysters making a nice visual play on the typical sausage gravy for biscuits.\\nIt would've been easy to sample the many breakfast small plates/tapas that also looked amazing, or to return for some of the amazing items off the dinner menu.

The menu is somewhat limited in the sense that it's best to eat there as an in between meal, not as a dining destination.

Calling this a bar that serves food completely misses the mark.  An extensive menu, it includes burgers, sandwiches, snacks, appetizers, and of course a variety of beers (e.g., Leinenkugel, Blue Moon, Killian's) on tap.  Especially noteworthy are their chicken wings, available in 10 (or is it 12?) gradations of \\"hotness.\\"  These are unlike any other wings one can order in other restaurants: these guys are big, filling, and delicious.  Burgers, as have been noted in other reviews here, are spectacular and stately; best eaten with knife and fork.  Fries and onion rings are also excellent and arrive in a size that can handle a table-full of eaters.\\nThe only downside is the wait for tables.  I guess that is the price of success.  Thankfully, one can sidle up to the bar for drinks while awaiting seating.  It would be nice if reservations were taken, but not at the moment.  Worth the wait?

Went with the chicken and cheese and proceeded to add nearly every veggie possible. The chicken and cheese aren't that great but I definitely appreciated quite the array of veggie options. I'm a sucker for cabbage and loved that they had both kinds. They should consider adding more sauces that aren't on the spicy sauce/mayo/cream side of the spectrum. When I have basically a salad in front of me the last thing I want is spicy hot sauce. Some vinaigrette options or a green goddess dressing would be nice. Would be nice to add other salad type cheese options (blue, feta, Gorgonzola, goat) and avocado!

They have a small vertical sign next to the entrance that says American Craft.  \\n\\nAnyhow, as I said, I live in the neighborhood and I go here every few months.  I can almost throw a rock to the place it is so close to my house.  In the past I have been happy with this placd and I even liked this place when it was the Roadhouse BBQ.  I must say that my last experience was not good at all.  It was on Marathon Monday 2011.  I had several friends over to my house for the marathon and as we are still young but not irresponsible (age range of 30 - 34)  we watched the marathon, ate some food, and had a few beverages.  Several hours into the day and as the marathon winded down, a few freinds were looking to grab an early dinner so someone mentioned American Craft.  8 of us therefore walked the 2 minute walk to American Craft to grab a beverage and a bite to eat.  Mind you we are not in our 20's and are responsible and none of us were intoxicated.  I lagged behind the group with my girlfriend and watched everyone get in after their ID's were checked by a guy with glasses and a beard.  I watched all of my friends get into the bar, but as I got up to the door I was told I can't go in.  I said why?  He told me he saw me with a solo cup across the street and that it could have been alcohol.  I told him it could have been water or fruit punch or alcohol.  I tossed the cup in the trash on the street and he saw me do that too.  I am 31 years old and I am 6 ft. 4in. and 220 lbs.  I had 4 or 5 beverages throughout the day... it was the marathon, everyone had beverages.  I dont get intoxicated because i am so big especially with 4 or 5 beverages.  I talked to him calmly and thought it was ridiculous and said it was the marathon and over 75% of the patrons in the place had probably had a few beverages during the day.  He insisted he would not let me in so I asked if I could gather my 7 freinds who were probably going to spend north of $200 or so and get the the F out of there and he said fine.  I then grabbed my friends and left.  We went to the Golden Temple which had no problem letting us in.  Again, we were not intoxicated but apparently my solo cup means bad things.  I am a responsible 31 year old that picks up trash off the street and takes care of my neighborhood.  I own my own home/condo in Brookline along with a rental property and can't stand it when things like this happen.   Needless to say, I will probably NEVER go to this joint again.  I will also tell everyone I know about this and deter them from patronizing this place.  Good luck American Craft.

We were able to feed myself, my husband, our daughter, and my father for about twenty bucks--  an incredible deal. The beef was really tender and the veggies were perfectly cooked. The egg rolls and rangoons weren't greasy at all, even though they were fried. I don't think I've ever eaten a more delicious egg roll in my whole life. The wonton soup and the accompanying fried wonton noodle things (I don't know what they're called) were perfect. Seriously, perfect.

All the staff were great (although we were warned of, and expecting some, evident growing pains). We ate at the bar because although it was only 5:30 on a holiday Saturday night, there was already a wait for tables. Right now there are TVs only over the bar, and when we told the bartender we'd be disappointed to see large TVs on the attractive brick wall opposite, she told us they would be raised and lowered - lowered mainly for weekend afternoon games, and raised on Friday and Saturday nights. The crowd was very much Stats and Playwright, etc. so our hopes for something a little more sophisticated didn't materialize. The noise level was loud when we entered and became \\"Saturday-night-bar-level\\" before we left - at 7:00, and without any music playing. We didn't have a chance to get into the back room, but the surfaces appeared just as 'aggressive' [hard and resonant] there, and there are rumors of live music going in. The food was good; a cut above the aforementioned places, but not much more adventuresome. The drinks were very good, and the wine a good pour. The prices were very reasonable. By the time we got up to leave the crowd was three-deep behind us, waiting to take our places. The bartenders, front of house, and wait staff all seemed very friendly, but we couldn't help but feel a little of the \\"it's Mom and Dad, here to dine!\\" vibe from them since we were a little outside of the predominant demographic in the place, and that may be pretty much the way they planned it."},{"name":"Mary's Cafe","address":"3209 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome location, awesome-er peeps!

Our entire party wasn't there yet so we waited at the bar. I ordered the sixes and sevens. The drinks are extremely fancy and my simple drinkin self is not used to all this pomp and circumstance! So I saw a couple of ingredients in one or 2 drinks that I recognized and decided to roll with that! I ordered the \\"sixes and sevens\\". I saw peppermint, creme...and some other stuff. Sounds good! It tasted NOTHING like what I thought it would. Which at first, I was going to rule as a negative. BUT as I kept on drinking (it was smaller than I thought too BTW), this ONE drink was getting me where I need to be (lol), so I was content lol! \\n\\nWith the majority of our party there, we were sat at our table. Starving, we ordered an app. We went with the shrimp tacos. SO good! And what made it so good was the corn tortilla and the Aioli sauce! When the rest of our party got there, we went ahead and ordered. I got the Shrimp and grits (my go to meal). I almost strayed because just about everything sounded great (especially the smoked wings, which we caught a glimpse of as they were being brought to another table). The rest of my party ordered the pork sliders, the smoked wings, and the red snapper with frites. No one was disappointed with their meal! I can't say enough good things about my Shrimp and Grits: great flavor, enough shrimp, sausage and peppers and the creme sauce were great too! I was definitely pleased.\\n\\nWe stuck around because DJ Kemit was spinning 45's that night for his edition of \\"Kickin up Dust\\". Being a vet of The Sound Table, we know how crowded this quaint little place can get, so we decided to stay at our table and a few of us ordered more drinks. We could tell the server was ready for us to leave because he took everything but the table itself, lol. However, we're still drinking so we're not going anywhere! \\n\\nDJ Kemit did not disappoint and as expected, the place got PACKED! The people were great and I had a great time dancing to some of my favorite tunes from back in the day while working off the damage I did from dinner. \\n\\nNow that I know what great food and drinks this place has, not to mention great guest DJs, I'm sold 100%.

I religiously attend the Apopka Food Truck Roundup every month and am always eager to try new trucks. This month Bem Bom, which I had seen but never tried before, was there so I figured I'd give it a try. What a poor choice that was. I ordered the lamb burger and braised pork prego (mostly out of curiosity for what a Portuguese sandwich would taste like). My braised pork prego was first out to the window and for some reason I had to wait on the lamb although I ordered it medium, not well. I saw what appeared to be a lamb burger finally make it's way to the window but it was accompanied by a different order ticket so for some reason it was given to someone that ordered after I did. Then another sandwich finally appeared with another ticket and it sat....and sat....and sat...while the lady taking the orders kept yelling to the kitchen she was waiting for lamb. Well after waiting for literally about ten more minutes (my kids had already finished their meals from other trucks) the kitchen staff tells the lady that he brought the lamb out a long time ago. Apparently she did not recognize the fact that the lonely sandwich was a lamb burger. She finally boxed up and handed me my cold food without so much as a \\"sorry for the wait\\" or \\"thank you\\". Finally I was ready to eat. I love all types of foods especially ethnic cuisines so I was very surprised to learn that I did not like either one at all. The lamb was less-gross than the braised pork, but nevertheless, it was not tasty at all. I will definitely avoid this truck in the future and warn others about it as well.

I ordered the scotch flight and, a few minutes later, a woman and her daughter sat at a table next to us.  The woman ordered a beer.  Soon, her beer was delivered and so was the soup I'd ordered, yet no scotch flight.  A few minutes later, we asked about it and were told the bartender hadn't made it yet.  Not sure why pouring 3 small amounts of straight scotch takes over 10 minutes...\\n\\nThe shepard's pies were good and so was the potato leek soup.  My husband loved his sticky toffee pudding.  I should have known better than to order the 'no sugar added' dessert option because it was bland and not very good.  I just hadn't seen anything else on the dessert menu that seemed appealing.  When I ordered a beer for my second drink, it came out quickly and was tasty.  I liked that they had a woman playing live piano in the bar area.  Sadly, (we were seated around 8pm) a group of three (man, woman, and toddler) were seated right behind my husband around 8:30.  The toddler was tired and cranky.  As the parents downed booze, the kid screamed and ran around the restaurant.  At one point he was screaming and crying without a break so the woman slung him over her shoulder which aimed his screaming face at the back of my husband's head.  Not relaxing.. but also not the restaurant's fault..\\n\\nWe were told we could be taken to a place to stand and watch the fireworks, so we went along.

It doesn't matter if she says six hours, you will wait and it will be worth it. \\n\\nBesides, there are plenty of things to buy and see in the North End in the meantime. You could even get coffee and dessert before dinner to kill time (not that anyone would do that, of course). Although, hypothetically speaking, I recommend hitting up Maria's for baba rum, ricotta pie, and a napoleon... I ate at Neptune twice in two days (and hypothetically Maria's) and would have happily gone again if given extra resources and stomach space. I can't recommend one dish more highly than the next, but I can tell you everything I managed to stuff down my gullet while there.\\n\\n1. Hot lobster roll. Everyone around us was eating this dish, and every person licked their buttery plate clean, from the hot, soaked roll, to the huge, steaming, chunks of lobster, to the perfectly crisp heap of fries and ketchup on the side. The quest for 'best lobster roll in Boston' has effectively been terminated. Not to mention, the empowering feeling that accompanies combining a bite of really cheap food (fries) with really expensive food (lobster) is AWESOME. The best of both worlds is an understatement.\\n\\n2. Uni pasta. There is not nearly enough tubetti in the world, so the fact that this dish featured the tiny tubes immediately won my heart (or perhaps stomach). Between the light, savory, creamy sauce, green peas, morels, chewy little pastas, and uni so tender that chewing became superfluous, it only seemed natural that I eat this dish this twice in 24 hours. My one regret is not having it a third time.\\n\\n3. Johnny cakes. This dish was reminiscent of a bagel, lox & cream cheese on crack. Replace the bagel with a fluffy, chewy johnnycake topped with a sweet molasses-y glaze, the lox for a mound of trout tartare and black caviar, and the cream cheese for a dollop creme fraiche. The contrast of flavors and textures is pretty unique to this dish, and the sweet and salty ratio was perfect. I was craving it again the next morning (I mean, johnny cakes are breakfast food...)\\n\\n4. Ciopinno - An octopus's dream come true. Juicy lobster, heaps of clams and mussels, prawns with heads in tact, and cubes of silver skinned salmon over saffron rice in a spicy broth. I suppose saffron rice doesn't apply to an octopus's dream come true, but aside from that, this entree was just a melange of perfectly prepared, high quality seafood... and besides, everyone loves sucking the juices out of a prawn head. If you're conflicted about which undersea morsel to consume, the ciopinno lets you have it all.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, try anything and everything that appeals to you. You can't go wrong, and you probably just waited 3 hours to get in, so take advantage of it. Neptune is the best of the best... so good, you might find yourself back there the next day."},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is very exclusive, each dish has a special touch of different and exquisite ingredients I would recommend it as one of the restaurants with the best knowledge for cooking in Boston!!\\nThanks to the chef Colin and his wife heather for their good hospitality, the service it's excellent.

They also have a soup of the day (typically clam chowder or lobster bisque) and a half lobster roll/cup of soup option for $10 that would make for a killer lunch. When we were there, the owner was also running a lobster mac n' cheese special.\\n\\nWe tried each roll and the macaroni n' cheese. Folks, I was floored when I saw our rolls.

These are huge!!!! And full of thick smoked bacon that they smoke themselves. Each bite had hunks of bacon egg and cheese. The muffins, are housemade as well. At first I thought I made a bad breakfast decision. But after tasting it, I am now a Baba believer. Ummmm side note. The restaurant itself is quite cozy. Meaning its small. But that's not a bad thing. Everywhere you look you will find something special with intended purpose. Very thoughtfully decorated. There are half a dozen tables and a long bar table overlooking the large window. A nice place to order a yummy sandwich and coffee, and sit with a book while having the sun shine on your happy munching face."},{"name":"Gringos Locos","address":"517 E Michigan St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We are from Mount Dora, and have been staying over at Ronald McDonald House for the past 3 months while our baby is at APH.

The skyline of Portland is truly captured by floor-to-ceiling windows that line the walls.

I've always wanted to eat at Neptune on a Monday so I could try their lobster spaghettini special. I was fortunate to go on a Monday a few weeks ago and it was AMAZING! By far the best lobster pasta dish I've ever had. The dish seems quite simple but perhaps that's what keeps it so perfect. They give you a ton of great lobster meat, the sauce is to die for, and the portion is huge. I will be talking about this meal for quite some time and am dreaming of the next Monday when I get to go back for it. They also had a great beer selection. The only downfall is that you can't make reservations and the wait is often a couple hours.

Well, the beauty of Yelp is there are always recent reviews we can use as a reference that a place is still as good as originally rated. This is definitely the case for Neptune Oyster, I can affirm the food is absolutely delicious. \\n\\nI have to start with the oysters, first of all I enjoyed the little paper provided by our hostess that had a list of all the oysters available from the raw bar with description of their specific tastes, where you can mark how many you want of each. Second they really know how to shuck oysters in this restaurant and third the quality of the oysters is amazing. Then comes the lobster roll, OMG, ordered the hot version with butter.  As lobster roll is served with fries I usually ignore the bun. Didn't work this way, the butter from the lobster soaked in the bread and we ended up eating the bun after everything else in the dish was cleaned up, simply because it was yum. The Neptune Caesar salad was tasty, the salad freak in me disapproved the whole lettuce leafs, I prefer them cut, but still this is a delicious bunny dish (if bunnies eat anchovies). Wine list is strong, there was no chardonnay by the glass, but we were served some regardless. \\n\\nWait time time was 20 minutes on Friday, 5pm, but people coming after us were told they can be seated after one hour.

I usually follow the rule that says you should not eat oysters in the months that do not have an \\"R\\" in it, but the bartender recommended some Oysters from Maine (can't recall the name of them for the life of me) for our platter - most amazing oysters ever!  and the rest of the platter just kept getting better.

I couldn't get myself to eat raw pork meat so I asked if I could please send it back to get it cooked through. She was nice enough to do that so I'll give an extra star for that. When she came back, I asked if we could see the dessert menu. She said sure, and then came back with a little dessert and said that was on the house and for our anniversary. As much as we were appreciative of the anniversary dessert, we never got the menu so we figured we had no choice but just to take our checks, pay and leave. I wished I had a better experience but unfortunately I don't think I'll ever return here again.

First of all i think we can all agree that Portland, OR is one of the most beautiful cities in the U.S., and this place definitely portrays the beauty of the city and surrounding sights. Located on the 30th floor of one of the tallest buildings in Portland, on a nice day you can see miles and miles of gorgeous scenery. Secondly, what better way to observe all of this, then by chowing down on a huge burger, listening to some nice Elton john tunes coming from the complimentary piano player.....\\nThe food here is good and a great mixture of exotic, fancy, \\"white tablecloth\\" type food and simple American bar food. The restaurant is great for a date with a lady friend, but you need a reservation and it will run you about 50-100 bucks a plate...\\nThe alternative to that, is what I like to call \\"Ballin' on a Budget\\"\\nSimply take your date to the bar during happy hour. You will get the same view, with a smaller price tag. The only downside to this, is that you might have to thumb wrestle some peeps for a seat. It's a lot like playing musical chair. The place does tend to get crowded and the drinks are somewhat weak and pricey. I usually order the  burger off the happy hour menu, and for under 4 dollars this is still the best bang for the buck. Overall I would recommend this place for a great first date."},{"name":"Imperial Fez","address":"2285 Peahtree Rd NE, Ste 102","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Loved it!

Minus the time we spent driving around looking for parking, I was still pleased. \\n\\nWhen we went, there was a street festival going on to support the homeless (major props to them for that), but we opted to go inside for a sit down meal. We were seated immediately and were greeted by an incredibly friendly server whose name completely slips my mind. We decided to opt for the family meal for four or something similarly named and within 10 minutes (NO LIE), the food just started to pour out. Literally. First came the corn bread. Then the pulled chicken. And black beans. And barbequed chicken, ribs, coleslaw, rolls, corn on the cob, sauces, and there might have been more, but I'm pretty sure I blacked out because of all the food I ate. The fact that all of the food barely fit on our table was a whole other story. I'm not a huge fan of everything that was placed down in front of me, but there was a wide variety of it to please everyone at the table. I was told the coleslaw was \\"sucky\\" and incredibly runny, but the pulled chicken was still amazing, and my sister almost hurt my mother when she suggested that she take the black beans home with her instead of with us. The servings were more than needed and we definitely came home with a few leftovers.

Food was excellent and I enjoyed the patio on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  2 stars off for bad service which ruined a nice Sunday Brunch.  \\n\\nIt all started with the hostess who sat us at our table and forgot to bring menus.  She said she would be right back but never showed up with menus.  Our waitress came about 5 min later to ask for our drink order and we told her we didn't have menus.  Should she have noticed that there were no menus on table when she arrived?  Menus showed up with water 5 min later but she did not come back to the table until 15 min later to take our order.   Once our order was taken, it was the little things which built up to a negative experience overall.  Coffee was brought promptly but no spoon provided on table or with coffee to stir in milk or sugar.  We were unable to ask for a spoon as waitress did not come back to check in on us until after food arrived!\\n\\nFood was slow to arrive for 4 diners.  Approx 20-25 min.  Food was brought out by a runner, so do not know who to fault for not getting our order correct.  No whipped cream with chocolate pancakes as stated with the menu.  Also ordered pastry but was given wrong pastry.  Waitress did come by after a few minutes of us eating to check in on us, which was appreciated.  Food was very good.  I recommend the short rib hash.  Very flavorful and different item for brunch.  Pancakes were very large for the order.  Hamburger was cooked properly and very flavorful.  Omelette was only disappointment.  The menu stated burrata, basil, tomato and basil was more of a pesto than pieces of basil.  Gave it a much different flavor having pesto omelette than the the fresh basil flavor that is associated with a tomato/burrata combo. \\n\\nOverall, 3/5.  It would have been 5/5 if service was better.  Perhaps, the patio service is disorganized as I saw multiple different wait staff between tables which may have lead to the inconsistency in wait service.

Perfectly poached eggs and crispy mushroom toppings, savoury bloody marys and thick biscuits.\\n\\nThe problem is, Tasty N Alder's doesn't give the atmosphere they are charging you for.  They are overcharging the food and cramming guests so close together they can't escape fellow table's conversation. That wouldn't even be so bad, if they billed it as commons-style seating, but instead it's very tight table after table, chairs bumping into other seats.  It makes for unpleasant bathroom trips and people being able to spill their drinks onto your meal.  It happened to me.  That's how close we were seated.\\n\\nThe food is tapas style, which is fine if you are eating with a large group, but harsh if you are just here as a couple and you have different tastes.  I sat there eating my sandwich.  Twenty minutes later, his sandwich came out.  I'm not saying I want this tapas style breakfast manner to change altogether - I think it's a brilliant way to share food in groups.  But surely two sandwiches around the same time shouldn't be such an affront to your business model?  It almost seemed like they were doing it out of policy instead of out of need - there is no way they couldn't have made another sandwich within 20 minutes.  We had already waited so long for the first one, why not make them together?\\n\\nI appreciate Tasty n Alder's joining of the flavourhood.

I tried several flavors.  Many of the ice creams are not very refined, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  For example, the Coffee and Donuts is literally like eating coffee ice cream with bits of donut mixed in.  It's different and can throw you off a bit if you're not expecting to find bits of breading/batter in your silky smooth ice cream.\\n\\nI ordered a cup of the Diesel Fuel ice cream and it had me bouncing off the walls that afternoon.  It was delicious, though I wasn't a huge fan of the whole espresso beans inside the ice cream.  There were copious amounts.\\n\\nOther flavors I enjoyed included the Kiss O' The Leprechaun (mint chocolate chip) and the Vanilla Malt.

Honey Bunny ordered the Cioppino, a fish and shellfish spicy stew served over saffron rice, and splurged on adding Maine lobster to the mix. Pricey option (adds about $12) but again, worth it.

There was a sign that said \\"seat yourself,\\" so I plopped down in front of the gloriously large TV outside on the patio.  Within a couple of minutes the waitress was out to get my drink order.  Pecan Porter was what the belly desired, and that's what it got!  Delicously cold and refreshing.  The sun was shining, Sportscenter was on, the beer was good.  I was one of the only people on the patio.  You see, I'm smarter than the average Frat Boy and know that you can't find a premium seat during the hours of 11:30 to 1:30.  Strategically I showed up at 1:45 and claimed my spot in sun and sports perfection.  My job allows me to do that, sorry about your luck if you're stuck in a cube.\\n\\nI had a Groupon worth $20 so I had some eating to do.  I ordered the fried pickles to start off with.  Goodness gracious, easy on the frickin salt!  Waaaaaaay too much salt.  They weren't unbearable though.  But I won't get them again.  Since I had a lot of money left I opted for the most expensive thing on their menu, the Ahi Tuna Tacos on flour tortillas.  Needless to say by the 2 star rating they weren't good.  The tuna looked like it came out of a package.  Tasted like it too.  It may have been my bad for ordering this at a sports bar type place, but if you charge that much for something, please back it up with good flavor.  \\n\\nAs I was about to leave a crazed crowd of face painted middle-aged and college kids showed up pretty much all at the same time.  There was some \\"futbol\\" on the big screen and somehow all these folks got the day off.  This, I liked!  I liked it a lot!  I stayed for a while longer to be a part of this rowdy crowd and soak in the experience of people passionate about their sport.  Pretty cool way to finish the meal.  But it would have been a better experience, a MUCH better experience if I just came for a few beers on the patio."},{"name":"Wild Wood Bakehouse","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Dedicated gluten free restaurant, buffet on Sundays.

I read quite a few reviews before choosing to go here, so I had high expectations.The rolls seemed pretty decent for the price, and I liked the Vancouver Roll as well as the Dynamite Roll. Some of my other friends had things like the Yam Tempura Roll or the Udon which seemed pretty decent as well. From a food standpoint, the sushi was completely fine, and I have no qualms. My main complaints come from the fact that it is pretty small and quite noisy, so I found it hard to have conversations.The service was also below average with them not coming around very often or being able to split up our bills separately.

Why, my dear friends, would I go to these two places with the sole purpose of trying out their respective takes on this classic New England dish?  Because it's a crap-load of lobster on a bun... that's why.\\n\\nWith that said, the styles of these two lobster rolls are completely different:  warm and buttery vs. cold and mayonnaise-y.  Obviously, the cold version is the \\"classic\\" lobster roll, and there has been a plethora of posts about how a warm roll is akin to going to the Democratic National Convention and proclaiming that George Bush Jr. is the best president ever.  I have never been a traditionalist, so I am reviewing these dishes for what they are.\\n\\nFirst the similarities:\\n1. You get a lot of lobster... not just enough to fill the bun, but enough to REQUIRE eating a good number of fork-fulls before picking the damn thing up and trying to take a bite out of it.  Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way, and ended up spilling about a tail's-worth of lobster meat onto my plate when I tried to take a bite from the get-go.\\n2. Each goes really well with a beer, preferably something that can stand up to the natural butteriness of the lobster meat.  I suppose you could get a nice acidic white, but a nice New England draught (Geary's Winter Ale at Neptune and Tremont Ale at B&G) seemed like the perfect accompaniment to me.\\n\\nDifferences:\\n1. B&G:  cold lobster in a light aioli with lemon and chives sprinkled on top.  The lemon gave the dish the perfect amount of acid to balance the lobster.  Not really mayonnaise-y at all.  Lobster chunks broken up to just the right size so when you take a bite out of the roll, you don't have to chew through a piece of lobster or get an overly large piece in your mouth.\\n2. Neptune:  warm lobster in butter on a toasted brioche bun.  The warmth allowed me to fully enjoy all the natural (and added) butteriness of the lobster.  Often times large chunks of lobster that were obviously crab or tail meat.  While a bit harder to eat, the large chunks gave me the impression that there was some dude in the back who cracked open a fresh lobster, chopped it up a bit, put it in the bun and splash some butter on it.\\n\\nThe service in each place was great.  The decor was a bit different, with Neptune sporting marble tables and an old-school oyster bar feel, while B&G had a more modern touch with a nice open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant where you can watch them do their magic.\\n\\nBoth of these places are must-go's, even if you only like lobster a wee little bit.  I'll be back next time I'm in town, but I think I'll bring some cholesterol-lower medications just in case..."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I would chose Magnolia over other breakfast spots I've tried, but it didn't \\"knock my socks off\\" like I was expecting.

I do realize Caesars vary, but it was different in not a good way. The dressing was dry and sticky and too rich to even finish. Disappointing to say the least. \\n\\nSecond, service was slooooooow. We ate in the bar as they were booked in the restaurant. Its a Saturday night, you should be staffed for a full night. \\n\\nThird...and most disappointing. My meal. I got the prime sirloin steak with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and dungeoness crab. Honestly, it was luke warm for starters. The asparagus was borderline cold and the potatoes were also. It had obviously been sitting for whatever reason. I ordered my steak medium and it wasn't even medium rare, it was flat rare. They of course re-made it and it was much better, but by then we were so done with the place. This plate was $54.

And Connecticut style, which is served warm with a lemon tarragon butter.  I loved the Connecticut style! No filler, just plain lobster with a hint of tarragon butter...absolutely delicious.  On top of the lobster being mouthwatering and fresh beyond belief, the buttery bread makes the roll. The menu is pretty simple.  For $16 you can get either a Maine or Connecticut roll served with a side and a drink. Their location changes daily so you need to follow them on facebook, twitter, or call to find out where they are for the day.  It's better to get there early before they sell out!

Charlestown's lack of restaurants or neighborhood bars (aside from the old guard at Warren Tavern, Ironsides, etc) is painful, considering places like Kendall and Inman Square have a burgeoning culinary scene happening a stones throw away.\\n\\nGrasshopper Cafe is not the start of something special. Upon entering, we had a brief wait where we stood awkwardly amongst diners, but were sat quickly. Everything was very clean, and seeing them even wipe the chair cushions showed they want to give a good vibe. However they may be going down a bad road, as everything seemed a bit sterile; the earth tones, the lack of decor, generic restaurant supply tables, recessed lighting- it was almost like dining in a hospital cafeteria. To their benefit, they have combined the coffeeshop bar with a dining area, and having the option to sit down or just grab something to go is a great idea that will satisfy anyone's morning needs. \\n\\nI ordered the standard breakfast plate of toast, two eggs, home fries, pancakes and sausage, plus coffee. It took a little longer, but it was busy and they're new so it was no problem. Coffee was a good medium roast that got the job done. Toast was no longer warm when it hit the table, which was strange considering we were so close to the kitchen I could almost feel the heat. Eggs were cooked to a perfect over-medium, however were over-salted to point they were inedible.I wish they'd used a quarter of that salt to season the home fries, which were devoid of any flavor whatsoever. Bacon was good, firm but not overcooked. The sausage was tasty, and a bit bigger than the average breakfast sausage, which I would have appreciated had it not been undercooked and soft in the middle. \\n\\n It is still going through growing pains, but I don't believe this place knows exactly what it wants to be yet. Or maybe, it's simply not what I wanted it to be. It could be a great place if they put some thought and creativity into their dishes and made the atmosphere a little more comfortable. Three metal sunflowers, too small for the wall they're on, and curtainless windows looking out to Bunker Hill Ave does not decor make.

This is some misguided hipster's poorly executed interpretation of a few southern classics. The food here is horrible! The service is slow. I saw this on DDD, and I was in Portland for the day I was really looking forward to it. I love good southern food and have eaten A LOT of it. Where do I even start?\\n\\nThe biscuits were sweet and fell apart. AND you have to pay for butter or honey! Frozen biscuits from the grocery are better. Or any fast food joint.\\n\\nThe gravy is inedible. It's got a bunch of weird spices in it like nutmeg and coriander and sugar. I tried 3 small bites with a small piece of biscuit that had fallen off, just because I couldn't believe how bad it was.\\n\\nThe fried chicken is a breast filet. It was edible I suppose but nothing special. Go to Popeye's and get a chicken breast. It's 100 times better.\\n\\nThe hush puppies were undoubtedly the poorest excuse for hush puppies I have ever tried to eat. They were grainy, dry and overcooked. They were actually hard to chew! They had some kind of hard pieces of something in there, like half cooked rice or something. I'm serious, you can't make this stuff up. I got through about half of one of them in an order of 5.\\n\\nIt's suspicious to me that there are hundreds of photographs of their food on here and most look like they were produced  by a professional photographer for a magazine shoot.

However, the asparagus kind of ruined things by being too bitter\\nRice Crusted Cod (3/5) - The cod was really tender and I enjoyed the cauliflower puree, but there wasn't enough to have with the cod, which was bland without it \\nFrozen Parfait (4/5) - Really enjoyed the play of flavors here, though the balance tipped more towards sour than sweet\\nIce Cream & Sorbet (4/5) - The flavors were coconut passionfruit and coffee chocolate. The chocolate ice cream was creamy and folded easily under my spoon, but it took a while for the passionfruit sorbet to be soft enough for us to eat. \\n\\nOverall, decent experience but there were components lacking in the main courses."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"5920 Roswell Rd, Ste B101","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"2","text":"This was the dirtiest Chipolte I've ever been in!

I've lived in Boston for over a year now, and have dined here a handful of times and have finally figured this place out. First, you must know that you need to go here in person to put your name down AT LEAST two hours earlier than the time that you actually intend to eat. Be patient when you're waiting in line, with the hostess, and most importantly DO NOT try and cut or assume that the bar is open seating. There is a line out the door for a reason, and they will get to you when it's your turn. Secondly, once you've put your name down stay within a close proximity of the restaurant, go explore the North End or Boston Public Market to kill time. Once they call you to notify you that your table is ready you have to be back within 10ish minutes to claim your table. Third, only go on a Monday because that's the only day they have lobster spaghetti AKA the best thing on planet earth. Truffles are extra, they're not included and they are an expensive addition but well worth it. You MUST get oysters, that's non-negotiable. Lobster roll and scallops are also a must. Lastly, you must be comfortable with the fact that this place WILL ALWAYS be packed and you will feel like sardines in a can when dining here.

I also got clam chowder. Well, the sad pizza could have been the first clue! A bowl of spicy thick clam chowder, unremarkable, then the salmon was a food service pre charred grill marks, frozen, fishy taste, noodles were not hot, like it had been out all day. Then my husbands pork sandwich was a small bun with dry cubed pork pieces, and nasty  tasting coleslaw. Is management eat their own food. I want to call Robert  Irvine of Restaurant Impossible! They seriously need a makeover of staff and food and decor. The staff was not attentive and lacked maturity. Having teens cook, bad idea, they were wearing beanies in the while cooking, they stood around talking, ignoring clients. If the owner wants to contact me, I can let them know why they are not making money and serve rift raft, the drunks were gross and keep out the better class of clientele they think they bring in, according to the 3star place they said they were, cook fresh not nasty frozen food.

Then I looked down at the floor and realized it was a cockroach. \\n\\nI was basically freaking out inside without trying to make a scene, and I told my boyfriend to get up and stomp it, which he tried to do. Well, he failed, and the roach ran away on the floor of the restaurant. \\n\\nWe were so sicked out by that point, we immediately moved tables. When our waitress came back and noticed we had moved, we told her what had happened and she seemed horrified (who wouldn't be?!). We requested our check because we wanted to get the hell out of there by that point. She hurried back to the kitchen and after a few minutes, came back to the table and told us not to worry about paying (thank God). We left a tip and headed out.\\n\\nI don't know if this is an isolated occurrence, but after reading a 2012 review for this same restaurant and same location that mentions the sighting of roaches, I felt it was probably my duty to leave my experience, as well. \\n\\nI really loved Tin Lizzy's so it makes me sad to write this, but we haven't been back since and I doubt I'll ever go back."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Waiting will be what you do if you go to this popular eatery on a Friday night.

Good place nice environment. Come here and get it! Good place for breakfast. You will not regret it. And now for the full review:\\n\\n\\nFirst time in Portland with my girlfriend and we have been getting a whole bunch of recommendations for good places. We decided to cross this one off the list. From the yelp review and the pictures we thought this place would be a sure win. After getting here and waiting in a short line (out the door), we were able to order and find a seat within 10 mins. \\n\\nWhile waiting for out food we got a stumptown cold brew (smooth and good taste). We chatted and played on our phones and waited. And waited. And waited. We looked at our watches and realized an hour had passed and we still did not get our food. It turns out they had lost our ticket. To compensate they put the meal on the house and offered us complementary drinks. Seems like this does not happen often, so don't worry about this happening to you. \\n\\nWhen we got our food we were extra hungry and well it was really good. The Reggie deluxe was a biscuit with fried chicken bacon cheese gravy and an egg on top. The taste was super on point with a creamy sweet savory mix. It worked really well together. The chicken was cooked perfectly with lots of flavor and the perfect tenderness while keeping moist. The gravy was really interesting with a savory and sweet taste. The biscuits were flaky and buttery. And bacon... It was thick, crunchy, and well just good bacon. Overall the texture was great, a combination of flaky for the biscuits, soft and creamy for the eggs and gravy, crunchy from the chicken and bacon, and the right amount of chewiness from the meat of the chicken. Great food. Get this. \\n\\nMy girlfriend of the chatfield, and I had a bite. It was really good too. The apple butter was a really good taste that kinda put the rest of the meal together. Really good. \\n\\nOverall, this place has an easy and simple system of waiting and ordering. Aesthetics were nice, with a woody modern feel and an open kitchen. The food was really good. Just come here already."},{"name":"The Mighty Bowl","address":"108 W 8th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm a longtime patron of Mighty Bowl and I'm sad to say the love is nearly gone. The new digs are flashy, clean, tasteful, with a fun and helpful staff make it a fun place to visit. Things seem to run smooth and there are loads more options on the menu with fresh ingredients in front of your face. Everything seems great. Unfortunately, they aren't all great. The price has gone up by about 50% for the classic menu items that I used to purchase on the regular. Almost $30 for two burritos a drink and chips. I guess this is justified by new location and more staff, except the quality of the product has hit rock bottom. Both burritos were broke on both ends and it was so loosely wrapped that it fell apart in my hands.  I used a fork.  I would have got the bowl if I wanted to use a fork.  This never happened once before the remodel. I think the basic skills and quality control have been lost in place of new skills accommodating the large new menu. Also, you'd think with no one ahead of me and tons of available staff my burrito would be ready quicker than 10 minutes. Again, something I never encountered before the remodel. The cost for the experience just isn't worth it to me. \\nBring back the truck. Bring back the simple menu and quality food at an affordable price. \\nI hope this review serves as constructive criticism and promotes improvement.

I am confused as is this not the definition of a reservation?!?!? Our party of five was extremely disappointed when we arrived at 5pm and were informed that there were no tables left for the first dinner seating. The gentleman did offer to put us on the list and we could possibly be seated if another party of five did not show.

The trek to Natick for all-you-can-eat sushi is not the most fun thing to do, especially when you're not looking to get anything from The Collections (side note: pretentious name for a mall, no?), so this was a welcome addition to the neighborhood.\\n\\nYes, it's a little pricey (even pricier than Minado), but it's SUSHI - as in not just your normal Old Country Buffet buffet - it's all-you-can-eat sushi, maki rolls, and sashimi. It was a little annoying to hear complaints at the table next to us, when a group of people were making a fuss about the price when their bill came out (Ashleigh P. and Roark D., I read your reviews and just nodded... come on, folks, it's unlimited SUSHI, what did you expect?). The prices are also advertised at the very front of the restaurant, so it shouldn't come as a surprise at all. And if you've been to other sushi buffets, you'd realize that the prices are all pretty similar. \\n\\nAs for the food itself, it was tasty--I disagree with some of the reviewers below who said the avocado was brown (...ew?). I actually got a ton of rolls that were made with avocado, and all of them were a vibrant green. Those reviewers and I apparently went on the SAME NIGHT, so not sure where they were seeing these strangely-coloured rolls... but I digress. The fish was fresh, the veggies were plentiful (mmm, bok choy... mmm, seaweed), and it was all yummy. On a scale of 1-10, I'd give the food a solid 7.5. The side options were, in my opinion, even better than Minado's. The decor was a little funny--very Asian kitschy (hanging umbrellas... c'mon), and the lighting was a little unnatural, but it didn't take away from the experience. That is, the experience of stuffing yourself silly with sushi.\\n\\nOverall, it is an awesome alternative to schlepping yourself all the way to Natick, and it's a very welcome addition to the Allston/Brighton area. Solid food, pretty decent service (very busy, especially for a Monday night when I went--probably because it just opened, and there's a 10% discount on your meal), and it's all you can eat.

You can get a lobster roll all over the place in New England but this place distinguishes itself in two distinct ways.  Number 1 is the mayo based sauce or dressing or whatever you want to call it that is mixed with the lobster.  What's great about Luke's is that it has a DISTINCT and COMPLEMENTARY flavor as compared to the lobster.  Many lobster rolls use the dressing as a vehicle to just keep the lobster moist.  Luke has a unique and delicious flavor to the dressing that tastes wonderful.  Number 2 is the toasted roll...  warm,  buttery,  crunchy.

The place slowly started to fill with Southie locals and girls plucked straight from the Valley of SoCal (where do you girls even come from?). If you would prefer a intimate dining experience or are going on a first date I would not recommend this place; there's no room for the mushy stuff at Lincoln. \\n\\nBoyfriend ordered their gin based specialty cocktail. I'm not a gin lover but that drink turned me into a believer. \\n\\nBread service is always a plus, their butter is whipped (WHIPPED I SAY). We started with the empanadas appetizer, it was small, maybe too small for the steep price point but excellent taste wise. I ordered the roasted chicken, it was cooked to perfection, juicy, fall off the bone and the small side of gnocchi and spinach complemented it so well. The Lincoln burger is a steal for the small price you pay. \\n\\nWe waited almost 40 minutes for our meals but the bread, drinks, and good conversation kept my party satiated.

The wines haven't been consistently great, but the pairings are always interesting and you get way your money's worth.\\n\\nThe courses are smaller, almost tapas-style dishes. I haven't left any of the dinners hungry, but you won't be stuffed either. It's a perfect quantity of food. Some are mini versions of menu items (last time chef RJ served 2 deep fried oysters on top of a mini crabcake, for instance), others are custom creations. The first one I went to, there was a dish of I think wild boar with a red wine sauce that was one of the best dishes I've ever had in Austin. All of the produce comes from local farmer's markets, and RJ talks about where he got it from, what was good about it, etc.\\n\\nThey usually have a local wine rep there who talks about the wines. It's been a different person every time. None of them seemed to be wine experts, but they are very generous with the wine so who is complaining!\\n\\nThe first wine tasting dinner I went to at Blue Star was so great that I deliberately did not review it on Yelp! The event was booked out and I didn't think it needed any more publicity. But last time, there were only 7 people there, so now I'm reviewing it.\\n\\nIf you like wine tastings, and interesting food, you have to check out Blue Star on the first Wednesday of every month!

Our server even told us sorry for neglecting us all evening. I will say the bartenders were really nice, helpful, and quick, but the server on the floor was so busy, so she couldn't give anyone great service and the manager/runner that was helping her was not helpful at all.  Anyways, it's a cool trendy spot in Winter Park and I only wish them luck and success.  Try if you'd like, I hope that our poor service/average food was a fluke, but I'm not going to find out.

Their house red wine was $6.25 on happy hour which just seems pricey for Happy Hour. However, their food and small plates were DELICIOUS. I'd definitely go back for their avocado roll and my friend's plates of ribs and chicken also looked really nom.

Flour has gooood croissants. They are buttery and light inside but packed with that croissant flavor you crave. (Does anyone else ever crave a croissant? #judgementFreeZone ) they are always super crunchy on the outside. Yes, they are a tad pricey, but honestly, I still swear by them. I'd even recommend my proffered way of eating them, but I haven't even gotten to my FAVORITE Flour treat. The last thing I have to say about the best croissant in Boston(ya), is that you have to get there early to snag one of these treats. They are never around in the afternoon. Do it , to it. You'll thank me for this recommendation.\\n\\nOk, onto the real meat. Ok, instead of meat, picture the most amazing sticky bun you have ever seen. Large in size, with perfect pastry buttery goodness. More often then not, the sticky bun is warm when I get it and there is a VERY healthy amount of oooooey goooey sweet caramel goodness. Pecans are sprinkled throughout. You may be inclined to get one of these to split with a friend, but the best advice I could give you, it to get YOUR OWN! Sharing is caring, but you should indulge completely in Flour's sticky bun.\\n\\nAll their sandwiches are good, though I've only had their breakfast sandwich and their BLT. I figure if they can do an above par breakfast sandwich(think awesome bacon, an egg-brick(you'll understand when you get one) and nose-tingling Dijon-mayo) and a filling and delicious BLT, then they can do no wrong elsewhere. I happen to just stick to what I really like when it comes to the sandi.\\n\\nMy friend Kim loves their pudding. I would never think to give pudding a second thought, but she buys a pudding every time she's in Boston. She asks about the pudding when planning trips to Boston. I know that sounds crazy, but I tried a bite once and It's pretty freaking good. \\n\\nIf you're a regular, I'd suggest following Flour's owner @joannebchang on Instagram to see all the amazing desserts on the daily so you know when there are special \\"bonus\\" treats.

First, they have interesting and playful flavors, but the doughnut always remains the star.  I've frequented other renowned doughnut shops in other states where you sometimes tend to see more outrageous flavors/toppings placed atop a fairly ordinary doughnut specimen.

I really do. They've got a rather captive audience with the MGH 75/149 and Spaulding crowd, and they seem to know it.\\n\\nThe mediocre service has been touched on before. The counter lady is kind of surly, but I can deal with that. The prices are OK, but I can't help but feel that there are a lot of places that have way better sandwiches for less money (please move out here, Potbelly's!). It's just not meant to be a dining experience unless your idea of a dining experience involves paper plates. But seriously, your only other close alternative is 149 Eat Street.\\n\\nThere are three things that I really hate here. One - they don't have free tap water which is a blatant grab for money. Two - when I fall for this and get an iced tea, it's 80% ice and 20% tea because god knows that tea is so expensive that they better water it down. And three - no simple syrup so I have to sweeten my iced tea with dextrose-padded powders or sugar which means that I end up with strangely grainy iced tea, strange flavors, or all the sweetness sinking to the bottom.\\n\\nMy current strategy is to focus on breakfast sandwiches (on bagels) which are about 50-60% the cost of the standard sandwiches without much less in terms of quality or enjoyability. I would put these down as an actual good deal at $3.60 each, especially since they are available all day.\\n\\nThe only lunch sandwich that I have liked is the North End which ends up with a weird wetness from the tomato that I oddly enjoy; the Reuben is always slightly disappointing. I've had the meatball sub, but it just feels like every other cheap meatball sub which you might consider a pro or a con. The PB&J is enjoyable in a nostalgic-and-this-is-three-dollars kind of way, but I always have to split it between two snacks because of an overwhelmingly sweet excess of strawberry jam.\\n\\nDespite all my whining, where else am I going to eat a sandwich in peace and watch Family Feud at 3 PM on a Thursday?"},{"name":"Sidelines Restaurant & Sports Bar","address":"6001 NE Win Sivers Dr, Ste D","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Good sports bar.

I too initially found the staff to be very offputting and direct.  However I think this is probably a cultural thing and as my stay progressed I found them to be kind and actually very friendly.  I have been to many Dim Sum places in my life and all of them seem like I just entered the Soup Nazi kitchen, so I really think it's a cultural issue.  Either that or they want me to quickly order ten items, knowing I won't realize I can only eat seven, but by that time I will have paid for ten.  So being that I only order two or three dishes at a time, I just say no thank you and order at my leisure.\\n\\nNow onto the food......\\n\\nHaving spent most of my life in Los Angeles, I still can't get over the lacking character of Portland's China Town.  It's almost like all the Chinese left, yet the buildings remain.  The prices?  Wow!  A shining example is Har Gau.  In LA, $1.80 is standard price for this level and higher end items are $3-$4, here in Portland, I cannot find it for under $3, and  I can't locate any level of Dim Sum under $2.  So if any of you Yelpers know of places, please let me know.\\n\\nToday I ordered Sui Mai which is an open dumpling with ground pork and shrimp.  I found it moist and flavorful.  \\n\\nI also ordered an item which the name skips me, but it looked like Har Gau but had chopped shrimp and ground meat, probably pork and vegetables.  I enjoyed this more than Har Gau, even though I didn't try the Har Gau today.  \\n\\nI also ordered the Lo Main Gai which is sticky rice with pork and sausage and black mushrooms wrapped in Lotus Leaf.  Unfortunately mine was missing the mushrooms, which was disappointing.  The taste was respectable, but not as good as the ones a friend of mine makes.\\n\\nThe highlights of my order was the Chicken Feet in Black Bean sauce and the Beef Tripe.  The feet were tender, however the black bean flavor could have been more prominent, but I would order again.\\n\\nThe Beef Tripe was out of this World.  Very tender and seasoned with a ginger broth.  Lip Smacking good.  I also ordered a Green Onion Bun.  I thought the bun would be stuffed like pork or chicken buns, but instead the green onion was mixed into the dough with a sticky sweet glaze over it.\\n\\nBy itself, nothing special but dipped in the black bean sauce or ginger broth, Nom Nom.\\n\\nI did order two items to bring home to the wife and kids.  Potstickers and Har Gau.  The Har Gau didn't look gummy and the Potstickers were plump.  The family didn't complain, so I'm guessing they were enjoyable.\\n\\nI did try to order a few other items which I was informed were not available, so not sure if they didn't make them today or were sold out earlier, but considering I arrived at three in the afternoon and the place was empty, who knows.\\n\\nOverall my experience was enjoyable and I may return, but alas my quest for sub $2 Har Gau continues."},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I live entirely too close to this place.

We had a bit of trouble getting a seat since the restaurant went reservation-only in order to deal with demand, but we persisted and got a seat the next day. Worth noting is that there is a receptionist stand at the door, but no \\"please wait to be seated\\" sign or anyone directly manning the station, so it is a little confusing what the protocol is the first time you walk in. Should you seat yourself? No. You just need to be patient and wait for someone to come over and greet you. Both times when we did get help, it was from one of the owners who was very sweet, friendly, and helpful. \\n\\nOnce we got seated, the owner brought us drinks immediately, but then it took quite a while for our server to show up and take our order. This is a pet-peeve of mine. I don't mind waiting for food, but I hate feeling like I'm being ignored. Also, our entire party was very hungry, knew what we wanted coming in because we reviewed the Restaurant Week menu ahead of time, and we just wanted to order. They need to work on this. We were determined to enjoy ourselves after already trying once and then coming back the next day. Under different circumstances, I might have just got up and walked out.\\n\\nOnce we did order, the wait was again pretty long. Beginning-to-end we spent around two and a half hours in the restaurant and it wasn't because we were slow to devour our food. The appetizers, once they arrived, were both quite tasty and were gone fast. The szalonnasutes appetizer (roast bacon with tomato and onion on a piece of baguette) was the highlight of the whole meal. The smoky bacon was tender and delicious and paired perfectly with the onion and tomato. The other appetizer was fried plantains which my toddler loved and were well-executed. The sauce wasn't as good as Starliner Diner, but pretty close. We were not disappointed.\\n\\nFor entrees we got the stuffed pork chop (think chicken cordon bleu, but with pork) with glazed carrots and scalloped potatoes and the duck paprikash with hungarian stuffed pepper and cucumber salad. Both were the kind of comfort-food flavors we expected, but very well executed. The pork was seasoned well, the glaze on the carrots not too strong, and the potatoes were tender with some nice crispy exterior bits for texture. The duck dish was not the stew we expected, but rather a duck leg served with large mildly-hot stuffed pepper. The flavors were spot-on, but we thought the dish lacked a little cohesiveness. Still, good.\\n\\nFor desert we had the chocolate cobbler and palascinta (crepe filled with sweetened cream cheese) with hungarian cookie. The portion on the chocolate cobbler was great with no skimping on the ice cream. The crepe, less-so. Both crepe and cookie were small, and together the least interesting bites of the night. We would get cobbler again, but not the crepe.\\n\\nAll-in-all, we managed to have a good time despite the toddler getting fussy toward the end. The atmosphere in the restaurant is cozy. With the laid-back attitude of the place and the direct attention from the owner it kind of feels like you are eating at a treasured relatives house. The food was generally above-average and the prices are unbeatable.

I mean that as a compliment. I know if I show up before 6, I won't have to wait long for a seat, and the food will be generously portioned and good.\\n\\nThings of note:\\n\\nThe chicken fried chicken special is my favorite, but it's only available once a week. The white gravy is deliciously bad for you, and will probably pop off the\\nfirst button of your pants, but it's worth it. The chicken is lean and crispy, with a peppery crumble. \\n\\nThe Mac n' Cheese is quite creamy, but I WANT BREAD CRUMBS. It needs something to cut the taste of straight cream and cheese. Still tasty though, but I think it's impossible to eat more than a few bites without keeling over from stomach fatigue.\\n\\nThe complimentary corn bread is YUM! Perfectly soft and crumbly. I appreciate that it's served with melted butter. Nothing worse than watching a perfectly good piece of cornbread disintegrate because you can't seem to manage to rub the rock solid butter onto it.\\n\\nMy Dad loves the wood grilled chicken. I haven't tried it, but I've wondered at its size. It looks like it came off a Pterodactyl.\\n\\nMy Mom swears by the grilled chicken sandwich. A good option for those that don't want to gain an inch or two in the waist. She claims that it is \\"the juiciest in Boston.\\"\\n\\nThe buffalo chicken appetizer is very good, but if you are a wimp like me, ask for a refill of water before you start chowing down.\\n\\nThe grilled shrimp plate is quite good. You get 12 medium sized shrimp on two skewers with two sides for $18.99. The shrimp are good, but I wish they weren't covered in butter sauce. May I suggest some garlic or herb rub instead? Still, grilled shrimp are hard to find in the area, particularly with a price point less than $25, so i'll leave my complaining for another day.\\n\\nPro tip: For all plates except for the fish, you have to pay a surcharge to substitute sides. If you get a fish plate (shrimp included), you can substitute any side you want for no additional charge. (May I suggest the dirty rice, the mac n' cheese, or the sweet potato fries?)\\n\\nAnyways, good food if a wee bit over priced, divey atmosphere (old school rock on the radio however), good beer and cider selection.

We had to wait about an hour and I could tell he was wondering why I was waiting.  Usually if we're not seated somewhere within 10 minutes I'm ready to storm out of the place.

Both times we've gone it's only ONE waitress serving us, and she seems really scattered all the time.  When my food arrived and I asked for a bowl of rice, it took her 10 mins to bring it to me, after I had to remind her twice and both times she's bringing out more food (without my rice), then she actually said to me \\"ok wait, I only have 2 hands.\\" Wow. So I ask if someone else can bring it to me bc my hot entree was getting cold waiting for my rice. She eventually brings it to me and says she'll comp it (OK so I feel better). Then when the bill came she charged me $3.50 of miso soup on my bill which I didn't order. She said since my friend ordered an extra rice too (his meal was on my bill as well) she charged a lower fee to cover both his and my rice. I was like..Ok.. So you're not really comping my rice. At the end of the day it's not about a few dollars,  but if you know ahead of time there's a big group coming and the average per person spend is $40-$50, do a better job with your customer service and schedule in at least a second server to help.(that one server also took a few wrong orders)  It didn't help them either they we had spent our whole day at Shangri-La prior to going there so we went from superb customer service to very mediocre service at Kamei.

The permanent collection seems to be mixed in quality and the space is poorly used. I've been to a great many museums of varying fame (sometimes undeserved), including quite a few small ones and I don't think I've seen one as unfocused and poorly organized as the CMA.

Luke's was perfect as I needed a place that was quick yet fresh and delicious. I understand why people love their lobster roll as it has chunks of lobster meat all stuffed in a buttered roll, however it left me wanting it to be a bit larger and not as dressed with whatever spices/seasonings it had. I'm glad it wasn't doused or drenched in mayo but I felt whatever it was dressed in downplayed the freshness and quality of the lobster. It may just have been my roll though as it would come in waves of being overpowering as opposed to being consistently overpowering. Their Cole slaw was amazingly delicious and paired every nicely with the overdressed bites I got from the lobster roll. The slaw is not mayo-based but made with a mustard vinaigrette which made it really light in terms of a side item but still had that texture and crunchy factor you want.\\n\\nOverall, compared to the prices of lobster rolls elsewhere, I'd venture back to Luke's but maybe ask they cool it with the seasonings/spices/whatever it's dressed with. Just wasn't my thing, but still enjoyed parts of the lobster roll and cole slaw.

I ordered the cabeza in a burrito, and my beaux ordered a chicken taco and something with shrimp. By the time we got home, which is only a 10 min drive at best, her shrimp dish was soggy. My cabeza was far too chewy for my taste, so I couldn't stomach it. Also, our tacos were as dry as my azz, but I still attempted to eat it. We had tomatillo sauce in the bag, but it was not enough to help with how dry these tacos were. I thought that we had just gotten a sad trick played on us.

Upon entry, the staffs greeted us and they seemed so cheerful. Totally not expecting it. \\n\\nFOOD 4/5 \\nI had the chicken tenders with Ponko fries. Perhaps I did not read properly, I thought I ordered fried chicken tenders. They were fried but when I looked at them, I was not sure if they were oily due to that shine on the coating. When I took my first bite, then I realized the chicken tenders were not oily but had some sauce coating, Ponko sauce? They tasted like Japanese ponzu sauce. I never that into fried chicken coated with ponzu sauce or any sauce. To be fair, the chicken tenders were really tender and flavorful inside. I wanted to give the food a 3.5, but decided it could be my preference that I didn't really exactly love the tenders. \\n\\nAMBIENCE 4/5\\nI could not tell if this is a fast food or a restaurant. It is bright like a fast food, has a bar and a tv. The staff brought us our food, there is no place for us to clear the tray. Still the ambience is ok, casual and the place looked clean and new.\\n\\nSERVICE 5/5\\nThe staffs were all friendly and nice. Half way eating, one staff actually walked around with an iced water jug and refilled my half full water cup. I let out a soft \\"wow\\". I never expect that. It was very pleasant.

But against my better judgement, I dismissed these thoughts\\nand ended up having the worst birthday dinner ever.\\n\\nI wanted to make reservations for Saturday night but when I called on Thursday night, the phone kept ringing busy. Strange, right? My suspicions were such that I thought the restaurant had closed down. When I called again on Friday to see if they were in business and make\\na reservation, the woman told me she needed to check with the manager about my reservation.\\n\\nAt some point on Friday the reservation was finally made. When we arrived at the restaurant Saturday night, a server met us and sat us\\nimmediately. With 10 people we got three small tables smooshed together - it was a tight fit. As we started ordering drinks, we informed our server that we would need to split checks to which he responded \\"I'll try\\".\\n\\nIn the interest of full disclosure over half of the individuals sitting at the table have worked or currently work in the hospitality industry, so we A) know good service and B) know good food. That said,we were not a high maintenance table - in fact, anything but.\\n\\nThe drinks arrived very slowly. It was when the appetizers were served when hell broke loose. Two people at our table got their appetizers\\nAFTER their entrees arrived. The quality of the food slowly diminished. My soup lacked taste and was not warm, the salmon cakes sucked. The AMAZING (i'm using the word per other yelp-ers) calamari was fine, but the three sauces were disgusting.\\n\\nService continued to be slow - to the point where someone in my party got up and talked to the waiter. This eventually became the person who's entree they forgot to prepare. More on that later. \\n\\nThe server tried his best. Unfortunately, his confidence was shot and promised us that the items that came slow were comp'd and he apologized for the service. (I hate when people offer me free food in exchange for crappy service. This tends to be a white flag of surrender in restuarant with bad service. I would prefer to pay full price and tip well for good service then get a free, bad meal) This is the point when I would have expected a manager to come in and check in on us. But I never saw a manager ever which surprised me a bit. And for clarification purposes - this restaurant seats about 40. We were 20% of the entire restaurant.\\n\\nOur entrees came sporadically - but they were consistent. Consistently cold. My wilted spinach salad, that I asked for chicken to be added\\ncame with a warm vinaigrette. Neither the chicken nor the vinaigrette was above room temperature. My dad's chicken dish was cold. My friend,\\nwho's entree was forgotten, a cioppino, was the only meal that was presented warm. Except as the server sat it down, he spilled a good\\nportion of hot tomato broth on my friend (and he still charged him for it).\\n\\nSpeaking of cioppino, two individuals ordered cioppino and amongst the two plates - only one mussel was open. \\n\\nAt this point in the evening, we just wanted to get the heck out of there, there was just no point in complaining. Unfortunately, the restaurant had other plans for us - it took over 45 minutes to get our bill. At the end of the day, our server comp'd all our drinks and even a few of the appetizers that made it to our table late. But what he couldnt take back or discount was the fact that the group that came in to celebrate was drained from the experience.\\n\\nI think Gordon Ramsey might have a shot at making this restaurant decent, if not good. Until then, I'd recommend going elsewhere.\\n\\nNOTE: In fairness to the Fish Grotto, I did email the Manager about this review. When I send the email to the address listed on the website it got kicked back, so I called and got a correct email address.

My friend had a pizza which wasn't anything great, and my fiance had another bad pasta dish.

Unfortunately, our visit was pretty disappointing. I had the \\"Thai-style\\" schnitzel on a baguette, which really tasted just like cheap fried chicken with some sesame seeds and a little cabbage. Not very flavorful and definitely not reminiscent of Thai. Also, I imagined that the baguette it was served on would have the nice crisp crust of its namesake, but instead I got some Quiznos/Subway style bread that quickly got soggy. The kale salad I had on the side was literally just some fresh kale with a sprinkle of almonds and Craisins and no dressing at all - very bland. My partner's \\"Indian-style\\" wrap was definitely an improvement over my own sandwich, as the flavors actually tasted pretty good.

Our host was super sweet and laid on the charm, which I appreciated and made me laugh. We had about 4 different servers over the course of our meal, they were all attentive and very considerate. \\n\\nWe had shrimp spring rolls and lamb grape rolls for an appetizer. The shrimp spring rolls were ok, nothing too different or stand outish from most other spring rolls. the lamb grape rolls were delicious! I've only had Mediterranean style grape rolls and don't love them but decided I would give these a try. They are definitely not the Mediterranean style. These are filled to the brim with just lamb and spices (as opposed to just being filled with rice) and the grape rolls are surrounded by an assortment of pickled vegetables. Very good and would definitely get these again. \\n\\nWe then split the bun with \\"famous grilled grounded pork\\" and the Saigon shaking mignon with black peppered sauce. The bun was like most others I've had, fresh and light. The famous grilled grounded pork was not what I was expecting. I was pretty much just thinking it would be ground pork but this was ground pork that was then shaped into sausages and then grilled. It was different and definitely delicious. I'm used to shaky beef with just beef and onions but this one had spinach and tomatoes as well. It was good but i will probably try something new next time just to try more variety.\\n\\nFree dessert of chocolate almond ice cream and raspberry cake (asian style- so it's very light and not very sweet)\\n\\nThis may be my new favorite in-town sit down Vietnamese restaurant (other than Dua downtown- which will always have a special place in my heart just because it's so close to work)"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is straight up CRAZY!!!!

It seems like the perfect chill spot. If I lived down there I would be a regular for sure.  We rolled in at about 815 and the crowd was mixed with families and people just grabbing a late snack like us.

Pro tip: get it with Nashville hot and with lemon mayo, and then I also usually add cheddar but it's good either way! You really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu though. It's all good, but some of my favorites are the chicken parm plate, the Italian stallion, and fried raviolis with curry sauce. The sides are also amazing.. my favorite is the Mac and cheese. But the collard greens and cheesy grits are also sooooo good! \\n\\nThe atmosphere and service is also a major reason this place is so great.

Another thing to note was the speed at which food was delivered to our table after ordering it...I don't think we waited much longer than 10 minutes for our food after ordering.

It was a bit warmer than I wanted so I didn't get to try to the clam chowder they had but went with the Connecticut roll, which is just lobster and butter essentially. I have to say it's pretty good and satiated by craving. My favorite oyster/lobster roll house in Boston- Neptune Oyster is pretty unbeatable, but I felt like I was in the NE (minus the weather) after my first bite. I wish there was a tad more butter, but overall all the flavors were perfect and none of them overpowered the lobster. The ingredients were fresh and although expensive ($15 for just the roll), I didn't feel bad because the portion was a good size.

No problems so far.\\n\\nWhen I asked about happy hour, we were told it didn't start until 3pm. Okay. No problem. I ordered a margarita, figuring that I would have one drink before happy hour. The margarita was good, albeit a little pricey at $6.\\n\\nAfter finishing my drink, a friend and I ordered a couple draft beers. When they arrived, we were given bottles. Frustrating, but easily fixable. After trying for 10 minutes to flag our server down, we asked that they be switched out, and she took the bottles away. Our server returned about five minutes later, telling us that the bottles were $1 less than the drafts and that she would have to pour them out if we wanted drafts. My friend and I looked at each other and, feeling guilted, agreed to take the bottles. The whole situation was uncomfortable. I thought she was going to comp us the drinks when she returned, but instead she was looking to save Cautros money at our expense. It was unprofessional, but I didn't want to make a big deal about it.\\n\\nAlas, happy hour begins! Nothing could wrong, right? I hear the server next to our table describing happy hour specials, including $3.50 margaritas. Great! I order another margarita when our server returns. It tastes as good as the first, and I have no complaints.\\n\\nWhen the the check arrives after the game, I see I was charged $6 for each margarita. Odd. I heard the table next to us being told $3.50 margaritas, so I asked politely if she mistakenly charged me for two full-priced margaritas. Of course, I was wrong! Tuesdays are only local beer specials without a normal happy hour, she says. No where in Cuatros is this posted, and it certainly wasn't indicated on the menu. I am not sure that this is a correct interpretation of the restaurant policy, but she hadn't gotten a single thing correct all day. At the very least, when I asked about happy hour earlier, she should have said that this was a different happy hour than the usual. Frustrated, I decided to not argue and just paid my check and left.

That said, here are the facts and my opinions.  I was a regular customer for about two years and had been dining and drinking at Starky's with several different friends.  They generally have the same two servers who know my face and always bring a menu or ask if we want them since we always get food.  I've always been polite and generally tip around 30 percent as I worked in the restaurant industry for years.  Almost two weeks ago, a friend and I went in for dinner.  It was busy, but no busier than usual.  We got one drink, then wanted another drink and to order food.  The waiters kept talking to and serving every table around us, but every time we would look at them or try to flag them down, they would glance at us, then quickly look away and walk off.  It was very pointed behavior and obvious they didn't want to serve us.  It was also very embarrassing.  We did finally manage to get food but then had to go after the servers again to get our checks and to pay.  I still have no idea why they treated us that way.  It was totally different from every other time I've been there and also the worst service I've had in any establishment in Portland.  \\nI wanted to try and talk to their management or owner, but their website has no contact info.  Through a friend who goes there, I was able to get a name for the owner and could only find his Facebook page.  I sent him a message explaining our bad experience.  Though it shows on Facebook that the message was read, I never received any type of response.  So apparently the owners care nothing about their customers.  \\nThis experience made me think a lot about why I ever even enjoyed going to Starky's and I think it was mostly sentimental reasons and past good times with friends.  The restaurant itself isn't good. Most of the food is just average and the menu is seriously out of date, like something from the 1970's.  If you're on a diet or trying to eat healthily, good luck finding something here.  The decor looks like time stopped in the 70's or 80's.  The staff has always had a bit of an attitude, but they are usually really busy, so I always overlooked it, figuring their jobs were pretty difficult.

I say disappointing because the overall quality of the restaurant is exceptional, but they keep repeating the same mistakes every time I eat there. One mistake is that almost everything in the restaurant is dirty. The floor is always covered in stains and sticky residue, the silverware and cups have rust and spots on them, but my biggest gripe are the tables. Every time I go there I either have to either wipe the crumbs and puddles off the table myself or remind the manager or waiter that the table needs to be cleaned. The customer shouldn't have to continually remind the staff that the tables need to be cleaned before they sit down. Everything should be spotless before the place opens. I thought that was common sense for all restaurants. The wait staff themselves are friendly, but overall pretty inattentive. They seem to be always preoccupied with having conversations amongst themselves than doing their job. I hate being seated in the bar area because they always forget me and I have to wave someone down and remind them that I need my food and check brought to me. The food is good, but they're inconsistent with the quality. I order the Santa Fe Steak Tacos every time. Some days it's overloaded with meat, sauce, and veggies. Other days it looks like the chef just took a handful of random taco ingredients and mashed them together in a shell. I know that cooking is hard and the food won't always look the same every time, but the presentation is critical when serving food. I want to like this place more because the people there are nice, and the coupons are good. However, until they start being aware of their flaws and try to improve, this place will get a pass from me."},{"name":"Bam Pow Burgers","address":"5211 NE 148th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Y'all have the best fries I ever had!
