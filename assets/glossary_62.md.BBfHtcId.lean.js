If the Locus is the daddy of modern Main Street dining, the Reef must be its drunk sun-dog uncle who retired early to enjoy a life of heat and colorful drinks punctuated by paper cocktail umbrellas and plates of salt fish. Serving as good a brunch as it does dinner, it's gotten regularly busy pretty much any day of the week thanks as much to a good set menu that emphasizes the Caribbean flavour hinted at in the name, as to the patio, which is still the best one on Main Street, when the evening sun finds a path for its light down 26th Ave, and the rum and beer start flowing. \\n\\nIn the summer, be prepared to share one of the two large tables out front with some other patrons, empty those pitchers of Mojito and pass around the bottle of Matouk's hot sauce (to be used sparingly) when the food arrives.\\n\\nThe decor and ambience has not changed much in the past ten or 11 years since the Reef opened up, but it has earned a worn look which gives the exposed brick and chicken-wire walls, chipped bright paint and steel drums full legitimacy... at least so much as is possible on the fringe of the rainforest. It's about as Caribbean as you are going to get in this former British colony.\\n\\nMy favourites have to be the Jerk pork and the Trini Roti spiked with their scotch bonnet pepper hot sauce. I find the Reef's own house brand sauce a little sweet and lacking in real heat, but that's a matter of taste. A good value item is the Quesadilla, and you could do far worse than either the Island Thyme Chicken or the Bajan Fried Chicken.\\n\\nFor brunch choices order the Jamaica Me Crabby, since you are unlikely to be able to whip perfect crab cakes and hollandaise up at home. \\n\\nOn the downside, the service experience can be a little hit and miss. There are true exceptions to this of course. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the coffee. I sometimes worry about which Island of the Lesser or Greater Antilles the coffee is supposed to represent, as their drip is consistently terrible and has been for years. I imagine that Utah is to Reggae what the Reef is to coffee. But what can you do, the food is so damn good? \\n\\nOrder a Caeser or a pint, or a double Dark and Stormy if you know what's good for you.\\n\\nIf you're there on the shoulder menu (in between brunch/lunch and dinner) be prepared for more basic food options.\\n\\nOne of the best things about the Reef is its habit of presenting you with a complimentary little cute bucket of devilish fried dough known as Johnny Cakes. For dinner they come plain, to be stabbed in half and topped with butter. For brunches, they become a donut-by-any-other-name, and are packed with tart jam. Beats bread sticks any day of the week!\\n\\nSomething that bears mention is that often you can find a place for your dog on the patio. It's probably an unofficial policy, and one with suspect status in the view of health officials, but it has been a really great place for folks with low-fuss little mutts who stay below radar and just want to enjoy the sun with their little friend."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"You might feel a little guilt afterwards, but the food is tasty and good!

I also had the rhubarb soda--they have syrups and mix it for you right in front of you. Also: the fries are AWESOME with rosemary.

I stay at the Spring Hill suites by Marriott. This area is very limited for restaurants and if don't have a car and if you want to walk somewhere  for food, this restaurant will be your only option. I had gone during lunch during my conference that was taking place at my hotel, the place seems nice as you walk in. But it seemed understaffed for lunch time there was only one waiter for all tables that had come in, i sat at the bar to make it  easier and be and fast because of limited time. Had order a beer and a salad with chicken which I wasn't very impressed with. The waiter was polite and prompt to service, so it wasn't a bad experience  but wasn't impressed by the salad. So I decided to give another chance to the place, for my last night for dinner. I walked into the restaurant at 9:30pm on Sunday, the place had lights and there were only some people seating at the bar, as I walked in the guy at the end with two women said we are closed. They seem to be drinking and finishing dinner, so then I told him your door schedule says you close at 10pm and also looked at te hours on yelp. If not I would have not gone. My guess it was the owner or a manager who seem very busy entertaining and drinking. I felt like the owner could have said sure sit down we will take care of you fast since there is no one else. I understand that businesses especially restaurants are hesitant about taking last minute guest. But  930pm was still on time to be able to order and eat. Considering that the area doesn't have many options the owner should have been more accommodating.   He was abut rude and unwelcoming to his business.  Wouldn't come back, the food  wasn't great and disappointed from the treatment of the owner who was more worried about drinking and entertaining the women on his side. I would like to say the the only positive impression was the young waiter, that was working very hard  and understaff.  Seems like the business is not well managed."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good pork shoulder special. Cooked perfectly.

They try to make it look nice with a pink table cloth, but ultimately they should just invest in a suitable cart for a more positive impression.

I have also had the onion rings which I like because they are the kind with smooth batter not that crunchy kind which I hate because it's so rough in my mouth!  tip here, you may want to get these \\"well done\\" if you like a crispy 'ring because if you don't the batter can make them more soft and a tiny bit mushy on the larger rings.\\nThey also have a good root beer, local beers on tap( I don't drink beer but The person I went with  does), Mead wine that I have tried and it was pretty good. Not my cup of tea, but nice.\\nNow for a word of warning. Stay away from those \\"sliders\\". The person I went there with ordered them the last time we were there and I literally haven't heard the end of it to this day. She said that the patties were pre-made, she didn't like the aoli as the condiment she felt like basic mayo would have been more expected considering we were at a hotdog place, with a more laid back and American type of preparation  , or how there was so many toppings, the lettuce was more of a slaw than the traditional lettuce you would expect. She felt as if the type of  style of the sliders would've been better suited to a fancier restaurant( except for the fact that the meat was so low quality and obviously pre-formed frozen)  and was also not suitable to a slider because the way the topping were made it hard to eat such a small sandwich. \\n    She was really disappointed because she had been really excited to try the sliders because the hot dogs are so amazing that the sliders should be at least passable right? Wrong. \\n   They need to use real burger meat for the sliders, not pre- formed obviously frozen patties that she said were basically the same as those ones you used to get for school lunch but slider sized instead of regular burger sized.\\nBasically so far they should stick with their day job and drop the additions to the menu because it's better to nail one or two things well than have a bunch of mediocre things just to make your menu more extensive. \\nIf we had both come in and ordered the sliders and had never been there before we wouldn't have come back.

Your basic broth and literally the ramen packet type noodles didn't bring any stars to my eyes, but the dish wasn't bad.\\n\\n-pineapple pear tart: AWESOME! This was my dish. I stuck to just dessert because it was 9pm and my stomach can only hold so much in one sitting--but this was a beautiful balance of mildly tart with a sweet custard at the bottom and plenty of diced pears and pinapple to boot--yum!\\n\\n-3 creme-brule sampler: The jury was 50/50 on this one. Flavors are maple, brown sugar, and ginger. They are small, but also come with a cookie so it's worth the $8 for it---but everyone kind of rejected the ginger---just too much spice!\\n\\n-bread pudding: delicious! Not your conventional bread pudding, i would've liked it a bit more ooy-gooy, but overall it was good. Came with a side of creme that looked like ice cream...we were all sad about that one. \\n\\n-Chocolate cake with a side of ice cream: good, but VERY chocolatey, almost on an out-of-my-mouth level of chocolate-ness.

Apparently the chicken is marinated for 48 hours in buttermilk before they fry it up for you.  The entree comes with 2 pieces of perfectly fried chicken breasts that were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  There's no bones in the meat so it's amazing how they were able to keep the meat so moist.  The batter wasn't overly seasoned, but had the perfect amount of pepper and herbs.  We also shared the mac and cheese, which had a beautiful baked cheese crust on top.  The fried oysters were fabulous and even though I'm not a fan of fried oysters, this is another must order item.  I had friends try okra for the first time and they loved the fried okra here as well.  Screen Door seemed to use a different batter for each type of food and I appreciate that detail.\\n\\nThe next time I visit Portland, I will be making a stop here again.

The pork cheek was fork tender and bursting with flavor. The beans it was served with were undercooked, but still tasted good. The mushroom and grits toast was incredible. It ranks as one of the top two grits dishes I've had, along with the grits bar at Dogwood. So far, an excellent start to the meal.\\n\\nFor our main courses, I had the trout special with a corn risotto, my wife had the fried chicken, and our friends had the boulliabaisse and the shrimp and grits. I thought that the trout special had a slight bit of fishiness to it - but mixed with amazing sweet corn risotto, I didn't notice it at all. The fried chicken is (currently) my favorite fried chicken in the area - moist, tender, and with a perfectly crispy skin. There's little I can say about it that so many others haven't already. The shrimp and grits was also wonderful - had a great smoky flavor to it that I wasn't expecting. The only 'miss' for me was the boulliabaisse, which I just wasn't a fan of. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it just didn't come close to the other dishes.\\n\\nFor dessert, we split the pecan pie, which came out piping hot and absolutely delicious.\\n\\nAll in all, the one thing that surprised me about South City Kitchen was that, despite all of their fanciness, they serve very traditional southern food. They don't spin it too much, or add too many of their own twists - it was simply expertely-prepared and just the way it should be."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Christopher's is great!

The employees were fairly pleasant overall.  My coworker was highly disappointed that they did not yell \\"Welcome to Firehouse\\" when we entered... he left the building 4 times after we ordered to try and get them to \\"welcome\\" him, but they never did - but they seemed to great everyone else.  He was quite heartbroken and hung his head as we left - albeit with the children's fire helmet atop.  \\n\\nThe important thing though is the food.  I was not overly impressed at all.  The quantity of the large sub was almost overwhelming, but considering the prices are quite similar, I prefer Quizno's from a food aspect.  I had the club sandwich which was alright, but not enough to keep me going back here.  \\n\\nOverall, it was a decent experience but I can get better sandwiches (in my opinion) at Subway for less or at Quizno's for a similar price."},{"name":"Maraya At Sabrina's Restaurant","address":"8100 Crystal Clear Ln","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the best middle eastern food I have ever eaten!

We were immediately seated at the big table (we had a group of 5) on the platform. So it made us feel all smug and stuff :)\\n\\nAnyway, I'm really glad I came with people who knew what they were doing because all the ladies with their carts running around was quite overwhelming, but I have to say pretty exciting to see as well. There was just so much life in the place! I really liked the atmosphere. \\n\\nSo I can't exactly name all the dishes we had and we had about 10 or so. But I can name a few. Please note I do not eat pork or beef so I was very limited in my selection at this particular place's dim sum.\\n\\n1. There was a pork dish with rice around it and it was wrapped in a leaf. The rice was great! \\n2. Another pork dish with large flat noodles. Once again the noodles were phenomenal!\\n3. Finally a dish I can eat! Chicken buns. The buns were slightly sweet and there really wasn't enough chicken meat in the bun. But the bun was very light and I did like that about it.\\n4. We decided to go a little crazy and order chicken feet! Sounds disgusting I know, but it was pretty good. That's also because I like the chewy tender parts and I don't mind bones in my meat - most people were quite put off by it. But I liked it!\\n5. Silken Tofu with Sweet syrup - really good! We ate this as a kind of dessert and I was very pleasantly surprised. The texture was somewhat wierd and took a little time to get used to, but it was really good!\\n6. My favorite though, were these sesame covered balls with red bean sweet filling in it. OMG, uh-mazing! Had it not been for etiquette, I would have certainly eaten a good portion of that dish :)\\n\\nThere were 4-5 more dishes, but since I didn't really eat them (or couldn't) I do not remember and cannot review them.\\n\\nThe service was good. The ladies with carts came frequently and with plenty of dishes on their plate. That could also be because were on one of the main tables and right next to the kitchen as well.

I ordered the falafel, hummus and salad plate, which costs $9 or so and...get this, doesn't even come with pita bread. Ok, I thought, maybe the taste will make up for that...wrong. The hummus had so much tahini that it was nearing bitterness, not enough lemon for freshness, and really just did not deserve to be called hummus. Falafel was ok, salad was ridiculously bad...it seemed the vegetables had been sitting there for a while. All in all, my meal was definitely NOT worth the $10 I paid (including the side of one piece of pita)...I could go to Trader Joe's down the street and buy the ingredients of my meal and make it several times over (or go to Zaftig's across the street for a real meal) for less than I paid at Rami's.\\nTo top it all off, one of the guys working there (I assumed he was one of the owners because he mentioned running the restaurant) would not stop yelling. I thought it was just a loud voice, but then he picked up his phone to yell at one of his employees, and then again when that employee came in. Take it outside bud!

Peter (the Franklin Employee) spoke to one section of the line at a time and disclose to people when they should expect to enter the pearly gates and taste the fatty calf. That fatty calf that was so sacrifice by the Franklin gods and saturated in moist goodness like the land of milk and honey!!!! Peter told us whether we will make it in or not and if we were to make it by the skin of our chin, what time we were going to make it through the \\"Eye of the Needle.\\" He approaches us as a Doctor in a waiting room.

Worth the wait... BUT IT REALLY IS. I've lived in Texas for almost 6 years now and since our friends were visiting from CA, my husband and I decided it was time to take part in the infamously long Franklin Barbecue wait. Luckily, we also have friends that live in Austin, so they were familiar with the Franklin Barbecue drill. We got up really early before sunrise on a Saturday morning and arrived at Franklin Barbecue at around 6:45am. We were a little past the porch/building area and killed time by playing board games (Apparently the first person in line arrived at Franklin Barbecue at 4am!). I HIGHLY recommend bringing board games or anything really to help pass the time. It's great to come with a group of friends. Before we knew it, we were ordering our precious Franklin Barbecue and began eating at around 12:30pm.\\n\\nThere were 6 of us total, and we ordered a pound and a quarter of beef ribs ($23/lb), two pounds of brisket (One pound of MOIST brisket and one pound of LEAN brisket; $22/lb), half a pound of pork ribs ($19/lb), half a pound of sausage ($14/lb), half a pound of turkey ($19/lb), and half a pound of pulled pork ($19/lb). I can't even begin to describe the beef ribs (Only available on Saturdays guys!). They were so tender and juicy and had the perfect amount of peppery flavor. By far the best beef ribs I have ever tried EVER. And the brisket, holy f*. THE MOIST BRISKET IS OUT OF THIS UNIVERSE DELICIOUS. LIFE CHANGING BRISKET. Some say it's a bit too fatty, but I f*ing LOVED IT. It was so soft and tender with beautiful glistening edges. And the flavor... I can't even begin to describe the flavor. It was just so perfect and savory in every way. Everything else was just as delicious (Although I think I could skip the turkey and sausage next time), but the two that I'd say you have to try are the beef ribs and the brisket!\\n\\nI've never waited more than two hours for food, and I can't believe I am saying this, but Franklin Barbecue was worth the 5 and a half hour wait. AND I've been to so many BBQ places in Texas - Pecan Lodge, Lockhart Smokehouse, Louie Mueller Barbecue, Killen's Barbecue, The Pit Room and none of them come close (Well, maybe Pecan Lodge).

We ordered the following:\\n\\nSpicy Sliced Beef and Beef Tendon - The flavor was excellent.  Another plus is the server brought us a huge bowl of rice to go with it.  The cold dish and hot rice together was some yummy in my tummy....\\n\\nPork Chop on Rice - The pork chop was flavored well, but a bit over-fried and extra crispy.  I am not a big fan of it.\\n\\nZa-Jiang Bean Sauce Noodle - I tried a bite of it.  I am never a big fan of Za-Jiang noodle (just a personal preference thing), but have to agree that their version of it is really good.  My friend who ordered this dish really loved it.\\n\\nSzechuan Beef Stew Noodle Soup - This is the biggest disappointment for me.  My idea of a great spicy beef noodle soup has to be strong in flavor, spicy, soup just a little thick (while brothy still), lots of beef chunks, tendon that is really really cooked and soft, some cilentro, some scallion, etc.  This version lacks in flavor and spice.  The beef chunks were decent, but the beef tendons were not cooked enough.  So they were too hard to chew (and I have strong teeth....)  \\n\\nScrambled Egg & Sliced Beef on Rice - My favorite dish of the whole meal, surprisingly.  The portion is huge.  The mushrooms were soaked in the sauce and melts in your mouth. The beef was tender and with the eggs (in Chinese, translate to \\"smooth egg\\") indeed, very smooth.  Very easy to down the whole dish fast and realize later that you ate too much.\\n\\nWe also ordered two dessert dishes to share.  The mango cube on top of shaved ice and the red bean ice topped with green tea ice cream.  Both were decent, except the red bean can be cooked a bit more (they were a bit tough and being eaten with ice didn't help it).\\n\\nOverall, it is really a 3.5 star for me.

They have a lot of greenery as the name would imply as well as the cutest upside down ice cream light fixture. \\n\\nWe got in line and were asked if it was our first time here and it was indeed my first visit. I was then offered the ability to sample the flavors which I don't usually take advantage of but the flavors were so unusual here that I wanted to try them to see if I would like them before getting a full order. My standard flavor is chocolate chip mint and they did have a mint ice cream but there were so many other flavors that intrigued me. I ended up tasting the blueberry lavender, black ash coconut, and the orange honey saffron. The black ash coconut didn't taste very much of coconut to me so I went with a scoop of the other two flavors in one of their famous charcoal activated cones. Why charcoal I asked to which they replied that it has a lot of health benefits.\\n\\n I had my ice cream topped with sprinkles which you can have done for free with the Yelp check in offer. My daughter also had the blueberry lavender ice cream which she had topped with some intensely flavored cranberry crystals. After trying hers I decided I love them. You can also get basil or rose crystals as toppings. \\n\\nOther ice cream flavors that were offered on my visit included toasted almond and cherry, speculoos, raspberry sorbet, pandan, cardamon rose, ube, matcha, and black and white toasted sesame. I had to google pandan and ube to even figure out what those were. In case you are interested it is vanilla spice and purple yam respectively.  \\n\\nSome of the flavors are vegan, dairy, and gluten free. For instance the blueberry lavender was made with coconut milk while the orange honey saffron was made with cow milk. No matter what you pick it is delicious. That strangely colored black cone is pretty great too. Our two cones, both with toppings came to $13.50. The Greenery Creamery got me out of my ice cream rut.

This place may have your answer, and it has constantly been one of my primary choices in getting dim sum. Dim sum is a traditional Cantonese morning meal. Please be aware that this place may not have the best dim sum (if you are comparing to New York, Toronto, and San Francisco) but I believe they can do a fine job. Here's my review on most of the dim sum dishes I have ordered and eaten during my most recent visits with family and friends. \\n\\nSiu Mai - Probably the plumpest pork dumplings I have found in a dim sum restaurant in Boston's Chinatown. Probably my favorite version of this dish, and I think they do a great job. \\nHa Gau - The shrimp dumplings are also fairly plump. Very soft exterior on the outside with a nice tenderness from the shrimp on the inside. \\nLo Mai Gai - The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves are decently good, and I usually enjoyed the tender chicken, mushrooms and Chinese sausage inside. \\nLo Bak Go - The turnip cakes are cooked right in front of you, and have a slight crispiness on the outside, and a nice softness on the inside. It's not too oily, which is good. The dark sauce provided just makes the turnip cake even better. \\nCha Siu Bau - I usually get the steamed variety of the Roasted Pork Bun (white buns with a dark red opening on the top). It has a nice warm fluffiness on the outside and a good meaty flavor on the inside. A great choice if you want to start getting your stomach full. The baked variety (brownish gold buns) is not a bad choice, but does not have the nice and warm fluffiness. \\nHa Cheung Fun - The shrimp rice noodle roll is not a bad choice, did not have much shrimp, but the texture of the rice noodle and the flavor of the sauce was good. \\nSin Juk Guen - I do not have an English name for this, but this is usually called the Tofu Skin Roll. It's a great and tasty choice if you want a mouthful of a little tofu, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and some bits of meat. \\nGam Chin Tou - This is steamed tripe made with a little garlic sauce and some oil. A good choice for a light appetizer. I really liked the texture. \\nWu Kok - The fried taro dumplings are pretty good. Liked the slight sweetness of the taro, and the outside was pretty crispy. \\n\\nSo far, the dim sum has been tasty so far. I was with a group of probably 12 people on that day, we ordered 10+ dishes, and we only paid about $12 including tax and tip. \\n\\nOverall, this place will remain my primary choice for good dim sum especially when I am with my family or an entourage of friends.

The brisket is fatty on the inside and smokey on the outside. \\n\\nBrisket tips: \\n- You can get both fatty and 'leaner'. We opted for a mix of both. Oh, right, and they'll let you sample it beforehand, too. \\n- Us 3 ladies shared 1.5 lbs of brisket and it was more than enough combined with the other stuff we got.\\n\\nOther meats:\\nSausage is delicious, but we liked Black's BBQ's sausage better.\\nRibs were definitely worth trying. \\nTipsy Texan Sandwich is also a must - it's pretty much impossible to eat like an actual sandwich, so we just busted it open with a knife and had at the sausage, brisket, coleslaw, and pickles with our fork. \\n\\nPLEASE DON'T FORGET TO GET THE BANANA BOURBON PIE!\\nIt's more like a baby tart, but it was so welcome after the meat.

That's when I decided to check out Fat Matt's Rib Shack. They have a simple menu with ribs, chicken or a chopped pork sandwich as a Main choice then a handful of items such as Rum Baked Beans, Mac n Cheese, Collard Greens, Coleslaw, etc as a Side. I ordered a Combo which is a 1/4 Chicken and a 1/4 rack of ribs for $10 which is served between two slices of white bread wrapped in paper. Then I ordered two servings of the Mac n Cheese (I was really craving that, don't judge me) at $2.50 each and the Rum Baked Beans for $1.60. They put the sauce for the ribs&chicken on the side which is a spicy BBQ sauce. When I asked if they had a sweet sauce, I was told they only had that spicy one. It is tasty but a sweet sauce offering would be nice. The chicken was so delicious and tender. The ribs were meaty, tender, falling off the bone and slightly charred. They were pretty good. The Mac n Cheese was as good as I imagined when looking at the pictures of it. And the Rum Baked Beans were spot on. \\nAs far as ambience goes, it's a little spot that is lit with red lighting inside that gives off this old juke joint feel that is quite welcoming and relaxing. \\nThe customer service was ok. The young guy working the register was adorable but not that proficient at customer service. However, it was close to closing time and he gave me the impression he was new and tired. The gentleman that works the dining area offered me a drink while I was waiting for my to go order to be completed, which was nice. He actually pulled out my chair so I could sit, which was very nice. He was very friendly to me and attentive to the other customers as I watched him gliding effortlessly to and from each table. He did his job well and I appreciate him for it.\\nThis place will be a spot I will frequent. I would've gave them 5 stars but the customer service at the register needs to be stepped up and a sweet BBQ sauce option should be available for those not wanting that spicy kick. Other than that, they're pretty damn good!"},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I am going to go ahead & say that Sonsie was awful.  I went this Monday & brought clients in for lunch.  Our waiter was a complete slacker & seemed really clueless about when to come over to our table (which was very infrequently).  He went to great lengths to avoid eye contact.  The service took so long that by the time our waiter came to bring us dessert menus my client was practically getting up to leave.  I had to just hand him my credit card.  The food was disappointing as well.  The calamari was served room temperature (by a runner, not our waiter) and I had a frisee & asparagus salad.  The frisee was soaking wet with water as if they had just washed it & not dried it & the vegetables were limp & wet.  The dressing was flavorless but probably b/c it was so diluted by the residual water that soaked all the vegetables.  It's really hard to mess up a composed salad but they managed.  One of my clients barely touched his food.  It was embarrassing.  Additionally, the restaurant was quite empty, prompting my client to wonder about the slow service.  Probably the most offensive thing is that the people at Sonsie seem to think they have a pretty good thing going on there & just don't seem to have the capacity to understand what good food & service is.

I have been whining about my disappointing search for quality Mexican cuisine in New England and they suggested we try Masa. It is actually Southwestern cuisine so not quite what I was looking for but a lot of people make that mistake. \\n\\nIn the midst of a very snowy winter, parking is hard to come by unless you use the valet. We had planned to cab over to Wally's for some jazz after dinner and did not want to use the valet service. It turns out we did not have a choice but to valet. The valet service was friendly and efficient so points for that! \\n\\nThe layout of the room is incredibly inefficient and they have packed in way too many tables into too small of a space. Don't they realize that Americans are obese? The also need to put some thought into sound dampening. It is an incredibly noisy place. The combination of the cramped space and the cacophony detracts from the experience. It needs to be remembered that dining is more than just the food (which I am getting too) it is also the experience.\\n\\nNow to the food, we got the Pork Chicharonne Tostadas and the Shrimp Diablo Tamale for appetizers. They were both delicious, creative and elegant. We are off to a roaring start here! For the main course, I had the plantain crusted catfish with grilled scallion aioli, sauce creole and buttermilk hushpuppies. The composed bite of the catfish, ailoi and sauce creole was delicate and surprising as all of the flavors complemented each other and did not overwhelm the catfish. The hushpuppies tasted good but they were so dense they could have been used by David to slay Goliath. My wife had the oven-roasted, bourbon glazed pork tenderloin, winter spiced plantain flautas, sage mole, onion relish. The pork was cooked perfectly. The bourbon glaze was very good. If the sage mole made it to the plate it was overwhelmed by the bourbon. The flautas were way too sweet for either of our tastes. We split the chocolate trio desert which was molten chocolate cake, chocolate flan and habanero truffles. The desert was back to the standard set by the appetizers. The molten chocolate cake was not quite molten but that is probably due to it not making it to our table right away based on the level of service and the consistency of the cake when we got it. The flavor we fantastic! The chocolate flan was very good but it did take some getting used to the texture. The habanero truffles were perfect, strong chocolate flavor with the habanero burn floating at the end. \\n\\nThe service was mediocre. Several times we found ourselves with empty water glasses, she made no effort to engage us and we were ignored for long stretches of time. We had more interaction with the waitress handling the table next to us. \\n\\nI would give a 2.75 rating if I could because 3 is a little strong and 2 is too harsh.

Does that mean it's not good? Hell no. This stuff is pretty damn good! \\n\\nLet me preface by stating that I lived in Fukuoka, Japan for nearly 8 years. For the uninitiated, Fukuoka is the epicenter of tonkotsu ramen, AKA Hakata ramen. I've been to literally hundreds of ramen shops in Japan, the vast majority being tonkotsu ramen. From Ichiran to Ippudo (the 2 big dogs in the Hakata ramen trade) to the small mom and pops, to the yatai lining the river near Canal City, I've slurped and sipped the best of the best so I do consider myself a bit of an authority.\\n\\nOK, so is it bad? Like I stated above, Hell No. Tatsuya Ramen has it goin' on. That being said, their signature dish, their tonkotsu ramen, falls a bit short on the authenticity scale but is still a very worthy bowl of noodles. How do you know you're getting the real deal? The stink! Yep, the stink! You can't get within a 100 feet of a good ramen shop without smelling the goods floating from the shop. At first, this stink drives many away it's so overwhelming, but one soon learns that this is where the good stuff resides. Second, the real stuff has a greater depth of flavor, a richer, broth. Tatsuya's tonkotsu ramen is going through the motions but doesn't quite hit the mark, That being said, I'd still drive out of my way for a bowl 'cause it's that good!\\n\\nMy wife, who is Japanese, and I both agree that Tatsuya's miso ramen was much more authentic than is their tonkotsu. She had the mild and loved it while I had the miso-hot and just about flipped! The Japanese in recent years have taken a hankerin' for Chinese spicy noodles (ramen) known at tan-tamen. The miso-hot is a dead ringer for tan-tamen albeit a tad less spicy. This stuff is good, has an excellent level of spice, is full of minced pork, corn niblets, and just overall goodness. This, more so than the tonkotsu, is why I make the long haul to Austin for ramen. \\n\\nOK, so there must be some negatives... First, the shop is small which means you must wait unless you get lucky or something. Every time I have gone, I have had to wait least 35 minutes and when it's cold outside, well, you get the picture. The shop definitely needs to be relocated. Second, I always get keidama (extra noodles) and they have always been undercooked (too  al dente). And that's it. Those are the 2 drawbacks to Tatsuya's.

We usually like the Olive Garden -- comfort food, pasta, and all.  This location sucks, however.  The server first brought our appetizers before the salad, then brought out the salad, then forgot the breadsticks.  Breadsticks are an essential part of the Olive Garden experience in my opinion.  She did remember to eventually bring out the breadsticks after glancing at our table while walking briskly by a few minutes later (\\"Oh!  I knew I was forgetting something\\").  So then our entrees appear (when we were still eating the salad and breadsticks), and my fiance's entree is completely wrong.  The server that brought it to us continued to walk away even after my fiance tried to stop her.  Maybe she didn't see him, I'll give her the benefit of half a doubt, but I really think she just didn't feel like stopping..... It takes us 5 more minutes to flag down our original server who then stared blankly at the plate of food for awhile (\\"Oh, uh, ummm, I guess I put in the wrong order, ummmm\\").  She didn't seem to have a clue as to what do next.  Here's a shot in the dark, put in the CORRECT order of food right away???  So my fiance, who was being very polite, got tired of waiting for the server to respond, he suggested to her that if she didn't want to put in another order for the correct meal, then just bring us two glasses of wine on the house.  Good.  Done.  Okay.  But then the Manager stops on by.  \\"Sorry sir, we can't give you wine on the house because that's against the law in Massachusetts.\\"  So the manager says they're putting the appetizer on the house.  Well, this appetizer costs $6 and came out before the salad and breadsticks, and c'mon now, that's really not giving up much.....I really think he oughtta have offered up a free entree at this point....but anyways, we agreed because it seemed fruitless to argue.  Needless to say, my fiancee really didn't like the incorrect entree he got--it wasn't even a pasta dish--and he's not one to complain.  Really, what they should have done is let him keep the incorrect dish for awhile so he would at least have something to eat while I had my dish, and then bring out the correct dish as soon as possible.  The service just SUCKS here though!!!  AAAaargh so frustrating.  We weren't expecting stellar four star service or anything, but we definitely expected something a little nicer (and fairer) than what we received.  The next time we really want to do an Olive Garden/shopping type afternoon we'll go down Route 24 to the Olive Garden over there not far from IKEA.  This experience was a real downer since we are actually really big Olive Garden fans.  Thanks a lot South Bay Olive Garden, for letting us down when we have vehemently defended Olive Garden to our many foodie friends."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I loved my food so much.

About 5 minutes after my drink showed up, they received their food.  Our food was still 10 minutes away. They were pretty much finishing up when ours arrived. \\nAs I said, the food was good.

It was always during a kind of off-peak time in which I passed by, and every time I walked by, I always thought in my head \\"man, this looks like the type of place I'd love,\\" because it was small, had a quaint and comfortable looking patio up front, and from examining the menu online, they had a freaking burger with doughnuts as buns.\\n\\nFor the longest time, I wanted to go Cypress St., and typically I'm not afraid to go try a new place completely by myself and look like the awkward sad guy with no friends, but for whatever reason, I couldn't bring myself to do such with a place I was building up in my head.  I wanted to go here with my friends, but since we're all typically scattered around the Metro area, sometimes that's kind of difficult to pull off.\\n\\nSo I pulled the birthday trump card, and declared Cypress St. was where I wanted to meet up, and a plan was put in to motion.  With friends in tow, it was more appropriate feeling to be there, in good company.  That's the kind of experience I envisioned with Cypress St; a smallish, local-y feeling place, to enjoy good company and eat unhealthy food.\\n\\nThe patio was packed, as it wasn't hot and it wasn't cold, but the skies were looming, so I had no problem with sitting inside, to which there was plenty of seating for my group and I.  It's a dim and sexy-lighted atmosphere inside that doesn't feel too hip, yet felt a twinge higher class than a dive.  Large televisions adorned many of the walls where we were seated, and the employees were bustling and busy, which is a mark of good business, IMO.\\n\\nWe were greeted quickly and presented menus swiftly, and the beer began flowing immediately.  Supposedly, they rotate their taps on a regular basis, and I liked trying a few things I'd never drank before.  Most of them were pleasing to my taste buds, and worth refills.\\n\\nBut the Sublime Burger - I often fall back onto a description to where tasting something is like a religious experience, but the Sublime Burger was definitely up there.  It's like a boulder rolled out of the entrance of a cave, and the Sublime Burger rose out of it, to bring salvation to the world that is my stomach.  Some people I told about the Sublime Burger thought the idea was bad, but to them, I gave them my best Starbucks impression and told them that their tastebuds were clearly inferior.  \\n\\nThe sweetness of two Sublime glazed doughnuts is subtle, and actually works to your favor, because it brings your tastebuds to expect more sweet, before the explosive flavor of the burger, cheddar, bacon and onion bursts into the picture.  I ordered medium, and got a perfect medium burger that was dripping with juice, flavor, and just the right pinkness inside.  As if it needed to be said, it did not last very long.\\n\\nI used a veteran maneuver, and while eating my Sublime Burger, I positioned the fresh-cut fries underneath the burger, so that the juices and crumbs and bacon bits all fall onto the fries.  So that when you're eating the fries, which are fantastic on their own, the occasional glaze shards or a chunk of bacon, or soggied by burger juice almost brings you back to cloud nine.\\n\\nAnd it was just $12.  I guess for a burger and fries, that's a little on the high spectrum, but (crap), they could have written \\"$12 + slap in the dick\\" and I'd still order it without hesitation.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was fantastic, and worth the wait and met all my expectations.  Hopefully some of my friends felt similarly, and would be willing to go back without any strings attached.  I drank a ton, ate a heavenly burger, and had a good time on my birthday, I couldn't have asked for anything more.\\n\\nExcept, my one objection - for whatever morbid reason, the place turned the TV nearest to me from my beloved Atlanta Braves game to Grey's (expletive) Anatomy.

This cowfish is located in the middle of CityWalk the Food and Shopping portion of the Universal Studios Park. This play is packed and has a lot going on so I would suggest you only venture this way if Universal is where you will be going for the day. It only took about 30 minutes to get seating for 6, and there was a nifty SMS that comes when you table is ready. I really like that idea because there is alot to do in the area so while you wait for the table to by ready you can shop for minions t-shirt for even grab a beer. Yes, they will let you walk around with a beer and Cowfish will even let you take your beer to your table when you get seated (that happened). The inside of the space is separated into different floors the decor is really blue modern with a oriental feel. They have a TON of staff and we were addressed and served promptly! Im sure they have to turn over many tables there and all of that really shows as even though we didn't feel rushed, we were in and out pretty quickly. As for the food, let me start with the drinks, I had a Bourbon and Bacon drink with a strip of candied bacon in it. It was very good. Nothing like something you would have at a traditional cocktail place but they did use Buffalo Trace one of my favorite brands so it was definitely not bad at all. One of my co-workers got a Bloody Mary...Well 2! Those things were a sight to see! This was a traditional but as a straw they give you a hollowed out jerky stick and the drink has a slider burger on a stick as a garnish for this... YUM!.. Next time i might just need to only get Bloody Marys like my coworker did. As for food we decided to do a buffet style Burgooshi experience. So ordered all of the burgooshi types so we call call try them. For those of you who dont know what Burgooshi is, think of it as sushi with a heavy burger influence. So you see it like you would a normal sushi maki roll but some of them have burger toppings and elements in them. Our 2 favorite were the Taste Explosion and the Prime Time Lobster Roll. The taste explosion is what you would get if California and a gourmet burger had a baby. When you eat this you get a ton of flavors and burger meat! The Prime Time Lobster Roll is a Lobster sushi roll (Delicious!) with a slab of prime rib on drapped over it... Over the moon good.

However, I gave this rating because there have been times (including this one) where I order drinks (not just plain coffee) and I get the wrong order. Fortunately, this does not happen often but it happens often enough for me to give this rating. I enjoy coffee and go to plenty of other Starbucks locations and coffee shops.

They had classic burgers,  fries and other American cuisine there. I remember eating a burger and at the time, it was the best fast food burger I had had. As you can imagine, I was disappointed when making my first Disney trip as an adult to find that Pecos Bill's had changed their menu to be more southwest focused. \\n\\nSince then I've been looking for a new fast food fave at Disney. I had tried Pinocchio's Village Haus and they didn't have the burgers I was looking for. Casey's on Main Street didn't have the burgers either. Luckily, on my most recent trip, one of my sister's friends recommended Cosmic Ray's and said they'd have everything I was looking for. She sure was right! This place is right up my alley. All my favorite foods, a soft serve ice cream place right next door. This is now my new favorite QSR in MK!

Shouldn't have been no more than $10. \\n\\nAll in all, my favorite type of meal at one of my favorite locations in the country! They have classic items that are sure to please many!

Actually, I come here pretty regularly with my family to get drinks (about 3x/week). However, I can't say that I'm happy with my experience here. Reasons listed:\\n-They will make you wait 15 minutes if you want boba in your drink. This is probably due to their lack of staff or lack of knowing when to properly prepare their ingredients. This may be a food place but if you come a couple minutes after they open, don't expect their ingredients to be prepped. This problem has also often occurred to me several times during the day. It almost seemed like asking for boba in my drink was an inconvenience for them because they're always out of it. I eventually moved onto lychee because I knew that would always be available. \\n-When the boba is ready, it's not always made right. \\n-The staff are 50/50 when it comes to customer service. I'm not sure if this lady is the owner or manager but I see her very often. Her face is generally pretty sour and she barely makes eye contact or talks to you. I've also witnessed her scolding her staff in front of customers and it makes us very uncomfortable. It's not just her. I get the vibe that the staff just really don't like being there based on their looks behind the counter. I don't expect them to be robots... but at least make us customers feel wanted. Or smile?\\n-I've posted this as a tip but I feel like it's necessary to put it on here too. They do not combine punch cards. I would think with the amount of times that they've seen my face, that they would trust that the stamps and their initials on my cards are legit. I'm not perfect. Sometimes, I'll leave my punch card in my other purse, in another car, or at home. In that case, any normal person would just ask for another punch card thinking that they can combine it later. Nope. You better hold onto that card with your dear life because they will not honor the other cards. You need to fill that single card up in order to get your free \\"drink up to $4\\". I guess I've just been too spoiled by Dutch brothers. \\nLike I've said, I'm still a regular here but I'm not sure how much longer that'll be. I can easily spend an extra 50 cents and go down the road to their competitor (whom I will not list) but I still like their food and drinks.

Despite my reservations (I had an egg sandwich the previous day and wasn't sure I wanted another one), I was glad I committed after seeing another biscuit go by for another table. So. Good.

Our first impressions were very positive- the restaurant is very big, clean and modern and it was very busy!  \\nWe ordered specialty roll sushi, appetizers, and green tea smoothies (which were delicious)!  The food came out very fast and was quite good!  The service, however, left something to be desired.  Our food was brought out by at least three different people, and one of the appetizers never came.  Toward the end of our meal, the manager stopped and asked about our meal.  We told him the appetizer hadn't come and that we didn't want it at this point, because it was too late and we were full, but wanted to make sure it wasn't on our check.  He left to take care of it, and neither he nor our waitress approached our table for the next 25 minutes- at which point a young boy came to the table to give us our appetizer.  When we explained that we already said we didn't want it, he left awkwardly.  We continued to wait for a very long time, trying to make eye contact with the manager/waitress, who were helping tables all around us but seemed to be ignoring us for some reason. Finally, one of us approached the manager yet again explaining that we hadn't received our bill, hadn't been asked about getting our food wrapped up to go or anything. He took care of gathering the food and the plates immediately and shortly thereafter, our bill arrived with the appetizer having not been charged but also with an additional 15% off. So, I guess things ended decently, our bellies were full of delicious sushi and we eventually got to leave.

I was starving when I ordered. This made the night's events even more painful.\\n\\nsequence of the night's events:\\n\\n6:04: order special, including pizza, wings, garlic bread and pop. The woman who is also the manager and who also inspired zero confidence in me from the get go due to shoddy communication skills told me they do not have blue cheese dips for the wings.  I was surprised. I asked how this could be. She explained that they never ever have had blue cheese sauce. I am quite sure I have received blue cheese dressing in the past, but let's just pretend for the sake of this review, she is right.  She then says to me, shit you not, that hot wings come with ranch. HUH?? me thinks not.  She then asks me if I want bbq wings or hot wings. I replied, hot.\\n\\nShe tells me it will be 45 minutes.  She does not say it is busy and does not say anything else.\\n\\n7:08: as i was starving and already had no faith in the woman with whom i ordered, i called to make sure things were ok as it had already been over an hour.  The kid who answered said, \\"he is on his way, it will be 5 to 10 minutes maximum.\\" I double check that he knows that the delivery guy needs to call me. He says yes. I ask him what number was written down.  He give me the wrong number. I say, that is the wrong number, he says, oh, yeah, my mistake.  I ask if he suspects it is a mistake the delivery person also might make.  He has a non-memorable response.\\n\\n7:18: I go downstairs to wait in the lobby. I do this to save the two minutes of going down the stairs once the delivery guy calls I am hungry as fuck. It has been ten minutes since the kid's promise of ten minute max. So i call.  The kid recognizes my voice and smartly transfers me to the original woman who is unfamiliar both with honesty and blue cheese. She PROMISES it is within five minutes away and that it is very busy (if only she had told me it was busy when i ordered the pizza i would have been more able to make proper pizza decisions).  I will get $2 off as some kind of remedy.\\n\\n7:27: I am highly unpleased and call back.  I am again told the guy must be there any minute.\\n\\n7:35: I call again. After gently explaining my displeasure, am told I will get 50% off. \\n\\n7:42: we open the boxes of food. The wings have NO sauce on them. NONE. they have NO flavor. NONE. i called back and the kid, no shit, said, well i know they are the right ones as the bbq ones are sticky.  I tell him, there is NO sauce on them.  He says they must be the hot ones.  I cannot believe how ridiculous the entire experience has been and hung up.  I then began to drink wine at 1838 the speed. does this kid think that wings are cooked from raw already with sauce on them? His sense of logic is both startling and one that makes me scared for future generations. Because they  are not sticky, they must have the other sauce on them, despite me telling him there is no sauce and no flavor.\\n\\nand the bottom of the crust is soggy.

There's a decent selection of burgers on the menu.  They pride themselves on this, and in fact, if you're not in the mood for something grilled and stuck in a bun, you're going to have a hard time finding something to eat -- basically just appetizers.  The main menu consists of a few beef burgers, a bison burger, a couple chicken, one ahi, one mahi, one portobello and one turkey burger. All of these proteins are available in a build-your-own-burger menu as well.\\n\\nThey get a middle-ish rating on inventiveness.  I saw nothing that was completely new to me, but there were a couple of standouts where I could safely say I had only seen it once or twice before, so that's good. Included in that list would be the Paradise City, which is a burger topped with cajun spiced shrimp, and the Stairway to Heaven, topeed with foie gras. The problem with the more unique options was their insane price -- a Paradise City runs $19 and the Stairway runs $25.\\n\\nI ordered the Thunder Road ($14), which was basically a bacon cheeseburger with BBQ sauce on the side, with skinny fries.  The fries were okay but were almost immediately cold, so if ordering those, it might be best to lean on them a little heavier toward the beginning of your meal.  The burger was delicious, cooked and seasoned nicely with thick, beautiful pork belly bacon on top.  It was definitely a good burger, no complaints at all in that department.\\n\\nMy wife was in the mood for a bison burger, but when she saw that it was $20 for a burger with just tomato jam and cheese, she declined. Even selecting the build-your-own option was something like $14 just for the 1/2-pound patty. Someone forgot to tell B&B that bison meat isn't particularly expensive or hard to find.\\n\\nIn fact, let's talk about the build-your-own menu for a minute. First of all, none of the burgers on the BYO menu include a side, so you have to order your side separately (an extra $3).  They charge $9 for just a basic beef patty on a bun, $14 for that bison burger. \\n\\nThen it's an additional $1.50 for cheese. \\nWant a sauce? (chipotle ketchup, mayo, pesto, bbq, etc etc) 75 cents each.\\nThen it's 50 cents per \\"basic\\" item (arugula, white onions, red peppers, pickles, etc)\\nBacon: $3\\nChili: $4\\n\\nYou get the idea. This means that a plain cheeseburger and fries with nothing extra on it will cost you $13.50. The exact same thing at Oblivion is an even $10, and in my opinion it's a better burger (and definitely better sides!) It's hard to see any value in the build-your-own-burger menu at all.\\n\\nWe did enjoy what we got, and the service was good. But I have to echo the comments left by so many others already:  these prices may work fine for you back at the South Beach location, but you need to adjust your expectations when you're surrounded by student housing here in Orlando.\\n\\nEven with the approximately 40 gazillion televisions all showing the World Cup while we were there, I don't think more than four tables were ever occupied.  This is exactly what Culpepper's looked like when we visited, and we all know how well that turned out.\\n\\nI wouldn't come back to pay full price again, but we got some sort of coupon as we walked out (I didn't look at it too carefully). If it's any good I'll consider coming back to use it.

Delicious, and I polished off the crisp yet juicy chicken in no time. My friend loved her eggs benedict, and South City Kitchen converted her to becoming a grits fan.\\n\\nAll in all, you can't go wrong.

I realized after the fact that they were probably closing early for Rosh Hashanah, but if there was a sign indicating that, it was not obvious to the patrons and they had given no indication they were closing early.  No one behind the counter would make eye contact with me, so I assumed we were not going to be making our to-go order after all.

He called us assholes. We called him some things that were more creative. He got what I'm guessing to be a manager and someone else. He lied and told the management that we called HIM an asshole... though this would have been accurate... we replied to him referencing US as such. When i said that, he yelled \\"F$&@ OFFFFF!\\" I looked at the manager for a co-sign on his inappropriate behavior, but didn't get it.

I asked her what side was most popular or what she recommended....and I settled on the collared greens.\\n\\nIt took about 5 minutes before my meal came, nice and fast. They offer squeeze bottles at the table with different BBQ sauces to add to your sandwich. I went with the sweet sauce which tasted like your prototypical sauce you can get at any BBQ place.\\n\\nOverall, the sandwich was just ok for me. I found the pork to be on the \\"fatty\\" side and had to spit out a few pieces when no one was looking, lol. Also, the collared greens were extremely salty...bordering on inedible. But me being Mr. Nice Guy, I just let it go. In the end I wasn't totally satisfied and thought to myself I may have to get something at the baseball game.\\n\\nTough to say coming here for the first time was just an ok experience.

The links, though hard to cut with plastic cutlery, were my favorite.\\n\\nIt was all delicious and, we agreed, \\"worth the wait.\\"  But would it even have been possible to come to a different conclusion after such a wait and such anticipation?

However, the table we were placed out was in the smaller room in the back that already housed 2 large parties (over 10 people for each party) and another family dining. It was LOUD in there to the point where we almost had to yell at each other to hear what the other was saying. This also became an issue when it came time to ordering, as the waitress completely messed up our order because she clearly could not hear us properly. We had ordered 2 burgers, both with fries, and cut in half so we could share the other half of our burgers with the other and taste the different options. When the food came out to us, we had one burger split between 2 plates and an extra side of fries instead of each of us having our own burgers. When we corrected her and said we ordered 2 burgers cut in half, she apologized and said she would have the second burger order put in and it should be ready within 10 minutes. We ended up receiving the same burger that we already got after 15 minutes, rather than the different burger we had initially ordered. The tables around us were also receiving incorrect orders from a different waitress, so I know it wasn't just us that received the incorrect food.

She recommended the chorizo as a substitute, as apparently most people who like the al pastor like the chorizo. Seeing as how I wasn't as fond of the steak as I could've been the last time I had it, I went with her suggestion. \\n\\nThe chorizo is OK. More of a ground pork with seasonings similar to al pastor, but the consistency and texture is way different. Also, the problem as I mentioned in my last review has still continued - the vegetables are all concentrated in the center and not evenly distributed. Overall, the burritos are large and you get a lot for what you spend ($8 as of 12/2017). Still my go-to place for Mexican food as it is still good and convenient for me. See my initial review for my impressions on the steak and al pastor burritos.\\n\\nAnother note: someone had mentioned that the workers were rude in their review. I haven't had that experience, but have had the opposite - they have always been very nice and joke around with me while I order and wait for the order to come out.

She had called earlier in the week to make a reservation for a Saturday evening at 7:30. The staff also stated that 75% of the party had to be present in order to be seated. Pretty typical policy, especially on a Saturday night, which is fine. However, due to the event traffic downtown, the majority of our party got delayed and our table was given to another group who showed up in the meantime. I'm not sure what the purpose is in securing a reservation if it does not guarantee a table once the party is present. The attitude of the hostesses and staff was also very unapologetic and nonchalant throughout the process, which did not improve anyone's mood. In all, we waited about an hour and a half JUST to be seated and watched people flock past us to tables the entire time.\\n\\nOnce we were finally shown to a table upstairs, we were given two free appetizers as a compensation (guac and queso -- both just average). I ordered the spinach enchiladas, which started out okay, but I was unable to finish them due to the overpowering quantity of goat cheese. \\n\\nOverall, I can't say I would go back to No Mas unless it was for a quick drink between mealtimes.

With a second: All the food and drink had balance. \\n\\nMy fiance and I went on a Tuesday evening past the usual dinner rush. We were met with quick and attentive service. \\n\\nDrinks: I ordered a Metropolitan, she ordered a sangria. The Metropolitan was well mixed and didn't smack of alcohol taste. The sangria, though, this sangria was some of the best we've had, period. Enough so, that it comprised our second round. To add, we also received some complimentary jello shots. While I wasn't much for them in my college days, these were awesome.\\n\\nLocal Mixed Greens Salad: The roasted kale on top gave the salad a distinct character and played with the dressing. I sometimes feel that some dressings are a coverup that you are eating a plant. This helped bring out the flavors.\\n\\nBlistered Shishito Peppers: With a sweet sesame and garlic flavor, these went between mild and sweet and a pleasant burn. We ate these simultaneously with the salad.\\n\\n Miso-Sake Glazed Haddock: If I were to ignore everything around the fish, this is a wonder of sheer technique, alone.

If that doesn't make sense to you then just go.  Hopefully it will.\\n\\nJust a few notes:\\n- Your burger doesn't automatically come with lettuce and tomato; you need to ask.  This annoys me a bit because there is always someone at the table who didn't know to ask so everybody then has to wait.\\n- Fries are okay in my book.  The basket is fairly large so I would split one between two or three people.\\n- Onion rings are shoestring.  I'm usually pretty split on this, but they get thrown on my burger.  They are then a HUGE plus.\\n- Tons of condiments on the table.  Any place that leave Sriracha on the table gets another star in my book.\\n- They call their hot dogs \\"shafts\\".  Giggle.\\n- They do serve pitchers of beer.  Yes it seems like a lot ($13 for BL which really isn't a bad price, or $18 - $20 for anything decent), but they're large and if you were going to order a few beers anyway, it will save you a few bucks.\\n- Private parking lot.

Other places may occasionally be as good, but never better. It's otherworldly every time I've been (probably half a dozen times now): something no other killer brisket smoker has ever managed, in my experience. It's very difficult to do brisket right, not far from impossible to do it this well even once, and a miracle that he does it day after day. If you go here and wait forever and then walk away without trying the fatty brisket, you've made one of the biggest culinary mistakes of your life. And if he didn't do brisket this well, I would recommend avoiding the place altogether, because of the wait, and the fact that the rest of the menu isn't quite of the same standard. As for the pork ribs, they run from amazing to just good. He hasn't nailed the consistent level of tenderness he's managed with the brisket. The pulled pork ranges from awesome to bland and a little dry. The sausage is okay, but it's made elsewhere, so IMO it's not worth stomach space.\\n\\nThe last time I was here on a Saturday, they were serving beef ribs. I got one, and it was awesomely tender and tasty (almost as good as the fatty brisket). I shared it with a friend and couldn't imagine taking one on myself. A worthy complement to the brisket, but time will tell if it sticks around.\\n\\nAs for the wait, it's a real bummer these days: 3 1/2 hours the last time I went, and it was cold and rainy out. A lot of times I hear people say waiting in line is \\"part of the experience.\\" Well, maybe for an out-of-towner who wants to eat at a famous place, and maybe even for a local who's never been before. I recommend trying it at least once just so you can see what near-perfect brisket is like. But for someone who used to be able to wait an hour or less when the place wasn't world-renowned, the wait is a huge deterrent.\\n\\nAs much as I hate to admit it, Franklin's popularity is in large part a function of it being the first joint within the city limits to churn out 'cue at a really high standard (it's shocking that it took so long for someone to take advantage of the void), and in that regard it towers over its forerunners in popularity among insulated Austinites like the Salt Lick and especially Rudy's. In truth, places in small towns scattered throughout Central Texas have been serving 'cue at or near this standard for more than a century, and many of them are still around. I won't say you'll find better brisket than Aaron's, but you can find it as good at the right place on the right day, sometimes with better pork ribs, and usually with superior sausage. And although you may have to drive a bit, you won't have anything like this absurd wait in line. Seriously, try Cooper's in Llano or New Braunfels, or Snow's in Lexington, or Kreuz, Black's, and Smitty's in Lockhart, or Louie Mueller in Taylor, or John Mueller Meat Co in Austin if you don't want to drive. Once you see that this place isn't nearly as superior as the difference in popularity would indicate, maybe the line will thin out and I'll be able to go here more often. And I'd be happy to."},{"name":"Windsor","address":"4889 Mackenzie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"One of the most impressive display cases I've seen in Vancouver.

This another one of my favorite spots to get lunch when I'm at work. I usually go to their food truck by Kendall station but when the truck isn't around i head to their storefront. It's almost ALWAYS busy midday but they definitely have improved  in getting the orders out in a reasonable amount of time(5-7 min at rush hour). I LOVEEEEE their rosemary fries! They are always made fresh with the perfect amount of salt and rosemary. They have one breakfast sandwich that is so simple yet sooooooooooo tasty ( boiled egg, tomatoes, vegan cheese in a pita bread). Chicpea fritter is their most popular sandwich i would say and when you try it you will see why! It's worth the 6 bucks because its packed with flavor, texture, and its super filling! It can get quite messy eating though ( esp if you like to add sriracha sauce to yours like i do). Always ask about their seasonal sandwiches, they are usually the MUST tries on the menu and only stay on the menu for about 4-6 wks. I just had their Blue Oyster Mushroom sandwich today and was amazed on how much it tasted like fried chicken! I am not a vegetarian and i don't like mushrooms but i was willing to try something different ( with a lot of convincing from the friendly staff btw)....i was NOT disappointed at all!

Make reservations in advance as this has become the top dining destination in the square and rightfully so.  The food is gourmet but in a more casual/trendy atmosphere. This is definitely the coolest atmosphere in Harvard Sq. with a very vibrant bar scene and a great industrial design for the restaurant space.\\n\\nAt first glance, the menu and dishes in this place seem really expensive but 2 dishes is enough per person and that doesn't end up being much more expensive than other restaurants in the area with this type of quality food.  There was a lot of thought and effort put into the items on the menu.  They all have great ingredients that work well together and most dishes are dishes you can't get anywhere else.  Every dish was a hit in one way or another and we tried 5 of them.  Stand outs were the slow roasted beef neck (so tender), and the market crudo (scallops this night, fresh with incredible flavors including a kimchi aioli).  The 60 degree egg also impressed with a slow yolk run that blended in to all the wonderful veggies on the plate.  The clams were the only miss which were extremely tough and chewy and also overpowered by an extremely heavy sauce.  The rest of the clam's dish was excellent however, the heavy sauce was the perfect complement for the lumps of pigs tail scattered throughout the dish and the grilled bread on top.  I would love to see this dish with something other then clams. The tapas style is great for sharing food and sparking conversation but some of the plates are difficult to share as they may have a thick sauce (the clams) or need to be deconstructed to move to your plate.  You typically would never see this food served as tapas style but it is.  While difficult to share, I feel this is the best way to eat out with other people.\\n\\nThe service was a bit stand offish the night we came, but it was fine for us because we weren't in a rush and wanted to talk. Plates came out as they were ready and we weren't overwhelmed by having all plates come out at once. Possibly my biggest pet peeve at any restaurant is bringing out multiple hot dishes at one time which forces you to rush through your food before it becomes cold, and once it's cold it's no longer good.  Alden & Harlow know how to pace the meal and that's very important for this tapas style they are going for.  We will definitely be back to try more of the dishes and get some of our favorites again."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Goodness!

I ordered it despite my aversion to collard greens (which I did sample and enjoy, but I saved my room for the more appealing chicken and potatoes).

This is a good and hearty meal that blows the average Southern fare out of the water.\\n\\nDessert: \\nThe Sticky Toffee Pudding also arrived in a generous helping, but I was nearing full capacity at this point.

I headed here with an old flame and it was the perfect place to catch up.  The atmosphere was laid back and mellow.  The servers were more of the mind set that if you needed them, you'd flag them down.  This was good for us because it gave us time to chat.\\n\\nWe both tried the pint, which was a decent brew for a microbrewery.  We also had the queso dip because we got hungry after all that time in the sun.  Speaking of sun, the location is great.  It's nestled between Georgia Tech's campus and Midtown.  It's a neighborhood bar/restaurant all the way.  While I was there, I saw people leaving to go home to and walk their dogs then come back and pick up right where they left off.  There were also shouts across the patio to familiar faces that were out taking a stroll through the hood.  With the warm weather that we tend to get teased with in the Spring, this was a good place to soak up the sun and enjoy a pint of brew.  There's a stone fire on the patio for when the sun goes down.\\n\\nThe interior was not at all what I expected.  The bar took up more than half of the space.  It was somewhat modern but, still had the bar feel which was a bit contradictory.  There were a few flat screen TVs with the game on.  It just didn't seem to fit.  It was as if they had a great concept but, had to bend under pressure and add the TVs.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a descent spot."},{"name":"Black Fire Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"8594 Palm Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"If you're expecting Texas de Brazil then go there, don't spend the money here.

The potatoes were pretty standard but they did not taste like rosemary. \\n\\nThe star of the meal was the Caf√© de Olla which is Traditional Mexican Coffee with a hint cinnamon and cocoa.

I'm hooked. I'm a fan of this Brazilian casual dining chain because of the friendliness of the staff and the fantastic flavors of the food. It's a cut above your usual order-at-the-counter deliver-at-the-table dining experience. Real plates and metal flatware accompany plastic tumblers and paper napkins in this very clean, modern eatery.\\n\\nMy daughter and I visited here at my insistence. Having eaten at their other Orlando area location I knew she'd like the food. For starters we had Pao de Queijo, little yeast bread rolls with cheese inside. They are firm, not gooey, and the yeasty aroma coupled with the flavorful cheese made them a delight. Definitely will order them again. We also had the Yucca Sticks with Sriracha Mayo. I like yucca prepared Cuban-style, the sticks are kind of blah for me. My daughter liked them a lot. She has yucca sticks frequently at restaurants in Universal's Citywalk but said she preferred Giraffas'. We both agreed the Sriracha Mayo was yummy, and not very spicy. Give it a try, you'll thank us.\\n\\nFor her entr√©e there was the Brutus Burger, paired with seasoned fries. She loved the flavor of the burger but felt the fried egg was superfluous, the richness of the egg detracting a little from the strong meaty flavor of the beef, bacon, and ham. We both agreed the fries were quite tasty with a nice size and texture.\\n\\nOnce again, I had the Picanha Steak platter. I may never order anything else, that's how delicious it is. I complemented it with chimichurri sauce and black beans, like last time, substituting brown rice and grilled veggies for the white rice and farofa of my Mills Ave experience. The steak, ordered medium, was more like a typical medium rare, so understand that when ordering. The outside was grilled to perfection and the inside was a uniform, dark pink, edge to edge. Nicely done, grillmaster! Paired with the chimichurri sauce the flavor is outstanding, a foodie value if there ever was one. I think the black beans at Mills Ave were slightly better, but that may have been more the way they were served than anything else. Here they came in their own bowl, with lots of the pot liquid. At Mills Ave they were stretched out laterally on the rectangular plate next to the rice, allowing some of the liquid to seep into the rice making the beans less drippy to the fork. Still tasty.\\n\\nWe finished off the meal with one dark chocolate Brigadeiro each. (Free with Yelp check-in!) These are small candy truffles with a flavor and texture that had our eyes rolling back in our heads like a shark biting into fresh kill. OMG! These are dangerous! We both agreed that taking home a 24 pack would be to become addicted so we resisted the temptation. But, oh, the rich flavor! Just enough to end the meal with a memory of heavenly deliciousness.\\n\\nVisit Giraffas. I think you'll enjoy it a lot."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Yum yum and triple yum.

I am addicted to the Crispy Chicken, but my friends both went for the Chicken & Avocado. I'm really not a fan of Cole Slaw and usually avoid it (if at all possible), but it was just so good.

Had the owner been like the waiter, it would have been 1 star easy. The ambiance was good, as was the location. There are no booths, but there are couches. Though you sink in them, if you try not to, you still slide back into the same place. \\n\\nWe had some vegetarian pasta with not much in it beyond the pasta, tomato soup, mixed greens salad, chicken eggplant bruschetta, and a lemony custard cake thingy that was the first listed on the dessert menu, grandmas something or other. I had to ask the waiter for the dessert menu in the beginning, middle and end of the visit. The only thing that tasted good was the chicken, it was fairly juicy and tender.The eggplant it came with was sour, the pasta was just OK. The Olive Garden pasta is the best. Everything was too salty. The worst was the soup. I explain why in the next paragraph.The original menu called it Zuppa. When I asked the waiter, Joshua, what the soup was, he simply said a tomato soup. I asked, \\"like a creamy tomato bisque?\\" and he said \\"yes.\\" So I ordered it. Portions were on the small side for everything but the soup.\\n\\nWhen the waiter, Joshua, came to pick up our plates, he didn't ask why I barely touched the soup. So I told him politely that I didn't like it and asked what was in it, he told me it had bread in it. I said, the menu only said \\"Zuppa\\" and you said tomato\\" that's all I knew, bread inside the soup was not mentioned verbally nor on the menue. Also, when I ordered the bruschetta, I ordered it with bread on the side rather than in the dish, I had said verbally it was because we didn't want to risk soggy bread, the same idea applies here.... \\n\\nHe then told me I had three menu's in front of me that said it included bread IN the soup & that there was no way I didn't know. (Why would I order something I knew I didn't like, wet bread in the soup, that made no sense & it isn't the standard for tomoatoe soup) Well, only the little side menus had this info, not the main menu. And since the small side menu was hand written and not easy to read, I focused on the large menu. He then went to get the bill, charged me the full amount, brought me MORE of the small menues in an attempt to prove he was right and I was wrong, and began to eat at the bar behind me. \\n\\nAt this point I asked to speak with someone else. When he sneered at me after saying okay, I thought uh oh, this may not be any better. I tip well even if waiters make mistakes but are nice about it and treat me with respect. This guy had an attitude from the start. So naturally it pained me to pay the automatic 18% tip that was about eight dollars. The owner came out, he asked me if I had eaten much of the soup. I said, like 2 spoonful's, and that he could check. Weird question. I explained to him that I didn't feel it was right to be charged for something that not only did I not like, but on the main menu didn't indicate the soup included the soggy bread inside the soup. He then asked what I wanted. I thought that was clear? He didn't apologize for anything, but wasn't rude at least. So I got my $4 back, but at that point it was the service that had me frustrated, the measley money was just the principle of the matter, doesn't matter if it was four bucks or forty. \\n\\n*****Despite not loving the taste of the food, (also, one of my peeps had major gas for a loooong time after eating there, not a normal thing for them), I would not have bothered even doing a review had the service been decent, just because it's a locally owned place, so if I can't write something positive, I may not at all. But that level of service made me run straight to the computer! It's the worst restaurant experience for me in a long time.*****  \\n\\nOlive Garden....you look even better to me now.

You must make the pilgrimage and pay your respects. We knew about the line. Our group on multiple occasions came too late in the morning to get food, but this time, we were ready. We brought beer, Settlers of Catan (oh yeah we did) and set off earlier than any of us wanted to be up. But we made it. We ate breakfast, drank beer, mingled with the folks in line. All in all a great experience. Also, the lady who tells you you'll get food at XX time, don't doubt her. She does that shit every day and she was accurate to the minute. We got brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs, sausage and turkey. I also got pie but we forgot it and so I pretend like I didn't buy it. The pork ribs were a sleeper hit. SO GOOD!! The turkey was bomb. The brisket, I know this will offend people, was not all its cracked up to be. It was a good piece of meat, but my heart still belongs to Pecan Lodge. Good food though, great experience! We even got to go up in the smoker and wander around watching the pit guys tend to the luscious briskets.

I wish I had a bottomless stomach so I could keep eating. Knowing full-well that this is the best BBQ in Austin, I pre-ordered online (check website) about 6 weeks in advance for a 12:30pm Sunday pick-up. Pre-ordering is DEFINITELY the way to go, but know that you need to plan ~1 month ahead for a coveted prime weekend slot. You must also have a minimum 5lb order and pay a $75 deposit to hold the order. If you do not arrive within your 30min window, your order will be forfeited, so don't be late!\\n\\nWe arrived right on time and had no problem pulling into one of the pre-order parking spots in the back next to Legend Coffee. Unlike the equally delicious but much less efficient le Barbecue, Franklin's pre-order pickup is on the back side of 11th street in a sea-foam green trailer. There was hardly anyone there so we experienced barely a 5 min wait while they packed up our fresh BBQ. In the mean time, we were offered FREE drinks which included ice-cold Mexican Coke, soda, and waters from their coolers. We also got a whole loaf of bread, onions, pickles, 2 types of sauces and hand wipes along with our order of 2 lbs Ribs, 2 lbs Brisket, 1 lb Pulled Pork, Potato Salad, and Beans. \\n\\nUnfortunately there really isn't anywhere to eat on site for the pre-orders, but we took it home to enjoy. And boy, did we enjoy! I had the best ribs of my life... I mean the meat just falls right off the bone with a gentle push. The seasoning was not too salty, yet extremely tasty. The brisket was equally tender! I can't decide if the brisket was better than some of the other favorite ATX BBQ joints, but we're splitting hairs at this point. Pulled pork is never my favorite piece of meat, but I always feel like it's necessary to order and it was definitely worth it. Sides were solid and sauces were solid but unnecessary because the meat was so darn good on it's own. \\n\\nWhile the most important part of this review is the quality of the BBQ, which was a homerun all the way, I was also equally impressed by how easy the pre-order process was. No lines, no crowds, free drinks, great service tucked away from the standby line... just BRAVO, well done. From an operations standpoint, I think Franklin really has it figured out. It's impressive to see a BBQ place that gives you both that authentic mom-and-pop feel, while also running a seamless and professional operation."},{"name":"HOTLIPS Pizza - Pearl","address":"721 NW 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The worst thing about this place is the reviews.

The second best I've found were at the Broken Barrel in Palm Bay, but they use the dry rub too, which makes the wings a bit salty. \\n\\nLouis' wings offer Hot, Mild, and Honey Gold. The Hot offers a real-smokey heat that brings even non-wing-fans into the fold. If you're not in it for the heat, the Honey Gold are delicious and are based on their golden BBQ sauce. These are a big hit when I bring them to people who've never had them. They are my girlfriend's go-to-wing. \\n\\nOne great advantage to the hot wings at Louis', is the new ability to order a side of hot wing sauce with your beef sandwich. You can buffalo that beef as much as you want... my mouth waters just thinking about it. How it's not on the menu yet is beyond reasoning. \\n\\nIf you go for the wings, get half your wings golden and half hot. I like to start with the heat, then cool down a touch with the golden, then go back for some heat. 50 wings costs $29, and I think 20 are $13 or something like that. \\n\\nIf you want a different wing, or a buffalo beef sandwich, head to Mims and chow down on smokey goodness!"},{"name":"Junior's Diner","address":"2920 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"the food is adequate but given the changed and improved cliental in the area to barrow a phrase the food needs to be kicked up a notch Ho hum veg omelet potatoes rye toast  soupy  grits and 12oz OJ for $13.00 come on we can do better"},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Well, had a very awesome decor, very similar to what i'm used to in Brooklyn (first time in Boston), but as a server myself, the service wasn't the best, kind of slow and they got my order wrong, but it happens, and the toast bread with caramel i ordered was so-so although the steak brunch dish was amazing!"},{"name":"Sushi Oyama","address":"5152 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"I like this place!

Twenty minutes later, I received a text stating that our table was ready. \\n\\nWe were promptly seated and given the choice to sit inside or on the patio, which we chose that patio. \\n\\nOur server recommended the jumbo lump crab cake hash and said that the chicken and waffles is their most popular dish. We ordered both and added on a side of the shaved brussel sprouts. The hash was definitely our favorite.  The waffle was the fluffiness waffle I have ever had and the chicken had this little kick to it. It was all really delicious, but I have to admit that I really don't understand why this dish is so popular.  The brussel sprouts were pretty good but too lemon-y for our liking. \\n\\nWhile their dessert menu looked pretty delicious and the service we had was fantastic, we didn't leave with any desire to return.

My personal favorite is the pulled pork. It is incredibly tender and juicy.  I'm by no means a BBQ purist because I think sauce is a staple and Franklin's has an array of sauces.  The pork bbq sauce is perfectly tangy to where your salivary glands go into overdrive the second you put in your mouth.  Their most talked about sauce is their espresso BBQ sauce, which is definitely original, is rich, thick, with the slightest bit of espresso bitterness at the finish.

I can't confidently give this place 5/5 because of a few minor issues, but I'll start with the good.\\n\\nThe big atmosphere is relaxing. You feel like you're on vacation. A friend of mine who has visited mexico has told me that this location reminds her of restaurants there. So this is a positive. They have booths tables and chairs. \\n\\nThe wait staff is too cute.. lol. It has to be said, there's a lot of cute guys that work here. \\n\\nThe menu has a large variety of food items.this isn't your \\"Speedy wit beans please\\" type mexican restaurant with combo #3 and the $2 lunch special. Side items include refried beans, black beans, spanish rice (complete with corn peas and other goodies might I add..), cooked spinach with garlic and olive oil, and a few items made with a variety of rooted veggies. I'm sorry I can't say more than that. \\n\\nthe menu has everything protein wise that you could dream of.. steak, chicken, shrimp.. I... don't suppose I saw any pork, but then I'm not much of a pork eater save for bbq joints. \\n\\nYou get a LOT of food here, but you pay a good price for it. Expect $10-15 per person, but also expect to get a take-out box if you're going home, or once again feel guilty as the waiter takes a plate loaded with food away from the table as you're simply too full to eat any more. \\n\\nI've had the chicken tacos both times, the first was with refried beans, the 2nd with black beans. Both times I enjoyed the side dishes and the chicken tacos. The 2nd time I tried one of the rooted vegetables made into fries.. it was quite delicious! \\n\\nNow.. lets see.. I do have to tell you why no 5/5 right?\\n\\nWell our first experience was meticulous. The food came out fast and the waiter was very prompt and professional. He would swoop in with a fresh glass of water almost un-heard. If you weren't paying attention you may not immediately notice. \\n\\nthe second time.. not so much. The wait staff seemed.. occupied.. despite not being as busy as before. We had to wait quite a while before being able to order. \\n\\nthe other item I'd have against them is the inconsistency of the food. The first time I had my chicken tacos the chicken was in large clearly defined chunks of lean meat in the tacos that I could easily see and eat. I enjoyed them. The second time the chicken was pulled and almost seemed to be minced.. though this isn't the right word to use. There was also a bit of fat in the chicken that was.. rather concerning, though unavoidable I SUPPOSE. \\n\\nThe first time, this restaurant was clearly 5 star, but with my return visit, it's lost a star. Sorry guys! It's still a wonderful place and I would highly recommend going. There's a number of delicious looking menu items for you to try.. I suppose finding a reason to be unhappy is my fault for not trying the variety, but then I'm a bit predictable at times."},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The Hummus appetizer was very good but we had to order more pita (at an upcharge) to finish the tasty, spicy spread.

Other reviews here will give you details of the menu items so I won't go into that.  Parking and waiting are an issue but when you expect it, you shouldn't be too surprised and the food makes it worth the wait.  Generally speaking the service has been OK, not bad and not super but certainly acceptable.  Except on our most recent visit, a saturday night... our waitress' response to how busy it was, she folded her arms and stated it was a dreadful day almost with an attitude that didn't allow for any light-hearted banter.  \\n\\nWhen she left with our drinks order, all 7 of us at the table looked at each other and mentioned (for a moment) how awkward the interaction seemed.  We left it alone only for more issues to be presented each time she approached the table, which left a bad taste (purposeful pun) in our mouths.  No smiles, no real interaction with our \\"mr funny guy\\" who always gets people chatting/laughing.  We are a happy bunch of people, out to celebrate a birthday and enjoy the good food.  We made excuses for the waitress; long day, difficult life, tired, previous rude customer, etc.  Still, her attitude didn't change so the service just didn't get any better.  \\n\\nThere were more significant issues that came up by the end of the evening.  Without going into details here - since I will send a detailed complaint to the management - our resolve was to reduce her tip significantly for poor service.  A couple of our party noticed the waitress demonstrating her disappointment by 1) complaining to another seated customer and 2) fussing to a co-worker about the tip she got for a table of 7.  \\n\\nI felt offended to hear that I/my party was being discussed in such a way.  I even considered that she was in a bind and just needed every penny she could get from tips which left me feeling quite bad that we all had limited her 'wage'.

Over hyped or not, you need to try Franklin BBQ. Their sauces are great, and in my opinion, the brisket is on a whole other level. Of course, you'll end up using a whole day just for Franklin (including the post meal nap), but it's a worthy investment every so often. \\n\\nComparing my experience four years ago, the line is definitely longer, but the wait is relatively comfortable. You can borrow lawn chairs for free as long as they're available, and if they're taken, I found that they were available closer to 11am as people got ready to go inside. The staff will come around with drinks for purchase, and after waiting for about three hours, they even served a small sandwich for free as a snack. You can BYOB, but several folks purchased beers at the liquor store nearby. Legend Coffee is right there in case you need caffeine. \\n\\nThe worst part of the wait is when you get to the ramp heading into the door... it's at least 30 minutes from entering until you order.

My wife and I decided to give it a shot.  Let me paint the full picture for you because if you like artisan, delicious pizza you need to get off your couch and hit up this place.\\n\\nThis place is attached to a convenience store and from the outside it looks questionable.  The parking lot has not been paved in a while and my wife and I looked at each other with nervous faces as we pulled in.  She said go in and check it out and then let me know.  I have to admit I was nervous.  But I walked in and there were a bunch of people waiting for pizza.  None of the people had three eyes or tails or anything weird so I told my beautiful wife to come in.\\n\\nThere are 4 bar stools and two tables inside the place.  One table sits 2 people and the other table sits 4 people.  So unless they are empty you need to order your pizza and pick it up.  Oh they do have outside seating if it is nice outside too.  When you order pick up they try to make it so it is fresh so the pick up time is very specific but soooo worth it.  Also they provide water but if you want any other drink other than water you can bring it from home but no alcohol aloud.\\n\\nWe ordered three pizzas.  Each pizza is about a ten inch pizza, so one is enough for one person but we were hungry...  If you look at their menu on line we ordered their numbers 18, 15 and 2.  They were all fabulous in their own way.  The crust was crazy good and lite too.  The people who work there were extremely friendly and it made for a really nice experience.\\n\\nIf you like wine too the pizza has some very nice flavors which if we had brought it home it would have gone great with a glass of wine or a nice beer of your liking.\\n\\nGet off your butt and go to Bono!

Cuz im a fatty.\\n\\nI had:\\nFajita w/ Chicken and Steak\\nCapirotada (Mexican Bread pudding with raisins and apples, along with chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream)\\n\\nThe fajita was actually made very well, the steak and chicken were both extremely tender. The seasoning/marinade was done very well, so that the meat was well flavored, but still had the natural flavor of the meat (especially the steak) shine through. The meat was sliced in thick strips definitely reflected American tastes (skin on chicken breasts, ny strip steak). \\n\\nThe refried beans that came with dish were also really good, They definitely were not traditional refried beams, but instead they were actually cooked with the mexican cheese integrated into them. The other standout was that the fajita came with a corn and bean salad, which was delicious when eaten both by itself and in a tortilla with the other toppings.\\n\\nSpeaking of tortillas, No Mas did not cop out and just buy pre made tortillas. No these are significantly better. they are made in house (you can actually see the machine they make them with), and though they are flour tortillas, they were surprising delicious and didn't get hard and nasty after they got hard. Awesome. They didn't become soaked through when I loaded them with toppings, and they were tender and amazing easy to bite through. \\n\\nOverall the fajita was very well executed. Definitely not over cooked \\n\\nThe bread pudding was also delicious as well. it was moist and served warm. The raisins and apples definitely came together very well, and the vanilla ice cream went very well with it.\\n\\nOHHH, and the complementary salsa and chips are VERY good. IN fact so good that I finished the entire basked (remember I'm a fatty), and got 2 bowls of that absolutely delicious salsa. YUM. The salsa is good on tacos and fajitas.\\n\\nSo in the end, the food here is good, the portions are large, but it's just too expensive for Mexican food in my opinion."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"What can I say about this place other than yelp needs to add another star because five stars does not do this place justice"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I had to repeat myself 3 times what I wanted on my pizza, because he was distracted with jokes behind his back. \\nI know this is a cheap pizza place, but some customer service, and better slicing would be nice. \\n\\n(They contacted me and made things right.

I think that Fox Bros is my favorite BBQ joint in Atl solely because they do more creative things with BBQ but Fat Matt's is true blue. I'm not even necessarily a rib guy, but the ribs are spot on here. You can get a rib sandwich for under $5 or a half rack for around $10. The char and smoke one these are absolutely perfect, while they don't sacrifice one bit of tenderness. I can not sell these ribs hard enough.\\n\\nThe pulled pork and smoked chicken are also admirable contenders. They both always come out moist with a good smoky flavor, which is a problem with other BBQ joints on these dishes. The sides are excellent, if a little small. The sweet potato pie is so good.

So for over $20 we were expecting a lot more than they delivered. \\nThey also offer other selections at other prices, for different sizes and for different amounts. Where it gets fuzzy is there is no consistency in their classification of a portion. How are they determining the sizing? What is the difference between a medium or larger portion compared to 6, 12, or 18 pieces or 5 and 10? Asking the service staff did nothing for clarification. With all their hand gestures and the consultations with one another, nothing was made clearer. \\n\\nYou are able to choose from a drum or wing, or a mix of both. No other fried chicken place allows the picking of parts at no extra cost. I liked how they called their all drum plates \\"Zabu sticks\\". Initially I thought they were bread sticks, by name alone. But it is sides you want, you have slim pickings. Your choices: pickles, steamed rice, a chicken or garden salad, and coleslaw. Clearly you come in for the fried chicken. \\n\\nAs for the restaurant's environment, if you want authenticity you have it. Korean pop music playing over head, and Korean boy bands dancing on television screens, and Korean customers sitting and conversing in their native tongue. The servers communicate right back in the same fashion too. \\n\\nAs for the chicken itself, I found nothing special in our bowl of mixed leg parts. The skin was crispy as promised, but the combinations of seasonings was nothing I haven't tried. Ultimately it comes down to the fact that I feel I did not come near to close to getting my money's worth. \\nIn fact we didn't leave any more satisfied or any less hungry.

Mussels aren't the easiest to eat, and take a little time.  \\nOverall, the food was decent.  The wine list, although not drinking, looked solid and seemed to have great pricing.  The service was ok, they just really need to figure out how to pace a meal better.  Things were either super slow or rushed."},{"name":"Appetito","address":"761 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"2","text":"Two stars because I have experienced better.  You'd think on a Wednesday night that it wouldn't be too busy and that you could get in and out fairly quickly.  Well, if the service was better that could have been the case.  Super slow service!  And the place was less than half empty.  I would never go here on a busy night, I might never leave!  \\n\\nThe food however was really good.  We were a party of 4 and we were all really pleased and all of our pasta dishes were cooked perfectly- al dente, the way it should be.  What was weird was there was no wine menu and when we ordered our appetizer she wouldn't take our wine order, she said not right now.  When she came back 5 or so minutes later she just asked if we wanted red or white- I guess they have no selection, but they have a full bar.... hmmm... \\n\\nAll in all it was a good meal, super slow service, and not one that you feel really comfortable in.  Also, I brought my baby and we couldn't fit the stroller at the table so thankfully the car seat fit next to me at the table beside me.

We promptly ordered our Tiki drinks, for me the bourbon special and the wife got the jungle bird with prominent pineapple flavor. The drinks were tasty. Just like P√©ch√©, if they know your flavor profile, I don't think that they could make you a bad drink. We split the ceviche of the day, which was grouper and it was great. The wife's scallops had awesome smokey grilled flavor and my fish of the day special, also grouper, was ok. I probably could have ordered something better, my bad. The wife was still hungry and for dessert wanted a shrimp roti, not exactly your traditional dessert. So I follow along and got the lamb roti. Both roti were huge and jammed packed with flavor and were a pleasant surprise. Would definitely get a roti on a return visit. If I lived in Austin, Isla would definitely be a place to stop for a cocktail, a cocktail and apps and all the way to a full meal.

I lost my Dirty Frank's virginity to the Slappy Pappy's Super Sloppy. Picture this: coney sauce, bacon, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and french fries all piled onto a beef hotdog in a steamed poppyseed bun. That is Heaven, people. And what really knocks it out of the park is that the Super Sloppy was only $3.50. My second time coming here I got the Puff the Magic Popper.

They haven't ever messed up my coffee, or bagel when I get one.  I consider that success considering how many people walk through that door everyday.  My typical breakfast, if I don't get fruit?  Hazelnut coffee with milk, no sugar with a wheat bagel with light cream cheese.  It's a good way to start the day.  If you've had a rough night and need the breakfast of champions, nothing (besides a big mac) will help you succeed like an egg and cheese.\\n\\nSo it's now April 12th, and it's been a while since I reviewed this.....I have to say that the staff and this Dunkin' Donuts location is awesome.  I rarely go into a coffee shop and become a \\"regular\\", but I am now, as funny as that is.

I can't say we felt that we got anything special or that Jackie made any special effort to talk to use or bring any energy to the performance, but was fine.\\n\\nThe food was relatively bland - every single one of us added sauce to our food (it was kinda gross to see the huge amount of shortening being used on the fried rice and veggies!!) - I was VERY glad I ordered the plain white rice. The meat (filet mignon) was very nice. About a 5 ounce portion. Kinda of skimpy on the vegetables. The rice and bean sprouts are definitely used to bulk up the meal.\\n\\nService was pretty disappointing - despite it not being at all crowded and we saw lots and lots of staff walking around. Two in our party never got their white rice (despite repeated requests) and it took quite a long time to get waters for the table (we had all finished eating by the time they arrived.)  No one came around and asked if everything was alright. One server loudly asked (the whole party of 12) - \\"So are you done?\\" it seemed more of an issue of limited English proficiency than rudeness, really.

They had been waiting nearly half an hour by the time they got their food. Finally, my order arrived and the sweet potato fries were black.

If that's how they come, then I don't want them, ever! They agreed to give me new fries, that were slightly less blackened, but they were still way overdone IMO. The hot dog itself was pretty good. The other thing was that the service was terrible. They were shorthanded with only one cook during a Friday lunch rush and the staff taking orders wasn't apologetic at all.

We ordered a pulled pork sandwich/ chips, the 1/4 chicken, 1/4 rib rack, Mac n cheese, baked beans, and potato salad.  \\n  We got our drinks, sat down inside, too hot to eat outside although they have a great area and our peanuts came out followed by food no joke one minute later.   I didn't have any of the sandwich or chips but bf devoured them.  The ribs that we both split were the star of the show.  I don't love ribs but these are from another planet good and literally fell off of the bone.  They had a perfect smoke flavor and BBQ char and didn't need much sauce.  The sauce wasn't my favorite, I like spice and it had none but the meat didn't need much luckily.  I always order chicken at BBQ restaurants and this chicken was top notch!  Of the sides the potato salad was my favorite and the Mac and cheese was a close second.  The beans were ok but not the best I've had, probably would skip them and try coleslaw next time!

It was destiny that we would partake in the highly vaunted BBQ that sunny Saturday afternoon.  Alas, we would still have to wait for nearly 45 minutes.\\n\\nOnce seated at the rickety table for two, I was overwhelmed by the multitude of appealing menu items that could sate my craving for low-and-slow smoked meat.  What to start with?  My eyes settled in on the Texas Fries - smothered in BBQ sauce, topped with chopped brisket, smothered in melted cheese, and topped with jalapenos.  Oh, and ranch on the side too.  But as soon as our waiter informed us of the day's specials, all bets were off.  A BBQ Egg Roll special?  Oh, Hell yes!  It's going down.  \\n\\nAnd did it!  That could very well have been the best few bites of food that I had enjoyed in a month.  A crispy egg roll wrapping, perfectly tender, tangy, and sweet smoked meat within... oh, and a special BBQ ranch (I think) to accompany it.  Heaven.  \\n\\nWith my tastebuds fully awakened, I was primed for more grub.  I ordered the chopped brisket plate, with sides of Frito Pie (a Texas staple that this Texas-born man could not resist) and mac & cheese.  My wife went after the pulled pork plate with brisket chili and baked beans.  Not a bad bite was to be had.  \\n\\nAll of the happy flavors of BBQ that speak to the soul were present.  My wife beamed about the baked beans, proclaiming that they were the best she had ever tried.  The Frito Pie brought me back to my childhood.  I thought that it was a nice touch to serve it straight out of a Frito bag.  The mac and cheese (which was actually pasta shells, not macaroni) was cheesy and satisfying.  At the table, there were two sauces: their signature sauce and a spicy variety.  I happily mixed the two over my brisket.  Yummers.    \\n\\nOften, I am confronted with the unfortunate reality that most restaurants do not live up to their hype.  Occasionally, a restaurant actually lives up to it.  Fox Bros.

No. Do I think my review is important enough to negate this fact? Clearly, I do.\\n\\nPerhaps I shouldn't open with this, but I am from Texas.

Not only do you get the complementary chips and salsa, you also get a bucket of some of the most delicious fountain Coke you've tasted (well, assuming that's what you've ordered). The queso isn't the best I've ever had, but I still order it every time I go there, if that tells you anything. My go-to meal is the chicken quesadilla, which is definitely big enough to share (and still have enough leftovers to share again), if you've brought an obliging (read: equally cheap) friend along. \\n\\nThe cherry on top (or maybe, the jalapeno?) is Jose's Rice. THAT is what keeps me coming back. It has much more of a Cajun flair than Mexican (I mean, Texas borders both Louisiana and Mexico, so that makes me the expert, right? *scoffs*).

No chunks to chew at. Still it was not as bad as some other sushi places. The sashimi was quite good; though, I only had the spicy ones. It's about $8 for the spicy tuna/salmon mix bowl, but it is huge--well, HUGE. So, it's def enough for one person alone, or for a group of 3/4 to share. Also, I have to say that the TEMPURA, especially the spawn, is AMAZING. Very crispy, sweet, tender, and chewy. I think the sauce is where the magic comes from. Also, other rolls are quite nice too, like the Dynamite rolls.\\n\\nThe environment is different at different times. We went on a saturday evening, so it's CROWDED; we waited for about 20min or so. If you come in two, it's alright; but three or more would wait a bit long. And if you are a group of 4+, well, good luck. The place is quite noisy especially if you got a group of people of 20's; I enjoyed it, rather, ignored that part through. TBH, it's prob the same in Cactus, or Milestones, and those restaurants too. The part which I am a little bit annoyed by are the people waiting by the door; I feel pressured to eat quickly and just leave. SO, maybe I will do pick-ups on the weekends. \\n\\nPrice is THE attraction here; let me just emphasize that, THE attraction. Damn cheap rolls start from $2 only! And you get six; which is not bad at all. The Tempura though is the same price as everywhere else around $8. The Spicy Sashimi bowl though definitely worth the $8 as I was talking about above. We went in four, and ordered  3 Salmon roll, 1 spicy tuna roll, 1 spicy sashimi bowl, 1 chicken teri roll, 1 tuna roll, and 2 dynamite, and with tax (farewell HST), it's about $36. \\n\\nThe service is Super good, because they have a relative small area for seating and quite a few servers. They fill water just frequent enough so it does annoy you, and their food comes out quick enough, so you won't think about your smartphone and facebook. However, to main this service level, they have long queues on the weekends and peak hours. LONG QUES.\\n\\nPS: Weekends, there are no reservation.

We're from San Diego and they were determined to try the best BBQ in Austin on our trip. We got in line about 8:30-8:45 on a Sunday morning and there was already a good amount of people in line. The first group in line said they got there at 6 am (crazy!!). The dedication is reaaaal. They have some chairs to borrow while waiting and people literally tailgate in line with coolers of beer. The workers gave us an estimate of 12-12:30pm which ended up being right on the dot. They kept us updated every hour or so and were super nice and friendly. We got 1.5 lbs of brisket, 1/2 lb of ribs, and 1/4 lb of sausage between 2 people. We ended up having a good amount of left overs. Everything has already been said about the food. The meat is juicy and tender and definitely lives up to the hype. It was worth the wait but I'm not too sure I'd do it again lol!

Then a waitress came over to ask about drinks--received them quite quickly and did not have a chance to order.--asking if we were ready-I stated need a couple of minutes.  Then went down hill from there.  Waitress disappeared???  We waited for a while then I went up to play KENO.  When I came back she still had not returned.  Sat and waited another 25 minutes before I went up and asked first waiter if our waitress went on break???  He looks down at our table and said NO.  Waited another 10 minutes for her.  Waiter said she was busy doing a TAKE OUT ORDER.  Not in a good mood now.  Especially when he  pulled the waitress and another waitress closer to TV Corner, talking, and then they looked straight at my table again.  She  went to another table and took their order before coming to us.??  Other customers were seated NOT told to get their own seat.  WAS NOT a crowded night.

The brisket was my favourite; it was SO tender and wasn't heavily sauced, allowing us to dip it in the different BBQ sauces at our table. Although we didn't order it as a sandwich, it was resting on a thick slice of Texas toast. My favourite side was the extremely cheddary Mac N Cheese, which had BBQ chips crumbled on top of it. Unlike most BBQ places, the food was priced around $10-$13 for a platter, which was much cheaper then I had expected! The portions weren't massive (but still a reasonable size) which allowed me to enjoy my meal without suffering from the meat sweats. For dessert, our waitress recommended the Fried Dough. It was a good sharing size for 2-3 people and tasted absolutely fantastic!"},{"name":"Press 101","address":"7600 Dr Phillips Blvd, Ste 22","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"great place! get the mango chicken sandwich. ordered the first time i ate here and cant get past it, it is that good. my husband gets the french dip sandwich everytime. really great atmosphere for casual dining."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Whoever came up with the idea of a crunchy battered fried avocado taco was a goddamned genius and I will love them forever.

WARNING! \\n\\nI came to this place because my father in law made a crunch time decision and the sales women at the Buena Vista Resort and Spa had told us (aka lied to us) that this show was better than the Medieval times and Arabian Knights.  So my father in law being a nice man said, \\"Sure!  we will go and see it!  It's going to be a great show!!\\"  And so the story began as we all went to the Pirate's show.  \\n\\nWell, it turned out to be $50 per person for the 7 of us, which may I add the ad said that it included appetizers, chicken, soda, soup and desert.  If you didn't have the ad it was $65 a person.  They asked that you arrive 30 minutes to an hour beforehand, so you did not miss the \\"Pre Show.\\"\\n\\nEntrance to the Restaurant:  You show up and you get ripped off right at the door.  $3 parking.  (what kind of crap is that? As if you just didn't get  rapped for the stupid show to begin with???) .  Before you enter the restaurant you pay at the front window and Get this!!!  You have an option to upgrade your meal plan and get salmon and better chicken.   The sign said $3.50 for chicken breast, and I can't remember the price for salmon.  There was also a sign by the cashier that said, \\"We are sorry but we don't have soup today.\\" (  What kind of crap is that? False advertising!  Scam...scam..scam..scam..scam...can I say Scam one more time. )  \\n\\nPreshow:  Entering into this restaurant they throw hats and give you swords and ask you to stand in a certain spot so they can take a quick picture of you.  ( Scam scam...scam...scam...)  As you look ahead there was a souvenir shop ( Scam ... scam...scam...)  As you look to the other side there is a full bar ahead.  I arrived early as I was told and this is where you are suppose to get your appetizers, which is nothing more than microwaveable food from Costco.  And believe me you have to fight for it.  They only pass out about 5 platters with about 20 meatballs from Costco and 25 chicken wings.  So as soon as it came out everyone hovered over it to try to get a little meat ball.  This was the appetizer dish they advertised on the brochure. ( Scam... scam...scam..)  May I add that there were more than 200 people there sharing 5 platters of appetizers.  ( Scam scam scam scam scam).  \\n\\nNow the preshow...Lame lame lame.  Poor dialog, bad acting, bad sound system with a bad microphone and sound person.  This is what it sound like \\"hello fellow psst...psst.. patrons..psst..psst...\\"  At the end of the boring pre show they take you in, and may I remind you the lame pre show lasted 30 minutes.  ( starving at this point)  The only good part of the whole pre show was this girl who was a con tourist that was muscular like a man that can twist her body in all weird angles. \\n\\nThe Show:  Lame Lame Lame .  The corniest stuff I have ever seen.  Again the only good part was the girls.  They actually have talent and can do cool acrobatic things.  The men, all they can do is swing back and forth on the rope, and re-act the same sword fighting scenes over and over again for 2 hours.  I was not impressed.  Maybe their bodies were in good shape but that was about it... \\nOn the positive:  They did a good job to try to include the children in some of the scenes which was nice.  The set up of the stage and the boat was also nice.  The boat and the decor I have to say was a nice touch.  And the special effects of the stage was nice.  I can see kids liking the decor in the inside, along with their costumes.\\n\\nThe food:  chicken was actually not bad accounting for the fact that it was mass produced for 400 or more people.  You get some vegetables, potatoes a piece of pork with gravy and some school lunch salad with that.  Desert was a piece of apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It was okay for $15 at most, but definitely below standard for $50.  May I add again no soup...( you would think they would at least offer you a freaken biscuit or something...scam scam scam...).  They also give you a pitcher of soda, which the waitress said she will try to refill more than twice if she has time.  (  what?  You don't have time??....WTF? )\\n\\nToward the end of the show is where they try to sell you the pictures they took of you when you came in for $20.  Of course when they asked me I said \\" hell no!\\", but my father in law bought it in a heart beat.  \\n\\nEnd of the show:  They try again to sell you the pictures by holding them up as you leave.  (Scam scam scam scam..)\\n\\n1 star for the the girl actors for being extremely talented in acrobatic things...and that is about it.  \\n\\nI felt like I got ripped off.  No wait!

The servers were more than accommodating, explaining that they only serve wines and that everything is available by the glass, even if there is no price.

However, our server gladly told us they do some mixed drinks (like martinis and cosmos) and straight liquor.\\n\\nOnly 3 of us decided to try wine and after stating what we wanted, we watched as our server navigated her way through the glass enclosed wine fridge next to our table (poor girl looked so lost trying to find our wines!).

How can you go wrong with cheese (and meat) in fried and oozy form?

We had 7:30 reservations but ended up there early around 7 and were able to get seated.  This is where it all started going wrong. After the hostess seated us, it took 15 minutes for a server to come to our table to get our drink order. Our server took our drink order and food order at that time as we had obviously had plenty of time to think about what we wanted. It took another 10 minutes for me to get my drink which was one of their specialty cocktails. When the waiter brought my drink, he didn't have my husbands drink. He had to wait an additional 5 minutes for his drink. So almost 30 minutes just for drinks! At this point, whatever, we are starving please just bring us food. We were seated at 7pm and at 7:45pm, we still had not even received our appetizers. And I might add, the table that was seated 30 minutes after us, received their appetizer at almost the same time as us! When they did arrive, the mussels were excellent. Great flavor and the naan was also very good. A dish I'd like to recreate at home. The beet salad was just okay. Nothing wrong with it, it was fine.The beets were very good. For our entrees I ordered the hanger steak with potato chip gratin and my husband ordered the red fish with a side of chinese broccoli.  The potato gratin was just a pile of soggy fried potato chips. There was a trace amount of cheese so miniscule, one could actually think someone had accidentally spilled a bit of cheese on it. After two bites I was done. Literally just a pile of poorly fried potato chips. My steak was fine. It was cooked perfectly just lacking any real flavor. My husband's fish was fine as well he said. The broccoli? Oh yeah, they forgot it. By the time it arrived we had already finished eating. A food runner brought it out and noticed we were done and asked if we would just like it removed from the bill, yes that's fine. A few minutes pass and I see our waiter with the broccoli again and I tell him, he's bringing the broccoli back and then he disappears again and the reappears with the broccoli. At this point it's been walking around the restaurant for 10 minutes at least so you know it's cold. He brings it over and says he paid for it himself. It's a nice gesture but seriously by this point, it's been 90 minutes since we were seated. We just want to go home. Our server was apologetic but it was too little too late. Sorry Mettle.

NO WAY!  many 'great' burgers are combinations of different cuts of beef, fresh, not frozen, and how they are cooked.\\n\\nAnd Tasty Burger has the recipe down pretty well. A nice think patty, super juicy, cooked the right way, ready to soak through the wax paper it is wrapped in (yes, it may be juicy and greasy, all the better! You arent eating the burger to be healthy, you  re eating it to satisfy your primitive need for a hunk of tasty beef!)\\n\\nThe burgers are good size, and I can get away with only eating one (and fries) and be happy. They are priced well, and afforable. They have good outdoor seating, and apparently indoor seating (you can see it, but I hve always stayed outside or gotten take out)\\n\\nSome highlights!\\n\\n- sack of burgers! buy five, get a discount. Wow, are you REALLY that hungry? Or you could use them to bribe your friends to help you out with something. Much better than a sack of McD's...\\n\\n- creative toppings. I am normally boring. I get bacon and cheese. and lettuce. and tomato. yeah, boring. But if you want teryaki sauze and pineapple, sure! They even have dily specials, which are all kid of crazy creations, from deep friend to being on texas toast, to having a hot dog on top of the burger, and even a jersey Shore burger one day! (I was afraid)\\n\\n- Fries are good too. Thin cut, but cooked well, not to greasy, and just enough seasoning.\\n\\nSo if youre coming out of a Sox game and hungry, or in the area, give them a try.

Our waitress was so super nice I wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shout out in the review. Okay on to the food... We ordered the tuna nachos and the OMG roll for apps. The roll came out pretty fast and it was okay... The tempura shrimp inside the roll was a little cold like they didn't cook it to order. The nachos on the other hand took forever to get to the table.... so much so that the manager decided to comp. them since we waited so long to get them. They were worth the wait though, YUM (10/10 would order again). For our dinner we ordered the truffle burger and bento box (which is a slider and a few pieces of sushi with a cucumber salad and sweet potato french fries). The bento idea is cute but the highlight was the mini burger. This place shines when it comes to the burger the sushi is just so so in my opinion (but this is coming from an avid sushi lover).

Well, I was looking to \\"smash\\" my hunger demons and the name called to me...\\n\\nSo this is one of those \\"high-end\\" burger joints, that have been popping up lately? Hmmm, not really. I'm a guy whose enjoyed $200 burgers in Vegas. THAT is what you call high-end grub! These Smash Burgers are only slightly better than the stuff handed out the a drive-thru window. In fact, places like this (and Five Guys, etc) are giving the big players (McDonalds, BK, Wendy's, etc) trouble. Let's talk business briefly. The big players sell their regular burgers at very low margin. They depend on their high-end items to generate most of their revenue. And here comes places like Smash Burger offering high-end meat products/solutions minus the loss leader of a cheaply-made hamburger.\\n\\nWith that out of the way, onto my actual experience. I ordered the Classic burger, Smash fries, onion strings, and a large shake. All of it was good, but for me, \\"good\\" isn't always good enough. Don't come here and expect to be stuffed full of food. The regular burger looked to be the size of a regular McDonald's burger, so make sure you order a large, or two (or three). The onion strings were overdone. The fries were good. I actually devoured them before I got into my tiny, little burger. \\n\\nThe best part of the meal was the milkshake.

They are charred enough that you get that 'crunch,' yet moist and flavorful. My picky 7 year old loves the queso dip and the quesadilla. Add in the fries and it is a kid friendly menu. The salads are huge and fresh. \\n\\nThe house salsa is red and delicious. It has a slow heat. The chips are always warm and fresh. I've asked for a spicier salsa, and the chef whipped up something on the spot. It was fantastic. Seemed to be a avocado, lime, habanero combo if I had to guess. Whatever it was, it was fantastic.\\n\\nThey have daily specials. I highly recommend these. I tried the skirt steak the other night. It was a little undercooked in my opinion, but the flavor was masterful. I had asked for medium, but was give medium rare/borderline rare. I'm a believer that flank steak should be cooked longer than that.\\n\\nI'm a boring beer drinker. I like lagers and pilsners. I can't say I'm wild about the beer selection. The special Red Light brew is not bad. Not my cup of tea, but not too offensive. I abhor hops, so the other choices do not fit my palette. The wife seems to enjoy the 10$ glasses of wine a bit too much I must say. ;)\\n\\nThe atmosphere is lively. I love the energy. I would not come here if you want a nice quiet evening. The inside borders on too noisy. The place is tight so it only takes one tipsy, Baldwin Park, loudmouth to talk above the din of the crowd, and make the everyone audibly ill. \\n\\nAnother factor adding to the noise is the bad light jazz they pump through the speakers. The music has a more of a 'Dr.'s Office' vibe than a fun, energetic restaurant should be. If you like jazz then why not some 'Getz-Gilberto?' You gotta rock something with more class than Kenny G! I appreciate the fact they have live music outdoors, but have yet to see anyone I've really enjoyed. Sorry, I'm a music snob as well.

The fried leeks are A MUST, but The Octodog, described a \\"hot dog octopus over mac and cheese,\\" the Frank and Beans and the Sriracha Slaw (coleslaw with the added kick of Sriracha hot sauce) were also tempting. \\n\\nWhile not the most adventuresome selection, I decided upon the Chicago hot dog with an addition of their proprietary coney sauce on top. I paired my dog with an order of fried leeks and a Columbus Brewing Company 'Nightstick' (black IPA).

While first impressions are important, I much prefer to get a real sense of a place before sharing my opinion with others, and, as I'm sure you can imagine, multiple visits are generally required for this.  But since my first experience at the Pig was bad enough to ensure I never go back, I'm limited to my small sample size for this review.  Since I imagine the place might be better under different circumstances (I've heard good things about their brunch), I'll allow them the benefit of the doubt and give them two stars instead of the one star I'd like to give them.\\n\\nIt was a warm summer Friday night, and some friends and I had just left a film screening at the MFA and weren't quite ready for the evening to end.  And so, quite by accident, we happened upon the Squealing Pig.  It wasn't crowded, it looked cozy, and seemed to have a good beer menu.  We were happy.\\n\\nThe music was great, too. It started with some old school hot jazz with Louie Armstrong well-represented in the mix, and I remember someone commenting on how well the music complemented the decor or something ridiculous like that.  But as our conversation continued on, we noticed we were gradually talking louder and louder.  There were four of us at our table, and we were soon leaning in and shouting across the table to be heard.  We flagged down our waitress and asked if the music could be lowered a bit.  She went to the bar where the DJ was sitting with his laptop (\\"DJ JD,\\" I believe), and the music quickly returned to pre-ear splitting levels.  Our conversation likewise resumed at a normal, human volume.\\n\\nBut no sooner had we settled back in our chairs did the music slowly return to its previous jet engine volume.   Three songs later we were again shouting across a tiny table, twisting our ears towards the speaker's mouth in a futile hope of catching the gist of what they were trying to say. \\n\\n\\"This is crazy,\\" I thought.  \\"I'm not going to just sit idly by while this DJ ruins our evening!\\" Taking matters in my own hands, I approached the fellow behind the laptop and politely asked if he wouldn't mind turning the volume down a wee bit.  \\"YOU SEE, MY FRIENDS AND I CAN BARELY HEAR EACH OTHER!\\" I yelled, gesturing toward my table, where one of my friends was clearly shouting into his girlfriend's ear, two inches away.  \\"HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HERE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?\\" the DJ asked.  \\"UH, NO, I HAVEN'T, WHY?\\" \\"WELL, THIS IS KINDA WHAT WE DO HERE ON FRIDAY NIGHTS.\\"  He turned away.  Conversation over. The message was clear: you're on my turf, so you're going to play by my rules.\\n\\nI headed back to my seat, defeated, and thought of a good half dozen witty retorts I wish I had thrown back at him.  \\"Yeah? Maybe THAT'S why it's dead in here.\\"  The Pig was definitely on the empty side, which was likely due in no small part to the absurdly loud music.  After we left, we could still hear it down the street.  It could have been an awesome night, but the jerk DJ with the out-sized ego ruined it for us.  The crazy thing is we LIKED his music when we first walked in--it added a great ambiance--but we came to the Pig to hang out and drink some beers, not to listen to him string together an obvious and predictable chain of hit songs and then be treated rudely.\\n\\nIt sounds like this guy is a fixture there on Friday nights, so if you're looking for a good evening out at the end of the week, avoid the Squealing Pig."},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is reviewing the bar here.

It closed after 90 days.  A real shame.  The food there was very good.  Some of the best French fries in Portland!  A wonderful Reuben sandwich and their fish and chips were delectable. Our favorite server was Ada.  She was an absolute peach!\\nWhy did they close after only 90 days?? In my humble opinion good or great food just isn't enough.  The restaurant space had absolutely NO ATMOSPHERE.  There was nothing warm or inviting about the space, NOTHING that even resembled a bistro atmosphere, no ambiance. I think the only thing they did when they moved in was change the light fixtures and put up a big chalk board for daily specials.  They had several flat screen televisions always with the sound off (which was fine with us). Another factor is the parking.  People don't realize that there is a below ground parking area that any of the businesses will give you 90 minutes free parking.  But considering that there are about 300+ condos and  apartments full of people on the block - that should have been enough right there to keep them afloat - when you have a cold boring atmosphere, good food is just not enough."},{"name":"Captain Ankeny's Pizza & Pub","address":"116 SW Pine St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I ordered the Sausalito and grown in Oregon.

Is it really a surprise that a new barbecue food cart with rave reviews might run out of food quickly?  They aren't exactly cooking in advance and freezing it. \\n\\nAnyway, I got there a bit before they opened to ensure they hadn't run out of anything.  When the guy gave me a sample of the lean brisket, I said \\"wow that's good\\" and he said \\"Thanks! I made it myself!\\"  I liked that. \\n\\nI had the fatty brisket, pulled pork, and sausage.  He gave me a lot more brisket than I asked for (or was charged for) and kindly gave me some burnt ends as well.  I didn't try any of the sides because I can only cram so much in, and I wanted to focus on the meats.\\n\\nEverything was good, but the brisket is clearly the star.  It has the perfect amount of smokiness and fat.  I actually wasn't crazy about either the espresso sauce or the pork sauce, so after a couple dips into those I just ate the meat plain.  And that is totally okay because the meat is outstanding.  \\n\\nWhen I go back it will probably be just for the brisket and to try the ribs.

I wanted to love this place too.  Unfortunately, the RARE burger (that was specifically ordered medium well) and the service will be the reasons that my husband and I will not go back.  \\nI had the veggie burger - great stuff, very fresh and tasty. I really liked the bun, and will remember to try out the bakery next door.  The salad was super fresh also, and nicely tossed with a vinaigrette, cucumbers, red onions, and radishes.  \\nWe were starving, and had looked online before we came so we both knew what we wanted.  When our food came, the hubby cuts his \\"pileup\\" in half and realizes that it is extremely pink, in fact, rare.  I work in a restaurant, and as another reviewer mentioned, MED is slightly pink, at 135-150 degrees.  MED WELL - 150-165 and should have no pink.  This burger was raw, and unfortunately, my husband didn't sent it back, but dug out the rare middle, and ate what the rest, as previously mentioned our starvation and didn't want to wait for another burger to be cooked to correct temp.  \\nWhen the server came to check up on us, we said it was okay, and she dug deeper. He let her know that it was really pink, but he had already started eating it.  My thoughts  \\"Right on, she will offer to fix it!\\"   Nope, she says \\"are you sure?\\" no insistence on fixing it...when she proceeded to ensure us that \\"you won't get sick and die\\" and \\"if you do, you can call and let me know\\"...that was just weird and awkward. You've got to be kidding, right?  Apparently, we should have pushed the issue and made them fix it.\\nWhen she brought the bill, we said she was going to \\"comp\\" something, and \\"she would be our cashier though\\", and assumed the burger was comped after she saw the pile of raw hamburger on my husband's plate when she took it back.  The bill was in full, and we assumed it just hadn't been removed yet.  The other waitress came by, grabbed the bill, and proceeded to run our card, for the full amount.  We thought it was strange, and asked our original waitress about it, and she proceeded to take us into \\"twilight zone\\" and tell us that we were confused with another waitress and that half of them look just like her.  WHAT?!?  I think we were both shocked that she actually believed what she was saying, and that she was actually saying it!   \\nThe only other girl we saw was the one who sat us, brought us water, and rang our bill.

We sat at the hibachi side and I thought it was the best hibachi in the area, which is admittedly not necessarily saying much considering the other places are mediocre at best. The atmosphere is nice and everything was very clean. The hibachi chef cleaned the table before and after he cooked. I have been to many hibachi places including some of the better ones including Bennihana and Kobe and they normally only clean at the end, so I was impressed with the extra cleaning before.\\n\\nOur waitress made a few minor mistakes like spilling a bit of our sake and forgetting a drink, but she was so  pleasant that it didn't annoy me in the least. (Spilling an alcoholic drink would normally annoy me quite a bit. Sorry, I am a bit of a lush and that is just wasted alcohol!) She was very thoughtful and helpful when I mentioned I was a vegetarian and tried to explain what I could and could not eat. She was very fast with clearing dishes and refilling waters. She even realized that I did not have any ice in my water and asked if that was OK. I wish I had gotten her name so I could mention her by name.\\n\\nOur hibachi chef was Hunter and he was really great! Again, he went out of his way multiple times to make sure I was OK with things because of being a vegetarian. He made sure eggs were OK and he also made sure butter was OK. He cooked my tofu first and even had the waitress bring me extra. There were TEN triangles of tofu!! It was such a huge portion! I thought someone else must have also gotten tofu even though I hadn't heard them order but it was all for me. He was very entertaining, even if the chicken and egg trick was a bit creepy.  :-)\\n\\nThe fried rice was very good. They had 3 eggs in 5 portions so there was a nice amount of egg. I wish they had the Japanese white sauce that some hibachi places have but they do not seem to have it in the northeast for some odd reason. \\n\\nThe portions were HUGE! I left with 2/3 of my plate in a take out container and I was thoroughly stuffed. I wish I had eaten less but it was just so good that I kept eating. (OK I will admit that I was a bit hung over from my best friends wedding weekend and 5 days of drinking, so the greasy food just hit the spot.)\\n\\nNormally I would not write a review with only one visit to a place, but I really wanted to give a different perspective so that this place stays open!

The restaurant matches the intimate feel with a variety of unique, freshly created dishes that combine classic foods with new tastes. And better yet, it's all locally-sourced!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I tried the Fried Cauliflower Pickles, Chicken Fried Local Rabbit, Secret Burger, and the Smoked Chocolate Bread Pudding for dessert. All of them were absolutely fabulous, with very unique tastes that I hadn't had before. For example, the Fried Cauliflower Pickles weren't covered in a batter (thankfully), but were perfectly crispy and had a very mild level of spice that paired perfectly with the sweet golden raisin crema that they were served on. The Secret Burger is one of Alden & Harlow's most famous creations, and rightfully so. On paper, the burger isn't anything I haven't seen before, but the execution and preparation is exquisite; order it if you can.\\n\\nLast but not least: the service. It's awesome, with servers that are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu. Something that certainly stood out to me was the sense of pride they carried as they laid each plate of food out on the table.

When we went outside - there were only two-top tables, so a few of us sat at those and the others on the other side of the sidewalk in the Adirondack chairs about 3 feet away.  When he came outside with menus, once again - he was rude and said the only way he would serve us is if we were all on the same side of the sidewalk....at two tops next to each other.  We could essentially touch each other the seats were so closed together, so oblivious to why this would have been an issue.

Awhile back they fixed that issue, so the smell no longer scared me as I approached the hallway toward the bathroom. \\n\\nTwice in the 4 years I've been going there I have seen and heard staff LOUDLY arguing with each other in their language. Once more recently, I witnessed the manager on staff (possibly the owner) giving the front desk greeter a hard time in English and it seemed like something they needed to talk about in the kitchen. \\n\\nUsually, I am served by a guy that seems a little mentally slow. He is their best server! He is great at getting my order right, friendly, and knowledgable about the menu. He isn't someone I have ever seen arguing. I even saw him poor steaming hot tea over his hand once and continue taking orders after as though he didn't need to scream and run for the cold water. If the other waiters and waitresses took time learning from him I'd really be more impressed with the service. Not that anyone needs to suffer burns, of course!\\n\\nThe sushi is mediocre and inconsistent, but I return because I like sushi and crave it so badly sometimes that I will put up with it. The other warm dishes are pretty good and more consistent. As far as sushi goes, maybe I have been spoiled in the past with better, but I would give them 2 stars. \\n\\nThe reason I will not be going back is 2 fold, the price is too much for the quality of food.

The Tito's Mule and Blood Orange Margarita were both too sugary, though the Banana Nut Old fashioned was incredibly good. They had a Poetry Scotch special, (with apple butter!) the day we went...I know, I know, it sounds terrible, but believe me when I say it was by far the best cocktail on the menu. It helps that their happy hour is generous (Thurs-Sun), and it brings the cocktails into the $6-8 range. \\n\\nWhile it pays to be adventurous with the cocktails, you'll want to stick with the tried-and-true cuisine. Sliders, burgers and fries were all well executed. I was especially impressed with the gorgonzola and chipotle sliders, there was really good bun:meat ratio, which is rare for sliders, especially on the happy hour menu. The beer cheese fondue is a must try!\\nI was eager to try the Curried Chicken & Waffles, but they ended up being a total bust. Way overcooked chicken with almost no flavor. Boo.\\n\\nSo why does Porter Ale House get four stars with such sporadic quality? In short, because the ambiance is kickass. A combination of world class service, and absolutely amazing music. The playlist was seriously ridiculous, huge shoutout to whoever put it together: Bobby Brown, followed by 3rd Eye Blind, 2pac, Biggie, throw a little Missy Elliot in the rotation and I'd be in sonic heaven.

I do wish that there was a greater array of meats. I do not eat beef or pork and would really appreciate some other meat options like seafood, chicken or turkey. Or maybe just more vegetarian options for sandwiches and menu items?  The emphasis that Cured has on local high-quality food is a statement that supports our local Boulder food community and economy. This establishment is an important player in the Boulder food scene. They also allow Isabelle Farms to set up their farm stand in front on the shop during the active farmers market months.  They definitely walk their talk and this in turn gets my business and patronage.

Ogle we did, and silently we did so, because the first floor is too loud (until about 11pm) to have a conversation with anyone but yourself. \\nCareful this time to avoid cheese-slop things, I ordered the beef fajitas with rice and beans and a strawberry margarita.   The margarita was big and sticky and mostly not alcohol, so one was enough and I switched to wine.  Hot fresh chips were good, the salsa was unexciting, but the fajita was a pleasant surprise.  The steak strips on my sizzling plate outnumbered the onions, and the overly strong (tex-mex?) flavor was sufficiently calmed with sour cream and guacamole.  I super loaded 3 or 4 soft tortilla shells before I could eat no more.  I liked it enough to box the leftovers but someone raided my beef strips.  \\nI've played it safe with the fajita on subsequent visits.

Obvi. But there are distinct differences; some of which gives this location merit. \\n\\nFor starters - it is in Beaverton. If I didn't live out here I'm sure I would never come to this location. But I must face it that China Town was really the only other viable option before this spot opened up. \\n\\nThe last thing I want to do when I need a dim sum fix is drive the half hour out to 82nd and then wait for a table for 1-1.5 hours. The wait at Wong's King in Beaverton has never been more then 15 minutes when I've gone.\\n\\nRight when they opened they did not have any dim sum carts but rather chose to execute a check-box menu. In theory this should have at least meant fresh hot dim sum. Some how this was not the case. I would place my order and longingly stare at other people's food, dreaming of a cart rolling by to satisfy my hungry immediately. Furthermore, the food seemed less fresh. Not quite sure how that worked out. After some time passed they brought in carts. It was a vast improvement. But I don't think they were busy enough because on my most recent visits they have a couple carts with the most popular items and then a check-box menu for some of the less commonly ordered items. I get it. They are working out the best systems. And sometimes these things take time.\\n\\nThe ambiance is a lot less Chinese restaurant and a bit more...nice? This can be appealing. I guess it depends on what you are looking for. I'm okay either way.\\n\\nThe food mostly tastes the same. I do tend to like the har gow better at SE. But it could just be the day to day variation that any restaurant experiences. The main difference, I think, is the service. When I'm here I'm not being yelled at in broken English. I'm instantly brought water. Asked what kind of tea I want. Frequent water fills. Pleases & thank yous. Chili oil and soy sauce is brought out. It is unlike any other dim sum experience.\\n\\nIt's still on my to-do list to give their regular menu offerings a try. I just often feel hesitant to eat Chinese for dinner. I've eaten at some great places and don't want to face disappointment. I've heard mixed reviews but have had the hot pots strongly recommended to me.

The atmosphere at El Vaquero was alright.  The restaurant was clean, and completely devoid of any popular North American sporting events on TV.  Sorry, but I just can't  get into soccer.  But, the lack of sporting entertainment just allowed me to focus on my lovely wife.  El Vaquero wasn't real busy on the evening we visited, so the place was pretty quiet.  Sure, there was some Mexican music playing in the background, but it wasn't so loud that it was annoying.  This particular El Vaquero is in a strip mall (just like Chile Verde), and we are noticing the d√©cor usually suffers because of this.  The d√©cor at El Vaquero wasn't bad, just a little uninspiring.\\nHigh marks:  Clean, fairly quiet\\nLow marks:   Uninspiring decor\\n..............................................................................................................................................................................\\nService:  Grade B:  Our server, Omar, did a really nice job.  Sure, the was the requisite language barrier that we seem to experience at all the Mexican eateries that we visit, but we understood each other enough that Omar was able to make some jokes, including trying to pawn a second margarita off on us.  He kept our salsa dishes full and our chip baskets overflowing with fresh chips.  Again, like most other Mexican restaurants, the wait for our entrees was almost non-existent.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a whole lot of opportunity for Omar to \\"wow\\" us, and our dinner needs were pretty straight-forward.  \\nHigh marks:  Fast, friendly service\\nLow marks:   Simple demands didn't allow server much opportunity to impress\\n..............................................................................................................................................................................\\nFood/Spirits:  Grade B:  I bet you can't guess what we ordered to drink.  Well, if you did guess margaritas, either you're lucky or you've read this blog before.  The margaritas at El Vaquero were tasty, but there was no hint of tequila in the taste, so we were a little suspicious of their strength.  We also chowed down on chips and salsa, and while the chips were nice and fresh, the salsa was serviceable but not overly impressive.  It did have a bit of a kick, but otherwise it wasn't very memorable.  For entrees, Katina ordered the Chimichanga Suprema and I ordered the Nachos Supreme.  The chimichanga was cooked nicely and stuffed full of all the ingredients that the menu advertised.  It was simple, but very tasty.  The nachos, on the other hand, were a bit of a mess.  I always forget to ask for light lettuce when I visit an \\"authentic\\" Mexican restaurant.  Evidently, real Mexicans must really like lettuce, because all of the dishes I've ordered at \\"authentic\\" Mexican restaurants are buried under a ton of lettuce.  I like lettuce...kinda...but I don't want it to be the main ingredient in any of my dishes (unless I've ordered a salad).  The nachos were covered in a ton of lettuce (no surprise) and there was a pool of some liquid (it wasn't cheese as much as a cheese/water mix) that made all of the chips soggy.  You're definitely going to want to pass on the nachos.  El Vaquero gets a \\"B\\" because the nachos were technically an appetizer, and the entr√©e they served was actually pretty good.\\nHigh marks:  Decent (if not weak) margaritas, good chimichanga  \\nLow marks:   Nachos left a lot to be desired\\n..............................................................................................................................................................................\\nValue:  Grade B:  We didn't take any doggy bags home, but we weren't hungry when we left, either.  Nachos aside, the food was pretty good quality, the price was really reasonable, and portion size was good.  El Vaquero doesn't really outshine any of the competition, but it holds its own.  We recommend it for a nice change of pace.\\nHigh marks:   Decent quality, decent portion size, decent price\\nLow marks:   Doesn't really stand out"},{"name":"The Reef","address":"4172 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been going there for years!

Our server approached us soon after we squeezed our way to our table and we never had to wave someone down to refill our waters. \\n\\nI was hoping there was more to the brunch menu but there are only about 6 items. As much of a sweet tooth that I have, I don't usually go for sweets when choosing a brunch dish because there tends to be more breading that necessary. However, the Banana Rum French Toast  had the perfect balance of breading to sliced bananas, it was buttery with just the right amount of sweetness from the caramel sauce. We also ordered the basic breakfast plate with home fries, bacon, toast and eggs.

I'm in. (Fine print: Applys to combo plate only) \\nBut that's ok cause if you planed on getting more than 5 tapas its worth it. \\n\\n1 combo plate and a Masarita please. \\n\\napproximately 15 minutes later I was enjoying an array of delightful tapas. \\n\\n$5 gets you a bite (or 2) of each tapa on the menu \\nGrilled chorizo \\nFire roasted sweet corn taco \\nShredded chicken taquito \\nQueso fundido jalapeno empanada \\nGoat cheese and queso chihuahua quesadilla \\nBeer battered achiote shrimp \\nPulled pork and montery jack springroll \\nSmoked jalapeno arepa con chicharron \\n\\n\\nWhats my take? \\n\\nThe Fire roasted sweet corn taco was a tasty combination between delicious sweet summer corn and a salty, crunchy fried taco shell. \\n\\nThe Shredded chicken taquito was by far my fav...crisp and overflowing with flavorful chicken. \\n\\nI found The Queso fundido jalapeno empanada was a bit too cheesy for my liking. After one bite it seemed dense and heavy.The deep fried flaky pastry crust was not as light and flaky as it was intended to be. \\n\\nThe Goat cheese and queso chihuahua quesadilla topped with anaheim chile puree was an amazing little bite size quesadilla that left me wanting more. Perfect combination of cheese, tortilla, and sauce. \\n\\nBeer battered achiote shrimp?? Mine was definitely not beer battered. More shrimp cocktail style topped with a confusing roasted garlic chili. Given 2 shrimp, I left 1 on the plate... \\n\\nThe Masa BBQ Sauce overpowered any other flavors the pulled pork and montery jack springroll. Another dense crust that didn't lend well to the whole \\"light tapas\\" menu. And was that pulled pork?? :-/ \\nOne bite was all I could take. \\n\\nI'm assuming the pickled hot pepper on my plate was the Smoked jalapeno arepa con chicharron. It was indeed salty, spicy, and delicious. Stuffed with chipotle black beans and cotija cheese. \\n\\nLast but not least the Grilled chorizo. Playing with the salty/sweet combination, the grilled slice of salty seasoned spanish sausage was topped with a sweet cranberry chutney. Not bad, but not my fav. \\n\\nThe Masarita filled with Sauza Extra Gold, Triple Sec, Apple Juice, Fresh Squeezed Orange and Lime left me wondering if they forgot the alcohol...taste like drinking a cup of OJ. \\n\\nMy yelper girlfriend informed me that its a premade mix. When asking the bartender for another drink, I requested a non-premade drink from the menu. She insisted that NONE of their drinks are premade.

I arrived on Thursday round 9.20. I was in barbecue nirvana by 12.15. I was very worried that I was going to be too late and stuff would be sold out or that I'd drop of heatstroke. Neither of those worries were justified. We easily found free legal parking about a block away round the corner.\\n\\nFrom the very start, the staff convey that they care about you. Carry some cash so you can buy a beer or drink in line. They have free water and will let you nip in to use the restroom.\\n\\nI couldn't help but notice Aaron Franklin bringing a huge to go order box out to a customer's car. It floored me that the owner would still care so much that he wasn't above doing grunt work. I waved and he waved back. There's a collection of grateful notes by the bathroom that speak to his generousity.\\n\\nProbably the only thing they could improve on would be to have a separate till for merchandise. I think they might be losing a tiny bit of money on folks not buying sauce since you can't really try it first. You want the espresso whether you like coffee or no. They also sell t shirts.\\n\\nThe food! The food is king here. It is true to genre. There is nothing superfluous on the menu. Q, Q, and nothing but the Q.\\n\\nEverything goes to support the brisket. I've seen him on BBQ Pitmasters criticising folks for covering dry brisket with sauce. This is the only brisket I've ever had that didn't need a drop of sauce. The smoke ring was purple. It oozed juice when you wounded it with a fork. The guy behind the counter was a surgeon with the knife. Every piece of brisket was precisely the same size.\\n\\nThe beef heart sausage was delightful, too. There was only one wee piece of gristle and it was reassuring rather than distracting. It shouted that the chef was human. I couldn't help but wonder how he'd transform bison either as sausage or brisket.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was a testament to insanity by means of consistency, too. Each thread seemed to be the same size. I was very happy that it was the sandwich and not the side because the sandwich comes with delicious slaw. So if you get it with the two meat plate, you'll get to sample all of the sides. You might just have to use some of the sauce on the pork.\\n\\nIf you have hated beans elsewhere, you need to give them another chance here. They were cooked to perfection. Just a little fight on the tooth. They were spiced perfectly and in just the right amount of jus.\\n\\nI've mostly given up soda, but I made an exception for Franklin. They have Maine Root on tap. The cherry was delicious and the root beer was great, too. Both are the perfect compliments to the food. There are teas for folks, too.\\n\\nTo seal your place in glutton's hell, be sure to order pie. I had no regrets getting the Bourbon Banana. The Bourbon was very much present. The graham cracker \\"crust\\" was tasty though there was zero structural integrity since the filling was essentially pudding.\\n\\nAll of the ingredients were fresh and top notch. The symphony of the meal was masterful. Every customer was fussed over. That makes this experience worth a trip on its own. \\n\\nThe total was 33.23 for 2 drinks, a pulled pork sandwich, a 2 meat plate, and a slice of pie.

How do I know? Who do you think I stay with when I visit Vancouver? How do you think I found this place?\\n\\nI could swear this is the old location of the old Robson Sushi which was also an all-you-can-eat (ayce) restaurant.\\n\\nAssuming I am right, apparently, the interior had been updated even since my first visit (I have been 3 times including 2 times in 3 days which is what this review will cover (Friday, 30 October and Saturday, 31 October).\\n\\nI have yet to try the Korean BBQ but based on the smells coming from the table across the aisle, that would be a good pick. I understand this ayce option has been added recently. Be advised that the soup base is extra for this ($9.99) and this soup base charge applies to the non-ayce version of hot pot (that seemed a little pricey to me but then I don't eat hot pot that much so that could be the norm).\\n\\nThere are 4 sections of the ayce menu I was given including A, B, C, D. If memory serves, the prices for the ABCD combo are $24.99 and $19.99 for the AD combo. If you want short ribs and some other cooked foods, you have to get the former (ABCD) as the latter (AD) is ayce sashimi/sushi (and you still get teriyakis, motoyakis, and tempuras).\\n\\nBonny A. mentioned there is a sashimi limit on first order. I did not experience that and that may have changed since she reviewed the few days before I visited (after reading other reviews, many policies have changed as it appears the owners are trying to find a happy medium that is profitable and pleases customers; change can be good). She is right when she says the prices are excellent (I'd say reasonable as well) and high quality (for sure). The hand rolls are good as well (though I like my spicy tuna to be spicier :)). I also like the seaweed salad (I had 5 servings myself) while the miso soup is a little salty (but I did have 2 bowls). The shrimp and veggie tempura that I had was lightly breaded and not very greasy (a good thing for me). The chicken in the chicken teriyaki was very moist and again, the outside lightly breaded (other places I have had this dish and the chicken almost tastes like cardboard and I know we need fibre but come on; not the case here... moist and delicious (SNL skit reference)).\\n\\nSome specials you need to be aware of is that the $12.99 pitcher of beer (including a Pale Ale (I think Granville Island), Honey Lager (I think Granville Island), and Sapporo) is as low as $6.99 per pitcher if you get the ayce sushi and/or ayce Hot Pot. It goes to $10.99 if you get the non-ayce Hot Pot which I think is $10.99 as well (and probably if you just get a la carte sushi but since I never get that in these type of situations, I cannot verify). Their pitcher does NOT have the cone in the middle which is supposedly for cooling (come on, not everyone is stupid enough to believe that) so you get good value for your pitcher!\\n\\nI usually get water when I consume ayce and this was no exception. Unlike Bonny A.'s experience, my water was fine (no ill effects at this time).\\n\\nAs Fly W., Bonny A, and several others have noted, the service does appear better when it's less busy (this also enforces my observation that in Canada, the service usually fails unless the person knows you and/or it's not busy).\\n\\nThe (men's) washroom was spotless on both days so Bonny A.'s sketchy experience could have been a fluke.\\n\\nBonny A. is right when she says you could walk by and miss this place; I only know it changed ownership/names because of my friend, Fly W. (his review is one the 41+ not recommended; I have contact Yelp about this but nothing has been done as of this posting).\\n\\nThings I would like to see include wild sockeye salmon, chinook salmon, or pacific salmon (when in season, of course).\\n\\nI agree with much of what Fly W. and Bonny A. said as they are honest reviews based on my experiences thus far (my next trip will in December for sure)."},{"name":"Hey Cupcake!","address":"5530 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"In lieu of the recent passing of the King of Pop, I was a bit down and felt like the best way to get me back on track while paying my respects was to gorge on a chocolate cake and cream cheese frosting.
