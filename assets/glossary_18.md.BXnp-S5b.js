This is a trendy place, in a trendy neighborhood, frequented by trendy people - and if you want to follow the trend, go right ahead. But you would clearly not be looking for quality coffee. I would give this place only one star if it were not for the added \\"Trend Factor\\". And why, you may ask, would I only give it one star (if not for \\"trend factor\\")? If you can find a parking spot on any street within a three block radius, you need to have your pockets loaded down with quarters to feed the meters. Otherwise, you can park in the deck down the block, or the lot across the street. Both of which are going to cost you. The coffee is served in chipped, cracked,worn, and weathered mugs - as painted/glazed in the pottery place across the street. Chipped is a physical concern (cut lips, fingers, mouth, etc... on sharp edges), cracked is a health concern (bio-hazards hide where?). Cracks scare me for other reasons too (in case the mug breaks and hot coffee spills all over you). And worn/weathered mugs may SEEM totally hip at first, but just end up seeming childish and unprofessional. I understand that's it's supposed to give off the Indie-vibe, all anti-establishment and all... sure, I get that. But please - let's do in a way that won't get the company sued! No one likes court. But these are not even my biggest problems. My biggest problem is the fact that their coffee just isn't that good. The beans taste over-roasted, even perhaps (dare I say) slightly burned?! It seems very \\"starbucks\\" to me... and if I wanted that, I might as well just go around the corner to the actual starbucks! Like I said - trend factor bumps it up a notch: they do open mic nights, poetry slams, local singer/songwriters play, free (spotty) Wi-Fi, and they display consignment of local artists (painters, photogs, etc...) which is cool.

I understand the family style thing but to pay 40 bucks when it was just 2 people and still be starving is ridiculous. The portions are a rip off and tiny.

You see, in the wonderful world of shwarmas, Babylon Caf√© pretty much takes the cake. I argue it's the best shwarma in all of Vancouver. Quote me on that. Chicken shwarma is Babylon Caf√©'s claim to fame, in particular. The chicken is delicious and crispy (and not gamey or fatty like I've had at other shwarma shops), plus the selection and quality of ingredients for your shwarma wrap is top notch: hummous, yogurt, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pickles, pickled turnip, tabouleh, tahini, and hot sauce.All together these wraps cost under $8 - incredible value given that they're tasty, full of flavour, they fill you up, and they're healthy.One dollar cheaper than the chicken shwarma wraps are the falafel wraps - identical to the chicken, except made with fresh-to-order crispy falafel. The falafel have that nutty pistachio green hue to them - a sign of fresh chickpeas. These are equally as tasty as the chicken and make for a delicious vegetarian option.You can order all these items are plates, which is one way to eat their food. For example, the falafel plate (which I ate for lunch today) includes 4 falafel drizzled in tahini & hot sauce, a heap of tabouleh, hummous, pickled turnip, and an untoasted pita. While the plate was good, I think the wraps here are more satisfying. If you're looking for amazing Middle Eastern plates, I'd rather go to Nuba, although I'd also be paying $3 more. But for shwarma? They beat Nuba out of the ballbark! Babylon Caf√© is where you need to go for all your shwarma cravings.And if the food being awesome wasn't enough, the staff here are super friendly, always ask how you're doing, always serving their customers with a smile on their face. If you become a regular customer, they'll recognize you almost immediately and the whole experience becomes even more enjoyable.So that's the Babylon Caf√©.

I asked what was particularly good, and he said \\"everything.\\"  Not in a charming, smiling way; this was more of a dismissive, \\"I don't fucking care, just order.\\"  This was hardly easy given that much of the blackboard was partially erased.  Eventually my girlfriend and I both ordered clam and calamari over pasta.  This was unexciting.  What I would expect to be a garlic explosion was bland and boring.  It was cooked fine, but fell completely flat with respect to flavor.  What more can be said?  If the flavor isn't there, it's really hard to be positive.  I just poured salt on it and worked though it; I was starving.  All in all, an especially pathetic experience given the hype.  Maybe the waiter was having a bad night.  Aside form learning his parents had died (or something else terrible), it's inexcusable.  Waiters are the ambassadors of restaurants; thanks a lot, Daily Catch guy, for making us feel unwelcome!

I walked in and ordered and waited 30 minutes for the food. I grabbed a shrimp plate. It came out hot and seasoned to perfection with potatoes sitting at the bottom soaking up the butter...mmmmm, so good!"},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow, their Chipotle Pastrami was even better than I had remembered!  One bite and I was smitten.  Pastrami that quite literally melts in your mouth, zesty spice from the chipotle honey mustard and great added flavor and texture from the sesame seeds on the roll.  Really, how often does a sandwich shop have good enough bread where you can notice those little touches?  I tried the Roast Beef, Peppers & Cheese as well and that was also tasty.  The spicy bbq sauce was a nice touch and went well with the red peppers, though the meat itself was a little on the dry side.  As I've said before, the prices are on the higher side especially when you consider the quality & quantity of some of the other hard hitters in the area (read: Mike & Patty's, Al's South Street Cafe), but man that Chipotle Pastrami was worth every penny!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We came for Sunday brunch.

If you want a cocktail served with a side of attitude, this place is for you. I went to a meet up with a group a ladies during happy hour. They do not have customer service at the forefront of their business. We had about 9 ladies in total and we all arrived and needed to leave at different times. They gave one person in our group their bill when they needed to leave, but every person to leave after her was given a hard time about paying. They insisted that we pay as a group, but the problem was that some ladies wanted to stay and order more drinks. It was like pulling teeth just to pay. The only reason I can assume they wanted to do it this way was because they wanted to add gratuity on our bill. Either way, I've worked at many restaurants and as long as you tell the waiter ahead of time you all want separate checks, which we did notify him when we arrived, you should be able to. The waiter and bartender had an attitude every time our group spoke to one of them. You would think they would be nice, especially since we brought in so much business. At least their margarita was decent, which gives them the one star."},{"name":"Barlow","address":"737 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I came here after getting oysters at JackRabbit for a drink and an appetizer.

The chef has won the James Beard Award which is a huge honour for a chef so I knew the food was going to be great.  And...the food was very tasty and definitely a departure from the usual pad thai and curries you see on every other Thai restaurant menu.  But I wasn't WOW'd by the experience...maybe I fell victim to the media hype and expected too much, but there is so much hype for this place so it would be impossible to not be taken in by it at least a little.I knew we were going to be in for a lineup, coming in for Saturday night dinner.  Since I'm currently at a stage of my life where I go from happy to hangry very quickly we made sure to get to the restaurant well before I was even feeling snackish to put our names down.  There is a lineup to put your name down (or as my husband called it, \\"A line up for the line up\\"), which went from about 6 parties deep when we got there to about 20 parties deep by the time we checked in.  The hostess told us it would be about 60-90 min wait and we'd get a text.  There are a lot of places to go in the area while you're waiting, and kitty corner to the restaurant is a bar that is owned by the same people, so it almost serves as a sort of holding area where you can get your food party started if you're feeling hungry.  We got a text about 75 minutes later and were seated right away in one of the side rooms (the restaurant appears to be in a sort of converted house).  Our server was friendly and quite enthusiastically went over the menu options with us, but also looked a little harried as the place was PACKED and I'm pretty sure he had to run between all the rooms and up and down the stairs and outside and inside his entire shift.  I thought eating in the side room was a little odd but at least I got to sit!  There are also somewhere between one to three bathrooms (I got conflicting information) which also means you might have to lineup for that at some point.We ordered the pork belly Burmese style curry and the baked seafood bean thread noodle pot.  Both were delicious; the pork belly was cooked until meltingly tender and I enjoyed the caramelized sauce at the bottom of the pot of noodles.  The shrimp in the pot were a little overcooked, however.  The coconut rice was fluffy and not too wet with coconut milk.  Portion sizes were decent but not jaw-droppingly large, and I would say prices were what I expected for a trendy restaurant on the main restaurant strip.  Unfortunately as good as the food was it didn't really make up for what in the end felt a bit like the experience didn't match the story behind the food itself.  Part of it I think is the restaurant being a victim of its own success; I don't mind waiting a long time but I've been to places where the wait was rewarded with an experience that had more touches of personality, whereas here they are honestly too busy to create that kind of atmosphere, though I think the staff do try their best.  At Pok Pok once you sit down it is pretty much the same sit down, eat, pay kind of experience you can have at any restaurant - without two hours of build-up."},{"name":"Wei Wei Pan Asian Eatery","address":"9226 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent!! \\nI go here often.

I enjoyed the pleasure of a leisurely breakfast meeting at Arleta Library Bakery Cafe on a sunny spring morning, and the food, service, atmosphere, and company were all divine. Hidden off in SE on a side street, sandwiched in next to a coffee shop, ALBC is serving up some pretty fantastic breakfast. The coffee is Stumptown and comes straight from a French Press (my fav). The bakery items look sinfully delicious. The breakfast options are gourmet, but in a traditional and homey way. Everything on the menu sounds so delicious I could... well... probably eat the menu itself. I thoroughly enjoyed my special quiche made with asparagus and potato (served with a side salad of mesculin greens). The menu is not elaborate, the space itself is pretty tiny, and the service is welcoming and friendly. As a spot for a mid-week, mid-morning breakfast, ALBC is divine. I sort of shudder at the thought of what the wait at this gem must be on the weekends. I can only imagine that it's not a 1-hour-or-less affair. Check this place out.

They were ALL talking (or gossiping) amongst themselves and paying no attention to the customers that were walking in.  I stood there waiting to be acknowledged. After what was way too long, I finally had my order taken.  The entire time I was there, the girls were talking in great detail about what was going on in their personal lives.  I'm all about having fun at work, but where is the professionalism??\\n2nd visit- came in and was acknowledged almost immediately.  But, same thing.  There were definitely not as many girls working this time around.  However, some employee was explaining procedures/protocols (training) etc to the person who was making my smoothie.. WTH?? can that not wait until there are no customers in the store? That caused it to take forever for the drinks to finally come back (I had that conversation about the wait with the only other customer in the store waiting for her drink also.)\\n3rd visit- this morning I decided to call in my order instead of having to wait in store.  I called at least 10 minutes in advance of my arrival.  I called and ordered a goddess smoothie, then asked for a shot of the beets me.  The gentlemen on the phone probably asked me 6-7 times about the beef? or beet what?  I said it's a shot.. it's called the beets me and has ginger and pressed beets.  He said he was having a hard time hearing me.. then says that he was new and wasn't sure what I was talking about, but would talk to his manager who was there and get It right for me. I made sure to reiterate that shot several times as had a feeling  my order may be incorrect given his straight-up confusion. I came in ten minutes later and my drink was still being made.  When handed me my drink and I asked where the shot was?   He dumped it into my drink? Awesome.  In his defense, he did offer to remake it.  I explained that I called it in only because I would NOT have time to sit in the store and wait.  He asked if I worked close by.. I said yes.. then awkward silence?  Then offered to remake it again? told him again I didn't have time.  He did give me the drink at no charge... but once  Iwas out of the store and took a few sips I ended up just tossing it anyway.  \\nSucks when you're looking forward to healthy start on Monday morning--- FAIL."},{"name":"Rapscallion Kitchen & Bar","address":"208 Fitchburg Turnpike","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"Great food and beer menu.

It was brunchtime, and hopping (as well as short-staffed, I overheard), but once we got someone's attention, we were seated quickly. Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I had breakfasted at home, so we forewent the brunch menu and went to the sandwiches. I ordered the roasted eggplant sandwich, he ordered the portobello one and we got an Italian soda apiece. Our friend perused the brunch menu and decided on a make-your-own omelette (sausage, tomato, cheese, I believe) and a cup of coffee. We sipped our drinks (the Italian sodas had just enough syrup after a good swirl of the straw and I hear the coffee was a pretty decent cuppa) and drooled over the brunchy waffles wafting by. Our meals came quickly, and we all dug in. The side salads that come with the sandwiches were a nice mix of greens and veggies and the made-on-premises balsamic dressing was good enough that we ended up dipping our sandwiches in it a couple of times. The homefries were well-spiced and roasty hot. The omelette looked amazing, and I was assured that it was, and that the sausage was some of the best our friend had ever had. The boyfriend's sandwich was filled with meaty pieces of mushroom and mozz, and he said that it was great, but he would have loved it more if he hadn't had a bite of my sandwich... a perfect amount of filling, roasted veggies full of flavor, not at all soggy or overcooked, and the eggplant was a layer of amazing sweet&smokiness. I am often wary of eggplant that I don't make, but I'd let Cafe Luna make it for me any day. Not a bitter note, and not a flavorless mush! The other veggies bolstered the flavors, but the eggplant was definitely the star. A little bit of provolone and pesto, and pressed on that fresh rosemary foccacia? yes, please. 6 hours later, I'm still thinking about it. And I especially appreciate the non-overstuffedness of it. It left me perfectly sated, but not overfull at all. At the end of the meal, we paid our [completely reasonable] bill and were told \\"No rush! Stay as long as you'd like and listen to the [live jazz] music...\\" Such a nice and unusual sentiment these days. I'm definitely planning on trying another meal here, and hopefully get a chance to dine outside. The downfalls here are the small interior, (which is cozy, but a little warm and loud and the three of us shared a tiny table) and some seemingly hit-or-miss service. It doesn't seem really equipped for a big weekend brunch crowd, but I can imagine having a nice weekday lunch or dinner here, though, when it's quieter. In any case, I'd come back for that eggplant sandwich alone."},{"name":"The Greek By Anatoli","address":"1043 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"DoorDash delivery to try it out.

Generally its an average conveyor sushi experience. But the last couple of times we have went the selection was below par. Last night we went in around 6:30 on a friday night. We sat down, ordered some soft drinks, and took our first plate. The roll was poorly made, stuck to the plate, and fell apart as we tried to eat it. It happens... So then I look for our next plate...and notice an awful lot of salmon and very little else. When I see their rainbow roll is topped with salmon and avocado alone....I flag down a server. Our last trip, they were out of tuna...so it didnt seem unreasonable to assume the same. I asked her if they were out of tuna and she denied it, said we could order a spicy tuna if we wanted, that they just hadnt gotten to them. I asked about the rainbow rolls monochrome appearance, I pointed to the sea of orange before us....and she said they werent out, they just hadnt made anything else. The belts were full. \\nThis was unacceptable to me. So I told her we werent staying. The whole point of the conveyor sushi experience is a wide variety of tastes and flavors parading across your palette at a reasonable price. At this point we had a single $1.65 happy hour plate. We were clearly unhappy with the experience.   \\nAny reasonable restaurant would have apologized and comped the meal in an attempt to save face and business. They did not. In fact they charged us $7.80. Yes, they had us pay for 3 soft drinks that we had taken one sip a piece from. Even the parking garage across the street said we hadnt been in long enough to charge. Sushi Sakura....You have forever lost my business...and that of anyone who asks me where to go for conveyor sushi. \\nWe drove over to SushiVille in the alphabet district...and had an excellent experience. Their belts were full with a wide assortment of fish. A couple of months ago my daughters and I were eating at sushiville and we had requested Unagi as they hadnt any on the line. Minutes after we sat down, one of their sushi chefs brough us 2 plates of unagi...because they remembered that order. When I looked down the belt too long the manager came over and asked me what he could make for me....I wasnt even looking for something specific...just taking a pause. If SushiSakura had one tenth the service skills and selection of sushiville....maybe they would see us again someday.....Sakura almost ruined my dinner but sushiville saved it."},{"name":"Great Wok","address":"1181 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"This is the best Chinese food in Arlington, and better than most elsewhere.

This restaurant has been on my bucket list of Atlanta steakhouses. The decor was amazing. We started at the bar with a very knowledgeable bartender. She had some excellent whiskey recommendations (albeit pricey at $28 a pour but we knew it probably would be). We were promptly taken to our table for two. The server stopped by shortly and explained the specials and offered to answer any questions we might have. We started with the grilled bacon appetizer (YUM). It included 5 pieces of bacon with a siracha-molasses glaze. Not spicy at all. 4 out of the 5 pieces were melt in your mouth good, the 5th was way overcooked. We then shared a spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. The spinach was very fresh but the dressing was heavy in vinegar with very little bacon or egg topping. What was a little odd (I thought anyway) was a table seated a few feet from us with a toddler and a young baby. Normally I have no issues with this but we had paid for a babysitter that night so we could have a kid-free dinner and the baby ended up crying through half of the meal. Since the restaurant has a dress code (no jeans, jacket preferred), I was disappointed to see it was not enforced at all. A table nearby had people in hoodies and jeans, at 6PM on a Saturday. For dinner, we each ordered the 10oz ribeye medium rare. The temperature of the steak was correct, however, the steak was chewy and tough. We got the mac and cheese (YUM), mashed potatoes (YUM), and our server treated us to the risotto (ok but very underseasoned). The sides were barely warm. The server stopped by initially when we received our food and then we did not see her again until she brought dessert menus after our plates with uneaten steak had been cleared. We could have said something to her at that time but our plates were already gone and we'd waited long enough we figured we wouldn't make a big deal.We did get to choose a birthday dessert on the house. We chose the creme brulee since we had such a heavy meal. Unfortunately, the caramelized sugar on top was burnt. Thank goodness we didn't have to pay for that. Overall, I was disappointed. I was expecting better food/service for the price paid and the hype given. Each stage of the meal had about 10-15 minutes lag time after we finished the previous course. The restaurant had a nice ambiance until it got full, and then it was hard to talk to the person across the table due to the volume. I'm still glad I went to check this off my bucket list but we do not plan on returning."},{"name":"JuiceLand","address":"1625 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I go here regularly, meaning three times a week or more.

Forget it, this place is truly an Austin icon- one that doesn't make your waist bulge or put you into an enchilada coma.

You don't need to be on a crazy cleanse or adhere to some alternative lifestyle to get a smoothie here, you just need to love tasty food.

I've tried a variety of the bowls here: green goddess, adventurer, innocent, emperor, lover. I would recommend the first four bowls, not really too much of a fan of the lover. The ingredients they use are very fresh and even a demi sized bowl is quite filling. The smoothies are also delicious. I've tried both the carrot cake alive and lust alive.

She said they were not accepting reservations. I asked then if she could add my name to the list, something also listed on the website. She said no and sounded bothered that I was asking. I asked how long the wait would be in 20 minutes and she said 30 min. When I showed up 20 min later, she quoted me a wait time of 90 min because they had reservations she needed to seat first. I was not pleased. When I said I had called to make a reservation she wasn't swayed. Just felt like a young kid who didn't care about her job much. Anyway, lucky for him, I overheard the owner telling someone else they could eat outside at the public tables and they'd bring the order out there. Score! Even though I was peeved about the service, the food is good and my out of town guests were on a schedule. So, we nabbed a table outside and went in to order. Though he was visibly busy, the owner was super nice to us. He was very accomodating and chatty. Our food came really quickly and was delicious. As I said, his great customer service made up for the lack of the hostess's. All in all, it turned out in our favor. We got to eat outside on the first nice day of the season, were treated well by the owner, and enjoyed our food lots. Knocked them down to 4 stars because we almost missed out on all of it due to the hostess being overwhelmed."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Super-friendly staffFrequent refills of your drinksDelicious and varied foodand $2 makes your lunch special a combo (with delish soup,  two tiny cute veggie somosas, a potsticker and small salad.)I love this place!!!"},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I crave the food from Life Alive, the flavors are pure and simple and sooooo good!

It seats about 25 people. They do not make exceptions for 5 people @ 4 seaters because then no one would be able to get around your table, that's how tight the squeeze is in this place. But it really adds to the ambience of the place - it feels very mom and pop, locally owned, intimate, yet fast-paced. Everyone can see the chef do his thing since the kitchen is open and is tucked away in the corner of the restaurant. They're a bit slow when it comes to service here. We arrived @ 3:30pm or so on a Sunday afternoon and the place was being looked after by 1 waitress and 1 busboy. The busboy didn't do much else other than clean up tables and turn them over for new customers, but because he didn't help out much beyond that, the waitress' slow nature didn't help with the turning over tables. Tables would sit there for 10-20 minutes empty because she didn't have the capacity to service them.It took us about an hour or 1.5 hours to get into this place - there were 3 parties ahead of us. They're known for their calamari and their black ink pasta, both of which we ordered. We also ordered a scallop linguine.Calamari: Perfectly fried, the crust was amazing. It was light, just the right amount of crunch, slightly sweet, and really just elevated the freshness of the squid. It came with lemon to be squeezed on it but there was no marinara or anything to dip in it, and yet still SO SO good. Probably the best thing we ate here.Scallop Linguine: The scallop was really well prepared considering it was in a pasta dish. It stayed tender, was very flavorful - you could taste the sweetness of each piece, and it wasn't some cheap bay scallop, it was a full on sea scallop. There were also quite a few in the dish, which left me pleasantly surprised, just enough to go with the amount of pasta. The pasta wasn't house made / fresh but it was still cooked well - a little past al dente, which is what I prefer, and coated in this SUPER garlicky seafood marinara sauce. This was delicious even if I was sweating garlic for the next few hours.Ground Squid Black Ink Pasta: This was okay. The pasta was good, interesting because it was black, and it was certainly freshly made, so it had a good, fresh chew to it. With the ground squid, although the dish was tasty, I didn't think it was super flavorful, especially compared to the scallop linguine. They also offered this dish with alfredo sauce and another type of sauce that I wasn't familiar with (had anchovies and other things in it), which may have helped the taste profile a bit. But all in all this one was nothing to write home about.Great experience, not sure I'd wait 1.5 hours for it again though. Btw, they do TAKE OUT so if you're not into waiting and don't have to eat there, you can always take it to go and eat out at the greenway a few blocks away."},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My company hosts an annual cocktail reception here for around 60 guests in the space upstairs and Bistro Du Midi never disappoints.

A constantly replenished charcuterie board with a variety of meats, terrines, cheeses, and light pickles was stationed in one corner of the room while the other corner was a fresh flatbread station. Bar service was attentive throughout the night and my glass was never empty. The main courses were served buffet style and included roast chicken, a simple risotto, filet mignon, and roast potatoes. All of them were winners in my book! For the desserts - the winner of the night had to be the salted caramel creme puff, end of story.

So it's really just asking to have pics taken.Parking is pretty rough as it's a small lot. We've been lucky that most days we can snag a spot in front of the shop.Overall, Atl Vivi's is a good boba tea shop. They have a lot of fun drinks and a variety at that. So far I haven't really had a bad tasting tea, but they can go crazy over the top with the sugar that it might be undrinkable. So unless you like that much sugar you'll need to do some alterations. I always end up picking 25% and it's still fairly sweet on some teas. Though the staff will sometimes say that a tea will come out bitter or not tastes as good without the added sugar--- to this I've found to be utter BS. So there's that. Don't be afraid to try out something if you aren't super into a lot of sugar.Favs here are definitely the fruit jelly teas with the pulp. They remind me of these fruit cups I used to get a lot in Japan. Especially, the grapefruit. Super good if you like jelly and pulpy drinks.With the saturation of boba shops in the area it'll be a feat to get through the menu. Wish they'd get in the Galaxy tea drink that turns blue though.

They're cut thin like potato chips and have the perfect amount of crunch and salt. We had the chicken and waffles with gravy and BBQ brisket plate. Don't skip out on the gravy, it was the perfect accompaniment to our waffles. The chicken was fried so beautifully and had just enough seasoning to keep it interesting. I've had chicken and waffles where there's too much going on and not enough flavor, but that's not the case here. Also, the BBQ brisket was slow cooked and soft enough to just glide through your fork. Such an amazing meal to start off our Sunday. We'd definitely come back."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been here twice. And we will definitely go back again. We drove over 3 hours to Atlanta partially for some good food.

I could understand the frustration people sometime had regarding certain food or service. But I have to say we need make a fair judgement by comparing others. I feel Nori Nori does much better than many other buffets. Yes this is a buffet style restaurant and offering the variety and doing their best for the quality. I believe they did a very good job. Cold food, hot food and sweet food, I think you could at least find some that you like.

I came here with a group of friends and needless to say, we were probably the only non-Koreans in the whole restaurant.  We didn't mind that, it really just gave us hope that we were going to experience some authentic Korean food.I don't know if I just wasn't feeling it, but didn't have much taste in what I order.   It was a relatively big group but they only gave us enough side dishes for half of the table and we had to ask them more than once if our side could also have side dishes.  Service was not that great.When we were done eating, they told us they would only accept two credit cards and there was a minimum.  Uh...not the best thing to tell college students who normally only pay for themselves and rarely ever carry cash.  Luckily, most of my friends paid in cash but I was one of the ones who paid with card.They added a 15% gratuity to the bill and that was fine since I already expected to pay it.  The lady rang me up for $25 dollars since I was also paying for another friend.  When she asked if I wanted my receipt, I declined and went on my merry little way.  HOWEVER, when I check my bank statement a couple of days later, I noticed that the restaurant had added a nice tip for themselves that I did not sign for.  They charged my card $29.   I proceeded to slap myself for not taking the receipt but I didn't know they were gonna be conniving, sneaky, greedy little bastards.  Worst experience ever.

First, it's a little difficult to find.  Once I found it, I realized I was in some sort of cell signal wasteland.  I was waiting for a friend at the bar and had no way of communicating to my friend that I was there etc.  I had to physically go outside to get a signal as even by the windows didn't work.  The server mentioned to me that it's a problem for everyone in there.  No wifi is available by the way.  That being said...on to the food...I ordered the swordfish, which was lacking in any flavor whatsoever and was overcooked and dry.  Meh, is the best word to describe it.  My friend however had the lamb steak and enjoyed it very much.  We both felt that the protein portion of our meals was under seasoned however.   Continuing on with the seasoning issue...for the table we ordered the mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts.  The mashed potatoes were extremely salty.  They were inedible and we had to send them back.  The brussel sprouts were just ok.The service was excellent from the moment I entered the restaurant.  I was greeted by a server who noticed me waiting in the bar area and was asked if I'd like to see a menu while I wait and if I would like something to drink.  Our server, Devon (sp?) was excellent and handled the mashed potato problem like a true professional.  I might try this place in a month or two when they've had a chance to taste the food that they're putting out themselves...because that clearly didn't happen last night.

I'm a fairly regular customer and lately they've gotten extremely sloppy with their service. My last visit may have been my last. This weekend I ordered 3 take-out dinner entrees for 3 people and arrived to the restaurant a couple minutes after they said it would be ready. When I arrived the bags were ready at the counter but after looking at the receipt they told me that one of the meals was not ready yet and went into the back. 15 minutes later they finally brought out the dish. Clearly they forgot about it. What I didn't realize was that one of the meals that was sitting there was a \\"crispy\\" pork dish, that because of the long wait, was no longer crispy but rubbery and gross by the time we got it home. Then, I realized that they gave us only 3 tiny side dishes total. This really put me over the edge. When I order dinner for myself there, I ALWAYS get 5-6 small side dishes, and they're always great. When I called to complain they said that when 3 or more people order for take-out they use the larger containers. OK, but they weren't even a quarter filled and there were only 3 of them!! They said \\"next time we will take care of you\\" Thanks, but I don't think there will be a next time.This was a complete waste of money and and a slap in the face to a regular customer.

But beyond all of that there is a kolache war going on between Lone Star and the Kolache Factory, who are separated by no more than 200 yards.So I decided to check both of them out for comparison.  In the end I think both have their own things going for them, no one really stood out the outright winner.  I compared the sausage and cheese, polish hot, and ham and cheese croissants.  Kolache Factory positives:\\n- I found their ham and cheese croissant to be better than Lone Star's, it had more filling and tasted great.  You also get half off after 1:30pm, which gives you 30 min since they close at 2pm.  Lone Star offers 1/2 off at Noon.  Polish Sausage hot and sausage + cheese are popular kolaches, I found Lone Star's to be slightly better - - bigger polish sausage and they have a slightly sweeter bun, but that preference is yours.  The quality is still good here.    So the choice is yours, but that's my breakdown.

We had to wait 10 minutes after we were done for her to pop back up to request our check. This was most aggravating because it wasn't full, and they were working off of a smaller menu. I couldn't order a few things I'd seen on the website menu. The sweet tea was good! The experience left much to be desired. The best part of the night was talking to the hostess. I'd need a table and a different waitress to want to try this place again."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Mom's in town, where should I take her? She's not picky, will eat anything especially if it has tentacles, and is not too particular about personal space. Obviously I bring her here, a place no one else will go with me!Based on other reviews we were prepared for a long wait at 6 of a Friday, but got in right away. I had to sit sideways, but didn't mind, as I was too busy chugging my wine out of a plastic cup anyway.  The bread was meh, but the calamari appetizer was incredible. Not chewy AT ALL and basically ruined other calamari for me because this was so fresh.I got confused reading other reviews about black pasta and the squid pasta. Here is the secret, they are the same thing.  So I ordered two half dishes-the ground up squid with black pasta and the pepper and onions with black pasta.  Both were good, but the pepper and onions with the pasta was my favorite. The ground up squid had a ton of garlic and definitely required a shower post-consumption.Moms had shrimp and scallops with pasta, I stole a scallop and it was tender and awesome. Kind of wish I could have gotten her order, but with the black pasta. I think they would  have accommodated this, so if I ever have  the fortune of going back I'd order a dish and sub the black pasta.It was a bit pricey, considering the amenities the place was lacking-legroom, glasses that didn't collapse once your drink was empty, you know-the fancy stuff.

But before I get into the negative, some good things first. I am a proud omnivore. The rarer the meat the better. But living in Cambridge one racks up quite a few friends with dietary restrictions. So a place like Life Alive is a life saver. I've never had vegan food taste so...savory. I enjoy the Swami and the Adventurer quite a lot. I think I've had the green goddess and enjoyed that one too. I'm also a huge sucker for the Lust Alive smoothie. Here's a secret...I get food here even without my vegan friends. The downside...sad to say there are quite a few. For one, it's always packed. A good sign right? But overall the service is overwhelmed and ends up being quite slow. Doesn't help that you've got your usual Cambridge a-holes who believe getting a smoothie is the rights to a table for you and your laptop for eight hours. You can order by phone and pick up your food-something I highly recommend doing. It's not even the wait it's the space and they also tend to prioritize phone orders. BUT, good luck getting them on the phone. I tried once ten times in a row with no success (yes, it was a craving). Another negative is the decor. The orientalism is garish and...let's just say it's one of the reasons I get my food to go. But the worst, and the main reason why this place doesn't get five stars, is the cleanliness. This is a place where people with dietary restrictions go. Vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, they got you covered. But their utter disregard for other allergies is appalling. For one, anyone with a nut allergy should be warned to keep to a five mile radius of this place. But even for other allergies it's a minefield. My friend is allergic to banana, although it takes a bit of banana in something for it to affect him. I order one of the two non-banana containing smoothies to share (the Coco Loco) and within a few minutes the poor guy is in the throes of an allergic reaction. I specified at the counter that it was an allergy and they assured me that it was ok because you can add or subtract whatever from your smoothie. Which...doesn't really mean much but overall it's a big concern for everyone here. The people who want to eat halal or vegan are then faced with the fact that their food has probably not been prepared conscientiously enough. I feel bad for the ciliacs too who are likely to encounter gluten here as well."},{"name":"Cuba 512","address":"6800 West Gate Blvd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"One of our neighborhood favorites.

Besides that, everything is great.The owner is usually present and is very talkative, he even tries to speed things up with the waiters while you wait in line so you do not have to wait too long. One time ever, we should up a little past their breakfast schedule and he still had the chefs allow us to order from the breakfast menu. As well as keep us company while we waited outside for our table and tell us a little of the story behind Cafe Luna. What is nice about Cafe Luna as well are the live performances by local artists in the area, which provide a very comfortable and chill breakfast. The menu is amazing, and their twist of breakfast mixed with seafood was delicious. Anything Lobster is a must try for when you visit. As well as anything mixed with Hollandaise.

The food is okay, the staff is okay, the seating is okay. There's nothing that makes it pop, nothing that makes it extraordinary. It's just a pizza place. I've been here a handful of times and each visit is eerily similar to the previous. I get a sandwich or a slice, sit down, crack open a book, read and eat, eat and read, and after an hour or so I kick it outta there because the drunk suits are driving me crazy with their loud-talking and the tv is blaring a Nascar race. Or something as equally annoying. Perhaps I should visit sometime other than mid-day during the work week -- but I have nothing better to do than judge places based on being mostly empty at 3pm on a Tuesday afternoon. But on the bright side -- at least they were only \\"mostly\\" empty, instead of \\"totally\\" empty. So... hey! Good for them. If I'm looking for a convenient pizza place to hang out with my friends and drink a ton of beer -- then this would be my pick. It's A-OK, not super special or anything.

My friend and I flew up to Boston during the week for a day, just to get away.  We were searching for good seafood, and Yelp led me to this little hole-in-the-wall gem.  Located in the North End of Boston (Orange or Green subway to Haymarket and a short walk after), this little gem is located right across the street from the infamous Mike's Pastry's (who doesn't walk out of North End without those little boxes?).  We went on a Tuesday evening around 7pm.  There was a short line (party of 6 and party of 2 ahead of us).  This place is TINY.  There is very little wiggle room once you're seated.  My pregnant friend had trouble with one seat that backed to someone else who was also wedged in.  While we were waiting outside for a table, everytime the door opened, you could smell the garlic sauce waft out, and it was heavenly. There are no bathrooms and it's cash only.  The decor is shabby - front window was broken and the mirror on the back wall is cracked top to bottom.  The kitchen area, dishwashing station, and wait station and 10 tables of 2 are crammed into an area that can't be more than 20 x 30 space or so.  Paper placemats and plastic cups are used, and food is served in the skillet it's cooked in. Minimalistic and practical.We were lucky to be seated on the wall with the menu - and a bunch of awards and news stories through the years.  We were able to read about the family, and see photos of the chef cooking in his younger years.After pouring over the menu in its entirety, the waitress came by and asked what she advised. She suggested a seafood pasta plate (not on the menu).  It had a range of seafood on it, and we both ordered it - one in white sauce, and one in red. My skillet came with a lot of scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, squid.  For $26, this was an incredible value. The clams and mussels were cooked perfectly, as they were open and plump, and not shriveled up and dried out as some places do. The red sauce was garlicky but not excessively so. It was well-balanced and delicious. I did not need to add any of the condiments on the table (vinegar, oil, salt, pepper, and Parmesan  cheese).  I ate about half of my portion, and carried the rest out.  My friend added Parm to her dish before I tried it, so I didn't try it without, but it was equally good as well. I disagree that this place is pricey (20-30 a plate), aortion sizes were huge (it was enough for 2 meals) and there was a TON of seafood in the meal. I had the leftovers for lunch today and I'm stuffed. The emphasis is clearly on the quality of the food and flavors here.  The bread is purchased from a bakery on Pike street (the waitress referenced the name but I didn't remember it).  We were fortunate to come here during the week, and avoid the major lines. Truth be told, I don't know if i'd come wait in line for 2 hours here to get a table, but I would definitely try if I were in town.  As critical as the negatives above may seem, I'm ok with all of them (except the bathroom thing - but I don't think that's changing anytime soon)  as the quality of food and the experience is amazing. Just don't come here looking for a classy cloth napkin type, and understand it's a hole with incredible food. I can't wait to try the calamari meatballs next time!"},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"hands down - the best place to eat in boston!!!\\n'nuff said."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The Summary:\\nUpscale trendy restaurant with a blend of Thai and Malaysian food.  While on the expensive side, the food is good and I would recommend it for people looking to go somewhere for a special occasion.The Background:\\nPok Pok is located in a cluster of Thai restaurants.  While I haven't explored the neighborhood, I think I must have driven by at least 3 different Thais restaurants on the same residential road.  The restaurant itself is pretty nifty with a mixed dark interior/bar area and a nicely decorated outdoors area.  The plus side of being outdoors is that you can see them grilling the food on the barbeque and smell the food as it's being prepared.  As for the d√©cor, it is quite nice and is very tastefully done.The Positives:\\nThe food here is pretty good.  Like everyone else who seems to go to this place, we ended up getting a whole Pok Pok (game hen) and the Papaya salad.  But since our waiter kindly informed us that those two dishes wouldn't be enough, we ended up adding the Laksa.  The Pok Pok is very nicely cooked and comes with a sweet sauce and a spicy sweet sauce both of which was excellent.  Maybe it's just because I'm not huge on salads, but I thought the Papaya salad was pretty mediocre and not really worth the price or the calories.  Finally, the Laksa was definitely quite bland.  The noodles in the Laksa were pretty good but the soup itself had almost no flavor.  They did however provide us with this spicy shrimp paste which was most definitely quite spicy.  By quite spicy, I mean burns the rough of your tongue, makes your scalp tingle, and causes you to hiccup spicy.  Even my friend who can't find food anywhere that is spicy enough said that it was quite a spicy paste.The Negatives:\\nPok Pok is quite expensive.  Dinner for two ran over $40 and neither of us got alcohol.  While the food and atmosphere were both quite nice and enjoyable, I don't think it was worth the price unless you are here for a special occasion."},{"name":"Mango Mango Dessert Atlanta","address":"5177-A Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"The service is horrible.

A very large dining area, they have a very interesting back wall that literally is a wall of sea shells. We order drinks and I get my quintessential Dark n' Stormy, it was well made.

They have varieties from the East and West coast. We ask the server for a breakdown and she gives a good detailed description of the various oysters and her personal thoughts on some of them. They were, of course, delicious. My main course was lobster. Pieces of lobster tail and claw that are still in the shell but cut in half so it's easy to get to the meat.

A salad with different toppings and various greens could be classified as appealing, but I question any other description.  Nothing stood out from the ingredients that makes it one of a kind, amazing, great, refreshing, gorgeous, beautiful or the like.   Typical greens,  tomatoes, peppers, cheese and throw on salmon, steak or chicken.  Those are your salad choices.   Second, the majority of the menu IS typical \\"fryer\\" bar food. Especially the chicken tenders, which after you're finished hacking away at the breading, you find some chicken.  But the taste isn't chicken, its more like eating a meaty french fry.  After my son had a few bites of his, he asked if he could go next door to another establishment for food.  he's eaten chicken tenders all over the east coast and most of his life, if he doesn't like them, i believe him.    The flat bread was disappointing.  I had the sprinter.  Lacking creativity, the chicken was dry.  The flat bread itself wasn't your normal crispy crust, as you would assume it should be.  Nothing stood out as I ate it.   I even remember wonder if maybe some sauce or something could be added to bring some flavor.   I didn't try them, but i was told the Mussels were great from a very reliable source.  Which is odd to me.  Not everyone can fix a decent mussel, but your generic flat bread or chicken tender is sub-par?  The beer menu is another typical selection.  I wonder when new places are going to see that Orlando has been moving towards real craft beers?  sure, offer your watery yellow beers, but how about a better selection of real craft beers.  if you can walk in a store like 7-11 to buy beer for your business, I feel you need to broaden your horizon a tad.  Visit some local brewers in florida.   Cigar City is one that comes to mind.  Shocktop, bluemoon and the like aren't craft beers, in my opinion. There are a few specialty items that are fine, but that list is lacking enough that \\"specialty\\" is hardly defined.   its a small place, which I like.  open floor plan, great.  The TV's are easily seen and large enough for big parties.  The two main tv's could  and should be positioned higher on the wall though.  if you're sitting at one of the tables directly in front of the two tv's (no idea why you would put a table in front of a tv that is mounted so low) , the people behind you trying to watch their favorite sports team can be quite upset, and rightfully so.For a large party, the service is confusing.  They can lose track of who they saw first, who wants what drinks or dishes, who to bring out checks for and  take extra time getting drinks.  the place is small, i don't understand the amount of time it takes.  maybe its from not having the process down fully?this place has potential, but needs a menu revamp and \\"on their toes\\" staff.  I hope they can pull it together, its close enough for me to visit for sporting events, just can't see the reason with the food and beer selection. Good luck"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"First time back in Austin in 5 years, and on a H-O-T summer Sunday. Concierge at the Austin Hilton recommended this place a block & half away.Great casual atmosphere and the nicest bartenders and waitstaff I have encountered in a long time. Bypassing the 45 minute wait for a table, I sought out & found an open seat in the back bar, where it was cool, but warm & friendly at the same time.One of the bartenders gave me the lowdown on Sunday Brunch. And recommended a Bloody Mary, for which they make their own mix in-house ... and man am I glad she did! It was delicious and took the edge off an already long travel day.The brunch stations were great, and carried a plethora of Tex-Mex and southern favorites. There were mini-buttermilk biscuits, ham, gravy, chicken-fried steak, all kinds of sweet breads, salads, grits, and fresh fruit. I sampled far too much!

We stuck with the wonton soup (nothing in it but wontons, but they were amazing), the orange chicken and some beef dish which I can't remember.  The orange chicken was really good.  The sauce was tasty and they cooked it just enough so that it was crispy without being dried out.  The only funny part was when we were trying to leave later.  We couldn't get the waiter's attention and were forced to wave our arms at him for ten minutes to get him to bring the check over and then again to get him to pick it up again with our credit cards.

I hate standing in a line of my peers for weekend brunch. Granted, Cafe Luna is one of the few weekend brunches in Cambridge-Somerville that I might consider standing in line for, but even then, nope, not gonna do it. I'm grumpy, I'm impatient, and I'm tired. My work schedule gives me certain weekday mornings off, so being out and about among the hustle of weekend brunch humanity makes me especially angry. I'm always comparing it (unfavorably) to the happy lull of a quiet weekday morning breakfast. Stand in line for weekend brunch? No way. That's just me.So here's the deal: my sister-in-law wanted to take me out for my birthday last month, and she wanted to go to Saturday brunch in Cambridge. What does she do? She calls Cafe Luna and makes RESERVATION. What? A weekend brunch that takes reservation? Yes. We arrived five minutes early with one member of our party missing. There was a line out the door in the bitter cold - typical weekend brunch in Cambridge. Someone who must have been the manager was walking around greeting people, smiling, reassuring potential customers but forcefully enforcing the rules and logic of the line (I appreciate that). He told us we'd have to wait for the missing member of our party to arrive; she did arrive a few minutes late, and we were promptly seated. I was amazed. A weekend brunch that takes reservations, treats its customers humanely, and does it all efficiently. That alone wouldn't earn Cafe Luna five stars. The brunch was incredible. I ordered \\"everything but the kitchen sink,\\" a menu item that allowed me to sample all their meats, their lovely citrusy hollandaise sauce (I love it when you can really taste the citrus), an egg, and a waffle. The corned beef hash was out of sight. The ham was perfect (I'm a ham snob). The waffle blew my mind. This particular dish didn't feature maple syrup, but the waffle was sweet enough on its own. My wife ordered the eggs benedict, which I tried and found delicious. I absolutely loved every part of this breakfast...and I'm not normally enthusiastic about breakfast fare. (One of the reasons I refuse to stand in line for brunch is that, normally, I don't like brunch all that much!) One complaint: our waiter, though excellent, didn't offer any coffee refills. The restaurant was PACKED, and although we felt comfortable and not crowded in, I think it affected the service. I'd generally deduct a star for an empty coffee mug, but everything else about Cafe Luna deserves five stars. What a great experience!

The pictures in the menu though it won't look exactly like that the portion should be about the same regardless if it's to go or dined in.... I also figured since it's a dessert place it'll all be cold lol. The \\"ube\\" soup is nothing great at all. Also very much hot. They give you like idk a small teaspoon of sago? and the size it came in? Small tiny ice cream cup type thing. I don't recommend this place.

Over the last month, we've gotten pretty poor service, mixed up orders and a whole lot of attitude. Here's my review:I have been eating at Life Alive since the very first day it opened. I visit the Cambridge branch around 3-4 times a week, for lunch/dinner smoothies. As mentioned, in the last month, things have really gone downhill. We all make mistakes, we all have bad days, and I'm sympathetic to that. But the recent incidents make me question whether I would loyally continue going to this place.Last week, we walked into the Cambridge branch, placed an order at the register. A member of the life alive team brought our order over, and asked: \\"Did you get the right order yesterday\\" (there had been two mix ups, first with the dressing, then with\\nthe actual dish we'd ordered - adventurer instead of mistic mountain). I replied\\n\\"no, we ended up with the wrong dressing on both the salad and the noodles. It's\\nok, it was different, and we liked it anyway\\". The response was \\"no, you must\\nhave been mistaken, I made them myself, I'm certain you got the right order and\\nI didn't mess up\\". We shrugged it off, we had dinner and left. We've experienced more and more attitude of this kind from staff in the last month. OK. Maybe that's poor training, or new staff not really understanding what's meant to be expected. I'm still happy to give them the benefit of the doubt here.\\n \\nBut, while I was waiting for our smoothies, I noticed things that I've never seen\\nhappen at Life Alive before. A member of the team was making a juice, and he\\npicked up a bottle, and starting putting some honey/maple syrup into the cup.\\nHe then realised that he'd made a mistake, and put the wrong thing into the cup\\n(he'd put quite an amount into it). He then went on to pick up the correct\\nbottle, and just add it into the juice, and served it up like that. We also saw similar things going on with the dishes, when we were waiting for our late lunch earlier that day. I'm not sure if you can understand my frustration at this point. I mean, I like this place to the point of where I go 3-4 times a week. Messing up an\\norder is one thing, the bad attitude I can deal with, but putting things into\\ndishes that's not meant to be in them is a health hazard. What if that had been\\nmy juice and I had an allergy to whatever he'd put into them? Everyone makes mistakes, everyone has bad days, but lately the errors being made do not seem to be rectified well. I'm not asking for special treatment, just politeness, and my order correctly made. Is that too much to ask?Sorry Life Alive."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Reservations - Highly recommended.

The crust was chewy and tough while the bread itself was mushy. It was not a good combination.Perhaps my impression of the food was due to the slow service. I received my food 10 minutes after the rest of my party had received theirs. There's was a slight mishap with one of our orders and perhaps that created a delay in the dishes.

Nor how you'll be hard put to find serious Northern Thai food like this anywhere else without actually going to Chaing Mai. Nor what a great place it is on a warm night if you can get a picnic table outside.  Nor even that it's worth the wait, and that the prices are an absolute bargain considering what you get.So, given that other people have already said all that, I'm going to focus on the people who should NOT go to Pok Pok.  If you fit one of the categories on this list, do yourself a favor and go to one of the 200+ pedestrian Thai joints in Portland.  You'll be happier.1. People who go to dinner at 7:30 and can't deal with waiting in line.  There's two choices at Pok Pok: arrive at 6pm on a weekday, or wait in line for an hour.  It's the top-reviewed Thai restaurant in the USA, what did you expect?  BTW, arriving at 6pm on a weekday is an excellent way to avoid the lines.2. Folks who can't take spicy food.  Food on the menu ranges from \\"peppery\\" to \\"OMG RICE NOW!\\".  If you are sensitive to capsicum, there really is nothing on the menu for you.  Sorry.3. Strict vegetarians (let alone vegans).  The only things on the menu which are completely vegetarian that I saw were the rice and the drinks.  Yeah, you can ask them to make something vegetarian, but then it won't really be the food Pok Pok is capable of, will it?4. People who are unwilling to try strange foods and eating with your hands.  I've *been* to Thailand, and I still had to ask the server how to eat one of the dishes.  And we definitely needed the supplied wet naps.5. People who want Pad Thai.

The Meatball Stoppe is definitely run like a mom and pop place. We walked in and were seated quickly by a young waitress. The owner (I assume) greeted us as well and offered to bring us menus since we didn't have any. The waitress then quickly returned to take on us a walk-thru of the menu with pictures on an ipad. I will say that helped to get a visual of the many different versions of meatballs and other menu items they offer. I chose the Stoppe Trio: three meatballs with a side salad and side. I chose a chicken parm, traditional, and mac n cheese ball. The traditional was great, beef meatball with a tomato sauce. Flavored and seasoned well. The mac n cheese was delicious as well, embedded with orzo pasta. The chicken parm had to be both my husband and my least favorite. Just lacked seasoning compares to the others. For sides you can choose between penne or linguine with sauce, polenta, or white bean ragu. I went with the penne and creamy provolone- it did not disappoint! My husband ordered the appetizer of 5 balls for his meal and he was stuffed. The waitress seemed unsure at first if he could order different flavors and had to check, but they said it was ok. At $8.95, the price is fantastic. He also decided on a glass of wine. I will say they noticeably underpour. Had to be maybe 3 oz in their wine pour.

For content, I don't think it gets any better than this book store. I can find bookstores that match the contents probably, but not better than Powell's. The Portland/Oregon trinketery is pretty impressive. I suggest the one near philosophy/history section that has a very diverse selection of postcards, shot glasses, etc.Also, people tend to forget the other store across the road that has all the science books. It's smaller but cozy, and the book selection is very excellent and the topics are sorted very well so I can even browse mathematics books properly (something that is oddly quite rare in most bookstores who tend to lump all the math books together)During my week spent in Portland, I visited this store 4 times.

There is also a very extensive drink menu with quite a few interesting concoctions. Service was friendly and extremely attentive. OK, now on to the food. My boyfriend and I tried a little sampling of fresh oysters from everywhere from Plymouth to Washington State. I have to say my favorite was not surprisingly the \\"Island Creek Oyster\\" itself. It was like taking a little bite of summer. For my entree I had the pan seared scallops over asparagus and prosciutto. Scallops are one of my favorite things to order, but I don't think they will ever be the same for me after having these.

Nice homey type of place, just looking at it, it's clear that it is a comfort joint that doesnt have up to date appliances, which isnt a bad thing. It's exactly what I look for when I want to feel lm at a place where I can get a warm hug from just eating. I had the chicken and waffles. In its description, it said the waffle is made of corn bread. I dont hate the idea, but I had a slight slight disappointment that it wasnt buttermilk. Maybe if i ask for it to be buttermilk instead, they would. but it really wasnt bad, it was definitely something new to try and its very unique for adding in that creativity. The chicken though, WOW. it was 3 large strips, putting it together can look as huge as a chicken breast really made the comfort eating it with the waffle. and their gravy? it says its an extra $2 and i was very hesitant because it would have to taste crazy good for it to be worth $2. and it was! maybe id be more comfortable paying just a dollar but you really cant eat it without the gravy. it really makes a nice kick to it.why I had to take away a star, the price seem pretty steep. just like any other diners, they can fool you with seeing an item cheap (chicken and waffles were $11) plus adding a coffee and the side of gravy, it's $18 with tip. kinda burnt a hole through my wallet. but I dont regret it. just giving a heads up if you like the full experience like i did.

It's certainly a hole in the wall type of restaurant and I think it is family-owned. The 2 servers have been the same for the last year that I have come here. They are both really friendly and nice. From my very first visit here I had the Caprese salad, and the Penne Arrabiata. Although I see other plates that look really good, I'm so in love with the Penne Arrabiata that I can't give it up. The tomatoes taste really fresh and there are whole, roasted, garlic cloves..... The sauce is so delicious that I'd go as far as calling it, \\"life-changing.\\" It's the best tomato/Arrabiata sauce I've ever had, ever. They also bring you complimentary bread (which is super fresh) with olive oil and balsamic dipping sauce. I usually walk out of here stuffed.

So much potential to be a world class market, but much of it unrealized and unfulfilled. Bambie and me had an early dinner. We were beat down from another touristy day of jamming 11 hours worth of activity into an 8 hour day. Choosing the Vancouver fish company restaurant when we ran out of gas on Granville island seemed like a best bet / reasonable compromise.  At 6pm on a September Tuesday the place was nearly deserted. Damn it, I'm too tired to go schlepping around Kitsilano to find a better dining option.  We were seated immediately.  Hafez our gracious and friendly server came quickly for a moment of greeting, banter, and to relieve our parched throats with drink orders. The on-tap beer selection has a dozen local brews. I got a pale ale that's made down the street. Bambie ordered a Pinot noir from the Okanagan valley. Both beverages were quite acceptable. Dinner items we ate were:  seafood chowder, sable fish with vegetables and a big green salad with a hunk of sockeye salmon. Truly all the food was good tasting and of adequate portions. Nothing remarkable, yet satisfying.Prices are tourist trap high for the quality of the food and the rather time worn and tired feeling dining room. My sablefish plate was $36. None the less the meal was better than any available inside the public market.  I speak from experience. See my review of the oil laden meal I bought 2 days before from Celine's.  And eating at a table in the food court area of the public market warehouse is a nerve racking experience. Frantic and noisy.

I don't mind spending an extra buck on a Great Lakes, but 6 dollars for a pint?    Seems kinda high for a campus area bar.    Their food specials are confusing.    A student special for the hours of 2-4?   Most kids are in class or practice at that time?

Quite excellent.But the Somerville location disappoints in comparison.  The menu suggests you can order for take out, delivery, or dine in.  Umm, dine in?  The place is super tiny - I don't think there's even a table.  So, there's no hanging around and eating, nor is there a buffet.  Boo.But are the wings as good?  Sort of.  The wings at the Ithaca location always seemed to be fresher -- these seem as if they have always been sitting around for a while in a container, which I guess they are -- but the Ithaca location managed to have them be less soggy.The staff?  I've placed orders on the phone twice and it's been incredibly difficult.  The first time, the woman put me on hold for almost 5 minutes before taking my order.  When I arrived, she was talking on her cell phone, seemingly in an argument with her significant other.  Yes, she made me wait until she was done on her cell phone before helping me.  I really hope that's not why she put me on hold for so long.  Second time, the woman (same one?) rushed me through my order on the phone.

It's not cooked in the meal, obviously, but the service is more episodic than attentive, so sending a dish back means you'd get it around dessert time.I usually don't whine about architecture but having only two bathrooms for such a busy restaurant, making them male/female (guarantee of a long line, always)  and putting them right by the busiest place in the whole place is retarded --- having a bunch of pretentious servers glare while waiting to piss isn't the best turn of phrase for a meal.

The service really is the down fall of this place is \\"meh\\" at best, one and done for me, a real shame because the chef is a really diligent and dedicated worker...the hostess, however, is no help at all.... mhmm"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"So.

After years of hype maybe it's lost the integrity in there food because people are willing to line up and pay. The wings sounded like the star of the show but they where not shining today. We ordered them spicy but they had no hint of spice at all. The prawn gravy noodle dish was just bland. I felt like I was eating a dish at Olive Garden between the sauce and consistency. It also seems so silly to be spending $15 plus for the main dishes and having to pay for rice separately. As for the service it was spotty. It seems like with all the walkie talkie action they have they would been on there game but I guess they where just to busy talking to each other to check on there guests.

Our server was very aware of how overhwelmeing the menu can be and explain the types of rice to get per Thai tradition. He also explained how to best eat the dishes i.e. with your hands, etc. We ordered the coconut curry noodles, mushroom salad and veggie stir fry. The mushroom salad was my favorite, the mushrooms were cooked perfectly and all the spices complemented one another. The sticky rice was very fun to eat with it! The coconut curry noodles was so creamy and had the perfect spice, I also really like the crunchy stuff on top. The sauteed veggies didn't have a ton of flavor like the others but it was simple and tasty still. We finished with durian ice cream, I was excited bc I like it and my gf and her friend had never tried it. My gf didn't like the flavor which is fair but the other liked it. It was so creamy and a good flavor of durian. Not too stinky haha!

Each dish has its own uniqueness. Everything tasted great, especially the chicken wings. I also had a Thai iced tea (very delicious!). The dinning ambiance was comforting.

We started with the toasted ravioli, I ordered the shrimp mediterranean and he ordered the chicken foccacia. They start out by serving you with some bread and oil, which in my opinion, set the tone for the meal. It was pretty bland, nothing to write home about. In fact, that's how we ended up feeling about the whole meal. The toasted ravioli was meh, the marina sauce was very bland and did not taste home made. Very sweet and bland. My shrimp mediterranean came with an irredescent neon sauce that was purported to be a lobster cream sauce (no chunks of lobster, really no lobster taste). The cream just tasted like cream, I couldn't taste any herbs or even any garlic. It was super super bland. The only upside to this dish was that they were fairly generous with the shrimp. My husband thought his chicken was very tasty but the dish was covered in an indiscriminate brown tinted sauce that was flavorless as well. We ended up taking the rest of it home because we thought we could do a better job of salvaging the dish at home. My husband ended up sauteeing his with garlic which greatly improved the taste. We also had issues with the waitress, she never came back to ask if we would like more refills even though she repeatedly walked past our table to other tables. We were initially heartened by the prices on the menu, we thought we were in for a well done tasty meal. Instead, the prices were exhorbitant for what you get, the portions are large but we would prefer better quality food for that price instead of monster portions. These are close to Boston prices and the menu and food are nowhere near as impressive."},{"name":"Soi9 Thai Eatery","address":"1914 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm not one to get excited easily about a restaurant but this place really did exceed my expectations.

That's all I need to say about Kevin Rathbun Steak.Mere hours before a group of five of us arrived there on a Friday night, I was able to make a reservation online (shocking to me) and it was a fantastic choice. My boyfriend was hosting a co-worker from Berlin, Germany in the office that week, and his one request while in the States was to go to a steakhouse. No problem. When we arrived at 9:15 for our reservation, a hostess seated us immediately near the open kitchen and I had a chance to take it all in as our waiter, Kyle descended on us.Kyle gave us superb service all night long - he was the perfect mix of friendliness and professionalism at once. After Kyle had taken our drink orders for the table I had a good look around the renovated cotton warehouse that makes up KRS. It's a huge space, wide-open with tall ceilings, lower lighting, comfortable tables and white tablecloths. It's a great vibe - trust me. Yes, a little loud and energetic because everything is open and exposed, but still a great date spot nonetheless. If you're at all familiar with Two Urban Licks, it's a little like that.But enough about the decor, you want to know about the food - the main piece, the best part.Any menu that has bacon as an appetizer is off to a good start, I think. KRS has grilled bacon on there. I kid you not. Naturally, having dinner with four, meat-loving men, this was the first unanimous decision of the group. Bacon it was! Three of the men were dying to try the dry-aged steak that KRS is famous for, and lucky for them there was an option to share a giant steak for three on the menu, so their decisions were made. My boyfriend opted to try the 10 oz ribeye (he considers himself an expert of ribeyes, and so had to try this one). I, on the other hand, wasn't feeling in a \\"steak-y\\" mood, so I got the duck two ways instead. We also got sides to share for the table: mac'n'cheese, collard greens and the house vegetable which turned out to be butter beans (like light green beans) with chantrelle mushrooms. Yum!The bacon was melt in your mouth good - no joke. It was big, thick slabs that looked more like boneless ribs than bacon strips. Just delicious though - I would highly recommend you try it. And then the entrees came...When the steak for three was delivered with much pomp and circumstance, the mens' eyes nearly popped out of their heads - it was that impressive. Giant is an understatement for this steak - and only huge, but also surprisingly tender (I guess from the dry aging). My boyfriend's steak was also impressive, but the best presentation in my mind was my duck. It was a well-seasoned, grilled duck breast sliced and served across a mixture of mushrooms, shredded duck, crispy onion strings and some thick, rich, decadent sauce. I'm not exactly sure what I was eating, but it was rich and indulgent and great!As we all tucked into our dishes, total silence descended on the table, the likes of which is only seen with a truly excellent meal. This was a truly excellent meal. While the steak may have been destined for three, it could easily have fed four or five hungry men with ease. We made a good go of everything - the mac'n'cheese and butter beans were fantastic as well, but in the end there was still a bit left over.Sadly there was no room for dessert, but I'd love to go back in the future and better pace myself so I could try it then. All in all, KRS blew my mind in the best way possible. It's been a while since I've had a meal that was that good. I would strongly encourage you to go dine there if you are a meat-eater in any way, shape or form."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went with a couple friends today for lunch.

Took my brother here for his 40th birthday. When I made reservations I informed the restaurant it was my brother's bday. They have special birthday menus for the birthday person, so it was a nice added touch. The restaurant itself was beautiful inside. Our waitstaff was absolutely great. Our waitress was very friendly, bubbly, gave us great suggestions, very tentative to us, and made sure we were taken care of from start to finish. The bread and butter they gave us was soo good and fresh. We ordered 3 types of oysters, through the recommendation of our waitress, all 3 were really fresh and delicious; exactly as we were leaning towards salt level and texture wise. We had the Fried Oyster Sliders and those were absolutely delicious. I could have just ordered a bunch of those and clam chowder and would have been happy. Clam chowder was great. Not too salty or thick. Loaded with chunks of clams and the mini buttermilk biscuits were a perfect touch. My brother ordered the Bluefish. I had a piece and it was seared nicely with a nice crispy exterior and perfect on the inside. You can taste the freshness of the fish and came together great with the bacon bits and corn. My boyfriend and I ordered the Lobster Risotto (sadly they didn't have the Lobster Roe Noodle that night). This was absolutely creamy and rich. The lobster was fresh and it all came together very very well. To end the dinner on an excellent note the restaurant came out with a small complimentary dessert for my brother with Happy 40th Birthday Peter written on the plate and small candle. It was delicious. The food, atmosphere, service, and the little things they did for my brother made the night a great experience.

Their Pumpkin Pie dessert crepes are great, and you can do any number of combinations with their ingredients (like sugar, jam, nutella, syrup) to make your own creation. Their savory crepes, like ham & cheese are wonderful too, they are always prepared fresh right in front of you with fresh ingredients, and they're huge, so it's definitely enough to fill you up. They also serve Glacier ice cream (it might be gellato), a local Boulder ice cream company, and their yummy desserts are great as well.The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is their menus can tend to be a little confusing, and hard to find. Sometimes they're in a little basket at the front, sometimes scattered across the tables, sometimes nowhere to be found.

I was in town for a convention and while wandering around, decided to try out this place based off of the yelp reviews.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this place specializes in both Vietnamese and Thai cuisine, though I'm going to go out on a limb and say that their Thai dishes may be slightly better, as their staff is from my last visit primarily Thai.  However that is only an assumption and not fact to how well a person can prepare food.  I may be wrong, and I probably am, because I did in my visit decide to sample dishes from both sides of the menu.  When I say both sides, I mean something from each country.  Their menu is huge.  If I remember correctly, I believe their menu encompasses almost all of the main staples as well as a few lesser known items from both countries.  Also, the prices are very reasonable, and by reasonable I mean cheap.  With the majority of the menu items under $10, it feels like you are stealing from or cheating them with the amount of food they give you.  The portions are huge.  I had about half of my Tom Yum fried rice, and had to take the rest home.  Yes, I said Tom Yum fried rice.  Tastes exactly as you can imagine it's name, if you've had either dish.  I feel like this restaurant does justice to the cuisine of both countries and everything is very flavorful, as well as plentiful.  However, like I've said before, they are a tad better at making Thai food, but their Vietnamese food is good as well.If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely stop by again.Summary: Extensive menu, great tasting/flavorful food, HUGE portions, great/cheap prices"},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow.

When we received our orders my croissant had NO sausage and my co workers order has sausage NO bacon.

Instead she gave me several reasons why my order was taken down correctly and why she wassnt at fault and that I could get my money or not either way they did NOT care!

I placed a large order for a graduation party for 150 ppl in June. I had the food delivered to the house and set up by the driver.  When the driver was done setting up he was standing away from where the food was, he asked me to sign the sheet and then he left. He never reviewed  the order with me, and to my mistake, I never asked to check to be sure everything was delivered.  Later during the party I discovered several of the items I ordered were not there...a tray of eggplant parm, a cold cut tray, and a pastry tray.  I discovered this towards the end of the party, so it was late at night.  I called Gennaro's on Sunday and was told to call back on Monday.  I called on Monday and spoke to the catering manager who said \\"you should have called on Saturday, there's nothing we can do now\\".  The total of the items I did not receive was $200, that is a lot of money have left out of an order.  I explained to her that I discovered the missing items late in the night and she insisted that I must have received the items, and nothing could be done.  I asked to have the owner call me.  It took the owner 3 days to finally call me back.  He also stated that it was \\"impossible\\" for me not to have received the items,  stating they triple check every order. I again explained that I did not receive the items and I would like my credit card refunded the $200 for the items I did not receive.  He said he would have to look into it and get back to me.  After waiting a week, I called him again. He insisted the driver delivered the items.  I AGAIN explained to him that I did not receive the items.  He said he would look into it further and get back to me.  I never heard from him again.  I filed a complaint with the BBB explaining the situation.  The owner responded offering me a $100 gift card stating \\"he can not refund every person who claims they did not receive their food, he has a business to run\\"  WHAT?  So how often does this happen???  So instead of doing the right thing and refunding me my money you offer me $100 to go away? Perhaps your \\"triple check\\" method does not work if others are also complaining about missing items.  I am insulted by the accusation that I just want to get money back.  Gennaro's has stolen $200 from me by failing to deliver the items I paid for.   Please be very very very careful if doing business with them. Check to be sure you receive every item you ordered and don't let the driver leave without reviewing the order.

(AND they were able to seat a group of eight people within five minutes! Impressive!)Most of it was not very inspired -- though 6/8 dishes ordered were curry dishes (none duplicates, though). They were very solid curry dishes, and came in huge portions, and were noticeably different from one another in the vegetables and sauces, which was definitely a good sign (even though they were all plated the same way).I got the Kao Soi -- which was a total standout. If you come here, get the Kao Soi. It's a spicy type of curry broth pho with pickled carrots and onions mixed in, and fried chicken and two types of noodles (one of them crunchy!). The flavors were pretty new to me, and the textures were excellent. And who can't love the idea of a curry chicken noodle soup with FRIED chicken in it?! While I'm giving the place a 3 star overall review for delivering exactly what it promises in a fine way, the Kao Soi was great, 4.5 stars, and I would come back here for it or look for it again to see how other people make it.Our waitress was very sassy -- we came in at four pm, and she was pretty distraught when none of us ordered beer, even commenting on it.

On a business trip, I walked into Casa Alvarez expecting a quick, decisive victory, and another burrito conquered.  I had defeated burritos in Portland, San Francisco, Buffalo, Boston, Raleigh, and the most capable of the lot up until now...Bombers in Albany.  They all had fallen, either by my hand or my blade.  As with other territories, I marched into Casa Alvarez, looked at the menu and demanded \\"The Inferno Burrito\\".  With that decisive action the negotiation was over, the sides chosen and the powder keg was ignited.After a brief interlude, the waiter returned with The Inferno.  On its face it appeared to be quite the adversary.  I attempted at first to attack using traditional means, but was quickly brushed back.  Soon after realizing that this was going to require innovation, I responded by using mechanical advantage.  My fork tore into the burrito and inflicted much damage, many bites were lost with machine precision.  It appeared as though I would emerge victorious in a few short moments, as I had many times before.  Soon however, the burrito responded with a chemical burn to my palate.  I had encountered this Capsaicin before, but not to this degree, and certainly never utilized with such disregard for man and the guidelines of modern combat.  Soon I had no choice but to retreat, dig in and wait.There we were, each waiting it out, dug into our respective trenches.  Every so often I would charge the burrito, but was quickly cut down.  The Western Front, locked in a battle of attrition.  Approach from the East, initially successful as shredded lettuce was consumed, but soon, war-weary, my right hand revolted and surrendered to the burrito.  The fight continued to wage from the west, although much time had passed with little progress.  Soon, although leadership commanded the fork to charge the burrito, the fork refused.  Reinforcements came and another push was made, but soon it was apparent that defeat was inevitable.  The burrito arrived warm and delightful, but after much time dug in, it became cold, calculating, cruel.  Eventually, a mere 140,136 minutes from the 11th day of the 11th month, the check was signed and the Fourteen dollars delivered.

Loads of unique and well prepared fresh vegetables. \\nNight two, no starter. We were a bit overly stuffed from the previous nights fare. I had another one of those yummy margaritas and he had a Pearl Snap. My husband ordered the Grilled Salmon entree.

We arrived around 6:15 and were quickly seated.  Daughter got the homemade lemonade and I got the sweet tea (both very good).  Then we ordered the Moo Oink Cluck which has 1/4 lb brisket, 1/4 lb pulled pork, 1/2 chicken, 4 fixins (we got mac and cheese, vinegar slaw, black eyed peas and pickles) plus 4 corners of cornbread.  Food arrived without too much wait and we inspected the six available BBQ sauces on the table in the meantime (KC, NC, Texas, Alabama, and can't recall the last two but I really liked the first three).I'm a big fan of brisket and this was easily the best I've had on the North Shore (been to Hoppy's, Blackstrap, Tennessee, Great American before closed, Smokey Bones).  Moist, great flavor, nearly no fat, nice smoke ring.  Great on its own or with the Texas bbq sauce.The pulled pork and chicken were very good as well and we filled up to the point that I had to pass on the chocolate pecan pie   Got leftovers to go and just finished off the brisket and pulled pork with my son for lunch.  Still very good - heated up well.  Got most of the chicken left over for tomorrow's lunch.  Food was great, portions generous.  If/when they add baked beans and red beans and rice, it'll be nearly perfect.

Ramen is a dime a dozen anymore, and to be honest, so is Agedashi Tofu and Chicken Karaage.  Commoditized Japanese food is a bane to West Coasters.  It is with that jaded aspect that I reluctantly say--Kukai is the best in its class.  I hate that a globalized chain is better than anything than we can produce locally, including Biwa, Yama, and Boxer. But the food is magnificent.  The ramen noodles alone are uniformly al dente and stay so throughout.  The broth is unpretentious--chickeny, porky, balanced.  The accompaniments treated themselves like dishes of their own that happened to be thrown into a bowl of noodles. Really though it's all about the Izakaya food. Thickly flavored Spinach Gomae, just-right Chicken and Shrimp Karaage, and the absolute best Gua Bao (Pork Bun) that I have ever had.  The service, though sometimes amateurish, is gracious, though this place excels so well on food that nothing else matters.  The wait for a table...not so much.

Get the black bean soup (pureed, seasoned beans drizzled with cilantro cream, topped with tiny crackers and served on top of corn relish). Get the spinach salad (with purple onion, pear, soft cheese and candied walnuts).Eat the free jalapeno cornbread and popcorn if the soup and salad don't fill you up. Both the seasoned popped corn and crumbly muffins are well worth the carbs, and the cornbread is a nice balance of sweet, dry and spicy.One person I was with had the eggplant parmesan, which I tasted and loved. So tender without being mushy!  His sweet potatoes were also good, and he said the other vegetables were, too.Another had the chicken almandine, which the two meat eaters who tried said was only so-so. It looked kind of uninspired -- aside from the soup, presentation was clearly not key at Moonshine.The kid had chicken tenders and steak fries, which he barely touched because he said they were \\"too spicy, like hot spicy.\\" Then again, he did fall asleep at the table halfway through the meal and later, he made sure he got a to-go box. The service was glacial (remember the kiddo falling asleep? I was nearly ready to do the same), especially when it came time to get the food after ordering and when we wanted the check.As others have said, the price point seems a bit high, on entrees at least. (My meal was about $8.75 for small salad and cup of soup.) The atmosphere is nice enough but coupled with the relaxed service, it falls in that odd zone just short of high-end but not quite casual.I had intended for us to go to the brunch, but it's ONLY on Sundays, not Saturdays.

Now, know this - I'm 39 and 35 of those years were spent eating hot dogs in Chicago. I consider myself an expert on Vienna beef and all the fixins. This ain't it.The dog - if it were Vienna beef - had a rubbery texture and zero flavor. It had been in the water or steamer far too long. I couldn't even finish.

The \\"extra moist\\" brisket was more like the goop that is left on the slicer tray after the meat is taken off.  It was reasonably tasty but seemed more like a way for Rudy to save potential waste than anything resembling a delicacy.  The ribs were meaty, which we considered to be a plus, but not anything special.  The sides, potato salad, beans and slaw were average at best.

When you're in this specific area of Boston, it's difficult to find a good Italian restaurant as you have another overrated one down the street. The Daily Catch is quite small, but that's their appeal as tourists love small spaces with long lines wrapping around the block. But don't be fooled unless your priority is meeting Satan's mother - one of the waitresses. First she'll tell you to step away from the door when you're 15 feet from the entrance. She then tells you in a heavy southie accent that 'aranciata' is pronounced 'Orangina.' I'm not Italian, but I'm pretty fucking sure Orangina is the name of a brand, not the pronunciation of 'orange.' Their algio e olio with ground calamari is probably their best dish, kind of like how nonna used to make it, but nonna also happens to be slightly oblivious to spices. Their homemade squid ink noodles are a little spongy for my taste, like a bloated sea serpent. The fried calamari was basic and could use a pinch of humility as their rise in popularity seems to have forced quality to take a back seat. But aside from my harsh (but honest) criticism, finding good Italian food in this area is like trying to find good Dan Dan noodles in Ohio. With all that said, try shucking some oysters as you can't go wrong with fresh seafood in the Quincy Market area.

Lived in Thailand, grew up with Thai food, parents had a Thai restaurant, cook Thai food, eat Thai food in other places I visit. Man, I was really excited to try Pok Pok. I actually have the cookbook and all of the recipes seem pretty legit-- authentic in a modernized way-- so I figured the restaurant would be great.And it was a-ok. Authentic? Yeah, definitely more than your average Thai place in the US. I loved seeing a-typical dishes on the menu, beyond pad thai and red curry. Not that I don't like those dishes, it was just good to see other regions of Thailand represented.I came with a group of three on a Friday early afternoon and there was no wait at all. Oh, I love the decor! Like a traditional Thai restaurant with a little spin. It smelled really bad though. It reminded me of canned bamboo shoots, which it very well may have been. Fish sauce chicken wings. Not Thai, but my favorite dish here. They did a good job of capturing the umami of fish sauce with hardly any of the funk. Before I ate here, I read a review about how someone's fingers smelled like fish long after. Mine did not, ha. We were asked if we wanted them spicy or not and we said spicy. They weren't.Moo sateh. The pork was kinda dry. I prefer these a little fattier and more chargrilled. Each skewer has one piece of fat at the bottom of it, which I thought was strange. The peanut sauce was good though.Neua Nam Tok. One of my favorite Thai dishes. This one was pretty good-- very limey. It also had toasted rice powder on top which is a major component of the dish that a lot of US restaurants forgo entirely. I just love when this dish is searing hot, and this one wasn't at all. Som Tam, papaya salad. Again, one of the dishes that I think is best served super hot. It's all that lime, gotta counter it with heat as well. Anyways, this one was ok, if a bit bland.I got the limeade to drink, which was not too sweet and a little fizzy-- so good. I'm disappointed, overall. I think I would've enjoyed more of the dishes had they been hotter... or hot at all. I didn't specify heat level when I ordered because I wanted to eat the food as they intended me to eat it. So, if I went back I'd definitely want it more customized to my tastes. I also wish I would've tried a main dish. Pok Pok was pretty authentic, but that didn't make it great quality Thai food."},{"name":"Corner Bakery Cafe","address":"9761 Great Hills Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Just lovely, we love having breakfast for lunch!!

I found it important to post this review due to my recent visit to C&S. I was referred to this restaurant by friends and decided to visit on my birthday for dinner. Some friends and I went one evening and arrived 1 hour before closing. Our first encounter was with the hostess who looked at us strangely when we walked in. I'm assuming because they were preparing to close. Didn't matter because it was my birthday and I was excited to try the cuisine. Once we were sat everything started off awesome. Our server was great and very attentive. The food tasted good as well. Immediately after we finished our meal the server brought out a dessert for us to share but one of my friends started to sweat and stepped outside to get some air. The rest of us stayed and finished our drinks and dessert. After several minutes we began to worry and one of our group went outside to check on her. She had vomitted all over the parking lot. She had the ribeye. Our night of birthday fun was over. Table service at the local night spot wasted. The next morning I woke up feeling ill as well. Vomiting and on the porcelain throne all morning. I had eaten some of her ribeye and that's when I concluded that we had food poisoning. Glostrinium botulinum. I immediately called and asked to speak with a manager. I spoke with Arnold. I asked him how they prepare their steak and if it was sous vide (vacuum sealed) he confirmed \\"yes\\" I explained that I am a certified chef and I understand how this preparation method could make one instantly sick. He apologized and offered to send us gift cards to refund the money we spent. We haven't received any gift cards nor have we heard from this restaurant. I followed up a week ago and left a message for Arnold with another manager but he has yet to communicate. It's not the gift card but the principle. With respect for the industry no further action was taken on our part however an honest apology and a bit of concern for our ruined night would have sufficed. Definitely will never patronize this restaurant again and I will definitely spread the word."},{"name":"Nate's","address":"306 S Main St, Ste 101","city":"Buda","stars":"3.5","text":"There are a ton of options for draft beer, but I just wasn't feeling the vibe.

Very small restaurant but I managed to get a reservation for a party of 4 on the same day for Saturday night dinner. This restaurant is literally in a house that seats a total of 16 guests inside. But I have to say, BYOB for the win!All the food was delicious. Since their menu rotates a bit, this may be only temporarily helpful, but the following is what we tried.Dive Fries (4/5) - Crispy fries covered in gravy, cheese, and red onions. The flavors worked well together. Despite the gravy topping, the fries were still crispy and flavorful with the touch of cheese. Pork belly with french toast (5/5) - This dish is a MUST HAVE. The pork belly was so tender and full of flavor, and the salty contrasted incredibly well with the sweet from the french toast. Wow, I was blown away. Apparently this dish is always on their menu, and it really would be tragic if they ever take it off.Hanger steak (5/5) - Perfectly cooked steak, and perfectly seasoned. It came with some green beans and roasted potatoes, all of which were superb but never took away from the star of the dish. So nice to have steak cooked so incredibly well.Cauliflower (4/5) - Very interesting roasted cauliflower with a splash of spicy sauce. I really did like it, but the other dishes we had were so good that this was just a bit shy in comparison.Brussel sprouts (3.5/5) - Probably my least favorite of everything. It was not your usual fried or roasted till it's crispy type of brussel sprouts, and I think it could have been better with more flavor and some zing. This would be the only dish I would not order again.Absolutely incredible experience.

Walked into the entry/bar area and waited to be acknowledged like the group in front of us had\\n been.   .......and waited, and waited....\\nFinally asked one of the three hostesses(?) that were at the stand what was the protocol for being seated.  Looked at me as if I were speaking another language.  They did take our name and tell us it would be 30-40 minutes.  O.K.  In that moment a spot opened at the bar so we decided to wait there.  Ordered drinks and met an actor and his girl friend from San Diego and had very pleasant conversation with them.   Decided to just have hor'douerves at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  As we were waiting for our order a 2\\" cock roach took up residence on my drink napkin.  Upon bringing it to the attention of one of the bartenders (woman) she got the back bar service person to come and get it.  By this time it had scampered around to the under side of the bar.  With help from several other patrons, it was located but never really contained or disposed of.  I was told that it was not the big ones you had to worry about, just the small ones.  Now at this point do I stay or just leave?  We did stay and eat the appetizer, although I was leery of it at this point.   Ordered the chicken and waffles starter.  It was excellent, can't imagine it could be any better.  But I had never had it before.\\nIn all fairness we did not get charged for the appetizer, but come on really cockroaches on the bar.

He is from a midwestern rural area, so if I take him to some foodie place here in Portland and his fairly unprimed palate is impressed, that's usually a good sign. (Nevermind that Domino's might accomplish a similar reaction. Still, though.)I didn't get a chance to try the wings or boar collar this time around, but next time I will for sure. I must admit that I kind of regret not getting my hands (er, mouth) on one of these dishes.Some other reviewers mentioned a 45-minute wait. This is about what we had, also. We headed over to their affiliated Whiskey Soda lounge while we waited, which was a-ok with me. (Separate review later)When we got to our table (a little cramped, but fine unless you have a big personal bubble) I ordered the pork belly dish, which was sort of like a really rich stew. My dad ordered the sausage dish that came with cabbage and thai pork rinds and this sort of fibrous spicy paste. We split a bowl of coconut rice between us.It was pretty loud inside, and we did have a hard time hearing each other at times.I can see how many people may want to order three dishes between two people, as we really did not get masses of food. That said, it was still a good amount, and we were both satisfied without being stuffed. I really enjoyed the pork belly stew. It was served in a sauce that is hard for me to characterize. It was essentially a salty dark sauce with all the typical qualities and flavors of thai, but sort of mixed into one, and was a bit sweeter. It was a great flavor with the chunks of pork. I have to admit I hoped for a little more out of the sausage dish. The sausage itself was an interesting flavor - the herb element stood out a lot. But I didn't care for the grainy sort of texture. Also, the spicy sauce it was served with was a little bit much for me. I think the flavor undertones were nice - very earthy and warm - but the spice overtook it a bit. And I do like spicy foods in general. However, the combination of flavors and textures was interesting and pleasant. Even Dad thought so! My dad's personality brought a unique challenge to the servers. He's a little quirky and odd, and tends to say and do whatever comes to mind. I think the servers managed it alright. They *did* everything they should have (brought him some more tea when he spilled it, for example) but I did feel like they could have been warmer. I sensed that our server was sort of put off by him, and I guess I don't think I should have sensed that. (My dad wasn't rude, by the way. Just different.) I'll come back for some of the dishes that have been recommended by other Yelpers. It was an interesting experience, and the food was decent, but not as good as I was hoping. : ( I'd still go again, though!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Food and drinks were great.

I guess the word is out that Austin is really getting into their fancy cocktails.  This Weather Up is the chain's 3rd location after Tribeca and Brooklyn.If you want a snazzy cocktail atmosphere like Midnight Cowboy (which was converted not from an old seafood sandwich place like this one but rather from a brothel) then you may be disappointed.  Weather Up is nice on the inside but the inside is very small with limited seating.  Which now that I think about it is just like Midnight Cowboy.  The draw at Weather Up will really be the expansive back outdoor patio area with the twinkling string lights.  In other words if it is freezing outside and you want to come here just hope you can squeeze in somewhere inside in the limited indoor space.If you enjoy cocktail recipes pulled from the 1890's then you are in luck as many of their recipes come from this era.  If you enjoy scotch like I do then you are also in luck as they have some nice scotch choices on their menu.  Weather Up uses hard metal straws (with cute fan shaped spoons at the bottom) so if you have a straw biting habit you may chip a tooth.  The ice is make in some sort of a contraption that distributes one elongated piece of ice so you have less melting water, preserving your beverage.  Plus it looks neat.If cocktails aren't your thing you may not be that impressed with this place.  They do have beer and wine but that isn't their point.  The bartenders were nice enough though definitely not Texan level of friendly.  Of course Austin is losing so many native Texans that many probably won't notice this."},{"name":"Summer Moon Coffee - Buda","address":"316 N Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"When a coffee shop has cortados you know they're legit.

We went to Morton's as I had been given a gift card for my birthday and it is my goal to try each upper end steakhouse in town at least once - so why not?  We had a part of 10 and all of us order various items from the menu - chicken and various steak orders with some crab legs as well as a chop salad.  We sampled each other dishes (all of us were family - no big deal) and one thing I noticed is that pretty much everyone's food was not as hot as it should have bee coming out of the kitchen.  I was disappointed and thought perhaps this was due to the lengthy wait for the food as perhaps the chef was unable to manage cooking the various items at different temperatures and lengths of time for such a large group.The food tasted good, you just should not be eating a steak that is barely warm.For desert, I ordered the Grand Marnier Souffle - MY LORD that was easily the best part of my meal and perhaps someday I will go back just for that however for the time being another visit to Morton's is not in my future."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Best drinks in back bay, bar none.

My partner and I have been to the Maru by Shigezo on SE Division multiple times and the experience has always been wonderful.  I am shocked at the difference between two restaurants that are the same.We arrived two hours prior to our movie, giving us plenty of time to eat and walk back to the theater prior to the 9 PM showing.  Wrong!  We were seated immediately outside and proceeded to wait almost 20 minutes just to get water.When the waitress finally did come over to take out order, she blamed it on others that she was slack in getting to us (never a good sign to blame others when you are not doing your job).  We ordered ramen and were told it would be a long wait for ramen because the kitchen was backed up.  I asked for a few minutes to decide on something else but she assured me she \\"would never make us wait an hour and a half for ramen.\\"  So I ordered the ramen.  LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE!My partner ordered a special which came with a beer, appetizer and a bowl of ramen.  His beer came right away.  His cold appetizer (california roll) wasn't delivered until after he received his ramen and we reminded the staff that we had ordered it.  HIs ramen was brought to the table 10 minutes prior to mine.  Throughout our stay we had 5 different people tending to us - no one knew what the other was doing and there was zero communication.  In the end, the service was some of the worst I've experienced in a long time.  We had to rush to get to our movie on time because we did indeed wait 1.5 hours for our ramen.I would not recommend this particular restaurant to anyone if you care even a lick about service.  The ramen is delicious but you can get that with fantastic service (consistently) at their location on SE Division."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is pretty big. The service is ok. It's good that they have oysters from 15 different locations. I tried island creek($2.5), peter's point($3), and wellfleet($3.5) as they are the most popular. I like island creek the best. It's meaty and sweet. Petter' point is less sweet but more meaty. Wellfleet is the least sweet. I also tried the crispy oyster slider, I like the seasoning but I think the fried oyster does not have rich oyster flavor. I also tried the lobster bisque and i am kind of disappointed. It's true that they give big chunks of lobster meat. But it's a bit oily and bland. I really cannot taste the lobster flavor in the soup. It just tastes like a few lobster chunks are in a tomato soup. I think it's the worst I've had in Boston. They put a lot of lobster meat in the lobster roll. But the seasoning is not the best. By the way, this lobster roll is cold lobster roll. The cider they have is interesting as it tastes like white wine. In general I think it's an ok place. I may come here for their oyster if it's not available anywhere else."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorites places to satisfy my Italian cravings.

They give you a dirty rice flavored water and when we asked for regular water the waiter acted as if he were offended. (Note to management that flavored water should be an optional not the norm.)Now back to the wordy menu apparently there were two versions of my dinner me and my girlfriend were wanting one of their signature dishes and that's what we thought we ordered but when it arrived we apparently got the \\"shared portions\\" of the plate.

While the food was generally fine, we were not exactly impressed with the execution. The roasted garlic did not have enough flavor, the rainbow trout, usually light and delicate, was overpowered by the sage butter sauce and made too heavy by the cornbread topping, and the catfish could have used more heat. The side of grits were the tastiest component on the table and were some of the best grits I've ever had.

The quality of the food has gone down hill! The tiny omelet and greasy english muffin (no home fries or fruit if you get toast?) was straight up terrible....I'm feeling pretty sick from my $15. breakfast (without 3 dollar tip, really $18.). And you'd think that the waitstaff would ask if you wanted your english muffin toasted with butter rather than grilled (greasy and 50 cents more than toast).....the whole experience was rather disappointing. Good thing I had good company with a friend from work, during this experience or it would have been a complete waste. This will probably be my last visit to Cafe Luna given the high price for a tiny omelet and greasy english muffin.....uggg. At this point I\\"m hoping to throw up so I can get that heavy greasy feeling out of my stomach.......should have gotten the fruit as my choice (must choose, either home fries, fruit of toast?) instead of the nasty, greasy english muffin. Next time I'll go elsewhere, plenty of options in Cambridge (Asgard, Brookline lunch or drive to S & S)....too bad though, this place used to be so good."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best Vietnamese food in Back Bay!

I knew I wasn't going to buy them all so I chose to take pictures of some of the titles. They offer items that vary in cost; the prices for new or used books could be as low as $5 or go up to $25 (as I saw, prices can be higher/lower).This being said, if I ever find myself in Portland again, Powell's Bookstore is definitely one of my first destinations to visit."},{"name":"En Fuego Cocina Mexicana","address":"131 Rantoul St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3","text":"At this moment I am eating the best Chickens Tortilla soup I have ever eaten!

This is quite literally not a review just a tip. For instance I asked my waitress to take the remainder of the kale guac I always order to clear the table and she says \\"do you want me to box it up\\"? I said no there is not enough guac left for the amount of cilantro on there in a joking manner (mind you there was a GianT sprig if cilantro on top of the presentation) she says no that's not cilantro that's kale inside ..(((lmfao WOW.)))) I followed with NO NoT the KALE the giant sprig of CilantrO on top as I pointed at it. She seemed to still not understand like if I had said something in a different language which led to her assuming I was less than haha . \\n   The rest of the meal was as if I was a burden to serve to the point where I started to feel as if I was going to be treated this way I would return the favors with being truthful and not lost in the glamour of a glorified chain restaurant. My food usually comes out in excellent quality but this time for whatever reason they did not even season the protein on my entree it literally tasted like it was just tossed in oil and heated no salt no flavor zero none nada!!! When I had the \\"audacity\\" to mention this to my waitress who was already treating me as if I was there to please her and not the opposite things went to passive aggressive town real quick and never took a turn to chill the fuck out and do your job street. Soooo I see her doing the LOok over her shoulder like when your telling on someone for something wrong. She noticed that I was staring rite at her and the manager as she gives her sob story about how picky I am to him. They both look over like they are just so bothered by me mentioning the food being under seasoned lol. As he came over he said \\"so you didn't like your food \\" okay buddy we get it you think your top dog its all MY FUALT lol . I said no it's not that I didn't like it, it's the fact that no one seasoned my food at all and I'm paying good money. I said I cook and don't want to go somewhere pay for food that's supposedly amazing and get under seasoned soggy food that's all. At first he looked like he was going to be cool at that point and just do his lil old job but noooo. When they brought out the new entree he came over to the table and before I took a bite said \\" So is it to your liking now\\"? Ok so maybe he is just being nice cause he is \\"genuinely\\" concerned lol. I followed with wow thanks I don't know yet and before I cold take a bit he says \\"So where do YOU work\\"? Ahh the good ol let me try to shame you cause I think I'm the shit cause i manage front of the house at a true Foods while you eat routine.....very comforting for me and the fam!!!! I said as a matter of fact I worked at North (and if anyone knows True foods and North are both from Fox concepts) but back to the story. Then I followed it up with not anymore I run a private catering company and my wife is a line cook at Alamo at lake line why do you ask ? He gets this giant smirk as if his elite true Foods status has just shown us what was up!! and said no reason.  (LMFAO!!! ) so why ask ? As things got more uncomfortable for the manager or door boy or whatever he is considered I then asked for a box without taking one bite of my food !  As I did he asked several more times knowing I hadn't tried the new food he brought out ,\\"if it was now to my standards\\" and\\" liking\\" making it seem as if was picky and to be looked down on . Amazing how people get these positions now a days a banana republic outfit a couple creepy tattoos handle bar mustache and black frame glasses make great managers and chefs apparently!! only people that look like this know anything about food!  All others apparently are not worth serving with respect and gratitude for being a customer willing to give money to people who deserve it . I still gave a $50tip on our 55$ restaurant bill to the waitress to inspire her not to overlook the small tables but treat them with just as much enthusiasm and interest as a table of 10 . Attitude matters and if you assume you can treat smaller ticket tables like crap cause you aren't making that much money on them than you don't deserve to be in the service industry.!!!!!!!!! Much love to all the people who aren't like these two!!!! those that work here even the cook who made the food is amazing . They are the ones who really bust there ass to make a difference.

So after hearing about a diner with vegan options I dragged my carnivorous boyfriend to the Allston Diner. \\nWhen we arrived on Sunday morning we faced a 15 minute wait, which was expected. We went for a walk, when we returned a waitress seated us at the comic book table (my nerdy boyfriend approved). Looked over the menu and was instantly drawn to \\"The Ultimate Vegan Breakfast\\" and orange juice. To my disappointment the waitress announced they had run out of tofu (which seems to be mentioned in a few reviews before mine, you would think that they would order more tofu for weekends if that was the case) and a few other items. She asked me if I wanted to substitute something else for the tofu scramble, and I decided on the vegan flapjacks with berries. My boyfriend got chicken and waffles. While we waited they brought our drinks, while we chatted. It took a while for our food to come out, about 45 minutes, but it all looked delicious. When I picked up the vegan butter to add to my flapjacks, I noticed a hair on my butter- YUCK. So I let the waitress know, she brought me some fresh butter. After I started eating I remembered that in \\"TUVB\\" home fries were included in the meal. So I asked the waitress if they were going to come out soon. She kindly told me that she charged me for the pancakes with too sides. Wth? That isn't what I ordered, so I brought up the fact that I ordered the \\"TUVB\\" and she said it was cheaper that way (but  that's not what I ordered). She put the order in and they came 20 minutes later *face palm*  The food was very delicious, but I don't think I will get the \\"home fries they were more like chips, not a fan. Although she was very good about filling my bf's coffe, she never came around to fill the water, or ask if I wanted to have more orange juice. At that point I was kind of exhausted bringing up all of the things that I had already discussed with her, I just didn't mention it. When the bill came is was 36$!!!!???? Which is ridiculous for a brunch. My Ultimate vegan breakfast mean was 10.99$ and my boyfriends meal was 10$ plus a coffee and a small OJ. Should have been 25$ and some change. So then I had to wait for the waitress to come back, an explain the whole thing to her. She was nice enough, and not mad or anything, but come on-we went over this. By the time we left I was mentally exhausted. When I go out for Brunch I just want it to be a relaxing experience, not have to pester the waitress every 10 minutes because she can't do her job.  \\nAll in all I gave them two stars for the exhaustion. But the food was really delicious.

But since I'm usually super busy and eat on the run, it's been hard to stick to my restrictive diet. However, Life Alive is helping to change that. At first, I was a bit hesitant to try Life Alive because the menu is a bit overwhelming, especially if you're not used to eating healthy food (quinoa? sunflower sprouts? nutritional yeast?). However, I finally sucked it up and I'm so glad I did- I've now gotten take out from Life Alive 3 times in the past few weeks (with many more to come!).The restaurant is a bit on the warm side (it's usually so warm inside that the windows steam up), so I have been choosing to keep my food to go instead of eating inside. I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for my food, but I usually go during off-peak hours. The service is always super friendly. The first time I went, I tried the Goddess (smoked tofu, short grain brown rice, steamed carrots, beets, broccoli, dark greens, Ginger Nama Shoyu dressing) and the Elvis Alive (peanut butter, cocoa, banana, coconut ice cream, and rice milk). As other people have said, the demi size was more than enough for me. The smell and the taste of the Goddess was amazing, but I found myself missing a crunch taste while eating it, so next time I will probably add in something a bit crunchy. I loved the Elvis Alive, but it was definitely a calorie splurge- but great if you ever want a dairy-free/vegan milkshake that still somewhat resembles \\"healthy\\" food. The second time I went, I got the Love Alive (blueberry, strawberry, banana, dates, almond milk) and the Kiddie Quesadilla (whole wheat tortilla with cheese, which you can substitute for Daiya cheese). I loved both- the smoothie quickly has become one of my favorites. I also loved the quesadilla, and it wasn't too small.The third time I went, I got the Love Alive again and the Adventurer (tamari roasted almonds, smoked tofu, melted cheddar cheese, broccoli crowns, chopped beets, dark greens, short grain brown rice, quinoa), substituting in Daiya cheese. The Adventurer blew me away- it definitely had the crunchy taste I had missed in the Goddess. And while it didn't smell as exciting, it tasted amazing. I got the half size and the smoothie for dinner, and I ate every last bite and it was just the right amount of food. I can't wait to try the rest of their dishes and smoothies. They also sell yummy Liz Lovely vegan/gluten-free cookies.

Alexandra was at the bar waiting for me when I arrived and was drinking a Jane Bond -- a martini made with Stoli Strasberi, muddled strawberry, Grand Marnier, guava and lime juices.  It was pretty tasty if I do say so myself.We were originally had reservations for 6:00 p.m. but were running late.  The restaurant was able to accommodate our request to push our reservations back until 6:30 p.m.  I was surprised they were able to when we arrived because the joint was jumpin'!  It seemed as if every table and booth was full and a Bank of America happy hour was taking place in the bar area.  Yet, the host seated us almost immediately after I arrived.  It is refreshing to not be made to wait 15 minutes past your \\"reservation time\\" at a packed restaurant -- as happens all too often in Atlanta.Alexandra and I decided to share an appetizer of smoked chicken spring rolls with collard greens and tasso ham.  There were two spring rolls in the order, each cut in half on the bias and were served over a vegetable slaw.  Very tasty!  I thought the portion size was just right for an appetizer.  Speaking of portion size, be forewarned that Sweet Lowdown makes full and half portions of most of it's entrees available and that the full portions are HUGE.  Alexandra ordered the country fried tournedoes of beef with whipped potatoes and peppercorn milk gravy and I ordered the fried chicken with collard greens and baked mac and cheese.  The menu indicated to \\"allow 20 minutes\\" for the fried chicken and I was surprised to find that both of our dishes were brought quickly to our table, in less than 20 minutes. As I said, our full-size entrees were enormous...and very delicious.  The fried chicken consisted of a very juicy breast, a wing and a drumstick served alongside very tender and flavorful collard greens and some of the best mac and cheese I've had in Atlanta.  On the other hand, Alexandra's \\"country fried steak\\" was a little bit on the overbreaded and overseasoned side.  The breading was a little bit soggy because of it's thickness and tended to slide right off the meat although the meat was cooked perfectly to her \\"medium\\" specification.  A heavy hand was taken with the black pepper when preparing her milk gravy as well.  All-in-all, we had very attentive service and very good food for a restaurant that I had heard both good and bad things about.  My only other complaint is that the restaurant is unbelieveably expensive.  We paid $92 for a large Sweetwater 420, a glass of wine, a split appetizer and two full-portion entrees with tip.  Finally, I believe that they are undergoing a change in management and/or ownership and that the bugs will eventually get worked out.

As for the pizza, and all I could taste was the saltiness of the toppings, and the onions on it were pretty miserable looking. They do accept orders on the phone for pickup so if time is a factor, you might want to consider that. I must commend them for the friendliness of the server and the price of the food.

He frequently travels to Thailand to try different things and add things to his restaurant. He won the James Beard Award for \\"Best Chef, Northwest\\" in 2011. I've had great Thai food before, but this was one of my destinations since it is critically acclaimed. I wanted to to see if it was THAT good, since it's a white guy cooking Thai food after all. For a Friday at lunchtime circa 1:30pm, we waited around 10 mins. Not bad, considering the line here can be as bad as 1.5 hours (I asked the hostess on the phone). We ordered: 1) Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - chicken wings that had incredibly flavor from the fish sauce. Oh man, they were pretty spicy though. Out of 1 to 10 scale, 10 being spiciest, I would say they were around a 7. It took a while eating them because 1, they're a lot of work, and 2, they were just spicy and you can only consume so much spiciness! These were incredible though. I would recommend this to anyone coming here. You can't get wings like this anywhere else, that's for sure!2) Kung Op Wun Sen, a claypot with shrimps, pork belly and bean thread noodles. I saw pics on Yelp before ordering, and it looked amazing. However they didn't taste how I imagined, they were different, but in a great way. The noodles were chewy, and had that salty soy sauce flavor. It tasted very homey, easy to make but also hit the spot. This would be awesome for drunchies.3) Muu Paa Kham Waan - Boar collar meat with chilled mustard greens. This was interesting...the meat was very flavorful from the soy and sugar, having that tangy sour flavor. This dish was also very spicy from the spicy chili lime and garlic O__O so, the waitress said once you eat the boar collar, you \\"chase\\" it with the chilled mustard greens (literally comes underneath ice chunks) and that'll help you tolerate the spices. I ordered a Hunny cocktail (fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with lime, with honey drinking vinegar and tequila). I would pass on that. Didn't taste the alcohol although it was tasty.Food overall was great. I would compare it to Le Ros Thai in San Francisco if you've ever been. The Thai food here is not your Pad Thai/Pad See Yew, but rather more exotic than your typical Thai restaurant. These are special dishes you probably can't get anywhere else unless you go to Thailand. However, that being said, if I were in Portland again, I'd probably venture off to another restaurant. Been here, done that.

It actually looks pretty bomb in my picture shown, like it should be 5 stars, though I thought Mama's Chow Food Truck was better than Pok Pok, and San Tung's is still better.  I got Pok Pok's chicken wings spicy, and it was pretty spicy the more you ate.  But what makes Mama Chow's and San Tung's better is a hint of more sweetness to it that balances the flavor.

Yes\\nEating dessert before dinner? Do it, especially if you're stuck in line and Mike's Pastry is just across the street.I will say that The Daily Catch is definitely a place to stop by if you're in the mood for seafood/Italian style. From the delicious freshly cooked pasta to the homey feel of the place, it was a very enjoyable experience. My friends and I came around 5pm on a Saturday for dinner. We ended up waiting around an hour or more and in the process, we all ran across the street for some pastries at Mike's Pastry. That did stave off our hunger until the big dinner time. The Daily Catch is a very small place, with a super limited staff of like 3-4 people. It's pretty awesome that you can see the chef make your food since the kitchen is right there near the tables. We ordered a shrimp linguini, squid ink pasta, and calamari. My goodness, it was food coma time. The squid ink pasta (basically it was pasta made from squid ink) was flavorful, chewy and very different from your usual Italian/seafood dish. The linguini was a buttery and creamy delight to the taste buds. It wasn't too heavy and seasoned just the right way. As for the calamari, this was an excellent appetizer where you can taste more of the calamari vs the fried coating. Another neat thing about this place is that as food gets served right off the pans as they're finished. Pretty nifty to not have to wait for the food to be served onto the plates and such. I would recommend this place to anyone who stops by Little Italy area of Boston, but do take heed that this place doesn't take reservations.

We were a party of four and seated immediately. That was the extent of the fast service at Slappy Cakes. We ordered 4 bottles of pancake batter and were told that they were considered appetizers and that they would be served prior to anything else that we ordered. We were okay with that concept initially, until we realized that we were waiting a really long time for uncooked pancake batter to be delivered to our table. Prior to the delivery of batter, our server came and generously oiled our griddle and then gave us a quick briefing on cooking the pancakes. Our pancakes stuck to the grill despite the oil. Turning up the heat to the highest setting helped a bit, but not much. It took a long time for the pancakes to cook.....way longer than on my stove at home. The end result tasted fine, but really weren't anything special. We also ordered two sides of bacon, which consisted of two slices of bacon per order. The bacon was too well done and much saltier than I prefer for my salty meat fix. I could barely finish my one slice portion. The table also shared a plate of Huevos Rancheros, which was pinto beans and eggs served over fried corn tortillas with sour cream, salsa and avocados. The four of us couldn't finish the one plate. It just wasn't that good. The eggs were sunny side up, but supposed to be over medium and the avocado was unripe. Overall, it was a fun experience. It is a great, bright  space with large cartoon art of pancake making progression covering the walls. Slappy Cakes is still new and judging by the long line in the rain outside as we were leaving, there are alot of fans.

My partner had the feticini with meat sauce (I was kind of laughing on this one but I sill love him;) )The calamari was perfectly cooked and the taziki was rich with no hunt of mayo (a review that I should have written about a Greek place cutting corners). It was perfectly seasoned and at the table within 5 minutes, not giving it the opportunity to become squid rubber.My main course was a little slow but well worth the wait. As many have been exposed to bad souvlakia in this city I mine was perfectly done and moist and juicy. As for the pasta... Lets say just eat Greek food at this Greek restaurant.

After switching to the smaller containers I have been there maybe a dozen times. I truly feel that the protein content is less, I even tried asking for extra chicken at the extra cost. That ended up being a bad choice as the extra was not noticeable at all. Since they switched to the smaller containers the salads really come up short. I asked for extra salad, in turn I get less salad with lots of extra space left over for potential lettuce. No, it did not get compressed in the walk back to the office. It really was the smallest salad I ever ate, like an appetizer. I'm so disappointed in the direction that Freshii has taken. Their salads are overpriced and expensive even before, now with the smaller containers they are simply a rip off. Expect to leave hungry, even if you have a small appetite. If they revert back to the original salad containers and offer a fair portion of protein I will be back.Edit: Manager has made a huge effort to rectify the problem. Give them a chance since its head office that made the container size decision, they are packing the containers to make up for it.Update Jan, 2016: arriving before the lunch hour rush will not get you in and out quicker. Expect 15-20minute wait evening if you're the first one in the store. They are all running around confused and disorganized.

The oatmeal is fantastic!  Made with milk, and creamy it's my go to for breakfast.  It does have sugar already mixed in which for me is perfect. The sandwiches are ok...Subway's next door will definitely  give you more between the bread then one at Messon, but they don't offer the Criollo(similar to Cuban) or Media Noche(midnight) bread. All sandwiches are automatically served on Criollo bread unless you ask for Media Noche, which I prefer because it's sweet like Hawaiian bread but nicely pressed like a panini but without the lines. All breakfast sandwiches have mayo and margarine.  I personally don't like mayo on my eggs so I order without both. The fries are great as well as the surullos (fried corn sticks) served with a Puerto Rican staple mayo ketchup sauce.  A mixture of garlic, mayo & ketchup.  My reason for the 4 stars is the speed of service.  It doesn't matter what time of day, there is always a long wait, not so much because of a lot of customers, but due to a zero sense of urgency to serve.  There is often a lot of staff present including Managers and one register open with a line almost to the door and yet constant personal conversation is taking place within the team present including the Managers without any concern of helping those that are waiting.   That being said unless you have extra time to wait to have your order taken and get your food this may not be the place for you.

It's a pretty cozy/soothing place, with toned-down lighting, deep red carpeting, and well spaced-out tables.  You almost feel like you're in someone's house, and you can really just relax.  It wasn't too crowded, but there were a good number of people.  We got a table upstairs almost right away, and our waitress was really nice.Looking at the menu, it seemed really expensive for just a dessert (I'm cheap and would normally think spending 10-11 dollars on a dessert is a little too extravagant).  However, not only is everything plated to be like artwork, it was really, really good too.  My chocolate molten was super rich (the melted chocolate inside was better than the cake part which was a little dry) and was paired with an amazing coffee gelato which was perfectly creamy. Overall, I'd say Finale is definitely worth it for the occasional sweet tooth splurge or special occasion.  Or if people are visiting from out of town and you want somewhere nice to take them.  It would make a great after dinner stop for a date night, too.  I probably wouldn't make a trip out here if I didn't live nearby, but it's a great neighborhood spot that's worth visiting.

It's like climaxing at the same time as your partner- utter satisfaction- meeting a human need, a human hunger. Grrr baby. Grrr. Every week I enjoy a night at or with Pok Pok in my home (it's also delicious as take-out). See the thing is, is that some people go to Pok Pok expecting some miraculous white light experience that exceeds the boundaries of culinary Thai deliciousness and they get disappointed- thus where the bad reviews pop up on Yelp saying \\"overrated.\\" Pok Pok is not one of those restaurants that can be enjoyed by thinking about how many Yelp stars you're going to give it later that night. It's just one of those restaurants that is meant to be enjoyed. My first time at Pok Pok went like so: \\"I don't care what you bring me (to the waiter), just give me something to believe in..\\" And oh boy, did he. I'd love to write about each menu item and critique them until my fingers bleed, but I won't. I'm lazy and I don't feel like writing about the OK. dishes at Pok. So about the shrimp chips (2)- they're light, delicious and full of flavor. Followed with the spicy and meaty Muu Paa Kham Waan (boars collar 12) and accompanied with their famous Vietnamese fish sauce wings (12). I normally take a break and chew on some chilled fresh collard greens at this point before ordering my favorite item on the menu. The Kaeng Hung Leh (12) is pork belly and pork shoulder in a Burmese curry with ginger, palm sugar, turmeric and pickled garlic. I eat this with sticky rice. It comes out in a sizzling hot pot. It is what makes me come back to Pok Pok every week. It's spicy, meaty, rich, creamy, salty, sweet, fresh and most of all savory. It's like icy hot to a sore muscle- it just burns so good! One other mentionable is the Cha Ca La Vong (14) which is catfish marinated in turmeric and sour sticky rice, fried in turmeric oil with scallions and dill over rice vermicelli with peanuts, mint, cilantro and mam nem. It's one of those hearty fresh dishes. Don't eat if you you're not a huge fan of dill though. The atmosphere at Pok Pok is normally people who are regulars or people who are trying it for the first time. Does that make sense? Does that register? People come back to this place because it's awesome and the people that don't are sitting at Red Onion or Typhoon on 23rd paying $23 for a plate of mediocre crab pad thai complaining about how much snow they get up on the hill. Yea, it's like that. Try this place. Love this place. If you don't, keep enjoying your Annie Chuns."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I heard this place is known for their chix wings so I HAD to come here.

We had the frenchtoast, which were mapley and BACONY and delicious - a HUGE hit; red velvet, they were just chocolatey enough, red velvet is so hard to get right and they did it; strawberry, they tasted like real strawberry and not artificial boxed crap; and peanut butter cup, they  were SO friggin good, perfect chocolate to peanut butter ratio.  I like that the cake parts of the cupcakes are actually flavored too, not just a chocolate or white cake topped with a flavored frosting, and they're not those scaled down, half size, 'we're in a recession'  cupcakes everyone tries to pass off as gourmet. These are the same size yo' mamma used to make.We used the 6 inch peanutbutter and jelly cake as our wedding cake so we'd have something to cut, it tasted JUST LIKE a pb&j sandwich. Because we only had one slice out of it, we saved it, wrapped the heck out of it, and froze it to eat on our first anniversary which was 2 days ago. Happy to say it STILL tasted pretty damn good! Even the strawberries in the strawberry jam were good! Maureen was so easy to work with and customized our cupcakes to order. Our guests are still talking about our cupcakes, and I still think they're some of the best i've had. In fact, I was inspired to write this because I'm eating a White's Bakery cupcake as I type (they were a gift) and it's NOTHING compared to Cupcake Mojo, ANNND, we just moved back here from DC and Cupcake Mojo is DEFINITELY better than Georgetown Cupcake, despite what you see on TV.

I love how the restaurant is build inside of a home, and there are a variety of seatings from outdoor patio (literally sitting in the backyard of the house) to inside of the home. I came here with my friend and we waited appx 1 hour for a table for 2. Its located inside of a residual area so you don't get much option to \\"explore\\" around the neighborhood. However, I did accidentally walked inside of an adult toy store thinking it was a pet's store (don't even ask!) which is located directly across the street. So for those with children... it is NOT a pet store. The chicken wings are absolutely amazing! the spicy, tangy and sweet flavor will explode in your mouth and will not leave you disappointed. My friend is vegetarian, and sometimes my stomach only let me eat like a rabbit, so I didn't get to try other dishes. As for drinks, I got the tamarind mojito (?) and it was different.

The FIVE: This is sensational! I was impressed by the fact that the sausage gravy wasn't too salty (the problem I find with most chicken & biscuits). It didn't overpower the delicious taste of fried chicken combined with bacon and cheddar cheese. All the flavors came together nicely.The Farmer: This is good for someone who likes a meal with a slightly sweet taste. It wasn't way to sweet or mild, it was perfect. The BAM! Yo Yo: This twist on chicken & waffles is glorious! It came with their home made honey butter and maple syrup that is absolutely addictive. Bluegrass Grits Cut with Cream Cheese: The grits were smooth and the combination of the smoked bacon, cheese, and eggs gives you a nice hearty dish. There's a splash of hot sauce that presents a nice lilttle kick sending you a flavor blast. To top it off, there's a sunny side up egg!

The ambiance was great and I know a lot of other reviews are saying negative things about the service and utensils, etc. but we had fantastic service and were checked on several times throughout our meal. Also I'm not sure exactly what people expect from a smaller Mexican food place as far as the quality of forks or the temperature of the plates but when you are paying $1.79 for a real authentic tacos, you can give them a break on the quality of the flatware. Don't mind the negative reviews if you know about Mexican food, definitely try this place. It's worth a try! I will definitely come back again!"},{"name":"Ristorante Roma","address":"1216 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We attempted to get a table on New Year's Eve, but no luck, the place was packed.  New Year's Day turned out to be quieter.  Walter, the owner, was friendly and took good care of us. The food was wonderful, starting with a house salad made with fresh fennel and a tasty vinaigrette. We shared the crab ravioli and the filet with arugula.  Both were good bets, and the cognac-laced lobster creme sauce was delicious.   We shared a nice bottle of boroli and followed the meal with a tartufo.  Walter advised us to have the tiramisu instead, as tatfuo is for kids,  but since tartufo (chocolate gelato and zabaglione, rolled in cocoa), WAS a childhood favorite, we stuck with the tartufo.  The entire dinner was prepared with care, and was yummy.    Walter also treated us to small glasses of chilled port after dinner.  We were stuffed, and satisfied-- and all for eighty bucks for the two of us."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my go to restaurant to take people from out of town.

Which is insane considering most of the sandwiches are on rolls, or loaf bread.  If it came with a drink and chips for $14 would be expensive, but maybe I could see it.  I was there yesterday, I ordered a pastrami diablo (first time w this sandwich) it was good, but not as good as their other, and it cost me $13.90!

Amazingly high wooden ceilings overhead, pretty Spanish hanging lights, and classic mahogany EVERYWHERE adorn this Church St staple that has a become a favorite over my last year in Orlando. The first time I ate here, I really liked it, but had no idea how often i would be back! It's really the perfect spot to take visiting friends or family or to just grab a small bite before a night out. A sure staple is the Patata Bravas, which I describe as a potato version of bang bang shrimp. Similar spicy, cream sauce adorning warm and crispy potato chunks. My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE thing here is the escargot though. I can't remember the exact menu name, but it is served in a sherry tomato sauce with spinach inside miniature puff pastries. Holy amazing. The sauce itself is worth coming back for, and I always request extra bread for dipping. I tried this dish once on a whim and will never go back without ordering one or two for the table. Ceviche also has a tasty drink list with their super popular red and white sangrias and numerous margarita variations. They have a full bar, so you can get your vodka sodas as well, but I usually try to be adventurous and try one of their in-house concoctions. Also, side note: I hate flan. It's like tasteless bland gelatin that just makes me want to gag. Not the case with Ceviche's flan! A friend insisted that we order it with espressos for dessert, and I was super impressed! It was flavorful with a great texture, more like a Creme Brulee than the fatty blob of nothing I always remembered trying. So kudos to Ceviche for changing my outlook there. Ceviche may not have been a total five stars the first time I ate here, but their fun atmosphere and consistently awesome eats have definitely landed them a permanent top spot for me. Also, they have live Spanish dancers on the weekends. Super fun! :)"},{"name":"The Warren City Club","address":"818 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I saw a post below about the manager, Brandon.

As I entered, I noticed the upscale interior and was pretty impressed. This should have alerted me. The Vietnamese restaurants that I have been to never leave me astounded by their interior design but rather, by their culinary prowess.We were given menu upon being seated at this cute table by the window. Looking around, my co-worker and I noticed that the place was full. Of women. There was only one male patron there. We started speculating about why that was and I just assumed that Sandy Spring stay-at-home moms like to hang out at this particular joint. Whatever.After I halted my observations to turn my attention to the menu, I almost wished that I kept conjuring theories about this place being an estrogen magnet. The prices... Whoa. Am I in a Vietnamese restaurant? What the pho? I quickly seek out the lunch section, where the prices are still ridiculously high for what was being served. Okay, I confess that some of the interpretations of classic dishes seemed very creative. This may be exciting for people who are into fusion cuisine (which I can be) but when I think of the cuisine of my childhood and my life in general, I just do not in my wildest dreams consider paying more than $10 per dish.I ended up with the beef dish served with pandan rice. My lunchmate got chicken banh mi with salmon salad. I admit that my dish was good, though the serving was not commensurate with its price tag. The rice was quite good and the flavor was expected and unexpected at the same time for me. I know pandan when I taste it (my mom literally adds pandan leaves to almost any Vietnamese that she makes) but the combination of that flavor with fish sauce was not anything that I had experienced before. The beef was flavorful, if just a bit small in portion.My co-worker seemed to enjoy her sandwich, though I just felt offended at their charging about 3x more for it than any other Vietnamese banh mi place.If you like to try different cuisines but feel uncomfortable trekking into the very neighborhoods where their corresponding people live and work, well, I guess you can come to Com Dunwoody Grill.

Also on a budget, my friend ordered the onion soup, which was very good. The best part about a bistro is often the desserts and there was an inviting selection here.

I have to say, Taipei 101's food is pretty impressive, especially when Taiwanese restaurants are so hard to find.  It's a very small mom & pop shop, so the only downside is that they have very limited seating.  Also, for those who don't live in the area, but only visiting Orlando, they are a bit out of the way.

Their bulgogi & daeji bulgogi are more expensive compared to other places, too ($18.95!).We had about 20 people last Friday, and majority of the party was eating Korean food for the first time. It's interesting that almost the entire right side of the restaurant was all non-Korean customers. I guess b/c this section gives first-timers a more authentic experience: sitting on the floor (with pillows available for comfort) where the tables are low to the ground. Plus no shoes allowed either - leave them on the centralized shoe rack ... so ladies, maybe keep your expensive pair of heels at home to avoid paranoia that someone else may walk home with your shoes. Another note - even though there's a vent system above each BBQ grill, there is still smoke everywhere and your clothes will reek like galbi even after you leave this place. Forgetting price, the galbi really was delicious here. Bulgogi & daeji bulgogi were pretty good, too. Banchan selection (side dishes) just average. But in this economy, money does matter - so if getting the best value is more your thing, you might want to go somewhere like Cho-Won Buffet instead.Lunch prices though are very fair here - most selections are $6.95.

And while the lamb by itself was really, REALLY good, the biyrani was really gross.  It might have been an off night, because the other reviews go on and on about it, but the rice tasted weird and didn't blend well with the lamb.  We also got pakoras, and I continued to eat them until I placed the weird flavor it reminded me of: Fruit Loops.  I know I sound insane saying that but it for real made me want Fruit Loops, and that's kind of a gross discovery when you're eating onion pakoras.I got the paneer tikka masala which was good, but the second time wasn't as good as the first time and I didn't take my leftovers to go.The nail in the coffin for me was the table of guys who came in super excited to try kababs.  They assumed Mumtaz Curry & Kababs would have kababs, and they were told they rarely had kababs available and needed to order something else.

My caesar salad was nothing to write home about, but it was solidly tasty. Two of my friends shared the crab cake appetizer which they thought was fine - again not amazing, but not horrible. The concensus of the group was that the food was solid all around.My bill with tip for the two happy hour drinks, appetizer, and salad was $13.

So here I am on Saturday evening, sitting on my couch watching my 8th college football game of the day while casually inhaling my 10th Mikes Hard Lemonade (side note: 5 star beverage, highly recommended). As I'm trying to get my tempo back for what was sure to be an exciting and enjoyable Saturday night with the fellas, I had an epiphany: to enjoy my Saturday night at all I needed an order of chicken wings in a TIMELY fashion. These chicken wings also needed to be delicious, so I decided to fire up the old Wings Over Somerville website. I was salivating as I sat perusing their impressively diverse sauce offerings, and immediately decided to get them on the horn as I settled on a traditional buffalo sauce and the delicious oriental sesame. So I order my food and the guy I'm talking to, don't know his name but it could've been a guy named Jeff, everyone knows a guy named Jeff. He says it's going to take an Hour and Half, now this is pretty much the opposite of timely; but my Saturday night was so dependent on these chicken wings that I grudgingly decided to accept it and sat excited for my wings. So 3 minutes and 26 seconds pass and one of my best friends, shoutout Tyler Scroggins, came over and also wanted some wings. Tyler and I are very close (this will be important later) he was there for my first desk pop in September '08, a formative moment in every man's life. We called Wings Over back and asked if we could add more wings to the previous order, they said yes, that it would still be an hour and a half. Naturally, I was grateful they went through the trouble and even added an extra tip! Now, 30 minutes pass and Tyler gets a call from Wings Over, we are elated! 30 minutes! Wow! But then Tyler gets the order, and only HIS food is in there. As I think 100% of trustworthy Americans would be, I was rattled. There was Tyler, hammering Wings as fast as Wade Boggs hammers beers, not even offering to share! I couldn't believe the audacity! Tyler and I haven't spoken since the incident. I called the driver and the restaurant back, they both ignored me, and then they delivered the wrong order an hour later and left so fast I couldn't even complain! The amount of audacity I had to deal with was insane, and my Saturday night was essentially ruined without efficiently delivered oriental sesame wings. So in summation: this simple order of wings ruined my Saturday night, and put one of my best friendships in peril. Only order from Wings Over if you are willing to accept those risks. I will probably order again because the food is pretty good, and I am a risk taker. If you don't live the bad boy life, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"name":"Regional Grill and Bayou","address":"3334 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Ok- first time at this place.

I'm no oyster connoisseur, so I usually just choose a dozen oysters at random.  There's so many options to choose from, with a lot being local, so it's fun to try a variety.For appetizers, I usually order the tartare and either a soup or the oyster sliders.  If you had to choose, opt for the tartare.For entrees, the lobster roe noodles is a no brainer.  It's rich, decadent and absolutely amazing.

Also, they carry this delicious Ginger Brew soda made by Maine Root (it's real ginger ale, zing and all).   The place also hybridizes the cafe and bar ambience:  There are side tables for people to chat or study/work at all hours of the day and night...but there is also a bar area where you can sit to drink and chat.  You can come here on your own to get some work done, or you can bring a group of friends and mingle. They also have music events (like DJs) on the weekends. Oh, and they have a good patio space.

Imagine an Au Bon Pain with a better menu. It's still ok for takeout, but it's not really a space where you'd want to spend time every day, and it doesn't really feel like it's part of the community. Compare it to, say, Mainely across the street, which kept almost all of the original Four Burgers staff when they took over the space, and where the owners worked the kitchen themselves last week so that staffers could participate in the Day Without Immigrants strike, or Veggie Galaxy down the street, who closed early to support the strike. Or compare them to 1369 next door, who donated a quarter of their sales to the ACLU a couple weekends ago. Not saying that you should replace all your quinoa and kale with truffle fries and vegan pies and dirty chai lattes, just pointing out a difference between how a more corporate Life Alive behaves, compared to the rest of the neighborhood.

Especially when coming from NY, everything is over priced here. My friend who lives in Columbia took my group here during their Happy Hour. It was basically half off everything except fajitas, tacos, chimes and desserts. But there was a lot of other options to get on their menu. My friends ordered wings, quesadillas, nachos and more. Over all the quality of the food was good, like your regular Mexican food that you'd find elsewhere. They had discounted drinks as well, which was definitely worth the price. I ordered the mango margarita and it hit the spot. Our waitress was great as well. I have no complaints on the service as our waitress regularly checked up on my table to ensure we were doing fine.

The food did come quickly and the server did come back and checked up on us. The food was really good (I hope it wasn't cause I was hungry). But I will give this place another try for their Beef chilli fries. \\nI'm not giving this place a 5 star because I still see improvements such as their service didn't wow me (like went above and beyond), the food was good but it could be better like the toast could use a bit more butter. \\nI would suggest to others to give this place a shot.

It was the service that dropped it to a 4 star.My companion for the evening also loves oysters, and seafood, and raw bars and the such. So we figured, instead of getting a couple oysters form the raw bar and meals, we would wine and dine in full raw bar style. A bottle of white, and then we got (I believe it was called) the Shelfish platter. \\nThey said it was for 4 people, but that would be as an appetizer I guess. We decided to attack if with the two of us as all our food that night.And WOW were we happy.aHUGE two platter came. Shellfish galore!\\n think 2 each of 7 different kinds of oysters. Then little necks. And cherry stones. and then two (cooked) chilled lobster tails. So much food, so delicious, and so many different flavors of oysters flowing in your mouth.It is amazing the different you can tell in taste, form the Island Creek signature to Naked Cowboys from Long island to west coat Long beach oysters when tasting them back to back. It readymade for a terrific meal.. which led to the second bottle of wine!So all in all, we spent $200+ on the meal for two, and there in lies the problem (IMO)And th only reason not for 5 stars. The service was meh.  The hostess was nice and seated us, but after that, we were not made to feel special in other ways. Maybe I expect to much. but the server did not explain anything about the oysters to us (at many other restaurants i have been to, including ones in the area, they explain the oysters, what to expect, different tastes, etc). He just pointed out which were which and walked away.We on two different occasions had to flag our server down since we did not get checked on.Like I said before,e maybe I am being to fair. Maybe I don't need to be pampered. It was a busy night, and maybe it was just that he was overwhelmed with tables. For all I know, someone may have called in sick and they were understaffed. Cut when you get a certain level of service at some places (specifically two doors down), you expect it at most place sin this price range.But don't let my unfortunate service experience dissuade you from trying the restaurant if you had not.

The one item that I kept noticing that people enjoyed was the Pappardelle al cinghiale - Homemade pappardelle pasta with slow cooked wild boar meat sauce for $16.50.  So that was what I ordered.  My second choice would have been the Linguine alle vongole - Linguine pasta with clams in a white wine and garlic sauce, my friend ordered that.  The homemade pappardelle pasta was wonderful.  I loved the texture and the taste.  I liked the wild boar meat sauce...but I would have liked it prepared a little differently.  The meat looked like ground beef..and I would have liked this prepared a little differently.    My friend's linguine alle vongole smelled amazing, and I vow to order that next time...because there will be a next time!We ordered the antipasto plate...and the selection of Italian meats were really delicious.  The bread that came before the meal was so soft and tasty with the basalmic vinegar and olive oil.  We were told that they get it from Lovejoy Bakery.The birthday boy received a tiramisu dessert...we all took a bite and it was really good.  My friend and I decided to share a chocolate mousse cake with a raspberry sauce on top.  It was delicious!  Not too sweet...it was light and airy.The atmosphere was cozy and charming.

It'd really take multiple visits to truly absorb everything Powell's has to offer but a first time visit is still worth getting lost in there for a good chunk of time. Easily understandable why it's one of Portland's main gems. A couple of my favorite traits of this bookstore are their choice of quotes that they display very modestly throughout the countless of shelves, the way they hand write and design their category titles, and the accessibility to their rare book room.

Powell's finds a way to display the best books with straight-to-the-point summaries. If you find a book you like, it will be displayed on a shelf with hundred of titles of the same genre or style.

I guess my experience upon arrival was that the staff was attentive initially but after ordering and waiting at their takeout window was basically ordered to go and stand in the rain and wait for lunch. It wasn't a mild suggestion it was an order given to me. I was then called in and received my 18.50 lunch which amounted to a small salad that fit in a tiny circular cup. I have seen appetizers way bigger than this. The sticky rice was about 2 mouth fulls for the low low price of 3.00 bucks. All said 18.50 between a salad which was again the smallest thing I have ever seen and 2 pinches of sticky rice. As it was being handed to me I had to witness one of their staff in the kitch get something in her eye due to another staff member accidentally grinding something that caused a food or sauce to hit her in the face. I was unhappy to see this happen to her. No one lenter her a hand and she was forced to wipe it clear before resuming her cooking duties. This of course not before she ran her hands in and out of her hair, wiped her face with her shirt and presumed her cooking responsibilities. I kind of had enough so I returned the food, unopened, was then told to wait till the manager arrived which she did do and was given my voided receipt without so much as what happened, what went wrong or I am sorry. There was nothing but could and callous eyes and a complete lack of regard for customer service or care in anything she offered. It was a complete failure. I have been told by people coming to Portland that they should ehck this place out. I would suggest not making the effort. It is not worth it. And from the reviews of friends also that have attended (first and only) they criticism of this \\"Nothing Special\\" place is that as it may seem surprising to some absolutely \\"Nothing Special\\". The lunch I received at Thai Roses in Beaverton was hands down better than this. Don't eat here. You will find the hype is nothing but that.

The service is very gruff, but I feel like it's almost an integral part of their atmosphere.  There is one cook in the kitchen and you can see into the kitchen from any seat in the small 20 seat restaurant.  I can't help but stare, because I really want to know how they cook such beautiful food.  My personal favorites are the squid meatballs (which the chef told me are made of all squid, surprisingly), and the squid ink pasta aglio olio.  Sometimes squid is difficult to impart with flavor, but the Daily Catch has that art down.  They are both such unique concepts, unlike the marinara etc. pasta at almost every other Italian place, that I could cook in my own kitchen.  I'm excited every time I go because I get to think about how they are making the food, and watch it too.  It's a bit pricey, but worth it in my opinion.

I'm sorry to say it just didn't do it for me. I have been coming to Orlando's Little Vietnam for years to get my pho fix, and I've tried many places along the way. Most of them were disappointments but a few of them were home runs. Sadly, this place didn't even come close what I would call a pho restaurant.I knew going into Thuyen Vien that they served vegetarian dishes, and I was interested to see their take on a traditional beef broth soup like pho. When I walked in I was surprised at how small it was (only 3 tables) and by the deli-style atmosphere. There were spring and summer rolls wrapped in plastic sitting on the counter, amongst some other pre-made finger foods. After sitting down the owner quickly approached me to ask if I was ready to order. I inquired about a menu and he gestured to the small placard already at the table, which had about 5 options all for $5. Knowingly I ordered the pho along with some spring rolls. As the owner hurried away to unwrap my appetizer I wondered if I would be offered any water (nope), and when he came back to drop off my spring rolls I had to ask for the fish sauce.The spring rolls were terribly stale, flavorless, ice cold and dried out on the ends. I couldn't even bring myself to finish one. As I waited patiently for my pho to come out, I noticed that the owner and his family seemed to be setting one of the tables for dinner. They brought out hot plates of fresh steaming food and sat down to eat while I gazed hungrily at their feast. My pho came out midway through their meal, and much to my dismay it seemed to be child-sized. I figured this couldn't possibly be intended for me, until I realized I was the only person in the restaurant besides the owner and his family. Disappointed, I added my fixings and sipped the clear broth. Bland, bland, bland! What I ate was not pho. Pho is a fatty broth made from the marrow of delicious meaty bones, where it gets its flavor (and the right to call itself pho in the first place). If I'm too harsh it's because I'm Vietnamese and I know what real pho is. This place fell drastically short of my expectations and I left my bowl half eaten. The only good thing about Thuyen Vien is that it's cheap, and unfortunately I got what I paid for."},{"name":"Ristorante Roma","address":"1216 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Small family restaurant myself and my family love!

We spent most of the night trying to figure out whether he had ever told us his name or whether all of us just have ADD) was attentive, funny, and reminded me of Zach Galifianakis, but slimmer and less pedophile-y looking (I think it's the beard...). As my friend put it, \\"He's quite a winker. I think he winked at you a few times. No?\\" He referred to us by our first names, as we responded with \\"How do you know our names?\\" / \\"Well, you said it.\\" / \\"Oh. We did?\\" We assumed he was either unbelievably attentive or creeps our photos/follows us on Instagram.Lo and behold, you can't go wrong with the food, particularly the oysters here. The service is superb, and the ambiance is cozy and sleek, with enough booths where you can semi-privately stuff your face with as many oysters as you fancy, without offending anyone with oyster juice spillage to your left or right as you down those babies."},{"name":"Kabsah","address":"9436 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great service.

There is also street parking available as well as a small lot next to the restaurant.Service: The waiter we had did a great job, even for our group of 7 people service was fast polite and efficient.Food/drinks: I am typically let down by steak houses. I have high expectations when I dine at a restaurant that specializes in a type of food that I like, so I tend to be more critical of it. KRS does not disappoint! The dry-aged steak for 3 that I shared with some others was simply amazing. We also had a couple bottles of wine to go with it as well as the 'Full Monty' appetizer(good but not a lot of food though). the oysters, jumbo shrimp were excellent! It's kind of a pain that you have to order sides separately from the entree's, however we tried a few and they were all good, but nothing too special here. Finally we tried 3 desserts, and i would recommend any of them as they were all great. The vanilla bean creme brulee, the peach crisp, and the banana pudding.

Our food was delicious, but I'm not sure that it's any better than some of the best neighborhood SE Asian restaurants I've visited, though I'm definitely certain it's pricier than those establishments. In the end, it was this perceived value that lowered my rating to three stars. The dishes our party ordered were delicious, but for the price we paid, an accompaniment like rice should not have had to be ordered extra, a la carte. I had the game hen - extolled in review after review as one of the best birds in Portland. No doubt, it was a good dish, but I've had more flavorful (and more tender) BBQ poultry from any number of local Thai restaurants. A friend had the steak salad - also good, though it seemed to lack a counterpoint to the somewhat bitter spices used on the meat. The portion size was particularly disappointing for this dish, too. Another person had the baby back ribs - reportedly tasty, but, again, given the price and portion size, rice should have been included.The standout dinner dish was the boar collar. Any complaint about serving size on this dish was mitigated by incredibly bright, vivid flavors - it's a spicy dish, and mustard greens cooled with ice are presented to chew on for heat relief. Also wonderful were the desserts - we had the affogato (made with condensed milk ice cream and Vietnamese coffee), which was decadent without being too rich, and the Whiskeysoda float, which was a novel offering with its bourbon ice cream base.We got in early enough to avoid a wait, and service was mostly spot on. Overall, this was a good experience, just not as great as I had hoped with the build-up this restaurant has received. We will definitely be returning to try other dishes, like the chicken wings and perhaps some seafood. If we can hit on more dishes like the boar collar, I'd happily bump the rating."},{"name":"Pho Saigon","address":"10411 NE Fourth Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite pho place ever!

Today I am being generous to give three stars.  I have never been to this specific Starbucks, so I cannot say if this is an exception or that it was 7 PM on a weekday, so maybe things got too lax.I rushed inside the store and needed to use the restroom first.  There were two unisex bathrooms and one was out of order so I used the other.  It appeared that the lock was not working, but oh well.  Just spread out on the toilet and relax I suppose.After that I went to the front counter to order.  Usually always someone is standing there and can immediately take my order (at other Starbucks).  No one was by the counter and all the employees were in the back talking (maybe helping drive-thru customers).  After a few long moments a girl came up to the counter for me order.  I ordered a tall Pike Place Roast with room for cream.  Then I looked in the pastry case and saw only one scone.  I asked if they had other flavors and the barista informed me that they have all three flavors in the back so I asked for a blueberry scone.As she made the coffee, when I asked for room for cream she ran out to the dining room and said that I don't want to use that cream.  I suppose maybe it had been out all day.  She brought out some cream from the refrigerator behind the counter.  I then mentioned that I was actually looking for skim milk.  Then she put the cream back in the refrigerator and pulled out a gallon of Dairyman's skim milk.  It looked like caramel or something else had dropped all over the jug.  She did not offer to put the milk in my coffee so I did it myself.The blueberry scone was still in the wrapper.  Usually there is inventory in the pastry case and the barista puts it in a bag.  I guess the wrapper proves that it is fresh. Then I proceeded to the coffee station to add my Splenda.  I noticed that one napkin dispenser was out and needed to be restocked.  Also, no cream, whole milk, or skim milk were out, but like I said, maybe because it was 7 PM on a weekday.The dining room in general was dirty.  As I looked for a table to sit at, I noticed that almost all the tables were dirty and not wiped off.  They were not busy and have never seen a Starbucks dining room so in disarray.  I ate my scone (which was fresher than usual, because it was still in the wrapper) and drank some of my coffee. As I soon left, because the atmosphere was so unappealing I noticed fingerprints all over the front door.The only saving grace to this review was the quality of the product.  It was a very good cup of Pike Place Roast ,the blueberry scone was fresh because it was still in the wrapper, and the server stopped me from using the cream in the dining room.  Without these pluses, it would have been a two star review.

Tables spaced with ample room, families on Mother's Day all happy and chipper, the waitstaff smiling and happy.  Even the Sunday Brunch menu looked promising, although a little ordinary and lacking in choice...but that's what I expect from a bar-like eatery. So why-oh-why-oh-why did you fail so completely to execute.My coffee, delivered in a glass (ishhh...just not right) was luke-warm and the bottom was rather ground-heavy.  I finished 2/3 and could go no further.  My salmon omlet, while tasty, was again delivered on the edge of cold, along with a luke-warm pile of tots.  It all looked good, and had it been hot, I'm fairly confident it would've been tastier, I just fail to see why everything was delivered as if it had been waiting in the kitchen for 15 minutes first.  Nevertheless I carried on, delighted that your WiFi extends to the farther reaches of your patio, from which I know write this review.The finishing blow, the unforgivable part, and I am quite conflicted at even saying so, in fact I feel ethically compelled to both say this (for my fellow diners) and to not say it (because I don't want to be too harsh on a new place) ...is that deep fried with my tots, legs up on my plate...was a many-legged critter.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, my meal was mostly complete when I spied my crunchy little friend.

The first time I had it, the lightly dusted and fried calamari bites were crunchy, yet VERY chewing.  Surely it was overcooked.  I gave the calamari another try today and still was left less than impressed.  This time, the calamari was crispy and more tender, but was lacking in flavor (ie. salt).  Yes, the calamari is served with a nice aioli, but in my opinion the calamari should be able to stand on its own pre-sauce dipping.---Dishes mentioned in this review, per Ceviche's website---POTATAS BRAVAS - Fried potatoes tossed in a spicy homemade aioli...CEVICHE DE SALMON - Fresh salmon marinated in lemon, lime, cilantro, sweet onions, and topped with caviar...

Wings were good, maybe not up to their reputation (but could any live up to that).  \\nPapaya salad was great and so were the entrees and dessert.  Service was very good.  Why only 3 stars.

It wants to be upscale but casual, but still wants to charge you a somewhat high price to dine/drink there.   Let me set the mood, my sister, Melanie has Celiac Disease, which means she is severely allergic to gluten and wheat.  Burton's has a gluten free menu.  So nice!  We had tix to the Sox v. D'backs game and made a reservation for 3 people at 6pm (6 was their first available and the game was at 7:05pm, so we had to hustle).  My bf joined us as the third person.  Well, we had a major rainstorm and lost power @ our house in Allston, but made our way to Burton's about 5 minutes late due to the storm and slow driving.  They were accommodating with my slight lateness.  Let's start with what I always order first, a beverage. I was not going to imbibe, but after that harrowing trek, I decided to treat myself to one of their $9.00 Martinis.  I'm a girl when it comes to these 'tinis, so I chose what else, the Pina Colada Tini.  It was served very chilled and shaken by our sweet server who wore a pink Ellsbury shirt (she got points for wearing my favorite player, but a pink shirt)?!  Anywhoo, the drink hit the proverbial spot.  It was just what I needed.  It was reminiscent of when I was a kid and I got to lick the bowl after my mom mixed cake batter.  It just tasted nice, and it was a bit on the thick side for a martini, but I wasn't complaining.  Melanie read the menu online before coming to Burton's and emailed me earlier in the day and excitedly sent me word that she was going to get the \\"buffalo tenders!!!!!\\"  She actually could get them and normally, if you can't have gluten, these are ruled out.  But, they are made with buttermilk and cornmeal and served with sliced carrot sticks and sliced cucumber sticks.  A side of Roquefort cheese and blue cheese crumbles accompanies this appetizer.  I got the wild mushroom and artichoke risotto, which was comforting to me on this chilly June night.  Bill, the bf, got the shrimp pasta and asked for a little crushed red \\"peppa\\" - he always says that with the thickest Boston accent - our waitress, Sharon, obliged.  The service was wonderful, we were happy, the rain stopped, and the Sox won.  A perfect night.   This will be our new go to place before the game and probably in the off-season.  A bonus was they had ample restrooms and they were CLEAN!!  A must stop for me before heading into Fenway!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I heard this place is known for their chix wings so I HAD to come here.

They were so hospitable and welcomed us to try any wine before committing and they also use the Coravin wine system which allows you to try their expensive bottles by the glass! We also were here on a Monday and they have a Magnum wine Monday special. So we were a table of 6 and tried a bunch of apps: clams, mussels, crab cakes, fried green tomatoes, shrimp cocktail, and shishito peppers! Every single one was delicious! Would not change one thing about any of the dishes. And like Kayla said to us when we asked for recommendations: \\"you really can't go wrong with anything as our chefs turn everything to gold\\". Ain't that the truth!For my entree, I had the lobster roe pasta and it was divine! Really great combination of textures and freshly made pasta that left me licking the plate clean.

Why could you not have been open when I first moved to Boston and instead choose my last year of living there to open your doors? Now let me start by saying I am not a huge oyster fan.So I had a friend in town from DC and we decided to check out ICOB after hearing all of the awesome reviews about it. I made a reservation a few weeks in advance and on a Friday night we head over to comm ave. This place from the outside is super cool looking. We step inside and it is very modern and has a \\"hip\\" vibe to it. Huge fan of the set up. The oyster bar is right at the entrance as you walk in and as you walk further towards the back it opens up to the main dining area. We are greeted warmly as we enter and immediately seated. We start perusing the menu and I am impressed by the cocktail menu as well as the food options. We decide to start with a dozen island creek oysters. Normally I am concerned about oysters because they have a lot of brine to them but these were perfect. I have also heard that the Misty Point and Spring Creek Oysters are solid with people preferring the Misty Point a bit more. I also order a Moscow Mule with a few other cocktails. Each one tasted great and they were definitely strong enough so very much so appreciated. I go ahead and order the Lobster Roe Pasta. Oh man this pasta dish is awesome. I love pasta and the noodles on this plate were just awesome. The braised ribs and the lobster tail on top is the perfect finish to this dish. The lobster is succulent and the ribs offer tender meat that is savory pairing well with the overall dish. The sauce was delicious as well I just wish I could have had more of this. My friend had the trout which she thoroughly enjoyed. I was so focused on my lobster roe pasta that I was not able to sneak a bite from her plate. We had also ordered the Oyster Slider which was awesome. The lime chile aioli was just a perfect pair with the fried oyster which is just perfectly fried as well. I wish the oysters were bigger because this is literally just a small slider. I am clearly just hating because it was so good.Honestly, the food here is bomb. I swear by this place and recommend this joint to a lot of folks visiting from out of town or if folks travel to Boston for work. If you are unsure, just order the items above as they seem to have made the \\"review highlights\\" in yelp as well.

The buffet was good, unlike other restaurant brunch buffets, this one was clean, had variety, was served warm and fresh. The chicken cornflake strips with the honey mustard sauce was AMAZING! So tender, crispy and FULL of flavor. Highly, highly, recommend! Other dishes to mention were the corn beef and hash, turkey, jalenpeno croissants, pesto pasta salad and white chocolate bread pudding. Beware coffee is not included in the Sunday brunch. My friend and I had ordered it thinking it was part of the $16.95, but we were charged separately for it. Overall, great brunch for the family or if you have friends in town.

Good, I'm glad you're on board.THE SCENE\\nIt's Tuesday night and the roommie and I decided we wanted to attend a Sad Bastard music event at The Volstead that started at *GASP* 10 p.m. Knowing full well that we are both old ladies, we decided to leave the house before 8 p.m. to ensure we made it. So what are some old vegans to do to pass the time without getting too wild? Eat at Counter Culture, of course!THE MENU\\nI'm not sure I adequately contained my enthusiasm at the thought of being able to order almost anything on the menu. Seriously. It was the kind of giddiness that only manifests itself on my face when I'm about to watch a Nicolas Cage movie marathon at Alamo Drafthouse. Seriously.THE ORDER\\nThe roommie ordered the Pac Man salad (omg those carrots are too cute) and added a scoop of garbanzo tuna. All of the flavors complimented each other nicely, and that garlic dressing was surely something sent down straight from heaven. I decided to go the less healthy route and order the Philly Seitan because, ya know, TREAT YO SELF. IT. WAS. DELICIOUS. Seriously. That cashew cheeze can go on all of my meals from now. It was great. I got a side of the roasted veggies, and because it's the season of root vegetables, got sweet potatoes and beets. Let me tell you how I felt about that: I wasn't mad. Not at all. BEETS 4 LIFE.THE FOLLOW-UP VISIT\\nWhat's a good visit to restaurant without a second, and this time with a bunch of omnivores who are mildly terrified at the thought of eating an ENTIRELY VEGAN MEAL OMG? The roommie and I each played guide to our respective halves of the table. (What's tempeh? What's seitan? HOW CAN YOU EAT LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME?) While everyone else carefully deliberated over their non-meat selections, we decided to split the Spicy Raw Pad Thai with a side of roasted vegetables and a side of the Jalape√±o cornbread. We also got an order of the raw bruschetta, and didn't regret one bite of it. The pesto! Just so yum. We loved the cornbread, but both decided the spicy raw pad thai was a little bland and drenched it in Sriracha. Other things that we sampled from our omnivorous friends that get two thumbs ups:\\n- Spicy Baked Artichoke Dip\\n- Tempeh Reuben\\n- Mac & Cheese\\n- Lentil LoafSeriously, if you're a vegan or have vegans you know and love, go here.

Ouch!  The polyester filled pillows weren't doing the trick, but small price to pay for a delicious meal.\\n \\nSo, Baraka Cafe is truly an experience.  At first the service was pretty, how do i say this nicely, brisk (that's code for rude).  Perhaps it was our motley crew -- some Jewish ladies, a couple of Italians, some Asians, a Deaf pregnant black Jewish teenaged lesbian who is actually a gay man, and Sinead O'Connor's hot sister, to name a few.  But like Seinfeld's soup Nazi, the server had her own charm.  She as very impressed with Barbara Ann's beautiful ketchup bottle shaped cake, but after seeing that the label was made from paper, she exclaimed \\"she cheated!\\" which was classic. \\n \\nI ordered a tasty dish consisting of a delicious salad -- whatever that dressing is, i want to marry it and make babies-- some skewers of meat, vegetables in a spicy tomatoey sauce, and cous cous.  It was supposed to come with pommes frites but i didn't want those, which the server thought was a travesty.  The meat was really tasty!  Apparently the red meat was lamb leg, which i asked about because it tasted very gamey but i knew the place was Halal so was wondering if it was buffalo or what?  But it was bambi.  There wasn't much meat, but i felt like the portion sizes were perfect, especially with Baraka's philosophy of not wasting food.  There was also a sausage that looked like a little penis that I gave to Cara so I can't comment on it.  The server was concerned I didn't like my cous cous because i didnt eat much of it, and i didn't want to tell her i wasn't going to eat her evil carbs so i just said I was full, which was acceptable.

We ordered the shrimp corn dog starters and shared the corn flake crusted chicken salad and the baked Mac and cheese. It was incredible how quickly everything came out. I don't say that in a, \\"Wow! This is awesome!\\" kind of way. It wasn't right. The shrimp corn dogs were not very good at all. The shrimp inside is not seasoned and is just slightly cooked. I don't know too many people who like to boil their shrimp, don't we all love them grilled with lots of seasoning and butter? I understand that they are fried not boiled but the texture was as if it was. The shrimp did not cut between your teeth when you took a bite because they were under cooked. And the batter was soggy, not crispy and fluffy like corn dog batter should be. The chicken salad was average, such little greens compared to the chicken considering it's a salad. I will say that the chicken is among the juiciest chicken I've had. The Mac and cheese was not good at all and though it came in a ramekin was sort of like warm.

($49.8 per pound). They showed the crab in front of us as usually when ordering any live seafood at any Chinese restaurant. The first dish - steam legs - arrived  and that is. No more steam legs. This must be a joke. They steal us half of the legs!!! Sons of bitches. The second dish - deep fried body appear to be reasonable as well as the 3rd dish - fried rice. I can not believe such reputable restaurant does what all other low quality restaurants do.  Very disappointed! I asked the waiter, there is must be something, you either miscalculate the crab weight or you forgot to bring the other half of the legs. The waiter, by the name of Victor, said that is all with a big smile. WTF!  So I told him to pass my message to the kitchen staff as follow:  whom eaten part of my king crab, he or she will have bad luck from now on!

And I was surprised as it was not bad considering the restaurant is part of the Marriott. Usually restaurants that are connected to Marriott or hotels are just so bland or okay that it's usually better to leave and go out to eat. But this place wasn't bad at all!So what did I order? We shared the \\"firecracker shrimp\\" and \\"crab rangoon dip.\\" Both appetizers were pretty good to start off with. I wouldn't say that the firecracker shrimp was really spicy at all. The sweet chili sauce is usually more sweet than chili which is exactly the flavor that you get for the shrimp. The crab rangoon was alright as well, the dip was plenty flavorful I wished that there was more celery/veggies because I'm not so big on carbs. I ended with my entr√©e with the short rib risotto. I thought the short rib was cooked pretty well and it wasn't dry or overcooked. I enjoyed the flavor and the risotto packed a good amount of flavor as well. I enjoyed that it wasn't more risotto than usual and the balance of the amount of food was well done.Overall, I would recommend this place if you're staying at the Marriott and you don't want to leave the hotel. If you're a foodie adventurer though, I wouldn't find myself here as there's better options elsewhere, but this place would definitely be an option for convenience for travelers.TLDR; the firecracker shrimp isn't really spicy, but more on the sweet side, the crab rangoon is okay, but I would recommend to put the short rib as the entr√©e if you're indecisive.

Unfortunately, though we did have a nice time, it simply did not measure up to our high expectations.  We spent around 3 hours here, due to the convenient location near an event we were in town to attend.We arrived around 4 PM on a Saturday afternoon and stayed until around 7 PM.   They were moderately busy when we arrived and slightly more so as we were leaving.  We were seated quickly, party of 2, and had a table at a nice location.Here is our impression:Overall experience/atmosphere:\\nNice modern atmosphere with very friendly and helpful wait staff who seem to support each other well.   It was a fun atmosphere, and it was apparent that the employees were striving for a good experience for all guests.   Of everything we include in an evaluation, this category is where The Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill shined the most.   Free seasoned popcorn at the table was a nice touch and helped keep the experience fun and increased the overall appeal of the visit.  They offered a small military discount, which is always appreciated, so a few extra points for that.Food:\\nThe food was, sorry to say, simply bland.   There really wasn't any 'wow factor\\" in anything we tried, and we tried several things.   Details below:\\nThe Original Moonshine \\"Corn Dog\\" Shrimp Appetizer- \\nWe ordered this after deciding to start our new Yelp account and begin completing reviews, since it is named after the establishment we were at it seemed the logical choice.   Unfortunately, our impression of the shrimp was that it was mediocre at best.   Presentation was nice, but the taste was just, well, lacking.   The Raspberry sauce on the mustard was little more than coloring, so what might have added some flare turned out to be a big miss.   Overall the best we could agree upon for this appetizer was a rating of 2 stars, which we consider generous.\\nPimento Cheeseburger - \\nThis was actually the best item we tried on the menu.   It was well prepared and had some nice flavors to it.   It still lacked a real \\"special\\" quality to it though, aside from just being generally \\"good\\".   We agreed upon a rating of 3 stars for the burger since it did have some nice flavors, but could not rate it higher due to a lack of uniqueness.\\nRanger Cattle Texas Wagyu Meatloaf - \\nThis was a recommendation from a friend, & I had been wanting to have some good meatloaf for a while, so I ordered this with high expectations.   Unfortunately, those expectations simply were not delivered.  The meatloaf was about as plain and unremarkable as you could possibly imagine.   It was edible, sure, but it was not by any means \\"good\\".   I could not finish it, it was just too bland and lacked much flavor at all.   We could not rate it anything other than 1 star.Drinks:\\nThe drinks were average to slightly above average.   Still no real \\"wow factor\\", but they were certainly tasty, even if not overly unique.  Details below:\\nSouthern Belle - \\nThis sweet drink was tasty and we ordered multiples of these.   Definitely room to flare it up a bit but at the end of the day, it is a tasty drink.   We rate it at 3.5 stars.\\nHard Lemonade - \\nBasically similar to off-the-shelf hard lemonade you can buy at the grocery store, but similarly, tasty.   Again nothing necessarily special about it, but it was a nice drink and we did have 2 of them, so it was worth ordering a second time.   We rate this drink at 3.5 stars also.Wait Staff/Service:\\nThe wait staff was for the most part on top of things, although after our first batch of the popcorn, we didn't get the refill we wanted and had asked for for what seemed a little more time than should be expected and ended up asking about it more than once.   Our waitress did have a cute accent which was a nice touch and added to the fun experience, and she made sure to introduce herself and ask about our prior experience at the restaurant in order to give us good general information about it, which was nice and helpful.   For the most parts our drinks were kept full and replaced throughout our visit, which is a testament to their solid teamwork among the wait staff.   We would rate the overall service at a solid 4, discounting for the slow popcorn refill which should probably have been caught earlier than it was.Conclusion:\\nAgain, overall, it was a nice evening, and we had a good experience - we just weren't \\"wowed\\" by any of our experience here.  With all that Austin has to offer though, even with the nice atmosphere and solid wait staff, the blandness of the food will probably prevent us from coming back again or recommending it to our friends.  We really wanted to love it, but when we got down to brass taxes in an objective review, we simply had to arrive at the star rating that we did.   We would not tell anyone not to go here, it is a nice place, but we also won't be going out of our way to recommend that they do, either."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here on a Sunday night and still had to wait an hour before our table was ready.

We also got the Boars neck dish (delicious!) and the flank steak salad which kinda tastes like others Ive had. Also got the Wun Sen which was good, and a golden fried tilapia which was a special.

Despite having a reservation we were 20 mins late due to the absurd commencement traffic yet were still able to get seated right away. The ambiance of the place was very upscale and refined with decor being superb. Off the bat id have to say the restaurant was disappointing due to food being subpar to the price being charged for it and the long wait we had to endure before our entrees came. The lobster noodle roe and monkfish were both okay but not fantastic despite being $38 and $34 respectively. The lobster noodle roe had a cheesy flavor to the noodles with portions for lobster not that much. The monkfish, on the other hand, seemed kinda like Chinese food to me and was too watery with the risotto served along with the dish submerged in the watery soup of the dish.The one highlight of the place were its oysters (though you have to get ready to pay around $3-10 for each) which were tasty and fresh.

Overall the food was good, a bit pricey for the quality, but still pretty good. The service on the other hand was slow, condescending and very forgetful. We had reservations at 830 so the place wasn't exactly jumping and for some reason it took over 30 minutes for individual drinks, not the super complex mix drinks, simple pour and shake stuff. Second the waitress forgot at least 4 different orders, which took well over 3 hours to complete. This was my first time doing tapas as a large group and have to say I was less then impressed. It wouldn't have been a huge deal had I not called them a week in advance, told them our party size, that it was a birthday party and that my wife was gluten intolerant. My guess is because the tip was included,which was 20% instead of the standard 18% for large parties, our waitress decided her tip was already secure and why put any effort into increasing our enjoyment."},{"name":"Wok Eat","address":"946 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"2.5","text":"Two times I've tried to eat here.

A good-sized bowl of heaven!\\nThe Abu ramen is a brothless ramen. Noodles mixed with a spicy (but not too spicy) chili sauce, bean sprouts, chashu pork, green onions, and a soft boiled egg. Super tasty!Oh yeah, we tried the Caesar Japonais and fell in love! The salmon sashimi and the dashi dressing made this a standout. My husband's hot and sour ramen was mostly just hot; he said he couldn't taste any vinegar in it, so there wasn't much sour. My dad had the chicken katsu curry and cleaned his plate completely; guess he liked it! The restaurant has a few different sections, each of which provides a different feel to the place.

My only complaint is that they don't give you enough noodles. On each successive trip to the restaurant I feel like the portions have gotten smaller and smaller.  The prices aren't terrible and the taste is amazing so it's still worth it. The scene is pretty good, complete with classy locals, visiting business crowd and the occasional rich BU kid family from europe or the middle east (sitting next to us with body guards last time!).

As for the food (the important stuff!) we shared a few appetizers which turned out to be a little hit or miss. The bacon dip which we were all super excited to try was a bit of a disappointment with not much bacon flavor.However, the roasted garlic made up for our disappointment as it exceed our expectations. It was perfectly roasted to spreadable garlicky deliciousness. We ate every bite!For my entree I had the chicken fried steak which was perfectly cooked, delicious and HUGE! It was a bit of a bummer that I was on vacay cuz I would've loved to have taken home the other half but no-go at the hotel with this so I had to leave it.  I also tried a few of my friend's dishes including the scallops which were really yummy. We shared two desserts - the apple skillet pie which was gorgeous but taste-wise was just kinda okay.

Although I didn't consume anything from the raw bar, my friend got a couple of different oysters and enjoyed them. (As you can tell, I'm not quite a raw bar expert..) In addition to the lobster roll, I ordered the grape sorbet for dessert. Oh boy, I wanted something sweet and I definitely got nothing less than sweetness in my mouth.. perhaps, it was a bit too sweet. The sorbet tasted like frozen sweet, sweet grapes that melt away in your mouth.Anyway, located near the Kenmore T stop off the green line, this place is easily accessible.

Started with the Tequila Sunrise and Prickly Margarita and both were right on time. And the comp chips and salsa were delicious. Moved on to the wings, not bad on flavor but would have like the skin to be a bit more crispy. The street corn had a tasty twist with the lime and cheese...yummm and the fact it came in the mason jar...Super cute. Let's see the bacon/shrimp our 2nd order had way more heat than the first. I was a fan but my friends not so much, lol. My friends enjoyed the quesadillas but none of us were fans of the deviled eggs. A little on the boring side. The bean dip was tasty and the queso was just your run of the mill queso.Overall not bad. Our server was friendly but busy. Great location and I'll be back!

I tried the chipotle mayo that came with the sandwich and it was delicious, with a nice pop of spice.My gluten-free friend ordered the Chicken Risotto and gave it a great review.

The menu is decent and I appreciate that they offer alcoholic beverages for those who are fortunate enough to dictate their own schedules. The staff was pleasant and quick. I love Americanos so I tried a variation of theirs which had one less shot of espresso. It was good, but the quantity is less than I expected, barely filling half of a plastic cup even with ice.

I'm a serious TX BBQ lover. There are so many levels for grading good smoked meats. Honestly, its difficult to give five stars unless everything is perfect right down to the sides and sauce if needed.Rudy's is a solid 4.5 stars. The meats get 4 stars. The sides which are usually the downfall of my overall grading gets 5 stars in my opinion. Keep in mind that It's merely an opinion. The cole slaw, pinto beans, creamed corn, banana pudding and potato salad remind me of why I fell in love with BBQ sides at a very early age from picnics, camping and family cookouts. It just tastes like family homemade.The meat:  Lean brisket? No! The cutters choice is awesome and the flavor is out of this world without any sauce. The jalapeno sausage links are fabulous. Chicken is mouth watering and not dry. The ribs and turkey breast are OK. This is where the meats' score drops a little. The ribs are good, but I've had better. The brine or seasoning for the turkey breast is just meh.I love Rudy's, and can always get consistently quality food here. I hate that sometimes I have to go here because Lockhart, Taylor and Driftwood is just too far when I'm wanting BBQ Now! But I can always count on Rudy's.

In response, she said that she would bring out cook to explain.The cook came out 5 minutes later, saying that he had just got the order for the antipasto, and had immediately put the focaccia into the oven. We told him to cancel the pizza as well, he said that he would do so.The antipasto finally came out. The focaccia was little better than cardboard. But we were hungry, and ate what we could. The cold antipasto was OK. In the meantime, we had to listen as our waitress complained about the stress she got from other diners to people at the next table over. It felt like a scene from a Food Network show about bad restaurants.Another 10 minutes later, a second waitress brought out the pizza that we cancelled with both the waitress and the cook.

The store is super organized by section, like travel and food. They sell both new and used books and there are shelves with special sale books and staff recommendations. I forget which room it is, but in one of them, there's a section on books about just Portland.

The menu had an excellent variety of greek options with some American classics for picky kids...all of which seemed to be freshly prepared in house. The pitas were soft and warm, the tzatziki light and creamy, and garlic dressing delicious! We ordered gyros with fresh cut fries, greek salad with falafel and a kids' meal of pasta that came with crispy, golden fried REAL chicken strips. The portions were generous and very reasonable priced. The waitress was attentive and the owner made conversation with the kids and followed up to ask if they could have \\"done anything better.\\" All this being said, we were on a schedule and the entire visit lasted longer than we may have anticipated. BUT it was well worth it. I'm happy to wait for a meal that is made of real ingredients and actually prepared, not just warmed up.

Dollar Hot Pot Restaurant  is located in Richmond on No.3 Road / Brownsgate in a little strip mall besides Aberdeen. Back in the day it used to be Monkey's (a little drinking hideaway I used to frequent on the 2nd floor). It's amazing how times has changed and how the once dirty place cleaned up so much and is now a AYCE hot pot place.What's different about this AYCE hot pot joint is that they are served in individual sized pots. Each person can choose their own soup base and if you like to share (btw sharing is caring!). Plus you can sample more varieties! Sour cabbage and fish soup - a flavorful light soup with a punch of pickled cabbage. House spicy soup - increasingly spicy as the night progresses!Regular menu is $23.95/pp while late night is $19.95/pp and both offers a variety of meat, seafood, veggies, and dumplings.Once everything is set, head over to the buffet bar to mix your own dip sauce.\\nMinced garlic, cilantro, chives, jalapenos, chilli oil, soy sauce, sesame paste etc. are readily available! Add an egg with your sauce. Beauty of it all is that you can always come back for seconds and thirds...When the food finally arrived, everything looked pretty fresh and clean... nothing looked below par and veggies weren't burnt. Quality for an AYCE place was definitely better than I expected. Fish slices looked and tasted pretty elastic and not mushy!Even the typical anorexic oysters were plumped and juicy (remember to scoop out the meat and do not submerge the whole thing shell on into the soup! We saw someone do that - not cool). Hokkigai were also available. We found it slightly tough tho.Mushrooms are multiple varieties. Minced Shrimp Paste. Minced Dace Fish Paste. \\nI personally love eating some veggies before my soup based gets too oily from all the meat contamination; but my friends, even Dave makes fun of me for being too \\"banana\\" ex. eating salad as an appie...My best choice would be fish slices (absolutely adore), lots of veggies, oysters and few fatty beef slices. Bewilders me how the boys can eat beef slices like they are noodles... some natural born talent I will never acquire...Order some chrysanthemum tea to take away the \\"hot air\\" from too much spicy food!

Stopped in recently and experienced rude service from one of the hostesses.  We arrived at about 4:30pm and restaurant was quiet with a few people in the bar area including the booths.  Upon entering, the hostess immediately asked if we wanted to sit in the bar, when I answered that we wanted to sit in the restaurant, attitude took over.  She walked us into the restaurant and seated us next to the only other table that was occupied by two other women (next to the window facing Boylston St.).  I asked if we could sit in the booth since it would be warmer and more comfortable for my 81 year old mother.  Again, a rude reaction and she barely threw the menus down.  Okay, I guess she was having a bad day and perhaps should have called in sick....There was a lot of chatter among the staff and it took a while for our waitress to come over.  She was nice enough but seemed to have her mind somewhere else.  We ordered an appetizer, soup for mom and I had the seared scallops with corn.  Everything was good except the scallops and corn.  The dish was cold.  The scallops were cold in the center.  I have enjoyed this dish several times in Boston and the Hingham location and it has always been prepared perfectly.

The room service was amazing . We ordered a pizza , whole grain crust and buffalo wings our first night after arriving from Disney . It was delicious . The pool was also great ! They allow you two tubes per room which worked out , one for me and my husband . We took our own tubes for our kids . But they do sell there at the pool of you should need . Everyday at the pool we ordered food , for the kids it was usually chicken fingers and fries it was served with the most delicious honey mustard I've ever had ! On one of the days my husband got a turkey BLT served on sour dough bread and it was amazing . Super fresh . Another day he got the burger and that burger was so so good . It was a nice hardy , classic burger . I ordered a fruit bowl and it was fresh served with toasted coconut flakes and fresh mint , WOW ! This was all from all from the quench bar . You just put up little flags that are on all the pool chairs and a server comes to you . The customer service at this hotel , whether it's the bell hop guys or the front desk clerks or the valet people or the servers at the restaurant, they are all so so professional, everyone in a great mood .

It just... is. WHYYY? ok, I used to go by there every day before class and get a sausage and egg breakfast taco. They have absolutely incredible breakfast tacos. Their eggs are just so flavorful and their sausage is incredible and the two ingredients are always a tiny bit juicy (just the right amount) and they're nestled together in a warm amazing soft flour tortilla. Darn I want one right now. I've had plenty of breakfast tacos and the one that's gotten the closest to beating it is Texas Honey Ham. But Rudy's beats them just because their tacos are so simple yet they taste SO good. I don't even think cheese is necessary (and I'm obsessed with cheese), they have the perfect amount of seasoning and flavor. I'm actually going to get one tomorrow now. Obviously I can't just rave about their breakfast tacos. Their lean brisket is the bomb. I've heard sooo many people (including my friend who works at a meat market) say that extra moist meat is the best because it has the most fat and flavor and it doesn't dry out as easily. I happen to disagree with them on this occation. My mom orders their lean brisket in 8 lb crates and then freezes it, haha, she's kind of silly, but smart! I can't explain to you the way the car smells once we pick it up, and then when we get home and open the crate, it's heaven! The brisket has absolutely never been dry (at least for me) and it has always frozen well. Sure, the last few frozen pieces of brisket don't hold the juices as well as the totally fresh ones, but they're still incredible and very very good. I did actually try the extra moist brisket, and it really wasn't for me. I'm aware that fat makes everything taste better, but I thought it was just a little slimy and I honestly thought it took away some of the flavor, and texture. BUT, that's just me.I haven't really found anyone that's as crazy about their sauce as me. I think it's the most incredible condiment known to man. It's beaten every BBQ sauce I've tried EVER (but salt lick is starting to grow on me). Sometimes I'd just put it on bread and eat it like that. I have actually finished it on my plate with my finger, but I won't get into that. They're sausage is very good too, but I don't think it tastes too much different from other BBQ sausages. I think their turkey is good, but I have found it to be a little dry at times. And their ribs are good as well!Their sides are just as fantastic! I like their creamed corn a lot. Their \\"new/special\\" (I can't remember what they're called) potoates are very buttery but that's what makes them amazing. Be sure to put a little salt on though. And their potatoe salad is amazing!!! ahhhh  However, I'm always going to stick to their brisket, it never lets me down. Rudy's is different when considering their atmosphere. It's a very picnic style type of dining (you eat off a piece of wax paper for gosh sake).

We knew we wanted the signature dish, the lemongrass stuffed game hen, but weren't sure what else to order. I wanted something a little spicy, but not too spicy, and communicated clearly. What we ended up with was a beef dish so spicy i took one bite and was thrown into coughing fits. I took another bite with plenty of rice and it was still too spicy. My dining partner loves spicy food, but no. it was too spicy for him as well. As for the game hen, I didn't know you could make a game hen that dry without trying.

We were seated near the chefs and that was entertaining and special.  The portions were enormous.  Although I don't typically grade a restaurant on portion size (unless the portions are ridiculously small), these portions were large enough to take home and eat for another meal = value.  The prices were super high, and everything was a la carte, but as I just said the portions were immense and most importantly the food was delicious.

Here's what's probably already said: it's big, has a nearly infinite selection of nearly every type of book you could think of, is super-buzzing and busy, and has some of the most cheerful staff you could ever find in a bookstore (and I used to work in a bookstore; one can easily develop as much crust as cheer). But the only way I could not get completely overwhelmed by Powell's was to take it slow. Leave the entrance area as soon as possible - that big direction board just gave me hives. Wander the aisles, especially the sections I'm interested in, but also the ones I'm not, just in case. Get lost in the stacks. Pick up things; no one will bother your browsing. I had certain things \\"to get\\" in mind, but most of what I bought was unexpected, like the copy of Lulu in Hollywood (essays by silent film star Louise Brooks) or Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone. Used copies are shelved alongside new, so I saved a few bucks by looking at the prices on different editions, if available. And yes, I often found multiple editions and copies of books that I had been searching for in Vancouver.   I probably visited only half the store; that's okay, leave some for next time.

I really enjoyed the atmosphere at this location along with the Decour. When we got to the location there were three hostesses at the front door. One of them was very nice and seated us somewhat close to the door she told us the server would take some time so she offered to get us any drinks that we would like. We started to look at the menu and asked her for some advice and she gave us some advice as to what she enjoys at the location. We ended up ordering a ceviche with sushi grade tuna, we ordered a four mushroom flatbread, fried calamari's, and a seafood paella. We also ordered A small picture of sangria that was made with red wine. We were given a warning that the paella would take approximately 45 minutes to be cooked. They also told us there would be no specific order for the dish us to arrive. The first dish that came was the fried calamari's and my boyfriend and I loved it. The sauce was made perfectly and the texture of moisture of the calamari was perfect. Next to sushi grade tuna ceviche came out and we were excited to try it. In my opinion I didn't believe the tuna should have been part of the ceviche. If I were to cook the ceviche with the tuna I would have not smash the tuneup because that releases the moisture from the fish. They also have a live group/band that plays but it is quite loud on a friday. Not a good first date area. Value and price: Ordered small pitcher of Sangria - Glass - 6.00\\nSmall Pitcher - 16.75 (filled about 3.5 glasses, and the glasses were big, so definitely good value here) This will get the party going. CEVICHE DE ATUN* - 11.95\\n(Sliced sushi-grade tuna marinated in garlic, lime, cilantro, jalapefio and onion)  CALAMARES FRITOS - 7.95/14.95 (Dusted and fried squid, lemon, paprika aioli) CHAMPINONES DE SEVILLA - 8.95 (Four types of sauteed mushrooms, sherry, goat cheese, toasted bread). PAELLA VALENCIANA - 32.95 (Lobster, scallops, shrimp, squid, chicken and mild chorizo slowly simmered in saffron rice) To be honest, paella are usually large servings but when this came out the size and portion was very disapointing. I thought it would have been a lot larger given that it was 33 dollars. But its basically the size of an average plate used to feed one. Everything was worthy of the price/value except the paella which I would say is a 2/5 for that dish alone. I would say value is 3.5 or 4/5. Taste: The tuna ceviche had too much lemon juice in here that out-shined the tuna itself. I didnt like it so much. The calamari was good, wish it was hotter, when it came out it was warm. The sauce though was amazing. CHAMPINONES DE SEVILLA is a MUST order. It was delicious. The location also gives you free bread so you can dip the remaining of it in this sauce. It was definitely at 5/5. Paella was great, could have had more of a seafood taste, they shrimp was very fresh, lobster on the small side. Overall taste is 4/5. Service: 3/5 service, wasn't that attentive given that it was not that busy at all. Didn't come to us often to check up.

The portion was enough for 4 people, and I'm not complaining about that. However, the fact that it was charred and dry was a little troubling. The other issue is that it was so dark I couldn't even tell how burned it was until I ate it. After two mouthfuls I set it aside and waited for my steak. My favorite cut of steak is the ribeye, and I had heard good things about Rathbuns cuts. I always order my steaks rare, but was advised the steak would be chewy.

They also have ZERO attitude when it comes to their product, which is such a relief in this town full of hipster coffee snobs.The space is super cute as well, with some bright funky paint on the walls giving it a airy fun vibe, which to me is such a relief from other 3rd wave coffee shops that take themselves WAY too seriously.One last note is that they take charity to the NEXT LEVEL, as they donate 21% of profits to overseas orphanages.

Historical area of Orlando."},{"name":"Barlow","address":"737 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I seldom write reviews unless I feel particularly moved by an experience - good or bad. And SORRY in advance but this one turned out to be pretty long. Unfortunately I've had 2 mediocre experiences here and one negative expereince. This is a huge let down to me, because I LOVE the space & location, enjoy Picnic House, and love the art deco theme here. All of these things could've combined to be a truly fabulous bar but after giving it a handful of chances, I am still disappointed in my experiences here. On Friday night, my friend and I arrived around 10:10pm when they were only moderately busy -- I would say \\"slow\\" by comparison to other downtowns bars/restaurants. Anyway, we found a seat immediately and after a few minutes received water and menus. The man waiting on our section must have leisurely walked by our table a total of 10-12 times before even glancing at us again. I kept my eye out because we were anxious to get our first beverage of the evening & a snack, and this took ESPECIALLY long. He was not hustling to attend to other tables who were there before us, so there was no clear reason that he was too distracted to take our order. At ~10:35, I raised my voice to ask \\"Can we please order?\\" he came over, I asked about food, and was informed that we'd just missed the cutoff for the happy hour food menu by a few minutes. Of course. Next, while waiting for our drinks to arrive, an acquaintance of the same waiter sits at the table next to us and *immediately* gets their order put it in and -- what do you know -- their cocktails came out a few minutes before ours did. A different waitress brings our cocktails, we drink within 15 minutes, and do our best to order again quickly while we have their attention. After another several minutes, someone new comes to check on us and \\"get drinks started.\\" We let her know that we ordered 2 drinks several minutes ago, and even though it has gotten a little busier, we wonder if our second round of drinks were forgotten about. (That seemed likely since our table seemed to have so many different people checking in.) She says they are on the way, and around 11:30 we received our second round of drinks for the night. Meanwhile, sometime after we'd already ordered that 2nd round of drinks, a wedding after-party arrived and sat in a reserved area. Some of the guests came over to order at the bar, and seemed to get drinks and walk back to that table before our drinks made it to us. All of this is not to say that Barlow is 100% awful -- I really had wished this & other experiences had gone differently, because it is such a promising establishment. They need to delineate their service areas between servers more clearly, because perhaps if one server was taking care of the same handful of tables, each and every table would get what they'd asked for in an efficient manner. As someone who has been in and around the service industry for 13 years, all I can really conclude from my three negative experiences here is that Barlow does not have their service figured out. Including myself and 4-5 peers I've spoken to, customers are not leaving satisfied and there's quite a bit lacking from the experience here. Yes, the d√©cor is beautiful, and yes, they have fantastic drinks, but service is random and servers do not seem to be in-tune with the fact that this is not a pleasant experience. I politely voiced my concerns that night about how long my *two different* drink orders were taking, and not once did I receive an apologetic or kind response. On a night when things are only a \\"normal level of busy,\\" the poor service and unconcerned attitudes just baffle me."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Amazing selection of books!

The restaurant looks to be an old house, so the buffet is set up in a couple of different rooms. It helps with the lines at each station, but you still end up bobbing and weaving through people to move to your seat/to the next room as the rooms are not huge.

The first time was \\"Tapas Tuesday\\" I believe. First off, let me state how much I loved the tapenade they brought to our table with bread. I would love to buy it in bulk. From there it was mostly downhill. The albondigas (meatballs) are acceptable (ok, but nothing you'd look forward to ordering. The ham croquettes were as expected. The salmon tapas I had was amazing. I am not a fan of cooked salmon, and this blew me out of the water. BUT. The service was terrible. Truly. It took my friend and I almost 2 hours to get out of there. 15-20 minutes of eating, The rest was waiting for the waiter. Did I mention I didn't get one refill the entire time I was there? So about a half hour to get our drinks from being seated, and over an hour of hoping he cared to stop by to refill, which by that point we were happy to get our check so we could leave.Today's visit was worse. First the claim they don't have tapenade but pesto for the table, and have never had tapenade (or anything like that). Ok, sure, one of your high points never existed, I'll roll with it. The pesto that comes to the table is tolerable. I have a much review-praised sangria. Very very dry. This time I try the Tartaros (tuna tartar), very pleased. As I'm eating, my family and I watch the center tapas preparer (cuts sausages, and cheeses at a station in open view in middle) as he cuts some food, stops, uses same knife to cut open an envelope which I can only assume holds his paycheck, looks at it, and goes back to cutting meats. Hmmm. ok. Then later we watch as he is cutting and cleaning what looks like raw squid or octopus, then immediately places that knife unwiped into a holding area with all the other knives (which he uses to directly cut previously mentioned meats and cheeses meant directly for serving). All the while we have to hope a pray that our waitress remembers us. Almost a total of one hour spent today waiting on our waitress for drinks, food and check. Cut forward to 2 hours later, and one of my family has already managed to get physically ill (most polite way I can say expunged her food).Nice atmosphere, has had a couple of perks, but can not overcome service, prices, and the fear of hygiene practices and those subsequent consequences."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Little known fact: Torchys is the name of the owners dog that caught on fire during a horrific taco experiment.\\nGreat food, friendly people, delicious vegetarian choices.

The service was friendly and the atmosphere as warm and cheerful as before.My friends and I shared three appetizers and three pastas, and it was a hefty amount of food.  The shrimp scampi was as delicious as it was at lunch, and we also tried the mussels and a small order of fried calamari.  The mussels were the weak link.  I didn't find them particularly fresh or well flavored.  The \\"small\\" mountain of calamari, on the other hand, was great.  Crispy breading, springy squid, and a nice marinara sauce.We only tried one new pasta as I loved the two I had before, and it was the least appealing.  This was the linguini with scallop in red sauce, and while it was tasty, it wasn't memorable, and I tired of the sauce.  The black pasta aglio olio and white linguini with clams were phenomenal.  I would eat them both often despite the heavy amount of garlic and grease.We washed down our dinner house with an affordable bottle of the house chianti, which we drank out of plastic cups.  It was an intimate meal with splendid food, and I'll try to make it back to Daily Catch whenever I find myself in Boston."},{"name":"Roam Innovative Workplace: Dunwoody","address":"1155 Mount Vernon Hwy NE, Ste 800","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"(+)\\nProbably won't find a more sophisticated/trendy spot to work on the go.\\nFriendly staff that shows personal interest.

Given the location and the menu I understand why it is the way it is. As someone who grew up with a Vietnamese family, the pho didn't look or seem appetizing at all. You're essentially paying for the convenience of not having to drive to Buford Highway to get the proper and cheaper pho/Vietnamese food. A medium bowl would be considered a xs/small in other places and at Pho Dai Viet, it was twice the price sitting at a hefty $12 for a \\"you pick 3\\" meats and they didn't even have tendon. The beef in the beef stew that I got was incredibly large and tough to chew. The soup lacked flavor and had absolutely no trace of spice. The pork chops were good and the rice was alright.

Korean BBQ.So this wasn't my first experience with Korean BBQ, but it was my first inside the US.  I studied abroad in Hong Kong, China and had some off the hook Korean BBQ experiences in Asia.Hae Woon Dae, I gotta say, was pretty awesome itself though.  After checking the reviews on Yelp (how else are you supposed to know which Korean place to go to on Buford Hwy without Yelp's expert quidance?), we geared up for a new taste bud experience.  My date hadn't tried Korean BBQ before and since I'd never done it in Atlanta, we let the waitress who came to take our order guide us.She highlighted the beef and the BBQ pork as being two of the most popular dishes.  We agreed (why wouldn't she know best?) and the wheels were set in motion.  The first thing that happened was a man came around with a hot bucket of coals which were placed in the brazier in the middle of our table (the BBQ part) and a grill was placed over that where the meat would grill.Then our original waitress returned with a bowl full of large lettuce leaves and a tray of Korean goodies that would go alone or on top of the meat once it was cooked: kimchi (naturally), turnip in hot sauce, preserved fish (odd, but tasty), bean sprouts, potatoes in curry, sesame paste, garlic and peppers and a few other little dishes plus their version of barbeque sauce (sweeter and more liquid than American sauces, but perfect for dipping the meat in).  Next came the meat.  She reappeared with a plate full of raw beef and raw pork marinated in their own special rub of spices.  And all of it went sliding onto the searing hot grill.  After one side was cooked, she returned, tongs in hand, and expertly flipped the meat to cook all the way then came back once more, divvied the meat up between our plates, showed us how to use the lettuce leaves (if we chose) to hold meat, sauce, and whatever toppings we might choose, and left us to fend for ourselves.Cool!  Eat with you hands, eat with your chopsticks - whichever.  We did a little of both, and I'll warn you up front, it will get messy.  Use those napkins and don't be afraid to ask for more.  Also, don't expect to look dignified as a piece of kimchi in your lettuce leaf hits you on the chin as you take a bite.  It's great fun, but not clean fun - messy fun.We didn't stand a chance at finishing it all off, but no matter, we did it justice.  And quite enjoyed it too.  After we were finished, our waitress brought the check and two really large slices of orange to cleanse the palate.  Great first American Korean BBQ experience for me.  Different from what I'd done in Hong Kong, to be sure, but still very good.  Well done Hae Woon Dae, well done."},{"name":"Maple Street Biscuit Company - Oviedo","address":"978 City Plaza Way","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"So being a biscuit restaurant I had to try it out.

I'm a sushi/Asian food lover and have had this kind of food in a ton of different places, and I think Mint2Thai isn't bad at all. It's located just a 2min drive from Emory, so I've been here a few times. (Bonus for Emory students: show your Emory ID and get a free delicious Thai iced tea!)The inside is actually very clean, well-decorated and has plenty of seating. It's a nice place for a casual sit-down dinner. The staff is very attentive and friendly, although can be very slow if you don't ask directly for something.The first time, my friend found a Groupon for a ginormous sushi boat. She and my other friend split the sushi boat, and I decided to try the Prik King, a type of Thai dish with string beans (my favorite). I thought the flavor of my dish was really good, and it was a sizable portion. They gave rice on the side, so I had a perfect mix of flavorful Prik King and slightly sticky jasmine rice--just how I like my rice. My friends fully enjoyed their sushi. There was a wide selection of sushi and sashimi, all of which seemed pretty well made. Between the 2 of them, they finished almost he entire boat!The second time I came for sushi. I ordered 2 rolls, which came in about 15-20min. Not bad since we were a party of 4 and it seemed like there were only a couple sushi chefs. The sushi tasted pretty standard in my opinion. Nothing special, but not bad at all. The pricing is standard too. I would recommend this place for a quick sushi fix if you're shopping in one if the surrounding shopping centers (better than Yami Sushi). However, if you're looking for quality sushi at just as affordable of a price, I recommend Sushi Matsuya in the Toco Hills Shopping Center, which is just a ~5min drive away.

I was advised it is small, medium and large.  Ok - why doesn't it just say that!The menu has pictures, but it is not representative of the item ordered! The words were their dialect but half in theirs and half English. If it was all one non-English menu board, then I'd understand I needed to ask, but the way it's presented it's as if I should know what it means. An explanation in English under the strange term would be helpful.Building the donair - she asked if I wanted everything and I said yes but nothing hot.  So, I got all the regular veggies and feta cheese and tzatziki sauce, she took the donair to the back to get the chicken. Fine.I also ordered the chicken platter combo.  Since there was no description of what exactly a platter combo was, I assumed (never assume) since it was under the chicken donair menu, it would include a donair, a salad and a drink.  WRONG.  Apparently it means pita on the side, rice topped with strange tasting chicken (I'm not sure if it is supposed to taste that way or if it was having an off day - I'm not fluent in Persian spices, so I won't critique other than it tasted like a dry dirty sock). lettuce with one slice of tomato, two very thinly sliced cucumber, one hot something, and something pink that I didn't try.  It also came with a white yogurt dollop and what I think was hummus.She said for me to pick out a drink, so I did.We sat at the table and she brought it out for us. The tables seemed clean, and the chairs were newer.  The table cloth was under glass, but with the overhang being brownish lace-ish, hard to tell if it was clean or not.After we finished our unusual meal (we felt like we'd experienced a new cuisine, so were ok with the food even though we didn't enjoy it - we usually LOVE donairs - but not from this place) I was prepared to give a tip.  I estimated the price to be $7 for the small chicken donair, $11 for the chicken platter combo so $18 plus tax and I'd give a 20 and a 2 tip. (fast food places don't usually require tipping even if seating is provided).I was told the price was $22.10   I asked how so?  She said we ordered a drink and we had cheese.  SERIOUSLY?  A combo means drink included does it not?! She said no, it means you get everything on their tray. Drink is extra.When she said to pick out a drink, it was implied it was included in our meal.

I think this place is good, but like other places (Toro Bravo I'm looking at you) I don't think you're missing anything earth shattering if you decide you don't want to wait 45 minutes for a seat.

The Goddess was topped with their Nama Shoyu dressing..zesty, refreshing, and so darn good.  I'm excited to try out their wraps and salads as well.As for the juice - I ordered the Life Alive.  It was made fresh, but to me, definitely is not worth the close to 6 bucks I chalked up.  Now I'm no expert on freshly squeezed juices - I rarely get them - but it was disturbingly warm, which may very well be just how you're supposed to serve them.

The drinks came out and the potato skins right after - covered in bacon. Our waitress was so apologetic she had them do up another on the fly. They came out AND WERE STILL FROZEN!

Finally a manager comes over finds the ticket and apologizes . See they take a card for authorization at the beginning and they charged us for the potato skins. The manager apologized took off the potato skins and discounted the pizza /flatbread thing. Aw great we want to tip the waitress. He says sure no problem.Today I checked my account the original 53 dollar charge is there and the amended charge is also there WITHOUT the waitresses tip!!! So I tried to call there telephone number to correct the amount processed and make sure this waitress gets her tip! I cannot reach them if you press three it hangs up on you. No one answers any of the other lines and now I'm probably going to have to do a charge back and figure out a way to get a tip to the amazing waitress.. while the price was alluring the service fell short of even average.

The shop's owner, AJ, was one of the owners of the former Taj Mahal restaurant that served delicious Indian food for many years near campus, and he brings a unique menu, with delicious Indian nuances, to the downtown lunch options. The menu includes traditional lunch items such as turkey wraps and cobb salads, and at first it might appear to be an ordinary sandwich shop.  Oh, but it isn't.  Look closer and you'll see inventive dishes that are both delicious and healthy (and some vegetarian).  AJ's offers a spinach salad with mixed berries and bacon;  a lentil salad with hearts of palm and a smoked tomato vinaigrette;  not to mention a side salad of chickpeas, tomatoes, and jalape√±os that you can \\"grab and go\\" for $1.95.   Some of the sandwich options show AJ's flair for Indian cooking.  The \\"Raja Wrap\\" is filled with Tandoori chicken, onions, peppers, and a cilantro chutney.  A vegetarian option, the \\"Spiced Chickpea Wrap\\" has spinach, cumin-spiced chickpeas, tomatoes, and a tamarind chutney.  AJ's daily soups sometimes have traditional Indian flavors, as well, made with lentils, chickpeas, garam-masala spiced chicken, and spinach.  As soon as you walk through the door, the delicious smells of the spices will tell you that this is not a typical sandwich shop, but a real destination for downtown foodies.  For all of its deliciousness, AJ's is modestly priced.  Most items will set you back about $7 for a full-sized entree, with some of the vegetarian options coming in at a mere $5.99.  You can't pack a lunch at home for that!  If you're in a hurry, you can quickly pick up any of the menu items to carry out and take back to your office -- AJ will get you out the door fast.   If you're not in a hurry, you can relax in a lovely little dining room with bright, colorful paintings on the walls, and even visit with the shop's owner, AJ, who will show the same warm, gracious hospitality that he showed to his guests for many years at the beloved Taj Mahal restaurant on campus.

No big deal at all but it was not a comfortable waiting area (outdoor and windy) which definitely would have been a bummer had it been raining. As the other reviewers are saying there are only 6 tables here and so the wait can be hefty.THE FOOD: I saw this place on foodnetwork's diner, drive-ins, and dives and the biscuits and gravy inspired my trek. They were DELICIOUS! They are pictured in the photo's and were really good.  The gravy was a tiny bit sweet and had huge hunks of sausage. The rosemary aroma was very strong but I love rosemary so no problem. The \\"sweet potato\\" portion of the biscuit was lost, however, under the gravy and pork and I was sorta sad about that UNTIL I had the brilliant idea of saving half the biscuit to eat with jam and then OH YES it was good. They're dense and soft and tasty. The jam... it was superb! Homeade raspberry jam.. I guess everything there is homeade. Even the ketchup came out in a little pot and was presented to us as \\"house made.\\" The ketchup was pretty good but tasted more like cocktail sauce ..which is fine by me as I like horseradish. HOWEVER, I am just a poor suburban un-hip type person and I had no clue that in hip places you would be charged for jam and ketchup and was surprised to see $1.00 added to my bill (I think for each but definitely for the jam). No big deal as I had not come there to save money but I it was a first for me. When I looked at the menu (after I came home and before I wrote this review) I noticed that there were a few dishes you could add eggs to. I wish this would have been listed as an option (or I had thought of it myself!) for the biscuits and gravy. I would have enjoyed a side of over easy yolky goodness to go with the my order. The only downer of the dish was the \\"library fries.\\" They were just quartered potato's (perhaps red) that were likely roasted and very brown on the outside but dry as all get out on the inside with no flavor at all. I was very surprised that they missed this opportunity considering all the depth of flavor they seem to enjoy creating in their other dishes. My husband had the semolina pancakes. I'm not a pancake person but these were quite tasty and had a quite a bit of crispy edging which I REALLY enjoy. It came with a lovely, large side of fresh fruit that hadn't been mangled in any way. Almost a little too unmangled as it looked like the same thing I make every weekend for my family. Chopped apples, oranges, banana, and one large berry. It was hearty though.. definitely not a garnish. My husband ordered a side of library fries and was also not impressed with them. I didn't get much of the organic syrup but I heard it was tasty. I want to go back and try some more things.. the lunch looks yummy and the baked goods looked sublime. The service was good and the servers were SO FRIENDLY.

Maybe it was just a bad night, but since it has always been good before, I walked away disappointed this time.

In a world that is consumed by what is the latest and greatest on the internet; Powell's seems to defy the notion that books are the past.  Depending where in the store you stand; time can fly by or slow to a halt. As a fan of classical literature, Ancient Greek and Latin, that section is harrowed by shelves, dimly lit, quieter, much like an old library. Tomes of darkly aged bindings, scatter the shelves, mixed with modern translations.  You get a sense that even is the age of new, the old stands apart, with dignity,  I think that's what makes Powell's a gem, the dignity that they give to every book. Books are first class citizens, they are highlighted, showcased, preserved and stocked in ways that show respect to the authors.  Even with the tangle of floors and the color coded madness; losing your way is a blessing; because you might discover a section of the store that you perhaps would never have ventured.  There are book lovers out there, casual readers, and everyone in between; even if you walk out of the store without purchasing a book, I believe you will find inspiration to seek knowledge or furthermore understanding... and isn't that what books are for?"},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Stayed here due to a presentation I did at this location, very nice hotel, beautiful location, nice pools, rooms are roomy and clean, humongous tv, nice views.

There were indoor seating, but also had a few tables in a tent like space with heating lamps above us (thank god cause it was pretty chilly). We got seated fairly quickly and the waiter came to us with water (which tasted like rice infused water).

The waiter here were so informative about the foods that they serve and answered all our questions (cause that menu is so extensive!)We heeded his advice and got the wings to share. We opted for the mild options, which had a fish sauce taste. It was crispy on the outside and just the right texture on the inside. It was great. Next, my friend and I shared the kung op wun sen (which is a claypot with pork belly, noodles, shrimp and much more). It was pretty filling for its size and we both enjoyed it.

And my friend was a willing accomplice, so we ordered the small calamari appetizer and a broiled fish dish (comes with pasta or salad - so we chose the salad to add a bit of green to our dinner) to go with the black pasta, and we held off from the bread basket to save room for dinner.The calamari consisted of rings and tentacles, fried a light golden and served with a wedge of lemon and some tomato sauce.  Nice and light, but somewhat chewy rather than crispy.  Okay, but not great.  However, a good portion for two.The salad arrived - a small dish of greens, carrots, cucumbers, red peppers, dressed with a balsamic vinegar dressing - I enjoyed the flavor of the dressing and the crispness of the veggies, but would had preferred a larger portion.  The fish soon followed - a breadcrumby filet - very nice color and fresh and tasty.The three pastas were all prepared al dente.  Nice chunks of veggies in the Puttanesca.  The Alfredo was very creamy cheesy.  And oh, the garlic wafting from the Aglio Olio and the bits of ground squid - yeah, that was my favorite, followed by the Alfredo.It seems they now offer dessert (although I don't know if it did before), but we found out as we were walking out the door, so it was too late to stay to sample their wares...Okay, this place is a little pricey to me, but due to the wonderful service we received from the waitress, I figured it rated an extra star."},{"name":"360 Pizza","address":"2712 Bee Caves Rd, Ste 106","city":"Rollingwood","stars":"4","text":"AWSOME THE BEST OF THE BEST my delivery guy is usually some tall gentleman and is so nice and always has my order right , always can count on him with the pepper and parmesan"},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I came here for my birthday and it was pretty fun.

Since then, I've eaten at Morton's in San Francisco, San Diego, Portland and Seattle.  With the exception of Seattle, they have been hands down, a five star dining experience.  We go, for very special occasions, simply because of the cost.  For the two of us, it usually run, with tip, 130 dollars for dinner.  We might make it once a year.  But when we do find a bit of extra coin in our pocket, enough to warrant making a night of it at Morton's, it's the best steak experience ever.  I've eaten at Ruth Chirs in San Francisco and they had nothing on Morton's.  I almost always get the Filet Mignon (a steak of this magnitude on the taste scale must be capitalized), mashed potatoes, salad and for desert, the chocolate souffl√©.   You have to order it in advance, because it takes about 45 minutes to prepare, so know in ahead of time if you are craving the delicacy of souffl√©.  The steaks all run about 30 to 50 dollars.  They have chicken and fish, but really, why bother.  I can't eat steak at a place like Outback after eating here, because what's the point.  You're only going to be disappointed.

Commonwealth is an odd hodgepodge that kind of looks cool but delivers no substance. The food is fine but not great.  It  is largely bland and uninteresting and plainly the restaurant is hoping the grocery atmosphere will convince diners that the bland food is made of ingredients sufficiently fresh/organic that they should overlook its general mediocrity.  Where it really falls down is service. We arrived and the waiter took forever to take the drink order. When he did it took forever to get the drinks. After 15 minutes he stopped by and said the drinks would be coming soon. He seemed surprised when it was suggested he take the food order given the long wait for drinks because plainly one cannot do that until the drinks come and if they never do then well, who knows. He took the food order and disappeared for a while. Seeing others get bread we asked another waiter (ours had disappeared into some dimension where bad waiters go) for bread. He seemed surprised (for good reason) we hadn't been given bread. So then another waiter came and said here is the \\"additional\\" bread you asked for as if, geez you guys can really pack down the bread!  Additional?  Of course the bread came with no butter. Our confused waiter came by after a while and offered to refill my drink and I said sure. He then disappeared again for 10 minutes and when I saw him again I said didn't you ask me if I wanted a refill? He looked puzzled and said yes. I said, didn't I say yes?  And he agreed,  He then walked away confused and came back long after with the drink. Next, another waiter came with our main dishes but none of the 4 side dishes we had ordered.  He asked, if there was anything else he could get us and we replied how bout the side dishes? He seemed confused by that request. Then the original waiter came back and declared he forgot to put any of the 4 side dishes in. He wasn't so much regretful about this odd lapse as bemused. He seemed totally vacant  while declaring that all 4 side dishes he had written down on the same piece of paper as  the main dishes had somehow not gotten to the cook as if wow, wasn't it kind of odd that could happen.  After an incredulous look he did offer them for free and when they finally came, long after the main dishes were done, they were bland and uninspired. We got the check and it was surprising how much it was given that we were not charged for any of the bland side dishes.  This restaurant is nothing more than a novelty In a town starved for novelty.

With all three of our orders, one small covered pot of steamed rice was brought out.

Such a nice guy.)"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place was suggested by our friend since we were visiting Portland for the day. Their chicken wings were amazing! One of the best ones I've had. Another one we tried was their pork belly curry! It's in this little pot bubbling with goodness sauce that's amazing to soak my rice with and eat with the soft and juicy pork belly!

Rather than being casual and cheap, this place is quite classy and cozy.  Many dishes range in the mid to high teens with certain main dishes topping out in the low 20s in terms of price.\\n\\nSERVICE: A little bit slow since there is only one server for the entire restaurant (which seats about 25, I would guess).  Very friendly, funny, and flattering service overall though.  The man insisted that I was a returning customer, though it was my very first time there.  \\"Really?  You look like a celebrity, and you seem to be so comfortable being here!\\"\\n\\nFOOD AND DRINKS: We only ordered main dishes, no appetizers.  All the portions were very large but serviceable for one person still.  The Melkha (vegetarian: stuffed eggplant over couscous) was a really tasty medley of vegetables and flavors.  The Melfouf la Kasbah featured some really interesting meats, including one very gamey sausage.  Definitely could taste the harissa on the plate, so yum.  The M'Katef comes with 3 fair-sized lamb chops (had 'em cooked medium).  Very delicately marinated was an accurate menu description.  The mint sauce had a nice balance.  The house special chicken and rice dish was an abundantly flavorful dish, though a bit heavy on the olives.  For the table, we shared a pitcher of the house specialty drink Cherbat, which is an Algerian-style lemonade.  Our glasses were the trendy mason jars.\\n\\nAMBIENCE: Mix of small tables with seats and pillowed benches.  Very subdued lighting, intimate private feel.  You can make a reservation here for a small party, probably no more than 8 on a slow night.  The restaurant itself is away from the hustle and bustle of Mass Ave, so you are quite near the residential space when coming to Baraka."},{"name":"Comella's","address":"417 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been dreaming about Comella's Excellent Eggplant Parmigiana in their Mess format (a mixture of yes, mushrooms, sauce, bell peppers, and pasta)! It's so good, it's in my daydreams along with my Honey (daydreams I won't go into here, as they will probably embarrass her)... But, let me tell you, if you like sweet tomato sauce (like Trader Joe's only better), this is the daydream for you!  Mmmm! I'm hungry right now, thinking of it! It also comes as a huge sandwich.\\n\\nAll of their portions are huge for the price. Comella's is a great deal: perfect for a large group. The single portion Mess easily equals 2 dinners.\\n\\nNote: This is definitely a take-out kind of place as there is no sense of atmosphere; you can also get frozen orders for later; great for family dinners. Parking isn't bad in this part of Brookline (it's metered, street parking, free after 6, I think). And, yes, they take credit cards."},{"name":"Jerusalem Cafe","address":"516 SE Chkalov Dr, Ste 45","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!\\ni was looking forward to satisfying my craving for Mediterranean food and hospitality but completely lost my appetite with awful food & terrible service.

The husband loves Ramen and I thought I will give it a try... We went on a weekday evening at 7 and it was fully packed.. I would reserve if I go a weekend night... Packed houses are always promising.. We ordered the pan fried gyoza, chicken karage and veggie Ramen...the pan fried gyoza was good, the chicken karage was ok.. I am not a big fan of huge chunks of chicken.. So I ended up barely tasting it and they were gracious to not include it in the bill... Coming to the Ramen, it was a complete hit...

Definitely give this place a shot."},{"name":"Me Too!","address":"16755 SW Baseline Rd, Ste 102","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I like this place. Good service, nice concept, decent food. I am writing this from the perspective of someone with a 1 and 3 year old, though. So keep that in mind.\\n\\nThe play area is isolated. In other words, there is a wall that separates kids from the parents. I think this is great for those with independent older kids. However, when your little one wants to run out and see mommy often, it hinders the enjoyment for everyone who wants a quiet meal. I felt a little self-conscious about it.\\n\\nSo, I think it's a wonderful concept...but I think it is perfect for a slightly older kid or for very independent little ones."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Small dive Italian and seafood restaurant.

The wait was about 1 hour and 40 minutes.  I think it was worth it but if you don't have time I would recommend coming during the day and to bring something to do (like reading yelp reviews).  My girlfriend and I shared our dishes and we got.\\n\\n1 - little neck clams appetizer.  It was 10/10 for both me and my girlfriend.  The broth was so tasty (garlic lemony thyme goodness) we were sad when she took it away but we had run out of bread so it was okay.\\n\\n2 - monkfish Marsala was interesting.  It was well cooked and the fish melts in your mouth.  There was a sweet and nutty sauce (which was cool but too sweet for my gf) which was new.  8/10\\n\\n3 - black pasta aglio olio which was good. The noodles were al dente, the dish was served in a pan so you can scrape it for squidy goodness.  The calamari was not overwhelming and the sauce was great (garlic herbs and olive oil) and the flavor was subtle but memorable. 9/10\\n\\nRalphie was a GREAT cook.  He even came outside to tell us the wait.  The place was really popular and people had to be turned away at a certain point.  We were the 2nd to last group allowed in.  The service was great.  The wait was short once inside, and after our meal Ralphie even gave us a free pastry from mikes across the street.  All in all a great place that will certainly not be forgotten.
