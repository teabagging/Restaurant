It wasn't busy at all. \\n\\nThe ikura (salmon eggs), tasted clumpy and not fresh. Also, I absolutely hate when those get decorated by little pieces of greenery in the salmon eggs. I rarely see that, but when I do I always feel like something is being hidden. Like they use it to modify the taste to hide the lack of freshness. The salmon sashimi was very average. Only four pieces in an order too. Felt skimpy. The spicy scallop roll, was not so spicy and rather dry. The sweet shrimp didn't have that \\"tanginess\\" I am used to. And the fried heads were cold when I bit into them. Finally the Japanese Ceviche dish felt gimmicky. Didn't taste Japanese and didn't taste  Baja Mexican. Not sure what it was supposed to be. \\n\\nThe 80's soft rock contributed to my annoyance with the place. As did the fact they didn't have a the typical sushi checklist to turn in. I might have even ordered more if they had that. The waiter had to slowly write everything down we wanted and then go over it with me. Had to confirm I didn't want the ikura sashimi - huh? Get me a spoon! Or sweet shrimp sashimi. People order this usually over the nigiri? He also felt a need to correct my pronunciation of ikura, one gaijin to another. Whatever. So, I accented the wrong syllable. Maybe my friend and our resident sushi/Japanese expert Vidor H will come along and scold me later too.

Several people had a bite of my friend's steak and they all liked it. For dessert, there was a beautifully presented dessert with a chocolate Mickey in the middle. I only tried the key lime pie and it was tasty. As for atmosphere: well, it's the kind if place that you don't have to worry if your kids are a little unsettled, but somehow not mind-numbingly noisy. Service was slow, but they did bring out the kids' food quickly. If you don't have children and don't want to be surrounded by them at dinner (this is usually the case for us), I wouldn't venture near, but it's a great place for families."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Disappointed with the quality of pastry and cappuccino...I won't stop there again..I have ordered a napoleon and cappuccino...the cream seemed to be old and too thick.. just disappointed and would NOT recommend this shop for quality and freshness..thank you"},{"name":"Tropical Cuisine","address":"4899 Old National Hwy","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"So I have to finally give Tropical Cuisine it's 5 star rating.

I made reservations 180 days out, like I had with all of them and decided to go for lunch since I'd heard dinner was hard to get and it was more expensive. We had one of the first reservations in the morning and that worked out great for us since we didn't have to wait long to be called. Before you enter in the morning, they do a singing of the Canadian anthem, which we thought was kind of cool. They seat you in different regions of Canada, they say, as the living room is spead out into regions. I think we were in Quebec. \\n\\nWe started off with drinks and appetizers, the cheese soup being mine (YUMMMMM!!!!!!) and the sausage appetizer being my hubby's. Both were absolutely delicious. They also brought out three different types of breads, the pretzel bread being the best. I will tell you, dipping the pretzel bread into that soup was like a slice of heaven! For entrees, I got the mushroom filet, which was sooooo good, although a little on the small side, probably because it was lunch time. My hubby got the New York Strip I believe and he liked it. We got the baked mac and cheese and poutine as sides (poutine was HUGE!) and everything tasted delicious. Since we had mentioned we were celebrating a honeymoon, our waitress brought us a champagne toast at the end of our dinner, which was a nice little touch! It was waaaaaay too much food, since the actual entrees come with small sides themselves.. oops, but we had tons of leftovers for dinner and the next day.\\n\\nI'd definitely recommend this place.

This particular one though, awful.  It scored low in just about every category a restaurant can, wait staff, food quality / quantity, interior design, general company, any others I should mention?\\n\\nTo start with the wait staff, they were completely ridiculous.  The waiter that we had among other things introduced himself three times, which I can understand maybe hes a little stressed, but I think we were the only people there that werent a) old, or b) swarming with children, so a little easier to spot.  Im pretty sure he introduced himself, we ordered drinks, then he came, introduced himself again, asked for our drinks again...and so on.  Another waitress woman we saw slinking by our table was carrying some plates to another table and proceeded to wipe her nose on her arm WHILE carrying the plates still.\\n\\nAs for the food quality vs. quantity, all of the dishes are basically colored styrofoam in a pile with awful crunchy rice.  I ordered Orange Chicken that was in my opinion way too orange visually and taste-wise and piled high on top of some undercooked rice.  As for the edamame (soy beans), dont EVER order them, they were so overcooked the pods fell apart, for those of you who enjoy edamame, thats NOT supposed to happen!\\n\\nOne quick last thing, the interior is a disaster, its like early Egyptian / Greco-Roman / Rennaissance / Baroque / Art Deco and a melange of other perhaps Cheesecake Factory-invented styles.\\n\\nOverall, awful!

The meatballs and knots are probably my favorite food combination in recent memory as far as the Orlando food scene goes. These two dishes hold up well when delivered via Uber Eats as well. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the few times I've had their pizzas, I felt that there was room for improvement. I tried the KBar and the Crimson Ghost. Don't get me wrong, they were decent pies but they didn't match the level of flavor explosiveness as the knots and meatballs. The crust was a little soggy and the pizzas were a little small for being in the $16 range. None of this is a deal breaker though. These were only 2 experiences that I've had with their pizzas.

The bed, pillows, and linens were incredible, and I slept like a baby, which I almost never do outside of my own home. The virtual concierge service was a really cool feature that let me request things like room location, extra towels, early check-in, etc., and all requests were honored and at the ready when I arrived. And you really can't beat the location. Lots to do within steps of the hotel, and even more from within steps of the Prudential Center and Copley Place, which is great when dealing with harsh weather (it was upper 90s for the duration of my stay, so I was grateful for this). All of the service personnel were really nice too.. the concierge staff in particular was sweet and helpful with every request (including hunting all over for a scissors that would cut through a particularly tenacious tag from a recent purchase). Additionally, I was there for a conference, and the chairs were really comfortable, which might not seem like a big deal, but spending three consecutive 8+ hour days in them, I was really grateful for it. \\n\\nThe meh: the decor outside of the rooms left a little something to be desired. It was fine, but definitely a little dated, and the way the entry into the hotel is situated, it feels kind of like you're going to stay in a parking ramp. I will admit, my heart sank a little when the taxi pulled up. The quality of the room itself more than made up for it, don't get me wrong, but a little polish on the hotel's public spaces would go a long way. And the kind of stale, climate-controlled scent was pretty pervasive throughout the facility. I also think that the wi-fi was pretty expensive. The aforementioned conference I was attending comped mine, but I definitely had a little sticker shock when I saw what I would be paying otherwise. \\n\\nThe bad: my only real complaint was the amount of time the elevators took. Unless I was coming in late at night, or leaving early, I had to account for a good five minutes of standing at the elevator for the upper floors (sometimes more).  \\n\\nI would definitely stay here again!"},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great experience!

I think this would bring in a wider audience instead of focusing on only those with a steel stomach. Next up the Mac n cheese, tho good it needs a touch of salt and a bit less grease. They use real cheese which is definitely a thumbs up in my book but you can't just melt cheese on noodles, it needs spices. On to the cabbage slaw, this was a very cool take on traditional coleslaw. My only minor complaint was that it didn't have enough of that signature sauce on it. A little more please! Lastly the sweet tea. I've had tons of different versions of sweet tea, some awesome some terrible, this one fell on my lower scale. I understand Ohio doesn't get what sweet tea is so I give the patrons a tiny bit of slack on this one. But the owner (stating southern roots) should know that southern sweet tea is so sweet it makes you pucker after the first sip. With that I feel it needs tons more sugar.

I won't go into the room quality since that's already covered by other reviews and the hotel is aware and working on it.  However, the customer service I would like to review.  The communication we received in the months prior to the wedding was great, but when things went wrong so did the customer service.\\n\\nWe worked with the hotel months in advance to use the hotel bar for our after wedding party but when I checked in on Friday (our wedding was the next day), the hotel employee I was working with informed me that the bar had been demolished the Tuesday prior.  This left us to scramble the day before our wedding to find an alternative location for our wedding party.  Not OK at all for anyone who knows what it's like to have a wedding.  My question was: why were we not given the decency of being informed at the latest on Tuesday when the demo began that the bar was no longer available? It still would have sucked, but at least we would've had a few days to deal with the unexpected.  The floods happened, I get that, but common courtesy should still be expected.\\n\\nThey offered us a solution by saying we could use another much smaller bar area, but we found out that bar was also offered to 2 other conferences and possibly a bar mitzvah.  Clearly that wouldn't have worked to fit our entire wedding party and 3 other large events.  I give the hotel credit for giving us a great deal on another solution by allowing us to rent one of their banquet rooms. But I'm fairly certain that's due to my sister-in-law who has a way of getting things done :)\\n\\nFinally, our bill was somewhat of a mess.  Charges were unclear and I had difficultly getting answers on what was what.  In the end, they just stopped responding to me and I still am unclear on a few charges.  At this point, I'm just letting it go.\\n\\nMy basic feeling from the hotel is that they weren't fully upfront with us.  They weren't upfront that the example room we were shown wasn't representative of the entire hotel room quality.  They weren't upfront with the demolition of the bar.  They weren't upfront with the fact that other parties were also offered to share the already small alternative bar space.\\n\\nIn all, everything worked out, no major disasters happened and we had a blast, but I will never stay at that hotel nor will I recommend anyone else to stay there.  I understand that the hotel is on the inexpensive side and you get what you pay for, but for a wedding, this isn't the hotel.

My only concern is that the place was empty when we visited and I really don't want them to go out of business. \\n\\nPros: \\n\\nFood - I made the mistake of ordering twice as much as I needed to. The rolls are HUGE, which is why they are $10-11, as opposed to $5-6. So, order accordingly. I recommend the Diablo roll and the Heart Attack app, based on my one visit. The Diablo seems to be a tuna roll with tempura shrimp and a heated mixture of crab, scallops, and some kind of mayonnaise sauce on top. Very nice. The Heart Attack app is fried jalapeno strips with roe garnish, avocado, and some kind of glaze, a great start. The presentation is first rate. No bare bones sushi here. \\n\\nDecor - They really did this place right. Granite tables, understated but quality decorations. Good looking (although maybe too small if they ever get busy) sushi bar. Nice entryway with a huge glass window with their logo. \\n\\nStaff - Uber friendly at the moment. They are clearly concerned about the lack of customers at this point, which can be a little uncomfortable. There were probably 6 people that pounced to greet us as we walked in. But that should wear off if the crowds start to come and the staff has more to do. \\n\\nLocation - Great for folks that live in the William Cannon/Circle C area. We don't have many good eateries in the area at the moment, so this is a welcome addition that we need to support. \\n\\nParking - Ample. Strip mall. Not always a given in Austin. \\n\\nCons: \\n\\nPrice - It's not really too bad, it's just sushi. The Heart Attack app I loved was a little pricey at $8 for 10 jalapeno slivers, but no big deal. The rolls are appropriately priced for their substantial size at $10-11. \\n\\nAmbiance - The decor and music was great. It's just that they were empty. I'm the kind of guy that likes, and takes comfort in, a busy bar/restaurant. If it's busy they must be doing something right and they wont be hovering over you in a nervous attempt to make sure that every precious customer returns. Hopefully this will get better as more people show up.\\n\\nOverall: \\n\\nA great addition to the neighborhood.  Im just concerned that they might go out of business.  They need to promote more.

Once you get inside the atmosphere is quite pleasant and you can even afford to bask a little bit on those cool high chairs they have facing the window (if you're into watching BU students stroll by in their Uggs and folks jogging by in their City Sports gear). While sitting near the window, sipping on my tea and munching on my oh-so- delicious ham and egg salad bun (freshly made in the local Japanese bakery, of all places) I also noticed a lot of passerbys stopping by for curiosity's sake to peer in the window and try to catch a glimpse of the interior. If you're going to throw some french fusion into the name, take a cue from the french- cafe facades should be about openness; as much voyeurism goes on in a cafe setting, the view should go both ways. \\n\\nThat being said, this place is a great place to hang out for a few hours- it's warm on the inside but not stifling, and there's plenty of seating to go around. The cafe itself offers some tasty (and unique) treats, ranging from french style pain-au-chocolats/raisin to the less ubiquitous Japanese rice balls with spicy tuna and custard buns. Did I hear a rumor that beer was going to be on tap very soon? Asahi alongside Sam Adams? The d√©cor is modern, and somewhat eclectic (lacquered red tabletops are great for confirming in your reflection that you need a good caffeine fix to start your day... and keep it going). The service is friendly and above all- who can turn down free samples of sticky buns being delivered straight to your table?\\n\\nSome things are worth the pains of overcoming one's curiosity."},{"name":"Cruzteca Mexican Kitchen","address":"5207 Brodie Ln, Ste 125","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We walked in here not realizing that they are the new brick and mortar location for Mellizoz (awesome taco truck that's been down on South 1st for nine years), but the 2.5 year old in our party demanded Mexican, and it was right in the same parking lot. When we sat down, my one year old promptly dumped an entire drink everywhere.  It was mortifying, but the staff could not have been nicer.  They whisked in and shuttled us to a new table so they could mop everything up all the while chatting with us and the kids. The tacos were delicious.  I had a breakfast taco on flour that was absolutely enough for lunch, and I am usually a two taco person.  The guacamole was great, and my lunch date loved her vegan mushroom taco.

Judging by the dozens of 5 star reviews, I thought my experience here would be unforgettable. The core concept- a steakhouse restaurant offering Canadian inspired dishes- barely gets off the ground. Aside from a handful of Canadian wines and a couple of poutine selections, you're pretty much no further than the Buffalo side of Niagara Falls. The artisanal cheeses are from Wisconsin. With the exception of the filet mignon the cuts of beef are from here at home. But that's not even the most disappointing thing about le Cellier. How on earth is the food here so pedestrian and uninspired? My wife's root vegetable gnocchi was flavorless and looked like a lifeless gooey blob of sauce. I had the poulet rouge, which I guess is a fancy term for \\"dark meat chicken.\\" It looks like a turducken but with half white meat kind of welded into the dark stuff. Supposedly this is a clever dish because some part of it is cooked sous vide. And the steak? My son's USDA choice sirloin was tough and chewy. Putting the letdown of the food aside, this is undoubtedly a popular place. The restaurant feels like a cozy and elegant old-style tavern that you could find in old Quebec City or Ottawa. The service was personable and professional. And the signature poutine was actually not bad. But this is not what I expected from a \\"signature dining\\" Disney experience.

But that's where it ended.  The steak was poorly trimmed.  It reminded me of a low cost nationwide chain store's meat.  You know... the one that starts with a 'W'.  After eating the steak, I know it's going to heaven because I chewed the hell out of it.  The others in my party said their French Dip sandwich was good. But the fries tasted of old wax (old grease).  \\nOur server was very nice.  The restaurant seemed clean and well maintained.

Furthermore, what was billed as octopus for $16 turned out to be a handful of tiny, scored, oblong pieces of paprika (?!) pasta with four, #2 pencil, eraser-sized pieces of octopus.  The yellowtail crudo was tasty as was the pear salad.  The burrata cheese \\"bowl\\" was forgettable, and there were two, fingernail-sized pieces of black pepper biscotti with it, so, really, the burrata was meant to be eaten plain, which is beneath the dignity of a restaurant charging these prices and discharging the arrogance of restaurants whose food is beyond reproach.  The grilled artichokes did not look or taste like fesh artichokes and tasted suspiciously like glass-jarred, Cara Mia artichokes, with a claim of Hollaindaise atop it.  Frankly, the topping tasted like Best Foods mayonnaise and looked like someone had plopped the sauce on, as an afterthought.  Zero aesthetic appeal.  The brussel sprouts were overboiled or oversteamed (kind of a nursing home menu way of preparing brussel sprouts), but I did like the cranberry relish that was paired with the brussel sprouts and will try serving my own diced and sauteed brussel sprouts with a cranberry-orange relish, at home.  The turkey tortellini was simply a failure.  The (foul) turkey overpowered (and was salty) anything else that was included in the plate.  I was also hard-pressed to identify a black trumpet mushroom in this turkey-pasta mess.  Finally I noticed the two different waiters or, maybe, hostess and waiter, kinda deflate when we said we weren't drinking alcohol, which is not a nice or appropriate attitude.  If you want to attract drinkers, exclusively, then serve alcohol, exclusively, which might be an act of kindness, considering the appeal and quantity of the food.  The water was good, and I am really very pleased to have happened upon the idea of serving cranberry with brussel sprouts.  Also, this place, which is sized for lilliputians, is not so great for adult-sized people.  There were four of us, slender and all under 6', seated at a table that could not accommodate more than three people.  There was zero space, under the table, for our legs, and I was not up to wrapping my legs around my neck, yoga-style.  Maybe, we hit them on the wrong night?"},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I love a company that responds to its customers.

This is a place that makes you wonder what the buzz is about. The menu aims to give you a selection of world fusion tastes, but too many of the dishes seemed robbed of any appropriate flavor, whether overpowered with spice or saturated with salt. For example, the Spicy Thai Noodles were so spicy as to be unpleasant -- said from the perspective of one who enjoys really spicy food -- and a missing bit of sugar might have returned this dish to something more of its Asian roots and flavor. The Lamb Tips were short on the tips and the residual was a heavily salted concoction obviously designed to sell beverages more than a return visit for food. The Burger was fine, but small and not more outsized in flavor. The Impossible Burger was, well, impossible--not so much for the burger itself as the soggy little pieces of bun it was sandwiched between. The Flautas had a nice crispy texture that was surprising, but failed to flout any fundamental flavor notes. Honestly, they seemed just like a mouthful of crispy stuff without any distinct flavor--was there ANY chorizo inside?

WRONG! My chicken was bland, no spices, flavor or nothing and my fajita looked very undercooked and did not have any flavor either! Everybody in our party ordered something different and nobody liked their plate or shared any positive reviews. Their chips are store bought chips used for nachos you typically buy in school, not even tortilla chips! Of course their salsa is store bought too, like Tostitos. Unfortunately, my Matron of Honor got food poisoning from the fajita nachos plate she ordered. She was constantly having to go to restroom due to the frequency of feeling ill! She even burst an eye vessel due to vomiting so frequently! It was definitely the fajita meat, because she became very ill right after eating there, to the point where she was unable to go with us out that night to celebrate!

I am fairly impressed for airport food.  Ordered the pecan encrusted chicken with mashed potatoes covered with cranberry chutney.  While the chicken is pounced into thin rectangular pieces, don't let the shape fool you. Packed with flavor and a little bit of crunch and I can see why it's the most expensive item on the menu ($18.50).  The mashed potatoes tasted good and were lumpy with two whole slices of red potatoes, just the way I like them. The taste is fabulous and pairs perfectly with the chicken.  I went cheap with the wine and regretted it, the $6 wine tastes more like church wine, so lesson learned.  Service is fairly good considering the place was packed and almost every seat taken.  Word of caution however they consistently forgot the silverware. The people on either side of me, as well as myself, got the food first before getting the silverware. Bonus is the silverware is real utensils and not the cheap plastic crap.  Faith, my waitress, was very attentive even though she was running all over.  Wish I saved room for the crepes as they looked delicious.  I'd like to visit the non airport location and see if the menu and food is even better.

When I was little I used to look forward to it and as I got older I definitely enjoyed the view more. \\n\\nAs everyone knows, and as I always remembered, you do NOT go here for the food. You go for drinks and chips with queso/guac/salsa. The view is the ONLY thing the place has going for it. \\n\\nI always take people who visit Austin here for the amazing view but this last time over Thanksgiving weekend, I was completely turned off. For sure it has expanded and I was confused. There's a giant garage and now this complex with these different shops. Not sure if I liked that much-didn't feel very Austin-y. \\n\\nPutting that aside, the service was ATROCIOUS. We had the WORST and most RUDE server we've ever had. I think her name was Zero or something (it was sunny and my contacts are weak) but she had such an attitude. \\n\\nYes, we had a large group but all we asked is if we can put two tables together as they had put us on this weird long bench. She kept saying \\"It's not really up to me, I'll ask\\". It wasn't until 20 minutes later we finally got to move and this was after her attitude and after that we barely saw her. I was just so turned off from the experience. \\n\\nI would rather go to Hula Hut or better yet, anywhere else than come here again.

But there's more to it than that. \\n\\nThey've fallen into the really horrible (and not so uncommon) position of having high-end prices and seriously middle-of-the-road cuisine (that includes bbq and other menu items). \\n\\nMost recently, a colleague and I visited at about 7:00 PM on a Friday without reservations. We were seated immediately and our waiter took our drink orders in a reasonable amount of time. He was not particularly educated on the wine/drink menu, but that was not an issue at all to me. \\n\\nWe decided to forego (sorry Firefox spell check, but \\"forego\\" is indeed a word) appetizers because none of them looked particularly...well...novel or appetizing. \\n\\nHe ordered from the daily specials menu:  pork cheeks served on Hatch green chile risotto ($30).   I ordered a ribeye, medium rare, that was to be crusted with brown sugar and something else. I say \\"something else\\" because all I could taste was the brown sugar. I ordered medium rare, but the first time it came out, it was medium well (if not well done). Had this been a $17 steak at Outback Steakhouse, I might just have held onto it and enjoyed it. But this thing was a \\"Niman Ranch\\" ribeye priced at $39. \\n\\nWhen the replacement came out, it was probably medium rare (though really more like medium). However,  the content of the cut itself was probably about 49% inedible fat. I'm a ribeye eater - so I know it can be hit or miss - I also grill a mean steak (for a fraction of the price you'll pay at a steakhouse) - but for the price, this level of fat content was unacceptable. I didn't raise this point with the waiter, however, because I felt as though any further complaints might be reaching the point of diminishing returns (slight pun intended). \\n\\nBroccoli side was certainly passable (though far from standout), and if the amount of food left on his plate at the end of his meal was any indication,  my colleague's meal was apparently very good, though he also brought the price point up in later conversation. So I'm guessing it was more a combination of the facts that it wasn't bad and he was very hungry.   \\n\\nI understand that I didn't order their from their specialty BBQ menu, but even that seemed - as other reviewers have noted - a bit above a reasonable price point. \\n\\nUnfortunately, Lambert's seems to reside within a growing subset of \\"established\\"  Austin restaurants that have decided that keeping up with the times (and the dazzling variety of new local establishments) simply means keeping up with what they feel is the prevailing price point. \\n\\nI doubt I'll be back."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Mmmmm....potroast.

Want to romance someone? Impress your out of town guests? Enjoy one of the best experiences in the city? \\nLook No Further!! \\n\\nI came to this extraordinary restaurant atop the Hilton Hotel on July 4th to watch the fireworks burst all over the city, and I was entranced by this place!\\n\\nLet me start by saying that the restaurant closed down for renovations in 2013. I believe they re-opened in January 2014, and they did so with a new look and a new chef and manager, so reviews prior to that do not reflect the current experience. \\n\\nAlso, the hours listed here are accurate, but know that they don't really \\"close\\" at 9:30. That is their last dinner seating. \\n\\nHalf the place is a restaurant and half is a bar. So if you don't have the money to spend on a lavish meal, just come up and enjoy a drink at the bar. The atmosphere is SOOO lush, romantic, and special. The bar stays open until midnight. \\n\\nHowever, valet parking at the Hilton is free (validated) for dinner guests, but not for bar visitors.\\n\\nThe food was phenomenal. Amazing. Perfection. My companion and I each got the 4-course meal and tried 7 different dishes between us. Every single one was fantastic. Is it pricey? It is for Atlanta, with entrees in the $28-$40 range, and the smaller dishes $12-$16. Glasses of wine were in and around $10.\\n\\nNikolai's Roof has a one-page menu that changes often. You can order a la carte off the menu, but most people go with the 3-, 4-, or 6-course \\"tasting menu\\" that lets you choose one dish from each category. The 6-course includes a Starter, a small plate From the Sea, small plate From the Land, Entree, Cheese course, and Dessert. The 3 and 4 course options lose the cheese course and lets you choose one or two from items from any of the first three categories in addition to your entree and dessert. \\n\\nTheir wine and spirits list is brought to you on an iPad. It's pretty fun. :)\\n\\nThe service for us was exceptional, with well trained and unobtrusive staff in impeccable uniforms (they used to wear white gloves in here, a practice I'm glad they gave up with the new renovation. That would seem a bit too much). This is NOT a place for a quick bite. This is old-school European style dining where you are expected to take several hours for your meal. To me, it is one of the ways Nikolai's stands out. Unlike the Sun Dial, which kicks you out of your table after 2 hours, Nikolai's would be horrified if you left so quickly! When you are paying top dollar for ambiance and views, take the time to enjoy it!\\n\\nBut, you need to come in with the mindset of slowly savoring your experience. If you expect your first course to come out within 2 minutes, you WILL be disappointed. \\n\\nIn my opinion - quality and freshly prepared food takes time, and I am more than willing to wait for it, especially while I look out on the gorgeous view of my hometown!\\n\\nThe view.....THE VIEW!!! Spectacular, really and truly. \\n\\nCome and try this place! You won't be disappointed!!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

Salads: the Pok Choi was very good, the tomato whatever with cornbread was muddled and a bad mix of ingredients. Mains: the hanger steak was overwhelmed by teriyaki, the game hen was undercooked, and the sauce was again overwhelming and had a bad flavor. The sides were \\"different\\", bad. The duck was medium rare to rare, and while it was not bad at all, the sides were inedible. Coffee was bitter, despite cream and 8 Splenda.

I've moved towards a plant based, vegetarian and more recently almost vegan diet.  So when my job required me to make frequent trips out to the Midwest, which basically has more McDonalds restaurants than I've ever seen before, I presumed I'd be miserably stuck eating fruit cups or chewing on pre-cut raw veggies from grocery stores.  \\nAnd then I found Northstar Caf√© and fell in love with it.\\n\\nThe philosophy behind Northstar is simple; they choose locally grown, organic, and artisan produced foods, prepare most condiments and seasonings in house. I'm pretty sure I've gone through every vegetarian menu option they have, and as a former seafood junkie, having a salad a day didn't seem like a very appealing thought, but Northstar makes it delicious! Laden with fresh greens, avocados, almonds, tofu, dates, chopped fruits and laced with a champagne vinaigrette; the salads here are filling and incredibly satisfying. Other favorites include their Buddha Bowl with brown rice, steamed vegetables and tofu, and their veggie burger.  For those who want meat - my very southern colleague who grew up in Dallas has now become a big fan of their burgers, if that is any indication.  And to keep things a little \\"edgy\\", Northstar serves up pretty good cocktails and have a decent selection of craft beer and wine. \\n\\nEverything at Northstar is downright wholesome - I mean their staff is perpetually smiling and super cheerful; they're extremely helpful and didn't accept tips till a couple of days ago. This paired with the bright, sunny, beautifully laid out space, a magazine rack where you can pick up a stack to browse through while you eat, a solid playlist featuring some of the best indie bands, and of course -great food, has made this one of my all-time favorite restaurants.\\n\\nAnd it also makes me very thankful for having a huge list of favorite bars in DC where I can wash down all this self-righteousness."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Touristy and overpriced is an understatement.

Your customers have options and you need to try really hard to make your business THEIR option!\\n\\nAs the wrap up of the HKS mid career year continues deep into its second month, an intimate group of 45 or so descended upon the Living Room in Boston the other night.\\n\\nI have spent much of this year organizing dinners with my classmates. Its been a great way to get to know as many of them as possible. It's also been a great way to get to know some of the better restaurants of my newly adopted hometown.\\n\\nThese dinners have run the gamut from four people at the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to, to 35 people having BBQ and booze in large quantities in a basement. It's been a great experience all around and each dinner was fun and easy to organize. That is until the other night.\\n\\nWith so many of my classmates staying in town post graduation we decided to have one last dinner. As of a week ago we had 50 people wanting to join. I wondered where could I make a booking for 50 on short notice. After a bit of research, I came upon the Living Room.\\n\\nWhen I called I was greeted by a friendly and accommodating person. After about a minute I was informed that they indeed could accommodate 50. I should have questioned what kind of place could accommodate so many on such short notice but I was happy to have a place.\\n\\nThen things got more and more difficult:\\n\\nThe next day I was told that we must use a prix fixe menu. No big deal thats normal for a large group\\n\\nThe following day they told me we needed to preselect our appetizers and our desserts.\\n\\nThe day after that we were told that we all had to have the same dessert.\\n\\nThe day before the dinner I was told that I had to guarantee the maximum amount, that i couldn't add anyone that I hadn't already confirmed and I was liable for the maximum number.\\n\\nIt seems that the manager, John wanted to be totally riskless with a group that was going to fill his restaurant on a Tuesday night. I balked and we came to something of a compromise.\\n\\nThe dinner was actually quite a success. The company was as always excellent. Great conversation and laughs. The food was pretty good even if some of us didn't get exactly what we PRE ordered. The venue was kind of cool. The best part about it is that it has its own ATM.\\n\\nWhy was that the best part? Well, John had a bit of an issue with us paying with multiple credit cards. The story was that the \\"system\\" couldn't handle it. Now we've had groups in excess of 30 at least five times and this has never been an issue. It usually involves me managing the process but heck everyone has a skill. After about 20 minutes of trying, John looked at me and said, \\"If I had known that you were going to try to pay with more than one credit card I would have refused the reservation.\\" He said this to someone who just spent $3,000 in his restaurant on a night that otherwise would have been virtually dead. We than began the pride of HKS Alumni to the ATM.\\n\\nI can only wonder what he would have done if a party of 20 had walked in without a reservation!\\n\\nIts a shame that I felt compelled to write this negative review about what was essentially a good meal at a reasonable price.\\n\\nMoral of the story is that the Living Room needs a new manager.\\n\\nPS: Kudos to Amy who was pleasant and helpful regardless of what her boss did or said."},{"name":"Originals Cafe Mexicano","address":"2231 Clarke Street","city":"Port Moody","stars":"4","text":"Cute little place.

People complain about the elevators, but let's start with the escalator going down from the second floor to the first: it's currently inoperable.  When I arrived with my luggage, I entered at the street level and made the mistake of taking the \\"up\\" escalator to get to what I thought would be the reception area.  It's the Starbucks and sports bar area instead; checkin was downstairs.  What to do?  Since the \\"down\\" escalator was blocked off \\"for maintenance,\\" I had to take the elevator.  This gave me a fair introduction to the hotel!  As other reviewers have explained to you, there are long waits for elevators in this place.  It's a well-established principle that people will get antsy if they have to wait more than 60 seconds after they press an elevator button.  Here you can stand around for two or three minutes before something happens.  At peak times of the day, you can come down to the aforementioned Starbucks, hit the \\"up\\" button, grab a coffee and still get back to the elevator bank before anything has happened.\\n\\nHere's a detail: if you happen to be on the fifth floor (where the gym is) and want to go down, there are two possible \\"down\\" buttons you can press: one for the bank of express elevators (they service 1-5 and 27-38) and one for the bank of local elevators (the ones that service 1-27).  The two buttons don't know about each other, so your choice is to press one button and hope an elevator comes soon or to press both buttons, thereby forcing some other passengers to stop unnecessarily.  This little detail could surely be fixed by the right technology.\\n\\nFor everything else, this hotel was great!  I loved my room, which was high up and on a corner -- it got views in two slightly different directions.  Everything worked properly, and everything was clean and up-to-date looking.  The hotel staff were pleasant and accommodating.\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have been invited to a buffet dinner for roughly 50 people that was served in one of the meeting rooms on the bottom floors.  The meal was fabulous and must have been quite pricey.  It was instructive to see that the hotel can put out really good food for a group if it wants to.\\n\\nAnd the gym!!

GLUTE FREE OPTIONS HERE\\n\\nGeting Picky:\\n\\nArrival: The entire reason I went here was because I was passing by and the storefront has a certain appeal that pulls you in. Upon first entering, I wasn't sure where to go or how to order but there was a woman standing at the front with an iPhone ready to take my order. Their menus are large LCD screens that are easy to read and have limited options (always a good thing for lunch).\\n\\nI inquired about Gluten Free options and she pointed me to the Chick Pea Platter. They offer all of their sandwiches without the bread which is usually a bummer, but they give you this rice salad with almonds that is really good instead of the bread. \\n\\nOne issue: They ran out of quite a few menu items by 1pm. Im sure with time, they will figure all that out as they are a brand new location.\\n\\nThe staff had the typical cognizance of a new location with new staff. Seemingly tripping up and over each other at certain times, but I'm sure they will figure out all the little things along the way. Some people do not know that 99% of restaurants have this issue, its a learning curve.\\n\\nI love the fact that the kitchen is in plain view, you can actually stand two feet away from your food being prepared, but the staff preparing the food seemed a little unhappy, but it was busy and sometimes that throws people off. However, the kitchen seemed to be very sanitary. I saw people wiping the prep stations after pretty much every sandwich being made.\\n\\nThe Layout: The layout is more closely related to an Apple store than a restaurant. Very minimal design and nice and bright inside, very inviting. There is a little ledge along the wall for people who like to stand and eat, as well as a communal table, a bar (where I sat) and some scattered tables and chairs.\\n\\nOverall: Great Lunch place with a nice atmosphere but I wouldn't go there for a meeting or to study as its really noisy.\\n\\nFOLLOW UP I WENT HERE TODAY:\\n\\nFood is still good, staff is still trying to figure out how to work in that bottle neck of a kitchen setup. They are all crowded in one spot and the other half of the kitchen is empty, I think they should take a look at whats going on there.

My favorite dessert at the moment is probably the chocolate chip cheesecake, which weighs about a half pound per giant slice. It is the most heavenly marriage of fudgy chocolate cake and creamy cheesecake--just don't attempt to eat it all in one sitting or by oneself.

However, we also ordered the creme br√ªl√©e, which was to die for, and I absolutely would recommend it, but not when you have to wait 26 minutes for it, especially when we ordered it at the same time we placed the rest of our dinner order. After waiting another 14 for our check, we stormed the front desk, and asked to be cashed out. Our check was short two sushi rolls. Generally, I'm all about correcting errors such as this, but after our egregious wait, and they didn't even offer to comp our dessert, nah.\\n\\nAlso, there wasn't enough syrup in the Coke, so says my husband.

But I will say it was still good and their dressing on it was amazing. Saganaki Flamb√© was delicious! It's a type of cheese that they light on fire and then you blow it out and dip pita bread into it. It was so good I've actually been craving it all day.

It's about the taste...either grilled or broiled and the sauce, relish - whatever - it has to be a unique experience. To me, meat, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, and onion isn't unique.

Main St. Dairy Queen is one of these places and it has always been one of the most popular burgers in town. Even if they aren't your cup-o-tea, at least you know it, whereas, generic burgers, well, they are a convenience...not a taste. \\n\\n I've been eating burgers at Main St. DQ since they were in a building to the North, way back in the fifty's, which is now a traffic Island. So true to their product are these people, that when Dairy Queen, the Franchiser, decided to use less fat in their dairy products, these franchisees decided to pull out of the chain and only keep the Dairy Queen logo for product recognition...their product being way better than the Braziers.

We started with some stuffed squid which was, sadly, way too tough - either undercooked or overcooked, depending on how you look at it.  And the sauce the squid swam in was imbalanced, too acidic perhaps, or just too spicy.  The best dish we had by FAR was the pumpkin ravioli in sage cream sauce.  Oh damn, that was good.  The sauce was not to sagey (I hate it when things are too sagey) and creamy but light.  The pumpkin was pleasantly tangy and only a little sweet.  Just about the perfect pasta dish for me.

The sauce was weirdly tangy, and not in a good way. \\n\\nMy fianc√© ordered some Tibetan noodles, which were bland and unappetizing, and he too complained about the bland and overly oily appetizer sampler. \\n\\nWe were surprised by the low quality considering the reviews online, which were overwhelmingly positive.

Heck, I'd like to say I completed just one of those goals. But nope... I failed. \\n\\nI got to Austin around 12pm on a Friday. It was around 1:30pm when I finally had a chance to make my way to Franklin, by foot. Needless to say I reached my destination (2 miles later) to greeted by a note written on butchers paper: SOLD OUT. I was heartbroken. My cowboy boots began to cause my toes to ache. My stomach screamed at me, \\"YOU IDIOT! CAN'T YOU READ THEIR WEBSITE?!*\\" (See below.)\\n\\nI went the next 3 days eating crap. I mean it too. Lousy tacos, terrible \\"Italian\\" food (not by choice, I swear), and some fajitas that I'm sure made me ill. It wasn't until Day 4 that I finally rewarded my trip to Austin with some beef. I trekked back to Franklin on Monday morning thinking, \\"They won't be sold out this time!\\" Only to be greeted by that evil butchers paper once again. This time the note read: CLOSED ON MONDAYS. Once again my stomach screamed at me, \\"YOU IDIOT! CAN'T YOU READ THEIR WEBSITE?**\\"\\" (Again, see below.) Sigh...\\n\\nSo we ended up at Lambert's.

It didn't have any \\"wow\\" factor whatsoever. But that's what you get when you order pulled pork in Texas, I suppose. It is land of the brisket.

At least by my standards. \\n\\nWhat did wow me? Well, I'm glad you asked. The Maple and Coriander Crusted Natural Pork Ribs were incredible. I wish I had ordered them three times and disregarded the other two, mediocre at best, meats. So tender. So flavorful. The right amount of fat. The maple and coriander clashed so well.

For instance the meatloaf which I think is really good is like half a meatloaf. Anyway, I've tried a lot of different things on the menu, most of the pasta dishes, orange chicken, some of the steak items, the brunch menu is really good, and you can always get the Sunrise Fiesta Burrito which is really good. I've also tried a lot of their cheesecake which you can get to go or buy a smaller or larger cake to go, the smaller ones are usually plenty big enough because you can cut small pieces for about ten people and they are filling.

Yay for her.\\n\\nI grew up in Singapore, so from the get-go I have a different approach to Malaysian / Singaporean food. Something I always aim to try is roti canai, which many places advertise and typically ends up looking like the roti prata I remember from my youth, including that specific flavoured curry you get when you order roti prata / roti canai on its own.\\n\\nThe roti prata I had in Singapore and which my mom makes occasionally is never sweetened. Nevertheless I have had roti canai with sweet dough in Canada -- but nothing as sweet as what I got from Banana Leaf. You can eat this on its own as dessert except it comes steaming hot.\\nThe curry was quite thick (easy to dip, therefore) and also very sweet. I think this really killed it for me -- a curry that was more sweet than curry flavoured, and with basically no spicy heat to it. Taste was coconutty, and maybe in an effort to make it vegetarian they took out the meat broth, which double-killed it for me--there is a curry specific to roti prata when ordered on its own, and this wasn't it.\\n\\nMaybe they have carefully adjusted this menu item based on years of customer feedback, but I will never order it again from Banana Leaf: It is just too alien compared to the roti prata I remember fondly from my childhood and which is replicated more closely as \\"roti canai\\" at other places like Spoon Kitchen and Bo Laksa King's Bubbles and Bits (now just \\"Laksa King\\").\\n\\n*\\n\\nMalaysia Laksa Curry Mee ($13) was passable. Just don't count the toppings like I did. You get about 1 cup's worth of the \\"toppings\\" listed (egg, shrimp, etcetera). If that is good enough value for you, then don't look and just mix it all in. Otherwise, you might think, \\"what? only 3 shrimps?\\"\\nDespite the chili symbol, it is on the mild side of spicy -- and that was also disappointing to me.\\n\\nI suppose to streamline things and cater to a Canadian demographic in a city with vegetarian-consciousness they have adjusted how they cook things into a winning formula that has seen them expand into a chain with many outlets. But if you're looking for a very authentic Malaysian / Singaporean food experience, go elsewhere.\\n\\n*\\n\\nBring a bag WITH HANDLES if you are going to take anything home, such as the young coconut (to get at the coconut meat after you are done drinking the coconut water).

Wild salmon hash:  my friend's choice.  Served with 2 eggs any style and potatoes.  Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to try this dish as it disappeared quickly.  My friend enjoyed it very much.  \\n\\n2.  Mike's scramble:  the combination of the prosciutto ham, tomatoes, and provolone cheese is a winner!  I loved this dish!  Served with potatoes and toast.  This was definitely a comfort-food type of breakfast for me.\\n\\nDRINK:  Coffee, of course.  Served in cups proclaiming \\"call your mother.\\"  I almost chose a mimosa, but I'm can't start my day properly without a cup of coffee.  Refills complimentary and generous.  My cup never seemed to go empty.\\n\\nSERVICE:  Outstanding.  Every staff we encountered during our visit/meal exhibited exemplary customer service.  As I've already stated, I chose to make a reservation for breakfast, which turned out to be a smart decision as there were people waiting for a table when we arrived half hour early.  The hostess was quite friendly and welcoming as she checked her reservation book and showed us to our seats.\\n\\nThe server was a bright, social, and friendly young woman.  And very patient.  She allowed us as much time as we needed to look over the menus and asked if we had any questions.  She returned constantly to check up on us and to provide coffee refills.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  Delicious breakfast.  Wonderful service.  Hope to return on any future trips to Portland."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Service was great.

When I opened it up, I was surprised at how small they were. Sadly, not one of them was to my liking. The regular roll was bland, uninspired and very small. The two specialty roles were strange. I expected one of them to be delicious and instead it was dry, it seemed like the fish was dry and possibly even cooked (Not as described), And the other one had a strange fishy taste which made it hard to eat but should not have had any fish in it that smelled that way.

The pork itself is really savory, but balances nicely with the sweet, pickled veggies and raw cucumbers/jalapenos/cilantro. The baguette makes the dish - crunchy on the outside but still soft and light on the inside. They sell the baguettes separately for pretty cheap, if you love them so much and want to take them home for your own personal sandwich concoctions. \\n\\nThe pho here is okay, and they have a 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 soup combo for $8 if you want a taste of both dishes.

So, I decided to take a friend and than I brought more friends and than I would come alone. Kojo is the owner and chef. His food is my favorite when it comes to soul food in Columbus. its well cooked, well seasoned, and very delicious. it's tucked away in a side street in the up and coming Linden area. From fried fish to mac and cheese and to his turkey lasagna. Friday's are literally my favorite at his place and it's eat to enjoy not eat all you can as he holds a special every Friday. Not advertised as an buffet but this is a chance to see him display almost all of his menu as a serve yourself style for $10. So it gives you a chance to try a little here and there. But don't be abusive of it just take what can eat and enjoy yourself. There is always nice music playing and nice people around the city with lots of character.  I enjoy talking to Kojo he's a really humble person and hard working. I respect local independent business. So I will continue to support him."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place is what dreams are made of!

Rough and ready name and decor, but with an oddly delicate menu and fancy Beligian saison style beers served in tulip glasses.  Its like a diner cook and a French chef decided to fight it out, LIVE, ON-THE-MENU.\\n\\nWe started with cheesy biscuits, served spicy honey butter.  You'll quickly find out its the butter that makes most of the appetizers, because the actual food is just a bland carrier.  These were a less flavorful and poker chip-sized 1/2 scale model of a Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuit, but you only get 3 for your $5.  They could at least give you 4.  They should give you 4.  They are small.\\n\\nWe also had the Bread and Fat which is \\"a selection of breads, whipped butters and fats, paired with rotating salts.\\"  More fancy bistro than fighting bronco, but hey, this brewery is different.  The (oddly mostly blackened and burnt) bread figured out to be $1 per credit card-sized sliver, and while the 3 different hand crafted butters and assorted coarse salts were good, 1 or 2 people could easily eat this and it might equate to 2 regular slices of table bread and butter.\\n\\nSince most people come to a brewery to eat more hearty food, 2 of us got the burger, and one got the chicken sandwich, and the remaining person got a chopped salad.  They were all good, but nothing special.  Nothing makes me want to come back, and the pilsner served in a tulip glass actively makes me want to stay away.\\n\\nService was good, and I should know, I had to keep ordering copious amounts of the only non-saison (the pilsner) and at only 10oz or so, you can have 3 glasses and its only 2.5 regular 'merican beers.\\n\\nI try to drink the brewery beer while I am at said brewery, hence their pilsner offering, but if you have Bud-Light-or-die guests in your party, they'll have to just order Bud Light.  Nothing on the menu would satisfy me, for say, watching the game.  Every other brewery with food in town has normal size pints (or larger) and they can give you something to eat that is not $1 per ounce, or more.\\n\\nTo end on a positive note, this is the very finest restaurant that has ever been at this exact address.  Take that, Banana Joe's and World of Beers!\\n\\nI don't know how to some it up.  I think I would announce it this way:\\n\\n\\"Do you like delciate appetizers and saison beer?

I had a similar experience to one of the other reviewers at the door. We weren't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait. A server/hostess was talking on the phone at a table in the walkway so we waited until she finished and then she sat us. \\n\\nOur server was attentive and intense. A little too much intensity for me, but we decided that was just her personality. It was almost a little forced, but she meant well. The food came out fast and while it was good, it wasn't spectacular. We had spinach dip as a starter and I had a Caesar salad with fried shrimp (just 4 of them). My friend had the shrimp basket, which was overflowing with shrimp. You'd think they'd given me at least 6 for my salad. Salad was good, again, nothing that sent me into screams of delight.\\n\\nThe best thing was the drink. I had a martini..not remembering the flavor, but I do remember it was good. They also fixed up a pretty strong Mexican coffee for me after dinner.\\n\\nI will most likely give BrickTops another try, but it will probably be a random day I am out that way running errands.

SO WEIRD I KNOW!\\n\\nAnyways, my boyfriend's rabbit sandwich was DELICIOUS (we share :D). I don't think I've ever had rabbit before but it was DAMN GOOD.

I will post a picture of it on the Yelp website.\\n\\n\\nNow the reason why I am taking away a star is that the pricing is a little much.

However, Mom and I have eaten here at this branch of the local mini-chain (there are two others in addition to this one) Seito like, oh, about 20 times so I feel that all in all my review is pretty right-on.\\n\\nAnyhow, this time was about 1pm on a Monday (I tried to tell mom that you shouldn't eat seafood on Mondays as there's no fishing on Sunday, but I got the blank look from her and the annoyed \\"It'll be fine\\" from her better half).  There are 5 tables outside - all were empty.  From the looks of it, there were 3-4 tables inside with diners.\\n\\n- 1 Star - Inattentiveness to cleanliness.  The table next to us was un-bused for over 20 minutes.  Ick.  The soy sauce bottle we were brought had a cilantro leaf adhered to the outside.  Like - it had adhered when it was damp and now was dry and was REALLY glued on there. Like decoupage. But with less magazine clippings and more... herbs.\\n- 1 Star - The waiter seemed like a nice guy so I feel bad slagging off on him, but really it was completely way too complex to order (um, he couldn't understand our orders, even though they were from the lunch menu, which only has about 9 choices and then bento boxes which are about, oh, 5) from him as we had to point and explain... A bit maddening.  But then he brought... The wrong stuff. Sigh.  Nice, but not all that on top of it.\\n+ 1 Star - Value.  I think that most restaurants are overpriced in Orlando.  Coming from LA, where salaries are higher, I am baffled that the prices in the land of Mickey are about the same as the land of LaLa.  So to find a place where you can get a pretty nice meal for $10 is great!  We had a steak teriyaki bento box, a California combo and a Deluxe sushi combo, plus a side Moyashi salad for $37 + tip (lunch includes one drink per person - a $2 value, more or less)\\n+ 1 Star -  The sushi is very fresh and of good quality.  I appreciate that the slices of sashimi were nice and thick - not the scrawny slices that often come up for lunch deals.  My sashimi deluxe had some of the nicer fresh snapper I have had in a while. Three slices per fish - I think that they were: salmon, tuna, white tuna, snapper, and... a couple others.  I ate them with alacrity.  They were darn good.\\n+1 Star - Free refills on soda! Okay, so maybe I secretly have a craving for Taco Bell and the freebies at the soda fountain, but I always feel that charging for what costs pretty much nada to the establishment is a rip.  So it was nice that the waiter brought a pitcher to refill our sodas was... coolio.\\n+ 1/ -1 Star - At this particular location, parking is free and on the street.  Which is great alot of the time as most of the time it's easy to come by.  But then again some times (not this particular time mind you, so my neutral review...) it can be a nightmare to find a spot.  Totally random.\\n\\nAll in all, Seito is one of those \\"hey I want sushi\\" \\"oh, let's not drive far\\" \\"yeah, let's go that local place\\" \\"ok but I'm not showering or getting all fancy to go\\" \\"ok\\" \\"okay\\" places.

The bartender suggested some plates and we were kind of indecisive.  We saw a plate go by us that had multiple items on it.  The bartender said that it was not a specific plate.  That you can order a sample of multiple items.  So we decided to do just that, but left it up to the bartender to order.  Well I can say with out a doubt that was the best idea ever.  We ate a little of everything.  It was a bit more expensive, but we got to sample all of their bbq items.  It was delicious.

The food is always delicious and the service is typically friendly and professional. I had one experience in particular I want to share. It was the weekend back in May where the city put in place a boil water notice. My friend was visiting and we went downtown to get brunch at a different place nearby, but it was closed due to the water situation. It was saturday morning so I knew Mothers would be swamped, not to mention other places being closed concentrated the masses of brunch seekers further. As expected there were almost 20 people milling around outside waiting for tables. The wait for two was just over an hour, but I was politely informed by the host that the bar was first come first served, and lucky for us we vultured a spot that was just being vacated. I believe Rachel was the name of the woman serving the bar/making espresso drinks for the whole restaurant (reddish hair, short bangs, light blue or green eyes, freckles, friendly smile). Though she never stopped moving because of how busy they were, she provided excellent service, advising my indecisive friend, double checking with the kitchen to accommodate my food allergy, and more. There was also a gentleman behind the bar, I think his name was Jason, and he checked in a few times to make sure we had everything we needed and were enjoying our meals and drinks. The food was excellent, it came out surprisingly fast, they made us a big french press of coffee in addition to our Bloody Marys, and we just felt all around taken care of. Like I said at the start, I always have a good experience at Mothers, but this time, especially considering the circumstances, they outdid themselves.

The exception to this was the seafood in kombucha pumpkin, which gives you the entire pumpkin (although I wished for a tad more seafood).  \\n\\nAmbiance: the chandeliers, charging plates, and pretty napkins were quite nice.  The giant screen television, however, felt out of place.  A place that has a $108 fried rice dish should not (read: never) have a big screen playing TSN.  Also the menu had lots of spelling errors.  I think I see a new niche job opportunity...\\n\\nService:  the waiters all were on-par with the service you would receive at other \\"nice\\" chinese restaurants like Sun Sui Wah and Kirin.  Actually the waiter that took us to the table initially was the most friendly one, but unfortunately you don't always get to interact with the same server all night. They alternated between Cantonese and Mandarin but are all able to speak English pretty well.\\n\\nOverall although I didn't think the food was too bad I thought that it still didn't justify the higher cost (5 dishes ran us ~$160 after tip and tax).

I've had the chicken strips, which were over cooked rubbery and dry and didn't come with fries or even a garnish (most pubs would at least put a piece of wilted lettuce as a garnish to make the plate look fuller), I've had the bangers and mash which gave me heart burn, etc. etc. If you want to just have a pint, it is a great place. I hope the management reads online reviews, a menu change would go a long way, I would love to come more often (and so would a lot of others I know) but the food just turns us off.

The time we were meeting was 5:30 on a Sunday. The first thing I said to myself is that we are going to have to wait at least an half hour to get a table. There was 6 of us. When we arrived my brother and sister in law were already seated. No line. i could not believe it. And they seated us without having our whole party there. So, bonus for Zaftig's. Our server was very pleasant and even recommend to my brother that he get the soup of the day. She admitted to us that she was skeptical at first about the soup but when she tried it she liked it. So bonus for being honest. Here is the run down on what people ate. \\n\\nWifey - Corn Beef and American Cheese on pumpernickel with mustard. This is an awesome sandwich. The sandwich costs around $11.00 but you easily get 2 meals out of it. I got to eat the left overs. Bonus to wifey. Wifey also got the chicken noodle soup with matzo ball. It was good. But Joan and Ed's deli has better soup. \\n\\nSister in law- Salmon Burger. Every time we eat there she orders the Salmon burger. So she must like it. Rumor has it she got sick from the french fries. So, stay away from the fries. \\n\\nMy bro - got the hot dogs and I was real jealous when they came out. They looked real good. I like how Zaftig's gives you 2 options on how you want your dogs cooked. You can get them grilled or steamed. He got the classic baked beans. And looked like he cleaned off his plate. Supposedly he got sick too but he was caught eating his wife's french fries. \\n\\nPop - corned beef and Swiss with mustard on marble rye. He took half home. That just shows how much food they give you. This man has been eating corn beef his whole life. So he knows what a good sandwich is. He recommends Zaftigs. \\n\\nMom - got the french toast. She loved it. Nuff said. \\n\\nI - got the french toast stuffed with bananas. Thanks to yelp a lot of people recommended it.  It was pretty good. I was in the mood for something sweet. And this hit the spot. It came with some strawberries and blueberries on top of it. So, I felt healthy for a minute. The only negative thing was I put a clump of butter in my mouth thinking it was piece of banana. I do not recommend that trick.\\n\\nNext time I go I am getting the potato pancakes and the roasted chicken. I saw that meal on someones table. And it looked real good.\\n\\nSo, if you like deli's go to Zaftig's. A little pricey but for what is out there in the Brookline/Boston area it is well worth it."},{"name":"Bento Hut","address":"349 Decatur St SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Great service!

I had previously never been a fan of the cannoli, because I had only ever tried one once from an Italian chain restaurant a decade ago and it was terrible. But for the sake of being in Boston, I decided to give it a shot.\\n\\nI first tried a cannoli from Mike's and thought it was pretty good, but then I came here and was blown away. The ricotta filling is amazing and I don't need anything else on it (although a bit of powdered sugar doesn't hurt). The cannolis here are a little smaller than Mike's and there isn't nearly as much variety in flavors and toppings, but I think the size is perfect and the shell has a better consistency. Plus they're made to order, which just means that they only fill the shells and add the toppings after you order.\\n\\nIf you have the time, you can try to get seating. There are only a few tables, so it can take a while if there's a line. Or you can order to go and they'll neatly package your treats. There are a decent number of non-cannoli options in the cases.

I had been there before and had a really great experience so I was hoping I would again!  AND WE DID!  It was a nice night for us.\\n\\nI purchased a Groupon Coupon for a 4 course meal for 2 for $36 (Mon-Thursday) or 3 course meal for 2 for $35 (Fri-Sun).  We went on a Thursday for the 4 course option.\\n\\nWe were greeted and seated promptly.  Arriving about 7:45 pm.  They were not very busy.  So we asked for a table that was near the Fireplace (which was lovely).  There were a few other couples when we were seated.\\n\\nThe restaurant was clean and nice but is starting to show a little wear - last time we were there was about 5 years ago and it was exactly the same. I didn't like that our table was separated from the Movie theater area reception hallway by only a curtain.... and no division between the bar and dining tables.  Would be better if it were permanent dividers.  \\n\\nOur server came over to the table within about 1 minute of being seated and asked us if we were trying to catch a movie and if so what time it started so she could be aware about getting us served quickly or casually.  We had about 1 34 of an hour before the movie started.  She then asked us about drinks / wine to start.  They brought water right away while we reviewed the menu.  \\n\\nThey asked if we had coupons (which I thought was odd to ask up front) - that made me a little concerned because, it seemed like it was a given, like everyone that came there to eat had one. I wondered if coupons were the main source of their business. Our server explained the groupon and showed us what items it covered.  By the way there was plenty to choose from and stay under the coupon limits.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 wine samples (1 oz. each) which was a cool option to have, before you committed to a whole bottle.  We chose one and they were prompt to bring it to us.    \\n\\nThe coupon allowed for 1 appetizer up to $10.95 in value....there were 3 options in that price range. We chose the Spinach Artichoke dip.  Which was very good - warm and seasoned well?  BUT it came with Chips - this would be much better with a smaller portion and bread vs. Chips or a combination of Chips and bread.  Or even some veggies to dip with.  \\n\\nWe ordered salads - the coupon allowed up to $9.95 in value - all of the salads were this amount or less.  I ordered the Greek Salad, my hubby ordered the Cesar.  Both salads were a big portion and nicely done.  The Cesar dressing was especially good - they make it fresh and use real anchovies (so they claim).  Based on the taste I believe it.  \\n\\nThe Entree portion of the meal was limited to a $19.95 value each - I ordered the steak and my hubby ordered the salmon of the day. Both were more than the coupon by a few dollars.    My steak arrived and was perfectly cooked and very good.  My husbands Salmon was also perfectly cooked.  It was fresh and local.  The sides were ok - nothing spectacular..... Had the sides been a little better I think I might have given these guys 5 stars...\\n\\nThe coupon allowed for us to share a dessert...which by the way was fine because I was so full.  We had the snickers bar desert and it was very very good... and honestly I could have eaten the entire thing full or not.  \\n\\nThey server checked back on us frequently even after they got a little busy.  Our food was all very fresh and with the exceptions above tasty, the service was excellent.  I was happy to have had this experience since others had not recently.\\n\\nI would say though that without the Groupon the food was in general overpriced.  With the Groupon I think we got a good deal.  Without the Groupon I would have ordered differrently.  \\n\\nHope this helps some of you decide to participate in their dinners again!

The house roll is HUGE and it tasted so refreshing with no sauce but needed just a dab of soy to accompany and bring out the flavours of the crab meat and DELICIOUS tamago (my favourite). The negihama, chopped scallop and ethnic salmon (spicy with green onion) all had large pieces of fresh seafood instead of chopped up mush bringing out the quality of their sashimi but the dab of wasabi in every roll was a little surprising for me. \\n\\nOverall, the prices are a little bit higher than other places but the deliciously fresh fish, kind service and no frills japanese style make it a good place for a sushi meal."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Our friends took us here as the first spot in Portland and it was a perfect way to start off!

I know they had already done this before switching venues, but I also like that they now offer a kid's meal, sides purchases separately, etc.  So we got a kids meal for the preschoolers, a side of mac'n'cheese (and seriously, it was the best I've ever had it today, like super ooey-gooey. I'm not sure that it's a good or bad thing that it's not consistently the same amazing, but it's always amazing.) for the baby, and a hot boneless meal for me (yum!).  I sat next to Ben from Spices Ltd and watched him turn red and bead up with sweat over the Holy. It was awesome.\\n\\nAnyway, my darling baby girl managed to break (at separate times!) the lid and the cup of my sweet kickstarter swag cup and they replaced it, no problem, and Joe, ever helpful (and attractive! and attentive, because he kindly asked about my husband!), mopped it up STAT.

Most of the times I bit into a piece thinking it was meat, it was just bone -- at the time, I thought we had just gotten a bad batch. However, when I told some of my friends who had eaten here as well, they all agreed that the chicken didn't have much meat either, which leads me to believe that they source their meat from some farm with malnourished chickens. There are definitely better places to get Korean fried chicken (Susanghan Pocha, Harue, or Doremi) so I won't be back. \\n\\nThe real shame is that Buford is missing an amazing Korean fried chicken place, but even if Hello is in a more convenient location for me, I'd rather make the drive to Duluth.

Do you want bigger tips?  Then please apply (and prepare to be weighed in) at Hapa Izakaya in Kits.  Right where the Urban Well used to be. \\n Note:  Please prepare to be hit on by all the annoying juice monkeys that used to frequent Cactus Club (and Urban Well for that matter). \\n\\n  Enter to the poorly pronounced \\"Irashaii ma se!!\\"  That's ok, i guess. The waitresses don't have to be Japanese, as long as the cooks were properly trained in Japanese cuisine...oh wait, you can't see into the kitchen. Perhaps another memo went out to all the cooks at Cactus Club, and Earls possibly, maybe Red Robin?  \\n\\nSake Please!   \\nHmm.  Momokawa seems to be the suggested house premium.  At 70$ a bottle it must be good.  Oh look, its made in Portland.   Hmm?   $70?   really?...  Look, they make sake at Granville Island, and it's a lot better than this.   If you're not going to sell 'proper' imported Sake, then why not stay local, cut down costs, and increase quality? O...k?\\n\\nSomething to eat then?  \\nNegitoro on toasted wonder bread? Are you serious?\\n Sixteen bucks for half of a king crab roll? \\n Duck confit with potatoes that tasted like fried potatoes (the entire dish tasted like fried potatoes, thats it).   \\nThe Karaage was good, so congratulations guys you nailed the fried chicken.  \\nThe salmon tataki salad was not bad, but you can get similar salmon sashimi at any Chinese/Korean sushi take out restaurant in town and just add your own lettuce for a fraction of the price they charge here.  \\n  I honestly tried a great deal of the menu.  For three people with 2 bottles of Sake my grand total including tip was $430. \\n  Before I left I went to the bathroom and was yelled at by two waitresses with rubber gloves and a mop.   Apparently some guy threw up all over the bathroom and seeing how I was also a man, I deserved being yelled at.  Stay outside!  All men are pigs!\\n \\n  Ok.  Ok.  I'm Greek, but I grew up more immersed in the Japanese culture than my own.  I speak a great deal more Japanese than I do  any other language apart from English.   One thing is for certain:  when you go to a quality Japanese restaurant, the service is always on the level; and by level I mean that its usually extraordinary.   \\n The service at Hapa reminded me of a trailer park KFC, as did the speech of the waitresses.   Don't get me wrong, I love hot chicks just as much as the next guy.  But F*&# off, Hapa is a joke.  In fact Cactus Club servers are far more polite and exceedingly more intelligent.   And no, there was no altercation or incident.  I simply sat like a good customer and ordered expensive food and drink all night long, and tipped very well despite everything.  \\n  Would I order negitoro and beef tataki at Earls, or Cactus Club, or anywhere other than a quality Japanese restaurant?   Hell no!\\n And this is why I will never go back to Hapa.   \\nMaybe Guu's still got it together.

For weeks I noticed the extensive lines on Saturday and Sunday early afternoons so I thought to myself this place has to be phenomenal. Naturally, seeing people wait for hours you would think the experience would be well worth it but unfortunately my experience there was not all that impressive. Firstly, its a decently sized restaurant but it has no waiting area or even a space to stand while you wait the 1 hour to 1.5 hours to be seated. This creates a congested area around the door all the way outside the restaurant and is disruptive to people eating by the entrance and in the windows. The decor is modern, trendy and neat all in one which makes for a good atmosphere hostess is polite but always seems to be extremely overwhelmed which someone sets a negative tone upon getting in. Once seated the servers are pretty efficient. They are quick to get waters and menus for the table. Its disappointing though because they are so busy it seems as though they just want your order and then to move on as fast as possible. The food is mediocre, my omelet was fine just nothing I would rave about but also nothing I would rant about. \\n\\nAll in all I think I might have hyped this place up to much for myself and was let down. I just thought that people who wait for over an hour to get seated were doing it for a reason.

The place seems to be getting worse.  I used to count on them, at the least, having great quality and very fresh fish. This was not the case this time. I can tell when the sashimi is old and has been frozen as opposed to when it's really fresh. I ordered a salad. Great that they brought back the ginger dressing, but my salad was soaked in it. I couldn't eat all of it because it was so drenched. I also ordered mostly sashimi. I got some Toro that tasted like it was about to turn and it didn't seem like good quality, melt-in-your-mouth toro, the way it should be. I also ordered hamachi sashimi that didn't taste fresh either. The ikura was pretty good. The scallop was good. Also got a salmon hand roll that was fresh.  The Seito roll didn't taste very good, I think because they no longer use the escolar and it makes a difference. Anyway... For a mediocre meal this cost me $100 with the tip. I did order 1 glass of wine and 1 cocktail, but $100 for one person is pretty outrageous unless the food is top notch.  Every time lately that o come here I say I won't go back, but I inevitably do because of the location. I will think long and hard before I blow my money here again.

My boyfriend and I spent a lovely day on the waterfront and decided on Thai food before heading home. We stopped here and it was happy hour which was great because we just wanted to share a meal. We were the only 2 people in the place. Mind you we have never been here before so we were trying to decide what to have. We were asking questions about the menu. When the waitress got very impatient with us and said \\" okay now you guys are just going back and forth so what do you want? I'm not going over this again\\". Again, we were the only two patrons in this restaurant. My boyfriend ordered the curry dish off of the happy hour menu and I ordered the Pad Thai dish off of the happy hour menu. She asked me if I wanted my pad thai medium or hot. I told her I wanted it hot because I really love spicy food. Then she proceeded to tell me that their hot was really really hot and that it was their policy that if you ordered it hot it could not be returned to the kitchen because it was \\"too hot\\". So I said I guess I'll just take it medium. My boyfriend said take it easy on her and don't burn her face off with the hot before she left the table. Our food was delivered and the first bite burned my lips so bad that I could not eat anymore. My boy friend said there's no way it could be that hot when I ordered medium so he took a bite and broke out in a sweat so bad that he couldn't even eat his own meal. I feel like this was done intentionally because the lady is mean spirited and inpatient. This was truly one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. It ruined our day and ruined our meal. This was a waste of money. When we were paying the check my boyfriend asked her for some rice thinking that I could mix it in with the pad thai to kill the heat. When she brought the rice to the table she looked at me with a smirk on her face and said  \\"Oh was it too spicy for you?\\" Needless to say for the first time in either of our lives we did not leave a tip.

The saltiness of shredded nori on top really complimented the earthy BBQ flavour, and the sauce was fabulous when it all got mixed in with the rice. \\n\\nSo I say to you, lineup-lovin' Vancouverites - step away from the herd fighting for a spot at the block's other iconic spots and eat your fill and begone and on with your life."},{"name":"Tropical Cuisine","address":"4899 Old National Hwy","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Best in Atlanta! \\nI've eaten at quite a few Caribbean restaurants,, but tonight's meal by far was the best. \\n\\nThe location leaves much to be desired, but it should not deter you from going in and at least ordering to go.

The curried shrimp were large and consisted of 8 pieces. The rice and peas were placed in one side compartment of the tray as well as in the main space with the shrimp.

Perhaps when Mike's first opened, it was great, but since then it's become so commercialized and filled with tourists that the quality has seriously gone down. Modern rules over Mike's cannoli any day, every day. \\n\\nIf you've claimed to have done a taste test comparing Mike's and Modern and have already been biased with people around you saying that Mike's is better or *the* place to go in the North End, chances are that you're going to prefer Mike's even if the taste of Modern's cannoli is better. I've done blind taste tests on my friends, who have all said that they preferred the Modern cannoli. Why? Mike's cannoli is pre-filled with ricotta filling (WHY?), which means that by the time it gets to you, it's already soggy and the crunch of the cannoli cookie has diminished. That, and the filling tastes commercial, like cheap ricotta filling that might have been mixed with lard. It doesn't have that rich yet subtle, creamy, and semi-sweet taste that Modern has. \\n\\nI will say, though, that the chocolate dipped cannoli are better than the plain ones (it prevents the cannoli from getting soggy and the chocolate taste overpowers the boring ricotta-lard taste), and I like the tiramisu here.

The meal came out promptly and my pizza was outstanding...and really was pretty close to what I remembered from my days of living in mid-town New York years ago.  Her chicken was served over pasta and she said it was very good...So, I had to agree that this is hidden 5 star jewel of a place in a very unlikely location.  If you are heading to the track, or are near the airport, stop in.

And it was our favorite place. Always super good food (as with every chipotle) and they always seem to let their hand slip with a little extra meat and rice. But the best part is the female worker with the grayish purple hair (we never actually got her name which is sad). They were all about customer service, but she took the cake. Whenever we walked in she would immediately start our food before we even got to the front. She even paid for 4 customers plates once because the cashier was taking too long in the bathroom and paid for my meal once because they put sour cream on it (like wow i was just gonna ask you to scoop it off haha :)).

It all has chicken broth in it, even the 'Veggie Rolls' have been cooked in chicken broth.\\" There's nothing on the menu description that explains this, nor is this included in the entree titles. Veggie Stir Fried Rice, and Veggie Roll should mean made of vegetables, right?

We were left scrambling and picked The Little Donkey. We'd had a very late lunch there once and it seemed good enough.\\n\\nWe arrived on time in the middle of a heatwave and were shown to our table. I was very warm from the walk and it took me a little while to realize there was no A/C. When I asked about that the reply was \\"Oh yes, it failed yesterday. They were working on it all last night and this morning [apparently without success].\\" We discussed abandoning Donkey and finding another restaurant but we realized it would be too exhausting to walk up and down Central Square in this heat looking for one so we decided to stay on.\\n\\nI took a sip of water. It was lukewarm. We had one of those trendy glass bottles of water on the table but no ice. I looked around. No tables had any iced water. Eventually our waitress appeared with a small carafe of ice and water. She topped up our [plastic] water glasses and then left with the iced carafe. We got one more top up during our stay. I realized that this was a restaurant that valued style over substance--stick with the program, plastic glasses and lukewarm water--even if your customers were actually close to fainting from the heat.\\n\\nI looked around for fans, thinking how several of those big ones as seen in T stations would move the air around nicely but no fan of any size was to be seen.\\n\\nThe food? There was an interminable list of specials with all the garnishes detailed in full and we'd forgotten what the first item was by the time we reached the second; two menus, one for an expensive raw bar and the other for a bunch of primarily seafood tapas--a sort of very busy Asian fusion. It struck me that the food was assembled rather than cooked; assembled very beautifully with fine knife-work but little melding of flavors.\\n\\nSome kudos to our waiter, who, even though she didn't know that Citadelle was a French gin not London Dry, was willing to write down my recipes for various Negroni variations and strong-arm the bartender so that fairly exact versions appeared. But in general, aside from our own waiter, the service was fairly curt and brusque with drinks and plates often being plunked down by a passing waiter who didn't break their stride as they swept by--or the exact opposite, where the waiter would butt into our conversation while they \\"helpfully\\" pointed out and described each component or garnish of the dish. I have long since given up trying to wave waiters away and shorten this soliloquy. I endure it with poor grace and then go back to our conversation. If I want to know what I am eating, dammit, I'll ask.\\n\\nAll up it was $266 for 4 before tip, without a dessert and not swimming in booze either. Not too out of line but still at the pricey end.\\n\\nAnd we left, to discover that it was much cooler outside as we wistfully thought of those large station fans.\\n\\nWhere did this restaurant absolutely fail? The food was OK; well-prepared and generally tasty. But it failed in the way it didn't handle the failure of its A/C. Mechanical failures can't be helped, especially in heatwaves, but as we met the hostess we should have been informed--\\"By the way our A/C isn't working...\\" followed by a sincere apology and perhaps the offer of an alternative rather than just being led to a table. The owner/chef should have peeled a few hundreds off his roll and gone to Home Depot to buy some big fans and carafes suitable for iced water--then raided a Seven/Eleven for all of its ice. They should have arranged for each table to get a free drink or dessert \\"compliments of the chef\\"--curiously enough they had 6 or 7 ice-creams and a sorbet on the dessert menu so offering a free one of those would really have hit the spot.\\n\\nBut instead, The Little Donkey sans A/C was indistinguishable from The Little Donkey avec A/C--except the former ruined our evening. Where were the owner/chefs? On vacation, or too confident to think that they needed to react to this heatwave in a way as creative as their food."},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Fabulous night with friends.

Believe me it did not disappoint. I arrived shortly around noon and within 15 minutes this place was packed with people!\\n\\nWhen you enter they have paper menus for you to pick up and decide what you want to eat. I happened to be standing near an employee and I asked what's good here. I was told to order the Northstar burger that comes with a tossed salad. \\n\\nThe menu has \\"Vs\\" by center dishes which means that the item can be prepared meat and dairy free. Such was my burger. You are in a line and then the next available cashier takes your order. The menu lists cocktail drinks only but regular drinks are available if you ask for them. in my case I asked for iced tea and I was given a glass full of ice to take to one of those self serve dispensers of soda and separate ones for tea.\\n\\nYou are given a number card and then sit anywhere you like while they prepare your food and then bring it to your table. On the side I noticed they have magazines to read or purchase. As I was waiting for my meal I went and got my tea. I had a choice of either green tea or a black tea.  All the stuff that you might pair with it are over there-almost like at Panera bread. So you can go back for refills as often as you like.\\n\\nI got my food and my burger was served open face. It consisted of beets, black beans and rice. It was topped with cheddar, kale, tomato, pickle and onion. This burger was one of the best I had ever tasted. You could really taste the beets throughout! It was a bit messy but very filling and full of flavor.\\n\\nI had heard their chocolate cookie being a sell out so I decided to buy them to take home while they still had them. At only $3.00 you get this huge cookie. I had a little of it and it was so good I knew I couldn't finish it there. I found that I could just order it from the bar area instead of getting back in line.\\n\\nThey also serve pizza and caught a glimpse of their sausage pizza at another table. It looked so inviting! \\n\\nYour' average menu item is around $14.00 whether you are ordering a sandwich and side or pizza or a full salad of a Thai bowl.\\n\\nThe bar area does not show their drinks, brews, or specialities but they are listed on the menu.\\n\\nThis place also serves breakfast and from looking at the menu they serve weekend brunch.\\n\\nI really enjoyed my visit here and my advice as always is to try to get there early in order to beat the crowds.

We had been here before and it wasn't great. After seeing posts on Instagram about a new chef and new food, we decided to go back and give it a try. From the top- the hostess said absolutely nothing to us, dropped our menus on the table and was gone. The first server to come to our table told us her name and that she would be right with us. About 10 minutes later, another server came to the table and told us her name and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered our beers and food at this point because we had been ready to order for a while. My husbands beer was less than exciting and I ordered a Creature Comforts Tritonia, which was the only good part of our meal. Our pretzel came and was burnt on the outside and dough on the inside. When the server FINALLY came back to ask how it was, we sent it back and didn't receive an apology or offer to remake/replace of any kind. My husbands wings were ICE COLD and my pizza was just okay, but with a very burnt crust. The server never came back so we had to flag down another guy. Again, no apology or offer to replace. Our beers had been empty for 15 minutes at this point with still no sight of our server. She finally came with the check. She never offered another beer or dessert or anything and we were never spoken to by a manager. We both work in restaurants and this is just absolutely ridiculous. Maybe instead of trying to make your menu look quirky and cool by adding things like \\"unicorn puke\\" and \\"dope cucumbers\\" and referring to your employees as the guy that \\"rides the cannibus to school\\", you could actually focus your time on training your staff and perfecting your menu without cheapening your food with clever phrases.

And it is also a LOT of fun with a lot of options, depending on what you're looking to do. It is broken down into three areas, The Westside, The Marketplace, and Pleasure Island. I believe Pleasure Island used to be only for 21 and up, and you had to pay a cover charge to get in. Not anymore, all three areas are wide open for anyone to walk through. Although I did see a few bars, there aren't really anymore nightclubs, and it's more family friendly, as I saw a LOT of kids and families walking through, even later at night.\\nThe area is basically nothing but restaurants and shopping, with a few other establishments thrown in. For the chain restaurants, look for Planet Hollywood and House of Blues. Wolfgang Puck has a few restaurants, and there's also the T. Rex, and a few other high end places. For shopping, there's a ton of Disney stores spread out throughout the area, with candy stores and tobacco stores mixed in. There's even a Cirque du Soleil show and virtual theme park!\\nMy girlfriend and I went here the other weekend. We had planned on spending the evening at Epcot, but a nasty thunderstorm switched our plans, and we decided to go out to Downtown Disney, as it's open later. We took the bus from our hotel (free) to Downtown Disney (free), and had a lot of fun! We got a margarita after walking in, and since you're allowed to carry drinks with you as you walk around, we went window shopping, watched some of the free entertainment (there were some jazz bands playing in the center of the marketplace), and looked at all the menus of the restaurants to decide where to eat. We ended up eating, then doing some bar hopping and enjoying a few drinks.\\nOverall, I hadn't planned on going to Downtown Disney, but was pleasantly surprised as it put a nice cap on a great Disney weekend. The place is free, there's lots to do if you're with your family, or with friends. It's certainly not worthy of spending an entire day there, but if you're looking for a nice, fun, relaxing night out, this is definitely your place.

Forewarning caveat: this following review comes from a man who has little to no interest in confectionary or pastries.\\n\\nWe decided to get an original cannoli and lobster tail from here and mikes as a taste test seeing as these two places come highly regarded.\\n\\nDecor: has a old time Italian American eatery feel, casual with table service (unlike mikes). They tie their boxes in red and white string (in contrast to mikes blue and white). Not very crowded with plenty of tables. From the signage on the wall asking customers to kindly only eat their pastries I get the feeling taste tests of the two are often conducted on the premises.\\n\\nFood: the canoli was nice, never having had one of these Italian American staples before I was pleasantly surprised. The filling was tasty on the first couple of bites, then the realisation kicks in that there's another four inches of pastry to go. Now this is where my dislike of pastries may be influencing the experience. Each bite felt like torture, the initially tasty and soft filling turning into a sticky greasy paste in your mouth. The little flames of pastry sticking between your teeth. Then the lobster roll was revealed, perhaps I was looking the other way when it was purchased but it was much larger than I had anticipated, more of a mermaids flipper than a crustacean themed cream cake. Now a tried my best and this is not to say mikes did a whole lot better - that review is coming later - but I really struggled with this one. Eventually I caved and pretended to have a stomach ache and focused intently on the news programme on the wall-mounted tv to get out of eating the rest of it.\\n\\nDrinks: a good selection of Italian cafe drinks, our espresso definitely hit the caffeine spot. \\n\\nOverall: I think like all the other sheep I'll have to go with mikes being the superior north end pastry."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Happy as a clam....or should I say a oyster!!

We quickly were served a pile of hot mini doughnuts stacked on top of each other and three dipping sauces: chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. I dipped one side in vanilla and one side in strawberry- delish! Crisp on the outside, soft inside. Of course it was greasy but it didn't  *taste* greasy which is important. So light I could have eaten them all myself.\\n\\nFriend got the eggs sardu? Or something. Poached eggs served on fresh artichoke cup bottom, creamed spinach topped with hollandaise and side of potatoes. I tasted her creamed spinach it was super flavorful- not bland like most creamed spinach I've had.\\n\\nMy dish: First off- I wasn't a big fan of the coffee. It was slightly too acidic. I got the crab eggs benedict- I'm a total fool for a benedict! I have to say- the english muffins were a bit tiny and flat- i prefer a spongier eng. muffin. The poached eggs were divine. There was a very small serving of white lump crab sprinkled on top of the eggs. The smell of the crab hit me instantly and it was kinda fishy but once I started eating it was fine. I could have had double the crab but at $14 I think it was a pretty fair serving. The hollandaise looked \\"homemade\\"- it was creamy and fluffy and not too neon yellow or soupy. One absolutely unforgiveable item was the grits!! They were awful. Hence I had to deduct a star. Absolutely yuck. Cheddar cheese grits: pasty and cold. Possibly made early that morning. Did not taste like a good authentic stone ground grit.\\n\\nI definitely want to come back and taste something from the regular menu.

Overall pleasant experience we will be back again soon."},{"name":"Tuscan Grill","address":"361 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"Upon entering I found myself in a cramped front area. A laptop was perched on the front table top. I could have easily stolen it considering I was waiting for 5 minutes before I finally stood in the dining area while the entire staff stood in the back chatting. I initially thought the staff were happy diners until I realized they preferred to goof off in the back instead of doing their jobs.\\n\\nWhen I was finally noticed a waitress looked spooked and exclaimed \\"someone's here!\\" and slinked back into the abyss for a different staff member to help me. A host (?) came up front with no apology for the delay. He then proceeded to wipe down 5 menus for my table in front of me. I know this is a minor thing but it kind of annoyed me that they didn't do this before opening for the night. Why should I have to wait any longer to get seated? When I was shown the table I sat down, leaving the menus on the table with the laptop because the host should bring those over to you. I also wanted to see if/when they would bring them to me. After a few minutes the host finally picked them up and placed them at each table setting.\\n\\nThe waiter arrived to see if I wanted a drink order. This happened about 2 seconds after the host handed me a menu. I just asked for water since I had absolutely no time to even glance at the menu. When the water was filled I was asked again if I wanted a drink. I declined after viewing the menu since I had a feeling no one there knew how to properly make a cocktail.\\n\\nWhen the rest of my party arrived I moved to a chair outside of the booth. This seat was a terrible place to be due to what I believe to be a completely inexperienced waiter. He was nice enough but seemed nervous and possibly stoned. He was constantly giggling and saying sorry for his mistakes. Every time he came over he hovered directly to my right, often carrying plates and at one point he had steak knives inches from my head. I had to keep leaning and ducking out of fear of having a hot plate touch my head or being stabbed.\\n\\nIt seemed to take forever to place drink, appetizer and entree orders, however it didn't take too long for the food to come out. When we asked for extra dressing for the garden salad we were given a side of caesar dressing, not the balsamic that it comes with. We also asked for butter for the bread and were given a few cuts of cold butter from a stick. Not the most horrible thing in the world but it really shows the lack of preparation and presentation. I'm not a fan of butter packets, but they would have been preferred. I mean it sucks when I can say Olive Garden does a better job with bread and butter.\\n\\nWhen ordering my entree I asked if I could have my mashed potatoes without scallions and was told no because they were already prepared. This was disappointing because it seems my mashed potatoes should be made to order. I'm wondering how old they were before I got them since we were one of the first people for the night.\\n\\nWhen the entrees came out I received mine first. I had ordered the 1/2 chicken that supposedly was marinated in thyme and lemon. It was hard to tell if this was true because the chicken was covered in a half inch of black char. I'm not sure how they cooked the chicken, but I certainly wasn't expecting something that looked like it had been burned with a flame thrower. I waited about 5 minutes before the rest of my party was served, but I had a feeling that my food would still be warm due to it's char encasement.\\n\\nEveryone else received their dishes in the same charred presentation as mine. The other orders were lamb chops and hanger steak. Steak knives were not initially provided to any of us and we had to ask the waiter. A serious DUUUH moment on his end. This was also the moment I almost had my brain stabbed by 4 knives.\\n\\nWe laughed at the quality of our meal and joked about how the scraps weren't even good enough for the dogs. I also feel the need to point out every entree came with broccoli rabe, which the waiter didn't know how to pronounce. This seems incredibly lazy on the chef's end, but laziness seemed to be a big theme for the evening so I can't knock them for not being consistently shitty.\\n\\nWe nearly ran out of that place even though it was my father's birthday and we almost always order dessert on our birthdays. Before I left I noticed only 2 other tables had diners in them. Not a good sign for a Friday night. I can honestly say I will never eat here again, though I doubt this place will remain open under these conditions for much longer."},{"name":"Cafe Pamplona","address":"12 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"More memories... undergrads sitting in their own smoke clouds (wait! that was before Cambridge banned smoking indoors!), tiny cups of espresso, poetry being written and read and recited... low ceilings.

Plain. Same with the fries. I sampled them. The burgers and fries at Red Robin are way, WAY better and bigger and way less expensive, too. My kid's lettuce wraps were okay she said, but she really had her heart set on the sushi cones. Someone eventually brought me the salad dressing I wanted (but not the dinner plate. I asked to keep the tiny plate that the ramekin of dressing was brought to the table on, and I just used that tiny plate for my portion of the salad). The salad was terribly disappointing: the hard boiled eggs were good, as was the avocado, but the bacon was ice cold and stale, and the cooked salmon on top was also ice cold and over-cooked and rubbery. My kid was so starving by the time we got it that she ate it (as did I), but it was not great. And it cost $19!\\n\\nHere's the kicker: the server twice came to our table to say \\"good news!\\".... she was \\"able to take the charge off our bill for the Mosaic dip\\".... (this is verbatim). The second time she said this, I had to respond, well, of course you did, we never got the dish and we didn't eat the dip, it was never brought to us! The second time she came by she had the extra dinner plate (by then I was done with my portion of the salad). She apologized again for all the mishaps, repeatedly saying how none of it was her fault (i.e., she wasn't told that sushi cones weren't available, she wasn't told how the appetizer was brought to the wrong table, she has no idea why salsa was brought to us with the salad - but hey, she got the dip taken off our bill!). \\n\\nWhen we asked for the bill, she came with the credit card machine, knowing we'd want to pay and get out of there ASAP. As I was looking over the bill ($76! Not including the tax. For a VERY sub-par meal and experience), she tried to make small talk with my husband, asking if we're from around there. Hubby said we just moved here from Seattle, to which she asked if we were \\"escaping Trump\\". AWKWARD! Granted, we surely are NOT Trump fans, but how would she know that? She had no idea what our political predilections are. For all she knew, we were die-hard Republicans. It was just inappropriate. Bad form. \\n\\nFrom the service to the food, this was our worst dining experience in Vancouver. And it wasn't inexpensive, either.

Unfortunately, a place like this makes a lot of money on the unknowing. We bought small ricotta cakes, sfoitelli, pignoli cookies and almond biscotti. We spent approximately $55. When home we were all hungry for some delicious Italian sweets and boy, were we disappointed. Everything tasted like it was made days before-- yes, days before. Stale bites with no flavor at all. We threw everything in the garbage and I felt very embarrassed as I was the one suggesting we go there! My Italian friends were shocked that Americans could think this was quality Italian sweets.

We had a hard time getting past their chairs to get to our seats and they were not able to walk past us without grazing our table.  They were expecting people so every couple minutes we would have to squeeze into the wall of the booth so they wouldn't bump into us. We ended up moving our drinks because they would have been knocked over if they had been anywhere near the end of the table.   Our server couldn't even get to our table very well and had to do everything over my Boyfriends shoulder.

What I found seems to back the traditional findings: at Mike's you pay 50 cents more but it is proportionally bigger and has minutely better presentation (aside from the size and different shaped chocolate chips, they appear identical). As the Modern ones aren't pre-filled, their crust is crispier. Whether or not you prefer this is entirely a matter of taste, it really made no difference to me in my enjoyment of the cannoli's. For some reason Mike's seems more \\"fun\\" to be inside of though, as sometimes a gentle chaos is nice. Ultimately, both cannolis are five star worthy, the debate is pointless, and the superior establishment is whichever one has a shorter line when you arrive.

I also never cease to be amazed by how ignorant, arrogant, demanding, self centered and snotty people can be.  This place is underrated and doesn't deserve the knocks it's received.\\n\\nThe whole point of the umami concept is something is perfectly balanced  so flavor jumps out at you which is why they don't allow substitutions on the umami pizzas.  Simply reading the menu will enlighten anyone who has any ability to think outside of themselves for a freakin minute.  So if you want to try the umami pizzas take them or leave them as-is and don't mess with it.  Otherwise order a regular pizza.\\n\\nService was great, our waitress was super friendly so people need to get a drink and just daggum relax on their big patio, the world does not revolve around you.  BTW, don't ever go to Europe or just stick with fast food if you want instant service.  They have a decent drink menu with some good local beers to choose from.  They have wine and cocktails too but I was just interested in beer.  They also have locally made sodas and the Coke equivalent was better than Coke.\\n\\nWe got the umami little piggy pizza and it was quite good, never would have thought of fried carrots on a pizza but it works, it had a surprisingly good stand out flavor.

She made several recommendations and showed an active interest.\\n\\nWe ordered 8 pizzas, 2 helpings of fried mozzarella (which came with super-stellar pickles), a few drinks and the mac-n-cheese (with a great jalapeno flavor). At half price, the food was more than satisfying. UM's pizzas are not about the crust, so much as the toppings. My favorite pizza was the prosciutto-fig-arugula: very well balanced in salt vs. sweet and generous with the toppings. The meat pizza lived up to its name, but rather than umami, it was intensely salty. The mushroom pizza had very few mushrooms, so it was a slight disappointment. \\n\\nOverall, I think UM is off to a great start. Great for groups, fast / friendly / active service,  and a cheerful Google-esque makeover of the previously dark decor.

I also had a side of eggs which were fluffy and generously spiced with black pepper so if you're not a fan of black pepper take note!  The server was very nice and provided recommendations but it would often take a while for him to circle back to us.  We were there for an hour and were served 48 minutes in which meant I had to run out after rushing my meal a bit due to the 1 hour limit on street parking.

I went to this place for a team dinner with about 10 other people. The place had a pretty chill feel to it, it's definitely more of a place to eat with friends and/or to grab some drinks as it can get quite noisy. A darker ambient setting like most restaurants these days and aside from the dining area, there was a bar area with TV's showing sports. The menu probably isn't anything unique -- you have your steaks and seafood, but you do have about half the menu for sushi. The table had calamari as an appetizer and it wasn't bad. For dinner I had swordfish topped with some shrimp and shared an order of their dragon roll.\\n\\nFrom what I have heard about swordfish, I was expecting the fish to be dry, but it wasn't bad! Not as moist as other fishes and still tender. My coworker kept telling us to not order the sushi so I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I think it was alright. Although, I did feel that the rice was too mushed together (to the point where you can't see the grains anymore), but there are probably better places to have sushi in Atlanta. And now onto dessert.. I had the key lime pie which I thought was good, not too sweet or tart and fluffy. But what you must try is their bread pudding.. now that was delicious!

One of the girls in our party had enough and refused to pay for her margarita... which I don't blame her she was halfway through dinner before they brought it to the table. No apology, no manager to the table, nothing. They knew with 11 in our party they were guaranteed a tip... so why bother? \\n\\nThird, half of our table ordered shrimp tacos. They were so spicy they could barely even eat them.

A pastry challenge of sorts - Mike's vs. Modern vs. Maria's.\\nIve done this with donuts - why not Italian baked goods?\\nTo be as close to fair as I could - I decided I would get one cannolli at each place. The plan was one plain cannolli. So I could compare apples to apples. Or cannolli to cannolli, as it were.\\n\\nMy take:\\n\\n***Modern - Solid 5 Star!***\\nModern is far smaller than Mike's, and with only a small fraction of the baked good on display. More retail offerings (imported coffees, mugs, \\"grab and go\\" pre-wrapped baked goods, etc.) than Mike's and a very cozy atmosphere. Cannolli are filled to order. Your choice of 3 shells, 4 fillings, assorted toppings. I went with the plain shell, traditional ricotta filling and powdered sugar on top. It was a bit smaller than Mike's - but that's not a bad thing. It was a proper serving size for one!\\nThe filling - OMG perfection! Thick, creamy ricotta with just barely a hint of sweetness. THIS is the cannolli filling I fantasize about.\\nThe shell - similar texture and flavor as Mike's - but thinner, so breaking it was not a problem.\\nThe coworker had a filled zeppoli with vanilla creme. She really enjoyed it - and was able to eat it without logistical issues. Yay!\\nAs with Mike's, our timing was impeccable. Only a few ahead of us in line, no problem getting a table - and when we left - the line was WAY out the door.\\n\\n***Mike's - 3.5 Stars, Rounding up to 4!***\\nThis is definitely the most tourist friendly of the three. I was warned about long lines - but being there on a mid day Thursday while it was snowing kept tourists at bay.  Our timing was perfect - only a couple people in front of us - and no problem getting a table. It started filling up and lines extending as we were finishing up. Smells the way I expect a bakery to smell - lots of flour and sweet in the air. Visually, the most impressive of the three bakeries. Several cases of Connolly, cakes, butter cookies, cupcakes, puzzles, biscuit - an overwhelming variety. And THIRTEEN varieties of Connolly! Cruel to provide that many options! This was the first stop - and temptation did me in. So much for plain - I ordered the chocolate ricotta cannolli. \\nThe filling - WAY sweet! And from other reviews - still not as sweet as the creme filled. Even separating out the level of sweet the chocolate brought, this was sugar overload. The texture was great, the size was ginormous - but I couldn't even finish half of it...this was just way more sugar than I can possibly handle at one sitting.\\nThe shell - very nicely done. A wee bit thicker than I'd like - I really had to slam my plastic fork into it to get it to break. But the flavor was impeccable.\\nMy coworker ordered the Boston Creme Puff. The chocolate shell on top was too hard to navigate with plastic fork AND knife. The server who brought the pastries and drinks to our table instructed her to turn it upside down and eat from the bottom. The flavors were great - but she was quite frustrated it was that difficult to eat a pastry, and gave up on the pastry and chocolate, throwing over half the item away.\\n\\n***Maria's - 4 Star!***\\nMaria's is TINY! If there are 6 customers in the store, they'll be sardines. Luckily - we were the only ones there. We didn't have any more room for food (or sugar) - so we decided to get our items to go and eat them later.\\nAs with Modern - cannolli are filled to order. Choice of shell, choice of filling. I ordered a plain shell with plain ricotta filling, the coworker decided to make hers the same as mine.\\nThe filling - solid! The flavor was every bit as good as Modern, but not quite as thick. But great texture overall - I would never pass one of these up.\\nThe shell - PERFECTION!

THREE things offended me about this place tonight, one was especially disappointing....\\n\\nWhen I first sat down at the table, I was overcome and overwhelmed by the noxious odor of windex or some kind of chemical cleaner. While I appreciate a clean, fresh table between parties, I found the odor nauseating and unappetizing. I tried to ignore it, knowing my family has raved about the food until the bread baskets came out. I have heard that restaurants tend to reuse bread inconspicuously between tables, which is gross in itself, but often restaurants hide it better. The bread was cold and stale. \\n\\nLastly, the worst offense was when my father reached for his bread plate and was cut by a small shard of GLASS...ON HIS PLATE. He was instantly bleeding. My dad did not want to make a big deal about it, but to me, this is unacceptable. Heaven forbid this was ingested, the shard sliced his thumb open and the waitress didn't even bat an eye. She didn't apologize and she didn't seem to care. She tossed over a band aid and some napkins and asked for our orders. \\n\\nThe ONLY reason this restaurant gets 2 stars from me instead of -2, is because the food is pretty good (above average general Italian; average Italian for Boston's North End)--sans glass shards.

At the same time, we asked about chips and salsa (we were not sure is they came automatically) before we had a chance to view the menu.  The server started into a weird \\"explanation\\" that because they had [maybe] lost money on Groupons, they now charge for them.  We ordered some for the parents' and kids' table.  Then we looked at the menu and saw that they were $8 each.  WTF!  We all asked ourselves if we should leave but we didn't because we had our drinks coming...bad choice again.  ALL the menu options are overpriced by 20-30%.  I thought that maybe it was because they overcompensate with large portions.  We were not looking to eat heavy, so the two adult couples and a pair of kids shared entres (chimichanga, steak tacos, and fish tacos) and the other two kids got simple kids meals.  The food was not just bland but tasted like it was likely all frozen.  On top of this, portion size was not just undewhelming but scant.  The chimi ($13-14) did not come with sides and the tacos came with beans that were in cups barely larger than the small ones for ketchup.  We had ordered extra side for our kids that shared a meal and it was the same.  Another punch in the gut was when we gave each kid a couple dollars each for the game room while we waited for food.  They put a dollar in the token dispenser and got one token.  ONE TOKEN PER DOLLAR!  The total lunch bill for two families of 4 (4 adults and 4 kids under 12) in which entres were split was a whopping $130.  This included 18% gratuity, but this is a straight up rip off.

It has one unbelievably large television as well as at least 10 other TVs surrounding the entire bar. During major plays this place is rocking and it is awesome to be in front of that type of a crowd and atmosphere during these sports games. The burgers are excellent and are all between 6 and 9 dollars. The breakfast burger is particularly amazing with angus beef, bacon, fried egg, crispy potatoes, melted pepperjack & spicy mayo on an onion roll. I also like the buffalo wings but they are not as good as the burgers. The fried chicken sandwich and the buffalo chicken sandwich are also quite good. This place is quite popular but it has enough seats that it can support a large crowd so you almost always can find a table to sit and you will have a solid amount of choices including very comfortable booths. The service is quite good expect for the fact that they often take a long time to bring the check. The food comes quickly and the servers come around to ask if you need anything. However, at times have waited a whole half hour for the check to come even after asking repeatedly for it. Other then bringing the check everything about this place is fantastic.

Yes, it's not the Four Seasons but it's half the price and way more relaxed.   If you stay here pay whatever the extra cost is for a lake view.   The view of Austin is terrific and makes an incredible difference in how you feel about your room.  Rooms were nice and plenty of room (I would have like a microwave to heat my starbucks!).  As for hotel views, the lake view is clearly the one to get.  One of the three sides of the hotel looks out over a park (nice) and the other looks at a new condo construction site (not so nice). If you can, book a room with a lake view on the 16th floor.  Its the one floor with balconies and on a nice day it would be great place for coffee or early evening drinks (think its about $30more for the 16th floor).  Would also be a great place to watch the bats as they emerge from under the bridge at dusk.  The hotel has great common areas (as most hyatt's do)   They have a nice patio for early evening drinks with good appetizers ( I highly recommend the edamame (char grilled) and a sushi roll) and a view of the lake.  Between 6 and 7 pm it gets crowded so show up a bit early.   Down the steps from the patio is the pool and next to the pool, the hiking/jogging trail that runs by the river (with canoe rentals, kayaks etc.   Its a short walk to congress avenue and there's lots of fun activity on south congress and a short walk across the bridge to other restaurants.   Parking is the only negative but no more so than other downtown hotels.   Self parking in the garage is $19/night and valet is $24 but just think of the valet as part of the room cost :)   The concierge (Molly) was really helpful.   She got us easter brunch reservations at the last moment and recommended some nice places for a casual dinner.     Unfortunately the first night we stayed we encountered some rude guests next door who stayed up until the wee hours of the morning.   I mentioned it to Molly the next day and she offered to switch rooms (we declined) and gave us some vouchers for Starbucks (in the hotel and open late which is a big plus for me).

This is just the right amount of time for my friends to find a couple new restaurants that they absolutely MUST try. This was the pick this time around. \\n\\nIt's good food, but pricey. There are cheaper places in the area that are just as good. \\n\\nFirst off - Parking: I hate parking in this area. I circled the block at about 5:45 and had so many issues finding parking. The lot North is patrolled by Diamond Parking Services, and they're a pain to deal with. The lots south of the building are private-ish. Some are reserved for customers, but I didn't see one for this restaurant. Some lots don't have signage, but a friendly neighbour informed me that he'd just seen somebody get towed. Towing companies are the worst. I finally managed to find an open spot in front of the restaurant, and I could hear the angels singing.\\n\\nFood: It was tasty. The cheese accompaniment is not worth the $5 additional price tag. The side dishes were good, but there were less of them than your usual Korean restaurant. The seafood pancake was delicious, as was the cold soba noodle soup dish. The spicy duck soup was also good, but was very pricey given the quantity. \\nHint - add some water to the broth as it's pretty salty. \\n\\nService: It was decent. I have no real complaints, except that being stuck in the corner, it was hard for them to see us when we needed service. They were also able to give both the total for dinner as well as the price when divided between all the parties."},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I ordered the ribeye.

The food was absolutely AWFUL on the first day: cold, soggy, under-seasoned, and so-on. But that is to be expected when everything on the menu is only $1 and there are like 50+ people ordering food all at once. Plus, I was turned off because a vegan food truck had a secret \\"carnivore\\" menu. Very happy they did away with that.\\n\\nBut I wanted to give them a chance because I loved the idea of vegan Mexican food that isn't smack in the middle of downtown or a more \\"hip\\" type area that a lot of plant-based peeps flock to. I work at a clinic on OBT and let me tell you that it is NOT the nicest area at all. But the fact that a vegan company is trying to plant roots in this underserved community is definitely due some props. So with that, I tried them out again, and again, and again. Still wasn't that great but they continuously improved each time I went. \\n\\nNow when they took a whole month off? They're food became DELICIOUS. Seriously, the new mission burrito is my go-to. Black beans (seasoned waaaay better than before), rice, plantains, and a dope sauce that can send you to the shadow realm is what makes this burrito amazing. I've also tried their new jackfruit tacos, avocado ice cream, and stuffed plantains. Only quip I have is that the tacos are veeeeery small for what they charge them for. I got two tacos and a deep fried stuffed plantain and it cost me like $14+ and i literally finished the food in like 3 minutes. That was a little ridiculous in my opinion but I get that vegan food is more expensive to produce. \\n\\nMission kitchen, I'm super proud of you all and the awesome food you're serving to this community.

However, neither this place, nor that place, cut it for me anymore. Why? Probably the broth, it's sort of flavorless or flavor-light in my opinion. \\n\\nWhen I read that certain places \\"simmer their pho broth at a very precise temperature for a full 24 hours\\" I have to laugh out loud. You can't just heat water all day and expect it to taste different in the morning!\\n\\nBut I digress. The pho here isn't bad, though it might seem a lot better when compared to other bad pho places.

I ordered the blackened tilapia which is supposed to come on a bed of rice, but they were out of it so I got 2 sides of the \\"oven baked mac and cheese\\" and a side of yams. When our food arrived his ribs were burnt so he brought it up to the waiter. He asked them to change it out with brisket which they did and they were fine. My food was really good but the \\"oven baked mac &cheese\\" taste like box mac and cheese and was made with bow tie noodles instead of elbows( I thought that was a little different but not a big deal). \\n\\nThe 2nd visit I ordered the blackened tilapia and my BF decided not to get anything. After ordering I waited for about 20 minutes (not that busy at all) for a to go order and after getting home 10 minutes later the sides were ice cold but the fish was still warm.

I ordered a plate of ribs and brisket for the BF and tilapia for me. I even asked them if it was possible to get the rolls instead of the cornbread muffins this time and they argued with me that they never had either of those forms of bread, and they only give white or wheat slices. I eventually said okay and left it alone even though I knew I was right. It was raining so I was concentrating on getting to my car and getting the food home to eat. Once we opened it the BF's plate had only 3 really burnt ribs and 2 dried out pieces of brisket. Seriously, this is what we get for $9? My mac & cheese was really cold and stuck together, so I decided not to eat it and the yams tasted like they have been sitting in maple syrup for about a week.

It seems like more locals go here. The space is cramped, and even though I know the staff is working super hard, it seems like it's slow b/c they fill the cannolis once you've order them. \\n\\nSo, Modern vs. Mike. Modern's is a little smaller, more dainty looking. (Don't remember the price comparison). I got the chocolate chip with ricotta filling from both in the plain shell. Modern uses smaller chocolate chips, so I think you can taste more of the chocolate with each bite. The filling from both are good, but slightly different. Mike's is richer and sugary and more deathly. You feel like a glutton. Modern's is creamier and less sweet (which I prefer). \\n\\nBoth are good. So, even though I like Modern's better.

We were informed that 5 dishes was what they recommended for 2 people so we chose the lamb BLT, the blowfish, the manti, the pickle brine fried chicken sandwich, and the the wild boar lasagna special. \\n\\nEverything was delicious and definitely took you on a journey all over the world from Middle eastern flavors from the manti, to Latin flavors in the blowfish. The lasagna and the chicken sandwich were probably our favorites. The fried chicken was super juicy and bursting with flavor from the pickle brine and slaw and the lasagna was rich and decadent with the flavorful bore meat and the oozing b√©chamel sauce. Although I will say that the lasagna was definitely not a small plate! It was pretty filling and we probably could have gotten away with ordering less dishes so maybe ask about the sizes of some of the specials. The plates are definitely not cheap for being small plates but portions are definitely pretty good for most dishes. So I guess I would say that you can definitely get away with ordering a little less especially if you're ordering the heavier meat based dishes like we did. \\n\\nDespite our extreme fullness we did try the cookie dough dessert and the churro ice cream sandwich, both of which did not disappoint. I will warn that the cookie dough is truly a massive serving of cookie dough, definitely good to share and you definitely need that whipped cream side to cut some of the richness of the straight cookie dough.

It's not that I hate their food, obviously. Otherwise I wouldn't have gone back, over and over through the years. It's just that their food IS consistently and noticeably greasier than most of the competition (with apologies to Muchas, which is a very strong contender as well, in this dubious category)..\\n\\n\\n\\nBottom Line: Rigoberto scores most of its points for value, speed of service, and of course, the up-all-night factor.

Once the cheese is sufficiently melted, you can begin eating.\\n\\nBasically you can think of it as a fondue, but with spicy meat. We went with the chicken which was good. Our only complaint was that the entirety of the dish leaned a little bit towards the salty side of things.\\n\\nWord to the wise, this is spicy stuff.

And it revealed the tomatoes origin- Canada! We quietly brought this to our waitresses attention, as to not upset the surrounding guests.

She said in this event, they do their best to substitute appropriately. With several nearby supermarkets, and it being summer in New England, we felt that their efforts fell short and the least they could do is buy local tomatoes, and explain when we ordered that not all tomatoes would be local heirlooms as described on the menu. We expected the appetizer to be compensated, or perhaps  a round of stiff drinks on the house. We received nothing but an apology.

I've eaten from here about once a week for the past 2 years, and it's always good.  Usually I get take out, which is always ready right when I get there.  They must know my voice since they've never asked my name or number, and know just what I got when I walk in.  I like to try different things each time, but I do have my stand-by's.  Which are the General Tso's Chicken, House Special Fried Rice, House Lo Mein (soft noodle), and the salt and pepper squid.  All of their hot pots are great, but should be eaten there since the firey presentation is part of the fun.  I've even gone with a group and had the pre fixe family feast, and everything was great.  They have a huge dining room with a separate banquet room, and even a separate lotto room.  It's a family business so kids are always welcomed by the super nice lady that runs the place.  There is even a table by the tv that is loaded with toys (intended for the little dude that waits for parents working, but he shares!)\\nThe service isn't exceptional, but it functions just fine.  Food always comes out fast and always tastes great.  Plus their menu is enormous, and they always have specials (but you have to read Chinese).  It's almost so big that it's overwhelming, but seems pretty traditional, and lots of seafood options.  The only thing I've gotten that I didn't like was the Vietnamese Sweet and sour soup.  It tasted like it was cooked in a cheap tin pot. The other soups I've tried were good, but I'd rather go for Pho, myself.  Stick to the entrees and you won't be disappointed.

In addition to cookies and pastries Mike's has great cakes like their cake with strawberries and whipped cream - perfect for a birthday celebration.  Some people say Mike's cannoli aren't as good as Modern's because they fill them with in advance but their turnover is so fast I don't think they get soggy.

I ordered what's supposed to be \\"matcha (green tea) ice cream slush\\" and I saw it sitting on the drinks counter for at least 15 minutes because no one went to get the drinks to our table. When I tasted it, it was gross too because it had no green tea taste, and obviously no ice cream because it was very icy/chunky and it tasted like it was blended with skim milk and water along with the ice. When I got the drink it was already separated, and to make the matter even worse, it had chunks of black, unknown pieces which could be from other drinks or the blender. It tells me that they don't clean their blenders very well. So when I asked for a re-make, I had to wait 20 more minutes and when I saw the new drink sitting on the counter, I really wanted to walk up to the drinks bar and just get it myself instead of waiting the drinks to taste separated again. It was also about 5 dollars including the 10% discount. I can imagine how much profits they are making by selling water slush for 5 dollars...maybe that's where they get the money to pay for the nice decor.\\n\\nOther people's food was also very horrible. The 3-cup chicken was not made properly as it doesn't taste like how it should. It tasted like they just put all the ingredients and the chicken in a pot and just boiled it. Again, it was lukewarm. Lastly the instant soup came, again it was horrible and cold too. One \\"combo\\" of instant salad, soup plus very horrible microwaved food for more than 10 dollars.\\n\\nAnd then we waited another 20 minutes to pay the bill. We saw a group of 6 that waited 20+ minutes and just left because they never got a server to take their order.\\n\\nUnless you want to waste your money and get in a very upset+bad mood, do. not. ever. come. here. Oh, and the good reviews are probably submitted by their employees or share holders...-shakes head-"},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Food is great, servings are tiny and very expensive, my meal for 2 with 2 glasses of wine came to $140 without tip.

My mom actually told me about this place before I even tried it. She buys their fish cakes from their retal shop next to Golden Swan to make at home!\\n\\nI've only been here a handful of times and Everytime there is a line! This place is busy but service is quick. I've tried their crab soup pho, the bbh and their regular pho as well and all have been great! Personal preference tho is their regular pho. The crab/seafood pho that they are known for is great but a little on the sweet side and I prefer my pho savory. My husband on the other hand says the crab soup pho is his all time fav! The crab soup is super flavourful with hints of sweetness from the tomatoes and crab. The BBH is good lots of herbs and spices but for me a little too sweet and not as spicy as I would like. Their regular pho broth is super flavourful! Not super salty where I'm having to reach for my tea cup every other bite. Since it's got no sweetness I can add as much chilli oil and Sriracha I like! The specialty noodles all come with the round rice noodles. If you prefer the pho noodle be sure to ask for it to be substituted! \\nSide note, you can turn your noodles into a combo and add a drink or spring/fresh rolls. Both the spring/fresh rolls were subpar in my opinion.

I thought it was time to finally write a review for Mandarin Cove. I've dined there a handful of times throughout this last year. I've always gone for lunch so keep in mind this review is a reflection of their lunchtime staff. \\n\\nAnyway... Mandarin Cove has the typical Chinese restaurant look and feel except the seating arrangement is very open and loud like a cafeteria. The menu has wonderful choices and is very reasonably priced as most dishes are plentiful and come with soup, a spring roll and tea. The staff appears to all be Chinese which also adds to the atmosphere.  For the last of the compliments I must state that I've always enjoyed every meal I've had there. Please keep this in mind when reading on.\\n\\nI've learned a valuable lesson from visiting Mandarin Cove. This lesson, is that you cannot properly review an establishment from visiting them only once or twice. \\n\\nFirst Visit... My first visit to Mandarin Cove was a great one. I ordered the #17 - House Special Chow Mein. This is a wonderful dish of lo-mein noodles stir-fried with beef, chicken, shrimp and vegetables. I ordered it (as they say) \\"3-Star Spicy\\" (scale 1-5=hot) since I wasn't sure what their idea of \\"spicy\\" was. It was delivered heaping on a large plate with a spring roll and had a mild yet noticeable amount of spiciness. I was really impressed. For the price I received a large plate of food filled with plentiful amounts of meats and veggies. I decided that I would have to return again.\\n\\nSecond visit... The #17 impressed me so much that I ordered it again. Feeling confident that I needed more spice, I ordered it \\"4-Star Spicy\\" this time. Being that the spicy scale is only 1-5, it should be a noticeable difference, and it was. When the food arrived it really good. It was spicy enough to clear the sinuses and break into a mild sweat but not overwhelmingly hot. I think I've found a winner. I'd also like to point out that typically the tea and soup is very good too. So overall my second visit was equivalent to my first.\\n\\nThird visit and on... Here is where it gets interesting and also where I learned my lesson on reviews. A work buddy and I went in for lunch and over these next few visits had tried different items but we weren't as impressed as we were with the #17 so we ordered the #17 again. This time we both ordered it. I ordered mine as \\"4-Star Spicy\\" and my friend \\"3-Star Spicy.\\" We received the tea and for a change it was very weak. The soup was mostly water and when we got our plates the spiciness was swapped. They typically put whole red peppers on top of the plate as a count of how many spicy stars it is when there is more than one of the same plate and each has a different amount of spiciness. My friend couldn't eat his food. There were large clusters of red pepper throughout his dish and it was way too hot despite being marked as a 3 star. My plate was marked as a 4 star but was equivalent to a 3 star. Ultimately the server made more food for my friend and was very happy to fix it so we just chalked this up as a rogue experience. What took us by surprise was the next 2 visits after that were also sub-par for their normal level of quality. The soup was watery, as was the tea. The food lacked in flavor and was not the spicy level that we asked for. We were about to give up coming here but the last visit we had (just last week) made up for it all... The tea was full bodied and wonderful. The soup was very flavorful and had a lot of substance in it. My favorite part of all what that the main dish came out perfectly hot, perfectly spicy and perfectly flavorful. Wow... I've missed that. \\n\\nLast side note is that despite the run of sub-par food, Mandarin Cove would be a solid 4 star performer because of the great prices, nice people and wonderful cuisine. Unfortunately they lack in consistency which means a lot to me and is the reason for losing a star. \\n\\nGive Mandarin Cove a try. Odds are you'll have a great experience and will want to visit again!\\n\\nbtw, sorry for being so long winded... :)"},{"name":"New Sapporo Japanese Asian Restaurant","address":"81 Union St","city":"Newton Center","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't come here.  Period.\\n\\nI have been here twice.  The first time was over a year ago, and I remember hating my dish (a spicy fish korean stew), but enjoying a bit I had of my friends jeyook bokkum (sizzling pork).\\n\\nI just went again today with my mother hoping to have a long blissful lunch divulging whispered secrets of my college life over some exquisite dishes.  Even the service, something I don't usually feel the need to comment on, was awful.  There were 2 tables full in the whole place, and everything took FOREVER.\\n\\nWe had the lunch specials: tofu japchae with rice (my mom is a vegetarian... I wouldn't usually order with tofu), and seafood dolsot bibimbap (again, vegetarian).  Both dishes were greasy, half-assed, disgusting messes.  The food at the nasty places in Super 88 is at least 3 times better, and I usually NEVER eat at Super 88 unless faced with starvation and thus death, and even then it's a tough sell.\\n\\nThe japchae tasted worse than the dirtiest, grimiest noodle stir-fry you can ever imagine, and for some reason they felt the need to throw it on top of a literal LUMP of leftover rice.  To add insult to injury, the tofu was overcooked, tasteless, and watery.  Japchae, when done right, is a delicate often chilled noodle salad, full of perfectly cooked vegetables, accented with a simply but delicious dressing composed mainly of soy sauce and sesame oil.  Sapporo's version tasted less authentic than Panda Express lo mein.\\n\\nWe also got the seafood bibimbap, and all of my worst fears came true.  Sushi places run by Koreans will often offer several bibimbap dishes with seafood on top to recycle sushi meat, and that is exactly what happened here.  The shrimp was butterflied as if it had just been grabbed off a left-over piece of sashimi (and the rice put in the japchae, no less).  The pieces of fish were clearly cut long for a sushi roll and then re-cut into block pieces for the bibimbap.  Disgusting.\\n\\nIf you want to waste your time, your money, and feel like you just ate a pile of grease, Sapporo is your place.  I'm still mad that it was my mom's first exposure to Korean food.

The sauce was spicy and the shrimp and chips were full of flavor. \\n\\nFor us the way we save money is by sharing our entree, which can be a battle depending one whose hungry for what. We again ordered of their specials menu, which was Wood Grilled Beef Short Ribs, served with grilled corn on the cob and we ordered a side of the mashed potatoes. The short ribs were a little on the fatty side, I understand they leave them like this to keep the flavor. But they were cooked just the way I like it, still bleeding a little. The corn on the cob really was the dish seller. Our waiter informed us the corn is cooked for seven hours, and it was phenomenal, so very good. The mashed potatoes were fresh, and very creamy, the type of mashed potatoes I dream about making one day. \\n\\nNow for dessert we again ordered of the specials menu, we had a Key Lime Pie with Coconut Sorbet. OMG, delicious. The pie was creamy and sweet buy still had that tart taste from the limes.
