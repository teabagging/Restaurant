I always get the chicken and waffles, which were tasty on most of the time. I think the chef makes good food, despite the fact that the quality can be inconsistent.  My issue is not with the place, but with the shoddy service. In the last year I've watched this place go from bad to worse. One week there are complimentary mimosas, then the service is discontinued...only to be reinstated a few weeks later. The wait staff is slow and unapologetic. Not to mention they miss out on simple restaurant etiquette. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of bacon. Her plate was chipped and the bacon was sitting in grease with random grissle shavings (gross) around it. The whole plate just looked disgusting. It only takes a few extra seconds to properly clean and plate a meal. The extra consideration is why people dine-in. My waffles were smaller, burnt, and not fluffy. The chicken was also smaller and a bit dry. My plate came out last but my food was cold. How does that happen?\\n\\nOh and there is the new cash only rule...which is not on their yelp or website. Even busted nail shops take credit/debit cards these days. La Mongerie, you are a seemingly nice restaurant in a prime location. The cash only policy makes you look cheap and below par. I watched countless people walk up and leave bc of the (handwritten) cash only sign on the door. I unfortunately missed the sign and had to force them to take my card. (They pretended they didn't have card machine, but they do.) Naturally the woman had an attitude about me charging my meal. Have no fear, it won't happen again. \\n\\nLa Mongerie, I love your chicken and waffles...but the meal isn't worth the awful experience.

The part I had some reservations on which I still kinda hate about this place is you cook one piece of food at a time.

I ordered the \\"512\\", with BBQ sauce, jalapenos, bacon, and cheese, and it was incredible. All the burgers are served on sweet buns, and they're not overly buttered or greasy. I don't think I've ever had such a satisfying burger that didn't leave me feeling like I might have a heart attack. Finally, after the remodeling several years ago, the place looks really nice now. The outdoor patio is a great place to spend the late afternoon. If I could wish just one small, little wish though, it would be that the Sunday beer menu included more than Miller, Miller, and Miller (in case I don't roll out of bed at the crack of noon looking for liquor or cheap beer)."},{"name":"Tavern in the Square","address":"1815 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"This place is always a disappointment. I work right next to Tavern in the Square, so I have given it more chances than I would ordinarily. My order is always either wrong, bad, or both and always over priced for what it is. I am fairly certain that most of the food they use is frozen food heated up, onion rings, veggies, which is not awesome. In my most recent experience, I decided to try the Italian wrap- the basil and asperagus were missing, the mozzerella tasted like plastic, and the \\"baked\\" wrap was ice cold except for one spot. Clearly it never saw the inside of an oven. The staff is ok, but not once when I have asked for them to fix something have they offered an apology and in many cases gave me something back that was either the same thing or a different wrong thing. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the wings are good and you can watch any sports team you want, but if you want a good meal, this is not the place to go."},{"name":"Hottie Hawg's Smokin BBQ","address":"2061 Main St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Smoked wings = YUM. \\n\\nGreat atmosphere and live music.

It was delicious! Before leaving I ordered a 3 piece wing plate with 2 sides of baked beans to take home since I'm not from the area.

The chunks of lamb were tender and delicious.  The rice nuts and spices tasted good.  For some reason peas,  1/4 inch diced carrots and green beans had been added to the cooking rice.

I've been on five continents and eaten in some amazing places, but none has made me so upset to be in. We were not given any choice of table, just shoved in between two couples that knew each other. We couldn't hear each other without screaming. There's no live music at the place, a prominent feature of Austin, either. So, we had 4 small plates, 2 glasses of wine, and it came up to $75.

To be quite honest, if Obama or whoever is really important in your world, called me tomorrow and said \\"Let's go to the Barley Swine\\", I'd just say, \\"Any other place but that!\\".

Alternatively, you can sit at the bar and be waited on by the busy barstaff.  We chose the latter.\\n\\nThe menu is very appealing, with something for everyone.  I had the Greek burger (lamb, with tsaziki sauce,feta, and red onions) and fries.  My friend had the Classic.  Both were really tasty.  The greek burger was a great change of pace, but still satisfied my burger craving.  The fries were well-seasoned.  My only gripe was that their ketchup tasted a little weird for me.  Maybe it was homemade?  I prefer the predictable tang of the mundane Heinz.\\n\\nThe food took a good long spell to arrive, but they were packed (with young, pretty Austin folks - great crowd), and it was hot and tasty so I can overlook that.  Prices were very reasonable for such a hotspot.

However, you can order beers in a half-pint size which is cool for trying a few different ones without getting too smashed first.

It's also good for a little snack. They have a really diverse menu - I recommend getting the tacos - pick a few, they are very tiny - probably 3 bites each. I have tried all of them (except the seafood ones) and have enjoyed them all! The tacos come on corn tortillas (which is a huge plus in my opinion). They also have 3 salsas on the table that you can add to your tacos! They also have rice bowls, which are good, but a little less exciting for me (but definitely a more filling option). You do not get free chips/salsa like at most Mexican restaurants. The guacamole is amazing, but the large flat round corn chips that came with it weren't that great (maybe it tasted a bit stale?).\\n\\nThey have cute little patio in the back, which is amazing when the weather is nice!.

This place is incredibly popular - a fact attested to by the fact that folks brought their suitcases here for one last bite before heading out of town. Medina feels like a bit of an old-school cafe, with faded logos on the wall above the bar, but with the high ceilings, it feels a little less intimate and can get a bit loud. The bartender got us our food pretty quickly, but it was there where I saw a cardinal sin (IMO): the juice that was labeled as 'fresh' on the menu was actually store-bought and poured out behind the bar in plain sight of anyone sitting there...not really a good look at all. My orange juice was fine, but you can definitely tell the difference between store-bought OJ that is not from concentrate vs. something that is actually freshly-squeezed.\\n\\nThe brunch itself was quite hearty, with the style having a bit of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern influences. I went with the 'paella' which, while plenty large, had a bit too much going on in it. As such, the only thing that stuck out was the chorizo, which had a nice spice in what ended up being a bland-tasting dish. We ended up having a a waffle to share as well, and while enjoyable (I really liked the natural maple syrup it was served with), the waffle was definitely lighter than authentic Liege waffles I have had in Belgium, along with missing the dense sweetness imbued into its batter.\\n\\nMedina is a very serviceable brunch spot, but is it worth waiting a long time in line for?

The quality of their freshly ground meat makes one of - if not the - best burgers in Austin. Since I am there for a burger, I order the classic, which is basically lettuce, tomato, onion and a \\"sassy\\" sauce.  I swap out the beef burger for bison (there is an upcharge)  forgo the sauce, add pickles and get a multi-grain bun...and I am in burger heaven.  The medium cooked bison is wonderfully juicy unlike many bison burgers.  Everything tastes so fresh, of course, when a place is this popular its understandable they go through all the ingredients at lightening speed.  \\n\\nOn my first visit to Hopdoddy right after they opened, my order was one of lose/win.  I absolutely love ahi tuna so I thought the tuna burger would be perfect.  While its not a bad sandwich it doesn't satisfy that \\"I just have to have a burger\\" urge you typically have when you dine at a burger spot.  I have forgone the tuna burger ever since taking my love for tuna elsewhere.  However, the big win for my first visit was one of their shakes.  There are hardly any problems that ice cream can't handle and Hopdoddy's amazing shakes certainly can over come any problems.  They have since added numerous wonderful flavors such as salted caramel.  Each are thick, rich and simply decadently delicious.\\nWhen you think of burgers you naturally think of friesn and Hopdoddy's  fries are cooked to perfection as well although my wish is that they would serve sweet potato fries. However, Hopdoddy sticks to the basics and it definitely works. They have the service and food down pat which is what I love.

But it just happens to be at precisely the midpoint between my place and the current dude's, and thus going here is just so much easier than going somewhere that requires non-pedestrian transport.\\n\\nI don't know why, but this location seems to garnish their drinks but intermittently.  I order a dirty martini and I get olives in it maybe 40% of the time.  The Central location has garnished all drinks I've consumed there as one would reasonably expect, but then that's representative of a much smaller sample size.  Incredibly odd.  Like, is there an olive shortage behind the bar?  Yet no shortage of olive juice?  What's the deal?\\n\\nI also have a love/hate relationship with the buffalo chicken nachos.  Love because they are delicious, hate because I feel compelled to eat the entire plate.  And this is no small plate: on the first date with the aforementioned dude, he declined to order them because the portion was too large.  This from an approximately seven foot tall (really, pretty much ogre-sized) man.  It is really a lot of nachos.

They have an actual container so flies don't go in and lay their maggots on the meat.\\n\\nThere's pictures on the walls and if you look closely, it's their sons who served (currently?) the military.

You can taste a hint of the peppercorn. \\n\\nBut the real reason I came here for were the fries. They were indeed bottomless. The steak fries comes free as a side for burgers but the special fries which are also bottomless will cost a little extra.

We live between 2 of them, one is in Hillsboro, on NW Cornell (across from the \\"Streets of Tanasbourne\\", the other is on Cedar Hills Boulevard, in the WINCO shopping center.  If you want local,fresh & delicious Italian food, this is the place to go.  My wife's favorite is the Lasagna, it has just the right balance of meat, cheese, pasta & sauce.  in most places it would be too spicy for my wife to eat... Not here, they do not have a \\"heavy hand\\" with the spices, rather they let the taste of the food speak for itself. I have tried most of the pasta dishes.  My favorite is the Pasta Gamberetti, made with, Angel Hair Pasta, Prawns, Pine Nuts & Green Onions.  It normally comes with a spicy white wine sauce, I ask them to make it NOT SPICY, & they deliver every time. There is a nice selection of salads and sandwiches, of which you can order a 1/2 or full size portion.  All of the sandwiches come with your choice of Kettle brand chips or french fries.  I am a big fan of kettle style chips but prefer the french fries, which taste sweet on the inside & come to the table HOT, like they're supposed to.  My favorite sandwich is the Meatball Parmesan.  The meatballs are just the right size, the cheese is melted just enough and if you're not carefull the sauce will dribble down your chin & your wrist.  I also like both of the chicken dishes, Marsala & Piccata.  They are both made with some pretty tender chicken breasts & have just enough flavoring of wine, on the Marsala and lemon on the piccata. There is also a very good selection of 10\\" pizzas, which I eat by myself, with all kinds of flavors from, Margherita, Artichoke Florentine, my favorite New York'r, which comes with Just Mozzeralla cheese, chopped Garlic, Oregano, a touch of Parmesan and Tomato sauce..  There is also a VEGETARIAN Eggplant Parmesan.  Now, I'm not a vegetarian, by any means, but I sureley like this dish.  They do have a kids menu, which I haven't tried yet.  Even though my wife says that I act so childish sometimes.  The prices are moderate, they have a full service bar & patio seating.

I see that Austin, maybe Texas as a state is a Taco Nation. I'm used to, also Cali-Mex, not so much Texmex. I'd love to order a 1.5 pound burrito, with nothing but beans, rice, guac, sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes, but no such burrito exists on the menu, If I wanted to build my own it would have maybe been around 8 dollars, and the going rate for something like this in SoCal is around 4 dollars. I did however order a carne asada burrito, which for close to six bucks I was thinking would be the size of my head. It was actually pretty small, it fit in one hand, and was honestly the size of a taco, to me. Again, that's just my spoiled California Burrito mentality. (by the way, a California Burrito consists of carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, or \\"pico\\" as it's called here plus FRENCH FRIES! AMAZING, but maybe that's why I'm so less fat now that I live here) Anyway, the burrito was small and packed with onions which I'm not so crazy about. But the taste was amazing, and I definitely wasn't expecting rice and beans inside, which is usually a mortal sin which requires some serious flogging. But alas, it was totally good, and the chips were thick and decadent the salsa was awesome, but lacking in a little spice and a little salt. What I thought wouldn't fill me up really did fill me up and left me completely satisfied. I guess that's just the piggish American in me, the bigger the better. This was a perfect portion. Next time I'll be smart enough to say \\"hold the onions.\\" But for an onion lover they would be perfect. You must also try the Watermelon Water/juice. Very nice on these warm days, Good place for a lazy Saturday lunch. It's hard to eat there as a group because the tables are all tiny and square and bolted down so You can't push them together, We very crampily squeezed 3 couples ( that's 6 people, you math whiz's) onto a table the same size of a card table.

My boyfriend and I came at 9pm on Sunday, and true to the Spanish custom of dining late, dinner was still bustling. Unfortunately, some dishes, like the octopus, were sold out, but mostly we were able to get what we wanted.\\n\\nCharcuterie platter: We got a soft goat cheese, salami, and jam√≥n serrano. All were delightful. The meats has just the right amount of fat and weren't overwhelmingly salty, and the cheese had a nice touch of tangyness and goatyness.\\n\\nPaella de mariscos: We shared a paella for one between the two of us, and it was more than enough. The rice was a little hard and crunchy with ample wetness, which I liked. There were lots of onions and peppers in the dish though, which may or may not be to your liking.\\n\\nCrispy beef tendon: Interesting but wouldn't order again. Wasn't that flavorful.\\n\\nDuck confit salad: I just wanted some greens to balance the meal out, and this salad did the trick.\\n\\nAlbondigas (meatballs): Amazing! Juicy and full of tomato flavor. Loved the chunky ham and tomato sauce. Couldn't tell whether the stringy bits inside the meatballs were cheese, and as a lactose intolerant person, I'd rather not know.\\n\\nWine: I really enjoyed my Zarel-lo white wine. \\n\\nBread: Amazing. Probably one of the best parts of the meal. Warm, crunchy crust, soft and moist interior. Would buy this bread if they sold it.\\n\\nThe service was a bit flustered.

First, I would like to say that I have worked in the Restaurant Industry from bus boy to manager to COO of a large-scale food operation before becoming a lawyer just to set the baseline here. Second, I would say the food was awesome and a major improvement from when it was the Seadog Brewery. Third, the place is owned by a husband/wife duo and I obviously drew the short straw and got \\"lucky\\" enough to be waited on by the wife-half of the ownership team and let me tell you something, in all the years of working in hospitality, restaurants, and management for other industries, I can without a doubt say she is the rudest owner/manager/waitress I have EVER encountered. First off, they have rules about eating outside overlooking the water. If you don't order food or violate one of their other 5 commandments they literally tell you to leave. You have a two-hour max to sit outside which would not be so bad if the food didn't take an hour to come out after a half-hour of waiting for your order to be taken. I have never seen a place that kicks the patrons out for not following ridiculous seating, food-ordering, and time-limit rules. Second, I sat down a little after my party had been sitting there eating food and drinking (they were still in the process of doing so) and because I got there late, we were told time was up and we had to either leave or move inside before the initial part of the group were even finished with their meal and drinks. This alone made me want to walk out. Then, the before-mentioned wife-owner/waitress combo comes over to me and throws a menu down in front of me and says, \\"order, leave, or go inside.\\" Which had me ready to walk out. If not for me being with a large group and not wanting to embarrass anyone I would have been out of the place by now. For the sake of the people I was with I sucked it up and ordered, after having to be re-seated so I did not get thrown off the balcony when I refused to not follow the Art's Commandments, with a new waitress. The food was GREAT, my new waitress was way better (yet you could tell she was also a little miserable; probably from having to work at a place who's rules give a North Korean labor-camp a run for their money), and the drinks came quicker. However, even with the food and drinks being great after my forced-relocation, the fact that one of the owners was so rude to a patron and the fact the place is so regimented with rules for patrons it makes military service look like a cakewalk is enough to make it only deserve one star and not recommend anyone go to the place. The price is far too expensive for having to deal with that kind of experience and a miserable owner. You feel unwelcome from the get-go (since I was initially harassed by the hostess about the rules but chose to keep walking past her and ignoring her) and they enforce the rules when the place is empty inside (because that is good for making money?). The atmosphere the ownership is allowing to be created feeds right in to the stereotype that Boston-area Massachusetts residents are unfriendly, which is bad for a business in a vacation town like Hull. Needless to say, I will not be going back unless dragged there by a group again and even then I might bring ear-plugs to tune out Mrs. Attitude."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Traveling for work and recognized the name so I stopped in.

This place could not be more disappointing.  The place is not nicely decorated at all: bare bones grey cement floor and a huge bar that takes up half of the dinning room.  The table we were seated at was next to the bar and the drunks were so loud, it was hard to have a conversation.  I ordered my favorite martini and it was tiny and came with one olive - not the kind of drink a Capitol Grill serves but that they would serve you at an airport bar where they measure the shots.  There was no bread served.  The  menu was very small with very few choices. For apps some egg roles, and crab cakes but no shrimp cocktail or anything else for non-carb eaters to enjoy. We did have two decent salads and they were the highlight of our dinner.  For a steak house they only had 3 steaks to choose from which surprised us.  I ordered the larger 12 oz filet mignon for $42. For this kind of pricing I would have expected a nice thick piece of meat but what came was closer in thickness to a sirloin.  The steak was plain and they did not offer any sauce options.  They steak was a C+.  Since all of the entrees are a la carte, my wife and I split two sides: mushrooms and asparagus.  Normally at top steak houses you expect sides that can be shared by the whole table.  At this place our mushrooms were barely enough for 1 and they brought us only 5 asparagus spears to split with the two of us.  We skipped dessert and the total bill came to $178 with a 20% tip included (the service was good).  Next time you have a special occasion save your money and go to a real steakhouse like Capital Grill, Box109 or Morton's.

I got the Llano Poblano and it was delicious. The poblano peppers on top were not too spicy, but a great addition to a burger. There were also a couple thick slices of applewood smoked bacon. Mmmmm :) Random note: if you like pickles like I do, you can ask for them when you order. They have both dill and bread & butter pickles.\\n\\nMy friend and I split an oreo shake however we also got to try sips of the raspberry (pretty good but a little sweet, I myself definitely can't finish one), mexican vanilla (very good! can't go wrong with vanilla), and caramel & sea salt (interesting taste, it was good at first but then got super salty towards the end so you might want to tell them to go easy on the sea salt). Their fries are also really good! \\n\\nAmbiance:\\n\\nVery homey with a modern twist. They have chalkboard menus on the walls and other cute decorations. I especially like their booths. Just a warning: DO NOT SIT IN THE PATIO AT NIGHT. It is so dark out there and no lights. I think only one of the patio tables are lit. So unless you want to eat in the dark, ask for a table inside. We actually agreed to sit on the patio since we thought it was an actual patio WITH LIGHTS. But nope, you're pretty much in the dark between the building and a row of trees. Awkward. I'm sure it's a lot better during the day.\\n\\nService:\\n\\nIt's alright. You stand in line waiting to order and someone is finding a table for you. After you sit down, they bring the food to you. They got all our burgers mixed up so we had to figure that out ourselves. There's another \\"server-ish\\" person who comes around and asks you if you want water or any condiments.\\n\\nPrice:\\n\\nIt's a little pricey for burgers but pretty filling (at least for me...some of my guys friends said they could eat another one), not something I would eat regularly but definitely worth it to try it at least once. I actually want to go back to try the greek and ahi tuna burger next time!"},{"name":"George's Roast Beef, Seafood and Pizza","address":"124 Broad St","city":"Lynn","stars":"2.5","text":"This place sucks balls they argue back with customers and their fries are stale and flavorless.

Walk into the front door and straight through the restaurant's interior to the outdoor patio and you will find yourself transported to a completely different world.  \\n\\nI dined with my colleagues here yesterday evening for a special occasion and the staff did everything they could to ensure a delectable dining experience.  We started off with the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc (New Zealand) which was a palate pleaser and definitely won both myself and my colleagues over immediately.  The grilled portobello mushroom and spinach/mesclun greens salad were terrific for appetizers and were very good portions for sharing.  I chose the chipotle-grilled shrimp over cheesy stone-ground grits and my husband savored the grilled lamb shank...both were divine and I practically licked my plate clean.\\n\\nQuite possibly one of the most beautiful surroundings that I have discovered in which to dine in Atlanta, Terra Terroir was the perfect setting for a wonderful meal with wonderful people.

The girl tonight was very talented and fun to watch. She interacted with the crowd very well! \\n\\nIt being a Friday, they have a 'rule' on their menu that you 'must' order an entree and you cannot share entrees with others.

The waitress brought my itemized check, which I glanced at then provided a card for. When she brought the check back for a signature, she had removed the itemized copy and only left the credit card receipt and copy. Had I not looked over a friend's itemized bill before signing, I would have tipped her another 20% when she had already added 18% gratuity to the check.

Champs is one of those places you just kind of stop by when in the area to catch a game and have a drink rather than make it a destination.

Ok, continue, but I had already decided that I wouldn't be having pizza here every again.  So I grabbed the second slice and it broke apart in half trying to pull it off the pan and on to my plate(STRIKE THREE)!

Felt like the forgotten table. \\n\\nAnd when asked if they have any kids menu, there doesn't seem to be any policies/training as we got mixed messages from one server (we had to grab her walking by as we were waiting a long time for our server to show up) saying no, but the kitchen can do chicken tenders and smaller sized pastas; but when confirming while ordering with our server, we got a \\"the other waitress was just being nice\\" and he'd have to check with the kitchen on what can be adjusted since everything was pre-proportioned sizes, etc etc; seemed like we were being a hassle for asking him. And turned out the first waitress was right. At least we were surprised the chicken tenders came with some fries too. \\n\\nWith so many good restaurants to choose from in this area, this restaurant is easy to pass on."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Hop-dayum. \\n\\nThese burgz are so great.

The service was great, the food was great, the atmosphere was great, you name it -- I was impressed. \\n\\nThe butchers cut is definitely my favorite burger. I couldn't ask for a better burger. \\n\\nOk -- here's the **minus 2 stars** part. \\n\\nMy return visit, after hyping this restaurant up for months, I decided to bring my mom and step-dad.   They're hip, fun, young people -- we're not talking aging old folks here.  It took about 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table, and when the server (who looked like she was straight from \\"The Hills\\" show on MTV) greeted us, she says \\"Can I get you guys something to drink\\" ...then followed by \\"OK\\" and walks away. I felt like I was in South Beach....the snotty, \\"my $hit don't stink\\" attitude.  I ordered a root beer martini -- and watched it sit on the bar for 10+ minutes before she brought it to the table.  When she came to take our order, she said \\"You guys know what you want\\" with this blank 'i dont have time for this' look. \\n\\nWithout going on and on, i'll just say that the service sucked.  I have a feeling, and after affirming my suspicions with friends -- we believe that the staff at Flip Burger know's that they have something special, therefore it's OK to be snotty.   I'm a firm believer that the food tastes better with good service -- i know that sounds ridiculous, but whenever a server pisses me off, I think it's natural to ride on the negativity wave and unintentionally look for flaws.  Instead of being in a good mood and chatting about whatever, we were talking about the service and how our server was off chatting with the bus boy while we needed refills and condiments.   \\n\\nI'm done with my rant and I will update my review when I decide to go back.  I realize that this may have been an isolated incident, but Flip needs to take a big dose of southern hospitality....don't worry, it'll only help, we'll still think Flip is posh."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Went in on a Sunday to watch the 2nd half of the Patriots game.

We went on a Wednesday and they had a DJ, which made the place a little louder than is probably usual, and there was a funny pair of hopeful bar trawlers led along by a couple of hopeful free drinkers, who all thought the solution to overcoming music volume was to increase their vocal decibels. So there was that. \\n\\nThen there was the fact that somewhere in the middle of our visit, the place got pretty packed and there was only one lady behind the bar. Some might describe her calm demeanor as nonchalant, but I decided to interpret it as the steely resolve of a captain in a storm on the high seas.\\n\\nThe clientele made for excellent people-watching, and as I joined the thunderhead around the bar to wait my 15 minutes to close out my tab, I found myself wedged between two people having a quasi-private conversation. I tried to blend into the table behind me as best I could, while still casting appropriately eager body language in the direction of the bar cap'n, but due to the unique configuration of bar and table, it was impossible to stay out of the conversation completely, even if only as a not-so-undercover eavesdropper.\\n\\nIn the end, I ended up with (1) the conversation guy kindly offering to order my drink and flag the lady down for my tab, (2) a funny chat with a dude at the bar who had observed the entire exchange, and (3) a High Five. High Five!\\n\\nNow, given, this is a pretty specific experience, but here's my take: if you know you'll have to wait in line, at least it's good to know that there's a good chance that the people to the left and right are going to be accessible and interesting make the time fly by.\\n\\nWhich is why the four stars.

Pairs had a 45 - 60 minute wait whereas since I was by myself I only had to wait 20 minutes for a single seater in the bar. The place is very small, less than 20 seats. \\n\\nI tried to time my line up experience in accordance with the hourly weather even though the past few days the weather reports have been severely off the mark. In true Vancouver tradition it rained 40 minutes than promised and many were forced to huddle under the cover. This forced me to make some instant friends with out of towners from Portland and Seattle. The awesome conversation made the waiting experience a little better. \\n\\nYou're more than welcome to order coffee at the bar while you wait to get a head start on the caffeine buzz so that you're nice to the servers. Not that this helped since some of the staff acted as though they've never smiled before in their life. Very stuck up. I'm talking specifically about the host trying to take names and seat everyone. Many in line tried to get him to loosen up, have some humor and calm down, however, he was adamant on not having any of it which in the end hurt the establishments tip by yours truly. \\n\\nThe advantage of going alone is that I make instant friends, a new take on life with fresh conversations. I wanted to chill and write in my notebook, however, was glad that this was left on the back burner as I chatted with Andre, Kenneth and the other person (sorry I forgot your name). The mission to break the anti-social Vancouver stereotype was in full swing. \\n\\nI had the lavender latte to start. It's the most amazing latte that I've had in a long time. You wouldn't think that on paper lavender and coffee would go well together, however, it worked. Hint...instead of a double shot get a single so that the flavor notes of the lavender are more prominent and balanced. \\n\\nI asked for additional hot water for my latte and was served the hot water in a mug with no handle. Handling the mug was extremely hot. Who the f-ck thought of this idea to serve scolding hot water in a porcelain mug without a handle? Really? Not even a silicon insulation sleeve? This common sense notion didn't occur to the lady who served me this. So annoyed and frustrated I made the waitress pour the hot water into my cup for me. I did this not to be a diva but so that she can experience how idiotic and unreasonable it is to serve hot as lava water in a mug without a handle. She got the message and half ass apologized for this. \\n\\nThe waffles themselves are the size of my small palm, however, well cooked with sugar pearls inside. I had two waffles: One berry component and the other with chocolate lavender sauce. The sauces themselves are nothing to write home about, however, the waffles themselves were awesome. Total bill with tip and tax for 2 was $10 (plus $4.20 for the latte earlier). \\n\\nI'm giving 3 based on the service, not the waffles."},{"name":"Herrera's","address":"11 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The best place in downtown crossing for Mexican!

I figured if the pizzas are really good, the calzones are probably just as good.  But first I was served the wrong order.  They brought me someone else's calzone, so obviously I sent it back.  I got the correct one soon enough, but it was almost half dough.  That was a big disappointment.  Paying that much for just a loaf of bread just isn't right.  I said as much to the server, who just agreed that yes, it was a lot of dough.\\n\\nI'm sure I will return here, but I have to lower the rating for now.\\n\\n*********\\n\\n\\nThis place reeks of chain restaurant, but that's not entirely bad.  The ambience is raucous and loud, and given that there is a huge -- and I mean HUGE -- set of 4 TV screens behind the bar it stays like that most of the time.  If you can ignore that everything else about this place is good.  The TV screens obviously makes this place a sports bar type of place, but the food is a step up from that kind of food.  If you've experienced Cover 2 and Cover 3, B.J.'s tries to be that kind of place.\\n\\nThe pizzas are their specialty.  They are very good, actually.  I have had the Meat Lover's equivalent.  I liked it.  Unless you're barely hungry you should get a small.  The mini is barely more than a pizza roll.\\n\\nThe seared ahi tuna small bite is actually very good.  Be careful with the wasabi, though.  It's about twice as strong as any wasabi I've had with sushi, so it can be overpowering.\\n\\nMy choice the past couple of times has been a salad.  Their BBQ chicken chopped salad is excellent.  This last time I tried the honey chicken salad.  It was ok.  Not that great, but still good.  I tried it with the bleu cheese dressing, but the dressing had gone bad.  If you try anything with the bleu cheese dressing ask for it on the side.  It can go bad.\\n\\nTheir beer selection is very good.  If you're looking for a place to go just for the beer and some pub food to watch a game, this is an excellent option.  They have seasonal beers that rotate in and out of their lineup, as well as plenty of other domestic and international choices.\\n\\nIt's a great place for parties and groups."},{"name":"Panda Express","address":"1462 NE 122nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"I try not to be a hater when it comes to chain food restaurants...but you really need to step up your game folks!!

I can understand why this restaurant one of the city's only Michelin worthy spots even tho there aren't any in Canada yet. Portions are small so be prepared to either order a lot or eat before. Prices are quite high for the portions as expected from a fancier place. \\n\\nThere is a German themed portion of the menu but it's not consistent with the whole restaurant offering. The tasting menu does not seem very traditional tho I'm not an expert. We tried all the deserts also and none were traditional themed. The drink menu seemed more focus on this. \\n\\nIn my opinion I think the themes of the restaurant are confusing. As Bauhaus advertises as a German experience but I would say the experience is half. As there is a very contemporary aspect that is fine dining with fusion European feel. This is just my impression, not trying to put down the concept. \\n\\nThe service is not quite Michelin worthy also as that is a huge portion of the experience. This is something that would need to be worked on. For example I noticed a chef eating out of the pot (not tasting) as he was like having a break. Hard to avoid as the kitchen is so open. Also a server brought our drinks but was slamming it on our table. Pouring a beer and slamming the empty bottle down. Why not just show us and take it back?

The steamers I thought were just okay, but they had these little cajun shrimp things that I could not get enough of! Their oysters were also just average though, so really I think this is one of those average seafood spots, but I definitely should come back and try some of their other dishes since I've heard from so many that this place is really good, I just didn't really see that this time around.\\n\\nTrue, I didn't pay for much since it was a party already paid for, but I was looking at the menu and it seemed a little pricey for what seems like a Joe's Crab Shack kind of place, but I don't know if I would have paid as much as some of those prices were to eat here."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"-Edit-\\nI am updating my initial one star review to reflect that someone from Guest Relations reached out to find out more about my experience in an effort to make it right.

We were going to celebrate my finishing a tough semester of college with a dinner date. My coworkers at the art gallery spoke highly of The Cowfish so we intended to try it. This was a more expensive spot, but not unreasonable. Burgers fell into the mid-teens if I recall correctly. My problem was that we never had a chance to enjoy our meal. We were seated and began to wait. A server checked on the party beside us, another couple was seated and ordered drinks. They received their drinks. We never ever had a server touch our table. I gave this a fair shot, I know servers have off nights or the hostess makes mistakes, I was a server I understand. We waited half an hour with no contact. After that we left and no one at the host stand acknowledged us as we left. \\nI know a one star is harsh, but considering that we never even got to take a sip of water I have nothing to review except for a lack of service. This is very disappointing because I find the concept to be great. The decor was amazing, bright, very fluid. The feel was unlike any restaurant I've ever been to and that is what is so sad.

Admittedly, I haven't had many of the different offerings because of my love for the hemp flax granola cookie.  It's just the right amount of sweet with lots of tooth and texture.  I've deemed it 'the meal replacement cookie' because that's exactly how I treat it when I'm hungry for something light but filling.  They freeze great, too.  I buy them buy the half dozen then pop one in the microwave for a few seconds when I'm ready to eat.  My other favorite is the seriously good chocolate cake/cupcake.  It's not only seriously good, it's seriously chocolatey.  I've had other treats as well but these are my go-to favorites.  Everything is always delicious, always fresh, and always consistent,unfortunately even the service which is less than welcoming.  I can only recall one visit of several I've made that the employee helping did so with any pleasantry.  I stopped by today to get my hemp cookie fix and again received the usual apathetic attitude from the red head that helped me this time.  No greeting, no smile, not even a 'thank you' after I paid for the cookies.  She punched my reward card with near reluctance like she was doing me some kind of favor.  Honestly, that's pretty much the vibe I get every time; they're doing me a favor.  Like David W., I too work in retail and expect good if not great service as a consumer, particularly from a local business claiming to be so concerned about the community.  In most instances, I would ban a business not wanting to treat me like a valued customer but I still prefer to support a local business and I just love those meal replacement cookies.

It was comforting to know too through reading prior Yelp reviews and by peering into the window that people loved coming here.  On a Tuesday night, Rangzen (in addition to almost every restaurant in Central Sq), appeared relatively busy.  \\n\\nWe ordered:\\nChhasha Momo ($13.95)   8 pan fried (you can get them steamed too), handmade chicken dumplings filled with minced chicken, spinach, cabbage, ginger & garlic.  \\n\\nPhingsha ($14.45)   Cubed or shredded beef with bean thread noodles cooked with black mushroom & potato, ginger and garlic \\n\\nThe momos were definitely delicious and the highlight of our dinner. They come with two types of sauces you can used to eat the dumplings with; a red one that has a ginger and tomato base, as well as the green sauce that is slightly spicier with flavors of chili and cilantro.  Although I've had a fair share of dumplings before and they all are very similar in taste, you could tell from the first bite that these were home made and not cooked from a package.   \\n\\nPingsha was recommended to us by our waiter who said that this was one that most people tend to order.  We felt it was mediocre.  The potato cubes in the dish retained more flavor than anything else on the plate.  The shredded beef tasted a bit dry and needed more of a sauce. The bean thread noodles were almost hard to manage and slipped easily throughout our forks.  \\n\\nI believe that this was definitely a good experience to try a new culture's food.  The momos left me with a higher note and the price tag didnt leave us with an empty wallet.  The waitstaff were also very attentive and made sure our glasses were never half full.  \\n\\nSo, Rangzen.

My husband and I always end up here on a random weeknight which is great because we usually can always find parking and there is never really anyone at the bar. We always sit directly at the bar so we can get quicker service on refills and also, my husband and I are addicted to their Barcast TV that is right in between the 2 tv's that play the sports shows. It's completely brainless stuff, but it somehow always drags me and hubby into a numbed mind state (or maybe that is just the 10% alcohol beers we drink lol). \\n\\nThe weeknight bartenders are knowledgeable and always friendly. Food is mediocre but I do have a soft spot for their homemade sun dried tomato vinaigrette dressing on their garden salad and my husband is in love with their steak tips (also highly rated by the phantom gourmet). One thing that totally upsets me is their terrible offering of desserts. I mean seriously, who wouldn't want to wash down a tasty sweet morsel with a full pint of a microbrew!

It was definitely an interesting meal with many of creative dishes.\\nWe had 6 plates according to what the restaurant recommended for 2 people; however, I thought it was actually a lot of food from 6 plates. I would actually start off 4 plates for two people then decide to order more after it. I started to feel fullness after the 4th plate so I definitely will control the portion a bit more next time. \\nFirst dish was the fried bread with snap peas, sesame yogurt, and goat feta. I thought this was an excellent plate with interesting flavors and textures. I enjoyed the lightness of the dish yet it was very flavorful. \\nThe second dish was the gulf shrimp with pork bites and mango puree, which was one of today's special dishes. The presentation of the plate was excellent to start the dish off. I really liked this dish because it offered high quality shrimp, which was well seasoned and perfectly grilled. It went very well with the mango puree on the bottom and the small pork bites on the side. Overall, the flavor of the shrimp did not get overpowered by other components of the dish; yet, the shrimp flavor was intensified. I also admired how the restaurant deep fried the shrimps head and served it with the dish. I know most of people do not even eat shrimp's head but it has so much of flavor. I enjoyed this dish very much and was impressed with the creativity. \\nThe next dish was the pork belly with artichoke, vanilla, Swiss chard. This was definitely another wonder of the day. The plate was beautifully plated and excellent executed. The pork belly was tender and flavorful. It was soft to break apart by a fork. The seasoning of the pork belly has some barbecue rub flavor but with some different twist. The rest of the dish just went beautifully with the flavorful pork belly. Overall, this dish was very coherent and well designed.\\nThe fourth dish was the goat neck and shoulder with toasted farro, green olive, and carrot. It was an interesting combination of components. The main issue I had with this dish was that the goat meat was really salty to my taste. I thought the overall dish was overpowered by the saltiness of the goat meat. \\nThe next dish was very very interesting. It was the chicken fried chicken egg with grilled sweetbreads, hay grits, and mustard. Okay, I was completely caught by surprise of this dish. It had very bold flavors that I could not quite explain. The egg was deep fried but kept the egg yolk fluid. We opened the egg and sprinkled some sea salts on the egg. The sweetbreads was completely not expected because I did not even know what \\"sweetbreads\\" are. The whole dish was having lots of intense flavors. I thought it was an very interesting dish but not so much fit for my taste. It was overly designed dish to my opinion. \\nOur last dish was grilled Foie gras with rutabaga, pickled strawberry, and parmesan. i felt this dish was very greasy due to the grilled foie gras. The flavor was good but I just couldn't get pass the greasiness. It was also leaning toward the salty side for me. \\nOverall, I was very full from these plates. I enjoyed the first 3 dished the most since they were lighter and simpler. I felt the later dishes became very complicate and overpowered by saltiness and greasiness. I would order 4 plates next time and find simpler and light plates."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great Pizza.\\nWhen I got my mushroom pizza, it was nice and hot like it just came out of the oven.

I first tried 1/2 of the tuna sandwich: flavor was decent, but the texture of the tuna filling was very strange: mashed, mushy, and not appealing. I am unsure if this was due to low quality of fish, or a blending technique that squished all texture out of the meat. My lunch mate and I agreed the mush tuna had a high\\"ick\\" factor.\\n\\nA half of the olive and tomato, crustless \\"Tramezzini\\" fared better. A piquant olive tapanade paired with a bit of greens and almost impossibly thin slices of a delicious Italian cheese produced an audible, mmmm from me as I devoured the tiny half. I actually had a hard time finding tomato, but I don't think more tomato would have added, but rather would have detracted from the balance of taste and texture in the sandwich. Still this was supposed to be crustless? Those were definitely four sides of white bread crust on that sandwich, so that was a disappointment. I also left hungry after sharing two sandwiches and a brownie with my lunch-mate, so if you go in starved, plan on adding a side salad.\\n\\nThe neighborhood needs more quality small restaurants, so again, have high hopes the so far spotty cafe will improve."},{"name":"Shan-A-Punjab","address":"500 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Not the best Indian food I've had in boston.

I've been wanting to go here since we moved to Portland.\\n\\nThe straight up Whiskey is great.  Avoid the mixed beverages.  I personally got a Kentucky Mule, which is whiskey, lime, ginger beer, and ice.  Somehow, despite being a restaraunt focused on whiskey this was one of the worst and the most boring drinks I've had in all of Portland, beer, wine, mixed drinks combined.  A girl at the table behind me just decided she wouldn't even drink hers, it wasn't even worth it.\\n\\nWe wanted an appetizer, and asked the waitress if we could have the chips and remoulade dairy free.  She said she would check, and we asked her if this was dairy free, we would order it.\\n\\nA few minutes later she came back with the chips and informed us the remoulade was not dairy free.  What?  We just told you we only wanted the chips if they were dairy free?  My spouse has a dairy allergy and told the waitress this explicitly.\\n\\nMove on the the main meal, we get some BBQ sandwhiches with pulled pork and the brisket.  The waitress delivered my spouse's without the slaw on top, as this has some powdered milk in it.  Nothing else was offered.  The meat has dissapointing amount of sauce.\\n\\nSummary: If you want straight up whiskey, this is a fine place to go.  The food was passable but you can definitely do better even in the near area.  Not a good place to go for those with allergies or food intolerances, because even though their menu states that everything is made from scratch and please ask if you have allergies, they aren't going to do anything differently for you."},{"name":"White Spot","address":"5550 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"We come here all the time, and there is never a host or hostess at the front and we always end up standing there for 2 - 5 mins, which is unacceptable.

The chorizo and the korean one (which I think they took off the regular menu but have as a special sometimes) are also two unique faves.

I can definitely understand the reason for all the rave views because The Big Kahuna is deeelicious! Located in a small food truck park known as the Hitch by residents, The Big Kahuna is owned by a really nice couple and my family dropped by 45 min before closing for dinner. We ordered a few things to split: the Kahuna Burger Combo, the Mahi Mahi, and the Hawaiian Style Beef Bugolgi.\\n\\nThe burger combo included a pound of burger meat with kalua pork and cabbage on a Hawaiian sweet bun, a side of fries, and a drink. AKA a looot of food. Since we were splitting the burger along with the rest of the meal, the guy operating the truck was nice enough to throw in an extra set of buns for us. The burgers were so juicy and delicious, and not even a bit greasy. The kalua pork is similar to pulled pork in texture, but its tenderness and flavor is outta this world. Additionally, my sister thought they had some of the best fries.\\n\\nNext was the Mahi Mahi, which came with rice and your choice of side (sunimono salad or Maui slaw). According to their menu, the fish is marinated for 24 hours and it sure tasted like it. Garnished with avocado slices and tomato, the fish was so delicious and flavorful, literally one of the best fish dishes I've had. We had the Sunimono salad as a side and it was some pickled cucumbers and carrots; very light and went nicely with the meal.\\n\\nI didn't have much of the Bugolgi, but it also came with rice and a side. The meat was a bit saltier than normal bugolgi, but as with the trend of the meal, each bite was filled with flavor.\\n\\nAll the items were served on a banan leaf and came with their signature \\"lava sauce.\\" The sauce I could also go on and on about, but it really adds another layer with its tanginess and slight heat.\\n\\nYou have to try this place because it definitely will leave you thinking about the food for days."},{"name":"Pier 6 Boston Waterfront","address":"1 8th St","city":"Charlestown","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food and views of boston skyline!

Beef noodle soup is such an important dish for Taiwan, kind of like what ramen is to Japan.\\n\\nSo I was very excited to try this restaurant when we were in Richmond, British Columbia, which is already known for having some of the best Asian food on the planet (people often say the Chinese is the best food outside of Hong Kong, for example).\\n\\nThe Champion beef noodle soup had a unique simplicity to its broth -- both layered in its rich meat flavors but not overly reliant on red chiles or star anise as I usually find it to be. It wasn't salty but in fact a bit light, in contrast to the chewy, handmade quality of the thick noodles (you can pick a different type of noodle, but the thick type is the more traditional kind). The stewed beef shank could have been more tender in my opinion but none the less was great. There is also a version of this dish that has the beef brisket plus the tendons, but the one I tried was just the meat.\\n\\nAll the portions were very plentiful, and the smaller items that would come with just two items were surprisingly huge.\\n\\nWe also ordered a bunch of the fried small eats, which are common for a Taiwanese eatery. We got\\n--shredded daikon cakes (I don't see this on menus often but it was a childhood favorite of mine so I was thrilled to eat it. Each cake was the size of my fist -- double what I am used to)\\n--boiled dumplings in soup\\n--green onion pancake (didn't have enough green onion flavor and was a bit dry)\\n--fried pork dumplings that were more like mini meat pies (the tastiest thing we got but kind of oily)\\n\\nI'm glad that there is one location in the U.S., in Irvine California, so I look forward to trying Chef Hung closer to home!"},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had been wanting to try Myers & Chang for some time, mostly based on 1) my love of Flour, and 2) a write-up I'd seen about their fantastic chicken and waffles. So I decided to take the plunge and give it a try.\\n\\nThe two of us ordered four dishes to share, plus two cocktails. The pork galbi with sour cream and apple kimchi was tasty, but the meat was a little tougher than I'm used to having my Korean-style short ribs. The kimchi was a nice accent. Octopus with grilled corn and charred scallions was reasonably good-- the octopus actually took second place to the corn, which was tender and flavorful and with a nice subtle kick at the end. Honestly, the octopus seemed like more of a garnish than anything else. Ginger-soy bok choy was a nice side dish-- good flavor, cooked well, and went with everything. \\n\\nFinally, the chicken and waffles. I will say that they were the best version I've had so far, but they still weren't all that great. The chicken itself was very good-- nicely crispy thin skin, not over-battered, and juicy meat. The dipping sauce, a sweet chili, was also good, though I could've used a touch of maple just as a call-back to the original flavor profile. But the waffle wasn't crispy at all-- it wasn't exactly soggy but it was just kind of... there. Like an Eggo waffle that had been left out for about 30 minutes. The whole dish would've been much better if the waffle were fresh and crispy on the outside. Still, better than restaurants who use a giant doughy Belgian waffle...\\n\\nThe cocktails were mediocre. We ordered a Pineapple Express (pineapple infused vodka with Thai basil) which was overly sugary at first and then as the ice melted tasted more like watered-down lemonade, and a Summer Sangria (rhubarb, citrus, and apricot brandy), which was too sour at first and then again got very watered-down by the ice. No real flavor of alcohol to either of them. Near the end of the meal I mixed the two drinks together and they actually tasted better than either individually.\\n\\nWe looked at the dessert menu but didn't see anything particularly eye-catching except the genmai chai panna cotta, but since I personally don't care for genmai tea, we didn't actually order it.\\n\\nAll in all, a nice meal, but we probably won't come again."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"so amazing!! this place is so popular people will line up for 1/2 an hour just to get in.

After we got our first round bartender disappeared for approx ten minutes and no one was at bar.  A gentlemen sat down next to me and finally asked if anyone worked there.  Just then, I notices that the bartender was sitting I. The dining room eating a hamburger and I let the gentlemen next to me know where the bartender was.   the gentlemen waved down one of the waitresses and he asked her a couple of beer-related questions which she did not really know the answer to.

(It's heavy, though; beware. I split it in half with a friend and felt like I had swallowed a brick.) I also had the tempeh with shallots and sun dried tomatoes over potatoes. It was similarly fantastic. Since four out of the six people in our party were vegetarians, we really appreciated that their veg options went beyond the typical salads or vegetable pasta dishes.

Lets talk Gourmet for a second, and a definition of that word...(n)..a connoisseur of fine food and drink; epicure (Adj)..of or characteristic of a gourmet, especially in involving or purporting to involve high-quality or exotic ingredients and skilled preparation (Adj)..elaborately equipped for the preparation of fancy, specialized, or exotic meals:...I guess the noun would be the first to throw me...We dont consider ourselves \\"connoisseur of Fine Food\\", but we know what good food tastes like. Not that this meal didnt taste good, but Gourmet it Was NOT!!..Once again, it come down to price...on the high end for a chain, What type of beef am I eating...Prime cut, angus, 80/20, chuck, brisket?..they advertise a custom blend, but zero info can be found on the website, nor was I offered when we ordered..Is the meat fresh or frozen?..something I would advertise if I was a Gourmet Chain...which doesnt even sound right in a sentence. Food, let talk about it...Wife had the Basic Burger...Plain...Meat, Cheese, Bacon and Ketchup...Do you want Mustard or Mayo...UMMM...No...plain...still came with Lettuce and tomaToE...Onion Bun was Good..Burger was Dry...a few bites in, she was wondering about her Bacon...she discovered...one slice..a wafer thin piece, cross pattern...we both took a small bite, and it lacked any real bacon flavor...Gourmet?...where is the house made thick cut slab of Pig we would expect with Gourmet in your name?..She also got the Mac and Cheese as a side, and for a $1.49 upgrade, actually was really good. Mine was the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double...Patties were thin, very thin...Flavor was OK...only wish it looked as good as the staged photo in the on line menu...Over all Spicy Flare was there...off and on..I have had Ghost pepper type sauces before, and this was No where close to what a Ghost Pepper actually feels like...Garlic fries for my side...the ones that hit the table with my meal, where stone cold and soggy as soggy gets...ordered another...bit warmer, but soggy...as they are swimming in Garlic/Parm/Butter sauce...this would be best served on the side, as fries are supposed to be crispy and Hot...We say farewell to Red Robin Gourmet Menu, and I will stick to mixing my own Burger Blend at home and make it the way we like it...Review was not a simple as I hoped, but we stand by our opinion."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been to El Chile, their sister restaurant, many times and absolutely love it.

But, with the bar being outside and near the water, I can understand their lack of trust with actual glass. I asked the bartender about the alleged \\"beer garden\\", and she looked at me rather confused. She then pointed to about two dozen plants set up amongst the couches and tables on the deck and said that she thought maybe that was it. Listen, it wasn't a bad setup, but it was no beer garden. I definitely had a different visual in my mind. The fact that she didn't even know what I was referring to at first makes me believe she also didn't consider their display to meet that criteria also.

Nope, just gave me my change after a 10 long seconds of looking at each other back and forth. There was another employee that came in as I was leaving (it was getting busy) with two garbage cans.

The quality of the chicken changes every time I go; sometimes it's rubbery, sometimes it's moist and shredded, other times it's bland.

Only giving four this time because I came for lunch and don't feel I got a wide enough sample of the menu. \\n\\nYou MUST order the pashwari naan. It's a sweet naan with coconut and raisins which I've ordered at countless other restaurants. The coconut is KEY to this wonderful dish -- and at Punjab Palace, it's nearly perfect. Ridiculously fluffy, just the right amount of fruits, and sweetened with honey, I could have solely eaten this for lunch. And at $3.95 for four slices, it's much more filling than it looks = a good deal. \\n\\nI had the lamb coconut korma, and my friend ordered the manchurian chicken (as spicy as possible, so despite my loving spicy food I didn't dare to try it). My lamb was tasty -- very coconut-y flavor, which I loved, and it paired nicely with the basmati rice. However, I think I was pretty full from the naan already so didn't enjoy it as much as I could have on an empty stomach. \\n\\nTea, coffee, or chai accompanies the lunch, and I ordered chai. It was pretty light and milky, though my friend were pleasantly surprised by how strong their coffee was. \\n\\nWill definitely be back, and probably with more people so we can order more food :)"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Super cute place with very instagram worthy donuts!"},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Based almost soley on Valissa's review I was pretty set on never trying Pattycake again, but for the great cupcake tour of 2011 we felt like we really needed to include something vegan for comparison.\\n\\nAnd it was really good.\\n\\nWe got the chocolate/blueberry/raspberry cupcake and they were as good if not better than any other cupcake we tried all day.

Great on its own and even better as a backdrop to perhaps Blue Star's most talked about selection, the Fried Chicken Donut (complete with forks and hot sauce,) the only 'plain' donut I've found that rivals Blue Star is at Chicago's Doughnut Vault.\\n\\nContinuing towards more creative options, three filled options featured at Blue Star included Cr√®me Brulee, Peanut Butter and Jelly, and finally Valrhona Chocolate Crunch and although I'd be hard pressed to decide which was 'best,' I'd suggest that all three are well worth the cost and calories; the first two featuring a caramelized glaze - one truly cr√®me brulee in flavor and the other grape overlying light peanut butter cream - while the third is topped with crunchy chocolate spheres that serve an impressive textural counterpoint to the rich, creamy interior.  \\n\\nLargely ignoring an unmemorable slice of Banana Bread Pudding that was decent, albeit a bit bland and too homogenous in texture aside from the crunchy caramel top, and getting back to the donut side of things a quartet of raised brioche offerings would follow with flavors including Blueberry/Bourbon/Basil, Real Maple and Bacon, Dulce De Leche with Hazelnut, and finally S'Mores - each featuring the same excellent texture as the raised glazed option but each with a distinctive topping serving notice that this was not your typical donut.  From the fruity herbal balance of the blueberry selection and the intense sweetness of the maple and briny bacon to the nearly peanut brittle flavor of the dulce de leche and rich chocolate smokiness of the chocolate and toasted marshmallows the key to each selection was balance - the flavors all there, but none overwhelming the others...\\n\\n...and yet none of these options, save perhaps for the Peanut Butter and Jelly, comes close to the 'wow' factor of the fritter; in this case a \\"Hard Apple Cider\\" Fritter with the exterior crunchy and sweet while the innards were rife with apples and cinnamon plus that slightly fermented taste of fall.  All pull-apart delicious, just as a good fritter should be, and literally melting in the mouth due to the butter content of both the brioche and the cooked apples this is a fritter to rival the best of them, and at $2.50 I even threw in two quarters to pick up some house made \\"doggie donuts\\" for my friend's pet, a cute touch from what I firmly believe to be one of the best donut shops in the country and hands down the best in Portland."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Probably one of the best burgers I have had in a while.

I had the Captain Crunch, and my friend had the Nutella with toastes marshmallows. Both were great. They were also a little smaller than you might normally get at say a Steak & Shake.

The sweet and sour sucked to put it plainly. Just a thin syrup, really sweet, my fiance said it tasted like dirty dishwater, I didn't get that personally.\\n\\nMain course arrives, and looks great.

It is counter service here and you seat yourself in the various booths and high top tables. For a Friday evening, it wasn't too busy, but it did seem like they were doing a lot of takeout and delivery. We ordered a Greek salad with chicken ($9) and a cheese pizza ($8.50). We tried to order various beers and hard ciders off the drink menu, although they were out of most. My husband settled for a beer on draft (around $3) and I ordered a glass of wine ($3.50). The price of the drinks were cheap,  but I didn't love drinking my wine out of a plastic cup - although for that price, why not? We also ordered the homemade root beer which was very tasty. Our pizza came out in about 10 min and the crust was crispy, the cheese was gooey and it was pretty much the perfect cheese pizza. The sauce isn't too sweet but tasty on the pizza. After eating a slice, I inquired about my salad, as it had not yet been served. The staff told me it had been served 10 min prior (although not to me), so I waited for another to be made. The salad was a typical salad, with iceberg lettuce, tomato, cucumber, some sprinkled feta and chicken. The chicken had a light marinade which was quite tasty, and the house dressing was creamy and delicious. This was our second time here, and overall the quality of the food was good. Due to the lack of service I am rating it lower."},{"name":"Nature's Table Bistro","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Concourse E Centrepoint, Concourse E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for cup of soup here in ATL.

My husband has been frequenting this restaraunt since 1981. The original wait staff made us feel good and treated us well, especially because they all remembered us when we came in. The Bijou's notoriety included their exceptional etiquette that we regard with high standards in service and food quality when it comes to eating establishments. I couldn't help but notice that the quality of service from the Bijou's current wait staff has gone downward. My husband & I arrived about 1:45 pm, 15 minutes before closing time. Usually, we are generously welcomed in to dine, even if we had arrived closer to 2 pm. The former wait staff were so friendly and pleasant. Today, the waiter who served us was not concerned with his interaction with us, instead he went on with his closing responsibilities and getting the tables cleared. When we first sat down, he did not greet us, he just placed the napkin and silverware down on the table. He rushed through notifying us of their food specials while maintaining a subtle condescending demeanor in his voice. He failed to mention that they were out of baguette so we were surprised to see whole wheat toast when the food arrived. He did not check up on us at all to see if we needed anything else, nor did he ask us how the meal was when taking our plates away at the end of eating. Also, the food portions were smaller than normal for the price. He was, however, over ecstatic when he spotted his ex-husband outside walking by and hurried out to invite him to sit at the bar where he fully engaged all his attention to this man. I would rather support the surrounding food carts than spend a girthy $9.00 on a diminished portion of pork sausage, eggs, salad & toast and a lack of customer service.

You are able to adjust the spiciness, amount of lard, thickness of the noodles, and strength of the broth. The handmade noodles are unique to Danbo and have a firm chewy texture that works with their dish in comparison to the noodles at other ramen restaurants that are a bit chalky. The broth is also very rich and full of flavour; I usually get it at the STRONG option which I would recommend.\\n\\nTheir loyalty program is also quite generous. At 5 dine ins you are eligible for a free serving of gyoza and at 10 you can get a free bowl of their standard ramen.\\n\\nHowever, I have to remove 1 star solely for the reason that it can be difficult to get the attention of the waitresses when you need it.

Barcelona Wine Bar South End breaks the mold for what one can expect from a multi-location tapas restaurant.  So don't dare think of it as a \\"chain'.  The restaurant delivers the care and intimate attention to details found at a restaurant where the owner is there 24/7...attending to every nuance and ensuring each and every customer's experience is exceptional.  \\n\\nA special shout-out to wine server, Benua, is well deserved.  His attention to us finding the right bottle of wine was noteworthy.  He listened carefully, and ensured (by way of multiple tastings) that the bottle we chose hit the mark.  He gave our table the benefit of his own tastes and findings, but was most comfortable parting with them, learning from us, and making way for what his guests were desiring.  Cost became a distant concern because of this attention to customer satisfaction.  El buen tabajo, Benua!\\n\\nThe experience delivered by waitress Katie was of similar high quality, albeit with an understated approach in compare to Benua's bold personality.  She made thoughtful recommendations, and we found ourselves enjoying a great variety of tapas.  The Jamon Serrano was delicious and high quality, albeit lacking the punch of marbling and earthiness found in Jamon Iberica.  The Valdeon (blue cheese) and aged Manchengo were excellent complements to the jamon.  We feasted on a most extraordinary Beef Tartar which was my personal favorite of the night, followed by Potato Tortilla (my wife's favorite), Grilled Pulpo (my son's favorite), Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp), the Spicy Eggplant Caponata, a seasonal grilled corn which had a pepper forward bite which was cooled perfectly by our chosen wine.  And then there's the neverending flow of crusty bread and fruity olive oil for dipping.  Espactacular!   Our only regret was not having the appetite to take in one of the amazing paellas we saw float past our table, or a crowning serving of churros for dessert.\\n\\nWorth mentioning that Barcelona Wine Bar South End is a most vibrant and hip restaurant chock full of 20-somethings dressed to impress each other, albeit without any pretention, and focused on fun, food and the obligatory selfies.  This didn't at all detract from my and my wife's elder position (50-somethings), instead fueled our night of fun with our 20 year old son in this exciting and booming side of Boston.\\n\\nSo make your reservation and enjoy all Barcelona Wine Bar South End has to offer.

First of all, I discovered them because they're in the \\"Chinook Book\\" -- yay, community participation! Next, they offer breakfast until 2 pm on weekdays! On weekdays!

Next, cute and comfy interior with plenty of cozy \\"bring-a-crossword-puzzle-and-order-that-second-latte\\" ambience.

I've been on a benedict kick lately, and this is by far the best I've had... maybe the best I've EVER had. The Hollandaise was rich, creamy, fresh, warm, but not too heavy, and the eggs were poached perfectly, with the English muffin just crunchy enough... The accompanying potatoes were little spiced mouthfuls of heaven, as well. The fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juices were really fresh, and came in generous quantities... I also indulged in a Mexican hot chocolate, which I love (and which I almost never find on menus). It had a small pile of unblended grated chocolate in the bottom, so I know it was the real deal. My husband ordered the catfish hash, which came with generous hunks of fresh, flaky, steamy, cornmeal-breaded fried catfish, perfectly complimented by those fabulous home-fried potatoes. Deciding on an offering was hard. I may never have seen such a singularly appealing breakfast menu, and the lunch menu, which we haven't explored (yet) looked equally inviting...\\n\\nMove over, Screen Door, with your long waits and no brunch on weekdays!

Arrived on-time for a 7:30 reservation and was told that the computers had gone down and that they were running behind schedule but that \\"it shouldn't be too long\\".  Unfortunately, due to the tiny size of the restaurant, we had to wait outside in the sweltering heat.  Not a big deal if it really was not too long a wait.  After about 15 minutes we checked in and told the hostess that we had a show to go to and just wanted to make sure we would be able to make it.  She said that there were a lot of tables getting ready to leave and that it shouldn't be more than 5 or 10 more minutes.  Mind you there were a bunch of other groups standing around outside getting the same \\"spiel\\".  At about 8:00 we started checking out availability of other restaurants in the areas and noticed a couple of other parties leaving in frustration.  Finally, at 8:15 we were seated with an apology for the wait.  No offer for a complimentary glass of wine, dessert, etc.  Not a pleasant way to start a meal.  Now I totally understand that things happen (like computers going down) but had the hostess told us up front that they didn't know how long it would be and that it could be upwards of 30 minutes or more, that would've been one thing as that would've allowed us to make a decision.  However, to say that it shouldn't be long and then have it be 45 minutes with no complimentary offering, that's another.\\n\\nSo now onto the food...the saving grace.  Everything was clearly home made and freshly prepared.  We had one of the brushchetta specials with barata to start as well as an arugala salad with fruit.  Both were excellent.

The grease soaks RIGHT through their wrapper. Awesome. Sort of.\\n\\nI normally do not go ga-ga over a piece of ground meat in between two buns.

You can literally see the slabs of beef getting ground right before your eyes.\\n\\nThe menu is straightforward for the most part. They offer burgers with beef, bison, tuna, or their homemade veggie patty. They have fries or chili fries. They also have 2 salads. Do not write a review about their salads. I will throw meat in your face. They serve their burgers on challah or this alternative grain bun. Stick with challah; it is dense, buttery, and hearty.\\n\\nI went for the Terlingua, which offered fritos, cheddar, and best of all: chili con carne. Nice. The thick cut tomato, large leaf of lettuce, and slices of onion broke the richness of the meat perfectly. I had it cooked medium rare, and it certainly came out runny and red; exactly how I like it.\\n\\nAs I drove down South Congress, I stared at that burger inside the paper bag, wrapped up in paper, circumscribed by a cardboard support. Should I eat it? Yes. I used the paper bag as my mat. Too bad after my first bite, the juice dripped straight past the paper sheet onto the paper bag. I better eat fast! The buttery challah held up to the juicy, beef, and the vegetables gave that freshness needed to contrast with the richness of chili. Great burger.\\n\\nHopdoddy is a great option for a simple, but well-crafted burger. Everything is done with care, from what I saw. I love when you can see meat being ground for consumption.

I had the pleasure of eating here with my in-laws and the family. We practically ordered over half the menu. Best-food-coma-ever! You can point at anything on the menu and I can assure you that it will be the best version of that food that you have ever had. The mac-n-cheese had the perfect amount of cheese and the portions were huge! Some places tend to overdo it with the cheese, (side note: you can never have to much cheese\\", but I want my mac with a side of cheese and not the other way around. The chicken and waffles come with a bourbon infused syrup which is to die for. They kinda skimp on the syrup and I didn't ask for more, but I'm sure they'll give you more if you ask. The seasoning on the chicken is superb and the meat is juicy. This plate is definitely worth getting. The mash 'taters have the right amount of butter and seasoning. The biscuits are big in size and have a delicious buttered top. I would suggest getting some more butter to put on the inside. The grits are heavenly and just need a pinch of salt, but that really depends on your taste. The cornbread has go to be one of my favorite cornbread of all time. Yes, I've had plenty-o-cornbread from different places. The chicken tenders are huge and just as good as the fried chicken. The fried-green tomatoes are cooked perfectly and aren't greasy. The coleslaw isn't as creamy as you would think, which in my opinion is perfect. I've been to places that go overboard and make the coleslaw too creamy. The fried chicken of course is the star of the show. Crispy & tasty on the outside and juicy & full of flavor on the inside. My absolute favorite side to order is the creamed corn. I could write a book on it, but because this review has gone on far too long I'll just say that if you want to be a better person in life you must have this creamed corn. It will change your life.

Overall a really delicious option. For the sweet part of my breakfast I got the chunky monkey pancakes. It was a very large portion and there was no way I or my partner could finish this and the breakfast sandwich. The pancakes themselves were really good and tasty but I feel like they definitely needed more chocolate chips and more bananas actually inside the pancakes. I think next time I'll go for either their nutella or maybe just try the banana chocolate chip. The only disappointing thing from this experience was that I ordered additional maple syrup for about $2 and what I got was a smuckers maple syrup tiny packet - really over priced for the size and quality.

This is the pizza I've been looking for! This is the best standard non-gourmet pizza you'll find in the Somerville-Medford-Arlington-[insert exurbs I'm forgetting, because there are dozens of them in this square-mile area] corridor! \\n\\nMy wife has been preaching the gospel of Joe Pizza for months now, but I haven't been in the mood for pizza. Too many nights of heartburn and nausea induced by Pinis, Nick's, Top Speed, Eat at Jumbo's, Pizza Days, etc., etc., had reduced me to an anti-pizza state. Years in eastern Massachusetts (a region not regarded for the strength of its pizza) had convinced me that, unless I went the gourmet pizza route or the novelty pizza route, I simply wouldn't eat pizza anymore. No more cheese with pepperoni and olives delivered before a movie marathon, no more Italian sausage with onion delivered after a long day of work. I could order Chinese, I could order wings, and I could order subs, but I couldn't order pizza.\\n\\nJoe Pizza has changed all that. Absolutely amazing pizza. I do feel a bit ambivalent about the price. Yes, they charge for delivery, and if that's enough to dissuade you, then enjoy a crappy, greasy pizza sans delivery charge. If you live close enough to pick up your pie, that's well worth it. Either way, you'll still spend a few dollars more at Joe Pizza than you would elsewhere. It's good pizza, and they know it. For me, it's ultimately worth it. The ingredients are fantastic: the list is exhaustive without being exhausting. Everything is clearly fresh, and completely delicious. The pizza arrives with minimum amounts of grease, which can be avoided entirely by ordering vegetarian. If you do need meat on your pizza, they have fantastic options. And the crust is perfect: just thick and chewy enough without becoming doughy. This isn't a thin crush, so if you're a crunchy crust fanatic, look elsewhere. But for anyone looking for a normal, non-regional pizza, here it is. \\n\\nI haven't tried any of their specialty pizzas, nor have I felt the need. The standard, build-your-own pie is good enough for me. When I'm craving something fancier than that, I go elsewhere. When I want pizza, I come here.

I don't know what kind of amazing coffee shops people are finding out there, but this one is the most incredible I have had the fortune to encounter. Open 24 hours, huge variety of coffees and pastries, free wifi, patio with garage doors to open up the whole shop to the beautiful water fountain, plenty of seating (inside and out), music on Friday and Saturday night, servers who know your order if you frequent enough, free wifi, different soups daily, other non-sweet eats.  My rating is based on my coffee shop experiences and Ava Roasteria progress ridge wins hands down. Starbucks doesn't even come close from an overall experience and Ava's brewed is much better. If coffee in all its varieties is the sole name of your game, maybe a quick drop or drive thru some of the other establishments is suitable. But for the overall experience Ava has my vote!\\n\\nTo be fair, help me find another shop that provides all of this in the Beaverton area and I'm there.

They have happy hour (half off on drinks) from 4-6pm so I was able to get a glass of moscato before our meal. \\n\\nThe concept behind this place is fascinating - combining sushi and burgers. Our waitress was great and went very in depth to explain what to expect on each page on the menu as well as her recommendations for first timers. \\n\\nWe started our meal with the Blackened Tuna Nachos. Unlike what you'd normally expect from nachos, this comes with 5 nicely plated fried wonton chips with a dip and tuna on top. I really enjoyed this appetizer and would definitely come back for it again.\\n\\nFor our meal, we ordered The Turfin' Surfer Roll and The All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi from the Burgushi menu, and Georgia Roll and Mrs. Woodbury's Fresh Find from the fusion specialty sushi menu. The burgushis are worth trying - but probably better in a large group so you wouldn't have to eat 8 pieces by yourself... The cheeseburgooshi is just what you'd imagine - it taste like a burger, in a sushi roll form. I don't recommend this unless you love cheeseburgers. With the turfin' surfer roll, I found it difficult to eat because of how much stuff is on it (steak and tuna). The beef was also very salty. I enjoyed both the fusion specialty rolls, espcially Mrs. Woodbury's Fresh Find since because there was tuna, salmon, and avocado in it (can't go wrong with these!).\\n\\nOverall, the food was decent, but definitely on the pricier side ($15-20)."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm not a donut person.

A great blend of traditional Thai flavours (hot and sour) with fresher, greener west coast flavours. The Dipping sauce that it came with was amazing as well. This dish is the only reason I would come back to Maenam\\n\\nWe ordered the Beef Tom Yum Soup, which for us was way too toned down. The flavour was good, but both of us being lovers of Tom Yum soup would not order this dish again.\\n\\nThe leaf wrapped prawns had interesting flavours and being able to eat the leafs it came in was a nice addition as well. However we didn't find it to be anything special and probalby wouldn't order it again, Especially at the $11+ price tag for 4 shrimps.\\n\\nWe also had the Roti. We thought it would come with some sort of dipping sauce, similar to the Roti Canai at Tropika. But it didn't , it was quite bland on its own, we told this to the waitress and she offered us some peanut sauce but didn't let us know there would be a $3 dollar charge, pretty petty since our bill ended up being $70 plus, Kinda annoyed by this now that I think about it.\\n\\nWhen we first arrived we wanted to have the black bean crab but were told it is sold out and only offered in very limited quantities so if we were interested it is best to order in advance. This was pretty annoying as well. Since they were actively advertising the dish through social media.\\n\\nOverall, the food was clean, fresh and offered a unique refined version of traditional Thai food, but the nuisances of the night will probably keep us from returning.

I like this place because it's typically a lot chiller than the other bars in the area. It also shares a great beer selection with its neighbor Sunset Bar and Grill downstairs. However, my problem with Big City and with Sunset is that the beer always tastes \\"dirty\\" as if they don't clean their taps or tap lines. Maybe I'm a beer snob but when I'm paying good money for good beer I want good beer! Also, I find the food to be pretty bland and uninspired. All that being said, I prefer this bar more than most in the area and frequent it a bit, or used to, mostly because of convenience. This place would be a solid 5 stars if the food and beer were cared for a bit more. That's unlikely to happen since most college ages kids or early 20 somethings typically don't care so much about quality but rather quantity and convenience.

The mixed icy things (I think they are called Chilly Goats) are also quite tasty. I particularly like how they are not overly sweet; you can really taste that coffee/espresso.\\n\\nFOOD= Unfortunately all the scones have been disappointments, which is my main reason for deducting one star. I've tried one with walnuts, something with chocolate and orange, a chocolate chip one, I think one with apricot maybe...? Basically I have given more than three strikes and every time they are underwhelming. They are a little too heavy and don't have enough of the \\"special ingredient\\", so they are mostly just bready.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE= This place always seems crowded, but somehow I can usually find a seat if I want it. Camping out with your laptop and working is also possible and allowed. There's some large round tables in the back, bar window seating, and comfy chairs in the front. There are also outlets and free, working Wi-Fi. There's a large parking lot in the back and along the side of the store, but you may have to wait a bit for a spot to free up because this place is popular.\\n\\nSERVICE= Usually the people at the register are really friendly and the baristas are grumpy. Not sure why. (Exception: this one barista who used to study music education was ridiculously nice, but I haven't seen him there lately.) Sometimes the staff works slowly and there's a longish wait. The service is the other reason for four rather than five stars.\\n\\nSUGGESTION= This store has a ridiculous amount of floor space, but a lot of it is devoted to retail.

The Village Addiction has a cranberry mayonnaise that I would buy if it came in a jar. The sandwich is grilled which makes the bread crunchy and the cheese melted. The Classic Club is a cold sandwich with the bread toasted. This sandwich is huge, and I always look ridiculous trying to eat it.  \\n\\nMy favorite side dish was a kale, squash and goat cheese bread pudding. I'm not sure how often they have this side dish since the options in the case change everyday. The redskin potato salad is awesome if you like potato salad. It is tangy with a nice crunch from the celery. YUM. The pickles come free with every sandwich, and they are really delicious! I find myself always wishing I had an extra pickle with my meal. \\n\\nIf you are in the area and looking for a great lunch, stop in to Brown Bag Deli.

I can't attest to authenticity etc but I can say that I was pretty disappointed in my overall experience here. I agree with previous reviews that mention the ambiance is deceptive because when you walk in it looks like a very nice restaurant and the menu's pricing reflects this. My fiance and I came in around 8 PM on a Sunday night and there was not a single person in the restaurant except a bartender and 3 waiters all just standing around. Oddly enough the didn't great us with any enthusiasm and pretty much ignored us. They made a big production of selecting a table which was pretty comical considering it didn't really matter. Were they expecting a sudden rush?? We are given menus and decide pretty quickly what we want but we are left sitting alone for 15 minutes while the waiters huddle together and chat. Eventually someone wanders over and acts like they are doing us a favor to take our order. Hey thanks. So we wait. 15 minutes later another guy comes over to tell me they don't have in house what I ordered. What the hell was the cook doing for 15 minutes???? So I say \\"you couldn't have told me that when I ordered?\\" (yes I was nice)He just blinks. (Not one of them has ever smiled in all the time they are at the table.) He says \\"what else do you want?\\" I select something quickly because we are STARVING and then our apps finally come out. While we are still eating the apps our entrees come out. The presentation is really cute with each entree placed over little warmers. Too bad none of it was special except the naan. It was flippin awesome. The naan is the reason for the 2 stars. \\nI can not stand being treated like crap by servers in restaurants. I am not a jerk. I am polite, I say please and thank you.

They were very well fried tofu, which is hard to do, with a breading reminiscent of southern fried chicken. The portions, though, were a little big: 8 pieces (the medium size order) is about a whole block of tofu. I normally can't eat more than a quarter block's worth at a time, so I will go for the four piece and some fries the next time. I would also recommend sauce on the side for these guys. Fried tofu is just too different from fried wings, and they don't balance the spicy-vinegary flavor of wing sauce or combat soggy-ness so well. They were still crisp in the restaurant...but I think delivery would have been very soggy with the sauce on top. About 20 flavors of sauces to choose from though, which was cool.\\n\\nOther than that. Cajun french fries done well for frozen crinkle cuts. \\n\\nService was good.

We were excited to dive into that menu--especially the Benedicts menu. \\nThe problem is that, first, everything on both plates was below room temperature, and though the quality of food was high and the menu is adventurous, the cook/chef is trying too hard to make these egg dishes succeed by not keeping it a bit simpler. And I like inventive menus.\\n\\nWe had the Iron Miner's Breakfast and the Shredded Smoked Pork. Just looking at the description on the menu makes your mouth water. But the hash is just petite-cut potatoes with cut tomatoes, a mere hint of onion, and then overwhelmed with too much melted cheddar and chorizo gravy. I don't think there was a hint of salt,  pepper, herbs, spice, or seasonings of any kind. It was just bland. I understand that a cook can define \\"hash\\" any way he/she wants, but to smother it with blandness is not appetizing. Then the very delicious eggs (over easy) were an added soupiness when cut into. Soupy hash anyone? The maple sausage is big and tasty but it was cold like all the ingredients.\\nThe Shredded Smoked Pork had good ingredients, just cold. And bland. And very little pico de gallo. The pork itself tasted as if it had just been boiled in water and cooled. If the cold red potatoes had been cut smaller they may have incorporated what little salt and seasonings there were.\\nI wish we lived closer to Babica Hen so we could return to try all the  other Specialties, Waffle items, and the Yamhill County breakfast.

My wife and I wanted to take my parents out for seafood. That's what you're supposed to do when you have guests from less oceanically-endowed parts of the nation: take them out for seafood. We had already taken my parents to a few nicer restaurants during their visit, so we wanted to dial it down a notch. We wanted to take them out for a fun, laid back, slightly casual, moderately-priced-but-still-delicious version of a nice seafood dinner. This is precisely the niche Summer Shack is supposed to fill. Insofar as it didn't succeed (and hasn't succeeded in the other times I've visited), it's because the food tends toward the laid back and casual, while aspiring for the delicious and upscale. It's simply not as good as it used to be, or wants to be.\\n\\nTheir menu features several exciting selections at moderate prices, but the actual food is either inconsistent or underwhelming. Both my wife and my dad ordered specials from the blackboard (turbot and cod, respectively). I don't care where you're eating, if there are specials, they should either be awesome at least a good-faith attempt at awesome. My dad's turbot was amazing - perfectly cooked, balanced, and well-seasoned. My wife's cod was beyond horrible. It came on a bed of risotto that was essentially inedible. The risotto was so mushy and watery that when you pressed it with a fork, it separated from several tablespoons of water. As a result, her risotto and fish were covered with water after only a couple bites. This was simply an awful dish. \\n\\nI ordered a soft-shell lobster, which was good...but I don't give a restaurant extra points for NOT screwing up lobster. My mom ordered a fried fish sandwich, was was also good. But she clearly ordered sweet potato fries with the sandwich, and the waiter acknowledged this (and informed her it would cost a couple dollars extra - no biggie). When the plate arrived, there were no sweet potato fries. After dinner, we ordered desserts, which were also good. But we had long since finished dessert before the waiter - after ignoring us for a good 15 or 20 minutes - finally came around to our table to ask if we wanted our check. (Of course we did!) The \\"moderate price\\" started to seem a lot steeper relative to the service we received. \\n\\nThis was the worst of my experiences at Summer Shack. Any restaurant that serves a dish as horrible as my wife's risotto deserves only one star...especially if that restaurant has an inexplicably high reputation, is a beloved institution, or shows aspirations beyond what it can deliver. Nevertheless, I'm  generously giving the Cambridge Summer Shack two stars for a couple reasons. First, it is still a great option for anyone in Cambridge or Somerville who wants easy-to-prepare, simple, steamed seafood, but who doesn't want to take the T into Boston. Second, they have a fantastic oyster special after 9 p.m. I'm always a sucker for an oyster special. \\n\\nJust never order anything with risotto."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The best hamburger iv'e ever tasted.. i went there on a friday night with some freinds.

Start with that and you can order extra pieces on the side.\\n\\n# Be careful of that white bread. Use it as a tool to soak away the excess oil from the fried chicken and abandon.

What I didn't like the most, was the combination--or lack--of savory and sweet.  The waffle was great; probably one of the best besides 'off the waffle' and 'waffle window', but the chicken was poorly done.  Chicken breast is already hard to cook and is usually always dry.  Why would you cut it in little strips? And worst of all, there were only like 3 little strips.  The breading wasn't seasoned properly at all.  Chicken and waffle should have that nice balance of a sweet waffle with a savory chicken, and yes, I know, people pour syrup over the chicken but that tastes great only when the chicken is seasoned.  If it's not, then it just taste like sugared chicken.  \\n\\nPORK SCHNITZEL & BISCUIT.  Gravy is excellent;  I loved the chorizo in it and it was seasoned very well.  The pork schnitzel had the same problem as the chicken.

But first let me explain how my experience went! Walking into the restaurant I was completely surprised by the towering menu that has different kinds of burgers, fries, and shakes. I went with the smokehouse burger which came with bacon, double patties, cheese, and peppers. In addition to the burger I got a normal order of fries and a red velvet shake. When I put down the order the cashier guy didn't seem too entertained with his job but he was quick and accurate so I guess not too much to complain about. After waiting for a short little bit, the food was ready and I could not wait to bite into my burger. This sandwich was definitely super tasty since the bacon gave the burger a nice smokey fatty taste and the peppers gave it a bitter yet flavorful combination. The fries were super fresh and hot I would come back to try the cheese fries. As for the shake I was a little disappointed with it since it did not taste like red velvet but rather a strawberry shake. Finally I would like to speak about this location's service. My friend at this location ordered a shroomburger and to her surprise she did not realize that it was a vegetarian burger and thought that it would be a burger that came with a mushroom. So as my group of friends sat there talking about the burger one employee was next to us cleaning tables and she overheard what we had discovered and she chimed in saying, \\"oh no! Would you like for me to replace that burger with a normal burger?\\" Obviously we were caught off guard with this but definitely I must applaud shake shack's training of treating its diners so that they may have the best dining experience. In the end, my friend was able to get another burger without any hassle and we all truly enjoyed our experience at shake shack.

Perfect, Health Box has it, it's fruit poop! It's such a different name but don't let the name stop you from trying it. You won't regret it. Fruit poop is nothing but amazing! I don't ever get addicted to anything, but this could easily become an addiction. Just the other day I realized how much I missed this amazing treat.  I became a regular at the Health Box back in July when they opened and I am long over do for this review. \\n\\nSo here is why I love this delightful cold treat, that we call \\"Fruit poop.\\" First off you are consuming nothing but fruit/vegetables, that's all. So you are consuming all the nutrients and vitamins that you would normally get from eating those fruits/vegetables. Even better, you get to pick and choose what you want in this frozen treat. Which is great for you picky eaters out there and it's also vegetarian/vegan, kid, baby, friendly. What you see on the menu is what they have available to choose from. The combinations' you can put together are endless. They have a variety of fruits and vegetables to choose from, some of the many are; kale, spinach, pineapple, strawberry, cantaloupe, blue berry, and the list goes on. Don't let the kale or spinach intimate you, you can't really taste it. And for an additional price they also have toppings available. Like the fruits and vegetables, whatever topping you see on the menu is what they have available. My personal favorite is the red grape and pineapple topped with granola and coconut. \\n\\nIf the menu confuses you and you are not sure how it works, the owners of the Health Box will be there to save you. These two gentlemen are awesome and they are one of the reasons why I became a regular customer. Not only do they put together an amazing cup of fruit poop but they have the most amazing hospitality. You arrive at the Health Box and they immediately make you feel like you are family. They are two gracious guys, that are super friendly, humble, great to talk too, that have a passion for there product, there business, and have some of the best customer service in town. If you aren't very much into talking  and just want to enjoy your fruit poop in peace, well they will let you do that too.:) They have an awesome sitting area for you/or your family to enjoy. They have a couple picnic tables, chairs, hammocks, and if you are looking for something fun and different they have a swing! It's so fun!  Oh did I mention they are located right by Zilker park/ Town lake? So they are central and on the way to many of Austin's best attractions.\\n\\nIf you are driving down Lamar/Barton Springs and you see a bright green food truck and notice they have fruits and vegetables on there menu (on the front of the truck), it means they are open! If the menu is empty, they are sold out or closed. You can't miss it, it's one of a kind. It has a beautiful roof garden filled with beautiful unique plants.

The first time? Four stars. The second time? Zero stars. Which leaves me with an average of two stars. \\n\\nThe first time my boyfriend and I visited, it was a pleasant experience. It wasn't too crowded, the waiter was attentive, and my food was pretty good. Yay!\\n\\n*** WARNING - RANT AHEAD ***\\n\\nBased on that experience, my boyfriend and I chose to spend Valentines Day here. (Sidenote: this may have actually had more to do with the fact that we forgot to make a reservation until the day before, and this was pretty much the only place we could get in between the hours of 5:00 - 11:00 pm, but alas.) They had a blurb online advertising their \\"Sweetheart Night,\\" which was described an evening with live music, belly dancing, free roses, and a special \\"Sweetheart Menu.\\" Cool!\\n\\nNot advertised: the fact that, in order to cram in as many people as possible, they were seating everyone at communal banquet tables. Which could be cool the other 364 nights a year, but Valentines Day? It seemed like a cheap move, and something that should have been mentioned when we made reservations. \\n\\nIn addition to the odd seating arrangements, there were a number of other things that left us unimpressed. The \\"Sweetheart Menu\\" was...confusing and incredibly limited. The vegetarian entree options were lasagna (huh?), fettucini (what? isn't this a Mediterranean restaurant?), and channa masala (pretty sure that's an Indian dish, but I'll let that one slide because I'm a chickpea addict). There were three or four meat options, a few appetizers, and a couple desserts. What happened to the rest of the menu? And why is everything priced a couple dollars more than usual?\\n\\nI ordered the falafel as an appetizer, and it was cold. The waiter tried to convince me that my entree did not come with a salad, despite the fact that the menu said otherwise. The channa masala was watery and underspiced. My rice wasn't fully defrosted, and was basically inedible. \\n\\nWe had a number of service issues as well. The entire staff seemed incredibly stressed out, which is fair, being Valentines and all, but at least try to keep it under wraps. Our waiter was impossible to track down. I was accidentally charged $51 for my entree. My boyfriend had to go steal a rose for me out of a vase. \\n\\nWe orginially planned on spending the evening at Phara's to enjoy some hookah after dinner, but opted to leave after our dinner and head to another hookah bar. \\n\\nThe whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. \\n\\n*** END RANT ***\\n\\nI DEFINITELY wouldn't recommend spending Valenties Day at Phara's.

Bartender said no and didn't even bother asking what's in it ...2nd person who didn't care. I was starting to see a pattern. Our dinner table was located in a COLD wind tunnel. I felt especially sorry for my wife who was wearing a linen dress. When the waitress first approached and asked if she could get us anything, I jokingly said \\"something warm\\" and then ordered hot soup for starters. She acknowledged that it was very cold at this table. Although she was actually very sweet, there was no \\"let's see if we can get you a different table\\" or had the manager address it. I'm calling that a 3rd not caring. \\n\\nI ordered a shrimp dish that had 5 medium shrimp (not jumbo as stated) in a curry sauce for $18. It was good but not $18's good. My wife's dish was alright.  However, it was so cold and windy at our table that we never really settled into place for a nice meal. We were in a rush to eat the meal before it also got too cold. In addition, since it was so LOUD, it was difficult to have a conversation without needing to yell above the din.

They were fairly busy but we were seated right away. The tables along the side of the restaurant are reallllly close together; the waiter actually had to maneuver it to the side so that my boyfriend could get into the booth bench. This does cause a bit of difficulty in having conversation, and also in placing orders for the person sitting on the outside of the table - I had to turn almost completely around both times our waiter came by to talk to us.\\n\\nThe ordering process is a bit weird as you have to order appetizers and entrees at once, but we put in our drink order at the same as our food. I tried the cojito, and it was probably the best thing I had there; perfect amount of coconut and the mint wasn't overwhelming as it sometimes can be in mojito-like drinks. We started with an order of the empanada trio; I found it a bit odd that the server did not explain to us which of the three was which. They were all pretty good and came with a creamy mojo sauce that I really enjoyed. \\n\\nFor dinner I ordered the beef tenderloin churrasquito and my boyfriend had the costillitas (baby back ribs with a guava bbq sauce). When our food arrived it looked great - and the ribs certainly were. My food was less than stellar, mostly owing to the fact that every bit of food on my plate was cold. I would have been happy to point this out to our server had he come back to check on us at all, but he didn't until my boyfriend had finished his food (which I tried and was great!), and came to take our plates away and give us our check at our request.\\n\\nSo, while I'm sure the issue with my food was a one off, I also feel like the issue with the service is not. I've never before been to a restaurant where a diner will sit with a full plate of food in front of them for 20 minutes, while occasionally trying to get someone's attention, and to not even have a question raised about it while the plate is cleared except to ask if I wanted to take it home. I even told him when he was taking it away that it wasn't great and still nothing. It was so weird to me that he didn't pick up on any of that and didn't even check in on us once the food was delivered or to see if we wanted other drinks. I'm never the sort to make a big deal about something like this, but would have asked that the food maybe be refired briefly to get it up to temperature had I been given the opportunity."},{"name":"Banya Japanese Restaurant","address":"8166 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I have only eaten there for lunch and it was a great experience.

I have to say... N&H Saigon Sub totally made my day!\\n\\nI knew what I wanted before I ever walked in - a tofu bahn mi and a strawberry bubble tea.  After I ordered, the owner immediately asked me if I had ever been there before.  I told him that I had not, but wanted to come try the place after seeing it here on Yelp.  He thanked me for coming by and giving them a chance, then proceeded to tell me all about their shop!  They make their own sauces, and he showed me all the fresh fruit they cut up every day for their bubble tea!  He was so nice and friendly, and once my order was ready, he told me to have a seat and enjoy my meal, and that I could pay later.\\n\\nSo I did just that!  I bit into that tofu bahn mi and I was instantly in heaven.  The tofu was seasoned perfectly - not too firm and not too squishy.  The bread was nice and crusty on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.  The vegetables were fresh and the flavor, while simple, was out of this world!  One sandwich was really almost too much for me, but even though I was full I totally wanted to order another one!\\n\\nI resisted, though!  After I paid I chatted with the owner for a little while.  It is SO nice to find a friendly place like this.  I'll definitely be back, maybe even once a week!  It's just a short trip for me, and the price is so nice.  I'll be bringing all my friends.

Each of the items we ordered came with a bowl of rice.  The pork belly dish came with a soup as well.\\n\\nThe pork belly was served in a cast iron dish on top of a bed of cabbage.  The pork belly was tasty but didn't strike me as particularly special.

If you want real Turkish food in an upscale environment this is the ONLY place to get it in Atlanta. \\n\\nTruva is a gem. Located downtown, it can get a little quiet on weekends as the downtown crowd flees to the suburbs or Buckhead, but that just leaves room for you to get to know your server and the friendly restaurant owner. The menu features authentic Turkish dishes from mezze to kebabs to pide, and, of course, authentic Turkish coffee and cay. My dinner mates (both Turkish) swear that Truva has the most authentic food and best tasting Turkish food in Georgia (aside from my mutfak (kitchen), of course. :))\\n\\nThe best part? The dessert . . . My searches for Turkish restaurants always begin and end with a critical question: But, do they have kunefe? Truva is the ONLY restaurant with a resounding yes in the Atlanta area, and, what a delicious kunefe, too! Seriously, it's worth the trip downtown just to get the kunefe!\\n\\nThe restaurant is upscale and the d√©cor a wonderful change of pace from the dirty, sit on the floor and smoke nargile restaurants that bill themselves as \\"authentically\\" Turkish. Trust me, if you go to Turkey you will be eating at Truvas and not Caf√© Istanbuls or Divans. Plus, Truva still has the requisite bellydancer, so you will be getting the best of it all.\\n\\nAs a note: many of the other reviews on Yelp mention the lack of other people in the restaurant or the push to the buffet. That should take away any stars though from an otherwise terrific evening, and it's up to only us to change this. Go on a weekend evening when there is no buffet, and let's fill this place up! It's a keeper, and I and my belly would like to see it stay around for a long time!\\n\\nTake the time and take a date (or a group of friends) to Truva. You'll be enchanted by the music and the dancers and leave with a full belly and an otherworld taste experience.

Sesame ribeye tacos were outstanding, best of all I tried, along with the duck taco. Chicken taco was good (and saucy), as was the portabello w/queso fresco. Chicken rice bowl was also good, with nicely sauced chicken (same chicken from the tacos) and colorful, julienne peppers & red onion atop perfectly cooked brown rice ($7). \\n\\nThe half rotisserie chicken ($8), although well-cooked and very juicy, was rather bland. The mushroom mole tamale ($5) was also a bit bland (although tamales do typically lean to the bland side, in my opinion). Of everything we tried, these were our least favorite and I wouldn't order them again.\\n\\nBartaco offers plenty of options, from baja fish to wild boar tacos. They range from $2.50 to $3.50 each, or slightly less if you purchase a set of three. Sides are $2.50, or $7 for three, and include options like the aforementioned grilled corn, chipotle slaw, and spicy cucumber salad.\\n\\nDrinks looked tasty, but I only tried the Spindrift sparkling soda ($3.75/bottle): blackberry & mango orange are both good. But don't expect a sugary, high-fructose-corn-syrup blast, because these sodas are made with cane sugar and have pleasantly mellow flavors.\\n\\nSpiced chocolate pudding ($5) was a good, but unremarkable dessert. A healthy portion of chocolate pudding, topped with fresh whipped cream and hazelnut crumble (tasty but reminiscent of granola). \\n\\nI'd return to Bartaco to enjoy the ambience and try some different flavors, bearing in mind that the prices add up (obviously, it's tapas). As noted, service was excellent, with management warmly inquiring about our experience, and comment cards provided to leave comments or suggestions for this newly-opened (and beautifully designed) addition to West Midtown."},{"name":"Casa Maria","address":"4327 S 1st St, Ste 102","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If we lived in a perfect world where salsa was currency (I'm still working with the Fed on this), then Casa Maria would be Fort Knox.\\n\\nI'm a bit of a salsa snob partly because I love the stuff but mostly because I'm pretty sure that the \\"manna\\" that rained-down on Moses and his peeps was chips and salsa (this was BC so queso was not yet on the scene).

Frankly, we found these dishes to be quite inedible. The third dish - Dan Dan noodles - was decent. When we complained to the staff, we got the Nasi Goreng replaced with a Tamarind Glazed Cod dish. That particular dish was quite good, and it somewhat redeemed the experience (not enough though!).

When the steak came out (promptly) it was juicy and perfectly rare... just the way I like it.  The baked potato initially comes out without any toppings, but is added by your waiter/waitress at your table.  My experience at Sullivans was excellent.

Its a gourmet burger with lots of twists but all in all its not too pricey as it is trendy.\\n\\nBecause of the lines I felt like the meal was rushed and the waiter we had was trying to move us a long and get us out so they could turn the table as fast as possible. The mangers constantly strolled the floor and acted like hawks over the staff, making me feel watched and pressured. Management should not be seen and felt in this fashion.

It's hard to screw up a burger IMO, but it's something else to serve such fancy burgers with super fancy ingredients and toppings like Hopdoddy does.\\n\\nHopdoddy has the classic burger, which I will probably never order considering the selection of fancy burgers. My first time here, which was actually at the newer Anderson location, I had planned on getting the Prime Time burger, but when we got in line, my friend and I noticed the special, the Mac and Cheese burger--a fried Mac and Cheese patty on top of bacon and a burger patty. Death, basically. I could barely go back to work after finishing that thing, but it was worth it. \\n\\nI went to the SoCo location for my second visit, where I got the Ahi Tuna burger. This was not as monstrous as the Mac and Cheese, but just as delicious in its own right. The tuna was quickly seared so just the outside of the patty was cooked while the inside remained raw--that was a pretty great way to have tuna. The rest of the ingredients like honey wasabi and nori chips meant this was like a sushi roll in burger form. My brother ordered the Prime Time which I tried a bite of and plan to get it next time I go to Hopdoddy. Of course, I'm determined to try every other burger there, like the Magic Shroom and Janis Joplin (veggie burger).\\n\\nFunny thing about the Mac and Cheese: there was about a week between my first and second visits. At SoCo, they had the Mac and Cheese too, and the hostess said at the Anderson location started it first recently, and news spread about it by word-of-mouth, so they decided to make it at SoCo. I had posted a pic or two about it after trying it at Anderson, so I feel I was somewhat instrumental in its popularity/infamy :D\\n\\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice at both locations--I liked the colors and decor at both, and of course the places were just bustling. You'll probably be waiting in line for 5-10 minutes before you get to order since so many love to come for lunch. ***EDIT: forgot to say here that the servers and bartenders, at least the ones I talked to, were very friendly and outgoing. They did a good job making me feel welcome and comfortable. \\n\\nLast thing I'll mention: I ordered a beer at the bar in SoCo, and noticed they keep all of their clean glasses to serve in a deep freezer, so the glasses come out super frosted and keep the beer cold longer; I thought that was pretty cool. Anyway, if you've heard about Hopdoddy but haven't yet been, whether you're new in town or not, do yourself a favor and plan a visit.

This review is only based on their pizza since that's all I've had the few times I've gone. People have raved about their pizza the most, so I figure why not try it? If you like Chicago, deep dish style pizza, then you'll like what BJs offers. The pizzas might not look that big, but since the slices are so thick, you fill up pretty quickly. The sweet pig pizza (Pineapple, seasoned tomatoes and oven-roasted ham) is just your typical hawaiian pizza, and the BJ's favorite pizza (Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes) is just like a fancy shmancy supreme pizza. Both were pretty tasty and worth having again.\\n\\nWe did take advantage of their 2 for $20 deal which comes with a side salad, a pizza to share, and a pizookie to share. I admit that I went with this deal because I really wanted to try their pizookie, which according to them is a deep dish cookie topped with ice cream. Supposedly this is what they are famous for (besides their beer). The side salad? Meh. Nothing to write home about. The pizza was good as usual, but the biggest disappointment was the pizookie. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia with vanilla bean ice cream. Any warm dessert a la mode is good, but I was expecting something bigger and thicker. The cookie was pretty thin, and it was a bit too sweet. The ice cream did balance it out, but in the end we had more ice cream than cookie left, which normally doesn't happen. I compare their pizookie to the cookie monster at Cheddar's, and the cookie monster is SO much better. The only thing that the pizookie has going for it is the fact that you have many types to choose from.\\n\\nIf I come back again, I'll probably check it out during happy hour and take advantage of the half deal on their mini pizzas which is probably the perfect size for me."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've been here twice, and each time was tasty and delicious.\\n\\nThe first visit was with a few Yelpers, and I ordered The Parish Chicken Sandwich.

He got the Elephant Walking On Eggs \\"sandwich From The Mountain\\". He was pleasantly surprised, and left very full and satiated. He offered me a bite, but I declined based on the abundance of pungent goat cheese. I'm just a picky cheese girl. A boring cheese eater.  Oh well.

When my in laws are in town we choose it over Legal's.  Why?  Because we loved the food, portions and atmosphere.  In the past the food was always good, the portions satisfying and service great.  After the renovations of the Alewife location, we came in with my in laws and the changes not only included the decor, but the portions shrunk and the prices jumped.  The place went from a New England style clam shack (which kept cute glimpses of Aku Aku) to schizophrenic version of itself.  \\n\\nThe portions were dramatically smaller.  The steamers, a New England staple,  we're half of what the prior versions had been, the fish portions went from entree size to appetizer size.  Even the corn bread and rolls shrunk.  My inlays noticed right away.  Then we checked out the prices.  WOW.  \\n\\nWe decided to give it another go last night.  We first chose the buffalo shrimp and mussels for appetizers. We chose mussels, because they had no steamers?  No steamers?  There is no red tide at the moment, a New England seafood restaurant with no steamers is like going to the Louvre and finding they took down the Mona Lisa for maintenance.  \\n\\nWe sent back the mussels because 6 we're not opened, and 5 came sans the mussel.  We then ordered the bluefish special and monk fish with roasted potatoes.  Both meals very tasty, but after I was done, I felt like I do when I eat at McDonalds; still hungry.  For $24 I at least expect my hunger pains to wain.  My son had the corn fried fish fingers which he loved and the dessert for him was very good.  We also learned many of the staff is gone and it was pretty noticeable.\\n\\nKids meals seem to be the only worthwhile thin Summer Shack got right and stuck to its original concept.

Fries are crispy and salted, hush puppies fluffy and kind of sweet, onions rings are probably best I've had. The wings are small, not denying that, but cooked nicely and the extra hot is indeed that.

I had to wait quite a bit for the creme brulee donuts, but when they called me up to the counter, they added an extra one for the wait. That's good customer service.  I wasn't too irritated with the wait because while I was waiting, I relaxed with their coffee (very tasty) and started in on the other 2 flavors.

The BEST thing is the sea salt caramel shake.. definitely NOT for those on a diet because it is super rich.\\n\\nBurger wise, their ahi-tuna burger is excellent. The nori chip adds a bit of crunch that it needs since the burger is cooked medium-rare and the burger can be mushy. It isn't slices of ahi like I was expecting, but ground ahi. Just as good. The best part of the burger is the bun. Super light, sweet and buttery and lightly toasted. It totally makes the burger. The fries are huge!

I want to eat and drink here for every meal from now on! This place is very open and spacious with tons of seating but the bar is where the magic happens. Our bartenders were amazing and helpful when selecting wines. With all of their suggestions I ordered one white and one red by the end of the night. They also walked us through the food menu which I was thrilled about because I had lived in Barcelona for a year and have been looking for a place that has comparable tapas. I was not let down I ordered the hanger steak, which was cooked to perfection with perfectly seared edges, a warm red center, and topped off with a truffle vinaigrette. Also I ordered the patatas  bravas because they are a staple to tapas and again, I was not let down! To finish off the meal we ordered the sugar cookies that were filled with caramel... PLEASE TRY THIS PLACE TOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"},{"name":"La Quercia","address":"3689 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I think this might have been the most disappointing dining experience of any restaurant I have ever visited at any price point. I booked a reservation for a party of eight over a month in advance. Because La Quercia considered us a a \\"large\\" party (greater than five), we were obligated to buy into their \\"alla famiglia\\" dining at $60 a person, which we willingly did in advance out of consideration for the kitchen and wait staff. Toward the end of our dinner, we were pushed out the door by the serving and managerial staff who literally told us our reservation was up. I was stunned, given that since we were dining alla famiglia, we were not in control of how quickly the food came out of the kitchen. We were also seated for over fifteen minutes (one of our guests for 30 minutes) before they took a  beverage order, so I hasten to mention that the delay in our pace of eating should not be placed on our shoulders. I suppose we should have eaten faster? Or talked less? One thing was clear: La Quercia is prioritizing customer volume at the expense of satisfaction. This establishment failed at basic hospitality, and I was embarrassed to have invited colleagues and an out-of-town guest into such treatment."},{"name":"Leaky Roof","address":"1538 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ohhh...fun, chill Happy Hour.\\nGreat prices on HH burger, fries.

Is it a Fisher Price toy for newborns?  A bucket for carrying your hops around?  The name of a small village in southwestern Ireland?  Nobody really knows.  \\n\\nI tried the cheeseburger, which was tender and delicious, along with seasoned fries.  Both were very good.  I guess the only problem I had while eating is that I was just so confused about what Hopdoddy is that I couldn't really concentrate on what I was eating.  You see, Hopdoddy is a bar..no wait..it's a restaurant!  Actually, it's a BURGER BAR!  \\n\\n(And, when I write \\"burger bar\\", you're probably thinking to yourself \\"hey, that sounds kinda cool and relaxing\\".  But, it actually isn't because it's uber-modern chic with lots of exposed concrete, hard surfaces, and half the IKEA catalog decorating the place.) \\n\\nAlso, the concept of checking in first with a server, then going to the back of the restaurant to order, then checking back in with the server again is either the most bass-ackwards or most genius idea ever.  \\n\\nIn short, Hopdoddy is not really sure what it is, but the burgers are pretty good."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My family and I enjoyed all the donut options.
