Usually I can get around it by smelling what everyone else is eating and having a nice salad without croutons or dressing.

I love the decorations. I love the people that work here. Everything is set up to give you some sort of a kitchy experience. \\n\\nI never liked corn dogs. I still don't like corn dogs. I do, however, like Pallookaville's corn dogs. These are the best corn dogs I've tasted. \\n\\nI tried their Corndogula, which comes with 100% beef frank, and their Cornleone, which comes with Italian Sausage. They also had Frayinstein. Our server said the Frayinstein is a size of a small child's arm. I didn't feel like eating a child's arm so I opted for the smaller corn dogs. \\n\\nIf you had to choose, get the Corndogula. This is the traditional, good-old fashioned, classical corn dog. The 100% beef frank made it taste great. The cornbread batter tasted amazing. It had the right amount of sweet and the right amount of savory from the frank to create something magical. \\n\\nThe Cornleone was good too. However, it pales in comparison to the Corndogula. Maybe next time time, I should try the Corndogski, which comes with Kielbalsa. But I don't know, that Corndogula was so good. I don't know if I can be tempted away from ordering the Corndogula again.  \\n\\nThey have 3 condiments on the table to use for the corndog: Ketchup, Mustard, and Grainy Mustard. Try all three! But I would go for the Grainy Mustard. If you wanna feel like a kid again, Ketchup is acceptable. \\n\\nI tried their boiled peanuts. It was okay. I didn't like the weird flavoring they put on it. Maybe if they had a more normal tasting boiled peanuts? They were boiled fine. It's not something I'll get again. \\n\\nI also tried their poutine. I liked it. I think it needed more gravy though. It felt like it was just Fries and Cheese Curds. \\n\\nI wasn't a fan of their Pork Hamburger. It tasted too much like pork to me. Not that it's a bad thing, but I like my burgers with beef. It's a good gimmick though. Just give me a good, old fashioned beef burger done to medium rare with a nice, toasted bun please. \\n\\nTheir Pimento Cheese Sandwich was absurd. It had so much cheese, I felt like I was eating a huge cheese block with a piece of bread. I would think even die-hard cheese lovers would get sick of the amount of cheese on this sandwich. \\n\\nThey also had sodas made with real cane sugar. They come in all sorts of flavors. I love sodas. So I tried their banana soda. It tasted like what a banana soda should taste like--very artificial and not like the real thing. It reminded me of banana candies. My wife was not a fan. I was. I want to try all their sodas. \\n\\nI tried their Vegan Cherry Pie and their Peanut Butter Pie. Their Vegan Cherry Pie was okay. It just tasted like your everyday Cherry Pie, for the most part. The crust, being a vegan crust, didn't taste that good. I don't know why. The Peanut Butter Pie's crust was great. Maybe because it wasn't vegan. I guess animal products taste good. \\n\\nTheir Peanut Butter Pie was so creamy and decadent. I loved the rich peanut butter flavor. If you wanna try a pie, try this pie. \\n\\nI liked Pallookaville Fine Foods. I hate corn dogs, but I'll drive 45 minutes to gorge on their corn dogs. It's a great, family and hipster friendly place.

They have an amazing selection of coffee/beverages and their food menu is STELLAR! AJ and I ordered the Se7en Platter and the Cuban sandwich. Both were amazing! I am half Cuban so I am very protective over my Cuban sandwiches, this one did NOT disappoint. It even had a fried green tomato inside it accompanied by chips. My only comment would be they need to actually press the sandwich, beyond that 5 stars for sure! As for the platter definitely some of the best grits I've ever had and I LOVE me some grits. The flavors were very subtle but different from anything I've ever tasted in grits before. They were amazing. Also that biscuit with strawberry jam!! Let's just say I buried my face in it...\\n\\nWe also got the cold pressed coffee and a cappuccino. Over all a fantastic meal. I can see why this place is so popular and how huge I'm sure it will blow up after the food network episode with Guy Fierri airs. I also LOVE that this place is chef owned.

By \\"objectively\\" I mean that sampling the food in a different environment (more on that later) proved it was other-worldly.  But my actual on-site visit was 4* at best.  Here's why: \\n\\nIn a genius \\"True Yelper\\" move, I placed a pick-up order exactly 6 weeks in advance.  This allowed me to order not just take away items (a whole Brisket and a whole turkey breast), but also individual items to eat there (1lb of rib, 1lb turkey, 1lb brisket, potato salad, slaw, and bourbon banana tarts).  The entire order was hundreds of dollars, but allowed me to both dine in while avoiding a line I couldn't be in (because my flight to Austin didn't land early enough for me to be there at 4, 5, 6 or 7am), and also bring home the 'ultimate souvenir.'\\n\\nI had booked the last pick up time slot of the day at 1pm, and after landing, renting the car, and making my way there, that worked perfectly.  I confirmed my order with the take out window at 1:00.  I'd paid a $75 deposit when the order was placed, and the balance was due at pickup, so I was given the receipt, and saw it had a tip line (which I don't like to see on a pick up order), but because there was a dine-in portion of my order, I did leave a decent tip.\\n\\nThere were several picnic tables set up in the take out area, and all were empty.  I carried our order to one of them, and was very quickly admonished, being told that those were for 'dine-in' orders only.  This pisses me off (then and now), because: 1. I was there at the absolute last time slot for pick up; 2. the tables were empty; 3. I HAD a dine-in portion (though it was part of a take away order); 4. I'd left a tip I really shouldn't have.  So this part of my experience really soured me, and I think management should rethink the rigidity here.\\n\\nWe took our food by car to a nearby park, where we saw some other 'take out exiles' eating while standing.  We unwrapped everything, and the food was good, but not mind-blowing.  BUT: being under-whelmed may have resulted from my take-out experience, and the vast sum of FLIES that wanted to share in my feast, making it REALLY hard to focus on the food (basically: bad \\"ambiance\\" score due to insects).  I can objectively confirm one thing though: Salt Lick still wins my potato salad award (both the slaw and potatoes were just average to me).  Also, of the rib, turkey, and brisket, we were most impressed with the rib meat.\\n\\nChapter 2:\\nThanks to 2 cooler bags and lots of ice from the hotel, I safely transported the brisket and turkey home to Miami.  I used my Joule sous-vide machine to reheat the meat to an exact 165F in a few hours.  I then found a YouTube video by Franklin BBQ itself, directing on where to make the cuts, which I did.  The result: just amazing freaking meat.  I've never been a brisket fan, but this converted me, and this must be the first time in history where the take-out surpassed the original\\n\\nSo I HIGHLY recommend the take out (in fact, the 6-stars I'd give the take-out is what elevates my 4* initial rating to a 5), and I'm forced to assume that if my initial experience had been indoor, or if I'd been allowed to remain at the pick up outdoor tables, it would have been equally sublime."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is great and the portions are hefty and I don't consider myself someone with a small appetite.

I am from the deep south and have found the food to be a fairly high quality reproduction of blue collar soul food available in most southern states.  With that being said, we have enjoyed the food.\\n\\nThe problem that we had was the customer service of the owner.  We called a week ahead and asked the manager specifically if they would mind doing a catfish and waffles instead of the regular chicken and waffles.  They have catfish on the dinner menu and they told us that it would be no problem. They said to just tell our server who could quickly pull some catfish out to fry up. \\n\\nWhen we arrived that same weekend (and excitedly waited over 1.5hrs for a table), we told our server of the catfish request and he said no.  We explained that we came specifically for it and that we had called in advance.  He left and talked to the owner (who was expediting) and she said no.  \\n\\nLong and short, the food is good at the screen door.  The problem to a southerner is : dont offer southern food with less than hospitable service.  For anyone who has worked in a restaurant in the past, you know it is faster to fry catfish than chicken and is a simple - take out of the bucket and put in a fryer.  I know it is busy but if we call ahead, whether or not the other manager should have said yes, you should honor the request.  \\n\\nThe main issue that we had - the place came off as little more than a turn and burn.  It says a ton when the owner of a well known and established place is working and turns down a well-thought-out request.  If you, or anyone on your staff, offers a certain level of customer service - stick by it.  They are certainly not hurting for money so just take the time to stand by your word.  \\n\\nNow i am sure this comes off as petty, but seriously, southern food should be served with unhurried care and service.

While they do offer gluten free dough, they are NOT celiac / gluten intolerant friendly. They do change their gloves, but all of the toppings have already been contaminated by retrieving the toppings with unclean gloves for previously made pizzas. They additionally use the same paddles and ovens as the regular dough and thus nothing is actually gluten free.

My friend celebrated her birthday here last weekend, and there was a crowd of ten of us.  We sat in the hibachi section, where more than one party can sit around two grills.  We had our own private chef who was VERY entertaining-- a total ham.  My friends ordered hibachi while my boyfriend and I ordered sushi; he's not huge on the quality of hibachi, and I can never say no to sushi.  We started with the fried Gyoza dumplings, filled with pork.  These dumplings were actually pretty good.  My friends each had the complimentary mushroom and broth with a Crispy Salad.  Their hibachi orders ranged from shrimp to chicken to steak served with fried rice and a range of vegetables.  My boyfriend and I shared the Fashion Maki, Tuna and Eel Maki, Amazing Tuna, and Sunshine Maki.  I think we over-ordered because each roll arrived in a set of 8-10...there was no room for our food!  I was shocked by the amount and overwhelmed and stuffed by the sushi at the end of the night.  We still had about 14 pieces that we had to pack to take home.  It was the first time I've been conquered by sushi so badly.  I thought the fish was not fresh, and the rolls were too saucy; however, I wasn't completely disappointed.

It was the only vegan pastry though. \\n\\nI also got a smoothie - banana, chocolate, espresso and soy milk. I guess the espresso they usually use for smoothies has milk in it, so the barista just put a shot or two of hot espresso which is fine by me. He said it wouldn't mix quite right but it was fine. I appreciate his honesty and knowledge about the products. I had asked for a small/regular - 16 oz? But instead he gave me a 24 hr - huge!

It's pie time! \\n\\nAs pie lovers, we were not about to skip dessert, so chose the personal-sized key lime and pecan pies (the 3rd option was Lemon Chess, which we later cursed ourselves for not taking to-go). Our pies came with business cards from Cake and Spoon, which we later found out is a baking company with regular presence at the downtown farmer's market, and who had baked these gems and who were obviously born to do so. We are super pie nerds, with big demands for both crust and filling -- neither should be so buttery, flavorful, or sweet as to overwhelm the other. It's a tough trick, but Cake and Spoon executed it beautifully. The key lime pie crust was a perfect blend of graham and butter, with a tart sweet filing that managed a perfect custard texture even in 102 degree heat. The pecan pie was a real find, though -- too often pecan filling is all corn syrup and the sweetness is totally overwhelming. Not so here -- the pecan flavor was outstanding, with just enough sweetness to allow the pecans to really shine. This is one damn good dessert.

WHOOPS. I'll break it down into three categories: service, food, atmosphere.\\n\\nService: \\n\\nThe people were nice and friendly, but our burgers were COLD (and I mean cold, not just \\"not hot\\" or lukewarm, but iceberg cold) when we got them. As I don't think they came out of the kitchen cold, that means they sat for a good while.  On top of that, we got our fries probably 15 minutes before we got our burgers. The result? Cold ass fries when we went to eat them with the burgers. It was cool to have something to munch on while we waited a very long time for our burgers, but fries are meant to be served with the burger, not as an appetizer. Strangely, it doesn't seem like it was just us who got their fries first. I watched table after table get fries, and not get their burgers for awhile. That is BIZARRE and WRONG if you ask me.\\n\\nFood: \\n\\nI ordered the blue heaven special (blue cheese sauce, pork belly, lettuce, fried onion straws).  My date ordered a burger with bbq sauce, cheddar, bacon, and fried onion straws. We also got small orders of poutine and black and white fries.\\n\\nThe black and white fries were pretty good, had a nice bite, and were fairly satisfying. However, a tad bit overpriced. The poutine was VERY overpriced, and while semi tasty, had almost no gravy on it. The cheese curds were good, but their Beechers, so they can't really take credit for that. Also, the gravy is tomato based, which is just...not poutine. Overall, the fries were pretty decent though.\\n\\nHere's where it gets worse. The meat was bland (underseasoned, NO SALT), of poor quality, and again, cold for both burgers. The bun was soggy, and had no flavor and was not toasted (I like mine toasted, but I can overlook that). The blue cheese sauce didn't taste much like blue cheese (I was warned of that when I asked about the burger), and the flavors were muddle and one note. Also, the onion straws were soggy, not crisp at all, and VERY greasy. \\n\\nMy date ate 3 bites of her burger and threw in the towel (thought it was gross). Her onion straws were also soggy. Her bacon was perhaps the smallest, worst quality, bacon I have ever had. The cheese was fine. She shared my feelings about the lack of seasoning and the poor bun. \\n\\nOur total was $31.25. SUPER expensive when you consider you can go to many other burger places, get better food, the same quantity of food, and pay about $10-$15 less than we paid. For example, two delish burgers at Burgatroyd and two huge orders of fries, $17. \\n\\nMaybe the food would have been better had it been served hot, but that wouldn't have fixed the overpriced bit, the poor quality, underseasoned meat and bacon, or the soggy bun. \\n\\nAvoid this place, or at least lower your expectations when eating here. \\n\\nI'd rather have Burgerville to be honest."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Awesome, down home, country feel joint that is intimate to say the least.

However, almost instantly we were berated and screamed at for not being ready to tell her our order, and she continued to demand what we wanted in an annoyed and absurdly unnecessary tone. Mind you, we were the only people there left to order at that point...so the rushing and attitude was completely unwarranted. \\n\\nThere is no excuse for outrageously poor customer service, there is no excuse to raise your voice and ostracize a customer to the point of being clearly annoyed yelling.

I am not a vegan, and unfortunately, when I went in, I was looking for low-fat, high protein healthy, and not yummy, rich, vegan substitute for stroganoff (which I got anyway, cause I effing LOVE stroganoff). \\n\\nThe salad bar looks all fresh and organic, but the price was almost $10 per pound.  I know my salads easily run over a pound, because I like to add things like broccoli, peas, etc. I am not paying more than $10 for a salad. Sorry.  That's the downside of this place. The hot food is all almost $9 a pound, and when you are getting thick, heavy, creamy, juicy hot food, you get to 1 lb real dang quick.  So, while you are getting really tasty, organic, made with love food, you're gonna pay for it.\\n\\nThey offer lots of tasty healthy drinks and kombucha, and have a few tables to sit and enjoy the food.  The dreadie server was nice enough to me, and I was thanked by a guy who looked like the owner when on my way out, so I did feel welcome and appreciated, which is always nice, when you've just spent $13 on one box (not even close to full) of take out food. \\n\\nOver all, I have to give 4-stars for the vegan-ness, the commitment to sustainability and organic food, and because damn... that mushroom stroganoff was really good.  Come with an open mind, leave with a full belly."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're havin' brunch problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems but chicken ain't one. \\n\\nI'm going to make this short and savory, Screen Door has hands down the best chicken and waffles I have ever had the pleasure of shoving through my gullet.

I decided to make a special trip to Hey Cupcake! to cheer myself up. I stopped at the Burnet Rd location on my way to drop off some rusty paint cans and bottles of pesticides at the city's HWF. It was easy to identify the store because of the large fiberglass cupcake that adorns the roof of the building.\\n\\nI was greeted by a lady inside a mock-up of an Airstream camper. Apparently that is where the cupcakes are kept. I ordered four cupcakes of various kinds. She boxed them up in a cute box. I grabbed half the napkins out of the dispenser, grunted my appreciation, and I was out the door. I could hardly wait to get back to my truck. I wanted to eat one of the cupcakes (\\"The Standard\\") right then.\\n\\nI placed my box of cupcakes on the center console. I was excited as I anticipated the flood of dopamine from my first bite. I pulled the flap back and was faced with a dilemma. The box was just large enough for the four cupcakes. They were arranged mutually tangent and hugged the sides. There was no way to put your hand in the mass of frosting without creating a mess.\\n\\nI managed to extract one of the plump cupcakes.  My hand was a frosted mess. I did my best to mop the frosting off my hands. In hindsight I should have just ripped the sides of the box off and saved myself a mess. I edged the cupcake towards my face. My pancreas was screaming at me to stop but my stomach said it felt right.\\n\\nThe cupcake is almost to my mouth but it has a defense mechanism up its wrapper. To my horror the cap of the cupcake jumps off and lands on the floorboard. Due to the laws of buttered toast-physics it lands icing side down. I bend forward to pick up the icing glob off the floor. The box of cupcakes on the center console saw what had happened to their maimed friend. They sprang into action and the box slipped off the seat at that very moment.\\n\\nI pleaded with the box to not do it. It took the plunge, anyway. There was nothing I could do. My left hand was engulfed in chocolate frosting and my right hand was trying retain crumbly cake. Plop, plop, plop. The three cupcakes all ended up on the floor. \\n\\nIt was horribly unfair. I had not come here to be judged by cupcakes. The day could not have gotten any worse. I felt the hot tears well up in my eyes. I used the back of my frosted hand to wipe my eyes. I got chocolate frosting in my eyes. This only made me cry harder. Chocolate frosting ran down my face like ruined makeup.\\n\\nI ate the frosting and the crumbly cake between racking sobs. I tried to clean my hands off but all my napkins were gone. I did not care anymore and just used the front of my new shirt. I stamped on the cupcakes on the floorboard. Die, Die, Die. A van full of kids pulled up next to me. The side door slide open and they started to shamble out.\\n\\nThe kids saw me and stared. I noticed their gawking. I screamed at them. \\"I eat alone to hide my shame. Don't look at me!\\" All they heard was muffled yelling as a torrent of cake batter and frosting sprayed out of my mouth.  I placed my chocolate-hand against the window in attempt to hide my shame. Their mother came around from the driver's side to see what had the kids so enraptured.\\n\\nThe mother gave me a disgusted look. She ushered them into Hey Cupcake!. She gave me one last  judging glance and The Evil Eye. She notices the rusted paint cans and junk in the back of my truck. I felt like a freak. I rammed my keys into the ignition, slammed my truck into gear and screeched out of the parking lot. One of the rustiest paint cans exploded in the back. Cars honked. People yelled.\\n\\nOverall the one cupcake I managed to taste was delicious. It was just a little hard to manage. I am the only one responsible for my emotional outbreak. I am just a shame eater. I did make it to the Hazardous Waste Facility."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Superb experience.  Based on one visit. After leaving a well-known high-quality fresh seafood chain because nobody seemed interested in serving me. A quick shared bike ride, and I was in business. Maybe it's the South, but I have dined in Atlanta plenty of times and have not experienced this level of service since the Inn at Little Washington - while that is a whole 'nother plane of service, this rises toward that level. Not sure about the wine? Here's a taste. Sopping up that yoghurt sauce with a scoop of grainy but soft  (not sure how that is possible, but it is) corn muffin, my server pops up at my elbow asking if I would like some extra yoghurt sauce (which reminded me of an embarrassing scene at Inn at Little W concerning dessert and a cleverly-hidden busboy who emerged from behind a curtain with a gravy boat holding a third helping of caramel sauce). When I wanted to wrap my fluffy biscuit to go, I ended up with a trove of hot breads. My dinner order got delayed so they comped and packed up a chocolate dessert for to take along. I had not complained or even given anyone the evil eye, content as I was with my wine and bread basket. \\n\\nOh, and the meal was excellent - persimmon and beet salad, corvino on spaghetti squash - if it were not for the tell-tale buttery taste on the squash and roasted vegetables, I could have even pretended to be on my diet and not dismayed at all by the plate after plate of fried chicken passing by me.  In short, a rewarding trek across town resulted in a lovely evening for a solo diner.

It offers southern style food that is both filling and delicious.  The prices are rock bottom too, especially for the chicken & waffles plate, which includes 3 large pieces of chicken skewered by a knife to a waffle.  The chicken & waffles plate can easily feed 2 people, and you'll often see people sharing it for exactly that reason.  Portions for other dishes are also quite large, so many people leave with a takeout box in hand.\\n\\nAlthough almost one person at every table had the chicken & waffles plate, no one at my table dared try it (I did contemplate it, but I knew the girl would not be impressed).  I ended up ordering the fried chicken with biscuits and gravy, which was quite good.  The one piece of chicken was filling enough for me, especially since the biscuits and pork sausage gravy were a sizable portion.  As an accompanying starch, I opted for the grits, which were savory.\\n\\nFinally, we had read about the desserts being a must-try item, so we decided to share the ban-offee pie at the end despite the 4 of us being incredibly stuffed.  The pie was a great choice.  It had bananas, caramel, and whipped cream, but the crust was my favorite part, being made out of pecan shortbread.\\n\\nThe food here is delicious, and the atmosphere is interesting, so it's worth checking out just to see what all the hype is about.\\n\\nLastly, they seem to have a pretty good lineup of hoppy beers on tap, although I didn't get around to trying any of them.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We came to Fox Bros Bar-Bar-B-Q on a Sunday evening, and much to our surprise, this place was PACKED, with standing room only and a 30 minute wait.  We decided to wait and took our seat outdoors on their patio.\\n\\nWe decided to split their BC plate ($23), which is a combo plate with 3 meats you can choose from.  They were running low on meats, and so we chose from their ribs, smoked wings, and pulled pork.  The BC plate came with 2 sides, and so for sides we got their tater tots, and their brunswick stew and chili Mac.  So what did I think?\\n\\nStarting with the sides, the tots were good!  Crispy, salted, flavorful!  The chili mac is a two for one dish, where you get to try their mac and cheese (very rich and creamy...I liked!) and their brunswick stew.  I'm kinda a brunswick stew snob, so when I say their stew wasn't bad, it was really quite decent.  I'd order the sides again.\\n\\nThe meats were the stars of Fox bros though, or they're supposed to be. Known for their ribs, which were glistening and were tender, the flavor of the ribs was pretty lacking, and I almost had to put sauce on it to make them flavorful.  The pulled pork was very similar...very nice cook, but lacking in any real flavor.  I prefer my bbq to rest on its own flavors without sauce saving it, and at least for this night, I had to use sauce.  The smoked wings actually got it right, as they were aggressively seasoned, and I needed no sauce, that we had on the side for the wings.  I'd order these again!\\n\\nOrdinarily, i'd have given 4 stars here, but there were a few other issues I had.  First off, we were set to get their \\"everything\\" plate, which included 4 meats.  We didn't because the brisket was sold out, and so was the jalapeno cheddar sausage (which we were recommended while we waited).  We also were going to try the dr pepper chocolate cake, but they were out of that too!  \\n\\nOn the plus side, on a chilly evening, the outdoor areas had these overhead lamps (note the red tint on all my photos), which kept us warm...and did a great job.  Don't be afraid to sit outside in the cooler months.\\n\\nI was excited about Fox bros, and can you blame me?  Look at all the excellent reviews!  Sadly, with long wait times and limited selection,we walked away giving them 3.5 stars, but not rounding up to 4 stars.  \\n\\n3 stars makes Fox Bros Bar B Q A-okay to me, and this evening they were just that.  The good is they have time to change my mind, because i'm sure i'll be back.

I was mostly amazed by the friendly staff and by how fast my food came out! \\n\\nThere was a worker out in the front greeting people as they walked in. He was super welcoming and kind enough to explain in detail/show me pictures (using his phone which connects to the display screen) of the different menu options. I was able to place an order in less than a minute and get my food within the next minute. Yes, it was that quick! \\n\\nI was indecisive but I ended up getting the Chickpea Fritter sandwich per recommendation based on popularity and liked it. It's basically a Clover's unique version of a falafel. I can't really speak for the other menu options, but if you're not sure what to get, I'd suggest getting the Chickpea Fritter sandwich.

What if one of us had a cold ? . \\n\\nI really wanted to like BISq and thought the tasting menu would be a good way to try out the place and get a taste/feel of the food . They need to work on improving the service and timeliness of getting the food out to their guest and give everyone their own small plate if you are offering a tasting because it wasn't cheap for what we got ( $120 for a 6-course prix-fixe chef's choice dinner for four ($180 value) , In addition our waitress was not very engaging and acted like she preferred to be elsewhere so that didn't help with our dining experience either .\\n\\nBISq has potential because the shrimp toast and rice pudding was delicious but the other courses were just ok based on what little we had to taste .

We split the pork tacos, the burger, and the fries.  It was more than enough food for two people in fact that was dinner for the evening.\\n\\nDecent portions, I would probably order a salad instead of fries next time so as not to have a major guilt complex but the fries were definitely worth it.\\n\\nWe tried a house pinot gris, from Italy, which was their wine special that day.

Their breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and you were able to eat your fill of pork products plus made to order omlettes and waffles and tons more.  Room was comfortable and clean, but not all of them come with refrigerators. Kind of a downer when you have leftovers that you still want to eat but nowhere to keep them.

Would I wait in line for this ramen? Absolutely. Do I go there multiple times a week and the staff is likely starting to tire of my big dumb face? Yes and probably not because they're all super nice.  Anyhow, more about the food.....\\n\\nI've tried the three major bowls here: old school for lunch with yuzu bomb, #2 at night (sorry can't remember the name) and the mi-so-not at night.  Those three bowls can be quite different experiences.  I can go on and on about the quality and complexity of the broth so I'll just keep it short and say there's that striking sense of so much going on that you'll be surprised so much can be done with something you might only be used to buying in $0.10 blocks in the supermarket.  But seriously, garlic, salt, umami, pork, egg, onion, and on and on. The flavors ebb and flow as you eat and it's absolutely amazing. You'll want to eat slower.  You'll want more.  You'll probably get the sniffles from the intensity of the flavors at times and you'll make a bunch of noise eating but it's absolutely worth it. \\n\\nThe noodles are always perfectly cooked regardless of type.  The portion size is perfect and you won't walk away hungry at all.  The price is great for the overall experience and decent compared to other meals while the sides are always fun and quite tasty. I recommend everything I've listed above as a \\"must try\\" honestly. \\n\\nThey're going to be opening a location on S Lamar and I honestly drive past it daily hoping it'll magically be open.

This seems to be a restaurant that thrives on large groups.  A 300 person party upstairs had parking clogged, with lines around the block.  Hapless valets struggled with the crowd and finally put the \\"Parking lot is full\\" sign out, forcing patrons to search for parking on the tight streets of Castleberry Hill.  Downstairs, an after work group of 20+ crowded out individual tables, which should be a restaurant's bread and butter, but No Mas seems to live or die on their large groups.  It's a shame if they cater to conventioneers who will never return while pissing off the locals.\\n\\nService was okay but spotty.  Our waiter had to be flagged down anytime we wanted something and rarely stopped by the table to check on us.  Food didn't maintain the high standard we experienced on our previous visit.  My combination platter came with the wrong sauce on my enchilada and overall the food was dry.  The mixed vegetables I raved about on my previous visit were not the same thing I received this time, which was an unrecognizable conglomeration of stringy mush.  The waiter charged us extra for subbing a side, when the menu clearly shows only two side items come with an upcharge.  Service, more often than not, has been a recurring challenge at No Mas.\\n\\nAt $8 a pop, house margaritas can send the bill skyrocketing.  Two margaritas plus two of the least expensive entrees totaled $48.\\n\\nOh, No Mas, you toyed with me, showing signs of greatness, only to fall back into mediocrity.

My boyfriend and I came for dinner at 6PM, and the restaurant had a pretty chill vibe with Korean music playing, strobe lights, and comfortable seating. We sat down, and ordered the ddok bokghi with cheese and the spicy kalbi tang. The spicy kalbi tang was pretty good, lots of flavor, really good noodles and just enough spice. However, the short ribs weren't very tender, and difficult to eat. The ddok bokghi was also tasty, the rice cakes and fish cakes were really good and tender, lots of cheese, and I liked the balance of sweet and spicy in the sauce. \\n\\nWhile the food was cooked well and tasted good, the service needs improvement. We ordered both dishes at the same time, and while the kalbi tang came 20min after we ordered, the ddok bokghi didn't come out for nearly an hour. We finished the kalbi tang pretty quickly, and we were sitting there with empty plates for that whole time. It almost felt like we were forgotten about; no one came to check on us, refill our water, or see if we were waiting for more food. It was also really frustrating because other couples that were seated much, much later than us were served their multiple orders of food right away, while we were still waiting for one dish. To be fair, the restaurant is still new and management is probably still working things out, and they only had 3-4 servers working on our side of the restaurant. I'll give the restaurant another few months to improve and hire more servers before coming back.

Within a half-hour the wait for newly arriving patrons seemed to be near 30 minutes.\\n\\nI ordered a Margarita and the pickle plate for starters.  The drink seemed weak, with little to no taste of tequila. Grade: D.  The pickle plate had a nice selection of vegetables, including fennel, button mushrooms, cauliflower\\nbeets and cukes.

Grade: B\\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the Foster Burger with blue cheese and caramelized onions.  This is where I really felt that F.B. fell down.  The meat (fresh ground in-house) was medium rare, as I ordered it, but seemed over ground and compacted.  It had a mealy texture and a slight liver overtone to the taste. The onions also seemed to be over cooked, to the point of being pasty, almost slimy.  The bun, baked at the bakery next door tasted great, but too soft and not up to the task of supporting the various sauces and meat juices without falling apart. Grade: C-\\n\\nThe fries were good.

Jack's etouffee was a huge cauldron of brown gravy with crawfish tails, chicken, and shrimp.  They pour a few ladlefuls into your bowl of rice and leave the rest for you to finish.  I found the sauce a bit sweet with a mild spicy kick.  Probably not as good as Pappadeux's version in Houston.

I ain't never been to no live-action hibachi in years but it's been on my bucket list. First of all, the menu and tiki drink selection was good and the prices were very reasonable especially considering the personal service and entertainment quality of the dining show. Ta-Ki was our chef and he was superb -many utensil tricks, antics and spontaneous prefabricated jokes.  Mo and I got lobster tails and steak which included rice and hibachi grilled veggies and bean sprouts and three au gratis grilled shrimps. Also included were onion soup and a small salad with ginger dressing. The meat flavors were great as Ta-Ki flavored things with lemon juice and sake (pronounced \\"saw-kay\\" BTW) as it cooked. The serving portions were very generous and everyone at the table had a good time as Ta-Ki inoculated our mouths with sake jets from the bottle. We also got a scorpion bowl that was wicked strong and tasty and aflame all the while thanks to 151 rum. My only beef was that the lobster was a little overdone, and thus kinda tough, but otherwise I highly recommend TJSH to all. Sayonara, fellow YELPers.

Eh it wasn't all that impressive. Ordered the Tonkotsu Sho-Yu and while it tasted ok the ingredients were a bit lacking. It had one lonely solitary piece of pork and half an egg. For $10 a bowl you can't throw in the other half? The ramen did have a lot of bamboo in it but I'm not a Panda so I didn't need that much. My wife had the Mi-So-Hot ramen and it was levels above the Sho-Yu. Spicy broth, lots of pork and other ingredients. They even piled on tons of saffron on top which is crazy because they won't give you the other half of the egg but will give you an ingredient that runs about $1,500 a pound. The taste of the broth here is good although I find it to be rather oily. Also the seating is very cramped and not comfortable when you're rubbing elbows with some random person while eating.

It gets 4 stars on Yelp and always seems to be in the top 5 of Columbus' best restaurants. We had a cousin with us and drove by and saw it looked manageable at noon so in we went. She got a plain hot dog with mustard and ketchup, I got the Cowboy Carmen (a chili dog with cheese and Fritos on top) and the man got the Doginator (bacon-wrapped dog topped with beef brisket, BBQ sauce,cheddar & onion rings). We got various sides to try like the fries, onion rings and mac and cheese.\\n\\nMy cousin said hers was dry. None of us got ours charred or ripped which we saw after the fact and if we go back will definitely make sure we do that to give it some texture and maybe some juice and/or snap. The hubby wasn't impressed by his. Mine was decent, certainly not on par chili wise. It was a little weak with no real kick that chili should have. The cheese wasn't melted and looked like it was poured out of a bag. When I'd try to take a bite it was almost like the hot dog was separate from the toppings and really sloppy but hard to eat at the same time. The dog itself was nicely spiced and I think it would be good if charred. The fries were good, like fair fries but cut slightly thinner. The onion rings were good but like most restaurants in the city, could be great if properly seasoned. The mac and cheese looked a little disappointing but turned out to be really good. Give it a mix and all of the cheesy goodness that has gone to the bottom will mix back in. The peppers on top flavor it ever so slightly and leave a nice, subtle heat to the palate. On the up side, the service was super friendly.\\n\\nOverall, do I think it's worth all of the hype? Not necessarily but we're going to give it one more chance before we call it overhyped but that's in the distant future. We have tons of other places to try before we go back."},{"name":"Stefano's Grill","address":"7512 Dr Philips Blvd, Ste 80","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Back again tonight, amazing service and the steak was the best.

It was a 5 or 10 minute wait only because we went on a weekday at around 11:30; however, it was still packed with people waiting. We started off with a creole bloody mary, and it was delicious, unique, and definitely something I'd recommend to try. Also to start, we had the praline bacon, which was absolutely delicious. It was very rich though, so I suggest sharing it with one or two other people unless you can handle a lot of fat and sugar in one go (maybe that's just me?). I ordered the chicken and waffles with two pieces, and it was the best fried chicken I've ever had. In addition, the sweet potato waffle was amazing - light, perfectly sweet, and adequately sized. I'm in Los Angeles a lot, and I don't hate to say the following at all: the chicken and waffles here blows that at Roscoe's away. That being said, I still love Roscoe's. My girlfriend ordered the banana foster pancakes, and she enjoyed them. They were very sweet though, so if you eat a relatively clean diet with little salt and added sugar, this may be an overload for your palette. Would love to come back whenever I'm in portland again.

At the South location, I recently noticed that the volume of broth had increased, but it was watered down much like Michi's dipping broth. The broth no longer stuck to the noodles, that overwhelming richness was gone, and the pork chunks that I was used to getting in the broth were replaced by chopped onions. When I went to the North location last night, I ordered the dipping noodles hoping that they hadn't changed the recipe. Fortunately, it's the same amazing broth they've been consistently putting out since I first started coming. management said they'd talk to the newer South location to find out what's going on, so hopefully they'll improve soon as well. \\n\\nBesides the Tsukemen, their other bowls are great, and they have a solid selection of appetizers, sake, and other Japanese beverages. Lunch menu is very limited and there's usually a line out the door, but people tend to eat then leave so you don't end up waiting too long.

Do you want one check or split?\\" \\nMe: \\"just one check\\"\\nTim: eye rollage and storms away\\n\\nCheck comes and, OMG, did Tim just thanked us for coming??? We take our money out,  two seconds later, Tim comes back and rudely says \\"It's really not that complicating I can split the bill,\\" - seriously,  Tim, we can split a $25.92 bill amongst 5 people.  \\n\\nLong story, not so short, Tim, you're a douchebag and that's why you should be so happy we didn't request for the 8 cents back.

However, my hour + wait on a Tuesday evening was unexpected.  Not their fault, good for them, just beware.  Unfortunately, contrary to what a former reviewer said about this joint not being great for \\"campers\\" there seemed to be many.  I just took it upon myself to glare discouragingly at the tables who were lounging around in the tiny, tiny restaurant while a hord of people waited outside.\\n\\nWhile we waited, we got a drink at the bar.  My friend got a slushie with vodka, and I wouldn't recommended it.  Reminded us strongly of cough syrup, and I'm not sure if it was the alcohol itself or the fact that they kept it warm, but the alcohol made her slushie melt almost instantly into a thick, cough-syrupy kool-aid mix.  Not so great.  Another guest had a slushie concoction sans alcohol (of which there are quite a few) and that was interesting non-melty.\\n\\nThe hotdog menu is extensive and creative, and I liked that they offer veggie dogs and brats.  I was really excited to try this place, but it ended up just being mediocre. I had the Beano, and the veggie dog itself was kind of bland (that's not just because it was veggie, I've had many very good veg hotdogs, this one jus wasn't good) and the mix of toppings was a slightly offputting combo of flavors.  The table had mixed reviews, but they all hovered around mediocre.  The mac and cheese was terrible, it tasted like burnt toast, which was weird.  Hopefully it was a bad batch because the jalapeno take on mac and cheese has potential.  The french fried were freshly cut, and again, maybe have the potential to be great, but mine seemed a little old (strange since they were so busy) and mushy.\\n\\nPrices were fine, though.  $3/dog $2/side $2/drink and a few decent drink specials.\\n\\nI guess I'd try the place again in a few months and hope that they reach full potential.

The hostess called the group sitting next to us and while pointing at us they told her \\"I think they were first.\\" She asks our name, looks at the list and says \\"Oh, you're up here.\\" She had previously scratched our name off and then sat other people. Maybe we didn't hear her call our name? Nope. Not possible. The waiting room is too small for that. She just forgot us.\\n\\nOnce we got to our table and placed our order we watched other tables place their orders and receive their food while we sat there hungry and drink-less. Then our waitress came and told us that the bar was behind and our sodas would be up soon. I call BULLSHIT! She forgot to put our order in. How else could it be that people seated after and ordered after us were receiving their food and drink before ours?\\n\\nForgotten twice in one meal. That two strikes Foster Burger.

When the food finally came we were amazed with how good the Ramen actually tasted. (Mind you we paid about $10 for a bowl of 'Ramen' so our expectations were pretty high). We all ordered the #2 ($8.75) with a 'spicy bomb' ($1) which basically was just a small ramekin of spicy red chilli sauce on the side. My husband also ordered a Munchie Katsu Slider ($4) which wasn't all that great. Yes, the katsu sauce made it taste good but you just get a small bite size for four dollars and without that sauce the katsu would have tasted bland. After finishing our bowl of Ramen, we were all still hungry but was discouraged with the long line to order additional noodles with our left over broth so we just left. \\n\\nSecond visit I made was extremely frustrating. After driving 40-45 mins (from Round Rock/Georgetown) to the restaurant anticipating on getting there by 5pm when they open, I was hoping to order some food to go. \\n\\n1. I couldn't find the number online to order to go, and even if I did it wasn't like they were open before 5 anyways. \\n2. Already a long line when I got there. Waited for about 10-15 mins for my turn to order. \\n3. I get to the front and the girl tells me they don't do to-go orders. (no where on their website did it state that and I was upset after the drive and my husband was at home ill wanting some soup/ramen). \\n4. Girl just said sorry and suggested I bring in a container next time. \\n\\nSo when I left I was determined to bring this soup home to my husband after fighting traffic and waiting in a long line only to be turned down. I went to Target next door and bought some tupperware containers, came back (luckily the line wasn't as long this time) and then this time they seemed hesitant to even place my order. The manager Shion stepped in and first offered to bring the dish out to me as if I were dining there and suggested I packed the food myself. Seriously, what kind of service is that!!? I said no, I would prefer for them to pack it for me, especially after all the trouble I had gone through! I wanted them to put the noodles on the side so that it wouldn't get soggy by the time I got home and they seemed to have a problem with that too. After much bickering back and forth with Shion, he said \\"okay, I'll do it for you this time.\\" \\n\\nI told him no where on their website did they state anything about not doing to-go's so it wasn't like I walked in with the mind set of expecting anything other than some ramen to go or causing any kind of inconvenience to them. \\n\\nI mentioned to Shion that I tried calling and calling after getting their number off the business card that the cashier gave me (since I couldn't find it online) and his excuse was that their phone was broken and then I asked why it wasn't stated anywhere on their website that they do not accomodate to go orders and he said they were still working on their website. I thought to myself I'm sorry but aren't these things you need to fix and complete BEFORE opening up the doors to the public?!?? When asked if he could do anything to make up for the inconvenience he caused me, his response was \\"I said sorry already and I told you we are still working on some things. After all, we've only been open for 4 weeks...\\" Ha, what a joke! I couldn't believe it. But after all, it didn't surprise me at that point. This was a business ran by a man who doesn't understand the concept of making customers happy to earn their business can go a long way. \\n\\nIt really amazes me how people are able to be so successful opening up a business half a$$. And by that I mean, open the doors to the public knowing that not everything in their restaurant is completed to handle a business properly. \\n\\nTheir ramen is good, but honestly after this experience I don't think I will go back as often as I would have in the past. \\n\\nWhat kind of hours are 5-10pm Tues-Sat? \\nThe restaurant is the size of my kitchen.\\nCan't enjoy the food in the comfort of my own home. \\nSeating and space does not seem baby or big group friendly. \\n\\nIt's only a matter of time until someone opens up another restaurant with a similar concept.

But apparently their goal is to replicate McD's quarter-pounder with better ingredients, at four times the price. $7.50 for a hamburger that isn't even Niman Ranch or some other fancy organic beef is absurd, especially when it's another $3.00 for bacon, still more for a small amount of cheddar, and even fifty cents for an all but undetectable amount of caramelized onions. The burger was pretty good--I ordered it medium rare, and I think it was a little beyond that, though it's so dim it was hard to be sure. (I ordered it without the imitation \\"secret sauce,\\" and it came with it the first time--apparently they're like McD's in not caring for special orders). But there are better burgers in town (Castagna Cafe and Yakuza, to name the first two that come to mind). They make a big deal about the buns from the bakery next door--they're squishy, flavorless, textureless globs that are no different from what you can buy at Freddy's for $1.59 an eight-pack.\\n\\nMy wife got the Shroom burger and said it was good.\\n\\nThe fries were excellent (no added flavorings on mine)--hot, crisp, and ungreasy. The cole slaw was very good as well, though it had too much dressing (there was about a half-inch of liquid left in the dish when I finished it).\\n\\nIf you're a wine drinker you'll be frustrated--they have one red and one white, both cheap and mediocre.\\n\\nThe service was good--our waitress was pleasant and attentive, and handled the mistake about sauce on my burger very efficiently.\\n\\nThis trend of ordinary food under the name of local celebrity chefs at upscale prices needs to stop.

Worth every penny!!!\\n\\nI started the dine out menu with the vanilla goat cheese, beet and greens salad. When the waitress gave me my salad, she described it as salad with \\"snowy goat cheese\\" on top. I thought she referred to the crumbled texture of the cheese that was sprinkled on top but no! After having a bite, I realized that the cheese wasn't creamy, nor did it melt in my mouth. It had that weird texture where it really felt like snow in my mouth (minus the ice cold feeling). It was really bizarre, but I loved it. I went home and googled beet goat cheese recipes. After that salad, I had the wild mushroom risotto. I expected the regular risotto with mushroom mixed in, but this one has pieces of cheese on top and had been baked such that the cheese was melted on top of the risotto. I enjoyed it immensely since it was so out of the ordinary. To finish my meal, I had the apple crumble which I am also a big fan of. It came in this little pot that would normally used for jam and was filled with pieces of apple and covered with the bread crumble to make it an apple crumble.

My favorite here is the Cuban. That sandwich always was missing something. Ahhhh bacon! With the homemade pickles and mustard and pork on top, all salty and grilled up hot it's got a lot of savory flavor and always hits the spot. \\n\\nYou can also get a side of bacon or chocolate bacon too. The menu is small and doesn't change much but they often will offer a daily special. If it's not busy they will usually let you customize your order too.

Different interior and menu, and with that comes a complete change of environment and atmosphere. The original Gallery was comfortable for me personally in that it was a dingy, and cheap spot on campus in a sea of expensive terrible food. I would say the general loss of that is a negative.\\n\\nAs for the positives; the food is really good, and actually isn't that pricy - although with no cheap food options on campus anymore... Right, positives! I'm not the kind of person who gets hung up on having no table service, as it means the tip can normally come down. However they bring the food to the table and serve alcohol, so there should be somewhat of an obligation to leave an okay tip. Service is mostly good - which is a pretty great thing among a sea of terrible service everywhere else on Campus (excluding a few of the other newer places/Loafe, Mercante, etc.) of course take that with a grain of salt, they have some inexperienced staff who give me the vibe of being a step up from fast food workers. There's a male server/bartender from Australia I believe, who's there every day and is quite good.\\n\\nThe seating is nice, but the bar area is very weird, and feels like an airport lounge. The elevated seating area is REALLY nice. Unfortunately I think the restaurant that preceded them missed the mark; either that or they put non-foodie UBC board members in charge of choosing the design of the venue. It screams of something they would make a late 50s/early 60s white male who flies first class would want. As for everyone else... The atmosphere is the weirdest part.\\n\\nThe food is solid, service is good, acceptable price for quality, comfy seats, weird vibe... The only real negative servicewise is that sometimes the food comes out slow. This is not fast food, so make sure you leave some time to get to class. I give it a 3/5, and hope to see it do well; maybe bring back the killer breakfast menu at the original Gallery."},{"name":"China Panda","address":"7131 Peachtree Industrial Blvd, Ste 101","city":"Norcross","stars":"3","text":"The food was nasty not fresh!!!

I pulled up Yelp on my phone and saw this place. I confirmed with Full Custom Gospel BBQ and decided to give this place a try. Let me first say that this place can be somewhat difficult to find at first. Especially for those that might be unfamiliar with the area. It's not that you have to make some treacherous trek to find it, in fact, it's right on the service road for I35 North. Once you see \\"Dreamers\\" and \\"Le Rogue\\", slow down, you're getting close (it'll be the little turquoise trailer behind the chain link fence with a huge line in front of it!) If you see the Fiesta, you've gone too far.\\n\\nOnce we found it, I was immediately struck by the cool hodge podge of picnic tables and old rusty patio furniture. It has a real cool backyard BBQ vibe to it. I was glad I had looked at the menu on their website before driving over because the large line of people blocked most of the menu and the crowd of people behind me would not have appreciated me standing for a few minutes to decide what I wanted!\\n\\n***IMPORTANT NOTE! We arrived shortly after 1:00 pm and they were sold out of 3 of the 5 meats they offer. I wasn't sure if this was just poor planning on their part or a huge indicator of the popularity of this place.\\n\\nThey were out of both of the meats that I wanted to try (the pulled pork and ribs) so I settled for the sliced brisket. I was offered a free sample to help seal the deal. He asked me if I enjoyed fatty parts and end pieces...of course I said I did. It was another indicator that this wasn't your typical BBQ joint. My total was around $10 for a brisket plate, two sides, two pieces of white bread, and a sweat leaf tea. After I paid I was handed a gorgeous plate that was simply overflowing with portions. Normally you order and get paper thin slices but this was not the case at Franklin! The cuts were thick and the extra \\"scraps\\" were thrown in on top.\\n\\nWhat followed next was nothing short of amazing! The melty fat, the perfectly charred bits, and the smoky meat was BBQ ambrosia! I've had alot of BBQ in my time but nothing as dead on as this! I was so entranced by the beautiful flavors of the meat that I almost forgot there was BBQ sauce sitting on the table. I grabbed one of the bottles and squirted some on my plate. It was unique and fresh but defiantly was simply a sideshow for the meat itself. The sides (slaw and beans) were great but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nI can defiantly see why this place is always packed, it's certainly now one of my top 5 places to eat in Austin! Do yourself a favor and try Franklin BBQ if you consider yourself even a dabbler in the art of 'cue...it'll make all the BBQ you've had before seem second class!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Some things are pretty good others not so. It is an attractive place with attentive waitstaff. The food is expensive for what you get. And, the portions are oddly sized.\\n\\nFirst, our waiter Michael was very attentive, informative and personal. He got a well deserved 20+% tip. \\n\\nThe drinks are salty, as in costly. My \\"The Willie\\" was a smoky Manhattan, it came under a glass cloche with burning cherry wood embers - quite a show and worth the extra cost. The wine list is extensive - eleven pages long - with many of the bottles being over $100. I am a very strong believer in drinking fine wines at home, not out at four times the cost. There are always a few of the lower price options on any list that work well; our waiter guided us to a good choice. \\n\\nThe appetizers is where things began to unravel. The lobster hush-puppies were quite good but two little, almost ping pong ball sized bites for $10 stretched my good humor. That was not buoyed by two quail thighs at $4 each. Both were tasty but quite tiny portions more suitable for a long multiple course tasting menu. \\n\\nThe main course is where things got weird. My wife's crispy skin chicken ($34) was a huge serving of three chicken thighs which oddly were three different sizes. The flavor was great, but I thought the meat itself was far over cooked. My wife disagreed with me. The fried olives were interesting, tasty and they complimented the dish. This large serving also came with a cylindrical shaped potato, a little smaller than a soup can. That is a lot of food and worth the price.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my elk loin ($44) was tiny and came with a few hen of the woods mushrooms on a white puddle of sauce, decorated with crispy collards and some candied grapes scattered about the plate. The elk loin was ordered medium rare but came out somewhere between very rare and bleu with a just-warm-but-not-actually-cooked interior. I hate sending underdone meat back because it always comes back like reheated leftovers and is usually overdone. I usually do not complain because it upsets my wife. The elk itself is a total waste of time and money. It had almost no discernible flavor, significantly less than beef tenderloin. The white sauce it sat upon was also flavorless; it's primary description would be just \\"white and wet.\\" The mushrooms were tasty but even with the elk, not remotely filling. The crispy collards were not actually food, just a few stiff-fried decorations. The candied grapes had nothing to do with the rest of the food and seemed gratuitous at best, more like just a silly affectation. This dish needs something else to complement it like a risotto or polenta.\\n\\nI find it odd and somewhat annoying to have dishes in each course category being such different sizes. I think they should all be pretty much the same size portions.\\n\\nWe split an ancho chocolate cake ($10) that was truly exceptional, a great item to share.\\n\\nIt is pretty obvious that this place caters to the downtown visiting business folk on an expense account.

I expected the sauce to come out more, but this was not the case.  The vegetables were also underwhelming - although this was likely due to sitting in a delivery car for 15-20 minutes before getting to my door. Overall, although there was nothing bad about the wrap, nothing about it stood out to me either.  \\n\\n- Side of Falafel (4.5/10)\\nAs with the wrap, there was little inspiring about the falafels.  While the flavor was fine, the falafels were nowhere near crisp enough for me to enjoy - again, perhaps a function of getting it delivered.  The vegetables that came with also suffered from the same problems that the wrap had.\\n\\nAdditional notes:\\n- Price is very reasonable, especially for the amount of food they give you.  Always a good thing!\\n- The hot sauce I got on the side was rather good and probably the best part of my meal\\n\\nFinal Comments:\\nWhile I would consider eating here in-person to see if the delivery really did affect the quality of the food, I will likely not be ordering delivery from here again.

It had clearly been warmed in the oven and prepared way ahead of time. The buffalo wings were dry and crusty, the ranch had a thick layer of oil and fat over it.

Instead I'd like to wax philosophical about something.\\n\\nDim sum comes in two variants: the kind where you order small dishes off of a menu and the kind where you point to those dishes being wheeled around on little metal carts.  The former generally yields fresher food, since for the most part everything is made to order.  So why does Hei La Moon use the ol' push cart system?  Well for one thing, the restaurant is huge.  I remember one Saturday when I was waiting for a friend to arrive before going in.  I started getting worried about seating because huge (10+ people) groups kept showing up and yet somehow the restaurant absorbed them immediately.  I too was eventually absorbed by the vortex of pork buns and dumplings.  An army of push carts keeps the food rolling fast 'n' furious(ly).  I think some of the nit-picky complaints about the place are forgetting just how massive of an operation this is.\\n\\nLogistics aside, the push cart system is far less intimidating for dim sum newbies.  It's easy enough to see something rolling by and to just point to it like some kind of gluttonous child.  Speaking of gluttony, the carts also provide instant gratification.  There's nothing worse than ordering chicken feet and then having to wait 10 minutes for chicken feet (or, you know, something you actually want to eat)."},{"name":"DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana","address":"8000 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The food here is fantastic and they have a variety of Italian craft beer and wine to enjoy with your meal.

The exterior & interior is a time capsule from the fin de dix-neuvi√®me si√®cle and early twentieth century. The d√©cor is frozen in time like a living, functioning museum piece. There is a feeling of the presence of all those who have dined & wined before us, of those who are long dead & buried. \\n\\nJake's is a venerable restaurant, and the menu tries to hark back in time some of what might have been food from long ago which is admirable in order to reflect its surroundings. \\n\\nHowever, I feel that  the fine points of cuisine are missing as well as lacking a more instinctive, aware approach to the execution of cooking techniques. As I was eating, I got to sense more & more that I was eating corporatized food albeit at a higher quality level.  \\n\\n0) Bread here is ok tasting sour dough. The inside is moist & heavy, and it has the chewiest, toughest, leathery crust. If you have dentures, don't chew down and pull on the bread since your dentures will pull loose & fly out of your mouth.  \\n \\n1) Cajun Popcorn Crawfish Tails are battered & fried to a crispy softness. Dipping sauce of sherry A√Øoli (ah ee oh lee) and ketchup with horseradish were good sauces to either complement the fried oiliness or contrast against it. \\n\\n2) Fresh Alaskan halibut is braised in light fish broth stuffed with dungeness crab meat & tiny Oregon Bay shrimp. It is topped w/ a velout√© sauce enriched w/ Brie & cream cheese. It was a rather bland dish. \\n\\nPerhaps a bit of fresh French tarragon & a touch of cognac as well as employing a richer fond de cuisine would have enlivened & added another layer of complexity to amuse the palate without destroying the delicate flavours of the seafood. A small pinch of Fleur de Sel de Gu√©rande wouldn't have hurt either. \\n\\nGarlic mashed potato w/ generous amount of sweet butter and al dente string beans & julienned carrots rounded out the main dish. \\n\\n1-2a) I wanted an Oregonian wine to pair with dinner so our efficient waitress suggested Acrobat Pinot Gris which had lemon citrus tones w/ refreshing acidity to cleanse the palate. \\n\\nToo full from the rough tough sour dough and the deceptively large quantity of the main course, we had to skip dessert.

Instead of waxing poetic about the food, as done in 98% of the nearly 300 Yelper reviews to date, I figured I'd offer a compilation of utilitarian tips:\\n\\n1) Don't go on weekends. Seriously, some of the people on here must either enjoy lines in the hot sun or have masochism issues; there is no reason whatsoever to wait 90 minutes outside on a Saturday or Sunday, unless you're visiting from out of town and not on any weekdays. Early in the week is probably the best time to go; if you don't work anywhere near downtown, tell your boss you have a doctor's appointment and take a two-hour lunch, for Pete's sake! This is FRANKLIN we're talking about!\\n\\n2) The lines appear to be longest right at 11am, since everyone's still worried that they'll run out of food. Yes, they will (at least until the new brick 'cue pit opens), but you'll be just fine -- and it's highly unlikely they'll yet be out of anything -- if you get there at noon, and on average you'll have 25-30 people in front of you. (Don't worry; the line moves quickly. Again, all of this advice applies to weekday visits, not weekends.)\\n\\n3) A nice plus to the new bricks-and-mortar location, aside from the obvious (much more seating, covered porch, indoor A/C, etc.), is a fountain-soda machine. Much better still, it has Dublin Dr Pepper on tap. (It's also available by the bottle. Soda from the machine - which includes refills - is $1.50. An 8 oz. bottle is $2. There is no taste difference. You can figure out the common-sense choice.) If you're not a DP fan, they also have Mexican Coke by the bottle, also for $2 (or Coke Classic from the machine).\\n\\n4) An unfortunate minus to the new bricks-and-mortar location is across-the-board price increases on nearly every menu item, ranging from $1 to $4 more. (Unsurprisingly, their brisket -- judging by the reviews, the most popular item by far -- got the $4 price increase for a pound.) Them's the breaks when you move to a permanent location and have to pay for rent and utilities.\\n\\n5) Remember that barbecue reheats very well: I'd suggest buying a few extra pounds of your preferred meat, wrapping it in tin foil as soon as you get home or back to work (to seal in as many juices as possible), and slowly reheating it in your home oven at 200-225 degrees for 45 minutes or so. Do NOT microwave it."},{"name":"John Barleycorns","address":"14610 SW Sequoia Pkwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"We have been huge fans of the McMenamins brand for decades. Family come visit from around the country and are delighted at the experiences. During a recent road trip from Seattle to Black Butte, we organized a group of 12 to have lunch at the John Barleycorn location (first time visit). It was my son's birthday (July 19) and we were supremely let down. The service was utterly terrible and our food took an hour to arrive. Entire tables were seated, fed, and departed before our food arrived. Our server never checked in with us or shared any information about our substantial delay. When I asked the manager to explain later, she couldn't, and offered to discount our bill. She removed one beer from mine. Please fix this location, McMenamins, so we can get back to being evangelists of your brand!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Tldr: food 4.5/5, service 3/5 (u wait for 5 hrs but they come by and visit you which is awesome), atmosphere ?/5 (it's what you make of it; bring games, talk w ppl in line), cost: 3/5 (buy in bulk to make it worth), bathrooms 2/5\\n\\nProbably the best barbecue I have ever eaten. We woke up at 7:30am to go wait in line, and got our food around 1pm. Franklin's started as a food truck, but quickly evolved into the brick-and-mortar legend that it is known as today (this story is detailed via pictures you can see as you wait in line). \\nA couple things to note if you decide to go to Franklins:\\nBring water! (and shade/seating arrangements/etc. if you decide to go later than 6:30am) Beer is nice to sip on as you wait, but really water is key, especially in the summer. Be friendly with the people you are in line with! This is all a community experience here. Think of Franklin's like camping out, because you'll be doing so for at least 5 hours.\\nBring breakfast, and bring entertainment (i brought a book and a laptop).\\nThe place opens at 11 and they go until they run out of food. \\n\\nEAT SLOWLY when you've finally gotten your food. The last thing a famished stomach needs is a pound of grease within a minute.\\n\\nPros: The food is definitely the best barbecue I have ever eaten. The pull test for brisket: if you hold up a strip and it does not break under its own weight, but comes apart with minimal pulling. The food is a little salty (but i like salty so whatever, and you have bread), but melts in the mouth. Beef ribs were not on the menu panel when I went, but definitely ask if they have not run out of it already! I did, and I was so satisfied. \\n\\nCons: The wait. Because who wants to wait in the sweltering Texas heat? The price. A pound of meat costs around $20, which is a little pricey for this hungry college boy. The grease. Brisket as a cut of meat has lots of fat around it and through it, a lot of which melts during the long cooking process.\\n\\nWhen would I go: if you've never gone before, and if you're willing to wait in line (perhaps another pertinent question: Would I go again? Yes, but the wait and price will keep me at bay for a long while)\\n\\nWhat I like to get: Brisket (in my opinion, the true test of a BBQ joint), and beef ribs (and lots of bread)"},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"S&R Grill is a cute, local restaurant in SW Portland.

I was really looking forward to it on a Saturday morning after a walk through Forest Park. When we arrived the wait was 30-45 minutes. Well, it took more like an hour and ten minutes. We took a walk to the coffee shop down the street and returned later. \\n\\nUpon being seated we ordered coffee, I drink a lot of coffee, to defrost. I ordered a Ramos Gin Fizz excited to finally try ONE craft cocktail in Portland. I have been on a manhunt for something decent considering I am from Los Angeles and we push the envelope quite far on craft cocktails. Right now we are in our Jalapeno infused phase. I was disappointed when our food came out prior to the cocktail. After waiting forever to be seated and running late on returning our car rental I didn't ask twice for the cocktail. Believe it or not, I left Portland without ever having the opportunity of trying a \\"craft\\" cocktail. They don't exist in Portland. I know... I have tried ordering them at other places only to be disappointed. Should rename \\"craft\\" cocktails to \\"crap\\" cocktails. Anyways, enough on my disdain for \\"craft\\" cocktails in Portland.

Peppered-delight and crispy-crunch-wholesome-goodness in my mouth-and-belly not-missing-LA chicken one bit... Sorry, those were the words that were running through my mind. Basically, it was a run on sentence of everything wonderful. I've tried something that came close to this in Santa Monica but what we were missing was the sweet potato waffle. \\nNow I don't quite remember the sweet potato waffle days later but I also know I am not complaining about it so it compliments well and is unique enough to try. \\n\\nSome Praline Bacon and Corn Dogs later we were full. The chicken and waffle plate came out with 3 chicken pieces. When the plate came we immediately placed two pieces in a to-go box for later and shared one big piece. This plate can be shared by 2-ish, maybe 3, people. The Bacon Praline was thick, juicy, tastes-of-bacon, and had a semi-sweet coating of nuts on it. Love it!

We were given garlic bread to start (below average) and then we settled on the pasta parma and the spaghetti carbonara umbria. The umbria sauce was not as eggy as a carbonara should be and was more on the thicker creamy/cheesy side. While we both felt there was way too much cheese in the cream-based sauces, I was ok with the rest of my dish while my partner did not like his at all.

The plan was to go to Atlantic Fish Co. with Liz to enjoy our beloved, long awaited and anticipated baked stuffed lobsters for a pre-birthday celebration. But, like idiots, we didn't bother to make a reservation. Having fasted all day, we agreed we couldn't survive the 2-hour wait, and continued down the street.\\n\\nI wasn't prepared for such a miserable, yet foreseeable occurrence, so I hadn't entertained the idea of another spot. Nothing in the area appealed to me except Sonsie. \\n\\nWe walked in, and opted out of the corny, voyeuristic front window seating fit for tourists, and instead chose the dining room. It was far too dimly lit if you ask me, which was incredibly distracting. It made it tough to clearly see my friends from two feet across the table, no exaggeration. It was also a tad bit loud, despite the generally empty dining room. Maybe this is the perfect atmosphere for when you're on a date with someone super out of your league, but definitely not for when you're just looking for good conversation with two close friends.\\n\\nWe started with drinks: a hoppy Goose Island IPA for me, a tasty cucumber cocktail for Liz, and a dirty martini for Amanda. We then moved on to a dozen refreshingly yummy oysters, which were the perfect size. Only a few shelly bits here and there, but I'm not too picky about that since I'm used to my dad shucking them for us at home.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the Risotto with portobella mushrooms, spinach, truffle ricotta and a roasted tomato. It was pretty good, and was the perfect portion. I definitely won't be coming back to order this $18 entree again, however.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was pretty average. A bit over-priced, but that's Newbury for ya. Our server was nice, but was also annoyingly over-enthusiastic about everything, and he didn't notice it was my birthday when he checked my ID. Not a huge travesty, but I like it when servers go that extra mile.

Finally, my husband and I decided to try it. It is actually not far from where we are living and there are a lot of street parking spots near it. The traffic and parking were not an issue for us. We arrived around 7:30 pm on Thursday night. The place wasn't full but good amount of customers. The waitress sent us to a two person table once we stepped in, no waiting. The menu has one northeastern section which is very attractive. They have a lot of traditional dishes, both meat ones and vegie ones. We ended up ordering the sour cabbage with pork, fried pork with ginger source, tou fu strip with spicy green pepper, and pork dumplings.\\nThe sour cabbage dish was very delicious. But personally, it was a little soupy. I guess there were not enough sour cabbage. The pork had too much fat on it which wasn't my favorite. But the flavor was great!! I will order it again for sure if I go back.\\nThe fried pork with the ginger source was OK. It is one kind of traditional dish but it wasn't impressive, I think. But per my husband, it tasted like American-Chinese food...haha!! Heavy enough to attract some local customers, I guess?\\nThen go to our favorite dish of the night--Toufu Strip with spicy green pepper. IT WAS AWESOME!! If you prefer to eating light but still Chinese flavor, it is the one!! When I was kid, my dad always cooked this for me. With some rice, hmmm,  it was the best!! Sauteed Toufu strip with a little spicy flavor, that was very tasty! I will go back just for this dish!\\nThe dumplings were so so...the wrap wasn't so thick but the fillings were not very impressive. I would like to try different fillings next time if we go back.\\nLet's talk about the rice a bit here--Northeastern Chinese has very delicious rice and I am pretty sure that we can get similar ones in Boston.

I've had Palookaville food a few times in the past when the food truck showed up to random things, but when the day is over, I always love going to a place to sit down, have a beer or two and pig out on fried grub that's horrible for your heart and cholesterol, but who cares, because it's so delicious.\\n\\nAvondale Estates are a tad out of the way, but they're still not difficult to find, because they're just outside of the reach of the trendy part of downtown Decatur, and they're fairly easy to get to off of I-285.  My only gripe about their location is that their parking lot is sparse, and at least every time I've been in the area, there are always a hundred buses that all seem to need to turn onto Clarendon, and cause a lot of aggravating delays when you're easily within visual sight of your destination.\\n\\nEither way, entering Palookaville, it's a lively environment, while still being relaxed.  Much to the description of others, there's a lot of nerdy/circus-y/nostalgia stuff all over the walls and decor, and the chair seriously remind me of old elementary school chairs.  In spite of it all, it's a clean and well-maintained establishment, with little concern that it's an unsanitary dive or anything unsavory.\\n\\nStaff is friendly and personable.  Not to mention the place is ahead of the curve when it comes to technology, as orders are taken on tablets, so anything short of user input error is going to eliminate the chances mistakes on account of bad handwriting from servers.\\n\\nThe menu is full of pretty much everything that's terrible for your health, but also pretty much everything that is completely delicious.  As others have pointed out, don't bother showing up here if you're trying to be remotely health-conscious, or consider Palookaville as the perfect place to indulge on cheat-days.  Corndogs are among the marquee items, but I've never heard of anyone object to any of their burgers or other items.\\n\\nThe corndogs are massive, and a far cry from the dinky corndogs that people are capable of putting away 2-3 in a sitting.  I played it smart and stuck to a single corndog, single-dipped.  And they're not just hot dogs, but you can get stuff like Italian sausages and other fine proteins battered and fried.\\n\\nHowever, I would recommend not double-dipping.  I've heard sometimes double-dipped corndogs can contain some raw batter in them, as they're flash-fried pretty quickly, and consumption of such could lead to some unpleasant results.\\n\\nOne thing I'd like to really point out though is that Palookaville's tater tots are pretty much the best tater tots in the world.  In my humble opinion, naturally.  \\n\\nThey fry them very crispy, which I love, and they're served with this seasoning that has like cumin and curry in it that really makes them even more awesome.  Bare, with the seasoning, or with like other toppings, I could not stop eating them as long as they were on the table.  They are about as dangerous to my health as armed robbers.\\n\\nThe menu also features a fully stocked bar, as well as milkshakes that contain some allegedly strong amounts of alcohol in them.  I can't attest to them, as shakes and myself do not get along too well, but everyone I've known who has had them really seem to enjoy them.\\n\\nOverall, I had a great experience with Palookaville, and I highly recommend them to anyone who's seeking either good corndogs and/or a fairly unique dining experience.  Their location isn't difficult, their atmosphere is unique, relaxed and jovial, and their menu is truly unique, in this metropolitan area saturated with tacos and barbecue restaurants."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"We had: True Love Always,(nah, not my bag, thanks, I mean the name of the dog) Zippity Zam (hehehe, reminds me of my ex), sauerkraut dog, Puff the Magic Popper, original onions and an order of onion rings, which disappeared rather quickly.

I didn't tell the waitress because hey, it's my first time trying it and I'll try anything on the menu. The Columbus Crew had olives, yellow banana peppers, and sriracha cream cheese sauce. Good, but I don't like peppers or olives. LOL. The Chicago was phenomenal though. It had a pickle and tomato. It was overly seasoned with black pepper, but it was still pretty good.\\n\\nMy friend got Puff the Magic Popper, which had cheddar cream cheese, jalape√±o, and bacon bits with a side of fries. Side note, sides here are so cheap!! She loved what she had! I thought the fries were just okay. You can do well here eating two dogs and no side. It's filling. My other friend got Lara's Pittsburgh Princess, which had vinegar-based slaw and fries. She thought it was good, but loved the Cowgirl Carmen a lot better, which had meat coney sauce, shredded cheddar, and crushed Fritos.\\n\\nThe space is definitely small.

Had to come here first thing LOL \\n\\nAnd THANK GOD I did. We arrived in Portland around 10AM on a Friday. This place opens at 8AM... so the wait was already two hours by the time we got there. I shudder to think how long we would have waited if we had arrived past 10. Mind you, we hadn't eaten anything other than trader joe's granola bars since we got up at 4AM to get to Portland from SF (poor planning on our part) so by the time we were finally seated around noon, we were ready to eat EVERYTHING.\\n\\n** Oh, one note on the waiting outside. They take your name on a piece of paper and shout it - make sure you're paying attention because they don't shout very loudly **\\n\\nAnyway, onto the food! We ordered the chicken and waffle, pecan bacon and shrimp and grits. The friend who recommended this place said the shrimp and grits were amazing - I was really leaning toward chicken and waffle but I decided to trust in that friend. And luckily my traveling friend got the chicken and waffles anyway! I opted to forego the biscuit and get the praline bacon instead. \\n\\nFood:\\nShrimp and Grits ($15):\\nTender shrimp cooked with cheddar cheese grits plus two over easy eggs. Oh man the cheese and shrimp flavor was so GOOD. I would order this again in a heartbeat, I really enjoyed it and it hit the spot after being out in the cold! \\n\\nChicken and Waffle ($12): Meh. I felt like the chicken was good, but not amazing, same with the waffle. If you like pepper, you'll like this chicken though. It's definitely got a good amount of peppercorn seasoning on it and it's fried decently. I don't think it's anything you can't get elsewhere though.\\n\\nPraline Bacon ($7.5): Straight up soft, thick pieces of pork belly smothered in praline - super sweet but just enough crunch from the nuts to contrast with the soft bacon. Probably my favorite part of the meal, I would recommend you get this for SURE. \\n\\nPrice-wise, it's decent, a little expensive but portions are generous, I think the shrimp and grits could have used a little more grit and shrimp for $15 but I was left pretty full at the end anyway. It's definitely heavy comfort food.\\n\\nAside from the shouting while waiting the service was good - our server was attentive and polite and we got our food quickly after being seated and ordering.\\n\\nOverall, definitely a standout during our Portland trip. It was really simple, home style food that hit the spot! I don't think I'd wait two hours for it again but maybe going right when it opens or going for dinner is in the cards for the next Portland trip. I thought it was worth the wait that ONE time to try, but I wouldn't wait again - it's great, but not two hours great.

My buddy lives in Houston, and I head down every year for the big bbq cook-off, this year he decided to add a day where we drive to all of his favorite bbq spot.  The plan was 8 places in one day (we ended up only getting to 6).

The guy who was the last guaranteed eater was about 15 in front of us.\\nWow, sold out more than an hour before they even opened, and people still stood in line.  It did take us all of the 3 hours to get to through the doors. But as a bbq lover I had to find out what the hype was all about, and currently living in Chicago I figured whens the next time I'd be in Austin to try this place? \\nOn our day long bbq-fest, hands down this was my favorite of the 6 places we visited.

But a SunTrust employee helped us get around to the front but they she had to check us out of the ballpark first.  Best idea...enter through the Battery entrance and not the ballpark one.\\n\\nMy entree was the 2 meat.  I chose chopped brisket, pulled pork, mac and cheese, and potato salad.  The brisket was tender and juicy with a delicious black pepper rub.  The brisket was the better of the 2 meats as the pork was on the dry side.  The pork was ok.  The potato salad was cut into chunks, made with red potatoes, covered in mustard, not creamy, and had celery and red onion mixed in.  It was ok.  But the star of the meal was the mac and cheese.  The mac used shells and had an excellent creamy cheesiness to it.  It was one of the best mac and cheeses I've had from a BBQ joint.\\n\\nThere are 3 sauces: regular, spicy, and white.  The regular and spicy is vinegar base.  I want to say there is either lemon or orange juice added to it to give it a sour/tart taste.  The spicy has something extra to it for spiciness.

There are waitresses who are wheeling the carts around for you to pick your dimsum. I have gone there probably five times. Sometimes, I get disappointed because they don't have egg tarts, when sometimes they do. Do not go too late, (i.e. 2 pm) because the dimsum starts to dwindle and you might not be able to get all the good stuff.\\n\\nSo the stuff I always order include the siew mai, har gow (shrimp dumpling), char siew sou (bbq pork rolls), porridge with century egg, egg tarts (if they even have it), glutinous rice wrapped in leaf, black bean pork. \\n\\nThe more adventurous can try the chicken feet.\\n\\nI don't really fancy their soy beancurd, nor their mango puddings.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"There were two restaurants on my list to hit during this past weekend's quick trip to Atlanta, and Fox Bros. was one. Atlanta is one of those cities where everyone has an opinion on where to find the best BBQ; i guess the fact that folks are so passionate about it is a result of there being so many good places to choose from. I know that here at home in Fort Lauderdale most folks are indifferent about their smoked meats. I think about half of the folks i spoke with prior to Saturday's lunch agreed with my decision to hit Fox Bros., and the rest poo pooed my choice to hit this newer joint rather than one of the city's old stand by establishments. But whatever, I had to have those tasty wings and tender shredded pork, so I stood by my original decision \\nand headed on over.\\n\\nWalking in we saw that the appetizer special was fried ribs, something that I have never even considered existing, let along seen on a menu. I knew that they must be mine. It was hot as hell out but we opted to sit on the patio rather than wait for an inside table. A cold brew and glass of ice water later, examined the menu and opted for the fried ribs and an order of Fox Bros awesome chicken wings to start, and a round of pulled pork sandwiches (mine with slaw on top) for our meals. Since the sandwiched each come with one side we spread the love: I ordered beans, she ordered tots and our massively-bearded companion at the table pushed through ordinary BBQ barriers and ordered the Fox-a-Roni, a surprisingly awesome mix of mac 'n' cheese and Brunswick stew.\\n\\nThe apps were delivered and our jaws dropped. The ribs came out and looked like three big, crispy pieces of fried chicken. Once you got a hold of them you discovered that each piece contained two rib bones, and they were smoked till tender and then deep fried. They were still warm and both the crispy fired coating and the tender meat fell apart at the touch. They came served with a white BBQ sauce which seemed to be a spicy ranch type dressing,  I alternated between dipping into that and the restaurant's regular award-winning sauce, and I was definitely happy we decided to try the special. I'm always a fan of Fox Bros.' wings, but the awesomeness of the fried ribs overshadowed them on this trip.\\n\\nThe pork sandwiches came out and were as big as a baby's head. My beans were good but not great, but boy was that Fox-A-Roni tasty, and messy too! The pork was tender, and they even were happy to provide one sandwich filled with extra \\"bark\\", which the lady at the table greatly appreciated. We are till full and then to stuffed before packing the remains of the sandwiches in a box, as they were destined to be a drunken midnight snack in just a few short hours.\\n\\nNext time I'm in ATL i plan on visiting another of the city's fine BBQ establishments, but I'm happy I opted for Fox Bros on this visit."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"5 Cambridge Ctr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This place was affordable and fast - so fitting for every college student.

Some will go as far to say one of the best in the nation.  But just because something is expensive, doesn't mean that it's better restaurant.  The reputation overshadows the actual quality of the food - salty, heavy, overwhelming.  The desire to feature fresh seafood is forgotten in a bath of cream and butter.  The crab tortellini was so salty that it became bitter.  The rockfish had hints of donut batter (a slight vanilla flavor).  Maybe I should have opted for something beyond the mid-range entrees but I'm afraid that it would just be wasting money.  The silver lining of the meal was our waitress - friendly, knowledgeable, and honest.  When asked about the √©touff√©e, she said that it was good but the ingredients were frozen (crawfish is currently out of season).  It's one of rare times I actually told the waitress what I thought about the dish and she offered to have the kitchen prepare the entree again - even as a take-out.  It's also one of the rare instances where I left a 20% tip.\\n\\nBottomline:  Needless to say, I wasn't terribly impressed.  I know that I've experience better seafood restaurants elsewhere.  I'm certain that you can find equally amazing seafood restaurants in Portland at a fraction of the price.  I'll agree that Jake's is probably an ideal venue for puffery and celebratory meals.  As a foodie tourist, on the other hand, Jake's would rank among the last places I'd recommend because the price-value-experience ratio isn't on par.

I followed the progress closely, and was beyond excited to dine here when they first opened. Since my first visit I have been back twice. I like to see the evolution of new places over a period of time before I make up my mind about a place. The \\"Cow House\\" has tweaked their menu a bit from the beginning, but I love that they still offer taco PLATTERS. Yes this is a bit different than paying $6 for three little street tacos. These three tacos (they have traditional chicken, steak, pork options with fun and unique squash, polenta, or bacon) accompanied with black beans, house-made kale salad (I like that they jumped on the Kale Train even though it isn't a traditional Mexican food option), and rice are a great deal to me. Reading the other reviews of people being disappointed with having to pay for the chips and salsa, I feel compelled to write that hardly anyone makes their own chips anymore and if they do they are cutting corn tortillas and frying them. Most of the Mexican food restaurants nowadays, we have to pay for chips and salsa. Long gone are the days of filling up on free chips and salsa, that ultimately are a loss of money for a restaurant. We pay for the chips and salsa because the restaurant pays for the chips and salsa, and here at Casa Vaca they are making their own salsa (I prefer the roasted salsa here). The staff has always been friendly and helpful (especially with where the bathroom is located). I had the pleasure of chatting with the owner/manager Pete the last time I was in, and he was a delight. I look forward to my next visit to support this small family owned restaurant because I respect how hard they have worked to launch this restaurant, and how hard they are working to please their customers while continuing to produce great products in a cool and comfortable environment."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here this morning for dim sum.

I was in town for the 7th Annual Austin Beard and Mustache Competition. I don't know how, but the president of the Austin Facial Hair Club managed to reserve Franklin Barbecue for dinner. Like I said, I was very fortunate to eat there because lots of locals still haven't gotten the chance to eat there since Franklin always sells out of food between 1:30-2pm. Let me tell you, it is worth all the hype!\\n\\nI had the two meat plate. I chose to have the brisket, and the ribs. For sides, you have your choice of baked beans, cole slaw, or tater salad. I chose the slaw and beans as my sides. \\n\\nWhen you ask for brisket, make sure you ask for the burnt ends! This is a must! For people that don't know what burnt ends are, allow me to explain. There are two parts to a cut of brisket, the point, and the flat. When a brisket is fully cooked, the grill master will then remove the flat and point sections. The point is then thrown back into the smoker for further cooking due to it's higher fat content.  The result is a piece of meat that looks completely burnt, but doesn't taste burnt. In fact it's beautiful and swelled up with wonderful juices. Enough digressing!\\n\\nThe brisket is incredibly tender and beautifully seasoned. The burnt ends simply melt away in your mouth and has these beautiful pink smoke rings in every piece. If you squeeze those delicious burnt ends, you can see all those delicious juices just ooze out. I'm hungry just talking about it.\\n\\nI never was much of a fan of beef ribs, always favoring pork, but Franklin BBQ converted me. These beef ribs were probably the most tender ribs I have ever had up to this date. You know you have an extremely tender rib when you can use a flimsy plastic fork to pull out all the meat in one piece. It it has the same rub as the brisket and cooked to perfection. Hell, you can clean the whole rib with your hands.\\n\\nThe sides were good. I especially liked the baked beans. They had a nice spicy kick to them, but still had tangy qualities like most baked beans. I wasn't too much of a fan of the cole slaw, but that's mainly because I favor a sweeter slaw. It was crunchy though, and I liked that.\\n\\nIf you have any ounce of room left in your stomach, have some dessert. Now from what I heard, Franklin BBQ does not make these pies, but a lady makes pies strictly for Franklin. They offer Key Lime, Pecan, and a Bourbon Banana Kreme pie. GO FOR THE BOURBON BANANA KREME PIE! Super smooth and delicious. A perfect way to end your meal as you slowly enter your meat coma.\\n\\nIf you're in Austin, you have to eat at Franklin BBQ I don't care how early you have to get there to be in line, it is a must go-to place if you are visiting Austin, TX."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The brisket does live up to the hype!

Who doesn't love dark wood and a fireplace?  Cozy but not tight.  Upstairs not as great-- that is one reason to avoid the weekend night.\\n\\n2.  Decent pricing.  Not too expensive, good food.  Not as cheap as it's sister Cambridge Common, but much better nachos. (See #3). \\n\\n3.  The nachos.  My favorite is the assorted.  A small is a perfect size for a starter.  Anything bigger and you are in meal territory.  You need to ask for a side of sour cream.  (can't remember if they come with gauc.) \\n\\n4.  Beer.  I love it; they got it.  Good ones, too.  Not as good a selection as Cambridge Common, but not as loud either.  \\n\\n5. The veggie burger/veggie options.  As a lifer-veg, I must say this is one of my favorite \\"vegetarian\\" restaurants.  I like it because they have excellent vegetarian food (and choices!  and not just one or two!) but also good (so I'm told) meat choices.  Two veggie burgers- one fancy with fries and a salad, one cheaper (but good) with fries.  \\n\\n6. Daily specials.  I almost always get a special.  Their butternut squash soup with walnuts and cranberry sauce rocks.  Their pesto veggie burger is also a hit.  \\n\\n7. Service.  I see your complaints below, but I've always had good experiences (again, I credit the non-busy nights). \\n\\nOverall, I recommend Christopher's for a beer, for a nice dinner out with a loved one, a date, a place to bring relatives.  There is little I wouldn't recommend it for."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love this cute little place.

We came prepared with our own lawn chairs and  ice chest filled with drinks and snacks (stopping for breakfast was not part of our plan)! \\n\\nThe Franklin's staff were so sweet and kind. They thanked everyone for waiting and offered drinks and beer for sale while waiting. The bathrooms opened up around 8:15am! \\n\\nThe doors opened right at 11am and we were ordering at 11:15am! We ordered the brisket, ribs, sausage, pulled pork and turkey. The staff were so friendly they even sang Happy Birthday to my husband and gave us a pie on the house for the birthday boy! We sat at a table with a friend we made while in line. The BRISKET was AMAZEBALLS!!! We enjoyed everything else but came specifically for the brisket. \\n\\nIn all the hustle and excitement, we realized afterwards on our receipt we were charged for the turkey but never received it.

Absolutely a tourist trap, but honestly my children ages four, eight and fourteen enjoyed the show. Personally I thought the show at times was very noisy and difficult to follow, but the children enjoyed the chaos and ate while the actors were singing.  Locate a discount on the ticket prices; paying full price makes you an absolute tourist/sucker.  There is a full bar and plenty of items to purchase to enhance your experience including a pirate photo when entering.  Honestly, a photo without at least one costumed pirate is simply a gimmick; Medieval Times has at least a character to stand with you. They advertise \\"passed appetizers\\" before the show, but that is a bait and switch item; there aren't any.  We sampled both the soup and salad. The soup had a tortilla taste and was a little spicy. The salad wasn't terrible with Ranch dressing.  The children's adult entree' was chicken; we paid the adult price for the meal since we bought the tickets at a fraction of the advertised price.  We opted out of the mac n' cheese.  Both my wife and I had the beef and it was very tender and surprisingly delicious. The dinner includes Pepsi or water, but you can ask for Sprite and adult beverages are available.  Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and piece of cake that amazingly had no taste whatsoever.  There is a recommended tip that I felt was very fair; $5 for each adult and $3 for each child.  In short, the food is hot and not terrible, the show is entertaining, but noisy, and I would recommend it as a \\"one and done\\" tourist spot."},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I can't believe I never reviewed this place!

The scrambled eggs were very well prepared, but, at the end of the day, pretty much just scrambled eggs.

The Bistek plate a month or so ago was decent; then a few days ago I had the chiliquiles plate. Its not actually on the menu; but a picture under the menu board caught my eye. A combination of chicken, delicious verde, chips, sour cream, radish, and cheese was really tasty. \\n\\nI like Crucita's; yet its basic fare when you think of other places like Torchy's in Austin that just blow it out of the park.

Or in the mood for Southern dining? Screen Door is the answer. This restaurant represents the intersection between locally sourced ingredients from the Northwest and comforting cuisine from the South, spanning from South Carolina to New Orleans. \\n\\n1. What is the restaurant like?\\nScreen Door provides a casual environment conducive for dining out with friends, family, or a special someone. The restaurant offers ample seating but because of the delicious food and competitive prices, all tables are highly coveted, and there will likely be a wait. Dining here made us feel like we had indeed been transported to the South. The staff members were welcoming, and the restaurant served true comfort food. \\n\\n2. What should you get here?\\nAccording to our waitress, the most ordered entree, by far, is the Screen Door Chicken and Waffle. Her other recommendations were the Bananas Foster French Toast, Biscuits & Gravy, and Praline Bacon. \\n\\nWe ordered the: \\n\\nScreen Door Chicken & Waffle (buttermilk battered fried chicken breasts over a sweet potato waffle) - The chicken breast was juicy, tender, and crispy. It is the prototype for what fried chicken should taste like. Neither of us are sweet potato lovers, but we were absolutely hooked on the waffle. It had a crisp and light texture, which counteracted the more heavy, fried chicken. \\n\\nHuevos Rancheros (corn tortilla, beans, cheese, and brisket topped with an egg) - On the daily special menu, the Chilaquiles was a filling dish packed with a plethora of ingredients. This Southern take on a traditional Mexican breakfast was divine. \\n\\n3. Other things to note?\\n- Our waitress was so sweet and attentive.  \\n- On a Thursday morning at around 10 am, we did not encounter a wait. \\n\\nWe loved Screen Door!

First, they raised their prices and adjusted their menu items.  To be honest, a main reason I kept coming back to Cypress was their half-off happy hour special on appetizers, particularly their mac and cheese.  The last time I had gone, the mac and cheese was much improved, and a little more expensive. However, this time I was shocked to find that the mac and cheese had been taken off the happy hour special, and was now advertized as a \\"side\\" for $6 (which seems exorbitant for a side dish, but that's a different story).  Nevertheless, I ordered it anyway.  When we ordered, the waitress told us that they had ended their half off appetizer special for happy hour (even though the specials board at the door said differently)!  To add insult to injury, the side mac and cheese was much diminished--the quantity was much less than it was before as an appetizer (and for $6 instead of $3-$4), and it just wasn't as good.  \\n\\nNow the only advantage Cypress has is its convenient location.  Otherwise, it's become just another overpriced Midtown bar.  I don't think I'll be back as often, unless its for a school function.

Or should I say 'Irashaimase!'\\n\\nIn the world of ramen there is no essential tradition, no strict rules, it just has to taste good. Despite this laissez faire cuisine I would still say Austin had it wrong...until now.\\n\\nRamen tatsu-ya uses mainly a pork broth with shoyu and miso options. The first time I had tonkatsu shoyu base and it was good, thick broth, fatty pork belly, very savory. I usually prefer spicy ramen so next time I chose 'miso-hot' and I was 'bikkurishita!' (surprised). Not since 2010 in Japan have I had ramen that good. The ajitama egg is just right, so I ordered extra. The noodles were so perfectly done, I ordered extra. And I can rarely get enough spice so I ordered extra, called a 'spicy bomb.' Although the bomb didn't quite do it for me everything else left me in bloaty satiated heaven. \\n\\nThe atmosphere truly reminds me of some haunts in Japan, minus the hoarding honkey hipsters in line. This place is becoming popular fast, so expect to wait standing in line for a while. I have to give kudos to how the staff manages this massive influx of hungry patrons in timing orders, seating, and the overall craziness. Ramen is a highly time sensitive food and they make sure you get your meal at its peak. I've heard some people whinge about them not offering takeout containers or forks and other idiosyncrasies of American dining, and to them I give them my biggest eye roll. I admire the devotion Tatsu-ya has to their food and serving it only in a way that meets their standards.\\n\\nIt is a little pricey for a bowl of noodles, but given it is the only good ramen I've had in Austin, I'd say it's worth it.  \\n\\nBottom-Line:  Best ramen I've had since I made the sad trip back from Japan."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Se7en Bites is pretty much Heaven in your mouth.

The food is great and reasonably priced.  The food is the strongest so I will focus my assessment on that:\\nBurrata & Prosciutto-So good.  Both were very fresh-the burrata was silky and the prosciutto had just the right amount of saltiness.  There was a balsamic drizzle on top that complimented it well.\\nCaesar Salad-We said we were sharing this one so they brought it out in separate bowls.  Great touch!  That way my sister and I would not fight over the delicious croutons that were on it.  The salad was standard but it had these warm crouton balls on them.  They were like mini arancini balls but with a cheesy dough instead of rice.  So unexpected yet so good!\\nPasta Carbonara-So delicious.  My sister wanted warm comfort food and she most certainly got it.  It was so creamy and had a umani element to it.  There were bits of pancetta but the star of this dish was the sauce.\\nChicken Milanese-Really good.  Perfect amount of crisp and a generous portion.  Topped with arugula and cherry tomatoes.\\nDefinitely go here for the food.  The only quasi weird thing about this place is the spacing.  Maybe because it is small and in a strip mall, everything felt a bit crowded.  Our bus girl was really quick about taking away our plates, which is great but also added to the fact that things were too close together.

When the Foster business association decided to put on a street fair it turned into the best opportunity to test the food at this now top rated in national magazines eatery. \\nIt does have that look from the outside as a bit of a dive, but inside you can tell they have put a bit of cash into a new entrance and made it a few levels above greasy spoon on the interior.

Never having Poutine before I thought it had a good mix of tastes, would recommend that if you have not tried it to do so.

Do you love waffles? Well you can order this dish and end up having it last you for two meals. Or if you like to be nice, you can share. I just say this because your dish is monstrous. With that, you get three pieces of delightful fried chicken which is very MOIST if I may add. And the waffles? If you love sweet potato, they make their waffles a sweet potato version. And this compliments the dish in the whole Southern essence that it is. You can't go wrong ordering this dish at all!!!!!!\\n\\n- BLOODY MARY: I've never really been a Bloody Mary drinker until I had Screen Doors! I love how peppery their drink is. So simple and garnished with an olive and okra (to give that Southern essence). One of my favorites in my book! It's just as notorious as Tasty N' Sons Bloody Mary. (Which one is better? Depends on your taste palette).\\n\\n- OYSTER BENEDICT: If you are a fan of eggs benedict, try their oyster version because it's quite delish! Served with a side of hash and fresh fruit. The hollandaise sauce is so rich and the oyster adds a bit of salt. You get this rich dish that is quite heavy - in the end your taste buds are thanking you that you ordered this dish. The oyster comes in a scramble version if those of you don't like benedict. \\n\\n- BANANA FOSTER FRENCH TOAST: If you have a sweet tooth and you like your breakfast sweet, then you may like the french toast! Make that the Banana Foster version! You can totally taste the rum-caramelized within the bananas. The French toast come in 4 colossal sized pieces which is accompanied with fresh fruit as well. I couldn't finish this dish either so it'll be nice to share as well. Or have two meals if you want to be greedy. \\n\\nI've never had a disappointing brunch here.

I'll give you the rundown and let you be the judge. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, we showed up early for our reservation to get drinks at the bar. We sit, have a drink, and go check when it was our time. Hostess said it would take 10-15 more minutes. Not a big deal, but a little strange. Then they have trouble moving our bar tab over to our table, which I thought was strange also. On to dinner. \\n\\nOur waiter (who was very good) explained the deal--basically that their first courses are great and you can order them by the piece rather than pay one price for a set number of servings. We had the hamachi tostadas, which were OUTSTANDING. We also ordered the hush puppies and the rabbit and rattlesnake sausage, which nobody liked. Hush puppies were way too clips to what you could get at anywhere else on the planet to be worth the price. \\n\\nOn to the main courses. I know we tried the wagyu skirt steak and the elk, but we can't remember the others. Both were good but nowhere near the price they were charging. \\n\\nAnd that was the final thing--after all was said and done, the final bill was over $500 for a party of four, and that's prior to the tip. I'm completely ok with paying that for a meal and have done it many times, but this just wasn't worth the price.

It was especially obvious as the bright afternoon sun illuminated and exposed the filth and grime of who knows how long? Gross.Yuk. Eww. Boo.

He is merely unfocused, typical maybe even expected behavior at entry level gigs ...I get it...done a few of those myself. But it is so terribly annoying when u walk in somewhere and the clerk swiftly and loudly asks u what u want when ur not even across the threshold of the door..thank you for acknowledging us but....awkward, then when ur ready to order and ur up to the counter waiting, the very same intensely eager or bored employee that ¬†just 2 minutes ago urgently needed ur order is now oblivious and walking around ignoring us...hence 'out of sync' customer service. He will get his flow together eventually.He certainly was eager though and very industrious when he served us. Kudos kid. \\nAs for the ice cream....I ordered a chocolate waffle cone dipped in dark chocolate ( he gave me vanilla...derp! lol. ) The cone was excellent! Sad about the flavour-less milky ice cream in it though. Marble Slab ice cream in my opinion lacks natural flavour or even any flavour for that matter...both my coffee and my double dark chocolate were completely devoid of any taste.Boo...summer heat beater let down. I now understand why they offer all those 'flavour explosion' ingredient add ins now.

I'm not sure what happened but tonight was AWFUL!!! We probably will not be going back again. Wednesday is ladies night, at least it's supposed to be. We waited until 6:00 and went up to pay. The guy tells me we can only bowl 30 minutes that they have unexpected leagues tonight. I told him I'm not paying $7 to bowl for 30 minutes, what sense does that make? $7 would have lasted my girls all night had they wanted. He goes on to say there's other things for them to do. The arcade and laser tag. I said my little one won't do laser tag. And honestly the arcade is very lame. There's only a few things in there but we did already have an arcade card because there is 3 things they will play. Bowling is what we were there for. So the lady in line after me was also told the same thing and wasn't happy either. So we speak to the manager and he says he wouldn't charge us for the 30 minutes. That he didn't know until 15 minutes ago that more leagues were coming. But what's frustrating is, they shouldn't be allowing more leagues to come on if they're running promotional nights. It should be one or the other. But he did. So he says we have 50 minutes at no charge. Which is what it should have been since we were there to bowl for a few hours and couldn't. I wouldn't expect them to charge us honestly. So all leagues came and there was a few of us on 3 lanes that were free lanes and not being used by leagues. So then someone comes down and says we have to get off. Again I'm confused as to why. Especially since as I told him, there is a new random couple 2 lanes over. Why would we have to leave and new people after us are now coming in? He says because they need it for a leaugue. So then he leaves and comes back to tell us his manager said we had to leave because we didn't pay and the new couple 2 lanes over did. So now it's my fault they said they didn't have any open lanes for us? I went to pay when we came in as I do EVERY single time. When he came back down to tell us we had to leave, he never even asked if we wanted to pay to continue? So we went up and used the arcade card and still NO ONE was on that lane. So I do not understand why he came down and said they needed that lane. They should have asked us if we wanted to pay or let us stay until someone else paying came in and wanting a lane. I could see that and would have understood leaving. I didn't realize this was more about $7 than customer service. I'm still just shocked at what happened. This is my first time writing any negative review but this was horrible! How awful of any business to be that way over $7. Had they gave us the option to pay, we would have. When he came down the first time, he lied. Because he said we needed to get off the lane because it was for the leaugue. But when I mentioned the new ppl 2 lanes over, he didn't know what to say and left. Then came back to tell us it was because they paid and we didn't. I didn't argue. It was obvious that I wasn't happy after hearing that. Why didn't he ask us if we wanted to pay? We were on the lane for free because of THEIR error. They had more irritated people than us. And we weren't the only one on a lane for free. But were the only ones asked to get off the lane. I don't know if this is a new manager or what but we've been there many times and have always had great experiences there. Great people and customer service. But now I'm pretty sure I will not go back. That was ugly and very distasteful. Thank you superplay for your awful management that would kick someone out over $7. Especially since had they had a lane at 6:00 Like they should have, I would have paid my $7 and there wouldn't have been any problem. I'm almost tempted to come by and pay the damn $7 anyway since that's what this was all about. Seven lousy dollars.

I don't think I would ever go back to Sushi Garden because for comparable prices, Oyama has better service (has anyone seen the waitresses at SG smile?!), less waiting time, better dining atmosphere, more menu variety and the food is just as good if not better. This is by no means a rant on SG, but it's hard to not compare the two as both are very popular Japanese eats in the same neighbourhood.\\n\\nNotable hits:\\n- Seafood salad: greens topped off with a good variety of raw seafood bits (salmon, tuna, squid; just a few off the top of my head) with a light tangy gingery dressing. They don't go overboard with the dressing, which I like.  I've gotten this every time!\\n- Alaska roll: I love the Alaska roll at SG, but this is even better! Can you imagine that? The secret is in the sauce that they drizzle over the rolls. It's not as wet as SG's and has more of a tangy kick to it.\\n- Deep fried California roll: pleasantly surprised at how light and non-greasy this is.\\n- Spicy tuna sashimi: this was once again a huge favourite at SG, and Oyama has beat it too. Both I feel are very Korean influenced because the spicy sashimi sauce is sweet, however Oyama's is not as sweet as SG's and is actually spicy! Boyfriend loves this one.\\n- I've loved all of their house special rolls, with the exception of the Mangodise roll; I'm just not a huge fan of fruit in sushi. Like seriously, I have trouble picking out favourites, they're all good. These are pricier than their regular maki sushi rolls, but are worth it for the big portions and amazing presentation. \\n\\nThe decor is nice and feels above their price point. The tables are laid out in a way that I won't be rubbing elbows with diners at the next table. I also really like the patio outside during the summer. It's quiet and great for groups; but be warned that they don't take reservations for groups less than 8 people. Though I've never had to wait long for a table, whether it's 2 people or a slighter bigger group. And oh, did I mention that there's a private lot and plenty of nearby free street parking. *cough cough* One can't say the same about SG...\\n\\nThe only things I would change about Oyama is that one, they need better music selection. Britney Spears bubblegum pop or similar isn't exactly complementary. And two, they either need smaller toilets in the ladies' room or bigger stalls.

It was tender but besides the bark, there was almost no flavor. Just tasted like a well done pot roast. And the odd thing for me was the bark which had a bitter, almost charcoal-like flavor that wasn't pleasant. \\n\\nThe BBQ sauces were all tasty and on the sweeter side. Excellent service and very friendly staff.

Therefore, when I am free for breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday I try to seek-out a unique brunch spot. I haven't been to this space since it changed over from Tatlow's but read a lot of great reviews on Yelp and was intrigued by their brunch menu. They have a small number of items, but they represent a good balance of flavours and options: short ribs and fried eggs, lumberjack, house-brined corned beef hash...\\n\\nMy pops ordered the mascarpone-stuffed french (intentionally not capitalizing this) toast, and I had the short ribs. The french toast was crispy, and the sweet cheese filling ensured that the interior was moist (I hate this word, but I have to use it here) and flavourful. The over-easy eggs and lean short ribs were stacked on top of a crispy latke, and these heavy ingredients were counterbalanced with a small tomato-frisee salad. The portion sizes were perfect too.  \\n\\nI have a few trivial criticisms. First, their dinner menu contains a dictionary sidebar with terms used in their dish descriptions. I find this pretentious and unnecessary. Second, the layout fails in the feng shui department. Containing booths, banquettes, a bar, and an awkward longtable, the interior design has no flow and made me feel kind of anxious. \\n\\nI should also mention that the service and craft beers on tap were impressive.

We only ordered dessert, which did take a very long time, but we hardly noticed with all the music and dancing going on around us as well as Ian consistently checking in with us. The desserts were very good, we ordered red velvet cake and a chocolate brownie ice cream sandwich.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"If you love ribs as much as I do - aka a person that will choose stuffing their face alone over hanging out with friends at a bar - then definitely consider checking out Fox Bros. They fall within my top five ATL rib joints. My take:\\n*****\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nLike most BBQ joints, they wings, slabs, and Southern sides. They also have robust appetizer and sandwich sections that make it ideal for lunch. What I tried:\\n\\n*Fried Pickles: They're soaked in buttermilk, breaded, and fried, and served with ranch dressing. Absolutely delicious in a you're-going-to-have-to-see-a-cardiologist-soon type of way. \\n\\n**Half Slab: If you enjoy \\"dry\\" ribs (ones that aren't slathered in sauce), then you'll likely love these. Mine had plenty of flavor (thanks, Mr. Smoke Ring), and it had a nice bark on top. Not quite \\"fall-off-the-bone,\\" but still pretty damn good. \\n\\n***Potato Salad: Very moist and creamy. (It has a good amount of mayo in it.) \\n\\n***Collards: Incredibly savory, almost slightly sweet. I love.\\n\\nThey have draft beers for days, and a wonderful sweet tea. \\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nVery attentive and fast. I think I only waited about five to seven minutes for my appetizer to come out, and fifteen for my slab and sides.\\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR\\nTheir parking lot is a hot mess, so look for a spot in the neighborhood that Fox Bros resides in. In contrast, they have plenty of seating, both inside and outside; however, this popular spot will likely require you to wait a bit.\\n\\nAlso, it's great to hangout with friends or do business there.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\nConsidering the generous portions that you'll receive (you could probably take home half), I think it's priced well. Most apps, sandwiches, and plates fall under $10, $15, $26. I think Fox Bros is a classic example of \\"you pay for what you get.\\" \\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nDefinitely an excellent restaurant to satisfy your \\"if-I-don't-eat-ribs-right-now-I'm-going-to-murder-someone\\" kind of craving."},{"name":"Azteca","address":"4250 Mercantile Dr","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3","text":"First off, $12.50 margaritas anywhere is a ripoff.

Cafe 101 was one of my favorite places, and I loved introducing it to so many of my friends. I had to be happy b/c I went there yesterday AND today :) \\n\\nThe restaurant inside looks exactly the same. The menu & prices look the same too. The menu cover says the food is Szechuan - and while the food is mostly Szechuan, the server said they still have a few Taiwanese dishes too. The server confirmed management changed too.\\n\\nI ordered three dishes for take-out yesterday. I knew going in that the food wouldn't be exactly the same b/c we'd miss the \\"fresh off the wok\\" sizzling hot flavors - and I was right. Eating the food one hour later, the food was just pretty good, not outstanding. The \\"Sauteed Snow Pea Leaves\\" ($12.95) was the best tasting out of the three. It still tasted great one hour later :) Another favorite of mine, the \\"Basil Chicken\\" ($8.95) was good too but eating it out of a plastic container was definitely not as great as eating it from a clay pot. The \\"Eggplant in Garlic Sauce\\" ($8.95) was a little on the bland side which was disappointing b/c this is usu. one of their best dishes too. Still, keep in mind we didn't experience the food as it should be experienced so I'd definitely order these dishes again to give a more fair evaluation.\\n\\nHowever today I think I had a truer taste of Cafe 101. They have \\"Business Lunch Special Combinations\\" available Mon-Sun 11-3pm. YEP, LUNCH SPECIALS ARE AVAILABLE SAT-SUN TOO! Prices are $6.50-8.50, and include rice, soup, and fried spring roll.\\n\\nToday I got my other all-time favorite here \\"Fish Fillet in Hot Bean Sauce\\" lunch special ($7.50). The fish & sauce were YUMMY and just like I remembered from the last time. Generous portion too - I had enough leftovers for another meal. The hot & sour soup, and fried spring roll were also very good! My meal also started w/ complimentary peanuts (which was ok) and pickled vegetables (refreshing). And to finish off my meal, I got also complimentary sweet red bean soup for dessert - also yummy. \\n\\nService was very friendly and attentive. Then again, there were few customers - the word probably hasn't hit the Asian community yet that Cafe 101 is back. Overall 3.5 stars rounded to 4 b/c of today's experience, and the awesome lunch specials available on the weekends too. \\n\\nFYI - they're closed Tuesdays."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Literally the best ribs ive ever had in my life.

At least I will have said my piece. \\n\\nI knew there would be a wait.  Fine, no issue with that because I knew what I was getting into when I showed up here.   So I'm not writing to complain about the wait or the decor or the service because if the food is good, none of that matters to me. \\n\\nWhen I go out to brunch, I eat the simple foods.  The staples.  The foods that any brunch spot should be able to execute better than I can at home.   \\nI had scrambled eggs with a side of grits and veggie sausage.   It was all just okay.  The eggs were fine, nothing special (and yes, you can make scrambled eggs amazing if you know what to do), the grits was just plain (though to be fair, there isn't much you can do with plain old grits) and the sausage was super dry.   I know it was fake meat, but I've been to places where they cook up the sausage in such a way that it comes out moist.  This was not.  And the price for all of those foods together was too high.   I could have done this myself at home and that is not why I go out to brunch.\\n\\nMy husband had another brunch staple: pancakes.   I don't understand why we can't find decent pancakes in Portland yet, but the consistency was way off.   It was like eating flat pieces of dense cake, and that isn't what a pancake should be.  It should be light and fluffy.   There are suppose to be bubbles in the batter when you make pancakes so that they turn out fluffy, and maybe they beat the hell out of their batter until the bubbles are gone.   I don't know what it is but I feel like photocopying the pancakes section of my Alton Brown book and distributing it around Portland restaurants so that everyone knows the basics.\\n\\nAnd our coffee was...wait, they don't have anything but regular coffee.   No espresso of any kind, just coffee.  This is the second place breakfast place in Portland I have been to that does that.

Seeing as I no longer live in Austin, I was excited about getting great BBQ in central Austin so I wouldn't have to spend a day driving out to Lockhart or Taylor when I do get the chance to visit Austin for a few days. Better still, my Austin home away from home just happens to be over in Cherrywood, a mere hop, skip and a jump away from Franklin. \\n\\nSo I had a week in Austin and I figured that surely during a weeks time when I was a few blocks away from Franklin I'd be able to get some ribs and brisket. Sadly, I was mistaken. Apparently one thing Franklin BBQ is not interested in is getting my money. I went 3 times during the course of the week only to be confronted with \\"sold out\\" all 3 times. After being thwarted the first two times I figure, well maybe getting there after noon is too late. I mean why should I expect a business that advertises their hours as 11-4 to actually serve food during those hours? So finally, a day before I left Austin, I get there at 11:30 on Saturday, a mere 30 minutes after opening. SOLD OUT. Seriously dude? You open at 11 and you sell out in 30 minutes?\\n\\nI would love to have reviewed Franklin based on their food, which is apparently so amazing they can't even keep up with the demand 30 minutes into service. So instead, my review is don't even bother showing up. There is no way you can actually get any food here since they are not interested in selling food. Really, I'm totally mystified that anyone has actually ever eaten here. It seems like they smole about a pound of brisket and a dozen ribs and call it a day.\\n\\nI totally understand that the food cart business requires a fine balance between having enough food for service, but not having so much that you don't sell everything. Ideally you'd like to sell out every day. But maybe, just maybe, if you're selling out within 30 minutes of opening (or hell, even 2 or 3 hours), maybe, just maybe you ought to COOK MORE FOOD!! Obviously there is demand that is not being met. Maybe if they smoked enough meat to last until 2, instead of 11:30, they might make, oh, twice the money. \\n\\nI suppose it is a nice life smoking meat, working for an hour a day and then drinking beers and being a slacker. I'm jealous actually. That's great someone gets to work for an hour a day. However, since I do have to work, I want to get the most out of my Austin mini-vacations, and that includes some proper Texas barbecue. Suffice to say, even if I'm a block away from Franklin next time I'm in Austin, I'm going to drive out of town to get BBQ somewhere that actually likes to sell it for more than an hour."},{"name":"Soul Fire BBQ","address":"182 Harvard Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Food came out cold, waitress had hickies on her neck, when we asked for a manager 3x and it took 25 minutes for him to come see us.

So I went to the restaurant to order and the girl at the cash register gave me so much attitude.  Assumed I came to pick up an order and then when I said I haven't ordered yet,  she threw a menu at me and walked away.  I had to yell after her that I was ready to order.  So she finally took my order and I paid and went to sit up front.  Half an hour passed and no one came to give me my order.  I looked up to see a take out order sitting on the counter so I went up to the counter and as soon as she saw me,  she shoved the bag at me and I'm like wtf? I used to be a waitress, when a customer has already paid for their food, most likely they're at the restaurant waiting for the food and you don't even bring it up to them?

My boyfriend and I perused the menu posted outside and went for it after we were turned away from several other crowded restaurants. We got a table inside, away from most of the noise from the bar/patio area without any wait. The menu had some pretty good variety, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they offered really a lot of seafood. Having only been here for drinks before, I assumed their food would be more bar/pub type food, but they had some really good looking small plates and entrees. I ordered a wedge salad with the coconut shrimp small plate, and boyfriend got the seafood fra diavolo. I think the coconut shrimp I got came with 6 or 7, and a mango-based dipping sauce, which was very tasty. The wedge salad came with bacon, tomato and blue cheese. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it didn't look that great - it tasted fine and is what I wanted, but it just felt and looked like it was lacking something. Maybe more veg toppings? The fra diavolo was a pretty decent portion of pasta in a really nice sauce, and with a good variety of fish but just not much of it. It also came with two slices of garlic bread, which was a nice addition. Service was fine, nothing special or terrible. except at the end it felt like we were being rushed out.

My husband loves to barbeque and we have been working on the perfect brisket for years. Let's just say we still have years to go. There is SO much that goes into a great brisket.  The quality of meat for starters. Then you have to consider the rub, which could be any number spices in countless combinations. What are you grilling over? Wood? What kind? Are you gonna use direct or indirect heat? What  temperature? How long? Are you gonna wrap it up? If so, when? It is a time consuming labor of love.  Don't think you're going to just buy a cook book and get it right either. Even with Steven Raichlen's Barbeque Bible in hand, it ain't gonna happen. There are too many subtle details, too many little secrets that you have to learn, preferably at the side of a master.  So the hubby and I have accepted reality. If we want great brisket, we have to drive somewhere to get it.\\n\\nA friend of mine posted on Facebook after a trip to Franklin's that it was the best barbeque ever.  WHAT?!? Well we'll just see about that! So I finally got a chance to stop by today. I arrived at 1:00 and after fifteen minutes in line, the announcement was made that they were out of pulled pork. I was determined though, so I stuck around. Fifteen more minutes and I was at the counter, just after they ran out of ribs. DANG IT!  I decided to try the two meat plate with brisket and sausage. The owner asked if I wanted fatty or lean. Pppphhht! Fatty of course!  He commented \\"That's how it should be!\\" and we chatted a bit about flavor etc. This guy knows his stuff! I paid for my plate and popped a tip in the jar. The guy at the register seemed surprised. I told him that good barbeque is hard work! I think that made the owners day. It's always good to be appreciated.\\n\\nI must say, my friend was right. The brisket was by far the best I've ever had. it was fork tender and TAS-TY! I tried the sauces and they were all excellent, but the brisket didn't really need sauce. For the sides, I opted for the beans and cole slaw. Both were very good. The slaw deserves special mention.  I'm guessing it was made with red cabbage, which made it visually unique. It was vinegar based AND creamy at the same time, which I've never encountered before. There was also a hint of sweetness there. A very interesting combination of flavors! \\n\\nI will definitely be back to try the pulled pork and ribs.

She seemed a bit doubtful but rushed away to see if she could get it in and we had success! In any case, everything around us looked amazing. We started with the chicken liver snack (yum) before our burgers came, but because we were seated so close to our neighbors, we all inquired about what everyone was eating. On both sides of us, folks ordered the corn cakes with popcorn and peppers. It looked so strange but both parties cleaned their plates and claimed deliciousness. Also, the lamb dish over to our right had us drooling, and that was AFTER we finished our burgers.\\n\\nThat burger, that wonderful, juicy finger-licking burger! I didn't put it down at all. My husband kept eating his, putting it down, snacking on the homemade chips and then going back to said burger. I don't know how he could do it. I didn't want for it to leave my mouth!

It's a prime location in Gunbarrel, and the owners have obviously put a lot of thought and work into it.  I went for the nighttime cocktail experience, so my review is limited to that, and does not cover the daytime cafe.  Overall, I would say there is some room for improvement, but they are on the right track.  A few simple changes would really make this place fantastic. \\n\\n1. Food: A+ EXCELLENT!  The bacon wrapped dates were my favorite, but everything tasted amazing.  They had run out of some things I wanted to try (meatballs!), but that's to be expected opening weekend.  I can't wait to go back and try the items I didn't get to this time.\\n\\n2. Cocktails: B+.  The specialty cocktails offered on the menu are martinis only, and seem to cater to a sweeter palate so we did not order them.  My table ordered a few classic whiskey cocktails, which were good once we spoke to the bartender about the drinks (the server didn't know much about whiskey).  The manhattan was tasty, the old fashioned was okay but had too much simple syrup.  They have quality cocktail ingredients for the most part, but...a nice cocktail bar needs either Luxardo cherries or good house made cherries. Those bright red maraschinos don't cut it in a $10-$15 drink.\\n\\n3. Service: A- The host, server, and bartender were all very positive and friendly and the service was great  The bartender was knowledgeable and made a point to come out to our table and ask about our drinks, which I appreciated.  The servers could benefit from some training on cocktails and liquor available behind the bar, but they are all new so I'm sure that will come with time.  Other than that, everyone exceeded expectations.\\n\\n4. Atmosphere: A- Pros: Nice decor with a variety of seating, very modern and open, and I love all the windows.  It has a comfortable outdoor patio area as well.  Cons:  It's way too bright inside at night.  The edison lights are cool, but there are SO MANY of them.

We split, some manned a free table while one-by-one we went up to the \\"Bays\\" to order food. I ended up at Bay 3 - sandwiches and got a Deluxe Chicken Sandwich and Fries, a Cherry Slush (with a Mickey Mouse straw), and a Mango Sorbet. Yes, I was hungry. \\n\\nThe deluxe portion of the chicken sandwich was the bacon and cheese, go figure. I declined the toppings bar and ate it as is with some BBQ sauce and mustard and it was pretty good. The chicken was moist and juicy. The fries were good and even better with the sauce. The cherry slush was very thick and the staff filled it up over the rim, just because. They also told me about it before I took it from them so that I didn't spill it. I like extra for free. I'd get another one of those. Not quite like an Icee but good nonetheless. The Mango Sorbet was the real winner on my plate. Even though it was pre-packaged, it didn't matter because the taste was real and to top it off, it was sugar free. Score! I think one of my friends who is a diabetic enjoyed it so much she ate most of mine and loved it. I should've told her to get her own lol.

Everyone who greeted/served us was extremely hospitable and welcoming (you don't get that a lot where I'm from) and this place offered such a comfortable atmosphere upon arrival, so my family and I decided to stay and eat. The restaurant had a classic and vintage vibe to it, although I was a little sad the giant crawfish on the roof wasn't there!\\n\\nI started off with the Northwest Salmon and Dungeness Crab Chowder, which only comes in a larger bowl size, so my family and I shared it and it was probably the tastiest chowder I've ever had! I'm used to the traditional clam chowder, so a salmon and crab chowder was definitely different and very appetizing. There were very large pieces of crab and enough for my family of 5 to have a good amount to taste. Unfortunately it's about $11 for a bowl...pretty steep compared to the rest of their lunch items.\\n\\nFor my entree I ordered the Seafood Fettuccine, which had scallops and shrimps in a creamy garlic sauce.

Both times have been marked by service so slow that the waiter apologetically comped at least one thing on our bill (the first time, our entire meal was comped; the second time, our milkshakes--which arrived merely cool, not cold--were comped), which is a nice gesture.

There are booths by the window, half booths which separate the dining space from the bar area, and a mix of smaller and larger tables in the middle of the space. There are a lot of deer horns, big circle chandeliers and a big Western theme going on here with a trendy vibe mixed in.\\n\\nWe were sat immediately by the hostess at a four top that was dressed with large pewter chargers and silverware with more Western themes on it. We were greeted by a server a few minutes later who went into a very long spiel right up front on how the entire menu works. I would have preferred to do a drink order before diving into the menu. Us ladies had barely had time to shed our purses and say hello, and the gentlemen were also in the middle of their initial pleasantries. This long spiel included the following information: \\n\\n1. All menu ordering is done at once, for every section except for the Wild Game Fettine which was more like a light, first appetizer. We had to decide on our entire First, Second, Main, and Side courses before we could put our entire order in. \\n\\n2. A run through of each course, popular offerings, and recommendations in each section. This included a side note on the First Course, where we could choose three things to try and he would create a \\"sampler\\" out of those with pieces for each of us that would be priced accordingly. We really liked this - this was a fantastic idea. \\n\\nDirectly after that, with barely a breath in between, he asked us what he could get us to drink. Two in our party usually just get iced tea so that was easy. For myself, I hadn't even had time to reach for the cocktail menu - nor did we have time to pass it around. The timing was just funky on this intro and I think it just didn't work for us. The other issue we had is that with the volume level for the restaurant, with background music. Some of our party were unable to hear the waiter and had to get a quick repeat before we dove in and figured it all out. It was really kind of a maddening experience. \\n\\nMoooving on...... We ate a lot of different animals that night. If you want to eat a lot of different animals, try a nice spectrum of meats, this is a good place to go to do that. \\n\\nWild Game Fettine: We went for the trio. I'm not going to go through what each was because it would be a paragraph. What it was, though, was different meats sliced really thin, layered on a plate. There was one of each of the three meats for us to try. We liked the Elk, Pork Spinalis, Huckleberries, Black Garlic the best. It just had the best flavor. \\n\\nFirst Course: We had our waiter put together a sampler. We chose the Kangaroo Nachos, Wild Boar Ribs, and Grilled New Zealand Langoustines. The nachos were good - we received a chip with a piece of kangaroo on it and sauce, as well as guacamole..decent. The wild boar ribs were very succulent, and had a nice barbecue sauce on them, very tasty. The langoustines, (shrimp) were a little scrawny, however, and were hard for us to taste, a little disappointing. \\n\\nSecond Course: My husband and I decided to split the Shaved Vegetable Salad. The maytag blue cheese was fantastic, but otherwise the salad was ho hum. Dry, actually - just a lot of shaved root veggies. \\n\\nMain Course: Two of us had the Colorado Lamb, one of us  tried the signature Roasted Garlic Stuffed Beef Tenderloin, and one of us had the Elk Loin. We all loved our main courses and cross shared around the table. Everything was moist, juicy, flavorful, fantastic. Of my lamb, I will say that it is some of the best I've ever had - and the smashed fingerling potatoes were perfectly crispy and salted..simply wonderful.\\n\\nDessert was a must. Our friends had the Ancho Chile Chocolate Cake and said it was very good. My husband tried the Churros which was impressively presented - tall churro sticks in a big glass, nicely powdered with sugar and cinnamon. The three sauces that came with were in tall shot glasses - caramel, chocolate, and a raspberry puree - really, really good. I had the Butterscotch Budin and it blew my mind. The salted popcorn sweet cream on top was amazing, and the butterscotch was decadent, smooth and creamy.\\n\\nWe left with our minds blown, we really did. Three out of four of our party, however, weren't feeling well the next day. I think my friend's suggestion of the richness of the meals, as well as many different types of meat may be the answer to that. We really did have a wonderful evening, though. Such a different way to do a steak night downtown. It was also nice to see Chef overseeing and expediting plates leaving the kitchen. I think there are a few kinks to work out with the ordering process.

The meats are all cooked to perfection and the flavors are so good that no sauce is needed.  Good thing too because the sauces are a bit subpar (just my opinion).  \\n\\nA few tips:\\n\\n1. You may experience a shorter line on a rainy day - it happened to me.  True story\\n2. Do not get there past 10:30 am or lines will be ridiculously long\\n3. Being early has its perks.  You get turkey!  This might not be on the top of many people's lists but this is a MUST try.  Probably the best bite of poultry I've ever had.\\n4. Being late has its perks. You get free food (sometimes)!  We got a huge serving of sausage and sides because we were the last party in line and no more customers to sell to.  \\n5.  If you get there early and they have everything in stock, order a little bit of everything.  It's totally worth it.\\n\\nI have tried everything on the menu and cannot say a bad thing about any of it.  It's all phenomenal. If you're into sauce, I recommend bringing your own.

It looked delicious but I though it was lacking in flavor and spice....something was missing.  I love a good spicy Bloody Mary so getting something bland was a little disappointing. \\n\\nI couldn't decide between a burger or sushi so I ordered the bento box that had both.  The burger was actually a slider and looked like the same as the burger that came attached to the Bloody Mary...that was odd.  The sushi was okay.

The only silver lining here was that the bolognese was fair, but here's my list of reasons not to go here:\\n\\n1.  Bland, overpriced food. As others have mentioned, the food does not taste fresh.  The salad had brown spots - which in my own fridge is not a problem - but it is when you're charging $10 for old lettuce.\\n2.  The kitchen was out of a few ingredients, which we were only informed of after we had ordered, and after we had been waiting 25 minutes for our food.... that is to say, 25 minutes after the salad plates were taken away. Then we had to reorder and wait longer.  \\n3.  The wine, a chianti, was terrible, but what can you do there.\\n4.  The credit card machine was broken, which we were only told after we had ordered, so we had to pay in cash.\\n5.  There was no manager on duty.  On weeknights this happens sometimes if it's slow, but this was a Friday night!  I've worked in the restaurant business, and no good operation has no manager on duty on a Friday, even if you expect it to be slow.\\n\\nIn sum, a poorly run restaurant with poor food.  \\n\\nDrive the extra 15 minutes down Route 9 East, and go to La Morra in Brookline.

But we were determined after seeing the photos of their chicken and gravy dishes. The wait was around 1 hour (we didn't get in during the first seating). But personally, I think the wait was worth it! We were SO full by the end of it. I got the chicken biscuit sandwich with gravy. Rest of my table tried their grits, omelette, benedict, and chicken and waffle. The chicken and waffle was ginormous! it comes with two giant pieces of fried chicken that was juicy and perfectly fried. A must try if you're here.

Today we headed downtown and hit No Mas. I hadn't been since it was in the old location off Howellmill. The space is amazingly beautiful and very colorful. The shop next door is great! They really put the effort into this restaurant. It's just too bad they didn't do the same for the food. The salsa that they provide the table is ok but could be fresher. It seems like its been sitting in a big vat all week. You know I'm a fan of the ones at Zocalo. At Zo's they make the salsa fresh in house as well as guacamole to order. The chips at No Mas were not very fresh either. They really do look like they are homemade so frying them that day would be better. The guacamole was really good. Bob and I had soup before lunch I had the chicken tortilla and Bob had the seafood soup of the day. Both soups were really good. The lunch itself left little to be desired. As I said in my recent review of Lime Restaurant and I quote\\" How the hell do you f**K up mexican food??!!??\\" The fish taco was just red cabbage and cold fried fish. Really!?!? Does it take that long to fry fish? Why the hell is it cold? I'll tell you. The restaurant does prep that morning and the fish is fried then. That means the fish sits in a metal container on the line until you order it. There was zero sauce of any kind. The shrimp enchiladas made me cry, but in a bland way. The leading spice...SALT. The shrimp inside was so small I needed a magnifying glass to find them. I think they might have been sea monkeys. They are then rolled in a tortilla topped with a ton of cheese and a creama sauce. I think they were trying to hide the fact that they were serving you crap. Lunch was overall a good experience due to the staff. They are super friendly. The space next door is a shop with coffee drinks and desserts. They dessert case looked good. Next time I will just stop at the soup and go get a latte and something fabulous and chocolate. The guy at the store was very friendly and even asked how my lunch was. So I told him. He said he was sorry about the shrimp and then next time I should get the shrimp fajita's. He said the shrimp on there are normal size. He then gave me a card to come back for breakfast and get a discount. I may take him up on that.

The line started out the door and continued inside as you wait to order at the counter. Then you get a number and wait for an open table or one of the 5 bar seats. The place is small but, because of its, table lay out, can hold more people than it appears. At least come after 9 because the line won't be out of the door as I noticed leaving the restaurant. I do not know if this is just because of the hype or the food being good but the secret will be out. All of Austin's gastro lovers will descend here.\\n\\nAs for the food, its' the best ramen I've had in Austin. The dish I got, the #2 Tonkotsu Sho-Yu which is a classic ramen dish while I added Naruto Maki to it. The seasoning is to die for. The pork is so tender and juicy that I wanted more of it there. The noddles do not overwhelm the dish but it helps fill your stomach. In addition I got the Gyoza which are Japanese pork dumplings. That was delicious as well being perfectly seasoned and just soft enough without any hardness to the flour casing. \\n\\nI was full from basically a 12 dollar meal. The food is not over priced and worth your money.

I love a good bbq and most of the time that means a pit in a parking lot will always be better than the sit down restaurant but boy did this place prove me wrong. Service was incredibly good but the food was AHMAZINGGGGGG! We ordered everything off the menu (try not to judge, it was for research purposes). They ran out of spare ribs so we ordered the baby ribs OH MA GAWD! Nice flavor great smoke and taste to it,  the fact I could make it as saucy as I want with the table bbq bottle was GENIUS! Pulled pork was a little drier than I am use to but great flavor. I am personally not a fan of brisket and they ordered it fatty which makes even less appealing than usual but it was basically calling me since they put the plate down and well I went for it. It was soooo good didn't taste fatty at all and was juicy. The chicken has a nice smoke ring to the meat and was very moist! All the sides were phenomenal. The wings were my favorite appetizer along with the frito pie because that deserves its own post but let's just say it's pieces of meat that has been rendered down to melt in move level.

Their phone on hold advertisement says they are excellent communicators with excellent customer service. Not my experience. Suppose to call me the day ahead of pick up, Monday July 3. No Call, as promised, on the day before. Arrived at around 9 am to pick up our stuff. Had made arrangements for an early morning pick 6am. Were to deliver on a Friday to our new home, did not communicate at all with me about delivery, I called and called but no email or return call with information. only one person was helpful, Stewart, in the office. Finally got delivery about 9 days late. Meanwhile my wife and I were in an empty house with not good, few cloths, waiting for our goods to arrive. I had to go out and buy work clothes so I could begin my new job. When our goods were delivered we had some 5 or 6 items damaged. No communication with me when I let Valet know. They left several items at my old house which the landlord found. I sent an email to Valet regarding those items and not answer from them. They delivered several items to me which belong to someone else which I told them, again no reply as if they don't care. I was missing several boxes of goods. From the way they have treated me I doubt they even tried to find them, one of which was especially important. They did not deliver one item which was worth $3,600.  Half hearted response..... \\"sorry your are missing your ...\\" One office worker said you will just have to let your insurance company make a claim. While the workers were finishing packing my wife and I began our drive from Southern California where we lived to our new home in Northern Oregon.  The Landlord of our California home said they left the garage and house doors wide open and trash on the front porch.  Especially irritating they quoted me a price to move me and then AFTER they packed me wanted to charge me another two thousand dollars. I felt like a captive. I had no choice but to pay the fee. Part of the extra charge was for work originally quoted so I managed to negotiate down the fee a bit. My company was paying for the move so I got reimbursed for the original quote and had to pay the balance out of my own pocket. \\nIf you are every considering moving DO NOT USE VALET.

This place has a lot of kinks to work out (or maybe just the kitchen under the current staff).\\n\\nWe arrived a few minute before our 8:45 p.m. reservation on a Saturday night and were promptly seated at a small table next to the stairs leading down to the bar. Nice room, loud, crowded down there - accidentally elbowed a server due to our location and apologized profusely, she shot me a look of death but I don't blame her.  \\n\\nOur server Zoe, once she was able to get to us, was generally fantastic - knowledgable about the menu, ready to offer suggestions and with a great attitude. She's docked a few points because wait staff should alert diners to when items listed on the menu are no longer available - they had run out of both the tagliatelle and pappardelle, so when we finally ordered, we had to send her away as we looked over the menu once more, and when she came back a side dish we added to our order was also not available - but this was a minor problem compared to most of the evening.\\n\\nAfter when ordered, our waitress informed us the kitchen was a little backed up. OK, that happens sometimes in restaurants. But about an hour and a half passed between us ordering and receiving our \\"entrees\\" - one of which was merely two sides, the broccoli dish and the mushrooms dish. We did get the cauliflower four-ways appetizer; that only took about a half an hour to come out, and then followed that up with the potato puree side to tide us over. The cauliflower was excellent and interesting, a great starter; the potato puree with tapenade was a tiny bowl of mashed potatoes with olive tapenade that tasted like what can be bought at the store; the sides were fine for what they were; and the pork and clams were tasty - kind of a different twist on the Portuguese dish, and a lot of pork for the serving size - but only two clams and the flavors, while great, were incoherent as a whole dish. \\n\\nMeanwhile, while we were waiting for our food, the couple next to us received their entrees, but after ordering the steak without anchovy sauce due to an allergy, the dish arrived with sauce intact. When they called over another waitress to inform her, the waitress asked if they could \\"wipe it off\\" and then after hemming and hawing, said she would send it back for a new steak but that \\"I'll be honest, it's going to take a while.\\" Eek. I will say this, they brought out some other items for them to snack on until their properly prepared dish arrived.\\n\\nWhen we left the restaurant, maybe around 11 p.m., one of the chefs was standing up near the hostess table overlooking the dining room, standing next to maybe a manager or something. The same chef was down in the bar area earlier, shooting the breeze with someone. If the kitchen is having that many problems, so much so that the entire wait staff looks like they're at the end of their rope, maybe you shouldn't be out in the dining area but out back trying to get everything on track.\\n\\nWe'd be willing to go back and give Wink & Nod another shot, but they obviously have a lot of work to do operationally if they're going to run like a professional kitchen. I only learned afterwards that a pop-up called Bread and Salt is now running the kitchen, and that Wink & Nod is acting like an incubator for culinary pop-ups.

I call it \\"American tapas\\"-- everything is a small plate, and very very creative.  The grilled carrots are a great opener-- charred on the outside and soft on the inside, plated on a giant smear of yogurt and sweet sweet honey.  Romano beans are also AMAZING, spicy and minty.  Beef neck was unique, to say the least (a little mushy, reminded me of meatloaf).  New York strip was delicious (though they cooked my \\"medium rare\\" as a rare, and the side dishes don't really integrate with the steak well: orange in a cube of pectin and a slab of roast bone marrow).  All the beef here is from Creekstone Farms (which only does black angus and supplies high end NYC restaurants), and you can really taste the quality.  \\n\\nAnd then there's the \\"secret burger.\\"  Listed on some CNN blog as one of the top 10 burgers of 2014, it really does live up to the hype: meat from Creekstone Farms, smoked and ground in house, slathered in a thousand island and caesar concoction, topped with a crispy cheddar chip, all on a house made bun (which is amazingly soft on the inside and crispy on the outside-- they intentionally char the sliced faces on the griddle).  The burger sells out pretty early (they didn't have any left at 8pm on a random Wednesday), so we came back at 5:15 the following Saturday.\\n\\nDesserts are good, though the menu is small. Smoked chocolate bread budding has a meaty taste to it.  Olive oil cake is better- refreshing, with fresh rhubarb.\\n\\nIn sum, Alden & Harlow (the original architects of the building where the restaurant is) would be proud of what they are doing here."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've lived in Atlanta for years and had never eaten here.

By the time my sister got there, a hostess emerged and we were able to be seated. I had the lunch burrito with black beans, rice, chicken, pico, refried beans, and more rice for $8.99. The burrito was very good and very filling. My sister had been feigning for their Nachos and didn't leave a crumb.

The service was fast and the cashier was nice. We placed our ordered and waited at the table for our mocha. The mocha was good - nice and hot considering it was a very brisk morning. The pastries were both soft but flaky so we made a mess everywhere on the table. I was speaking to one of their regular customers and their specialty pastry is called the Nutbox. It's basically a rectangle tart shell loaded with tons of nuts.  This is a really cute and quaint bakery in the area of Beacon Hill - which is one the prettiest parts of Boston.

Very unfortunate. I will say this up front: I loved when Cava was in this location last year, and so I am a bit biased because Cava had better food, had a more pleasant environment, and was less expensive.\\n\\nConsidering that the owners are known as \\"superstar chefs\\" and the place was \\"much anticipated,\\" it's even more of a let-down. It's not much of a restaurant, it's just a burger joint. So you would think they would do much better than they do at the burger part.\\n\\nSo I ordered a burger with cheese. They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked, which seemed strange. So of course it was done more than I liked. This mystified me, as no chef should be serving a one-size-fits-all type of burger. Why not ask? That's all they cook, so why not focus on doing a good job? I was very disappointed by my burger. My wife had the portabello mushroom \\"burger\\" and it was better, but still not great. These are most certainly not noteworthy burgers. I found Burgerville's burgers, by comparison to be better and less expensive. That's not saying a whole lot.\\n\\nWe also ordered a \\"coffee\\" shake. It tasted watery and unappealing, like they had poured a cup of coffee in a shake. Again, Burgerville makes a much better shake, and my point here is simply that... why not go to Burgerville then? They serve local food, they are a local business, they make better food and it's significantly cheaper. Neither place offers you real dishes, so we're equal there.\\n\\nThe only thing that impressed me were the fries. These were pretty good, although a bit too salty in my opinion.\\n\\nThe decor was disappointing as well. It's as if they took over the space from Cava, and ripped out or painted over everything that made it special. The music was loud punk, the furniture looked cheap, and the walls are now a hideous yellow with big blocks of ugly wood paneling. There is not a thing hanging on the walls, so it feels very unfinished and cold. The service was okay but as another reviewer mentioned, the music made communication difficult.\\n\\nIn summary, I was extremely disappointed, by any standard. If you enjoyed Cava when it was here, you will be very sad. If you have eaten burgers elsewhere, you will be let down. And if you want to make new friends, forget it. It's too loud and you don't want to spend any longer in there than you have to. I would suggest that you keep moving and dine somewhere else."},{"name":"No Mas!

Instead, we stayed nearer our Northie 'hood.  We arrived an hour after opening, apparently the first customers of the day.  This place suffers greatly from \\"restaurantus emptyitis\\".  Customers thinking of stopping are dissuaded by the lack of other customers; a problem that begets itself.  Sure enough, the parents who emerged from the minivan that pulled up after us stood tentatively before rounding up the three kids and bringing them in.  And that may be a shame.\\n\\nFor $6.99 to design your own \\"personal pizza\\", it's a decent deal.  With a $2 surcharge for gluten-free crust, and the right choice of toppings, I bet the wife and I could just split one and wrap up the meal with some frozen custard from Rita's a couple doors down.  Today we each got our own.  I took the more \\"kitchen sink\\" approach to my topping choices, while the wife did what she usually does and loaded up on the olives.  I see concerns about the gluten-free crust option, and I'm lucky that my wife is not as sensitive as some.  However, the gluten-free crust is brought in (not a bad thing, and I'm assuming it's Smart Flour) pre-made on a foil pan.  Though we were warned by staff that it is best removed from the pan and cooked directly on the oven surface, we found it to still be nice and crispy (and safer) cooked in the pan. \\n\\nIt's certainly not mind-blowing pizza.   And folks with a buncha kids hopefully order for them, as the \\"select your toppings\\" process can be slow.  But there aren't a whole lot of places for me and my wife to each get the pizza we want (including her GF crust), and dine out together, and enjoy nice conversation, without feeling we are overpaying.

Also, I don't know why people say it is good for groups, I dare someone to come here with a group of over 4 and see if the wait is less than six hours.

A friend and I were looking for a restaurant for our birthday dinner, and seeing as half the people coming were vegetarians, we wanted a place that had a wide variety of meat-free options. Christopher's seemed like the perfect place, so I called and made a reservation for 14 people for the next evening. We showed up and I gave the hostess my name...she couldn't find the reservation in the book. \\"Oh, well that's ok, how many people did you have in your party- four?\\" Hmm...no, a few more than four people. Somehow, they had a free table upstairs that would fit all of us, so either we had some great luck or they actually did hold a table for us and the hostess just messed up. After that close call, we took our seats and just sat around for a while until I had to go downstairs and ask them for some menus. Not the best start to my Christopher's experience. However, everything else was great that night and has been fine the other times I have gone. \\n\\nNow, on to the food and drink. I LOVE the drinks here. I always seem to spend at least twice as much on drinks as I do on food. My favorite is Ben's Chocolate Espresso Layered Martini. So good! They have a good beer selection too. The food is decent as well. I'm not too adventurous with my food choices, and for dinner I stick with the chicken pesto sandwich. The pesto is delicious, and I like the fries too. I've also been here a couple times for brunch. I get the two eggs any way (scrambled). The quality is better at some other places I've been to, but the meal also comes with bacon, toast, home fries, and fruit, which covers practically all my favorite breakfast foods. The coffee is also some of the best coffee I've ever had, and they keep it coming your whole meal. \\n\\nI can't give Christopher's 5 stars due to the issues I had here at first and the fact that I don't always get the best service by my waiters and waitresses, but I love this place and bring all my visitors here at some point during their trip.

Less is more, I think.\\nThis is my second review completing my review for FreeBirds.\\nI walked in earlier this week and found it to be very slow. I counted at least 6 dirty gloves on their kitchen floor. Their containers that hold the ingredients were very messy and most looked cold. The beans were dried up on the spoon and didn't come off to serve well. The staff seemed unhappy and didn't care that the line was backing up. They could have avoided it if they were productive front the start. \\nI'm sad to give up on this place. But I have it 2 chances. \\nI have no idea where it got 4 stars from.

Apps were hush puppies and fried green tomatoes. I lived in the South for 6 years and these were the best of both that I'd tasted. Dinner was fried chicken and brisket with a full side of cole slaw. Fried chicken IS worth the hype. Light, crunch, not greasy, boneless, melty in your mouth goodness. Mashed potatoes are rich with butter and light. Greens: meh. Not a greens fan. Brisket is delightful, especially when forked in my pie hole with a big scoop of cole slaw. Potato salad is full of bacony goodness. Dear Lord make it stop.

I chosen the chicken and ribs.You also get a choice of two sides with that.

My friend and I being only 2 of the latter barely made a dent in it, and each took home leftovers that lasted us each for two more full meals. It's really a great way to get an idea of the total repertoire, and comes with an entire pizza pan full of meat, and one full of sides. \\n\\nBaby back ribs, spare ribs, pulled pork, pulled brisket (on Texas Toast), two types of chicken wings (fried and honey glazed), a hot link, cole slaw, mac n' cheese, baked beans, collard greens, potato salad, rice & beans and cornbread w/ butter really rounded everything out. I was a little shell-shocked upon having it brought to the table, but everything was delicious. \\n\\nThe ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender, though the pulled pork may be the overall winner for me. Being able to access a line of BBQ sauces at the table made sampling them all way too easy. The cole slaw, potato salad and mac and cheese stood out as excellent sides, while the collard greens (which I don't know if I like in any context), baked beans (a bit heavy on the molasses) and rice and beans (just too carby) I would forgo the next time I come around. \\n\\nThe most gracious gentleman I have ever had as a server, he was attentive, had great timing, and a sense of humor.

Only good thing was we had a nice server, but he kept hinting how lucky we were not to have a reservation and still get in. \\n\\nSecond visit was for brunch, and service was ridiculous. They forgot put in person's order, there was three at the table, and the waitress brings over two plates. After we told her a plate was missing, she was trying to blame someone for her mistake.

The waitress acted like there was nothing wrong, like we were at fault or being complainers. Please.\\n\\nAt least before with Crocker you knew the food was going to be top notch.

Uncover the edible treasure of the tropics with our eclectic Caribbean fare and drinks. The Reef's menus sparkle with the potential of lunch, brunch and dinner plates inspired by the styles and tastes of the Caribbean. Menu selections showcase flavourful West Indian curries , served vegetarian or with a choice of chicken or goat. For dinner, the Kingston quesadilla envelops either jerk chicken or tofu, peppers, melty cheddar, and refried beans, and the coco prawns roll around in toasted coconut before putting on a cool minted avocado yoghurt ski-bunny costume.\\"\\n\\nAmbiance: \\"Vibrant colours, tropical plants, and kitschy signs bring you back to days spent skipping geometry in Caribbean boarding school, creating a casual, fun atmosphere for patron inhalation. The friendly and personable staff keeps the vibe upbeat, even when jerk seasonings rub off on the back-talking forks and napkins.\\"\\n\\nWhat I ordered: To start, we were offered a pail of delicious, fried bread, served with butter and spicy jerk sauce. Since being introduced to poutine at Local 360 less than two months prior, my husband was quick to jump on this appetizer! Under the Small Tings menu, we found Poutine (CAD$9), hand-cut kennebec fries with pulled jerk chicken or tofu, cheese curds & jerk gravy. Our dining companions selected the Tasting Platter ($24 for four), which included Chana salad (warm garam masala curried chickpea salad with organic greens, roti & dahi), plantain chips (crisp fried with jerk mayo), jerk wings (baked, not fried) and coco prawns (rolled in toasted coconut and served with a firecracker orange marmalade). For our main entrees, my husband and I shard the Jamaican Jerk Treasure For Two ($28) with jerk salmon (normally $16) and jerk beef (normally $15), served with rice n' peas and coleslaw.  Two of our dining companions enjoyed the Mo-Ca Burger ($14 each) with jerk seasoned 100% beef, grilled fresh pineapple, cheddar, jerk mayo & salsa. One of the wives chose the Saba Sub ($12), island spiced fried tilapia with crisp slaw, kaffir lime aioli & fresh tomato salsa, while the second among wives chose the Trini Roti ($11), chicken curry wrapped in a quick style West Indian flatbread, served with coleslaw. \\n\\nWhat I loved: Our appetizers! From the poutine, to the chana and the coco prawns to the plantain chips, everything was made even better with jerk mayo!\\n\\nWhy I loved it: Simple yet robust flavors, slightly sweeter than my tastebuds need, in a vibrant and colorful island-flared atmosphere.\\n\\nCost: Low to average ($10-$19 per entree)"},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Great hot dogs here.

I have mixed feelings about Hei La Moon...mostly negative, but I DO have a positive.\\n\\nFirst of all, the place was packed, but we were real lucky.  We went in around 1pm and it looked like the majority of the lunch crowd was gone and we were able to be seated within minutes.  Dim sum at this place goes until 3:30 so we had plenty of time to eat.\\n\\nWent to go to the restroom and it was FILTHY.  There was water all over the floor and it was just gross.  They must have a lot of foot traffic during lunch because I felt like I was crossing a small moat just to use the facilities.\\n\\nAs I got back to the table, I see that my family had already started getting food to the table.  Took a bite of the shrimp, pork, and shrimp & pork shumai and they were delish!  We had the pork buns, ha-gao, and dan-tat and they were just as delicious!  My family and I were so happy as we were munching on the food.  My mother wanted the Chinese broccoli so we ordered it from the waiter, but after 5, 10, 15 minutes, the broccoli didn't come out.  We finally flagged down one of the carts and asked for it.  It was really tasty.  We decided to order another one so we did again from the waiter because the cart lady disappeared.  Took them another 15 plus minutes to get that out as well.  It was really frustrating.  Our server looked miserable and the ladies that pushed the carts didn't speak a word of English.  That was also frustrating.  Whenever we wanted something, the lady would look at us and say \\"no\\" or \\"retire\\" and then we'd see it 10 minutes later in another cart.  So, the food was really good, but the service really stinks!\\n\\nAfter lunch, we asked for the check and it was a whopping $57 for 4 adults!  $65 if you include tip.  Half the awesomeness of dim sum is that it's cheap.  This was not cheap!  We were able to feed 5 adults for half that amount at a really good dim sum place in Southern California.  I expected better from Chinatown!\\n\\nWell, we left the restaurant feeling full, a little disappointed about the price and service, but happy with the taste of the meal.  Until an hour after...\\n\\nI had a huge headache, felt dehydrated, and had a stomach ache.  In fact, I still have a sensitive stomach and it's been about 8 hours since eating.  Found out why too.  My mom said that the food had a lot of MSG, which I now think I am incredibly allergic to.  So, for those that are sensitive to MSG, please beware before eating here!\\n\\nI know that many people state that all Chinese food has MSG, but I've eaten dim sum and not gotten sick after wards so I know that no or little MSG in Chinese food is possible.  Like I said in the beginning, the only thing that is a positive for this place is the brief deliciousness that it gave me while eating their food.  The service, MSG overkill, bathrooms, and price is what keep me from coming back."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The brisket and ribs here are to die for!

As far as portion sizes go, both dishes were seriously lacking in the main protein. But the halibut was perfectly cooked and seasoned. My cod and crab meat had almost no flavour even with the Dill Beurre Blanc, as I had to add salt and pepper to pull the dish together.

This one was my favorite - they kept it simple and true to the way it is done in Thailand.  You won't find it stuffed full of bamboo shoot filler like at other places (ugh).  This is chicken, onions, peppers, chili, basil, and sauce at its best.\\n\\nAnother dish I've sampled is the yellow curry.  Again, they killed it with large chunks of potato, carrots, and onions in a great sauce that is perfectly seasoned.

This was the only option, but it turned out to be a great one. We shared the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer, and had the pesto crusted salmon as a main course. Our portions were reasonable. The mushrooms came arranged very attractive y, I believe five in all, stuffed with a combination mostly focused on cheese. Which is not a problem for me.\\n\\nThe fish was simple, but cooked perfectly, and the pesto smeared on top was miles (or kilometers, I suppose) above anything you can buy in the store. Highly recommended.\\n\\nMore importantly, however, was the live music. The space is clearly focused on one thing- providing a venue for listening to local musicians while enjoying drinks and, if you'd like, some food. It accomplished that expertly. We did end up waiting a while to be served, but we were also there later than most of the dinner eating crowd and on an especially busy weekend. So I can't say how quick the service usually is. I will say the staff was polite and professional through and through. Just keep this in mind if you're in a hurry. The Heritage seems to be the type of place you go to spend time at, not to eat and run.

The meat is all smoked over applewood which gives it an amazing flavor and pink color. It was nicely seasoned and came with your choice of traditional BBQ sides (cole slaw, baked beans, mac&cheese) and a big square of inhouse made cornbread. The corn bread alone was enough to keep me coming back. That golden yellow fluffy gritty piece of heaven...\\n\\nNow the menu is a quarter the size it once was and the way the plates are made has changed. The way the meat is cooked hasn't changed much but everything is drowning in the house sauce. It's little more than ketchup and some spice. It actually tastes like watered down ketchup and some generic spices. \\n\\nMy favorite BBQ side is cole slaw. The old version was creamy a little loose and had a nice vinegar bite. The new one is mostly mayo with no flavor. Very disappointing. Another favorite in general is mashed sweet potatoes. I usually don't like them very sweet but some sugar in these would have been nice. I like the idea of using cream cheese to cream the potatoes but there comes a point where there's too much. These \\"sweet potatoes\\" taste like slightly sweet cream cheese that happens to be orange.\\n\\nNow to my favorite part of a Hoggy's meal: the corn bread. I only have two words for the new corn muffins: Jiffy mix.\\n\\nThe only good thing about my whole meal was the sweet tea. I love a good sweet tea.

I love cheese and I love any kind of fondue and this one didn't disappoint. The bread that it came with was delicious. It was a soft pretzely type of roll topped with shredded cheese (as if there wasn't already enough cheese involved). The fondue also came with apples, which were good to dip, but I would've been happy with more bread. We also got an order of the chicken wings. I'm not a huge chicken wings fan, but they were ok. They were served with a thai chili dipping sauce which tasted a little like italian dressing. Later, I ordered the cheese plate, which was really just brie covered with honey and served with an orange marmalade and bread. I didn't love the orange marmalade, but the cheese, bread, and honey was good. Boyfriend ordered the pieroghies. They were bland as most pieroghies seem to be. He requested no dill sour cream dipping sauce and so they substituted it with what looked like beet chutney. \\n\\nI also had thecoldwar for a drink. I mean, cinnamon toast crunch in a cocktail?

This would be my second time trying this place out and the food is always just okay. Although I will say the cocktails and ambiance are on point.   \\n\\nThis last time we went they had a Spanish/Portuguese chef in which we ordered the pomegranate brussel sprouts, squid in squid ink, olives, and the cheese plate. Brussels sprouts and olives were okay but the squid was more so fried vegetables in squid ink and the cheese plate was the saddest cheese plate one may ever come across. The cheeses were not well kept, but the presentation was a disaster - cheses were merely thrown on a plate with a hand full of cashews. \\n\\nI won't be dining here again but may return for a drink at the bar"},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Talk about tough decisions, ever had to choose between a BURGER and PIZZA?

This place is AMAZING, and the ONLY place in Boston I've found to have GOOD bbq:) I love the brisket sandwich, fried chicken (incredible) and I can't get enough of their mac 'n cheese. Ugh. SO good. Their sauces are hit or miss for me, I found one and stuck with it ever since (I think it was PitBoss, can't recall the name at the moment). I'm a darker beer drinker, but there's this Cider beer they serve that's really different - it's something you really should try!\\n\\nI love the wait staff here, they're attentive and really aim to please. \\n\\nCan't wait to go back!"},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I've eaten here and at the sister restaurant in Cabbagetown since moving to Atlanta eight years ago. The food has been consistently good but the service seems to have gone from inconsistent to reliably bad. I still remember my tour of duty in restaurant work so I tend to be extra forgiving of servers, especially when establishments are busy or obviously short staffed.\\n\\nThat said, Apr√®s Diem's decline in service seems at it's worst when things are slow. This past year I've had to physically wave down servers to order food or retrieve my check, and twice have had to leave my table and go searching for my server, who on both occasions could be found behind the counter chatting. I'm willing to put up with the occasional angsty put-upon attitude of some of the staff, but I think I've reached my limit with having to physically chase them down for a minimum of service."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"To be honest, I don't understand the obsession with this place.\\n\\nThe brisket was ok.  I had the traditional cut, that was good, but certainly not worth the wait.  The pulled pork was excellent.
