I did.  Maybe more so because I was close to eating my hand status on Friday night due to extreme hunger.  But, no, I am a Mexican food aficionado and this just didn't do it for me.  And, plus, I've been to the Hingham location and had a nice experience there a couple of years ago.\\n\\nFor starters, there's barely any room to breathe in this place.  The space is a little too teeny tiny.  I was with a party of 5 gals and we were told that a wait for a table would be about 20-25 minutes.  Fine, we were ready to get our marg on anyway.  We mosey'ed over to the bar, where I ordered a Patron margarita on the rocks/salt (It was pay day. Don't hate.)  I might as well have just ordered a glass of the lime mix instead... since that's all I could taste... probably would have saved me 9 bucks.\\n\\nThere seemed to have been a battle royale between the two servers on where my party was going to be seated.  We lost a table due to a phantom party of 6 that never arrived while we were dining.  So, that tacked on an additional 25 minutes to our wait.  We ordered some guacamole and chips at the bar, because it was close to cannibal time at that point if we didn't get something to eat.\\n\\nAlas, we were seated.  We ordered another round of beverages.  My 2nd Patron margarita was a better than the first... thankfully.  I ordered the steak tacos for my meal and they were just... okay.  The flavor was there, but some of the meat was a little on the tough side.  One of the other girls in my party got the chicken flautas for her meal.  They were so overdone in the fryer... your mouth was smacked with the taste of grease... practically unedible.  Since we were kind of in a rush to get to a birthday party Downtown, she just let it go and had one of my tacos to hold her over.\\n\\nThe reason why I didn't give this place a 1 was because the waitress we ultimately had was really great and super friendly.

Food was ok. Again, like with the beers, nothing any better than somewhere else with less hassle. While we were sitting there we could clearly hear employees talking about all the lawsuits against Bangers by former employees (i guess that's why there has always been training employees waiting on me).

Not too rich, although you would think so.  The little tiny orzo pasta lures you into a false sense of security while you are eating this blatantly over-the-top dish.  It was delicious!  Creamy!  Lobstery!  The lobster was cooked perfectly.  The cheese sauce with the truffle oil was sublime.  Not one off note to be found in this dish.  The sprinkling of sprouts on top (or was it baby 4-leaf clovers, how cute!) was the final masterpiece touch on the artistic creation.  And that was just my hubby's dish.  \\n\\nI got the duck and waffle combo.  Whoa - can't. eat. rest. of. day.  But heck, I could not put down my fork!  The waffle was crisp, round, fluffy and somehow it was HOT.  It's so hard to keep a waffle hot.  Served with (gasp) greens that were chock full of plump & crispy lardons, yes I know it sounds bizarre, with a luscious leg of duck confit on top, this was easily the most unique dish I've tasted in Portland.  Greens on a waffle?  YES!  Duck and syrup?  YES!  Greens and duck, of course!  Every mouthful was a different experience of tastes and textures.  And the waffle actually held up to my exorbitant amounts of this incredible house-made HONEY-BUTTER SYRUP (it tastes like brown sugar caramel with butter, only thin for ease of pour-age).  So by the time the fall-off-the-bone duck was consumed in 5 or 6 bites with greens and some of the waffle, I had half a waffle left for (ahem) dessert!  \\n\\nBy the time we were done, and we both cleaned our plates, I was planning my next visit.

Luckily we had someone who came here recently and she knew what the steps were (otherwise we'd be faffing about for who knows how long).  \\nCourse 1 was slices of beef that came over a burner with a sauce mixture involving vinegar.  You cook the beef in the sauce (until well browned) and eat as is or in a wrap.\\nCourse 2 was similar to the first but prepared in melted butter (everything tastes better in butter!)\\nCourse 3 was slices of raw marinated beef.  This cut is meant to be eaten raw to capture the essence of the beef.\\nCourse 4, 5 and 6 came in one plate and consisted of a series of beef skewers, each prepared differently. Some were marinated, some were in a leaf wrap and the final was a steamed ground beef which was full of flavor (my favorite of the three). \\nCourse 7 consisted of a congee infused with beef and other assorted spices.  Very aromatic.\\n\\nAdditionally we got fried catfish which was undoubtedly the highlight of the meal.  The skin was crispy and the meat was very tender!

It was our first time in Portland, so naturally, I hit up Yelp to find us some good eating. \\n\\nThere we SO many good options with some very high star ratings. I opted to see what a \\"Dineraunt\\" was, seeing as I'd never heard the term before. \\n\\nWalking into The Original I automatically got diner and restaurant. It was like two bodies of the culinary world smashing together to make a diner that felt modern. The indoor succulent garden is a very nice touch. The huge windows and the dark colors made this a supremely wonderful space.\\n\\nOur waiter was this wonderful tall lighter-shade-of-brown with dreads. He was super polite and very attentive throughout the night. When I asked him what he thought were the best plates of the house. He gave us two informed answers, neither of which I chose, but that's not the point. He knew what he was talking about and he had a certain conviction about him. Anyways, really nice guy.\\n\\nSo the three of us got the following: the doughnut sliders, poutine, creme brulee french toast, and the fried chicken with braised greens. The doughnut sliders were good. I wasn't writing home about them but they were good. Beef and sweet pillowy doughnut buns can't ever be bad. The poutine wan't really poutine. There was no gravy, no cheese curds, it looked like cheddar on fries. I was mostly unimpressed. I mean, I'm from CA. OR is closer to Canada than CA, and even CA has better poutine that this place put forth. The creme brulee french toast was basically perfect if you like sweeter things. The torched sugar lends the perfect amount of bitter to the obviously sweet creme brulee base. It was pretty fantastic. The sausages on the plate played a sad second fiddle to the majesty that was the french toast. The fried chicken and the greens (which was one of 5 sides you got to choose from) was the juiciest piece of chicken I think I've ever tasted. The skin was crispy to a fault and the meat tender, juicy and super flavorful and boneless BONELESS perfect fried chicken -- did mention juicy?! The greens, I'd give a solid \\"B\\", but that's only because I can make them myself and prefer my own/my family's recipe. The chicken came with a dipping sauce that was complimentary but not necessary. This is likely due to the fact that I'm a fried chicken purist.\\n\\nIf I ever go back to Portland, I'll definitely be making a stop at The Original. Everything on the menu was something I wanted to try, its unfortunate that there were only three of us and that we were going out afterward (can't go out looking like a moose). I give top marks for the service. I think the food was superb - definitely a perfect mix between restaurant and diner and its central downtown location and decor/ambiance was top notch. \\n\\nMy inner foodie rejoices.

We then had a waiter switch - Geoffrey. \\n\\nWe asked Geoffrey what our neighbors to the right were drinking it looked like a delicious mango martini. He said \\"Oh I can get you a drink menu!\\" We were confused to say the least. \\n\\nDrinks: I went for the Okanogan Black Ale. Rich and malty. Good dark beer. After that I switched to the lighter \\"Flirtini\\" which was Champagne, Vodka, and Pineapple Juice. 'Twas quite strong and def made more inclined to flirt!\\n\\nAppetizer: We had the Roasted Garlic Bulbs. Which the name is deceiving. You don't get the bulbs. You get 10 crostinis slathered with goat cheese and a few cloves of roasted garlic. I was expecting to get a few whole bulbs. A bit of a letdown.\\n\\nDinner: I had the pan seared salmon salad over spinach with cherry tomatoes, mangoes, asparagus with a whole grain mustard sauce. It was good but I wanted more dressing. \\n\\nAtmosphere: the ambiance in the pavilion is great - love the hanging Christmas lights and the live music. They played a cover of Imagine which was great. However, I wish there were more fans outside! It's Texas afterall and the overhead fans didn't do much and the large fan in the corner wasn't doing much either.

Amazingly fresh ingredients, a fair amount of meat even including some crispy (yes, crispy) skin, and the soup was not too loaded with salt (as it the case with most Asian restaurant soups.)  We also ordered 2 chicken curries (took one home), chicken rolls, and a slice grilled pork dish with 2 deliciously spices sauces. (They'll ask which sauces you'd like to try.)

Noodles are my FAVORITE dish, and I'll never get tired of eating them. But I do have preferences...and Du Kuh Bee fulfills my kind of favorite noodle exactly.\\n\\nDKB doesn't have a huge selection, and in fact is a very small restaurant with a small open kitchen (it's fun watching the guy making noodles, and the huge flame cooking my noodle dish on the stove), but THOSE NOODLES ARE AMAZING. They're thick, just as I like it, because it makes them chewier. Perfect consistency. There's only one other hand-pulled homemade noodles place I like, and it's in my hometown of San Jose, California (TsingTao, if you ever head down that way). I'm so glad I've found a place up here that measures up, and actually exceeds, because I love a mix of Chinese and Korean food.\\n\\nAnyways, enough raving about the noodles. My family ordered shrimp noodles, jjajangmyun, kalbi, and beef with rice cake. Everything was pretty good, but the best dish hands down was definitely the shrimp noodles. The kalbi was really good as well - super tender beef on bone in a perfect marinade. The jjajangmyun wasn't the best I'd ever had, it was actually somewhat bland and didn't have much flavor, and the meat wasn't much to rave about, but it wasn't bad either. I still enjoyed eating it. The beef with rice cake (which is not in the menu, it was a special item with a picture hanging over the bar) was a little too much on the sweet side for me, but I love rice cakes so I also still enjoyed eating it.\\n\\nI loved the noodles so much that I ordered an extra veggie noodles to go for my dinner tomorrow. Turns out it's actually something like kimchi fried rice, but with noodles. I think on all the noodle dishes they'll also ask you what level of spiciness you want. Medium is perfect for me, since I don't eat spicy foods that often anymore (so my tongue receptor's aren't conditioned yet) but I still like that little kick. We got mild on the shrimp noodles because one person in our group rarely eats spicy foods, and it was still really good. I decided to go medium on my take-out, and it's good too.\\n\\nI'm definitely taking anyone that visits me in Portland to this place, and we'll definitely get the noodles and kalbi again. Maybe try the bulgogi too.\\n\\nBeware, closed on Sundays!

For one, the Atlanta location is in a hotel (and not just in a hotel, but the top of the restaurant is open so you can see everything that's going on in the hotel and everyone's rooms). Normally this might be a nice feature but the hotel is not that great looking and therefore I would have preferred if the top of the restaurant was closed off to the rest of the hotel. Also to note is that they don't have their own bathrooms so you literally have to walk out of the restaurant and use the hotel's bathrooms next to the pool - what an awful inconvenience and not something I would've expected of a place like Ruth's Chris. The NJ location was enclosed, the waiters more poised, and just all around felt like a fancier place. \\n\\nNow onto the actual dinner experience - this time around I was dressed up and so was my husband (because if you're paying 120 for a meal, you want to at least make it a dressy date). Something I appreciated (and what helped this review become 3 stars and not 2) was that the hostess made sure to change our dinner napkins to black ones rather than white ones since I was wearing a black dress and my husband was wearing black slacks. I've always appreciated this as the white napkins sometimes leave white marks on your black skirt/dress depending on the material. So we got seated and ordered the \\"jumbo\\" scallops, i ordered the petite steak medium, my husband ordered the ny strip steak medium rare, and we got sides of creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes. When we got the appetizer (which was 16 dollars btw), we were sort of disappointed - these were not jumbo scallops at all! They were more like baby scallops! They were okay, but again, not the best I have ever had and for 16 dollars, they better have been amazing. The steaks were okay, my husband's steak came a little more cooked than he would've liked and I thought mine was fine. The sides were a bit disappointing and I didn't think either was worth the 9 dollar price tag. \\n\\nI think the biggest disappointment was that for this price tag, Ruth's Chris should not only be selling good food but should be also selling a good experience, and I feel like we got shafted on both ends (more so on the good experience). The reason being - this location is just not a romantic set-up as it is in a hotel and open to the hotel. Additionally, when I looked around I noticed that there was no dress code for this place - people were walking around in beach wear, shorts, t-shirts, etc, which made me feel like I was just in another Outback Steakhouse. \\n\\nI love their bread pudding but that's probably the only thing I'd come back here for. The Capital Grille in Atlanta is MUCH more romantic (with a great view to boot) if you want to spend money on a good steak dinner."},{"name":"Taco Mac 790 Zone Hawks","address":"100 Centennial Olympic Park Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Fries was super stale, and let's just say that Wendy's has better burgers.

Ours was much higher than that of course. Before we went, my wife looked up the dress code/attire for this restaurant, and it stated business casual. However, upon arriving, we noticed immediately that there were people who arrived in shorts and flip flops. I was a little upset that I had to walk through the Atlanta heat all dressed up when I could've dressed more relaxed and comfortable. But since I was on a date, I guess it's a moot point.\\n\\nThe food was also not quite at the 5 star level that I expected. We ordered jumbo scallops as appetizers, which really sounded good on paper. However, it should have more appropriately been named baby scallops, as we only got 3 small pieces for $16! Big mistake. We also ordered two side items, neither of which was worth the price we paid for them.\\n\\nAs for the steak, I ordered mine medium rare. But there was no question the temperature I received was well above what I ordered. Add that to the fact that the plates are placed in the oven with the steak and thus are sizzling hot and continues to cook the steak while it's at the table, I was less than pleased that I had a well-done steak before all was said and done. I would've sent it back to the kitchen, but it pains me to know that a perfectly edible steak would be thrown away, and I was also starving at that point.

As you can probably expect during Restaurant Week, the place was just about packed, and it was about 6:30.\\n\\nHowever, the tables near the bar were wide open, which was great, because we were taking part in Happy Hour anyway.  Let's face it: good appetizers for $6, and if you can find a place with Boddington's on tap (not to mention for $2.95 a pint), you're doing well.\\n\\nMy choice for an appetizer was the Calamari Fritti, which is served with a graham cracker dusting and a side of bourbon barbecue sauce.  It was a pleasure to the senses that not only smelled terrific, but had awesome flavor, especially with the addition of that sauce.  I grabbed a couple bites of the Mrs.' grilled (to perfection) asparagus as well, but I'll let her tell you about her own meal.\\n\\nAs for the Restaurant Week Prix Fixe menu, I grabbed the excellent House Salad (with poached pears, toasted pecans and a gorgonzola vinaigrette) for first course, before proceeding to the Salt and Vinegar Chip Crusted Lake Erie Walleye, served with shrimp salad, and over crisp green beans and spicy Tabasco mashed potatoes and a shiitake butter sauce.  The walleye itself was excellent -- a generous-sized filet, and that chip crust added just the right tang to a very flavorful dish.\\n\\nNow with such delicious-sounding options for dessert, I suppose my choosing the one involving Jeni's Ice Cream is a tad predictable (and I suppose not very adventurous of me), but YOU tell ME, would you turn down a Summer Fruit and Berry Crisp featuring Jeni's Honey Vanilla Bean?

We ordered wakame salad, a nigiri platter, saba inferno, a Philadelphia roll, and udon...nothing complicated to make. My partner and I waited half an hour before my udon was brought to us...before the appetizer (wakame salad) which is literally putting some pre-cut up seaweed in the plate and serve. When I complained, they brought the wakame salad, it hadn't even been completed defrosted yet! We waited yet another 10-15 minutes before another dish was brought to us. Then we had to keep waiting for another. Overall, we waited over an hour before our food slowly trickled in from the kitchen. The food quality is also just average: you can probably just order the same things from any of the other sushi restaurants around the area to be delivered there, and it would still have been faster. They also don't provide you with drinks or anything while you wait. A cup of hot green tea, which would be free in other restaurants, costs $1.50 here, and the food is also generally more expensive.

I enjoy Ruth Chris, in any city or any state it's is always consistent. This one was different. Blame it on the weather. It had to be 25and the wind was blowing and stronger chill. To make matters exceptional the restaurant was located inside of a hotel. Like an adjoining structure. The building itself had a mezzanine area that was open and drafty. although the restaurant had its own entrance and door way the cold from outside had a direct pathway into the restaurant. It affected the entire experience! I was seated in an area that was inline with the draft but could not notice it at first as a guest who was seated by the Maitre D- thinking I was protected from the cold as I watched more patrons come inside and immediately asked to be reseated- away from the draft. Well, once the food was ordered I then inquired about the temperature. It turns out the waiter stated that the central  heater was not functional. So with that being said, the entire dinner was cold. I found myself eating at a faster pace to contain the heat but then figured that was not in my best interest. I made an inquiry about just closing the door from where the draft was traveling and it was closed for 15 seconds- as the waiters found it convenient possibly from learned behavior to enter through the draft filled entrance/exit, with other optional doors to use for service. No matter where you sat in this location without heat, it was cold. So the experience was not connected to price or service, there was obvious a disconnect. I felt void when I left to be honest.  I waitress was apologetic but the issue was not resolved. \\nThe presentation was nice though. When the food arrived it was traditionally the \\"Ruth Chris\\" fashion- sizzling plates with the aroma of perfectly cooked choices on the platter. But once that cold settled in on my choices. The sizzling came to a halt- the wine glasses stopped their chimes as the place grew dim from the what was before me to how I felt inside, cold, hungry and unfulfilled.

Also the mango lemonade is good I watered it down since it was a bit sweet for me but with lots of ice it was delicious."},{"name":"Fresa's - South 1st","address":"1703 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Solid food and one of my favorite happy hours in Austin, sad it took me so long to finally try!!\\n\\nThe reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I don't really see myself going often unless it's during happy hour (M-F 3-6pm). The food could also be a little more hot when served. It's a turn off for me when food is served lukewarm. \\n\\nHighlights: get their aquas frescas, sooo good. I tried the watermelon, but I wanted to try all the flavors. SO cheap during happy hour. I did enjoy my powerbol with chicken and veggies, although it was just a little on the salty sad.

I am so glad I had that coupon; otherwise, I'd be even more disappointed with my experience.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE - I have no idea why people like the ambiance of this place.  First off, it's an open dining room with high ceilings, plaster walls and wooden floors.  Without any fabric to absorb sound, it was horribly noisy.  There was also a bar area that mimics a sports bar with its large television screens.  When I hear \\"rustic,\\" it makes me think of an environment full of warmth and quaintness.  Everything about this place felt cheap and cold, which was completely discordant with the price point.  Don't take a date here, you won't hear a word he/she says.\\n\\nSERVICE - It was acceptable.  Nothing to gripe about but nothing to rave about either.\\n\\nFOOD - The food actually wasn't bad but hardly good.\\n\\nOysters - I had a 1/2 dozen of Wellfleets, which were of good quality.  It was served with a balsamic mignonette, which was lovely with its hint of sweetness.  It was also served with tzatziki, which I've never had with oysters before and now I know why.  It completely ruined the oyster.\\n\\nFig preserve pizza - This was the best dish of the evening.  It was essentially a flat bread with fig preserve, goat cheese, prosciutto, arugala, and caramelized onions.  The caramelized onions were a little too sweet and overwhelmed the other flavours.  I also wondered whether blue cheese would have worked better than the goat cheese.  Overall, it was delicious.\\n\\nPan roasted long island duck breast - Overall, the dish was underseasoned.  I'm not sure what the Madiera cream sauce was all about but it had no flavour.  The duck breast was also cut into 4 large chunks, which made the dish lacking in delicacy.  On the plus side, I asked for it medium and it came out perfectly medium. \\n\\nPrime rib - This was the special of the day.  It was a prime rib with tomato salad on top (a little strange) and a side of sweet potato fries.  The prime rib wasn't rich in beef flavour.  In fact, the whole dish was once again underseasoned.  We had to ask for a side of steak sauce, which is not something we routinely do.  You shouldn't need it if you have a great cut of meat.\\n\\nI thought the food was alright with the highlight of the evening being the fig pizza.  However, there is something so \\"fast food\\" about the environment that I found it extremely irritating.  The atmosphere felt like a mildly elevated Bertucci's.

When you first walk in, it's a little confusing because you wonder if you just walk in or wait for a server. In this case, you just walk in to where they're grilling the food and the server will come out and tell you where to sit.\\n\\nOrdering was fun, I like everything but I was in the mood for some squid that night. I looked at the steamed or grilled squid and asked the server what was good squid. He answered nicely and said instead of steamed or grilled, which happened to only be appetizers, he suggested either the pan-fried squid or the squid with noodles. I am very picky with my noodles, so I chose the pan-fried squid and my boyfriend chose BBQ Chicken.\\n\\nThey came out with Kimchee and Radishes right away to curb your hunger if you're really hungry and need some early crunchy snacks. Their kimchee was pretty good! Definitely had the slightly fermented taste, hehe. The Radishes were the bomb, I love radishes though, so I may be biased.\\n\\nThe water comes in cute little bottles that you pour yourself so you don't have to wait on the server. There's a couple of plates, two pairs of chopsticks, and a couple of napkins laying in the middle of the table for us. Depending on what you get will decide if you use the plate or not.\\n\\nSo the food came out and boyy did it look wonderful! The best part was that it tasted wonderful as well! I will never forget how delicious the squid was or how surprisingly yummy the BBQ chicken was. It seems like they do well in all dishes!\\n\\nThey also give you unlimited white rice, which is a huge plus for those who eat a couple to a few bowls like me. The portions are quite large as well. I couldn't even finish my squid! Mainly because I kept eating my boyfriend's BBQ chicken too, haha.\\n\\nAnyways, all in all, this restaurant is definitely worth checking out!

I'm not sure if they're supposed to come with one, and I didn't know whether the order was for me--but then again, the staff didn't either. I was too hungry to care so I didn't ask.\\n\\nThe pizza itself tasted good but hadn't been warmed all the way through. The garlic knot was about what you'd expect from a garlic knot--chewy, full of garlic flavor--except that it was also cold.\\n\\nIf the restaurant were at least a nice place to relax while eating, it wouldn't be so bad. But the club next door was playing music so loudly that the floor and walls of the restaurant were shaking.\\n\\nThe price for my slice of cold pizza, garlic knot, and a small Coke? Over $6.\\n\\nI guess the security guards need to get paid too."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Draught Emporium","address":"815 W 47th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great atmosphere, good booze, fun staff- favorite server is Katie!

First, we didn't have a reservation and went on a whim. I thought we would for sure end up at the bar or waiting but they had a table for us! From the outside of the little shopping strip the restaurant is located in, the shop seems like it would be much smaller. But it feels spacious due the higher ceilings and has a fun interior. The front of the store houses the butcher which I will definitely have to be back to hit up (they had a tasty looking tri tip and an aged porterhouse in the cooler case that looked good. Plus schmaltz and lard which I've been trying to find recently!).  Our server was nice enough to explain the menu for us since it was our first time. We weren't drinking that night, so we ordered the Cara Cara orange shrub and ginger lemonade for drinks. If their non-alcoholics drinks were as tasty as those I can only imagine how good the cocktails are. We decided on the sweet and sour fried oysters and giant beef rib.  The oysters were deliciously crisp and the accompanying sauce was flavorful without overpowering the oysters. The best thing ever was the beef rib! Holy cow that thing is massive.  And delicious. Like fall off the bone tender with lots of smokey flavor. The accompanying potatoes were good too.   I'm glad the server told us the beef rib easily feeds 2-3 people because we would've ordered more and the beef rib alone left us stuffed. \\n In summary, the beef rib is amaze-balls.

They may even need to be removed from my beer list.  Douchebaggery abounds at the Saucer.  The scantily clad waitresses flock to tables of guys, utterly ignoring women, some of whom (like myself) have more beer knowledge than a lot of men.  I've waited to update my review for a couple of visits after the initial representation of said discrimination... but I can hold my tongue no longer.  Upon my last visit, immediately after sitting down, the waitress approached me, saying nothing at all.  I had to tell her to give me a minute.  That minute turned into five or ten, with her returning upon the arrival of my partner.  Suddenly, she was all cheery, flirtatious, and nice.  A table of guys sat behind us and she immediately and happily greeted them, as well... even joking with them a bit.  Beers took forever to arrive and they were no longer serving food!  On one of my first visits, we were told that food was served until the place closed or until at least midnight.  Well, apparently not anymore... or on this particular Tuesday.  UGH!  Also, flaky bartender kept changing the music mid song and making stupid, inside joke (I guess) announcements on the intercom.\\n\\nThey lost 2 stars for my past few experiences.  Jerks.\\n\\n*****  Original review  *****\\nSure, this place is a chain, but it's a pretty effing cool chain!  Minus one star for that.\\n\\nYou can join the UFO club for coughing up $14 and you get a pretty sweet (mine's American Apparel) t-shirt and prizes as you accumulate beers and your way to the wall of fame after 200.  You get something with every 50 beers, having been a member of the UFO club for a little over a year now (there's one in San Antonio), I'm at like 13 or something... because they only let you add three per trip.\\n\\nAs Captain Obvious would say, they have A LOT of beer.  I mean, if there's enough beer to have this UFO club, that means they have AT LEAST 200, right?  Actually, that's including rotated seasonal beers.  Now, onto the review.\\n\\nCame here for lunch today (I'm sad to see that I'm not the first \\"real\\" reviewer) as my partner and I have been stalking this place to gain review cred.  Today also happened to be \\"Pint Night,\\" so a pint is a mere $2.50!  This made my currently unemployed ass jump for joy, an exuberant giggle may have escaped my mouth upon seeing the sign!  For the record, as well, Monday is pint night.  Tuesday is \\"Fire night,\\" when a specific beer is $2.50 and is also trivia night.  Wednesday is \\"Keep the Glass\\" night.  I don't think there's specials on weekends, and I can't recall Thursday beer special, either.\\n\\nWaitresses are attired in short plaid skirts, aprons, and knee highs... I suppose adding to the \\"sex appeal\\" factor of the place (like 200+ beers doesn't take care of that already).  We walked in, expecting a pretty empty place, and I was slightly surprised to see a handful of patrons.  We sat at a booth by the window and were greeted pretty quickly.  It was difficult, with the sensory overload and all, to get completely situated with what we wanted to eat AND which of the plethora of beers to choose from, but our waitress was very patient and came back enough times to finally get our order.  I had a salad, partner had a chicken philly.  I, of course, had to get a beer, too.  I opted for a St. Arnold's Amber... just because it was one I KNEW wasn't on my UFO list... and the computer wasn't running properly for me to check.  Salad was tasty and well presented on a funky rectangular plate.  The philly looked and tasted good, but didn't seem to me that it would be very filling.  Overall service was great, she seemed very knowledgeable about her beers and she was pretty friendly.\\n\\nAtmosphere was pretty cool, too.  The area away from the entry door is very lounge-ish complete with comfy couches.  The walls are decorated with decorative plates, kinda like the ones your grandma/aunt/crazy neighbor collects.  There's obvious space at the top of the wall for the wall of fame, too.  There are also a couple dartboards near the bar and frisbees on the ceiling.  Seems like an outdoor patio is pending, as well.  I noticed 3 televisions, showing CNN, FoxNews(ugh), and ESPN... all in high definition!  Whoo hoo!  Also, free wifi... seriously, what century are places in that DON'T have wifi anymore?!\\n\\nI'll be back for the beer, and maybe the bar food.

It's a running joke to see how many days we can make the leftovers last before we have to come back for more, because the containers they give allow enough food for 2-4 meals.  \\n\\nAnd the food!  The spicing of each individual dish, and the varied preparation methods, are incredible.  Indian food is so fabulous because of the variety and depth of the flavorings.  At Maanas, they really bring out the special quality of each dish.  If you want to wander away from the tried and true chicken tikka masala path, Maanas is the place to do it!  Just be aware that although you can choose heat levels when ordering off the menu, on the buffet almost every dish is a... challenging ... level of heat.  Not obnoxious, but you will definitely be sniffling midway through your meal.\\n\\nMaanas offers many options for vegetarians.  The kadai mushroom is a great masala with tomato and onion.  They also sometimes have a pan-fried potato dish with spices and pan-seared lentils, which lend a crunchy and nutty touch to the dish.  Similarly they sometimes have a wonderful carrot and onion fry.  The Andhra Chicken is great, as well as the masalas they do with goat and mutton.  I don't know why people in past reviews have complained about the chicken biryani, we get it regularly, and the entire dish is flavorful, with turmeric-flavored and colored rice, and generous helpings of chicken coated with a thick layer of spices obviously marinated and baked on.  The tandoori chicken is tender and moist.  And I usually fill up half of my container with the wonderful veggie pakora, which are battered and deep-fried shredded veggies, usually carrot, onion, cabbage, and hot pepper mixed.  \\n\\nAnd do not skip the carrot halwa for dessert!

For my side, instead of french fries I asked if I could have poutine & the server was very accommodating and was totally ok with that.  The poutine wasn't true poutine so it was disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, the poutine was good but it wasn't real poutine with the white cheddar curds.  The Original's version was cheddar cheese, gravy & fries...something I can make myself. \\n\\nMy sister let me taste her deluxe bacon burger and I have to admit, the burger was good compared to my hot dog. I would definitely recommend eating a burger instead.  For dessert, we all shared a white chocolate pistachio cake which was the highlight of my dinner...delicious but sad!! \\n\\nThe place was a cute retro place and all the servers we nice & accommodating.

I must admit though that I love the indirect lighting here and the service is actually pretty awesome considering how super duper busy they were.  Now let's talk about the food.  They literally have so many things on the buffet that you would seriously not be able to imagine they could handle making all of these things and keep them stocked up, but they do.  They have everything from macncheese, migas, tomato basil pie, herb cucumber yogurt salad, bacon, sausage, slow cooked chicken and pork dishes, to fresh granola and fruit with yogurt, pastries, steamed veggies, and even zucchini bread!

It's an avocado half with wasabi viniagrette (hello taste bud explosion) on a bed of shaved onions with a lemon wedge.  You have to have to have to get this!  I'm an avocado lover by nature, but this pushed it to a whole new level of lurve.  We also started (I say started very very loosely as we ordered enough food for a whole table) with the edamame (salted perfectly), shishitou peppers, and the miso soup.  Next we ordered spicy tuna crunchy rice, salmon sashimi, yelllowtail jalapeno (always one of my personal favs and did not disappoint), black cod misoyaki, unagi nigiri, kobe beef nigiri (MELT IN MY MOUTH DELICIOUS!).  Then.... our lives changed forever... stay with me and keep reading.\\n\\nLet me expand on why I would sit at the sushi bar again.  There was a gentleman next to us who had clients from Japan in town, and he had previously lived in Japan.  They were all LOVING this place!  They didn't order from the menu, and just told the sushi chef's to give them anything and keep it coming.  They defninitely had the right idea, just sayin.  The gentleman asked us if we had tried Uni, and said the Uni was amazing here.  Neither of us had Uni before so one of the sushi chefs gave us each a small bite (everyone said it was an acquired taste=I was intrigued), and said if we liked it, then we could order a normal order.  Did I like it?!  Me no likey, me lovey!!!!  I said my life changed, didn't I???  Without having to say it, we ordered more Uni.  The Uni at Umi is uh-maz-ing!!!!!  Then, we started talking to Alex, one of the sushi chefs, and we asked him to just make us one of his favs.  What he made us, I'm not totally sure, but what I do know is that it was literally one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!

And, in fact.... right smack dab middle of the line. The establishment is heavy into catering, but in terms of a true 'cue experience, it probably shouldn't be had smack dab in the middle of downtown.\\n\\nA lack of appeal may certainly have contributed to my mediocre experience, but I did very much enjoy how they catered to my taste. I asked for a beef sandwich (which, by the way, is a little pricey at $6.50) and put in my preference for \\"burnt ends, if possible.\\" Half of my 1/3 lb. (?) sammie was purely burnt ends. Awesome.\\n\\nThe burnt ends themselves had that crusty, beefy, salty char, but they actual meaty portions could not hold a candle to the other portions.

Inside, though, it feels like a secret cave tucked away downtown. High ceilings (higher than the exterior roofline might seem to permit), dark wood, nice breezes, pleasant staff, a nice hustle and bustle. It's big. There are multiple sections, both within and without a huge pergola-like wooden structure, and more tables out on the sidewalks. \\n\\nThere's dark wood everywhere, and sometimes you're at a table with chairs, sometimes with padded benches. There are high old paned warehouse windows along two walls, and a huge bar, and gleaming copper kettles. Gorgeous. \\n\\nThe service is friendly, and the food is good if I remember correctly. On this visit we opted for coffee and lemonade (both delicious, both strong) and the house ginger ale, which tasted like real ginger and made you wonder why you would ever buy factory ginger ale made from concentrate with chemicals. Delectable.\\n\\nThe beer here is amazing as well, ranging from the best mainstream lineup of everyday beers in the northwest to a series of very credible special releases ranging across a wide variety of styles. The scale of this company is getting very large, but they're still doing things pretty much all the way right from what I can see, even if it's all getting a little too outsized to feel personal anymore.

I've never seen a group of people so courteous and genuinely welcoming. Following that, the food is pretty standard chain-restaurant style. The oysters and seafood are extremely fresh, but they piled a lot of unnecessary ingredients onto the oysters. Too much vinaigrette actually overpowered the oysters themselves, to the point I had to wipe my oyster clean. They do have other creative appetizers like the smoked salmon on ultra crispy hash browns with cheese and their coffee is fantastic. Another flaw is that the food tend to be a bit too heavy, as in too buttery and too oily. Through my entire 3 course dinner, I grew too sick to eat anymore.

Throughout the course of the night, we heard nothing but tray after tray of glasses/drinks crashing to the floor...I'm sure half of those spills were due to the poor servers having to go up two flights of stairs with full trays of drinks and having to navigate through their very packed restaurant.\\nAnyway, we watched about 2-3 groups (ranging in size from 3 people to 6+ people) come down to the bar and get subsequently called for their table within 10 minutes.  This was after waiting a good half hour for our table!  No one came down to check in with us or give us an update.  After we checked in upstairs, we were told it would be another 10 minutes..no apology, no explanation, no offer of an appetizer to tide us over.   15 more minutes went by and we watched another couple of groups come downstairs and get called to their tables!  We checked in again and were told they were cleaning our table...again, no apology, no offer to buy us another round of drinks, nothing. FINALLY, after waiting an hour for our RESERVATION, we were seated.  Our server was personable enough, if not a little pushy, but at least he brought our anger level down a notch.  \\n\\nWe got a bunch of sushi rolls, some tempura, and a couple of appetizers to share.

If I'm the least bit cranky or not in the mood to drink much, this certainly isn't my go-to spot because they simply do not know how to turn people away. They want to milk that $5 cover for all it's worth, no matter how on top of each other everyone is.

Indeed. They usually have an awesome band playing great renditions of top-40 type stuff that's perfect to dance to (if you like that sorta thing). I'm not into the radio but I'll never be above dancing my socks off to such a band.\\n\\nAlso, I'm a frequent pee-er, so the many-stalled bathrooms are perfect =)\\n\\nThey have a good size bar with surprisingly friendly bartenders, and at $5 a Blue Moon, most of the prices ain't bad.

Seating is a bit tight but I loved the ambiance with the dim lighting. Service was alright even though we were using a Social Shopper.\\n\\nOn Friday nights, they have select pints for $5. We chose the Phillips Blue Buck Ale since we like lighter beers. I noticed that they ended up charging us $6 (their regular price) but I didn't want to fuss about the $1 difference since we were already using a Social Shopper voucher.\\n\\nThe American Feast for 2 comes with all of the following items I'll mention. First were the Fried Dill Pickles which was served with a cajun aioli. These were lightly battered and had a nice crunch. I did find them a little too sour but they were good when eaten between the meats.\\n\\nNext up were the Hush Puppies and Corn Bread which were served with a honey butter. These were still warm and I quite enjoyed the hush puppies as they were not too dense.\\n\\nThe main platter of the American Feast for 2 is more than enough food for two. This included two Smoked Chicken Legs and Thighs which had a nice barbecue flavour to it, but the meat was a little dry. In the middle was the Pulled Pork Sandwich featuring a Portuguese bun filled with a ton of pulled pork and sauce. It was odd that only one burger came and that it wasn't cut in half for sharing. S and I really enjoyed the burger though as it was very flavourful and the meat was moist. However, the sauce was very wet so the bun became soggy. On the far right were St. Louis Pork Ribs. The meat was extremely tender and fell right off the bone. Flavourwise, it was rather bland. It needed the help of the homemade BBQ sauce to make it right. For sides, my favourite were the  Kennebec Fries. They were not the crispiest, but when dipped in their homemade ketchup, they were amazing! The ketchup had a bit of an onion flavour to it. The Navy Beans reminded me of chili as they were smokey and not your boring canned ketchup beans. Not bad, but again, they were rather dry. The Dijon Aioli Slaw was underwhelming and we didn't end up finishing it.\\n\\nOverall, we were quite happy with Buckstop. There are some hits and misses but overall we didn't have too many complaints. Plus I really enjoyed their homemade sauces and most of their meats were tender.

Service was good and baklava was sitting within easy reach on the counter to tempt the easily influenced.  The gyro combo and baklava were definitely good enough for an encore, however a few tweaks would really help push them over the top:  the gyro was a bit small and a bit dry.  It could have used a bit more seasoning.  The potatoes, cut in half-circles about 1/8 inch thick, were nicely seasoned and I really liked the Greek sauce, but they would have been better if they had not sat around as long as they did.  The baklava seemed a bit sandy in texture, but tasted quite good, without being cloyingly sweet.  Again, these were not major complaints, but little things that stood in the way of good food being really great."},{"name":"Cucinova","address":"7721 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is an amazing pizza place.

My only complaint is that the ice cream gets very melted very quickly, and ice cream soup isn't the greatest thing. Maybe it was the heat? I did eat it outside. Noted. \\n\\nI love the thin mint milkshake, it's my favorite one! It contains mint chocolate chip & vanilla ice creams (I presume to cut down on the mint intensity for how big it is, but it works out fine) with Oreos! When I'm feeling a little bit naughty when it comes to desserts, that's what I do. If the menu milkshakes don't do anything for you, you can make a custom milkshake of your own. Choose your own adventure! \\n\\nThe great thing about Soda Fountain is that the ice cream selection varies from tried and true classics (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mint chocolate chip, etc.) to new classics (like Nutella, salted caramel, and Birthday Cake), to unconventional choices (like pineapple, lemon thyme with black pepper and other seasonal rotating flavors). My personal favorite is the birthday cake. It's not too sweet, and they use real pieces of cake in the ice cream. Make it your birthday whenever you want!

They have a large selection of all the typical brunch items you'd like-- eggs, omelettes, egg benedicts, pancakes, french toast, etc. and from my experience you can't go wrong with any of them. Most brunch places I know are only good at making either the savory OR the sweet items, while others try to make really unique items at the risk of it being overpriced and mediocre. I think Ball Square is *consistently* good at making solid, classic brunch food. This place does have huge portions, so either come hungry, split a plate or take some home.\\n\\n2. Be sure to take into consideration wait times on weekends--  during popular brunch times there tends to be a very long line out the door. No reservations, and you and your party have to be physically present in order to get the table when you're up next. Otherwise I've never had an issue with seating on weekdays or late (past brunch rush times) on weekends. \\n\\nTo credit this restaurant and the staff, I have come during busy weekend brunch times and during slow downtimes, and we've always gotten attentive, warm and timely service. It seems the waiters/waitresses are all friendly and happy (or at least okay?) working there which always elevates my appreciation for the restaurant. \\n\\nCons? I love coffee with brunch and I just don't like their drip coffee, which would be fine if I could pay less for just a small cup rather than than $4 for unlimited.

Here is what I have learned from my experience:\\n\\n-If you are a fan of garlic, that is by far the best flavor to go with of their crusts. The rest are all so-so (Note: I have only tried onion, butter, and Cajun, so I can't speak for ALL the rest)\\n\\n-They have the best cheese bread around, altho there are several different options for it on the menu and only one of them is stellar. If I can remember which one it is that rocks so much I will add it later. \\n\\n-They will NOT deliver to Victorian Village, or anywhere south of Campus, even if the dude on the phone tells you they will. You'll likely get a call 45 minutes to an hour later from a manager apologizing for the map-illiterate staff, and even though you'll have to pick up your grub, it will be free with bonuses and/or coupons for your next order. \\n\\nI've never tried any of their salads, wings, or subs, but I've always been pleased with the pizza. They advertise pretty heavily around Campus/ Clintonville so discounts are pretty readily available, another plus in my book.

It  took me a little off guard because I am used to having to wait for HH on Fridays, but who was I to complain?  We decided to share a few dishes and ordered the Voodoo Doughnut burger, chicken fritters, mini vanilla milkshake and fries, and short rib perogies.  \\n\\nIt was love at first bite for the sweet, savory, and just plain delicious burger.  Who knew such a weird flavor combination could taste so good?  The chicken fritters were also very tasty.  I really liked the smoky flavor which called to mind the flavor of bacon and the bright orange sauce it came with was really good.  Now, when it came to the mini milkshake and fries, the fries were perfectly crisp and seasoned, but the milkshake was well, vanilla...and it was basically 1/3 shake:2/3 whipped cream.  The short rib perogies were beautifully plated, but sadly the taste was pretty bland and didn't live up to our expectations.  \\n\\nOn to the drinks!  My friend ordered the Gin Blossom and I had the Dew Drop.  Both were made well and we would come back for drinks.    The ambiance of the Original is what really stands out.  It's the kind of place where you just feel 10 degrees cooler by being there!  \\n\\nHowever, the service is a little hit or miss.  Our server never came around to inform us of last call for happy hour although we were still in the mood to munch (and lost track of all time due to our chatting).  After a few unsuccessful attempts to wave her down, we were able to order a couple more app's from the dinner menu to try: the SOS (mushrooms on a thick brioche topped with a poached egg) and the chicken liver pate.  However, we were informed that they had already run out of the chicken liver pate (by 6:20pm??) and just had the SOS instead.  This dish was well presented but lacked flavor and the egg was a little too raw for my taste.  I ended up having to put more salt and pepper to give this dish a boost.  However, the bussers were great at clearing our tables of plates efficiently.  \\n\\nAll in all, I was a bit disappointed in my visit because I just expected better executed dishes, so I am willing to give it 3.5 stars and being the optimist that I am, I'll round up! :)  I will probably be back with my husband and try out other things."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Food is decent.

We sat in a cold, cramped restaurant, experienced slow, sub-standard service, and also paid way over the odds for sushi, which could best be described as all-you-can-eat quality. We waited ages for our food to come, while listening to dreary western pop music. We were sat so close to our neighbours that I found it hard to manoeuvre out of my pull over without elbowing another diner! Having a private conversation was well and truly out of the question. Very disappointing.  I had the fried fish, which was undercooked, and breaded. My wife had a California roll, and we also split a dynamite roll- on both occasions the sushi rice had been over cooked, and a little slushy. My wife ordered white wine, which was served in a smudged glass, and tasted like a cheap wine mixed with flat soda. Disappointing all round. \\n\\nI suppose, if anything, this review questions the value of following popular opinions on apps such as Yelp!

We could have gone to Worthington Inn during this same time period and got an excellent martini at happy hour prices and had a much better atmosphere and a nicer bartender.  Two of us had the turkey Reuben, 2 had cheeseburgers, chili and wings.

So this time my wife wanted to go for another of those luxury tea experience in downtown, my eldest daughter made the booking for us for 4. The sign outside the shop does look different but I didn't notice much, as we walked in to a familiar place and was seated in no time. However we noticed the menu was different, but we ordered anyway willing to try those new platter tea sets. The girls were craving for seafood platter, so the waitress recommended us the Tea set menu, we ordered 3 Sakura Tea set and 1 Westcoast Tea set @$48/ea set! But that's OK because the tea was included. Then problems started to happen, the Westcoast tea set came with a tiny bowl of some kind  of Hawaiian salmon/tuna with little rice under it, my wife discovered the rice was so hard and difficult to chew, it was like a day-old leftover.. we asked the waitress and she was trying to explain that it's a special kind of rice Hawaiian style! Come on! we had this kind of tuna dish before in Hawaii and the rice was soft  and chewable. They replaced the dish but it looks like they got rice from same pot and just re-heated from microwave oven, this time it was not as chewy but definitely same hard rice. I really didn't expect this from a high-end luxury tea shop. Ayways my wife gave up on the tuna dish and concentrated more on the desserts which were ok and just tried to enjoy the Persian tea that came with it. The tea was as good as we remembered it, but when I asked for refill they told me that would be additional cost of at least $10/tea depending on the selection!! I was really disappointed, as last time we came here, they allow for refills for the same tea leaves in the kettle without extra charge! Of course I tried to ask them why and I was told they changed their policy and actually there have been changes in the menu since they changed management... I was told the shop is now called TWG and it is no longer the URBAN  TEA merchant tea shop. I didn't know that (though I thought I noticed some changes when we came in)  and all this time I thought we were having tea in the same nice tea shop that we experienced more than a year ago.

The decor looked as if they bought out a builders special on Craigslist from the 70's and as for the bathroom.. I have seen truckstops more updated.the bar had cheesy shiney stickers bought from JoAnns crafts to look gold leafed. We requested the patio and was told they would clean a table for us and we were seated inside instead as no table was cleared for us. We switched to a seat near the bar instead of by the entrance. This was a mistake on our part because it became very loud . Which I cant fiqure that out because the beer on tap was so watered down we settled for water. The ambience was far from Irish with the rock music playing and the servers dressed in super short shorts and tanks. To they point I was amused at how many times a server waiting on a nearby table pulled her pants out of her crack as she refilled drinks and served them food. The menu looked really good but nothing more than \\"bar\\" food with a few Irish named dishes. We ordered  a small garden salad, plus here is the dressing was nice and thick but the cucumbers were limp and mush and the Shepards Pie that tasted like greasy hamburger helper  with mashed potatoes on top. The grilled chicken that was a small portion, half of a split breast with hardly any flavor and served with potatoes and bland steamed broccoli with no seasoning, salt or butter. The plus of this meal was the broccoli was steamed just right. We couldn't bring ourselves to have dessert so we were brought the check and had to summons the server because she overcharged us for the salad and had to get the bill adjusted. I reached for my water as I was waiting and it was gone. She had totally wiped the table of everything when she brought the bill. Nothing like a suttle hint to leave asap..

I mention this because there's a couple things you should keep in mind: 1) not everything on their menu is pre-prepared, so you may have to wait for your dish, and 2) their kitchen closes every day between 2PM and 4PM, so if you arrive then, you'll be limited to what's in the display case.\\n\\nAs it turned out, we arrived about a quarter after 2, so we had to choose from the items in the display case.  Which, in the end, turned out not badly - we were still able to make a decent meal of it (once we went home and cooked some soba to add to what we had bought).  You could also eat in; they have a small seating area with three small tables and a handful of chairs.\\n\\nThe food is comparatively simple and of good quality; the kind of thing you would expect from a nice home-cooked meal in Japan.

Rainey Street in general is a great area for food, drinks, music, and hangouts, and I would highly recommend venturing over if you want a little bit more funk. \\n\\nTheir setup is made for large groups. They have rows and rows of long wooden tables and benches outside, where folks can sit under strings of lights and hang out with their family and friends. The setup encourages conversations with soon-to-be friends.\\n\\nTheir specialty is their homemade sausages. They make over 2,000 lbs of sausage in 30 varieties each week, by hand at the restaurant. Super impressive! You can get everything from a bratwurst to wild boar and rabbit. Some of their sausages include: turducken (yep, that's right - a turkey, duck, and chicken); duck, bacon, and fig; bangers and mash; fried chicken; currywurst; BBQ bacon and shrimp; dak bulgogi; and even a vegan tempura eggplant and red bell pepper sausage. All sausages are $10 and under. They also have a variety of appetizers like fried cheese curds, pig skins, honey pepper jerky, poutine, and chili cheese fries. In addition, they've got sides like potato salad, mac and cheese, green beans and bacon, red beans and rice, grits, fruit and veggie plates, fries, and salads. \\n\\nAnd if you like beer, look no further. They have the largest tap wall in all of Austin. Whatever you're looking for, they most likely have. 104 beers on draft and 50 more in cans and bottles! They have a huge variety of local beers, as well as ones from all across the country and Belgium and Germany. And if you're not much of a beer person, they also have wine. \\n\\nI ordered the fried chicken sausage, which is served with mashed potatoes, house-made milk gravy, horseradish mustard, and a honey buttered biscuit. It was really, really good. Crispy and lightly breaded on the outside.

Though SV2 doesn't  have the full juice bar you can still get your sweet tooth satisfied as they do have their vegan ice cream which they also make shakes out of.

The atmosphere is nice and the decorations are good. We did not like the glare from the window that bothered my friend as the sun was setting.\\n\\nThe sake they served was delicious. As we were perusing the menu of the set meal, we had problems figuring out the different entree choices. The indentation and lack of clarity made for interesting and a bit time consuming process trying to order. I had to bust out in Mandarin (I heard him speak Mandarin to other server) to tell him maybe fix the menu to cause less confusion. I felt bad that when he explained to us, it still was not clear.\\n\\nIn the end we got the white tuna appetizer and the hibachi main entree. The White Tuna appetizer was seared white tuna in a yummy yuzu sauce topped by black caviar. One of my faves of the night. (It doesn't hurt I am a big fan of white tuna too.) Since my friend is not an adventurous eater and usually eats not alot of meat it was an interesting choice getting the hibachi as there was chicken, shrimp, beef, scallop and lobster (she dislikes lobster). I liked the fried rice and the sauce was nothing to write home about with the meat and seafood. As with hibachi, not everything is cooked evenly and though the beef was perfect the chicken, scallop and lobster were a bit overcooked.\\n\\nFor the finale, we opted for the mochi ice cream. The presentation was pretty with 3 mochis of different flavors halved (vanilla, green tea and red bean?) were placed with a chocolate drizzled design and whipped cream. My dinner companion disliked the chocolate as it changed the taste.\\n\\nThere were some  hits---the White Tuna and Sake. The server was nice and attentive just his ability to explain the choice offerings and the lack of clarity in the menu did not help. We did like the decor of the place. Very big and we were seated in the front area by the hostess stand. There is an area downstairs and bar in the back as well as Hibachi area.\\n\\nThe food for the main entree a bit over cooked save for the beef and I did like the egg in my rice.

Where to go next...since they were out of the hush puppies, we decided to ordered the Charcuterie Plate: Cured, Smoked and Salted Meats & Seafood...there was no seafood on the plate and meats looked like something I could have bought from Market Basket...\\nWe ate dinner at the bar and our bartender didn't even get us silverware, I had to go fetch it from an empty table and not once did he ask us how our meal was.  We realize the bartender hasn't even tasted the whole menu when he made a comment about not having eaten either of our dishes....isn't this restaurant 101?  Decor was great when a \\"manager\\" was walking around on the phone in front of guests... that makes the place even more appetizing.  In terms of dinner, it was well presented...I had the cod and it was seasoned nicely but the root veggies were dripping in oil and under seasoned.  My husband had the scallop dishes, there were 4 medium size scallops but for the price you would think they could throw in a bit more of extras.\\nThe best part of this meal was the price.  It was surprisingly expensive and I left hungry.

The bread is heart, not the type you typically get at the supermarket.  With all the greasy goodness this sandwich has it needed a thicker bread so that it will not fall apart on you.  The peppers added a nice spiciness to the cheesy meaty concoction. When you bite into the sandwich all the juices and meaty and cheesy goodness gushes into you mouth.  It's total joygasm!  The home made potato chip were a miss for me.  It was a bit cold with some chips crunchy while others soggy with grease.  After about 10 chips, it just started to get unappetizing.  I think with how big the portion size of their sandwiches are, I feel it's unnecessary to get the chips. Especially since the amount of calories these chips contain are probably epic.\\n\\nThe place is a bit small.  They have a large bar where single diners can sit but only a few tables.

I don't know why I waited so long to make a reservation.  I just assumed it was an overrated restaurant that did not deserve the fanfare.  It definitely lives up to its reputation.  The food, the view, the service, nothing was lacking.  We went for dinner but I will be back for brunch in order to get a better view of the grounds at daylight.\\n\\nWe started with a few glasses of wine and a few appetizers.  First was the house smoked salmon, crispy potato cake, and goat cheese.  According to the waiter, this is one of the few dishes left on the original menu.  At first, I was wondering if I should even spend my time (and money) on smoked salmon.  After the first bite, I understood why it remains on the menu.  The flavors all blended so well and the potato cake was like shoe string potatoes but they were actually crispy!  Almost like a cracker.  I knew if the smoked salmon was that good, I was in for a treat.  Next, we had the jumbo lump crab cake and the peppercorn crusted kangaroo. \\n\\nThe crab cake was actually a LUMP crab cake.  It was amazing the crab pieces were huge and it had just the amount of crust.  Out of all the appetizers I had I would have to say hands down the peppercorn kangaroo was the best.  Don't get me wrong, the others were outstanding but the kangaroo won the gold (notice the Olympics reference).  I had never had kangaroo before it tasted to me like a mix of beef and chicken.  It had great flavor but was very light.  It's always amazing to me to taste meat that looks like beef. I  had whale in Norway.  It looked like beef but tasted like a mix of beef and fish (not in a good way).  Back to the kangaroo, very flavorful the snap peas were cooked perfectly and when they bring it to the table they pour the sauce over the top.  I could have just had that for dinner.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the scallop special.  The scallops were perfectly cooked over a crispy rice cake with julienne cut carrots and sugar snap peas.  I did not even finish the dinner because I was stuffed from the appetizers and I wanted to save a tiny bit of room for dessert.  I'm so glad I did.\\n\\nDessert was a hard decision.  I was trying to decide between the Popcorn Cracker Jack Sundae or the Chocolate Grotto.  I decided to opt for the Chocolate Grotto.  It's basically a chocolate dome with caramel and a flourless chocolate cake inside.  It can with pretzel dust on the plate.  Upon arriving at the table it looked very interesting.  Our waiter instructed us to break the dome to get to the cake and caramel.  As he walked off I grabbed my fork and proceed to tap and then stab the dome...nothing.  I told my husband \\"you're going to have to take a whack at it\\".  He taps it as well and before he was about to stab it.  Another waiter comes by and says use the back of your spoon and \\"beat it like it stole your money\\".  I kid you not.  It worked though.  The dessert was well worth the aggression.  The caramel and chocolate cake paired nicely with the saltiness of the pretzel dust.\\n\\nAll in all the meal was fabulous.  Afterwards, we went for a walk along the grounds.  It was gorgeous.  I will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Dorset hall","address":"267 neponset ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Experienced Dorsett last nite, loved it!

I was the only person there at almost-one o'clock (BaRa is open for lunch right now from 11am to 1:30pm, so if there is a lunch rush, I missed it).  Their lunch selection is sort of scant.  Ramen/Udon is chicken, beef, or shrimp.  There were yakisoba type options (also of the chicken, beef, or shrimp variety) and appetizer type dishes... I had eyes only for the ramen so my recall might be a bit scarce.  It's not the most inexpensive lunch at $7.50 for a bowl of chicken + ramen.\\n\\nThe service was prompt and attentive (though again, I was the only person there) and the food was serviceable (the slightly over-hot broth was pretty good.

I have never been to their restaurant, but I recently engaged their services to cater a large function I was organizing in the home of an executive with whom I work.  The theme of the event was Oktoberfest, so Gustav's was a natural choice.\\n\\nIn the planning phase, I worked with Cullette to form the menu.  From the very start, Cullette was wonderful, offering helpful suggestions about what we could serve to reflect our theme.  While Gustav's has an extensive menu whose entire contents would be perfect for any event that requires German fare, we were working in a tight budget, and wanted to be as authentic as possible, without being extravagant, but also without skimping too much.  Cullette was sensitive to our budgetary constraints and helped me put together the perfect menu, featuring a few heavy passed hors d'oeuvres, some crudit√©, and what became a very good selection of beer, wine, and local craft root beer.\\n\\non the evening of the event, cullette and her staff arrived exactly on time, and went about their activities with utter professionalism, while also employing some creativity and initiative with regard to setting up on our unique platforms of activity. the few questions cullette asked were succinct and enough to help her staff have everything up and running promptly on time.  when I later asked cullette how many staff she had, I was surprised to learn that it was only her, two cooks and two bartenders.  there seemed like so many more!  but their movements were so quick, coordinated, and efficient, they didn't need a whole lot of folks to get the necessities done.\\n\\nas for the star of the show - the food - it was great!  I was impressed that they had fondue to offer for the event, so that was a treat.  for me, the best thing was the beer poached sausages.  I've had so many different kinds of sausages in my life, but those served by Gutav's were simultaneously unique and familiar.  I didn't guess they were cooked in beer; I had to witness it to learn the fact.  but their flavors were confident and perfectly harmonized, without being overbearing or strong on any one element.  Also delicious - though I'm relying on hearsay for this item - were the kosher chicken sausages they served.  those didn't last a half hour, so they must have been great!  We also ordered pretzels for everyone, and those were delicious.  soft, but firm, perfectly brown, and lightly salted with the traditional type of salt.  I enjoyed mine dipped in the fondue, but many took advantage of the many types of mustard on offer to put on their own pretzels.  and while the beer and root beer were pleasant enough, for me, the wine stole the show.  I don't remember the brands, I'm sorry to say, but the pinto gris and the cabernet they served were so good, I plan to follow up about what kind they were, and order a case of each for myself!\\n\\nIn summary, if you need a caterer, and would like some tasty but not overbearing german fare, HIRE THESE PEOPLE!"},{"name":"Tarka Indian Kitchen","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 124","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This location has several clubs nearby.

The chicken tikka masala is marinated, baked chicken breast, cooked in a tomato based tikka sauce. The chicken breast wasn't dry which is a big plus. There were big pieces of cilantro and even though at first you see the bowl and think it won't fill you up, she served about a filled spoon and a bit of rice and the same portion of chicken.

We had to eventually stop a waitress racing to the kitchen in order to put our orders in. She explained to me that the salad I had ordered would take extra long to make. Salad?? I was hungry so opted for a soup instead, she explained that one would take time as well. I then asked about the Dobinmushi soup ( Flavored clear soup with shrimp, fish, chicken, and vegetables), she said that one would be fine.  What she did not mention was that the soup was more like a cup of tea, and would not in any way be a substantial dinner meal. For 7.50 I received a tea pot with broth and 4 pieces of floating shrimp, chicken and vegetables. The majority of our group were also sorely disappointed in the sizes of their meals. However the sushi plates proved to be the best choice on the menu. \\nAnd there was nothing wrong with the taste of the food. \\n\\nWe quickly asked for our check once we realized we would not be able to get a full dinner without spending a lot of money and time waiting to be served. The waitress proceeded to charge us the wrong amount on our creditcard without discovering her own mistake. After much explanation we finally walked out of there, angry, disappointed but relieved to be out. And continued to have a delicious second dinner of fish tacos at Dorado. I will never go back to Shiki."},{"name":"Hai Ky","address":"3736 Bee Caves Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've always enjoyed their food and the service is usually exceptional, but not today.\\n\\nI come in a little after 2pm, ravenously hungry.

I'll just grab a seat RIGHT BY THE FRONT COUNTER and wait until they finish up.  I have no menu in front of me, no water.  About 5 minutes later, a soccer mom comes in with her son.  The waiter greets them with menus in hand and seats them at a booth. Runs and grabs their waters, and then he disappears in the back.  \\n\\nIt's like he's going out of his way to avoid eye contact with me.  He comes back and bags up a to-go order. Delivers it to a table of 3 gentlemen who have just finished lunch .  He then goes back behind the counter and starts prepping something back there. Then he goes in the back and disappears for a few more minutes. \\n\\nI grab a to-go menu just because it's been 10 minutes, and I'm now getting hangry. No one has acknowledged my presence.  The waitress keeps coming out of the kitchen with plates LOADED with yummy looking food.

I finally just stare straight at him with my hands in the classic palms up WHAT THE F*CK pose for a good 20 seconds before he finally acknowledged me for the first time.  He grabs his pad, comes to my table and NO APOLOGY just asks if I'm ready to order. ?!?\\n\\nI asked him why he treated me like I was invisible. Again, NO APOLOGY!. Instead he mumbles something about getting a to-go order ready for the 3 gentlemen WHO HAVE JUST FINISHED EATING. \\n\\nSeriously? This is how you treat your guests?

I was up in the Hill Country Galleria area picking something up from the center and remembered that my cousin had recommended the Riviera Bistro to me.\\n\\nI had some work that I needed to do and my backpack in the car so I decided to drop in to get some lunch and a little work done.\\n\\nFirst thing - I told the host that I wanted to do a little work during lunch so he found me a great table by the side windows with a lot of light and away from the other diners.  Very accomodating.\\n\\nWhen the time came to order I asked for the Pasta Del Mare (I was craving a little seafood) and the waiter said 'no, you don't want that.  You want the Seafood Crepes'.  I told him that I was looking for some seafood and the pasta sounded good and he said 'I'm happy to bring that to you, it's really good, but you can get gluten free pasta anywhere.  Try to find gluten-free crepes somewhere!  The Seafood Crepes are incredible'.  I decided to go with it and got the crepes.  He wasn't being obnoxious about it, he was being friendly.\\n\\nHoly cow.\\n\\nIncredible.\\n\\nThe food was fantastic (craving it now as I write this) and the service was super.\\n\\nThe only reason that I gave four stars instead of five is that I really STILL want the pasta and I am uncomfortable giving five off of the one visit.

It marked a remarkable quarter for my husband and i in terms of work, our 1st year anniversary dinner and the pending valentine's day dinner. The place sure lived up to its reputation of being up beat, expensive, very different from a regular Japanese place and serves the best sushi. We tried a lot of dishes and absolutely loved the Kobe beef roll and the Otoro Caviar. We ordered for the Goshinanori which is 5 sashimis and consisted of flounder, albacore tuna, salmon, yellowtail and one more which I cannot remember. Realised I do not have a palate for raw fish. Also tried uni for the first time and did not like it atal. Horrible texture. But also realised that I do have an enormous palate for grilled seafood..... We simply devoured the grilled Chilean Seabass and the baked Lobster tempura. The Chilean Seabass came on a flamed leaf... Great aroma trailing behind so much so that the table next to our leaned in an asked exactly what it was. The tradition roll that we noticed passing by look delicious too.\\nFor dessert we had the chocolate Bento which can with green tea ice cream. I found the ice cream very interesting.\\n\\nA word of caution, the place is hard to find coz the signage is very discreet. There is going to be waiting regardless of whether you have a reservation but it's better to make a reservation than not. Ask for the sushi bar seat. Apparently the turnover there is faster.

This is now my go-to Shanghainese place for lunch in Richmond.\\n\\nFor one, the Xiao Long Baos (Â∞èÁ¨ºÔøΩ? are excellent. Juicy and full of flavor, but delicate enough to preserve the ratio of skin to meat and soup, they are top notch here.

That is just spectacular value for their signature dish - I get them every time I come.\\n\\nI also want to give a shout-out to their soups, in particular the Preserved Vegetable Fish Slice Soup (Èõ™ËèúÈ±ºÁâáÊ±§Èù¢, $7.50). I loved the freshness of the fish, the eminent \\"slurpiness\\" of the noodles, and the saltiness of the preserved vegetables.

But other than that you can't really get much better food-wise or price-wise.

I was told that because this was a new policy, I should have been able to get one whole slab of cheese without being charged for extra cheese, but since it was a new policy, the servers were unclear. I told him that I accepted the apology, but was more appalled by the way I was treated than by the policy itself, and in fact I now embrace the \\"half slab\\" of cheese, since it's a healthier portion, anyway. He then asked if I would use vouchers at another location if he sent them to me, and said that while I didn't have to use them at the MIT location, he wanted to keep me as a customer. The offer was enough to get me back on this burrito bandwagon, with one caveat:\\n\\nI don't eat at the MIT Anna's as often as I used to because this incident left a terrible taste in my mouth, but I do make it out to the Porter and Davis Square locations as often as I am able to because I love these burritos. I still go to the MIT location occasionally, but I will never forget the way that dude treated me, and I would simply rather spend my money on the variety of great restaurants in the MIT/Central/Kendall area than binge on burritos the way I used to.\\n\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nI Love me some Anna's burritos, and when I lived in Davis Square I would, I kid you not, eat there every single day. I had picked up this habit my senior year at MIT, when the Anna's on campus was brand new and exciting, and I had only been able to venture out into Cambridge for burritos rarely, if ever.\\n\\nSince then, I have found this location to be completely sub par when compared to the other locations. The staff is rude, and they know english until you complain about something (I speak spanish, but refuse to play that game). The burrito quality is lackluster, and they recently changed their policy to only use half a slice of cheese on small burritos. Probably a good thing for my waistline, but not so great when I ended up having to shell out an extra 65¬¢ for \\"extra\\" cheese when I argued with the guy behind the counter about how that's not the same amount of cheese I had on my burrito yesterday (as in, yes, I do eat there every day most weeks)! Instead of explaining the policy to me, he just stared at me until I had to shrilly insist on more cheese, not knowing that this was now extra cheese. After getting my bill, I had a rational conversation with the cashier, and she kindly explained what was going on, but I am still disgusted that I had to pay money to be angered and slightly embarrassed by the incompetence and rudeness going on behind that counter.

Given it was a wedding banquet, it wasn't fair to rate the restaurant based on that experience alone.  For one reason or another, I haven't gone back to Royal China until last month when we had a family dinner there.\\n\\nOur group was about 14 people and it was a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was fairly busy at about 70% capacity.  It was a bit unusual for a tuck away Chinese restaurant on a weeknight.  Initially, I thought this could be a good sign that the food would be good.  \\n\\nSo we sat down, put in our order, and waited.  30 minutes later, nothing came to our table even though people who have ordered after us already got their dishes.  So we grab one of the three waiters serving the entire restaurant and ask what is going on.  Turns out they forgot our order (which is insane since we are the biggest party in the restaurant).  Another 25 minutes later, the food is finally coming.  \\n\\nHalf way through our meal, the head waiter came to our table delivering one of the 12 dishes.  He said, \\"This is the last one, enjoy!\\" as he departed but everyone was so busy with their food, no one heard him except me.  15 minutes later, I realized there were only 8 dishes on the table so I asked if we changed the order.  Of course, we didn't.  So we tried for the next 10 minutes to get one of the waiters' attention.  One finally came and after some checking, he said the kitchen forgot 1/3 of our order.  Another 20 minutes of waiting and the remaining dish came.  But one of them, which is supposedly the favor of everyone, was not done right.  Instead of fish filets in hot broth, it was served as a whole fish with bones in hot broth.  The worst part is, it wasn't even the type of fish we wanted.  Nevertheless, we didn't ask to return it because it might another 20 minutes long struggle.\\n\\nWhen we finally ready to leave, the check came in with the fish dish at double the normal price.  When we questioned why it was so much more expensive than the menu price, the head waiter try to argue that we ordered something special and they have put in a higher quality fish.  Obviously, that was a lie.  After some back and forth, the head waiter agreed to charge us the original price.\\n\\nAfter this experience, I can say I would never come back to Royal China (note: it was my extended family's decision in the first place).  Its service is lacking, it is understaffed, they aren't organized, and they will try to cheat you if you are not careful.  Why do so many people go to it?  I have no idea.

And imagine those moments afterward, sweaty, spent, and sweet. Okay, leaving G. Michael's, I felt like i'd just had that sex. A thousand times over. \\n\\nI tried at least 12 menu items tonight. There is no way I would give G. Michaels food anything less than five stars. If I could give it an infinite number of stars, I would. We took the boy here for his birthday - a small dinner party for the most lovely people. Fortunately, also, the boy's brother is local Chef Leon of Cantina Laredo fame, and has worked in the Columbus fine dining scene for a long time - he suggested ordering/sharing a bunch of different apps, entres, and desserts, and order we did! \\n\\nFor apps: shrimp and grits, PEI mussels, pan-fried Maryland crab cakes, and warmed roasted lamb lollipops. \\nFor entres: seared jumbo scallops, duo of ohio pork, pink peppercorn-cured duck breast, bourbon-mollasses glazed grilled veal chop, wild Alaskan halibut\\nFor dessert: lemon tart, peanut butter cup, and rum banana bread pudding. \\n\\nYes, be jealous. This is probably the best meal I've ever eaten, mostly because of the communal nature - but also, having known Chef Leon for some time, I've been at several dinners where food was shared, and G. Michaels just blew everyone out of the water. All of the apps were amazing, particularly the crab cake, which was huge and juicy and just seared enough. The polenta that came with it was also excellent. For the entrees, I liked the pork duo the best - one of the pieces of pork was country fried and the other was shredded - but think of the five star version of that. OMFG. In regard to dessert, the lemon tart blew my mind. It wasn't tart at all (haha, pun), but instead sweet and encrusted with a browned butter graham cracker crust... holy good God. And yes, like Jeni's ice cream (which is served at G. Michael's!!), this food came directly from whichever benevolent creator you believe in. It is, dare my Catholic heritage allow me to insist, FROM GOD. Everything was amazing, but those are just the highlights. \\n\\nAside from that, service was okay. Chef noted that we never got any bread - which would have been nice for the mussels because they came in some outrageously awesome sauce. The waiter wasn't totally on his game, but it was also 9pm when we arrived. Whatever, I don't even care. The fact that none of us could make a complete sentence - and yet none of us were \\"stuffed\\" - it was all from mind-blowingly good food that we ended up at O'Reilly's (duh) unable to make conversation with each other at all for lack of... anything that will ever top that culinary experience. There were lots of satisfied noises happening while we dined, and I definitely felt genuinely euphoric. I almost wish it never happened, so I could experience it again for the first time. Oh oh oh AND - we talked to Chef  Tetzloff, who informed us that G. Michael's now butchers most of their own meat - he has been hauling in whole cows and cutting them up, just for you. I'm excited to try the bistro burger from the bar next time... I might pass out just thinking about it. \\n\\nI'm dying a little inside right now. It's impossible to describe.

The Killer Burger bears a close resemblance to the #9 Salad Burger from Goff's in Dallas, in case you are from there.  The best burgers come close to being as good as a steak, and here they drive home the point by plunging a steak knife through your burger when they serve it to you.  I always ask for a steak knife with a burger anyhow!\\n\\nThey also have wonderful salads and salad dressings (their Green Goddess rules!), and it's not easy to find a good salad at most restaurants--it's a mystery to me why this is so.  And their Chocolate Bomb is one of the very best chocolate desserts in Austin, reminiscent of the marvelous Chocolate Intemperance of the old Jeffrey's.

That's where the two stars came from.  The rest of my experience was not so great.  The table set-up has people stuffed into small spaces like sardines. It's definitely a place you will meet new friends, because you're practically sitting on top of one another.  Once the show begins, it's nearly impossible for the servers to move around without tripping over chair legs and human legs.  It's also hard to see from the back, with all he heads, arms, and lighted cellphones in the way.  As far as the service goes, our server did the best she could, but it was obvious that her area was too large and she was not able to accommodate all of her customers effectively, especially the many complaints about what came out of the kitchen. It was subpar to say the least. I had the CHARCUTERIE BOARD.  I asked for no bleu cheese, instead I got no cheese at all.  I had flavorless turkey, something that tasted like bologna, and a decent salami.  It was served with toast so hard, it kept crumbling in my hand.  I only ate the salami with a glass of wine.  I didn't get the chance to ask the server, because she had 200 other people to attend.  I also had to wait well after the show was over for my check, when others around me received theirs. Again, the poor lady was overwhelmed.

The shop is tiny and sports 4 tables or so and a small window seating area, but I've never really had issues getting a seat. I suppose the typical Allston clientele prefers taking out their food or getting it delivered rather than getting perfumed by Mexican food in an un-airconditioned space the size of a walk-in storage closet. \\nThe nachos were a pretty decent size for the price I paid. Lots of meat, guac, salsa, beans, drizzled sour cream, yadda yadda. In terms of taste and ingredient quality, Habaneros did an excellent job. The chips were most likely store-purchased, but they were crunchy, salty,  and held up very well against the weight of the toppings. Guacamole was fresh, steak was well seasoned, and it was overall a very solid plate of nachos. For the price, they definitely give you what you pay for and more. I'd recommend their other food as well.

It's quite the contrast to the Old Gold next door, a beloved watering hole very much in its element. Happily, the service was very friendly and solicitous, even if they made several errors on our order, kinks we would expect to be ironed out as time goes on.\\n\\nThree kinds of sangria were a pleasure to behold, apparently a staple with this chain. Alas, the red sangria boasted little to write home about, and tasted more like watered-down red wine. We ordered two iterations of the Berliner Fries with The Works ($11.50 a pop) as well as a side Greek salad and another portion of meat -- for the meat portions were still lacking in the above. Perhaps this was the wrong choice, because it felt like were eating a pile of fat and salt with little flavor or nuance to it. Pretty disappointing, given that we love all manner of Mediterranean food. Other d√∂ner kebab offerings may be a better bet.\\n\\nThe best part about the experience at Spitz? The many games on hand, including Jenga, backgammon, Cards Against Humanity, etc. But we don't need to spend upwards of $40 to pretend we're in LA -- we'd rather go next door to Old Gold or down the street to Backyard Social and enjoy better food, music, and community."},{"name":"Treehouse Restaurant and Pub","address":"7 Kings Cir NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome patio/deck area - this is a great spot when the weather is nice.

Very slow, especially in the initial greet time and drink orders, and there weren't many tables occupied. Other tables near us expressed the same concerns.\\n\\nWe had the scallops, salmon, and fig & prosciutto pizza for our entrees. Neither fish dish was a bad choice, but they weren't exceptional by any stretch. The fig & prosciutto pizza was slightly problematic; the ingredients were fig preservers (sweet), caramelized onions (burnt sweet), goat cheese (takes on the flavor of other sweet ingredients) and arugula, which should have cut the sweetness, somewhat, if there had been enough of it. The fig preserves with the caramelized onions just set the flavor as nearly too sweet and overpowered the prosciutto, whose saltiness should have cut the sweetness. What sounded like a good idea just didn't, in our opinion, work. (A table adjacent to ours with whom we had struck up conversation during our extended wait times drew the same conclusion about it, sadly.)\\n\\nThe decor of the restaurant is really nice. Again, we liked it okay, but the inconsistencies were unexpected. Perhaps it has gotten spoiled because it is attached to the hotel, but it was a little disappointing. I think the menu is ambitious, but someone needs to taste these dishes before deciding they are good ideas. My analysis is that our opinions won't be taken seriously.

The first time I had an issue here I assumed it was a fluke, but third times a charm and I am now at a point where I doubt I'll be coming back. \\n\\nWhen I first ordered their sandwiches they were rich, large, full of ingredients so much so they melted all over the plate and needed a handful of napkins to eat. They were amazing. Now I receive a pancake squished panini missing two of the ingredients listed on the menu (I am not joking when I say the entire Melted Morrison was less than half an inch thick WITH ADDED TOMATO I REQUESTED and flatter than most pancakes). When I received this is was missing the cream-cheese spread or if it was included it was in such small amounts I could not tell it was there. I also received no pepper jack, so basically what I received was a squished to a pancake $9 cheddar grilled panini. \\n\\nTo top it off I dragged my partner there because I'd told him how great it was, he ordered the same and while his had pepper jack, same, smashed to pancake and no cream-cheese spread. On top of that he ordered his grilled cheese and an appetizer side of macaroni salad which he also paid for as an appetizer. They gave him his grilled cheese to go, got home, and instead of the normal chips he should of received they shoved in a half cup round container of macaroni salad. So not only did he pay full price for a $9 squished to a pancake grilled cheese but he was shorted his included side and charged for an appetizer passed off as his side in a half cup bowl. \\n\\nHe'd never bee here, I wanted to show him my favorite things, but this place is now crossed off that list and that makes me sad since they are a block away, I used to be a regular customer, and I have recommended them to NUMEROUS people over the years.

I did notice that they have a nice patio out front which would be good for a spring summer day.  I should have known that when we weren't greeted when we came in that could be a sign of trouble.  When we did see someone, we ordered drinks and some waters. Most places you will get your water straight away but here I had to wait for the water longer than it took the drinks to come out. Figured we better order quick if the service was taking this long and so we did. After waiting and waiting and waiting I finally got up to find my server to ask, \\"how much longer\\" He apologized and said he would check on it.  Finally get the food and it was awful, I'm not sure how you can mess up a cheesesteak sandwich, but they did. This one was a disappointment from start to finish.  I really had high hopes for this place."},{"name":"Shut Up and Eat","address":"3848 SE Gladstone St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Huge portions.  If you're there with your other half, consider splitting a sandwich and a side item like fries.  Some of the sandwiches are almost too stuffed.  Fortunately, the flavor comes in abundance.

I came here and ordered the Broad St. Bomber aka cheese steak.  It comes with 1/2 lb. thinly sliced top round with fried onions, cheddar, provolone and your choice of hot and sweet peppers.  I had my sandwich with both.  I also got a side of their home made potato chips.  I have no words to describe how good this sandwich was.  It was huge and it comes with their home made hoagie roll.  The bread is heart, not the type you typically get at the supermarket.  With all the greasy goodness this sandwich has it needed a thicker bread so that it will not fall apart on you.  The peppers added a nice spiciness to the cheesy meaty concoction. When you bite into the sandwich all the juices and meaty and cheesy goodness gushes into you mouth.  It's total joygasm!  The home made potato chip were a miss for me.  It was a bit cold with some chips crunchy while others soggy with grease.  After about 10 chips, it just started to get unappetizing.  I think with how big the portion size of their sandwiches are, I feel it's unnecessary to get the chips. Especially since the amount of calories these chips contain are probably epic.\\n\\nThe place is a bit small.  They have a large bar where single diners can sit but only a few tables.  This is a place where you want to come as a single diner or with a friend.  It's not a place to bring groups as there is not many tables which can accommodate more than 2 people. If you're looking for a great place that dishes out some serious sandwiches for a reasonable price and you're in the SE area, definitely stop by and try their fabulous sandwiches."},{"name":"Jin Wah Restaurant","address":"4021 SW 117th Ave, Ste E","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Poor service!

Michael's Bistro & Bar","address":"595 S 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Last night, my girlfriend and I went to G. Michael's for their Restaurant Week special...and had a fantastic meal through and through! First of all, it needs to be said that $35 is superb value for the quality of food (and service!) we received, and I can only imagine that the usual prices make it worthwhile as well. \\n\\nWe started off with a couple of cocktails -- her with a Pimms, and me with a Paloma, and both drinks were delicious. For the first course, we split the pulled duck confit salad, and the fried pork belly. Both were excellent, with the duck confit being a little on the spicy side, but not overpoweringly so. The pork belly went perfectly with the sauerkraut, which wasn't too vinegary. \\n\\nFor the main course, she had the New Zealand rack of lamb, while I had the chili-rubbed pork tenderloin -- the dish I was most excited for. We made short work of both. Certain things go without saying at a nice establishment like G Michael's, so to mention that the pork was cooked perfectly is almost redundant...but, well, it WAS, and the chili was present but not overly spicy -- \\"gentle,\\" even. The chimichurri was a brilliantly-conceived pairing, and my plate was as clean as possible afterward. Her lamb was exceptional as well, and even though she's not big a fan of beets, her plate was clean too. She called the dishes \\"simple, yet complex\\" which sounds like an oxymoron on the surface of it, but couldn't be more accurate -- this is what master chefs like to call \\"clean flavors\\": you know a lot of effort went into the creation of the dish, but everything works together and is identifiable.\\n\\nFor dessert, she had the lemon gingersnap tart, and I had the Oreo chocolate tart. She truly loved hers, and said it's one of the best desserts she has ever had, trailing only the blood orange under glass we recently tried at M at Miranova. As for my Oreo chocolate tart, while it's not something I would normally order, I thoroughly enjoyed it -- it was rich without being overbearing, decadent without being too dense, and the whipped cream was a perfect complement. \\n\\nAs for non-food elements, the ambience isn't overly exciting -- perhaps a bit too dim, but such things don't bother me much. The service, however, was exceptional. Dishes were cleared within a minute of finishing, and the next course was always very prompt. What was particularly interesting is how the wait staff is almost invisible -- they're kind and pleasant, but they really manage to quietly dart in and bring or clear plates with the least disruption possible. Sometimes it's nice to strike a good rapport with a server, but there's something to be said for the quiet efficiency of a staff like that of G. Michael's. \\n\\nAll told, this was our second \\"fancy\\" meal in as many weeks, and while it would be hard to top the incredible experience we had at M at Miranova, G. Michael's comes pretty darn close. Having such exceptional food and service for just over $100 is impressive, and it's also worth mentioning that we were both downright FULL afterward -- something that doesn't always happen when fine dining.

Years ago when I was studying in Florida Atlantic University, one of the urban and redevelopment stories I read was when the Rouse Corporation in the 1970s brought a once popular market that was in disrepair back to life. The name of the market is Quincy Market. Fast forward to this summer, when I would be spending time in an iconic marketplace that I had mentally visited in books.  \\n\\n  The Quincy Market that I visited in the summer was a happening Boston point of interest that was so crowded that personal space nonexistent. At the same time it is hard to believe that Quincy Market was threatened with the wrecking ball in the 1970s, it is easy to believe that the work the Rouse Company put into redeveloping Quincy Market has paid off. \\n\\n  There is some confusion between Quincy Market and  Faneuil Hall to the west. Quincy Market is a complex of three parallel buildings that are 535 long that would meet Faneuil Hall at a perpendicular angle if they connected. The names of the three buildings from south to north are South Market, Quincy Market, and North Market. Quincy Market in the center is the main building. This is the two level building with the surface food concessions. The south and north markets are former warehouses that today resemble two linear shopping strips with a historic facade where restaurants and retail are at the lower level with offices above. Between the buildings is are street scenes rich with pedestrian activity, street performers, and architecture. \\n\\n    Quincy Market is a contradiction to the Financial District towers above. As soon as you set eyes on the granite exterior with the Doric colonnade at the east and west entrances, the arcade along the south and north exterior, and the rotunda above; the cobblestone walkways lead to the 1800s when Quincy Market was built. \\n\\n    The east and west entrances bookend a 535 long brick interior corridor of restaurants. You can think of Quincy Market as a World's Restaurant. There are all kinds of food from Boston to China. The restaurants include Regina Pizza, bagel shop, sushi place, barbecue joint, a sausage on a stick eatery, Starbuck's, and Cheers. Upstairs under the rotunda, are the tables. \\n\\n  I am not a fan of situations where it is so crowded that personal space is a luxury. The two times I walked here, it was at a pace slower than molasses on a account of the fact that people were in a human traffic jam. There was little chance that I was going to enjoy a dinner in this environment much less get a table. The ramification was that Quincy Market was a World's fast food restaurant that presented me with ideas of where to eat in the area outside the market. An example is Regina's Pizza, which has a location nearby up in North Beach. \\n\\n  On account of the fact that Quincy Market is in downtown Boston, it is interconnected with famous points of Interest by means of the Boston Freedom Trail. It is in a location off the Freedom Trail between the Old State House and North Beach. It is a short walk down the red bricks of the Freedom Trail to the historic pubs and to the Hard Rock Cafe. On our first night in Boston, we'd end up walking a few feet north of Quincy Market to the pubs and having dinner in the far less crowded the Point. On a later night, we'd walk from the market to the nearby Bell In Hand Pub for a beer. Quincy Market is a relatively close walk to the Waterfront. On our first night we'd explore Quincy Market after spending time at the Waterfront. \\n\\n    After two visits to Quincy Market, I owe a thank you to the Rouse Corporation and the Boston Redevelopment Authority for saving and redeveloping a historic market place. Their investment has paid off substantially. Today Quincy Market is an extremely popular market place that serves food of the world in a historic preserved landmark. I recommend visiting Quincy Market with the nearby points of interest on the Boston Freedom Trail."},{"name":"Wayne's Smoke Shack","address":"406 Center Dr","city":"Superior","stars":"4.5","text":"Perhaps the best ribs I've ever had....and I've had a lot.

We got back an email that said our pizza would be delivered in 30-40 minutes. The email said if had concerns or our pizza did not arrived in the specified timeframe to call the Papa John's and if that was unsuccessful to call corporate. I called the local store 4 times. I never got an answer. The phone rang and rang one time, the next time I got a busy signal, the 3rd time I got a recording that cycled for 5 minutes and then disconnected me, and the 4th time I got a busy signal. At this point. It was past 3pm and there was no word of our pizza. I contacted corporate, the rep was also unable to get the local store on the line. She advised me that she would cancel our order. We went ahead and ordered from Pizza Hut at this point. Our pizza was ready at 3.45pm. So, about 4.15pm Papa John's shows up at the house with the pizza in hand. We are plowing through our pizza hut pizza at this point. I told him we called corporate and the local office, explained the situation, and that we were told the pizza had been cancelled. His response, \\"I\\"m not suprised, we are amazingly busy.\\" He then gave me a bit more attitude before leaving.  Again, I told him i wasn't interested and he left. At no point, did corporate or the driver offer to make it right, I wasn't expecting free but maybe a coupon for next time or an apology.

They don't post their bottle prices online, so we set off unsure of how good of a deal we were going to get. As it turns out, $10 off is a good deal, but not necessarily a cheap deal at Apothecary.

The staff member again very politely asked \\"Do you have your service dog permit with you?\\", which of course the woman did not (because it wasn't a service dog).

Lets face it, it's not high on my list for great customer service.  What I do expect is to not hear an employee (Matthew) proclaim very loud \\"I hate this place!\\" Just because a family of 5 walked in behind me.  It only got worse.....  As I ordered my sub Matthew rolled his eyes at everything I asked for.  I then asked to add peperoni and he laughed in my face, rolled his eyes, then proceded to throw a few slices on.  Everything I asked for, mind you- a fairly easy order, was like pulling teeth.  He threw my sandwich in the oven, and I wish I was exaggerating, im shocked it came out in one piece.  Never once did I get any small talk, not even a hello.  I ate my sub and afterwards I needed to get 2 more that I was taking home to my family.  Deseree took my order this time, not as bad as Matthew but she made me feel like every word I said was excruciating to her ears.  Matthew finished up my sub and ignored what I asked him (double tomato normal onion) he put two huge fist fulls of onion which I asked him polietly to remove and leave a normal amount (queue eye roll and head shaking).  When it came to the tomatos....he didnt put double and when I asked for more he put one slice and wrapped my sandwich up without allowing me to ask for the sauce which I asked him to unwrap to add.  I presented a coupon, he ripped it out of my hand.  No goodbye, have a goodnight, or see ya.  This is just my experience, the families who came and went after me got the same treatment.  It's disgusting that the manager sat in the back the whole time and allowed this to happen.  I didnt even know there was a manager on duty until I was walking out the door.  Needless to say I have never recieved such bad service anywhere, not just Subway.

The service can improve, although it's their first week, so it's understandable that they have to work out the kinks. Very good selection of beer, both bottled and on tap. Wine, too. The food is a curious melange of southern/continental/je ne se quois. Seems a bit daring, considering the neighborhood, but kudos to Kurt Vogel for trying. I went ahead and ordered the Swamp fair (gator bites and \\"wings\\", crawfish, frog legs) and was a bit disappointed. It was an overfried mess. Didn't taste fresh or particularly delectable or tender. But as a novelty item, it was fine. The decor feels a bit haphazard. I guess the owners had a different theme/name in mind and then as they built the place they started to discover architectural/archeological treasures in the building, and decided to go with it. Space feels cavernous and loud. Lighting a bit harsh and sterile. Decor is mostly generic, some of it interesting. Color of the walls - wait for it - crimson red. It needs something to make it more homey and intimate. But I appreciate the fact that they kept a lot of the original architectural details intact. \\nOverall a good place. The prices are pretty good for Harvard Square. If you can get past the cafeteria/dining hall layout and menu/service quirks, it's a fun place to go.

I haven't written a review! Let's rectify that problem, shall we?\\n\\nOne thing that I really love is that they offer different sizes for their ice cream sandwiches. Er, I mean hoagies. You can get a full-size 'wich for six bucks, or a slider for a measly four. And the slider, which is supposed to be smaller, is still huge! And by huge, I mean you-can-make-a-meal-outta-it kind of huge.\\n\\nSo once you've decided on a size, now you've gotta decide on cookie and ice cream flavors. And lemme tell ya, you've got quite the decision ahead of you, because they've got a whole bunch of options to choose from. I'm a sucker for anything raspberry, so I inevitably usually end up with black raspberry ice cream slapped between either sugar cookies or chocolate chip, depending on my mood. Or Nutella, when they have it! The menu varies from day to day.\\n\\nAs a huge fan of the Cookie Monstah truck, I can't write this review without making a few comparisons between the two. Frozen Hoagies will serve you your sandwich in a bowl, which is nice, because all that ice cream crammed between two cookies is a disaster just waiting to happen. Especially if you're naturally a slob, like me. Cookie Monstah usually just provides you with a paper wrapper and some napkins.\\n\\nHowever, while I absolutely love Frozen Hoagie's ice cream (it is really sweet and creamy), their cookies pale in comparison to Cookie Monstah's. The former's are kind of hard, whereas the latter's are always fresh, soft, and chewy. And that's why I must deduct a star. \\n\\nThat aside, you better believe that the Frozen Hoagies truck is always a welcome sight after a hot afternoon of meandering around SoWa Market.

I loved the decor and the seating, and would definitely go back some evening when the place is more full with the stringy lights lit and the energy amped up with more diners and drinkers. \\n\\nI ordered the South Texas Antelope and Venison Merguez sausage, without the bun, over a salad, with dressing and sauerkraut on the side. It was absolutely delicious! The merguez style was right on the money, and the seasoning banished any gamy-ness from the antelope and venison. The salad it was served with was full of fresh veggies and nice greens, and the dressing was very tasty. I loved that they were able to accommodate my request and that there was no up charge for the changes. \\n\\nI paired my sausage with a local Eastcider which I also enjoyed, and which I thought complimented the sausage well. \\n\\nService was spot on, with a friendly, knowledgeable server, who confirmed our orders before she went away, and several others who brought out food and drink who were friendly, smiley and engaging. We sat for a couple hours and had just the right amount of 'checking in' to refill drinks. We were never pressured to close out our tabs or give up our table, and I found this added to the comfy atmosphere. \\n\\nThis place is on Rainey Street, so parking is at the 'top' of the street in a pay lot ($15?) which may seem pricey....so you might consider getting a cab or Uber into the area. Once you are there, there are plenty of other bars to hit up before and/or after.

I was so sad to take my yummy food out of the bag in great anticipation (I haven't had Mexican since Los Jalapenos closed in the location) only to discover no steam, no heat of any kind other than the flavor of the meat in my enchilada but that wasn't the kind of heat I was looking for. EVERYTHING was cold...not even lukewarm! Not only that but there was no lid on my black beans, inside the take out container with my taco & enchilada, and they had spilled in transport onto the rest of my food. I was excited to see fries as an option with my pick two meal but less excited when I got home to find rice where my fries were suppose to be.\\n\\nI did receive 2 bags of tortilla chips but the size.of the queso was the same size as my black beans side, which isn't much for the $3.75 I spent on the appetizer.

Set a few steps away from the Food Court is this shinny sparkling spot. The set up is simple. Walk up to the greeter area, ask to be seated, state your preference of booths or sushi bar. Greeter walks you to table, brings ginger and wasabi in little square plate, places on table with soy sauce. Hands you a menu. Server comes up, asks for a drink order and the proverbial, Have you been here before? No? Explains the menu. Sushi plates are color coded, take as many as you like. They add up your stack of plates at the end. Order other items from the menu. There are sake and other drinks available. Simple enough.\\n\\nFor two of us they handed one menu. As I opened the menu, there was an off putting odor that slapped my face. There were still food bits on the menu pages. We sat at the sushi bar. I wasn't trying to peek under the bar lip, but being eye level I was confronted by \\"black\\" spots on a brushed stainless steel surface.\\n\\nThe menu selection is plentiful of simple rolls. Great thing is the portions are half a roll or 4 pieces. There are basic nigiri and sashimi selections. There is a sensor in the conveyor system that tells the chefs how long an item was on the line. But while the item is being prepared, is it being monitored for time? There was a pile of items waiting to get on the conveyor system outside of the sensor zone.\\n\\nApart from the regular restaurant there are take out items already pre packaged. There is also merchandising available.\\n\\nIf memory serves me right there was a sushi restaurant in Daytona Beach years ago that had a conveyor system also. Nothing new there.

It's complementary and they will bring as much as you'd like.\\n\\nEverything was flavorful and fresh. Service was attentive--they checked in with us regularly, but didn't hover. The restaurant also has a full bar.\\n\\nI would definitely come back and try some additional dishes next time I'm in the Rose City."},{"name":"Harvard COOP Cafe","address":"1400 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2.5","text":"It seems like a few reviewers aren't separating the Coop from its cafe. Well I am. The Coop itself is a great bookstore, and its clientele is smart, yadda yadda. But I like the atmosphere way more at basically every other bookstore cafe I've been in, even Borders or Barnes & Noble. The food here is unimpressive, the seating area is rather small, and the people behind the counter always seem to be talking to each other at high volume. And there are always an extra one or two people that seem to be superfluous. I just can't figure it out.\\n\\nSo if you're perusing the Coop and you're the type that likes to read a few chapters of a travel or recipe book without buying it, I would grab a couple and head to the lower level, which is a lot quieter and gives a little more piece of mind.

I ordered the Native Clam plate, and also had orders on the table of Haddock plate and 2 Ceaser Salads (one with hockey the other with Steak tips). About half way through entrees we ordered another round of drinks and the waitress said the bar was very busy thus taking a long time. Sadly we finished dinner and asked the waitress to cancel the drink order and bring us a check. She apologized about the delay and assured us the order was placed but the bar was strapped.

My wife and I went to the old Cakes and Ale on several occasions, including a New Year's dinner one year. Every time, the food, atmosphere, and service were amazing. It was a warm environment, and we always felt it was a truly rewarding experience. On Saturday January 5, 2013, we finally tried the new location with some friends. The owners have transformed what used to be one of the best dining experiences in the Atlanta area into an obnoxious hipster nightmare. \\n\\nWe arrived at 8:30 for our 8:30 reservation. C & A management needs to have their heads examined for putting their current Maitre D as a point man in their place of business. He was like a young, arrogant reality-show host. He started giving us cutesy sneers and snide comments the second we made contact. Instead of a warm greeting, it was a \\"Well, aren't you LUCKY to have a reservation with us?\\" vibe. We were told our table wasn't ready, but that we could leave, go next door, and sit in the bakery while we waited. Not even an invitation to go to the bar inside the restaurant. We paused, and this cretin actually said to my wife \\"Well, you shouldn't be in a hurry if you came here on a Saturday night\\". WHAT?!?! We should have left right then and there. We were hungry, and we were already there, so we went to the bakery and found four stools. The mopey girl behind the counter saw us sit down, and took ten minutes to acknowledge us. We finally placed an order for apps and some drinks. 40 minutes later, the apps still hadn't come out. The reality-show host skipped in to the bakery after 45 minutes to tell us we had lucked out, that our 8:30 table was ready for us. It was almost 9:30. \\n\\nIt was loud as a train station in the restaurant, but we were starving by this time. Another ten minutes went by with no server in site. Then we met our waiter Kenneth. This guy had all the charm and enthusiasm of a DMV clerk. He never looked me in the eye, mumbled, didn't offer any specials, and was slow as molasses. We had to ask repeatedly for bread and water since the wait staff obviously deemed us not beautiful enough. We ordered and just sat there talking amongst ourselves. It was like we were lepers. \\n\\nWe finally started getting dinner at 10:30PM. The food was ok, but not anything special. As I stated earlier, we had gone to the old location several times. We agreed it had gone way downhill. Definitely not worth the $200 it cost to deal with the horrible service and mediocre food. As we settled up and got ready to leave, the obnoxious hipster tool of a Maitre D swung by our table one last time. Did he ask us about the food or the experience? Did he thank us for our patronage or patience since we ate two hours past our reservation? Nope. He made some smarmy comment to my brother-in-law's date regarding her jacket buttons. He then gave us a fake smile, waved his arms around dramatically, and left us feeling truly ripped-off and violated. \\n\\nTo the owners of Cakes and Ale: Congratulations on your transformation into a \\"major player\\". You and your new uber-hip Bon Appetit crowd enjoy each other's company. My family, and other locals who supported you over the years will never, ever come to your restaurants again.

First off, the service is not the greatest in the world. I'm not sure if the guys working are new, but they're pretty slow, and they forgot a some things on my order (and apparently on the people behind us as well). It's not a huge restaurant, and there weren't a whole lot of people in there, so I think they could really step it up.\\n\\nWe started off with the ceviche, which my girlfriend really liked, chips and guac, and the cheese empanadas. I really loved the guacamole here. You can tell it's made fresh with onions, tomatoes, and a whole lot of cilantro, and the chips that come with it were great too. The cheese empanadas were also tasty, but I think that had to do more with the delicious sauce that came with it. It was hard to tell what all was in it, but it looked mayo based and had a bit of a kick. The empanadas are pretty heavy so beware getting a large entree.\\n\\nFor my entree, I had to try the huge red snapper, Nayarit style. I'd probably suggest going with the smaller portion if you've had some appetizers, because this thing's a monster, and it comes with fries and rice as well. I'm kind of torn on this. I really liked the Nayarit sauce that came with it, but the fish was a bit dry to me. The outside felt completely dried out while the inside was a bit more moist. The flavor was decent, but I think a bit more sauce would have helped, since the  fish is pretty mild. If I were to get it again, I might try one of the hotter sauces.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had the chorizo tacos, and those were really great! I really enjoyed the seasonings mixed in with the chorizo, a bit cinnamon-y, which is just how I like it. \\n\\nOverall, I'd probably try this place again if I was in the area, but it's a bit out of the way for me. They offer a lot more than just fish, so if you're not sure if you want seafood, don't hesitate to check them out. It's a solid choice for more authentic Mexican in the area."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Incredibly over-hyped.

While I was pleased with the lovely plating of my meal, the time it took to do so led to my pork being cold.  Oh well, no biggie.  \\n\\nThe service was also very hospitable and attentive.

He's awesome and I would highly recommend sittingi n his section.  He truly seems to LOVE his job and his warm and funny.  \\nWe were seated quickly (no reservations) and got our cocktails in about 7 minutes.  I had a Hendricks and gin and my friend had some champagne concotion in their cocktails menu.  Both were good.\\nFor an appetizer, we had the pimiento cheese with celery and carrots (about 6 thin slices).  The pimiento cheese was a bit dry - not that good.  But I come from the South and am picky about my PC!\\nFor dinner I had the pork shoulder on a bed of greens and field peas (all locally sourced).  The shoulder was a bit fatty (as it should be) and melted in my mouth.  The greens had almost a sweet taste to them (yum!) and I loved the field peas served over the top.  My dining companion had fried buffalo chicken livers (I don't like buffalo sauce and it was nice that it was served on the side).  The livers were outstanding - very well cooked and yummy.  He also had Rooker's slaw and the greens.  \\nFor dessert we had blueberry pie with peach ice cream and a chocolate torte with blueberry ice cream.  The pie with peach ice cream was better, I thought.  Both were pretty good.\\nI changed my rating from 3 stars (after my first visit) to 4 stars.  Definitely a good place and fun atmosphere.

It's pretty hard to mess up cheese, bread, tomatoes, and herbed olive oil, so of course it was delicious. But was it worth $16? Probably not.

First off, the wait staff were very friendly, and that was nice, and I appreciated that. What went wrong is when I took my first bite of my medium-rare steak, the flavor was indescribably odd. To me, and my dinner partner it tasted like bad meat. What I also found peculiar was the fact that when I cut into my steak, there was no blood whatsoever. Instead of being pink inside, it was like grey jello. Just disgusting. So I sent it back, and this time asked for a steak well-done. The new steak arrived as requested, and had the same peculiar flavor! I ate only one bite of it and went for the unlimited salad bar, which was equally horrifying. It was about 6:30pm, and the  entire buffet/salad bar was a mess. Everything I wanted was either completely out, or very nearly out, and what was left over looked like it had been sitting around since lunch! None of the wait staff went near that salad bar/buffet to restock it. Not only that, but their soft serve machine spat out the equivalent of cold milk into our bowls, and that is what we had for dessert (because everything else was gone) - cold, sweetened milk with strawberry topping. My friend and I ate very sparingly, as we were so horrified to have each spent $17 on such a sub-par meal.

So good that we actually ordered a second plate of it. Delicious.\\n--The sweet potato fries are incredible - not oily, just light and delicious\\n--The veggie burger is pretty good. Definitely ask for it extra-crispy. It's thin so doing that gives it a nice texture. \\n--They have this awesome hot sauce on the tables. It is great.

I dined at Gustavs, Washington Square, last night for my daughter's birthday (her favorite place).  The place looked the same, the service was excellent but the whole experience was a downer.\\n\\nLet's start with the wine list.  I don't go to the preeminent German restaurant in Portland to get really lousy German wine.  Two cheap swills, nothing offered by the bottle.  Gone were any of the real German wines from the Rhine or Mosel.  No Dr. Loosen or other respectable vintners.  We typically spend $50-60 on wine with our food.  Wine has a 300% markup for a restaurant!!!  And I can't buy a bottle of wine?\\n\\nWe ordered the fondue with sausage for three people.  In the \\"old days\\" the fondue came with a big bowl of hot cheese, lots of three types of bread and one sausage per person.  Now?  Two good sausages, about 15 tiny pieces of bread (only 2 dark rye) and about a half cup of fondue.  But that was enough since there wasn't much to dunk in it.\\n\\nWe all ordered Wiener Schnitzel.  We used to get one or two large pounded veal filets.  Last night, two small perfectly breaded patties that looked like they had just come out of a freezer box.  Tough, grisly.  Not at all worth almost $17 a plate.\\n\\nThe fresh rolls are gone now too.  But that's a minor point.\\n\\nFinally the desserts were weak.  Gone is the Strawberry Pizza, any kind of fruit or berry cobblers or any of the old time desserts we've all come to love.\\n\\nI mentioned this experience to our waiter who completely understood.  He said a lot of food was coming back and there many unhappy customers.  I mentioned it to the manager, who looked all of 14, and he was nice enough but he was clueless and tried to make excuses.  \\n\\nIt may be a while before I go back to my once favorite restaurant.

Food came out very quickly! Our server was wonderful, she made some great suggestions and was prompt with checking in on us. She even convinced us to order dessert (I don't think I have ever stayed for dessert once while dining out). My boyfriend and I live literally walking distance from hawkers, and we were excited to have more wonderful dining experiences with them. \\n\\nWhat bothered me was not my experience last night, but what happened the next day. I could not find my debit card anywhere, and Hawkers was the last place I used it. When I went back there the next day, the manager at the time handled the situation terribly. As I was waiting to see the manager about my card, I ran into my server from the night before, she immediately recognized me. She said she did find a card from our table last night. Once the manager came out I showed her my I.D. and she said they didn't have it.  I was left in confusion because my server told me she found my card. I began to tell her this but she didn't even let me finish my sentence, and she asked \\" who was your server??\\" I didn't know her name but she walked up at that moment and had a word with manager.  The manager came back and said she wasn't sure where the manager from the night previous left it, but she said IF I wanted to come back and speak to last nights manager ( who would be in at 3:00 pm, it was 1:00...) I could. Unfortunately, I needed the card at that moment, So I asked her if she could call him, which then she seemed annoyed. Honestly, I thought that as a manager she would have made the initiative to call him without me having to ask... but she called him and she showed me the only card she could find, which was my friends card. I told her that card belonged to my friend and and she rudely stated that I couldn't take it. I never even insinuated that I wanted to take her card... I then said we probably got our cards mixed up. she rolled her eyes and walked away...\\n\\nI was ASTONISHED. What kind of customer service is this? I'm a manager at McDonald's, and I even know that this is no way to treat a customer. She treated me as if I was being completely burdensome. Once she walked away the bartender said not to take it personally, she said she always acts like this. Even your own employees know that you handled that situation unprofessionally! \\n\\nHawkers was delicious, but I am still really fired up by the unprofessionalism I experienced from management today. I almost don't want to go back... but the food is just to die for, so I won't let this hateful woman ruin my dining experience. \\n\\nBUT I am most definitely going to have a word with the GM about this.

Being a vegetarian with a small appetite, I ordered the last remaining tamale allegedly at Tamale House on this bustling Sunday afternoon.

A few minutes later, someone else came by our table to ask me if I wanted spinach as well and what kind of sauce I wanted. Both valid questions, but why hadn't the last person thought to ask me earlier? By this time I was slightly irked, but I hoped the food would make up for it. \\n\\nThe mole sauce was... interesting. Very heavy on the chocolate and nut flavors and a bit overpowering on the enchiladas.

The one thing that I really like about Smokey Bones is the bag of yum, fresh cinnamon donuts that you can get for dessert. I'd come back for those if it was very, very convenient.

Was there even any meat in the chili?? The whole experience, from having to seat ourselves to waiting a good 10 minutes before the waitress would even give us a second glance and bring our drinks, was less than optimal. I went here over 2 months ago, and the other dish we ordered was equally as boring in taste that I cant even remember what we ordered.

Moreover, this place is so dirty, I honestly dont know how they passed any health code inspections. There was wet sauce drippings on the table that got on my shirt, and though the table next to us had left for over 20 minutes, no one bothered to clean the table.

It was a complete, joyful mess.  It was not possible to eat neatly - the pita was saturated with sauce and falling apart.  The seasoning was mouthwateringly salty and tangy with a touch of lemon.

Every time you eat lunch they punch a card - after so many punches you get a free lunch.  Well at least that is how it used to be.  I went there today and ordered Queso and Chips and Fries - under $10 and was told after presenting my card that I can only have one item.  I was not a happy customer at all since I have used a card multiple times without any issues at all.  The waitress said that the manager told her I could only have one item.  After a few minutes the manager came over but I was too angry to talk to her.  My lunch mates told me the manager explained that they changed the policy and only a meal under $10 and it has to be a single item like a lunch special can now be free.  I have an idea....since you changed the policy you might want your staff to explain that to people when they turn in a card, especially since the card did not have the new $10 limit stamp on the back.  The lack of the stamp shows that this customer has an older card and does not know the new policy.  If I was communicated with about the change I probably would not have been so angry.  So tired on crappy customer service.

Fantastic location, and the interior is beautiful -- it's actually a fun, warm space, with plenty to look at. (Tough to do the speakeasy thing with all those windows, but frankly, I like the windows.)\\n\\nAs long as this place hangs on, and I hope it does, I expect I could add more stars. Here's why it's a three for me right now: \\n\\n1) People seem stunned by the valet parking, but my greater issue is that there's no obvious bike rack. This is a relatively bike-friendly stretch of road situated among several bike-friendly neighborhoods. Make it easy for the locals to adopt you -- not cool at all to have to lock up to a sign in a dark parking lot. Please -- call Sopo Bikes in East Atlanta and have them install a rack! \\n\\n2) Very happy with the cocktail and beer variety, and with our server's curious, fun attitude about them. Less happy with how long it takes to get them. I would absolutely go here for a small plate and a drink with friends, but the kind of detail these drinks require apparently takes a while. They need to strike a better balance. \\n\\n3) Just a couple more vegetarian options? Please? And maybe make one or two of them vegan? There are a lot of vegetarians in this area -- if you can get them in the door and feed them well, they will help. There are a couple veggie items on the menu, but they really seem like an after-thought. I like how nearby Sauced and Carroll Street Cafe handled it -- they've basically got two or three fantastic vegetarian or vegan options on the menu, things I feel like I can't get anywhere else nearby, or at least, not done as well. Seems like H. Harper could do the same. For now, the pimento cheese sandwich, salad and tater tots couldn't convince me to put this on my list of dinner spots.

My partner assured me the tiny, ramshackle little building was certainly closed and not good for much more than a canvas for graffiti.

This is not Chicago style deep dish.  Their pizza is wrong and unappetizing.  \\n\\nRecently got back from a trip to Chicago and devoured far too many deep dishes.  I got hooked and needed a fix in Boston.  I thought Uno's must have good deep dish, after all, they invented it, right?\\n\\nWell, this pizza was a joke.  I complained, and the server was very apologetic.  I told him the crust was really unappetizing and I wondered why it had an odd texture and mouth-feel.  He let me know that it is par-cooked before being ordered, and then finished when the order is in.  He told me they had to do this or the cheese would stick to the pan (????).  I'm sure it is simply to increase table turnover.  Unfortunately, it makes the crust disgusting.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ate the pizza because we were absolutely starving.  We had just spent six hours in the garden and could not wait any longer.  The manager came over after speaking with the waiter and told me he heard I wasn't enjoying the pizza.  I told him what I told the waiter, and he apologized.  I asked why they partially cooked the crust as it completely ruins it, and he didn't answer directly.  He told me it is cooked thoroughly... I think he misheard me or was otherwise avoiding the question.  I told him I was not comfortable tipping for the meal because I really couldn't bring myself to pay more than I had to for a pizza that was truly sad (I would have sent the pizza back had I not been so hungry, and this wouldn't have been a problem).  I told him the service was great, but I can't shell out more money for this.  He told me it's not the waiters fault, which I understand. But I simply can't bring myself to pay 20% more for something that was terrible.\\n\\nThe manager comped the pizza, to my surprise.  He was very concerned that the waiter wasn't going to get a tip.  I gave the waiter a good tip and went on my way, glad to have not paid for that abomination.\\n\\nThe place is loud, pricey, serves TERRIBLE pizza.

(he says, as kool-aid man breaks through the wall).  homemade french fries are my achilles' heel in the kitchen, so it's hard to complain...but what the hell, i paid enough for these that i think i purchased complainin' rights.  soggy.  fries should never be soggy.\\n\\nat least the cask-conditioned mirror pond was all i was hoping for.  yay."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is great.  Went w/ another couple for HH.  Recommend calling ahead and getting a reservation on a weekend night.  Long wait.  Half off apps at HH were great.  We had the chunky queso w/ pork in it.  Highly recommend that.  Our entrees were all great.  My fiancee had a burger and that was very good.  I had the 5 cheese mac and chicken.  I loved it.  Heads up, big portions so be prepared for that. \\n\\nAll 4 of us walked away happy and fairly impressed.  Great selection on the menu.  Food didn't take long to come out.  Nice atmospher.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the waitress was spacy and pretty slow on getting our drink order and stuff like that.  Not a big deal though."},{"name":"Chi'Lantro","address":"11005 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"First time trying the kimchi fries here. Fully loaded with rib eye meat.

The woman working the register was downright rude.  My friend wanted to pay with cash and rude lady didn't have change.  She threw a fit.  My friend just awkwardly stood there, dumbfounded.  The food wasn't great.  The beef shwarma was good, but the rice was bland, hummus was mediocre, and instead of salad which is supposedly included on the shwarma plate, I got some canned green bean thing  (canned green beans -- ew).  There are other places to get Mediterranean food in Austin and many other places to eat downtown.

A friend forwarded a link to Hills on the Go, their new online shopping and delivery service.  I'm sold.  Free delivery for orders of $100 or more, $10 off your first online order, they actually were willing to come to my neighborhood without complaint, and no one complained about my $300+ order (I typically only shop once every 3-4 weeks).  \\n\\nYes, some of the prices were higher.  But many were lower.  The produce was beautiful and some of it lasted almost two weeks (green beans, peppers).  The hydroponic tomatoes grown here in Ohio were almost as good as what we grow in the summer.  Further, they try to provide Ohio goods, such as Snowdon Creamery and Smith milk products, Ohio chicken and beef, and their deli/pre-prepared foods are wonderful.  Between The Hills on the Go Market service, and the North Market, my grocery needs are handled with local merchants without having to deal with Kroger or Giant Eagle.  \\n\\nAmanda, the Online Store Manager, delivered the groceries herself, as she likes to meet her customers.   It was a nice touch!  \\n\\nMy only complaint?  The receipt is not itemized (i.e, it just says \\"groceries\\" or \\"meat\\" or \\"deli\\") so if you are trying to figure out if something is missing, it's too much work to figure it out.  It's a minor complaint in the bigger scheme of things.\\n\\nETA: I continue to use Hills on the Go, about every 6-8 weeks.  t's a great service for those of us who just don't like shopping."},{"name":"Soul Vegetarian No  2","address":"652 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"FYI, they plan on taking fried food off the menu :(.

I haven't eaten there in quite a while but the experience is still fresh in my mind.\\n\\nCanoe is situated on some beautiful property literally right on the edge of the Chattahoochee river and is surrounded by beautiful landscaping.  If you get there early, take a minute to walk around out there.  This time of year (March to May) has some of the best colors when everything is in bloom.  Inside, the decor is spacious, rustic modern with warm brick and old wood.\\n\\nThe food and service are equally tremendous.  The servers are some kind of dream team...extremely knowledgable, friendly and always on their \\"A\\" game.  Last time we were there, our server was great to deal with.  He also expertly de-boned a whole Snapper for my father-in-law in about 30 seconds with 2 spoons, like some kind of cross between McGuyver and a surgeon (nice entertainment value).\\n\\nThe dishes are beautifully prepared and include creative, top quality ingredients.  If you have a penchant for the unusual, you can often find it here - I've had Skate, Pheasant, and Rabbit which were all excellent. There are no holes in the menu, no matter what you like you will probably find it here in some form or another.  Portions are decently sized.  The wine list is expansive and overwhelming, so it's best to ask for assistance from one of the capable servers when choosing.\\n\\n5 stars.

This shouldn't be a surprise as the owners were once part of Sound Bites.  The food is very good but the menu isn't as big / interesting as Sound Bites.

The Cantonese fried noodles was in small portion. The sushi maki were good. Over all it's pricey with the small portions.
