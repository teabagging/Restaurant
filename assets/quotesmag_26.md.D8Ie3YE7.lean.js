I mostly go for brunch but also love the occasional Thursday Trivia night and Sunday dinner here. It's located in the bustling Town Brookhaven plaza, where you may have to circle the lot a few times to find a spot or just park further away like towards Newk's or Marshall's. On Saturdays and Sundays for brunch, there can be a wait so I recommend reservations through Yelp.\\n\\nI've never had a bad meal from here, they serve all your pub favorites with a southern flare. My brunch favorites are the Southerner and the Morningside Burger with unlimited mimosas and on Sunday evenings the fried chicken dinner is amazing. The wings are really good as is the Mac and cheese. Outside of the mimosas, the bar is pretty extensive which makes it one of my favorite places to watch a game. The list of bourbons on alone is at least a page long. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is great and both staff & patrons are friendly. I frequently dine solo and I always feel home here. Where hobnob misses at times is the service, this location is maybe 3x the size of the morningside location and they need to readjust their server & table schemes. At times your servers can get missing for 15-20 minutes because they're serving someone outside, plus your table to the far left and some tables to the far right of the restaurant.

Usually. But in some cases, I go to write a review and find that someone else has done a great job of summing up my experience. This is one of those cases, and my props go to Neil W. He pretty much nails it, with one caveat. I find the majority of the food is \\"pretty good\\" at its apex, but some elements do venture in to great. That said, here goes with my take:\\n\\nVindalho bills itself as \\"Spice Route Cuisine,\\" which primarily consists of Indian food, likely focusing on Northern Indian cuisine. The menu offers some fusion-y dishes, but for the most part, stays true to form with tandoori meat offerings, some curries, some dry curry stir fry dishes, naan, chutneys, cocktails, beer and wine. I had head so many conflicting things about this place, and had taken my sweet time coming in because I generally prefer to go for the more dirty/street/pungent form of Indian over the more dressed up stuff. Case in point, when in SF, I'll hit Shalimar or Lahore over Dosa any day. \\n\\nI finally had the opportunity to check this place out, and I'd have to say that while some elements were much better than expected, others were just as predicted, if not a little underwhelming. The down-side is that all of it came with a HEFTY price tag for the location, the size of portion, the type of cuisine, and everything else. I guess that's the price of accessibility. \\n\\nWe sampled some garlic naan ($4!!!) with the chutney triple-threat ($5!!), which is a choice of 3 chutneys from a menu of, what, 6? They definitely had some interesting chutneys on the list, and we went with a red chile (spicy and good!), a green cumin (mmmmm... I love cumin), and a rhubarb (whoa! Delicious!). Not only was the naan outstanding - rich and garlicky and floating in ghee, but the chutneys themselves were incredibly tasty. These were the two very impressive components of the meal, and got my hopes up for the following course. The chutneys were so good, we even ordered a second naan (at a grudging $4!!!) to sop the rest up. By this point, we'd had 2 pieces of bread and some dipping sauce, for $13. Even at this quality, in SE Portland, that's fucking ridiculous (I would say to the point of insulting, but I won't go quite that far - I know what I'm paying for, ad it's accessibility, a fancy open-kitchen setup, and some top flight chutneys). For the price, I think $7 for the chutneys and 2 pieces of Naan would be reasonable. Food cost on the naan is marginal.\\n\\nFor the mains, Hilary had the saag paneer, which was a different interpretation of the dish, featuring primarily a tomato base with some cooked spinach and some obviously house-made paneer. For an overwhelming $16 price tag, it was... in both of our opinions, merely ok. It could be due to the unexpected style of the dish (it's usually a creamed-spinach type of thing) and the price tag, but we were nonplussed. It looked delicious, but the flavors didn't back up the presentation. I sampled the madras lamb curry, which was served with some rice and was a whopping $19, making it the most I've ever paid for an Indian dish (even more than at Bombay Cricket Club!). The madras sauce was a salty brown coconut curry. It was decent-to-good, and had a solid depth to it, but lacked the pungent punch of most madras curries. For a reasonable price I would have been ok with it (not thrilled, just ok), but for $19, I was expecting to be wowed. \\n\\nAlong with these food items, we had 3 cocktails, me 2 local-vodka martinis at $10 each, and Hilary a bourbon ginger lemonade. In the end, after some naan, chutneys, 2 mains and 3 cocktails, we were presented with a $75 tab. It was at this point we were thankful to have in our possession a $50 gift card from a good friend (thanks! - you know who you are!), as it made the check more palatable. \\n\\nI'm going to be fair here and leave a 3-star review, because some elements did shine, and some of the flavors were carefully crafted and delicate (the chutneys) and the naan, while overpriced as all hell, was really good. I'm not a beginner to Indian food, so the accessibility of this place is lost on me. I'd prefer excellent food at a hole in the wall to just ok food in an excellent fancy dining room - especially when the former is less expensive. \\n\\nIf you're new to the flavors of the sub-continent, by all means, check this place out. If you do, try the chutneys. They're amazing. Bring $$$.

I went in to talk to the employees and expressed there are 38 people in front of us and I am not sure if we will get a table. The worker told me as long as my group is willing to sit separately, which is fine for us, we will be sat quickly. So, we waited in line for another 30 min, and guess what, when it was our chance to talk to the host, we were told the restaurant was full and we had to wait for an hour even if we are willing to separate our group. It was frustrating and when I expressed that I was misinformed, they started to deny whatever they said.

I'm admittedly on the snobby side of things when it comes to Ashkenazic (or faux Ashkenazic as the case may be) food. My grandfather was a bagel baker in Brooklyn. Yeah, I know I need to be a little more forgiving to places that are not back east, or actually Jewish, but I think Solly's can do a lot better. In fact, they have gone downhill over the years, and that is why I am writing this review. I have been a patron for about ten years and now am reluctant to recommend to anyone.\\n\\nThe challah french toast is sitting there in a pile with plastic wrap on top. If you were to order it, they would take a piece of this premade schlock and warm it for you.\\n\\nThe breakfast sandwich I had today was called \\"Loxxy\\" but it's not made with lox! It's made with hot-smoked salmon. That's like advertising something as proscuitto and giving you black forest ham. They should actually use lox, or just rename the sandwich instead of misleading the customer.\\n\\nThey don't use real eggs in these sandwiches, and then they go ahead and microwave the Eggbeaters. Gross. To mask their ethical infraction, they smother the whole sandwich in nondescript white cheese like we're not going to notice. A real disappointment to say the least.\\n\\nThe ruggalah has never been that good. It is dry.\\n\\nThe knishes are meh, tiny and doughy but in a pinch they can satisfy a nostalgic craving.\\n\\nI used to like the babka rolls, but today didn't buy one because they looked dry. Cinnamon rolls I think used to be better too.\\n\\nGiven there are no really good bagels outside of the bagel corridor back east, if you have a serious craving then Solly's might hit a note for you. Generally they have a chewy texture, but are on the sweet/Montreal side of things. And tiny, really tiny, good for small appetites I guess.\\n\\nExtensive menu, something for everyone but unfortunately hardly anything is executed well. It turns out they reheat a lot of their food. It's inexcusable to be cutting corners to the extent they do.\\n\\nService is poor. No one even acts enthusiastic about the product, and understandably so. There isn't much \\"love\\" in the food here. They are just heartlessly painting by numbers. \\n\\nIn sum, Solly's has lost its soul. They do not seem to care very much about quality. They are resting on a faux Ashkenazic schtick (at least play Klesmer music inside and really pimp it out!). There are hardly any Jewish ppl in Vancouver so perhaps they feel they can get away with it. Only if you are having a serious nostalgia craving, I would recommend a simple toasted bagel and cream cheese, a knish, or something similarly simple.\\n\\nCertainly avoid the piles of pre-made sadness and eggbeater abominations."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Went today for the first time based on reviews and this place was good!

He pulled up Yelp and searched for \\"greek restaurant.\\"  Among one of the first results that popped up was Olive Bistro.  Four stars, over 20 reviews, and close to our office -- good enough for me.  I rounded up a few others and off we went to lunch here at Olive Bistro.  We've eaten at Thai Diner and Tomo in the same shopping center and we'd seen this place before, so we were going to hit it up eventually.  One of my coworkers who lives nearby has been coming here for dinner over the past three years.\\n\\nThe restaurant is not very big.  I counted maybe 10 or 11 tables (for four) total.  The atmosphere is casual and somewhat intimate as the tables are placed closely next to one another.  The four-page menu is the same for both lunch and dinner.  They offer small plates (e.g. hummus, baba ghanoush, grape leaves), salads (e.g. Greek, tabbouleh), sandwiches and wraps (e.g. gyros), and entrees (e.g. mousaka).  They also offer platters, of which we ordered three.  Everything is served with soft pita.  Prices range from $5.99 (apps) to $14.99 (lamb kebab).  The platters are about $10 each.\\n\\nWe ordered a plate of hummus for the table.  It was very good.  Good consistency and not too oily or sour.  The pita was soft and heated, although I'm not sure if it was very fresh.  I ordered the Mediterranean platter, which gives you a choice of four items from the following:  falafel, hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, eggplant, Tuscan beans, Greek salad, and grape leaves.  If you choose the grape leaves, they add $2 onto your order.  Since we already had hummus at the table, I ordered the falafel, tabbouleh, eggplant, and Tuscan beans.\\n\\nJust like the hummus, the other items were pretty good.  According to the chalkboard outside, the AJC rated Olive Bistro's falafel as the best in Atlanta.  I haven't tried enough falafel to know what great falafel is supposed to taste like, but theirs were magnificent.  Crispy and crunchy on the outside, but soft, fluffy, and tasty on the inside.  If you could order only thing here, get the falafel.\\n\\nThe tabbouleh consists of parsley, tomatoes, cucumbers, scallions, cracked wheat, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic.  It was tangy.  The eggplant consisted of two big slices of eggplant marinated in olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic (see a recurring theme here?).  Delicious.  Finally, the Tuscan beans were marinated in the same stuff with a little bit of sun-dried tomatoes and spices on top.  These turned out better than I thought.  The beans were just drenched in olive oil and spices.  Yummy.\\n\\nService was great.  One important note: they do not separate checks here.  You either pay one bill for the entire table or you can split the total amount evenly amongst everyone at the table (that's what we did).  Parking can get tight in this busy shopping complex, but you shouldn't have a problem finding an open spot."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredible brunch experience.

I ordered the fried shrimp po boy, crawfish etouffee, and beignets. The po boy was a pretty standard po boy. The bread was warmed and soft which was a nice touch from the po boy's I usually eat. It was simple, but a quality po boy. The crawfish etouffee was delicious and they don't skimp on the crawfish. Every spoonful of it has a crawfish. I added some of their hot sauce to give it a little more flavor, but I'd still order it again. Everyone MUST get the beignets here. It is so good and amazing! I've had many beignets before at several different Cajun restaurants, including Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans, and by far, the beignets here are THE best! It's light and fluffy, so you don't feel like your eating dense dough. The best part about it is that it's somewhat flaky like a croissant. Weird right? But that's what's separates it from every other beignet I had. It's airy and fluffy with that extra light crunch.

I ordered the steakhouse sandwich and my girlfriend had the cheese dog. The steakhouse sandwich was what you would expect at Arby's. Cold roast beef slices and horseradish sauce on a bun. The worst part was the wooden board it came on which has black mould In the grain that I could scrape off in a paste with my knife.

My bestie and I decided to check out Jam on Hawthorne after reading its glowing Yelp reviews.  Like most brunch spots in Portland there was a line outside the door, but we didn't mind waiting the 45 minutes that the staff estimated for the two of us.  Therefore, we went to get coffee nearby and when we came back half an hour later we learned that they had already called our name.  Yet, instead of putting our name on the bottom of the list and wait again, the staff said they would get us in, which was super nice of them!  I can't say enough great things about the customer service here, including our server who helped us throughout our brunch. \\n\\nThough, food was just satisfactory for me, unfortunately.  I ordered Ty's Big Breakfast and shared a Maddie Cake with my friend.  Before the food I had a lavender mimosa, which was solid.  I do recommend getting a cocktail here, as they're known for that here, including the several different flavored mimosas.  After trying to order the prickly pear mimosa they had sold out, so get it while you can!  \\n\\nThe Ty's Big Breakfast tasted bland.  The plate came with hashbrowns, veggie sausage and you can substitute the standard english muffin for the biscuits and gravy for an additional fee, which is what I did.  I did like the veggie sausage a lot more than I expected, especially since it was a fried patty, so had a nice crunch to it.  And the fluffy biscuits were yummy, as they bake them here.  However, everything else didn't have much flavor, so I felt like I had to add salt, pepper and lots of hot sauce to eat with.  The gravy is vegetarian, so perhaps I'm used to a sausage gravy, which has tons of flavor.  But the veggie gravy was super light and didn't taste like it was seasoned at all.  I was craving the sausage gravy the entire time.  The hashbrowns were also surprisingly bland as well, so had to put on lots of hot sauce.  I just wish that I had enjoyed my dish more, especially since I was really set on the biscuits and gravy with hashbrowns, which is primarily why I ordered Ty's Big Breakfast.  The Maddie Cake I shared with my friend was A-OK.  It's made with lemon and ricotta, but couldn't taste much of either ingredient.  Yet, the housemade jam that it came with was fantastic!  I wished I had ordered biscuits and jam, just to have more and more of these wonderful items that really shined far above the rest of everything else I ate. \\n\\nI can see why Jam on Hawthorne is popular, especially for vegetarians and vegans, as it offers a lot of options for them.  But for this carnivore, I was craving certain flavors that I anticipated with the items I ordered.  Something always felt amiss.

The red sangria is awesome if you want something more refreshing. We came here last night with 4 friends who hadn't been here before. They were all very impressed with the service and ambiance and all of our plates were clean at the end of the night! Our server Mike T. was awesome! He was funny, friendly, attentive, and informative about the menu options. Very very professional and we had fun with him. We started with the cheese plate (all 5 were great), the avocado stuffed with goat cheese, and the patatas brava. A perfect amount of tapas to split before the main event. I tried the Zuzuela for my entree which is a seafood stew. It was amazing. Our friends ordered the filet and veggie paella. Both of those looked fantastic too.

The white woman in the car next to me asked for cigarettes and money from us. \\nAnyway, if the food was excellent, maybe I would venture here but the food was just not good. I had blackened chicken. It was tasteless, was not blackened or even seasoned and was sitting in a pool of tomato tasting water. I'm not into tasteless waterlogged chicken. The dirty rice is made with chicken livers instead of sausage so I didn't get it but got the \\"cajun rice\\" which was spicy in an almost good way. I got the potatoes which were also borderline okay.\\nThe place itself looked like it should be condemned it was so dirty and run down. The woman who helped us was not the least bit friendly but sold us food out of what seemed like obligation.\\nI did not feel welcomed. We have eaten in all kinds of places and all kinds of areas and people are typically welcoming but not here."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Best barbecue restaurant in the area!

My friend ordered the Lamb Shank."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"So this place doesn't really need the reviews, but I figured, since i'm still enjoying it years and years later from the time I first tried it, I'd shoot them some praise. Thurman's is clearly one of the most well known restaurants in Columbus, you see it on TV shows like Man Vs. Food and all kinds of burger specials, but this place offers so much more than the burgers.\\n\\nFirst off, the staff here is awesome. Most of them have been here forever, and they're great to talk to, especially if you can get a bar spot. They're busy as hell but will still find time to engage you in conversation. There's normally no way around it unless you're lucky (which I have been a couple times now), you're going to wait, but the staff along with the food makes it worth it. If you don't need a table, the bar is open seating and is usually my go-to. Most people are showing up with large parties, because they want to show everyone a Columbus staple, so they don't usually sit at the bar.\\n\\nSecond, anyone that says the burgers here really aren't that great, is just full of shit. I'm sorry. Yes, they are big, and yes, they may fall apart on you, but the meat is pretty damn good quality and is seasoned very nicely. There's so many different types of burgers, it's hard to find something you won't like if you're looking for burgers. If people are saying the burgers are whatever, I'm guessing they've either just hyped this place up to beyond anything you could hope for, or they're jaded Columbus natives. I don't know, maybe I'm being a bit too harsh.\\n\\nBesides the burgers, I pretty much all of the standard bar appetizers, but you should definitely try the homemade cheesy poblano bites, because they're so amazingly cheesy and flavorful that I could probably eat them until I puked.\\n\\nAnd my favorite thing on the menu here are the wings. The burgers are great, but these wings are cooked perfectly, and the hot buffalo sauce is one of the best sauces I've had anywhere. It's addictive. You get a full wing here, so the best way to tackle them is to just crack off the drumstick with a quick twist. I haven't had a bad flavor of wings here, so I highly suggest giving them a shot.\\n\\nI didn't want to make this review too long, since most everyone knows everything they need to know about Thurman's but apparently I rambled. I just wanted to remind everyone that this place still rocks, and there's a reason it still has a crazy wait decade after decade. If you haven't been, and you live here, because people say it's overrated, you need to go. In my opinion, I still think they have great food and one of the best bar atmospheres in town."},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Ordered the Bronzini and as I tried to figure out how to de-skin and de-none it, our waiter Anthony comes by and says \\" oh....

I flew from California and looked at restaurants near airport. Came across this place and I was excited to try it. Saw the ratings and thought it was a must. I ordered clam chowder which I would give 3/5 . Very watery and needed more seasoning. I was expecting better. I believe Sizzlers has a better clam chowder. I also ordered the crab claw 3/5 . Don't go in there expecting it will be the best crab claw you'll ever have. You'll be slightly disappointed. Last item, lobster roll 4/5 . It was good, but needed some seasoning/salt. Luckily, I was able to end on a better note. Maybe it's a bit overhyped or people that have been there have never had clam chowder, crab legs, oyster, or lobster rolls anywhere else in the US. Over all, service was good, food was okay compared to what I've had at other restaurants. A person next to me coincidentally shared the same opinion since we ordered similar items. He said, \\"It wasn't what I expected. Thought it would be better. I've had better in Florida and California.\\" A group of people leaving also commented, \\"We thought food was ok.

We expected this after reading yelp reviews, but all my friends who have visited/lived in Portland recommended this place so we were determined to stay. \\n\\nThe wait wasn't too bad as the famous Powell's bookstore was a block away, and so was Stumptown coffee and Bluestar donuts.

I don't like dishes that are too creamy or cheesy-- they make me feel queesy, but this dish is SO DELICIOUS. It's like cornbread heaven with fluffy eggs and super well-cooked steak. Not too blood and not too well-done. This was my partners order.... but low key should have ordered it for myself. \\n\\nI ordered the Korean chicken since it seemed like a popular item here. I was hesitant at first since I am an actual Korean person that enjoys Korean friend chicken... I didn't want to be disappointed by some overpriced, white-washed food. But to my surprise, it was pretty good. It tasted like Korean-Chinese saucy fried chicken and the batter wasn't overwhelming the actual meat, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to fried chicken. The short-grain rice was well cooked and they added some korean style pickles and kimchi. Although it wasn't totally authentic, they served as yummy compliments! I have definitely tasted much worse kimchi and this wasn't too bad. \\n\\nWe also had the raddicchio salad. It was good but I'm not used to eating cold bacon. It also a little salty for my tasting-- probably from all the cheese. This actually might taste good hot.... but who knows. \\n\\nLastly, we got a side of fries. These fries were actually really crispy and hot! Which is how I like it. There was a good amount of seasoning and the sauce that came with reminded me of the special sauce from In n Out in CA.

If you go on cruises this is the new normal too since folks do not tip so much anymore REGARDLESS of the service.  I guess it's more like the Spain attitude where one does not give tips.

My father has been in love with the Jambalaya here forever. Every time he wanted it or tried to recreate it he would say 'It's not quite like Tibby's' So last week, I made sure we could go. I had the √©touff√©e with both crawfish and shrimp and it was incredible. I'll mention it more but we also took a bread pudding to go and had a bite before we left. I nearly melted.

But the staff was really kind, saw our situation and got us a really convenient table pretty quick. Then we had the nicest waitress, Marissa. When you're dealing with a wheelchair and oxygen, people tend to stare or treat you funny. She was so nice. She even made sure when dad asked her to set aside a bread pudding for us, that there was one left. \\n\\nHere is the part that really got me. I hadn't planned on the air conditioning being so cold and my dad is thin so he was really having a tough time. Another waitress, Katie, came over to give us our drinks and I told her I had a silly question, did they have anyone in the back with a blanket, or a table cloth, dad was cold. She brought us some extra linens but then said she had an idea and had to ask her manager. Turns out they have a decorative Fireman's jacket hanging up, and the manager said it was ok to take it down and drape it over my dad to keep him warm.\\n\\nThere are busy, popular places all over with great food that don't feel the need to do anything extra to make their guests' time any better.

Cultivate Food and Coffee is a full restaurant and coffee experience, they're opened 7 days a week from 8 to 3. Weekdays they serve breakfast and lunch then the offer a brunch menu on the weekends. Their pretty busy on weekends so I definitely recommend making a reservation on open table or if you have a large party.

Totally my fault, I should have asked more details about the item before ordering. For $9 you get about 7 meatballs with peach pepper jelly and blueberry compote. The sauces were absolutely delicious, I just didn't want meatballs for brunch. \\n*I also had the Rumchata French toast because I love rumchata and French toast so it sounded perfect. The side berries were fresh and sweet and I would have been fine with a bowl of them...lol, the syrup was also served on the side and hot.

Not only are you on the 30th floor overlooking the beauty of Portland, but you'll be guaranteed to be satisfied with whatever you're ordering on the menu. My husband and I usually come to here for dinner which is spectacular, but this time around we went for their HH. I was sure surprised to see so many people here already. Without a reservation I asked the host if my husband and I can get a window seat and she happily accommodated that request which was great. \\n\\nMac and Cheese: 4/5.  can definitely say that I am truly the biggest Mac and cheese fan and something about this dish didn't meet up to my standards.

We had a fabulous time hiking in Columbia River Gorge and sipping world-class pinot noir wines in the famed Willamette Valley. I picked Oregon in part because of Portland's dining scene that I was hoping to explore with Jun. In the past several years, Portland, with its fresh ingredients from Oregon and cheaper costs compared to larger cities elsewhere in the U.S., has really blossomed into a culinary destination. Given that we had only four nights, I had to be pretty picky with the restaurants we were going to visit. What I didn't realize at the time, though, was we would end up having a very good meal at a restaurant completely outside of my radar, and during brunch hours. On our first day in the city, we met with a friend of mine and his wife. My friend asked that we join him at 10 a.m. at Tasty n Alder, with a note that we will likely have to wait a little bit. I didn't believe him at first; even on the day before the Fourth of July, would that many people actually turn up for an early meal? It turned out that not only my friend was right and Tasty n Alder was really a place worth waiting for.\\n\\nThe brunch menu at Tasty n Alder doesn't look that special at first, with a mix of American classics with twists here and there. When Jun and I tried the restaurant's house buttermilk biscuit (accompanied by honey butter), however, I found out that the kitchen's execution of these seemingly boring dishes was actually quite masterful. I couldn't remember having an omelette dish in recent months as good as the one called California Dreamin' at the restaurant, the mix of chorizo, potatoes, peppers and cheese made one fine combination underneath the egg. My friend guaranteed that we would like a soft savory baked egg bread pudding that goes by the name \\"whole toad\\" and he was absolutely right; the silky smooth texture of this dish with well-balanced flavor was made me rethink about how much of a delicious food you can make out of eggs. The side dish of mustard braised cabbage was also wonderful in its own right, and I was very impressed with the juicy texture of skirt steak in the Cowboy Breakfast dish that was a playful take on Mexican breakfast, with baked beans and salsa.\\n\\nThe restaurant doesn't take reservations and as noted above, Tasty n Alder is quite popular with local Portlandians, so come early and be prepared to wait at nearby cafes. There are some brunch cocktail options (Jun and I both enjoyed a bourbon-based concoction called Kentucky Peach that was close to bellini) that would go well with the meal. The casual neighborhood vibe of the dining space is another plus to having a very satisfying meal at the restaurant. Tasty n Alder shows that a brunch menu doesn't have to be pedestrian; Jun and I really loved the way the restaurant presented its dishes in an honest and soulful manner without a ton of flash. As you'll see in future reviews of other Portland restaurants that I had actually picked, it was one of the best meals we had had together in Portland."},{"name":"Nick's Pizza & Subs","address":"65 Granite St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"I am beyond pissed off at Nick's Pizza.

The buffet size was huge, it covered a good amount of space and there were several options to pick from, fried foods, sushi, a bar in the back with food that can be cooked on request. They also had their dessert bar to choose from and eat, so no lacking in the amount of food they provided. The environment was Asian cultured, and very serene. They have a large koy pond in the front of the restaurant, however, one of them had conveniently died right in the front, and had yet to be taken care of. Imagine having your kid telling you \\"look, one of them is dead.\\"\\nCons outweighed the Pros, the actual taste of the buffet missed the mark for me at this location. They had plenty of food, but it was either cold or did not taste very good. little to no seasoning, more so it had just been prepared and put out for however long. The bathrooms were not cleaned, and there was water everywhere, one of my biggest eww moments is when bathroom water is everywhere I'm a huge germaphobe in bathrooms.  The pricing was also steeps, KIDS DO NOT EAT FREE, they literally have a wall, with heights on it, if your child is a certain height they pay a certain price, imagine having an abnormally tall 3-4 year old like myself, he was literally an inch away from having to pay the price of an adult, despite him not eating nearly as much as an actual adult. Shame.... The service was also very poor, not only did the host engage in two arguments with our party, she also offended another party later on that night, this must be something that has been habitually allowed, but yeah that's my review on this place, the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because I liked the decorations minus the dead fish in their pond."},{"name":"Rose & Crown Dining Room","address":"1510 N Avenue Of The Stars","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I've been here many times and I'm sad to say this may be the last. \\n\\nIf you have a dining plan this is a fine choice. \\n\\nIf you're paying a la carte you'll see that it's not a good value.

Very cool. \\nBoyfriend enjoyed the mussels and said the sauce was pretty good.

I ordered my blue cheese burger Rare and while I understand a rare burger is supposed to be basically uncooked, it was like they put the burger on cooktop for 5 seconds on each side. It was completely raw. Normally, I wouldn't say anything, however, the two people I was with ordered their burgers Medium Rare and both burgers were completely overcooked, beyond well done.  No pink at all. Nothing. The burgers were also terribly salty and there was no flavor at all. Salt beyond reason. Because all three of us had serious problems with our food, I felt like I should write a review-especially since things have not been improving in recent visits. My friend ordered onion rings and they had no flavor and were cold. The fried exterior of the onion ring was thick and overly crunchy, and I could hardly see any onion, let alone taste any onion inside at all. Lastly, the blue cheese dressing tasted terribly tangy and was missing chunks of blue cheese, of any kind-I couldn't find any! The point of the blue cheese burger is the blue cheese! In the past I have overlooked the fact that the blue cheese burger was not topped with blue cheese crumbles, because the dressing was not bad. But at this point, I find the blue cheese burger to be a waste of time. The dressing is horrible and there is no blue cheese! I have such high expectations for this place, and am so disappointed to report that it was sub par at best.

Eventually a dude shows up.  \\"How you doing man?  I just need a little under half a pound of American cheese please.\\" I say in my best best JP \\"community is important\\" voice.  \\"No. We not got the American jeese right now.\\"\\n\\nA haze of red descended over my eyes as I inspected the deli case.  It looks like a deli case from a post-apocalyptic movie in which scavengers are trying to put society back together and they don't have much.  Like one half of a deli ham, a the end of some bologna, and a football helmet, and a light bulb with the price listed in cigarettes next to each one written in coal. Seriously, they almost nothing in there.  Hilariously they have a sandwich menu in back of the counter, I suppose no matter what I ordered I would probably end up with an open faced mayonnaise and bologna water sando.\\n\\nAll the produce looks like it went five rounds with Mike Tyson.  Like it was punished for being there.  \\n\\nWhat do they have? Shit no one could possibly want.  It's as if the owner just thought of stuff he liked and got a million of those.  They for some reason have 30 types of chicken sausages, 87 types of disgusting frozen burritos, \\"scoop your own spices\\", and a zillion types of bulk granola.  No almonds when you need them but granola out the ass in every flavor.  They have some monstrous machine that with purify your water that I've never seen used that I stare at while waiting for Godot at the deli counter.  Don't worry though, it's usually broken if you wanted to anyway.\\n\\nAlso, for some reason, you often can't get cash back at one or both of the registers.  They don't explain why.  I assume it's because they have no money.\\n\\nDrive to the moon for what you need.  There is a better chance of it being there.  I've had it with people giving this place a pass because it's \\"local\\".  I don't care.  Give me a place with things in it.  The best part of my trip here is the little jolt of elation when they ask at the register \\"Are you a member?\\" and I get to say \\"No.\\""},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We had a very bad experience at this restaurant.

Also a delicious light chanterelle / corn dish with a hint of spice from poblano pepper. Summer squash / harissa / corn - all good.  Lamb t-bone - got a large which is 3 (vs 2) and wagyu bavette with nice chimichurri accompanying - tender and flavorful. Another favorite - duck duck potatoes - I presume it was a duck egg that we cracked the yolk over the potatoes which again presume (not sure) fried in duck fat - perhaps the best potato dish I have ever had.

He even talked about how it would be more worth it for us - so you can tell he was really there to provide a good experience for all the customers.\\n\\nFood: \\nJambalaya, Crawfish Pie & Chicken File Gumbo:  The crawfish pie was delicious and is a great dish to eat before you try your cheesecake. The Chicken file gumbo was thick and you could tell it had been cooked for a while with skill generous portions of meat, veggies and a spoonful just explodes in your mouth. \\nAndouille Sausage Jambalaya: The jambalaya was huge. Like a pot of rice huge. the generous portions spices and sausage were delicious. I believe there were celery bits from what I can remember.\\nSouthern Drippin Chicken Sandwich:  The dish is very savory, flavorful and juicy! It's not oily but when you cut into it you can see the juices leaking on the knife. Not one of the dishes I was looking at but a dark horse in it's own right!\\nChicken and Waffles: The chicken was crispy and flavorful and the waffle had a very sweet batter - my brother really enjoyed his dish. The sauce is syrupy and thick, a bit like a caramel/Hershey sauce consistency. Goes great with the beignets as well! \\nShrimp and Alligator Cheesecake: The main reason I wanted to come, boy was it worth the hype. We wanted to order another to take home to California but we weren't sure if we could bring it. The cheesecake is tender, melt in your mouth - my mom said \\" taste like chicken\\" I tastes a bit of cream cheese but it is so smooth you would have no idea it was alligator. It is a bit small, but it is a filling portion nevertheless, I'm just greedy and want the whole cake! Can't be topped in my opinion. \\nSweet Tea:  Great, and I believe they have free refills (correct me if I'm wrong) \\nBeignets: Sweet, chewy, fluffy dough covered in powdered sugar, would go great with a warm coffee or maybe hot cocoa. We got a tip from our server to keep our sauce from the Chicken and Waffles and to coat it on the beignets. It was delicious and a great tip!\\n\\n(I would recommend the grits or I've heard many good things about the Rita's Chicken or Pork Tenderloin Cutlets.) \\n\\nIf you get a chance, I say stop by. Tibby's is an attraction all on its own in Orlando.  \\n\\nMay the odds ever be in your flavor, \\nMarilyn"},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Umm, Bonzo Cake anyone??

I can truly appreciate a restaurant that gives a little extra attention to the dessert department as it is so often an after thought. We have been there for Lunch, Dinner and Brunch many times and they are always great. Their brunch is my favorite. They serve what I consider to be on of the best biscuits in town (not the best, that spot is reseved for another special buttery temptress in Buckhead) and they serve a free bakery basket filled with them and muffins. Honestly I could go home happy after said basket and a cup of coffee but no brunch in complete without some great egg dishes, thick bacon and taters. They hit all the marks.

While the flavors are not bad and the interior interesting, I think overall it just doesn't deliver. \\n\\nThe music was a bit too overwhelming and loud for the space. We liked the fact that the crawfish were large and they tasted like the Live option that we could get at Shaking Crab but portions are both smaller and more expensive than the comparable restaurants (Loui Loui and shaking crab). The shrimp were definitely better quality at Shaking Crab. The sauce is a bit too creamy and otherwise doesn't have the spice factor that they have. \\n\\nBrussel Sprouts/Cauliflower were tasty and tangy (probably our favorite dish from here) but again rather small portioned. Seafood Etouffee had wayyy too much rice proportional relative to the sauce. Also wish it had a bit more substance to it given the fact that it was $16. \\n\\nFinally, at the end of the night, we were randomly charged for an even more expensive meal. They admitted it was a mistake when we pointed it out and fixed it... but still didn't really improve the experience at all. Overall, I'd say that you'd be paying probably 25-50% more here for a comparable meal at Shaking Crab... and we came out still hungry from Bootleg.

You pick your base, your vegetables, your proteins, and finally your sauce and people pour oil into a container. I chose their six choice option (two bases, two vegetables, two proteins, and one sauce). I had as my base options the rice and the kale. My vegetables were mushrooms and broccoli. Proteins were steak (for $1.50 more) and grilled chicken. For my sauce, I had the white ginger sauce.\\n\\nThe meal was relatively healthy and not bad. My plate was $9.99 plus the $1.50 extra for the steak option. It does seem they like to upcharge for what they deem \\"extras\\". In the competitive restaurant field, that could make or break them. Especially in the mall, where there are literally dozens of other choices.\\n\\nLike I said, it wasn't bad, but the meat did seem to be overly salted and the rest of the choices seemed lackluster.

The hash browns were seasoned well, and the CHEESE GRITS omg. So good. The biscuits and muffins they serve are also delicious, and the coffee menu is great. Their cold brew is SO good.\\"\\nAnd most of this still stands. That dish I ordered was good, and the cheese grits are still amazing. I forgot to write this in my last post, but the biscuit and homemade muffins that they bring out before serving the main dishes are also delicious. The accompanying jams and butters that they serve alongside them pair really well. However, I've ordered the cold brew two more times since that initial review, and it's not as great as I remembered it. Was a huge waste of $5 because the second and third time ordering it, I didn't finish them. Somehow, it had a dishwater-y taste; it's weird. Their lunch menu is also not nearly as good as their brunch menu. To be honest, I didn't think their lunch menu was that good at all. I ordered a flatbread, and after eating it I was still hungry and didn't think it was worth the high price. I would come again if someone asked to come here specifically for brunch, but I wouldn't necessarily choose to come again."},{"name":"FoMu","address":"481 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"What an awesome place!!

It reminds me of restaurants in Hong Kong. The space is large, and can easily accommodate larger groups. \\n\\nThe menu has a lot of traditional Taiwanese dishes, but more of a stir fry category than your typical bubble tea joints with the chicken nuggets. There's no noodle soup here either. Hot tea was served right away.\\n\\nWe ordered a plate of deep fried oysters, Taiwanese fried noodles, and marinated pork intestine. \\n\\nI love the fried oysters. For all you oyster fans, this is one of the better fried oysters I've had. The batter is light, it's sprinkled with a tasty seasoning, and it's just done right. The noodles were ok, nothing outstanding. The pork intestine, which arrived much later, are also delicious. There's a hint of sesame oil flavour, and the addition of the green onion and the cilantro ties it all in. For an appetizer, it was a really good sized portion. \\n\\nThey don't serve bubble tea here, instead, they are licensed. The drink menu consists of various Taiwanese beers, sake, and wine. \\n\\nIt's a good place to come with friends and share a whole bunch of dishes, since they're not overly large. One thing to keep in mind is that they play loud top 40s music, so it may deter your overall experience here."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"131 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Joanne Chang is my hero.

Her sticky buns beat Bobby's so for a while that's all I got...until about a year ago, when Flour came out with their butter breton!!! What is a butter breton, you ask? Imagine a buttery, yeasty brioche. Now think of a flaky, crispy crusted croissant. If those two had a love child, enrobed in gorgeous caramel and browned butter...it's name would be Butter Breton. Flour does it right - if for some reason your butter breton comes out cool, you can ask them to toast it up for 10 seconds and it will be perfect. \\n\\nOther favorites include the Creme br√ªl√©e, croissant (especially when fresh out of the oven), sticky bun (only if you like sugar and all things good), and banana bread but you could make that one yourself.

Parking is available, but not ample. If you are close enough to walk, I would suggest you do. If you are looking for a place to hang out with friends, watch the game, and have a few cold ones, this is the perfect place for you.

It was mayhem at the market, and both of them did an excellent job getting orders, being courteous, and even checking in periodically on the bar dining customers. \\n\\nNow, onto the food. Overall, I'd probably stick w/ pho elsewhere.  IMO, no one should be paying over $10 to eat a small pho in a plastic bowl, with a plastic spoon, with condiments tumbling out of a plastic bag (although I give them credit for almost perfectly portioning out the right amount of condiments, no more, no less). Actually I'm not sure anyone should be paying to eat pho in plastic, even if it's less than $10. But that's a separate debate. I did feel that it changes the way heat distributes in the dish, which affects the preservation of heat and also the ability to keep \\"cooking\\" the parts of raw meat. And that for me makes for a \\"meh\\".\\n\\nHowever, it's not horrible or completely unacceptable. If anyone is stuck in that part of town, can't make it up to Buford for dinner, and is just dying to have pho--it IS an option.

I liked the busboy's Halloween costume, which had blood-drenched vampire stakes sticking out of his shirt.  Industrial doom music roared from the sound system.\\n\\nI had never been here before, and considering other reviews I have read about long wait times, I was extremely surprised when I came here around one o'clock on Halloween afternoon to find only one other table occupied, which was a boisterous group of young gals that in their exuberance, managed to knock a glass of Coke halfway across the room.  I was also surprised how small Jam was.\\n\\nAt this time of the day, there was a plethora of wraps and scrambles available, but only a couple sandwiches.  I went with \\"The Bizness\\" ($9.25) corned beef sandwich.  It took a long time for my sandwich to arrive, but still, service was very good with my sweet waitress and busboy checking in on me a couple times.\\n\\nFirst off, the Bizness sandwich is huge. You eat this baby with a knife and fork.  Inside the marbled rye bread is Jam's specialty corned beef, a stretchy white cheese, fried egg, a spread (1000 island dressing?) and bits of sauteed red onion.  Corned beef has a pungent flavor and is definitely an acquired taste.  The corned beef on my sandwich was rather dry, and in fact, some of it was down right crusty and crunchy.\\n\\nServed along with the sandwich were hash browns.  The hash browns here reminded me of the quote \\"Pizza is like sex.  When it is good, it's really good.  When it's bad, it's still pretty good\\".  I feel the same way about hash browns.  I've never met hash browns that I had to turn down, so even though Jam's hash browns were pretty dry, I ate them.\\n\\nOverall, Jam is OK.

Such is the case with this Burger King.\\n\\nRecently renovated, I give this store props for being modern, relatively clean and having the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, as well as friendly cashiers.\\n\\nMy issue is the frequency in which orders are prepared wrong by the back-line staff who either are not paying attention because they are too busy goofing off and horse-playing with one another. I understand Burger King's concept of freshness- having it your way means waiting a REASONABLE amount of time for your orders, but it's totally ridiculous to have to wait nearly 10 minutes only to get your order and find that it's prepared totally different than your specifications.  I mean, what's so hard about leaving cheese OFF a burger??? If anything, it should be easier- it saves you,as a harried cook, an extra step. Last night, I was standing behind a gentleman that had to send his burger back 3 times because the cook and the cashier were not communicating.  I checked my order thoroughly (after having to wait nearly 15 minutes for a Whopper with just lettuce, mayo and ketchup, an order of onion rings and a stand-alone order of Chicken Fries, because this BK has a long history with me of making orders wrong or forgetting to put them in the bag altogether. For this reason, I never use the drive-thru.\\n\\nBe that as it may, when I got home and tried to actually eat the food, I had a hard time. The burger was dry and tasteless, the onion rings had a freezer-burnt taste to them and the chicken fries were greasy and way overcooked, to the point of being burnt. I have never been so disappointed in BK before. Yes, I'll do the survey but at this point, you can keep the free Whopper if it's going to taste like what I was served during this visit. Uggh!!!!\\n\\nMy advice would be to employ older, more responsible cooks who respect their jobs enough not to cuss loudly in front of customers.

My last criticism is that they don't respond well to questions or asks for accommodations. Was picking up snacks for a meeting and asked if they happened to have anything gluten free, boy was this woman unhappy with my question. I was also hung up on recently for asking if they do donations, I got \\"you have to come in in person\\" click.

Our server was patient with us and left us alone for the first ten minutes while we exchanged gifts.  Our table ordered two of the trout specials and the HALF portion of the Tournedos and we each started with a cup of the french onion soup.  \\n\\nWe all enjoyed our soup, it's too bad we didn't stop there.  The entrees arrived and the plates with the trout were HOT.  Bad sign.  I think the plates sat beneath the heat lamp long enough to dry out the fish but not long enough to cook the RAW potatoes.  The tournedos portion was HUGE and I suspected it was the full size even though the half size was ordered.  I was right and we were charged for the full size.\\n\\nWe thought it was time for dessert but the waiter thought otherwise and asked if we would all be on one check.  He brought dessert menus after I inquired.  Two of us shared the chocolate lava cake which was brought out with a melted scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The apple tart was delivered no less than five minutes after we received the lava cake.  I guess we will eat in shifts.  Bizarre.\\n\\nWell, that was all she wrote.

The chicken Karaage was pretty good.  Hot fresh and crispy! Pretty tasty!  As for the ramen, the first thing I noticed was that the ramen soup was not hot!  It was lukewarm at best.  The restaurant was pretty empty and they did not seem like they had to rush so there was no good reason to have a lukewarm bowl of soup!\\n\\nThe broth itself was average.  I find the broth at Marutama Ramen much better;  the broth has a full body taste!  The broth at Kokoro Ramen is weak and tastes watered down.  It is not very flavourful!\\n\\nAlso, I appreciate our waitress telling us that if we want tea it's an extra charge.  Nice of her!  What does that tell you?  It tells you that the waitress knows tea at Japanese restaurants are usually free!  She didn't want us to be pissed when we see that the 5 of us had to pay an extra $7 for having tea with our meal!  Sorry, but if you're going to offer tea at a restaurant make it free otherwise don't bother offering it! \\n\\nMy sister got a Groupon for this place so I guess we kind of got a deal.  Still I'm not too interested in returning to Kokoro Ramen soon!  There are just too many good ramen places in the city that offer a tastier and better meal!"},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"7907 120th Street","city":"Delta","stars":"4","text":"Food is consistently subpar compared to other locations.

Our server took our order within a reasonable amount of time. However, he was NOT friendly and was of zero help with narrowing down choices on the menu. Our drinks came out quickly (with half being in disposable plastic cups), and that ended the best part of the service. I lost track of how long it took our food to arrive. Let's put it this way; the crowded restaurant was empty by the time we started eating. The elderly lady at the table next to us must have sensed our frustration as she leaned over and reassured us that the food was worth the wait. THEN, my husband's breakfast didn't arrive at the table until the other three of us were more than half way done eating. The food, however, was DELICIOUS!

When we got there, we saw that it was fairly empty and asked if we could just eat it in the restaurant then. The guy helping us looked to be like he was the bartender. He was extremely accommodating and allowed us to sit in.\\n\\nDespite ordering the pizza online at 1:32 pm (and receiving a confirmation email letting us know that it would be ready for pick up at 1:52 pm), we did not receive our pizza until 2:15 pm. The bartender looked like he was the only guy running around seating incoming customers, getting their orders, making their drinks and dropping off bills though, so my husband and I weren't too concerned with the slower than usual service. \\n\\nAt one point, I did notice a female server pop out from the kitchen with some food. It was then that I realized that these two must be the only ones working today. It was dreadful watching the two struggle to keep up together. A few people definitely cancelled their orders and walked out. \\n\\nDespite the friendly bartender, I have to give this place 1* for their lack of management, how our food turned out (our pizza and wings tasted like they had been sitting under the warmer for ages.... seriously disappointing), and the service we received from the other server on the floor.\\n\\nThe female server who was working on Sunday, Sept 18 was extremely rude. The bartender was out on the other side of the restaurant helping other customers, so as this lady was walking by me, I asked her \\"When you have a moment, could get a refill on a coke, as well as the bill?\\". She simply looked at me and told me to flag down the other guy because she was busy and not our server. I'm astounded. \\n\\nWe did eventually get what we asked for from the bartender, but I felt so bad for him. He was four times more efficient than this lady and far better at his job than she was. At one point, there was a father and son waiting at the front, and she told him to go help them. Literally said \\"What are you doing? There's people waiting up front. Go seat them\\". He asked her if she was seeing him just standing around and said that he had to get these other orders out. She simply snapped back and said \\"I'm NOT a server. I'm an expo.\\" so he gave up on her and went to seat the father and son duo. \\n\\nAt this point, I felt super unwelcome and wanted to get out of there. I paid in cash instead of waiting for the machine, and left. I hope the bartender got to keep all the tip we left him. I'd be livid if he had to split it with the other lady.\\n\\nTo top that all off, there were spilled drinks on the ground. No attempt to clean it up had been made the entire time we were there. Drinks, complete with ice cubes were left on the ground with no warning slippery floor signs in sight. Oh, and of course, as we are getting ready to walk out, I spot the manager doing nothing but holding menus. He finally peeked out from I don't even know where.

We both ordered a Filet Mignon entree. My table-mate had a nicely cooked charred Filet. Though mine was ordered Medium Rare, it came out with a heavy black char (much heavier than the other plate). Once I tasted it and started to really cut into it, I realized that this char was more of a burn. The steak was cooked so quickly on the grill that it went from Well-Done on the outside to Rare on the inside. \\n\\nI brought this to the attention of our server who, instead of apologizing, provided me with a well rehearsed answer on how their steaks are charred.

How many customers have to complain about the food (see other Yelp reviews) before you rehearse an answer that contains a percentage char?...\\n\\nI understand that your proteins are charred, but mine was burnt. I can look past the issue of the food, but I cannot look past being argued with by both the server and the manager. On a $34 Steak entree, it should be cooked in a way that the customer is pleased. I don't think even the manager or the server, given the opportunity to try my entree, would be happy with it were it their own order. This ignores the overcooked, bland pasta side that was also on the plate - wouldn't recommend that either.\\n\\nOur reservation was made via the American Express Concierge, and I have informed them of our negative experience.

I took a chance because I saw that Little Bird was billed as a \\"bistro\\" and was open as early as 5 on Sunday.\\n\\nThey were very accommodating, even though we were walk-ins.  We got seated within 5 minutes at a 2-top near the front of the restaurant. I shared the cheese plate, and followed it with the duck confit which was cooked excellently. Succulent duck falling off the bone served over lentils which were not too hard or soft (al dente?). My son actually enjoyed the gruyere crepe and his Pellegrino. The first wine I had which was a Chote du Rhone was only so-so, but the Burgandy I had after that was fantastic (I suppose that's the $5 price differential per glass).\\n\\nThe plates weren't \\"small\\", but they were sized just right enough that we both had room for dessert. We had a dessert that's billed as a \\"Hazelnut-Milk Chocolate Financier\\" - which basically means a dense cake somewhere between a muffin and a flourless chocolate cake. It was topped by branded cherries and accompanied by praline ice cream and some chocolate sauce on the plate. Totally worth it - and not an \\"afterthought\\" like many dessert menus.\\n\\nThis space reminds me a little of Le Pichet and Cafe Presse in Seattle, if you know those as a reference. It feels busy and neighborhoody, but not like an American or English style pub or sandwich place. Even the bathroom has a fun \\"little bird\\" decoration on the wall (looks like a flock of birds flying up the wall) that I thought was a nice touch.\\n\\nIf I could give it 6 stars I would, because our server (Brienne?) was so nice to us and checked in at just the right intervals, and even managed to charm my kid a little."},{"name":"Gin Thai Brasserie","address":"3176 NW 185th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best green curry in pdx area, and I've tried many.

The soy sauce flavor just didn't come through.  Crab fried rice had shells in it and the cracked black pepper flavor that used to pop no longer was there and the rice did not have the shine it used to.

The driver arrived, looked like he had been to hell and back (literally).  We tipped him because it wasn't his fault, he was grateful and we sent him back with the pizza (in this time we had ordered from somewhere else, and picked it up).  The DRIVER was the one who recommended that we call the store manager because the manager on duty has had problems with employees, customers, other managers, etc etc.  The store manager called the following monday and we were given a 20 dollar credit.

Most of the reviews for this place are raving about the awesome breakfast/brunch experience had. Dinner is another story... \\n\\nSETTING\\n-Ambiance is quite lovely, although a little dark on the eyes. Think dark and candle-lit.\\n-Friendly staff, but for some reason, our waitress told us that their menu was \\"family styled.\\" Immediately we thought of larger portions to share, right?\\n-Food is cooked in the same shared space where you are seated, so afterwards your clothes will take that smell home with you :(\\n\\nMENU\\n-Kobe beef is not worth it. It was super small (smaller than the size of my hand) and basically amounted to $10/bite size piece. I know it was kobe, but remember the waitress told us that everything was family portioned? Being hungry and ordering unsatisfying expensive food hurts.\\n-Hush puppies. Meh. Most of the reviews are highly favorable on Yelp. I expected something amazing and this did not live up to the hype. The jalapeno butter was probably the best part.\\n-Brussel sprouts. Another disappointment. Too saucey, sadly plated (see picture). The dish looks half-eaten, but that's how our \\"family style\\" dish came out. The reason why I kept eating this was because 1) I was hungry and 2) the drink we ordered was extremely, well to put it gently, it tasted like nasty medicine.\\n-We ordered the \\"Bravest Bull\\" (fino sherry, aperol, imue bittersweet vermouth, peychaud's bitters) and it was EXTREMELY bitter. I deeply regretted that we chose to order this expensive \\"bottled cocktail to share.\\" It came in a bottle, and yes there was enough to pour out several small cocktails to go around... but this time nobody wanted it.\\n\\nSo yeah, we were still super hungry, and so we ordered three more dishes...\\n\\n-Sauteed Spinach. This was actually quite tasty. It included prunes, shallots, and almonds. Portion was still small, but I would recommend this.\\n-Cedar Plank Salmon!!! Yes!! This was the one highlight of our disappointing dinner. The salmon is seared on top of a cedar plank and they bring it out to you that way. The cedar smells wonderful and I admit that it is a pretty cool presentation. But note, it's a tiny 3x3 inch slab of salmon. \\n-Fresh Pasta (smoked beef ragu). Super salty!! Despite being hungry, we couldn't finish it. I would not recommend.\\n\\nIn the end we paid a pricey tab and left to walk back to our hotel. That's when we realized how smelly our clothes were. Looking back, I think this whole experience could have been avoided if the lady that seated us DIDN'T tell us that this place served family -styled dishes for sharing. This place served regular to small dishes - which can be expected for fancy pricey restaurants. \\n\\nWe didn't order any dessert.

For an appetizer I chose the UK cheese platter. This came with crackers and three slices of cheese-Cotswold, Stilton and Irish cheddar each of which were complimented with jam, caramelized onions or cauliflower. I know the compliments sound a little weird but mixed with the cheese and crackers it all made sense! For my entree, I went for it! Grilled New York strip steak and fried fish. The streak was seasoned and cooked to perfection! Absolutely melt in your mouth and sitting on a bed of green beans. The Jameson Irish Whiskey peppercorn sauce was a great compliment and I need to purchase it. Then a large piece of fried fish and tartar sauce along with Yorkshire pudding. The pudding is actually mashed potatoes loaded with cheese in a pasty bowl. It was so much food but it was so good! Dessert was the only let down. I ordered the Jaffa tarts but it was like a dry chocolate covered cake with a teeny tiny orange creme center with the same amount of raspberry sauce decorating the plate.

When you get in line they immediately try to figure out how many people are in your party. I guess technically we were a party of 6, but only 3 of us were going to order food. The other 3 people in my party were just going to keep us company while we waiting in the 45 minute line. When I got to the counter, I immediately tried to explain why I didn't think it was right for us to be charged a gratuity tip because only 3 people were buying food. The cashier cut me off trying to low-key guilt me by saying, \\"the tip goes to a lot of people behind the scenes like cleaners blah blah,\\" and that I'm technically \\"buying into the culture.\\" She then did a series of things that I thought was unprofessional and abnormal. \\n1. She never once told the three people ordering what their total was. She simply just swiped their cards and they had no idea how much they were being charged... we found out later.. that for one plate of pasta each person who paid for their food with a card got charged an extra $7. Thankfully because I paid in cash they only took whatever my change technically was.\\n2. They didn't give us receipts, so we had no idea what we were being charged for... this screwed us over later because they ended up charging people extra for the second paper plate needed for people sharing meals and for a scoop of cheese (that we didn't asked for nor were we told we were going to be charged for). \\n3. Ultimately, the way we were talked to was really unprofessional. I feel like we had some valid points of concern. I don't think it's right to enforce a 6 party gratuity tip on 3 people. I don't think it's right to not be transparent on what we are being charged for. I don't think it's right to talk down to people when they're confused about the gratuity tip policy.

Where do you go, you may ask? I have to suggest Tasty n Adler.\\n\\nKnown mostly as a brunch place, Tasty n Adler is a hipster fusion type restaurant that offers very high quality dishes and rare cuts of beef. Unfortunately, we missed the lunch experience and so we couldn't check out their kimchee chicken or their steak and eggs.\\n\\nHowever, dinner is also an experience as well. We came around 7 pm (no reservation) and put our name down. Apparently, it would be a 2 hour wait. Yep, TWO HOUR WAIT on a Saturday night. I guess when your restaurant has over 1k reviews and orgasmic pictures to go along with it, people will flock all over.\\n\\nA little more than 2.5 hours later, we were seated. Their menu is pretty standard for a New American restaurant. You have your list of small sampler plates, your steak, and your drinks. The cool thing about this place is that it's 1: a tapas bar, meaning that things are meant to be shared and 2: there's also cheese plates too!\\n\\nIn regards to the tapas experience, the waitresses really emphasize the aspect of sharing. It got to be a bit excessive but I guess that's their way of encouraging you to spend more. \\n\\nSo we basically ordered a number of dishes. First, we got the Radicchio salad, which is basically slabs of bacon, egg, and some lettuce and also got the octopus (very pricy imo) Then we all ordered a number of main dishes. I got the wagyu cut beef and some of us also ordered the cowboy steak, scallops, and the flat iron wagyu cut. \\n\\n# Radicchio salad\\nA lot of people actually recommend this starter. It's very simple with a number of ingredients, but in my opinion it's definitely not worth it. For one thing, the bacon was a bit overcooked, too thick, and not crunchy at all. In addition, the egg just didn't work well with the taste of the salad. Please pass on this. \\n\\n# Octopus\\nGrilled octopus was amazing! It's pretty much one arm of a large octopus that's grilled with olives and garlic. This is a must try and share, although it's very pricy (like $17-18).\\n\\n# Meats\\nFirst, the wagyu steak was probably one of the best cuts I have ever heard. For those who don't know, wagyu is a rare cut of beef, the 2nd best quality cut you can get behind Kobe beef. For $25, you get the juiciest 6 oz piece of meat you will EVER, EVER have. The great thing about Wagyu is that it literally melts in your mouth.\\n\\nSecond, the flat iron was also considered a wagyu cut as well but the way they cut it is a bit different. Generally, the flat iron is a bigger cut and so it's slightly tougher. I recommend just paying the premium and get the wagyu.\\n\\nCowboy steak is very similar to the above but you get a tortilla, less meat, and some beans.\\n\\n# Scallop\\nScallops were also extremely bomb! You only get two big pieces, but they are well worth it. The sauce that accompanies it is a perfect addition.\\n\\nOverall, Tasty n Adler is tasty in heaven. The atmosphere is hip and intimate (dim lighting, close quarters), and the service is decent. You should definitely come check this place out!\\n\\nEat well and prosper,"},{"name":"Kkoki Korean BBQ","address":"10325 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I've been craving Korean BBQ & this place hit the spot!!

It was a Friday night during Restaurant Week so it was a little loud and I really had to project to talk to my husband over dinner but you take the good with the bad I guess ;) The service was okay, again I'm guessing probably due to it being Restaurant Week and our server maybe having been a little overwhelmed. The accessible entrance is also through the patio with a small step but nothing unmanageable - someone said they had a ramp but, honestly, in the amount of time it would've taken them to find it and set it up, it likely would've taken way longer than it took for me to just lift my husband's wheelchair over the little lip. We've done much harder :) \\n\\nAs for our meal, I had the pork chops off the restaurant week menu, which were good. I was not a fan of the sweet potato hash they were served on so I skipped them since they weren't willing to sub them out for anything else. However, the real star of the show was my husband's meal, which was the Vieiras. For my non-Spanish speaking friends, vieiras are scallops and my hubby ordered it at the recommendation of our waiter who informed us it is their signature dish, unchanged for over 2 decades. Y'all I have had scallops in Miami (FL) multiple times in my lifetime and have always, always been disappointed. I've never for the life of me been able to understand what all the hoopla is about when it comes to scallops. To me they're like little sandy sea morsels and I just don't get why anyone would want to have them...until I had Barcelona's and I finally understood THIS must be what scallops are supposed to be like! They are cooked to perfection with a soft texture and buttery taste in an indescribably delicious creamy sauce that I could've drank with a straw. I was/am obsessed. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the tres leches but what actually came out was a lemon raspberry bar. I'm not too picky so I sampled it but it was not palatable. It was tough and dry, a fluke I'm sure. We informed our waiter of the error and he quickly fixed it. The tres leches, though, that was on point! Oh so delicious! If you don't know what a tres leches is, it's a dessert made with evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream - obviously not a good choice if you're lactose intolerant. But if you aren't, Barcelona is the place to try it! It was the perfect way to finish our meal. To be fair, we will be back when it's not Restaurant Week and you bet I'm ordering the vieiras next time!"},{"name":"Golden Drops Caf√©","address":"1788 Clairmont Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"What a CL MCModern building.next door to Emory!

Located right near the highway, this South End restaurant dishes out their take on Cajun style seafood dishes. On a side note, they allowed for reservations on Yelp which was a huge plus! \\n\\nFood:\\nMussels - We ordered the mussels with the Moonshine sauce which is essentially a white wine garlic sauce. You can definitely taste the booze in this sauce! If you aren't drinking, just get buzzed from eating this. The sauce was delicious and most of the mussels were quite plump. The bread served on the side was nicely toasted and mopped up the sauce really well. \\n\\nSmashed cucumbers - The name might be a bit misleading as it isn't really smashed like what you'd get as a cold side dish from Shanghainese restaurants. These are cut into rather small pieces and taste like they were quick pickled. They were quite sour but were really refreshing between bites of seafood.\\n\\nClam/Shrimp Combo - For this combo we opted for the Bootleg sauce which is their version of the house Cajun sauce. It comes standard with corn and small potatoes. Both the clams and shrimps (head on) were really fresh. The sauce was loaded with garlic, cooked down to release their natural sweetness. It also had decent amount of heat that built up as you ate as well as a nice sour kick that I do not taste in other Cajun seafood restaurants in the area. \\n\\nAside from all this, there are also happy hour specials that you can get while sitting at the bar. Everything that we had above cake to around $70 after tips. Not too bad for Boston and a night with a seafood meal."},{"name":"Aprisa Mexican Cuisine","address":"2311 SE 8th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"FB. No, not Facebook. Fat Behavior.

The fact that the roll came with fries was an added bonus (who doesn't love fries?). Assessment of the lobster roll: I love how they don't drench the the lobster in mayo bor butter so you could taste the fresh lobster flavor. The bread was yummy too. After you eat a few bites, it does start to feel heavy in my stomach...not necessarily from the lobster but the combo of the buttery bread, lobster, and the fries. I'm one of those people that get queasy when I consume too much seafood in one sitting so that is why it felt heavy.

It was $31 made with a very meaty melted buttery portion in the most delicious roll they get from Iggy's which is known for their bread. I had a choice of having it with fries or an arugula baby salad. It was a smart move having salad. Prior to that, I had the most delicious selection of oysters from all parts of New England mostly Massachusetts and Maine. They have a really good selection of white wine and all I can say about their Seafood is FRESH! I'm not sure if I would wait that long again but eating here was definitely something that I wanted to do for the past few years!\\n\\nBecause this place was popular, sometimes you're seated with people at the regular tables. It was so funny, we chatted with this young couple who was on a first date... Certainly made dining experience more entertaining. They obviously previewed what we were eating so they ended up ordering the lobster roll, but with fries. I believe they were fresh cut fries but I can't confirm that. Leaving the restaurant, and seeing people wait patiently for their table, they whispered, \\"What's good here?\\" I responded, \\" I waited 1 hour for a lobster roll.\\""},{"name":"Which Wich","address":"804 Town Blvd, Ste A1035, Town Brookhaven","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Love this place, staff is nice and helpful.

If anyone is 40 minutes late for their job you know what happens? They get fired! If you look at grubhub they have terrible reviews because the driver is always late and the owners do not care! It's damn near commendable how bad the delivery is. Imagine that! If you're hungry I suggest you either go there yourself or you pick another place- because they will not deliver to you on time.

Well, no food showed up, no apologies were given, no alternatives were given. 50 minutes later, we had to personally urge her to just pack our order to go because we had to start the post lunch seminar session. We walked out of this place with hot food paid with full price - couple of us were able to sneak in the lunch sitting in the back of seminar room but I could manage to eat my cold half of the sandwich only 3 hours later with the remaining cold half and fries drenched in condensation destined for garbage can. I know restaurants can get busy at lunch time, but it would have shown integrity if the restaurant staff had been truthful in telling us that our order would not be served while we waited - we would have gone to Subway next door. They should have also given us a discount along with a sincere apology. The veggie panini was only mediocre after sitting for three hours. I probably would not go here again.

That scallops had a brown color, not like being saut√©ed, but looked like they had been dipped in something. They tasted alright and fresh, they just looked weird. The vegetables surrounding the bland mashed potatoes were the best thing on the plate. Two pieces of soggy bread were stuck in the potatoes. The bacon microbrew cream reduction was merely some sort of watery sauce with no hint of bacon flavor or any flavor for that matter. \\n\\nMy husband's fish and chips were nothing spectacular. We've had much better other places. He described the homemade ketchup as runny tomatoes with sugar. I tried it and agreed. \\n\\nWhile we were eating, a small fly was hanging overhead that I kept having to swat away. I guess that fly problem from another review hasn't been taken care of yet. \\n\\nI doubt we will come back here again as we live a good ways away.

It reminded me of some early-aughts Dogfish Head beers (Au Courant, especially) that seemed to be made deliberately unpalatable just for the hipster appeal. No thanks.\\n\\nHere's the kicker: when I asked what kind of hops were in the decent IPA, I was told \\"We are not allowed to tell you that\\". That answer is a death knell for this place. A company policy of *not* talking about the beer with eager customers (your FUTURE PROMOTERS!) is so far out of touch with the craft beer movement that I wonder if these guys really have any clue at all. Every brewery I go to, I talk about the beers with the staff, and they are always eager to engage an excited customer who is obviously looking to spread the good word about their beers.

The chicken thigh was moist and perfectly breaded and it came on a nice bun with coleslaw and pickles. I would have expected the chicken to be a bit spicier but I loved it nonetheless.\\n\\nAs is customary when I go to brunch, we also got a bunch of \\"sweets\\" for the table: the beignets (warm and delicious) and two versions of the souffle pancakes which are these 1-1.5\\" thick fluffy, eggy pancakes: the chocolate hazelnut and the bananas foster. The bananas foster was far superior to the chocolate hazelnut so if you're choosing between those two, go for the former. We also got a \\"homie fries\\" for the table to share which was a nice savory to share (think home fries with cheese).\\n\\nAll in, including tax and tip, it came out to $30/person which I thought was a deal given the quality and quantity of the food.

We ended up ordering the burger and chicken sandwich with a side of fries. After a short wait, the food arrived and we dug in. The burger patty was thin and packed an intense amount of flavor. The chicken was thick and juicy, with a generous amount of spicy gochujang-mayonnaise spread on top. The waffle fries were crispy and delicious. All for under $20. In short, everything was spectacular.\\n\\nTo top it off, as we were about to leave, we were presented a single KFC drumstick to see how we liked it. It was accompanied by a gochujang sauce and a homemade blue cheese sauce. It's probably not surprising at this point to find out that the wing was excellent as well. It's no Domu wing, but it's not trying to be; the light, crispy outer layer is more similar to a tempura batter and the gochujang sauce gives it spicier edge that pairs extremely well with the cool, not-overwhelmingly-blue-cheese-flavored blue cheese. Again, just spectacular, and next time I'll happily order a full serving.\\n\\nPerhaps the best part about Big Time Street Food is the location; now I don't have to drunkenly stumble around Lake Eola to get some great food after a night of drinking at The Falcon -- I can just drunkenly stumble a few feet away and eat some grub that rivals the best that downtown Orlando has to offer.

When the soup came out, the bowls were different sizes and the worker gave it to only one of the people at my table whom she expected to help her pass around the table.  After the soup, the same thing happened with our rice plates: she gave it to one person expecting him to pass it to the rest of us.  \\n\\nThe quality of the food is always enjoyable there, but during eating it was somewhat awkward and quiet as we were all kind of pissed at the service.  After we all finished, we waited there awkwardly for her to clean up or do anything really.

I typed \\"Chima Atlanta\\" and I get this as the third link. \\n\\nAnyway, today I was fairly hungry and bored. I had been on a fairly conservative diet for the last few weeks, but today I decided to go all out. \\n\\nFor starts, I was in a real mood for meat. Second, I worked out earlier, so I want protein in mass quantities.\\n\\nSo I looked up Chima (because I kept seeing the name on the bus advertisements and I don't want to drive all the way to Sandy Springs to get to Caro De Boi.) on my iphone. . .   and couldn't view it. Silly site was in flash, which my iPhone doesn't support. So I drove to the place, not knowing fully what to expect.\\n\\nThere is valet parking out in front, but I opted to park a couple of houses down to their private lot.  At around 6:30, it wasn't full. which is good for me (Even so, if it was full, looks like you can park near the Sports Authority parking lot) . From that point, I walked and head inside the restaurant.\\n\\nNow if you have been to Brazilian steakhouses before, you know the drill:\\n\\n1) Get your sides from the salad bar.\\n2) Turn your card up for service.\\n3) Wait for Gauchos to swarm towards you like a herd of wilder beasts on the run, offering you all sorts of meaty goodness.\\n4) When you have enough, turn your card down.\\n5) Wait for the bill to arrive so you can weep over how much you just spent.\\n\\nIn that respect, Chima is not too different from other Brazilian steak houses (notably Fogo de Chau). That said, there are a number of things that stand out about this place:\\n\\n- The interior is big. Very big, in fact. From what I can tell, this allows you to have a more intimate dinner with whoever you are with (as opposed to Fogo de Chau, where the crowd can be a bit overwhelming at times).\\n- The customer service is great - they do follow up to see how you are doing and explain to you what the dishes are. In fact, it seems every 5-10 minutes, somebody stops to check on you - to the point that it seems that you are ready to scream \\"I AM ALRIGHT, GOSH DARNIT! NOW LEAVE ME TO MY MEAT!\\" \\n\\nNote to Chima: Remember, your customers have sharp knives. Think about it.\\n\\n- Back to interior: There is a large bar where you can go in and have yourself a drink, etc, do things that single people in Atlanta apparently do (I'm single myself, but I don't do bars. I mean, what's the point?). Then too, you can reserve specific rooms for special events (in this case, when I was there, there was a birthday party in one room and a bunch of Buckhead Brats^H^H^H^H younglin^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H teens apparently meeting before a prom in another room.\\n\\nAs for the food - their salad was great and meat, as usually, was well flavored and tasty. Unfortunately, I feel into the trap once again of eating too much of the sides, so I don't think I tried all the meats (darn you, gauchos!)\\n\\nAs for the price . . .  it's pricy. In fact, my whole dinner (drink, main course, dessert) came out to about 61+ dollars. (ouch).\\n\\nSo from the bottom of my heart (well, stomach, actually), I recommend this place. It'll be a bit of a hit on your wallet as well as your tummy, but its  worth it. :)"},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I work in downtown Boston and was looking for a cheap good Thai spot to grab a quick meal without waiting too long.

This is a responsible, clean after yourself establishment which I think all restaurants should be like. Make sure you place all your utensils in the appropriate area and clean up after yourself so the next person sitting doesn't have to. \\n\\nThe Reggie: It is the safe, no brainer option to me. Fair price with a great amount of ingredients to keep you satisfied.

Sorry to other \\"foodies\\", but I happen to like coming to this spot on special occasions. Sure, $9 for a beverage, large plate of pasta, a salad, and dessert might be better spent making pasta at home, but come on. For $9 you can't even buy two fast food value meals, so there is definitely a good deal here on the food. In fact, my favorite dish here - and the only one I'll eat - is the brown butter with mizithra cheese. I fully credit OSF with bringing mizithra cheese to Atlanta. It's a wonderful cheese, but before it exploded onto the scene here, there wasn't a store that would carry it. Not even Dekalb Farmer's Market always has it, and if they don't always carry it, you know it's a real treat. It's since become more prominent, but I still owe my gratitude to OSF for even carrying it in the first place. Kudos!\\n\\nI always get the balsamic vinaigrette  salad, vanilla ice cream, and hot tea with my meal. Again, for $8-10 (depending on what pasta you choose), this really is a good deal if you want to go out and eat. Servers are almost always friendly, and the bar drinks aren't so bad either. I love the decor as well, with the fancy chandeliers and the trolley car in the middle of the room. It's a fun spot for a birthday or a night out with family, and having been a patron for many long years, I can't be a sheep and say 1 star with an honest face.

It is their incompetence that they didn't have the correct protocol to check if a driver's license is real or fake, and our friend had to pay the price for it. Needless to say, our night was ruined, but also, it is a huge inconvenience to our friend to get the license replaced on an urgent basis.

We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated right away but had to wait for almost 15 minutes before our drink order was taken, and the restaurant was nowhere near full or super busy.  My roommate had to order a refill beer three times before the waitress brought the drink.

I placed an order for a meal that I wanted to deliver to a friend who just had twins, but I found out that the day I wanted it delivered (the day on the Care Calendar that was my designated day to bring her food) was not a day the Soup Peddler delivered in her area. Well, I thought, that's fine. I'll just pick it up. It was not, turns out, that simple. \\n\\nNo one could find my order when I went to pick it up, and I was told that I must have \\"accidentally\\" placed the order at another location and that I must go there for my order. So, idiot that I am, I got back in my car to go retrieve my order. I searched the area, but could find nothing at that location, and so I called the Soup Peddler number to verify the information. I only got voice mail, so I had to return to the original location to voice my dismay at being sent on this wild goose chase. Back at the original location, I talked to the manager on the phone, who blamed me for the mix-up by saying that I had, perhaps, used a gift certificate. When I told him that I had not, he told his employee to give me my order (which I had previously placed and paid for online). Even then the order could not be completed because they did not have the dessert that I ordered. Although they apologized, at no time did anyone offer me a rain check. The next day the manager called to apologize and to try to get to the bottom of the issue and try to remove blame from Soup Peddler. Turns out they had filed my order under the name of my friend to whom I had originally wanted the order sent (thus, in the manager's mind, making the incident no longer their fault). Here's the thing, though. If the order had been there all along (they did ask me what I had ordered), then why didn't they just let me have it to begin with? And then why, if they HAD my order all along, did they NOT have the dessert I ordered? I was left with the impression that they had given my order to someone else and wanted to blame that on me.

We put it off for a bit because we were afraid it would be too much of a tourist trap, but wow, were we wrong. It definitely has a reputation, and was packed even though we went during the week. The downside is they don't take reservations, but the surrounding area is cute so we just walked around a bit while we waited. We also opted to sit at the bar, which may have shortened our wait time a bit as well. \\nThe oysters were on point. After having oysters in Boston at a couple places I really might not eat them again outside this city. There is such a huge taste difference between locally caught/fresh oysters and the ones you'd find at an inland restaurant. Also, the oyster bar is set up in their front window so if you're sitting at the bar it's a lot of fun to people-watch. \\nThe clam chowder...my god. That clam chowder is at the top of my list. It's the only one I've ever had that legit tasted homemade. It states on the menu that it's made to order and it really does taste like it. It's a little soupier than most clam chowders, but does not lack in flavor in the slightest. So good. \\nI decided to try a lobster roll for the first time ever at this restaurant, which was both a good and bad decision. It was good, because that's some of the best lobster I've ever had, and it was bad because it's probably ruined all other future lobsters rolls for me. We got both the hot and cold versions so we could try each, but be warned because the portions are huge! Neither of us could finish ours and had to take some home. I'd recommend getting it with the salad instead of fries because it's lighter and cuts through the richness of all that lobster meat. I also preferred the warm version, but to each their own.

I fished all the noodles and pork out to eat and packed the broth up to bring home...I was able to water it down for THREE noodle meals. As with their other restaurants, the chef who establishes the recipes is VERY liberal with the salt, so be warned.

We met with our server, who flipped his card on the table, and didn't see him for another 20 minutes, to take our drink orders.  After he came back, another 15 minutes, he brought the bottle of wine, off the list that they are renowned for, but had to be reminded 10 minutes later that another person was missing their diet soda.  2 people in the party ordered the \\"Chef\\"s Tasting\\" menu (60$ a person) for their dinner and the others ordered off the menu.  10 more minutes passed, and our server came back with a chef \\"special\\" relish pre-appetizer.  We thought that was cool. Then another 10 minutes had passed and we had to call our server over and ask for the bread that they had been placing on all of the other tables as the filler-trust me, you need the bread.  When he brought the bread out, he asked the others to go over their orders, because he couldn't read his writing-no lie.  \\nSo, our dinner starts being served.  The chef's tasting came in courses 1 & 2 at the same time. The others received their appetizers.  Very non-descript.  Then the rest of the meal arrived- course 3 & 4 at the same time. The veal from the tasting was over-seasoned and tough, and the paella that others ordered looked like overcooked rice-a-roni.  None of us complained to the server, because at that point what did it matter.\\nThe final course on the tasting was a chocolate cake with cream sauce- which was good, we think, or it could have been from hunger from the lack of food at this point (the portions are laughable).  A person in the party ordered a normal coffee while the rest were enjoying dessert.  After 10 minutes, our server came out and said the coffee was still brewing and would be right out.

When I my friend got his mimosa, it had a small hair in it, I saw it right away when the server brought it to us and requested him to change it. Also, they are supposed to bring out complimentary bread at the beginning and we saw all the tables getting it right when they were being seated but we didn't get ours until all the other food arrived an hour later \\n\\nSecond problem was that we asked for scrambled eggs but they served us over medium, my best friend then had to wait for the food for a while. When they finally got back with the food, this time there was no gravy. But the first time we got the food, there was gravy. I clearly asked the server to give us all non pork items because I can't eat pork, he did say they have chicken sausage gravy.

I was really angry but trying to keep it together because I know what bacon bits look like and my friend and the server verified it, then he said the manager said to take it off of the check.

It's a short walk to the place. Came here for Saturday brunch with friends around 11ish and it was already packed with folks inside and out. I'd assumed all the folks in your party must be present when seated because the hostess asked if everyone was here prior to taking my name. Since we were all here, we were seated almost immediately. Our waiter came over to welcome us to Murphy's and take drink orders. They have a good selection of drinks including a great wine selection but since we were there during brunch, we stuck with the usual breakfast cocktails. Two of us ordered Berry Bellinis and one ordered a Mimosa. He mentioned a Grand Mimosa which has with the same ingredients but with a shot of Grand Marnier that I want to come back for. I ordered the special of the day which was a Pork Hash. It came with braised pork, hash browns and eggs with a green salsa. One person ordered the crab cake Benedict and I can't remember what the other ordered.  All I know is the one that ordered the Benedict scrapped her plate clean! Haha! My food was ok.

The drinks were served in the equivalence of dollar store glasses, so were the napkins (they were like washrags).  Our appetizers then arrived - we had the baba ganoush and the stuffed grape leaves (my favorite typically).  The baba ganoush had great flavor but the stuffed grape leaves were frozen and tasted ALOT like what you find at Costco in the frozen foods.

The food was okay, but $13.99 for a solo cup margarita was a ripoff.  Usually the margaritas are in nice glasses and very good, but on Cinco de Mayo they are a ripoff.  Try this place for your self on a regular day, but on Cinco de Mayo go somewhere else."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Tasty N Alder serves a more higher end brunch than most brunch places in Portland. They offer a unique twist to traditional omelettes, benedicts, and donuts. They even have an extensive wine menu. Tasty N Alder is a family style brunch menu so the food will not come out all at once. Instead, each dish comes with a large fork/spoon to serve and share. \\n\\nOpen face omelette with fried oysters - 4/5 The fried oysters with the omelette was an outstanding combination. The crispy texture of the fried oyster paired with the sweet creamy egg was just amazing. The biscuit was flaky and buttery. Portland really does the biscuits justice here. The smoked meat on the other hand was incredibly salty. I would ask for no pork next time. The creme sauce on top was garlicky and paired nicely with the omelette, however it was also very salty. It would be better if the sauce came on the side. \\n\\nQuiche lorraine - 5/5 This quiche was fantastic- the eggs were rich and creamy. The gruyere cheese was very prominent in the dish and complemented the bacon well. The crust was very flaky and buttery. \\n\\nSteak & cheddar eggs - 4/5 The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The edges had a nice sear to them with the inside very juicy. The steaks were topped with sea salt and a slice of butter. The eggs were overwhelmingly salty as well- perhaps too much cheese. The cornmeal pancake was chewy, warm, and gooey. It resembled much of a corn bread taste in my opinion. It was definitely interesting and helped balance the salty cheddar eggs. \\n\\nTasty N Alder nails food presentation and food quality but could definitely improve on lowering the amount of salt in their food. 2 out of the 3 dishes we ordered were way too salty and we drank 3-4 cups of water each to bear the taste. The prices are a bit steep for brunch with a $20 steak and egg plate that only includes 3 small pieces of steak. Most of the dishes are at least $10. The total for breakfast for 2 added up to $45 which is a almost double than what I would normally pay. However, the dining experience and service was excellent truly demonstrating a finer dining restaurant than most brunch places. The decor, demeanor of waitresses, and presentation of food definitely reflects the prices here."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't make it down here that often, but when I do, I always leave stuffed to the gills.  My most recent visit was with my mom, right after she had surgery.  Apparently, she's just like me (or I suppose I'm just like her), and we always wake up from anesthesia absolutely starving and wanting nothing to do with whatever bland, mild, soupy foods the doctors recommend.  Nope, we go for grease, meat, spice, and lots of cheese.\\n\\nThis time Mom ordered some kind of egg thing with lots of cheese and veggies, and she immediately dumped a whole bowl of salsa on top.  Maybe it was an omelet...I'm not a fan, so I'm not really sure.  I got chicken enchiladas smothered in queso -- and a nice bowl of queso as an appetizer, since you can never have too much cheese.  The food was awesome, I thought it was adorable that the waitress recognized my mom and was super patient with her (she's indecisive and confused on a good day), and I was surprised we didn't have too much of a wait to get seated.\\n\\nI'm kind of torn about my rating here, though.  The thing is that I hate the parking situation -- very limited, and you'll get towed in a heartbeat if you try to park in a nearby store's lot.  And I hate the wait and all the noise.  There's this small area near the host stand where people practically sit on top of each other and step on each other's toes, and when that fills up in about 5 seconds, everyone else perches along the sidewalk leading to the door.  So basically, getting inside requires walking a gauntlet of really hungry people.   It's awkward.  And the noise level inside is definitely loud, which is a drawback for me.\\n\\nBut the food is excellent, the service has always been good, and the menu has a nice mix of weird Austin and standard recipes.  It's a great place to stop in if you have some extra time and don't mind the crowd."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"39 John F Kennedy St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I'll start with the bad, then do the good.\\n\\nI strongly suggest not ordering ahead at this location.

Totally worth the trip and the wait. Now that we find ourselves north more often, we go to the Delaware location, but try to find our way here when it's not busting at the seams.\\n\\nEven on an early Sunday evening, a 45 minute wait is normal.

The host staff are great about getting people in and through.\\n\\nWe were quoted 45 minutes, and were sat at the bar in 30. They have domestic beers, with some more high-falutin' beers on draft. That'll be the easiest decision you'll make, I'm pretty sure. The menu is massive, there are tons of burger options (of course), chicken, fish, reubens, roast beef, subs, PIZZA, salads, soup, and even gyros. Tons of side options - they have my favorite cole slaw in town, and I highly recommend the Macedonian fries - thick cut fries smothered in onions, banana peppers, feta cheese and tzaztiki sauce. Sounds weird, tastes great.\\n\\nANYWAY. I can't eat beef, but the spouse can. Typically, he mows through a Thurman burger, fries, and a beer. This time, he got a jack and cheese burger, and it was great. The burgers here are not fancy, but the quality is high and they cook them the way you want them. I got the fried bologna and onion rings, both of which hit the spot. The sandwich held up as a leftover, according to the spouse.\\n\\nIn addition to being a great place to eat, the staff is friendly and helpful all the way around. The Browns were in OT while we were there, and some of the commentary and loud noise was from behind the bar, too.\\n\\nWhile it is crowded, be sure to look around, up and down to see all the neat/cool/retro stuff among the dollar bills.\\n\\nAlways look forward to every Thurman's visit!"},{"name":"The Ginger Man","address":"148 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"They have a great selection of craft beers on tap and whiskey's here.

The portioning was less than I expected, with a single piece of fish.

Food was delicious! \\n\\nWe got the Pad Kaprow, Som Tom, and Mango Sticky Rice. The spice level was very satisfying in the Pad Kaprow, but not quite enough to pack a strong punch. The pork was tasty, but a little on the salty side (or it could be the amount of fish sauce I poured over it. The egg was slightly overcooked, and so the yolk didn't spread well over the rice. :( however it got way better from there. The mango sticky rice was AMAZING. It was just sweet enough, and the mango was R I P E. The rice was W A R M. It was an all around excellent experience. \\n\\nHowever, the star of the show was the SOM TOM. The papaya salad was FULL OF FLAVOR. Omg, I am a huge meat eater, but I will gladly sacrifice meat to get another taste of that salad. It was a beautiful symphony of contrasting textures, notes, and flavors.

In a fine restaurant back home you might get three to choose from.  And I always worry they will be too large for one bite.  (You know you just don't want to cut one up--too graphic.)  But at Neptune they were too small; just barely a taste, but the sauces were very good.\\n\\nMy wife had the hamburger topped with fried oysters--quite good, and enough for two seniors.

Wasn't interested in a sit-down dinner so popped into Bru for a quick bite. Walked in and was unaware/not informed hot foods are ordered at the register. Waited in front of the fridge for about 3 min to be serviced to only be directed to the register. Ordered a cheese foccia pizza, a roast beef sandwich, and a bottle of coke. My husband paid and was not given a receipt for our order, just the credit card transaction receipt. We go to sit down and was informed shortly after that there was no more cheese and was accommodating with a replacement item. However after our food arrived, there was no drink. The person at the register didn't ring It in, so we went back to purchase one. \\n\\nAbout 10 min after, my brother-in-law went to order the foccia pizza and a soup. After waiting about 10-15min, the order was not ready, so he approached the counter. The server behind the counter was unaware of an order placed and made a comment that she didn't get a ticket, or maybe she did and threw it out. Right in the middle of his and her conversation about his food, the woman had a visitor that stopped by to say hi, and instead of addressing my bil first, she chit chatted with her friend for like 1 min, which was 1 min too long while a customer was waiting for his food that she claimed was overlooked by her. She then gave him his soup and began to heat up the pizza. 5 min later the pizza was done. \\n\\nThe table server, Kevin, was very nice when delivering our food and providing utensils and extra napkins. \\n\\nThe foccia was really big for a $10 something slice of pizza. Very thick, but very airy. The roast beef was served warm, but not warm enough to melt the cheese, however the slight warmness wilted the lettuce. \\n\\nThe chowder was steaming hot, served with oyster crackers for about $7 something.\\n\\nOverall it was an ok experience for a cafe in a casino."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"1298 W 5th Ave","city":"Grandview Heights","stars":"2","text":"Unprofessional management, and unwilling to meet customer expectations.

I pretty well expected the restaurant to be no frills.  Most students just want good, inexpensive food.  Baba's does not disappoint.  I had no expectatations of the menu, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The owner knows food well and can cook!  The dishes we got were simple but outstanding in their simplicity.  He pays attention to quality in his ingredients.  I don't particularly like the current gastropub trend of stacking a hamburger with fried eggs, onion rings, and everything but the kitchen sink.  If the ingredients are quality, a simple cheeseburger can sing and the one at Baba's does.  Nothing fancy here, but can you remember actually TASTING the cheese on a cheeseburger?  It usually gets lost.  The cheese he uses is, I'm guessing, a sharp cheddar and quite tasty.  He puts it on griddle bread along with a thick, high-quality beef patty.  And a side of homemade, hand cut fries is the clincher.  No machine cut, frozen fries here.  These are the fries your mama made at home.  In this case, the chef's grandmother for whom the restaurant is named and who taught him all he knows.  I love back stories like this.  My husband's pork dish was very tasty as well, and we couldn't pass up getting hot cinnamon rolls for dessert.  Again, home made, warm and lovely.  And speaking of warm and lovely, the husband and wife owners ARE.  Very nice folks.  We probably can't get down there as often as we'd like since we live some distance away, but I think if I'm having a really bad day, I would return to eat some delicious, simple food with some friendly folks in an unpretentious atmosphere.

It was a sampler dish,  brisket, sausage, baby back ribs,  one big old beef rib,  and perhaps another meat (I forget).  Very satisfying...  Brisket was nice, still moist but not dripping,  good bark,  but could've been smoked a bit harder as I needed to taste more wood and smoke in the meat.  Baby Back ribs were awesome!  Meaty,  big, tasty,  good bark.  The sausage,  meh...  Spicy but not something that made me sit up and notice.  Here's my advice...  Make a nice Bratwurst instead of the spicy sausage and serve that.  The spicy sausage needed the BBQ sauce on the table.  A good Brat does not,  and the rest of your meats do not as well.  The star of the show,  however,  was the beef rib!  Oh man,  that thing was banging!  What's the specific fat that's near the bone on the beef prime rib?  You know the one,  I know it's not good for you,  but it kind of crystallizes when it cooks up and melts in your mouth?  Oh man,  it was animal fat heaven in my mouth.

We then ordered the maw's fries and what came out looked like someone went to the toilet all over our plate. You couldn't see the soggy, handful of fries because they were covered, no DROWNED, in this roast beef sauce and a little bit of cheese. Not only did they look disgusting but they weren't that great either. Even our waitress commented on the plate and said it looked disgusting and that the kitchen put way too much roast beef on our dish. \\n\\nSpeaking of waitress (she was fantastic) we originally had a waiter. Yeah, he actually quit in the middle of serving us, handed us our drinks, then walked right out the front door. Not a good look Tibby's. \\n\\nFor our entrees I ordered the chicken and waffles with sweet potato fries. Sweet potatoes are already sweet so it was overkill to add white sugar on top. The batter on the fried chicken lacked seasoning, the cheese and bacon had little flavor, the waffles were completely soggy and the brandy sauce had that overwhelming flavor of a sauce with alcohol that has not cooked down properly. I might as well have poured straight liquor all over my food. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the 12 napkin roast beef with a side of cheese grits. The sandwich just like the maw's fries looked incredibly unappetizing (seriously it looked like slop) and came with bread that was deep fried in batter. The entire overpriced po boy was not good at all. Too much over the top with very little flavor to back it up. According to him his cheese grits didn't taste like grits but more like mashed potatoes and that he's made better with instant grits. \\n\\nOverall I was disappointed with the food.

I also had a taste of Sara's hot dog because her eyes lit up when she bit into it. Let me tell you... this is a serious hot dog!! The hot dog itself seemed to be fried with a slight very thin crust that gave it a slight sweet taste and the coleslaw added a good crunch to it. Unfortunately their potato salad is one of the worst potato salads I've had in quite some time and it ended up in the trash. It smelled weird, had an off taste and left an after taste with some type of spice i'm not familiar with. Their fountain machine had their COKE flavor out of order which was a bummer but some of us grabbed a COKE ZERO. I wish they had some sauces but that we know of, there are none. The french fries go well with their ketchup but our table didn't have any so we had to ask for a bottle. As we got ready to leave we noticed the table next to us getting the PONKO tacos... the plate had a like of 3 tacos and they looked delicious!!! Had I been by myself and not thought it would embarrass my wife, I would have gone straight back to the counter to get 3 tacos. Going in I had no expectations but left the place pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to stop by again with some friends and see what they all think.¬†\\nRoli's Rating:\\n1.¬†Service: 7/10, Nice and friendly place from the time you come in until you leave. You order over the counter and get a number and then get your food fairly quickly. Drinks are self serve and you are not waited on by the staff\\n2.¬†Price: 8/10, They don't get a 9-10 because although you do have an item or 2 that can help you stay cheap (individual tacos, hot dog), most of their items , once you order a drink, will take you above the $10 mark\\n3.¬†Location and Parking: 9/10, Location is very easy to get to, right off 85. The parking isn't a problem and should never be as there is wrap around parking\\n4.¬†Cleanliness: 8/10, The place looked new and fairly clean\\n5.¬†Health Rating: A (100)\\n6.¬†Roli Overall Rating: 7/10,¬†I would travel long distances to eat at this location... every other week¬†\\n**Roli's Recommendations**\\nHOT DOG, PONKO CHICKEN IN WHATEVER FORM (PLATE, TACOS, SALAD), PONKO FRIES"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My only wish is that I didn't have to wait so long to get a table.

My favorite dishes were the short rib and wagyu coulotte. The wagyu was tender and had a lot of good flavors in the sauce. The short rib was delicious and not salty like a lot of places marinate it in. The Steak Frites was a little tougher and I wasn't much of a fan in the marinade. \\n\\nI will plan ahead next time knowing you have to wait over an hour.

However, it just wasn't in the cards for us. Read: I wasn't going to wait 40 minutes just to get a table. So what next? Keke's across the street? Aside from thinking that their menu is the exact opposite of First Watch (i.e. First Watch focuses on more hearty breakfasts that are savory and Keke's wants to make french toasts and pancakes covered in fruit and sugar), I just didn't want to wait nearly an hour for a table and I could see people lined up outside there as well. \\n\\nSo we Yelped a little bit and found what seemed to be a little mom and pop diner right around the corner from our house. I wanted something a little more than the standard eggs-bacon-toast breakfast but was pleasantly surprised when I saw their menu. The boyfriend went with the Crown Turkey, a huge omelet with turkey, spinach and a few other ingredients. I went with a make-your-own omelet that I smothered in hollandaise  sauce.

Their burnt out sign at night, which reads: \\"The HO\\" should have been a sign (literally) to \\"move a RONG!\\"\\n\\nOur group was craving dim sum and this place claimed to have it.  I entered to see if they were still serving dim sum and was mislead by the hostess.  There were no carts making the rounds and only one dim sum cart sitting unattended in the corner with a handful of baked items...no steamed dumpRING.\\n\\nConfucius says: \\"Man who eat photo of father, soon spitting image of father.\\"\\n\\nWe were told that we could order dim sum and they'd make it for us fresh.  A bit odd as I've never ordered dim sum from a menu but rather just pointed at the items as they were being carted around after immediately being prepared from a busy kitchen.  We ordered several items to include pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, buns filled with BBQ pork, sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf, wonton soup and some other items.\\n\\nAfter we ordered but before the food arrived, we decided to yelp the place.  \\"Holy Shit!\\"  We realized we had just made a huge mistake after reading a few reviews.  Too late...the crap was already coming out to our table.  \\n\\nThe BBQ pork bun bows were reheated leftovers they didn't sell prior (or throw out) as the outsides were warm to the touch but the insides were cold on our tongues.  The dumplings arrived and instead of inviting us to eat them with a wonderful fragrance, stunk like a dead wet cat that ate rotten fish for it's last meal.  They were so bad that we left several full plates untouched since we had doubled up on all the orders.  \\n\\nThe wonton soup looked alright but after biting into a wonton and examining the center, we could see the meat was still pink and raw so now we stopped eating it as well.  The four sticky rices at $4 a pop were a total rip off as I'm use to getting three of them for $3 at my dim sum joint.  I unwrapped mine and was hit in the face with the foul odor of something gone bad.  It took me one bite to confirm this item wasn't safe to eat.  \\n\\nI've never left so much uneaten/untouched food on the table anywhere.  The dim sum prices are outrageous and the food is literally rotten.  These items were not fresh...merely reheated REFTovers.  \\n\\nWe paid and got up to leave.  The hostess asked me if I wanted boxes for the food and I flat out told her \\"no because we didn't like any of it.\\"  She didn't apologize, ask me what was wrong or offer any discount on the bill which you'd expect considering how little we ate.  All she did was thank me as I'm sure this is a normal reaction she gets from customers.  We also noticed there were no Asian customers eating here...another bad sign for a Chinese restaurant located in the heart of China Town.  \\n\\nWe went back to our hotel rooms where two out of four in the party honestly threw up.  I tried to but wasn't able...I've never tried to make myself puke after eating anything but really wanted this crap out of my system.  After resting and multiple bathroom breaks, we all went out for drinks and got some real food in our bellies as we were still hungry.\\n\\nLater that night while on an underground ghost tour of Portland (which was pretty cool) we happened to walk by The House Of Louie aka \\"The HO\\", where the only negative words to come from the tour guide's mouth during a 2+ hour tour were the ones warning us to stay away from this place that the health department should have shut down long ago. \\n\\nPlease watch the link provided!

Despite holding the bag upright on the car ride home, the staff had apparently thrown the larger, heavier containers on top of a smaller, lighter container containing  a very hot chicken korma sauce (temperature wise). Additionally, the chicken korma container was not sealed properly, causing the very hot sauce to spill out of the container and disintegrate the bottom of the paper bag in to her lap, resulting in first degree burns on her legs and feet and her clothes being badly stained. The carpet and seat of the vehicle were also badly stained. \\n\\nI contacted the manager (who did not identify himself) and explained the situation.

This was a pick off Yelp out of 4 choices and we hit the jackpot! It was AWESOME! We came on a Sunday morning at prime time. Our weight was 45 minutes but well worth it! They were pretty crowded however they have several spots for waiting. One stop being indoors and then they have to patio Courtyard type areas to wait in. While you're waiting they have complimentary coffee and they also have a little bar where you can order mimosas, beer, or iced coffee for a reasonable price. The mimosas beer and coffee ran anywhere from $4 to $5. Our food was delicious! We had eggs benedict which came with home-style potatoes and fresh fruit. My husband had the queso omelette with sausage and added the short stack of pancakes. He ordered peanut butter chocolate chip and they were awesome! Keep in mind the short stack of pancakes are the size of a plate and you get two of them so there's enough for two or three people. The prices are quite reasonable & the portions are large. Every table that I've seen walked out and said taking a to-go box and we will be doing the same. Are waitresses name was Xander and she did an awesome job and was very personable. Restaurant is pretty clean considering how busy they are and the rest rooms were clean as well. If you sit outside it's very difficult to hear your name being called for so the only downside to that was their speaker wasn't working and we had to keep coming in to check and see where we were on the list. With that said, the hostess was very nice and accommodating. I highly recommend this Cafe and we will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Harvest Co-op","address":"3815 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3.5","text":"I think the best way to approach Harvest is to not thinking of them as  grocery store, but rather a big corner shop.

I've tried Blue Ribbon in Arlington, but that was sub par when it comes to BBQ. So I went to Redbones in Somerville because a friend recommended  it. First off, my husband and I went for lunch. It seems the menu is the same for lunch and dinner. When you first walk into this place, you get the feeling that this place is going to seem gritty and old looking inside and I was right. The other thing that stands out is the horrible loud music they got playing. Anyway, my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich plate with 2 sides and I ordered the fried chicken with okra and mashed potatoes. The fried chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped and the okra was just OK as fried. I was hoping that the okra was going to be fried in corn meal, but that was not the case. My husband's pulled pork was average tasting. At least they didn't cover it in BBQ sauce or liquid smoke like I've tasted in other places. The 2 sides he ordered were the worst; coleslaw with no taste and limp onion rings. Why has this place remained open since the eighties??Maybe it is because of its location among young people. All I know is I won't be back. FYI, the other thing I noticed is the the ribs are around $20.00 per plate which isn't cheap even for this place.

Half the high top tables near the bar were empty but they all had dirty dishes on them. After five or 10 minutes of waiting on someone to come over and bus the tables, I politely asked one of the five people standing around the host area to see if somebody might clean off the table in the corner for us. The waitress looked somewhat annoyed, rolled her eyes and then said she would do it. She went over to the table, took two dirty glasses from the table and left the rest of the dirty dishes. She walked by the table several times to wait on others but never finished the job or asked anyone else to help. Meanwhile I counted - there were nine employees  standing around literally doing nothing other than chatting with each other. No manager either. So we just decided to sit at the bar and eat there. The bartender gave us two menus and then we sat there for another 10 minutes before we just got up and left. No one asked us for even a drink order.

They both happened in June 2018. We had bought one of those promotional gift card + bonus deals for Father's Day and had 1 $50 GC, and 2 $10 GCs.\\n\\n1st Trip: We took (my 3 kids and I) took my husband out to dinner on June 1st for Father's Day because none of the children were going to be home on the actual day. We were seated in the dining room and placed our drink orders. A short time later we get our drinks and order out food. Then, we wait, wait, wait, and wait some more. We watched as tables around us were seated and had gotten their food, while we still waited. Finally, after an hour the waiter and manager approach our table and apologize that our food was taking so long and it would be out shortly. The manager offered to take 25% off our bill and buy us dessert. Okay, he took responsibility, we are happy. \\n\\nWhen the food comes out, not only was my husbands food cold, it was wrong. Not totally wrong, one-third wrong. He ordered the pick three and one item was wrong. After waiting for a few minutes we get the waiters attention and he brings out the right dish. After waiting for so long, my husband and I were so upset that neither of us ate much and ended the night. It was an absolutely terrible Father's Day dinner, but the manager tried to make up for it so we shrugged it off. \\n\\n2nd Trip:  Within the next week after this Father's Day mess my husband and I went for a quick bite around 4:30 p.m. We had a $10 GC to use so we thought we would try again and sat at the bar since the kids weren't there. The bar area was busy and we got the last 2 seats. The service was okay, not bad and not good. We each order a drink and a shareable appetizer (1 ea). After our drinks and food were set down in front of us, the bartender never asked if we wanted another drink or asked how the food was. In her defense she was busy refilling beer for the night rush and the computer system crashed, so we weren't too upset with her. However, we did have to get her attention to ask for the check. We were planning to stay a little longer but not with that service, so we went elsewhere. Not the worst experience, but the service wasn't very good.\\n\\n3rd Trip:  We had one more $10 GC to use so we went for lunch during the week at the end of June (if I remember correctly, I know it was shortly after the other visits) and sat at the bar again. We didn't want the GC to expire and thought the lunch employees might be better, NOPE! This bartender took our drink order and we got our drinks. We ordered our food and got our food. This bartender then turned to 2 guys sitting at the end of the bar and proceeded to talk and flirt with them for our entire lunch and then some. Another patron walked in and sat down and it took her almost 20 minutes to even acknowledge him. When she finally noticed the other patron and took his order, my husband got her attention to ask for another drink. She got a very annoyed look on her face and went to the talk to the guys for a few minutes, which was literally right next to our seats. It took her over 5 minutes to get me and my husband our draught beers; 5 MINUTES! She wasn't busy attending to other customers, she was busy flirting. When it was time for our check we had to get her attention yet again. She was quick with the bill though! She wanted that tip $$.When my husband and I left that day we were both shocked and appalled that any person working for tips would completely ignore her customers. Other than the 2 guys she was flirting with, there were 4 more of us at the bar and that was it. Don't you think you would be interacting with everyone since it was slow? Not ruining your chances for a decent tips from us all instead of trying to get a date?\\n\\nWe love Chili's and have never had issues like these at any other locations. However, after these three trips we vowed to never return to this Chili's again. We were so upset that yes, I contacted corporate while these experiences were still fresh and let them know, in more detail than above, what was going at this location. I never received a response. Not an apology, not a go F yourself, NOTHING. Honestly, I don't know if I'll ever go to another Chili's again because of this and that stinks; I love Chili's food. This location needs to new employees or management; maybe both. A complete overhaul and retraining.

I come from a town that's SO Italian it was actually a part of the Soprano's. (It's where Adrien's bar was.)  And when it comes to Southern Italian food, I'm PICKY.  What I really loved was the red sauce, it came with the meatball.  It was very rich and thick.  It had a lot of flavors and was delicious.  The meatball was light and fluffy which I liked as well.  I ordered the Pomodoro as my main dish on the suggestion of one of the staff members so I could try another sauce.  It was good but I liked the red sauce better.  I had the garlic bread and it was fine.  I would've preferred if it had melted butter rather than olive oil.  The order only had 3 slices of bread.  I was hoping for a section of a loaf.  What can I say?  I realize this isn't New Jersey.  It was still good.  I had the deconstructed cannoli for desert.  I liked it but I wouldn't really call it a cannoli.  I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from ordering it.  It was delicious.  All of it was delicious, but like I said, I'm picky and I know this.  I would've also liked to see Penne alla Vodka on the menu only because it's my favorite.\\n\\nIn short (and I realize my review is not) I'd say Patrizi's is a winner.

Small . There's more of a dinner rather than lunch feel here. My husband even says that he'd rather come to this place to drink, rather than eat. It's very busy, feels rushed even though you're told that food comes out whenever it comes out, and there's \\"no rush\\" to take care of the bill. It's cramped to the point where you're rubbing elbows with strangers next to you. There's a strong \\"you'll be served when WE feel you should be served\\", evident by the food coming out when it's ready and not at the same time.\\n\\nService: \\nOur server left us alone for the most part, checking in with us once or twice after the food was delivered, but did take away our finished dishes before too long. He did have a mild patronizing/pretentious air about him, which was off putting. My husband found the cooks we were facing more friendly than our server, as we were seated at the bar facing the open kitchen. Even though we were seated first, the couple next to us who were seated about 5-10 minutes after were served food before our first dish arrived. Though, I will say, the same couple were given a free chocolate donut after they were accidentally splashed by a bit of the milkshake the cooks were making. Unfortunately, that milkshake was mine, so I suppose I got them free food?\\n\\nFood:\\nFamily style restaurants I'm used to have larger portions to the food. Consistently. This is not the case with Tasty n Alder. My husband and I ordered a Grasshopper milkshake (me), Rum Barraquito (him), Lemon Ricotta pancake (me), and Polena n Sugo.\\nGrasshopper milkshake - My first. It wasn't too bad. There's a definite alcohol taste and had some solid chunks of ice cream in it, which I did like. There's not an overwhelming mint flavor. It was delivered in a glass jug with two small glasses (6 oz?) and long spoons for sharing, which I didn't because my husband dislikes mint flavors.\\nRum Barraquito - Good head of cream. Husband enjoyed it. A good coffee cocktail.\\nLemon Ricotta pancake - Three small palm sized pancakes. There was a light lemon flavor and a very sugary sweet bluberry compote. It didn't even fill me up. It was yummy, but for the price, not worth it.\\nPolenta n Sugo - Super flavorful after we mixed up the dish and very filling. Still expensive given the amount, but my husband and I were able to finish it. \\n\\nFinal Notes:\\nI agree with what the more critical reviews have been saying. This place is overpriced for the amount of food you're given. Or as my husband says, \\"It's expensive for the purpose of being expensive.\\" I feel misled by the 4.5 overall rating this place has, though I do admit that I should have delved deeper into the critical reviews for reasons why their rating is low.

We had a great time. The service was a little strange. It wasn't unattentive, but it wasn't great either. I was under the impression that happy hour included more than just drink specials, but when I asked what they were we were only initially told about a special on bottles of wine. I had to persist to then get the full story that there were also a few dollars off on glasses of wine and draft beers. The draft beer list was unimpressive, mostly some Great Lakes from what I remember. So the weird happy hour interaction aside, all of the food on the menu looks really good. I decided on the pork cheek poutine small plate and the small caesar with anchovies. Both dishes were phenomenal. The pork cheek poutine was salty and crispy and warm (a feat not easily accomplished) and the salad was cold and crisp and the anchovies were beautiful. Will definitely come back.

And I've eaten French toast at many top rated restaurants in the Bay Area, so when I say this French toast is the best -- I mean it is THE BEST. The syrup and cream drizzled over four decadent pieces of French toast gives you an explosion of citrus flavor with each bite that is sweet -- but not in a confection sugar kind of way -- and leaves you highly satisfied. I also recommend the Cheese Board, which is a combination of four different European cheeses, prune jam, candied walnuts, and raspberries and blackberries with homemade soda crackers to accompany. All were delicious; however the consistency of the prune jam made it hard to separate and spread over the soda crackers. I also enjoyed the Elizabeth Taylor cocktail, which is a sparkling wine cocktail with violet flavor. The violet flavor gives a unique taste to the cocktail that may not be for everyone, so if you enjoy floral flavors in drinks (i.e. lavender or rose sodas) then I believe you will enjoy this drink.

So many items on the menu sounded delicious, but I opted for the chicken and waffles with mustard greens.  The food came relatively quickly, and they kept our drinks refilled in the mean time.  The chicken was deliciously moist, which just enough breading to add some interesting texture.  The mustard sauce was subtle and a perfect complement to the breading, but I could've used more, since the chicken tenders themselves were generously sized.  The waffle came with some fruit on top, just the right size and amount of sweetness.

There were times when it was too quiet in there and then music blasting.  \\n\\nI'm not a fan of Moroccan food, so I won't speak on it too much.  I will say that I had some spinach and feta in a crispy pastry thingie and just thinking about it makes me wanna change to five stars.  But no.  I was able to taste some different foods, but like I said, not a fan so it could have been great, but not to me. \\n\\nThe website says that no shoes are allowed inside, but you can wear your shoes.  Nobody said anything about most of the party with shoes on. Also, don't think you're going to go hangout and not order any food.  You need $25 to do that.  \\n\\nFree valet parking. \\n\\nThe bottom line is service needs an overhaul.

Okay....I've been going here since it opened around 9 years ago.  I've always loved it!  I'm a burrito fan!   I work super close by, so it's an easy habit to frequent Aprisa! However, recently, in the last 4 months or so,  I have found that the grilled veggie burrito is not my favorite choice anymore.  I've ordered the breakfast burrito many times before, but the last few times I've either picked it apart to make it work (super messy to do) or tossed the rest.  Now, I choose not to have it made with eggs or cheese, so it is a modified burrito.  I even gave it a month before I returned.  I love this place, and I hate wasting food!  \\n\\nToday I ordered the burrito again with grilled veggies,  but I asked them to remove the peppers, because the last two times I've noticed the onions and peppers were too crunchy and under cooked.  This gives it an off flavor overall.  It still came with carrots which is normally okay, but these too were waaaaay crunchy!  So I ended up again, making it work by dissecting the burrito, and getting rid of the debris.  Thank goodness for the guacamole and potatoes!  The roasted tomato salsa also helped. Otherwise, this would've been my last breakfast burrito.  I will go back eventually, just not for a while.  I've talked to a co-worker of mine, and she agrees with me when I say, I think there's something different Aprisa! is doing that is changing the flavors.  She says the meat is seasoned with something different than what they used to use, and it's not very flavorful now.\\n\\nMaybe it's a different chef?  Different Seasonings?

We asked for an Italian, which is usually the best sandwich I've ever had outside of Florence. It's thinly sliced and layered nicely, which is why I always come back. This guy decides to freestyle and just hand us a coarsely cut prosciutto sub with extra hot pepper. By the time I discover this we are already on 93 south in bumper to bumper traffic. I called to tell them, and the manager isn't even in the building. They call the manager and he says that I have to return the sub to get a refund, which is fair in most circumstances, but I'm not even upset about the money. I'm upset that such a great place and such a great sandwich can be made so badly by some guy who could not care less about working there.

So it was a wonderful treat to stop by Lamplighter for a few pre-dinner drinks on Saturday night. I'm very loyal to Belgian-style beers, but if I'm at a place that predominately serves local beers or better yet, an actual brewery, I'll opt for variety every time. I hadn't heard of Lamplighter prior to this most recent trip to Boston, but I'm glad I've finally been introduced to it in the best way. Lamplighter is a great option for a casual night out with friends, just be prepared to stand if you go at a peak time. \\n\\nLamplighter is laid out in a pretty awesome way. Behind the bar, you'll find windows as opposed to walls to expose the craft (no pun intended) as it happens. Massive tanks of that goodness. Enjoy your beer, with a view. The bar area is long and winds down to the back of the space, with a number of hightop tables/communal, garden-style tables taking up the majority of the space. If you're able to snag it, there's also a nice little nook with couches up a couple stairs if you stroll along to the back of the venue. My single gripe here was the lack of seating for the traffic, overall. We managed to find a little space at the very end of the bar on which to place our drinks, but it was not easy. Even proper table space might require you to stand. So maybe don't wear heels if you're planning on camping out here for a while. This all said, we went around 8:15/8:30 on a Saturday night, so this may have just been a function of day/time. In any case, we still managed to have a great time here. \\n\\nAs far as libations are concerned, Lamplighter has a really nice selection of beers on tap. I tried just about every beer on the menu and was impressed by the variety/flavors/creativity. Definitely had some interesting sips. Not everything impressed me, but the overall impressive was very, very good. Not to mention the prices are hard to beat. I live in NYC full-time, so I'm used to a pretty abominable price tag when it comes to drinks. At Lamplighter, you can get a flight of four beers for $8.50, which is a great deal in my book. If you'd prefer to commit more and get a single beer, they offer two sizes (as every craft beer bar should, honestly) with two tiers of pricing. Average beer will go for $5 if you want 8.5 oz or $7.50 for the largest size (sizes vary depending on ABV, as usual). \\n\\nThe bf and I started with the \\"Welcome to the Jungle Flight\\", which is comprised of the \\"Group Theory\\", the \\"Lumens\\", the \\"Werewolves of Cambridge\\" and the \\"Birds of a Feather\\". Least favorite was the Group Theory, my favorite was either the Werewolves (a porter) or the Lumen (a Belgian blonde, so not surprising that I enjoyed it). I also tried my dad's first beer, the 'Round Midnight, which was varied and yummy thanks to the addition of some cold brew. My favorite beer of the night was the \\"So Much For Subtlety\\", which is a pretty complex DIPA. Overall very impressed with the product here. And if you're looking for a little nosh, the pretzels here look bomb.

My boyfriend and I went here for our one year anniversary and it was so underwhelming we considered changing our anniversary date so we could re-celebrate. The best part of the meal was probably the free breadsticks that we got at the beginning of the meal, mostly because the avocado dip was absolutely amazing. Besides that, the rest of the meal was overpriced for the quality we got. The meal we got was: \\n\\n Calamari Fritto ($19) - Nothing particularly interesting about this Calamari. Definitely have had better for a lower price point. Wasn't bad but wasn't necessarily great either. \\n\\n- Naan with Prosciutto ($19) - I understand they could mark up the price due to the prosciutto but there was nothing fancy about this dish at all. Literally just arugula and prosciutto with a drizzle of a dressing on top. 100% could have recreated this dish at home because it required no skill to make. My boyfriend was okay with this dish but he also still thinks Kraft Mac and Cheese is a gourmet dish. \\n\\n- Mozzarella Bar with King Crab ($27) - Maybe I don't understand these \\"upscale\\" restaurants but I was expecting a whole lot more than just two pieces to this dish. The mozzarella on this dish was very soft and melted in our mouths which is the only reason this place gets 2 stars.  This was probably the best dish we had, but there was a lack of quantity (less than 1 crab legs worth of crab & 2 pieces of mozzarella). The playing of this dish was also awful. We were honestly going to send this plate back because we thought they had given us someone's leftovers. \\n\\n- Grilled Swordfish with Risotto and Mussels and Grated Botarga ($39) - The swordfish on this plate was decent but should've been seasoned better. The risotto was absolutely a joke. I don't know how this place has gotten awards, but the risotto was undercooked and the seasoning was bland to say the least. The only reason the plate wasn't awful was because they had mussels to add SOME flavor to this overpriced, bland atrocity of a plate. \\n\\nThe ambiance was also incredibly weird at this restaurant. At one point, they were playing some weird Screamo EDM Christmas that left us shook. My boyfriend made a reservation for 9:30PM because of my work schedule, not realizing this place closes at 10PM (our fault, we know). Midway into our meal, almost half of the staff had clocked out and we had to wait 15 mins to get our check and that was because there were no waiters/waitresses in sight to get our check. This is my first time writing a Yelp review and I've been to so many restaurants in Boston so imagine how atrocious my experience must have been for me to finally write this review.

Many places make them too flour heavy and doughy. Their's here are perfect. The filling with beef and roasted red peppers is packed with deep flavor too. Santiago a.k.a. Little Chago is awesome and when I asked about the empanadas he said they make them from scratch in house and you can tell.\\n\\nAs far as the rest of their food goes, they'll start you out with a basket of banana (or plantain I'm not sure which one they use) chips with an addictive garlic dipping sauce. Their appetizer: Queso Frito con Salsa de Guayaba is a solid opener/ The fried cheese with guava glaze go together well.\\n\\nI have also had their beer braised chicken (Fricase de Pollo) which was good, but I was expecting a bit more flavor and the chicken was a bit dry. And when I had it, they were unfortunately out of their cilantro dressing and put what I'm almost positive was Kraft Ranch on it. I feel the salad would have been much better with their in house dressing.\\n\\nI love a good Cuban sandwich and theirs ain't bad. For a great Cuban, you need each part of it to be of quality and that is my only issue with theirs. The slow roasted pork, bread, mustard and pickles are all there and the ham wasn't bad either. It's the cheese that is lacking in my opinion. It seemed to be like those white Kraft singles which I just can't swing with. *Please note their Cuban sandwich I think is only available during lunch time on weekdays.\\n\\nI've been here a couple times now. The day I got the chicken there was a big table next to me that had a feast. I over heard them talking about the chicken versus Chago's Pernil Asado pork dish. They all unanimously liked the Pernil Asado best. I will definitely try that on a future visit. I would like to try their Mofongo and Paella too.\\n\\nI don't think there are many Puerto Rican/Caribbean restaurants in town, but with this as an option, who needs any others."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"2400 North Orange Avenue","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Wow!!!

The low-key scared me a bit haha\\n\\n***Street parking only in that area, so come early to try to snag a spot somewhere close. Fortunately, theres plenty on Tremont Street!\\n\\nAs I walked closer to the restaurant, I could smell the seafood boil! It really reminded me of smells of the streets in New Orleans. There is a small waiting area at the door and a coat rack, you might want to leave your coat since the seats are fairly small and you're going to have a messy meal!\\n\\nWe ordered 2 rounds of boils and so many of the small plates that I can't remember which is what. The garlic noodle was definitely very creamy and garlicy. I like it, but some of my friends weren't a huge fan. The plates are fairly small for sharing but like the server said, 2-3 plates for about 2 people. \\n\\nThe boils came in a big silver bowl. They were amazing to look at, tasted great, our first mistake was not ordering a sauce. Without the sauce, the seafood is still boiled with flavoring, but didn't have enough taste. For our second round, we ordered sauce with it and it was perfected! The restaurant also provides a can, looks like an ice bucket for wine, to hold all the shells and shenanigans you don't want on your plate/table.\\n\\nGET THE BEIGNETS!!! I haven't had beignets since I've been to New Orleans but this was it. Each order comes with 6 and YESS they are worth getting!!!

In particular, the half-dozen oysters.  On the most recent visit, these were spectacular, even if I'm still missing the briney taste.  Suspecting someone might still be washing shucked oysters, I spied on the guy, but no he wasn't washing them. Not a huge deal - just a small sprinkle and a squeeze of lemon, and away we go (I still don't care for their mignonette) The cajun shrimp dish was very good the first time I went with my friend Tommy.  So, upon the return visit with my wife, I recommended it to her.  And while it wasn't at all spicy the first time, it packed a bit more heat the second time, and I almost became the fall guy for the reco!  Good thing she was in a good mood :)  Both times our waiters were excellent - Jerome, the second time, was in \\"mind-reading\\" mode, fast, attentive, alert, professional. Can't ask for more than that! One last note: signing up for their reward program saved me a few bucks - the promo at the time was 25% off wines, and yes, you can combine it with MD!  Sweet!

I first laid eyes on you in 1991 while I was in college at SUNY Buffalo, and you pretty much had me at sushi. Yes, sushi. You were the first grocery I ever met that had affordable ready-made food, In those days between eating 10 for $1 packaged ramen noodles and spaghetti with Ragu sauce, you were my weekly treat. But I guess you never took notice of me. Afterall, I was just a young punk.  \\n\\nI've grown up now, happily married, and you lost your chance. But when you moved into my neck of the woods, I thought Whoa, be still my beating heart. The temptation was too great and I just had to see you again. You've improved quite a bit these last 3 years, I guess settling here took awhile. That improvement made me break off completely from the others, except Trader Joe's. I still go there from time to time. But you're more approachable than Whole Foods, you're a lot more civilized than Market Basket, and most importantly, you hang out with some great, friendly people....unlike Stop & Shop. All 4 live near me, but I don't mind driving the 15 minute drive to see you.  \\n\\nI was there today, but I'm sure you took no notice of me. You were busy, as always. You sure have a huge house, and you always keep it so clean. I could always depend on you for carrying my favorite Liberte yogurt, the French lavender flavor. You actually introduced me to it a couple of years ago, and I can never find it elsewhere. I love that stuff....it's so delicious. \\n\\nI also love the fact that you have a big section of alcohol. I always get a few bottles of Guigal Cotes Du Rhone Rouge when I'm there. It's cheaper in your place than the regular liquor stores. But I wish you would give a discount when I buy a dozen bottles like most of the liquor stores I go to. I know I know....I'm already saving money at your place. \\n\\nAnyway.....oh before I go, congratulations for placing 2nd this year (behind Google) in Fortune's Best Companies To Work For.

I had the petite-size Prime Rib (10 oz.), which was sliced and plated tableside, with a very tasty broccoli for the vegetable and a cup of jus for dipping. The baked potato was a bit leathery-skinned, I thought, but it tasted fine with all of the fixin's - plus, I was too full to eat it all!

Upon our arrival, the hostess didn't really acknowledge us, she just stared at me as if it was my job to greet her.  It was a bit odd.  We were seated at a larger table in the middle of the room, families with young children on both sides, exactly the opposite of my quiet table birthday request but whatever, we just sat down.  We were not offered warm hand towels, no tea and had no creative offering for any non-alcoholic beverages other than pop or a peach slushie.  After waiting for an inordinate amount of time, our food arrived.  It was most disappointing in it's lack of freshness - the oysters were warm and tasted mushy and the preparation of the soft shell crab was was so heavily breaded it could have been anything under there.  At this point we probably should have left however everything we had ordered had finally arrived on the table so we continued on.  One positive note was that the hamachi was very good, fresh and it was a generous serving.  We asked for more tea which was provided to me but not my daughter although we had asked for both of us.  As we were waiting to ask for the check, the server walked right past our table to attend to the 7 year old diner at the next table.  We honestly couldn't  get out of there fast enough.  The bill came to $150 for 2 drinks,  extremely poor food coupled with lacklustre service.   After our first uncomfortable experience with the hostess, we should have pulled the pin and gone to another one of our favourite japanese restaurants where we consistently receive a friendly welcome, great service and top quality, well prepared food every time at half the price of Zen.

The noise level was low, but the restaurant was a bit slow when we were there - not sure what it would be like with a full house.  \\n\\nThe only choices are whether or not to do the wine pairing with the set menu (we did), and which of the two desserts (we did one of each).  Presentation on the plate was attractive, thoughtful, and interesting, and every course was excellent.  The wine pairings were good.  I'd go back in a heartbeat and wouldn't change a single thing.

I am originally from the Chicagoland area and my girlfriend is from the New York City area, so we both have had some good Italian food in our day. However, Patrizi's is amongst the best we've ever had. Patrizi's set the bar extremely high. The food truck vibes add to their aura. Expect a crowd but waiting in line is part of the experience and definitely worth it. The employees are super friendly and are more than happy to offer suggestions and explain the menu. There's an ample amount of seating as well. Their homemade pasta and pancetta were both the highlights. I definitely plan on returning to Austin for the sole purpose of having Patrizi's once again.

This made waiting go by even quicker because by the we sat at our real table, all of our food was arriving as well. \\n\\nI suggest getting their Potatas Bravas to hold you over until all the main dishes arrive! So flavorful and the portion was pretty big. The perfect thing to snack on while waiting. One of the highlights was their Seared Fois Gras with pineapple jam - didn't expect to see it on a breakfast / brunch menu, but I'm so glad I got it because it was perfectly seared and just melted in my mouth. We also ordered the Polenta n Sugo. Not the prettiest dish, but it's delicious and so filling! More on the heavy side, so a few bites shared between a group of people is all you need. Loved eating the warm polenta and having the surprise of the tender braised pork shoulder and belly. Lastly, the Tasty Steak & Cheddar Eggs!

I've tried both the filet mignon and the strip streak. The filet mignon is my favorite, it's a delight on my palette and the texture of it is great. This usually comes with mash potatoes and string beans. \\n\\nDESSERT:\\nTheir desserts are super presentable and they all taste great, but my ultimate favorite is the almond cheesecake. It's known as one of the best desserts of disney and it's absolutely wonderful if you're okay with almond and you love desserts.\\n\\nALCOHOLIC BEV:\\nI love the drinks with the glowing souvenir cube.

Very good.  Bordering on fantastic I dare say.  The copious pile of meat is wonderfully seasoned and carved right off the spit atop a fresh array of olives, feta, onion, cuke and tomato.  They try to section off many of the ingredients for those who may want less of one ingredient which I imagine is helpful.  The hummus is fantastic as it leans on the tahini side giving it an unusually creamy and dense texture reminiscent of the kind my dad used to bring home from the Israeli grocery store in Queens NY back in the day.  The cauliflower salad is delicious as it comes ensconced in red and green peppers, onions and mushroom and tossed in a tangy vinegar dressing.  If I had to nitpick I'd say that the cauliflower should be the star of the dish but it was evenly dispersed with the other ingredients.  I would order this again in any case.\\n\\nThe total for this meal came to about 30 bucks as I added a tip for good karma.

It was fluffy to say the least. My boyfriend got the bootleg mussel bowl with garlic fries. I thought the sauce was definitely kicking and little salty, but the mussels were small and few.

Since we checked out yelp we were ready for the 2.5 hour wait and put our name in.  The only thing I thought was a little silly with this was that they told us 2.5 hour wait but once they call us, they said we had about 2-5 mins to get back to the restaurant or they'd give away our reservation.  I think that's just a bit unreasonable.  They actually called us at the 1.75 hour mark and since we were out walking around, we actually ran back to make sure make sure they didn't give it away.\\n\\n-Ambiance: It's actually really cute inside, it has a nice vibe of an old time bar however it's tiny and so crowded with people and there are constantly people coming in and out that it kind of ruins it.

They have a nice selection of different East Coast oysters and a description to go along with them.  I tried a bunch of different ones and none of them disappointed.  They were so fresh they tasted like they had just caught them and shucked them from me and tasted like the ocean.  \\n++Lobster Roll: Get the hot one, not sure why you'd go with the cold one.  Literally the best lobster roll I've ever had.  It tastes super luxurious since they cram it full with fresh lobster meat.  The lobster meat itself is extremely sweet and in large chunks so you really taste it.  The roll is good and only slightly buttered so you really just taste the lobster.

This recent Vancouver trip, we decided to give Ramenman a try.  I was curious to try the chicken broth and also, you don't see chicken and clam in a bowl of ramen usually.  We walked in to Ramenman around 5:30 PM after doing a little hike at Deep Cove.  It was cold and rainy that day and a hot bowl of ramen seem to be the perfect reward.\\n\\nThe restaurant is very typical of a ramen shop, small and cute with an open kitchen that you can see the chef at work.  There is a long shared table and then a couple of 2 & 4 tops at the end of the restaurant.  The menu is also very small, but that's how I love a ramen shop to be - Do one thing and do it well.  Well, technically there are a few things on the menu, not all ramen, but there is no doubt that ramen is the star of the show.  I ordered the chicken with clam, hubby tried the regular. We both added an egg and corn to our bowl of ramen.  Then we also shared an order of pork scallop gyoza and their staff meal curry rice bowl.\\n\\nSo the gyoza and curry are both pretty tasty.  The 'regular' bowl of ramen hubby ordered was also pretty good.  As for my chicken & clam ramen, I tried with a piece of chicken and pork each.  Both were ok to me, nothing spectacular.  However, I did really like the broth.  It's not as salty as other ramen I've tried and the clam added a little extra something different to the soup.  There is a Chinese clam soup dish I've always loved when growing up in Taiwan.  Adding clam to the ramen gave me a taste of what I loved... it's like a 'sea freshness' to the soup base.  I am a big fan of this broth and would go back for it again the next time I am in Vancouver."},{"name":"Bootleg Special","address":"400 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best Cajun food hands down!!

A 4+ star rated place on yelp is usually pretty awesome!  Things started out well, they were really accommodating in getting us a spot on the patio. I would say that everyone except our server was pretty friendly.\\n\\nSERVICE?\\nThere are times when service does not matter as much for me. When I'm out with friends, grabbing cheap grub, for instance. But on a Saturday date night, you want it to be great, because it really does colour the rest of your experience at that restaurant. I don't expect nor necessarily want chit-chat, especially if it's busy, but a friendly smile and attitude goes a long way.  When you're friendly, slow service becomes pretty forgivable. My impression of our server was a disinterested career server of middle age. Perhaps it was because we didn't get a bottle of wine, only a glass and a pina colada. We didn't get an appetizer with our meal, only the pasta platter. He then suggested that perhaps we'll get dessert later. When it became clear we weren't going to drop tonnes of money it felt like we got curt, bare minimum treatment. After a long time our drinks finally came, my boyfriend's wine was poured quickly and hastily.  \\n\\nTHE FOOD\\nThe food was awesome. The pasta platter for 2 was wagyu meatballs and truffled spaghetti, penne pomodoro, linguine gamberi, and pasta shells stuffed with ricotta and squash. I love this idea of sharing a variety of pastas from one platter. For the indecisive eater it's perfect, the presence of both creamy pastas and tomato-based ones really give the experience variety. The truffled spaghetti in particular was as advertised, so delicious, and rich. The meatballs were super tender and flavourful, slightly spicy. The linguine had two giant tiger prawns which was great, and the tasty olives gave it that extra burst of flavour. The pasta shells were rich and creamy, oh so dreamy. The penne pomodoro was excellent as well, I felt like I could eat bucket loads of it. Until of course, my stomach realized I just ate a ton of pasta and now I was very full.  \\n\\nTHE ENDING\\nDuring our meal our server checked up on us once, on his way to another table, his feet whisking him away after we had barely finished answering. Later he showed up with the dessert menu, which we were too full for. The dessert menu was quickly snapped closed and withdrawn. I handed him a gift card and he came back with the bill. The receipt showed the full amount of the meal, with nothing taken off. He said to just pay 8.12 or something like that. I felt that was a bit odd since most places nowadays are able to mark it off in their system and print out the proper receipt. Especially since this was their own gift card. Even places which aren't able to do it through the computer would at least write down the final, corrected amount by hand. Were we not even worth that extra minute to do so?  But my boyfriend just wanted to leave by this point, so he plunked down the difference in cash and off we went. I kept imagining someone looking at the bill and thinking we stiffed the place and it made me feel uneasy. \\n\\nVERDICT\\nOur experience with service wasn't the best, but I would be willing to try it again with some girlfriends since it seems people usually have good, attentive service here, and I loved that truffled spaghetti. My boyfriend however, commented he would probably not come back. The food was good he said, but with service like that, why come back? There are so many great places to eat in the city, with better service. Can't argue with that."},{"name":"Jamba Juice","address":"700 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Actually - there is now a Jamba Juice in the International Village at Northeastern University.

I really feel like they definitely could do their own bread cause what they served was nothing to write home about. \\n\\nI had a strawberry lime cider that I'd never heard of. It was presented in a tall glass with crushed ice and came out pink...The group of 6 women next to our table were so enamored with my drink that half of them ordered the same one. \\n\\nWe started with the \\"butters\\". Lime-basil and Curry guava. Both were interesting combinations of flavors but not too overwhelming. It came with plenty of that bland bread I mentioned.\\n\\nWe ordered sweet corn risotto and the twice fried French fries with the saffron garlic aioli. Amazing fries. The sweet corn risotto was billed as \\"heavy truffle\\" but it wasn't so bad. It was earthy but not salty overdone truffle flavors.  \\n\\nThe real stars were the entrees we got. The grilled loup de mer and the pork belly. \\nThe pork belly was so amazing I was really impressed that it was cooked so perfectly but the waitress did say they did sous vide it for 12 hours. The pork belly is on a bed of sweet rice but looked like lentils. \\nThe loup de mer was in a delicious \\"beer\\" blanc sauce their version of buerre blanc with beer instead of white wine. Potato and fennel hash was so tasty. Make sure to ask for bread to dip in when you finish the fish. \\n\\nFor dessert we had the flourless chocolate torte with pistachios and berries. I definitely recommend it. It was like fudge.\\n\\nService was great. I think our server was chef/owners gf and her passion and love of the food was overt and contagious.

Overall, this dish was excellent except for the fact that, the potato comes along the side was a little bit cold. \\n\\nThe \\"Juggernaut\\" is a waffle sandwich that stacked up with pieces of fried chicken, eggs, candied bacon and cheeses. On top of honey and syrup drizzle, it comes with a small container of strawberry jam. I like the combination of the savory fried chicken with the sweetness of the syrup.

It is one of the customizable concepts, but their specialty is healthy foods. \\nI absolutely love the decor around the restaurant with plants everywhere; it makes it look more welcoming and relaxing. The speed of the line is great! Since they only offer bowls and everything is already prepped and just needs to be served, the line moves pretty quickly. \\nYou have a choice between 4 or 6 and each has a preset amount of base, protein, veggie, and sauce. If this is your first time trying, do a 4, that way you don't have to make too many choices. \\nMy favorite base is sweet potato noodles. They so delicious! Another tip, if you don't want any veggies, you can substitute it with a base. \\nI am not a huge fan of how their veggies look on a line, but they are fresh and crunchy when you get them in the bowl. They do change the options sometimes, so you might not always get what you like. \\nAs of protein, it is hit or miss, sometimes you get a fresh batch of chicken, and sometimes it is dry and tastes like it has been sitting for a while. The steak though has a lot of flavors and very tender. \\nIf you become a regular, try all of the sauces they offer, they are all good, and have a nice flavor profile. They offer healthier soda and a nice variety of teas. \\n\\nOverall, I love this place. I do think it is pricey, especially if you get a steak(+$1.50) or avocado(+$2.00) on your bowl, but I do feel good about eating there.

My daughter's macaroni and cheese and our salads came out before our glass of wine and bottle of beer.  When our food came out it was dropped on a platter 10 feet from our table by a food runner where it sat getting cold for over 5 minutes.  As servers walked by continuously and even stared at it curiously, no one seemed interested in handing us the two plates.  I considered getting up and serving myself.  Finally a Good Samaritan server (who seemed appalled) brought the food over, apologized, offered to heat it up again for us, and said she would talk to the manager (more on her later).  That was the \\"third time that had happened tonight\\"...my wife ordered a second glass of wine which never came.  After waving my credit card around for 10 minutes (we had a 2 year old with us) my wife stormed up to the hostess stand to explain our situation to the aforementioned manager, asked to have the second glass of wine removed from the bill, and cashed out.  Manager could not have cared less, didn't even apologize.

It was a Sunday evening and the wait was horrendous. I had the kids in tow who were starting to fade, so you know how that goes. Right away I had to ask if it was OK for kids to be in there because it definitely smacks more of bar than restaurant.\\nTo boot, it was raining severely when we arrived so we were kind of stuck and committed to wait. \\nQuality of the wait? If you like standing around in the middle of someone's living room with a drink in your hand (that you had to go get yourself from the bar), no where to sit, and no choice but to stare at each other, then you are in for a treat. \\nWhy on earth Thurman's does not turn the 'waiting' area into more seating for dining beats me. \\nThe host and wait service is practically non-existant. This is definitely the type of place where you would be better served to park it at the bar. In fact, that is my recommendation for this place because the bar seating is first come first serve, no waiting, except for a seat to open up.\\nStrangely, it was hot/humid in the waiting area, but cooler in the dining area. \\nThe food that I saw, did look promising for burger fare. Big portions. Reasonable prices, minimal service. Very college.\\nHere is what your wait could be:  We arrived approx 7:30pm, were seated approx 9pm, waited for our order for about 30 minutes. (That's two hours for those counting) We finally had to ask where the hell our food was when people after us started getting served food first, and  our severely lacking waitress confessed that she had completely dropped our order and it never made it from our table to the kitchen, 15 feet if that. Obviously at that point, we were beside ourselves and our patience had come to an end. Like I mentioned earlier, we were there to indulge our younger dear friend, but unfortunately, she never got to actually taste a burger, just look at them. \\nGiving this place the benefit of the doubt, maybe on a good day you could get in, eat a good burger and get out. But if what we experienced is considered the norm, then I would say totally not worth it. There are plenty of other good places to eat in Columbus that would be glad to take your money and deserve it ;-) \\nSo, at almost 10pm at night now, we cruised up to Short North from the German Village, hit Marcella's, who to their credit, whipped out a lovely meal in no time and we were done eating and out the door by 10:45pm. Thank you Marcellas for salvaging our dinner :-)\\nThurman's, never again! :-(\\nIn fact, if anyone in the know can recommend any place good in the German Village, I am all ears.

Very difficult to find parking, so best to find public transportation, walk, or Uber.\\n\\nWe got the clam chowder, Johnny cakes, Hot lobster rolls, and Nantucket Striped bass.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was more on the thinner, runny side, but the flavor was really good and there was a good amount of clams.  The lobster rolls were really packed with lobster and tasted very fresh.  Johnny cakes were unusual, but very delicious.  Mix and sweet and savory.  I am usually a huge fan of striped bass due to the buttery taste of it, but I wasn't really impressed with my order for this one.

We also had Bloody Mary which was super flavorful and pickled veggies a nice touch.  I had bubble cocktail which was ok not memorable.\\n\\nThe server was nice but disappeared at times.

Hand pulled noodles aren't inherently supposed to be spicy, but if they want to go that route they should put that on menu or at least mention that. Otherwise, a waste of money and time.

At Pokeatery across the street you can also get a huge box for $14, but they serve more expensive items (sushi grade fish) whereas Woko Loko serves chicken, beef, etc. The price definitely needs to change. Second of all, my noodles were drowning in sauce. It was like drinking a salty soup that has noodles in it.

We came through expecting to wait a bit, but when we were quoted a possible 2.5 hour wait, we opted to go grab a snack in the meantime.  You can leave your name with the girl at the door, and she'll call you when your table is ready.  We were called back right around 6 pm, and chose a seat at the bar instead of a table.  I think our bar seats were a good idea.  The restaurant is very small, and the tables are very close together.  I had a glass of the Riesling which was a great choice to pair with my Oysters.  We tasted 6 different oysters, all of which were delicious.  They all taste like they've come straight from the ocean onto your plate.  The real bell of the ball, however, was the lobster roll.  Hot with butter.  The Good Lord Himself must've been in the kitchen cooking up that lobster roll, because there is no other explanation.

To top it off, there were a large number of homecoming students there yet our food still came quickly and service didn't suffer. That's impressive to me. \\n\\nI ordered the grilled chicken Alfredo. One thing I've noticed about BJ's is their menu is TOO large and varied. On one hand it's nice because people have options, but on the other hand it makes it hard for them to really excel at any particular dish. If someone asked me what type of food they serve, I wouldn't know how to respond. Some meals are really good, some are quite mediocre. Today, the meal was on the mediocre side. I was pleased that the Alfredo was a perfect consistency and didn't have the oily texture that some have. However, it was just bland. Nothing popped about it. The grilled chicken itself was good, but the sauce was under seasoned.

There was NO wait! YES!!! We tried to stop in a couple of weeks ago and there was an hour wait so we decided to take a pass...I'm seeing now that that was a big mistake! It is SO worth the wait! \\n\\nThe first thing that I noticed (being a new mommy and all) is that they have a baby changing station in the women's restroom!!!

Everything sounded so delicious! From the wide selection of fries, burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches...it was all enough to make one's mouth water! \\n\\nI ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu with a small salad and Brian ordered the Thurman Burger. Each meal comes with potato chips and a pickle. We also ordered a small order of fries for the babes. Let me first start with saying that the portion sizes are HUGE! My small salad was a pretty decent size and I had enough dressing for a large salad. This was really nice since I usually have to ask for a second side of dressing. The small order of fries looked like a large order as well! The fries are nice and thick so if you like steak fries - this is your spot! I couldn't finish my sandwich so we ended up taking half of my sandwich and the plate of fries home. Brian struggled with finishing his burger as well, but ended up eating every last bite. Side note - We didn't even touch our potato chips...that's how enormous and filling the sandwiches are.\\n\\nLastly, the wait staff is FANTASTIC! Every now and then...a different person would come and check to make sure that everything was ok. Our waitress consistently checked on us as well. When we decided not to order our daughter a drink with the juice selection that the restaurant had, our waitress went above and beyond and decided to make her version of a juice that our daughter would like and she LOVED it! Not many servers would do that. She didn't even charge us for the drink which earned her a couple extra percentages in her tip! \\n\\nThurman's is nothing short of 5 stars!

Since the restaurant is located at the intersection of Virginia and Highland, the heart of Virginia Highland, I used the extra time to walk around the neighborhood.\\n\\nMurphy's has a small bakery and wine bar, covered outdoor patio, and ample seating in the various dining areas inside.  It has a casual and fun atmosphere.  For parking, you can use their complimentary valet service or parallel park along the residential streets.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty straightforward.  They serve many common Southern brunch items (pancakes, shrimp and grits, eggs, and baked goods) and also have \\"frittatas,\\" which are open-faced omelettes.  The menu describes the eggs as \\"cage free.\\"\\n\\nI ordered their special for the day, which was a pork tenderloin over buttermilk biscuits with poached eggs on top.  It came with a side, so I chose the cheddar grits.  I also sampled their southwest frittata, which consists of pork chorizo, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, tortilla strips, and sour cream.  In addition, a basket of buttermilk biscuits and pumpkin muffins were served at each table.  The bread basket came with a small sealed jar of Knotts Berry Farm strawberry preserves and butter.\\n\\nThe special was good.  The poached eggs were white and fluffy, the pork was juicy and tender, and the buttermilk biscuits were delicious.  The cheddar grits were awesome -- full of flavor.  Along with West Egg's grits, they're among favorites so far in Atlanta.  The southwest frittata was okay.  I'm not a fan of eating tortilla chips for breakfast/brunch.  The pumpkin muffins were nice and moist.  Overall, the food was pretty good and was served in big portions.\\n\\nThe service could have been better.

The best thing about this bar is the atmosphere. If you like to watch sports there's plenty of TVs around the bar. The hard thing is finding a seat when it's a big game. If coming for the weekend be ready for the big crowds. They also have a sometimes ok usually awful DJ so it becomes just like the rest of the shit on Park Street. \\n\\nI would go to BBR for the happy hour. It has some okay beers on draft.

For most days of the week, I'd call this a 3.5 star buffet experience, assuming the food is roughly the same on days other than Sunday.  It's not expensive, and kids 5 and under are free, so it's reasonable if you're hungry.  I rounded the rating up to four because the service and staff we interacted with were excellent.\\n\\nHowever, we'll just call it a five star experience if Sunday is factored in, as they're one of, or perhaps the only, hotel not part of Disney to have a character breakfast.  There is a catch; it's only on Sundays.  In any case, my four year old met Minnie and Pluto, along with two other characters I didn't recognize (a bear and a fox), but she didn't care; it was a fantastic experience.  The character 'handler' was also excellent; he took pictures for us using my camera and made sure we liked them before they moved on to the next tables.\\n\\nFYI, there may be a 'weekend getaway' package which includes passes for this buffet so you can just roll it all into the hotel booking, but they sometimes forget to give you the passes at check-in.

The waitress said the ones listed on the menu were appetizer portion but I could upgrade to an entree size for another $10 I think, taking it from 3oz to 6oz. Since I'd already had some breadsticks, pizza, and mozzarella, I decided to stick with the smaller portion which turned out to be just right.

What we received with the Tapas Tasting Menu was a dreary exercise in blandness.  6 tiny dishes (yes, I know tapas are supposed to be small...but 6 cubes of cheese small?).  The anchovy-on-toast had 0 fish flavor (how is that even possible with anchovies?), but was awash in a bland mayonaisse-y sauce.  The aforementioned cheese dish was just a few cubes of manchego dusted in paprika, with a couple of olives - good cheese, but shouldn't there be something else going on in that dish?  The mushroom and sausage dish had almost no mushroom flavor.  The sausage pieces were tasty (all three 1/4\\" sized pieces) but were bizarrely bold compared to the insipid mushroom gravy in which they swam.  The crowning glory of this fiasco was the cheese sticks, er, pardon \\"aged cheddar croquettes\\"...that tasted almost exactly like the cheese sticks from Roosters (i.e. creamy center, breaded exterior).  The difference, of course, was that our $5 plate of cheese sticks contained 3 pieces, each half the size of my pinky finger.\\n\\nTo top it off, the wine was thoroughly forgettable.  At ten dollars a glass, I want something memorable.  Instead we got a servicable white and a harsh Rioja utterly lacking in complexity.

We won't be back to this rude establishment."},{"name":"Cattle Ranch","address":"2700 S Sanford Ave","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"I've lived a mile away from this place for a year and I never went inside until recently. From the outside it looks like a strip club - there's literally no windows! (ok, well there's one window next to the door). It's also not in the greatest neighborhood in town, or at least not in the kind of neighborhood you'd associate with having restaurants. I'm surprised city ordinances even allow this place to be here (was probably grandfathered in?).\\n\\nAnyhow, my friend and I decided to eat dinner here on a random Tuesday night. LOTS of seating in here. I can't imagine this place is ever more than half full. It was not very busy, but that's not surprising.\\n\\nThe first thing I notice is that this place has a very uh.. rural/blue collar vibe to it. It's not faux country, it's legit country. This could be the set for a Jeff Foxworthy movie or something. Not that I'm saying it's a nasty dive, just that it's not nearly as fancy as they want it to be.\\n\\nEven the plates and silverware look like they were picked up at a flea market or came from someone's house. I literally have better flatware in my apartment. The utilensiles were very uncomfortable and my steak knife was dull - it was essentially a butter knife with a wooden handle.\\n\\nAnyway, the menu looks like a small town diner menu: small and laminated with just plain text and no photos. They have a 6lb steak challenge that reminds me of that John Candy movie \\"The Great Outdoors\\". \\n\\nPrices were comparable to Outback, which isn't bad, but seems a tad high. \\n\\nI ordered the surf-n-turf which is a petite steak with shrimp. My friend just got the petite steak. When it arrived I noticed that her steak was almost twice the size of mine. WTF?\\n\\nI ordered mine medium and it was indeed medium - which is difficult to do when the cut is so thin. Both of our steaks were clearly slathered in a salt and butter glaze. I will say the steak was quite tasty, though. I didn't even need any steak sauce (or \\"seasoning\\" as the waitress called it). \\n\\nAll steaks come with two sides so I got a salad and \\"buck skins\\". The salad was pretty lame - just romaine or iceberg lettuce with a couple cherry tomatoes, a slice of green pepper and some red onions and a whole bunch of croutons. Ranch dressing was nice. The potato skins were insanely large for a \\"side.\\" This was literally the size of an appetizer! The cook must've put 2lbs of cheese on it. When it came out, the cheese had coagulated to the plate and it wasn't even steaming, but when I took a piece of the potato it was still very hot under all that cheese. I only ate half of it. That's just way too much cheese! In fact, it's way too much food for a \\"side.\\" (although I appreciate a good value).\\n\\nThe shrimp was nice, but the buttery dip was salty as hell. My friend just got broccoli and sauteed mushrooms with her steak. They were both good (in retrospect, that's what I should've got). \\n\\nService was okay. The servers don't wear uniforms, or even aprons for that matter. Our waitress was perfectly pleasant, but she kept making jokes that we didn't get. Like when my friend asked if she could get a to-go box the waitress joked that they're a clean plate house... just kidding. Umm, okay.\\n\\nWhat's really disappointing about this place is that the beer menu is abysmal - just all macro fizzy yellow beer (the fact the beers were only $3.50 each is quite a bargain these days!). Absolutely nothing craft at all (except maybe Yuengling). The waitress brought the bottles to the table along with PLASTIC mugs (what am I - a kid?). I didn't even see if they had any wine on the menu, but I can't imagine it'd be anything other than Franzia or something that comes in a box.\\n\\nBetween the two of us we had three beers, two steaks, some shrimp, a salad, potato skins, and veggies and the total after tax was about $55. Not bad I guess \\n\\nSo I wouldn't say this place is bad, but it's got so much potential to be so much more. I hate to say it, but this is what rednecks consider fancy. And if that's what they're going for then mission accomplished. And if you understand that going in you won't be disappointed. Like I said, the food was good and the service was decent.

The menu often doesn't list an ingredient or two, which can be a problem. My boyfriend has several allergies and we have needed to ask them to remake things because they didn't list the allergens, and I've needed to ask them to remake things because cilantro tastes like soap to me and it wasn't disclosed as an ingredient on the menu.

I wanted the veggie sandwich with no tomato but I was too intimidated to ask for no tomato.

There was one person on cash, but she also had to get coffees and bakery items. She got someone's coffee order wrong so had to pour it again. And then someone all the staff knew came in, so they all stopped what they were doing to talk to her. The customer with the wrong coffee order actually had to interrupt them to ask if she could have her coffee -- by the way it isn't from a latte machine or anything, it's just regular drip coffee out of a thermos so it isn't like it has to be \\"made\\". \\n\\nAt the end of the day, there were 5 staff behind the counter but only one person doing the cashier/bakery job, so the line grew and grew and people's food just sat there already made but unpaid for.

Maybe they would claim link to pagan superpowers with Neptune himself? Okay that's taking the metaphor too far, but in any case, Neptune Oyster lives up to the hype. \\n\\nWe each started off with a clam chowder, and it's not what I expected--it was better. I'm used to creamy, chunky clam chowder that's heavy on potatoes, and Neptune's version was lighter and with a consistency halfway to that of a soup. It's a surprise after mentally preparing yourself for something indulgent, but you can actually appreciate the subtle flavors of the clams instead of a Campbell's cream of potato. They were also very generous on the portion of fresh whole clams. \\n\\nSimilarly, the hot butter lobster roll was no less than epic, even though it was again different from the mayo-based lobster salad rolls I had pictured. Neptune's embraces lobsta rolls in its purest form: an overwhelming serving of pure lobster, minimally dressed with a thin layer of butter, sandwiched in a fluffy brioche bun with just enough carbiness to complement the lobster which stole the show. The fries completed the feast.\\n\\nTip: The food was delicious and the portions were big. I split with a friend where we each got a clam chowder and shared the lobster roll, and it was the perfect amount of food (with just enough space for a cannoli afterwards). The other seafood looked amazing as well, and I don't think you could go wrong with anything.\\n\\nTip #2: The space is fall and this place is infamously popular, so I suggest getting here early (i.e. by 5pm on weekdays, and even then expect a wait). They do have a nice system where you can leave your cell phone number and they will alert you when the table is almost ready, so you can wander around the quaint neighborhood and soak in the rustic Italian ambiance while waiting."},{"name":"Big Fin Seafood Kitchen","address":"8046 Via Dellagio Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I am taking the time to write this review because we literally had the worst waiter ever at this restaurant on Saturday night. \\n\\nFirst, he took about 25+ minutes to come and take our orders (we were not even offered to order drinks). \\nEven when we ordered our food, the waiter did not ask whether we wanted to order drinks. I ordered a grilled mahi, and he interrupted me by asking \\"don't you like the sesame crusted mahi instead?\\" I was like \\"uh no\\" (especially since I told him I was gluten free and the sesame fish was not!) After I ordered my dish I had to stop him from going to the next person to order my glass of wine. \\n\\nI told him I was gluten free and he asked in front of the whole party what kind of reaction I had when eating gluten. What if I had diarrhea and didn't want to share this with the other couple we just met? He then said that his son has autism and acts crazy when he eats gluten, which was awkward since we were having a conversation with the other couple and he interrupted us to tell this to us.\\n\\nThen when the dishes finally arrived (at least 50 minutes after we arrived at the restaurant), mine had a side green beans (which I did not order) and did not have the coleslaw or the beurre blanc sauce (which I did order.) Our friend had ordered blackened fish and it arrived grilled. When our friend complained to the server about the mistake, the server did NOT apologize and said that he had heard \\"grilled\\" since everybody else ordered grilled. That attitude pissed off our friend. \\n\\nThen we were in the middle of finally eating our entree when the waiter shows up and says \\"I am going to bring your dessert menus\\". At that point we looked at each other and concluded that the man had serious comportemental issues. \\n\\nAnyways, he then brought our friend with the blackened/grilled fish situation a dessert menu and told him that he would give him one free dessert since he had messed up his order, BUT he didn't give a dessert menu to the other three people in our party! So we had to rotate the menu around the table to select our desserts. \\n\\nThe WHOLE experience was totally odd.

But I don't know how to start my review. I think daydreaming about marrow bones makes it hard to focus...\\n\\nOkay, so I was initially somewhat conflicted about Little Bird. I stopped in for lunch and sampled a fantastic cocktail (the Van Cleef) and the coq au vin. It was... good, but not as good as other examples of this seminal French dish I'd had before. The cocktail made everything alright, but when the final bill came I thought to myself \\"hmmm.... this is kind of a pricey lunch in a town where I can get pretty gourmet food from a cart on a street corner for under $10.\\" While I had thoroughly enjoyed sitting at the bar in this stylish-yet-casual space, and the service had been top notch, and I knew that the folks in the kitchen are some of the most talented in town, I was a little confused about how I felt. Something didn't quite sit right, which is why I waited to write a review. \\n\\nAfter a full dinner at Little Bird, I've come away with at least one certainty - I am a big fan. Like St. Jack, Little Bird provides a nice happy medium for French food in Portland. It's not as expensive as big bird (aka Le Pigeon), it has a solid mix of the classic semi-casual french bistro feel but with amazing and attentive service, and the food is downright good for the price. With the most expensive menu items topping out in the low-to-mid 20's, it's accessible (at least as far as price goes - good luck getting in without a reservation) and brings a higher level of food quality than a lot of similar-yet-overpriced Portland eateries. \\n\\nDining in a group of four, we sampled a delicious mix of Little Bird offerings. Starting with a fantastic butter lettuce salad, cheese plate, mussels with lemon-salt fries and marrow bones, we cruised through a decent selection of the small plate offerings. I wish we could have tried the fresh oysters (kumamoto and hama hama were on the fresh sheet) and the beef tartare, but 4 apps for 4 people was enough. For drinks, we started with a tasty sparkling ros√©, and proceeded to the French Soda cocktail, a Pernod creation with a distinct anise front. Tasty. Later on I had the Jus de Pomme, a tasty Laird's Applejack concoction of which I could drink at least 10 glasses.\\n\\nFor mains, I had the short rib, which was a fantastic piece of fall-off-the-bone beef (still on the rib bone) sitting atop potato medallions and cooked carrots. The dish had a great array of flavors and did not disappoint in the least. The potatoes and carrots had a solid, earthy flavor spiked with fresh herb notes. The beef... well, let's just say I'm a sucker for short rib done right. Hilary B's trout was on the salty side but the flavor profile was explosive - so much going on. Each bite was like a savory adventure. After a couple of bites the salt began to take over, but paired with a nice crisp white, it would be about right. We also gushed over a side of the mushrooms, obviously cooked to caramelized perfection in butter for a salty, heady, mushroomy deliciousness.\\n\\nFor dessert we moved on 3 options from a menu bursting with possibilities: a hazelnut financier with cured cherries and ice cream, a fantastic layered dessert with chocolate mousse and caramel, and the lavender creme brulee. All three were impressive by any standard. My favorite was the financier, while the remainder of the table was divided on their top picks. \\n\\nLittle Bird is definitely not cheap dining (unless you slide in for the $12 Le Pigeon burger), but you could easily spend a lot more money on food with much less substance and flavor at many of Portland's lauded restaurants. And you'd have to deal with a lot more pretense to do so. I believe that these guys have found a very happy medium between gourmet food and unpretentious vibe. You get what you pay for, and you enjoy paying for it. In a town filled with restaurants that try to force their version of the dining experience on the patrons (eat it our way or leave), It's a welcome reminder that good food can be enjoyed without all of that nonsense. \\n\\nMake yourself a reservation and hit up a special meal here. You'll enjoy it."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite spot for oysters \\nI don't eat oysters any where else any more \\nTry the Japanese ones with sweet texture"},{"name":"Oviedo Brewing Company","address":"1280 Oviedo Mall Blvd, Ste 1095","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4","text":"I've been here three times now and I really like this place.

When we got their, no reservations for our group were set up. They claimed nobody called. When we showed the manager the call log history in her phone, he stated, \\"the call was too short and there was no way we could have made reservations in that short period of time\\". Pretty much calling her a liar! After he saw the group was pissed, he tried to sit us at a big table in the bar area. Right when we were getting ready to sit down, the waitress said \\"the max I've seen sit at this table is 7, you have 8, good luck, and I'll need to see all of your ID's. Are you kidding me?!? We walked out and will never step foot in that place again.\\n\\nI am a regional manager in the customer service industry, and I can tell you right now, if this behave continues, they will be out of business. Too many restaurants in Portland to accept this kind of behavior.\\n\\nYou know what they say in the customer service industry. If a customer is satisfied, they may refer you to a friend or two.

My friends and I were staying at the Nines Hotel which was relatively close by. We stumbled in on a Thursday for happy hour and were welcomed and pleased by the staff and food. We ordered a few drinks and they were well made. For food, we had the radicchio salad and the country pate board. Both were great, but I was especially blown away by how simple and delicious the radicchio salad was. Whatever dressing they concocted, I'd buy a bucket of it!\\n\\nWe loved this place so much that we returned a second time two days later for brunch. At around 9:30am on a Saturday, we were told a wait for 3 was around 45 minutes. We obliged and was informed they'd call us to let us know before our table was ready so we could mosey our way back on over if we wanted to explore around. I received a call about 30 minutes later saying our table would be ready in 15, and once we got back, we were happily seated. For the 3 of us, we decided to do a couple of cocktails and dishes family style. We did the radicchio salad again (not a surprise), the charcuterie board, the papas bravas, brussel sprouts, Bim bop and all 5 dishes were just the right amount of food. The charcuterie board was nice and simple - not heavy and overdone. The papas bravas were perfectly fried and spiced, with an amazing garlic sauce drizzle and fried egg. The Brussel sprouts were one of the best I've ever had - really unique with the touch of umami, sweetness, and perfectly fried. While my girlfriends enjoyed the bim bop, it was just ok to me - I think a little more gochuchang or spice would have made it perfect. \\n\\nDefinitely check out this fantastic tapas style place if you're in downtown Portland!"},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is by no means bad but everything about the meal was a little off.

We brought our 2 yr old and 4 yr old and they loved drawing in the dirt and running around the \\"yard\\".

Pasta+booze+kid friendly= my kind of scene. \\nWhen it was time to order there was a guy outside giving everyone tips on what to order and how to order. Due to this instruction I ended up ordering two meals for just myself because I couldn't decided and didn't know when I would be able to convince anyone to go back. I ordered the red sauce with a baseball sized meatball and the pepper/olive oil pasta thing with Italian sausage. I could eat those meatballs for the rest of my life and die a very happy gal.

We wanted to keep it light as we planned to eat at multiple places throughout the day, so we split their french toast and Cowboy Breakfast (that's a light breakfast for us haha). French toast was amazing - soft bread lightly crisped and the blueberry syrup was soo tasty. I liked how the syrup had real blueberries in it. But the winner of this brunch was forsure their Cowboy Breakfast. The skirt steak was cooked to medium rare perfection and tenderness, well-seasoned, and the eggs, tortillas, and baked beans all complemented each other. The salsa was delicious as well.

Although they were busy, and there was only one server we didn't have any problem ordering or getting our food promptly.

Yes, I did just use an outdated 90's phrase to describe this delectable meal, and I'm not ashamed...okay maybe a little. Instead of using some sort of weird fishy yam noodle, they shred a variety of veggies. I saw shredded cabbage, carrots, onions among beansprouts, mushrooms, broccoli, and green onion. I ordered it with chicken, and it was a very large dish weighing in at a small dinner price of $9.50! I had it for two meals. The sauce on it was a homemade recipe, nothing like the usual bright pinkish-orange pad thai sauce we all know. It was more of a chili based sauce with hint of sweetness and maybe some soy, but the flavor was delicious. I even picked the spice level (medium was plenty spicy for me). I also had a bite of the pineapple fried rice, and although raisins and curried rice aren't my thing, it was respectable. And the man seemed to love it. He also split it into 2 meals, and I think it cost around $12.50. All in all I am super impressed with the freshness, uniqueness, and flavors of this place.

Today I visited the College Ave location and purchased four dozen donuts for school children with a variety of special dietary needs including some children that are vegan, some gluten-freeÔøΩ? some with nut allergies, etc. \\nBecause of this, I asked the woman at the register if we could select and box the items as I ordered in front of me (this way, I could confirm and keep track of my all-vegan‚Äãn box, my regular assorted box, my no nut box, ensure specific donuts are separated as they were layered/papered in the correct order to separate the different needs, etc., and label the outside of the box myself before I dropped them off). The woman looked at me with a strange look, a clear grimace, said okay, but did not comply with my request. She only rang up the donuts. I asked again if we could select and box in front of me to keep track of the donut placement.  She said that would be harder for her (still grimacing). I asked a third time, explaining that I needed specific donuts separate, and asked if there might be a manger available to help me ensure I could see the donut placement and confirm they were arranged in the manner I requested. She did not get a manager and seemed extremely annoyed with my request. She (very reluctantly, with a demeanor that was not customer service oriented) asked a coworker to box in my view while she rang the order (I am not sure why she was so insistent on staying at the register, we could have written all the donuts down and rang them up after if that would have helped her process). The coworker only did one box, and after that one box, walked away. I again (fourth time), had to explain that I would like to select and watch the donut placement.  In the end, I only got to see one box made. The administrators at the school had to go to the website and review each donut to check and separate them (school staff had to take time out of their busy day to do what I was trying to do in the store as they were boxed). Of course, they ended up not being placed in the order I requested, the order that separated each dietary need. Not only was this a major inconvenience for me, but school staff (who already do so much each day) had to dedicate unnecessary time fixing something that could have been easily done in store if customer service was the cashier's priority. \\n\\nWhen you spend $109.08 on donuts ($119.08 with the $10 tip), you expect that a request as simple as separating the donuts in a particular way could be handled. And to top it all off, the cashier simply moved to the next transaction after handing me my receipt without a simple \\"thank you\\" or \\"have a nice day\\" (even after she saw I tipped them $10 for their time, despite her rudeness and lack of desire to even attempt to fulfill my very simple request). \\n\\nI have ordered larger orders form Revolution Donuts in the past, but after this experience, I do not think Revolution Donuts will be the best place to turn for large orders that require attention to special dietary needs. This is the second time there has been a problem with a large order. This time, a child could have been harmed or had an allergic reaction (that is no small matter)."},{"name":"Paddlefish Restaurant","address":"1670 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Tonight we had one of the best dinners we have ever had in Orlando!!!

It was way too salty so you need a bit of ketchup to help with that.

We are also all sub 190 lbs so it's not like we eat that much.\\n\\nFood: good. The bulgogi was delicious and so was the kimchi. The ribs were just ok.\\n\\nOverall: would not go back. The whole experience was awkward and overpriced."},{"name":"Jack in the Box","address":"7815 NE 6th Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"1.5","text":"Worst ever,I see homeless people with a better hygiene than staff at this restaurant.

Bread was incredible- exactly like the kind they use in New Orleans. I wonder if they import in from LA. Fully dressed, you'll get onions, tomato, lettuce, banana peppers, and a side of their special tartar sauce. The shrimp fell flat for me. I mean that literally. It wasn't plump and juicy like it should be, it was thin and overcooked. Also not very crispy.
