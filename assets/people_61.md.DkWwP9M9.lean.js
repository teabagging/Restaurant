In a fit of seasonal affective disorder giddiness, we decided that the only solution to our problems would be to recreate a warm July day in our apartment. And gosh darn it, we were going to do it that night! We discussed turning the thermostat up to 80 and donning our favorite summer duds. We happily plucked a bottle of gin off the shelf in order to mix the classic summer cocktail. \\"Now what for dinner?\\" we pondered, \\"what screams summer here I come?\\" \\n\\nSeafood of course! \\n\\nRemembering friends' and neighbors' happy recommendations of Out of Blue, we headed down there, ready to get our summer party started. Our take out order of sauteed calamari, crab cakes, tomato and mozzarella salad, and fisherman's platter were ready in a much quicker time than expected, and we hurried home to get this picnic underway. Heat cranking, drinks poured, we started to dig in. Soon all mouths were full as we chewed. And chewed. And chewed some more. Is it time to swallow yet? \\n\\nCalamari. Chewy. \\nTomato. Chewy \\nMozzarella. Chewy. \\nFried seafood. Chewy. \\nCrab cakes. Not chewy. But crumbly isn't much better. \\n\\nThis is where the sad faces began. Second bites revealed more of the same.

Too bad, I would kick total butt on I Love Money. \\n\\nFast forward a few weeks and the decision was made to give Out of the Blue a second chance. \\"This time we'll dine in!\\" we exclaimed, willing to place blame on the travel time associated with take out. \\n\\nThis is where the sad faces began. Again. Distant waitstaff all but refused to make eye contact. Fried Calamari remained chewy. Entrees of seafood risotto and baked scallops fared a bit better, but would have been much improved if they were served warmer than room temperature. How a \\"baked\\" dish is served cold is beyond me. Our waiter didn't comment on barely touched dishes and declined doggie bags.

Got to the buffet and they confirmed our reservation and then sat us down out in the open, nowhere near the lakeside views.

I am not sure how everyone who had kids was able to eat there today...they must have paid out of their a****! That took away my appetite, and all of a sudden, the food we had eaten didn't taste good anymore. Then they tried to charge us $4 for each mimosa we had, when the bartender himself had said it was a $3 mimosa special. The waitress went to talk to him, then the manager came and in the end, he ended up giving us $2 back in cash because of the misunderstanding. I guess I misunderstood how pricey this place was, and their food was good but it wasn't worth the money we paid, considering we didn't even get a lakeside view. When we left the buffet and walked around the Oasis, it became clear that there were other places we could have eaten, and I felt in general that my wife was saying, \\"I told you so!\\" in her mind, but sometimes she doesn't always tell me outright, and I know now, for places like this, it's best to just come and walk around and take in the view, and to bring your own food or snacks. There is no justification for paying a 15% gratuity onto a $34.95 per person buffet no matter how great the view is.

Glad it wasn't hashbrowns after all of our other heavy Disney eating.\\n+MICKEY-SHAPED WAFFLE: This is a malted waffle, and to be honest, kind of expensive for what it is since it comes with a single waffle, single strawberry, and 4 strips of bacon (you can also choose sausage). The waffle itself kind of tastes like cinnamon but was honestly a delicious waffle.\\n+STEAK AND EGGS: My boyfriend got this dish and the chimichurri sauce was delicious with the steak. It also had a nice char and cooked medium well on the inside. The cheesy hash brown was also delicious.\\n+BISCUITS: This is complimentary but I felt like I should include it, since it also comes with jab and butter. It's buttery and warm, and just a great start to the meal.\\n\\nAll in all, the service and food were great here. The portions aren't huge but the prices are okay when you take in mind that you're at a Disney resort. This was a great option for us to see both the resort and the restaurant (since we weren't staying there), and a great meal for us after a couple days at the parks.

The views at this venue are beautiful and truly an unique venue overlooking Lake Travis.   I think Oasis would be good for weddings with 150 people or less.  The wedding I attended had over 200 people (from what the bride told me) and it felt cramped.  The layout of the banquet room is long and narrow, with the dance floor in a different room.    We had heavy appetizers at the wedding with wine and beer.   The food left a lot to be desired.  I had high hopes that the less than stellar food I often read about on yelp would have been better for a wedding.  As I was in line to get food, the sliders (which were just hamburgers cut in half) were cold.  How on earth are they going to let cold hamburgers come out of the kitchen?  They also had some cheese, fruits, crackers, queso, spinach dip and quesadilla's.  The food was just kind of blah.  The one shining star was the BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor with the BBQ sauce.

Pretty cool if you ask me, but after your third or fourth one, you really get grossed out.\\n\\nThe way they cook it is pretty good too. I mean, the lobster is just a plain ole steamed lobster that you can have butter on the side but they have tons of fried foods (shrimp, clams, scallops and chicken) and baked goods (mussels and oysters and some kind of casserole). They have a decent dessert area with four different types of cake (at least, when I was there).\\n\\nService was good too. Our waitress was really funny and joked around with us while she was clearing our table of seafood remnants. The only bad thing is, well, the decor isn't what I expected. It's a little Hometown Buffet/Sizzler-ish in decor - it's just a normal average looking place, not totally ugly but not that great.\\n\\n**SEE PICTURES POSTED**"},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"3118 Daniels Rd","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"3","text":"It was surprisingly very busy for a Sunday night and the whole experience wasn't all that great.\\n\\nOur server was decent but didn't really go out of her way to make it a great dining experience.\\n\\nI wasn't too hungry (my mom actually wanted to come here) so I ended up just ordering some sides instead of a full meal. After reading the description on the menu, I was sold on the Steakhouse Mac & Cheese. I'll have to agree with Clark M. that the mac & cheese is good, real good!! It was made with a fun corkscrew pasta, 4 cheeses, and... bacon! Yes, anything made with bacon must be delicious! I also ordered a side of fresh seasonal vegetables to balance out my carb craving. The vegetables were steamed and not too flavorful but balanced out the heaviness of the mac & cheese.\\n\\nBesides my side dishes, the rest of my table's dishes were very poorly presented. A caesar salad came out with a piece of lettuce hanging off the side of a half-filled bowl. The other dishes looked like the food was just thrown on the plate with no thought into how it looked.\\n\\nLastly, before everyone was even done eating, our server brought out the check and left it on the table.

It was a little salty but I looove salt so no complaints here (it is really just that all the toppings are naturally salty). \\n\\nFor the meal, my cousin had a salad which was good, but obviously nothing to write about. I had the scaloppine di vitello con cinzano. They have two veal dishes, this is the breaded one, it sounded better to me because of the sauce. It was very good.

The pistachio-crusted Halibut on top of a bed of shrimp and asparagus risotto is INCREDIBLE. You feel like you're being totally indulged. I usually don't even like risotto. \\n\\nThey also have an extensive wine list, plenty of cocktails, and an atmosphere that doesn't at all say, \\"I'm in some hotel.\\" It has a classy, sort of up-scale atmosphere. The views are great, the food is great, even the hotel amenities seem very good. I'd say it's worth going out of your way for. While the location could be seen as a drawback- it's not right in Boston- there are plenty of transportation options. In the summer, it's fun to take the water taxi over, and while it's not so convenient, the T does run a bus there.

I have to say, the shabu shabu was one of the most disappointing ones I've had. The broth was so bland even with other ingredients cooked into it and all of the meat for the shabu shabu was odd.. had a definitely not fresh quality to it. The BBQ was pretty standard tasting. I don't know, even if the price is somewhat on the lower side for Japanese BBQ, it doesn't seem like much of a deal when the food is just blah.

My companion had the bruschetta, but they do it their own way at Crush.  I tasted it and the dish was very good, topped with brie, some sort of meat(I forget) and pears.  Dee-lish.  The servers seemed a bit stressed, but they were also slammed, so I'm sure they were just trying to keep their heads above water.  I'd like to make it out to Crush more often, I'm hoping to find a time when they are less crowded.  Go there, get the house specialty drinks, leave happy."},{"name":"New Ginza","address":"63-65 Galen St","city":"Watertown","stars":"3.5","text":"Great sushi in a nice place.

When you walk in there are 3 lines and you can wait on any one of them. All of the cashiers were very nice and quick. We looked up some of the more popular flavors and ended up getting chocolate chip, pistachio, and florentine. All 3 had very dense ricotta fillings and tasty shells but my favorite had to be the florentine because they add a coating on the shell that makes the texture that much better! Chocolate chip is just the florentine without the special crust and I liked that one as well because the slightly bitter chocolate chips balanced out the sweetness of the pastry. I wasn't a big fan of the pistachio...would probably pass on it next time. Mike's is an icon in Boston and reasonably so because the cannolis are so good!

In San Francisco it's called fusion cooking.  In this case it's Texas tradition mixed with Austin funkiness mixed with world flavors.\\n\\nThe piped-in music was all over the map, which was sometimes a bit jarring, but certainly contributed to the funkiness.  We were just there for lunch, but I poked my head around in the upstairs bar; very cool.  They also have live music several days a week.  Oh, and the food, of course, was extremely tasty.  The brisket is fabulous, and the rubs are very different.  If you're one of those who have already made up their minds about \\"what brisket is supposed to taste like\\" you won't be converted because this is more than just meat and sauce.  However, if you want to branch out a bit, this is the place to go.\\n\\nMore importantly, Lambert's is a totally different experience than the traditional BBQ joints (e.g., the Salt Lick, Iron Works).  This is where you take your snob guests, but that doesn't make it a snob-only joint.  The food is expensive, but when you add in the service and presentation it's really not that high.  It only seems high because people aren't used to paying $20-25 for barbecue. And besides, when was the last time you went to a BBQ restaurant and got oysters on the half shell served warm topped with wood-charred tomatoes, and mixed with apple-smoked bacon and pesto butter?  And believe it or not, it didn't overwhelm the oysters.\\n\\nI do have two complaints: \\n1) the entree portions really are too large to have if you're going to have anything else.  I'm sure that's because people are used to getting grotesque amounts of food from other BBQ places, plus they need to justify the prices.  Still, I would like to see the option of smaller plates at a slightly reduced price.\\n\\n2) I know the chefs are going for \\"gourmet,\\" but you're also in animal-friendly, liberal-minded Austin.  Do you really need to put foie gras and kobe beef on the menu?  I think there are better choices than two foods that come with the potential negativity.  If you're not going to do Texas beef (which, quite frankly, you shouldn't) how about midwestern beef instead?  And why not various pate choices instead of the foie gras?\\n\\nAll in all, though, a must-check-out place."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Yum.

I don't exactly know what's up with them, but I greatly enjoy them. Only one star off for the incredible wait."},{"name":"Czar Ice Bar","address":"56 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Last night was my first time trying this place.  My girlfriend dragged me here for drinks & sushi before her girls night out.  I wanted not to like it, because I'm not particularly fond of chic, upscale lounges, but I couldn't help myself.  It was good.\\n\\nThe ambience was almost surreal.  It was a little on the cold side in terms of temperature, but with the top of the bar made of solid ice, I wasn't surprised.  The color scheme was minimal - white and black (really a dark brown) set against the blue glow of the glass ceiling panels designed to look like an exaggerated night sky and the blue neon light at the bar.  A video on repeat of fun events involving the chef was projected onto the wall inside a painting frame.  Dance music was playing, but not at deafening levels.  We could still hold a conversation.\\n\\nOur waitress was a little unsure of herself, and seemed reluctant to check on the drinks, which took a little longer than I would have liked.  However, when they arrived, they weren't watered down at all, which was great, because the base price for most cocktails was around $12.  Czar has an incredible selection of vodkas and vodka infusions.  I think I recall the waitress citing a number somewhere around 200.  Anyone who's a vodka fan could have a great time here.\\n\\nThe chef was constantly walking around checking on people.  It seemed like whenever he wasn't in the middle of preparing some sushi, he was patrolling and making sure customers were having a good time.  Even though our service might have been a little slow, Chef Saito's hospitality made up for it.\\n\\nThe food was quite good.  It was much better than I was expecting, but I really didn't know anything about Chef Saito until I did some reading about him afterward.  We started out with the wasabi dumplings.  They were tender and juicy and had a nice kick of wasabi at the end to clear out the sinuses.\\n\\nAfter that, we tried sashimi.  We ordered the yellowtail, which wasn't on the sashimi list, but they'll prepare pretty much any fish they have as sashimi if you ask.  It was fresh and high quality.  I prefer to try sashimi before rolls, because it  makes it much easier to judge whether a restaurant is serving quality fish.\\n\\nNext, we tried two rolls - the iso roll and the yumi yumi roll.  They were a wonderful blend of textures and flavors.  Rolls are probably where Chef Saito's creativity really stands out.   If you value flavor above the feel of a traditional Japanese restaurant, and don't mind paying over $10 for a strong cocktail, I would give the place two thumbs up, even though they could work on the speed of the drink service a bit."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"To repeat what others have said, there wasn't a clear line, more of a mob to the counter with a lot of lingering people confusing the issue.

This might be stressful to those familiar with more organized shopping, and those suffering from claustrophobia as children squeeze around you to get a better look at the dessert case.\\n\\nThe number of cannoli options was overwhelming, but we picked out an Oreo filling (which was delicious). There are also a ton of other sweet options, like cheesecake, cupcakes, cookies, croissants. The M&M cookie might be the best I've had, but the black and white cookies are worth a pass. The cannoli were a bit pricey too, and we spent just over $20 on a cannoli, 4 cookies, and a chocolate croissant.\\n\\nTaking a box to go was easy, and they offered a plastic bag to keep our cargo fresh in the rain.

Fresh sushi with decent portion sizes for a reasonable price, finally! \\n\\nFor starters the inside has some nice decor and is very roomy. You almost forget this place is in a strip mall next to Gold's Gym. We enjoyed some hot sake, the edemame, the salmon sushi, the spicy tuna roll, the yumi yumi roll, and the mexican roll. The sake was typical hot sake, but reasonable at $6 for a large 250 mL bottle. The edemame was nicely salted and hot, but some of the soy beans were a little over cooked. This is my only complaint from the whole experience at Yanagi. The complimentary miso soup was yummy and a welcome surprise. The salmon sushi was fresh and there was a good fish to rice ratio. The spicy tuna roll had a good amount of tuna in it and was tasty. We were happy to finally find a place that offered 8-10 pieces in a roll for a reasonable $7. The speciality rolls are a little more ranging from $10-$15 so it's nice to have the staple rolls like spicy tuna priced so well. The yumi yumi roll was yummy! It was the biggest roll we got and the combination of fried spicy tuna rolled with crab and topped with more raw tuna and ginger sauce was fantastic! Great texture and flavor. It is a nice middle ground when you're dining with people that prefer the cooked sushi rolls. The mexican roll was beautiful with thin layers of avocado on top. It was tasty, but basic since it was rolled with more spicy tuna and tempura shrimp. We knew it'd be a basic roll so the avocado on top and the spicy sauce was a nice surprise and really amped up the roll. Each roll came with 8-10 pieces and we felt it was a very good value. Top that off with excellent service and we were thrilled with Yanagi. \\n\\nYanagi is definitely the best place to get sushi in south south Austin. We've tried Umi, Shogun, and Zen and think Yanagi is far better than those places. It's definitely worth checking out if you're still looking for your own go to sushi place in town."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"When it comes to buffetts I tend to be a little skeptical.

My parents were in from out of town, and we wanted to go somewhere nice to celebrate my dad's 65th Birthday.  Although the food and the overall experience were good, what happened when we left was a completely different story.  My mom gave my boyfriend and me an envelope with a couple gifts cards, a Mega Millions ticket (drawing 2/20/2012) she purchased on her way from Connecticut, and receipts from some clothes she got me. All of these items were inside the unopened envelope. Long story short, I neglected to take the envelope off the table when we left that evening.  Upon realizing my mistake, I immediately called Zaftig's that night and spoke to Manager 1.  I explained to Manager 1 that I was just in there with a group, and I had forgotten a white envelope on the table.  He asked me what was inside the envelope, and I told him about the gift cards and rest of the contents.  He asked where the gift cards were from.  I told him, and to my seeming relief, he stated he had the gift cards, but there was no envelope, no lottery ticket, and no gift receipts. I told him that the gift cards were in an envelope with other things inside.  From the very start Manager 1 shot down my version of events in a dismissive, patronizing, and insulting manner. We went back and forth a little bit, because I knew, and the rest of the people at the table knew, that I did not even open the envelope at the table.  Manager 1 insinuated that I was either lying or forgetting where I put something, which was not only not the case, but also not the way in which a customer should be spoken to.  He also told me that \\"his guys\\" have turned in left-behind wallets with \\"hundreds of dollars in them\\", so my account of events must be wrong. \\n\\nI went back the next morning, hoping to speak to the other manager, Manager 2, because quite frankly, I was hurt and disappointed about the way I was spoken to by Manager 1.  Manager 2 was dismissive right from the start.  She handed me the gift cards that my mom had given us.  I told her that I was upset by the way I was spoken to by Manager 1. Like Manager 1, Manager 2 told me that I must be mistaken about what I left behind, and had the audacity to tell me to \\"do her a favor\\" and \\"call her if/when I find the white envelope.\\"  My version of events, as a customer, was given no credibility.  I was given no respect.  The worst part of it, when Manager 2 asked me what was in the envelope, aside from the gift cards, and I told her about the Mega Millions lottery ticket, her response was, \\"Well, I guess we will know when one of our guys becomes a millionaire.\\"    \\n\\nWhat has been most troubling from my experience with Zaftig's is not so much the fact that the contents of the envelope are gone forever now, but it was the defensive and argumentative way that the managers at Zaftig's spoke to me. If they had simply pretended to be concerned about the situation instead of disputing the credibility of what I was saying, I would have accepted the situation and moved on. Instead, now I actually feel worse about this situation after speaking to two Zaftig's managers than I did when I initially realized that I left something at their restaurant.  It is not the value of the contents, because really, barring any stroke of lottery luck, the contents were not incredibly valuable---it was the utter lack of respect, concern and courtesy I was shown by two different Zaftig's managers, who should have put the customer first. From my own experience in the customer service industry, I know that even if you don't believe the customer, pretend.  So, moral of the story--look out for tonight's Mega Millions drawing....Not only will the people at Zaftig's know if one of their guys becomes a millionaire, but now, all of you will too."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredible Holy (hottest) chicken sandwich.

Its more like comparing Starbucks to Urth Cafe. Mike's pastry is completely different from Modern Pastry. The ambiance, food, and mode of service is completely different. They have shiny ceiling and bright wall colors. There's like over a dozen types of cannoli filling (pistachio, chocolate, mocha, etc). The shop is about 3x bigger than Modern Pastry and are able to afford a seating area with a waitress, separate from the order and go line at the other half of the store. So, after trying Modern Pastry, I really wanted to try Mike Pastry's regular ricotti filled canolli with almonds ($3.50). This place is pricier, but the cannoli is larger in length and diameter. I really enjoyed the shell on the cannoli here because it was flaky (like a napolean or chinese dan ta - egg tart). However, I did not enjoy the pre-filled ricotta filling. \\n\\nAdditionally, the service at the front was rude and snobby. However, when we sat down, the waitress was sweet and gave us recommendations on our drinks. We got a cappuccino and it was soooooo delicious with the cannoli. Honestly, I wish I had more stomach room to try their pistachio filled cannoli.. I love pistachio anything. Ha, but yeah, if you're in Boston, definitely give this place a try. This place is definitely more for tourists and they embrace toursits. Ironically, I feel like this store's decor is more modern and should be called modern pastry instead, especially with all the different cannoli flavors too, funny how that worked out. Man, I cannot say one place is better than the other, because they truly are different. Id say Modern Pastry is more authentic and traditonal in taste, but Mike's Pastry offers more variety and novelty to the traditional cannoli. If you're a tea person, its like comparing Green Tea to Taro bubble slush.

The atmosphere is very laid back, tight, with a nice bar.  The food is dynamite.  Starting things off...\\n\\nDrinks - Spun Sangaree.  Totally unexpected flavors.  Billed as a Sangria like drink, it actually brings in lemon, nutmeg, orange, mezcal -- pretty indescribable.  Real smooth, pretty unSangria like actually, delicious, light, fresh.  I had the Red Hot, which was described as cinnamon hearts in a drink.  I don't know if I'd say quite the same, but totally unlike any drink I've had.  AMAZING.  Tequila, cumin, cinammon, tabasco.  I've never ordered two of the same cocktails in a night, but this was so delicious, spicy, sweet, perioral numbness-inducing, and not too strong on the tequila I got a second cocktail for the night.  Really, really tasty.  I would come back just for a round of that alone.  Tabasco sauce and cinnamon were made for each other.\\n\\nDinner was phenomenal, too.  You have to know that everything here is smaller plates, but for 2 people with very big appetites, 4 items + a dessert did us just fine ($100 + tip).  \\n1. Flatbread + Spreads - the three dips are edible on their own.  All so different in their flavors, most definitely not your grocery store hummous concoction.  The flatbreads were also pretty damn filling, so it's a real good choice (even to get 2 orders if you just want something to snack on and get full with drinks).  \\n2. Fregola Risotto - The risotto was good, probably a little dry, but had chunks of vegetables that made it pretty hearty.  I heard a bunch of tables talking about this, and I think it sounds a *little* better than it is.  With so many winners on the menu, this was still outstanding but just a bit overshadowed by everything else that was so good at Spoke.\\n3. ?Crudo.   I don't know exactly what this was called, had \\"lardo,\\" and a few other things I never really heard of.  Sensational though.  Its fishy and fresh, almost like a sashimi, but the flavors are totally succulent.  Garlicky mushrooms, olive oil, dill,  lemon... incredible.  It's a decent enough portion to get you started, and was one of the dishes that really highlighted the \\"foodie\\" nature of this place. Really well-constructed, thoughtful flavors paired into this.  \\n4. Duck Meatballs - Also incredible.  Five meatballs total, nothing huge, but the dijon-like sauce, nuts, grapes, and the moistness of the meatballs were not like anything I've ever tasted.  Again, totally different flavors paired together, and just really tasty.  \\n5. Semolina Cake - We had the semolina cake for dessert.  The cake itself is pretty understated -- spongy, moist, wet.  But the pairing of the ice cream and the bits of honeycomb toffee(?) garnish make total sense.  It's the sweetness of toffee with this almost custard-like, moist, sweet cottage cheese (think indian ras malai) mix.  \\n\\nFinally, service was also great.  Contrary to some other totally weird reviews about interruptions during business meetings, our waiter PJ was awesome, was totally appropriately attentive, made sense of restaurant-speak jargon.  Great restaurant, delicious, delicious food, and that drink, among everything else, I swear will bring me back again.  It's a warm, inviting place, great ambiance for a date or a fun dinner with friends.   \\n\\nThe pricing isn't bad.  I honestly though we'd be spending way more than we did but for the quality and uniqueness of the food, $80-100 before tip for 2 is much lower than most downtown Boston spots.

With that being said let's talk about Ray's.  \\n\\nOur dinner started off with us being seated in what felt like a private room off to the side for couples.  We both sat facing the river which was a really nice view.  Our waiter came over to tell us about the menus and specials and I wasn't sure at that point if he would be our waiter for the entire dinner or if the other person working in that area would be our waiter.  That part was both confusing and annoying.  We had already gotten a drink at the bar, but also ordered another round of drinks plus sparkling water.  Our waiter brought out the drinks & proceeded to pour our wine in previously our previously used wine glasses...really? There were clean glasses on the table, I stopped him and recommended that he use the clean glasses.  Our dirty glasses were never removed from the table mind you....so we just pushed them to the side.\\n\\nWe started out with appetizers, me salmon, my husband mussels.  Both were good, the salmon was huge - way too much for an appetizer.  We also ordered our main course while ordering the apps.  Our appetizers came out at different times.  By the time I got the salmon, my husband was finished with his mussels.  The salmon was good, again a very large portion, but VERY tasty.  Literally like 5 minutes into me eating the appetizer, our entrees came out & there was little space to put the entree.  So I moved it off to the side and asked for the salmon to be put in a box.  I had the crab cakes, very good, but also too large of a portion.  It's two crab cakes, mashed potatoes and asparagus with corn salsa on top, very tasty, but I was only able to eat one of the crab cakes.  My husband had the trout & had the same comment - tastes great, but way too much. \\n\\nIn the middle of eating our dinner, a waiter comes over with the salmon in a large bag & places the bag on the table.  We were MORE than annoyed by this, first of all it blocked our view of the water and second of all we were still eating, placing a bag in the middle of the table during dinner is so rude IMO.  [I feel this is training that all waiters should have]  We put the bag on the floor and continued our dinner.  By that time another waiter who wasn't the person who took our order came over to see how the food was.  \\n\\nTo finish off our meal and to finish off date night, we had their cheesecake special, raspberry swirl cheesecake which was excellent.

I love the atmosphere at this place. It has a homey feeling. Very welcoming vibe and the staff is really attentive. They have some high top tables and bar stools set up where you can watch all the magic happen in the kitchen and be mesmerized by the beautiful wood fire oven. There are also several tables in the dining area. \\n\\nI stopped by for dinner yesterday with my husband and father in law. We were offered to pick any table we wanted to sit immediately when we arrived and offered water and olives. They serve a mix of different kinds of olives with oil, rosemary, red peppers, and citrus peel. Delish! \\n\\nAfter drooling over the options on the soft opening menu we decided on two pizzas. The Summer Ninety Two ($15) (red pizza) which comes with red onion, olives, peppers, mushrooms, Italian sausage, and pecorino. The Five-Ohhhh ($14) (white pizza) which comes with mozzarella (fresh & aged), pickled jalapenos, prosciutto cotto, pineapple, and garlic sauce swirl. I cannot decide which one I loved the most. I really enjoy the slight char from the wood burning oven. The slices are thin and the crust is chewy and so addictive. The dough and sauce are both vegan. All of the toppings were so delicious and were the perfect combination of flavors. \\n\\nThey do not have beer & wine yet but this is in the works and will be offered soon. For the soft opening you can BYOB. We brought a bottle of wine to go with our pizza feast! My husband and I look forward to becoming regulars here.

But THEN, as we're leaving and walking back to our car the waitress frantically approaches my daughter and I and tries to accuse us of not paying. As she's literally swinging the receipt book in my face to show that it's empty, my mothers cash falls to the floor and I just had to walk away because of the embarrassment.

I also called them to confirm. But the day of the delivery, they end up delivering the pizzas almost an hour late because they had never intended on making them. \\n\\nThat's right. I had called five minutes after the delivery time of 11:45 am just to ask for their ETA and those mofos claimed to not have seen the order. Even though I confirmed with them earlier in the week. And on the phone, they claimed to not have it in the system at that moment but a couple of minutes later, it magically appears! They apologize profusely and at that point I'm just stumped because I had 9 kids to feed. We're lucky they were chill kids who didn't get all cranky and upset! Whew!\\n\\nThe manager told us she'd request a partial refund for us of $50 (but oddly enough it was after they told me that I'd have to pursue my own refund via Chownow...the online delivery system they use on their website). That part was a little confusing. I did go to the Chownow website and it doesn't even look like I can pursue a refund as a customer on there. \\n\\nAnyway...the potential $50 refund. That's probably how much it cost for our replacement sandwiches that my husband and our friend had to hustle to get so that would be nice to get back. It kind of sucks that this situation took two adults out of the party leaving really only me to watch all of the kids. \\n\\nOn the positive front, Blackbird did come through and hauled ass to get us our pizzas. It's hard to be fully mad at them because they really did try to be quick. And when we spoke they really were apologetic (although it wasn't helpful at the time). \\n\\nAt the same time though, I can't imagine if someone who was financially struggling was put in my position and they couldn't afford a backup meal. I was thinking about letting this go and chalking it up to an honest mistake but I just can't. I have to speak up so they can be accountable and make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.\\n\\nI'm going to keep an eye out on my refund but I don't really want to spend much time talking to anyone on the phone. I'm not desperate for $50. I'm grateful to actually have the funds for situations like this. \\n\\nBut I can't imagine the stress someone else will go through if they were struggling. It's nice to not have to worry about 50 bucks. And talking to someone in customer service isn't really a good use of my time. So I'm going to have good faith that the manager did put in a request for a partial refund.\\n\\nOut of principle, if I don't see a partial refund from Chownow (or is it Blackbird?) within a week, I'll probably pursue a partial chargeback via my bank, which for me will be quick and easy. So I'll give them a week.

The curry furikake played an especially large role in the curry chicken. I think it would have been pretty bland and boring without the extra curry flavor. The bonito and shoyu was grilled and delicious! The umami bomb had konbu in it, which I love. The spicy squid was a bit too oily (from the chili oil) for me. The squid was on the tougher side but the flavors were great. The most surprising one was the salted salmon. I expected bland and boring, but it was probably the best one. Simple and fantastic. Yum.

Atmosphere or no, Hapa offers up some damn good food. Besides, it's nothing a little wine can't help, right? Well, yes -- but it turns out the extra wine was *so* unnecessary. Aside from the amazing company I had that night, the service was top notch. Even though the staff were clearly slammed, our table was well-tended to, looked after, checked up on. And the food was Un. Real. \\n\\nA set menu for our table of 20 came out in well-spaced intervals, with a varied progression from light to heavy (for those of us who made it to the end of the 3 hour meal, the last few dishes helped aid our soon-to-be-sleepy-time), with a little bit for everyone. The clear winner of the night, however, was the sablefish. Buttery, smooth, with a crisp skin, and slathered in miso-sake gloriousness, this fish made me wish I could have had the entire plate to myself. Absolute perfection.\\n\\nI don't know that I'd recommend coming here on a date, or even in a smaller group, but this is the perfect spot for a big group of friends to chill out and get fat on delicious Japanese tapas.

We waited an additional 20 minutes to be seated, which didn't start things off too well, honestly.  After we were seated though, we were greeted by our amazing waitress.  She took our drink orders and ran off to get things started.  There was a little wait for the drinks, probably because it was so busy, so she returned and poured us both of glass of complementary champagne while we waited...excellent touch!\\n\\nThe drinks and food were great.  We had started with the tuna poke, which I've been told sells out on some nights.  This was followed by the ceviche and the clam garlic bread.  Honestly, if the meal had continued with dishes like these three, it may have been one of the best meals that I've had in Boston.  The tuna poke was the best dish of the night--a definite must try!  It is tuna tartar seasoned with sesame oil and super spicy jalapeno.  Amazing!  The other dishes we had were good, but just not quite as good as the start of the meal.  They included the matzo ball ramen (a little too salty for me), the silver queen corn (not nearly as good as Toro's corn), and the octopus a la plancha (nothing too special).  Desert was the chicory soft-serve, which was also fine, but if you're going to get ice cream, walk down the block after dinner to Toscanini's.  I'll echo what others have said about the food--most of it is delicious and amazing, but yes, the portions are small and the price is a little high.\\n\\nOverall, dinner was amazing.  The food was great, but that with the excellent service of our waitress is what really made the night.

The waiter though very kind took a very long time to take our order. He also didn't come back to see how we were doing or how we liked the food.

I was also kinda sad that the cheese curds weren't melted.  \\n\\nAlthough I wasn't the most satisfied customer, I came back to try something different: the Umami Bear, but this time I asked for the gravy on the side to prevent my fries from getting soggy.

The gravy kind of lacked flavor.\\n\\nSo, overall, I think this place hasn't been very consistent.  However, it's understandable because it's still really new.

The pizza was ice cold and nearly frozen in center.  The waitress walked by and asked was everything ok.  My husband asked her if she would stick her finger in the pizza and when she did she was apologetic and told us she would get a manager.  He said 'ooops' and offered to re-do pizza,,,by this time we were agitated and asked for the bill.  Needless to say he just walked off and waitress gave us our bill.

Instead, they give you a lousy $10 voucher per room (!) to use at a local restaurant (where breakfast costs $20 per person...). I complained about this to management after check-out, and I was told that when booking there is a banner on the website informing of this; apparently I missed it.\\n\\nThe swimming pool pictures they have on their site look stunning, but reality looks nothing like that. I wonder what angle they used, or whether photoshopped was heavily used, but that pool with the amazing Boston skyline pics behind is nowhere to be found. On top of that, when we showed up on Saturday evening at the pool there were 25+ kids running and splashing around the pool, with 2 (!) adults 'supervising'; by supervising, I mean eating outside food and looking at Youtube videos.

In my former lives, I've been a bartender, a restaurant manager, et al. So when I take the time to write a review, I take it very seriously. Keeping that in mind, I want the owners of Keegan's to give me a little credit. It's a Tuesday night. I've been at the bar drinking with friends (and eating by the way) and we are not ridiculously loud or obnoxious by any means. We are having a great time with our bartender, Jamie, who is so en pointe, it's ridiculous. There is literally 1 (one) person in the restaurant part of Keegan's and at least an additional 4 people at the bar who are not part of our group. We are having a great time. Fabulous beer selection. Great drink choices. We are a party of 7. And then, the buzzkill. The manager for the night named Brett (and although I know his last name, I will not demean him further) comes over and tells us that he has a complaint from his only patron in the restaurant. Keep that in mind. 1 diner vs. 10 at the bar. We have spent over $250 and he is calling us out. Needless to say, we all closed our tabs and the bartender, and more importantly, Keegan's lost a much bigger tab. Over 1 diner. 1 complaint. After we had been there since 6pm. So my question is this.... Does Keegan's want to be known as a great bar with great food?  Or is Keegan's a restaurant that wants to be an Irish pub on the side?  I'm just trying to decide where to spend my time and money. I don't think my question is unreasonable. But I will say this...if the manager from the night can't figure out how to balance both sides, then he needs to find a different career. \\n\\nUpdate 8/3/16\\nThe owner of Keegan's called me this morning to address my concerns after I hunted him down on Linked In.

We ended up getting two tables eventually. As we sat down and more people filtered in, we were left for fifteen minutes without getting menus, water or tea. Once we had those another ten minutes went by before we could put a drink order in. A few of us opted for cocktails and were told they didn't make them, even though we had their drink menus in our hands and could physically see the full bar across from us. Another waiter came over and said he could make our drinks, awesome. We ordered some apps and our entrees for fear we wouldn't get another chance for fifteen minutes. The food started coming out, and to be fair it was good. THIRTY MINUTES LATER, we still hadn't received or mixed drinks when a DIFFERENT waiter came and told us the servers didn't know how to mix drinks but we could order from the bar next door. I asked for a glass of wine they had at the other establishment and was told I couldn't have it because they only served the cocktails from over there. Which makes zero sense, because if you can get a cocktail from one bar, why aren't you allowed to get wine from there as well? Ridiculous, so I asked for a Sprite, which as you may have guessed took 10 minutes to get. Longer than the cocktails from next door. Cue to us being there for an hour and a half, and no one had brought our the entrees three of us ordered, lemon chicken, sweet and sour chicken and general gaus. My sweet and sour chicken NEVER CAME. I'm not kidding, they ignored all inquiries to its whereabouts and were rude when we asked to take it off the bill. Another girl, a vegetarian, asked if there was meat in some spring rolls we ordered and got an \\"I don't know, maybe\\" and then the back of the waitresses head as she ran away. After all of this, they added extra items to our bill that we didn't order, and everything was written in Chinese, luckily we had an exchange student in our class. After arguing with us about the food we didn't order, they said there was a two card limit at the table, which is illegal, by the way. So we had to argue AGAIN. Just to put three cards down.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to others for weddings. \\n\\nPros: Some reasons we chose this Hyatt: Very central, on Town Lake and because our wedding was in June and it is very hot outside so we opted for an indoor venue so our guests would be comfortable indoors, while keeping it within the downtown area. Stephanie B. (catering manager) was extremely helpful in helping us put our vision together for that night. We were able to chose every detail and have helpful input along the way.

I've had many, many traditional Chinese sour & spicy soups in my life; this was one of the best ... I loved the shrimp. 4.25 stars.\\n\\nSashimi salad: with some sort of vinaigrette, something like corn flakes for a bit of crunch, it was mostly pretty good, except I bit into a huge mass of ginger, which painfully spicy for me. Neither of us was brave enough to try the raw fish; however the flavour of everything other than ginger was pretty good. Can't give an accurate rating without trying the fish, but it looked and smelled fresh.\\n\\nSweet & Sour pork, served in pinapple: 5 stars. Crispy, lean, no inedible fat or tendon... Amazing. Beautiful presentation as well.\\n\\nRock cod: full of bones -- that's normal for this type of cuisine, but would've been forgiveable had the fish been fresh. It was slightly past due; not uncommon for fried fish at a Chinese restaurant. 2 stars\\n\\nDeep fried taro strands were a great appetizer.\\n\\nLobster: fresh, properly cooked. Could've used a larger portion & a hair more seasoning, 4 stars.\\n\\nTenderized black pepper beef sirloin w/ asparagus. Tender, lean (fat and tendon free) and delicious. Asparagus is buttery, but not wilty. 5 stars\\n\\nCrispy chicken: again, high quality poultry. Pretty moist, even the white meat. 4 stars.\\n\\nJapanese pumpkin curry seafood: not what I'd normally order,¬† but excellent prawns, scallops and fish - Miles better than the earlier rock cod. The pumpkin was delightfully sweet and creamy; the curry was nice but could've been more intesnse (more savoury to overcome the sweetness of the pumpkin). 4.25 stars.\\n\\nThe veggie greens weren't good... Property cooked, yes, but an overabundance of ginger left me with flashbacks of the salad. Pass. 2.75 stars.\\n\\nFinally the fried rice (which should've arrived earlier to make use of the pinapple sweet & sour pork sauce, the pumpkin curry, etc) was decent. Not too oily; clean tasting, but also kind of pointlessly served¬† after all the dishes that it should've¬† accompanied. 3 stars.\\n\\nFoie gras on red Chinese sausage: the foie gras was as smooth as it should be; however the Chinese sausage was inconsistent; wife's piece was quite good (4 stars), a little on the salty side for the red sausage, but the sausage on my piece was insanely salty (2.5 stars - the actual foie gras was good though). 3.25 stars average between the 2 pieces.\\n\\nThey ended with a unique pineapple bun (not actually pineapple, it's just called that because of the crust on top). Pretty good; the Mrs really enjoyed them.\\n\\nRecommended: The sweet & sour pinapple pork, taro strings, sour & spicy soup, black pepper beef, pumpkin curry, lobster.\\n\\nAvoid: fried fish, and ask for little, or no ginger in the veggies and sashimi salad.\\n\\nOverall: while traditional Cantonese cuisine isn't my preferred cuisine, this was pretty good; the best dishes would give Kirin a run for its money. 8.4 /10, 4 stars.\\n\\nPlease note this was the menu for a corporate event, so the restaurant may have been giving it their all.\\n\\nPhotos by Michelle W"},{"name":"Moa Box","address":"105-2973 Glen Drive","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"Had high expectations because of the good reviews.

I'm a Central Florida native while she is still learning the area, having been an East Tennessee girl until recently. We hadn't walked through their doors until this evening, but actually, we did attempt a few weeks ago on the early evening of a Sunday, but to our dismay, they had closed early. Not to be burned twice, we called to confirm this evening to make sure that they had on-duty staff, as to avoid a similar instance that we encountered the first time we realized that it seemed that they don't abide by the published hours of operation, something patrons have come to expect of businesses...with hours of operation posted.\\n\\nSo, we walk in and immediately all I can't stop thinking about is the first few minutes of Restaurant Impossible episode. It was dead, it was dirty, there were mismatched tables, chairs, dirty ceiling tiles, and then a Christmas tree in the corner right as you walk in. Oh, and then of course the menus were greasy to the touch. And just when I thought my jaw couldn't drop any more, I started reading the prices in menu - most of which contradict the surrounding aesthetics...it was textbook for Food Network ratings. And despite all of that, what concerned me the most was the printed disclaimer/caveat in the lobby referencing the Groupon, naturally the one we were using. It basically stated that they were going to automatically impose an 18% gratuity charge to the ticket, which of course was also stated at the point of our drink order after we mentioned that we would be utilizing the Groupon feature.\\n\\nWe still hadn't vocalized to each other our disappointments, but I could tell that my wife was bothered and vice versa. We remained optimistic that the entree would be good at best, since, after all, it was a $17 steak meal. In other restaurants, whether or not they claim to be a \\"steak house\\", if they advertise a steak that's $15 or higher, I expect something with an above average sear/char, one that's juicy, and that tastes delicious. I instead had to contend with a piece of meat that was without question 1/3 fat and gray in color. And when I select mashed potatoes, naturally it's expected to receive something smooth and creamy, without chunks and skin, and not served cold. And if seafood was instead the desired entree, again if its cost is above average, it's astounding to find out that it's nothing more/different than what you'd from the grocery store - frozen, bagged.\\n\\nI wouldn't be as vocal about this experience if I didn't feel like we didn't get ripped off, but the truth is that this isn't a good deal. You pay $20 for the Groupon (1 appetizer, 2 entrees from $16.99 or less) and then you're charged for the drinks (in our case this evening, just soda), and then the added 18% of the full total. Our second out of pocket total was just shy of $16, so we paid almost $40 for a meal that in my opinion was comparable to Denny's or Waffle House, which for two people would most likely never go above $25, and that's considering gratuity.\\n\\nI typically leave my below average dining experiences to just rants within the listening proximity of my voice, and they last for only a few minutes after the occurrence happens, but this is something I felt that needed to be shared."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"3118 Daniels Rd","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"3","text":"This location can't get an order correct.

We did not have appetizers, but we each got the caesar salad which was generous portion, seemed to have homemade croutons, and a nice caesar dressing.  For dinner I was really torn between the parmesan crusted scallops, and the shrimp.  Our server informed me I could get the scallops and add 3 shrimp for $9 more.  Problem solved.  The scallops were probably the best scallops I have ever eaten.  They were thick, flavorful, and smooth texture.  The parmesan crust would almost break with my fork it was so good.  The fried shrimp were jumbo, and the cocktail sauce had a really good kick to it.  It was served on a bed of lobster risotto which was outstanding. My partner got the large prime rib, and again, one of the best looking and tasting pieces of meat I have ever eaten.  It was thick, but cooked to perfection. And instead of having to order a side of mashed potatoes for two ala carte, the server brought him a small side on his plate.  They were delicious.  Also got a side of cheesy mac which was great as well.   We thought we were too full to order dessert, until they brought us a nice slice of chocolate cake on the house for our anniversary, with homemade whipped cream on top.  Perfect ending to a Perfect Meal.   \\nI have lived in Atlanta my whole life and never been to Ray's, but after this experience I will definitely be back.

Overall - not as good as McDonalds. \\n\\nWe were seated promptly. The server asked about the dining plan (Yes) and if any charges were to be split. Because we intended to order \\"extra\\" items not on the plan (cocktails, wine, and a salad) we explained the procedure- charges for extras to be split. The server asked if we were in the same room and somewhat irresponsibly I told the truth -\\"Yes, but the charges are to be split.\\"  The server said \\"If you are in the same room that makes it easy.\\"  I had premonitions, but I repeated that charges beyond the dining plan were to be split. The server repeated my words, but (spoiler alert) clearly did not assimilate their meaning. \\n\\nThe server appeared confused by the cocktail orders, perhaps because we did not respond in the order asked, but they came out fine. We ordered dinner and hot rolls and butter followed promptly. \\n\\nOne in the party asked that his steak be converted to a surf and turf by adding the lobster topping served with a different entree. The server offered to \\"Ask the chef.\\"  \\n\\nThe entrees arrived. The steaks were close enough to mid rare that their recipients rated the 5 stars except the one that showed without the requested topping who still gave it 4 stars. The recipient of the chicken said 5 stars but ate less than 1/3, so I figure 3 stars. The shrimp and grits were excellent-5 stars. The pork chop was edible. Tough and under seasoned, served with under seasoned broccolini and mushroom goat cheese  spoon bread that was tasty but so over salted it was not edible. 2 stars. \\n\\nLet's talk wine. The Schweigert Spring Hill Cabernet sells on the Internet for about $56 and is only $71 on the menu. The other dines were also values but not like the Schweigert. BV Tapestry is about $30 and $69 in the restaurant. We asked for the wine to be served with the entrees but had to ask the server and in order to eat hot food the meal was half-over before the wine arrived. \\n\\nAfter a pleasant, reasonably paced meal (85 minutes from being seated) we order dessert. All straight from the menu, prepared well in advance, but 30 minutes coming to the table. \\n\\nThe desserts are good. The bill arrives about 5 min later and as feared, it is not split. After explaining for the third time how to split the bill the server hints that it would be easier to leave it on one check. So, I repeat how to split the bill for a 4th time. The server sighs and leaves, coming back 15 minutes later (45 min since we ordered dessert) with a corrected bill and a story that a manager had to be summoned to correct the billing \\n\\nRight now, I'm thinking 4 star food and 0 star services averages to 2 stars\\n\\nBut, the server can't let it rest and tells me that if I had stated in advance how to split the bill it would have been faster. If I didn't have a small child, on best behavior through a 2 hr 35 min meal after a full day in the Disney theme parks, I would have asked to speak to a manager. \\n\\nI've eaten in many poor restaurants and generally write positive reviews. The only past exceptions had been overpriced and ostentatious establishments.

I had the Salt & Pepper shrimp, heads and all.  They were very tasty and had a small kick to them.  The \\"Pork Casserole\\" was a little different than what we expected.  It was essentially pork belly that had been roasted, served over greens.  The chinese curry was ok; nothing to write home about but it would really hit the spot on a cold rainy day.  The duck feet and sea cucumber was much better than I remember it being in the past.  Now, I can honestly say that I've never prepared sea cucumber.  The duck feet were basically the same, but the sea cucumber seemed much larger and, for lack of a better term, tender.

Chocolate chip cookies, carrot cake, mousse, pie - sure, you're speaking my language.  But cannolis?  Give me a break.  These 1,000 calorie cream filled 'snacks' make no sense to me.  Now this is not to say I haven't tried them because I have many times while entertaining friends and family in the North End.  But enough is enough.  \\n\\nI've been to Modern Pastry before a couple of times with family and wasn't impressed.  And tonight I returned for what would be my final cannoli experience.  I returned tonight not for myself, but in a selfless act - to pick up a cannoli 'package' for my co-workers birthday.  Now that I've made it clear that I don't care for the below average dessert, my comments will be based upon the service of the establishment, which just plain sucks.\\n\\nI decided to go here mostly because Mike's line is atrocious and I get anxiety just walking by it.  Modern's line in contrast looked reasonable tonight, I counted 10 people in front of me.  However, I was left dumbfounded and confused as to what took why it took 20 minutes in line to finally place my order of 4 cannolis.  Now I'm not just blaming it on the poor work ethic of the workers...don't get me wrong, they really do suck at their job.  It's a bunch of lazy high school/college students running the show.  The blame is mostly to be put on the establishment owner, who I haven't met, but can make the following assumptions.  He or she is too cheap to hire additional staff in a place that is unbelievably crowded everyday.  He or she thinks it's 'trendy,' 'unique,' and 'European' to have a long line waiting for these disgusting 'treats.'  And the sad part is, these tourists who are used to eating at Sbarro Pizza for their Italian nights out, think that waiting in line is cool, fun & well worth the wait.  I wish I could tell you it was, but it's really not.   So sure, come here if you want to wait in a long line for a shitty snack, but don't tell me I didn't tell you so.  Unlike some of my previous disclaimers where I would actually return to an establishment I gave a negative review to, I will never be going back to Modern Pastry. \\n\\nLastly, cash only?

Standing in the parking lot and contemplating our culinary fate, we first considered Mexican, but decided to give it a pass.  We were just getting back in the jeep when my hubby spotted what he thought was another restaurant.  It looked like a strip mall dive, but the overall Yelp score was encouraging, so in we went.\\n\\nThe owners are very friendly and the place is clean.  We were seated immediately, but the place was surprisingly full considering I'd never have guessed it was there from the street.  We decided to take a pass on the chicken in favor of more authentic sounding dishes.  I started with the Chicha Morada, which is a juice drink made from purple corn (it isn't thick at all -very juice consistency); however, the delicious flavor of the drink comes from the cinnamon and clove that it is made with.  I could drink a gallon of this stuff!  Hubby loved the golden kola; I thought it tasted like a sweeter version of cream soda, which was fine . . . it had nothing on my Chicha Morada though!\\n\\nHaving never eaten Peruvian, we decided to do a three-course meal.  To our surprise, a little roll came out with real butter before our appetizer.  It was your average bread roll.  Then, the empanada arrived, which was seasoned shredded chicken with raisins and olives in a pastry with a pineapple sauce drizzled on the plate that was creamy and seemed to have a slight spice to it.  Hubby and I both enjoyed it and I loved the unique combo of flavors.\\n\\nFor the main dish I ordered the pollo saltado  and hubby had the seco cordero.  The pollo was chicken with stewed tomatoes and onions and fries, which had a good savory flavor to it, but wasn't the same strong flavors as the empanada.  I was briefly disappointed until I realized that this is where the three sauces come in!  I applied a small bit of the red (spicy), green (mild, almost guacamole texture, but flavor was some sort of herb it tasted like), and yellow (a creamy, slight mustardy flavor) sauces.  I tried a bite with each, then started mixing them up until I came up with the perfect blend of spicy, herby, and just a dab of the creamy sauce.  I don't think my tongue knew what to do with itself.  When I took the leftovers to work the next day and heated them up, people were salivating heavily over the smell and trying to find the location of the source so they could discover where to procure some for themselves.\\n\\nThe seco was a lamb dish and I've found yet another place where I like lamb.  This was big chunks of well-seasoned lamb that needed none of the sauces at all and tasted a bit like it may have been cooked in a wine sauce?  I took a bite, then stole another small piece from hubby's plate later.  I may have to revise my opinion that I don't like lamb to I don't like most lamb (poorly cooked/seasoned lamb?  If I figure out what the difference is between gamey lamb I won't eat and good lamb, I will share).  The rice with both dishes was just plain white rice and the beans were nothing to write home about - just pinto beans in an ok sauce.  The yucca was interesting.  I think perhaps the seasoning on the dishes is good, but mild because they intend for people to play with the sauces?  Works for me!\\n\\nI was so enthusiastic about the drink, that for dessert, we shared a half arroz con leche(rice pudding) and half mazamorra morada (purple corn pudding with fruit).  Compared to the rice pudding my grandma made with lots of cinnamon & such, the rice pudding was a little bland, but the morada was again delicious with lots of yummy cinnamon & clove taste, so the two combined worked out well and we both loved it.  Hubby looked like he was contemplating licking the bowl.\\n\\nAh, Peruvian food - where have you been all my life!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It's frustrating that Mike's Pastry only accepts cash. \\n\\nI went on one occassion with my close friend who was visiting from out of town.

The blonde, short waitress complains at us that we were suppose to tell her our order and not go get it ourselves and gets really crabby. I tell her 'Fine, we'll order an expresso or something,' and she literally mumbles something and walks away. I understand that she probably is trying to earn some tips but how much can you possibly earn from 2 people eating a pastry and possibly a coffee? Also, she did not seem too attentive that day as she was also manning the Gelato station. This experience was definitely a disappointment. It's already difficult to place an order there and squeeze through the people to exit the restaurant, I certainly don't need an attitude from a waitress just because Mike's Pastry has already gotten my money and she can't earn a small tip.

Reasons why you should NOT eat here:\\n\\n- Terrible service. Our server had a bad attitude once she took our order of a few appetizers. We could tell she was upset that we didn't order more, and she spoke to us only once afterwards regarding the check. When we walked up to the host stand there was a very angry man complaining to a manager about the service he had received. \\n \\n- Disgusting and over priced food. We ordered a few of the brisket flat breads and queso appetizers. The flat bread looked barely thrown together and under cooked. The queso was a very small portion for $8.95 and tasted like Velveeta and Rotel (something we could've thrown together for about half the price)\\n\\n- Unpleasant atmosphere. The weather was amazing at the time, however there were multiple fans at unnecessarily high speeds blowing mist everywhere which would have been great if it was significantly hotter outside. Also, there were small orange bugs that kept biting us and got all over and inside our drinks which we assumed was because of the amount of moisture in the air from the misting fans. Obviously, there isn't much you can do about bugs on an outside dining area, but I feel as if there are precautionary measures that could be taken to avoid bugs getting into our drinks and presumably also our food. \\n\\nThe only positive aspect of this restaurant was the spectacular view.

I'm pretty sure that I saw one or two of their very distinct to-go boxes on Saturday afternoon, but I didn't really pay any attention to it at the time because I had a lot more on my mind that day. On Sunday, after the game, we had several hours to kill so we started wandering around the city. Again, I started to see those boxes. This time I took note and had to point it out to my friends: \\"What the HELL are those boxes all about?\\"\\n\\nNo one had any idea, so we let it be. We went about our day until we decided to go to Neptune for dinner. We went there early to put our name in since we heard that the waits were notoriously long. The closer we got to Neptune, the more and more of the boxes we saw. We put our name in and walked around the area... more and more box sighting. We assumed we had to be right near the place. The boxes were like some sort of pastry SONAR -- each box sighting was like a blip on the screen and they were becoming more and more frequent. Eventually we turned a corner and bam. Hey, what's up Mike's Pastry? I'm not sure if Boston is just a lot smaller than Chicago, but what are the odds that we'd just walk right by it during the 1.5 days we were there?\\n\\nThe huge line didn't surprise us considering how many customers we had seen throughout the city so far. Luckily we had a ton of time to kill, so we jumped in it. We weren't hungry, but we felt like we had to try this place. The line moved surprisingly fast, but once you get inside, things are kind of crazy. The line breaks down and it's more of a mob. You are just supposed to make your way to the counter any way you can. Now, this is a great plan if you are a huge, pushy jerk, but it's less than ideal if you are a patient, quiet person. We were only in there for 10 minutes, but I saw someone get very angry at a counter girl because of the situation. Anyways, it looked like the place had three big sellers: canoli, cookies and gelato, so that's what we got. Chocolate chip, chocolate chip and raspberry, respectively. \\n\\nWe went and ate it all in that new Big Dig park. I'm going to be honest here: I've never had a canoli before, so I'm not really able compare Mike's to any other. It was good, but I didn't love it. It's entirely possible that I just don't like canolis all that much. The cookie was good. It was a weird combination of soft and dry at the same time. I've never really had anything like that before. The gelato was also alright. None of it was anything to write home about, in my opinion. Maybe we missed something? We've got places that are hyped for seemingly no reason in Chicago, too. No one knows why they're so hyped, but for some mysterious reason, they are. The experience was fun though.\\n\\nOh, and on the plane ride home to Chi that night, the grossly cute couple next to me had a Mike's box on their lap.

Some of the seating area is covered and some isn't.\\n\\n3.. It is located in one of my favorite neighborhoods in all of Portland: Mississippi District.

The food here doesn't disappoint... Chips and Salsa comes with 2 types of salsa which are both fantastic (i preferred the red salsa, but the green was also great). The Bob Armstrong queso was also super great. For dinner, we split the Parilla Mixta - a 3 meat fajita plate with beef, chicken, and pork. The pork was a delicious, fatty cut that tasted similar to a pork belly. and the tortillas that came with the Parilla were off the chart. \\n\\nService: 3/5\\nOur server was very friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu. He had an opinion on what to order, which I took, and was glad I did. However, the service seemed a little slow (not his fault... it was pretty slammed on a monday night... probably just not enough people on staff). When we asked for extra tortillas for the fajitas, we waited 30 minutes and they never arrived, so we just went without. Probably a symptom of the aforementioned super-busy factor. \\n\\nDrinks: 2/5\\nI really wanted to like the drinks. The cocktail menu here has all the makings for greatness: Oaxaca style old fashioneds (read: old fashioned with mezcal), fresh ingredients, infusions, and a flavorful horchata. BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS because the drinks weren't cold. I'd expect that at a lower-end mexican joint, but not at a Ford Fry restaurant. \\n\\nThere's a few quick fixes that they should consider. The first thing I noticed is that the drinks that were served on the rocks didn't have that much ice in them (like the extra fresca). The highwayman was most likely not stirred long enough to make it properly cold. I'm guessing that they either aren't using enough ice when making the drinks, or for the shaken drinks, they aren't shaking them long enough. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back because the food was KILLER... but in the meantime, i hope they work out some kinks behind the bar and put some more folks on the payroll."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Yum yum yum yum.

Despite the fact that I typically do not indulge myself, I adore the idea of an over sized slice of cheesecake coupled with a steaming hot beverage prepared with luscious ingredients; essence of almond, hazelnut syrup, cocoa powder, and caramelized sugar. Delightful. \\n\\nPerhaps with the hustle and bustle of the Atlanta airport, you're looking for a soothing beverage to relax before your departure. The extensive tea selection includes items such as Indian spiced Chai, Green Yerba Mate, and Green Roobios, which is described to be sweet, light, fruity and have herbaceous notes, vitamins and minerals.

The insides should be hot, steamy, melted deliciousness. Instead, I was disappointed to receive two thin slices of bread soaked in butter filled with chicken, veggies and cheese - warm on the outside edges, cold in the middle. Actually, the first time the sandwich was served, it was sitting on a plate that had mustard-like swirls drawn on the plate. Nowhere on the menu did it specify that mustard was part of the presentation, and with my strong dislike of this condiment I sent the panini back before inspecting it further. It was the second serving I received which I discovered the cold center. \\n\\nBy this point, I was ready to just pay the bill and eat the fries, for fear of sending yet another plate back. After apologizing profusely to the waiter and insisting that I *really* was not trying to be obnoxious, I asked him to bring out a burger. I figured they can't really mess that up. \\n\\nAnd while the burger was fine (and hopefully not spit on), my love affair with the idea of this place had ended as quickly as it had begun.

We were here for our one-year anniversary, and she dealt with our mushy goofiness very well. She was attentive at just the right times. Thanks, Tara!\\n\\nFood:\\nWe had the beer cheese soup, a bottle of Cabernet, the fillet, and a rib-eye. It was all very good. The standout was the fillet which was superb (and the incredible pretzel rolls). The letdown was my rib-eye which was tasty as could be, but though it was cooked perfectly medium-rare, was a bit tough (especially for the price). We added a couple of cappuccinos and paid almost $200 out the door. We felt like we paid a little too much, but we weren't surprised.\\n\\nBathrooms:\\nThey were great!

Both of them are great just as toast with butter; I like the unique flavor of the Honeycomb Graham, and there is SOMETHING about the Italian bread that is just AMAZING. I don't know what it is, but I love that bread.\\n\\nOther than that, I'd recommend basically anything. Great cupcakes (though sometimes their non-standard flavors are so-so), great doughnuts, great pastry.

They have packaged cookies as well, and I haven't tried all of them, but their pizelles are wonderful.\\n\\nDownside: NO croissants! I know, I know, it's an Italian bakery.

However, as I have said we kept going back. We have since tried every part of this diverse menu. I had the shrimp and grits and let me say, I am from the South and these were no lie the best damn grits I have ever had! So creamy and with the perfect consistency. The shrimp was also perfectly cooked. I thought, \\"Okay, I have found their niche.\\" So the next time I went, I tried to be adventurous and branch out. I got their sushi. I cannot remember the name, but it has shrimp tempura and bbq eel sauce. So good. You'd think it was a sushi restaurant. At this point, I would not write a review on this place, since I have not experienced their steaks. I got the ribeye. Cooked to perfection. I hate having to send food back, and here when you say med. rare, it comes back warm and pink on the inside. Their cocktails are a bit over-priced and I would have given them 4 stars due to pricey-ness, but I figure I needed to counter some of the moronic review people left of this place.

When it was just myself and my fiance, the whole crew was very friendly. Again, no complaints on service. My only qualm is that it is a bit pricey, but that is to be expected in Midtown Atlanta.

I also ordered a side (double side) of bacon.  When I read that the restaurant smokes their own Lox, Bacon and Corned beef...we just had to add it.  Glad we did.  The bacon is uniquely flavored and absolutely decadently perfect.  Next time, I will try the BLT...\\n\\nThe Reuben came on a marbled rye and the bread was fantastic.

The facilities here also include a very nice bar area and restaurant that serves a good breakfast buffet, a clean gym, and a nice pool area. \\n\\nLots of positives to the Renaissance, unfortunately, despite all this, there were several problems I encountered during our stay. First the AC and temperature control for the room didn't work at all. We were fine for one night, but if it was hotter, it would have been a major problem. Second the walls are paper thin. I could hear both my neighbors and their TVs. Third the hot water in the shower didn't get that hot. I would say it was luke warm at best. Fourth, the bed was very stiff.

Their menu, while incredibly eclectic and causes some serious FOMO (fear of missing out on not ordering really interesting looking things on the menu), just didn't wow me. And while we were given outstanding service by our waitress, I left feeling unsatisfied and unhappy with the food - in both the taste and discrepancy of high prices and low value. \\n\\nThe SO and I went on a Sunday night with a 7pm reso. The restaurant was pretty packed but the hostess seated us after a few minutes of waiting. We immediately noticed that while the restaurant space is pretty sizable, the tables are jammed in really close together. We were seated so closely to the people on either side of us that it became too easy too listen to their conversations and too difficult to tune them out. So much for trying to establish an intimate setting! \\n\\nWe ordered the:\\nChicken Wings (3/5)\\nCharred Avocado (2/5)\\nManti (2/5)\\nBBQ Scallops (4/5)\\nMatzo Ball Ramen (1.5/5)\\n\\nChicken Wings - there's a kick to these and while we really liked the rub/flavor, there wasn't enough sauce to cover the wings. The meat itself was really dry. \\n\\nCharred Avocado - after having this, I can say with confidence that avocados are best eaten uncooked. The only thing noteworthy about this was the pomegranate molasses topping which after being charred, turned into a very crispy and caramelized coating (think of creme brulee). The cooked avocado itself wasn't really much to write home about - it just tastes like how you would imagine a warmed avocado would taste like. This dish was also a little too overpriced for my liking - you get 1/2 for $5.  That's $10 / whole avocado! \\n\\nManti - these are dumplings with some mixture of ground meat including lamb. Wish they would list out the meat they use for these dumplings as lamb can be pretty divisive and I'm not a fan of lamb. Pretty lackluster, I've had much more flavorful dumplings at other joints. They are topped with a garlic sour cream that didn't really seem to add much to the overall flavor profile. \\n\\nBBQ Scallops - the best dish of the night. The scallops aren't cooked with the the traditional American bbq sauce you think of - it was more spicy and Asian inspired. I really wish the portion size was bigger - we got 2 scallops and the dish was $12. $6 / scallop. \\n\\nMatzo Ball Ramen - the biggest let down of the night. This is supposed to be a twist on Japanese ramen and Matzo ball soup. The broth is super rich (in the sense that it's really thick and fatty and leaves you with a gross feeling like you just ate a stick of butter straight-up) but it was lacking some serious flavor. The matzo balls were also incredibly mealy and had a weird lumpy texture - not like other matzo balls I've had. We ordered this with the intent of keeping an open mind, knowing that it wouldn't taste like the traditional ramen we love. And while the dish had hints of traditional ramen and matzo ball soup, it didn't really taste better than either of the originals. It's like they combined a vibrant blue and a orange and the end result came out brown. The flavors of the two original concepts just got muddled together leaving behind an indistinct and unsatisfying tasting experience. Hence why I say the dishes we tried (especially this one) are still in the R&D phase. It felt like they just threw this ramen/matzo ball concept together to be edgy and only tried doing it once before putting it on the menu for people to pay money for - but really they need to keep fine tuning, developing the flavor profile to make it worth the while for people to experience. DO NOT GET THIS DISH - NO MATTER HOW INTRIGUING IT LOOKS AND SOUNDS - YOU'LL BE LET DOWN.\\n\\nBut to end on a more optimistic note - the menu at Little Donkey is pretty vast, some dishes are likely to be better than others. You might just have to order bunch to find the ones you like (in our case, the BBQ scallops)."},{"name":"Golden Chick","address":"7101 State Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What's not to love!

He told me that he had read my Yelp reviews and noticed that I had a slight addiction to margaritas (thank you for noticing). But, I was in a wine mood, and he promptly brought a bottle of full-bodied red wine for me and the boyfriend to share (Gnarly Head Zin, if anyone cares). \\n\\nHe had arranged the entire meal. First, the 1800 roll and the shrimp tempura. Delicious. I favored the 1800 for its delicate spice, while the BF liked the tempura because of its crunchiness.  Also, the tempura had giant chunks of shrimp inside it - exactly what a sushi roll should contain. \\n\\nNext, the oriental salad. Napa cabbage, almonds, ramen (that's right, toasted ramen), and green onion, covered with a sweet soy dressing. Good, but not the main course.\\n\\nThen lemon-grass crusted halibut, served in a coconut curry sauce with spinach and sweet rice. The halibut was a little tougher than I normally cook fish, but someone told me that's just how it is. Not sure if that's true, but it was definitely enjoyable.  Also pork ribs with French fries. The meat was incredibly tender and covered with a faintly sweet sauce. Very good. The French fries were crisp and golden, a welcome addition to the plate.\\n\\nFor dessert, a red velvet cupcake that I devoured. Usually, I avoid cupcakes because there is too much icing. Not this time. Just enough cream cheese icing coated the top. \\n\\nAll this for just under $100. So take off the wine, and the total is around $70. The ribs were $22 and the halibut was $15. That's still quite expensive for a Tuesday dinner. Of course, all I would ordinarily want is the two sushi rolls, and that was somewhere around $20. \\n\\nKona Grill might not be absurdly expensive, but I would go there with the intention of spending some money.

We loved the funky music (my husband came home and created a steampunk Spotify list) and the styling of the space. They've carried the theme into the waitstaff's uniforms, and the \\"owners\\" were even touring the dining room, talking with guests.\\n\\nFinally it was time for what we came for: the milkshakes. Oooooh, the milkshakes. Some of our table split a Peanut Indulgence shake, and my husband and I got the key lime pie, which, of course, came with a slice of pie on top of the whole thing. They were really good. So good. There is a window downstairs near the host stand where one can watch the shakes being made, and it is mesmerizing. I totally didn't almost get left behind by my family because I was so fascinated by watching them build these sugary delights. Nope. (Also: if/when I return, I want the Marshmallow Crisp milkshake. There's a whole Rice Krispie treat on it!)\\n\\nSo, the rundown: entrees would be 3 stars, but the desserts and service bump this place to 4.\\n\\nP.S. You can also get the milkshakes to go so, if you don't have time for dinner, stop by and grab one for the walk to your car after a day at the parks.

It is has tables for big groups and it is large enough to withstand the weekend brunch rush. If you come a little early or a little late, you can usually find a table. The atmosphere and decor are actually quite nice. It is clean and has lots of nice ornaments. \\n\\nFor Dim Sum they have carts with all of the basics as well as a specials buffet bar. Service can be a little curt. The food is usually OK, but can be a bit inconsistent. As I write the review, I'm feeling positive because it was actually the best visit of my many many trips to China Pearl for Dim Sum. This time everything was quite tasty except for the turnip cake which was a bit subpar. Not very flavorful and not crispy enough. \\n\\nPerhaps not the best Dim Sum in Boston, but China Pearl is a good option for large groups and a good second choice if other places are packed. ."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Unbelievable creative menu.

I started with the beer cheese soup since the server said it was the most popular dish appetizer. My husband got the mussels.  The soup was very rich and I can taste the beer, which I typically never do at other restaurants.  The soup was very flavorful and tasty.  The mussels were simply amazing. It was full of flavor and the bread that it came with was soo good even on it's own.  For the mains, we both got the filet with truffle risotto. The steaks were perfectly cooked and pairing it with the rich fungi aroma of the risotto made it the most tasty bite of food that I've had in Disney World. I was stuffed, but I had to finish it, so I sat there eating slowly until I can finish the last bite. It was wonderful, and I would definitely go back to Le Cellier just for the filet!  For dessert, my husband got the panna cotta, which was served table side. Beautifully crafted dessert and tastes luxurious.  The service wasn't the best I've had in Disney World, but it was still good. The ambience was okay, and for people complaining that it was loud, it's Disney World.

The proper way to gauge any contest like this is on the basics - plain cannoli with chocolate chips (just as a pizza contest would be based on a plain cheese pizza, or a bagel contest would be based on a plain bagel with plain cream cheese).  The fact that modern fills and dips the cannoli to order means the shell is never soggy and the filling is fresh.\\n\\nAlso, Modern has a much more organized flow, with a single queue being served in-order.  This can be a double-edged sword, though.  On a normal day, I have no problem fighting my way to the counter in Mike's to get served quickly.  That just isn't possible at Modern.

I'm told the place is known for cocktails and I'm not really a cocktail person so that might be part of it, so maybe consider it if that's what you're after. Frankly, the service was average at best, the music was awful and loud, creating a strange vibe compared with the otherwise pleasant hipster decor. A restaurant lacking identity. Ultimately the food is the reason for the rating. It's a touristy area, and I'm sure the rent is high but the food was very sloppily put together, with poor seasoning and not at all what I would expect for the price point in a foodie area like Gastown. To say the food was mediocre would be a kindness. It was sushi specifically at this time (July 2016) and there are LOTS of other places you can get much better sushi within blocks of this place at a much better price.

We opted for the chocolate dipped ricotta and espresso. The cannoli were too rich and sweet, though I only took a few bites each. The fried crispy shell just had no appeal for me.

Disappointed, yes. But defeated, no. Avoid this place. My family's experience at Toothsome was so bad, we ended up refusing a comped meal to avoid spending another minute at this purgatory inspired restaurant. \\n\\nWhen my sister and I showed up to put our names in, we had to wait in line to see the host stand for about ten minutes. They gave us an estimated wait time of an hour and ten minutes. No big deal, we knew we were at a tourist trap on a Saturday. We try to keep ourselves occupied at the bar, but it was severely understaffed. Our bartender was nice, but you can't have three bartenders staffing a giant restaurant. An hour and ten minutes later, we still haven't received an update. 15 minutes after our estimated time, I waited in line to see the host again. He informed me that it would be another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later, we get a text that our table is ready. We wait in line again to tell them our table is ready. We're then told to wait in line again after this to be seated. That's four separate times being told to wait in line for those of you counting at home. That's ridiculous. \\n\\nMy dad went to the manager to see what was going on, as it was now two hours since we put our name in. He was apologetic and offered us two free appetizers. We were seated, but everything was a struggle from there on out. We knew what we wanted the second we sat down, but it still took over an hour to get our food. It was immoderately average for those who got flatbreads and sandwiches. My mac and cheese was straight up gross, chewy and cold. We ordered the milkshakes, their speciality, as soon as our food came. It was a miserable process. After four hours, we complained to the manager so we could get our check and go home. He offered to comp our food, but our waiter had run the check already. They also forgot those free appetizers. We refused the free meal because of how badly we wanted to get out of this restaurant. \\n\\nAfter all that, the shakes were disgusting. They tasted like straight foam. It reminded me of eating a dessert flavored body wash. This four hour meal experience was horrible, and completely ruined our last night.

Sprinkle on some salt and pepper and you're good to go. The matzo ball is large, light, and fluffy. Perfect and simply delicious.\\n\\nThe Boy's favorite sandwich is the New Yorker - 12 oz of hot pastrami and corned beef, swiss, and russian dressing on cissel served with half sour, sour pickles, and sour tomato (essentially the mixed pickle plate). The behemoth is truly a spectacle ... and also an amazing hangover cure. I really enjoy the Jack & Marions myself (Hot Corned Beef, Beef Tongue, Pastrami, and Mustard) and if you're not in the mood for deli meat, Zaftigs boasts a damn good Falafel Wrap as well.\\n\\nAs for sides and fixings, the fries, potato salad, and cole slaw are all premo stuff guys. Ask for extra mustard and they'll sidle you with your own squeezy bottle and you'll be thankful. Put that shit on everything. It's amazing. We always ask for a cup of it to go. The only disappointing thing I've had here are the pickles. The half sours aren't salty enough, quite bland - I season mine with salt and pepper to give it some flavor. The sour/spicy pickle is entirely TOO salty. If they mixed the brine for the half sour and the sour, they might have the perfect balance for pickles.\\n\\nPickles aside, service there can be iffy as well depending on when you go. Breakfast service is great, my coffee was never empty, you will always get checked in on, and not a beat is missed.

I got a greek salad with tuna, and it was ok, nothing special,but it was fresh, so I'm happy. As far as other stuff, i didn't like their fries, they were made from tasteless frozen potatoes, nothing shocking, but now i know not to get fries there. And I won't be getting pizza from them anymore, again, nothing outrageous, I just don't like the way they make it. I got a margarita, but I didn't like their version because the crust was way too thick for me, they used both fresh & reg mozzarella and too much garlic. \\n\\nHOWEVER the smoothies & the fz yogurt are great!!! You can tell them exactly what you want in the smoothie or the frozen yogurt and they will blend it for you.

I have been wanting to try the burgers at Amnesia since they opened for this very reason, and I don't know why I've been procrastinating.  The four stars is really for everything else: the beer, the set up, the service, the location.  The burger was just very plain, even when I managed to overpower it with the hot mustard.  And for some reason, its charbroiled taste just didn't come through.  It looked like it was going to be really really good, but it just didn't live up.  Especially not for $10.  A much better burger will be found at the Slow Bar for that money.  The guy at the que was very proud of what he was doing, and that made me hopeful.  I don't think it was his fault; the burger itself was to blame.  Absolutely no seasoning in that thing.  Like I said, overall, this place gets 4 stars for all of it's other cool attributes, and would be a definite 5 if I had been duly impressed by the burgers.  Maybe the sausage will be  different.

French food is normally something that I'd choose for an event (birthday, anniversary), but what if you're just craving the awesome richness of a cassoulet or pleasure of a charcuterie plate and it's a random non-event night of the week?  Honestly, if you want a less buttoned-up experience, this is a great choice. It's situated in previous owner La Regelade's space, so it's a smaller space replete with glass deli counters. We went for dinner before a movie (!) and chose the fantastic mussels in a garlic/white wine/cream sauce - some of the biggest that I've ever eaten, which could have been a meal in itself. My husband had the 12 hour slow cooked lamb with frites and I had the shortrib - an eternal favourite - in an amazing sauce. Both were fork-tender and scrumptious. By the time the chocolate mousse cake came around, we could barely put another bite into our mouths, and went home with leftovers. The owner and wait staff were attentive, friendly and conversational. My water glass never went empty. We will definitely go back. As it was just given a liquor licence a few weeks prior, I know that there are dinner-time kinks to work out.

There are so many options and they put large blow-up pictures of the options on the wall so you can choose while you wait in line. My friend and I each got one: one Oreo and one Amaretto cannoli. They're very unique and the cream inside is very rich. There are also a ton of options for other baked goods such as cookies, macaroons, and biscottis.\\n\\nSince Mike's Pastry is so famous, the place is always crowded. It's a little hectic, but it's mostly organized chaos. Lines are usually out the door, but there are many employees who are assisting customers and you can tell where everyone is on line. You probably won't find any space to sit inside, but there are a couple parks nearby with plenty of seating to enjoy your food in the outdoors.\\n\\nOverall, the cannolis are pretty good and if you're in Boston, you have to come to Mike's Pastry."},{"name":"Kick Butt Coffee","address":"5775 Airport Blvd, Ste 725","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Breakfast tacos, legit coffee, AC in this blistering Texas sun, ninja movies playing in the background, donuts, live music, AND booze!!!!

They move fast. There are tons of cannoli flavors, from Key Lime to Oreo to your standard ricotta. I'm a bit of a purist so I went with the plain ricotta filling (chocolate dipped because I do like my chocolate!) where my husband went with the limoncello. We took our neatly tied boxes and went nearby to the park to enjoy them (no seating in Mike's) and they were great! The cannolis are huge but not overly sweet. At least the traditional ricotta isn't. Which I loved. The crunchy shell was prepared perfectly and the chocolate dipped shell on the sides added just the right about of bittersweet that I loved. Incredibly tasty. I had a bite of my husband's and his was also great, it was a bit sweeter but it also had the nice little zip of lemon that was excellent.\\n\\nBut I was also happy to learn that they were just as good as the amazing cannoli from the Italian bakery that I love back home.

Our four (or maybe five) course dinner began with mini bites of cornbread with butter, fried green tomatoes (topped with a hearty serving of Jumbo Lump crab salad) and Crispy Wild Boar Ribs. I can't attest to its awesomeness because I don't eat piggies because they're so darn cute, but I will say that my table was left highly impressed. I'm a huge brisket brat, and Lamberts offered a fine slab of juicy meat. And here's where all the magic happens: the jumbo mac 'n' cheese. This is a must. A MUST. \\n\\nFor dessert, if you're a sweet and spicy fan, don't miss out on the chili chocolate pudding. It has a crazy kick to it. And their cocktail menu has some of the best drinks my pretty little lips have ever sipped on. They make a great tinto (with Diet Coke upon request) and some other cucumber-infused cocktail that's sure to wet your whistle in this Texas heat. \\n\\nLamberts, if you were a dude and single, I'd be all over your sweet, sweet ass.

It offers great views over the lake.  My room was impeccably clean, and as far as comfort goes I could not have asked for a more restful night's sleep.  I also appreciated nice customer service touches, like being addressed by name when I call the front desk.  But beyond that, I had a frustrating interaction with a tow truck service  one night(long story and another review).  This had nothing to do with the Hyatt, but the concierge saw my frustration and offered some kind words and a free drink at the bar while I waited.  The hotel's willingness to go above and beyond even when they were in no way responsible for my frustration really says a lot about the establishment they run.\\n\\nThe only reason I couldn't give a solid 5 star rating was the location (It's ALMOST close enough to walk to the fun stuff downtown, but having to cross the bridge is a pain).  Also, there were times throughout the day where no dining options were available (for example, from 3-5pm on a weekday).  I felt a little trapped because I didn't want to order room service.  At a place like the Hyatt I expect a couple of dining options at all time. The last thing I will say is very subjective and so I didn't factor it into my rating: This place can be NOISY.  Since the hotel has an open center lobby, you can easily hear late night bar noise from your hotel room. If peace and quiet are necessary to you I probably would caution you away from this hotel.  However, if you're looking to socialize and meet a few people, the lively night-time bar crowd at this hotel is impressive. Different strokes for different folks.\\n\\nLong story short? You should stay here whenever you are given the option.

It's a funky little place with exposed rafters and naked Edison bulbs and Christmas lights for ambience. I guess we got lucky or were smart to go mid-week as there was no wait for a little table in the corner. Bruno has the feel of a popular local joint, with plenty of beards, tattoos and cans of PBR in evidence -- all good as far we were concerned.\\n\\nFirst on the table was a bowl of olives and small hot red peppers. We weren't sure what do with those, but they made more sense as garnish with the bowl of amazing, over-the-top garlic knots others have noted. I don't even like garlic knots normally, but these were outstanding -- warm and suprisingly fluffy, covered in garlic and oregano,  served with a bowl of perfect red sauce. These are transcendent garlic knots and no one should skip them.\\n\\nWe split a \\"half\\" house salad, which was plenty for two people. It was simple greens and tomatoes and more olives, but fresh and hearty.\\n\\nOur two pizzas came quickly. I got the simple 'Roni, a pepperoni, pecorino and garlic pizza, which came with Bruno's signature crisp wood-fired crust, and was pleasingly asymmetrical.My wife ordered a Ninety-Two, with Italian sausage, red onion,  mushrooms and Pecorino. It was arguably the better of the two, but I love pepperoni pizza and might order a 'Roni next time anyway. The wood-fired crust was a highlight for both 'zas, and both were surprisingly light. One would not be enough for two average people in my opinion.\\n\\nBeer is a specialty at Pizza Bruno, but they only have one rotating draft, the rest being cans or bottles. Still, I enjoyed the one I picked. Soda is only available in plastic bottles. We finished up with the lemon and Nutella cannoli, which were decent (and creative) and clearly made with pride, but not outstanding -- maybe you don't mess with cannoli.\\n\\nPricing was a little burly for pizza -- I think we spent $75 with salad, drinks and dessert, but the food was solid. We'll be back, maybe on another weeknight with no wait. I may be thinking about those garlic knots regularly until we make it back."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I like to come at this place.

It isn't too too pricey for the games itself but when you are drinking & eating it quickly adds up. Pro tip: the earlier you go the cheaper the game is! You also don't have to pay per person so the more friends you bring the cheaper it will be. The price is per bay which is really cool. Personally, I'd rather have it only a few people since it takes longer with turns with a lot of people but thats just me. It usually takes a while for your bay to be ready so just be ready to wait a bit before starting your game. \\n\\nThe game itself glitches I have noticed on occasion which is frustrating at time, this is why i rated it 4/5 stars.

He did not ask me to write this review.\\n\\nI know everyone here has a problem with Sifu's self-promotion tactics.  I know he has not garnered the best reaction from the Yelp crowd.  I still think that Yelp has an overly negative view of the guy for doing what any decent small business owner does - shameless self-promotion - if maybe with not as much subtlety as he should've.\\n\\nYes, there are probably a few too many signs advertising Sifu's Kung Fu and Tai Chi schools, but there aren't *that* many.  One in the bathroom, on by the front door, and some flyers by the register.  OH NOES!  TWO POSTERS! SHAME! *rolls eyes*\\n\\nBut on to the coffee shop.  Um.  WOW.  The coffee is GREAT.  I'm a coffee snob.  A frequenter of Mojo's and now Epoch.  A man who is in love with Blue Bottle Coffee in San Francisco (oh GODS was that yummy).  And the coffee at Kick Butt Coffee is freaking GOOD.  Some talking with Dave, the manager, revealed that their nifty espresso machine is the fanciest one in Austin.  I have no idea what that means, but it sounded impressive.  We did discuss how we both felt that Starbuck's over-roasted their beans to cover bad flavor, and Dave told me that he went through literally hundreds of beans to choose what he served.\\n\\nAn friend of mine from Houston who visits me regularly swung by the last time I made it up to KBC, and he like the environment and coffee vastly better than he likes Epoch or Spiderhouse.  You may discount this because he's from Houston, but you should re-evaluate that because he is a jazz musician of considerable talent.\\n\\nThis place is simply the cleanest coffee shop in Austin.  Not kidding.  I would eat off the floor, and if you'll buy the food, I'll prove it.  I loved the grungy, dive-bar feel of Mojo's, and I like the new-age feel of Epoch, but there is definitely a place in the Austin coffee scene for a place that's clean and not Starbuck's.  The service was good in my experience, but I do fall in the category of I-know-these-people-so-they-hook-me-up, so you should probably not base your opinion of the service on me.  \\n\\nI caught the indie music night, and they actually had some pretty talented acts.

It was less spicy which is not how it is cooked or served in North India. Despite this, it was tasty and the freshness deserves high marks. I give this an 8/10.\\n\\nChicken Biryani - Biryani is Biryani, and this wasn't one (see my comment on Biryani's below), however, it was still tasty and I could tell it was fresh so I will give it a 5/10.\\n\\nLamb Biryani - Where is the lamb? I probably saw a few small chunks; it still gets a 5/10 for freshness.\\n\\nFreshness - Most Indian restaurants will pre-cook and store, sometimes it may stay in storage for longer.\\n   - I must confess that the Biryani hadn't been in storage for long, maybe only for 8 hours or so.\\n          - The place is busy and small so pre-cooked food doesn't stay in storage for long, I think that is how it is here.\\n\\nBiryani is Biryani - Have you ever had Chinese pork fried rice?

It brings to Boston/Cambridge a vibe that is often not found here. The restaurant is very open, if not bare, but that is ok. It is a minimalist' heaven with greyish walls and accents and an almost fancy dungeon feel. Some here may not like the atmoshphere, however I love it! In Little Donkey you feel hip; you feel like you're in for a treat!\\n\\nThe food at Little Donkey is no joke as the ingredients are very fresh and you can tell that every detail in the dishes is thought out. Some highlights on the menu are the burger as it is extremely tasty and decadent, as well as the escargot which are salty and full of flavor, served over crusty bread in the shell. For brunch the Toad in a Hole is an egg cooked in a slice of miso banana bread served with creamed spinach and habanero sausage. The banana bread is ridiculous, you can't quite taste the miso however i'm sure you would miss it if it wasn't there. You also need to try the cookie dough, served on an egg beater on a plate it is the perfect amount of sweet to eat any time of the day.\\n\\nThe drinks at Little Donkey are also amazing. They have a decent amount of selection as well as a large enough beer list to accommodate those who prefer not to shell out $14 for a cocktail. They also have oyster shooters, which are little shots of bloody mary, served with your choice of clear liquor, that come with an oyster; which is the perfect chaser in my book!\\n\\nMake sure you make a reservation as the restaurant is always packed.

When I visited in October, it was getting 5-star reviews, and, despite the high price, I'd say it deserved them. Most importantly, back then the fish was lovely. And the fusion worked, for me. Many things we enjoyed at that time are no longer on the menu (our server agreed that she preferred the old offerings, too). All the items we ordered in the fall were well balanced, fun, and delicious. The service was a bit slow even then, but I would have given it four stars. Tonight we went back, since it is close, was on a par with Tomo and Musashino, and was unique. WAS. The menu has been bland-ified to your basic sushi restaurant. The sake list has contracted considerably, as has the wine list. Gone are the fun Caribbean items, such as the plantain appetizer. Even the Ebi Crujiente, which we really loved last time, was sad: the tempura shrimp had been sitting around long enough so the batter was soggy, the shrimp itself tasted musty, the tuna was unexceptional, and the best part of the entire roll was the mound of tempura crumbs that covered it.  The unagi on the dragon roll was yukky, very fishy, not sweet, and cold. The octopus salad on the octopus/squid roll was very nice, with balanced flavors of ginger and pepper. But  that was the exception, and at $15 the roll should have been exceptional. I don't know what motivated the change to the menu. But I will not be returning.

The restaurant was hosting a large party on the 1st floor.  We were seated upstairs at a table better suited for lounging with a drink in your hand... if you are 4 ft tall.  The service was appalling.  The food was horrendous.  Everything was pretty pathetic esp.  considering this is supposed to be an upscale restaurant.  The server was MIA at times...the times when we needed something like our food or drinks or anything you would expect at a restaurant.  She took her sweet time getting our drinks, our food, and our check.  And she forgot things.  The food was equally awful.  We started out with edamame and some roll that was drenched in too sweet sauce that was supposed to be teriyaki I suppose.  Perhaps, I'm a purist when it comes to sushi.  But, alot of these trendy rolls that have everything under the sun slathered, poured, brushed, or squeezed onto the roll really aren't that appealling.  All of that extra crap really detracts from the simple, pleasurable taste of the ingredients of the roll.  As for the entrees, my girlfriend got chicken that smelled like fish and was otherwise dry and bland.  I got chirashi which was not that deplorable.  But, for what chirashi should be, it was not good.  The shrimp was marinaded in something that had mirin or rice vinegar in it, maybe both.  It as well as any of the other seafood shouldn't have anything on it but the pure clean taste that seafood should taste like.\\n\\nI suppose had we sat at a real table, had decent service, and the food was edible (you know, all the things one would expect from a restaurant, let alone an \\"upscale\\" one) maybe our dining experience would have been better.

Imagine hot, soft, and crispy on the edges with tons of delicious garlic and an amazing house made marinara sauce. We also had an order of the octopus which was fantastically tender and simply flavorful. The kale salad was crunchy, fresh in a great in between. The pizzas we ordered were as follows: Crimson ghost, Margarita, and Kbar. Let's not forget that the service was excellent, the server was knowledgeable, super friendly and really knew a fair amount about their craft brew selection. Interestingly she mentioned that there is no crowd favorite for pizza, but everything is equally enjoyed. While that did make me skeptical, everyone in our group of four seemed to have a different pizza preference. I was all about the Kbar, for its quality toppings, rich white pizza cheesiness, and palpable extra garlic. The Crimson ghost provided a sweet and slightly spicy flavor and the margarita had a nice fresh flavor. Another great thing to note about this pizza is that it is cooked in 1000¬∞ ovens. One of the great outcomes of this process is the ability to have an amazingly chewy and fluffy crust. Also, they do beer dinners periodically, including one featuring Crooked Can beers coming up. In summary: amazing quality pizza at a great price, awesome craft beers, friendly knowledgeable service, cool local business and atmosphere.

Everything about it is great.\\n\\nFirst, the donuts are served fresh and warm. The original itself is already great, and then there's all the other special flavors that are also amazing. Personally, my favorite was the nutella and sea salt. My boyfriend really liked the bacon and maple. Also, you're allowed to mix and match the flavors which is a huge plus so you don't have to buy a bunch of each flavor just to try it all. The chai is iced just right (not too little where the chai is still warm, and not so much where the store is just being cheap). \\n\\nSecond, the workers are always smiling and enthusiastic. The service is as friendly as the service at Disneyland! \\n\\nLast, the donuts are already cheap and there's a check-in offer on Yelp?! We forgot to use the offer when we ordered and since the donuts were so good, we got back in line to order more since we had the offer still.\\n\\nIf there's one donut place you're going to try in Portland, ditch Voodoo and come here."},{"name":"Musubi","address":"2134 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love this place !

My wife and I ordered a couple of burgers, one of them without cheese, and chili con queso fries as an appetizer since we were starving. Nothing too complex for a burger place. At this place you pay (and tip) upfront and they give you a table number. I payed (and tipped) but when we went to our table, someone was already sitting there. After and awkward encounter with those people, we asked a server and she gave us a different table. After waiting for 20 mins I asked a server about our appetizer. He says he will check on it. 10 mins after that the burgers came. I had to return mine since it had cheese. I asked about our appetizer again and the server says she will check on it. 10 mins after that a correctly done burger arrived. I asked the server about the appetizer, he says he will check on it. 10 mins after that I am done wolfing down my burger so I stand up to talk to a cashier to tell them that since we are done with the main course, we don't need the appetizer anymore. By the time I'm back at my table, a server had promptly cleaned it (I guess they are way quicker in terms of cleaning up the tables than serving clients) and taken my refillable cup, so no more drinks for me. After waiting for a while on an impeccable table, a manager arrived. I explained the situation, he listed attentively, and then he requested the check and my card without saying anything else. For a second, I imagined that he was sorry and had recognized that the bad service we had received ruined our lunch and had taken the check and my card to give me a full refund hoping that we would be back soon since our experience was not representation of the service at Hopdoddy's. I would have said: \\"thank you sir, we understand and we'll be glad to come back soon and give it another shot ;) \\" But he came back saying that he was gonna give me a refund for the fries, sorry.

We had a younger girl as our waitress, didn't catch her name but it seemed as though she definitely did not want to be there and certainly didn't want us there either.\\n\\nEverything was fine in the beginning as she took our drink order and offered us bread. Once she brought those over we put in for an appetizer, the Thai chicken wraps which were good. When the appetizer was brought over she came over and immediately took the bread off the table which we had barely touched without asking which I thought was a little strange. We put in for the rest of our order when she brought the appetizer over. Fast forward to when we were done with the appetizer she came to clear the plates and left my dirty silverware on the table and instead took away the clean set. It was extremely awkward as she cleared the table as she seemed to just be aggressively throwing the silverware and plates onto the appetizer dish to clear up. Definitely wasn't getting a friendly or welcoming vibe from her whatsoever. Once our food came out, I got the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and my boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken, I had to ask the food runner for clean silverware as she had taken mine.\\n\\nAs we were nearing the end of the meal she came over and my boyfriend asked to have his food wrapped up. I didn't even have a chance to ask for mine wrapped as she grabbed his plate and whipped around and walked off so fast. She came back with his food and again immediately walked away so quickly I couldn't ask for my food to be wrapped up. When she finally did come back I was able to get my food wrapped up and we asked for a dessert menu. My guess is she probably wasn't going to offer one because she certainly didn't want us there any longer. We ordered one piece of cheesecake to split and she brought it over with our check but insisted there was \\"no rush\\".\\n\\nAfter we finished up dessert she asked if we were all set with the check, which we hadn't even touched it yet as we were still eating but we put the cash in anyways. She came over and asked if it was all set again. We said yes and she asked \\"do you need change?\\" My boyfriend said no and that was the end. No \\"thank you\\", \\"have a nice night\\", nothing. To spend over $80 on dinner and feel extremely uncomfortable and rushed the entire time was just not worth it whatsoever. We were checked on maybe 2-3 times the entire night and never once asked/offered refills for our drinks. We would've asked ourselves but barely got to speak as she spun around and ran from our table the few times she did come over. I've been in the industry myself so I really try not to nitpick or even complain at all but it really did ruin our night out."},{"name":"New York Pizza Exchange","address":"2810 Paces Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"It's ok pizza...that's it\\n\\nnot returning.\\n\\nso tired of these Atlanta establishments with NY in their titles.

The chicken, cooked when you order, is always fantastically tender and juicy.

The amazing sides must be had as well. The Mac and Cheese is some of the best I've ever had, and the cole slaw is deliciously tangy, without swimming in any sort of mayo-based sauce. Also, be sure to do yourself the favor of picking up a banana pudding from the front cooler.\\n\\nBut on top of the food, the people who make HCT happen are really what make it so special. Count on being greeted by someone friendly and helpful every time you wait in line. The register staff is great at helping you pick the right heat level if it's your first time visiting. Joe, the owner, has done a fantastic job of growing the staff, and the restaurant, as they've evolved from their beginnings in a tiny pickup window in Old Town East. But he's also done an amazing thing for Columbus, by giving jobs to people who've fallen on hard times, and might otherwise have a hard time finding employment. He's also helped provide housing to staff, and helped send them to college at Columbus State. HCT also makes a habit of donating meals to local shelters at the end of the day.\\n\\nDon't miss out on Hot Chicken Takeover.

The filling is ricotta-y, a bit tart, but smooth and creamy. \\n\\nBut it's not just the cannolis. Everything here is good. The strawberry shortcake is the best I've ever had. The strawberry filling is fresh with not too much cream and the most wonderful cake. It's a perfect ratio and combination of strawberries, cream and cake. The tiramisu is also awesome.\\n\\nBack when I was in college, there was no Yelp, so it was all word of mouth. For a while I went to Mike's until we heard that the locals go to Modern. After trying it, I never went back to Mike's. It's incomparable. \\n\\nIf you get there and there's a line - wait in it!

Northstar is one of the best options when you're at Easton.  Sure, the price is kind of steep when you browse the menu, but you're getting local and/or organic ingredients and the portions are pretty large. Also, the price includes gratuity and there are no waitress/waiters to tip.  Nonetheless the staff is very helpful with whatever you need, if you have questions, etc.  I have ordered the buddha bowl, the sweet basil wrap, the soup and simple salad, the northstar burger and its all delicious!!   You must try one of their humongous cookies!"},{"name":"Banana Leaf","address":"820 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Still having Banana Leaf withdrawals and it's only been two days. This place is awesome!! This was my first experience with Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine so this was definitely exciting. Barely recognized anything on the menu, thankfully I was with a friend who's eaten here before so that was helpful. Other than the calamari we ordered, I seriously did not know what to expect...\\n\\nThis place had a great first impression on me - the place was dimly lit, well decorated and had a busy atmosphere. Peopl chattering in the background, and plates rattling, but I kind of liked that because all of it just added to the ambiance. The food smelled amazing! We were carrying a bunch of stuff with us that day and thankfully the server was very accommodating and took the time to find a space for us to put our things. Service was great overall and I had no problems waiting to order, refilling water or getting the check. \\n\\nMy first Malaysian food experience was amazing - however, this review is only limited to the appetizers. If you're very sensitive to spicy food like I am, you'll have limited options on what to order (most Malaysian food in general can be spicy) especially when ordering the mains. If you are a spice lover, this place is up your alley. Because I didn't want to sweat a waterfall that day, I decided to stick with milder appetizers instead. Don't regret it one bit!\\n\\nFOOD: We ordered the chicken satay skewers, nyonya calamari, roti canai and the vegetable spring rolls. I only got to try the skewers, calamari and the roti so I'll be writing about those. The calamari definitely filled me up the most and was absolutely delicious. Crispy, fluffy breading on the outside and juicy on the inside with a hint of lemon. The satay skewers were full of flavor and IMO the best thing I've tasted in a long time - full of unique Malaysian spices that are sure to explode your taste buds. The satay also comes with a peanut spice sauce that fuels the flavor even further and adds sweetness to it. They don't give you a lot of satay though (4 pieces) compared to how much they give you for the other appetizers. The roti was delicious! Sweet, fried, flaky, just a little oily but will be sure to fill you up and make your experience at Banana Leaf worthwhile.\\n\\nJust writing about the chicken satay and roti is making me hungry... I'll be sure to visit when I come back to Vancouver"},{"name":"Hapa Beach","address":"1516 Yew Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Been going here for almost five years.

I kept hearing about how good their steaks were and finally tried one. It was very good. the mashed potatoes were also yummy.

Oh, and she didn't bat an eye about splitting the check for us -- thank you, thank you.\\n*Even though we were hanging out late and I could tell they were starting to wrap up for the evening, no pressure at ALL to get out. Especially since it was a little chilly outside, appreciated that they didn't give us pointed stares or try to kick us out...\\n*The ambiance is also great -- it's a little dimmer but doesn't feel quiet or too serious at all. There were couples, small families, and even a big group in another part of the restaurant celebrating a birthday. I love that.\\n\\nHighly, highly recommended.

My wife's filet was accompanied with spinach risotto, which I also sampled. It was amazing! The bread basket included multi-grain (Mmmm) and sourdough rolls, along with excellent pretzel bread. We both chose the \\"smoking\\" chocolate mousse for dessert, which my wife loved. Our server, Ashley, made sure all went well and made the dinner perfect.

(All you think you can eat...)\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\nQuantity: They offer a different variety of dishes: appetizers, fried rice, soup, bbq, sushi, tempura, fried chicken, tofu, salad, etc. My friends and I pretty much ordered a little bit of everything. \\n\\nFood: Since this is not a typical KBBQ joint, there are less variety of meat on the lunch menu (not too sure about the dinner menu). There were BBQ chicken, beef, pork chops and spicy pork. Kim chi was good. All the meat were marinated and seasoned very nicely. The fried tofu was very light and not too oily. The fried chicken is very crispy. The salmon and tuna sashimi were pretty fresh. \\n\\nAmbiance: Cute but a little tacky. We were seated in a boat-shaped table towards the back of the restaurant. I thought that was cute but we all had to take off our shoes to get in. \\n\\nPrice: $20 for all you can eat. If you like meat and sushi then it's worth it. Since it is an all you can eat establishment, it's more focused on quantity than quality. I can chow down so i got my moneys worth. \\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nService: Since we arrived an hour before lunch was over, we were told that we can only order once. That was difficult because it was our first time there and we didn't know how big the portion sizes were. The service was seemed a little rushed and they missed a few items we ordered.

In the summer, you must arrive by 6:15pm (no wait) at the latest; plan on relaxing at your table until the sun goes down.  If you arrive around 7pm, you are going to wait in 1 line to get on the list for a table (around 30 minutes), then the list-line will be a 1-1.5 hour wait (depending on how far off sunset is).  The wait time difference is SIGNIFICANT depending on when you arrive.\\n2)  Bring good friends/family - this place is a GREAT place to sit back and relax and catch up with friends.  Don't bring impatient people who don't like to linger over a meal.\\n3)  Don't drink the on-the-rocks margaritas.  Even the bartenders suggest the frozen; befriend the bartender in the lower-level bar, it's worthwhile.\\n4)  Don't valet, park and do the shuttle if you don't want to walk.\\n5)  Order generic food.  Read the reviews.  I, personally, have never had a bad fajita here, but I would suggest steering clear of the \\"mexican\\" food.  The oasis is not known for their food.  Remember, you are going there for the VIEW and the ATMOSPHERE.\\n\\nPlease remember, this is a fantastic place to people watch, statue watch (weird), look at the view, chill with your friends and family, shop for lovely jewelry (oh wait, got caught up in the oasis moment).  It will seem like Sea World when you approach, but remember -- there are cocktails inside, don't be intimidated.  And most importantly.  TIMING TIMING TIMING.  If you don't want to wait, get there during the \\"Luby's hour\\" (as I call the 6 oclock dining hour).  I, personally, am an operational manager - I'd love to take the management over just to help streamline the people herding, but if you can set that aside (easy to do), then you won't mind the strange inconveniences of lines to get into line (it feels like you are living a fractal pattern).\\n\\nPS.

The concept seems to be some sort of Houston's/J.Alexander's clone but doesn't quite deliver.  The menu lacks any real originality (aside from an appetizer of deviled eggs, maybe not original--but points for retro cool!) and offers food from all categories.  Steaks, seafood, salads, burgers and the like.  It 's all pretty standard fare.  I was in the mood for a steak and ordered the Steak Frites.  I should have been a little weary ordering a classic French bistro dish at a chain restaurant from the deep south.  The rib eye steak itself was so thinly cut that I felt like it was a \\"minute steak\\" you'd fry up for a cheese steak sandwich.  Alas it was over cooked.  The aforemetioned frites were simply fries from the freezer and served with an \\"aioli\\" that was clearly just commercial mayonaise with some garlic powder stirred in.  There was a strange little garnish of overly dressed field greens on the side--I suppose they fealt by adding some \\"fancy lettuce\\" it would make the dish more French.  My dinner companion opted for some red meat as well and ordered the NY Strip. His porttion was tiny as well, and was topped with the same herb butter as my steak.  His baked potato looked small as well.  This sort of food can be had at any standard hotel lobby restaurant in anywhere USA.  The restaurant was decorated that way as well.  It was all clean and sort of bland. They even had a framed collage of wine corks (how original).  Desserts were so uninspiring (and pre-made), I thought I was at Bob's Big Boy.\\n\\nService was fine, with no real complaints.  The restaurant was empty and we were our server's only table.\\n\\nI cannot reccomend this place, and I am still not sure who they are targeting.  With MF Sushi opening next door, The Intercontinental Hotel across the street, and Craft opening a block away I cannot see how Bricktops will survive.

Everything about it went bad. Decided to come here for Valentine's day with my boyfriend and another couple because we love seafood and trying out new places. We had reservations, was there early, and it still took too long to get seated especially when the place was not even packed. The manager even tried to stall seating us. When we were seated, we ordered drinks that took more than 30 minutes to come out and when they did, every single drink was watered down because it had been sitting for too long waiting to be served. We even asked for water in the meantime but that eventually came out AFTER the drinks. By then, we wanted to leave but decided that we should just stick it out considering we didn't want to give up on the place just yet.\\n\\nWe proceeded to order two lbs of snow crab with specific flavoring and two entrees. When our food came out, the waiter told us that he forgot to put in the order of waffle fries and that now the fries will be on the house. Seriously? You wanna know what came out last? Our sides (salads to be specific) but this was just minor. Bibs and gloves never even came out and we ended up asking for it twice before it made its way. The last straw came when the crab legs were cold and flavoring was wrong. Ordered extra spicy coconut curry but got just the curry. Not taking it any longer, we asked to speak to the manager to tell him of our disappointment with the cold food. He then goes to reheat the crab legs but we were just over it. They even had the bartender come over to our table to try ease the terrible experience. She decided to redo our drinks. All of a sudden, two lbs of alaskan king crab comes out onto our tables. Was this on the house too? Because we weren't paying for these extras. As honest customers, we told them this wasn't what we ordered and we decided to cancel this terrible experience altogether. You know what the the manager did? Went ahead and charged us for that disgusting experience. We were charged for digging into our entree of salmon but did he forget the salad and waffle fries was a part of the entree and that it barely made its way out? He TRIED charging us for drinks the bartender redid. He also TRIED to put the blame on the waiter. I'm sorry but there was ONLY ONE waiter serving for at least seven tables around us including ours. It wasn't the waiter's fault. He did what he could with 100% effort. As for the manager, when you make an excuse to your customers that we should be mindful that it's Valentine's Day and the place is packed, you sound quite silly. How about overstaffing for the busy holiday so you wouldn't have this problem? And you sounded even more silly when you blamed your hardworking waiter for the terrible experience. Your staff reflects you manager sir and so maybe you're the one not doing your job correctly.\\n\\nAt the end, we paid for one entree and we tipped our waiter 100%. So happy to say we won't be returning because there are way better options elsewhere (what we had at atlantic kitchen was mediocre, overpriced, & wrong), even if the manager insists we come back for a complimentary entree. That entire experience should've been complimentary because for two hours, we had scrap for dinner.

We crossed 93 and followed the crowds up Salem Street past dozens of restaurants slinging pasta, slices and cappuccinos.  The trendier restaurants had long lines down the block and something told us to avoid the ones with no lines.  So we took a quick left off the main drag and asked a local for a recommendation.  Without a second thought, she directed us a couple more blocks to Massimino's Cucina Italiana.  \\n There was no line to speak of, but we were directed downstairs to wait at the bar behind two other parties for a table.  In that time, my wife became good friends with Angelo, the bar tender.  It didn't take long before Angelo knew everything about us, from our medical history to our 25th wedding anniversary.  He helped the time fly with his North End humor and accent.  A complimentary glass of the house red for our occasion was warmly received.\\n When a corner table opened up on the main floor, we were welcomed by our server, Mike. (\\"My name is Mike and I'll get what you like!\\")  He wore a white smock and a huge smile through the whole meal.  He didn't so much recite the specials as perform them, his arms and whole being punctuating his description of each mouth-watering dish.  I went for the seafood limoncello: fresh shrimp and scallops in a rich tangy sauce over broad homemade pasta.  My wife selected the tortellini parmesan and saut√©ed escarole to fulfill her vegetarian cravings.  After enjoying our meals, Mike brought us a tiramisu with a candle for our anniversary.

The wings, pretty meaty, lightly breaded (looked like flour) and very hot for hot!  I was expecting something a little milder for hot and this wasn't the extra hot either!

The wings were perfect the batter on them was very light didn't drown out the chicken at all. The cat fish was perfection as well! And these waffles... best I've ever had!

I had heard great reviews of the food so I had no choice but to check it out.  I sampled two dishes - the Raviloini Di Vitella (Raviolini filled with veal & pecorino romano in grappa tomato butter with ricotta salata, basil oil & basil fritte) and Bistecca Tagliatta Con Patate Fritte (Oak fire grilled Niman Ranch hanger steak with a veal ridurre with patate fritte, saut√©ed baby spinach & a parmesan roasted tomato).  \\n\\nThe ravioli was some of the best I have ever had.  The texture of the pasta and the filling was perfectly balanced.   The sauce made with grappa tomato butter and basil oil was fantastic.  I licked the plate.  Can I have that sauce in a soup bowl?  It's mostly butter you say?  Awesome.  Can't go wrong with butter soup.\\n\\nThe hanger steak had a smokey flavor, and eating the fries brought me joy.  The tomato was perfectly roasted with a crispy and bubbly layer of cheese.  I'll be back for more."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Yum!

Yeah fish are cool. Also, they are tasty. You like to eat tasty fish? Go here, the fish are tasty. I ate a tasty beer-battered something or other with some fries and some Heinz Malted Vinegar sauce. It had a recipe for \\"Peachy Chicken\\" on the back, but that sounds like it sucks. Not like the food, which did not suck. I thought it was a good price point and stuff because there was no full on service, just some dudes bringing out food to our table which had a number on it. Best fish you can get, really. You couldn't cook it yourself for that money- not that you can cook fish, because cooking fish is a pain in the ass. It's like moving. Just pay someone else to do it and sit back and enjoy.
