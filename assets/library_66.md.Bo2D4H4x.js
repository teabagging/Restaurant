About a 15 minute drive from Austin on a Monday. \\n\\nRestaurant: You feel you're in the South/Southwest by the decor. The outside has a Texas feel. With a small breeze, you can smell BBQ miles away. The inside reminded me of camp: cabin-like feel with many wooden benches and tables. This place is definitely for families or groups. The minute you enter, you see a huge bbq pit by the cash register where they prepare sausage, ribs, and brisket for to-go orders. This place is serious about bbq!\\n\\nFood: I ordered the ribs plate. Great ribs, not tough at all, and seasoned very well. My bro-in-law had the combo plate with ribs, brisket, and summer sausage. Prepared very well and came with cole slaw, beans, and potato salad. Potato salad is dry, which I like, so those who like the creamy texture might be disappointed.\\n\\nService: our server was very friendly. She checked up on us to see how we were doing and filled our refills and gave us more bread.\\n\\nOverall: if you like BBQ and have a healthy appetite, definitely come here. The value is excellent. The combo plate and all-u-can-eat items are under $15, which is affordable. It may be higher as we went for lunch, after 4pm it is $18.95. The sides (beans, slaw, onions, and pickles)are very good and there's even a vegetable plate. \\nTwo negatives: the Salt-Lick is in a dry county, so it's BYOB. So you'll see many folks bring coolers of beer for the eating festivities. Also, it's cash only, but there's an ATM. I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in mood for BBQ; who knows, if I'm hungry enuff I might tackle the buffet plate.

However, unbeknownst to many Atlantans, Cheshire strip's very own Little Bangkok is arguably one of the better Thai restaurants in intown Atlanta outside of Buford Highway. As an added bonus, they also serve up some fairly decent Chinese food - sans the surly attitude, questionable ingredients, and scuzzy atmosphere that seems to plague their competitors elsewhere in the near vicinity.  \\n\\nFood: The name and related signage outside Little Bangkok touts its Thai Cuisine, but they actually serve an extensive array of Chinese cuisine as well. The latter is predominately Americanized dishes that will appeal to the masses, but the Thai cuisine is quite authentic. Those not used to traditional Thai cuisine may not be prepared for the spice levels, and thus, should order accordingly - their version of mild is essentially equivalent to most American's idea of a three alarm hot sauce. Our table of six ordered a diverse assortment of appetizers and entrees from both menus, all of which were gargantuan in portion and packed with flavor. As one would expect, most entrees are served with a side of white rice. Alcohol is served. \\n\\nService: Efficient, but not particularly friendly. Multiple different staff attended to us throughout the meal, so we didn't really have  a dedicated server, which became problematic when requests were made -it was essentially a crap shoot in terms of whether the message would eventually be relayed to the appropriate person. There were also some delays with delivery of certain entrees, which resulted in a situation were some members of the party were forced to sit awkwardly in front of their food waiting for the other diners' entrees to arrive.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: The aesthetic would best be described is Thai grandma chic - the walls and every available surface are littered with various Asian knickknacks. The restaurant is cramped and loud during peak dining hours, so be prepared to eat and evacuate the premises in a timely fashion. Our party had the misfortune of being seated at the round table directly at the entrance, which is arguably the worst seat in the house - the booths along the side walls are better bets for those seeking some semblance of privacy during their meal. \\n\\nCost: Very reasonably priced. Dinner appetizers are $3-$5 and entrees are $9-$11. Lunch items are generally $6-$7. No separate checks are allowed and gratuity will be added for parties of five or more.  \\n\\nOther: Little Bangkok is open daily for dinner and Monday-Friday for lunch. Lunch is served 11:30AM-2:30PM and dinner is served 5PM-10PM on Monday-Thursday and 5PM-11PM on Friday and Saturday. Parking is an absolute nightmare - there are a handful of spots outside the front of the restaurant, but otherwise, you're on your own in terms of trying to find a space that won't get your booted, towed, or stolen - good luck, folks."},{"name":"Sushi House","address":"3779 Sexsmith Road, Suite 2182","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Delicious sushi in a quaint setting.

We had already discussed ahead of time that we were going to celebrate sometime on the weekend, vs on actual Valentines Day since it was a Monday. Where we were going, I had no idea... until about 30 minutes before when he dropped a few hints and I figured it out. Needless to say, I was super excited because I had been meaning to try this place!\\n\\nJeremy K had given my boyfriend a tip before we headed out. Originally, he had asked for a quiet table, but per Jeremy K's recommendation of sitting at the bar/prepping area we decided to do that. What a treat! You can have a quiet table in a nice restaurant anytime... but having ring side seats for the prep of all the food was truly something special to watch. Those guys move around SO FAST, you'd swear they were former professional athletes. Scoop some ice cream and plate it here, run and pop bread in the oven there, throw some precisely placed garnish on a dish, and send it out... you name it, they did it all.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I have VERY different tastes. I can't eat seafood. He doesn't like meat (other than chicken) and doesn't like creams/cheese, etc. He likes red wine. I like sweet white wine. Being that it was our Valentines day celebration, and he is a true gentleman, he gave me ladies pick for the wine. I chose (with the help of our server) the 2008 Willi Schaefer Riesling. The wine was a sweet, wet, wine... just the kind I like, and for $55 it was a very nice bottle, and both of us enjoyed it.\\n\\nFor dinner our server was really talking up the Chef's tasting, and after I told her that I always missed out on those because I can't eat seafood, she assured me it was no problem to do one all meat. I thought this over and although I can be a picky eater... decided I was going to go for it. My boyfriend decided he was just going to have some seafood... and then we were told that when they do the Chef's tasting, they really ask for both of you to do them. Not to worry... they did his all seafood since he doesn't eat most meat! We heard our order get put in \\"Tasting All meat, Tasting All seafood.\\" Fantastic.\\n\\nNow, I'll admit, I am not a foodie. I have absolutely no idea everything that I was served. I know I had some pig cheek (wasn't a fan of the texture of this), I had a few different types of foie gras, goat with soup around it, and all kinds of other dishes. For one of the courses, Chef Tony Maws himself came over to present it. In fact, just about every course had a different presenter. It made me realize how extensive the knowledge ALL of the staff have... not just one or two people. Now, again... I'm not a foodie, so I apologize for not doing these dishes justice with describing what they were, what was involved, and how rich the flavors were.... because they were truly amazing. The sweetbreads were good, but knowing what they are I don't think I'd opt for them again. My boyfriend loved just about every bit of seafood that crossed his plate... and we were so stuffed after this tasting... but wait... there was dessert on the way!\\n\\nWe were served some sorbet to cleanse our palates. This is probably the only sweet thing that my boyfriend likes to eat. We made a comment similar to this to our server and she goes \\"Well.... there is more dessert on the way... what kind of desserts do you like? You're not a big chocolate fan... okay... do you like... cake?\\" After a bit of back and forth she talked with the chefs. Not only did my boyfriend get an extra scoop of the sorbet, but he was also given a dessert that best fit his tastes - an apple tart of sorts.\\n\\nTo top it all off I had a glass of Muscat, and my boyfriend had some green tea. Our server retrieved our coats for us, and even called us a cab. Excellent customer service from the very beginning until the very end.

Echoing what others have said these sandwiches can be messy, needed a good handful of napkins to tackle it. I really liked the sausage but for some reason just couldn't love the rest of the sandwich. Maybe it was the cucumber or the cilantro but it just didn't pop for me like other great sandwiches I have had. The fries were ok as well. Not all that crispy but with a great seasoning on it. \\n\\nAll in all I am glad I tried this place, the people who were there are just as nice as everyone says. I would probably go back to Short Bus Subs if I were at this location again over F.O.T ."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Excellent food combined with superb service and a lively atmosphere makes this place a success.

Our main waiter had asked us if we had any allergies and I told him I had allergies to certain fruits that were raw but if they are cooked it was fine.

The food is superb, the first couple of times I had the portabello mushroom sandwich. It's delicious, especially if you love something meaty. However, my mom took me there for my birthday and I had the special of the day which was some kind of rice goodness. (I'm not great at being a food critic) but that too was excellent. In fact, I haven't encountered a food there that I don't like. The only down side is that every once in a while you get a waiter that seems to have a little judgment in their service. My dad is kind of an outspoken man and well he wanted everyone to know that he'd rather be at the fried chicken joint or whatever down the street and the waiter and the gay couple that sat next to us kept giving him and the rest of us the evil eye. I prefer to order food to go from there because of that. However, I'd have to say if you're looking for a healthy meal or a vegetarian menu this is one of the best restaurants in the area. You can't go wrong. But perhaps get your food to go. The restaurant itself is a little small and it kind of feels congested because it's often quite busy."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Sauce.  It's definitely star of the show at Salt Lick and to the guy who, legend tells, stands around a giant bowl mixing batch after batch of the top-secret-recipe goodness in an undisclosed location somewhere South of Austin, I say \\"Thanks.\\"  Unfortunately my excitement for this place pretty much ends there.  \\n\\nWhat was probably once a small, tasty, family-owned and family-friendly place has become a bit of a Disney World money-driven hub of consumerism.  From the parking lot attendants who refuse unloading of passengers by the restaurant and herd you through a maze of dusty cedar post fences to a massive dirt parking lot (without the Mickey trolley to take you to the entrance), to the storefront shop peddling various BBQ themed wares by the entrance/exit, the only thing missing was the awkward sixteen year old in a Mickey Mouse suit.  Though on a Saturday afternoon he may very well be hanging around in all his sweaty glory.  \\n\\nI suppose it's all inevitable for a place whose legend has outgrown reality.  I'm all for institutions, for places that are part of local lore, but I'm not going to pull punches in my reviews for them just because they are popular or old.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at Salt Lick get points.  It's rustic, family friendly and even complete with live music in the outside picnic table waiting area.  But all the people chowing down on appetizers from home (really?) who joined us there should have been a warning sign.  \\n\\nAnd while atmosphere is important, a restaurant is really about the food and it's here that the wheels fall off the covered wagon outside.  Most of my party (4 out of 5) opted for the family style dining experience.  Bad decision.  The all-you-can-eat extravaganza set us each back $20+ bucks and included decent coleslaw--if you like vinegar, hot potato salad--which I admit was relatively good, pinto beans--which paled in comparison to those I remember from our annual elementary school hamburger supper, and meat.  \\n\\nMeat.  You'd think that would be one thing you could count on to be good at a BBQ joint.  First of all, even at that exorbitant price, turkey wasn't included as part of the family dining experience.  Strike one.  The sausage tasted just like the Hillshire Farms stuff you get from the local market.  Strike two.  The brisket was more fat than meat, not once, but three of the four times we sent it back to the kitchen and asked for actual MEAT.  Strike three, you're out.  Too bad at that point I didn't really care that the pork ribs were pretty tasty.  \\n\\nI suppose I was just in too much shock that a restaurant who is known for the best BBQ in or near Austin had let me down so rapidly and so completely.    The service wasn't great either.  And don't get me started on the peach cobbler my friends ordered.  Take a can of peaches out of your pantry, dump about 6 cups of sugar and a dash of cinammon on top and pour a cake mix with or without liquid on top and throw it in the oven for a few minutes and you'll have something better.  I spit out the bite I tried.  It wasn't worth it.\\n\\nAll in all I can't recommend the 20-40 minute drive to get to Salt Lick for the food, but if you want to experience the legend for yourself go check it out in all it's mediocre glory.

However, this one may have a leg up on the others in terms of the fresh, high-quality seafood that's available, given it's in Boston. I had the best lobster here that I've ever eaten in my life. And my baseline for that comparison includes other lobsters, heck even fresh-caught lobsters in Maine. This lobster was so exceptional that I still think about it years after having relocated from the Boston area. It was so exceptional that our over-cooked (and over-priced) fillet seemed a small casualty, not to mention the stuffy atmosphere and inattentive waitstaff. Needless to say, the lobster made an otherwise disappointing meal very memorable. I sometimes wonder if maybe it was completely arbitrary that I got great lobster here, and I'm honestly afraid of tarnishing my blissful memory by ordering lobster at this location ever again.

One of my favorite treats is the hazelnut torte, a perfect compliment to a good cup of coffee (which Mozart's also offers!).

The main problem here is twofold: terribly overpriced food that is at best average, at worst unappetizing. Fine, fine, I'm a vegan, blah blah blah, but whatever: \\n\\nFirst, the tofu scramble is way overpriced. $11.50 for scram and toast--no homefries! You want those, oh you're going to have to get those as a side, and pay an $3.95. Oh, you'd like a coffee with your early morning breakfast too? Well that'll cost you $2.25. So now we're up to--add it up--$17.70 for your breakfast, and that's sans tax and tip. So basically you're at $22 if you're stingy on the tip. \\n\\nAb-surd. \\n\\nBut maybe the food is really good, you wonder? Maybe they just really do it up such that sometimes it's worth paying $22 for breakfast. But no, it's not. The tofu scramble was un-lovingly crafted, and from what I could tell the vegetables in the to-scram were precooked and then just perfunctorily tossed into the 'mix' on the grill until the food got hot enough to slop in front of me. \\n\\nOh, one more thing: you want some peanut butter for that toast? That'll cost ya, too. \\n\\nI vowed to never come back. Then tonight happened. \\n\\nThe order: the Trident Salad ($14.50) with tofu (an extra $3.00). Already at a fever pitch of absurdity for the price, I went ahead anyways and when the meal came it was without exaggeration half the size it should have been for the price, and--again--I swear that meal wasn't made ready to order but was basically some slopped together version of what had been hanging around and cooked in the kitchen throughout the day. \\n\\nThe tofu for an extra $3? I'd say 1/6\\" slices--3 of them. So a dollar each. A travesty. \\n\\nI was still hungry after that and, since I have no self-respect, I decided to order a basket of fries for a whopping $4.75. In a few moments out came a basket that is roughly...2.5\\" wide by 4.5\\" long, about 3 quarters filled with fresh-from-the-bag-frozen-skinny fries. \\n\\n$4.75. \\n\\nAnyways. Avoid. They're obviously losing hard on the failing business model that is selling books in a bricks and mortar, and so are gouging on the food. That's actually fine, do what you need to do. But if you're going to charge those prices, make the meal at least respectable, if not something to feel happy paying absurd prices for. \\n\\nI left for one person at $30 after tax and tip.

Before I start I want to just say that there were like....maybe 5 tables in the entire patio with 3 servers. Servers didn't greet us for like 10 minutes. Took our drink orders and didn't show up afterwards. Table of 5 guys sat down near us and had their food order taken first. We waved the server down and ordered food and told her to ring ours in first as we had been waiting for like 20 minutes at that point, already starving. Still no sign of our drinks for another 5 minutes or so. Waved her down again for drinks and asked her if they were still coming and the server just YELLED \\"can't you see I'm slammed!?\\" instead of a simple apology. We look around puzzled at her reaction since she had like 3 tables to herself with a helper. She finally brought them....coffee cold, spilled it all over the table and didn't apologize. Didn't bring a spoon or stir stick. No cream, no sugar. Not even cutlery. We waited and waited and coffee was basically ice coffee at that point that we basically just got up and grabbed our own sugar and cutlery from the server cubbys. Food took another 20-25 minutes and at this point we could have already been eating at the Score. Meanwhile, I see 3 other tables stand up and walk around to find the server. One was complaining that they had been there forever and wanted to settle their bill. Another table was complaining that nobody had greeted them yet...and so on and so forth. Basically it just reaffirmed that we weren't being h-angry and difficult. Food finally comes. Wrong. Just wrong. We asked for some modifications and they weren't honoured, eggs weren't even done the way we asked them. Food was OK, too salty but who the hell cares with that level of service.

Maybe I could understand avoiding the normal theatrics of a smoking fajita paraded through the dining room, but ours were both not only not smoking, but barely warm. And the nice char the blazing cast iron gives was sorely missed as well. In fact, there was almost no discernible flavor at all other than salt. The amount of chicken was laughable, as the dish was mostly peppers. \\n\\nAs for the sides, between us we chose all three available options. The grilled corn was terrible, which you could tell before you even tasted it. The kernels were deflated and wrinkled, and looked like the corn was cooked hours earlier. The rice was dry, and my wife only ate a few forkfuls before throwing in the towel. We both had the beans, which were passable if not very interesting.\\n\\nWe both left hungry, but with the added benefit of being $50 lighter.

My wife and I have been dining here for over 12 years (since 2003) and have always enjoyed the Persian cuisine at Alborz. Since the first visit, not much has changed over the years as far as quality and value, which is a good thing to report.\\n\\nTucked away in a strip mall off Anderson Avenue & Mopac, this restaurant was once an Italian venue in the late 90's. Owners Mo & Fara Kosari built it into the vanguard of Persian cuisine that it is today. Recent changes to the interior include new tile on the floors and lamps that really open up and beautify the space. \\n\\nPersian cuisine is very healthy and is one of the more tasty cuisines you will experience. The menu features many popular Persian dishes that are all worth trying. If you're a foodie like myself, it will even inspire you try cooking it at home. I've successfully made Kebab Koobideh and Sholeh Zard at home and my wife wants to try and make the most delicious item on the menu, Roulette cake, having finally found the recipe online.\\n\\nAlborz' Roulette cake is a typical Persian dessert also called Rollet or Roulade, and is similar to a sponge cake with cream/fruit filling. In my opinion, it is the restaurant's signature dessert dish. We were told by Doug, a long-time employee at Alborz, that it is made by the owner's wife and is available occasionally, if she has had the time to make it. We have struck out on the last few times we've dined there, hoping to experience this wonderful dessert.\\n\\nThe Kebab-e-Barg is fantastic, especially when you consider these delicious cuts of Filet Mignon are only $17.95 for the platter. It alone will fill you up; I always find a way to eat slowly so that I can bring some home to enjoy the next day. I also love the Kebab-e-Koobideh, which offers the ground beef version of the Barg.\\n\\nTo me a standout here is their incredibly delicious Kashk-o-Bademjan. I could easily fill a crockpot full and bring it home and eat it for days. They really do this dish well here and the quality hasn't changed in the many years I've dined here. \\n\\nFinally there's the service. Doug, who I think is the head waiter or manager, has been working here since I first started dining here in 2003. He is definitely a fixture here and very attentive, always keeping your beverages filled. He is very helpful if you are a first-time visitor and can suggest dishes you may like. Another awesome waiter who is very good here is Pearls.\\n\\nI was also very impressed with the traditional Persian hospitality I was given one cold winter day back a few years ago. I was in the area on business and stopped by to pick up some take out to bring home as dinner for a surprise to my wife. I sat at the bar area and was offered some hot Persian tea by owner Mo Kosari. I drank the tea in the traditional Persian way, sugar cube between my teeth whilst sipping the tea. There was no charge for this which I found to be endearing, especially on a bitterly cold winter's day.\\n\\nI've enjoyed this restaurant and cuisine for over 12 years. Here's looking forward to another 12!\\n\\nNooshe Jan!

While there are many great regional traditions and styles from sea to shining sea, the legends of Hill Country are, in this Yelper's opinion, unequaled. Just a little off the beaten path, Salt Lick BBQ in Driftwood is worth the drive to experience the savory gold cooking in their pits. \\n\\nEn route from San Antonio to Austin, my friend and I pinned Salt Lick as the first stop on our BBQ tour of Hill Country. Situated right next to a winery, it's a BYOB, family style restaurant with plenty of seating, indoor and out. As soon as you walk in, you have a front row seat to their massive pit; if that doesn't get your taste buds watering, you're in the wrong place, just go home.\\n\\nUpon sitting down, I ordered Thurman's choice, which has sausage, ribs, and brisket, accompanied by sides. Wow. The ribs were pretty good, and the sausage was a pleasant surprise (hadn't expected to like it, turned into my second favorite entree), but it was the brisket that made this trip transcendent. I immediately ordered another 1/2 pound to go. The sides were hearty and plentiful, and the sauce complemented everything. \\n\\nService was friendly and prompt, with both the cashiers and our servers helping to walk us first timers through the process. I don't know when I'll be back to Hill Country, but when I do, you can bet I'll be adding Salt Lick to the itinerary."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I think the seafood at Giacomo's is very fresh and good, and the prices are surprisingly reasonable for a North End establishment, hence the 4 stars.\\n\\nHowever, this place is overhyped.

For a few months, I bought it by the gallon until I came to my senses and realized that was costing me an arm and a leg! \\n\\nThing I'm not so fond of: the creepy joy of the staff. Yes, I know they have to respond to a \\"thank you\\" with a \\"my pleasure!\\" but it gets to be a bit much. Or maybe I just say thank you too often.

I keep going back hoping that I will suddenly 'see the light' and start craving their breakfasts, but I just don't, and probably never will.\\n\\nFirst of all, their potato seasoning is just plain disgusting.  Every dish that comes with potatoes is instantly ruined for me with that weird, creepy orange mystery powder coloring everything I put into my mouth.  It's so strong that even if it were tasty (which is isn't) it would overpower everything else on the plate.\\n\\nI had some kind of chunky cream cheese chive sausage scramble once(I tried to find their menu to look up what it's called and what exactly it has in it, but their site was under construction) that was just all right.  I didn't particularly want to keep eating it after the first few bites.  And then the next time I had this dill, veggie, English muffin sort of thing (as you can see, I seriously need online menus to write legible reviews!) which was so incredibly dill-heavy that not only did I not want to eat it after the first two bites, I was literally unable to without making myelf sick.  And I couldn't turn to my side dish (the evil potatoes!) for relief.\\n\\nIt might just be that this place's specialty is the sweeter breakfasts, which I never go for at any restaurant (I just prefer savory food in general).  Their specials almost always are some kind of fancy waffle or pancake.  And I've never tried those, so take this review with that particular grain of salt.\\n\\nAlso, the service is completely unpredictable.

It wasn't until I ordered my dish did the waitress notify us that the rice sets are actually part of their lunch specials so it was $10 for the panko pork rice set as opposed to the $13 listed on their menu. \\n\\nMy order was the first to come but on quick examination, there was a large lint piece on my panko pork. They did take the dish away to confirm with the chef that it was a piece of lint and advised that they would remake my order. I liked how the waitress and chef handled the matter; definitely very professional and to be honest, a piece of lint is usually not a problem for me in my food but since the waitress was eyeing our table (because there was only two parties) and she made the effort to come over to our table, I decided to mention the lint. \\n\\nSince they had to remake my dish, my order was the last to come (which is fine and understandable). While the new panko pork that I got was hot, it was quite dry and definitely needed to be dipped in the soup and sauce. Our waitress also came around and gave us another order of panko pork on its own and said it was on the house however based on the temperature of this one compared to mine, it was much colder. Could it be the one I sent back?

This is the rest of Texas (Austin is more like San Francisco) and it's freaking me out....in a good way.

The mussels appetizer was big enough for 2-3 people. They were in a red sauce that had a little bit of heat. I don't like spicy food, but these were delicious and the spice wasn't over the top. The caprese salad had 3-4 pieces of mozzarella and tomato each. Again, big enough for two people to share as a starter. The mozzarella and tomato were thick cut and juicy. \\n\\nFor an entree we had the gnocchi in the bolognese sauce that the bar tender suggested. It came out in a steaming crock that needed some type to cool down. This dish was also large enough for two people to share. There were plenty of gnocchi as it wasn't all sauce. We also used the bread that they provide to dip into the bolognese sauce. Delicious and we want to go back to try another dish. \\n\\nOur server/bartender was also top notch.

They have an ATM on site, but if you whip out the gold card, they'll whip out an apron for you.\\n\\n3. It's Busy.  If you are there at a peak time, be ready to hang out a while.  Don't worry though, there is plenty for the kids to do and usually live music going on.  \\n\\nIf you want to make an afternoon of it, there is a nice, big, fenced play area for the kids with picnic tables.  Heck, get the food to go and just eat it out there if you have rowdy kids like mine.\\n\\nAt $20 a head for adult's all you can eat brisket, sausage, pork ribs and sides you get your money's worth.

This is the point where they lost my business forever. The guy behind the counter gave me this really blank look as if I were crazy and after staring at him for a good minute, he then turns to another guy who tells him to just grab another roll from the same bag the first roll came from. Great idea! Replace the moldy roll with another roll from the same moldy bag! I then asked if I could just get another jalapeno instead of a roll, 'cause I didn't want to have to deal with more mold. There is exactly a 2 cent difference between a roll and a jalapeno, and I would've been happy to pay it. He hesitated for a few seconds before going over, getting a jalapeno and giving it over.

After setting into our room at the Comfort Inn, I quickly logged onto Yelp to see what else was in the neighborhood. After some investigation, The Old Mohawk sounded promising. In my random conversation with Jim B., my coworker, I mentioned they offered turtle soup which somehow segued into a story from his childhood about some neighbor who used to make homemade turtle soup. I don't believe I have ever had such a discussion about turtle soup as I have today. \\n\\nAfter a short walk through the charming German Village area of Columbus, we found ourselves entering The Old Mohawk. Proudly displaying local art on the walls, and featuring a bar at the heart of the dining room complete with turtle stained glass lampshade, the dining room was comfortable and casual. The menu was wildly varied; I was overjoyed to see so many Vegetarian options. I ended up ordering the homemade black bean burger with the kettle chip upgrade, cup of veggie chili, and a Four String Cherry Blonde pint from the bar. Jim had the turtle soup--which surprisingly was not green but more akin to my chili--and the Mother Mohawk sandwich, which is a peculiar pairing of grilled roast beef with cold chicken salad on marbled rye. \\n\\nI was really pleased with my black bean burger though I was it was a little less mushy. It was served with provolone, lettuce, tomato and onion, the latter two I had held. The kettle chips were totally the right call--perfectly crispy and freshly made--there's no comparison to bagged Ruffles. It really was a tough decision on ordering--I came close to trying their three cheese grilled cheese, making a custom quesadilla (which I love that I know they were added to the menu in 1986 as per the timeline on the back of the menu), and the crustless pizza, an Old Mohawk original of penne with sauce, baked cheese and toppings. \\n\\nI think my favorite part of the dinner was actually the dessert. I think I reached an Urkel level of geeked when I spotted the Pumpkin Roll on the dessert board. It was presented with three dollops of real whipped cream, caramel drizzle and was perfectly moist. The cream cheese inside was smooth and velvety--it was almost like a cream cheese custard--probably one of the best desserts I have ever had.\\n\\nI also loved that I got to question the waitress about them keeping the turtles in the basement (according to their menu they used to keep them in a pit in the basement in 1933)--they don't. She did tell us that she believes the restaurant is haunted! I tried to suggest a Silence of the Lambs-esque \\"Do you hear the turtles Clarice?\\" notion, but she crushed my cinematic dreams with a tale of spinning bar stools instead. \\n\\nI would gladly return to the Old Mohawk, and have already started laying the groundwork for next year's trip.

Such is the case of Aki Restaurant. \\n\\nLocated in an almost deserted strip mall on the end of a street that most tourists don't even know exists, we almost drove right past it even knowing it was somewhere right there. You'll never spot it from the road.  This is truly a hidden little gem of a restaurant.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is tiny with maybe 10 tables, and they're all very squished together. Our table was so close to the one next to us, I could have easily just reached over without stretching and yoinked something off their plates.\\n\\nBeing a tiny restaurant works for them though, as service is quick and friendly. The menu is small and very unpretentious. You're not going to find crazy fusion rolls here. The most complicated roll you'll find is a volcano roll. The focus here is on the flavors of the fish with most rolls containing no more than one type of fish. The crab roll is made with actual crab (I believe it said snow crab) - not k-rab. While the menu is small, it can be a little confusing though - many of the items are not described or explained at all. There is one small section of the menu that had no English translation at all.\\n\\nBetween our group of four, we ordered sushi, sashimi, tempura and a bowl of noodles.\\n\\nThe fish was incredibly fresh and high quality. Our friends seemed happy enough with the tempura and noodles, but they weren't blown away by them.\\n\\nWhile everything was done really well - and we really enjoyed everything - we've had better sushi and Japanese food elsewhere.

The beef taco salad I had was edible, but had very little beef, LOTS of lettuce, and too much sour cream.  My dining partners barely touched their combo plates.  Their rellenos weren't cooked thoroughly, the cheese quesadilla was inedible, and the Mexican rice was similar to Uncle Ben's mix.  \\n\\nPrices?  Too high.  Would have enjoyed Taco Bell more, at a much lower cost.  \\n\\nThey serve chips and salsa when you sit down, but then additional (small) bowls of chips (and salsa) cost 75 cents each.  A small bowl of queso was $2.99.\\n\\nAnd then there was the service.  The service!  The gentleman who seated us selected--literally--the smallest booth in the restaurant to seat us in.  When we had to ask someone else (because he tossed down the menus and walked away before we even got to the table) for a different table, the host told us that it was, for real, the smallest in the place.  There were many larger booths available, so we weren't certain why we were given the small one to begin with. Limited availability of tables and chairs--mostly, the seating is booths.   \\n\\nThen came a procession of various people to each ask us what we wanted to drink, if we were ready to order, if we wanted more chips, etc.  Then we had multiple people ask us how we wanted our check split, and no one managed to split it the way we requested.  I don't have any experience in the service end of food service, but I think the system of dedicated server to a certain table works pretty well in other places.  This place should consider using that.  The confusion was concerning and annoying.  \\n\\nThere was a general lack of actual concern and engagement; everything was robotic and detached.

This jumps immediately to my top 5!  There were 5 of us that night; we sat at the lovely Harvest Table in the corner.  We ordered (and shared!) from all parts of the menus (including Happy Hour), & EVERYTHING was prepared to perfection.  My beef tenderloin was seasoned perfectly, served at a perfect medium rare.  The poached egg on my Farmer's Salad was delightfully oozy.  The scallops had a stunning sear, the jumbo shrimp were truly jumbo & the spicy seasoning was just right.  We also saw the shrimp served with cheesy grits - awesome.  The corned beef hash (with sweet potatoes!) was beautifully prepared and every flavor was accented.  Oh, and the warm goat cheese in a light, crispy tempura batter and drizzled with honey - amazing, I could eat that every day!!  And then to top it off, we ordered all 3 of the offered desserts; the mini ice cream sandwiches, the chocolate lava cake/brownie/whateveritwascalledyumminess, and the totally unique bread pudding.  The cookies on the ice cream sandwiches were almond flavored and salted, mixed with the creaminess of the ice cream - still smiling.  The smooth, moist, dark chocolate dessert paired so well with the red blend wine that I had with my dinner, and let me tell you about the bread pudding.  Very atypical; it was cut like a thick slice of bread, and was very light, not heavy and dense like most.  It had tart dried cherries and golden raisins throughout and topped with a perfecty gingery ginger sauce; everything melded with the accompanying vanilla ice cream was one of the best things I've had in a long time!\\n\\nOur server Adam was delightful, attentive and went above and beyond for us.  Emily, co-owner and wife of the chef-owner stopped by the table, and we had a chance to talk for a bit.  She and her husband have a long history in the food and hospitality business.  They are so excited to be in the area as she has family in Oviedo; her enthusiasm shows and you could see how appreciative she is of her customers.  She shared with us the brunch menu - I can't wait to go one weekend soon!\\n\\nThey have a small but lovely outdoor seating area, unfortunately it was just to hot that day for us to have sat outside, but I will return!

Overall I'd say the food is mostly overrated. I actually really do like the cold subs - it's the only local spot where you can just grab a turkey sub the way you want it. I've gotten the chicken parm dinner a couple times too and it was pretty good, certainly better than Agorros from a price to quality ratio.\\n\\nBut if you are going to Pino's, you are probably going for the pizza. Boston pizza has a well earned reputation for mediocrity and Pino's isn't really that different. The Sicilian pizza is really good though and has been my midnight go to in town for a while. I've also had an occasional good experience with their plain cheese pizzas, right out of the oven. But anything else always comes out disappointing. The now-defunct Real Deal had much better slices and if you want something other than cold subs and pizza you are better off going next door to Eagles. I also have had rude treatment on multiple occasions by staff - this might be one of those \\"part of the charm\\" type cultures but it has really rubbed me the wrong way before. My girlfriend was also harassed recently by another yelp reviewer for being too harsh despite leaving a pretty positive review, which made me feel that it was time to post an honest review myself.\\n\\nTLDR: Get the Sicilian pizza, you can't go wrong here.

I've been eating here for 10 years and loving it, but in December 2010 and January 2011, both times I stopped in, the brisket was tough and the ribs were dried out. Maybe it was because it was the holidays, but in my opinion, if you are going to sell something with your name attached to it, it should be the best you can make and if the brisket and ribs that I had last couple of  times I was there were the best they can do any more, then I'll go elsewhere.  With the volume of people who go to the Salt Lick, perhaps they have become more concerned with getting the meat out as soon as they can so they don't lose customers.  If that's the case, then they'll lose more customers for poorly prepared food than for having to wait for 45 minutes.  Having to wait for something as good as Salt Lick used to be was worth it and most people are still willing to stand in line for good food.

It was perfect timing to celebrate an anniversary too. \\n\\nFor the appetizer we got the seafood sausage. It was delicate and tasty. Everything was ground up like sausage. The bartender highly recommended it. \\n\\nI chose in advance to get the $39 pre-fixed menu. The selection that night was a pate, which I have had there before and was delicious. Along with that I got the roasted chicken. The chicken was amazing. The best I ever had. Super juicy with so much flavor. My boyfriend got the pork three ways entree which he gobbled down.  For $36 he was a bit disappointed with the small amount on the plate, after it it was just pork so why so skimpy? It was a good thing I had enough chicken cause he shared the rest to feel full. One thing I wish this place would do is add a bit more to your entree or beef up the size of what you get, both times I found one of the entrees to be very skimpy for the hefty price. The tasting menus look substantial but are in the $75-$95 range per person. I really thought the food was great, however there really should be a veggie or starch on the plate to balance it out when you are already paying $36 for your entree. \\n\\nFor dessert we had a berry cobbler. Again it was delicious and just a great way to end the meal. \\n\\nDrinks were poured creatively. Everything is carefully measured out and quickly replenished. Service at the bar was friendly, almost interactive as you watched them make some cool drinks, dropping potions here and there. It reminded me of Drink a little bit. \\n\\nThe food is very tasty and the place has the right customer service attitude. Clearly there are some very well trained chefs in there. For the steep prices though and tiny portions, I probably won't rush back."},{"name":"Szechuan Kitchen","address":"15450 Boones Ferry Rd, Ste 5","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3","text":"In our opinion, the best Chinese food in Lake Oswego.

I was surprised to learn that the $2 delivery fee increased by $1 after 3 miles (my house was just 3.1 miles form restaurant). When food arrived one hour later one of the entrees was missing (they had put two appetizers in- so maybe switched with another order or not recorded correctly when called originally?). Usually I wouldn't make a big fuss if an order wasn't exactly as I requested, but we were missing an entire meal.  When I called back the restaurant the woman immediately recognized that she had made an error (which was refreshing), but was not very apologetic. She said she would send another order on its way. 45 minutes later I called to get an ETA. You would think that the order would get priority. ONE HOUR LATER we received our corrected order; that is TWO HOURS after our original order. By that time the dish that was delivered correctly was already cold and soggy. The delivery man, although I recognize it was not his fault, did not apologize. On the corrected dish there was a bill stapled, which showed the total charges for our order.  I was SHOCKED that nothing was deducted from the bill- not even the $3 delivery fee or the dish that was incorrect. The food was OK but just OK.

Frozen, pre-breaded, planks of dryness.  A freshly breaded and cooked chicken finger is about the easiest thing you can do in a kitchen... there's no excuse for this.  If you guys read your reviews... please for the love of god, 86 these things.\\n\\nNachos:  A mess on a plate covered in processed cheese sauce.  Now, I'm a fan of the occasional cheese sauce indulgence, but this was just a mess of shredded iceberg lettuce, gloppy cheese sauce, and assorted other things thrown on.\\n\\nPhilly Tacos:  A few pieces of overcooked philly meat that seemed to be pre-seasoned/cooked/frozen... folded into a much larger rubbery flour tortilla with a slice of cheese.\\n\\nOkra:  Standard frozen breaded okra that was re-fried.  Cafeteria comes to mind again.\\n\\nJalepeno Poppers:  Frozen and out of box again... sitting in a pool of sweet sauce with a baffling amount of iceberg lettuce.\\n\\nOnion Rings:  The menu leads you to believe these are beer battered in house.  Now, I could be wrong but I'd say these were also frozen.  I've had more than my fair share of onion rings, and usually hand battered are easy to spot.\\n\\nFish Platter:  My girlfriend has this and said it wasn't bad... definitely better than all of the other selections we'd had so far.\\n\\nHamburger:  We've had the lunch version and the dinner version.  They weren't bad.  Nothing extraordinary, but a solid burger never the less.\\n\\nNow, maybe we just hit the entire part of the menu that wasn't the freshly prepared part, but it's been enough to discourage us from trying the rest of the menu.

A wondrous indigenous wood interior decor feels very homey! Outside has the feel of an enclosed county fair with live entertainment. There is also a vineyard with quiet sitting areas aligned with bleached pebble trails wrapped in lavender wild flowers and neo-classical old west motif. It is a very busy place, it has many patrons. And those cars maybe there because of what I described from the outset and decided to enjoy a meal. Why travel to Austin or Lockhart for BBQ when the Hill Country has this? \\n\\nFor advanced palates this falls short on quality. The food is eatable, but not memorable. We've been spoiled by certain other places and dare any of those fans of the Salt Lick to read up on which names keep on coming up in top ten Texas BBQ.\\n\\nWhen the clean and proper wait staff suggested to me to try the BBQ sauce with the brisket, I should have politely asked for the check. Expertly prepared Brisket does not need any dressing. Your hands should only wield utensils and then give up on them because it is finger, not forking, licking good! \\n\\nI was sold a $12 beef rib with meat on both sides of the bone, I had to ask my wife, if perhaps,  I had the more diminutive pork rib. I've had beef ribs before with meat on both sides of the bone and on the north and south sides as well. Something beautiful and massive. In all fairness, other places will weigh out certain beef gargantuans, this cut may have been cut to a certain size standard. But not impressed and still had some appetite, so I ordered 1/2 a pound of moist brisket. It shows up and it looked in the advanced state of disintegration. It look like over cooked macaroni. Despite its condition, it had a stringy bland consistency when it hit the palate. I anticipated a just right detonation of perfectly timed, natural fatty salty goodness to explode , but slice after slice, it never arrived. I didn't finish it. \\n\\nMy wife had the sausage and it left her with the impression of store bought quality with not the slightest attention to in house high quality that can be a staple in any BBQ joint. \\n\\nPerhaps I was supposed to add this more than likely proprietary sauce, I never even gazed at it, but if it's the sauce then just sell sauce. \\n\\nThe overhead seems more a concern than focusing on making memorable food.

The waiter was condescending and downright rude. I ordered us some samosas to start ($4 for two). Immediately he told me that he usually recommends the shrimp ($10) or the mussels ($7), because the samosas are too filling. What the hell? I realize that both of these might be delicious but it was a really awkward way to upsell. I said thanks but we'll stick with the samosas and he was actually sort of huffy about it and started to argue with me! I assured him that I knew what I was ordering (have lived in India for several years) and that was what we wanted. \\n\\nWhen the samosas got there they were actually a lot smaller than normal samosas that you get on the street, and oddly rounded (delicious though). He also tried to pretend like he knew everything about Malwani food but he clearly didn't actually know that much, like when I asked if they wada came with yogurt (classic dahi wada) he got very flustered and told me no. I ordered a Limca and they were out, which wasn't really anyone's fault but a major bummer. Aside from that, we had the Mumbai-style biryani with lamb (mmm!) and the Gomantak coconut fish curry, both of which were stupendous. However, when I went to order our entrees, I was told \\"you should order from this side of the menu, not that side of the menu,\\" and that I should order the sea bass instead of the tilapia in my curry. Maybe so, but I'm a girl on a budget and I don't appreciate the pushiness. Plus I had tried to politely hint that I have spent a lot of time in India, that I know Indian food pretty well, and I can make up my own mind about what to order, but it was like that only made him more combative. It was weird. \\n\\nFinally he asked me how spicy I wanted my food. I said Indian hot, and he basically told me I wouldn't be able to handle it, which was really irritating. I know it's good policy to warn customers, but when someone is telling you that's what they want then seriously, give it to them. It's not your job as a waiter to second-guess every single thing the customer orders. When we asked for a to go box for the leftover biryani he basically threw it down on the table without a word. \\n\\nI would like to point out that someone else actually brought out our food, I believe the owner, and he was really great. Attentive without being pushy and seemed really passionate about the food and making sure we had a good experience. It was just this other guy. I also heard the rude waiter's interaction with the people at the next table. They had had a child with them, and the child's food had been too spicy, while the dad's food had been not spicy enough. They mentioned this to the waiter, very politely, and he rather snottily told them that the spice level wasn't consistent because it was homestyle food, and if you wanted consistency \\"don't come here, eat something from a can.\\" It's my understanding that a good home cook of any cuisine is able to regulate the spice level of their food.\\n\\nNew India has great food and I would love to see this unique restaurant flourish, but the service was so unpleasant I'm reluctant to go back. What a shame!"},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to dinner here on New Years Eve so I gave them a little leeway with this review.\\n\\nThe four of us arrived for our 10:30 reservation a few minutes early and we were seated right away at a good sized booth. It was very busy and it seemed that they pushed the booths back closer to the doors to make more room for smaller tables which would have been fine except I almost got hit in the head with trays full of glasses several times due to the servers having to squeeze in between the hostess area and our booth. \\n\\nIt took a little while for our waiter to come to our table and when he did we asked him for a wine list since we weren't given one. After another little while he came back with the wine list and quickly hurried away. When he came back I asked him if he had a certain bourbon which he wasn't sure of and when I was about to ask him for a Manhattan made with a more common bourbon (so that we could finally get some drinks at the table) he rushed off once again to get an alcohol list. When he came back once again we ordered our drinks and quickly got them. This all took about 25 minutes. \\n\\nWe ordered our food soon after we got drinks and my friend and her boyfriend got their appetizer quickly. It was a crab salad and it wasn't anything special, and it was very expensive and small. We received our entrees and the portions were surprisingly small for the price, especially my boyfriends tortellini. I got the brick chicken which was good, the broccoli rabe I could make at home 10X better, but the loose polenta was delicious. My friend and her boyfriend got their remaining meals wrapped up by our server when I was still working on mine. A busser came by our table a little later and asked if I wanted the rest of my meal wrapped up and I said yes........ and he never came back with it. The same busser filled up my water glass earlier in the night by picking it up with his finger tips on the rim. A big no-no in the service industry, especially nice places like this one. Also, when it came time to pay the bill we took the time to separate the items on the check so that each couple would pay for what they got, but the waiter claimed that he could only split the check right down the middle. I know that it is possible to separate items onto separate checks even with old POS systems so either he was being lazy or doesn't know how to use the system.  \\n\\nOne nice part about the night was that they handed out party hats and noise makers and glasses of champagne to everyone before midnight and you could see the fireworks on the harbor out the window. Overall, I wish we had stayed in and gotten pizza and saved 200 dollars, but it was a good experience.

The inside is very small (3 small tables, about 8 seats total) and is primarily a take-out/delivery shop. The staff person was very friendly and waited on us at one of the tables. I ordered the green curry chicken, a lunch special served with white rice, a crab rangoon, and a spring roll for about $7.95. My friend ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. I requested that the green curry be made medium spicy to spare me any overwhelming spiciness and it turned out to be a perfect level of spiciness. I was really impressed by the authenticity of the green curry dish. It had bold, but balanced flavor and reminded me of small, family restaurants I visited while traveling through southern Thailand. My only complaint would be that the green curry was slightly greasy and the crab rangoon was empty. I sampled my friend's pad thai, which was one of the best pad thai I've ever tried and I would probably order this for take-out next time.

Another friend of mine went with the pumpkin ravioli and the final friend I was with had a seafood pasta.\\n\\nThe chicken marsala was bad.  Very bad.  Everything from the presentation to the taste missed.  I thought the pasta was bland, and seemed akin to a pile of wet noodles.

The dishes that my friends ordered were very good, however.

My mother who usually is describing what and how much seasoning the meals are missing when we dine out was impressed with the flavor of her food. We started with the bang, bang shrimp, the ceviche, and calamari for appetizers. They were all excellent. The calamari sauce had the perfect kick to it. The fish in the ceviche was lightly cooked and it had the perfect amount of lime. They also served a small loaf of bread with olive oil and pesto that was fresh and very tasty. \\n\\nFor entrees some of us had the imperial tilapia. The menu describes it well but is a combinations of fish, shrimp, and scallops with two sides. Whatever entree you get you must try the whipped garlic potatoes.

If you do not like fish you can try the chicken teriyaki. Someone else in my party had it and enjoyed it. Better yet, you can try their imperial tilapia and you may like fish again. \\n\\nDessert portions are big. My favorites were the key lime pie ( cheesecake like) and the coconut dessert with rum.

And they did an absolutely terrible job handling that.  \\n\\nSo lets start at the beginning, when I originally made the reservation on open table we had 16 people (unconfirmed) but I wanted to be sure we had a table just in case all 16 came. There was NOTHING on the website about a $100 deposit for 10 or more people; so when the restaurant called I explained that I needed an hour or so before I could call him back and let him know about our reservation. Don't worry, they cancelled my reservation 15 minutes later. I was FURIOUS! I had my friend call back, since it was her birthday and she had the number of people coming, they waived the fee for her.\\n\\nWe got there, and like other reviews say, the valet is tiny and the building is lackluster in appearance. I drive a small SUV and felt that it was going to get scratched just pulling up to the valet. We were seated pretty quickly, so no complaints there. We were seated all the way to the bottom of the building.\\n\\nWe received our food pretty quickly, and honestly for the price it was just OK. As we were finishing up our meal, one of the gentlemen in our party went to drink his water and low and behold there is a ROACH floating in it. Instead of causing a scene as that section of the restaurant was full, we called our waiter over (I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but he had a mohawk that was braided) and showed him the glass with the roach. They took it away and brought him a new glass of water, but at that point, none of us wanted to continue eating or drinking. Too bad none of us took a photo of it (I think due to shock), otherwise I would have posted it as well. \\n\\nWe asked for a manager but apparently at 9pm on a Saturday night there wasn't a manager or supervisor available to speak with. Birthday girl then asked for something off our bill, the waiter came back and comped her meal and 10% off the rest of the bill and offered her a free desert!  We were FURIOUS! We had a ROACH in our water, possibly in our food that we had just eaten and we are given 10% off!!! No way were we about to eat anything else. Needless to say, she argued with him but it went nowhere. His excuse was that they \\"were an old building.\\" That is completely unacceptable, old building or not!\\n\\nSo we payed our $200+ bill and went to leave. Don't worry our waiter came outside as we were waiting for our vehicles and asked us why we didn't tip him the typical 20%? Are you kidding me!?! We had a ROACH in and around our food! \\n\\nWe will never go back there, server was terrible at handling the situation and overall just a bad, bad experience."},{"name":"Anchan House of Thai Food","address":"373 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was fresh and delicious.

Not even in NYC (yet). \\n\\nSomehow, sadly, Indian food has become synonymous with North Indian cuisine. Sometimes South Indian cuisine. That is so unfair to the wide platter of Indian delicacies. This restaurant goes and changes that around. They serve Konkani cuisine, which is such a refreshing change from all the mainstream, run of the mill cuisines served in the name of Indian food everywhere else. \\n\\nThe restaurant has a eclectic vibe what with it being done in a fishermen decor! It reminded me of a seaside bar, especially with the BYOB they have going. AWE. \\n\\nThe food. Oh God. I don't know how to stress more to say it was DELICIOUS! The tastiest food I've had in a while and that I know I'll have in a while.

Since Potter is split between two parks and joined by the Hogwarts Express, I have to give my vote to the combination of parks as the world's best theme park.\\n\\nAlthough Islands of Adventure is though of as the more thrill ride oriented park, there are actually more impressive (non-rollercoaster) rides at Universal Studios. Islands has more secluded nooks and crannies for relaxing, and is a more leisurely place to hang out.\\n\\nMany of the parks rides are simulators, some on vehicles, many with 3D glasses. This gets a bit repetitive, so you may want to aim for the best, which are Spiderman (world's best theme park ride) and Gringott's (not as good show quality, but an exciting vehicle).\\n\\nSimpsons is a very funny ride, particularly if you are in the theme park business like I am, because of all the inside jokes.\\n\\nThe spinning on Men In Black was a bit sickening, so I wouldn't go on that again. Mummy has some nice fire effects, but doesn't come across as scary.\\n\\nHulk is a much smoother coaster than Rip Ride and Rocket, and has seven inversions. The other coasters are also-rans.\\n\\nClearly the knockout area is Diagon Alley, with Wizarding World a close second, but the best ride is Spiderman.

Ten minutes after they were served, the main entrees arrived at the table, and we all gasped in awe. The portions of the Zuppa di pesce are huge! And there's a decent amount of seafood (lobster, scallops, shrimp, calamari, mussels) on top the pasta, which is good.

The restaurant is in the old Boston city hall which gives it a lot of charm.  The service is always great.  The price is definitely high but it is worth it for a special  occasion.  \\n\\nI've ordered the Ruth classic special which is around $52 a person and you get (1) a choice of a salad (2) choice of steak, veal or fish (they list the options that come with this special) (3) choice of a side and (4) a dessert.  I would definitely recommend the Caesar salad.  They use fresh shaved parmesan and it is very tasty.  I've only ever ordered the filet and they always cook it to perfection.  All the steaks come out in some type of butter sauce or at least it is on the plate and it just adds extra flavor to the steak.  In terms of sides I've had the hash browns (very good), mashed potatoes (good), creamed spinach (very good), and Brussels sprouts (very good).  The dessert that comes with this special is a standard chocolate cake but still very tasty.  You can upgrade to another dessert and if you do I would recommend the apple crumb tart.  The drinks are also great.  I always ordered a Moscow mule here.  \\n\\nOverall I really love it here and would definitely recommend it."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Don't understand the hype behind this place's chartreuses. They seem very over-expensive for the amount that you get and some of the flavors don't really work that well together. We got the salty pig board, the cured board and the farmstead. The worst was the farmstead as it had very strong almost sour tasting cheeses. The best food there was the pizzas. We got the salty pig pizza and the funghi pizza. The funghi was the best tasting as it had strong individual flavors that melded beautifully together. I realize that I'm biased since I'm not a fan of cured meats but they should really go back to the drawing board and find flavors that really compliment one another rather than fight one another for attention. The staff was also very inattentive, we had to keep calling and waiting to get help. They also seemed very stingy with the bread, we were a very large group but they kept giving one basket at a time which wouldn't even be enough for each of us to get a piece.

I get that it's probably because of their client base. To give an idea of what I mean- there were at least 3 bachelorette parties the night I was there. I was expecting a dive and got faux-classy, so there's that.\\n\\n-Drinks are expensive, sure, but what I expect to pay in Boston, and what I expect to pay for a good tiki beverage.

My wife and I went here early for dinner on cold Saturday night in January. Being a vegetarian, she was very excited to have oh so many options to chose from on their menu.\\n\\nWe started with the Sesame Encrusted Seitan strips which were okay, but nothing special.  I wouldn't get them again.  There was certainly no sesame encrusting.  It was simply some chunks of Sietan served in a sauce with some sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  Not off to a good start. For dinner I had the Sweet Potato quesadilla and my wife had the Millet Loaf.  Both were tasty and big enough to leave us with leftovers for lunch the next day. \\n\\nService was spotty.  We were there early and got a table without waiting, though the place filled up pretty quickly.  We were seated for a solid 10 minutes before we were seen by a waitress. Behind us, the chef was working on his laptop, preparing what appeared to be a list of specials that we were never told of. Once we ordered service was much better, though for vegetarian food it did take quite a while to prepare.\\n\\nThe real problem with the place was the heat -- or rather -- the lack thereof.  It wasn't an especially frigid day for the season, but the place was just cold. About 1/2 of the customers were eating with their winter coats on.  We were lucky enough to be seated in the back, near the kitchen. The folks sitting near the door were seen shivering any time anyone walked in or out. There were two heaters mounted in the corners, though they didn't appear to be particularly helpful.  There was a space heater in the hallway by the bathrooms which was set to a blistering 64 degrees.  It was evident they had recently tried to do some weatherproofing, as there were areas around the windows where excess spray foam insulation could be seen. I'd suggest that they either find a more suitable location or have the windows replaced and add a double-doored entry way to avoid freezing out customers. It's not often you see people at a sit-down, full-service restaurant eating with winter coats on.\\n\\nThe entrees saved this place from a two star review and were good enough that we'll probably give this place another shot.

My boyfriend could not resist the $1 Fenway Frank, I mean who can for a $1?

Just a question for momma..who are you and can you adopt me?  Your cheese dip is so tasty I just want to put it on anything and everything!!  I even convinced the boyfriend to put some on his hot dog which gave he a very big grin after taking some big bites into this new discovery.  The Makin Cheese looked oh so tasty but when you could add BBQ chicken and blue cheese as well to this American classic I say HELLS YES!  The spicy, tangyness was like nothing I had ever had and yet I had to keep eating it!  I am a person who like a light spice and can only handle about that, but although this caused my mouth to burn and my lips to tingle I kept shoveling it in bite after bite.

And, having grown up in a 1/2 Italian (Napoli region) and 1/2 Sicilian family, I'm a picky eater of pasta and Italian sauces.  So, finally, after a quarter century of wandering wonderingly past the 'round-the-corner lines that I'd see snaking out of Giacomo's every time I'd go to the North End for dinner, I've at long last sucked it up, and took my spot in line.  My family of four waited 40 minutes before opening, and fortunately managed (barely) to make the first seating of the night.  The restaurant seats about 35, elbow to elbow and knee to knee in small, wooden upright chairs.  It's tight.  Since there's no A/C, go only on cool evenings ... and be prepared for loud conversation and brisk (and brusque) service.  We didn't mind; we were there not to relax, but to see what the fuss is about.  I think it has to do with (1) value prices, by North End standards, (2) decent variety of mix-and-match sauces, pastas and proteins -- leaning more to seafood and chickens, with little if any beef or pork options and (3) tasty sauces.  Here's what we got, all of them recommended: CHICK PARM W/ LINGUINE IN RED SAUCE-a staple, well-executed with a very good base red sauce; SQUASH RAVS W/ PROSCIUTTO/MARSCARPONE SAUCE W/ ASPARAGUS-delicious, if you don't mind a sweeter-than-savory entr√©e; LOBSTER RAVS IN GIACOMO HOUSE SAUCE-red sauce with lobster bits is solid if unexceptional; ZITI W/ CHICK BROCC IN GARLIC CREAM SAUCE-they don't do an alfredo or carbonara(!), but the garlic cream is a well made replacement that is not too garlicky.  MY TWO COMPLAINTS AND A WARNING  #1) pre-powdered parmesan cheese!?!? Shame on you!

Within a few minutes, she came back out and asked for the next party of 2, which was us. We were seated and the restaurant is tiny. You are close to the other tables. We ordered calamari for the appetizer. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli and I ordered the shrimp/scallops over linguine with the fra diavolo sauce. We barely finished the calamari when the main dishes arrived. The calamari was fantastic, but the main dishes were even better! I haven't had good Italian in a long time, but I was blown away! The linguine was cooked just right, the shrimp and scallops were so juicy and tasteful, and the fra diavolo was drop dead delicious! I loved the spicy kick it had. My wife loved her lobster ravioli, I tried some as well and it was indeed fantastic. We quickly inhaled our food and were done within 30 minutes. The line kept growing, so we left without loitering too long as others were waiting. I think I paid about $55 with tip and it was absolutely spectacular.

It's a very open bar; inviting and spacy.  It seems to be a place with great promise however my experience this day was very lackluster.  I came in with two guy friends.  My friends may have known the bartender because she was very interested in helping them.  Their orders were placed and somehow I was never asked if I needed anything.  Being in the service industry, I imagined it was commonplace that you check with the ladies first.  I waited patiently but this never happened.  Not only was an inquisition not made, I was never helped.  Of my party of three, I actually had the largest order.  So what to do in this case?  Go help yourself.  Mind you, it was not one, but two separate bartenders (one female, one male) that tended to everything else but a customer waiting.  I flagged down another bartender and placed my order.  \\n\\nThankfully, this bartender was Dogwood Rock Rose's saving grace.  She was very cordial and made sure there wasn't more that was needed.  I wish I would have gotten the names of all bartenders; two would be on blast and the last would be applauded.  \\n\\nManagement, you want your employees to create an environment of geniality.

There only seemed to be 3 or 4 tables with them, and while watching over 2 hours, did not see anyone actually use them.\\n\\nThe TV screens were a little small in the dining areas, almost like they were an afterthought.  The massive ticker running across the bar probably looked really cool in the designer plans, but it's distracting.  When we were there it was running headlines like \\"Young Female Singers hope for good 2008\\" and a bunch of hockey scores for games that were happening the next day.  I think it would have been better to flip the ticker and the TV screens and then made the screens bigger.\\n\\nThe waitstaff kept up with the packed house as best they could, though their uniforms of Adidas warm-up tops and Cargo pants were a little to \\"trendy\\"\\n\\nThe food was better than most sports bars, the wings are decent.

I had meant to eat here a million times before but for whatever reason, that never happened. After reading several reviews here, I was very torn about what to order for my meal. When I checked in with the Yelp app, I received a Free Appetitizer....which were the pierogies.  I was offered to have them pan-fried or boiled.  No choice there!  I got them pan-fried of course!  The Hubster & I were served 4 small little pierogies, filled with the creamiest mashed potatoes that you could ever imagine, along with a (unneeded) dollop of sour cream.  Those pierogies were perfect!  The perfect amount of brownness & crispness!  Loved them!  So many people here on Yelp said how good the kielbasa is here....I'm not a huge fan of kielbasa but....I listened & ordered 1 of the combination plates. I wanted to get a taste of several items.  On my combination plate:  I got the most perfectly-sized piece of kielbasa.  You can order it smoked or regular. Per the waitress's recommendation, I chose the regular.  It was absolutely delectable!  It was moist, not dry, not overly flavorful yet, perfectly flavored.  I also got 2 more of the small pierogies, REAL!!!!!! sauerkraut, which was not like any sauerkraut that I have EVER tasted in my life! It had a very slight vinegar taste but no bitterness at all!  It actually looked like hashed browns when served to me.  My last item on my plate was my lucious stuffed cabbage.  Oh my!  Again, I was offered a choice of tomato sauce or mushroom sauce over the stuffed cabbage.  I went with the mushroom.  That sauce was perfect!  It had the perfect consistancy & was very flavorful.  The cabbage had some sort of meat in it which I believe was beef, but it was very pink, so I'm unsure.  I should have asked!  There was also rice in the stuffing.  We were also served several pieces of Challah, which is a Jewish bread used for their Sabbath.  Again, the Challah was yummy.  Probably some of the best I have ever tasted!  I don't usually order dessert when I go out to eat, but I wanted to here.  I chose the apple streusel with vanilla ice cream.  I asked for it to be served to me warm, which it was.  Of everything that I ate here, the apple streusel was my least favorite.  Thank goodness I ordered the ice cream on top!  It was a very bland tasting streusel & I wish I hadn't bothered!  My very favorite things that I ate there were the pierogies & the kielbasa.  My waitress was friendly & efficient but she never told us her name & I forgot to ask!  And yes, the surroundings are rather bland inside.  I'm glad I was forewarned.  Some carpet would help to warm up the atmosphere a bit.

There were two waiters who were bored and watching us from the back of the restaurant with  a laugh here and there pointing at us- creepy ?  There were no less than 6 waiters out in the hall hanging out, chatting loudly and laughing and imitating the patrons who walked by  to use the restroom- it was appalling!  They had nothing to do because the restaurant was empty and instead of  being helpful and appropriate, they just kept loitering around our table (we finished and left by 10 p.m.- way before the restaurant closed) and asking us \\"Are you finished? May I clear the plate?\\" \\n They were rude, inconsiderate and quite frankly very bad waiters who mispronounced most everything on the menu, sad.

If you talk smack about Stone Soup Kitchen (Stone Sizzle, as we call it), i will punch you in the neck twice.\\n\\nThis is not a fru-fru (sp?) restaurant.  You can get veggie options (and lunch is great too) but if you don't like their cheese grits you can be certain that it's YOU that has malfunctioned and most certainly not SSK.  Do yourself a favor and never look at the menu if you're there on the weekend.  All you need is the little specials list on the table.\\n\\nMy faves?  I rock the Cowboy or Gringo scramblers from the special menu.  Theres nothing like ham, peppers, cheese, and eggs all intermingled and yummy.  You have a choice of potatoes or grits but always go with the cheese grits.  Personally, i sub an English muffin for toast and dump like 30 pounds of orange marmalade on that beast.  Scrumptious.\\n\\nFrom the regular menu: The burrito and huevos rancheros are great - my fiance loves \\"the usual\\" (although i suspect it's partly because she just likes to say \\"i'll have the usual\\" as if it means something).  In fact, at this point, it does.  Also check for occasional daily specials like the heavenly blueberry yogurt pancakes.  If you need lunch, grab a Lil's Favorite with Turkey and some chips or soup.  It won't disappoint (but they close at 3:00 so beat the buzzer).\\n\\nOne surprisingly lesser known gem is the patio out back.  If it's nice (and the sun hasn't gotten too high) ask to be seated outside.  There's actually parking back there that is equally less known.  You can even bring your pup if yours knows how to behave.  I will punch you in the neck 3 times if you come there with a rowdy mongrel.\\n\\nAnyway, SSK is terribly consistent.  I have eaten dozens of times - even  consecutive Sat/Sun breakfasts (more often than i'd like to admit) and i have never had a bad experience.  If yours is bad, ask for Jason, and he'll make it right.  There absolutely no excuse to walk away from SSK feeling let down.  Hell, i practically tithe the place i'm there so much.  It's my church.  And i keep it holy.\\n\\nIt's just breakfast people...but the cheese grits are so good i feel like I'm cheating if i eat grits anywhere else.  Give it a shot.  Seriously.

We dined in the traditional dining room as opposed to the hibachi grill side.  I've always eaten in the traditional dining room here.  This is the main dining area in front of the sushi bar.  There is a small \\"lounge\\" with comfy couches and chairs where you can wait for your party to arrive.  This is separated from the main dining area by Asian folding screens.\\n\\nOn this visit, I tried:\\nJalapeno roll - salmon, yellow tail, cucumber, avocado, aioli, and jalapeno\\nSoba noodles (buckwheat, cold)\\nTempura moriawase - deluxe assorted tempura\\nShokado gozen - five seasonal chef's choice items served in a shokado box set\\n\\nThe jalapeno roll was a special roll not on the standard menu.  Each piece was plump and featured a slice of fresh jalapeno on top.  Very interesting flavor combination and I thought it worked well.  I don't like sauces on my sushi, so I thought this roll would have tasted better without the aioli.\\n\\nFor my soba noodles, I was given a choice of whether I wanted traditional buckwheat soba or green tea soba.  I was also given the choice of hot or cold.  Soba is a good, basic Japanese dish.  I found the soba at Nakato to be okay.  The noodles were a bit more heavy and dense than what I'm used to, but it still tasted good with the dipping sauce, wasabi, seaweed, and scallions.\\n\\nI'm not huge on tempura, but I did try some of my friends' tempura moriawase entrees.  These are $20 plates of each type of tempura you can imagine (meats and vegetables).  Very good, light batter, and not too greasy.  Nakato makes some good tempura.\\n\\nFinally, the shokado gozen stole the show in both presentation and taste.  The meal was served in a \\"shokado box set,\\" which is pretty much like a bento box, except there was a separate upper and lower portion.  The top portion consisted of crab and seaweed salad, sunomono (a vinaigrette dish - a variety of pickled vegetables), chawanmushi (Japanese egg custard served in a tea cup), and Japanese slow-cooked pork.  The bottom portion contained an assortment of tempura (shrimp, scallops, broccoli, etc.), a sashimi platter (maguro - tuna, sake - salmon, and toro - fatty tuna), and fruit (small sliced orange).  The shokado came with a bowl of steamed rice and miso soup.\\n\\nThe shokado gozen had a good variety of foods with different styles of cooking: raw/cooked, hot/cold, meats/fruits/vegetables, etc.  I found the overall quality of the entree to be fresh, appetizing, and high quality.  I think the chefs could have chosen more interesting fish for the sashimi portion and maybe another dish to sub in for the slow-cooked pork.  That was the first time I tried chawanmushi.  At first, I thought it was soup.\\n\\nThe food came out a little slow because the restaurant was very busy.

Then this is the place for you.\\n\\nI'd been going to the South End Flour for years before moving away, but when I moved back to Boston I had also been diagnosed with celiac - very sad for a carb loving Italian like me.  So I was STOKED to see that Flour had gluten free options.  It goes way beyond that, though.\\n\\nWhen you order your sandwich, you can ask for gluten free bread, and then - here's the golden part - the staff will ask you if it's a preference or an allergy.  This is huge, people.  This gives you the chance to confirm that you have a real health reason for asking for GF bread (yes, technically celiac isn't an allergy, but the point is that you're being taken seriously on the health front!) which then shows up on the order slip in red as ALLERGY.  The folks making sandwiches will then change their gloves and everything else related to your sandwich to ensure it stays uncontaminated.  AND: they make their own amazingly good GF focaccia - huge plus, since most places that offer GF just throw your sandwich on two slices of Udi's, not great.  Though your sandwich is two bucks more, it's also larger than the regular bread sandwiches (rare for GF items), so you can easily cut it in half and get two lunches out of it.  I get the hummus sandwich and it's amazing.\\n\\nYes, the lines can be long and the place can be crazy crowded (easy fix: come for your sandwich at 11 AM or 1:30 PM if you can, when it's super quick!), but the fact that I can eat a tremendously good sandwich from a place literally called \\"flour\\" with celiac disease and never once get sick is completely worth coming back here again and again.  The staff is always nice even when it's super busy, and working as quickly as they can.\\n\\nPeople who have to eat gluten free for health reasons aren't trying to give restaurants a hard time.  We just want to eat good food with the peace of mind that we won't get sick, and have plenty of options.  That's what makes Flour so awesome - no hassle, no annoying questions, they take you seriously, and you can get any of their delicious sandwiches (except for the grilled ones) made gluten free.  WIN.\\n\\nNote for those who can eat gluten: get a brownie.  No really.  I have flashbacks to those brownies from my gluten days and they are truly the best I've ever had.

Do I talk about how I ate my entire body weight in delicious, fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth tender barbeque? Do I talk about how beautiful the property is, with its picturesque gardens and gazebos? Do I talk about how awesome it was to be able to have my first Salt Lick experience be as part of a private event so it felt like we got the celebrity treatment?\\n\\nWhere does one even begin?\\n\\nWell, I guess I'll start by saying the obvious: the Salt Lick is AWESOME. My fiance has LITERALLY been telling me about this place since we started dating (he's from San Antonio originally), and when I found out that it was the location of his cousin's rehearsal dinner, I am pretty sure I squealed out loud. After all, this joint is famous!\\n\\nSome things to note: this place is cash-only, and it is also BYOB. They do have a shop where you can buy beer, as well as an on-site winery now, so I guess they've adapted to you being able to buy alcohol on-site, but I think you can also still bring your own if you like.\\n\\nI can't really speak to the long lines or the process of getting your food as a regular diner, since as mentioned, I was here as part of a private event. But I can say that this is an AWESOME place to have a private party! The staff was super accomodating, kept the food flowing, and the whole place just has a really great, low-key vibe. They didn't seem to mind when we all flocked to the smoking pit to take photos either, hehe.\\n\\nOkay, but onto the most important part: the FOOD. I got to try a little bit of everything, and here are my very detailed, very articular thoughts:\\n\\nBrisket: mmmmmmm.\\nChicken: mmmmmmm.\\nPork ribs: mmmmmmm.\\nSausage: mmm-mmmm! (This was surprisingly my favorite!)\\nPotato salad: mmmmm.\\nBeans: mmmmmm.\\nCole slaw: mmmm! (Not mayonaissey, very refreshing!)\\nHousemade pickles: mmmmmm.\\nPeach/blackberry cobbler for dessert: mmmmmmmm!\\n\\nIn case that \\"mmmm\\" is the sound of my mouth being too full of deliciousness to talk. It was all SO good! The ONE thing I didn't try was the bread, because, hello, why waste stomach space on bread when there is more MEAT to be had?\\n\\nAnyway, obviously The Salt Lick is going to become a must-visit destination anytime I'm even close to the Austin or San Antonio area. Although, the bad side of this all is that I'm pretty sure that no BBQ in the DC/Northern VA area is even going to come CLOSE to this again.

We were quickly brought water, warm not-oily chips and fresh salsa. Great start.\\n\\nI asked for a Michelada (spicy beer margarita). I'm Hispanic and although I'm not Mexican, micheladas are part of my culture and I've been having them for about 11 years or so. This was the best Michelada I've had, in the Boston area. Just the right amount of salt, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce. The \\"right\\" beer is Corona. My friend had a cucumber martini, great flavor and the vodka was generously poured but, there was almost half an inch short, of liquor, to the edge of the glass.\\n\\nWe both, started out with Aguacate relleno de ensalada de camaron. This is a salad with 2 halves avocados filled with a shrimp salad made with fresh tomato, cilantro, red bell pepper and a very light mayonnaise, garnished with Mesclun. DELICIOUS. The flavors blend so well together and there is the right amount of shrimp and vegetables in the salad.\\n\\nThen we ordered Sopes surtidos - These are three small tortillas topped with Mexican chorizo (sausage) and potato (This was my favorite of the three sopes), Mexican style chicken (chicken mole-ish type of flavor) and a cactus salad one. I was happily surprised because none of these were greasy. They were perfectly seasoned and we enjoyed every bite.\\n\\nWe had ordered Ceviche but, unfortunately they had ran out so, we ordered Queso Fundido con chorizo. The cheese and chorizo were delicious. The sauce on top is amazing. Again, not greay (for a chorizo).\\n\\nThe only reason I give this place 4 stars is because although the food was great, it is a bit overpriced. Considering they have a small menu with similar ingredients, I can see the prices being lower and the business wouldn't hurt.\\n\\nAlso, if you are vegetarian, I wouldn't recommend you to go to Acitron.

The owner has got to be one of the nicest people you would ever meet. Some folks in the restaurant needed help to give directions to someone who was coming to pick them up. They were going nowhere .. So they asked the owner to take the phone and give directions. The owner tried but the guy on the other end didn't seem to get it. So the owner asked the guy to wait at a Wendy's where he already was at and then went to his car pulled it over and took the family to Wendy's! That was unbelievable ..

The Original Kale is the kale sauce, which is similar to a stew, and rice. You can also have it with beef or chicken included in the sauce. My personal favorite is the \\"Doria\\" which is where they take the Kale, slather it with cheese and bake it. This is much more like the Japanese mac and cheese my mind had dreamed up. The Doria is not available for take out so have a seat and enjoy this gooey deliciousness. I've been a fan of Kale since the original location but over the years they have offered more add ons such as spinach, hard boiled egg and brown rice.

Maybe 2007. Anyway it's been a long time. I moved into the hood around then and my ex and I stumbled onto it after a bit. Even though I now live near Tigard, I still make the pilgrimage on a regular basis. No bars on the west side can really compare.\\n\\nGlenn, the owner, is the definition of \\"boss\\" in more ways than one. He's super awesome! Big Mike and the rest of the crew have always been great to me too. Since I started frequenting the place, that much has never changed. What has changed is the menu, which is considerably more focused than it used to be (and better as a result) - everyone harps about the pizza, which is admittedly great, but you'll never know what you're missing unless you order an Italian-style hot sandwich. They make their own foccacia for it! They also used to have a handful of super sweet lounging couches right in the big front-room windows, and unfortunately they've replaced those with wooden benching. I guess it's easier for them to keep it clean, but I'll miss those couches, not in small part because I made out with a number of women on them over the years, including my current girlfriend. \\n\\nLest you get the wrong idea, though, this is strictly a dive bar - just a really really awesome one. They're obvious pinball connoisseurs (last I checked they had The Twilight Zone, the delightfully eccentric Dr. Who, an unusual cocktail-style board called Night Moves that was surprisingly decent, and World Cup Soccer), and they have free foosball and pool as well. The beers on tap never fail to impress, skewing heavily towards Oregon craft brews and generally Western crafts after that, and there's usually a least two tallboy choices--including one of the tastiest, Rolling Rock--available for later in the night when all that Creme Brulee Stout and Double IPA starts to go to your head. Locally-painted art adorns the walls, for better or worse, sports games are usually on the TVs but never turned up, and special events are usually quiet enough to keep conversation flowing. \\n\\nWhether you're out with your SO to play some cards and have a quiet evening, looking for a place where you can sidle up to the bar and find a playmate for pool without even really trying, or just desperately searching for a place with strong drinks and low lighting to roll your hangover away until tomorrow, O'Malley's is where you want to be.

Today, we packed our entire apt as it is our last day in the South End.  We went to see a show and decided we should give Estelle's a go for some food and a night cap, like we had done at Parrish hundreds of times.  We were greeted at the door by a gentleman with the following statement \\"yo man, we cannot serve your girl she is swaying.\\"  He then proceeded to go back in and close the door behind him.  No explanation, no questions directed to my fianc√© to inquire if he was right in his \\"detective\\" work, no \\"have you been drinking this evening?\\", not even a \\"you can come in, but she is not allowed to drink.\\" Just straight rudeness.  I was so blown away by this.  We had not even had anything to drink today, we just wanted an app and a drink before bed.  If this is the way Estelle's employees treat new customers, it truly explains why Parrish Cafe 30 feet away is always packed and Estelle's is empty every night of the week.

The prices are also quite high, but you think it's fair game if you get a lot of food - but you don't. I ordered a combo plate to sample everything and like people on Yelp say, the sausage is best. The slaw is very high on vinegar and low on freshness (the cabbage wasn't fresh). The beans are super sweet and not really enjoyable. The potato salad was nice however. As for the brisket, it was tough and quite cold by the time I got to eat it. The single solitary rib (yeah, my thoughts exactly!) was tough and didn't \\"fall off the bone\\" but rather had to be pulled off.\\n\\nOverall I was sickened by the whole experience.

We had intentions of getting a few drinks and ordering food while watching the show. \\nWhen you walk into the restaurant you're basically in the bar area. It was pretty confusing where the host desk was (not even sure if there was one.) While standing there looking around for an employee to acknowledge us, several waitresses, the (eventual) hostess and a chef who had come out of the kitchen passed by us. My husband decided to use the restroom while I figured out where the show was to take place. I chased down the hostess to ask and she pointed to a door and walked away...okayyy. While waiting for my husband, the same hostess was asked by another comedy show guest if he could order food while watching the show and have it brought into him. He was VERY rudely told that \\"she'll see if it's possible but she's not promising him anything.\\" He was there with what I would assume was a date, I was embarrassed for him. \\nWe had to walk through the bar room to get to the show.  It was a very tight squeeze trying to get around the bar and the patrons who were blocking the way. \\nWhew, finally in the show and seated. We happen to be a table over from the man who was berated in the dining area. And this is when I knew we would never, ever eat in this restaurant. A waitress walks over and places his pizza on the table (guess it was his lucky night and they accommodated his request to ORDER FOOD.) He picks up his glass and asks, \\"Are there free refills?\\" Now personally, on a date, I wouldn't ask such a question but that's just me. The waitress was angry! She didn't even respond yes or no to his question, just looked at him and barks, \\"Ugh just tell me what you were drinking!\\" Like how dare he ask if there will be an additional charge on his bill for a drink...I think he has the right to know.  I had to pick my mouth up off the floor. I looked at my husband and we both said, no we're not eating here. I still feel bad for the poor guy that was humiliated by not one, but two employees. It was hard to watch. \\nIt was apparent that in order to work here, you need to act completely bothered by the fact that you're answering simple questions and bringing people food and beverages that they are paying hard earned cash for.\\nOur drinks were fine, the show was excellent.

Translating into 'hospitality,' Teranga is the creation of Marie-Claude, the owner and proprietor, a welcoming, genuine woman who is a South End local. During our meal, she came over to ask where we were from, because she did not recognize us as one of her regular customers.

We chatted about the food, her dream of opening the restaurant, how people often mis-pronounce her name and just anything that came up!\\n\\nThe food was packed full of flavor, yet simple and delicious. There were really spicy notes here and there, which would occasionally surprise my taste buds, and then blend back in with the more subtle elements. We tried the Pinotage (a South African wine blend of Meritage and Pinot Noir), the nems, the whole Tilapia, the Dibi lamb and the Beignets. Marie-Claude even brought out a sampling of her favorite dessert, simply because we were new to her restaurant and she insisted we try it, as it was a traditional Senegalese dish! It was a creamy yogurt-like dish with couscous and chunks of mango, flavored with vanilla and some lighter spices. I contemplated licking the bowl.\\n\\nFor four drinks, an appetizer, two entrees, a dessert, coffee and tea, the bill, with a generous tip, came out to $100, a welcome bottom line for the South End and a steal, in light of the hospitality, atmosphere and service.\\n\\nI am looking forward to going back to visit Marie-Claude and sample more of her delicious, homemade cooking!"},{"name":"Bates New England Seafood & Steakhouse","address":"9467 West Colonial Dr","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"We happened to be on this side of town (we live in Longwood) and wanted seafood.

They were large and tasty.\\nClam Strips--good portion size for a small box (appetizer).  Very tasty, not rubbery, not greasy, overall - Very good!\\nCrab cakes--just ok.

Very good and pricing is excellent!\\nFisherman's catch--scallops, excellent!  Shrimp, good, clam strips very good and haddock good.  Portion size was very good.  Came with fries and online rings.  My husband commented that he would prefer being able to break up the meal and have less fried.  He would have preferred to eat the fish blackened and have sides other than fries and onion rings.  I hope they will consider because it is just not healthy to eat everything fried, especially good fish. My husband left the onion rings.\\n\\nMy husband asked about the chili. Sara was kind enough to bring him a sample and he loved it.  He will be going for that next time.\\n\\nSara was an excellent server and made the evening pleasant.  I hope this place survives.

Loose articles should definitely be placed into lockers. A rider in front of me lost his sunglasses during the ride and it almost hit my eye. Yikes! The Express Plus Pass is NOT available for this ride. This is also the only ride at this park that does not take the Express Plus Pass. I suggest standing in the Single Riders line. The wait is much shorter. \\n\\n2. Revenge of the Mummy- Eeek...it's dark in here. Wait, is the ride over or not? This is nuts! \\n\\n3. MEN IN BLACK Alien Attack- If shooting aliens and winning points is your thing, this is a cool ride to check out. \\n\\n4. The Simpsons Ride- Simpsons fan or not, this is a sweet ride. Lots of neat things to see before stepping into the actual ride. \\n\\n5. Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast- I love that the Rugrats were featured here. It was so nice to see Tommy, Chuckie, and Angelica once again. This ride should be closing down on August 18, 2011. It will be replaced by Despicable Me in 2012.\\n\\n{Shows} \\n\\n1. Universal Orlando's Horror Make- Up Show- This is one entertaining show! Don't miss it. \\n2. Terminator 2: 3-D \\n3. Beetlejuice's Graveyard Revue- Cute concert by Beetlejuice and his friends. \\n4. Animal Actors on Location!- The cutest animals will surprise you with their awesome talent. \\n\\n{Good Eats} Finnegan's Bar and Grill, The Midway Grill (feat. Nathan's Hot Dogs), Beverly Hills Boulangerie. \\n\\n{Notes} An Express Plus Pass allows you to skip the regular lines for rides and shows. If you are staying at a Universal On-Site Hotel, the Express Plus Pass is complimentary. If you are not staying at an On-site Hotel, I strongly suggest purchasing one. You will have to pay a bit more in addition to your park entrance pass, but it's worth it! \\n\\nAlso, pack an empty water bottle with you and fill it up at the water fountains. This way you won't have to fork out $3 for a bottle of water at the parks. If you are planning on filling your water bottles at the soda machines at the restaurants, employees have started to stop us from doing so. \\n\\nLoose articles are not permitted on certain rides (ie. Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit, Revenge of the Mummy, and MEN IN BLACK Alien Attack). There are free lockers available during a visit to these 3 rides only. However, the lockers are timed and you are given about 35-40 mins worth of FREE time.

So we got to celebrate at the chef's counter, which made it extremely special. The menu was composed of dishes from prior menus, and I really thought I died and went to heaven.\\n\\nWe rarely do the wine pairings anymore because we love their 12 mile limit cocktail - the tamarind pairs beautifully with the dishes, and it just has that sweet, sour balance nailed.\\n\\nThe highlights of the menu were:\\n- for appetizers, kanom krok, which is always on the menu ; scallop, coconut cream, lemongrass, and galangal, nestled in a rice cup.\\n- for soup, the chefs served Dtom jaaw plaa which had a tender piece of tilapia resting on shimeji mushrooms, with little pieces of squash and roasted shallot, floating in a fermented fish broth. Amazing flavors of sour and heat, contrasting with the fleshiness of the fish and mushrooms.\\n- for salad, our favorite was the yum mamuang ped grob, which featured a duck confit sitting on a roasted garlic swoosh (culinary term!) with a green mango salad, segments of blood orange and a mango sauce. To die for!\\n- the mains come out as a trio, and we tasted our way through the Nahm prik kai khem, where we wrapped a salted duck egg and shrimp relish in a variety of greens, followed by the Plaa muck pat muck. So let me pause here and tell you that satun style stir fried squid doesn't begin to describe what this was. Basically, I compare it to candied squid - a perfect sweet glaze coated the squid which remained moist and tender as you took a bite - I could have taken another plate home! And to top it all off, a Dungeness crab curry which left me without words.\\n\\nWatching the chefs compose all these dishes, meticulously and with such care and attention to how the flavors combine with each other was fascinating, and probably contributed to the overall experience. Many times I thought they were done putting the plates together, and something else would get added.\\n\\nAs they wrapped up the service, we had a chance to speak with Chef Will and Chef Chris, and they very kindly signed my menu, along with chef Rassamee.

The space itself is roomy yet intimate; finally a restaurant where I'm not physically stuffed next to the adjacent diner.\\nWe were greeted by a few nicely dressed and friendly hostesses. We decided to eat at the bar. The seating is spacious - plenty of elbow and leg room. On the way to our seats, I noticed the crowd was well-dressed and attractive with a few famous Boston sports and philanthropist faces strewn among it.\\nWe ordered some beverages including the Bay Village Buck. Only complaint is that they could have been a bit stronger - I was looking for a drink to help relax rather than something to sip all day. The bartenders were dressed well, friendly, humorous and attentive to our needs.\\nFor appetizers we had the sour cherry dumplings, duck confit and carrot dish. The dumplings were unbelievably tasty and a unique (to me) confluence of flavors- probably my favorite dish of the evening. The rose caviar mixed in made for great texture. My girlfriend liked the confit the most - crisp outside, tasty interior and delicious blue cheese on the side (my 2nd favorite of the evening). The canvas of carrot was super interesting and totally different - but there wasn't enough substance for me.\\nFor our main course, we had the fish and burger. The fish was nice and light - though not particularly memorable. The burger looks beautiful as it comes out - and it was cooked perfectly medium-rare. The fries were the best I've had in Boston and were served with a delicious b√©arnaise sauce on the side. The burger is a great value at $18.\\nWe took a tour of the art in between our entrees and dessert - there were some really interesting pieces (I liked one piece titled 'David and Goliath') but they were very pricey (I'm not a billionaire). This is an aspect of the dining experience that shouldn't' be discounted - they change the pieces rather frequently (according to the hostess) and they're great conversation pieces if you're there for a first date (or 30th date, in my case).\\nThe selection of dessert wines is deep - and the stemware is excellent. The wines are served correctly. We ordered the souffl√© and rhubarb (we were feeling aggressive). The souffl√© was good - cooked correctly but wasn't sweet enough for what I was looking for. The sauce was served in a 'super cute' bowl (per my gf) and was an interesting mint. The rhubarb was more fun and tastier - I would order this again.\\nWe noticed that there is definitely a bar scene at LAH. Groups of young, pretty people were engaged in lively conversation as we walked out.\\nOverall, we had a great experience - we each had fun and ate well! Service was attentive and kind, food was always high quality (though pricey) and the d√©cor was the best I've seen in Boston. I'd recommend it to anyone - for drinks, bar food, a meal - and for a date, intimate meal or business meeting."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I came to Salt Lick with a few expectations. 1.

Got the party started properly with a charcuterie plate of Coppa di Testa made in house... yes, pork head...some big blue cheese and marinated olives, marcona almonds and smoked shallot marmalade.  Nicely presented plate arrived with some crispy slices of baguette and a spicy, horseradish heavy mustard.  Everything was tasty...and who knew pork head was so good!  Next we shared a pizza with broccoli rabe, ricotta, lemon, roasted garlic...and we added pig, this time in the form of prosciutto.  despite the pizza arriving without it, bartender quickly realized it and brought us a heaping plate to add to our pie.  A balanced blend of all the ingredients made this a pizza a good choice as we watched the Bruins game on one of the two TVs behind the bar.

Located just south of Memorial in Grant Park, Stone Soup is an excellently quaint restaurant, serving consistently good food. While some restaurants have cold exteriors and so infuse the warmth into their food, Stone Soup actually has a warm feel to everything. The space is comfortable and feels just right, even when it gets too busy. You can order everything a la carte, or just order one of their set plates.\\n\\nI think it's easy to forget Stone Soup is there when you've got so many other restaurants with bigger names and longer lines. However unlike Sweet Melissa's, Stone Soup delivers on it's simple southern goodness - with a tex mex twist. The atmosphere and the food come together.\\n\\nI have to warn you, it's not a landmark breakfast, and it's not really someplace I'd take out-of-towners to impress them. Stone Soup is best experienced when you don't want to worry about your food, and when you just want to have a nice southern breakfast with good company. According to the servers, lately it hasn't been wild and crazy on the weekends - just a bit steady. A nice comfortable steady. So avoid the 2 hour waits at the Flying Biscuit and Thumbs Up Diner. If you woke up a little late and all five booths at Ria's Bluebird are taken, drive over a few a streets down Memorial and park in the ample lot Stone Soup Kitchen provides.\\n\\nSave your money. Come to Stone Soup, drink some awesomely good coffee, and hangout with the regulars. I'm telling you, it's easy to just turn around in your booth and start a conversation if you so choose. The warmth of the place makes it possible. It's comfortable here. Keep it secret okay?

The small dining area is equally neat and decorated simply in bright colors.  The overall feel of the place is warm and welcoming.\\n\\nAs noted in other reviews, the style of cooking is that of southern Mexico and Guatemala.  Tamales are hand-made and wrapped in green banana leaves rather than dried corn husks.

This location recently was renevated and as far as the design goes I think they couldn't decided if they wanted to continue to be a family restaurant or a bar room. Right now the atmosphere gives off a bar room that serves pancakes, strange. I ordered lobster eggs Benedict (I should have known not to order sea food) and it was a very unsatisfying meal to say the least. For starters it wasn't hot, the egg wasn't pouched, the home fries were soggy and the lobster, if you could call it that, was old and seemed like it was previously frozen and thawed under a heat lamp.

It was a little dense, but so soft and went well with the butter and truffle salt--definitely a nice start to the meal.\\n\\nPork and leek gyoza (4 stars): These were cooked very well and had a nice bite with the pork and leek together.\\n\\nRosemary and goat cheese ravioli (5 stars): This was probably my favorite dish of the night. When it came out, it was a bit odd as there are raviolis, but also some wheels of goat cheese included as well. Little did we know, that goat cheese was seriously delicious and went perfectly on top of the ravioli.\\n\\nHalibut (4 stars): This dish was an interesting concept as it was a halibut filet served over a liquid mushroom broth with some winter vegetables. We both enjoyed this plate, but thought that it might have been better to eat with a spoon and/or some sort of vehicle (bread) to help soak up the broth.\\n\\nBlack cherry short ribs (4 stars): My friend who is a big fan of cherry absolutely loved this dish. I, on the other hand, thought that it was very good, but preferred the BBQ rub on the meat, rather than the cherry gastrique it was served with, as it was a bit too sweet for me. This dish was also served with a side of mashed potatoes that were seasoned with some selection of herbs and was fantastic.\\n\\nSouffle (4 stars): After asking a couple of people what their recommendations were, we decided to go with the souffle for dessert. It came served with a mini scoop of hazelnut ice cream and some cream. The combination of all the flavors was very good, but I was hoping for a little more ice cream to go with the dish.\\n\\nDon't Pop my bubble (4 stars): We also both tried this drink and enjoyed the crispness and flavor of it.\\n\\nOverall, this restaurant has changed a lot of things up recently and is on the right track. Even the manager came over and asked us how our experience was, which was much appreciated. That being said, they still are working out a few of the kinks and the pricing of the dishes is still a bit steep. Nevertheless, I am excited to see how they continue to improve as we were told the head chef from Clio came over in January and has worked to revamp the entire restaurant concept. This place definitely has a liveliness about it in the bar, but still lacks a little energy in the dining room--and I would say that the small plates we had were much more interesting and tasty then the rest of the meal. Finally, the aesthetics are very unique with all of the art around the restaurant and the service was a bit spotty, but very friendly."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place was exceptional.

The first plate was good, though the lack of selection- food- and sauce-wise- was disappointing. There was their I guess signature BBQ sauce, and that was it. Well, there was a bottle of hot sauce on the table. That was something.\\nThe bummer here was that each subsequent serving of the meat got progressively worse. Like, the cuts of meat and the ribs saw a drastic decline in quality. Maybe they were trying to hurry us along.\\nOne thing that was weird; the waitress offered other tables around us the choice of the lean or regular brisket. We got no such choice.

You can't miss the building, it's painted the brightest colors of yellow, pink and aqua and there is usually a crowd of people eating outside.  It can be a challenge finding a close parking spot but you will face that problem at most good restaurants so suck it up and walk a couple blocks if need be.\\n\\nMy coworker (who is Cuban) told me that Pambiche isn't really authentic Cuban food and doesn't taste like food he grew up with.  That doesn't totally surprise me because I've experienced the same with Filipino establishments.  I'm always leery of them because there is too much variation so the taste is never right to me.   The slightest change can be especially disappointing especially when it becomes too \\"Americanized\\" and is not even close to how it should be prepared.  So I told my coworker I was picking up my lunch from there because I wanted his opinion on the flavors of their version.  I ordered the pollo criollo: a generous portion of Draper Valley chicken adobo rubbed with olive oil, tomatoes, citrus and herbs then braised with creole gravy.  It is served with  Moros & Christianos (Cuban version of rice and beans).  I've had this dish once before and loved it so naturally I ordered it again and yes I still love it.  My coworker sampled the chicken (twice!) and he was surprised that it was very close to what it should taste like.  He liked it so I guess I picked the right dish!  It is super flavorful with so many spices going on that it would be hard for me to duplicate it at home so I know it will be my go-to dish there.  I also asked the wait staff the first time I ordered it and he thought it was the best chicken choice on the menu.\\n\\nThe food ordered by my other coworkers that day (shrimp, pork tongue and Cuban sandwich) all received rave reviews as well.  Just remember to leave room for dessert because Pambiche has some amazing creations.  I've had the tres leches ($6.50) a sponge cake with fresh, evaporated and condensed milk, layered with vanilla custard, frosted with crema Chantilly and served with strawberry daiquiri salsa.  Seriously delicious and the best version of tres leches I've ever had because it wasn't too soggy or runny at all.  We also tried the Pudin (Cuban bread pudding for $3.75) and it packed an alcoholic punch with the brandy and sherry soaked bread. Wow!  Lucky my boss ordered it!

When the bill came, my dad threw his credit card down (he's not in the habit of checking) and my mom glanced at it as she waitress pulled it up. My mom mentioned that a $10 tip was already added (on a $50 bill) so we figured it was due to being in a touristy area. So my dad asked the waitress to verify when she came if tip was added, she said no. My dad is very generous, so started tipping and my mom was adamant that it was included, we thought tax was like in California so  my dad gave a $12 tip.

Here's what happened:\\n\\nSaturday night, bars are closed, lots of drunk hungry people all about town.  I'm visiting from San Francisco where slices are aplenty and the people who make them actually WANT to sell them (and are nice about it).  Some locals showed us to The Onion for a slice.  There were 8 of us.  \\n\\nWe waited in line, got to the front, ordered 8 slices ( 8 people = 8 slices; nothing malicious there).  Sign said $3.25 a slice.  ($3.25 x 8 = $26).  We were told it would be \\"the cost of a full pie\\" which was over $30.  \\"Wait, what?  But the sign says $3.25.\\"  After some back and forth with the gremlin behind the counter who got WAY heated WAY more quickly than was reasonable, my friend said, \\"Alrighty, we'll take 2.\\"  We take 2, and pay.  \\n\\nThen we order 2 more.  And then it escalates: the hairy pizza making dude comes out from the back.  He proceeds to scream at my friend and tell us to \\"Get the fuck out.\\"  Good business skills dude. He rants about us \\"wiping out\\" his pizza (that is the goal, right, to sell it?) and again tells us to \\"Get the fuck out.\\"  (Again, 8 people, 8 slices ordered; we weren't trying to screw the guy). \\n\\nWe walk outside, he follows and then proceeds to SCREAM in my friend's face (a nice woman, a mom of two small children, a person who is not drunk or behaving poorly) that she is a \\"Fucking bitch.\\" Our awesome other friends proceed to throw the slices we PAID for at him for being such a disrespectful ass. \\n\\nHe keeps going as we walk away, screaming at my friend's husband, our other friend and then it gets even better: he then refers to me as a \\"fucking whore.\\"  OK, so (1) I was not doing anything whore-esque.  I was trying to order pizza that he was allegedly selling; (2) If you thought I was being rude, the proper phrase is bitch. Telling you that YOUR business model is to sell pizza which you refuse to sell is not a \\"whore\\"-like activity.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this guy was a total ass, he was unreasonably pissed about our desire to buy the pizza he was selling and he did not have the Texas hospitality the rest of Austin did.

We were looking for the chicken nachos on the menu and found they have now changed to a different order nachos. They were okay but they did not live up to the old ones. They were okay and satisfied our hunger but the chicken is not the shredded chicken anymore. They changed the plate so it's not the heaping overflow it used to be.

We waited in line for an hour and a half. It is what it is, but we expected to be treated like we had just waited an hour and a half by the staff. No such luck. \\n\\nMy GF went to use the restrooms and before she got back I was prodded for our dinner orders. I told the waitress we'd need some time so I ordered a bottle of wine and the soft-shell crab appetizer. When my GF arrived the waitress was on top of us asking if we'd decided. My GF asked for a few minutes as we had just waited an hour and a half to sit down. The waitress said \\"I tell everyone they wait longer in line than it takes to eat dinner.\\" That's cute and all, but I don't really give a crap. I wait for a nice dining experience, I pay for a nice dining experience, I deserve a nice dining experience.\\n\\nSo we get the butternut squash ravioli, as my GF has gotten for the past nine years, and I got the Fucilli in Giacomo's sauce. Both were terrific as was the soft-shell crab. As we were trying to enjoy our wine and talk, a woman came by the table and filled our wine glasses to the brim! Literally! Usually that wouldn't be so obnoxious to me, but because I knew they just wanted us out I was extremely annoyed. \\n\\nThe entire meal may have taken us a half hour, and that's only because we were being stubborn about taking our time. We saw two couples come and go at the table next to us before we got up. The first couple came in at the same time as us after waiting just as long as us and were served their entrees as my GF got back from the restroom!!!

Nothing fancy. Shockingly crowded street for a Tuesday night, but then again, it's over 70 F so all Portlanders come out of their holes and stop hibernating. It's amazing how many people I run into that I know when it's summer, simply because people are suddenly out of their houses.  Back to my point. After a nice walk, we started discussing dinner. The game of \\"What do you want\\" is almost always easily ended with \\"how about sushi.\\" Mio Sushi had a line out the door... but just around the corner is Bamboo. I'd never been, and left with mixed feelings about the experience. First of all, it's loud and it's dark. So an intimate dinner of quiet conversation isn't going to happen, and it's hard to see. The tables are also quite close together, so keep that in mind too. Service.... fluctuated. Our server was overly eager at first to take our order. I felt a lot of pressure to order/eat/run as fast as possible. For sushi with a price tag like that, I don't want to hustle. Then, when we were 10 minutes into sitting and ready to order, she was nowhere to be found. No drinks, no server...... our order was finally taken, and within 5 minutes all of our food- I do mean ALL of it- arrived. It was a serious game of Tetris to get it all on the table. That was the last time we saw anyone until quite a while after we were done eating. Now to the important part, the food. Portions are small. The Miso Cod was tasty, but I've had better and it was tiny. The Sunomono salad was great, but again, small. Shisito peppers with bacon were weird. The actual rolls were great, and by far, the highlight of the meal. Like \\"stab you with a chopstick if you eat the last roll\\" good. Wild salmon rolls, California roll, tuna roll, nigiri scallop- all excellent. Ambiance was 2 stars, service was 2 stars, food was 4. I'll give it a 3 star rating to start, but I'd also like to retry it.

I waited at the counter for a few minutes while the two staff members chatted with one another (both with scowls on their face -- if the conversation between them was friendly and happy, I wouldn't have minded, honestly) and had to interrupt to say I was, indeed, a customer there to order. The older woman (who I think may be the owner, not sure) took my order and was dismissive toward my question as to whether they had iced tea (seemed like an easy enough request) and acted as if my ordering a single chocolate chip cookie wasn't worth her time.\\n\\nThis struck me as a little off, but I'm a generally positive and outgoing person, so I gave the woman's cold demeanor the benefit of the doubt, and asked her how her day was going as she rang up my cookie and tea. No response. Not even a 'good, thank you.' Complete cold shoulder. On my way out of the establishment -- because I didn't feel welcome enough to stay and eat the lone cookie -- I threw out another 'have a great day!' to the staff to no response.\\n\\nYou're not obliged to make conversation with people, I guess, but when you run a small business I think customer service has to be a priority.

It is part of why Austin is so uniquely cool.

There is often live music...usually just a guy and a guitar singing Willie...outside by the picnic tables.  \\n\\nBut the real reason to come here is for the meat.  If you don't eat meat, you do not belong here and PLEASE, I beg you, do not review a BBQ place if you do not eat meat!  Anyway, they smoke the meats perfectly and the brisket and sausage are both top notch.  The sauce is by far my favorite BBQ sauce and I was born and raised in Texas around good BBQ.  It is sweet rather than spicy and has a distinct flavor.  I usually don't like potato salad, but I could eat the Salt Lick potatoes by the pound.  The sauce is mustard based, instead of mayo, which is perfection for me.  The fresh white bread, pickles and onions add the last bit of greatness to this BBQ eutopia.

I asked if I could sit in a booth with my friend, towards the back. His yet again confused response \\"Ah, I don't know ...um, what about the bar?\\". I figured I'd make his job easy and just sit at the bar. Yes, there were people sitting in the back and plenty of open booths.\\n\\nSo, on to ordering. Well, the menu looks great... placing an order is a whole separate issue.

Who doesn't love half off your meals with no restrictions, right? So, we decided to take advantage of the Scoutmob for Harry and Sons on a recent Friday evening. Much to my chagrin, Harry and Sons does not take reservations. Arriving at close to nine, we thought we'd have missed the dinner rush, but seems like we arrived smack dab in the middle of it. Harry and Sons seems to be a date spot as there were lots of couples and double-daters that I noticed. I guess people want to make a night of it, hitting up the bars after filling their bellies with Thai and Sushi.\\n\\nThe hostess at Harry and Sons doesn't make her way up front often, so I flagged her down to put our name on the wait list. If you go on a weekend night, be prepared to wait a while. We waited over 30 minutes for a table. In addition to the front dining room that shares space with the bar, there's a room in the back with a fair amount of seating that gives way to a covered patio of which all were full when I visited. If you go, hold out for front dining room or patio seating. The back room shares a wall with the drink refill station and is not too pretty.\\n\\nWe ordered a couple appetizers, the Thai sausage salad and the Surin baskets (Harry and Sons and Surin just down the street have the same owners). The Surin baskets were tasty little bites about the double the size of mini quiche. I liked the ingredients and the peanut cucumber sauce, but I think it would be better sans the corn pieces.\\n\\nThe Thai sausage salad was a fantastic appetizer. It was great for sharing and for $6.50, you get a ton of sausage. Mind you, it isn't a traditional sausage in a link, but pieces of sausage that almost look like bacon that have been cut into pieces. This is one great appetizer you don't want to skip over.\\n\\nAlthough the sushi looked amazing, I was planning to have it the next night, (Social Vinings - I told you I was on the hook for Scoutmob). So, we both opted for more Thai food. Me: Rack of lamb with shrimp fried rice. BF: Duck in red curry. While my lamb was good, the duck was the clear winner of the two dishes. While my lamb was perfectly cooked and tasty, I found the shrimp fried rice to be very salty. The duck had a great flavor and the red curry was hot but not overpowering. I could have licked the plate clean, just to mop up that yummy sauce.\\n\\nOverall, I thought the food was good, despite the fact that I was up later that night gulping down water to fight the after effects of the salty dinner. I think Harry and Sons is great for the neighborhood and I saw lots of customers getting take out orders. I just don't think it is a destination restaurant. You know? If you happen to be in the area and are hitting up the bars perhaps, otherwise there are plenty of Thai restaurants that are just as good in close proximity to me.\\n\\nExtras: 22 oz bottles of Chang (Thai) beer for only $5. Our pre-tip total? $37 Not bad for 2 apps, 2 entrees and a large beer.

I had the Turkey and stuffing and although I did enjoy it...  It not only tasted EXACTLY like the \\"Hungry Man\\" microwavable TV dinner the display was picture perfect same picture on the Hungry Man box.  Turkey and Stuffing.  I am one of the few people I know, that actually likes Hungry Man (10 years of MRE's in the military makes TV dinners seem a lot more delicious than they probably should be)  their potatoes in that meal have a very distinctive taste and texture.  Honestly I was a little shocked by this.  Like I said, I did enjoy it, but I would bet $100 bucks they pulled out a Hungry Man, Nuked it and put it on a plate.  The whole meal had that TV tray flavor, but It was the potatoes that gave it away for me.  No way you can duplicate them that I can think of, nor would any restaurant ever want too.  I go to this Denny's all the time, this is the first TV dinner I ever ate there.  It may have been a failover trick.  Anywho...  I like this denny's so I am not going to give them a bad rating for improvising. Just as an FYI: I did buy that TV tray dinner a few days later just to prove to myself I wasn't off, I wasn't...  I will probably order it again, just to see if it is the same."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I signed up on Yelp just because I felt that I needed to give Craigie a shout out!

I went with my Girlfriend Julie R and we had a great experience! I had the pre fixe country menu that featured a first course of pate with cornichons and diced onion, a second course of Duck Confit over unbelievable potatoes (I have no idea how they cooked them but they made potatoes taste like nothing I have ever tasted before) and a third course of warm fruit cobbler with vanilla ice cream, all courses were out of this world! Julie got the White Salmon entr√©e and the fish was cooked perfectly. Julie's portion of salmon for 33.00 was like the size of a deck of cards but was fabulous! The portion was the only thing that was a bit disappointing. Julie wrote a short email to the owner about this concern and he graciously returned her email with a gift certificate to come back in.

This isn't the type of restaurant to go on a \\"first\\" date on. In fact it reminds me of a middle eastern chipotle. Don't expect fancy d√©cor, expect a chipotle. Don't expect to be waited on either, its fast food, but a MUCH healthier alternative. When I first walked in I wasn't sure what to expect, and it turned out to be great. I got the chicken kabob which was served with rice and salad. My boyfriend got the lamb and our friend got the shawarma. The shawarma looked the best! However mine was great as well. In the back there was a stack of pita's which was a pretty exciting moment knowing you could have more than one. It was great when you wrapped the chicken in the pita. It was delicious. They asked if we wanted hot sauce and dressing. I asked if I could have the hot sauce on the side because when I asked him how hot it was, he didn't know. I don't know if he didn't understand my question or if he never had the hot sauce himself! Anyways, he said I could get it in packets next to the pita's. I tried the hot sauce and it was mild/medium hot. Although I'm sure people who aren't used to spicy, this would be considered hot. I *thought* the hot sauce was going to be a homemade type of sauce, but its not. Very bland, with that tomato like flavor with random pepper spice. It was fine, just don't expect to be homemade because it isn't. I am not complaining because again this isn't a sit in type of restaurant. This is a fast food place. What I liked about this place is that I wasn't getting overly breaded chicken fried in bubbling oil. I was served grilled fresh chicken. For girls you will prefer this over some boneless fried wings especially if your SOMEWHAT conscious of your diet. I like this place because its satisfying and you don't get that feeling of \\"I feel like shit\\" afterwards especially since its served with salad and rice. And rice is probably a million times better compared to French fries. The whole meal was just really satisfying. Its a great alternative to pizza, Chinese food and wings. If your looking for a healthier version of fast food this would be it. It's better than chipotle. They don't throw fistfuls of cheese and sour cream. And it isn't overly high in carbs, unlike chipotle everything is pretty much just one baseball of a carb. It was really the PERFECT place after watching a game. But I am sure my boyfriend would have preferred a greasy fat cheeseburger from five guys next door."},{"name":"Peaches","address":"8580 Alexandra Road, Unit 1020","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Did I ever miss the old Cattle Caf√© that was in this very same location before?

The place was very empty - which wasn't unexpected since it was a Monday. The restaurant space is gorgeous with really high ceilings and very interesting collection of curated art pieces, I wish I had taken up on our server's offer to do a tour of the place. It's very trendy, and elegant at the same time, but I would say that it's definitely not the typical high-end fine dining experience. \\n\\nThe service got off to a rocky start when we were asked to wait standing next to the table while they finished setting it up. Then half way through preparing that table, they guided us to a ready table right next to one of the emergency exits, which was too cold and drafty. So we ended up going back to the first table that they had finished setting up finally. But that was the only hiccup of the night as our server was really cool, engaging, and very helpful with the explanations of some uncommon components on the menu.\\n\\nWe started off with the goat cheese, pork and chicken dumplings. They were all really tasty - the pork one was by far the best one, and I actually liked that the goat cheese dumplings weren't too pungent. As for my entree, I chose the scallops dish and it was very well balanced overall - my favorites were the watercress and carrot components. I didn't get much uni flavor out of the uni butter as I would have liked (if any...), but it was a pretty tasty dish. The strip steaks that my colleagues got were a little more done than their preferences but everybody seemed to enjoy it nonetheless. As for the sides, the brussel sprouts are heavily recommended, it is definitely the furthest thing from a healthy veggie side but it was exceptional.\\n\\nThe prices are in the mid-upper range level, so you have to be ready to spend some money to get a holistic meal. But I would definitely return for the ambience and the art (not necessarily the food or the drinks)."},{"name":"Totto Ramen","address":"169 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3","text":"Everybody said I should try totto ramen in NYC so I was so excited when it opened in Boston.

We drove the 35 minutes to get there through the country and on windy back roads to get to this ranch style restaurant. I was expecting a drive up place where you walk up to the counter to order. Not at all what we got! It was one of the most beautiful locations I've ever seen. Looks like a ranch with a winery/cellar on the property, the buildings are beautiful and have Christmas lights around them. We found a parking space and made our way to the front. The wine cellar sells wine, 6 pack of beer, and offers wine tastings.\\n\\nAs we walked to the entrance we walked passed a black grill, it smelled heavenly! We were greeted by two hostesses, one night and one stand offish. We waited a total of 10 minutes to be seated. In that time, we checked out the menu and decided on what to order. When we were seated we thought there were going to be long tables with other folks but turns out in the barn-like dining room, there are a variety of tables that seat anywhere from 2-8 people.\\n\\nWe ordered a brisket plate; you get a choice of lean, moist or burnt brisket, my wife ordered the moist. I decided to get the Rancher: brisket (moist), turkey, sausage and a pork rib. The meals come with beans, slaw, potato salad. We also got bread, pickles and onions. \\n\\nThe food came out so fast! The brisket was great. Tender, juicy, and fell apart on contact. The sauce that it had on it was smokey in flavor and sweet. The rib was probably the best I've ever had, perfectly cooked--fell right off the bone and was very tender, with just the right amount of burnt. The turkey was also melt in your mouth good. The sausage was cut into pieces that easily fit into your mouth. The casing had a crispiness and inside had a lot of flavor--also smokey. The potato salad wasn't my favorite, I can't put my finger on it but there was something about it I didn't like. The slaw was good but by the time I finished my meats, I was stuffed. But my wife really enjoyed it. The beans were good, again hickory flavor, not sweet and the beans were tender but not mushy.\\n\\nAfter I consumed my fill, my wife ordered us peach cobbler with ice cream. The cobbler tasted more like a cake and the taste of nutmeg was overwhelming. The ice cream was good :)\\n\\nThe prices were right too; we spent $50 for us to eat two entree's and dessert and have soda.\\n\\nThe service was good.

I was looking at mostly the American Chinese lunch specials but the server suggested I try a dish on the authentic Chinese menu.  She took me to a section that she said many liked.  The dishes had no description but were simply termed \\"beef griddle\\" and \\"pork griddle.\\"  I asked if they had chicken and she said she could make me a \\"chicken griddle\\" dish.  I think she mentioned it was spicy and pretty popular so I went with it to try something different.  I also ordered some spicy dumplings as an appetizer also.\\n\\nWhen the food came out the spicy dumplings were as expected (which I've had before at other Chinese restaurants), but the Chicken Griddle dish came out on a sizzling hotpot with a dinner portion of chicken and spicy peppers.  This dish was both delicious and extremely spicy!  Fair warning.... this is not for the faint hearted!  I soon began sweating profusely as I was eating it.  Definitely recommend this for people who like hot food!  Revisiting and analyzing the dumplings, I seem to suspect that the potstickers in this dish may have been Weichan pork potstickers found in most Asian grocery stores, but I don't know that as a fact.\\n\\nWhen I got my check, the dumplings were about $5.95 and the Chicken Griddle dish was $13.95.  I knew the prices but was disappointed that there was no lunch portion of the chicken dish.  I had plenty leftover for a second meal.  I had been looking at $8 lunch specials and was steered away by the persistent server.  I also noticed on my check that the server added 15% tip on the bill without even telling me.

A couple of my friends recommended this place, and so my husband and I came here with them on a Thursday night for dinner.  It was fairly busy inside, but luckily there was an open table for 4 in the front of the restaurant when we arrived.  The restaurant looks like someone's house inside - the interior is painted green (like a lime leaf?) and its very cozy.  They don't seem to have a liquor license but you can get beer and wine (including Thai beer and a couple good Chardonnays and a Riesling, which I always like with spicy Asian food).  We ordered drinks and a couple of appetizers right off the bat.  The service was strange - the waitress was very quick with us, and a couple of times she left the table before we really finished speaking.  For appetizers we ordered the mango salad and chicken spring rolls.  The salad was surprisingly spicy (in a good way), but something about the rubbery texture of the sliced mango was unappealing to me.  The chicken spring rolls were the highlight of the meal - light and crispy with good quality chicken that you don't usually see in a spring roll.  It was memorable and I would definitely order those again.\\nThere was a long wait between the appetizer and entree courses.  When our food finally did come, it was a mixed bag.  I heard the food was spicy here and was preparing myself for a heat injection - I love spicy Asian food!  My basil chicken was only kind of spicy, though the menu claimed it was \\"2 out of 3 flames\\" on the heat meter.  My friend's drunken noodle was really spicy, and my other friend's curry was not nearly spicy enough.  My husband was pouring the chili sauce into his meal - overall the spice was inconsistent compared to the menu claims.  (I wouldn't expect all the dishes to have the same spicy level, but I would expect the heat meter to be consistent across entrees.)\\nThe night featured a lot of waiting and only okay food - with all the options for Asian food in this area, I will probably try a few other places before coming back here.

There's something about the way they cook their meat that just makes your eyes roll back in your head at that first bite... ohh soo good. Makes you wish your stomach was bigger so you could just sit and eat all night long. \\n\\nThe all-you-can-eat family-style meals aren't cheap, but it's truly all you can eat, and you're not getting meat from a buffet that's been sitting around for a while! Every time you're ready to have something replenished, you order it from the waitstaff and they bring it to your table, straight from the cutting board. The cobblers are also to die for, but I rarely get to order them since I'm usually stuffed to the point of pain by the time I'm done eating. (Dessert is not included in the all-you-can-eat.)\\n\\nThe child price for the family style meals, however, is very affordable, so if you have a ten year-old who can eat a lot of barbecue, you can definitely get your money's worth there. :)\\n\\nMy one complaint - and it's a big enough complaint to unfortunately cost it a star - is that the only sides offered with the family-style meals are beans, potato salad and coleslaw - and the potato salad always tastes to me like it would be better warm, not cold. No green beans? No corn? Why such a limited side dish menu? I'd be so happy if more options were available.\\n\\nOther great features - BYOB. Awesome, and totally helps make the high cost of the family meals worth it, since you can definitely save money bringing your own drinks. The beautiful setting (at the south Driftwood location). Love the trees. The smell of decadent meat hanging in the air. The live music while you wait. The sauce. The bread is very nice too... soft and sweet.\\n\\nBe prepared for a potentially long wait at peak times, as it gets crowded.

I myself am not a sausage eater, I've never really found any that I like. This place has the best sausage I've ever had the privilege of consuming. Ribs, phenomenal, the brisket was amazing. Their sauce (yes, I know, it should be sauce free) is a mustard based sauce and quite like I have never eaten before. It compliments the meat like a work of art. The cobbler?

Well. Sounds like every major story arc possible at The Salt Lick has been developed, and every minor detail has probably been addressed, rehashed, pored over, argued about, and carefully dissected until there really isn't much more to say. There's just one little thing missing.\\n\\n*I* haven't weighed in yet. And when that's the case, I feel as if a true, final judgment has not yet been rendered. Obviously, I never check the box next to \\"modest\\" on lists asking to describe yourself.\\n\\nThe Salt Lick was Plan B for the pre-wedding dinner, once the owners of Franklin informed us they would not be able to have an evening dinner service for us (not yet anyway--they are working on it). Fair enough. It actually worked out best, since it was probably more the \\"destination place\\" (as Mark G. described it) we were aiming for with our guests, and because ever since I saw the episode of \\"Man vs. Food\\" where Adam proclaimed it some of the best brisket of his life, I felt the need to fact check that claim. \\n\\nDriftwood wasn't half as far as I'd imagined it to be, but the winding roads and feeling of isolation made me wonder how much fun it would be to drink there without a designated driver on the way back. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, the evening was cool, dusk was setting in, and some guy was strumming a guitar on the outdoor stage as we walked up. I honestly could not think of a better way to feed us and a few dozen or so out of town friends and relatives from both sides who had flown in from the various Western states such as Colorado, Utah, and Idaho. It was time to introduce some of them to Texan BBQ, and I was keeping my fingers crossed The Salt Lick didn't disappoint. \\n\\nWe were led into the restaurant, and past the famous 'Pit\\" to three long tables out on the covered patio. I somehow got out of having to carry the ice chests filled with beer and designer soft drinks outside (it's BYOB), which was a blessing because I was wearing Gucci and didn't feel like getting all grimy. Which was probably a really asinine thing to do, now that I think about it, seeing as how we'd be outdoors with dirt floors and messy food we're supposed to eat with our fingers. Oh well. I *am* asinine, so it's hardly surprising. \\n\\nBefore I tackle the food, I'd like to give a very special shout out to the service. My father was the one who dealt with The Salt Lick beforehand, and it even appeared as if he was familiar with the staff already as well. They all worked together to provide us service in a timely manner and they all went above and beyond on the friendliness factor. There were so many of them throughout the night, but the food plates never languished unfilled, and if you needed something, you had it within a reasonable amount of time. Great job, especially for a large gathering. \\n\\nI took some time to show a few of the guests \\"The Pit\\", and even snapped a photo or two when a waiter said we were welcome to get closer for photos if we wanted.. Don't mind if I do... \\n\\nHere came the meat. I skipped the ribs, but the brisket was super moist. However, the sausage was my clear favorite (shut up). The sides were tasty enough for sides. Our table went through roughly 2 1/2 meat platters and each one was consistently good quality; no batch was \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than the rest. \\n\\nThere was a little mix up on the ice cream with the pan of peach cobbler that was brought out, so those wanting it a la mode were almost half done by the time the ice cream came out. That was our fault for not having some brought out initially, though. They're known for their peach cobbler, and rightly so. I don't even LIKE peach cobbler, and I devoured mine. It is a \\"must have\\".  \\n\\nThere were a ton of hot guys there, a lot of them acting like drunken jerks and stuffing their faces like animals. Naturally, I was hopelessly turned on.\\n\\nFYI, there's little to no Internet service on your cell phone. I remember this fact vividly, as I was personally going apesh*t and quietly having a panic attack for most of the time I felt cut off from the wider world around me. The withdrawals are real.  \\n\\nI didn't realize it until now, but that was the last time the four of us in my immediate family would share a meal together, as just the four of us. They grow up so fast. Oh God, these rural towns sure mess with my allergies... \\n\\nOverall, as far as food goes, I'll give it a 3 1/2 (I've had better, I've had much worse). As far as the venue/event space goes, 5 stars for sure; the dinner was a complete, seamless success and perfect for the visiting guests.

The waiter almost scared me away from the slow cooked organic Tazmanian sea trout, because he gave me such a schpeel about how many customers order it, expecting a white flakey fish, and are shocked when the fish comes and resembles salmon more than trout.  I was happy for the information that it was similar to salmon, but perhaps didn't need to know that some customers are disappointed with it when it arrives.\\n\\nFortunately it didn't scare me enough to make me change my order (though I did hesitate for a moment) and I'm so glad I had it.  It was tender in texture and robust in flavor.  The  almond-Serano ham broth had so many layers of flavor going on, dotted with delicious marinated shrimp and plump mussels.   \\n\\nI also had a bite of the organic roasted chicken and was equally wowed.  Again, such robust and interesting flavors, and perfectly cook, juicy meat.  We also shared the Octopus appetizer, which again was amazing, due to the Chorizo sauce that it was dressed in.  I really think the chef is a master of sauces, and I imagine every dish is a homerun, because of this mastery.\\n\\nI was slightly disappointed that we couldn't try some appetizers off the bar menu while sitting in the non-bar area, but the waiter said that they would be happy to put in their notes to ask us which side of the restaurant we want to sit in, the next time we call for a reservation.  It's service like that that makes this restaurant shine.  \\n\\nThe interior was beautiful, so cozy and perfect for a winter night.  I loved the exposed kitchen, loved seeing the calmness with which the chefs worked.

When checking in on Yelp, I noticed that if you spend $50, you can get a chicken or vegetarian entree for free.

The place is not open on Mondays and I chose to go one thursday evening after work. After reading reviews from others, I opted to go with the jumbo pulled pork sammy, on jalape√±o cheese bread, with a side of red beans & rice plus a sweet tea to wash it all down with.\\n\\nThe sandwich was good but not great. The jalape√±o cheese bread, toasted, was a little over the top in that I felt I was eating too much bread. The cheese infused throughout seemed a little more like cheese wiz, velveeta, or pimento (fake cheese) rather than real cheese. \\n\\nThe bread turned into a soggy mess after perhaps a minute or two of soaking up sauce or sauce infused meat.  The bread was not bad; however, I'm not sure it meshes well with barbecue. The best way for me to describe the problem is that the idea of having pulled pork on jalape√±o cheese bread is way better in concept rather than in actuality.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was good I suppose; but I know I have had better at other places like Buckhead BBQ or Fox Bros. The \\"hot\\" bbq sauce was a little too hot for my tastes. And for me that should speak volumes. \\n\\nMe saying \\"too hot\\"  should tell you something. I have a high tolerance for heat. I think they must use habanero or scotch bonnet pepper to ramp up the heat in their sauce labeled as \\"hot.\\"\\n\\nThe side of red beans and rice was piping hot and, unfortunately, overcooked into almost a mush. The taste was good but perhaps it, at the same time, tasted like it came from a store bought mix or can. It did not taste authentic or homemade by ant stretch; just okay. Perhaps a little on the salty side.\\n\\nI will say that the iced tea was spot on good. My tab, with tax, came to a bit less than twelve bucks. The portioning was good but for the price and quality I am not sure I will return any time in the near feature. \\n\\nA cheaper and better meal could be had at nearby Bell Street Burritos (perhaps a stones throw from P.

Twenty bucks later, I had a bowl of ramen with a few extra vegetables instead of meat.

( which is a great and horrible idea at the same time). I asked the waitress and within a few minutes, she brought me the ramen in a smaller bowl which i promptly plopped into my mega ramen. It was like have a second bowl because i had so much broth left. The noodles i got the second time around were smaller in diameter and more white. I only mention this because they were cooked somewhere between molto al dente and al dente. I would have liked they cooked a little longer and softer as my broth is not as hot as when they first served me. Another friend got those noodles in her meal and she also complained about the texture so maybe they just cook each noodle type differently? \\n\\nMy meal was going great until the second bowl of ramen came. The slightly under cooked texture ruined my ramen eating buzz. If it wasn't for that one misstep, I would have totally added another star.

I call in an order for two of my faves: basil summer rolls and pad kee mao, aka \\"drunken noodles\\".  A quick ride down the street and I pop inside the place. Looks busy which is a great sign. The lady in front is super nice and asks me if this is my first visit.  An affirmative nod and she says, if there's any thing you don't like, come back and we'll return your money.  Whoa, now that's confidence in your food!  \\n\\nBack in the hotel room I bust out the food and it looks pretty good, the three small basil rolls come with a large side of peanut sauce.  Tasty but the sauce could have used a bit more punch and flava.  And now I hit a hurdle, I forgot to ask the nice lady for some cutlery and I've got NOTHING in the hotel room.  And damn, the drunken noodles smell pretty good so I improvise...  Hopefully the first and last time I eat pad kee mao with my, ahem, hands!  The noodles were cooked just right, firm and there was plenty of chicken and spice for this dish.  And we're talking a really large portion for the price, I couldn't finish it all.  \\n\\nSo yeah, Sea Thai does a great job serving up large portions of fresh and spicy food!  The people that run the place are SUPER-nice which is a side bonus.

Drinks were $1.70 for a fountain drink and $2.50 for a Shiner Bock -not bad at all. Total was just under $15. The flautas are pretty small but if you order 3-5 of 'em you've got a meal for $2.25 - $3.75. The small quesadilla would have been plenty of food for me considering it's a good half-inch thick, but instead I've got leftovers for tomorrow. \\n\\nThe food took a bit of time to come out and when it did it was hot and fresh.

However, I've discussed Lime Leaf and recommended it so many times that I feel like it deserves its own review. First of all, when I was discussing Lime Leaf with a friend, he said it was so good the question was, what is it doing in Weymouth? Now, I am proud to be from Weymouth, but the reality is that it lacks in good eating establishments. For there to be *a* Thai restaurant, nevermind one of the best I have tried in the Boston Metro area, is truly startling. Is there even a small Thai population in Weymouth? Not that I'm aware of. \\n\\nSo, it's on Columbian St so I assumed, as did other family members, that it was in Columbian Square. When that was apparently wrong, I started driving toward Braintree on Columbian St, but convinced myself there was no way it was all the way out where it's located. It's nearly across the street from the Curtis Liquors (if you're a local, this will cinch it for you). It's in the little strip mall where \\"the Barn Side\\" used to be located. \\n\\nWhat's great about Lime Leaf is that it really covered all of the bases for us. It has a very cute, cozy interior. It feels like somewhere you want to be eating, not just somewhere you have to (this is also atypical for Weymouth). Plus, the service was attentive and polite and not pushy or loud. Then, the food itself: well it's pretty fabulous. IMHO, great Thai food is distinguished by the layers of flavor. It's not just a one note meal. It has a variety of flavors that sort of continue to hit you as you eat the dish. Also, these flavors are not all what one would call \\"spicy.\\" Some are sweet or refreshing and then a little spicy.  Good Thai food is flavorful, but great Thai food is subtle and flavorful. It's not so in-your-face.\\n\\nThat said, my brother took a date here and told me that he was a little blown away by how spicy it was. I'm not sure exactly what he ordered and I know from experience that some dishes can be really spicy, but I think if you are not a spicy person you need to tell them to go light on the spice. \\n\\nI hate the word \\"authentic,\\" because what the freak do I know about \\"authentic\\" Thai food? I'm not Thai, nor have I ever been to Thailand. Plus, people throw it around like they're experts on what constitutes \\"authentic.\\" I claim to be none of those things, but I have eaten a lot of Thai food in a lot of places and I can sense what is normal for Thai food and what seems to be \\"good\\" Thai vs. not so good. So, in general, good Thai food has more veggies and all those flavors I mentioned. Also, good Thai food is reasonably spicy, at least for your average Bostonian. If you order a dish and say \\"medium\\" spicy it might be verging on way too spicy for a local, but this is the way it should be. So, if you know you're sensitive, assume that you want light spice.  This is what people mean when they say places don't \\"dumb\\" it down. A bad expression, but it means that Thai food should taste like Thai food, not like a watered down noodle dish. I guarantee that the more you experiment with \\"spice,\\" the more you will appreciate it. After all, I'm from here too and I overcame my spice handicap."},{"name":"Flapjak Creperie","address":"4220 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I would love for this place to be successful, as the owners are terrific and nice; however the two crepes we had on our 1st try were so-so.

Let's take a little journey into this restaurant. Walk in and hear 5 guys scream \\"Welcome to Moe's\\" at you, while you awkwardly try to make it where the menu is. The menu is organized in a very complicated manner. While getting the food, it seems like there's lots of options, but when you actually tell them to add like 5 of the toppings, they are very skimpy. So I tried the \\"Homewrecker Burrito\\" which has any toppings with sour cream and guacamole and chicken. \\n\\nWhile the burrito was being prepared, it seemed decent. The chips were just thrown on top of the burrito. They had a salsa bar, which at first I was really excited about. There were five different flavors, so I took a little of each. The chips were very transparent, meaning that they were not fresh. I went ahead and tried all of the salsas. I was really disgusted by them. They were very watered down. The \\"Hot\\" was really mild with a really bad after taste. The burrito was really bland. I had gotten peppers and onions and jalapenos and some other toppings in it. The rice had no flavor. The beans tasted very dry. The guacamole tasted more like cream. Even the peppers had no salt. It was like eating bland on top of bland on top of bland. Overall, terrible place to waste your money. At that point, it would've been better to just burn my money.\\n\\nAnd to kind of point out these \\"5 star\\" reviews that are showing up under this page, I just want to say that isn't it strange that like 90% of them created their accounts like end of Feb 2012 or March 2012 and have only written one review about how great this place is.

The story behind their sushi is great, the service was great. But I'm here to grade their sushi. I ordered 10 different nigiri's a la carte. Almost every single piece of fish was mushy in texture and bland. Yes, the fish tasted \\"fresh\\", but that doesn't cut it for a 4.5 star reviewed restaurant.\\n\\nAnother problem with this place was the rice. Also super mushy, and added no dimension of flavor to the overall piece.\\n\\nI think more effort should be taken to improve the rice quality as a first step. Secondly, the fish could use better aging. I don't know if this is done, but the fish are supposed to be filleted in the morning, and then refrigerated on ice in the open air until ready to serve. This reduces the moisture content in the fish, providing fuller flavor and firmer texture. The final step is the quickly freeze the result, so that less ice crystals form.\\n\\nOf course there are many other factors that could affect fish taste (i.e. butchering process) that I'm unaware of, but the overall conclusion is that bamboo sushi did not do enough due diligence in this department, resulting in a subpar sushi meal."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Yummy food and BYOB!

Crazy light up floor: I don't think this gets enough attention because everyone is consumed in directing their chopsticks chock full of thank- goodness-for-frank Chinese food into their mouths. \\n\\n2. Depth of menu: You could eat here for months and not duplicate a meal. Keeps it entertaining! \\n\\n3. Group Dining: On the advice of a much more versed in Frank-ness yelper (thanks Kit!), when getting a large group together, you can go for a sort of prix fixe menu - you name the amount, and they'll put something together to your specifications. \\n\\n4. Trust the Frank: related to no. 3, if you've ever tried to make a large group reservation somewhere, if you're like me, then you've run into some problems. \\"no, we can't make reservations. no, we can't split checks. whoops, we lost your reservation!\\" Making a group reservation was crazily easy here. They had our party of nearly thirty people set up with tables along one side of the restaurant and were locked and loaded. Seriously major points from me - I've even had one restaurant tell me that they wouldn't even accommodate a group of that size for a weekend night. Preposterous. Don't let this happen to you, and just go see Frank. \\n\\n5. The Food: I've now been here twice - once with just a few people and the time with nearly thirty. Both times. Food. Amazing. I woke up the next morning craving more at 10 AM. And, again related to no. 4, for our group dining prix fixe meal, Frank & Co. chose a really tasty breadth of dishes to suit everyone. \\n\\n6. BYOB: is awesome. BYOB nearly makes me hear angels singing in the background. Did I mention that there's no corkage fee? Just plenty of opportunity to pair your Chinese food with whatever your biceps can carry in and your pocketbook desires - from two buck chuck to a bottle of Dom. \\n\\nSo I thank the yelps for propelling an awesome new place to go for me. . .and I share the yelp in the hopes that you will too!

You could never go wrong with any of the specialty ones that are listed on a small black board next to the menu. They rotate through different flavors every so often so it's always something I look forward to. You HAVE to order the fire totchos. The tots are fried to a perfect golden crispness generously drizzled with an amazing sriracha aioli sauce and a few jalepenos (they're pretty spicy so I usually just pick them off). I've tried the other totchos and found that the ones with too many toppings tend to be overwhelming and end up making the tots get soggy. In my opinion, you're better off ordering the baos separately rather than getting the combo because the 75¬¢ upcharge for the seafood baos ends up to be a same price plus a drink."},{"name":"Black Cat Cantina","address":"18901 E Burnside","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"ATTENTION: YOU MUST READ THIS BEFORE YOU DINE HERE!!!\\n\\nLet me say that this is my first review ever.

The waitress kindly brought a bottle of Prosecco to make up for the delay but subsequently no apology was given for the delay with the food. We finally saw a manager after the food arrived at 10:45 and he was completely unaware there was a problem! Badly managed doesn't begin to describe this restaurant. Also, don't order the scallops - unless you want 3 small scallops on a plate with a drizzle of sauce.

It had fish, scallops, shrimp, calamari and clams over a bed of french fries. The platter was definitely enough to feed two hungry adults. The home made tarter sauce on the side was yummy. For the $18.95 price it was a deal for dinner. They also serve beer and wine for around $4-$5 a glass. I got a glass of white wine that was warm but they put some ice in it after I asked. The order came out within 15 minutes. If you sit outside they call your number on the loud speaker so you can go get it. \\n\\nThe beach area looks to have improved the last few years. There are still some interesting characters walking around. At night the beach looked like a hang out for the city kids. \\n\\nSantorini has a small parking lot which you should be able to find a spot in unless its really busy. \\n\\nThe outdoor seating area is the perfect place to eat if there is a table free. However the several small tables provide seating for 4 people each, so if your a couple, you may get others looking to share it with you. I watched a few people ask to sit with others at their table. The look on the others faces was funny, but they said no problem then left quickly.

And when you compare it with the likes of Barcelona, Toro, Tasca, Tapeo, and Dali, this place is a couple steps below the rest. Pretty cool, modern atmosphere, but the food is mediocre. Tried 8 tapas, and the only one that jumped out was the Bunuelos (Broccoli & Cauliflower Fritters). Everything else from the calamari to the patatas bravas, very basic.\\n\\nServer was great.

They do a little twist like Nobu does, and had some salsa like topping on the sashimi to make a extra zing.  I liked it.  \\n\\nAgain its not exceptional but I believe its one of the top tiers in Portland.  Until we have a market for true high end exceptional sushi restaurants (the ones you get yelled at for drenching your sushi with soy sauce) this is the highest level we will see in this town.  \\n\\nI did not order the funky saucy rolls, I'd rather get those at sushi land since they will pretty much be all the same.  \\n\\nAgain, new restaurant, jam packed, service should be dismissed at this point, but I did get what I ordered, eventually.

So, I had remembered seeing this place from our previous trip to Downtown Disney. However, when I saw the large crowds at Downtown Disney, I thought we would never get in to eat.

I don't know). We also went on Sunday nights both times.\\n\\nBoth times the service was pretty excellent.  Our server was pleasant and friendly without going overboard. On the hibachi side, our server was attentive and quick. Sometimes when I go to hibachi I feel like the server disappears after they take your order, leaving you with an empty water for the rest of the meal. Our server last night was great. \\n\\nAtmosphere- I felt like both times we were in a very nice restaurant. Both sides are suitable for nicer dates, that is if you are looking to impress someone! The sushi bar was cool on that side, and of course, hibachi is novelty and can't go wrong there. They had those rooms where you have to take your shoes off and dangle them in the pit thing (kind of an awkward feeling if you ask me!) but you only get to sit in those if you have a larger party- I suggest calling ahead.\\n\\nI'm taking a star off for the hibachi chefs. I checked the other tables out, and none of them really did any of the cool tricks I've seen at other places. Sure he did the onion volcano, but I didn't get my rice shaped into anything, or a cool egg trick, or a shrimp flopped into the hat, or ANYTHING cool really. I think that is the most fun part about hibachi is how kitschy it is, but this place just didn't have the flare. I wonder if they skimped because there were all adults at our table.\\n\\nFood was average both times. My boyfriend loves the sushi there, so he enjoyed his sushi- fresh and nicely rolled. I had a steak dish that was pretty good and cooked in some yummy sauce. On the hibachi, we both had steak and chicken. The steak outshone the chicken which was a little overcooked and dry. However, the noodles were spectacular! They were thin noodles, not thick lo-mein type noodles. I felt like the portion sizes were pretty good on hibachi, still larger than a normal meal should be, but not an overwhelming amount of food.\\n\\nOn hibachi, you get soup, salad, 2 shrimp, steamed rice (fried for $2.75 more, good but not worth it), noodles, veggies, and entree. We got steak and chicken and the cost per entree was $18.50. Compared to other hibachis I have been to, that is fairly decent. I think it is a pretty good price for all that you are getting. The final bill was similar to a typical dinner for us, so nothing to whine about. \\n\\nNot a fan of their valet. There is only one guy running it, and where you drop off your car is different from where you would pick it up. So, it's a short walk from car drop-off to front door. The first time we went, it was drizzling, but if it had been raining I would have been PISSED that we paid for valet and I still got wet on the walk. Having one guy work the valet is definitely annoying when, (on our first visit), the ONE valet guy is trying to help the group of people just leaving the restaurant, but you are sitting waiting to drop your car off. After 5 mins or so we ended up just parking the car (in a very closeby spot). As we walked to the front, he insisted on taking our keys and moving our car two spots down and then expected a tip at the end of the night. I understand he needs to make a living, but we were tired of waiting. Then last night, we had to wait several minutes for him to bring our car to us as a bunch of tables had left at once, so one person retrieving 4 cars could take some time. The cars were not far away; we could have walked to them ourselves instead of standing in the cold. In summary - they either need to get more valets or get rid of the valet, because it's not effective and has not been a pleasant way to start or end my meal. \\n\\nOverall, I think it's nice to have a non-chain restaurant of this type in-town. I would say it was average; I am not hurrying to return but it is definitely my default hibachi location."},{"name":"Aki Restaurant","address":"7460 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Oh, Japan Food Aki, how I love thee. Let me count the ways.\\n\\nI discovered this place a couple years back when I was planning dinner for a friend's Birthday. As I mentioned in my Hanamizuki review, I frequent some anime conventions with friends from the corners of Florida. One of them, who happened to have a birthday during a convention. To my surprise, I located this little family run place right around the corner. It's set off from the road pretty far, tucked into a shopping center. You'd miss it if you weren't looking, and you might miss it even if you are.\\n\\nThey do a sushi happy hour, with dollar sushi, and have all of my standby favorites like Katsudon and Donburi. They are also the last Japanese restaurant I know of that servers Asahi super dry. All of the food I've had has been fantastic, and the service friendly.\\n\\nThey more than happily accepted the rather large group I plowed in with. The nifty bit, is that they have a private karaoke room. I'm not talking a little room with one of those cheap karaoke machines from walmart either. A flat screen is mounted on the wall, and plays music videos behind the lyrics. The song selection is massive, and 90% Japanese. There's a small list of American songs in each song book, and that's it. The machine itself is Japanese, with more options and controls than I cared to play with. There's some couches, multiple tables, and makes for a fun party/gathering.\\n\\nAlways an awesome experience here. And the prices are super affordable."},{"name":"New Seasons Market - Slabtown","address":"2170 NW Raleigh St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've never had a bad experience at New Seasons. It's like a bigger world marker. Very enjoyable. I used to work at Chuck's and will never go back because of how poorly they treat employees. But I've never heard anything bad about this place."},{"name":"Surly Girl Saloon","address":"1126 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Surly Girl, like many places, has its pros and cons, so let's make a list...\\n\\nFirst off, parking - free!  There is a free parking lot for customers just north of the building.  You can also park across the street at Skully's, or at any of the on-street parking spots.  \\n\\nDecor - fun!  Sort of an Old West kitch with a bit of pirate thrown in.  I enjoy the decor, especially the giant chandalier.  There is always something to look at on the walls if your dining companion is boring, or gets sucked in by the digital jukebox, which is one of the best around.\\n\\nSpace - small!  Surly Girl can be cozy or it can be downright claustrophobic, depending on where you're seated, and how busy it is.  A trick the \\"regulars\\" know is that you can go all the way to the back room and grab any available seating without a wait.  There is no wait staff assigned to the back room, but you can order food at the bar and they'll bring it back to you.  Speaking of regulars, Surly Girl can have a bit of a \\"scene\\" feel to it some nights, depending on the crowd; don't let that bother you.\\n\\nService - iffy!  Some servers are friendly, some are not.  If you're just drinking, sit at the bar for better service than you'd get at a table.  If you have a group of five or more people, one server in particular will enforce enforce the \\"no separate checks\\" rule, but others will let it slide.\\n\\nAnd now the important stuff - Food and Drinks\\n\\nFood is generally spicy, a little on the greasy side, but not bad.  Pizzas and salads are the best bets IMO.  Wraps and sandwiches are a little lacking, although the range of side dishes is wonderful.  As far as appetizers go, the red bean hummus is healthy (maybe the only thing on the menu) and, while it could be more flavorful, not a bad option at all.  On the other end of the spectrum, I adore the nachos with veggie chili; they're full of toppings and fat and calories, but also full of flavor and excellent to share with your table of friends.  And don't forget the cupcakes; I read one review in which they were described as dry, but I've found them to be quite good.  \\n\\nThe Surly Girl beer menu is unique and full of local, organic, and woman-brewed brands you won't see every day.  Prices aren't bad for specialty beers either, plus they sell PBR tallboys if you're looking for beer of the cheap variety instead.  I tend to pass on their seasonal or signature drinks as they're more quirky than tasty from what I've tried.\\n\\n3 stars, but I wish I could do 3.5"},{"name":"Pure Taqueria","address":"300 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I've been here before I moved to ATL, and I remember how great the ambiance, drinks and food were...

I've always been very picky about Thai, and particularly skeptical of little hole-in-the-wall restaurants in cruddy strip malls (which this one certainly is, on the infamous Cheshire Bridge no less), but Little Bangkok completely rocked my ass.\\n\\nThe decor is straight out of tacky Chinese dive: toothpaste colored walls and flashy idols and paper birds and butterflies, absolutely overboard with gold and glitter. It's perfect, and you couldn't ask for better. I stuck with the Chinese half of the menu (they split down the middle with several options for both persuasions) and ordered a cup of the best Won Ton soup I've ever had--rich and flavorful in a way I don't often expect.\\n\\nI knew on first bite that the General Tsu's chicken (my favorite dish) was impeccable. Crispy chunks of quality chicken, sauced to perfection, and more spicy than sweet. I was full after I'd only eaten half of the order, and continued to clean my plate while eating for taste alone like a fat fat fatty.\\n\\nUnlike many other Chinese restaurants, they have four amazing desserts, including homemade coconut ice cream (oh my god), and a strange sticky rice/mango/coconut sauce concoction that had the whole table cooing.\\n\\nThe service as well was perfect: they refilled my water just about every time I took more than a sip.

A serial killer?) and are craving Thai food.  So, we do what every responsible citizen does, we jump on yelp, and low and behold, Chilli Duck!\\n\\nNow, mind you, we have been told by a couple of new friends (did I mention how much I LOVE Boston and can't believe we live here?!!) to skip this place... there are better.   But the reviews were good, they had online ordering (plus 10% off with online order), and the prices weren't out of this world.\\n\\nWe went for it!!  I ordered the Pad Thai (as always... it's how I \\"judge\\" a new Thai place) and my husband ordered the Panang Curry (ditto).  Plus, of course, the Fresh Rolls (or basil rolls, as I've also heard them called).  The rolls were fantastic, although I was surprised that they were cut into pieces for us.  Not bad, but I prefer the roll intact... that's just me.  The flavors and textures were there, nonetheless:  crunchy carrots and lettuce, smooth rice noodles, shrimp, and the best. part... Thai basil!  Is there anything better than Thai basil?   The peanut dipping sauce was good, not too sweet.\\n\\nI have to say the Pad Thai was very good.  There's a thin line between too much sauce/sweet/peanut-y flavor and not enough (for me, anyway).  This was on the light side.  The peanut flavor was there, but very subtle.  Nice pieces of chicken and shrimp cooked to perfection.  And I liked that they tossed the bean sprouts into the noodles, so every bite you get a nice crunch from them.  I could have used more heat, but I can specify that next time.\\n\\nThe curry was, well, amazing.  Both dishes could have been a little spicier for us (we're originally from Texas and like our spicy food!), but, again, we can definitely specify that next time.  And speaking of specify, I added in the \\"notes\\" portion of the online order form to please put the crushed peanuts for the Pad Thai on the side, honestly half expecting them not to.  But they did.  And that was a nice extra detail.\\n\\nOne last note:  Not sure why they are getting \\"over priced\\" and \\"small portions\\" comments in some of the reviews.

Unfortunately Mozart's truly disappointed and put a damper on the evening due to the attitude of the staff at Mozart's. First, when we got there the line system was clearly flawed, but I understand how it can happen during the busy season so I am happy to let that slide. Where it all started to turn was when someone moved to order without standing in the line and my relative politely went to the counter and let them know that he had moved in front of the large group of people waiting in line. The blonde lady who was working just told us we had to wait our turn and let the man order. AGAIN I understand how this can happen due to it being a busy Friday evening so again I will let that second one slide. Now what really got me upset enough to write this review was when that same blonde woman very condescendingly said, \\"NOW... it is your turn to order.\\" The fact that someone that worked at this establishment thought it was okay to speak this way to a customer was unbelievable and honestly just made me realize what the real problem was. Not the flawed line system, not the mixup in the coffee (that occurred after the incident), but instead the incredibly noticeable arrogance, attitude, and lack of respect that the employees have for the customer.

They were a bit of a miss, they were good but no where near as special as my dish.  Then for our main dish I got the Sirloin with the tongue and my fiance got the Chicken stuffed with sausage in a Mediterranean inspired dish.  This time my fiance's dish was a 5!

Also - important to note dessert was great and on point and they even gave us free wine to pair with our desserts this time.  Our seats were also the best in the house in the corner so we can see the entire kitchen and the whole restaurant.  I feel like we must have been flagged in their internal system as patrons who complained last time and need to be treated super well this time.  Regardless it worked!  We were def super happy and overall had the experience we wanted to have the first time we came in!

I like it.  If they're like the other 2 locations I've visited, they have two happy hours.  First one is 4:00-6:30pm and the second one is 9pm-close.  You should confirm that though, because I've only gone to the early one here (the Domain definitely has the late one)\\n\\nIf you're hungry around happy hour, this is the place to go.  They offer a 1/2 pound burger + fries for only $1.95!  Other $2-5 options are available (bruscetta, mini truffle cake, artichoke dip, fish tacos, cheese quesadillas, crab rangoon,and more),  but the burger is the best bang for your buck.  I have tried the turkey blt sliders (three little sandwiches for $4.95), and they were okay, but not great or a good value, especially compared to the burger and fries.  I'm going to go ahead and remind you about that 8 oz burger and fries one more time.  Did you hear me say it was $1.95?!  That's cheaper than McDonalds! Why do you even care what else is on the menu?!\\n\\nSome drinks are reasonably priced, but fancier ones like cranberry mango martinis are still in the $8 range.  The bartenders can make a variety of interesting concoctions, and the bar menu has tons of special cocktails listed and described, but I stick to pretty ordinary things, mostly because they are cheaper.  I enjoyed my sangria ($5 for about 10 oz on ice) and a Shiner Black ($3 for a pint).\\n\\nTo me, it seems that atmosphere sets McCormick and Schmick apart from other happy hour locations.  The dark wood paneling, well designed bar, stained glass armadillo sconces, dressed-up employees, and large windows give this place a classy feel.  A businessman could take his clients here and feel good about the impression he would make.  My dad, who can't even eat seafood, still speaks highly of the consistency, quality, and reliability of the entire chain of restaurants.\\n\\nIf you want to wait out traffic for a while and grab a snack one evening, check out McCormick and Schmick.

We finally got our pizza and there is just no flavor to it whatsoever. The breadsticks are simply dough, that's it. No spices or anything on top. The cheese sauce is also underwhelming.

Come for the food, but not necessarily for the service.\\n\\nPros:\\nI've come here about 5 times. I have business meetings nearby and sometimes the seafood craving hits just in time for lunch.\\n\\nWhat is there not to like about the warm lobster rolls? The crispy, buttery roll sandwiches, the large chunks of lobster. All I can say is \\"mmm\\". \\n\\nTheir specialty oysters are just to die for. I'm always upset when they run out. Honestly, I think they're some of the best oysters I've had.\\n\\nTheir fish sandwich is simple, yet excellent. I always want to try new dishes, but I find myself choosing this often.\\n\\n\\nCons:\\nIt seems like a hit or a miss with the waiting staff.\\nMost everybody seems to be friendly and nice.\\nHowever, I remember one of our waitresses just seemed to abandon us. We couldn't order for a long time, when I asked for horseradish with my oysters I had to ask 3 times and then ask another staff member for it, and the whole check process took almost 30min.\\n\\nAs for food, I would stay away from their fish tacos. Not only are you given two of the tiniest tacos I've ever seen, they are just awfully conceptualized. They overwhelm everything in it with pickled vegetables and all you taste is the sour and sweetness of that. There's no depth to the flavor because of this. You can't even taste the fish, even though that's the main reason for eating it.\\n\\nIf you're someone on a budget, this is not the place for you. They have great dishes and fresh ingredients, so expect to pay a premium price."},{"name":"Liquid Art House","address":"100 Arlington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow. I don't know if it's because they just opened a few weeks ago, but what an awesome first impression they left on me!\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty roomy and the ambiance is chic and cool, with art plastered all along the walls. They are all open for sale and you are given a price listing of each artwork along with your menus to pressure you into buying them. If $3,000 is pocket change to you, then by all means go for it!\\n\\nI made reservations at 8:30pm and came here on a Sunday night during opening week expecting it to be busy, but I guess because it was Sunday night and Mother's Day on top of that, it was dead. The service was IMPECCABLE, they even brought over a wine specialist just in case we had any questions about their extensive wine list. \\n\\nAs for food, right after we ordered, they gave us bread of our choice to start while we wait. We both had the pretzel bread and it was good and different! I had the 7oz filet, which was accommodated with a port wine demi glaze sauce on the side. I also ordered a side of asparagus. My date ordered the Colorado lamb; both presentations were great! As for taste, my steak was just delicious, especially with the sauce; very tender and left me feeling the postpartum lol. My date also enjoyed his lamb as well! We didn't decide to order dessert because we were full, but they brought us over little sample pastries anyway!\\n\\nI would loveeee to come back and just treat myself to their food, but next time I will sit at the bar!

Even after we had cancelled, they still contacted us about rescheduling to a later date. Their next available opening was Jan 15th and of course, we snatched it right away. I couldn't be more happy with the prompt communication and accommodation Langbaan provides! \\n\\nOMG, the food! Where to even begin?!

First of all, although I wasn't looking to wake up with a hangover, I do object to paying 7.50 for a vodka soda (house brand vodka) and having basically no vodka in it. that's pretty expensive for what is basically a glass of soda water.  second drink was made the same way.  Bartender, although definitely friendly, didn't really seem to be into bartending.  And, it really seems like the bartender should have asked the girls sitting in middle of bar to stop pounding/slamming their fists down on the counter. this went on for hours. it was driving everyone around us insane.

Recently, out-of-town friends were guests at Loews, so I met them at the bar, hoping for an improved evening.\\n\\nUnfortunately (or fortunately?) the restaurant Eleven is undergoing renovations. I take this as a good sign, and I'm curious to see what comes next. One thing I do know is the staff at Loews are friendly, professional, and keen on making sure their guests are well taken care of during their stay. Another thing I know is the bar at Eleven is still open, and they serve excellent cocktails. I quite enjoyed their twist on the classic mojito; theirs is made with basil and kiwi instead of the traditional mint and lime. It's refreshing and delicious. I'd happily return for more. The bar area setting is very nice, the bar stools are super-comfy, and the bartenders are at the top of their game.

Yes it's pricey (ok incredibly expensive), but that doesn't mean it has to be a rip off. My wife and I came in for an early dinner and were lucky enough to find a seat at the bar. We each ordered a beer and some food. My wife ordered the ribs, which were super sugary, and I ordered the stew, which tasted ok, if you could find the food in it. The portions were very small (and a crazy price). The service was below the typical Disney standard as the bartender disappeared after our first beer and was never seen again.

The area is kind of cool and the reviews looked great. I have to say I give them 3 stars mainly because I can't give them 3.5; it really isn't a 4 start place though.\\n\\nI have to honestly say the beer selection is great and a bit intimidating at first as well.

The awesome thing was that it came in the Hopsecutioner glass and they were nice enough to sell it to me (for an outrageous price though! But oh well!). \\n\\nOn to the food. Let's start with the Goat Cheese Fritters. As good as they were, these are not truly goat cheese fritters, as it is mainly potato with goat cheese mixed in it. in most restaurant, a goat cheese fritter is a piece of goat cheese fried. Either way they were good. I got the Buffalo Shrimp Po-Boy and it was pretty good. The sauce was nice and spicy, but the Chow Chow they put on could have had a few more days to rest. Also, not a fan of the blue cheese on it. It somewhat overwhelms the rest and all you have left is the taste of blue cheese in your mouth. All in all, the food was good. My fiance got the Fish & Chips and those were good, although the fries (not chips) were a bit soggy and greasy.\\n\\nOn to the service. All I can say is that it is not the greatest by any means. You virtually have to wait 10 minutes for everything you order. Including your check and them bringing you check back after you have paid. A little annoying but we were not in a hurry, so it wasn't a big deal.\\n\\nFinally the atmosphere. We sat outside on the long tables with benches and the day was great.

For our side, we ordered the Avo Tuna. Our food came quickly (always a good sign of good operations) and we were able to dig right in! I was a bit disappointed with the size of the Mega Ramen. If you name something Mega, it's gotta be so big that I can't finish it. That's about the last thing that I had to complain about though. The broth was very rich (if you like lighter broth, this may not be for you) and the chicken flavor was deeply infused into the al dente noodles. Some have said that they didn't taste much flavor in the broth. That was definitely not my experience - perhaps they were expecting the same type of broth as pork? In any case, the char siu pork was tender and mixed well with everything. My son loved the Avo Tuna and my wife was pleased with the spiciness of the ramen.

Pizza Hut's quality gradually declined over the years, so we don't talk anymore.  Domino's was off the radar for years until their quality improvements over the past couple of years - they've made great strides and we do talk on occasion.  Little Caesars - - WTF happened?  Still love the crazy bread but I skip the pizza.  And if I'm financially challenged and feel like eating cardboard then I call Gatti's, and since I don't like cardboard we don't ever talk.  Over the years Papa's has been consistent (quality and taste-wise) and I love how they also offer online discounts - although I must add - I think their portion sizes have shrunk throughout the years (sorry! *Debby Downer*)\\n\\nOne night we wanted to order pizza for the MLB All Star game (booring) so I went to Papa's webpage to submit an online order and take advantage of their awesome discounts.  The checkout page says the final bill was $10.24 (for a large \\"works\\" pizza + 10\\" cheesesticks).  Wow, now that's a deal!  Before clicking \\"pay\\" we came across another tough decision:  pickup or delivery?  \\n\\nWe debate and further delay, then my laptop freezes, I get the infamous blue screen, then physical memory dump, then it shuts down.  DAMNIT!  I reboot and start all over again, but this time the website calculates the order at nearly $13...?  WTF?  I tried and pried and clicked and bitched but we couldn't get back to that original $10.24.  That doesn't make sense so we call the MLK store.  \\n\\nAn employee (dude) picks up, we explain our dilemma, he says he can only get it to $11.64...?  WTF?  Now that's 3 different amounts for the same exact order, all we want is the original quoted $10.24.  He puts me on hold to talk to the manager, and after several minutes waiting my cell drops the call (bad signal).  Yes, bad tech night (thank u, Sprint).  Frustrated and starving we give up on Papa's and being looking at other options, then my cell rings and it's a really nice soft spoken person named \\"Kat\\", the MLK Store Manager.  She was so nice and spoke so softly that we had to clarify - - \\"are you the store manager??\\" - - yes, she was.  \\n\\nWe explained the issue and told her not to worry since we were going w/ another option, she was super nice and apologized for the confusion and said she'd like to honor that initial online price if we were still interested, plus she could start making our order right away.  Wow - now that totally simplified things!  That's what we wanted in the first place, so we obliged and ordered for pick-up.   During pickup she told us she couldn't get the exact $10.24 amount so she worked it out to $9.79 instead.  Wow - that's cool, but we said we would like to pay the full $10.24, so we left a tip for pick-up and dropped some loot into the charity bottle on the counter.  Now that's what I call WINNING!! x 3:  we get a great deal, Papa's gets biz and tipped, and we contribute to feeding hungry kids in the process.  Awww yeah. \\n\\nThe pizza and sticks were piping hot and tasted great, excellent quality.  Love the garlic butter but the pizza sauce cups are *meh* - - tastes better on the pizza.  Regardless we were so pleased w/ Kat's friendly and professional customer service, it wasn't something we expected.

I love Mexican food, but I also have a super sensitive stomach and celiac disease. I can't eat a lot of things that I really enjoy, other than tacos...which usually doesn't feel like enough for me. So with that being said, I have been going to various places looking for delicious Carne Asada Fries...I love them, they're so bad for me, but just so good! Typically though I visit the location on 188th and Stark, but they're closed for renovations; so today I went to this location and ordered my usual order of fries, \\"jalape√±os on the side, extra sour cream please\\" and I was informed that theirs do not include jalape√±os...which is fine by me if they make things differently by location. My problem though, is what I got. Before me, I have a to-go container of lukewarm, soggy fries covered in fake nacho cheese sauce (and not even the good kind from Elementary School), with some semi decent meat thrown in there. Mind you, the sour cream was extra! And these bad boys cost almost $8. Now, if you're into sweet and salty congealed cheese sauce, these fries are for you. If you enjoy removing your dentures and mushing soft gooey fries between your gums, these fries are for you. If you like taking a bite and chewing up something SO soft, you could almost swear it was a piece of cooked onion...until the odd sweet mystery flavor comes forth, then these fries are definitely for you! But not only that, if you're a kind and understanding person that likes to take risks...these fries are for you, because I'm sure you'll be fine picking out the rock hard fry pieces that were forgotten on the pan and then so generously added to your delicious meal. So if all that ^^^ applies to you and that's the kind of food you like, get these fries...or go to Taco Bell, you'll spend less money and the cheese won't be sweet. And bonus, you'll have like an extra 30 seconds to make it to the bathroom before crapping your pants if you just go to Taco Bell. Realistically speaking, I don't expect perfection and I understand offering cheese sauce for the people who do prefer it, but it's not fair to claim being an authentic Mexican restaurant when the ingredients aren't even real. I could sarcastically go on forever about how delicious these fries are, but I think I'm going to lay down instead...because either I'm experiencing appendicitis, or these fries were a bad idea."},{"name":"Aki Restaurant","address":"7460 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"A local favorite.

Read a few other reviews and had mixed feelings. \\nI give 3 stars for the following reasons:\\n\\n-The hot dogs are small, for 7-8 bucks I expect a long juicy hot dog. As other have said, the 1.50 hot dogs at costco's are priced better and taste just as amazing. I think these should be priced more at 4-5 bucks. \\n\\n-to be just hot dogs pretty much, the service is slow. I'm sure they are back there on the grill already and all the toppings have to just be put on top. Should be a quicker turnover between order and food arrival\\n\\n-there's no military discount. I'm not one for freebies just because I serve my country because it's what I volunteered for, but normally privately owned non-chain restaurants seem to be more willing to offer some kinda discount for military. Group that with the fact that their food is so expensive, I guess I thought they would offer one. I spent 20 bucks on 2 hot dogs tater tots and a soda......\\n\\nSuggestion (if they read this) think about changing your prices, you'll get more business if your not robbing people for a small hot dog. OR get bigger hot dogs and keep the prices the same. Work on your servers and cooks getting food pushed out a bit faster. Lastly offer a military, police, ems discount. Showing your appreciation for those who work tirelessly to keep you safe, protected, etc and losing out on 3-5 bucks per order won't kill your business. Truth be told as an active duty military member we frequent places the most that offer an amazing discount. Would you rather have my 20 bucks today only or would you rather have my 10 bucks every few weeks for months and years to come.

The waitress was very nice and thought it was strange that they've even lowered the temperature of pork all together...once it was cooked through, it was a lot better! It came with some mixed vegetables, roasted green, red and yellow peppers, and very good mashed potatoes. \\n\\nThe seafood marinara was pretty good, as well. A little on the spicy side, but if you like spice this is definitely the dish to get. Tons of muscles, clams, scallops and HUGE shrimp. \\n\\nOverall it was a pleasant experience and we would definitely go back again...so besides the fact that the pork was originally undercooked and the waitress forgot to bring us our starter bread basket it was very good! \\n\\nI also would recommend their Red Sangria!

Ordered summer rolls, pho, ramen, and assorted nigiri. \\n\\nThe service was good, we got dessert on the house as well! The food has a very Vietnamese twist as well so the ramen was Miso broth, shin noodles, corn, wakame, fried shallots, and Viet grilled pork with softboiled egg. It was good but not what I'm used to. The Pho was a standard pho, which tasted good as well. The summer rolls were very tasty and fresh. However the star of the meal was the sushi. We had yellowtail, salmon, egg, and toro which were all very fresh and the presentation was beautiful. Something I noted was the fresh ground wasabi, tastes different and more horseradishy than wasabi powder, also mixes wonderfully in soy sauce. \\n\\nThe dining room is very clean and calm, with soothing music in the background.

We were automatically greeted by one guy who claimed he comes here often.  He was super friendly, and pointed us in the direction of Brian Murphy, a pretty gosh darn lead singer of his band called the Shills.  Brian was the host of the open mic and he told us that it can start anywhere between 9:00-10:00pm, depending on the crowd size.   Performers are allowed to sing 2-3 songs, either covers or their own pieces.  If you have your own instrument [ie guitar], All Asia has the cables, mics, etc needed for your voice to be heard loud and clear.\\n\\nIt was my friend's first open mic, and we were a little apprehensive.  After grabbing a few inexpensive drinks from the bar and chit chatting with other performers that night, we were slowly becoming more comfortable.  Everyone applauded for each performer and after each song people sang, which was great.  After my friend had her turn, everyone complimented her and even gave us more examples of other open mics to check out.\\n\\nAlthough there were far more bumper stickers and writing on the bathroom walls than actual people in All Asia, we felt very welcomed by small number of people there.

Oh.My.God was this good.  Anything that says \\"roasted beets\\" makes me salivate, throw some goat cheese on there too??  Heaven.  We were licking the plate clean.\\n\\nFor my dinner, I ordered the Braised Be. Beef, which is a braised short rib served with horseradish mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and parsnips.  This was divine.  The rib was huge, at least 6-8 ounces, all meat, very little fat, and it had been braised perfectly.  It was tender and juicy, no knife required.  The horseradish potatoes were what made me choose the dish, and they did not disappoint.  My first time eating parsnips, I'll definitely attempt to roast them in the future!\\n\\nMy mom let me taste her fish and chips, which came in a paper pouch, great presentation, and amazing flavor!  Crispy and flaky, served with both malt vinegar and tartar sauce.\\n\\nWe were way too stuffed for dessert - but I can say with supreme confidence, when I go back to Disney, I'll go back to Raglan Road!"},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Yooooo food is awesome!

It was the first time for me and my dad, but the third time for my mom and my brother.  We phoned our order in and then went to pick it up.  There was a healthy crowd of hipsters waiting outside for a table and we had to wait about ten minutes for our order.  They have quite a bit of outside seating, but the inside seating looked a little cramped.  There were about fifteen people waiting which was considered light by the waitress we asked.\\n\\nFor those who don't know Portland, 28th and Glisan is not in a bad part of Portland.  Thanks to the urban growth boundary, the bad parts of Portland packed up and moved to Gresham.  Anyhow, parking looked tight since the restaurant does not have its own lot.\\n\\nThe food is good.  I've had authentic Cuban food in Miami before and Pambiche's food is comparable.  Their menu is extensive with good descriptions of the dishes and the portions are large.  I got the plato Cubano and was not disappointed.  The pork was tender and tasty.  We got an order of tostones which are fried green plantains.  They were pretty dry so I would pass on them next time.  I also got tres leches which was passable.\\n\\nThe big negative about this place is the price.  Dinner entrees will run you $10-15 which seems a bit much for rice, beans and meat no matter how long you simmer it.\\n\\nI don't think Portland has a huge Cuban population so I don't know if there is much pressure to serve authentic food.  It's definitely worth a try though."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"3519 Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2","text":"It's a McDonald's, not the finest I've ever been to but certainly not the worst either.

The bread was nothing special, but the white bean puree was delicious.\\n\\nWe ordered from the prix fixe menu, which we were excited about. The appetizer (a caprese) salad was yummy, but nothing I couldn't have made at home.\\n\\nOur first course was absolutely delicious. I had a fig and pancetta ravioli with creamy sauce that I literally scooped out of the bowl with extra bread. \\n\\nI then had the chicken main course. The chicken was over cooked and the sauce was in between average and disgusting. I ate hardly any of it, but that was okay because I was so full of bread.\\n\\nThe ambiance was alright, but the place is quite small. We were unfortunate enough to be sitting by a very American girl who would not stop complaining and swearing loudly. We almost complained to the waiter about it (both the waiter and the back waiter were absolutely lovely, by the way). \\n\\nIt was a little expensive for what it was - we weren't overly impressed, although I'm still admittedly craving that ravioli."},{"name":"Edgewater Cafe & Catering","address":"155 Washington St","city":"Salem","stars":"2","text":"After walking past the Edgewater Cafe a million times as a resident of Salem, I finally decided to head in there for some fabulous Mexican cuisine. Unfortunately, my experience at the establishment was poor enough for me to write a review in order to warn others of the mistake. \\n\\nTo start things off, I should have picked up on the warning signal that there were no other patrons in the place. Second, our waitress looked stoned out of her mind and she proceeded to ask, \\"What are you having to drink?\\" as she spoke to the bucket of bleach she was cleaning the unused tables around us with. \\n\\nNext came the crappy chips and \\"salsa\\" which clearly were a minuscule step-up from a jar of Pace and a bag of Tostitos. As it was lunch, my lunch guest and myself ordered off of the specials menu. His choice: Edgewater Wrap, my choice: Chicken Quesadilla.\\n\\nEverything looked great upon the arrival of the entrees, except we noticed that the side tortilla chips that came with the wrap were AWESOME compared to the bagged version of Tostitos we were served with the salsa. Weird. You'd think \\"homemade chips and salsa\\" would be consistent throughout the course of a lunch. \\n\\nThe first bite of the quesadilla almost made me lose it right at the table. To be honest, the taste was comparable to a salty mixture of old processed chicken and canned French onion soup. In a complete disappointment, I shared a bite with my lunch guest, who also exclaimed how unbearably salty and \\"onion-soupy\\" it tasted. My lunch guest then told me that his wrap was basic, and there was nothing \\"Mexican\\" about it at all. \\n\\nUpon a further inspection of the 'dilla we noticed that the chicken looked terribly dry and old and the ingredients were dull, a couple of charred green peppers and onions sitting in a drippy pool of salty chicken juice. At this point, I was so flabbergasted that I had actually found BAD Mexican food and I tried to laugh it off and just finish my meal. Eating that dish was deemed impossible as I spit into my napkin (how embarrassing!) and even through my love for Mexican and my hunger for lunch; I was required to push it aside barely touched. Discarding food is something I have never done before, and I honestly had a tough time dealing with because our waitress was so awkward. \\n\\nShe finally noticed that I had abandoned my entire meal and asked, \\"Would you like this packed up?\\" Uhm no thank you, and I would suggest that you take the nine-lives chicken and soup special off of the menu. I would have loved to respond that way, but my lunch guest did point out that the waitress is not the chef. I simply told her it was not as I had expected, and to give her credit - she took the soup-dilla off of the bill and we scurried out of there over to Gula-Gula for a real lunch. \\n\\nIf you're in Salem, MA and you're looking for an authentic Mexican meal, drive 10 minutes down the street to Beverly center and hit up Cielito Lindo, and if you have more time, head over to Gloucester for delicious Portuguese inspired food at Azorean. Screw it, I'd even suggest traveling to the North Shore Mall for a round of Taco Hell before stepping foot in Edgewater Cafe. Let's hope the new Tavern on the corner has a Mexican inspired section of the menu and sends Edgewater running back to Magnolia in shame."},{"name":"Kiko Japanese Cuisine","address":"110 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is one of my favorite restaurants.
