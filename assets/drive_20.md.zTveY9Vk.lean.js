My husband and I have been coming to Myers & Chang since Karen Akunowicz, executive Chef, was featured on Top Chef and we realized she was based out of Boston and it's basically been a love affair since. The food is sort of like an Asian inspired Tapas Restaurant, where you to get the chance to try various small plates. I also think it's important to note they offer:\\n-gluten-free menu options\\n-vegetarian menu options\\n-shellfish-free menu options\\n-nut-free menu options. \\n\\nOn a side note, the Pinapple Ginger Soda is always my favorite in terms of what to drink- you can add a shot of liquor if you want, but honestly, just the soda is really good.  \\n\\n2. They give back to the community. Myers & Chang is happy to help with fundraisers for Boston Public Schools, so basically, this makes me want to eat there even more. \\n\\nI feel like you really can't go wrong with what to order, everything is deliciousness.

The toppings are \\"free\\" and you can choose as many as you want. That makes the burger massive and even with my big eating mouf, I could barely take a bite! Most reviewers have listed out their toppings, but I very much enjoyed the mushrooms. \\n\\nThe burger was oh so greasy, which was alright, but it was dripping! The burger is definitely good and all the fixins you get make it better. However, for some reason, I was unable to finish this burger. I had to force myself to take the last few bites. This is not because the burger was huge nor was it that it was bad tasting... maybe it was too salty? I don't know, something about it made me unable to finish it, which is the only reason I did not give it four stars. \\n\\nThe fries are amazing. They have three sizes and I chose the 1-2 serving size so that I could share. It was massive! and sooo good. Nice crispiness, perfect flavor, and I only wanted more! Must be cocaine fries. \\n\\nWhat they don't tell you about the burger is that the Mooyah burger is a double patty and the junior is a single patty.

I has this dish at a different brew pub down in San Diego and it wowed me with it's bold flavors and texture contrasts. I really had high hopes for the cracklins and the cracklins themselves are mighty tasty. But they dress them with various cold items and a salsa-type sauce, which makes the cracklins cold and soggy and no one wants that! So if you order them, I recommend getting everything on the side.

Considering I live 2 miles straight down Chattahoochee Blvd from FLIP, I should have been there on day 1, but instead I decided to wait until the day the AJC posted their official review of FLIP, giving it 4 stars. Congratulations are in order for Richard, Mark, all the other chefs, as well as the rest of the team at FLIP. \\n\\nCongratulations may have been in order for the staff at FLIP, but the only thing in store for the diners last night was a significant wait! We arrived around 7:15 last night and it was straight jammed! The restaurant was full, the bar was full, the waiting area was full, the sidewalk outside was almost full. \\n\\nBut we had resolve and an undeniable hunger for burgers, so I pushed my way to the bar and ordered a few drinks while we waited. \\n\\nThis gave me plenty of time to check out the interior, as well as do some fantastic people watching. \\n\\nThe space is very clean - white tables, white walls, trendy aluminum bar stools for the center tables, and the long bar featuring an alternate pattern of mirrors and flat panel TV's, both surrounded by the same style of classic white frame.  The very large booths on the left side of the restaurant have a  duplicate of the bottom booth inverted and stacked towards the ceiling, \\"flipped\\", to create a divider, separating the booths and creating the most private and special spots to sit in the restaurant. Unless you're a hipster and want to sit at the burger bar facing the open window to the kitchen where you can watch the staff cook, top, present, and prepare the numerous burgers flying out of there by the minute. \\n\\nAfter 80 minutes or so we were seated, ready to devour anything coming our way. Our friendly waitress arrived quickly to take drink orders while we figured out how we were going to tackle this menu. Sharing was definitely on the docket. \\n\\nA friend and I split four burgers, and the two ladies chose one for themselves. The total burger order included a bun mi (a play on the Vietnamese Banh Mi), the turf n earth (mushroom patty for the veggie), the butcher cut, the southern, the p√¢t√© melt, and a regular flip burger. As sides we ordered the sweet potato tots, the fried rutabaga and the french fries. \\nWe were so ravenous, when the food quickly came out, I started eating so quickly I wasn't even thinking about the flavors or the quality, so I had to quickly slow down and pace myself.\\n\\nWe cut the burgers in half for sharing, so I ended up getting four halves to try, plus a few bites of the turn n earth, which was quite interesting, and definitely earthy. I'm not a huge mushroom fan, so I wasn't in love with it, but when you got a bite of the goat cheese along with a big hunk of the warm, soft (but firm) bun, it was very enjoyable. In fact, the bread was a major contribution to all the burgers. Some may have other favorite styles of burger delivery system, but I thought the buttery brioche style was the perfect accompaniment. \\n\\nOnce I slowed down I began to take note of the differences of the meat and how the flavors were working together. The blue cheese was just the right amount on the butcher cut, as was the pimento cheese on the southern. \\nThe side dishes were also very notable. The fries were short, but perfectly crisp with a homemade smoked mayo that brought be back to Belgium.\\nThe onion rings were quite good, but not nearly as notable as the sweet potato tots, which stole the show. Though you don't receive a ton of them, they were perfectly crispy, large, and of awesome sweet potato substance (not like regular tot-filler). \\n\\nLastly I tried a few sips of the krispy kreme milkshake, which as I had heard, was not as overpowering as you might think at first. The flavor was definitely recognizable, and the flavor and texture perfectly in balance. \\n\\nOverall I thought FLIP was outstanding. While I wasn't amazed with every burger, I absolutely loved the butcher's cut and the p√¢t√© melt. Pimento cheese is one of my favorite's so that was also a big-time winner in my book. The bun mi was a little disappointing - just a bit too non-descript for me. But the meat was consistently juicy, flavor, and cooked too my preference (medium or so). \\n\\nAs far as value goes, FLIP is also a winner. Our table ordered 6 burgers, 3 sides, 1 milkshake, 2 beers, and a cocktail. Split evenly with tax & tip, this totaled to about $25 per person.\\n\\nI felt like for the level of the cuisine, and the quantity of food, it was well worth it. We ended up eating too much, but I don't regret it, and I had a blast. The energy level was high, burgers were flying out the kitchen, and smiles were on everyone's faces as they left.

Coffee was pretty dope, probably one of the best coffee in town. but the macha latte was little blah.

Before you say anything, check out the menu. Here it goes, photos look great but when you actually see your burger which you paid over $5, its kind of disappointing. Yes most of you will say its about \\"quality\\" then quantity and I agree but we are talking about a Burger. \\n\\nI'm all about paying big dollars for a steak but for a thin piece of burger patty...well...\\n\\nI just wish the portions were bigger. Sorry for starting so negative but the taste of the burger was good. Patty was nicely flavored. The first bite, I honestly thought the meet was a bit salty but after a few more bites, it wasn't bad. Probably cause I finished my burger in less then 8 bites. I had to try there chocolate shake. Wow. Probably the best shake I had. Again the size for a $5 shake but it was good. \\n\\nOverall the portions are a bit small but you do get a tasty meal.

They had so many specials it was impossible to keep track - they all sounded so good! The waitress was super knowledgeable of everything on the menu and all the wine selections. They had a list of bottles for $30 and I loved the bottle of Pinot Noir she suggested. \\n\\nWe started out with an app that wasn't on the menu. It was literally a log of provolone wrapped with prosciutto and fried, YES I SAID FRIED. It was redic and delicious. I ended up ordering the spinach linguine w shrimp, tomatoes & lemon. It was really light and the portion was perfect. Thank God it wasn't a bigger portion because I would have eaten the entire thing regardless of how much they gave me! So thank you Monica's for the spared calories. My boyfriend ordered a veal dish. Think veal sized meatballs (2) stuffed with cheese. He loved it and I tried a bite and the veal was cooked perfectly and hello - it was stuffed with cheese! We skipped dessert, but, all of the desserts are made in-house so I'm sure they are amazing. \\n\\nWe will def be returning to Monica's sometime in the near future to try as many items on the menu as possible. If you are going with a party of 2 make sure to tell them you want your own table. They had 4-top tables that they were seating 2 parties of 2 at.

It's from 5-6:30 and has $4 beer specials and a few $6 cocktails as well as some shared plates at around half price. Downside is that it's at the bar area and patio only which doesn't leave much room for larger crowds. I'd say there's only seating for about 25 people in the bar/patio area combined. That said, the staff was very accommodating of us moving around and changing seats and for that I am very appreciative. \\n\\nI know one of the reasons they're up north now is to delve more into the cocktails.

My wonderful companion Becky takes this a step further by sticking her tongue out at children and snarling at those uppity pampered dogs. La Merce takes the fun out of this because it's just off of Park Avenue and when you order something chances are you'll forget about people watching. That's because the food is so beautiful to behold and the atmosphere is so calming that even Becky becomes a civilized person as a result. Yes, this is the same Becky that bathes in swamp water and heads straight to the nearest crab boil, dripping with moss and swamp muck because she'll crave crawfish after wrestling gators. \\n\\nLa Merce has this incredible way of presenting their dishes. Becky snorted at the fact that La Merce has \\"bang bang shrimp\\" on their menu, commenting that she'll bang bang the waiter's shrimp for a filet o' fish, but when she laid her piggy little eyes on the lattice pattern of the laid shrimp and the serene flower petal like portion of octopus Carpaccio, her eyes welled up with tears of joy. When she tasted the assortment of meats and cheeses on the cutting board of the WP Appetizer her eyelids became frickin Moses parting the red sea because something about this place was touching Becky on a deeper level- past her animalistic facade; touching her inner child. See, Becky doesn't talk about herself much but she's part Catalan and this food communicated to her the rich history of \\"Barthelona\\" as she calls it. The paella retold her the story of how her great great great grand father wrestled with the Kraken for the ingredients suitable to represent his undeterred love for Becky's great great great grand mother, Ella. \\n\\n\\"Para Ella,\\" were the words Becky uttered and she sobbed and savored the saffron and the stores of the sea. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, Becky is still an animal, and if you see her in the streets you should probably steer clear.

The hostess could not have been less welcoming. She advised that they had been super busy and although she could seat us, could not guarantee the kitchen would be able to provide us a meal. We had walked a mile (it was a beautiful night) to get there so we didn't have many options at this point. I said that we needed to eat so could she please confirm with the kitchen that they would serve us. She did so but not without attitude. When my husband asked if we could be seated outside she promptly said no way-luckily another (much nicer) hostess overheard and said that there was in fact a table for us. As it turns out the wait wasn't that long for food. The mushroom arrancini was delicious which is about the only positive thing I can say about the place. The chicken special I ordered was overcooked, as was the pasta that accompanied it. The drinks are overpriced-$12 for a vodka/tonic?! If they're going to charge those prices they should at least have the proper mug for the Mule cocktail they offer. There are so many other better places in town, I certainly won't be going back to Art's.

It would have been better if the batter was still somewhat crispy rather than spongy. Perhaps it had been sitting too long? The beef dish I did not like AT ALL.. It had a very weird  after taste and I didn't care for the texture of the beef itself.  I don't know, the beef over all, was, well, kinda creepy, if that makes any sense.  The chow mein was ok, but the pork in it seemed like it would have been better if it had been barbecued instead. At first I thought \\"well, it's different\\", but as I ate it, I realized I really didn't care for much of it. Even my BF, who is less picky than me wasn't sure of it. It all had the same underlying flavour/after taste to it, and was also VERY salty...and I like salt!  Not to mention I found it to be a wee bit overpriced. It was $60 including a $5 tip.  Five days later, it was still sitting in the fridge with the beef barely half gone, and almost all the chow mein remained. I did eat  most of the beans 'cause even when they're not great, I love spicy beans! \\n\\nI would give this place 2.5 stars, but I can't, so 2 it is.

Os recepcionistas nos ofereceram o bar at√© que a nossa mesa estivesse pronta. Demorou, mas como o local estava animado e fomos bem recebidos os minutos passaram r√°pido e n√£o percebemos. \\n\\nNos sentamos em uma mesinha (bem) pr√≥xima de outros clientes que foram super educados o jantar todo. O nosso servidor foi maravilhoso e mais que gentil e atencioso. Pedimos um prato de black ink pasta com tanta pimenta e era quase imposs√≠vel sentir o gosto e um salm√£o grelhado maravilhoso. Al√©m de toda a pimenta, amamos tudo, o servi√ßo mais do que a pr√≥pria comida! \\n\\nOntem quando voltamos l√°, a comida continua maravilhosa mas o atendimento foi P√âSSIMO. Fizemos uma reserva dessa vez. Chegamos l√° n√£o tinha ningu√©m para nos receber. Tinha uns 3 ou 4  servidores e bartenders conversando e rindo no bar, olhando para a nossa cara sem pelo mesmos dizer \\"Seja bem vindo aguarde um momento a sua \\"hostes\\" j√° vem!\\" N√£o parecia que elas trabalhavam  ali. Foi muito constrangedor. \\n\\nAo sentarmos, a gar√ßonete veio em seguida e nos deu o menu com pressa. Pedimos um prato de Udon (veio com mais cebola do que o vinagrete que eu fa√ßo aqui em casa) e um com polvo picante detalhe: a gar√ßonete *garantiu* n√£o ser t√£o picante e que o tanto de pimenta poderia ser alterado.Perguntamos por experi√™ncia (gostamos de pimenta mas n√£o tanto ao ponto de n√£o sentir o sabor da comida) . Quando sequer t√≠nhamos terminado de falar, ela virou as costa em um movimento brusco e saiu marchando. Nos olhamos e j√° sab√≠amos que o atendimento seria daquela maneira √† noite toda. Dito e feito a gar√ßonete n√£o teve algum tipo de carisma ou aten√ß√£o durante o tempo todo que est√°vamos l√°. Depois de comer um pouco da comida, percebemos que tomar mais uma cerveja seria uma ideal para remediar pois as nossas bocas estavam amortecidas por conta da pimenta e j√° era tarde pra pedir outro prato e iria demorar.

I believe it was on a Saturday, the restaurant was packed and the vibe of the place was great. We got there without reservation and were greeted very well. The receptionists offered us the bar until our table was ready. It took a while but as the place was lively and we were welcomed the minutes went by fast and we did not realize it.\\n\\nWe sat on a small table (well) next to other diners who were super polite the whole dinner. Our server was wonderful and more than kind and attentive. We ordered a plate of black ink pasta with so much pepper and it was almost impossible to taste it and a wonderful grilled salmon. In addition to all the spiciness, we loved everything, the service more than the food itself!\\n\\nYesterday when we got back there, the food remains wonderful but the service was TERRIBLE  . We made a reservation this time. We arrived there had no one to greet us. There were about 3 or 4 servers and bartenders chatting and laughing at the bar, looking at our faces without saying \\"Welcome, wait a moment, your hostes are coming!\\" It did not look like they worked there. It was very embarrassing/awkward. \\n\\nUpon sitting down, the waitress came shortly and gave us the menu in a hurry. We ordered a Udon dish (came with more onion than the vinaigrette I make here at home) and another with spicy octopus detail: the waitress * made sure * it was not so spicy and that the much of spicy could be changed. We had previous experience (We like spicy but not so much to the point of not feeling the taste of the food). When we were not even finished speaking, she turned her back  in a sudden movement marched out. We looked at each other and already knew that the service would be that way all night. Said and done!!  the waitress did not have any kind of charisma or attention during the entire time we were there. After eating a little of the food, we realized that drinking another beer would be an ideal remedy because our mouths were numb  by the amount of spice and it was too late to order another dish and it would take too long to arrive. We ordered the beer which only arrived when we were finishing the dinner. Bottom line, It was the worst service we had. In addition to having our night ruined the restaurant lost two customers.

I have had this dish before, and Truva's version was far more savory.  Their bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar blend was perfect and light.

Now you are saying to yourself, what the hell are you saying, Mike, come on spit it out! Here's the deal, when I want a life altering steak, I reserve a spot at Del friscos in the Seaport a month in advance. I spend a boat load of money, but I drool for 3 days after I leave because the steak is THAT good. So a few months ago I said to our waiter, if they took this business plan of amazing attentive service and super high quality products and pedestrianize it, you would have a home run. The waiter says to me, well, great minds must think a like because Del Friscos grille is coming to Chestnut Hill and that's exactly what it is. BAM! So here is where the selfishness comes into play, I can get a reservation anytime of any day. I walk up the stairs and from start to finish I am treated like the most important person in the building. Then when the food comes, a perfect harmony of flavors and textures explode in your mouth. There is a real easy way to explain this phenomenon, I call it \\"Never a dull moment\\", now here you go asking yourself again, what the hell is this guy rambling about now! Here it is, Never a dull moment is a phenomenon at Del friscos grille where your sense of smell is being tantalized the whole time, triggering you to salivate, while your server and his eager assistants continue to engage you consuming any dead air that may be between you and your \\"date\\". As a symphony of worker bees head to your table and displace the most beautiful plated dishes you will see, complimented by another explosion of concentrated smells, immediately interrupted by your \\"date\\" eagerly grabbing for the art and you saying, HOLD ON, lets take a picture, followed by hurry up it smells so good I cant wait! Pause. Now picture your favorite song playing in your head as the cymbals crash with every bite swallowed in the perfect above mentioned harmony. Pause. Now realize that the music is really playing, the food is really orgasmic and your server smiles because he knows the team in the kitchen knows what they are doing. Pause. The check comes. Panic overcomes your mind because you know the damage you just did at Del friscos last week and you realize that you just had a mouth orgasm and you know that sh*t don't come cheap. You open it and all of a sudden: HOLY CRAP, you exclaim! Your date says oh man we did some damage huh, we can split it I feel bad. You shut the bill with your card in it, look up at your date and wink at them as you say no baby this ones on me.

Here's everything I got to try:\\n-Assorted Gorditas: I liked them, I was half-expecting something like the Taco Bell gorditas, but these were more like fritters (without the fried exterior). Each one had a different \\"filling\\" as well. A good shareable appetizer.\\n-Grilled Corn w/ Lime, Cayenne, and Cotija Cheese: Good - but fairly standard. Go to any Mexican restaurant on BuHi and you can get the whole corn (it was two halves of a half cob) and you can get the entire cob for the same price.\\n-Pork Belly Rice Bowl: The pork belly was the star of this dish - it's probably the best pork belly I've had (at a non Korean restaurant) yet - well-cooked, tender, flavorful. It sat atop some steamed rice and a mix of steamed bell peppers. \\n-Tacos: We ordered quite a few, as they were pretty small (\\"size of your palm\\", as described by the server). We ordered the fish, pork belly, wild boar, ribeye duck, and Baja fish. They were all tasty, but really only the pork belly was a standout. \\n\\nThe price range is decent, but keep in mind they're tapas sized so you best order a few dishes to keep off starvation.

Creamed corn is so rich and goes well with the cornbread too (you can make a desert out of it as when put together it's somewhat of a southern take on tres leches cake). The line isn't slow so don't let the length fool you. I also recommend picking up some of their tangy BBQ sauce to go, because even though I didn't use much on my food, it is delicious and can hel fill the gap when you somehow have mediocre BBQ from elsewhere."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't go to church, but if you look up John 3:16 in the Bible and replace \\"son\\" with \\"Terry Black's Barbecue\\", you would understand the religious experience I just had eating there.

However the verdict is still out on the actual burger.\\n\\nWe went around 1:30 on a Sunday and the place was PACKED..and like other reviewers said it was freakishly efficient. The vibe of the place is cafeteria cool + BOOZE = win. That's the kinda math I like.\\n\\nWe ordered the MagicShroom, the Llano Pablano with grilled onions, fries & a chocolate shake spiked with mint Baileys. Yes, it was that kind of day.\\n\\nBurgers come out and they didn't grill my onions so I sent it back. It appeared fixed within a minute or two. I took my first bite and noticed where's the bacon?! I open the burger and one sad little soggy piece of bacon...I am very sad-roo at this point. I immediately show the waitress, cuz let's face it I really just ordered the burger because it came with bacon. \\n\\nAnd if there were a burger made entirely of bacon I would have ordered it! but I digress........... \\n\\nShe sweetly brings me a cup of bacon. YES - A CUP OF BACON. JACKPOT, CHECK-MATE, Happyroo ensues. This is where my cartoon falling in love-happy eyes meet the cup of bacon, and then I look over and meet my husbands envious-jealous eyes of this treasure. Like I thought the bacon made it. It was good. We both liked our burgers but weren't blown away by them.\\n\\nThe fries however...are the fries, fry-freaks dream of. Crisp, fluffy, and most importantly every bite is seasoned to perfection. Not too greasy, not too salty, just right. Next time I will definitely get a large fry. Trust me you won't want to share. They also have some fun and delicious house-made ketchup. One was chipotle the other was bbq. Both great. \\n\\nMilkshake time! A solid milkshake, generously spiked with Baileys. I noticed right away after the first sip that it left a clean finish. I know this sounds weird..but let me explain...there wasn't a weird processed chocolate syrup taste like most shakes. The kind that leaves a weird washed out chocolate taste on your tongue.This one is legit.\\n\\nThey had some really cool cocktails on the board. I would definitely come back to try those with some yummy fries. I may or may not order a burger again...unless...YEP, you guessed it.

I really like the added touch of the diakon radish pickles.  Speaking of pickles, I also can't avoid getting their mixed pickle plate.  Be warned, the jalapeno pickles can be quite spicy!\\n\\nBe sure to try one of their signature cocktails.  They offer a variety of interesting mixtures.  I really like their Asian mojito made with soju.  \\n\\nThe prices aren't cheap, but I like knowing they put pride into their cooking and use locally sourced products.\\n\\nAnother restaurant highlight is their dollar oyster night.  After 8 pm on Sundays you can get dollar oysters (limit of 12 per person)--definitely a steal if you're in the area and love oysters!\\n\\nUsually when I eat at Myers and Chang I get pretty full.

I got the 04 Platter which came with brisket and smoked sausage. The brisket was really good, especially for a diner, but the sausage was top notch.

My wife had the Badass Bacon & Eggs which features a thick-cut piece of bacon. she gave me a piece of it and I immediately wanted to take the whole thing. Our only complaint is their soda situation. We ordered soda and they brought us cans. If you don't have a fountain machine, that's fine, but you should charge accordingly. I think we paid $2 each for a can of soda.

We had a 6:30 reservation for 5, but wanted to get there early for a few drinks during happy hour.  We arrived at 5pm, and enjoyed a few drinks and appetizers before dinner.  The bartender was great.  He was very friendly, and took great care of us.  He was able to recommend a few different wines for my wife, and was sopt on with his reommendations.  His performance was the highlight of the night, and deserves recognition for his efforts.\\n\\nWhen we went to dinner, everything that was done well prior by the bartender was negated by the rest of your staff.  \\n\\nThe bartender knew of my wife's birthday and our reservation and went out of his way to check to see if our table was ready.  However, when we went to the hostess to be seated, she whispered to another hostess, and made us wait 5-10 minutes for our table to be setup.  Her genral tone was unpleasant and came off quite rude.  But she wasn't the biggest issue of our visit.\\n\\nThe low point of the night award goes to our waiter.  After sitting for 10 minutes, he showed up and asked us, \\"So are you guys ready?\\".  He did not introduce himself, nor offer us anything to drink.  We went ahead and ordered food.  Several minutes later, one of my friends had to flag him down to get anything to drink, at which point he came back to our table and took our drink order, yet he didn't apologize for the error (and actually seemed quite put off by us being there).  When taking our drink order he jokingly offered one of us Gatorade for some reason, which seemed strange.  I still do not know why he thought that would amuse us.  \\n\\nOur food came out rather slow, but tasted good.  No big issues there.\\n\\nAt the end of dinner, I was told by the bartender to mention to our waiter it was my wife's birthday and she would receive dessert at no charge.  I mentioned the birthday, but was not offered dessert, or even a \\"Happy Birthday\\" in response.  Rather than press the issue, we decided leaving as quickly as possible was the best decision.\\n\\nMy overall impression of our waiter's performance was that because he knew he would charge us gratuity, he did not need to focus on our table, or provide any sort of professional service.  I did notice that he was more than capable of refilling drinks, smiling, and providing prompt service to his smaller tables.  To give him a pass for having a bad night doesn't seem appropriate.  He was intenially negligent, and created a memorable birthday celebration for my wife, but for all of the wrong reasons.  \\n\\nWe spent over $50 at the bar, and another $125 at dinner.  When I spend $175 for dinner, that comes with expectations that were clearly not met. \\"\\n\\nDespite the efforts of the bartender, 1 star."},{"name":"There","address":"305 Brookhaven Ave, Ste 1200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here a total of 5 times and have been amazed every time.

Well, in that time, I decided to try them again. Only this time, we decided to do carryout, which is available. They told me 30 minutes. Now, after years of carryout, you learn a thing or two, mainly that whatever time they give you, the meal will actually be prepared and ready to go in half that time. So, I arrive 20 minutes later, and there's my carryout, waiting for me at the bar. I walk up to the bartender and politely address him with a \\"hey, how's it going?\\" He sighs, and, never looking up from the POS monitor, asks what I need (mind you, it wasn't \\"how may I help you?,\\" but rather an indifferent \\"whaddya need?\\"). I tell him my name and that I'm here for the carryout. He then slides the bag towards me, then tells me the total. I hand him my credit card, he swipes it, and, as I reach out to take the card back, he just drops it on the bar instead of handing it back to me (a gesture that can only be performed by a blackjack dealer and still be acceptable; for everyone else, it's just downright rude). He then tears off the receipt, slides it and a pen towards me, then stalks off somewhere else. On the receipt, it lists space for a tip. Normally, I throw in a few dollars, even for carryout (which is absurd on principle, since they technically didn't wait on me, so I won't go in a full 20%, but generally, the staff is working hard, so a buck or two is okay), but this d-bag must've been out of his mind if he thinks this will end with a gratuity. So I leave nothing, grab my meal, and leave.\\n\\nWhen I get to my car, I open both meals to see if the orders were right (I've been burned in the past), only to find that my Ron Burgundy is nearly cold to the touch. I then head back inside and speak to a manager, who insists that I must've taken too long to get here; I explain that I was actually early, and that by the time I would've made it home, the burger would be a brick. He offers to \\"heat it up real quick,\\" which means that he'll just throw it in the microwave. I tell him no, that I don't want it anymore, and that a refund for just the burger would suffice (my wife's sandwich and both dessert donuts were fine as far as I could tell). He offers to make another one if I was willing to wait. I then explain the cold reception by his bartender and that I didn't want to spend an extra minute in this establishment ever again, and that he, along with the other supervisors/owners, should hop on this website every now and again and take note of the reviews detailing the lousy customer service. I don't need to make a friend when I go out to eat, but I don't need to be treated like some sort of nuisance, who was simply darkening this establishment's doorstep in order to complete a monetary transaction for services rendered. That's just CRAZY!! So, with another exasperated huff, the manager eventually refunds my card, and I depart.\\n\\nWorthy of note: the dessert donuts are still consistently good. But for that, I'll take the airstream from now on. The rumors about the terrible staff is entirely true. And apparently, asking for carryout will incur a wrath even more spiteful than what you would experience by dining in."},{"name":"Wild Chix & Waffles","address":"7714 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Chicken and waffles.

The pieces were really big and you get a little bit of everything wing, drumstick, breast etc.\\n\\nEnded up getting the Mac and cheese side and the fries.

Like a previous reviewer, I gave 'em the cappuccino test.  \\n\\nBut first, the store itself... It is indeed very Starbucksian in appearance, but that's OK, I don't need a lot of art or \\"texture\\" to enjoy a good cappuccino.  It is a bit sterile, but really enjoyed a stool by a nice sunny window.  The employees all seem happy and friendly, which is a sign of good management.  I heard the person taking orders help the customers in front of me decide what to get, happily explaining menu items.  My order was taken cheerfully and quickly, and my t-shirt was complimented.  Nothing wrong with that.\\n\\nThe cappuccino:  I'll give it a solid B+, overall.  The flavor was best as soon as it was handed to me, with a good nutty / toasty body.  The milk foam had good structure and sweet flavor, and I got a nice manually poured flower-ish design.  As the coffee cooled, the flavor fell a bit flat.  It never got bitter or anything of that nature, just less complex and more, well, Starbucks.  On the whole, it was quite enjoyable.\\n\\nAs a point of comparison, I gave Octane (a few miles away) an A.  Maybe it's a matter of Counter Culture beans vs. Batdorf & Bronson, or maybe at Dancing Goats the baristas are a bit less obsessive.  But I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Dancing Goats, especially if you're across the street at Farm Burger.  :-)"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Every time I've been to Hopdoddy's it's been a great experience!

WTF???  The menu says cheddar cheese.  Not faux cheese.  But whatever.  The crab cakes were delish.  \\n\\nAnd normally I don't choose to wear flats when I go out cause I am a strappy heeled sandals kind of gal when hitting the bars, but once I tried to go after I got off work at my pt job (in retail) and didn't have time to go home, so I was wearing flats.

The boy wanted a sazerac and I wanted cornbread, so we headed to Southland Whiskey Kitchen. Though things started off slow (we went unnoticed without water for a bit, but they gave the boy a free, generous, and delicious sazerac so no hard feelings), the meal made up for it. The cornbread was really good. My favorite cornbread is at a joint in Salt Lake, but this was a very good effort. Light, moist interior to gobble up with honey butter spread. My only complaint about the cornbread is that the exterior was somewhat overcooked. We both got burgers and fries.  The burger was perfectly well-done and came with fresh ingredients. Though my burger came with habanero chiles and spicy mayo/sauces (on the side), it was not \\"hot\\" at all. I thought the chiles were sweet red pepper bits. The fries were too salty for my taste (disclaimer: we use very little salt on our home cooked meals), though I did like the cut and the tenderness. \\n\\nServers were attentive and friendly after the initial miscommunication among the staff. The manager was also attentive. I loved the southern style design and general dining layout. The use of space was great, though my favorite feature of the restaurant were the unique lighting fixtures.\\n\\nUltimately, it was a very good meal and would've been great if we had ordered a signature dish such as the fried chicken.

Regardless, the flavours are there to create that harmonious and delicious Hainanese taste.

The line was sloppy, people were just standing around randomly (not queued up), newcomers deliberately barged right up to the counter and were served, etc. When I finally ordered my donut, I had to wait, because they were pulling orders ahead of mine. What? I bought a donut. Pick up my donut and hand it to me. Five seconds, done, out the door. But no, I have to wait for other boxes to be prepared. Ridiculous. And what's with the silly domed plastic clamshell my donut came in? It just went into the first garbage can I found on the street.

Slightly tough and chewy, not the crispy-outside-delicate-inside texture you probably want. Bland flavor. At least it wasn't raw at the center the way a really bad fritter is, nor was it greasy.

Ever pay $3 for a pastry at a bakery and end up disappointed? Sure you have. Ever had a bad cup of coffee for $2.50? Of course. Ever had two or three horrible Safeway donuts and wish you hadn't?

Santarpio's follows a typical rule of thumb with Italian pizza places (in Italy) -- the most outdated/scariest interior usually has the best pizza. They don't have to buy fancy furniture to get you there, the food simply does. Now why is Santarpio's so great? Well, the staff is entertaining for one. The ratio of cheese to sauce on the thin pizza is perfect. And toppings like sausage and garlic, just make my day. And by sausage, I mean homemade sausage...not the snappy stuff that you get at shaws. What's even better is the sausage on the grill -- perfect spice.

I would order 3 of these to complete the antipasti.  The seasonings in the mix is addictive. I'm going to dream about it tonight.\\n\\nSalad:\\n- Mista Salad - Simple, what you think it's going to be is what it is. 'nuff said\\n\\nEntrees:\\n- Mushroom Pizza - I didn't try this but my friends loved it and really liked the arugala (touched with lemon citron) on top.\\n- Braised Pork Shank - The sauce was slightly sweet but good.  The pork was cooked very well and tender but there wasn't much meat to it.\\n- Gemelli Pollo - You could tell this was freshly prepared and everything worked.  I was skeptical about the walnuts but they're soft yet firm so the texture works and gives it an added \\"umph\\".  thumbs up\\n- Chicken Saltimbocca - Yum.  I really like saltimbocca and there aren't many places in Austin that prepare it (or, prepare it well).  Saltimbocca can be prepared differently (small pieces, separate pieces. wrapper/not wrapped).   This was 1 nice half breast wrapped in prosciutto & it was very tasty.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nConsidering it was opening night, we expected the worse but that's not what happened.

The steak was properly cooked to temp, and while not high-end steakhouse-quality, it was still a pleasurable accompaniment for some great red wines.  Overall, good, tasty, well-made \\"red sauce\\" neighborhood Italian cuisine, like you would hope to find.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and attentive (we were served by the hilarious sous chef who grew up in the area the first time, and by newly hired Michelle on our second visit).  The owners were in the house and the husband Robin was very personable and fun.  It is a small, comfortable space, but can be a tad noisy if crowded, but still pleasant.  There is a muted TV over the small bar (obviously not serving alcohol).\\n\\nYeah, Rino's across the street is famous thanks to \\"wonder-awful TV chef/bloated punk-pop hedgehog person Guy Fieri,\\" (to quote the Globe), but I actually think the food at Saratoga is just as good (especially those meatballs, which leave Rino's in the dust).  And you don't have to wait in line forever to get a table at prime time.\\n\\nAND IT'S LEGAL BYOB, in fact, the only one in Boston (see below for details)!!!  So it deserves 5-stars just for that in my book!\\n\\nHouse wine glasses are serviceable (better than Rino's), but if you really care, bring your own stems like I do.  They also prefer to open your wine, keep it at the bar, and pour it for you, but I convinced them to let us do that ourselves, which we like to do.  Sit along the window, where the ledge make a nice place to put your wine bottles, leaving more space for big plates of food.\\n\\nAs you will see from some earlier reviews, Saratoga originally also offered a selection of Latin dishes (the chef is Latino).  But there wasn't much demand for them in an Italian restaurant, so although they are still listed on the laminated menu, they are no longer available.\\n\\nNote: Their website seems to have been taken over from another restaurant, and wasn't accurate for a long time, but seems to be improving.  For example, there's a link to OpenTable, but you have to call for reservations, although one of the two phone numbers is incorrect.\\n\\nI will definitely be back again to enjoy some good Italian cooking and BYOB wine.\\n\\n[WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BYOB IN MA:\\n\\nIf you know me, then you know that I appreciate a great wine list.  And the very best wine list of all is the one that I have at home!  So if a restaurant will let me BYOB my own wine for dinner, then they immediately shoot to the top in my book.\\n\\nThe only problem is that BYOB is ILLEGAL in ***most*** of Massachusetts.  Grrrr, yes, we are still living in the 19th Century in MA!  But wait, why did I say \\"most?\\"  Well here is where, in typical MA fashion, it gets a bit complicated:\\n\\n1) Massachusetts law states that BYOB is illegal in any restaurant that has a liquor license.\\n\\n2) If a restaurant doesn't have a liquor license, then the legality of BYOB depends on the laws of the city or town in which the restaurant operates.\\n\\n3) But only some towns permit BYOB for restaurants without liquor licenses.  To the best of my knowledge, these include: Brookline, Lowell, Needham, Watertown (requires a BYOB license), Wellesley, Winthrop, and Worcester.  Arlington and Belmont may also be in this category, but I'm still researching that.  If you know of any others, please let me know!\\n\\n4) However, thanks to a newly passed law in Boston, BYOB is legal for restaurants without liquor licenses in some but not all Boston neighborhoods, namely: Allston-Brighton, Charlestown, Dorchester, East Boston, Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain, Mattapan, Mission Hill, Roslindale, Roxbury and West Roxbury.  Such restaurants must be sit-down with waiter service and 30 or fewer seats, and they must have a BYOB license (which only two restaurants have successfully received, Seven Star Bistro in Rosindale, which has since closed, and 300 Saratoga in East Boston).\\n\\n5) By the way, many restaurants will let you BYOB under the table if you ask them (with or without a corkage fee).  However, it is definitely poor form to post about this online since we don't want to get them in trouble for doing us a favor (which occasionally happens, although rarely in my experience).\\n\\nYou are also limited to one 750 mL bottle per person) and the restaurant must seal partially finished bottles in a plastic bag to which they have stapled the receipt if you want to take leftovers home.]"},{"name":"Chef Hung Taiwanese Beef Noodle","address":"4151 Hazelbridge Way, Unit 2800","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Not bad at all....noodles were nice and chewy in all the dishes....but word of advice...don't order the ja-ja-myun....ng!

The competition at the 29th street outdoor shopping district is even more fierce. So many options, not all \\"super\\" healthy but most offer quality food. Sadly, based on my first experience eating at Protein Bar, they don't pass the \\"better than the competition\\" test. Yes, heathy based on the list of ingredients listed on the menu although many of the items although high in protein were equally high in carbs. If you're trying to loose weight and are not running mini-marathons weekly you should pay special attention to the carb and calorie numbers listed for PB's menu items.\\n\\nWhy only two stars? I thought of being generous and giving them three because, after all it was only my first visit. But, it will be my last visit because there was nothing about my meal that made me want to come back.\\n\\nFirst, the cost... $10.49 for my salad - the Southwest Salad. Wow(!) I assumed at that price I'd be taking half home to eat later. Sure it was large, but not overly so. I could have finished is easily in one sitting but I didn't due to reason number two (below). At $10.49, even in Boulder this was too pricey.\\n\\nTwo - the taste. Perhaps it was the Cholula sauce (which I love with other things) that for some reason gave this salad a weird, almost vinegary taste. Perhaps it was the salsa - I could not make out what it consisted of. Perhaps just the fact that everything sort of looked like it had been tossed in a food processor, added to some ground chicken, black beans and chunks of avocado. I digress...The \\"taste\\" was just strange and I didn't much care for it.\\n\\nThree - the presentation. I get that this is a uber-hipster QSR type place and that serving your meal in a recyclable plastic bowl is acceptable but it just didn't look appetizing - getting back to the fact that it all looked like the signature 6 salad mix (the basis for most of their salads) consists of items that were barely recognizable. I'm pretty sure I made out some tiny pieces of broccoli and way to much brown tinged lettuce...You get the picture.\\n\\nSo, too expensive, weird taste, looks unappetizing. This pretty-much sums up my first and last experience at Protein Bar. \\n\\nAs you're leaving the restaurant there is a sign which reminds you to feel good about the fact that you were just good to your body.

I have also mastered a few Iranian dishes. I must say this place might not be the worse persian restaurant, but I personally hope it doesn't get worse than this. First, it's far down Roswell Rd in the back of a Iranian Grocery (which is a whole different complaint). It is in the most raged building with limited parking, but moving along, When you walk in, your first impression is WOW! this is really nice, considering the outside. It appears to be well kept and elegant. Our waitress looks at us from afar, wondering if we're going to eat I guess, until she finally asks us how many, she seats us, and the first thing I noticed; a HUGE flat screen tv over a fire place (hazard) and it's playing food tv (clever), but really? in such a elegant scene, a tv? Is this a cafeteria? So they bring water, w/o straws, and the subzi (fresh chinese basil, mint, goat cheese, fried/oiled walnuts, and radishes/bread platter (very nice). Food was less than average. bland stewed chicken, hidden under a pile of flavorless rice with barberries, and lamb shank floating in broth with dry dill rice, ok the price was decent, but whoever is cooking is watering everything down for who? It's not like Persian cuisine is overly spicy, so what's the deal? Furthermore!! Nothing bothers me more, than if I'm going for persian/indian/mexican/moroccan food I want to hear persian/indian/mexican/moroccan music, and see persian/indian/mexican/moroccan dancing. anyone coming here would assume persian culture is the same as ARAB and it is NOT!!! Persians dance well and their dance is different, why do I need to see some random typical off beat half naked so called belly dancer? I couldn't even enjoy my meal because of the loud arabic music and this chick flancing around in her skinnies off beat. Are you that desperate? if you would just offer consistent quality food, and some popular persian music, you would get my money. Next time I'll try Sufis, or else I'll keep my $60 else where. Also, I seriously doubt it's wise to seat a person wearing a head scarf next to a table of roudy, people drinking and partying. I will NEVER come back, and everyone I meet, I'll bad talk this place simply for the heck of it! I just want to say one more thing, My mother always said you get what you pay for, and seriously, I'm glad their prices weren't too high because we didn't get much, just a show, I wish I had opted for my $9 Harry Potter Movie and Karachi Grill, it would have been more entertaining, and the same price."},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Nice noodles.

The restaurant is also open daily. You are first impressed by the friendly and professional Valet service. When you come around the corner, the casual, stylish d√©cor and bright colors and ambience puts you in a festive, relaxed mood.  The menu is simple and impressive at the same time.  My favorites include the avocado dip appetizer which tastes so fresh and delicious, the salsa Verde, Baha fish tacos, Oyster tacos and pork tamales.  The small-plates style and very reasonable prices was an added bonus. The sizeable drink menu has so many tequila, margarita and cocktail choices and an impressive bar area.  The icing on the cake was the very engaging, caring and warm touch of the General Manager Michael Paul who it felt like, took great care of us while we were there.  The staff who served us was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu options, which a first timer like me needed!

He drank beer, I tried the Vermentino white from the Duchman Winery based in Driftwood (keeping it local, yo), which was so good my Dad switched after finishing his first beer. It's the only local wine they feature, but hands down a great choice. Flourless chocolate torte and orange olive oil cake for desert. \\n\\nAll of our food was delicious, cooked fresh, and very timely during the dinner rush on a Thursday evening.

I figured if I got him close to JJ's, he wouldn't wonder why on earth I would be taking him there for birthday drinks after dinner.  We walked into the Franklin Cafe and there was an hour wait.  Nope, that wasn't going to work.  He then suggested M+C as we had always wanted to eat there and though I knew the restaurant was a little too close to JJ's, I figured I'd find a way to have his back face the window so he wouldn't see guests parking on Washington Street and walking into his party.\\n\\nThe hostess tells us it'll be about 45 minutes so I needed to find a plan for a new quick bite.  We leave and she comes running outside after us saying two seats just opened at the bar.  Perfect.  That never happens.  Then she sits us at the window with both of us directly facing Washington Street.  I try to keep his attention from ever looking outside and then realize, the jig is going to be up soon.  I tell him I want a different table, he tells me I'm crazy, and I push the issue.   Finally I walk up to the hostess, I plead my situation and she replies with a \\"Oh my god, that's not good, let me figure this out quickly\\".  She does and within three minutes she takes us into the back of the restaurant and puts us at the bar counter directly in front of Joanne Chang.  Yeah, that just happened.  The hostess literally saved my ass and then gave us the best seat in the house.  She deserves 10 stars.\\n\\nWe devoured some amazing food (I could eat 100 of the pork buns in one sitting) and we finished off our carafe of sake.

I tried this place for the first time with a friend last night (on a Friday at around 7:30pm). We walked up to the place and there was a line wrapping around the building. I think there must have been 100 people in line waiting. What's confusing is the line to the front door doesn't end. That's only half of the line that you have to wait. There's another enormous line inside that you have to stand at! We waited a total of 50 minutes standing and my feet were in pain by the time we ordered.\\n\\nI was wondering what the hell was up with the \\"line\\" and that's how you order. There is no wait staff coming to your table, so plan on being on your feet for a while. Standing in line and then getting a table is total BS in my opinion. Poor business model keeping people standing that long. \\n\\nSo 50 minutes after arriving, we finally order our food. I got the Greek burger and my date ordered some other burger that I can't recall. The burgers are expensive and don't include fries to be prepared to shell out 12 dollars for a burger, fries, and a drink. \\n\\nThe food arrived at our table and it looked good, but with further examination both of the burgers were loaded with sauce until they were soaking wet which made the bun very soggy. The Greek burger has lamb meat in it and it was not cooked evenly. Parts of it were pink in the middle and parts were cooked all the way through. The meat wasn't spiced enough and was very bland. I don't think they open fire (flame broil) the burgers there and they taste flat-iron cooked. In my opinion flame broiled burgers are better because of the additional flavor the flame grille adds.\\n\\nHere comes the shocking part. \\nWhen I was half way through the burger, I bit into a huge piece of bone and nearly broke my back tooth. It was still hurting my jaw 10 minutes afterward. When I pulled the bone out of my mouth it was about the size of a pinky finger nail. Gross!\\n\\nI called the manager and they apologized, and said that the meat is ground daily and that's why a bone was in there. I told them that the people grinding the meat need to be more careful as to what the hell goes into the grinder.\\n\\nRather than comp my meal they decided to give me these crappy guitar picks so I could return and get 15 dollars off my next meal. I told them that they were lucky that they didn't break my tooth! They should have comped our entire meal for that because biting into a huge bone like that is a big deal breaker, so I don't feel compensated enough for what happened.\\n\\nSo to recap:\\n1. Long lines that make you stand for an hour\\n2. No table ordering\\n3. High prices for what you get\\n4. Sub par flavored burgers\\n5. Bones that break your teeth in the meat.\\n\\nI would say that I probably won't be returning even to eat a free meal after that."},{"name":"Render Coffee","address":"563 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Kinda really like this place!

But it was worth it when it did come because the food was delightful.  The rice was fluffy, the chicken tandoori moist and falling off the bone, and the baingan bhartha was really bangin'.  Gulab jamun was dry and I'll never order that again.  The naan was too doughy and needs to be crispier.

Unfortunately the famed pad thai was 'out of stock' and we had to double order the rice. The vegetables in our curries were barely cooked, we could still feel the crunch of the carrots and the string beans as if they were served to us raw.

Whenever drinks were re-ordered, it took 20-30 minutes for those to come. After asking if we wanted dessert menus, we waiting another 20 minutes for those to even come to the table. The waitress was pleasant enough when she was there, and despite passing our table a multitude of times in between helping us, was quite good at completely ignoring us.

The bread itself was fairly dry while the salty fish and vegetables barely made up for the lack of flavour.  Overall, this was probably our least favorite dish.\\n\\nBlackened Prawn Wedge Salad - $16.95 (4.5/7)\\n\\nWe honestly could not justify the cost of this salad as we had tastier and cheaper wedge salads elsewhere but the presentation itself was fairly nice.  The overall dish was very mediocre. \\n\\nRoasted Beet - $11.95 (5/7)\\n\\nFresh, sweet, soft but crunchy beets made our meal healthy and delicious.  However, this is not really a dish that can be screwed up but once again, Coast's presentation was sublime. \\n\\nSalmon & Avocado Roll - $11.95 (4.5/7)\\n\\nCoast should strictly stick with western-style seafood dishes and stay away from Japanese sushi.  Other than the fish quality itself, the roll was prepared quite poorly.

They were average.\\n\\nSeafood Tower (jumbo prawns, shucked local oysters, dungeness crab, marinated mussels, salmon nigiri) - $28.95 (minimum 2 people per order) (5.5/7)\\nPrawns: These were absolutely massive; definitely comparable to Joe Fortes'!\\n\\nOysters: These were fairly good but incomparable to Rodney's.\\n\\nCrab: The crab did not taste very fresh and we found them quite small.

I went with the classic burger and fries for about ~$11. \\n\\nThe burger was pretty good for fast food but obviously not the best I've had. The fries on the other hand were great. I usually don't enjoy crinkle fries but these were great. They were severed warms and salted generously but not too much.

I asked the manager (at least I think he was a manager) for an apology, which he did through gritted teeth and then immediately asked me if I had ever worked in a restaurant and that this is what we should expect.

I ordered their Frittata special which included eggs, kale, butternut squash, chorizo, ch√®vre and was topped with mixed greens. I was undecided between that and the Paella and while my dish was a solid, 4-4.5, I did ask for some house hot sauce to kick up the flavor a bit. I have to return hungrier next time and try the Paella. While waiting for our food, we each ordered a tasty Hot Toddy. \\n\\nOverall, Medina is a solid choice for brunch. We finished with a waffle each. His waffle had salted caramel and my 2 sauces were wild berry compote and dark chocolate to dip. Maybe the waffles were overhyped, but that was probably the least impressive part of our meal for me. The compote worked well because the waffle seemed a bit dry.

Crust was thin and fresh, corn meal dusted to add a little crunch. The sauce was good mildly spicy and not sweet. I cannot stand sweet pizza sauce it should be outlawed. Just right amount of cheese, and the all-beef pepperoni was tasty. Pie was cooked just right. I like the cheese slightly browned and bubbly. \\n\\nInside it's ho-hum but no need for frills.

They also have great happy hour prices on beers (or ciders, if you're me). The food can be great, love the huevos rancheros, the burgers are fantastic... it would be lovely if they had gluten-free bread at all, but I can't really complain about that since that's hard to find at most places.

Drinks can take a while, but they're worth it, so I don't mind - they could probably use a second espresso machine.

Decent view of Green Belt is fairly pleasant. The decor was simple sophisticated. The restaurant has a weird entrance, that places you right into the dining area Kinda odd IMO, I think you should provide a little buffer zone between your patrons and the outside world when they're dining. WE, didn't get placed in this room but I would be annoyed if we had. \\n\\nThe service was solid. The waiters were all standing around because we came almost at the very beginning of their dinner. (Upon later reflection I think coming early might be a good choice in that you ideally get everyone full of energy and not stressed by a packed house so you should get great service in all aspects.) The hostess has to practically yell at one of the waiters to seat us, which  wasn't a big deal but it was the start of a couple oddities with the staff that night.\\n\\nWe get seated and our waiter will be with us shortly. We get some other guy that explains to us he's not our waiter but would still wish to get our water preference. Relatively quickly Nikki shows up and the meal begins. We start with lobster bisque. The flavor is pleasant, cream, sherry, seafood, but overall it was a bit on the watery side. I feel it should have more of a creamy consistency. You should feel guilty having a bowl and quite frankly it was not of the caliber I would expect. \\n\\nNikki recommended a wonderful white wine by the glass, the wine was clean, crisp, light, slightly sweet and perfect for seafood.\\n\\nThe bread came out piping hot with butter, a sour dough, with a very crunchy outside and soft, heavy density on the inside. The person that gave it out seemed almost angry as he walked around silently giving out bread. Another odd moment.\\n\\nMoving on to appetizers, we shared tempura scallops with asparagus, shitake mushrooms, onions, Sirracha, and soy sauce reduction. The dish looked nice, everything was cooked very well. I had mixed thoughts on the end result flavor wise. If you put together a good bite, meaning every flavor on the plate at once, you got a mouth full of asparagus, shitake mushroom, soy sauce reduction, with Sirracha hot sauce and the texture of a tempura battered scallop. I thought, all these earthy/grassy/spicy/strong flavors, while tasty mask the very subtle, light, sweat flavor of what should be the star of the dish...the scallop. However, after picking away and eating the veggies then eating a primarily solitary scallop the flavor progression was wonderful. I had almost saturated my palate with earthy/grassy flavors only to introduce a nicely contrasted scallop that somehow cut through the other flavors despite being traditionally a very mild taste. Another testament to the interesting interactions of food.\\n\\nNext out was our main course which was one of the specials of the day that we decided to split. Walnut crusted Halibut with crab meat on top and a semi sweat savory raspberry reduction. Nikki didn't serve us our entree for some reason, and the girl that did serve us plopped down a special on one plate and a hot empty plate in front of me. Offering no assistance to split the entree, nor did they even provide a spoon to help us do it ourselves. I was in a good mood and didn't want to fuss but that was extremely annoying in hindsight, also, if it was indicated we wanted to split something they could easily have just given us both half portions. The special was pretty good, how ever the walnut crust got a little burnt in the pan which with walnuts seems to give a very bitter flavor and since the sauce was on one plate only I ate most of mine with out that sauce. Shame really that lack of consideration for a customer should hinder a dish being fully appreciated. It was good, but overall, honestly, I could do the same dish at home. \\n\\nThe truffled mac and cheese was the big surprise and highlight of the meal.\\n\\nThe bread pudding souffle was not very warm, I understand that a souffle is a delicate thing but does it have to be almost room temperature? The flavor was a solid bread pudding but nothing to rave about.\\n\\nWe also had someone who might have been the chef,( he didn't introduce himself) come out and ask if everything was fine. I didn't have want of anything nor did I have need to complain so I said yes. He then disappeared. Our table being the only one he stopped at. His tone was almost as if he had been told we had a complaint, which we never vocalized a single complaint. The final odd moment.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience but was not given any real reason to return. Nikki (I hope I'm remembering your name correctly) was terrific but the rest of the staff seemed...insincere. The food was solid, but if a side dish and a personal palate revelation are the highlights of a meal... For the price you should expect much more out of any restaurant. \\n\\nThus, Eddie V's...meh."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the brisket and sausage.

I recommend a spot here to check out some great burgers and cocktails. My husband and I went for an early lunch. We got there just past 11:30 and beat out the line. Once inside, there is a bit of a wait. You glance at the menu and figure out your order. As you approach the register, a waiter comes by and takes your order and assigns you a table. You pay at the register and then go sit and wait. Our truffle fries came out first. One order is enough to split between 2-4 people. They were amazing! Yummy garlic and parmesan cheese. They came with a side of a truffle aioli sauce but it was too much truffle for me. They tasted great dipped in ketchup. For drinks, my husband ordered a beer on tap (be warned they come in these large goblet like mugs) and I had the \\"blonde bubbly\\". It was refreshing, sweet with just the right amount of citrus. For burgers, my husband got the mushroom burger with goat cheese. He ate the whole thing and claimed it to be outstanding. I do not eat red meat so I tried the veggie burger (I know, sorry).

We also liked the spicy shrimp and asparagus with romesco sauce.  The artichokes were just a little limp from deep frying, and the housemade chorizo was too dry but the manchego served with the sausage was terrific.  The Spanish omelet was eggs and potatoes - pretty bland but not sure what I kind of excitement I had expected from eggs and potatoes :)\\n\\nI really enjoyed my glass of sangria and would love to have had another but was driving.  \\n\\nHoping to get back ASAP with the hubby who will no doubt be all about the anchovies and olives, rabbit and other stuff that I will pass by.

My husband,10 year old daughter and I arrived on a Sunday evening right before Happy Hour was to end and it was pretty quiet. There were plenty of tables available, but we were told we had only two options- a table right in the middle by the front door, or at the bar. We sat at the table and were served water in glasses fairly quickly. After that, the service went downhill pretty quickly.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food was very good- obviously more Americanized than what we found in Barcelona, but that's ok (because we weren't crazy about the shrimp with their veins anyway!) We had the tortilla and a carafe of the Sangria. Both were yummy- might have to make my Sangria with a cinnamon stick after tasting theirs. My husband chose the paella and really enjoyed it. I had the dinner special, gnocchi with kale- and it was just ok. Our daughter was happy to find a kid's menu as both our kids did struggle in Spain to find something they enjoyed, so she really loved the large meatball that came with the spaghetti.\\n\\nWe had to ask for the \\"famous\\" bread before it was brought to us, and we had to ask for a refill on our waters. Our appetizer plates sat on the table with us so long our server couldn't find a place to put our main course.

Not sure why they were so inattentive- we overheard the table next to us asking where their appetizer was as their server delivered their main courses.\\n\\nWe will definitely be back, but won't expect to be blown-away.

Nor could we justify the baked brie ($12) or a couple of prosciutto wrapped scallops for ($15).  We thought about ordering a $9 burger and fries, cutting it into 4 pieces and calling it sliders, but we just went with simple green salads ($3).\\n\\nMy wife ordered the cedar plank salmon ($19).  It's advertised as \\"flamed over a cedar plank\\", although when it arrived, it looked like it has just been \\"baked on a cedar plank\\".  It was a dried out, flavorless piece of salmon, and there wasn't a char mark to be found on the plank.  On the side was a really gummy \\"risotto\\" and three spears of broccoli raab dunked in butter.\\n\\nI opted for the stuffed meatloaf ($16).

What a superb manager she is! She immediately offered to have it remade; however, as per usual, even after the bread, hubby was starving and wanted to eat, so he refused. She said she would have another entree for him made to-go with another loaf of bread so he could enjoy it the next day and she said she would personally watch as it was cooked to make sure it was cooked to perfection. Great job, Daniela! Perfect way to handle the situation to give me a reason to want to keep coming back! Hubby did state even though his food was slightly burned, it was still pretty good. \\n\\nWhen the check came, we were expecting the full bill for everything, especially since Daniela had remade hubby's entree to-go. However, his entree had been removed from the bill entirely. Way to go again, Daniela! We will, without a doubt, be back! \\n\\nMy question?

I go back and on the card it said that our drinks hadn't been hot so we could get the next ones on the house. But when the barista put up the drinks he said \\"2 hot cappuccinos.\\" Thanks for the sarcasm a-hole. And that wasnt the main reason I was originally unhappy, it was because they weren't cappuccinos. And they still weren't!! 1/2 an inch of foam is not a cappuccino.

Richard Blais has successfully managed to reserve a spot on my \\"Must Eat Atlanta\\" list over and over again, and FLIP is no exception. This is a restaurant you do not want to miss.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the food is excellent. Blais has a way with burgers that cannot be compared; even his simplest burger includes a healthy portion of added condiments. For the less adventurous, you will find many variations of beef burgers to choose from. My favorite beef burger is the RBQ, which comes topped with beef brisket and coleslaw. The menu also features non-beef burgers, like the lamburger and even a tuna tatare burger. Back when Blais first started I got the ossobuco, a veal burger, but I have yet to see it on the menu again. All the burgers come with their own assortment of additions, all intentional. Blais knows how to enhance food in a complementary way, not an overpowering way.\\n\\nBut don't stop at the burgers! The sides are also tasty. FLIP serves up some of the best fried pickles I've had; they're perfectly golden and fried to a crisp. I'm also a big fan of the sweet potato tots - simply delicious. The fries are a crowd pleaser as they come with the biggest portion. If you're lucky, sweetbread will be listed on the menu - snatch them up if you see them!\\n\\nIf you make it this far through the menu, you'll probably be getting full, but trust me when I say this: don't skip the milkshake! FLIP's milkshakes are true treats. Blais has a knack for morphing unassuming meal items, like cereal or foie gras, and turning them into thick, creamy goodness. I always go back for the Nutella and burnt marshmallow milkshake - the crunch of the marshmallow mixed with the smoothness of the milkshake makes for a perfect mouthfeel. And let's not forget that Blais serves his milkshakes steaming with liquid nitrogen! If anything, you should get one just to experience the excitement of receiving a smoking milkshake.\\n\\nI will also say that the food isn't the only good thing about FLIP. Blais knows how to serve up food with flair. The interior design is well thought out and gives off a pretty cool vibe, complete with booths on the ceiling and framed TVs on the wall. The music always appeals to me, moving from alternative rock to electro-pop. The only complaint I have is that the restaurant is generally a little too loud, making it hard to make conversation. However, you'll probably be so into your food that talking may not be possible or necessary.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm always pleased after a meal at FLIP, and I'm always happy to return."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"9600 S Interstate 35, Ste S350","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I love this place I always get really fast Speedy service when I get off work at night from Sarah Anna and Elizett.

The chicken rice was alright. I was expecting the rice to be more aromatic, oily and flavourful. The sauces were great. The salad was average. The lemon honey drink tasted as expected. I tried a bite of the beef brisket. The beef was tender and flavourful with a strong coconut milk undertone.\\n\\nMy main complaint is that they can be a bit more environmentally friendly by using less disposable items. Everything is geared towards take out style.\\n\\nThe restaurant accepts credit card which is a plus. There is ample plaza parking available. They should also try to clean their restrooms daily as I only used the restroom to wash my hands. I can tell by looking at the sink and toilet, it has not been cleaned in weeks.

The kitchen is open and everyone can watch the food being prepared. We arrived on a Monday night and there was about a 20 minute wait. Once a table opened up we sat and our waiter enthusiastically greeted us and took our drink order. Throughout the night the waiter was attentive and helpful with any food questions we had. The menu was varied but there was little for a non-meat eater to consume. I decided to go for it and try the meat dishes and I was not disappointed. Since the dishes were small and there were three of us we ended up eating practically every dish on the menu and we were all more than delighted and satisfied with our choices. Every dish was incredible. \\n\\nAs the night continued people came and left.

I had the baby back ribs as my main couse which had a great smoke flavor and tooth resistance - rather like pasta al dente.  I prefer this texture  rather than the super soft texture others prefer,  so keep that in mind.  As my other side, I had the coleslaw, which I enjoyed because it was light with a nice balance of acidity.                     \\n     My husband had the pulled pork,  which had a great smoke flavor that he enjoyed immensely.  He ordered the baked beans as his main side, which he loved. \\n      The service was prompt,  efficient and friendly. \\n       My only criticism concerns the \\"secret children's menu.\\" We travel with our 7-year old son. When we were seated, he was given the adult menu. Because our son is seven, I doubted that he could eat two pieces of chicken and two sides (the fried ckicken dinner), so I asked whether they make any adjustments for children.   Only after I asked whether they make any adjustments for kids did our server recite the secret kids menu.  While I appreciate the fact that they do accommodate children,  I was put off by the secret nature of it all, particularly given the history and inclusiveness of the barbecue culture.  This restaurant calls itself a  barbecue place - which should be family oriented. It did not market itself as  the French Laundry or another 5 star, fancy adult date night restaurant ( where I would never take my son).\\n   They should embrace families,  not alienate them."},{"name":"Caffe Destino","address":"1339 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went to meet a friend.

Most of the choices come with chashu unless you get the basic ramen.\\n\\nMy bowl of ramen included some cabbage which I felt distracted from the rest of the bowl. They were hunky pieces. If it was shredded cabbage, cut smaller or another veg maybe it would have been better. The noodles are the thick wavy kind. Nice and chewy.

But after seeing the bill I was left wondering who was the one being taken advantage of...?  Hmmm\\n\\nThe Highlights: \\n- The staff was very friendly and nice.  The hostess was a hostess w/ the mostess, the bartender/server was right to the point and gave good recommendations, and the manager who brought out the food was very nice and professional.  Customer service was spot-on here.  \\n\\n- The food was tasty - good quality, my turkey mushroom and swiss burger tasted great, fries were hot and fresh, just as I remembered. \\n\\n- Bar area has plenty of seating and TVs for your viewing pleasure.  I picture this place being packed on game days or football Saturdays.  \\n\\n- I got free ranch!  OMG - and it was good ranch dressing!  He asked if I wanted any ranch - hell yeah - and it's not on the bill - - awesome!  \\n\\nThe Debbie Downers: \\n- No bang for the buck here w/ the burgers.  While the food tasted good the portion was obviously reduced.  The mushroom turkey swiss burger was about 15-20% smaller patty and overall size than what I recalled in my past visits.  The free burger was even smaller - which they said it would be - but they normally charge $8 to $9 for what should be a $5-6.  Someone at Corporate likely did a project to increase margins by reducing the meat and portions so they could squeeze out a few extra bucks.   Yay.  And that guy probably got promoted along w/ a hefty raise and bonus.  That's where the money goes.    \\n\\n- The bathrooms were dirty, which was disappointing because they had plenty of staff working with only 6-8 customers in-house.  There's nothing more that can worsen your appetite than the sight and smell of urine in the bathroom.  \\n\\n- This special was buy 1 burger w/ 2 drinks and get a free burger, a promo that happens every first Tuesday of the month.  But the kicker is they charged $6.50 for 2 soft drinks - - WTF?  That's what I call Highway Robbery.  It bumped our bill to $20 (not including tip) and that's not really a deal if you ask me.  $3.25 per soft drink - WTF?  Reduce it to $2 and give me the option NOT to buy a drink then I'll compromise with that.  So I can't say I'll go back to anymore Tuesday specials because it's really not that much of a special.  \\n\\nI think Corporate spent a lot of money on the decor and asthetics - which is important - but they went overboard and overbudget and have to make up for it by raising prices and reducing portions.  And I know that's the general theme, but your food and offerings have to be phenomenal in order to keep me coming back.   And even though they're respectable, it's not enough for me to be a consistent customer - especially with all the competition out there.

If a restaurant is going to devote so many employees to attending to people at their tables, they might as well just convert to a full service restaurant and spare us the hour wait standing in line for the counter service.

The cannoli had a nice lemony and blueberry cream cheese filling but the spatzle was rather greasy and small portioned. The desert nutmeg egg nog made me regret not ordering it with some booze as the whipped cream was rather chewy and serve as a detractor to the egg nog.\\n\\nUpdate: Who would have known the quality of the place improves the more you pay for it?

Situated in beautiful Gastown, Cafe Medina is a popular restaurant that is always packed and famous for their Belgian waffles. I was always scared away by people telling me that the line-up was horrible, but when I showed up, we managed to get a table for our group (9 of us!!!) in 45 minutes. I had arrived half an hour early and with my friend, we put our name right away on the list. Indeed, Cafe Medina works on a list system: you put your name on it and the size of your party and the manager goes through the list when a table becomes available.\\n\\nWe were put at a table at the \\"back\\" of the restaurant. Actually, Chambar and Cafe Medina are owned by the same person and are right beside each other. They therefore share spaces where they connect. The interior was beautiful. Artworks were displayed on the wall and there were vases filled with flowers.\\n\\nThe food was succulent. I ordered the saumon fum√© and a waffle with the chocolate lavender dip. The saumon fum√© dish consisted of, on one side of the plate, a ciabatta bread with mashed smoked salmon, green salad and halves of cherry tomatoes. The other side of the plate had ciabatta bread, again mashed smoked salmon with a slice of avocado and a fried egg on top. This dish officially made me a fan of Cafe Medina. I liked the fact that the bread was toasted, giving the dish a bit of a crunch. The creamy slice of avocado was a nice contrast to the harder consistency of the egg. The salad on the other half of the sandwich was a fresh addition to this dish. We need many vitamins for the long winter. :) The waffle only confirmed my opinion that Cafe Medina would soon become a favorite of mine. The waffle was light and fluffy. As for the dip, ooh was it good. I swear that I could taste the lavender in the chocolate. One of my lunch companion add the salted caramel dip and being a caramel lover too, I have added it to my list of things to eat before I die (maybe a eating bucket list). The chocolate was thick and a nice combination with the fluffy waffle.\\n\\nThe service was faultless. The francophone waiter (we discovered he was from Montr√©al) was polite and served the food in a timely manner. I didn't notice any errors in the billing or the service. The lunch went smoothly which made the whole experience even more enjoyable.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I was always scared of Cafe Medina, but those fears were silly. Cafe Medina is a cute restaurant situated in the district with some of the best restaurants in Vancouver. The food is excellent, the service perfect and the price is fair. I will gladly come back to Cafe Medina event just to practice my French with the waiter. :)\\n\\nThe categories are out of 5.\\nFood: 5/5\\nService: 5/5\\nPrice: 4/5"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"THE BEST DONUTS I HAVE EVER HAD!!!

I don't think I've ever ordered breakfast straight off the menu.. I usually get some kind of custom omelette, whatever I can think of at the moment.  Try a mushroom, onion, and sausage omelette. Not on the menu.. I made it up.. but they'll make it. Definitely seems to be a lot of regulars, but on the weekends it seems to be a mixed bag of regulars and families. There's usually parking.. either in there lot next to the diner or on the street. \\n\\nAside from just being a breakfast spot, their lunch is really underrated... the menu seems to have everything from meatloaf to burgers and dogs to seafood. You would never think a small diner would have awesome seafood, but I'm a huge fan of their fried scallops when I have a chance to go there for lunch. After Georgio's in Revere closed, the Yolk became my place for fried scallops. My girlfriend is also a fan of the kabob salad, which looked really good as well.

I had a Milanesa sandwich, which was utterly delicious with a fine sauce and wonderful breaded beef. The waitress, who I think was also a co-owner, made sure that we enjoyed our food. She was from Argentina and her and my friend were able to converse about the place. It made for a delicious lunch! The place is simple and I also believe that it doubles as Sully's Cafe.

This makes coming here convenient and simple.\\n\\nStep 2: Go put your name on the list at Barley Swine.  You give them a phone number and they send you a text when your table is ready.\\n\\nStep 3: Go next door to Henri's and get some wine and cheese while you wait.

The grilled okra looked like a miniature winter wonderland scene with little buildings made of okra and bushes of hush puppies.  The soft poached duck egg was cooked to perfection.  The perfect consistency of soft white without an overcooked yolk.  Popcorn was interesting, not necessary, but did appreciate the texture.  Fluffy dill foam and goat cheese gave it a mild tang to cut the nutty richness of the yolk.  I like charcuterie as much as the next person, but the pig face was probably my least favorite of the plates we ordered, which relatively speaking, is still pretty good.  It was formed into squares and gave it a Spam-like consistency.\\n\\nStep 6: Head to Lick for dessert.  I have yet to write a review for this one, but I went there again with the kids a couple days after because it was so good.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a great and convenient way to enjoy an evening without having to deal with the hassle of reservations, waiting, parking, etc.  Highly recommend Barley Swine, I agree with the other reviewers here, one of the best in Austin.

Ordered the eggs benedict with crisp bacon and the peachy keen smoothie. Eggs benedict was not amazing-when I cut open the egg, the yolk was over done. Bacon was also not very crispy after soaking up some of the hollandaise. English muffin was toasted, so I loved the crunch of that with my egg. The potatoes on the side were also nothing special; they could've used some chili powder and pepper. Definitely needed the hot sauce for this meal. Peachy keen smoothie was great though! I could tell it was made fresh and with fresh fruit. Definitely trying the milkshakes the next time I come. Prices are quite affordable; my bill came to about 15 dollars.

Went to the Hawthorne store at 8:30 on a Sunday morning, and was pleased to see only about 3 other people in line. YAY! \\n\\nAnd then we waited. And waited. And waited. They have the most asininely inefficient system for taking and filling orders, obviously. There were many donuts available spread out on trays and shelved in racks all over the place behind the counter, at least 5 people working, and, like I said, only about three parties (of only one or two people each) ordering. So why does it take about 5 minutes to simply GET each party's order taken? And that's not even FILLING the actual orders. \\n\\nAfter you finally order, they don't just take the donuts off the racks and stick them in the box (or hand them to you, if just one or two). I couldn't for the life of me understand their workflow, but somehow, they had just one person who would: laboriously lay out individual pieces of the paper used for each donut in an order, then have to pull trays out from racks and use tongs to carefully place each donut on the square of paper, then get a box, then carefully place the donuts in the box or boxes. This took at least an additional 5 to 7 minutes per order -- REALLY -- so you can see how things got stacked up. So, with just 3 orders ahead of us, it took 20 or 25 minutes to order and get TWO donuts. Which we, too, had to wait 5 or 7 minutes to get (and then, even though we said we were eating them right away and just wanted them in paper, no box, they came in a ridiculously big box). \\n\\nAs for the quality of the donuts, I'm divided. Clearly the ingredients are great. The flavors are consequently very pure and natural. However, it must be something about the ratio of ingredients they use, because their yeast/risen donuts immediately squish flat when you bite into them -- they need a little more structure -- and the glazes are (at least on the ones I had) way too thick and heavy handed. It overwhelmed the donut entirely, even contributing the collapse of its structure.\\n\\nI will probably go back one more time because I wanted to try a couple other flavors, but at $2.50 and $3.00 per donut, that was out of the question today (I wish they had donut holes for this purpose!), but that'll be it. \\n\\nSo, Blue Star: lose the absurd prices (yes, I know the great ingredients cost more, but c'mon... they're DONUTS!), and go study the workflow at Winchells or Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts. The only reason you're getting three stars is that the quality and purity of the ingredients saved you from a mere two."},{"name":"Pekoe Sip House","address":"1225 Alpine Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Went in right when they opened after a night in the emergency room.

We were a party of 4 and upon arrival, we were quickly whisked away to the saloon (a small dining area away from the main dining room).  At first, I was put off by this.  What, restaurant week diners aren't good enough for the main room?!?  But in hindsight, it was really great.  The saloon was much quieter and suitable for conversation and we didn't feel rushed to get through our meal/vacate the table.  The service was great too!  I hate it when fancy schmancy places treat you like you are not up to their standards, but I didn't get that feeling here at all.\\n\\nThe food, I must admit, was so-so for me.  I had the arugula salad with a shrimp-based dressing which was fabulous.  However, I was a bit disappointed with my entree (rack of veal).  It was flavorful enough, but the texture was oddly tough and chewy.  It got to the point where I could barely cut through it with my knife.  The dessert, as I had expected from other yelp reviews, was sub-par.  I chose the Bailey's butterscotch sundae.  It was a melting pool of ice cream with sauce drizzled on the side.  I have a major sweet tooth so I was happy for something sugary, but there was nothing first-class about it.\\n\\nOverall, I was satisfied with my visit to Locke-Ober, but would have been disappointed had I paid their regular menu prices instead of the Restaurant Week special.

That being said, this restaurant was kind of a let down in the areas of service, hospitality, and entrees. The host stand was vacant when we arrived and we stood there for a good few minutes before anyone greeted us. Once seated, it was over 10 minutes before our server came to say hello. The poor service continued through the entire meal sometimes not having anyone at our table for 15 minutes. When the appetizer/starter came, we forgot about bad service because the Spring Pea risotto is just that amazing! Unfortunately, when the manager (I'm guessing because our server had once again disappeared into some void) brought our entrees there was no \\"do you have everything you need?\\" Even though my wine glass was empty and he brought a steak to a patron who had no steak knife. After realizing the steak was cooked medium well when requested to be medium rare, no one came back to check on us for another 15 minutes. When the server finally showed her face, we simply got an \\"I'm sorry. I'm very busy.\\" We ended up barely touching the entrees which did not even prompt a \\"was there anything wrong with your meals?\\" Another individual ended up bringing dessert menus and we wanted to order the strawberry shortcake with lemon poppyseed ice cream, but we sat there so long once again waiting on a server to show up that we decided it wasn't worth it. All in all, the space is beautiful, the food was a 50/50 and I am guessing if M and C we're in the kitchen, it would have been a different experience.

Frequently, you will see people parked on Ponce de Leon Place or on a nearby side road. It is crazy! Also, do not try to turn left onto Ponce from the lot during rush times. It is very difficult.

Very friendly service."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"With the great reviews from many culinary critics, we've decided it's finally our turn to experience M+C.  Since we both like dim sum, trying out their weekend dim sum lunch seemed to be the way to go.\\n\\nDecor: First off, their simple decor is quite likable.  The tongue-in-cheek jokes are actually pretty funny.  Being Chinese myself, I don't find them offensive at all.  There are obvious signs that the owners put many thoughts into the details of this place: Chinese tea tin cans as holders for chopsticks, kung fu figures as background of the menu, and traditional Chinese coin purse to hold the bill.  They have funky pink dragons!  A solid B.\\n\\nService: Both servers are quite nice and friendly.  The service, however, was slooooooow!  With a full dining room, two servers and a food runner are just not enough.  C\\n\\nFood:  We ordered nine dim sum dishes.  Overall - C+.\\nWok-roasted Shiitake Omelette - At first look, the brownish color of this omelette is quite not appetizing.  However, it is actually pretty tasty.  The omelette is fluffy, with a perfect doneness.  The shiitake flavor is just right.\\n\\nWok-roasted Lemongrass Mussels - The mussels are plump and juicy, and just cooked through.  Although a bit on the salty side, the sauce was great.  In addition to the lemongrass, I can taste fish sauce, Chinese fermented black beans, and soy sauce.  I would suggest that instead of using a large bowl to serve this dish, maybe a small pasta plate might be better.  It can more evenly distribute the sauce to each mussel, instead of having the bottom half of the mussels soaking in the sauce, making them a bit too salty.  Still, this is a very good dish.\\n\\nTea-smoked Pork Spare Ribs - Based on other Yelp reviews, this is a well-liked dish.  I like the spice rub on the pork ribs.  Did I tasted a little Szechwan peppercorn?\\n\\nCrispy Pork Belly Stuffed Bao - I liked the crispy pork belly, but the bao (bun) was a bit dry.\\n\\nFried Mama Chang's Pork Dumplings - I was expecting potstickers style fried dumplings (pan fried), and these dumplings were deep fried.  The pork stuffing was quite salty already.  With the dipping sauce, the dumplings were way too salty for me.  Disappointing.\\n\\nDan Dan Noodles - The spicy peanut sauce in the dan dan cold noodles, served in a tiny paper takeout container, was great!  I would suggest that the cucumber be served in very thin strips or shredded, instead of small chunks.\\n\\nGenmai with Toasted Garlic and Brown Rice - I have to say this was the most disappointed dish of the day.  This fried overnight brown rice was way over done!  Instead, it should be called burnt brown rice!  Salty, hard, burnt (some was actually blackened).\\n\\nGrilled Corn on the Cob - Mimic traditional Taiwanese street food, the grilled corn on the cob was a great concept, but the sriracha butter sauce was forgettable.  Presentation was another minus point.  How about serving the corn with a skewer instead of a bowl?\\n\\n5-Spice Tofu and Garlic Chives - This was the surprise dish of the meal.  The tofu was tasty and the chives complemented the tofu perfectly.\\n\\nSanitation: A quick search on Boston Health Dept online found that M+C had multiple violations (some very serious) on a routine inspection in December.  All violations were corrected on a later re-inspection.

I ordered the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad. Didn't like the tart taste of the Chipotle Ranch, so ranch was used. The salad was absolutely nothing spectacular.

I ordered 3 tacos: their infamous Migas (lived up to the hype), their tilapia fish taco w/chipotle sauce and mango salsa (also lived up to the hype), sadly the only taco that was disappointing for me was the chicken mole. The mole was a little on the bland side and a bit pastey, but I am a mole snob; I like my mole with a creamy texture and the perfect balance of spice and chocolate.   \\n\\nThe prices are a little pricey for the size of the taco you get (my 3 tacos came to $11.92) however, you can tell they use quality ingredients and everything tasted fresh.  \\n\\nMy only other complaint was it took FOREVER for me to get my tacos. I was given a number and went at sat at a nearby bench outside, but literally after almost 20mins I finally had to go up to the trailer and ask what the hold up was.

Meats are priced by the size you choose to receive.  They pulled out brisket, asked us if we wanted more of a lean slice or juicy.  I had juicy.  hmmmmmm so good.

After enjoying my first time, I have already been back a second time, and I imagine I will visit many more times. I highly recommend the Liege Style Waffles, either as a starter or perhaps even as your meal. I love starting with one, which includes a dipping sauce of your choice. I am particularly partial to the White Chocolate Pistachio Rosewater, which has a stunning flavor. I have gotten it both times and have licked the bowl it came in to get every last bit. I have had 2 entrees: Wolves Breakfast and Paella. The Wolves Breakfast is a sampler of many of the meats available in each of the dishes, and I added a couple of poached eggs to it. The Paella is an interesting take on the namesake dish, using Orzo rather than rice. The combination of the orzo, spicy chorizo, veggies, tomato salsa, sunny egg, and avocado is a delight to the taste buds, bursting with flavor and a slight kick. I preferred the Paella over the Wolves Breakfast, both in flavor and in overall satisfaction, but both entrees were quite good.

The papaya salad was freshly made, spicy and refreshing with peanuts for extra taste and texture. The tuna tartare, however, was a bit of a let down given the paucity of tuna and a high emphasis on post-meal diuresis, since it was soo salty. The miso carrots were amazing!!!

We were immediately greeted and asked if we had a reservation, we did not, but they were able to seat us. Our server was knowledgeable, pleasant, attentive and professional.  Their specialty drinks were quite creative and I opted for a lime, cucumber and basil spiked lemonade (it was very refreshing).

In fact, she even lied by telling me that she went to see my wife as soon as she was requested.  I guess she didn't know that my wife was texting me during the whole process so I know my wife asked for a manager at around 12:45 and no one came until she left just before 1PM when she found out that it would be another 15-20 for the food to be ready.\\n\\nLove the wings... hate the service.  The downtown Hooters food is always substandard when compared to other Hooters restaurants, but it's the closest one to my house so I have dealt with it when I've had the craving...not any longer.  If you're looking for some wings, try Taco Mac as their service is always great and the wings are rated as the best in Atlanta.

One waitress came over and introduced herself and told us our waitress would be around shortly, and took our drink order, once again another restaurant claiming an extensive selection is unable to make my drink, one in our party ordered a Crown with Pellegrino which is a common drink and served all over the area but our waitress told him that if he wanted the Pellegrino he would have to order the entire bottle for $5, I found this to be extremely poor customer service. The service and attention factor was extremely poor from most everyone working. At no time did anyone come to our table to check on us, see if there was any issues, or simply chat with us about our experience. I watched the waitstaff move around tables at such a slow pace, I wondered if this was normal or was it that the kitchen staff was unable to keep up with the diverse menu items. The sad part was at no time did our waitress actually bring us our food, it was other waitstaff which I find it annoying as if the item is incorrect upon receipt were unable to confront the person who took the order until they return which in most case the wait time is long enough our food is cold. \\n\\nAs for the food, I kept it simple I ordered \\"The Boss\\" from the Fusion Specialty roll section and it was excellent. It contained Spicy yellow fin tuna, kani salad, English cucumbers inside, coated in tempura flakes. Topped with avocado, premium tuna, wasabi tobiko and wasabi mayo. Upon our completion of the meal, a colleague chose to order a 1/2 order sushi roll which took upwards of 20mins to get and at no time did our waitress come to check on us to see if we wanted another drink, deserts, etc.\\n\\nThe only thing I found noteworthy about CowFish was the food, the roll I ordered was good but the hamburgers appear to be something I'll try on another visit. I doubt I'll return and sit in the restaurant, a To Go order would be perfect for this restaurant.

We questioned why, insisted that all of us were of age (23, 24, 24, 31), having valid IDs, and were coming there for food and beer.

The fried chicken is just ok (I'd rather have Publix fried chicken), the other food is generally overly heavy and not that great - I've had the pork chop, the chicken pot pie, the pimento cheese sandwich and a few other things, all of it is not bad but also not great, and at times so rich that even if the first bite is good (pimento sandwich) by the time it's finished its just too much. I had heard good things about their breakfast and tried it this morning, and once again was disappointed. The Southern Poutine was just ok (mediocre crinkle fries with gravy, cheese, and an egg), the chicken biscuit was good but not great and the chicken fanger was too big for the biscuit, the pancakes were meh, and the coffee was bad.  So the breakfast was consistent with the lunch and dinner - underwhelming. The table was also sticky as were the floors, it just doesn't feel that clean.

Who puts ice in a mimosa?  I'm from New Orleans too--we're not all like that.  When the lady handed it to me, I immediately handed it back asked for one without ice.  The chick next to her seemed offended and, in a defensive tone, told me it would not be in a glass that big, and blah blah something else.  I threw my hands up (I didn't mean to hurt you, sister!) and said, \\"I don't care, I just don't want ice in a mimosa.\\"  I got what I asked for in a smaller glass, but  further advice for you: just get a beer.  Cherrywood, for $5.50 y'all can afford to put more Andre in it than that! \\n\\n2.  When we got there, I noticed the \\"voted best affordable, delectable burger\\" for the Chronicle's b.o.a. 2010.  I went for it....but trusting the winners of the best of austin list to deliver the goods is like asking your grandmother for a movie recommendation and expecting to like it.  \\n\\nI ordered \\"the wife's\\" burger--a single patty (I expected two patties would be way too much meat for me) and my husband got the house burger--two beef patties.

I asked for mustard and mayo only (they usually also add ketchup) and when I opened the burger to check out the goods, there was the tiniest quarter-sized smear--why bother putting it on there at all?  The patty couldn't have been more than about 4 millimeters thick and it just disappeared in all that bread.  The only good parts of this burger are nice, thinly sliced red onions, good lettuce, and a good amount of cheddar.   I filled up on fries (decent fries--could be crisper) and left the bread sandwich for the grackles.\\n\\nIn my man's double patty burger, you could at least see the meat, but he didn't get through half of his either--these burgers just aren't worth it.  I don't know where you b.o.a. voters ate before you experienced this burger as the best, even as a \\"value\\" burger, but y'all need to get to some other places around town with cheaper burgers that beat the heck out of this one.\\n\\nTO CC's CREDIT:  On a previous visit, hubby and I shared a seafood platter, a salad, and a bottle of wine.  It's a nice little salad, they do the seafood right, and they have some tolerable bottles at pretty fair restaurant prices (as well as some gross bottles also at decent prices)"},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food, atmosphere, and service!!

I've been here at least six times in the last three years and this was the first time the valet, did not approach the car or open the door for the women in the car.  My daughter and mother exited the car and he still didn't look up or greet us, by this time another valet, walks up to the stand and they begin having a personal conversation among themselves, until I finally say...excuse me, we would like to valet the car. The first guy looks up at me like I hadn't been standing there looking at him for the last minute or so.  He mumbles an insincere apology and when I asked him what did he think we were standing there for, or pulled the car into this area and then proceed to exit the vehicle for?  He mumbled something under his breath and went towards the driver side of the car.  I let him know, by no means was his level of service acceptable and I'm sure there is a procedure he is to follow, and that he had indeed had the \\"right one\\".  I let him know not only would I be reviewing his service, but would also notify the valet company. My mother and daughter pleaded with me not to cuss him into another universe, and I complied and went into the restaurant. \\n\\nWe always sit on the patio, as I find it less formal than the dining room and we don't have to worry about speaking in hushed tones an entire meal.\\n\\nI forgot our servers name, but she was friendly and came back to check on us an appropriate number of times.  I can't recall what she said the specials were, because I'd made up my mind what I wanted before we got to the restaurant. \\n\\nWe started with the tzatziki which is a cucumber yogurt and dill spread.  In the past, the spreads were served with pita bread, it is now served with a cracker-like flat bread, which I found very hard and not complimentary to the spread.  When we asked if the pita bread was still available, we were quoted a price of $5.  (if it aint broke, don't fix it), why would you charge a customer $5 for pita bread at a restaurant where the entrees range in price from $30-42 per person?? She accommodated us by bringing out four slices of sourdough loaf of bread, but honestly, the spreads are best with the pita bread.\\n\\nOne of my favorite appetizers here is the Horiatiki tomato salad, It is still at $12, but less than half the size it was last summer.  Last time we were here, we received a serving dish sized portion, this time it was smaller than a cereal bowl and we should have ordered two, since it was three of us sharing the dish and its a family favorite. (if it aint broke don't fix it).  I can't understand the smaller portion size, its not like the cost of tomatoes, cucumbers or olives have skyrocketed in the last year. \\n\\nAnother disappointment was the Mussels ($14), last time they we were here they were served, in shells with a white wine sauce and feta cheese.  They are now served without the shells and you get way more of the sauce and feta cheese than you do the mussels.  I don't think we had six mussels in total in the entire dish (again, if it aint broke, please don't fix it)\\n\\nMy mom and daughter both went with the lamb chops ($32/each).  It comes with 3 chops which are tenderly cooked and an order of Greek fries (basically round french fries) and an order of the tzatziki for dipping.  \\n\\nI went with the Giant Prawns, which are more like medium, and you get five of them grilled in greek olive oil and capers.  It comes with kale, but I was able to substitute it with spinach.  It was delicious, but do you know how quickly you can eat 5 shrimp? ($30)\\n\\nMy Philosopher martinis (cucumber martini) are now served with minced dill on top of the mixture, I requested that not be included and just to bring me some extra cucumbers, those have gone up in price also, from $11 to $13.  I had four.  LOL.  \\n\\nOverall, it was a nice of a visit as we normally have, and maybe it was my altercation with the valet driver at the beginning, but it seemed as if it has lost its appeal for me.  Maybe another visit before summer is over will be the final test.\\n\\nAs we left and got back to the valet stand, the first guy was no longer there, but the second guy who had witness my dissatisfaction with his co-worker, promptly retrieved our car, apologized for the first guy  and told us not not worry about the two fee, my daughter insisted he take the two dollars and I was fine with that as I made up my mind that there was not going to be a tip given."},{"name":"Kyma","address":"3085 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"If you are looking for real authentic greek ,a fan of good fresh sea food and willing to try some amazing greek wine then this is the place to be.

This gem differentiates itself not only with it's menu, but with their techniques, their ingredients and the restaurant itself. You can enter safely, as all of your preconceived notions of greasy, headache-inducing dishes will not be a part of your feast here; they don't use MSG here. Instead they go back to the basics, making everything from scratch and using some old school techniques - but often, with a twist or two.\\n\\nIt's not authentic in any way or form, but instead is Asian inspired and they offer a vast array of dishes, most of them are tapas-style, or small plates for anyone to nosh on. Dim sums of all sorts, with pork, shrimp, chicken, eggplant, you name it. There's enough to satisfy anyone's craving for any ingredient. Hell, there's even some dishes featuring brussel sprouts. And for the pork lovers, they have pork belly as well. \\n\\nThey also have dishes which feature some nice seasonal twists, like the butternut squash and & coconut soup, some lovely braised pork belly buns (delicious!) and even some unexpected dishes like the chicken and waffles - the waffle is based on a ginger and sesame batter giving it that Asian twist. \\n\\nWhen Leighann and I went there, they had a special dinner menu, something designed for two people to share. It featured a variety of dishes and topped of at just over $40. It featured those braised pork belly buns, some pork dumpings and a few other dishes. The only thing that ticked me off is that although it was designed for two people to share, a lot of the items on there were served in a odd number. And being an Asian restaurant, I recall us having to ask for a knife so we could split them which was inconvenient. \\n\\nOn the upside the food tasted great and the cocktails list was interesting; After much glancing and debating what to get, I settled for a lovely Asian mojito (junmai ginjo sake, fresh mint syrup, lime) - A lot of them were very tempting, and each features a strong Asian influence, with mixers featuring all sorts of flavors, from ginger to lichi, and even some plum wine and sake. \\n\\nAnd because everything is made to order, those who can't eat gluten or are allergic to shellfish and seafood (such as myself) can easily order what you want, and they'll keep that in mind. An entire section of the menu was dedicated to allergen-free dishes. It's great to see that they paid attention to such details. \\n\\nStreet parking is fairly easy to find and the place is really neat - it's got a great hipster-like vibe to it but it doesn't scream out in any kind of way making it inviting. The service was pretty good and their place mats are really neat as well.

In the vegetable troughs--limp green beans & corn billed as Mixed Vegetable Masala?!!  Have you EVER ordered green beans and corn at an Indian restaurant?! The other \\"vegetable\\" trough contained soggy potatoes so non-descript I could not bring myself to put them on my plate.  Finally...I can usually be happy with a buffet that at least ends with some sort of authentic Indian dessert.  Nope, not here.   Instead, the \\"chef\\" seems to have gotten their hands on a #10 can of Tapioca pudding, and stirred in a can of fruit cocktail.  Disgusting.\\n\\nSeriously, Clay Pit: Get. It.

Real enthusiasts are very particular about the fried chicken and the type of waffle and that's why we have standards like Roscoe's in LA or The Breakfast Klub in Houston. I love Wild Chix, but I have to admit this is probably a place for people who are easily impressed rather than the real chicken and waffle enthusiasts. That being said, it excels at brunch with some very flavorful savory and sweet offerings at very affordable prices, which is why this place is worthy in your brunch rotation.\\n\\nFirst off, the flagship dish \\"What the Cluck\\" is *only* $10 which makes it very forgivable that the chicken is not truly top-tier southern quality and more like a chicken tender. Of course The Breakfast Klub has better chicken, but their chicken and waffles dish is $15 and you're gonna have to wait 45 minutes in line before you can even order. And while the chicken might be lacking for the southern fried chicken aficionados, the total composition of the dish in terms of portioning and combination with maple, bacon, eggs, cheese, and mayo make it very worth it. If you're going as a couple or group, someone definitely needs to order this.\\n\\nAs far as sweet waffles go though, I'd caution you to just order the plain waffle with some fruit or just order another savory waffle and dump boatloads of syrup on it. The banana nutella waffle might be their most popular sweet waffle, but if you want to order this then prepare to consume a week's worth of sugar in one meal because the peanut buttery nature of the nutella combined with a waffle means that things are going to get a bit dry and sticky unless you pour generous amounts of syrup onto the waffle. Those of you looking for something sweet are advised to split a savory waffle with a friend instead and order the banana pudding or sweet drink. That is not to say that this waffle isn't good, but it might leave you feeling quite guilty. It's a great flavor explosion, but syrup is pretty much mandatory so be prepared to hit the gym afterwards.\\n\\nOther than the food, there are plenty of great drinks on the menu that really complete your brunch. The coffee and tea are great or if you really want you can get boozed up. Just do whatever you want!"},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"So the food at Disney World has come a long way since I was a kid. I did not have a bad meal anywhere, and Yak & Yeti, located in the Asia section of the Animal Kingdom Park, was very good. As with many of the ethnic food restaurants at Disney, the menu hovers somewhere between \\"tried and true\\" and cliche, but, having said that, I truly did enjoy my meal here. We would call this place Asian fusion, as I saw cuisines from a few countries represented on the menu. The waitress suggested the pot stickers for an app, and we took her up on that. They were excellent, with a nice crisp and thin wrapper, not doughy or soggy at all, and a flavorful filling. I had the seared tuna salad with a wasabi mayo, pickled ginger and a ginger vinaigrette for my main, and enjoyed it thoroughly, although it was too much for me to finish. They offer the same tuna with an Asian slaw as an app, and I would try that next time. The restaurant is lovely, and the artwork and statues are actual relics and antiques from Thailand and elsewhere, so it looks a lot less like, well, Disney World, than many other restaurants we dined at in the parks. The floor is ceramic tile, and, with the strollers, noisy chairs being moved to accommodate guests, and children mid melt down, it's less than peaceful.

I suppose.\\n\\nFinally, I ordered the fried okra which was good and tasted better than my friend's order of french fries.\\n\\nTotal came up to be $19.50-ish including tip. Yeah, it costs more than your average burger and shake meal from Steak and Shake but I didn't mind at all, unlike my friend who kept complaining that she got gypped. I will probably have to work out like crazy to get rid of all the calories I gained today but it was worth it.\\n\\n****EDIT: So I checked my bank account online just now - seems like the waiter charged me exactly 20% when I paid 15%. I'm not sure I'm pleased with that; we weren't notified earlier. I wish they would just include the tip amount on the receipt before they make us pay. OH and I wasn't also pleased with the waiter accidentally charging me for my food and my friend's as well. This wouldn't be a problem if the waiter didn't charge my friend on his debit card - well, he did. Such a frustrating issue. Knocked off a star 'cuz of these problems.\\n\\n*****EDIT, again: So all the bank issues got resolved like 4 days after. But for some reason, I don't want to return to Flip again after this fiasco. Too bad, I really wanted to like it and be a big fan."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We don't understand all the good reviews for this place.

It worked. \\n\\nWhat I found was a building repurposed to funnel huge lines to the back of the building where the mighty burger is ordered.

I used to have a rating system for burger joints. Unfortunately I can no longer consume or rate french fries, so my rating system is now obsolete. But so are my tastebuds.

So they have the confidence to ask you how you would \\"like it done\\". That is a plus, because you do not need to settle for \\"well done\\" or \\"dry\\". The patty itself was tasty and thick. I estimated about a 1/2 lb of meat in it. And the toppings were very well balanced. Not overly bold as one might expect from a BBQ burger. The sliced Jalapeno and Caramelized onions played a perfect see-saw over the hickory sauce fulcrum. \\n\\nNow on to the bun: Yeah! It was soft on the inside and all nice and grilly on the outside. And it totally didn't fall apart. Perfect.\\n\\nStaff was friendly.

We ordered a bottle of chianti, which was delish, and then ordered the sausage BBQ, which came with fresh bread and spicy cherry peppers. The flavor was good but the sausage itself was overcooked and dry. For pizza, we got the sausage and garlic and that was amazing! Probably one of the best pizzas I've had in a while. The crust was perfectly fluffy and crispy and the flavors were on point. \\n\\nI'd definitely come back.

Let me start off by saying we ate at the original location a few years back and had a good experience. I will say the service was good on some fronts and our server did see if they could accommodate a food allergy I have and they were able to somewhat accommodate, which if they were not able to, I would have understood as that just comes with the territory for eating at higher end restaurants that want to create interesting flavor combinations. Unfortunately, the food was just not good on any level. We had the Chilled Peach Soup, Pretzel, Snapper Crudo, Pig Skin Noodles, Shitake Pasta, and Grilled Potato dishes. The presentation on all of the dishes was fine, but the preparation and flavor combinations were just bad. The soup had way too much goat cheese which over-powered the whole dish. The pretzel was not terrible, but for $7, was pretty tough and just didn't work. The snapper crudo was served up warm and fishy, just the opposite of the way a snapper crudo should be served or has ever been served to me in the past. I understand that they smoked it, but it should not be served warm and it tasted like it had sat out on a fishing dock in the sun for a week, definitely not fresh. We ate one piece each and set it to the side. I was surprised the server didn't even ask if we liked it when he picked up a mostly full dish, but I digress. The pig skin noodles were next, and I really liked the idea of this dish, but it was poorly executed. The shrimp dumplings had an alright flavor, but were a little overcooked and the whole dish was drowning in the hot sauce. It was more like a hot sauce soup with some noodles, not just tossed in it. My wife had the potato dish and while I could not try it due to the peanut yogurt ranch, she took a few bites and said it was not good and put it to the side. The last dish we had was the shitake pasta and it was probably the least offensive offering, but was still pretty average. Maybe we hit on a really off night, or we managed to pick every bad dish, but my wife was really disappointed, to the point she didn't want dessert there, which she always gets dessert, so $150 down the drain more or less with drinks.

I think it's important to state any biases upfront! It's just a super romantic, neighborhood restaurant in Brookhaven. It's a wine bistro so as you walk in you're instantly are exposed to the open wine cellar and the dimmer lightening. It all helps to add to the atmosphere. The customer service in the three times I have been here is great! They have been very attentive, genuine and knowledgeable about what they offer and portions. Speaking of food, the portion size is European . Meaning smaller but the flavor is bold and I love it! I have had the crab cakes, the scallops, the Mahdi-Mahi, the crab artichoke dip, saut√©ed mushrooms, and the roasted brussel sprouts. My favorite and my recommendation is the pan seared scallops that are perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth! Also have it with the brussel sprouts! They are delicious!! They saut√©ed them in an aged balsamic sauce with fresh shaved Parmesan it's sooo good!!

I actually enjoyed the capers that topped the fish since everything went together so delectably.\\n\\nThe Mushroom Ravioli pasta was fresh and the texture was perfect. (yeahh, I watched the last season of top chef so I know how difficult it can be) The filling was slightly watery, probably from being assembled and dipped within a short time, but it was still flavorful, especially swimming in brown butter,shaved slices of parmesan, and the crunchiest, flavorful green beans ever.\\n\\nService:\\nThe italian band on saturday night was great.

There was plenty of parking outside. Was greeted, seated and drink orders were taken immediately. Within 5 minutes the waiter had brought a tray with my happy hour beer, chips and salsa. I went ahead and placed my order at this time.\\n\\nOther couples and groups started trickling in, getting seated and ordering their happy hour Mexican Martinis and Margaritas. A chalk board said Mexican Martinis were $5.50 4-7pm on Thursday; good to know, will try them out another time for sure!\\n\\nSipping on the ice cold beer (when I ordered, the waiter asked if I wanted the beer in a glass or not, I said yes please -- it came in a nice chilled pint glass!) and trying the chips and salsa, I noted how tasty the salsa was - it had a nice blend of cilantro and spice; reminiscent of Maudie's salsa but lower on the spice level; definitely good stuff. The chips however are as others here have reported: Thick, not heated, and apparently bagged/store bought - a real bummer! The chips simply *must* be good! If they don't want to make them in-house at Casa Maria, then I suggest that they at least buy a good local brand of Tortilla chips and serve those - there are plenty of businesses that make restaurant quality tortilla chips in East Austin (El Milagro, and a handful of others), no need to buy an inferior brand.\\n\\nThe food came quick. Really quick. About 4 minutes after I ordered, out came the entree. I ordered the Enchiladas Supremas $7.99: Two beef, chicken or cheese enchiladas topped with red sauce and monterrey jack cheese. Served with rice, refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes and guacamole... I ordered mine with Cheese.\\n\\nThe plate was warm, not burning hot like some of the Tex-Mex joints around town. The food was all hot and the cheese was melted. The rice and beans were great! You can taste the smoked bacon flavor in the refried beans, very tasty. The guacamole that came with it was about 2 teaspoons worth on a 3 tablespoon bed of lettuce and tomatoes; would have preferred a bit more but that's okay - it was a little watered down anyway and overall bland - unimpressive. The sauce on the enchiladas was indeed red, there was no meat, it wasn't the typical Tex-Mex chili con carne/chili gravy; it tasted good but wasn't that remarkable. The cheeses used inside and out were white, Monterrey Jack cheese, instead of the usual processed/American cheese used in Tex-Mex food. Overall, the plate was pretty good, wasn't too heavy, and didn't dry me out from all the salt you'd find in typical Tex-Mex from all the processed cheese. I'd probably order this dish again, especially if I came back at lunch when it can be had for $4.99 + tax on Mondays. \\n\\nNote: Casa Maria comes off as more of a Mex-Tex and less of a Tex-Mex joint based on their choices of cheeses and sauces, as all their enchilada plates come with Monterrey Jack cheese and either red, green or ranchero sauce. \\n\\nAdded Bonus: I've been looking for a good Tres Leches cake here in town and Casa Maria has a bakery in addition to the restaurant, so I ordered a piece of Tres Leches to go. The waiter promptly came back with a nice container of a beautifully large slice of Tres Leches, with a generous amount of sauce in the bottom to keep it moist - you know I was looking forward to trying that later at night!\\n\\nI went to the register and paid. I noticed that the owner was at the register - always good to see the owners involved in the operations of the business. She's nice and friendly, too. The environment is nice, clean and the air conditioning blows cold.\\n\\nIncredible!! :: The Tres Leches is definitely among the best I've had in town, highly recommended for $3.99 for a huge slice! Not too sweet, not too heavy; delicious and very satisfying. \\n\\nGood To Know:\\n\\nLunch Specials Daily from 11am-2pm for $4.99 + tax:\\n\\nMonday: Enchiladas - red, green, rojas or verdes\\nTuesday: Carne Guisada Plate or Chili Relleno Plate\\nWednesday: Fajita Plate (beef, chicken or mix)\\nThursday: Pork Meat Plate - red or green sauce with tortillas\\nFriday: Chicken Mole Plate with Tortillas, or Crispy Taco Plate (beef only) or Tostada Plate (beef only)\\n\\nIt was a nice quick dinner and I do plan to go back and try them out again during lunch sometime again soon.

It felt rather odd to have children sitting in that area and also facing the bar but a big plus about it being high was that it kind of prevented them from wanting to run around as much. The patrons at the bar weren't raunchy or rambunctious enough that I was worried for the kids.\\n\\nThere was a lunch menu with lobster roll for $19 that had a generous amount of large lobster pieces although I was not a fan of the semi hard but also chewy bread. The sweet potato fries were also crisp and tasty. The calamari was good but it was covered in sweet chili sauce which I love but would have preferred it on the side. The kids surprisingly also enjoyed the calamari (kids are very, very picky). The kids themselves were offered their own menu with crayons and a special kids cup for the youngest. The lobster mac and cheese was also good. The rolls came after we were served and I was too full to try them. \\n\\nThe waitress was very friendly and handled children very well.

I thought the crispy quinoa shrimp (with chimichurri aioli and vegetable slaw) had far too much quinoa and its crispiness took away any of the shrimp taste. The panko blue crab cakes (with fennel and arugula salad and chipotle aioli) was fairly tasty and hearty but too packed in its flavour and filling. I was pretty satisfied after a single piece.\\n\\nI was really disappointed by the spicy Thai basil stir fry (with rice noodles, shrimp, and coconut milk). To me, it tasted soggy like a strange twist on Pad Thai without any taste or flavour. However, the grilled Japanese tuna tataki (with asparagus and fennel slaw, Mandarin dressing) was pretty solid, flavourful, and grilled well.\\n\\nThe obvious stand out was the surf and turf of grilled flat iron steak and lobster fricassee and its rich flavour and nice presentation. The lobster bits mixed into the mashed potatoes were a nice touch. The meat was tender and satisfying in its comforting taste.\\n\\nI enjoyed the interesting avocado and lime tart (with brown sugar Chantilly) for dessert but it's not for everyone. It was an intriguing twist on the tart with a unique taste.\\n\\nI was mixed on the chef's menu as a whole. I like how Milestones is going for something different with some interesting culinary twists to their dishes. It just wasn't entirely appealing for myself. I'd stick with any of the more substantive, meatier dishes."},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Finally had the opportunity to try this newer place.  It is closed on Mondays, and is open from 7-3 normally all other days.  It is a breakfast/lunch place. They completely remodeled the old La Provence location. I do like the decor, but I liked the way La Provence had it done better.  Large remodel for a very similar theme.  The bakery section looks lame compared to La Provence down the street. Sorry, you can't keep up in that department. Service was good though and the servers were all friendly and knowledgeable. Breakfast ranges compare to La Provence prices $9-15 a plate.  I ordered the creme br√ªl√©e blueberry French toast. My waitress recommended it, and i am glad she did.  It was Very amazing and delicious, but a dreamy dessert delight.  Expect extreme sweetness for sure. Very good as a stand alone summer dessert treat.  Very sweet with a ton of blueberries and caramel/cream.   I thought it came with Other fruit, but didn't. Very amazing though, but also very rich with no extra sides included.  Great though but I am glad my friend and I shared, so I could try some savory items too.   Fresh flowers and a variety of retro hen salt and pepper shakers adorn the tables. Very cute.  My friend ordered an omlette with spinach, mushrooms, and avocado. It came with whole mini russet potatoes,fruit, and bread. A large portion. It gives La Provence a run for it's money.  Very good. Keep in mind that they charge a $10 minimum for their  omlettes and scrambles but they say they start at $8. If it starts at $8, why have a minimum if a patron only wants one or two add-ons to the omlette?  That was a bit confusing, but no big deal. I will be coming back. Love the place, and considering I went mid-week, the restaurant was still pretty full. Weekends sound more chaotic by the reviews.  Still like La Provence better, but this place ranks high on second best breakfast place in town.  Jefe also serves a mean Mexican Brunch on Sundays and Biscuts is descent and nearby too if  the other places are packed with crowds.

'Light roast' body-less coffee shops with little food (or no food!) have popped up all over the place in well decorated and strategically placed locales for the elite hip. Disguising that their coffee tastes like water with dark wood and leather furniture and exposed beams. Those rats.\\n\\nIt was a sad, sad time...then my husband found Render! Render, who has REAL food. I've ate my way through much of the menu. I'm very picky with textures but the scrumptious homemade veggie cream cheese calms even the strongest neurons trying to fire off warning signal: tiny textures ahead. Their chocolate chip cookie is my favorite in town. It's chewy and brown sugary without too many chips. Render chooses quality beans from quality roasters. Look behind the counter and you'll see the care and attention they put into producing superb nerd-out-coffee-science crack in a cup. I attempted to try other coffee shops and failed miserably. It's one thing to give someone a great cup of coffee, it's entirely another to -consistently- give them a great cup of coffee.\\n\\nAnd most notable of all? Time. The cornerstone of a great coffee house to me is time. No coffee houses slow down time more than those in Vienna. They each had their own personality without sacrificing the quality of their coffee and fare. Render is the first coffee house I've encountered stateside that forces you to slow down. You feel like you're walking into someone's home with the family pictures on the fire mantle. The art on the walls (some of which is now in my home). The back deck. You are forced to wait as they brew a pour-over. In this concrete jungle that I lovingly call home this little shop reminds me to stop a moment to enjoy my coffee, company and walk home down the corridor. I'll admit I reserve my visits to the early weekend hours to avoid the crowds whenever possible but even when it's crowded that doesn't keep me from picking up to-go. \\n\\nTreat yourself - go to Render."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"On a quick weekend trip to Vancouver, my friends really wanted to check out this restaurant and I was so glad we did!

Luckily there are a few shops in that area that within walking distance so we explored the area a bit before heading back. We ordered the following dishes:\\n\\nLavender Latte: I personally love lavender lattes and order them everywhere I go if I see it on the menu! Their lavender flavor is more florally than I would have personally preferred but I still enjoyed it. \\n\\nWaffle with Milk Chocolate Lavender: The waffles are simple but the game changing part of this dish is that you can select your own sauce to dip the waffle in! There are a variety of sauces available. I thought the sauce was done really well because of the rich chocolate flavor. \\n\\nFricasse: I LOVED this dish! This dish is loaded with tender, braised short ribs and is packed with flavor. The grilled focaccia was great to dip in the sauce as well. I highly recommend this dish! \\n\\nPaella: I tried a bite of my friend's paella and this dish was done pretty well. This dish was really flavorful and I loved all the different toppings on it.

And it was just a phenomenal meal. \\n\\nWe went on a Tuesday, it wasn't busy, so our server was attentive. The ambiance and atmosphere was really nice. We ordered a bottle of Boutari (white, not sure exactly which Boutari it was) and it ended paring very well with the rest of our dinner. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had read on yelp that the octopus appetizer was amazing, so we felt compelled to order it (yelp reviewers can't be wrong, haha!) and it definitely was just that - amazing. Very, very good. Don't even think about not getting it. Seriously, it's that good. \\n\\nSince I also HAVE to get saganaki every time I eat Greek food, we decided to get 4 appetizers and split the whole fish (Royal El Dorado - kinda like a Mahi Mahi - also excellent). The saganaki did not disappoint except for the fact that they didn't light it on fire at our table like our places do. \\n\\nWe also got spanakopita and keftedes (Greek meatballs). The spanakopita was as expected (awesome) and the meatballs were excellent - the beef and lamb mixture was very flavorful and the tzatziki and fried accompanied them perfectly. Another reviewer said to avoid them but they also said they didn't like Greek food (and they also thought that tzatziki was mayo??) but they really were good. The fries were seasoned well, too. \\n\\nWhen our whole fish came out, they presented it to us and plated our portions at the table which was nice. The kale served aside the fish was vinegarific but actually made a nice flavor when pared with the fish. \\n\\nI've heard from others that it's a TOTALLY different experience when it's busy. Go on a Tuesday, it'll be well worth it. Especially if your awesome boyfriend who knows you love Greek food makes reservations for your anniversary.

The packaging logistics alone make Clay Pit the best choice for delivery/to-go orders, because the naan is still great in texture/flavor when you get home, and the dishes are still saucy and warm as well.\\n\\nOnto the food, I loved the Chicken Tikka Masala so much when I first had it, I've ordered it probably 8 times in total out of 15, while my wife tried a different dish every time, often vegetarian. This worked out perfectly, because as we shared dishes often I learned that their vegetarian dishes are just like the meat dishes in deliciousness! One of my favorite vegetarian dishes is the Korma. I also really like how ordering spicier and spicier versions of their dishes doesn't make them bitter, but only spicy. We've also tried a variety of the different naan options, though the garlic and basil probably remains our favorite.\\n\\nOverall, this is one of our favorite Indian restaurants in Austin."},{"name":"Shredded","address":"246 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"My girlfriend and I ate here for the first time.

Those being - the waffle, a flavoured coffee, paella and fricassee. \\n\\nThe flavoured coffee I chose was the white chocolate pistachio rose mocha. I had the lavender last time, which was not bad but a little too strong on the lavender for me. This though, was surprisingly flavourful. I could taste the rose and I got bits of pistachio in my mocha. Unfortunately, exactly like what I was dreading, the white chocolate made it too sweet. But other than that I enjoyed it.\\n\\nRating: 7.5/10 \\n\\nThe paella was very spicy, maybe even a little bit TOO spicy. The chorizo and pepper made it very spicy and overwhelming that it masked the flavours of the base. The only flavours I could detect was sourness and spiciness, nothing else. I tried to use the avocado to tone it down, but it didn't help. Trust me, I love chorizo but unfortunately the balance of the spiciness of the chorizo was totally off in this dish. \\n\\nRating: 6/10 \\n\\nThe fricassee was somewhat lacking flavour. It was more on the sweet side than the savoury side. When eaten with the leafy greens on top it was better balanced but nothing about this dish really stood out. The meat was pretty fall apart though which was a good thing. \\n\\nRating: 6.5/10 \\n\\nAnd finally of course, we had to finish with a waffle and salted caramel sauce. I've had the salted caramel sauce and it was pretty good so I had to order it again. The waffle though was somewhat disappointing. It was served warm which I thought was good, but the exterior lacked crunch which was disappointing. I remember last time I had it, it was crunchy so I guess it's just a consistency problem? \\n\\nRating of waffle: 7/10     Rating of salted caramel sauce: 7.5/10 \\n\\nOverall the impression that Medina Caf√© gives me is that on weekends there are usually long lines out the door (luckily I went on a Tuesday at around 10 and we were seated within 5 minutes) and it's on the more expensive side.

These guys just moved into my \\"vegetarians don't go\\" category. I used to love this place, because the veggie burger was really good and could be subbed for any of the other burger options. That meant being able to go with meat eating friends to a burger place and not feel left out.\\n\\nFor some horrible reason, they've cut the veggie burger in favor of a falafel patty.

The wife and I met up with some friends there to kick off the evening. Located right between E Burnside and Couch, it honestly looks kind of like a sports bar from the outside. Upon entering we quickly realized this was no ordinary pub. Candles on tables, waiters with ties, and custom elegant pint glasses gave a touch of flair. Some exposed brick and raw wood rafters completed the industrial chic feel to the place. \\n\\nIt can't be stressed enough how clean the place was from the floors to the bathrooms. Attention is paid to the details that matter and the aroma from the kitchen never competes for musky pub smell. Three cohibas came to our table of four. Collard greens surrounding a crispy wrapper filled with duck confit imparted salty and appetite inspiring ducky goodness that was very intense. Up next was the kobe burger seared in rendered duck fat. I asked if they would cook it medium-rare and the answer was an instant yes! Add that to my very short list of restaurants willing to cook a burger that pink. House made pickles, house made ketchup, and a house made hop bun sandwiched the meat along with some grilled sweet onions and a leaf of lettuce. Instantly one of the best three burgers I've ever had. I should mention that the menu is ala carte so I did not get any fries although they are available as a side. \\n\\nThe beer was the draw that initially brought me to the door. I remember reading about a beer that was brewing at Burnside called Gratzer and was a smoked wheat ale. That was unique sounding enough to catch my interest but unfortunately was not on tap for my visit. For $5 a pint I ordered the scotch bonnet infused wheat ale (Sweet Heat) and the Oatmeal Pale Ale. I also got tastes of the IPA and Stout. The Sweet Heat was a good wheat beer but didn't deliver the heat I was looking for. The IPA and Stout were clean enough with no off flavors but were also forgettable didn't seem very inspired. The Oatmeal Pale Ale was the standout beer of the night for me. The smooth character of the oatmeal complimented the wonderful biscuit flavor that I suspect came from some British ingredients. I didn't get a growler ($10 fills) but plan on going back to get one soon enough. Pints are $3 before 6pm and all day Wednesday for one of the best happy hour deals I know of in town. \\n\\nThe bottom line... Food is great and the beer is average Portland quality which is still very good overall.

I almost always order the grass fed beef which they suggest at medium rare and it almost always comes out brown and slightly dry. While they will make the correction for you, after waiting for a long time initially and having the rest of the party eating already, it seems a hassle that they don't prepare the food the way they suggest and the meal gets longer and longer.\\nIt used to be that the partial service concept was great and the table servers were very helpful.  The last few times in they seemed a little put off if we asked for anything (like pickles which they used to offer or extra forks for salad.)  Maybe it has grown into a tourist place now and the regulars are the only ones noticing the slip. We decided the last time in we'd give it a serious break and enjoy Wholly Cow and Shake Shack, when it opens.  We've always had a great burger at Wholly Cow.

We definitely  wanted to try the Nutella Shake with the burnt marshmallows.  My opinion of this shake is skip the burnt marshmallows.   The shake itself is fabulous.  The  marshmallows didn't have that \\"toasted over a fire taste\\" but more of an \\"oops, I left something in the toaster too long\\" taste.  Bleh.   Next we ordered the burgers.  I went with the classic and my fianc√© ordered the earth turf.  We both ordered medium cooking temperature.  His came out medium and mine came out mooing.  This saddened me.  For the price of these burgers, I expect perfection. The burgers tasted good and they were juicy.  In fact, so juicy that when you are on your third bite you can't set the burger back on the plate or you will end up with a big soggy mess.  (See one of my photos).  It's a sloppy experience.  Some people like this.  I don't.  Somewhat messy is okay.  This was clearly a problem of not enough bun to burger ratio.  Next the \\"sampler\\".
