I'm not a fan. It's true that Franklin's is as good as it gets with the whole Texas BBQ experience, but I personally think it's BS they won't do something to fix the wait time. If they proved to me that they are taking steps to decrease wait time I'll change my review to 5 stars. But for you tourists, you should know that you can keep your whole day if you decide to just eat at Black's on Guadalupe. It's good food and you can keep the rest of your day. Now if you want true Texas BBQ and you have a car, drive out to one of the famous country places like Smitty's in Lockhart or Cooper's in Llano. I hesitate to say Salt Lick because theirs is not a very authentic Texas barbecue experience but it is very good in its own way. What I mean is that true Texas BBQ has no sauce... still Salt Lick's sauce is amazing. Also it's on plates and not by the pound . Also it's a pretty drive to Driftwood. So to recap: Franklin's is really good but I don't respect a business that won't do something to keep their customers from wasting their entire day on one meal. A lot of people just have a day or two to spend on their trip and it's not fair to hog it all like that. Save time, eat good BBQ at Black's on Guad. It's way better than the Black's in Lockhart, I promise. I've also heard it's worth checking out La Barbecue but that's just something I keep hearing. Couldn't tell you what the wait time, food, or atmosphere is like. It is a trailer though so... that's worth noting.

The flavor was incredible. The broth was very milky and you could taste that 60-hour work they do on each batch. Everything else was perfect from the noodles to the brussel sprouts. We also had the mini Yodas as an app which were brussel sprouts with a sweet curry sauce on them. They were excellent. Good job you guys!

It's not easy to find freshly baked pastries that melt in your mouth and keep you yearning for more, unless of course you live near Avalon Park where Davis Bakery has become a household name. From the outside, Davis Bakery is very welcoming with plenty of seating space and big glass windows that allow you to peer in and view their delectable pastries. The inside is adorned in bright, pastel hues that really makes for a pleasant atmosphere. Once inside, the glorious smells of freshly baked goods hits you like a ton of bricks and you instantly begin to salivate over every delicious treat laid out in front of you in their pastry case. Their menu is simple, filled with common items such as bagels and breakfast breads as well as some not-so-common eats like quiche, unique breakfast bars and adventurous cream cheese flavors. My favorite thing to indulge in is definitely the cinnamon roll. Hands down, the BEST one I have ever had. It's very light and flaky with just the right amount of cinnamon and icing. Clearly not a healthy choice, but so worth the excess calories. Speaking of healthy...for those of you who are trying to stay away from diet sabotaging food items, rest assured that Davis does cater to you too! They have a zen breakfast bar that is filled with all kinds of good-for-you stuff and tastes wonderful as well as sandwiches that can be made with whole grain bread and stuffed with fresh veggies. From what I have heard, everything is made from scratch using fresh ingredients and on site in their own kitchen. Aside from food, they also serve coffee, espresso drinks and smoothies. However, being that this a bakery that specializes in pastries, cakes and sandwiches, their coffee/espresso drinks are not spectacular, but will do the job if you are in desperate need of a caffeine fix. Some things to be aware of...the front of the store is not very big so if and when it gets busy the line usually ends up extending out the door which can be uncomfortable. Also, since the sandwiches are made to order and pastries/bagels are heated as needed the line can move quite slow which is not a good thing if you are in a rush. Lastly, their prices aren't awful but can be high if you plan on ordering a lot of stuff. Overall, you should definitely check this place out if you haven't already done so.

I had a bit of dialogue with a very attentive and genuine General Manager and, as such, decided to give this place another shot.It has been awhile.They had a newly designed menu, the prices seemed ever-so-slightly less egregious.  The item count was also a bit more reasonable.The happy hour menu was considerably smaller than I remember.  When you have places like McCormick & Schmicks just down the street offering up a consistently, well prepared cheeseburger and fries for $3.99, it is extremely hard to justify a $6 McMenamins happy hour cheeseburger a la carte (+$2 to add fries, bringing it to $8).  So essentially, for what could be argued as the same meal, you're paying twice as much.  Furthermore...Keep in mind that McMenamins locations are notorious for serving \\"small\\" pint glasses that are not filled to the brim.  This has been blogged about and complained about numerous times across the internet.  JB is no different.  Both of my beers were served about 1 inch from the top, in what is already a smaller glass.  If I had to guess, most \\"pints\\" of beer for $3.50 were more like 13oz, tops.  McCormick & Schmick's serves pints overflowing and regularly gets to the 16oz mark.  I am not out of line here, people have actually gone to McMenamins locations with measuring cups and measured.I seriously implore JB to revisit their Happy Hour menu/pricing.They had two soups of the day, I can't honestly say whether or not they were frozen/canned as I do not have that great of a palette.  However, the peanut chicken soup was actually pretty flavorful (so much so that even a cup was almost too much).  I would actually get it again and I would say the portion was right on-par for the price.I felt the pour on the whiskey was actually less than a shot, I could be wrong, hard to judge with the tiny glass and the ice.  Nonetheless, the choices I went with tasted fine and the preparation was as requested.The beers I had were good.  McMenamins has never been terrible for beer, at least to me.  This still holds true.  The menu also included a new reasonably priced beer sampler, as well as a reasonably priced wine sampler (I don't drink wine, but will probably try this if/when I go again).The burger was much better than the last...20 or so I've had.  Maybe it is location dependent?  Past burgers were dry, dense, and flavorless.  This was not the case this time.  It was prepared as requested, the toppings were fresh instead of soggy, and it actually tasted alright.I'm on the fence as to whether or not $12 for the burger was reasonable.  A similar meal at Stanford's, which I would say has pretty flavorful beef preparations, is $14.  So is McMs good enough, but not as good, to warrant $12?  I guess your mileage may vary.  I would have to go back and see how it is in terms of consistency.The service this time around was friendly, and we were checked on multiple times, which I really enjoy.  I tend to eat fast and drink fast, so being given the opportunity to order more is worthwhile to me.For now, I am updating my review from sub-par to A-OK.  I could fairly easily bump this to Yay! I'm a fan if on future visits the service, food preparation, and drink quality remains consistent.I will go back, it is just a bit over a half mile from where I work so it is easily accessible.  I am curious to see if consistency will hold up, and if so, I could see myself spending money here periodically."},{"name":"A La Mode","address":"1689 Johnston Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent market option, the Chicken pot pie, French onion, and their crust are standouts."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The chicken tenders are amazing ...3 large chicken breast pieces Yum Yum.

They serve a large variety of desserts, and they are all massively huge. They all have a full menu for those who want regular food too. Most people probably couldn't eat one of the desserts by themselves, so I would encourage going with the intent to share.While the portions are large, the food itself isn't anything really special. The big appeal is the tourism draw for International Drive, which for a lot of us locals is actually a detraction.Service has been spotty the two times we've been. The first time we went, it was pretty bad. The waitress was gone more often than not, and we had to wait long periods of time for everything from refills to our check. This most recent time, we sat on the patio and the server out there was slightly better. He was very forgetful, and we wondered at one point if he was just tired or if he was on something. We had to remind him a couple of times what we had ordered.All in all, we weren't super impressed with this location either time we've been. Although the desserts are good, there are a lot of places in Orlando you can go to get good desserts with better service and fewer crowds.

The wuntun with noodles and beef brisket was middle of the pack in terms of flavour, quantity and quality.  The brisket had that nice hint of kumquat flavour but the meat was on the hard side.  One or two pieces looked like it had been sitting at the top of the pot and dried out a bit.   So not so good.  But the wuntun and the noodles were good as well as the soup.  I had also ordered the deep fried tofu and spicy sauce which was mid pack as well in terms of flavour quantity and quality.  Nice crispy outside and kinda moist inside.  Not much spicy flavour but good to dip in vinegar.  I was watching what others ordered and the fried rice looks good.

Her mother did not book the party package and when we went to sit a table we were told by the man behind the counter, Lee, that there were a lot of birthday parties that day and he would let us know when and if we could sit at a table. Every table was empty in the place and many without the party reservation signs. We then ask which bowling lane we can use and were again to that they were extremely busy that day and basically, not to hold our breath. Mind you at this time, there were literally about 15 people in the entire joint. As we stood baffled and offended at this point, a lady came up and helped Lee figure out which of the entire bowling alley that was currently completely not in use we could play on. When we tried to redeem the Groupon we bought so the kids could play laser tag he again told us don't count on it, as they were very busy that day and the reserved birthday parties have priority and they make \\"only $10 on Groupons\\".  Now, we are reasonable women and understand the reserved birthday parties have priority seating/laser tag, but the way Lee was talking to us basically said he couldn't care less if we were there or not. There ended up being plenty of room for the kids to bowl and play laser tag, but Lee was so completely unwilling to serve us with anything because we were there with a Groupon.

Enter Alden & Harlow. What a gem. The small plate focus appeals to me since it's my favorite way to eat. I love going out to eat with friends and sharing your food; trying a bit of this, a bit of that, and it makes the experience that much more social. The food is out-of-this world. Everything from the burrata, to the chicken-fried rabbit just blew me away. I didn't want to stop eating. You can really tell the food was created by someone who cares about food, and has a creative palate. The cocktails are also extraordinary, and let's not forget the ambiance. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, the contemporary design, the friendly staff, and simple menu layout adds to your experience. You really feel like nothing in the restaurant was given an after thought. I would recommend Alden & Harlow to anyone.

Upon entering the *tiny* shop, I was immediately hit with the aroma of fresh basil (a whole bunch of it was sitting on the counter).  I ordered our usual pepperoni and mushroom (the pizza by which we judge every pizza place).  I'm guessing my order somewhat frustrated the owner, who tried to point me to their specialty pizzas for my next visit (which I will be sure to take him up on).The owner asked if it was my first time there.  After indicating that it was, he insisted that I take a look at the wood burning oven and watch a pizza cook.  His enthusiasm for the process and the food is really reflected in the final product.  He explained that he can, but won't, cook more than one pizza at a time.  Each one requires his undivided attention as it sits on the bricks which have been heated to a bazillion degrees (he described how early he has to arrive to prep the oven each day).The pizza: crust was crispy (not crackerish) with some nice chewiness in the puffed up rim.  Sauce to cheese ratio - perfect (I don't like a TON of cheese on my pizza - and this cheese consisted of fresh mozzarella cut into strips - mmmmm).  What really struck me about the pizza, however, was the taste of fresh herbs I got in every bite.  It really just made my taste buds dance.Bono is definitely in the top tier of Columbus pizza.

YES it's greasy.  But as an occasional thing I'm not worried about it.   I feel safe saying this place has some of the best fries I've ever had. They were just divine.  My guy and I got a large fry and shared it.  I could have eaten more fries to be honest. They were so good.  But I was seriously full, I would have been eating them just because they were good.  A large fry is huge and definitely enough for two people to share.  As for the burger, I enjoyed my burger very much, it was absolutely better than a fast food burger, no competition.   They are messy... so grab lots of napkins and don't go there wearing your church clothes.  \\n  \\n  I was a little surprised though, I kept hearing all this hype about the toppings, that they have ANY topping you could want on a burger... wellllll... I can think of a few topping that I would want on a burger that they didn't have.  Not really something they should be docked for, but would really have loved some guacamole (charge extra if you must! How can you not offer this?!).  They have all the good standard stuff. I think the most exotic thing they offer as a topping is jalapenos. I got mushrooms and grilled onions on mine.  Along with the standard lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard, and ketchup.  You have to pay for extra cheese, but that's not a shocker, I don't know anywhere that doesn't charge for extra cheese. \\n  \\n  Price wise, it was more expensive than say McDonald's or something, but what do you expect... it's not a drive through restaurant, and the food is better and freshly made, AND completely customizable.  Come on now, how can you possibly still expect \\"fast food\\" prices.  I don't consider this place to be a fast food restaurant... it's like a hybrid blend of a sit down and a fast food. It's cheaper than Red Robin's burgers and more expensive than Wendy's or McD's. Fairly priced I would say.   The atmosphere was alright.  We had our 8 month old with us, he's pretty chill, enjoyed watching the cooks (which was kinda neat for us as well), they had lots of high chairs, and coloring stuff for older kids.  I would say it's very family friendly.  I wasn't a fan of the 'wall art' which consisted of all the reviews and comments from various magazines, news papers and where every else they found that stuff. Quotes from people praising the restaurant.  I don't know, I guess it irked me because it felt boastful? I kinda wanted to be like... yeah, I'm here, I'm eating your food, you can stop trying to sell me on it now!  The peanuts are cool, but we honestly forgot to get them, we talked about it on the way in, then we sat down and were watching the cooks and completely spaced the peanuts until we were done eating!  All in all, I liked Five Guys, will def go here again.  I guess as a recommendation I would say, if you don't like greasy tasty goodness (read: prefer the more healthy variety of food, or were once a vegetarian, or have high cholesterol) maybe take a pass on Five Guys Burgers and Fries.

My family came in for a late dinner on Saturday night. The server sat us right away, and his attitude set the tone immediately. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. He made solid vodka recommendations since they didn't carry my preferred martini makings, and I found a new favorite as a result. BTW, dude with the pony tail, your martini game is solid. Then, the food arrived. Oh, it arrived. Burger? Bad ass. Perfectly pink, well seasoned meat balanced nicely against the white cheddar and chilies. Fries? Please to be bringing more, please. We also had the pasta with calamari. Nicely done, fellows. The sauce was rich and flavorful without feeling heavy or packed with soggy tomato bits. I hate soggy tomato bits. They ruin a pasta dish. In any case, the calamari was really nice. Cooked to being done without being rubbery, lightly seasoned, and certainly a solid addition to the meal. Fish and chips? Bangin'. Not oily, not greasy, lightly fried and cleanly served. We're of foreign shores, from places where bitching about fish and chips competes with cricket for the national past time. Arguments against Charlie's fish and chips are futile. Resistance is useless. If you order these, they will be assimilated. In short: go. Go forth, and dine.

Since then, I've enjoyed the glory that is the Texas Taco Scene spanning from Austin to Dallas, and as a result, I'm a pretty stingy critic. Unfortunately for Tacodeli, they didn't quite cut it during my recent trip to Austin. Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?This part is a-okay. The staff at Tacodeli are brilliant, and they manage what can be lines of up to 30 minutes with a smile and some helpful insight. A varied interior seating arrangement can accomodate parties ranging from 2-10, and everything is comfortable and friendly with some local flavor. No complaints here. Star Granted.Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?My breakfast tacos came in at $2.95 each, which is essentially right on par with offerings from Torchy's, Velvet, La Ventana, etc. Check em out:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lnJlAU-2nQSLmmqBmvbyOQ&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHgCan't really complain. Star Granted.Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?This is where I came up a bit disappointed. While it may be a problem unique to the breakfast tacos due to the eggs, my tacos (one with steak and one with chorizo) were just kind of bland. It seems as though Tacodeli really pushes their homemade salsas (which were brilliant by the way, but that can't carry a mediocre taco on it's back), and I can see why. I would love to see them spice things up a little, and don't skimp on the meat! Additionally, the chips were flimsy, and the queso impossibly runny.

There was no flavor whatsoever.  No seafood flavor... the 4 shrimp and 6 tiny mussels were placed around the dish, like an afterthought.  The noodles were handmade, yet didn't have a fresh, chewy dough texture.  Instead, the noodles were kind of stale (not al dente) tasting.  The pork chop was great (also $18) and was a ton of food in comparison.  The linguine alla vongole also came in a tasteless water sauce.  That was $16.  What a rip.  For an $18 entree, I could've gotten an AMAZING meal at Brasserie TenTen in downtown Boulder.  Our server was okay... she kind of stayed her distance and our waters were pretty low until we were about to pay/leave.

The dish comes with a starter salad and a side of noodles with more less-than-desirable marina sauce.

Service was awful.\\n- Dinner: again, good but nothing revelatory.\\n- Habanero watermelon margarita...FINALLY! Something worth the hype.\\n----------------------------------\\nI came on two separate occasions, once for the bargain $7.95 brunch on Saturday and another time for the Restaurant Week 2-course dinner menu. Masa's another place that my friend and her friends kept raaving about. Brunch - 2 star experience overall.  Food would've been 3, maybe 3.5 stars. Their sweet cornbread comes with a trio of interesting spreads, the favorite of which was the habanero apricot jelly. Brunch special comes with an appetizer, and I ordered the fresh fruit, yogurt, and homemade granola...that was honestly my favorite part of the meal. The fruit was not super fresh, but that granola was GOOD. Just slightly sweet, very nutty, and with a strong crunch that you only get from something made in a kitchen that day. For the main entree, I had the huevos rancheros, which were served with beans. I had some of my friend's Eggs Benedict-like dish, though that biscuit they used was kind of gross and undercooked tasting. The potatoes on the side were mealy, eh .In my opinion, their menu doesn't really feature main dishes that are all that amazing...they're just alright and HUGE. Overall, a good value. But seriously, you're a nice restaurant...why do you only serve LIPTON black tea? What was NOT alright was their service...Damn that was like -1 star. First,  we seated ourselves outside and had to wait FOREVER for the server. When we told him we were there for the brunch, it took half a forever for him to come back with the brunch menus. But we already knew what we wanted right away, and he had the NERVE to say, \\"Well *I'm* not ready,\\" and walked away in a huff. Jerk! There were a million ways that it could've been said differently. He never checked on us and made a pathetic attempt to be charming at the end of the meal but it was too late. We were soured on the experience. Dinner - I came during Restaurant Week with a friend. The place was packed, but we were able to get a seat in the bar area. They must have a really small kitchen b/c apparently we could not order off the regular menu - just the bar menu ($1 individual tapas) or the RW menu. Oh well, I got the steak frites and the recovering vegetarian BFF got an off-menu stuffed Poblano pepper veggie option. While we waited for our food, we had the much hyped Habanero watermelon margarita....they infuse tequila with a habanero pepper for 24 hours and use fresh watermelon puree...Wooo, just a couple of sips and MUY CALIENTE! It's a kick with every sip, but surprisingly palatable and refreshing with the watermelon. I'll second the vote for this as the best cocktail in Boston. Food turned out quite good...we shared a gazpacho that was nice, but we both liked the salad with blue cheese even more.  The steak was cooked at a medium rare and the fries were addictively crunchy and still had some meat to them. Thank goodness they had the mind to include some veggies, albeit a tiny spinach salad. For dessert, their chocolate cake was rich and yummy but their vanilla flan with a subtle hint of lime was the winner.  When the waiter came to clear our plates, it was nice to have him actually encourage us to eat the last bite of food....instead of being like those obnoxious servers who comment on your membership in the Clean Plate Club (\\"Wow, I guess you liked it...\\" Thanks for reminding me that I'm a glutton).My friend has come here many times for dinner and says that it tends to just be OK....I'd agree.

Aside from offering wifi in the restaurant, which is a necessity these days, there's nothing \\"i\\" about it. I asked a few questions about the menu because it seemed very basic, and I was really looking for tacos al pastor, which they did not have. That seemed strange until I saw how they prepped the food. I decided on carne asada tacos instead. After placing my order, I walked down the line to watch my food being prepared and was absolutely blown away by what I saw, and almost asked for my money back right then - the woman took a few pieces of steak out of a tupperware container from the refrigerator and used a pair of tongs to place it on a pan and into one of those high speed convection ovens like the ones used to toast your sub at Subway or Cumberland farms. She then used the same tongs that had been sitting in the raw meat to take the meat off the platter and place it into the tacos. Maybe it had something to do with the low sales volume, but it didn't appear as though they actually owned a griddle, which is how this would've been cooked in an authentic mexican restaurant. Also, they used store-bought tortillas, which were a bit soggy and under-cooked instead of homemade ones. Another bad sign. The stale tortillas and overcooked, chewy, burnt meat were sitting atop black beans and the item was missing the usual onions & cilantro, as well as most of its flavor. The strongest flavor on the taco was the corn from the tortillas.

They opened at 11, and I got my food at 1:40.  They also said that by the time they reached me, they'd be out of turkey, ribs and pulled pork, leaving only their amazing brisket and very good sausage. They were right. So who in their right mind would wait a total of 4 hours for brisket? Me... And a couple hundred other people on a random Saturday morning. And was it worth it? Absolutely.The brisket is smoked for hours, until it just melts in your mouth. The problem with most brisket is either that it's not cooked enough or that it's cooked at too high a heat and ends up overcooked. This was beyond perfect, and destroyed all other brisket I've ever had. The outside had a perfect char. And they serve it up with good drinks: Big Red, Shiner Bock, and Austin Beerworks.The sides, and the sausage, were both good, and probably good enough that at other barbecue places, they would deserve some mention.

The she crab soup was creamy and smooth, no crab lump though, just crab favor.   Guess I had to try the fry chicken since all the visit magazines said it's the best, 2 days process blah blah blah.  I ask if I can have dark meat and the answer was no because they only serves breast.  I know that's not going to be good.   Turn out it wasn't too dry but wasn't moist either.  Japanese will cook chicken breast almost like tuna, just sear on the outside and almost transparent inside.   I know that's the extreme (but Japanese also eat chicken breast sashimi !), the point is I don't like chicken breast well done texture, thights is what I like from bird (unless they are the tiny squab or quail) .

Add Tabasco and bam!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't think of a better way to have started my day trip to Portland than with a stop for breakfast/brunch at the Screen Door. My only regret is not making it there 15 minutes earlier, to avoid the massive line (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327287114/in/set-72157623334891360/) which was wrapped around the restaurant waiting to get in, and caused me to just barely miss the coveted first seating of diners (they open at 9am). Even though I had to hang out at the bar (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326565761/in/set-72157623334891360/) for a bit and wait, I didn't mind too much since they had free coffee to pour yourself while you stand and chat with the people around you, trying to figure out how best to fulfill your appetite. There are quite a few specials here each weekend, so be sure to take a look up at the board to get the full descriptions (if I remember correctly the smaller menu handout only has a blurb). The hostess here was super nice, a trend I enjoyed for most of my time in Portland, and when she saw I was just by myself she managed to squeak me past a few other people who were ahead of me and sit me at her \\"favorite table\\" (although I'm not entirely sure why) right as the first person was leaving from the initial seating.The people dining in front of me seemed to be really enjoying (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327303478/in/set-72157623334891360/) their meals and the servers definitely seemed like quite the characters. I love it when people actually appear to be enjoying their job instead of just acting like you're another number and more money in their pockets. By this time I had already had a couple cups of the free coffee at the bar, and I was pleased to find out that the never ending cup continued once you sat down, so I had another while I waited to place my order. I already knew what I wanted, although I have to admit after seeing plate after monstrous plate of chicken and waffles come out I was really tempted to go in that direction, and if I ever get the chance to come back that's going to be at the top of my list. The prices here are so fantastic, especially when you consider the portion size, that I found it hard to stick to just one thing (which if you know my dining habits you would realize is virtually impossible regardless).Up first was a plate of brunch's finest stars combined into one amazing serving which they called \\"Fried Oysters Benedict.\\" It consists of cornmeal fried oysters with poached eggs and bacon over English muffins, topped with hollandaise, and served with potatoes (or cheddar grits if you choose) and is pretty damn intimidating once you have it set before you (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327307988/in/set-72157623334891360/). I can assure you, if you are fortuitous enough to order this you will leave a happy person. It was one of the single best dishes I've had anywhere, regardless of course or time of meal, as each ingredient stood out so well on its own, but combined to form fantastic bites when eaten together. The eggs were poached perfectly, and provided that wonderful yolk spillage you would expect, softening up the biscuits just right. The crispness of the bacon was a great contract, along with the fried oysters, neither one too overpowering to wash out the flavor of the egg. The potatoes acted nicely as a backdrop for the main part of the meal, sort of a palette neutralizer in between bites, allowing you to fully appreciate all the flavors.Unable to settle for just one type of bacon, I decided to also have a side order of the house specialty \\"Praline Bacon,\\" which I highly suggest for anyone dining here at any time it's offered. This stuff is just too damn good, and even though I already had bacon on my other plate, I kept coming back to this one (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327309936/in/set-72157623334891360/) because of the ideal pairing of sweet and salty. I'm not sure how they cook it to get all the elements so cohesive, but it was pure magic. I also wanted to try one of the daily specials, so I had a single serving of one of \\"Shane's Breakfast Corndog's.\\" They take a sweet sausage, fry it like a normal corndog, top it with powdered sugar and serve it with maple syrup on the side to dip in (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326578607/in/set-72157623334891360/). I had no idea what this would be prior to ordering it, I was sold on the name alone. Although it was a bit too sweet for me, I still really loved the creativity, and I ate about as much as my quickly filling stomach could handle.Screen Door is definitely a Portland experience you should not miss, especially if you're only here a short period of time. The people here are great, as is the food, and best of all it won't hurt your wallet on the way out.

Cowfish offers fusion cuisine, from sushi rolls to burgers and even burger-sushi. They are definitely catering to a crowd that may not be too familiar with sushi and that's totally fine. However, I felt like some of the Ingredients in the rolls were random and didn't really go that well together. For example we ordered the lobster roll with seared steak on top and the steak was way too chewy and the lobster meat tasted a little off, like they used the cartilage meat vs from the lobster tail. We also ordered their sashimi entree and although the portions are large, the quality of the fish was below average. The tuna still had stripes of sinew on it and made the texture unpleasant. The only highlight of the meal was the wait staff and the calamari appetizer.The overall ambience of the restaurant was also underwhelming and didn't match the excitement of City Walk itself."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I LOVE the Screen Door.

There was a terrific band playing, a dance area, half a dozen other food carts, and some of the friendliest people I've found in Austin in years.  The whole place reminded me of the kind of Austin experience I used to have all the time when I was in college here 20 years ago.  The owner of the whole courtyard (and also the magic behind Honky Tonk Hot Dogs) sat down and chatted with my mom for about 10 minutes about his chili recipe.

The falafel was so moist as well, not dry or dusty at all... something tells me I've had gross falafel balls in my past? And the odd little non-feta touch was the Gorgonzola - which I could do without, I found, despite our love with one another.

This, along with the food, beer selection, service and crowd, is what differentiates the Pig from the Mission, which feels forced and manufactured, with identical tables, decor that could have been purchased at Home Goods and staff that take themselves far too seriously. The Squealing Pig is a real gem, and if you're looking for a quirky, cozy neighborhood place with an amazing vibe and menu, the Pig is it."},{"name":"Brother's Pizza & Grille","address":"121 Trapelo Rd","city":"Belmont","stars":"3","text":"Brother's used to be my favorite pizza place, and now it is not.  For two reasons:The lesser reason:  The pizza used to be awesome, but lately it has been not-awesome.  Can't say why exactly.  Maybe the crust changed, maybe they've been skimping on the toppings.The much more important reason:  Brother's wronged me!  When I lived in Watertown, and even before I lived in Watertown, I was a loyal Brother's sister for years.  Then I moved to Strawberry Hill, a stone's throw from Brother's, but technically in Cambridge, CLOSER than I have ever lived before.  Walking distance.

We lost our appetites after one landed on the home fries. Once our food came our waitress became inattentive so we told the nice busboy about the flies ... he said, \\"Ok.\\"  For starters they could take the bus trays into the back, not leave 3 of them on the diner floor.

However my biggest gripe is with their inconsistent portioning. I watched a person in front of me get a lone pad thai that was heaping in size but when I ordered, it was coincidentally with a number of other people who also ordered pad thai. All of the portions when she split it were super tiny, basically a half portion. The amount of noodles in my box was the same size as my closed fist. It seems whenever the lady batches a pad thai order and splits it, she cannot portion out properly and ends up serving everyone tiny portions. This is not the first time this has happened to me and my coworker. I really just wish there were more noodles. This size was definitely not worth $10.Edit: Disappointing to see the owner so unable to take criticism. Instead of taking the time to think of ways you could improve your portioning consistency (e.g. perhaps pre-prepared portions) you blamed me for not asking for more noodles and for possibly having bias from being \\"just really hungry\\". You could have offered the suggestion of asking for more noodles next time as a solution but it was presented combatively and paired with the Subway comment.

There are plenty of tables, several booths, and quite a large bar, but you can see how it would become crowded very quickly. They also have a cute enclosed outdoor seating area with several tables for when the weather is cooperative.I have heard a lot about this place and was pretty excited that for my first time here I didn't see a line out the door when I arrived - partially because it was after an ice storm. Anyway, we were seated quickly and while our hot chocolate was out-of-this-world delicious I couldn't shake the awkward vibe from our waitress. When asked for our drink order we asked if they offered any kind of hot breakfast cocktails and the response we got was, \\"Like what?\\" **crickets** *not offering any options* **crickets** It was like the waitress was annoyed that we didn't have anything specific in mind, all the while giving us a look like, \\"I'm waiting...\\" Hey, I'm in the customer service industry myself and I understand the need to be able to do things quickly and move on to the next person, but when someone asks me an open-ended question, particularly one about my field of expertise, I can usually throw a few suggestions out there because that's what's expected of me. I think she sensed our annoyance with her 'tude, so all interactions from then on out were very short and awkward. She cut us off several times while ordering because I guess we weren't doing it fast enough.As for the food - everything on the menu sounded decent, but nothing really jumped out as something I REALLY wanted to try. I ended up with the praline bacon waffle and left the restaurant in a diabetic coma. Not really, but you should be warned that this dish is RICH! One big waffle with four huge dollops of the thickest whipped cream/butter you've ever had, coupled with a piece of pecan-covered bacon draped fancily over the top and a side of syrup. It was very good, but there was no way I could finish the whole thing. My other half ordered the fried chicken buttermilk biscuit sandwich with a side of the roasted potatoes which he said was good, not great.That's just what this restaurant was for me - good, not great.

The place has a distinctive tex-mexy smell and is relatively bustling most evenings, but calmer in the afternoons.They don't take reservations and will force you to wait for your full party to arrive before seating you, so coming here with a large or unorganized party is a real hassle.  I tried this place with a party of 8. Four of us arrived early and 4 more would arrive about 40 minutes later. The early group asked for a table for 8 and were told we'd have to wait for our full party, so we asked for a table for 4 and were told that when the rest of the group showed up they would have to wait for their own table, or we would have to leave our table and wait with them in order to sit with them.  Fine, we'll take the table and when the rest of our party arrives we'll pay our bill and wait for a new table with them.We sit down, order drinks and appetizers and when the waitress asked what we wanted for dinner we told her we were going to be moving tables when the rest of our party came.

My friend and I shared a philosopher's pie (feta, kalamata olives, portabello mushrooms, beef). delicious.  the highlight of mellow mushroom is their delicious wheat, gluten-free crust.  It always takes awhile since everything is made to order, so its definitely not a place to stop in for a quick bite, but the wait is definitely worth it.  I believe they do sell pre-made slices around lunchtime though.  For a pizza joint, they have a pretty extensive beer and wine list, as well as a full bar, but I guess thats a very Austin-like feature.

I was really impressed that it tasted as good as it sounded.  The dressing was light and summery and the goat chees tart thing was really tasty.  Then I had the baked ravioli- which was mediocre, the ravioli was too soggy, but it had potential.\\nMy boyfriend had mussels which he enjoyed and some meaty dish that I can't remember, but he also enjoyed.  We also ordered a side of fries with smoked cheddar and they were yummy, really yummy.  \\nDrinks-  I had the best pineapple infused vodka!  It was great.  I then tried the orange infused one which I didn't like as much.  Overall- def a place I will go again.\\n______________________________________________________Okay, went there again the other week because we had a good experience the first time...Did you know you should make sure to ask that your cheesy fries NOT come with scraps of calamari?! As a vegetarian of 13 years, it was great to learn this new information.  Needless to say I was pretty pissed and the manager response was wildly inappropriate- essentially telling me that I should have informed them that I don't eat seafood when ordering my fries...logic?  In the end, he dealt with it well (comped the whole meal), but was happy that he did that because the mushroom ravioli we had was not good at all- the sauce was very not good.  Also, we sat in the \\"cafe\\" area and the service was horrendous!  Our \\"waiter\\" was really more like a busboy and refused to serve us in any capacity.  So needless to say I was hugely disappointed in our experience this time.  The service was terrible, the food was bad, and the manager dealt with the situation poorly at first, but redeemed himself.  That - and that I had a positive experience last time, makes me feel like I will give the restaurant another shot and why I did not drop the rating down further."},{"name":"Nelore Churrascaria","address":"115 E Lyman Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Having been to the \\"other\\" Brazillian steakhouse on I-Drive numerous times, I was eager to try this one.

Once the rest of our party came, they were offered drinks also, and then it was off to the races. The salad bar was ok, they need a little less of the froo froo stuff and some normal items.

There wasn't that many people there so I was concerned that the meat would not be as good, however it was. It was all very hot and very flavorful. I did think it was less salty than other places.

It was super duper tasty and tender! The whole time we were eating it, we kept saying, \\"Wow, this is good.\\" We ordered a pound of the brisket and half was fatty and the other half, lean. Normally, I don't eat the fat on meat but man oh man was that fatty brisket delicious! We also got the sausage and that was good, not great. We also ordered the beans and that compliments the BBQ perfectly!All that said, their beef brisket is the BEST BBQ I've ever had, but I wouldn't go back just because of the long wait.

Could have used more butter. The Mac and cheese was to die for, not overly salty as some are, great texture and taste. The fried chicken was perfectly done, crispy on the outside, the coating was not too thick, definitely perfect for my taste, and still moist on the inside. I was not expecting the meatloaf to be as good as mine but it was delicious. The bacon wrapped around it added another element to the complexity of different tastes.  Excellent. Few people can make kale as well as Revival. It was not bitter at all!! Desert was banana pudding and although I was satisfied with the amount of food was glad there was still room for it.

Tonight was great (last time was crazy slow service with TERRIBLE  seating, I mean...right next to the host stand with foot traffic on either side).  So tonight, we sat immediately, got our wine right away, and apps like 2 minutes after ordering (just soup and salad).  If our waitress wasn't there, the floor manager or another server was ready to help (and did).  I ordered the trout special and DAMN what a surprise.  Loads of fresh green beans, and topped with delicious capers and fresh tomatoes.  The trout was coated with rosemary... which completely won me over... I'm a huge fan of rosemary.  My friend Amy ( a new  Grad student at Longy in Cambridge woo! And I'm going to get her hooked on Yelp) Got a nice fresh goat cheese and sun-dried tomato salad.

Let me begin by saying I am a very laid back customer and have been a waiter myself and rarely write reviews, so me taking the time writing a negative review should tell you something.  Where to start... Took literally 9 minutes for a waiter to come to my table despite there being at least 3 servers on duty in a place with only about 12 tables, 3 others of which were empty. One waiter came over and dropped of a menu at about 6 minutes in only because I was giving a full-bore \\"I need service here\\" stare and body posture, but then proceeded to service the table he already had next to mine and then leave!  At this point nobody had even said a word to me, no drinks yet, not even silverware... barren table with a customer staring at the staff for minutes on end to see when they'd notice and come over.  Did I mention the waiter service station was about 15 feet away in plain veiw where the waiters congregate to input orders?When I finally got a waiter they didnt even acknowledge their mistake and offer and apology, just said \\"Oh, okay what can I get you?\\" Really?And then the food: ordered a simple cheesburger cooked medium, since at that point over 10 minutes had elapsed and I had a flight to catch.  10 more minutes and I get a burger best described as blackened, with bacon that had probably seen 20 seconds of grill time.  They bring the food, my drink is empty, do they offer to refill it or anything like any normal restaurant?  Nope, I had to hold it up and ask for a refill with the last of patience.  Choked down the brick of a burger and paid.  I left no tip, which I have done only once or twice ever before in my life.Just eat somewhere else, don't patronize this junk of a place with your hard-earned dollars."},{"name":"Barrel & Boar Creekside","address":"121 Mill St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"Just checked them out for the first time tonight at the food truck festival.

My girlfriend and I came from San Antonio to try this place out for my birthday. I had been looking at Yelp all week and I would see pics of the crazy lines so the last thing I wanted was for us to go and they run out of food. I emailed Franklins and asked what time they thought we should get there, we were going on a Friday morning and it was also the first day of SXSW so I didn't know if that would affect traffic. We left 5am and got there at about 7:15, I was super excited to see there was only 5 people waiting in line. The guy who was first in line had gotten there at 5:45am BRAVO TO YOU SIR!!! I TIP MY HAT TO YOU lol We brought lawn chairs (even though they have a couple there to use) and a cooler of beer. The line didn't start picking up til about 9ish. A lady comes down the line and asks what you wanna order just to get an idea. Unfortunately they only have beef Ribs on Saturday's. They also open up a side door to their bathrooms at about 8 so you can use them during the long wait. The wait went by fast which was awesome!!!! They opened right at 11 and we went right on it. We got 1lb of fatty brisket, half pound of lean, 1 lb of pork ribs and a side of cold slaw and potato salad. The sides were pretty good  but the brisket and ribs were definitely something else. The smoke ring on the brisket was beautiful and every piece had bark on it. Even the lean pieces were super moist (I'm not a fan of lean brisket but my gf is so she's the one that ordered it) but I was even impressed with the lean. The ribs were hands down the star of the show!!!!! The first bone I grabbed the meat just fell off, I mean just melted off LIKE BUTTER!!!! I've tried some awesome BBQ places before but those were hands down some of the best ribs we've had. I would honestly go back and order about 5lbs just for myself LOL overall I would say this place is definitely worth the wait if you go at a descent time. A lot people got there super late so obviously they probably encountered them running out of food. The weekends is what seems to get pretty crazy so I would try a weekday if you can. We were prepared for all forms of weather cuz obviously we live in Texas, we had our jackets, a blanket and even a couple umbrellas in case of rain. Hands down I would say worth the wait, if you can't stand waiting in line for more than hour then don't even try lol we even took some snacks and stuff to munch on while we waited as well \\nFranklins is definitely an experience all on it's own.

So I took a look at their menu and was intrigued with the items. After walking around to check out the other menus, I had to go back. It was rainy, cold and I thought it would be perfect. And it was!I had the Clam Chowder (chowdah!) which was very good. The soup itself was nice and creamy though I wish there was more seafood. I got a few pieces of potatoes which is fine by me since I shouldn't be having them but may have been a disappointment to some. The crust was perfection! Was great to either have it soak in the soup or eating it by tearing it off and dipping it. I thoroughly enjoyed the soup and if I lived here, it would definitely be a go-to of mine.

The service is front and center, starting with the friendly valet and continuing on to warm welcomes as you enter the lovingly restored home on Church Street.Arrive before your reservation to enjoy a cocktail at the bar, and take in the comfortable, homey decor. I recommend the gin rickey, a bright green and refreshing summer beverage. It's delicious. When you're ready to be seated, you'll be escorted from the bar (yes, your tab will transfer) and seated in the warm, lively main dining room, where it's not unusual to strike up a conversation with the guests at the next table. It's the relaxed atmosphere, paired with exceptional food and service, that really makes Revival work.I'm happy to report the restaurant can accommodate gluten allergies. Many of the items are already gluten free, and some can be altered. Sadly, the gorgeous-looking cornbread and the tea sandwiches are verboten for Celiacs. Our table of two started with an hors d'oeuvres plate of heirloom tomatoes with local cucumbers and sweet onions. Expertly seasoned with fresh herbs, this dish is a fantastic foil for the Atlanta heat. We moved on to enjoy two entrees: Georgia quail glazed with roasted honey and garlic; and the special of the evening, beautiful Georgia shrimp served with tomatoes and rice with one of the most heavenly sauces I've had the pleasure of eating. Simply divine. For sides, we opted for the fresh field peas and butter beans served with dill and the old-fashioned creamed potatoes. Both were excellent and paired well with our main courses. Washed down with a bottle of their Gamay wine, my meal at Revival is one I'll remember for years to come. I'm already looking forward to my next visit."},{"name":"Misto Cafe","address":"3801 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The sandwiches here are really freakin good.

It was absolutely packed on our Christmas Eve visit, and the hostess was personally greeting guests who she already seemed to have a good rapport with. I'd take off a star simply because of the lack of variety in seafood. (Under their seafood section, why are there only shrimp and scallops? Where's the crab? Oh they have crab sushi.

Well read on fellow Yelpers....The place was busy when we arrive....tons of happy hour goers enjoying life, so that was a great sign for us. We decided to be seated in the restaurant and were greeted and seated right away. We waited a few moments until our server came up, offered us water and gave us our menus...so far so good....we ended up ordering:Drinks: Basil grape refresher, the grapes were hand pressed with vodka....it does what it says...definitely refreshing and one of the best drinks I've had in a long time...so good I had a few! Hazelnut martini-decadent and delicious...Lemon drop, one of the best this girl has had-not too sweet and over the top.For starters, we got:Red curry mussels great spice and full taste. I was a bit skeptical because I'm not a big fan of curry but this was very well done, not too heavy on the palate but just right.  Clam chowder-really good! Being from SF, i know a good chowder, i loved how you got big chunks of clams in every bite! And these clams were not from a can! Yum! Beet and cucumber salad-tasy and earthy. The cucumber was a great balance to the beets. Shrimp cocktail-HUGE portions! Fresh and perfect. Fish and chips-I have a fixation with fish and chips and must order it if it's offered on the menu. The fish were large, almost like fist sized nuggets and it was delicious. The food was good, so why the three stars? It was absolutely unusual how the food came out....mussels came first...then 20 min later out came our chowders....then the salad...another fifteen minutes go by and i'm wondering where the duck is my shrimp cocktail???  Still no shrimp cocktail but my fish and chips come out.  We finally get the elusive shrimp cocktail at the end of our dinner....almost like dessert....hmmmm...By that time, I didn't even want them. Maybe, it's just me but I like to get my appetizers in the beginning of the meal. It was just a clusterduck of a mash of a meal. Tasty but confusing with no fluidity. The server didn't seem on her game, our waters stayed unfilled for what seemed like ages. Our server was nice enough but the entire meal service was just poorly executed."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Okay.... updated review time. Personally I'm not a big fan of updating reviews because most places I frequent don't get better or worse over time BUT this place is an exception. BTW normally after one bad experience I refuse to go to that restaurant again unless dragged there.So, since my last review I've been here a few times, I have been dragged here a few times and most of the experiences have been really good (except for one truly horrifying one) but the overall impression I've gotten is that the place is better overall. I'll start with the bad experience because it was so bad, I have to write about it. Now, I'm familiar with exceptionally busy restaurants AND I definitely understand turnover. However what happened this particular time was something I have never EVER encountered. So my friends and I got here super early and were some of the first people in line waiting for the restaurant to open. Once we had placed our order we were seated at a table and our food came promptly. Then things started to go south (not foodwise but servicewise). Any time there was a lull in eating (which is normal in conversation and dinner with friends) a member of the waitstaff would come by and ask if we were done with our plates. Almost everyone's plates were about 2/3 full still. It was so bad that at one point a waitress came by and asked to take our plates, we told her we were still eating, and then, no lie, 10 seconds later another waitress walks by and asks the EXACT SAME QUESTION. I mean I get that you guys are busy, but that was ridiculous. Then once we finished eating we sat at our table for literally a minute or two before a member of the staff came up and asked us to \\"give up our table\\". In all my years of dining, I have NEVER EVER had that happen. I'm even talking about other ramen powerhouses on the west coast that are yelp monsters with close to 3000 reviews (think about that line and wait for a table). I was so stunned that I wrote a tip about it because I was so angry. My stance is that I rarely ever \\"real time\\" yelp unless it's amazingly good or bad. Unfortunately that case was the latter. However rant aside, I am overall bumping my previous review up by 2 stars.Since that one catastrophe I was extra reluctant to return but without fail, some of my other friends wanted to try it, so I agreed to come along. Now why the 2 star increase? Because I'll be honest the food IS better. They've changed their Chashu bowl recipe and it as as scrumptious as I originally remembered it. This is definitely one of the must tries on the menu. In addition, while I still wish their broth was a little \\"deeper\\" I've realized that adding a \\"corn on the bomb\\" adds the depth and milkiness that I seek so I'm quite happy. The Chashu slice that comes with the #1 (tonkatsu original) is also delicious! Tender and perfectly fatty, it melts in your mouth. Since I get both the #1 AND a Chashu bowl I don't add an extra slice of Chashu to my ramen because that's just too much pork for me. However if I decided to pass on the Chashu bowl any one of these days, I would definitely tack on another slice of Chashu to my ramen. Overall, I really like the food here now. Since that one disastrous waitstaff faux pas I haven't had any other stories of horror to report so I feel the improvement in food warrants a better rating. I'd definitely check it out if you're in the Austin area and looking for a bowl of ramen."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"2728 New Spring Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"This was probably the worst restaurant experience we have ever had.

We always get the original foster burger and a side of fries.  Tonight was no different.  It was our date night, and with 5 kids, this is no easy accomplishment (we had to pick up our son from the movies a little over an hour after ordering).  We were seated immediately, and placed our usual order, 2 foster burgers rare with a large fry, couple of Tecates.  Nothing too crazy.  Recently, it looks like they opened up a new area of the restaurant, and the patio was open, so there were a few extra patrons at the restaurant, which was pretty busy (typical for a Friday night). Usually we wait around 10-15 minutes to get our food.  Tonight, after 25 minutes, I asked if the waiter could check on our order, to see where it was in que.  He let us know there were a few tickets ahead of us.  Ok, no big deal, 5 - 10 more minutes maybe, right?Unfortunately, we waited 35 more minutes before our FRIES showed up.  At this point, we had received a text from our son letting us know his movie was done, and we needed to pick him up.  So, we asked the waiter to pack it up to go. Took 10 minutes for that to happen.So, to sum it all up, we waited an hour for fries, were late to pick up our son, and had cold soggy burgers and fries by the time we got home.  This was the first time I haven't left a tip in I don't know how long.

Screen Door is absolutely wonderful. The decor is so lovely and just what you would expect with the name. I've been there three days in a row and the food is great. The service was amazing. Polite, friendly and thrilled to serve you and your needs. Thomas in particular was great. I adore his thoughtfulness and professional services you don't normally see in a small atmosphere. He was so friendly as well, which is why we came back a third time. * The Fried Oysters are to die for. The crust was crunchy with just the amout of seasoning to come through beautifully, yet extremely tender inside. \\n* Gumbo  was classic.\\n* Fried Okra was yummy no sauce required.\\n* Lemonade also was done suburbly with a sweet/ sour balanced. \\n* Po Boys done like home. \\n* Pulled pork was tender with just a perfect of kick. \\n* Low Country Breakfast Shrimp Grits are extremely tasty. Too fishy my hubby stated, which means perfect to me. \\n* The grits were done like my grandmother's,  no lumps and just enough cheddar being salty. \\n* Biscuits and Gravy were very nice, need a little work on their biscuits but that may have been one batch. Need that moisture. \\n* Chicken and Waffles was a true hit. Chicken had the right amount of coating, deep fried while  tender piece of chicken inside. Perfect sweet potato waffle. Combination was superb. \\n* Fried Green Tomatoes are just so crispy and deliriously delicious. \\n* Truthfully, I personally did not like the drumsticks. Should use the same as the chicken throughout. This coating seem to just dry them out, but I only tried once. This place is so good, I'm going back again. With this kind of serve and the varieties of items to offer, I have plenty of reasons for them to know me by name and sight.

The avocados are lightly breaded and fried along with your choice of shrimp or chicken and the entire thing is a tender, delicious experience.  The tortillas the food comes wrapped in are okay, but nothing special.  The fries are similar, which makes it seem like Mighty Cone focuses mainly on the contents of the cone and not as much on the sides.  You might want to consider skipping the fries and going for another cone instead.Their specials are impressive, to say the least.  We've seen several interesting cones there, slinging the sort of thing you might expect to see plated thoughtfully at their parent restaurant Hudson's, like the Purple Pig (pulled pork and red coleslaw) or a cone containing quail and spinach with a bacon dressing that was amazing and unexpected in cone form!The chicken/shrimp and avocado are always solid, and try the specials!"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best meal I had while I was staying in Portland with my boyfriend.

The person who was supposed to be answering the phone was sitting down at the bar watching TV.  I ordered the Santa Fe egg rolls and tacos al pastor.  The egg rolls were very good and they came with an avocado-type dipping sauce that had a little kick to it.  The tacos were just OK.

Neither my beef brisket sandwich nor my boyfriend's pulled pork sandwich came with the barbecue sauce cooked into the meat- we had to add our own from bottles on the table, like ketchup on a burger. At that point, it's not particularly barbecue-y, though you did have the option of mixing and matching different flavors of barbecue sauce. The side dishes were disappointingly small and sad. At first, the price of the food seems like a great value, but once you see the size of the meal, it really isn't. The Mac and Cheese was dining-hall, supermarket-bought caliber, nothing special, and in a very small serving, though I did like their idea of crumbling barbecue chips on top. Like the barbecue sauce, it would have tasted better if they'd cooked it into the mac and cheese instead of adding it afterward.Most of the food I got arrived cold in places, and the restaurant itself was quite chilly.

This could easily have been my meal for the day; breakfast, lunch and dinner. The chicken was seasoned well, crispy and oh so good. The waffles were great as well.-Lowcountry breakfast grits & shrimps (5/5-$14.95): I got to sample a bit of my friend's cheddar grits and it was A-mazing! The shrimp was also cooked to perfection.

The wait for a table is long, we had to wait about 2 hours to get a table. By the way the parking in the area is max 2 hours, so I couldn't help but feel anxiety as I ate at the highest rated restaurant. After finally being seated took about 2 walk-by's which is about 10 minutes for our server to finally deliver my Coca-Cola. Took almost 30 minutes to finally get our food. I guess everything takes forever since it's organic? I ordered the 2 piece of Chicken and waffles, macaroni & cheese. Honey ordered the Shrimp with grits and overrated jambalaya. We also had the banana dessert. My Chicken-Waffles were really good, the macaroni and cheese I'd have to disagree with Brie but they were not the best I have ever tried. I felt they were to salty. Honey enjoyed the Shrimp and grits. I tried the jambalaya and the flavor of the sausage I guess overpowered the rice and other ingredients. It was not good and when I say I tried I mean only one spoon and I was over it. Between eating took 4 walk-by's which was about 15 mins to get refills on my 1 Coca-Cola I ordered. Took maybe 10 minutes to finally get our servers attention to get our check. If they can't cook the food any faster at least be more attentive to your patrons.

There's two floors and we always go to the second floor for dim sum.

We go here at least one Sunday a month for brunch and always get xiu mai and ha cao and whatever else we feel like that day. It's all your typical dim sum fare: an assortment of dumplings, steamed buns, tripe, chicken feet, calamari. The servers/cart pushers don't really speak English and are somewhat dismissive but that's almost expected at typical Asian restaurants. Complimentary tea is always served and you can request either jasmine or chrysanthemum tea. They also have soda and if you and maybe two or three other people want the same soda, order a liter and save yourself a couple of dollars.

Then we were introduced to the most professional, knowledgeable member of Stefano's staff-- a 9 year old old girl who carries herself WAY wise & mature beyond her years. She knows that business. She explained how everything is made in house, from sauces to sausages. She showed us a wine menu while we waited for our table to open up. She was completely adorable yet professional at the same time. I'm not really a kid person especially in fine dining establishments BUT she is the example that others need to follow. Our table of four was seated and although we knew that were were going to do the MDM menu, we also were going to get sides and salads that weren't part of that menu. Their house salad was crisp and with just the right amount of dressing. I told them no tomatoes or onions & they stuck to that but added some extra cucumber and carrots for me. I personally had the shrimp & gouda flatbread as my appetizer,  Our waiter Erik told us that they were out of Delmonico steaks but that they would substitute the porterhouse for that instead if that was alright. UMMMMM... DUH!! That wasn't a hard decision at all! The steak was cooked perfectly and it had to be about 20 oz+ of meat.. My bf and I got the sides of asparagus (which had just the right amount of pepper and sea salt) & scalloped potatoes.

I've had the crabby Benedict, Cuban sandwich, quiche and a pork mac&cheese sandwich  and all were amazing and worth the calories. The desserts I've tried have all been great and I love the tea. All in all, a great place to try and worth the drive if you're not close by. It is small so I wouldn't recommend for a group bigger than 5 or 6 at a time.

It moves incredibly slow but they've got collapsible chairs and they bring around beers, which makes the whole thing much more bearable. They even brought around some free sliders which were a nice touch. Everything here is good. Turkey, sausage, etc. but if you're just gonna get one thing make it the brisket. Literally the best I've ever had by far. Would suggest you get some fatty and some lean.

So from the outside this restaurant is nothing special and parking was sparse believe it or not.  But once we got inside it was one of the best dining experiences my fianc√© and I have ever had.  We got a nice corner table for two and instead of straight back chairs, we were seated in comfy arm chairs with pillows to go behind your back.  I could see someone with back problems not liking it, but for those with young backs, it was a nice way to relax.  They have a selection of martinis that are more desert martinis than anything, but to have before a meal they work well.  The highlight of the meal was the soup, it was a parsnip puree with white truffle oil and little crispy (shallot/onion/?)...crispy goodness on top.  I'm not a huge soup fan and this was one of those dishes that you really getting bummed about when it's gone.  It was that good.    I had the Vanilla Duck Breast which was a little sweet for my taste, but it was still an enjoyable experience.  I did also sneak a piece of the wood grilled fillet which was perfectly cooked and had an amazing crust on it with just the right amount of charing to give it some good flavor.

I highly recommend the Farmers Daughter if your in the mood for a fun fruity drink. For dinner I have had both the bento and tuna rice burger. Their bentos really are the best bang for your buck. If you can't decide between a burger or sushi this will satisfy both. As for the What's shaken tuna bacon rice burger it is one of the most unique things I have ever eaten. It is a partially seared and blackened tuna served with jalape√±os, lettuce, bacon and a rice/rice paper bun. It is an acquired taste, but very flavorful. I feel all the flavors complemented each other well, but were a bit overwhelming for my palate. I would order it if you like sushi, but you're in the mood for something more adventurous.

Prior to opening The French Table, owner Herve Martin had run the long-standing Hermitage on Robson Street for 24 years.We stopped by in late March for dinner. One side of the restaurant appears to be a bit more open and brighter than the other side but we wound up near the back where the lighting is much dimmer (hence the dark pictures).First to the table was the complimentary crusty bread and butter. This is really one of the reasons why I love French restaurants... I know it's just filler but there's something about fresh, crusty bread that gets me every time.We ordered some Escargot ($15) traditionally prepared with garlic butter. This is a simple dish and the snails weren't rubbery.Of course, if there's any dish that you should order at a French restaurant, it's French onion soup. Their Soupe a l'oignon ($14) is made with emmental cheese which is a medium-hard Swiss cheese. Seriously loved the cheesy pull of this soup and could eat this all day long.The Coq Au Vin ($28) is prepared with free range chicken marinated in red wine and mushrooms with pearl onions and bacon. This dish is quite good with fork-tender chicken.The Duck Confit Cassoulet ($29) with stewed white beans, duck legs, braised pork, and Toulouse sausage was a bit on the salty side but I did think the Toulouse sausage was really good.We finished our meal with an order of Chocolate Mousse ($9) served with whipped cream and roasted almonds.Highlights of our meal were definitely the coq au vin and soupe a l'oignon."},{"name":"Nosh On Seventh","address":"2030 SE 7th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I ordered their St. Patricks day special.

Bottom line is that it has very good comfort food and very large servings.  I have never eaten anything here that wasn't fantastic.  My only tip is to drink the beer.  The mixed drinks are a bit of a disappointment and quite a bit more $$. I had the porch lemonade but it wasn't lemonade this past time. It was soda water with a squeeze of lemon juice.  It was ok but for $10 they should use fresh squeezed lemonade.Every one of the dozen times I have been here there has been quite a long wait but it is worth it.  Hostesses are usually a little rude but the servers have always been great.  Sometimes it takes a long time to get your food and it can be VERY loud inside.Tip #2.

It was my favorite place to eat, to drink, to sit and watch people, to talk, to take dates, and then it closed.  That was \\"Diem\\" owner Andy Alibaksh's first Atlanta venture, Cafe Diem, and one of the very best things about Atlanta in the '90s.When lease rates in that block skyrocketed, Andy moved his cafe to an unlikely location, the Midtown Promenade shopping center, next to the movie theatre then called the Midtown 8.  Good move on his part, and much happiness to those of us who missed Cafe Diem.  The new place?  Apres Diem, a little play on words that would only make sense to those of us who'd been to Cafe.Same Mediterranean menu, same eclectic waitstaff, same hip vibe, same hip clientele, same coffeehouse/bistro feel, and same funky art, interior decorating, low lighting, and global music that made it perfect for a romantic date, a gathering with friends old or new, a first date, a last date, or a quick bowl of soup and glass of wine before seeing an indie or foriegn film at the movies next door.Before I became a vegetarian I indulged in the nightly specials, everything from sea bass and swordfish to wild boar and ribeyes, all flavored uniquely and fantastically, key word being \\"flavored\\" - the \\"specials\\" were always wonderful and very special.  The regular menu items became favorite standbys: The Salmon Ciabatta sandwich ($7.95) - a grilled salmon filet on ciabatta bread with sun dried tomato manyonnaise became my usual, with a glass of Pinot Grigio a perfect accompaniment.  Or the Salmon Farfalle ($8.95) - \\"Sauted salmon, button mushrooms, roma tomatoes, zucchini, and peas in a sambuca-thyme cream sauce with bow tie pasta.\\" - to die for!The food at Apres Diem, like its predecessor Cafe Diem, has always been about earthy sensual flavors, with a Mediterranean edge.  Admittedly, I've only dined once at Apres since going veg, and I'm not sure there's much on the menu for me anymore, but I intend to give it a try, see how well the waitstaff and kitchen can accomodate.  Meanwhile, if you're an ominivore, I could not recommend more highly the food, and the ambiance, varied drink menu, and desserts will please almost everyone.

The pizza has a bit of a kick, like there is some pepper in their sauce. Its really enjoyable.  The crust is even tasty, and I'm really picky when it comes to pizza crust. Warning: If you don't like greasy pizza or a buttery crust or a cheesy pull with each bite-- steer clear. This is where you'll find all of these things.

There were 5 adults and 2 kids in our group. Our friends ordered baguettes to share, butter, caffe latte and a ham & cheese sandwich. The lady at the counter provided an amazing customer service. She even looked like a French lady ! While my friend was slicing the baguette, the French owner showed up and was extremely rough with her, claiming she would damage his table. He should have offered to slice the bread instead. While I was ordering, he interrupted his employee, informing her she should charge a fee when customer ordered baguettes to eat in and instruct them not to damage his $ 250 tables. I asked the lady if they had any gluten free bread for my husband and the owner jumped in to answer the question and came up with a speech comparing the price of a bag of regular wheat flour and a bag of gluten free flour. They did have fruit salad but my husband decided to go to another cafe not to deal with the owner rough manners. I ordered a ham & cheese croissant, macaroons, coffee and had some of my friend's baguette with butter. We all agreed everything was delicious. One of the best croissant and French baguette I have ever had, but I would not return there due to the owner lack of good customer service.

The brisket had for tiny slices but did taste good.  The pulled pork was just plain unbelievable.  Wish I had taken a picture.  I'd say enough for 1/4 of a sandwich. For $12.95, not worth the price.  Our sides were generous and 3 of 4 good (onion rings, fried okra. Pinto beans). Would not recommend Mac and cheese - no flavor. Would have mentioned to manager but we all know what happens when you do that and they offer to fix it back in the kitchen. Plus that leads into service.  Tonight really poor.  Had three different servers.  We waited longer than normal to get our drink and food.  One item to call out was the HH specials. The blue Eddie vodka special was quoted at two different prices (first $5, then $6). The server did not know the special or wha t could be mixed with the vodka.  Three trips back to the bar put our drink arriving near the end of the meal and costing $1 more. Reason was this was a new drink and they did not know how to ring on the register.  Wow. Just wow. So very disappointed for this once great piece of Austin history to come to this level.  Only reason I have two stars vs one was what we did get on meats did taste good. Just not enough of it.

The service was fair and you do get the feeling that your on an assembly line. Our waiter actually tossed and dropped service times in front of us as he sped by. Asking for anything was difficult with the noise of the show and the speed of the passing server. He wasn't particularly observant or concerned with detail. At one point he topped off my wife's red wine with Diet Pepsi.The food is terrible. I mean it's really really bad. A bit of meat said to be pot roast covered with a few tablespoons of canned gravy with a side of instant mashed potatoes and canned green beans. They added a gummy chicken leg for good measure.

The fact is that, on my recent trip to Portland, I only stopped in on this place for a drink on my way elsewhere. Really, I was only there for about fifteen minutes. However, if you want to take the fact that I still felt compelled to review Jake's as a good sign, then you have my complete support.What a great vibe.The place is decorated beautifully. Bar beautiful. Which is the most special kind of beautiful. All around you are pictures and pictures of famous local and national personae who've stopped in for dinner and a drink, and curiously located among them are pictures of servicemen and women, which is a very nice, very honorable touch.The bar is absolutely LOADED, and when I got there (it was still quite early), I was able to witness the bartender prepping all sorts of garnishes for the day of drink orders he'd soon have to prepare. What does this tell me? That the gentlemen knew his stuff, that he was prepping things I'd never even seen before because his crowd knows what it wants and he has to know how to prep it all.There was also something really special about what everyone was wearing. Despite the casual, almost divey feel the place affected, the staff was dressed in nicely-pressed long-sleeved white shirts. I almost felt like the bartender's name should've been \\"Jeeves.\\" I don't know. I totally dug this. I felt the age, the tradition, which seeped through wonderfully.This was a great sign. I really wish I could've visited again. Next time, Jake's... Next time.Screw it, I changed my mind as I was reading my post back to myself. Four stars!

Delicious.  I had the Jess special (variation of their Migas taco); it was good but I wouldn't say the migas itself is mind-blowing or anything.  Also I recommend adding bacon!  The pork belly taco was pretty darn amazing, and even though we ordered before it was offered (starting at 11am), they put it in our order and just brought it out at 11am sharp!I really enjoyed their white corn tortillas--very soft and great corn flavor.

Around 6 on a Thursday night, the place was poppin. They only allow reservations for parties of six or more, so if you want to avoid the wait be sure to get there early. At first the super chill and helpful host told us it would be 35-45 minute wait for a party of 3. It ended up being more like an hour and fifteen minute wait. And since we were in three, a few parties of two were seated us before too. Noted in case I make a second trip. This would be a five-star review, but the wait was a little bit off-putting. But the food was pretty amazing to mostly make up for it. While it might seem like a typical place for a younger crowd, there were a solid amount of older couples there too. With dim lighting and a rather loud atmosphere, this could be a fun place to catch up with a group of friends or even a more casual date. The food was a whole new take on \\"southern\\". None of it felt too heavy or greasy, and I still felt relatively health at the end of my meal. I ordered the roasted beet salad as an appetizer, (their side salads are on a seasonal basis and on a separate menu), and with citrus, arugula, avocados, goat cheese, pistachios and honey tarragon vinaigrette, it was the hardiest appetizer salad I've had in awhile. The side salad I recently had at Cheesecake Factory would look like nothing next to it. But that's a different review. Our table also ordered hush puppies, fried chicken and the pecan crusted trout for myself. The hush puppies were perfect, and the fried chicken was perfectly juicy even though it was fried. My pecan trout was seriously like no other fish I had ever had before. The breading was just enough for the flavor, but not so much it felt weighed down. With a kind of mustard sauce over spinach and fingerling potatoes on the side, it was just the best after a day on the road. Despite how packed the restaurant was, our waitress seemed like she had a radar for unfilled waters. As dehydrated as I was, she legitimately appeared whenever I needed to be topped off. Her service was genuine and enough to make me a really happy camper. Ambiance: 3...Casually intimate, but the wait was a bummer. \\nService: 5...Never going thirsty.  \\nTaste: 5...Redefining southern.\\nValue/Price: 4...Pretty much standard restaurant prices but probably enough for two meals.

We had the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, and after explaining our frustration to the manager (I believe) who seated us, we were surprised to receive a free appetizer of the BBQ. That really put our mind at ease and was very thoughtful of them! I had a fried chicken breast and a side of mac and cheese. It was all amazing! My wife had the she-crab soup, which she said it was awesome as well. We were way too stuffed for dessert! Our friends were amazed, as well. Their buttermilk fried chicken was fantastic and the two sides easily interchangeable per the waitress.

The workers there can be hit or miss, some being annoyed when you ask to try a flavor, although that is to be expected when the location is right outside a college campus. I've also heard friends complain about the cookies not being warmed up for them, so make sure that the employees warm them up! And don't be afraid to ask if you notice that they forgot to.I highly recommend this little ice cream place, and you won't regret going if you are looking for a fun treat or a \\"pick me up\\" after a long day.

This place is perfectly centered among the busy life of city walk, and year is an oasis of its own.  Eat outside!  The multi-floor establishment offer excellent views and people watching but the second floor outdoor area is great as they don't overcrowd you and there always seems to be a nice breeze.  Service is super friendly and efficient.  My favorite server is Darren from Guam, if you are a service member or veteran, he is definitely your guy as he has truly touching respect for those who serve or have served.  The food is what you come to a restaurant for, and this place delivers!  The burgers are amazing and the sushi is unique enough for a regular sushi eater to be intrigued!

We can easily get better Tex-Mex, and even more delicious authentic Mexican food. Plus, we wouldn't have to wait until everyone in our party arrives to get seated. It's pretty much like our booty call when it comes to restaurants. We never plan to go here, but when plans backfire and we get lazy, we know that we can always resort to our trusty Border Cafe. And also, endless chips and salsa. The guacamole is inconsistent; sometimes, I've had really delicious avocado-y guac and other times, the guac was just not edible. I really like the fajitas, especially the chicken and catfish fajitas. They come out sizzling and the whole experience is just so exciting! For vegetarians, my friends really like the empanadas. The fish tacos with mango salsa are also very good. I tried the crawfish and shrimp quesadilla and was just really disappointed...and bloated afterwards. There was too much heavy sauce and cheese; the crawfish wasn't fresh; overall, I kinda wanted to throw up after eating 1/4 of my quesadilla. Like all booty calls, there are reasons why Border Cafe isn't my first-choice option. The food isn't outstanding, just like booty-calls aren't mindblowing, and there is an inconvenient wait. It isn't even consistent all the time, unlike booty calls. Come to Border Cafe for the experience and to be able to say, \\"Yeah, I've been to the Border Cafe!\\".

The soft boiled egg was a little sweet, and the crispy brussel sprouts were a nice touch. My only criticism were that there was not enough of the crispy pork belly.

A full-on fast food place is probably more sanitary than this! All bread products I consumed were stale. My salad came in a huge bowl with only one tiny tomato slice and half an olive. My waiter was pretty nice and did bring a few extra tomatoes when I asked for them. The stuffed mushrooms came suspended in some kind of oil-like fluid and most of the stuffing was smashed out in the oil rather than on top of the mushrooms.

I haven't had a burger from here without it since. The sauce is a creamy mayo based sauce with hints of garlic and peppers, very appealing (I actually asked what was in it).Their patties are thin and just right. They are juicy, fresh, and all assembled their burgers don't require you to open your mouth as wide as possible just to get a single bite.Flat Patties upgraded their menu a while ago, allowing you to have a \\"double patty\\" burger if you wish to have something meatier.If you're in Harvard and up for a good, cheap meal, go to Flat Patties.

I had asked my waitress for water without ice, and as she said sure, she continued to pour water into my glass from the ice filled pitcher, getting several ice chips into my glass.

The menu is extensive and runs the gamut from traditional-leaning dishes to the burritos, enchiladas and nachos that most Americans associate with the cuisine. Portions are generous, the food is well prepared and ingredients are fresh. The margaritas are among the better ones to be found around town. (Jalapenos uses real fruit juice and, for the most part, 100% agave tequilas.) The prices for margaritas are terrific. I don't know where one reviewer came up with $10+ as the cost for a margarita. A margarita using Hornitos reposado tequila costs only $6.95. This is not groovy regional Mexican fare and the tacos aren't what you'll find in some of the authentic tacqueria-type places that are springing up in foodieland (and I'm a big fan of both of these iterations of Mexican), but it's a solid Mexican menu with many options at reasonable price points.

To start, I loved the pizza I became accustomed to in my 4+ years living in Italy so much that I used to say \\"if I ever win Powerball I would charter a plane and fly all of my friends & family to my favorite pizzeria in Veneto, Italy\\".  That was before I discovered Marco's Restaurant.  Now, I don't have to fly for 8 hours to find the real Italian pizza I've craved for more than 10 years.  I like all of the pizza on the menu but my favs are the 4 Formaggi, Salamino Picante & ricotta spinach (not on menu).Marco offers a wide selection of authentic Italian favorites that aren't found in most Italian restaurants.  If you're looking for a pound of over-cooked pasta that's loaded with cheap sauce then go to olive garden.  If you want the finest quality cuisine then Marco's is your place.  I would compare Marco's with any place in the North End.  I've tried everything on the menu and I still have difficulty deciding what I want (I love them all)!  My wife on the other hand is stuck on the gnocchi in pesto sauce.  She orders it every time we go.\\nMarco's specials are must try!  If he has a fish special when you're there I suggest you put the menu down and order it.  The last one I had was a Mediterranean sea bass steamed in parchment paper!  .  I also had a zucchini & shrimp pasta special that I've dreamed about.  He made it with paccheri pasta that was out of this world!!!\\nIf you want to find the BEST Italian food north of Boston's North End go to Marco's on Rt. North in Peabody  The entrance can be a little tricky and it's easy to miss.  You should use the Springhill Suites entrance.  I you pass it don't worry.  Stay to the right.  You can pull into any of the hotel parking lots or take the next right (Dearborn Road) which is right before the jug handle.  There is an access road behind the hotels & restaurants.

Brisket under normal circumstances is so tough and chewy, but the brisket here literally will melt in your mouth. Fork tender and glistening, every tasty bite will mount on you in both pleasure and richness. In fact, I'd argue it's a little too crazy to eat a lot of it, but that's me.We also had the turkey, sausage, and ribs. While these were very tasty, they didn't stand out like the brisket. The ribs were literally fall apart as well, but in some ways that made it a little less tasty. It kind of falls apart as you eat it, and the meaty parts are fewer than the melty parts, which kind of leaves it as a mush. The sausage was tasty, but the casing was super tough, which can be a good thing at times but proved too chewy for my preference. The turkey is nice and peppery, but doesn't distinguish itself enough. It's still kind of a tough and dry piece of turkey. I might say these are still the best examples of barbecue I've had but I'd rather have them different ways.The bread is a very necessary accompaniment to the heavy and greasy meats. I actually wanted more of it to help balance out our 5.5 pound order of meat. The onions and pickles included are also very necessary. I enjoyed the potato salad as well, though I can't really say it was anything particularly unique. Just well made.Overall, I will say this about Franklins - I wouldn't wait 4 hours or so for it, but I'd definitely order ahead if I knew I was heading over to Austin about a month in advance and with a group large enough to justify the minimum order of 5 pounds.

I bought my family here for a late Mother's day dinner. My mom is super picky and hardly ever say a restaurant is good and very hard to please. However, she really enjoyed this place and said she would like to come back again! She said the sashimi was fresh and there was a great variety of different types of rolls to choose from. The quality of the food is great, flavourful  and tastes great. The environment was very comfortable and spacious. Music was not too loud that we couldn't have a conversation  (I am looking at you sushi nanaimo). Overall, I will come back here again.

We know the wait is usually long so we get a beer (it's very hard to get a beer while you wait) and huddle in.  We have no problem waiting and we just expect it.  It's a busy and small place so prepared to have people all over you and staff trying to get through everything.  Food is cheap and worth it though!  \\nThe staff is not the happiest.  They are very aggressive when you ask questions and they do NOT baby customers at all.  I don't know if customers just suck here or if tips aren't normally big but do not expect good service and do expect a long wait.  We go in with low expectations and it's a nice surprise when we get a friendly server.  They also do take out which is a great way to avoid the wait or average experience.  \\nAll in all this is great food and fun place (lots of people to watch/meet).

I am not sure what definition of fresh they are using.     The kitchen is a badly timed joke. Everything my party and I ordered looked like a copy and paste job. As if they don't understand what they are doing but just repeating what they were shown. You can taste the lack of feeling and creativity. The meat used for the burger part is something that Steak n Shake wouldn't touch.     The only ONLY reason I didn't give this place a full one star was a server named Tabitha. She was an amazing surprise. With her awesomely fast whit and her understanding of my underwhelming experience. When I tried to speak to a manager her name was Amanda.

When you've experienced the likes of Cacao and Sahagun, though, it kind of feels ordinary. They're only mildly excited about their chocolate.

They just don't seem to have their heart in it.And that's a shame, because there have some great selections -- a truffle with bleu cheese, for example, which sounds as awful as a bacon truffle, but my dad highly recommends it.

One of the employees told someone in my group to be prepared because they were understaffed. We felt that was kind of a strange comment considering so few people were there. The service was actually fine too. I didn't feel there were any delays and they did a great job keeping everyone's tab separate and remembering who ordered what. I always appreciate when a restaurant will take the effort to ring up tabs separately so the group doesn't have to mess with it. I ordered off the happy hour menu and it was a great deal. For $36 I got an appetizer, a beer, a specialty roll, and two orders of sashimi. The cream cheese pineapple rangoons were good but the dish only comes with 4 so you might need a few orders for the table. My Las Vegas roll was delicious and pretty but I'm convinced each piece had to be 200-300 calories. It had all the dangerous sushi elements...cream cheese, rice, spicy mayo, and it was fried with a fried decoration on top! That being said, it was very tasty and filling.

We entered, starving and were promptly greated and told that we would have to wait 10 minutes. It was already around 1pm and I couldn't tell how busy they were aside from the fact that we were not the only ones waiting. We sat and waited... And waited... finally about 20 minutes later we were escorted to a table. And the first thing I noticed is that they were plenty, and I mean PLENTY of empty tables around us. What the fuck is that all about?! Making us wait 20 minutes during the busy, peak time during a week-end in a busy strip mall. You must be kidding. I asked our waiter what that was about and she didn't even bother to answer; she half ignored me. What a bitch. She didn't even know her menu  and couldn't answer questions or list the special.We placed our orders for two diet cokes, and while I was having spaghetti with meat sauce for my lunch, my girlfriend went for some salad they had with soup and breadsticks. Those breadsticks tasted disgusting... way too salty. I had 1/10th of one while my girlfriend had 4. God bless her soul; she's weird like that.Anyways, the waitress ignored us for a while and finally brought our entrees with an interval of 10 minutes in between my food and here's. Again... What the hell is that all about? We're supposed to get it at the same time? Can't you run a restaurant? I also asked for some cheese for my pasta (I love cheese... especially on pasta) and it took her a good 10 minutes to come back to the table with the grater. By the time she came back, I had already almost finished because I was sick of waiting for her. It's not like I didn't remind her either, she kept walking by and ignoring me. I even had her co-workers try to get her attention. She failed to serve well and I left very disappointed.Even though I had been to Olive Garden in the past, once and had a great experience this one just plain out sucks. The atmosphere and dcor our nice, but they can't seem to manage it properly and wouldn't be surprised to see loads of unsatisfied customers walk out of there and never return. I'm one of them. The smooth, intricately managed service you would expect from chain restaurants wasn't there. I didn't even bother to complain, I was too annoyed to even begin.

All of which were perfectly delicious.Sitting at the sushi bar provides an opportunity to meet interesting fellow patrons and (if you are so inclined) sample from each other's plates .. not required of course but, it is a traditional way of socializing that lends itself to a feeling of community.I finished off my meal with a quail egg and flying fish roe \\"dessert\\" ... which mingles on your palette for awhile afterwards in a very pleasant way, especially when paired with hot green tea. Mmmmm!The chefs will make to perfection any of your favorites and gladly create something new for you as well, taking care to include your personal tastes.Highly recommended and never disappointing!

That said, it wasn't half bad.The service was friendly and spot on.  Employees seem to enjoy their work, and you get a real \\"corporate culture\\" vibe.The ingredients were good, sauces good, menu somewhat inventive for a pizza chain, and the local beer and wine on tap is a good bonus.  The sizes are awesome, too.  Mini is perfect - everyone in the minivan brigade can order their own.  If you eat a lot, go Mod size.The crust was less like pizza crust and more like flatbread, which I guess is what has to happen to turn pizza into fast food, but it did seriously detract from the finished product for me.Also, the location is kinda sucky for traffic.  Going here is a commitment.But the prices!  Feed a family of four for $25, and you get happy kids and don't have to wash dishes.

The salmon was over cooked and not at all seasoned. I couldn't swallow it without sips of water. The crab and shrimp meat stuffing was also unseasoned and full of crab shells. I couldn't eat a bite without needing to strategically take a chunk out (due to shell) and place it on my plate. The only reason I ate it was because it was my birthday and my dad was \\"treating\\" me to a dinner!!! My mom had a razor clam (yes, a single (one)) razor clam! It was over cooked (so extra chewy) and was supposed to be lightly panko breaded which turned out to be heavily breaded and then cooked at too low of a temperature to make crispy. Instead it was wet and doughy. Once a person knows the proper way to prepare seafood it's actually quite quick and easy, so the poor preparation and taste of what was served was horrendous! I think Jake's is just clinging to a reputation that it created from the past, because what I experienced wasn't even as good as a mediocre seafood restaurant, but much more expensive!!!!!

My sandwich wasn't terribly generous on the ham, but it was tasty nonetheless, and my friend was happywitty her grilled cheese as well. The place was nice for a conversation until a party with 5 young children arrived and was seated near us (I love kids, but it's difficult to be heard over the din of 5 of them at once - not the restaurant's fault by any means - just a report on the clientele this afternoon).

I'd say brunch is 3 stars, dinner is 4 stars. Brunch is definitely good here - and they're known for their GIGANTIC Bloody Marys - but I'm a bit of a brunch snob and it's not necessarily my favorite. I do think it's great for a big group, because there's always seating on Sunday, and the prices are really reasonable for the amount of food served. Also, the servers here are always friendly.Now for the good part - I had dinner here a million years ago and didn't love it (can't totally remember why) but more recently am singing a different tune. Food is really good, the atmosphere is fun and there's always people at the bar. I prefer to sit at the bar, actually, because you get face time with the bartenders, and because it's a livelier vibe. If you have a choice, sit downstairs, because upstairs is too quiet. I've had the spinach and artichoke burrito here (SO good, very filling though) and most recently, the salmon fettuccine, which I loved. I also love that my pasta cost under $15 and I could have a giant Cosmo with it, for only $25 total. To me, that's a perfect cheap date. Christopher's is also known for their nachos... for good reason. In short, I definitely do recommend going here for brunch or dinner, especially if you're looking for a straightforward, casual atmosphere with a solid menu and kind-to-the-wallet prices."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Where else can you get some of the tastiest ribs accompanied with live blues? So you're mood for some authentic Southern BBQ, there's no place like Fat Matt's Rib Shack in Atlanta. \\nThe chefs must get up around 3 AM in order to slow smoke the ribs so they are as tender as a sappy love letter on Valentine's Day.\\nService is fast and friendly, with a small selection of brew on tap. Ribs come in 1/4 rack, 1/2 rack and full rack, and all sides are a la carte. If you're not into pig, then there's the smoked BBQ chicken, which is not bad, but why bother? You know you're here for some ribs, right?\\nMeet a friend there and while you're waiting have a beer and a tray of their salted, roasted, in-the-shell peanuts; they're still hot when served to you.\\nThen enjoy your meal while being entertained by local blues bands. Seating is limited, and so is parking; heck, it's only about as large as my double-wide. It's a popular joint so expect to wait in line round about supper time.\\nIf your hunger pains can't wait, then there's always Fat Matt's Fish & Chicken Shack right next door, but I've never been there, and neither have most Atlantans, so I can't recommend it.\\nStick to the original."},{"name":"The Hideaway Bar","address":"516 Virginia Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I LOVE this place!

We still enjoyed Fox Brothers tho. \\nThe \\"orange drink\\" I ordered was very good. Nice and light. Paired well with the ribs. \\nThe collard greens were good. Not great but good. They were a tad bit spicy, which I liked, seasoned with ham hocks. There was just a little too much vinegar in them (I could taste it).\\nThe bad: Parking is real tight and kinda sucks they don't have a bigger lot. You may have to drive around for a bit especially when they are busy. \\nThe hostess was very warm and hospitable, very welcoming but our waitress was not. You can always tell when the waitress or waiter has had a long day. She didn't check on us enough. We arrived at 10pm. Got seated immediately and they close at 11. After our food came, she barely checked on us. We had to get our own to- go boxes. \\nThe potato salad was not very good. I told her I wasn't a fan thinking maybe she would offer me another side, perhaps beans or something but nope. She took the potato salad off the table and disappeared again for awhile. \\nThe sweet tea was blah..not sweet at all. \\nHubby got his beer on draft and he said it was not cold enough. I'm not a beer drinker like that but I know when you get one it is supposed to be ice cold! I tasted it and he was right. Not cold enough. \\nThe fries were overcooked. Kids didn't eat them. Chicken tenders were a little too crispy as well. \\nSo basically if you go, just get the ribs (half rack or whole) and the orange drink and call it a day!!!

Our waiter was very attentive and friendly.  He asked if we were 1st timers and gave suggestions of his personal favorites as well as the most popular items with clues as to the portion sizes. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The sweet potato waffles were crispy outside and moist and tender inside. The chicken was soooooo good. It was not at all greasy. The coating was crunchy with a little lingering heat from cayenne and black pepper. Spouse had the praline bacon waffles. Lots of bacon in the batter with an extra rather on top just to gild the lily.  I had heard great thing about the mac and cheese, but we we a little early for the lunch menu so our waiter put in an order at 1030 just as lunch started. It was really creamy and the macaroni was still a little al dente which was perfect. The cheese blend for the sauce included a bleu which was a little overpowering even with a generous sprinkle of cheddar over the top.

While there was a revival of familiar flavors and dishes, I wouldn't go as far to call it a true Southern revival of the type that would result in a religious conversion.  Situated in the charming Decatur suburb, the entrance has a nice open yard and front porch entering into what would seem to be a modest country mansion.  Billed as modern Southern cuisine, which decades ago would seem to be an oxymoron, Revival accomplishes what I had hoped to experience at Sean Brock's Husk in Nashville earlier this year but fell short, which is a personalized reinterpretation of Southern classics presented with modern technique and well sourced ingredients.  Given the strong tradition of Southern foodfare being derived out of  elevating humble ingredients and making something delicious to share family style due to limited means, this is a task not easily executed successfully.For lunch, the meals are presented in a meat+2 veggies style where one has the choice of customizing their plate.  For the main entrees, we sampled the fried catfish, the bacon wrapped meatloaf, and the country fried steak, and our choice of veggies included the Revival mac/cheese, whipped potatoes, collard greens, green cabbage with confit ham, and green beans.  All were accompanied by their iron skillet cornbread.  Beginning with the cornbread, it is surprisingly light and airy to the point where one feels like they are eating a biscuit with the essence of corn, which can be quite pleasant if one prefers the mouthfeel of a croissant rather than a dense scone.  I found it more disconcerting since I was expecting to have that crumbly granular texture from a predominantly cornmeal base perhaps enhanced with bits of real corn, but I won't hold that against them since I am just a fanatic for old fashioned cornbread, but I definitely appreciated their rendition.Of the three main entrees, the meatloaf and catfish stood out comparatively to the country fried steak (certain areas were difficult to cut due to tendon/connective tissue), although the peppery pan gravy that accompanies the  steak would be unapologetically slathered by myself onto anything edible in its vicinity.  The meatloaf consisted of a nice balance of grassfed beef and pork, but the ribbon of crisp bacon lining the exterior combined with the intensified ketchup creates that rare morsel that one can't help repeatedly going back to again and again due to its lingering umami finish.  Much like the cornbread, the fried catfish has a feathery dusting of cornmeal so that each bite doesn't feel as heavy or tiring due to its lack of greasiness and allowing the natural fish flavor to come through even with a dollop of tartar sauce.  In terms of the sides, the mac/cheese and whipped potatoes were the standouts since the mac/cheese utilizes small bite-sized pasta to allow maximum cheesiness to adhere to its surface and it possesses an intense sharpness that beckons to be accompanied by a bite of one's entree whereas the whipped potatoes has a generous hint of butter/cream without being overpowering.  The collard greens were a bit over salted whereas the green beans and cabbage were slightly under salted so they provide some balance when eaten in combination with the other strong flavors.  Indulging in dessert, we opted for the peanut butter oreo pie and the lemon icebox pie.  The peanut butter oreo pie was what I expected resembling the intensity of much duplicated flavors found in a solid candy bar/ice cream, but the lemon icebox pie was probably the standout item amongst all the above, and not being a dessert guy, that almost never happens.  Beautifully conceived in a circular tart, the whipped cream has an ethereal silky smooth texture that is immaculately countervailed by the refreshing acidity from the lemon custard enraptured by a textbook buttery graham cracker crust.  Hmmm....all this religious imagery perhaps has resulted in a religious experience after all.6 stars: lemon icebox pie\\n5 stars: meatloaf, catfish, mac/cheese, whipped potatoes, *pan gravy\\n4 stars: cornbread, green beans, collard greens\\n3 stars: country fried steak sans gravy*Overall highly satisfying, but my inner bar is set pretty high to justify the price point for similar if not better experiences elsewhere in the region on the basis of taste alone,  But for the elevated modern Southern fine-dining experience, they hit it square on the mark."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place has a great vibe.

Over the years, I've ordered the same thing - falafel and hummus in a pita with tahini sauce and some veggies.  The falafel is usually very fresh - they fry up fairly small batches and do a good business, so it doesn't sit long.  I like the texture and taste of their falafel, which is usually fresh and warm, though it doesn't have much spice to it (maybe that's typical of Israeli versus Arab falafel).  They have hot sauce on the side if you want to make it spicier.The reason I don't eat here much any more is that the portions are small for what they charge.  Maybe I've just gotten older and fatter, but I remember the sandwiches being much bigger 10 years ago.  When I do eat dinner at Rami's now, I end up ordering two falafel and hummus pitas, which is over $17 without a drink, and that seems insane, considering how cheap chick peas, pita bread and lettuce/tomato are.  For the same price, I could go across the street and have a 10 ounce burger, a large order of fries and a 16 oz. draft Sam Adams at the Coolidge Corner Clubhouse.I stop by Rami's when I want a light lunch or a tasty snack, but for a filling meal I go somewhere else - though I do like their food."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I like coming to Tasty Burger for a quick bite to eat.

You will have a 2-ish hour wait.  Look, at any of the best places, you're looking at a minimum of an hour's drive, plus 30-60 minutes' wait time once you get there, then the drive back.  As far as I can tell, Franklin's saves me gas money.So you've waited, played some Angry Birds in line, now you're at the counter.  What to order?  EVERYTHING.  Seriously, you just waited in line 2 hours, why not bring home leftovers??  Ok but really, we got the pulled pork, brisket (lean & fatty), turkey, pork ribs and sausage.  Brisket is KILLER, ribs are some of the best I've ever had.  I wasn't a fan of the sausage until I tried it the next day with some aged cheddar and crackers as a cocktail hour plate with the in-laws, and then it really won me over.  And they serve Live Oak on draught!  What's not to love??Go. Go right now (unless you've already eaten today, and then go tomorrow)."},{"name":"J Christophers","address":"250 E Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"Bland!

Orlando's.Magical Dining (equivalent to Miami Spice) 3. All the amazing helpful reviews everyone posted.We were surprised to find this restaurant located in a strip mall, which wasn't a bad thing it actually made the experience more intimate. The Hostess was very hospitable and we didn't feel unwelcome seeing as we arrived 30min before close with a party of 6 that grew to 8 which they also so happily accommodated. I will hit all the points but all the reviews below were so spot on it was like following a script from a movie.Service:  5/5 Unbelievable, from the moment you walk in, to the satisfied feeling when you walk out. The server explained the restaurants mantra of farm to table dining, Some of us had ordered steaks and the server waited for us to check if our meat was cooked to our liking, which was an attentive touch.Food: 5/5 the magical dining experience was amazing, you are leaving with leftover unless you're MIchael Phelps and can down a 22oz steak plus all the fixing with no problem. everyone tried from one an others plate and everything was great but if you're only two people and you don't want to miss out on the best because you can't try everything here you go.Veal stuffed pepper - best appetizer \\nVeal cutlet with lump crab (Veal chop was sold out so this was the substitute)- Best Dish\\nMouse Cake - Best dessert Now, you might think that i am biased to veal but this decision was made by 8 judges 4 which ordered steak, 3 who order crab cakes, and 1 lucky person ordered the Veal. Also, this was a special item as the original veal chop was SOLD OUT so the veal cutlets were a substitute, I can't even imaging how good that chop must have been.Price: 5/5 The Magical Dining helped in this area as all three for $33 is a steal when you compare quality and quantity vs price. I did see the regular menu and the price are reasonable considering you eating fresh made, organic, farm to table dining at a, in my opinion, 5 star establishment. Verdict: They gained several new repeating customers even if it is not magical dining.

By the time we got our food, many items were incorrect and some never came. Its not even worth the $12 AYCE because you won't get to eat much unless youre prepared to spend the whole day there.

I had  Camar√≥nes Alambres.  If you think that their food is mediocre...eat this.  The grit cake, plantains and tamarind/habanero is the stuff made of dreams....Caution: $17 is too much for it and I had a Groupon on my side!  I am seriously tempted to ask for it without the shrimp and see if I can talk them down to something more reasonable, like $12 but I'm not sure that I want to be that customer....I will wait and see how bad the cravings get. ;) But the fish tacos looked really good also (on another table) and at $10 for tacos and $5 a beer, that isn't outrageous. If you are disappointed with the cheese dip, add some of that roasted salsa to it and stir it in.  It's delicious. Mixed drinks are expensive so order a beer!  They have a fantastic assortment of Mexican beers, Negro Modelo is my all time fav. on tap and in bottle. In other words, go here and know how much you are going to spend.

Nothing, and I mean nothing so far compares to the food I ate at Franklin BBQ.  Truly a revelation to my taste buds.  Everyone has their own personal taste, but anybody not giving this place at least 4 stars needs to go back and try it again.  Every cow has a different brisket and every pig has a different set of ribs and shoulders, so I'll chalk up any low ratings to this phenomenon and also to the long wait, which can get some people irritated.But for me, I've never tasted better brisket.  Well smoked, tender, juicy, and flavorful.  THIS is what BBQ brisket should be every time.  As for ribs, I've never had a more well cooked and tasty rib in my life.  The pulled pork was done better than anyone outside of North Carolina (sorry Memphis folks, you got nothing on this place).  I'll only give 4 stars to the sausage, because I have definitely had better, but it still had a nice snap, and a good texture and flavor.  The sauces are fantastic too, and even those who don't care for sauce (like my father) will give high praise to the espresso sauce.  In fact, my anti-sauce father liked it so much he asked if he could buy some sauce.  They said no, but gave him a big container to take home with him for free.  The beans were great, slaw was great, potato salad was good.I'll also tell you this: Aaron Franklin has a generous hand when selling his meat.  I ordered 1lb of brisket, and he asked me if what he cut looked good.  I told him maybe a little more, and he cut off another 1/4lb, but I only paid for the single lb.  Perhaps his heavy hand goes along with them selling out so early, but to me, that's a sure sign of an owner who cooks for his clients, not his bottom line.  Plus, he greeted every person in line (that I saw) with a smile, conversation, and a thank you for coming to eat at his place.  With food this good, he could be a complete a-hole, but his choice is to be a really great person, and I appreciate that.All in all, I didn't mind getting there at 9:50am on a Friday, and sitting down to eat at 11:45am.  I didn't mind the summer heat.  I didn't mind driving from Dallas the night before to San Antonio, then up to Austin the next morning just to try this place.  I didn't even mind the hipster snobs at the front of the line who were irritatingly rude to me when I asked a simple question.Because no matter what irritations came about, the food made up for it.  I paid around $28 for 1lb of brisket (plus some), a couple of ribs, 1/4lb pork, 1/4lb sausage, sides of beans and potato salad, 1 beer and 1 sweet tea, which is a good value to me, for the 2 adults and one child who ate this meal.  It's worth repeated visits, but due to my location and work schedule, who knows when I'll get the next chance.  For now I'll continue to eat BBQ in a mediocre DFW market, with only a few true standouts (luckily Meshack's is close by).  But in my head, I'll keep dreaming of Franklin BBQ.  And just looking at the picture of brisket on their website is making me sad...and hungry.  Believe the hype, and don't get all mad that this place gets better reviews than your favorite place.  Don't be bitter, just eat Franklin BBQ!"},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Boston Shawarma is your  basic hole in the wall.

The dim sum servers will at least try to say things in English, especially if they can tell you're not from their parts (being Asian does not = I speak mandarin), which is huge if they're not screaming it into my ear.

Has a nice atmosphere & adequate for families. Food was okay. Was not a huge fan of the sushi...have eaten tastier sushi from The Fresh Market for half the price. Those who got burgers did enjoy them. In terms of appetizers, the edamame was a bit too watery & lacked enough of the salt seasoning but the calamari & tuna nachos were quite good. I give a 3/5 stars rating mostly based on the service. Perhaps it was b/c an 18% gratuity would be automatically added to our bill (party of +6) as our waitress was mediocre at best and seemed to not put any effort into making sure we had a pleasant experience. She was not personable at all. She did not offer to refill anyone's drinks and was sloppy about taking away the plates, etc. even though we tried our best to stack/condense the plates & utensils. After waiting a while, we had to get the hostess to track down our waitress in order to get the check.

The dishes at Alden & Harlow are fun and whimsical. Strong flavors are frequently juxtaposed, leading to results I would certainly call interesting. I got to try quite a large fraction of the menu because I was with a large group. Overall, I had a good time. A few dishes made me say 'wow', but I did find the food a bit salt and oil heavy. Some of the ingredient pairings were successful, while at other times there were too many flavors mixed together and no star of the dish shone through. It was also no an inexpensive meal. I had eaten an early dinner already and somehow I left more hungry than when I came in. To get full you probably need to order about 2.5 to 3 dishes per person, depending on what you get. At ~$15 each, it can quickly add up. Service was attentive and friendly. Onto the specifics. The two cocktails I tried where good. The Paper Mache was very tasty and drinkable, though I would have liked a bit more of a kick from the Bourbon. The Roman Root was made a tad interesting with the radish leaf while remaining refreshing. As seems to be the popular consensus, the best dish that I tried were the corn pancakes. Nicely crisped on the outside, sweet and fluffy with very good corn on the inside. Enough maple for extra sweetness, plus a good and different complement from the roasted shishito peppers. The dish was successful because it had clean flavors, it was well executed, and it was both familiar and novel. It was also a good portion for sharing with a group. I would also put the pork belly near the top. Clean flavors, tasty grits. The one issue with the dish is that it was definitely on the small side. If you share with more than two people each person will only get a small bite. I also enjoyed the striped bass crudo, but it wasn't really a unanimous hit on the table. It was a tad salty, but I enjoyed the flavors. None of the other dishes really stood out to me. The fried bok choi was interesting, but it get dragged down by too many dishes also being salty and fried. The soft-shell crab was just OK. Also fried and salty, and the garnishes didn't really add to the dish for me. The chicken fried rabbit was also just OK. The flavors didn't stand out and the chicken fry didn't seem like a traditional chicken fry to me. It ended up being more of a rabbit croquette. The beet salad was not bad, but the flavors at times clashed for me and it had yet another fried and salty element on the dish. The squash blossoms were perhaps the most disappointing dish of the dinner. A very nicely fried batter, but again, fried and salty and I expected these to be stuffed. There was no filling so it was just a nice fritter. The Nduja snack had mint, cucumbers, and peanuts. Just way too many strong and clashing flavors. It was a fun meal with some standout dishes, I just wasn't blown away."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"So this past Sunday I finally crossed visiting Franklin's off my Austin bucket list.  I am a Texas native and have lived in Austin 14 years and have eaten plenty of BBQ in my life!  Going in my friend and I knew it would be an experience so we weren't rushed.  We did not arrive as early as we planned and got in line just before 10 am.  A few mins later the friendly girl working the line came down and determined that we were the (lucky/unlucky) Last Man/Woman Standing.  This meant that anybody behind us would not be guaranteed food.  Estimate to reach the BBQ was 3 pm..So this is when the second best part of the visit takes place.  You pull out your chair (or rent one for $5) and get comfy and open one of the beers in your cooler.  Oh ya don't forget to bring your own beverages!  We spent the rest of the wait chatting with our neighbors in line and fighting off the people trying to get in line behind us.  Staff members came out regularly to check on the line and to help us defend the end of the line.  If guess 50+ people showed up and left after we had been made last of the line.  The staff kept telling us they would make it worth our while!So finally about 2:45 we make it in and all that's left us brisket and sausage.  We load up on both and some sides and the staff seriously made it worth our while!  I don't want to say how but being Last in line was worth it :)So the food.. Ya all the reviews are correct the brisket is Amazing!  Best I've had in Texas and worth the wait on it's own.  The sausage was great with lots of flavor.  The sides were ok nothing to write home about but we were here for meat!  So summary be prepared to wait, enjoy it and the company and get the brisket.. Lots of it!

After standing there for at least 5 minutes, one of the customers, I guess feeling sorry for us, got up from her table and told us that when they came in they were told to just take a seat anywhere.

If living within walking distance this would be a viable option.  Stroll in, sit on patio, get a decent drink and some snack.

We'd grown quite used to being able to pop over to one of the local Sushi-Go-Round establishments (Beaverton seems to have more conveyor-belt sushi bars than its fair share) for a quick bite.  Those seem to be in somewhat short supply in our neck of the Couve's woods, and we weren't keen on driving over to Fisher's Landing just for raw fish on a track.We'd seen Oishi in its little strip-mall habitat when we'd gone to sign our lives away at a nearby title company, so we decided to check it out the other day.  We were in at a slow time of day (2 p.m.) so we received attentive service and our food arrived very quickly.\\"Oishi\\" means \\"delicoius\\" in Japanese.  They are not kidding.  Oh.  My God.  I think you forget what you're missing out on when you eat the majority of your sushi from little plates you pluck from a moving mechanism.  We ordered salmon, tuna, and eel sushi, and an order of the Washington roll.  The salmon and tuna were tender, fresh and flavorful, the roll was tasty and held together well, and the eel!  The eel!  It was like dessert on rice.  I might have to forcibly restrain myself from gobbling down my man's share along with my own if we order that again.  I'd never considered it much of a favorite, but the usual eel I get is rubbery and dry.Our server was friendly and helpful and answered any questions we had, and even pointed us in the direction of a nearby liquor store.  The one con is that it's kind of expensive (probably on par with other 'normal' sushi bars, but considerably more than traveling sushi) so it's not somewhere we'll end up patronizing weekly like our Beaverton haunts, but when we want a sushi treat, we'll definitely be paying Oishi a second visit.

It is not everyday that the owner is active in the restaurant and to see it happen, not once but twice is truly special.

The salmon was very light and served with honey dampened quinoa and kimchi kale. I didn't particularly like the kimchi kale, as I felt the tastes clashed and it was overpowering, but the quinoa was a well balanced sweetness to the savory.

I am relatively new to the area and I love going out and trying new things.  My boyfriend looks up reviews online often, so we like to randomly select restaurants who have created a buzz for themselves.  After looking over the menu, we agreed to put the Screen Door at the top of our list for places to try.\\nWe were warned that there was often a wait for seating and that it wasn't uncommon for there to be a line out the door.  We arrived about an hour after the restaurant opened for dinner, around 6:30 pm.  The host was very friendly when greeting us and warned us that there was going to be about an hour wait.  Considering how long it took us to get there and the fact that we had both been looking forward to eating there, we decided to wait.  While waiting, I took a quick look around.  The waiting area was tiny and a bit cramped, but there was enough seating for the most part.  I looked at the bar and noticed that the bartender was not only very friendly with the people seated in front of him, but he was also very quick with making the drinks.  Signs of a good bartender.  I decided to head to the restroom and passed the kitchen on the way.  You can actually see into the kitchen and watch as the chefs prepare your meals!  I stood and watched for a moment, observing all of the various foods being brought out the the hungry patrons.  Everything looked so neat and orderly in the kitchen, and the food being brought out looked absolutely beautiful.  It was very obvious that the cooks take their \\"food art\\" very seriously.  I continued on the the restrooms and noticed that there were several newspaper and magazine clippings on the walls.  I stopped and peeked over them for a moment, taking notice to the various rewards and high regards that the restaurant had received.  I was surprised to see that one of the article actually mentioned getting some products that they cooked with from Mount Vernon, WA, my hometown!  It was a pleasant surprise.\\nAs I made my way back to the waiting area, I noticed that even more people had piled in.  My boyfriend and I gave up our seats to a family-we didn't mind standing for a bit.  We weren't standing long as not even ten minutes later, we were being seated.  I was glad to be seated so much sooner than we had anticipated.  We were sat up at the bar, where we were met by the friendly bartender/waiter.  He handed us our menus and within minutes had our orders in.  My boyfriend is a vegetarian and is a complete sucker for good homemade mac 'n' cheese, so he ordered two of the side order of the stuff and I ordered catfish with andouille sauce and a side of fries.  We watched the cooks at work in kitchen and were surprised with how quickly our orders were brought out.  His mac 'n' cheese was heavenly, complete with baked cheese on top, and my catfish, which was brought out very hot and crispy, was divine.  We had a side of cornbread brought out, which was a little on the dry side, but aside from that, everything was perfect.  The waiter was attentive, without being pushy or bothersome, and the food was excellent.  The only qualm I had was in how small the restaurant was.  I like the fact that with smaller areas comes more attention to detail and service, but it made for a very loud, sort of crowded eating experience.  Other than that, I don't have a negative word to say about the place.  Total, we spent under $25 for the both of us to eat, and eat WELL.\\nSince then, we have been back several times, my boyfriend getting his usual mac 'n' cheese, and me, being more adventurous, trying new things each time.  On our most recent visit, a couple next to us ordered the fried chicken.  Again, my boyfriend is a vegetarian, but he leaned over to me and whispered \\"That looks so good, I might consider trying it!\\"  Now that is a big deal, considering he WILL NOT touch meat.  Never has, probably never will.  I know what I'm ordering next time! \\nKudos Screen Door, you are by far the most consistent place we've had to date!

The fries were crispy and substantial, right to my liking and I asked for honey mustard on the side though ketchup is provided on the table.

So, they don't take reservations, but they do take reservations.  According to their voice mail directions, I called at 4:00pm to attempt to arrange a reservation for six at 6:00pm on a Thursday.  Evidently, they take two reservations a day for parties of six or more.  We had a party of six, so check.  Unfortunately,  both reservations were already spoken for by the time I called, and I was told to call back at  5:30pm when the restaurant opened.   The demeanor was instructional and not entirely welcoming.When I called again at 5:30pm, I was told that we could not get on the list until all the people at the door were seated.

Unfortunately, they would not seat us until all six had arrived, even though five of us were there at 5:45pm.Wow, I for one am shocked that this restaurant is rated so highly.After waiting for about an hour...it's now almost 7:00pm, in the small and cramped waiting area, we did get a table...hallelujia.  OMG...Can't wait to eat.We were greeted by our server, and everything seemed like we're ready to roll, but then he disappeared for a long time.  I mean quite a noticeable length of time.  We began to realize, after another 20 minutes of chatting, that our waiter didn't seem to be in the restaurant.  We had not yet placed our orders, and my stomach was now growling.   My son, who had just started a sizable book  when we arrived at the restaurant (one with no pictures) is now on page 140.Finally, he arrives and takes our orders.   My son wants the burger.  He asks me, \\"medium\\" so it's still a little pink?  I say, \\"Let's do it medium-well, please.\\"  He indicates that it will take a \\"long\\" time to cook the burger if I order it medium well because they are SO thick and huge.  I defer to medium, but I'm not crazy about the idea of having my son eat undercooked hamburger meat.  For the record, the burger is not \\"huge\\" but is thick. So, we wait for another 20 or so minutes, and our waiter arrives with a side order of hush puppies that we did not order, which he says was a mistake from another table and because he realizes we've been waiting since 6:00pm.  It was  a nice gesture, but it didn't help much between six people.  Still, we wait on the food.  I think we were finally served at 7:50pm.   We didn't have dessert, and we were leaving the restaurant at 8:30pm.The food was good, my tequila blackberry cocktail was ok, and everyone seemed to enjoy it, but it was not food that I would go through this experience again for.   As we all know, food is only part of the experience of dining.   I would have rated Screen Door higher had the service been more attentive and timely.

For years I avoided ramen because I am not a big fan of pasta and had created an extreme hatred for packaged \\"ramen\\"  but at the behest of one of my Japanese friends who told me that if I didn't like it he would reimburse me for my meal.  So finally I tried the north location and immediately I became addicted. After my first visit of getting the original I was hooked on that broth and the egg and of course the noodles.  I was miserably full and slurping liquid down my chin.  Since that visit I have visited one of their 2 locations about every 2 weeks or so and while I still order the original I am learning the magic really happens when you play with all of the add-ons.  My current addiction is an original with spicy chili paste and pressed garlic.  On future visits I will try a corn bomb and brussel sprouts and then start to mix and match from there."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I woke up this morning craving a veggie burger. Not just any veggie burger, but one with cheese, caramelized onions, and sauteed mushrooms. Kind of a strange way to start the day, but that's what happened. At lunch, I decided I'd just ignore the craving since I had no veggie ingredients. Then dinner got delayed, and at 10pm, I was about to keel over, for hunger and for want of veggie burger. I searched on yelp for veggie burgers in Cambridge, and this place came up. So around 10:30, off we went to Christopher's.It amazed me that I could (almost literally) get the veggie burger of my dreams. I got the home-made veggie burger with caramelized onions, grilled mushrooms, and cheddar cheese (instead of the peppers and pesto that were supposed to come with it). The lovely waitress asked if I wanted a multi-grain or French roll. Multi-grain please. Wow. As I said--veggie burger of my dreams. And it was as delicious as I had hoped, so good that I almost gave the place 5 stars. I'll have to try more things first, though.The nachos were okay. Cheese was good, but the chips were insansely oily, and the salsa was kind of blah. The salad was way better than another yelper had described--romaine with onions, cucumbers, and olives, with a good dressing on the side. The fries were incredible, too. Also, on the back of their menu they describe their high-quality, responsible food deal. It makes me happy to know that they are conscious of this stuff. And now I can go to bed happy, because I had the veggie burger I woke up dreaming of."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Screen Door is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Whilst visiting the city for a weekend with friends we were eager to sample some of the local cuisine and saw on Yelp that Screen Door is one of the best rated brunch spots nearby. We hoped in an Uber and made our way there. It's a pretty inconspicuous place from the outside but the throngs of people suggested it was popular. We were lucky to find a table and the eager waitress served us. We ordered a good cross section of the menu from chicken and waffles to eggs to pancakes and it came in mountainous proportions and was all delicious.  There was a great buzzing atmosphere and we were so impressed we returned the next morning also.

I didn't find the cake particularly dry or particularly moist. The frosting is plentiful and tasty enough. Unfortunately, the clerk was too busy doing something on his laptop to pay much attention to me. I asked for 2 whipper snappers (a Standard and a Michael Jackson), and when he finally looked up he had to ask me to repeat the 2nd half of the order. Then he didn't put whipped cream in the cupcakes--it being my first time I thought maybe it was already in there, but when I ate them later in the day there was certainly nothing inside but cake. He got right back on his laptop while he was waiting for my credit card to process and didn't even look up while I signed the receipt and handed it back. I would deduct a star for the absolutely shameful service I received, but other reviews have so harped on the high quality of service that I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

The only downfall is they are closed on Sundays. Other than that they have great specials, a variety of wing flavors as well as a variety of cold & hot subs, oh & I forgot to mention they have pizzas as well if the other things don't tickle your fancy.

I've had their pulled chicken burrito, the nachos, the vegetarian chili, and the buffalo tofu. The nachos, the burrito, and the chili were all really good, and the buffalo tofu was a good effort. It is breaded and fried, then covered in buffalo sauce. It ended up being too much tofu, and not enough flavor. Their brunch menu is a little bit more egg and meat heavy, but there are choices for everyone on there.My one complaint is that they were playing music quite loudly during dinner while a sox game was on AND people were cheering on top of that.

I enjoyed the eggs benedict and my boyfriend's omlete was pretty good.\\n  The second time was also brunch and we were seated upstairs which has a nice inn feel to it.  Our waitress was one of the worst i've ever had.  She chose to communicate in single words, possible three if necessary.  We waited a really long time for our food.  My order came out wrong (an omelete instead of a burger), but since she basically dumped the plates with us and then left i didn't have a chance to tell her it wasn't what i ordered.  it took another 5 minutes for us to catch her attention.  She said NOTHING, took the plate away and came back about 10 minutes later with my order, once again saying NOTHING!  some may claim that because she was from Brazil she may not have had the language to say 'sorry for the mix up', or 'i'll be right back', i don't buy it.  she was fluent when she spoke more than one work and her accent was minimal.  she obviously just didn't care.  And to top it all of, it was one of the worst burgers i've ever had.\\n   I would've only given one star except that i do like the omelete and eggs benedict.  terrible service and otherwise bad food.

For dinner, we chose the family-style option where you choose you entree and desert and the chef sends out the rest of the meal family-style for the entire table.  I selected the southern fried chicken for my meal and I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  The chicken was very moist, but I thought at a famous southern food restaurant there would be something especially special about this particular southern fried chicken  There wasn't.  The family-style sides were excellent and really captured the southern flavors.  The desserts were excellent.  I had the apple crisp with ice cream which was definitely too heavy for the meal.  My friends raved about the ice box pie.  I also thought it was on the pricey side.  With our single drink each at the bar, the tab for 5 people was over $300.

We put our names on the list and we were told it was a 30 min wait. Even at 1pm on a Friday afternoon, there was a 30 min wait. It was raining and so we walked a few doors down the street to grab some coffee. We told the hostess that we would be back. I'm so impressed . . . the hostess came and found us in the coffee shop down the street and told us our table was ready. We had only waited around 20 minutes. The server was attentive, and had a great attitude. Thanks to yelp, I ordered the Ban-offee Pie\\n(Shortbread & pecan crust layered w/ caramel & bananas topped w/ whipped cream). My god, it was one of the BESTTT PIEEEE I have ever had in my food loving life. Mission pie in SF is  1/10th as good as good as this pie. We ordered the beef brisket sandwich which was moist and came with fried string onions. The bread was so light and fluffy. The brisket was tender and better than the best Texas BBQ I've had. And I recently went on a tour through Texas stuffing my face so this means a lot. We ordered the side of chicken wings. You can skip this. It's not very tasty, the crust isn't that thick. I'm a popeyes kind of girl and this chicken was just ok. When you sit down they'll ask you if you want coffee. I thought it was on the house, but it turns out coffee is $2.50 for all you can drink. It's kind of watery coffee so skip it. Order a cute drink or something tastier that's on the menu and don't waste the calories. We also ordered a side of oysters and they were very moist and the tartar sauce was ok. I would definitely come back to try the chicken and waffles because literally everyone ordered them. I would order the beef brisket sandwich and pie again, but I wouldn't waste my tummy on the chicken wings. I think they put oregano or some atypical spice in the batter which is slightly weird tasting. Overall, this is definitely worth the visit! Come hungry because we only finished half the piece of pie."},{"name":"Tokyo Japanese Steak House","address":"250 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"Horrendous service.

Even a week in advance they were busy but I was able to snag a reservation for a Tuesday night. There is plenty of street parking but can be tough to come by so be prepared for that. Once we started walking the down the stairs to the entrance I didnt realize it was in the basement but man was I wrong. Plenty of space and windows. Plus the restaurant is huge! We were seated near the kitchen, the more open area of the dining room.Once we sat down we were greeted energetically by our waiter. We placed our drink orders and he recommended we place our order for the burger since they usually run out but it was too late. Several seconds later he came back and said they ran out, no big deal since there was plenty to choose from. The waiter suggested we order six dishes for the three of us to split, so thats what we did. We tried to balance out our dinner by lighter and heavier and I think we were successful. We ordered the Heirloom Eggs, Kale Salad, Grilled Spanish Mackerel, Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly, Corn Pancakes and Hickory Smoked Bigoli. My favorite were the Bigoli and Kale salad. Everything was so good that it was hard to pick a favorite. Splitting six dishes was the perfect amount, so i commend my waiter!I didn't know what to think of the heirloom eggs so I would best describe them as hardboiled eggs with crunch garlic. The Kale Salad was so good in a light pistachio dressing. The first thing I did when i got home was to find a pistachio dressing. The mackerel was quite good, very moist but crispy on the outside. Pork belly was soo good, just indescribable. Corn pancakes were so tasty and came with a sweet cream sauce and homemade popcorn! My other favorite was the bigoli which ive never had before. It was a long thick tube of pasta with an egg oozing on top in a delicious anchovy butter sauce.It is important to mention is that I wasn't over stuffed, I was just the right amount of fullness (which is a good thing).One thing I liked was the interesting combinations of ingredients that I would obviously not have thought about combining.

However, it is at a convenient location right next to Walmart. I've been here a couple times and both service and food are consistent and solid. They don't have a big menu, but have dishes you might not always see at a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. Papaya and shrimp salad - Very refreshing! The taste isn't too strong, but the salad is satisfying and fresh. I'm not a fan of papaya, but this salad was very enjoyable. Definitely a good start to a meal as it gives you a good appetite. Remember to mix the salad well because the sauce usually sinks to the bottom! Pho & banh mi - I find the pho and banh mi good, but nothing special. Beef stew with bread/noodles - I've tried this dish with both bread and noodles. The stew is thick and packed with flavour. It's great to dip bread in. This dish is a tiny bit spicy (for my palate) due to the herbs they use, but I love this dish with the noodles. The stew coats the noodles and is so flavourful.

Last night we went in for dinner before the symphony and the waitress told my wife that although there are indeed oysters on the fresh catch menu she could not have them fried. Raw only. Being puzzeled and caught off guard she asked for the scallops sauteed with maybe some vegetables and rice on the side. The waitress replied that there was a menu item of grilled scallops with bacon but she could not have them sauteed. I guess Jake's chiefs threw out all of there frying pans. We opted for bowls of chowder and speculated that perhaps now, under Landry's all of the meals are pre-made and simply thrown in the microwave before serving ala Applebee's.

Although the food was decent, the process was illogical.  Granted it was a crowded Saturday evening but as you order and receive your dining number, you realize all of the tables are taken.  As you patiently wait for one, individuals come in the exit or separate from their parties to grab a table although they have yet to order. So essentially you have to be cut-throat and play a game of musical restaurant-booths.  I was with my family when I saw a table opening up near the exit, as I walked over a woman came in the exit to take the table.  I attempted to nicely explain how we already ordered and were waiting for a table.  She rolled her eyes and stomped off.  I wish the restaurant would manage this with having a staff member helping with seating.

It seemed to take him a while to grab our drinks, which was a bit surprising, considering we were seated inside, next to the bar and the patio wasn't too terribly busy. Needless to say, my Cherry Pepsi arrived, and it was pretty decent, so I couldn't complain, but the lack of refills was a bit disappointing, considering I had to REMIND him how to make it, and my wife never get water refills, despite asking.The food was pretty decent. We order the cheese fries, and to my surprise, they were waffle fries! The cheese was a bit burned, but it was all good, because I had waffle fries!

Oh, and it's always delicious.I've been several times, but I went again recently and that's the experience I'll recount since it's most recent in my mind.  A friend and I went on a Monday night and even though it was an off night, the earliest reservation available was 8 PM.  No problem.We arrived a little early and since a table wasn't ready yet (it was really busy surprisingly), the host asked us to have a seat at the bar and have a drink until a table was ready.  The drink menu was quite impressive and since it Monday (and who doesn't need a stiff drink after work on Monday?), I ordered a South City Cosmo.  The pink, girly, fruity drink that came out was perfect - just the kind of girly cocktail I was in need of - sweet and tangy and really tasty.Our table was ready quickly, and a separate hostess plucked my drink from my hand and literally carried it to the table set up for us upstairs to prevent me spilling any.  What service!  I've never had my cocktail walked to a table for me - surprising little touch of service I quite appreciated (other restaurants take note).   After that little tangent, back to the story: our table was upstairs near one of the railings overlooking the bar down below - I've never been seated up there before (only on the patio or the main floor), but it was very nice.Our server, Ronald, quickly introduced himself after we were seated, brought water to the table, and told us the specials of the night.  When he returned to take our order he also brought with him the delicious basket of cornbread muffins and biscuits with whipped butter I adore (the expert-ness of the bread basket is another thing I remember fondly of my experiences at South City).  He was very attentive to us throughout our meal, refilling water glasses, bringing the bread basket and entrees quickly and inquiring to our meal throughout the evening.  I ordered the Georgia trout with pesto and my friend got the pan seared duck breast, and we got a side of 'smoky' (whatever that means) mac and cheese to share.  The presentation of each dish was beautiful - simply gorgeous little food works of art!  Even the mac and cheese came out in its own tiny cast iron skillet with lots of cheesy goodness melted over the top.  So cute! And the taste was even better - my trout was juicy and the even the skin was yummy.  The cauliflower puree and and rainbow chard nestled underneath were excellent accompaniments, and the pesto was a perfect topping.  Mac and cheese prowess does not even need to be discussed - with a name like South City Kitchen, could you really expect anything less?For dessert, I persuaded my friend to share the \\"Not Your Momma's\\" apple cobbler.  Could anyone pass up a name like that?  It too, came out in its own little cast iron skilled filled with warm, gooey apple slices, and topped with a cheddar biscuit and clabbered cream (I don't know why it's clabbered either, so don't ask).  We couldn't finish it, but we had a good go and it was worth every bite.I still enjoy South City Kitchen for many reasons, and I'll certainly continue to patronize it - especially if bringing out of towners looking for a taste of the \\"upscale South.\\""},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Franklin, you changed my life.You're BBQ is amazing no question about it.

Ever have food so good that even after you finally let your self-restraint take over and pack up the rest of the food for leftovers, you started eating the leftovers as soon as you got in the car? This was that place for me. Everything was great, but brisket was the absolute highlight (and judging from other reviews, I don't seem to be alone). I kid you not, this was one of the best three places I have ever eaten in my life. And I'm a goddamn snob. WARNING: You WILL wait at least 3 hours before you get your food.

I ordered 2 breakfast tacos in corn and a chicken tinga quesadilla.  There wasn't anything too special about the breakfast tacos except they double up your tortilla so you can make 2 tacos out of 1.  The tinga quesadilla on the other hand was amazing.  They used a homemade blue corn tortilla.  The tinga was spicey and delicious and taste just like mother-in-law's tinga.  I loved it!  My sister had a torta and she let me try a small piece of the bread which was delicious.  I figured I'd buy some to take with us, but when I asked the bakery for the torta bread, they informed me that they don't sell it. That was pretty surprising! Mi Tradicion has a pretty large variety of Mexican bread.  From what we got everything was tasty except for the pumpkin empanadas.  The pumpkin tasted terrible!

We were quoted a 1:30pm meal time and this is seriously the best barbecue I've ever had. Our only mistake after the 3.5 hour wait was not only ordering too much, but devouring all of it. My advice to others is to listen to them when they suggest a 1/2 pound of meat per person. For 3 people, we ordered:Ribs - 1.8 lbs or 6 ribs\\nBrisket - 1 lb (1/2 fatty and 1/2 lean)\\nPulled Pork - 1/2 lb\\nSausage - 1/2 lb\\n1 pint of potato salad\\n1 key lime pieFavorites go to the ribs (5 stars) and brisket (5 stars). I don't think there is any other brisket that comes close. We preferred the fatty brisket so maybe 3/4 fatty and 1/4 lean would have been more appropriate. The staff was great and very friendly and accurate on the time quoted. We lucked out that they still had ribs because they could only guarantee the brisket, pulled pork and sausage. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage (3/5) but then again, I'm also from Chicago and a bit spoiled from other great sausage joints. Pulled pork was a 4/5 and the key lime pie was a 4/5, although I didn't eat it until the next day since I was full of delicious meat. Go here if you're in Austin at least once.

At South City Kitchen, yes, all these items are on the menu and, yes, this does seem, at first glance, like every other restaurant of the nature in Atlanta. However, South City Kitchen does these classics BETTER than its competitors. My family dined here recently to celebrate my mom's birthday. She is a lover of Southern food and this is her favorite restaurant in Atlanta. I had not been here in about a year, but this last experience reminded me why this place is always at the top of my favorite \\"nice\\" restaurants in Atlanta. First of all, the cornbread. When I go here next, I need to remember to tell them to skip on the biscuits (good, but not great) and just bring out more cornbread. It is always sweet, warm, soft, and delicious. I cannot get enough of it. For appetizers, I have had the fried green tomatoes, which are cooked with goat cheese cooked inside the tomato, and serve over a red tomato-based sauce. I also have had the baked oysters, served with a refreshing, light fennel cream.For entrees, I have tried all three of their specialties that are currently on the menu. Last time I ate, I had the fried chicken. They use both white and dark meat, mostly deboned except for the thigh of the dark meat. The bird is served over smashed potatoes and collard greens. The sauce drizzled on top of it ties it all together. It is honey, slightly peppery, but not too overwhelming and not too thick either. I have also had the shrimp n grits, which has bits of spicy tasso ham, definitely making it worthwhile. Also, the north georgia trout is so tender and delicious, it is one of the only times I order that fish (generally dried out and overcooked at many restaurants). Now, after this glowing review, you may wonder why I am giving it only 4 stars. The reason is pretty simple: I hate the location. The restaurant is right across the street from Opera and right next to Flip Flops and Ri Ra. Now I am not some crotchety old baby boomer who is going to complain about millenials. However, when I am enjoying a nice dinner (usually while leaving the restaurant) I really do not want to run into drunken frat bros. Also, I do not know where I am usually supposed to park. There are a couple paid lots and some metered parking, but there is no valet. If they opened a location in Old 4th Ward, Inman Park, or Virginia-Highland, or even West Midtown I would go much more often. Despite my grumbling, I will definitely be back to SCK - Midtown...mostly because the only neighborhoods I hate more than midtown, are Buckhead or anywhere OTP."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"11B Allstate Rd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"Ok you always know what your gonna get.

By the time the doors opened the line was maybe 100 people or so. Aaron Franklin runs the PERFECT BBQ joint. As you make your way into the restaurant, you see the operation. The single line moves through the cutting station, which Aaron Franklin works himself. After waiting almost two hours to hit the meat cutting area, I was greeted by the owner. Nice touch! I ordered my two-meat combo plate with pork ribs and Brisket.  Aaron asked me if I wanted lean or fatty. I responded with \\"Point-end, connected----if you have it\\". He looked at me, asked me where I was from. I told him Memphis. He smiled a little and cut me two prime pieces off a freshly unwrapped brisket. \\"This is where the flavors at\\", he said to me. After a few more brief pleasantries, I thanked him. He thanked me in a gracious manner and moved onto the next fortunate person.I added beans and potato salad to my combo plate, along with a Mexican Coke. The pork ribs were fine. 3 1/2 down spareribs cooked whole. A cheap forgiving cut of pork. They were simply seasoned with very few seasonings, with black pepper being prominent. The pork ribs are better in my hometown of Memphis----but I don't come to Texas to eat swine. The Brisket is perfection. A simple rub of Salt and Pepper, with maybe something else in there, but I think it's just the two. The Oak used in cooking is prevalent, but not overpowering. I didn't use any sauce. I tasted the vinegar sauce and the sweet sauce, and they were both good.The night before I had a hotel clerk tell me the brisket here \\"isn't any good----it just tastes like charcoal\\".  That's the stupidest crap I've heard since George W tried to say Nuclear. The brisket tastes like Beef, Oak, Pepper, Salt---in that order. Simple, effective, and as tender as one could imagine. There's a line for a damn reason. I can't articulate how impressed I am with this formula and operation. 1) Get in line, wait your turn (talk to some people if you want to)\\n2) Meet the owner and watch while he cuts your meat. You instantly forget about the long wait time.\\n3) Eat your delicious brisket and other stuff\\n4) Leave---so someone can eat their delicious brisket at the table you are occupying.This is a barbecue joint, not a restaurant.

I have to say it's not the \\"sloppy fall off the bone ribs\\" I'm use to getting from them.  Maybe it was that days batch?As a person who loves BBQ I have a particular style rib that I like, a tender, juicy meat but not falling all over the table ribs.

A few standouts were:\\nGrilled Chorizo - I loved the saltiness of the pork and the sweetness of the chutney!\\nStuffed Date - I thought it was absolutely delicious. It's difficult to tell if Toro makes it better or not but this was still quality.\\nQueso Fundido Empanada - this looks like a crab Rangoon except with jalapeno peppers inside! It was really bready but still good.These are just 3 of the ten delicious apps. There was honestly nothing that I did not like. For drinks we got the mega margarita that is supposed to serve 4-6. One note: it only serves 4, unless it's 6 girls that are all under 100 pounds. Me and my friend shared it easily and it was just like having 2 margaritas each. It's a little on the pricey side but it was worth it. The tequila/mix ratio was perfect. They also have a humongous assortment of tequila. I'm not the biggest fan of tequila but I wouldn't mind trying a few of them one day.The service was great as well. Granted when we came in we were one of the few customers. But it started getting crowded and yet we weren't ignored. That was really nice. The manager also offered to take a picture of us (I wanted to upload the picture of the margarita).

I thought the service was a little slow at first, but when I looked around the restaurant and saw how busy the place was, I could definitely understand why our server wasn't as quick as we would've liked.We ordered about 8 dishes between the 4 of us and I think that was just enough to satisfy our rumbling tummies.  We started with the fried octopus, which was one of the smaller appetizers, but still enough for all of us to try a few bites.  The bacon aioli was such a great addition to this dish and really complemented the flavour of the octopus.Next, we tried the warm kale salad - I think this one was my favourite. The flavours were amazing - it's hard to believe that some people don't like kale, but this dish will probably change anyone's mind about kale.  The all-Canadian poutine came out shortly after, smothered in cheese curds, smoked brisket and gravy.  Wow.  This dish is definitely not for those watching their calorie intake, but if you're sharing, a few bites ain't gonna kill ya!  The smoked meat was tender and the cheese curds were at the perfect temperature, so the gravy softened them and blended all the flavours together.The Salt Spring Island mussels were really tasty and we all enjoyed the tomato coconut broth.  Not the best mussels I've had, but definitely good.The duck canneloni was a table favourite, probably based on presentation alone. The shaved foie gras was an interesting addition, as well.

It wasn't the best burger I've had in town, but one of them. I found it to be worth the 11 or so dollars. If you like fast food burgers, then save your money; and I would also say that unless you like a giant spicy burger there is a pretty good chance you won't be impressed with this place. We also ordered the appetizer special of the day which was fries with gravy, chicken, cheese curds and peas. Sounds strange but was also very good. Lastly we got the Ice Cream Pie which I'd recommend as well.

The food is a mix between cajun and tex mex which means there are some interesting combinations available. Also, pretty much anyone can find something there that they are going to be happy to eat. Some of the food is spicy but conservatively so, no need for fire extinguishers here.The best part of Border is how the restaurant is decorated. The entire interior has hand painted motifs all over the ceilings and walls. It makes a funky, we're in a college town but adults can still be seen here kind of vibe.Service in general here is alright. They come to the table pretty quickly and are quick to take drink orders. The problem is that the drinks come about 5 to 7 minutes later. In the meantime they have already brought you salty fresh tortilla chips and spicy salsa which means that you feel like you are so thirsty you could die by the time they remember your margarita or soda. Maybe its just me but I think the order of that should be flipped. After they get  your order and the food arrives your server  basically disappears (sometimes a good thing) which means sometimes it takes forever to get your bill and get out of there. The host staff here are not so great. Im sure maybe it is restaurant policy but regardless of whether the restaurant  is empty they will NEVER seat you unless your whole party is here. Which means when your date has the great idea of dropping you at the door while he parks you will stand in a freezing cold entrance where you are constantly in the way until he gets back....even though there are twenty empty tables right in front of your face. All in all Border is awesome. Come here with a group of friends when you dont care that the restaurant is going to be loud, score some awesome cheap drinks and food, be prepared not to leave in a hurry (dont do this before a movie or something with a start time) and make sure you all arrive at the same time or be prepared to wait."},{"name":"Marco's Restaurant","address":"47 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"This place is located in a strip mall of US 1 North Bound.

I like that they have a new menu everyday. There's so many things on their menu that I wanted to get. At first I wanted to get a bunch of appetizers so I could try everything, but decided to get an entree instead. I also got a bowl of the crab bisque. The cup size is about 6 oz (according to the waiter) and the bowl is only $2 more and double the amount, so I got the bowl and figured I could take the rest back if I couldn't finish it. It was delicious and super creamy. I love bisque, but this one was maybe a bit too creamy. My favorite part of the soup was the big lump of crab in the middle, of course :) You kinda have to drink this fast because it becomes firm really quickly! Looking back now, I think I should've gotten the cup size...They also give you sourdough bread and butter. I wish that bread was warm though :/For my entree, I got the crab and rockfish sautee which also came with mashed potatoes and veggies (green beans and carrots). The crab/fish sautee was really good. At first I really liked the sauce, but after a while the lemon in the sauce became a little too much. The mashed potatoes were SUPER creamy, and my date really liked them. The veggies were cooked well and they were still crunchy. My date ordered the sirloin and lobster combo, which also came with mashed potatoes and veggies. The lobster was DELICIOUS! One of the best I've ever tried. I didn't steal any of his steak though. I wanted to try some dessert, but I was stuffed. After we finished our food we realized that there wasn't any crawfish on the menu...strange, but no biggie since we probably wouldn't have ordered it anyway.The service was wonderful.

For appetizers I tried the tuna tartar which was delicious, a couple of the pieces were a bit too done for my taste but otherwise the overall dish was delicious.  Bonus points because by the time the food was ordered, it came out very quickly, and hot. The carpaccio was delicious and light, a must try.  After sharing both appetizers and watching countless other bar patrons eating the duck wings, I decided to order them and indulge.  They were a solid \\"good\\" although I was a little bit on the disappointed side.  The wings were small although the saving grace was the sauce. It was so delicious, light and sweet. The Ward 8 mac and cheese was also delicious.  Creamy, with spoonful after spoonful of goodness. The biggest drawback for me was the noise. I found myself at times near yelling at my foodie friend.

I think the mayo content was fine. It was the chicken that was dry. \\nAnd that's about how it went. Most of the meat was cooked to a dry medium well if not well done. And man was is salty. I'm so grateful to Lisa, because if my glass had gone empty, I'm not sure how I would have survived!! They cut you nice big wedges of meat, much bigger than you get at the other chain Brazilian steakhouses. They even offered to double me up on chicken, sausage, and pork ribs!\\nYou can tell, they're paying attention and trying to be great. And to be honest, I appreciate that effort. It's a good spot to visit. And for $34.95 at lunch (no automatic gratuity), I'd come back.

They also have unlimited fresh squeezed juices in addition to soda, so you aren't confined to just carbonated drinks. The downside is that my pizza came overcooked. Everyone around me had nice golden crust but mine was black. They are a little over priced. I have been to other places that do the same thing and have paid less for a larger pizza.

By contrast, my other drink orders - a standard rum and coke, and a pomegranate martini, were decidedly uninspiring.As far as food goes, my favorite appetizer is the nachos.  I was really excited by the buffalo tofu, but it turned out to be way to spicy for me.  Their veggie burgers are delish, and I have it on good authority that their animal burgers aren't bad, either.  Where they really shine is their brunch.  A bunch of friends and I went there on a late Sunday morning, got a table easily, and treated ourselves to their variety of creative brunch options.

While we are not big drinkers we both enjoy a good Bloody Mary from time to time. And as it was a holiday we indulged. Nice spice, not overly strong with a delicious pickled okra garnish.

My wife ordered the bananas foster french toast, simple but oh so good. Love the hint of orange, the soft but not mushy bread and the fact that the plate could have fed us all.

Never having had to combination it seemed this would be the ideal circumstance to give it a try. And I was not disappointed one bit. The bird was crispy with a nice peppery finish, a prefect compliment to the bloody as well as the waffle. The sweet potato did not stand out but the waffle was still great. I have seen the light, we will be back for more!I would suggest that it is worth the wait but that is a personal decision. We all had a great time, service was excellent and the food was wonderful. I would give the Screen Door four and a half stars if I could.

Also, the concept is really cute, and they played Motown hits that we all came to love.The following two visits are where it all went horribly wrong. I literally developed a craving for their wings and decided that yes, it WAS worth the gas and time (during final 4 weekend!) to trek down there and get some. Mind you, I'd talked this place up to a co-worker to the point where she had me pick up a plate for her as well. The wings ended up being so salty that they were inedible! I mean I literally had to take the skin off to eat them (thank god they marinade though...). I was sorely disappointed. It was like whoever made the wings just poured the whole container of seasoning in there and closed the lid.My third and final time there (thus far) I got a burger. They're hand made and the bun was good, but again with the salt? Come on with these games! I don't too much care for high blood pressure, but I was hungry to the point of irritability so I scarfed  it down anyway.I really wanted to adore this place with all my heart..,. fall in love with *that spot* in the neighborhood... but due to the inconsistency I just have to pass for a while."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I could barely finish a quarter of it and had to throw out the rest. I thought: Ok, this is more of a bakery than a coffee shop, maybe coffee's just not their thing. However, the slice of carrot cake I ordered was also a disappointment. It looked beautiful, but the icing to cake ratio was way too high. I felt like I was eating a big block of icing. I did also try one of the tiny pastries (it was a mini tiramisu- there were many options and they were less than $2 each) and it was good, so I think I might come back and try more of those.

To get to CityWalk you don't need to have tickets to either of the parks (Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure), but you do need to go through security (bag checks) and share parking with park go-ers. Like most in the restaurant I assume, I came here after a long day at Universal Studios. SETTING: The restaurant fits in with the rest of the park: big, bold, shiny, loud. They take your name at the door outside and have a text alert system, which I'm sure is useful when they are super busy, but they weren't that busy when we came so it seemed a little silly. Inside they have multiple floors of seating; we ended up on the top floor. The interior is punctuated with lots of bright colors and patterns, funky artwork, and music that I found to be a bit too loud (and a little tasteless, but that's just my opinion.)SERVICE: Our waitress was fine but unmemorable. There was a point where I was thinking \\"We've been waiting for a while...where is our food?\\"FOOD: They're thing is that they are burgers and sushi (with bento boxes offering both). I ordered the veggie burger with a fried egg. With the egg I actually thought it was pretty good. Without the egg, it would have been relatively uninspiring however. I also tried some California rolls, which were fine, not exactly fresh, but fine. The sweet potato fries were just ok as well.Overall, an ok experience.

These days that tired stale joke is still going strong, but if you are an explorer worth your salt you'd know that that joke is not only no longer funny but in most parts of downtown it's also no longer true.  There are a gazillion great little pockets in the Discovery district, Olde Towne, Scioto Mile to name a few, but the one I'm talking about is a non-descript stretch of 4th Street between Franklin University and German Village, which houses Dirty Frank's.The theme itself is what gave me my doubts at first.  I expected to see outrageous novelty varieties like peanut butter and jelly hot dogs, cotton candy hot dogs, etc, but the 30-some varieties seemed viable and solid and got my inner-Pavlov going.  I've sampled about ten of them so far -I recommend the Zippity Zam and a Puff the Magic Popper with a side of Tater Totchos- and now I look forward to trying the rest.The real magic, though, is the Speedy Gonzalez-esque service.  While not rude by any stretch, the staff simply doesn't have the time to be chatty and attentive.  Once they open at 11am, they are primed and ready to bust some major ass for the lunch crowd, setting em up and knocking em down.  The tiny dining area, no larger than maybe 30' square, quickly fills at noon and lines begin to form around the corner.  But oddly enough, orders are filled at a blinding pace and turnover is equally fast, so your lunch wait time is maybe 20 mins tops.  My advice is to do carry out instead (even at the height of rush they can turn large orders around in 5-10 mins), and save the leisurely visit for dinner or a late night snack (they close at 2am).The bottom line: these guys aren't fly by night.  They make a killer dog, they have vegan and gluten-free options, and are more than reasonably priced.  Very much worth the visit.  And a return visit.

Unfortunately, the only thing resembling the former Cafe 101 was the building; the food was absolutely abysmal. \\n    We started with the highly recommended fried chicken appetizer. Bite-sized pieces of bland, over-cooked chicken served with a side of...paprika. That's right...a side of paprika and nothing else. My girlfriend joked that they must have raided a KFC and taken all the Chicken Poppers to use as apps. And believe it or not, this was the best part of the meal. \\n    Next came the Dan Dan noodles. I love Dan Dan sauce; I eat it every chance I get and I even make it myself at home. I can say with equivocation that this was the worst rendition of Dan Dan noodles I have ever had. Bland, flavorless and served with over-cooked noodles to boot. It reminded us of our paste-eating days in preschool. \\n   Finally, the coup de gr√¢ce killing all further interest in Cafe 101 was the garlic basil calamari. These are whole squid about 3 inches long, cut in half with the pen left in place. Gag. But the worst part is that the calamari was not fresh...not even close. Double gag. I'll spare the reader further details of this little culinary plum.\\n     I'm generally loathe to give a restaurant only one star, but Cafe 101 worked hard to earn this distinction and I must give credit where credit is due.

We enjoy the waiting in line, but we usually come prepared. \\nFood: Their brisket is the best I've ever had. This coming from a man who worked as a butcher and lived off of Texas BBQ all of his life. Their sausage and birds are good too, but the brisket is where it is at. Seriously, if it is your first visit get the brisket. It is delicious. It induces a state that my group calls \\"Meat Drunk\\" after consumption. I think I've received divine messages in this state.People complain about the wait and it is very long so here are a series of tips:1. Bring a camp/folding chair. This makes the wait not so bad since you're not standing for hours. If you show up and complain about standing, you're doing it wrong.2. If it is your first time, go when the weather is nice. BBQ is great, but not when you pass out due to the Texas heat on a asphalt parking lot. Don't be a hero.3. Dress appropriately. I see sad sad interns from businesses sending out their plebeians dressed in business attire that look horrible after waiting for 3-4 hours out in the open. Don't wear heels unless you hate yourself and this is a method of performing some sort of penance for a past misdeed.4.  Bring some drinks. This sets my positive waiting experience apart from other's complaining about this. With your chairs, nice weather, and comfy clothes all that's left is a cool drink. You can have alcohol while waiting (they'll sell it to you in line in fact). Seriously, bring something refreshing. I like to bring some local Austin brews to pair with my eventual meal. One of my gang brings a mason jar full of bloody mary. 5. Bring entertainment. We usually hook up an iPod or something to some portable speakers and play some nice country classics to get in the spirit. In summary: All of this preparation is worth it for the amazing BBQ you'll experience. If you want to have fun with it, bring some friends and make an event of the wait."},{"name":"No Mas!

Very bland, with almost no seasoning, save the butter and a bit of shallot.  But that was the only disappointment.My kids had the Porcini Ravioli with basil pesto and shaved Parmesan cheese.  They loved it.  I thought it was good as well.  My wife had the Mesclun salad with a scoop of chicken salad on the side.  The chicken salad was okay.  The salad was very nice and the salad dressing was fantastic.  She chose the lemon vinaigrette, which was a wonderful emulsion of lemon juice, olive oil and garlic.  I supplemented my mussels with the Smoked Trout.  It was the clear winner.  Maybe the best smoked trout I have had, placed on top of the aforementioned salad.  It comes with the Garbanzo & Olive Salsa, which is a bit bland, but great when tossed into the salad and coated with the yummy dressing.  To top it off, it is on the happy hour menu and rings in at only $9!!All of this is served with some very good bread.  A nice French baguette which is sliced into rounds, a wheat bread, and a really nice cranberry/raisin/nut bread that is so good with butter and makes a great dessert in itself.We cant wait to go back for more.

We ordered a shake, a scoop of banana ice cream with caramel, and a White Chocolate Coconut Frozen Hot Chocolate (approx $30).  This one small area behind the counter is used to prepare all the desserts for the restaurant, as well as ring up the customers in the candy store, and serve walk-ups from the outside window.  There were at least 5 or 6 girls working behind this counter at once, and it was extremely chaotic.The milkshake came out fine, and was actually pretty good.  Then they handed us the ice cream, with caramel dripping down over the side of the cup before they even handed it to us.  They didn't attempt to clean the sides or put it in a larger container, just handed it to us with caramel dripping all over the counter and subsequently all over our hands.While we're waiting for the frozen hot chocolate, we noticed a burning smell.  Turns out, it was the blender they were using to mix the frozen hot chocolate.  The girl kept trying to turn it on but it wasn't working.  Then it started smoking from the back, which I could see from my side of the counter.  When I told her she didn't seem surprised.  She said something to the other girls, and then tried to find a different blender.  While this was happening, another girl noticed that they were making my drink with regular chocolate instead of white chocolate.  So now she has to start over.  Then still needs to find a blender...While we're waiting, we see another girl making a milkshake for someone in the restaurant.  She dripped some chocolate sauce on the outside of the glass, and took a dirty rag (which was previously used to wipe down the dirty counter) and used it to wipe the outside and rim of the glass. She then poured the shake in that glass and sent it off to be served.At this point it has been 10 minutes and we're still waiting for the frozen hot chocolate.   They finally find a blender, and once she blends it she pours it into a cup.  When she turns around to get the whipped cream, another girl takes my frozen hot chocolate and walks away with it.  We see this happen, and tell the original girl, who says \\"Don't worry there's some more in the blender\\".  Apparently someone in the restaurant ordered one, and this other girl decided to just take the one sitting on the counter.  The original girl pours out the remaining drink from the blender into a new cup, tops it off with whipped cream and hands it to me.It was full of chunks of chocolate and ice (not blended enough).  Also it says on the menu that it's made with melted white chocolate but they used some type of solid white chocolate instead which had settled into the bottom of the cup.  Horrible service, unprofessional, untrained, overpriced, and unsanitary.  It was a mess.  They also messed up 2 other orders while we were there waiting for ours to be finished.   Needless to say, we have cancelled our reservations that we had for this weekend and will never be returning.

Street parking only, unless you park in the few spots in front of the barber shop right next door, which I think is reserved for the barber shop.There was only one person working the place.  I didn't get his name, but he was a one man show.  He was doing the dishes while greeting me, and letting me know to ask him if I had any questions about the menu, and unless you're up to date with the latest health nut foods, you'd probably have some questions.  Meanwhile, he had 2 other customers dining there and was preparing and bringing their food out.  If you are like me and expected to get the typical bland, under seasoned tofu and veggies, and cardboard-flavored granola and tangy yogurt, you are grossly mistaken.  The tofu curry over jasmine brown rice is the most healthfully delicious, environmentally friendly, organic vegetarian dish I have ever had.  Just about everything on their menu is organic, by the way, and everything they use is earth friendly (compostable take out boxes and utensils), which I appreciate.  You can make the order a plate by adding the greens or the sweet potato smash.  I didn't know which to pick so he offered to give me a little of both.  How nice!

It's busy during the lunch hour, so we went later in the day --we we're cool with the server, wait time, service and food.   They gave me a Chili dog when I ordered a Chicago before and they let me have the Chili one for free.  You can't beat a freebee! :).  They should feature this place on Guy Fieri's \\"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\\" show or have a Yelp event here.

I stay at their properties all the time, but unfortunately this location didn't quite do it for me. I booked for 3 days initially, and ended up canceling my two remaining nights to stay at a Residence Inn. The staff was absolutely wonderful, no complaints there at all. The room itself, though, left a lot to be desired. The room felt a bit dated, it lacked a sense of comfort. The enormous air conditioner below the window was noisy as hell, and a real eye sore. The bathroom felt a little dingy, too. The television reception was TERRIBLE. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you're winding down at night, it's nice to be able to turn on the TV and relax. Unfortunately every other channel was incredibly dark, flickering, or totally unwatchable. Strange, considering the Residence Inn about a mile away literally has flat screen TVs with HD channels. Step it up, Courtyard. The burger I ordered downstairs was great, though. Just put a little bit of money into this location or something, give it a facelift. Until then, I'll be staying at other locations."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Awesome late night greasy burgers! The hot dogs are a-ok.

They have a rotating pop-up culinary program where the chefs rotate every 6 months. This review is for the current chef Patrick Enage who is from the Philippines. \\"Akinto\\", which means \\"this is mine\\" in Filipino, reflects Chef Enage's distinctive culinary perspective, which includes a diverse repertoire of creations with flavors blended together from the Philippines, Vietnam, China, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Laos and India...pretty much covers all of Asia!The ambiance, environment and bar set up has a Prohibition-era type style. They even have a doorman who looks like he is going to ask you for a secret password but he does not. The entire place is dark and very dimly lit...perhaps a tad bit too dark. I personally am not a fan of the \\"restaurant\\" area because it is so ghostly dark that you can't see a darn thing. I made a reservation and we were seated in the restaurant area so I asked the hostess to move us to the bar, which was a billion times better. Dear owner or manager of Wink and Nod, I highly recommend lighting the dining room a little bit better. I promise it will not ruin the speak easy feel, but will in fact allow your guests to actually see each other when conversing. Thank you. Wink and Nod is a fabulous place for a date. It is romantic and cool and the menu has several small and medium plates, oh so perfect for sharing. It is also a dandy spot to go with a group of friends because you can order a bunch of dishes and share away! That's what we ended up doing indeed. I am so happy I got to try so many different plates because I enjoyed every single one and now I want to return to try the few little guys on the menu that slipped away. They also have drinks for everyone, with an emphasis on creative cocktails and tiki drinks. Below is a rank of the dishes we liked in order of favorite to least favorite per group consensus: (1) Prawns with Squid Ink Lo Mein, Khmer Red Curry Broth, and Mango - An absolute MUST TRY!!! A staple dish of Chef Enage. \\n(2) Kalbi, XO-Coconut Glaze, Calamansi, Cilantro, Flowering Chives, and Peanuts - Well seasoned and perfectly cooked with a smoky twist\\n(3) Spicy Pork \\"Drop Wontons\\", Anise BBQ, Toasted Sesame-Rice Wine, and Peanut Paste - These are delicious but I ranked them third because you can get decent dumplings at several places in the city. \\n(4) Kabayaki Glazed Swordfish Belly, Taiwan Lettuce, with Salted Duck Egg Vinaigrette - A little piece of heaven that melts in your mouth. The coconut broth served with the fish was a delight. \\n(5) Chicken Tom Kha Gai, Thai Coconut Broth, Lemongrass, and Lime - This dish was nothing special. I can easily stir-fry chicken and veggies at home in 5 minutes so I would pass on this one.\\n(6) Vegetarian Banh mi, Marinated Mushrooms, Daikon, Carrot, Chilies, Cilantro, and Onion Crisps - Not a big fan of these mini sandwiches. The rest of the food was significantly betterOverall, I was sincerely impressed with the food and service at Wink and Nod. My only critique is that Chef Enage uses coconut milk a little bit too generously. For all the broth based dishes we ordered, the broth tasted exactly the same. It was a coconut base with a few things added in. Coconut milk is the backbone of several Thai dishes and I am a big fan of it, but a variety of flavors would have made for a more harmonious meal rather than a homogenous meal."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Having felt the lack in the ATL for a while, a friend and co-worker of mine suggested trying Fox Bros BBQ. We went after work and arrived just before a torrential downpour, but were able to sit safely under a screened in porch area and watch the rain.Typically BBQ is dry, has little meat, or has a really bad sauce. If you're unlucky, you'll find yourself stuck in a joint suffering from more than one of the aforementioned issues. But not here. You won't find any of those worries troubling you. Good sauce, good food, good service. DANGER: The food is very delicious! The pulled pork, the brisket, the tots, the sides... it's all so good and fabulously Southern (in other words, far from healthy but good for the soul). Real comfort food right there. Both of my friends ordered the hat they loved it so much!I'm a big fan of more bang for your buck, and Fox Bros delivers. You get a heaping pile of BBQ goodness that almost always requires a take-home box. It's the perfect scenario: more good eats for later! The prices are easily affordable and go hand-in-hand with the picnic-style bar feel.As we say in the South, it's finger-lickin' good.

Given the limited English skills of the staff, it might be easiest to pick up a menu in advance and order by number.If the system allowed me, I'd give it 3.5 stars.

And had a great crisp on the outside. The waffles was also delicious - slightly hard/crispy skin but very soft and fluffy inside. The waffles themselves are not very sweet so it works very well with the syrup. DEFINITELY recommend this dish if you enjoy Chicken and Waffles.Also shared the fried green tomatoes with my girlfriend. Also very enjoyable. The sauce it comes with is more for decoration and I didn't really taste it, but the fried green tomatoes were fried very well - super crispy but not burnt at all. The goat cheese inside had a strong flavor that went well with the tomatoes.Their soup of the day was a type of eggplant soup with other veggies topped with cheese (forgot the specifics) and it was also packed with flavor. It tasted like pizza in a soup. We also got the she-crab soup which tasted very much like lobster bisque, but with crab.My girlfriend got the jumbo lump crab cake hash. I only got to sample a little and enjoyed every bite.Service was terrific, the waitress was attentive, gave suggestions when she found out it was our first time, was quick with water refills, and very nice.The location itself is pretty cool too, it seems like the building was previously a house that they renovated into a restaurant. Overall I highly recommend it for Brunch and I'm sure the lunch/dinner experience would be just as good. The only thing to be wary of is the prices are on the higher end (my chicken and waffles was 19, most dishes and appetizers are 10-20)."},{"name":"Zam Zam","address":"42 Riverside Ave","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"Horrible biryani which had chunks of tomato paste and wasn't cooked well.

The rice and beans is very dry, but it still has good flavor. I would go with the classics like mac n cheese, mashed potato or cole slaw. The cole slaw is heavy on the liquid mayo though... also, the corn bread comes out cold. Like what? CORN BREAD IS SUPPOSED TO BE WARM AND SOFT AND CRUMBLY. I would come back for the ribs alone, but don't expect fast service. When I went, it took forever to get our orders, get our food and clean up.

This momentous occasion, fortunately enough for us, was shortly before the happy hour rush.Our waitress was very friendly and provided recommendations for the beers they had on tap.  Though I really do enjoy beer, for some reason I was in the mood for a hard cider, so I went with a Crispin's (in a bottle).  Our waitress returned with the Crispin's as well as a sample for a peach flavored beer that they currently had on tap - it was pretty good too.We ordered the pretzel with beer cheese and spicy mustard.  The pretzel arrived piping hot - far to hot to handle, which only heightened the anticipation.  Of course, it was delish with both the beer cheese and the spicy mustard.  It was a good appetizer.Then, I ordered the spicy Cajun pasta.  My wife ordered the French dip.  Good flavors indeed, though there may have been a rather heavy-handed use of onion in my pasta.  It almost seemed like there were as many long shreds of onion as there were strands of pasta.  Nevertheless, the sauce was very good with just the right amount of heat and the blackened chicken was flavorful.  I was also happy with the couple bites of the French dip sandwich that I was able to grab - pretty salty.All in all good eats, though I'm not sure how long it will be before I return given the precarious nature of driving and parking in the inner-city.

For me, my experience at a restaurant (even a pizza joint) is largely about experience and setting as much as it is about the food. I don't think that this location being in the Pearl District has anything to do with the snobbishness, rather, it's just that the staff at this location are just plain douche-y. I've been to this location several times, and each time its the same douche-y staff.After my most recent experience at this location, I just won't be coming back anymore."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I really wanted to like this place. If you're not familiar, you're supposed to order 2 plates a person. It's similar to tapas, but the plates are bigger than tapas. I think the real reason they set the menu up this way is because they make ONE. DISH. AT. A.TIME. It's easier for them because they don't have to time multiple dishes to come out together, which is hard to do. The first time I went there for brunch, there were 3 of us. The first person got their meal, then a few minutes later, the second person. We sat, waiting for the third person to get theirs so we could start eating. After 5 minutes or so, 3rd person insisted we start. We finished our meals before the 3rd person got theirs. Awkward. The 3rd person felt they had to wolf theirs down while we sat and waited. They completely forgot to order the 3rd meal. How do you put in an order 2, but not 3 meals??Second visit was last night. They gave us a shitty table with both a view to the kitchen, traffic to the bathroom going right by, AND a draft from the front door. We asked to move, just as the waitress came by. She took the time to guilt us about moving out of her section. \\"No, no, that's ok, I get it...\\" Weird.Our waiter was pretty useless. Every question I asked about the menu, he had some smartass, non-informative answer. \\"Can you tell me about this cocktail?\\" Usually, the waiter talks about whether it's a really boozy or lighter drink, what the flavors are like, etc. This guy just said, \\"I'm sure it's really balanced.\\" You're sure? Have you tried it? Hmmm. I just felt like he didn't know anything about the menu, but didn't want to admit it.We got the carrots and the squash one right after the other. When I order vegetables, I'm looking for something a little lighter, not something drenched in butter/oil/cheese. They managed to make vegetables feel like a heavy gut bomb. Ugh. A half hour passed while we tried to flag down our waiter again. I asked, \\"Can you check on the status of our other two plates? We've been waiting a long time.\\" His answer, \\"I'm sure they're coming right out.\\" Really? You have the order list from the kitchen in your head? Impressive. They did not \\"come right out.\\" It took what seemed like a year to get his attention again after our meal was finished. He tried to drop off dessert menus without asking if we wanted any. \\"THE CHECK!!!\\" we both blurted out. We just wanted to leave! What was supposed to be an nice date night was an exercise in frustration. (sad trumpet sound).

I'm surprised I never reviewed it. I think the Midtown location is the OG South City Kitchen. One of the things about the Midtown location is that you have to pay for parking. And parking is expensive! On Sunday, I had to pay $10 for parking. That's a lot of money to pay just to go there to eat brunch. I would suggest going to their other locations if you don't want to pay a huge parking fee. They don't validate parking either. The inside looks like an old, Southern house. It's two stories, with seating available on both stories. In such a small real-estate, they seemed to have maximized their spaces. The bathroom is also upstairs. Their brunch menu looks standard. You can get your mimosas or Bellinis in a pitcher. You can get your standard pimento cheeses, frittatas, and other brunch-like goodies. I opted for the classic Chicken and Waffles. On their menu, it's called, \\"Springer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken & Malted Buttermilk Waffle.\\" What a mouthful. The dish consisted of fried white meat chicken and 4 pieces of buttermilk waffle. The presentation, as usual, looked great. South City Kitchen always does a great job on their presentation. It's so Instagram friendly. The waffles tasted great, especially with their Vermont maple syrup. The chicken was spiced well and was juicy. I got to try the Carolina Trout and that tasted great too. The trout tasted nice and fresh. The lentil salad that was under the fried trout tasted good too.They also give you their complimentary, addictive cornbread and biscuits for the table. It comes with butter and apple butter. Those were so good. You have to be careful you don't get full off the bread alone. I loved how the cornbread had pieces of corn kernels. The service was amazing. Our server took care of very well. South City Kitchen always had amazing service from my experience. They know how to take care of their clients, act friendly, and they just do a great job. I wish I remember her name to call her out, but I forgotten. :( Oh well, she did a great job.

But a friend was in town and we needed a table of 14 for a Saturday night, and Pazzo was available, and so it went.The good: We were seated and accommodated no problem even when one more joined our party, downstairs all by ourselves. The hostesses were very pleasant and gracious, the waitstaff extremely attentive (I believe the term used was 'hovering', which actually was a bit much sometimes), and there seems to be something of a food sommelier there-? I think it was one of the hostesses, but she was excellent, telling us all about the menu/specials and sharing her favorites and helping us each decide what we wanted. It seems they have $5 apps at the bar all the time, and those at our table who got the arancini as a starter thought they were divine. The warm white bean dip and bread was yummy, and the presentation of all our food was very artistic and colorful (it *looked* tasty at least), and each entree had a large amount of food (no apps necessary).The bad: the entrees. Not good. Not one single person at the table actually liked what they got (and it was a range of items, we were all over the map), a few of us actively disliking or even hating their meals (shortrib people were not pleased). I had the scallops, and while they weren't the worst scallops I've ever had, they were not very good either- major disappointment. I did enjoy the sweet potato gnudi it was served with though, nice flavor on that (it also came with some asparagus spears), but even those were very much on the salty side (my entire plate was ridiculously salty). Additionally, one of us thinks she got food poisoning after eating the salmon (she had to go straight home after dinner). Plus it's Newbury, the prices are high ($18-24 for entrees), so you better believe if I'm dropping that much cash it better be fricken delicious (hello Ten Tables, Oleana), and Pazzo just fell wayyyyy short.They tried really hard (staffers) and were so accommodating and pleasant, so extra points for that, but the food was just not good.

If I were rating it strictly on the food/wine and nothing else, the score would be higher. Prehaps it was just an off Saturday night but when I called to make reservations, the person answering the phone could not have been less enthusiastic. Okay, not the end of the world but still, \\"you don't get a second chance to make a first impression.\\"Upon arrival we were greeted and seated immediately by what turned out to be our server, we were seated right by the front door. Okay, not the end of the world but the restaurant was half full and it was pretty chilly outside so every time a party arrived, we'd get a blast of cold air. I completely understand when a restaurant is packed, on a wait and the chilly front door table is your only option....but this place was never more than half full. Our server was pleasant enough and knowledgeable but I felt like I had to probe them on everything from the wine list to the menu despite the fact my guest and I informed them it was our first time dining at Relish and had never dined there before.... Hint, this is a cue to tell us all about the menu, concept, etc. Okay, not the end of the world.Timing - Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes, which on a Saturday night with a bottle of wine just opened should have been timed better. While they food runner asked if we were ready to eat, I felt obligated to accept it because I did not want it to sit under the heat lamps and die. Cuisine\\nBraised Pork & hand-cut Pasta - 5 stars !! Perfect, moist, lean, tasty, complimenting flavor profile.....must try. Wild Salmon - Unremarkable - slightly undercooked however, cooked properly, I doubt that would change my opinion. Broccolini was good. Wine \\nrecommendation was very good and reasonably prices by the bottle. This is something NOT published on the menu but if you were thing of having more than a glass with your guest, a bottle is definitely the way to go. For those not familiar, most restaurants allow you to order a bottle, cork it once opened to take it home.  Overall - Relish Gastropub probably deserves a 4 star review with some minor adjustments. We enjoyed the food and wine. Our server was nice and I would give Relish another try.Portland is a foodie town, if you are going to charge foodie prices, the experience needs to reflect that."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, great service.

The nice waitress had continued to pour us coffee.  When the next couple sat down, we asked the waitress where our food was.  At that point we had been sitting for 40 minutes.  She said the sandwiches were much quicker than breakfast.  Five minutes later our breakfast showed up.  The eggs benedict were very good but not worth the wait.  After we were finished, I waited to pay the check by cc.  I finally gave up and left cash.  This is the last time Sonsie will see us.  I would not recommend this place if you are hungry.

The one complaint most people have is that there's nowhere nearby to eat the food.  They have 1 outside table for seating, and when it's busy that's rarely available.What most people don't know is that there's a playground within walking distance, that has a couple more tables and is always empty.

You could say it was our fault for expecting to have an excellent dinner during restaurant week, but I counter that a restaurant shouldn't participate if they don't think that they can provide a solid experience.Wine: we order an unusually bad Pinot Noir.  It was definitely on the cheaper end, but given the number of passable wines that one can buy for an affordable price, there was really no excuse for this to be on the menu.Food: Butternut squash soup was genuinely good.  Eggplant lasagna consisted of about one slice of eggplant covered in about a half pound of cheese.  I ate a little less than half of it by picking out as many small bits of non-cheese as I could.  Molten chocolate cake was neither molten nor particularly chocolatey.  It tasted vaguely chalky, actually, and the whipped cream on top had melted into a puddle by the time we received it.Atmosphere: Truly awful.  The wait was extremely long, which is completely forgivable under the circumstances.  I actually didn't mind it much.  But the place was loud, and its loudness was compounded by an extraordinarily bad band that played reggae covers of pop songs.  Not appreciated.To summarize: Masa may possibly be good for drinks or tapas--I can't say myself--but proceed with extreme trepidation if you ever must be subjected to dinner here.

The staff is nice, the food comes out quickly and I'm pretty sure they've hired a few part-time magicians because I never once saw someone fill my water glass but---voila---it was always full. Sneaky.The burgers are AWESOME. I know this sounds kind of weird but the bun is literally like those $400 pillows you fall in love with at Bed Bath & Beyond but could never afford in this lifetime. So soft and plush. The meat is cooked PERFECTLY every single time and their specialty burgers have amazing flavor. My favorite is the Spicy Jalape√±o but I'm sure I'll add a few more to that list next time I go.The only reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars is because they use that cheese that is reminiscent of melted plastic.

Our reservation was on a Monday at 8pm, it was not a busy night, the bar was not full, there were a few empty tables on the floor. But for some reason, I had to wait over fifteen minutes for a refill, to the point where I had to ask the hostess to refill my drink. Maybe our server, Cameron, forgot. He seemed to be extremely attentive to the party sitting next to us (who weren't even ordering) but couldn't give us the time of day. In fact, several times throughout our meal, we had to have the hostess take care of our requests and orders.At the end of the night he haphazardly asked if we would like desert, I asked what was on the menu and he mentioned beignets. I asked if we could take an order to go, since we were full. He delivered them to us 15 minutes later with plate settings, as if we were going to eat them there. He clearly wasn't listening to us, that's fine-- The place is fairly noisy, maybe he didn't hear us.  We mentioned again that we would actually like to take them to go, and he just dropped off a box and left. The least he could have done was take the beignets and made them ready to go for us. I mean, everything he did-- He did with attitude. Not sure where it was coming from. To the server, I get you might not like working in service, neither do I-- But please, at least try to pretend to be pleasant.As for the food... The biscuits were fantastic, savory and delicious. As other said before me, there was not enough pimento spread for the biscuits. Other than the biscuits, the beignets were pretty good too. But everything else was alright. The Mac N' Cheese tasted like something out of a microwave-to-go TV dinner. No one at our table liked it. The portions for the tapas were hella small, but were pretty pricey considering how much food you were getting. No one from my table of four will be returning to this restaurant. We enjoyed the vibe, and the hostess, Ivona, was very friendly and knew how to do her job (and the server's job too for that matter).

I like my sandwiches to have a little more cohesiveness. The best sandwich I ever had here was the carrot - so delicious and peppery. I regret to inform everybody that because this menu changes rapidly with the seasons (which is awesome) it is no longer on the menu. Bummer.The chick pea fritter sandwich is always a solid lunch choice. I've had a seasonal mushroom sandwich there in the past and it was all grease - very disappointing, but the sandwich was around $12. I went there once long after lunch rush and ordered the peanut butter banana sandwich (one of the cheaper menu items). It took a reallyyyyy long time to make. Try the seasonal sodas!

The avacado was excellent and had just the right consistency after being heated in the deep fry process.  Unfortunately the chicken was not that great and had a really weird taste.  The spicy sauce is OK but as others have noted it is not that spicy or original.The blue bell shake also sounds good on paper but in the 100 degree Austin weather it seems they can't keep their ice cream cold because it comes out as a drink, not a shake.

I don't know if they go heavy on the salt with all their dishes because they're meant to be shared? But everything we ordered seemed to be really salty. First we ordered the cured salmon which I know is supposed to be salty since it's cured but it would be nice if there was something to eat it with like bread or crackers. Next thing was the warm kale salad which was probably one of the better things that we ordered. It was good but again, a little heavy with the salt and I personally thought the vinaigrette was too strong. We also ordered the oriechette which was the saltiest out of all of them. The waitress actually sent it back and gave us a new one with supposedly no salt added but we found it tasted the same. (She also seemed a little offended when I said it still tasted salty and made a face). And lastly, we had the mussels which had a good broth but again, too crazy with the salt. \\nI found each dish had 1 ingredient that was too overpowering as well which didn't help when it was already very salty.Maybe I'm just being too picky but even my girlfriend who usually eats heavier flavoured foods thought it was too salty.

The venue was exceptional and made for a great and memorable event. We highly recommend Serafina for the reasons outlined below: 1. The venue is elegant by design and features a white/cream color scheme with accents - thus the venue is appropriately suited for a wedding-related event. The d√©cor complements the aesthetic and lends a modern, chic, and sophisticated air.  2. The restaurant is located in the heart of the City of Boston, thereby permitting our event to prominently feature the beauty of this city. For example, prior to the reception, our guests were transported through the city, by trolley, from our ceremony site located not too far away. And, after the ceremony, we were able to walk through the city for a late-night round of drinks (after 1am) with our friends at another favorite restaurant.3. There are a number of great restaurants in Boston that we were considering; however, the professionalism and approachability of Elizabeth Flink (Liz), the private events coordinator at Serafina, allowed this restaurant to stand apart from the rest.My wife and I are exceptionally busy with work and it was important that we be able to host a great party that required minimal organization/planning on our behalf. From the outset, Liz gave us confidence that she could handle the planning/execution of the event and she delivered. Effort was minimal on our part as we only had to choose the menu we desired, provide a seating chart for our guests, and provide a rough schedule for the night (ie: cocktail hour, dinner, cake-cutting, dancing). She worked with our vendors (DJ, uplights, cake) to ensure the venue was ready for when we arrived. She also worked with our parents who made specific requests for the night. She gladly accommodated large portraits of my wife and myself to accent the venue during the event. And she ensured that the bar-staff could prepare and serve specialty cocktails, named after my wife and I, for our guests, in addition to the cocktail menu (which featured a quote chosen by us!) And importantly, through the planning process, she was extraordinarily responsive to emails/phone (with a remarkable response times). As my wife and I arrived at Serafina, with our friends and family, on the day of the event - we had the luxury of being able to enjoy our company as opposed to being worried about event planning and organization. For the reasons above, and perhaps others that we have forgotten to include here, Serafina proved to be an exceptional choice for our wedding reception and made for a spirited, energetic, and memorable event that was a ton of fun!"},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great trailer grub!

The highlight of the meal, though, was the beautiful brussel sprouts that came with it, and a nice mashed potato. My boyfriend's food was nursing home all the way.

What I can say is that Hei La Moon is very similar in quality to old-line Chinatown restaurants in New York, like Hop Shing and Delight 28 in the old core of New York's Chinatown. Everything is done in the old way which are thicker skins, thicker cheong fun, lot's of black beans in the chicken feet, heavy sauces, and just generally larger everything. This is not a negative but I see as an affirmation that old-style dim sum restaurants can survive into the 2000's.Hei La Moon is conveniently located just steps away from the T and from Boston's South Station. The dining room is large and cavernous with plenty of round tables but a few smaller tables for small parties.  Service is pretty good and some dim sum cart ladies even speak English!

Nice Hostess, neutral wait staff and better than usual bartenders. The food is hit or miss. The homemade Veggie burger is amazing (although it bothers me that with it you get a small handful of lettuce and an even smaller handful of french fries, give me one or the other for goodness sake). Burgers are ehh, appetizers are overpriced (esp. the middle eastern platter and anything dip-like) and I have never had a soup there that was any better than what I could have gotten from a can. \\nThe last straw was of late when a friend and I went over to Christopher's for dinner and drinks. I have never sat in the upstairs section of the place before and hope to never again. Our waiter, while initially pretty friendly quickly began rushing us. We drank one drink while waiting for our food and started eating our dinner. The waiter kept trying to take my plate away and we asked for another drink while I tried to finish my food faster than my digestive system would allow. I let him take it after shoving my face and he quickly threw the bill on our table, was I finished ordering? No, not really. We got about halfway through our second drink when he came back and asked if the bill was all set. Trying to have a nice time with my friend I had been chatting and laughing I had not even looked at the bill yet, but did quickly. I paid the bill and tipped 18% (I work in food service and it sucks). Not two seconds after I signed the receipt we were abruptly told we had to leave. \\"If you just want to drink you can go to the bar, we need this table now for a party of 12\\"So many problems with this. Why are you seating people upstairs when you have previous reservations in 25 minutes? Why couldn't you have mentioned that in the beginning, offering us an option to go elsewhere and not have to choke down dinner? We would have waited for a downstairs table, WE were not in a rush.

But it's also a perfect illustration of supply and demand, and before heading there, you should be familiar with what it will take to grab some of their food.The supply is superb. Franklin, or Franklin's, as everyone seems to call it, has a small menu that concentrates on the basics: brisket, ribs, pork, and sausage. A 2 meat plate is $9.75, and a sandwich is $5 or a few quarters more, depending on what's in it. They charge 35 cents for jalapenos, which is lame but not a big deal. They've got the typical sides of potato salad, cole slaw, and beans, plus pickles, onions, and of course the requisite terrible bland white Wonderbread, a barbaric custom which has inexplicably survived to the modern civilized era. If there's a good reason why we still blindly eat some of the best meat you can buy wrapped in what tastes like a mixture of cotton swabs and dryer lint, I've never heard it.Anyway, the barbecue itself is well worth the trip, and competes well with any other barbecue place in Austin or in the surrounding BBQ cities like Lockhart or Elgin - you can of course argue indefinitely over your absolute #1 favorite place, but Franklin is undeniably excellent. The sausage is of the thick casing variety, but is really juicy and deliciously spiced once you've gotten through. The brisket is heartbreakingly tender (and can be gotten lean in case you want to pretend that you're eating BBQ for your health), the ribs have the requisite \\"meat falling off the bone\\" quality, and the pork is unimpeachable. On any kind of Personal BBQ Rating System all of their meats would have to score extremely highly. I'm not a fan of all of their sauces (some are too vinegary, etc), but some of them are quite good, and after you try them you get to play the fun game of deciding whether to enjoy the meat on its own, or just pouring lakes of sauce to drown the stuff in.The only problem is the demand. Franklin BBQ is both compulsively edible and surprisingly cheap, so that means demand is high. Now, as any self-respecting BBQ place should, it closes not at a specific time, but whenever they've run out of meat; this means that in order to be served right when they open at 11am, you've got to park yourself outside their front door several hours beforehand and wait in a shockingly long queue that reminds you of a 70s-era gas station, a Soviet bread line, or some other relic of the era of price controls. Bring a good book! Franklin is centrally located a few blocks up the street from I35 on E 11th street, in a neighborhood that's quickly being gentrified, but there will still be plenty of drunk homeless dudes wandering around inexplicably drunk at 9am on a Saturday morning. Depending on your point of view, this is either Austin being Kept Weird, or just a pack of bums.When demand for a product outstrips the supply and the price doesn't rise, other ways to allocate the product will emerge. In Franklin BBQ's case, you will pay for your awesome BBQ in the medium of time. I've heard of people being able to walk right in at about 1pm on some days without trouble, but I've also heard of people getting there at 11:30 and having to wait for hours, only to be told there's no more left. In theory, this means that Franklin should raise their prices to weed out the people who aren't truly gung-ho about their brisket sandwiches, until supply and demand are in equilibrium once more and wait times are measured in minutes instead of hours. I actually hope they don't do this, because I think good food + cheap prices = a sweet deal, and I'm willing to deputize a friend to go stand in line and bring me something. Consider doing this unless you have lots of free time, but either way, you should definitely check this place out, since if you had to take an out-of-town visitor somewhere for \\"good Austin BBQ\\", this would be the place. Now I'm hungry again."},{"name":"D√∂ner Kebab","address":"515 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I reluctantly tried one of the doner kebabs, bragged about by a friend of mine who works there.

Example 1: my elderly mother asked if she could use the restroom, the woman coldly hesitated and then begrudgingly said, \\"this way.\\" Example 2: asked the woman what would be a good drink for my kids. She provided a hurried answer. I took her advice and ordered the banana chocolate drink. The guy who made the drinks for us then later told me \\"these drinks aren't for kids, they're not sweet.\\" I mentioned that the woman had recommended these fort kids and he just stared blankly at me and gave me the bill to pay. Sure enough both kids hated their drinks (dark bitter chocolate) and I still had to suck up the bill.

I guess the experience matched the setting. Cool indoor/outdoor location with a dope outside fire pit. Snagged a cozy L shaped booth. Greeted promptly. I was leaning towards the philly but instead went with a burger of month which was a patty melt. Ordered it medium rare and waitress looked at me crazy. I repeated medium rare. I went with the sweet potato mash with praline butter as a side. Ordered the cocoa cinnamon drafty kilt Monday Night draft beer. It was super good. Anyway, food hits.... The patty melt was definitely closer to a medium well, lucky for them I was on lunch break and didn't bother to have it recooked. The actual patty itself was heavily overseasoned with not much else to offer... Texture was too chewy, I'm assuming due to the temperature mistake. I love patty melts and I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The sweet potato mash was meh.... Not enough butter for me, maybe I'm just fat lol.

I would give it 5 stars, which explains my overall rating. However, the biscuits and gravy were an inedible mess with no flavor, despite being full of salt and grease. Biscuits should be small, light, and tender. I am not certain what I was served, but it was not a biscuit. It was an enormous, heavy wad of flavorless yellow something (cardboard?), which arrived at table smothered in gravy. (Note: Gravy is not soup; NO ONE needs a whole plate of it. Come on!) Cream gravy should be light in color and texture, savory with pan drippings (preferably bacon), peppery (black pepper), and served in small quantities, like a condiment. This concoction was heavy, gray, lumpy, too salty, and overflowing the plate. I ate the chicken happily and left the rest.

The meat had no flavor and the sauerkraut was disgustingly bland. Not only did I not get what I ordered, when I did get it, it was horrible. Not only was it not as good as what I can make myself, it was much, much worse.

I walked in and a lady ushered me to the counter where a lady broke down the menu - every sandwich comes with meat. I'm not personally abhorrent of meat, but a couple vegan/vegetarian staples on their 10 sandwich menu would be business savvy for them, and for us, given that Portlanders notoriously swing both ways...You're able to customize your sandwich into a saladwich if you'd like, though. Lack of delicious veggie special #'s knocked a 1/2 star off...also note: their sandwiches are ALL toasted. If you're a freak who enjoys cold subs with unmelted cheese, you'll have to ask them if they'll accommodate your prissy preferences - I certainly didn't ask them. On to the sandwich...Delicious. Scrumptious flavor (chicken, cherry bomb peppers, lettuce, provolone, tomatoes, pickles) and toasted warm texture - everything tasted fresh, fresh enough to out-freshen Subway. However, the chicken was diced to dice sized bites, and a few cascaded out of my sub when I removed the staple toothpick to dive in. Use slices, Fire Friends. Even the cohesive cheesy goodness can't hold together the 1/4 lb of meat on a medium sub. P.s. Their Sauce Bar selection is outrageously numbered: approx 25 varieties.

They had an espresso sauce, a vinegar sauce, and a spicy sauce, but they weren't even needed, though they were delicious too! It was served with coleslaw, bread, and pickles. It was .75 pounds of meat, so I was glad I was driniking a beer with the meal to make me more hungry. The only bad part was the bland potato salad, so I'd recommend getting the beans instead.

Then I learned they kind of have that Chipotle-esque mission with food: no high fructose corn syrup (back in 2008!), no trans fat, and a number of organic items. They do have a lot farther to go from what I've read...they claim no MSG but I found ingredient lists of stuff that is pretty much MSG with a different name. And there's a lot of other weird stuff. Like propylene glycol in baked goods. But at least there's no HFCS I guess.Whatever I'm gonna die eventually. My problem has always been the options that involve chicken weren't really to my tastes, I don't like turkey or ham so a lot of times sandwich options can be pretty meh. I've also never thought to ask hey, could that be made with chicken instead? How novel. I think it'd probably be possible through the build your own sandwich option but I'm lazy.I've only gotten food to-go from here. My latest visit today I thought about eating there just to be somewhere that wasn't home or work for a change, but it felt so dim I didn't want to. My go-to to-go (hurr hurr) order is to do the manager's special half sandwich, half soup. I like to get the beefeater, which is their take on a French dip, with a cup of chili. This is $8 and is actually enough for two meals, easily. But today I ate it all because I haven't felt good...so I should say it's also my go-to finally eating again meal because it tastes so good I can do that. Since Jason's is based in Texas, I guess you can say they've got that Texas chili thing going on, there are no beans in their chili since that's sacrilege. It's mainly just finely ground beef and tomato and peppers. It's got just the right amount of kick that if you have a cold it might get your nose running a bit. They put cheddar and red onion on here normally but I just get a little cheddar on mine. With this meal you also get a bag of chips. It's a bit overkill. The best part of the manager's special if you like chili is that even though normally a cup of chili is $1 more than the other soups, there's no upcharge here. And it sort of works out to really be roughly the cost of half a sandwich and the cup of soup, something I don't feel like happens at Panera and always makes me leave out the soup. Plus the half sandwich is still HUGE. When I opened the container, it was like an open faced sandwich so full of meat. The full sandwich says it has half a pound of meat, but that definitely felt like more than a quarter!Their potatoes aren't bad too, those definitely also fall under the two meal category.

The owner came out to hug me and said \\"I'm so happy to see you again.\\" I didn't even think he'd remember me and was so happy he did. The flavorful food and the welcoming, friendly personality of the owner is why this place needs 5 stars, I would give 10 stars if I could. My friend loved the samosas too.

Every time we go to the Sweet Auburn Market (which is pretty often), I have it in my head to queue up at Arepa Mia and get an arepa. They're good, they're simultaneously exotic and familiar, and they're pretty filling. Besides, being gluten-free, it's one of the few places I can get to-go food for the wife.But more often or not, I end up at Yum Diggity. As first it was because the line at Arepa Mia was huge. Then, after the third or fourth visit, I realized that I'm equally splitting my time between the two places. Huh.The dogs are tasty and seemingly much larger than your standard dog. I say \\"seemingly\\" because one order seems to always do the trick, whereas I can eat two or three of, say, a Barker's dog or those from QT. (Hey, I never said I was a gourmand.) This makes the inevitable $8+ lunch a bit easier to take. Whenever I go, there's usually not much of a line or a wait and the dude at the counter is friendly as hell. And he somehow remembers my name even though I only told it to him once like 6 months ago. Are fat, loud, hot dog eating Filipino guys that rare? C'mon, go to my parents' house at Christmas and you'll find a whole living room of them.My only gripe is that they don't have the red hots any more. Those things ruled.

We arrived around 2 pm and it was fairly busy not surprising given that it was a holiday weekend. However, the restaurant only had 1 waitress and 1 hostess. Consequently, the service was terrible!  We ordered our food and got our sodas and milkshake quickly but it took forever to get anything else. We had to ask 3 times for water and an extra glass to split a milkshake for the kids.It was a rough start but my husband and I were hoping the food would make up for it. Nada. We had looked online at the menu so we knew ahead what we wanted but when we looked at the menu given to us noticed there were quite a few discrepancies. We had to ask the waitress if those items we saw online were available. My husband and I both got burgers while the kids got chicken nuggets (the regular ones aren't even listed on the menu! Only spicy nuggets are listed) and a 1/4 lb. hot dog (way too big for the average person let alone a toddler). The food left a lot to be desired. The burgers were dripping in grease and the fries and hot dog were just ok. The chicken nuggets were surprisingly good though. They tasted like fried chicken in a nugget form. I told my husband I thought we could have gotten better burgers at the Burger King that used to be down the street!Tasty Burger is in a converted gas station and tries for a cool, retro vibe. Supposedly the name comes from Samuel Jackson's character in Pulp Fiction talking about the \\"tasty burger\\" he was going to eat. Although it is tooted as being family friendly, we thought it could do better. The music was completely blaring and there was no kids menu (no biggie I can work around that). Overall, I'd give my experience a \\"C\\" and I won't bother coming back. Oh, and 2 burgers, a 1/4 lb. hot dog, 1 order of chicken nuggets, 2 sodas and 1 milkshake came out to $40. Next time I'll go to Five Guys instead!"},{"name":"Dead Lizard Brewing Company","address":"4507 SW 36th St, Ste C","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere to have a few drinks with your friends, great selection and my absolute favorite is the Raspberry if you want to try it better get there early they run out of that one quick lol will definitely come again, however I was a bit disappointed on the food aspect.

Hei La Moon has all the classics here: rice rolls, har gow, shumai, chicken feet, black bean short ribs, and much, much more. The staples here are all done well - though I have had a few mishaps with inconsistency here and there.As a general rule of thumb, I would avoid the \\"premium\\" items they try to pawn off on you as they are both expensive and more often than not cold - since they do not stay under the steamer as the other dishes and are not made as frequently.

The shop is small and cozy with a few Japanese furniture decoration. It doesn't really make you feel like you are in a authentic ramen shop in Japan but nice nonetheless. When you walk in there will be a line to the door, how long depend on the day of the week. My advice go in the beginning of the week and get there at 7 then it will take around 20 mins to get your delicious noodle fix. The menu is pretty simple, there are four items from the noodle menu (all fours are good), and other small dishes that you can add on. In my opinion, save your stomach for the noodle. It Is very filling. Each ramen bowl offers different flavor and variety of ingredients, it really up to you atm, but you can't go wrong with any.

No parking out front, so you may have to walk 15 min., a 45 min. wait on a week night, a very loud, and noisy interior. To me the food is good, but not better than Sam's #1 on Lower Roswell , but they don't advertise, you walk in the door, and up to the counter on a week night, and your order comes out in under 10 min. So, for us to drive to Fox Bros. from Sandy Springs it has to be worth a 45 min. drive, 10 min. to park, and walk, and a 45 min. wait .\\n Sams also has better portions , which I believe Sams gives you almost 1/2 lb. of meat. Fox Bros. does have a few good fried sides. If you like BBQ try Sams , and Heirloom, and Heirloom has interesting sides , but tough parking.

Sat outside on the patio (this kind of weather must be cherished as long as possible) in the shade, away from business men in khakis and Tech students (I assume).  Anywho...I just wanted a light snack, a drink and a quiet place to enjoy this gorgeous streak of weather.  My waiter was nice enough; he wasn't too friendly or too aloof.  Originally, I wasn't blown away by their cocktail list (except I'm going to have to go back and try the Lavender Mojito), their wine list was lacking to say the list, so I'm filing this restaurant under my \\"beer\\" category, which, I guess should be obvious, given that it's 'Pint and Plate.'  Their menu is kind of small, but they're apps looked well, appetizing so I got the pretzels and this pumpkin beer.  I cannot remember the name of it, but I remember thinking it tasted like the smell of a halloween candle which apparently I enjoyed.  The pretzel was baked fresh and I devoured the chipotle mayo it came with so much that I got a couple of extra cups of the stuff to go.  I'm definitely going to go again, mostly for the beer (and the lavender mojito) and maybe for another hot, fresh-baked pretzel."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I ate here as part of a small corporate function. Service was attentive, albeit with a bit of nervous energy. I anticipate this was a function of our special circumstances and the overall newness. As for the food, overall it was creative, well-executed, and memorable. The pork belly was impeccable; the skin was perfectly, thickly crispy without being tough. The meat was tender and satisfyingly unctuous, with an appropriate layer of fat. The seared base of the meat was a welcome surprise. This sat atop \\"grits\\" which were somewhere between traditional grits and a corn puree. They were wonderfully creamy with concentrated corn flavor and al-dente bits of rehydrated corn. The kumquats were roasted/grilled and added a welcome brightness to the other components. The sauce was savory expressing depth of stock and a few notes of spice. Overall, it was the best pork belly I have had enjoyed. For dessert I had the smoked chocolate bread pudding. The scent of a campfire hit me as soon as it was presented. The pudding was hearty without being stodgy. The smoke flavor was very pronounced, which I didn't mind, but could easily be too much for some. The salt ice cream, though, was incidental against the bold flavors of the bread pudding, notable only for its contrast in temperature.There were many other things on the menu that I plan to go back and try soon.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"[TLDR: Rude, inattentive servers. Painfully slow service. Overpriced, mediocre food. Only positive is the ambiance, but half of the establishment is a showroom that you need not pay to explore.]No Mas is right down the street from our loft and I've been about a half dozen times. Each time I've left unimpressed by both the food and especially the service, but neglected to write a review because I WANT to like this place so badly. After today's experience I could barely wait to get home and vent to Yelp.My husband and I went for a late lunch today with another couple. As soon as we sat down, we informed the server that we would need two separate checks, one for each couple. This is the point at which things got dicey. Apparently No Mas is unsuccessfully implementing a two server per table program, so one would think we'd never be left wanting. One server took our drink orders, ten minutes later the other server showed up (still no drinks) and asked for our lunch order. I informed her that we were still waiting on our drink order and needed menus in order to choose our lunches. She gave me this exasperated \\"how am I supposed to know, the other server took your drink order\\" look/hand gesture then left the table. It is clear that these servers don't communicate at all, don't help each other follow through and have no trouble throwing each other under the bus in order to avoid accepting responsibility.It took a total of 20 minutes to receive our first drinks, which could have been explained by a busy bar - had we not all ordered water or soda and had the restaurant not been nearly empty at 2:30pm (save for Jennifer Love Hewitt sitting at the table next to us.)The food came out relatively quickly and it was meh. I have never been particularly thrilled about their food. I tried the Ensalade con Pollo Asada this time. Everything was bland and soggy - I couldn't even eat the salad. The chicken was fatty, which is repulsive. Fortunately the salsa and queso are quite good, so I turned my attention to that instead, but four hungry people eating queso and salsa with one basket of chips meant we went through that basket relatively quickly. One of the servers asked if we would like another basket of chips to finish the large bowl of queso we ordered, but she never returned with one - lots of queso for which we paid extra went to waste - nor did she return with drink refills. By the way, their salsa has just enough kick to make it kind of miserable when you have an empty glass throughout your entire meal.Time lapsed from when we asked for our checks until the time she brought it out (all on one check, of course, despite telling her up front each couple was on a separate check) - 18 minutes. Between our one and only waters/soda and our check, we spent nearly 40 minutes just waiting. Our corrected tickets finally arrived with a 15% service charge tacked on (there were only 4 people at our table.) We tip 20% even with bad service, but since they took this liberty, you better believe I did not add an additional tip, except for these two cents:1) I understand the entire service staff was probably huddled in the back gossiping about J-Love eating at the restaurant, but it is NO reason to alienate locals who would otherwise give you repeat business.2) Never, NEVER let your customer go thirsty. Especially in a Mexican restaurant that serves mostly spicy food.We will be returning to No Mas no mas.(One star for location and decor, one star for the yummy queso we would really have loved to finish eating if we had chips! Certainly would have made waiting for so long more tolerable.)"},{"name":"Johnny Rivers' Grill & Market","address":"1 Jeff Fuqua Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"It's airport food, so it only gets an okay, because it is overpriced for what you get.

You may as well skip the mixed drinks and go straight to beer. Twice I've ordered Gin and Tonic.  And I get a really nice looking glass, but unfortunately I've yet to detect any actual Gin in these drinks.  And at $9 a pop that gets me a little bit peeved.   If  you're not going to put alcohol in then at least have the decency to charge 4 or 5 bucks. You're stealing twice with this move.  I'm so peeved in fact, that I'm dissing this place in passing in some of my other reviews.  Mess with my drink, will you? The food's not bad.  I often had the Monday special, Lasagne, which is tasty and quite filling.  The salad and bread sides are the usual fare. I recommend whatever it was that had fennel in it as a cut above. The service is a mixed bag.  It bears repeating: the young female bartender does not know how to make a mixed drink. Or possibly  Management has trained her to just wave the bottle in front of a glass (a very nice looking glass) filled with ice and tonic.  I see others here complimenting a female bartender.

Our waitress came over while he was there and asked what happened, he told her, and that was the end of it. NEITHER of them offered to comp anything OR EVEN GET HIM A NEW SALAD WITHOUT TRASH IN IT!!! I assumed that something would be taken off of the final check as both the manager and the waitress were aware of there being plastic in my father's food, but nope. I couldn't believe it.Also, when we were first seated, my parents each ordered a martini and the glasses came barely half full. They had obviously not been prepared at all as the bartender sent a side of olives and sliced lemons and the vodka wasn't even cold. It was like the bartender had just poured a shot in each martini glass and sent them out.The food all came out too quickly like they were rushing for us to leave. We weren't halfway through the salads when the steaks came. Only two came cooked as ordered and they were ordered according to the scale on their menu.The positives were we got seated right away, our waitress was very sweet and the food tasted fine."},{"name":"Porter Ale House & Gastropub","address":"3715 S 1st St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely love this place.

Franklin is the Mecca for brisket and there's a reason why - it's friggin incredible. But you'll need to come armed with some knowledge so you can maximize your time there. Here was how we did it on a Saturday in June w/nice weather. Got there at 6:50 AM - street parking was easy. The first guy in line got there at 4:30. The second guy at 5:15. There were about 30 people or so ahead of us. I think our arrival time was perfect (if not nearly too late) as it got us the last space under the pavilion which will afford you some much wanted shade. Chairs: yes they have some for you to borrow, but why leave it to chance? Bring your own. Me and my group of 2 dudes brought chairs, a large ice chest full of brew, a foldout camp table, Bluetooth speaker, dominoes, cards, mosquito spray and a football. Why so much stuff you ask? Because Franklin's in not just about eating great bbq, it's about having a great time \\"tailgating\\" in the parking lot with your friends - and the new friends that you will most certainly meet in line around you (we liked our neighbors so much we all ate lunch together once inside!). But I digress. Franklin's has their process down to a science. They told us around 9 AM that our spot in line would eat around 12:15 to 12:30. We were chowing down at 12:20. Bingo. If you find yourself short on beer, ice, mosquito spray or whatever, don't worry there's a CVS right around the corner from you that has your back. Beer sales start at 9 AM on a Saturday - the wait staff will also go through the line with a nice selection of canned brews. The staff also makes the rounds taking down your orders so they know how much meat will be left as they get to the back of the line. You place your actual order once inside at the counter, but the \\"pre-orders\\" give them a good idea when to cut off the line. Bathrooms - there's port-o-potties on site before 8 AM, then you can use the restaurant's bathrooms after. At about 10:45 they get you ready to come inside. This is when you break down all of the crap you set up 4 hours prior and throw it in the back of your car. We condensed our giant Yeti down to a portable roller ice chest for the rest of the wait which you will now be standing instead of sitting as you slowly move along. It's very important that you don't bail on your beer after they start letting everyone in, because you still are going to have awhile before you eat (unless you're closer to the front). Like I said, our spot at the end of the pavilion still had another hour + in line once it goes into a more mobile formation.Once you make it into the restaurant you'll have about 30 minutes left until you're eating all of that goodness. Don't worry about finding a table, by the time they give you your food people are getting up that ate before you. The space is small and there's some tables outside, but somehow everything seems to be timed perfectly. I guess after you've waited 5 hours, you're not really wanting to sit and linger after you finish eating.Lastly - the bbq. There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said before. I'm from Texas and I've eaten a ton of bbq. This is the best I've ever had. It really is that incredible. And for anyone who says otherwise, they truly have no idea what they're talking about. The spice on the brisket is on point. It's moist and perfect in every way. The beef rib is huge and not overly \\"stewy\\" like Louie Mueller (sorry Mueller fans). The pork ribs are fall-off-the bone and seasoned w/sweet and spice. I didn't think you could beat Salt Lick's, but yes, the pork ribs here are nails too.All together, we had a blast here. From the staff to the customers to the food - a 5 star great time and one my buddies and I will be making an annual trip out of.

My wife's mind was wandering about if they served her food with trash in, what else could be in it and lost her appetite. It was taken away and removed from the bill. The prime rib was less than luke warm when served and cold halfway through eating it. Half of the lettuce in the Cesar salad was wilted. Not a good performance.

And if they sell out of something, too bad. So if you want to dodge the line and not get up at 5am, they offer a digital pre-order option on their website. The catch its a 5lbs minimum. Our crew opted out of that but ultimately did decide to stand in line which took us about 2 hrs.  Props for them here because they are considerate of their line. They had an employee come out and notify us if something sold out, gave us an estimate of how long the wait is, and offer umbrellas to use while you're in line as some of the line can go out of the cover, and finally will sell beer to you while you wait (or you can BYOB, they specify it's fine).Now the food: this was the best brisket I've ever had. Would go back, would stand in line again, would do it all. It was that good. Perfectly moist, tender, full of flavor, mmmm makes my mouth water just thinking about it. We also had the pork ribs which were falling off the bone. My group loved them but they weren't as good as rudy's imo. They served their bbq with white bread which I appreciated over the butter crust bread. The bbq here is also really good. Just enough kick but enhances the flavor of the meat. The slaw was ok but let's be honest, you aren't here for the sides. The bourbon banana pie was pretty good though. Crust was crisp just the way I like it. TLDR: do it.

Ya not a huge deal, except that another party of the same size that came in after us was seated before us. And then it took nearly another 1/2 hour to place our order. After that the service was pretty good, both coffee and water were never allowed to empty. The coffee was pretty watery though, overpowered by the slightest touch of cream.Now the food: the appetizers were delicious! We had the chimichangas abd something with plaintain in it (can't remember what...) and they were both fabulous, as were the dips that came with the cornbread. However, when it came to our main dishes, they were almost cold when they got to us, and everyone agreed that they were lacking something. The full, savory pizazz of southwestern cuisine seems to have been lost in its fusion with breakfast. Nothing particularly bad, just nothing spectacular. And one little thing, rice is a boring side, especially plain, unseasoned, unbuttered white rice like that which accompanied my breakfast burrito. A salad would've been better.

Meat a tad fatty but that is just my preference of less fatty cha sui. 69 roll, good.  \\nEnvironment-small little restaurant-can fill up quickly. Parking avail in front or side streets.

So, when the Soul Fire Groupon coupon offer showed up, I immediately went for it. And there it was, sitting in my car when my BF & I drove over in his car the other night. Oh well, let's try it anyway...\\nWe bellied up to the bar and ordered two Lone Stars and two brisket sandwiches. Oh, what mouth-watering goodness..that was one of the tastiest, yummiest brisket sandwiches I've had the pleasure of knowing! Sweet and tender slabs of perfectly cooked, just fatty-enough brisket.\\nSo, I lobby for another trip down to Soul Fire a few nights later. With the coupon in hand this time, I'm totally psyched for round two BBQ! BF got crabby about the lack of parking, but luck smiled on us and we nabbed a spot around the corner - yay!!\\nAs we were trying to decide what tasty morsels to order this time, the manager strolled over to give us some help. We had almost chosen the sampler platter which he told us would be far too much food for the two of us and suggested some other options. Good call, Jason! Thanks!! \\nI decided on baby back ribs and again, Jason suggested the collard green as a side. I was hesitant as I'm not usually a fan of  bitter greens. He assured me I'd like them...and he was right again. They had none of the usual bitter flavor, just tender, sweet and delicious. The ribs were awesome, tasty tenderness on a bone.\\nBF had the burnt ends, ribs, mac & cheese and collard greens. All of which ranked high on the taste-o-meter!\\nThis place knows BBQ.

Only a $50 deposit was required, and we paid the rest the night we were there.When we got to Superplay, we got everything that Mike promised we would in our discussion. For a group of about 20 adults and youth, we got three pizzas and bottomless beverages for an hour, and unlimited laser tag games for two hours. They even have a hummus pizza option for vegans. We were treated with great respect. I am so pleased with the customer service and Mike is just as awesome in person as he is over the phone.The laser tag games were super fun -- many different game options to choose from. Instructions were clear, staff were relaxed but maintained order and rules, and equipment were quality.I am sure I made the best decision booking our event at Superplay.

Dolsot means \\"stone pot,\\" and that's what it's served in, still incredibly hot.The service is generally at least polite and efficient, and while it could be friendlier, that's of more debatable necessity than the first two traits. The ambience is casual, it's quiet enough to talk but not so quiet you feel uncomfortable, and you can pay with a card if your purchase is over $4.The kimchi is delicious and made in-house, last I checked, and while it strikes me as a bit pricey for the amount you get, I don't know how this compares to other places.And now for some unsolicited advice:1) use both chopsticks and a spoon, preferably of the metal set they have in the back near condiments\\n2) appreciate the composition of the colorful elements on top just long enough for your rice to crisp (less than a minute)\\n3) smother it in gochuchang (served in a metal bowl on the side)\\n4) unceremoniously but thoroughly stir it with a spoon so your rice doesn't outright burn\\n5) have ice water on hand in case you're overzealous about those first (likely hotter-than-100 degree) bites\\n6) accept defeat if you're unable to finish, remember your own tupperware next time, get your own gochuchang from Paldo Market, and fry another egg for yourself when you eat them later."},{"name":"Arby's","address":"4484 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2","text":"Hello fellow restaurateurs.

The sandwich itself consists of fried turkey breast, pepper bacon, Swiss cheese, cranberry sauce, spicy brown honey mustard sauce, tomatoes and lettuce.

The shrimp and scallop ceviche was amazing - very nice portion of fresh seafood that isn't overpowered by citrus. The curried lamb roti may have been the highlight of the night though. Absolutely wonderful, unique, well-prepared, perfectly blended, delicious!!! Messy and worth it. We also ordered the cubano medianoche sandwich.

We had heard good things from friends and decided to come for a relatively lighter dinner. We ended up way fuller than expected. We ordered 2 baos (the YVR and the Big Bang) and a small portion of Kimchi Fries. I had the YVR, which has seared albacore tuna and an overwhelming amount of greens on top. I couldn't get a bite without pulling half the contents of the bao with me. Delicious though! Don't expect to be able to be a delicate eater here. The bao was nicely steamed and sweet the way I liked, and the tuna was tender and well-flavored. My boyfriend ordered the Big Bang, and the pork belly was delicious. I only got a small bite, but it was as yummy as it looked. Both baos were a little smaller than what we expected, but what made up for it was the Kimchi Fries. We ordered a small for $5 and definitely way bigger than expected. Can't imagine what the large looks like. We went on the recommendation of precious Yelpers. Probably my new favourite loaded fries dish, the kimchi fries had pieces of pork belly (crispy and delicious!!) and was topped with bean sprouts, kimchi and green onions. It exceeded all expectations. We checked in on Yelp halfway and realized we could've gotten free bao beignets with our order, and the cashier was kind enough to still let us get them after the fact. They were topped with powdered sugar and coconut shavings. They were crispy, super sweet, and fluffy on the inside. Might not order them again necessarily, but for free? Hell yeah. Overall a pretty good experience, the only reason it's not a 5-star review is because the tables were still kind of dirty on a slower portion of a Saturday afternoon, and I saw the fattest fly on the west coast put on a big show during my meal. I get that comes with the territory when the door is always open and there's food involved but it definitely detracted from the experience. The seating is limited but if you want the quaint street food Gastown experience it's a nice place to be. TL;DR: get the kimchi fries, baos are smallish, it's cramped but cute."},{"name":"The Reef","address":"4172 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"**BEST JAMAICAN in da city!*** Main Street location I've been coming here for years and this place is consistently pumping out great food at very reasonable prices.

The meat was fine, but very dry. The creamy salad sauce that came with my dish was tasty. We got the chicken plate with salad, as well as a lamb?/pork? dish with salad.
