We got a Groupon to get $40 worth of food for $21 so I jumped on a chance to show this place to my fiance as she was wanting some Japanese cooking.  We called ahead and the person indicated we didn't need reservations to use the Groupon, to just come on in.  So the next day we came in on a Saturday afternoon for a lunch/dinner.  Ok, a dinner, we slept in ;) but it was OUR lunch.\\n\\nWe arrived and were immediately warmly greeted and seated.  My fiance was really in love with just how beautiful the interior of the restaurant was...it was very intimate and cozy.  Now because I had the Groupon deal and felt like treating myself I ordered the filet and the added 3 shrimp which, if memory serves, was $25-27.  My fiance ordered the filet and chicken for about the same.  I chose to splurge the extra $2.99 for fried rice but my fiance just went with the white rice.  We both ordered extra of the egg yolk sauce which was another $1 or $2 but so worth it!! \\n\\nOur chef came out and did just about every trick in the book to entertain us, despite the fact there was only 4 of us, my fiance and I and another older couple.  I even saw a few I hadn't seen at other Japanese steakhouses so that was pretty cool. I got my fried rice and it was fantastic, ate about half of it while he was cooking the other stuff.  \\n\\nMy steak came next and was cooked perfectly medium-rare.  My shrimp were medium sized and delicious with the egg yolk sauce.  The chef also asked us a couple of times if we needed extra sauce which I hadn't seen before and thought was a nice touch.  The veggies were squash, carrots, mushrooms, etc and were all cooked perfectly and delicious but I have to say I miss the bean sprouts that the House of Japan on Polaris uses.  I asked the server about the bean sprouts and she said they were not available and hadn't been on the menu in a long time.  During the course of the dinner we received constant refills.  \\n\\nOur chef was wonderful and our friendly server came and gave us and hten took our checks right away so we wouldn't have to wait forever like at some places (naming names) but on the flip side we didn't feel any pressure at all to leave early.  It was just plain good service.  \\n\\nIf I could I'd give this place 4 1/2 stars due to the bean sprouts issue but I guess that's pretty minor overall.  The only other minor issue (or major for some, LOL) is this place isn't cheap for dinner..lunch is much better but even with the Groupon we spent nearly $40.  Of course we DID both eat steak and I also had lobster, LOL, so that's not bad overall considering.  \\n\\nThis is certainly my favorite place to go when I'm looking for a Japanese steakhouse!!

We arrived around 1:00pm on Saturday and waited about 30 minutes for a table. I decided to try one of their gin beertails (negHOPni: gin, troegs hopback, sweet vermouth, served in a rocks glass) and was very happy with my decision. For food, I got the spicy tuna burger. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't bright pink/red in the middle (grey all the way through), but it still tasted good. Either the spicy-ness built up over time, or was not evenly distributed because I didn't notice anything until the last few bites. Another small thing was that the chips I got with the sandwich were mostly crumbs. It seemed like I got the bottom of the bag. My gf got the Regal Regis, which came out looking like a cheese steak. I thought it was good, but preferred my burger.

Their eggrolls are decent they have a good meat ratio.  The bf gets the vermicelli bowl with eggroll and pork and seems pleased.  I've tried his and their inconsistent with the texture of vermicelli, sometimes it seems a little old and dry.  This usually can be remedied with extra fish sauce, but thats asking a lot from a sauce.  I've tried their pho and their egg noodles.  Their pho is not bad it hits the spot when you have the craving, but their broth maybe inferior to some of their competitors.  I tend to over-lime and over-hoisin my pho but that's personal preference.  Their egg noodles are very bland, no sauce can save this dish.  I usually tough it out and attempt to finish food until I meet foods like their egg noodles that I wave my white flag in bland defeat.\\n\\nThe service here is pretty bad even for a vietnamese joint.  Usually the ordering of drinks and food go well and the food arrives pretty quickly, but thats the end of your service unless you're going to the register and paying.

One time I wanted more lime and had to approach a table that our waitress was sitting at with her head down, heads up 7 up style.

The sandwiches are good, but they're generally quite not the same quality as eating at their source restaurants. Nor are they even the same style: the Lumiere, for example, is basically a pulled pork sandwich with green papaya salad (more southeast asian than anything).

It's been on my to do list since moving to Atlanta, but I just kept getting sidetracked. I came in with high expectations and FLIP did a great job living up to them. My one complaint is that the restaurant is way too dark inside and it's difficult to see the food. Luckily, we were seated at the bar in the back near the kitchen, and there was more lighting. The music is also pounding loud, and it's difficult to have a conversation. If it weren't for their great taste in music (CSS, so impressed!), I might have been annoyed. \\n\\nThere were so many great choices on the menu, but I opted for the Steak Tartare burger because I felt that it was the most adventurous while still being true to a \\"burger.\\" The burger had steak tartare, a 6 minute egg, capers, cornichons, frisee, and mayo. The whole thing blended together so nicely with the egg gushing over the steak tartare and the flavor of the capers really shining through. The bun is also one of the best burger buns I've ever had. Definitely worth a try if you're okay with eating raw beef. Because it is a tartare, there is no real \\"burger patty\\" so it was a little unwieldy, but it actually stayed inside the burger for the most part. I also feel the need to mention the price -- the burgers here are slightly higher priced than other burger joints around town and they are definitely smaller in size. \\n\\nI also tried the Turtle + Caramel Foam liquid nitrogen milkshake. This might be the best milkshake I've ever had in my life. The entire thing was so decadent and rich, it was everything a milkshake should be. My only disappointment was that the milkshake was barely smoking when it was brought to me. I had seen our server using the liquid nitrogen tank out of the corner of my eye, but the novelty of it is really overhyped. You're definitely not getting the same experience Richard Blais dazzles the Top Chef judges with.

A *white dinner roll* with sweet toppings. Yep. The dough was that bad. I tried several of their flavors -- creme brulee, blueberry basil, passionfruit poppy seed, original glazed, maple bacon -- looking for a winner. While all the toppings, frostings, and glazes were obviously great quality (hence the two stars as opposed to the one I was tempted to give), I just couldn't get over the dense heaviness of the dough. \\n\\nLooking through other reviews, the negative ones all seem to say the same thing -- that is, these guys need to work on their dough. One reviewer called Blue Star's dough a \\"means to an end\\", which describes it perfectly. That is, great toppings, but the dough is simply just a vehicle for them. That maybe your thing, but I argue donut's heart and soul rests in its dough.  Half the appeal of the donut is that light, airy, melt-in-your-mouth, fried goodness right? Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say, Blue Star's doesn't quite fit the bill. \\n\\nNot unless you're looking for donuts that taste like stale brioche/dinner rolls with sweet toppings.

Really?\\n\\nWell, then.  Let the reviewing commence.\\n\\nFirst, I must say, if you are expecting a fine dining German experience, you will be disappointed.  If you're expecting \\"authentic\\" instead of \\"kitschy,\\" you will be disappointed.  If you're grievously offended by waitresses in costume-y dresses and occasional accordion music, you will be disappointed.  Schmidt's is touristy as all hell.  It goes so far to \\"look authentic\\" that it becomes a caricature of Germany.\\n\\nI don't come here for the atmosphere.  I come for the sausage that they make in-house.  And the mashed potatoes and the German potato salad.  And the cabbage with corned beef.  And, when I'm lucky, meatloaf.\\n\\nPeople who have turned up their nose at the buffet probably did not look closely enough.  Yes, it has the standard salad bar with Jell-O or whatever.  Yeah, there's foodservice-grade macaroni and cheese.  But there's also a large selection of homemade sausage, spicy sausage stew, meatloaf, homemade mashed potatoes (far superior to that food service grade crap they serve at chain buffets), German potato salad--someone said their kraut is canned, but I've seen Schmidt's sauerkraut for sale in a pouch in the grocery store, so I believe that they at least use their own recipe, if not make it in-haus.  (See what I did there?)  Even taking out the lame salad bar, it's more than enough to justify hitting the buffet, and probably a few times.\\n\\nLove the creme puffs.  Pate a choux is not my favorite, but the filling is so delightful that I usually go for it anyway.\\n\\nAs far as the service goes, I've never had bad service at Schmidt's.  I imagine that those who had bad service were either there on an off night or they managed to get the worst server in the lot--it happens, sometimes.  (Update:  Visited on 10/24/10 and had good service then, too, despite the place being packed.  Also, if you go on a Sunday afternoon, even at 4 pm, expect a half-hour wait!)\\n\\nThe key to Schmidt's is to understand that the hype is not really your typical \\"foodie\\" hype.  It's not some forward-thinking little German bistro--it's largely pub food.  It's a place to go for some beer and some sausage, and bless them for that."},{"name":"Tassili's Raw Reality","address":"1059 Ralph D Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I unfortunately was not able to purchase anything to eat. 1.

The fries tasted like high-end frozen fries.  (Sysco anyone?) The mushrooms were the second worst I've had in Austin (Daily Grill, though, still has the worst in Austin.) with a heavy onion flavor.  We skipped desserts because nothing just cried out to us. A very pedestrian dessert menu, in fact.\\n\\nIMHO, Eddie V's is a slightly more upscale and refined answer to McCormick and Schmick's.

Since we were a family and not not part of the hip and sexy leftover happy hour crowd, I asked to be seated in one of the three EMPTY booths instead of the communal type table settings. I was advised that the booths were being reserved for parties of 6 or more. Well considering it was 8PM and all three booths were empty, surely an exception would be granted????? Not the case here. The cheerful greeter held firm to the 6 person minimum, and advised that if we had just 2 more people with us, we could be seated there. Upsetting, but not a deterent. I will say that this small incident set the tone for the rest of the evening, because NOW, everything done wrong or not to Texas standards would certainly be highlighted. \\n\\nHere comes the good part. Our waiter, while very nice, reminded me of one of those used car salesmen from the 70's that you see on tv with the plaid sports coat and polyester green pants. Not by his dress, but by the way he handled certain situations. One such situation was during his initial greeting. He came over, said hi, followed by \\"you know what, there should have been glasses of water on your table, let me go get that for you all\\", then he was gone for 10 minutes. Again, not a big issue, but there was no real personal service. \\n\\nSIL and I ordered the N2 Cucumber Martinis and they came out smoking, and were delicious.

At first glance the restaurant looked very small however there are table tops in the back that you can't see. Let me just say, the food and coffee is worth the wait.\\n\\nFor starters, I had the white chocolate pistachio rose water mocha and although I wasn't able to taste the pistachio, this does taste like a white chocolate mocha with a rose water after taste. It's interesting, but I am not head over heels for it. My friend ordered the lavender latte, which was delicious! I am always hesitant about lavender flavored foods as the lavender is always so over powering. Although on a separate occasion I ordered the lavender latter to go with soy milk, the lavender was a bit over powering... I wonder if it is because I ordered it with soy milk?\\n\\nI always order the waffles when I visit. Although it is pricey, $3.15 a waffle, $1 per topping, it is a good indulgence. The liege waffles were the best I've ever had! Not too dense, buttery, and sweet! I can eat the waffle all by itself without the toppings. However I have tried majority of the toppings. The toppings come in individual containers that you can dip your waffles into. I recommend the white chocolate pistachio (although I still can't taste the pistachio), the lavender milk chocolate (very delicious, lavender is not overpowering), and the raspberry caramel (although I wish I can drizzle this on instead of dipping it, it's too much when you dip it). \\n\\nFor the main course, I always get the fricassee, which is short ribs with two over easy eggs, watercress (I think), apples, among other things. It comes out in its own little cast iron pan (which is super cute). The short ribs are shredded and very flavorful, the apples gives this dish some crunch, and the watercress makes it fresh. The portion size is just right, not overwhelming, and this doesn't go through my system too fast, as in I don't get hungry an hour later.  \\n\\nOverall a must visit, I would come here every time I visit Vancouver if the wait wasn't over an hour long each time. It just seems like such a waste of time to spend 2+ hours just on brunch when on vacation..."},{"name":"Wilfs Restaurant & Bar","address":"800 NW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Food OK, nothing special.

The waitress seemed pleasant for sure, but she didn't give me what I asked for (albeit she WAS meaning to be courteous) I asked for an americano for my partner, to be met with a \\"no, let's wait for him\\"  well, he walked into the door within 30 seconds of her \\n\\"no\\" and we then had to wait a significant amount of time just to have her come around again to be asked yet again, for the americano. How on earth does a place with a full espresso bar not recognize the taste for filtered coffee is also another question, it's a known fact that americanos can be too acidic for black coffee drinkers. At the same time, we order our meal. \\n\\nThe menu was pretty good, it was laid out well, easy to read and full of new options that you can't find elsewhere locally, thumbs up for that adventurism. I saw the side bacon for $6.00 and noted the side bacon being eaten beside me at my very close quartered table and thought about how much I wanted that plate on my table too. By the time my bacon came, it was a SIGNIFICANTLY smaller portion than expected, it tasted good but honestly...3 stars good, nothing to brag about. Meanwhile my BF is now slowing down on his meal because my waffles are taking a bit longer than both of us thought-I would blame them being busy but they are always busy...so it's either the norm and they expect people to cut them slack for being busy or, they were missing staff. With 7 staff members up front though, I am genuinley surprised by the lack of service. Absolutely absent. Our waitress was good but there were too many tables and it hardly seemed like management was actually doing real work to help her out-clearning plates here and there, bringing out food here and there but where the heck were they to help out when our dishes were sitting empty on our table for 5+ minutes and we had to wait another 5 to ask for the cheque and another 5 to get the machine. Oh yeah, backs were turned to us towards the bar and attention to the people who were not yet being served outside. Here's a tip, if you want a tip, focus on the ones you are currently serving, not the ones who are waiting to be served. \\nTo the waitress, we could see she was busting ass and I can hardly blame her for the absence of presence-when you were around, you were pleasant. \\n\\n$32.00 later, we aren't going back. \\n\\nThere are way better places locally that never have lines and serve great food, the best suggestion I can give is for all you readers out there is to accept that this place is not in fact 5 stars. It is 4 on a great day if you really really REALLY dig the traditional moroccan food options for breakfast, but 3 stars on the regular at most is my best guess. I feel it's safe to guarantee that not many leave this cafe feeling special, individually cared for or told that they mattered-it is those traits make 5 star reviews and none of that was present here. \\n\\nTake the time you would take to wait in line here to stretch your legs by taking a walk a little deeper to the north-have fun finding the gems in this lovely hood I call home!"},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Some of the best food I've ever put in my mouth.

That was my first time in Chinese restaurant, and I was not familiar with a lot of things, and I did not like some food, but that is just my personal taste, because my friends really enjoyed the food did not like.  I am not big fan of sushi, but I sure loved theirs. I was so full, and could not finish my plate, but the waitress was understanding and did not give me a hard time. I tried desert, hot peach cake and ice cream - amazing, I took it 2 times. I think I am the biggest fun of that place, we even took ice cream to go. And it all for a bit over 10 $, you got to be kidding me.

Joanne Chang and her staff are amazing. All of the flavors balance so well together, and nothing is overwhelming or anywhere near bland. Each dish has a fiery kick to it that makes you want to drink their delicious cocktails even faster (try the scorpion bowl.....much more upscale than Hong Kong).  I have had the majority of the items on the menu and I have never been disappointed with anything (Dan Dan noodles are a must if you like peanuts, tgers tears are spicy and delicious, pork belly buns are indescribeable....I could go on and on). If its your first time, ask your server which dishes are small and which are more entree-esque. Even if you order way too much food, you must get dessert. Everything on the dessert menu is incredible (personal fav is the cocnut creme  pie with lime whipped cream.....YUM).\\n\\nIn short, this is the perfect restaurant for any occasion.

We (being my roomates) ordered in a list of stuff:  Pav Bhaji with Chicken, Chicken Soup, Aloo Paratha,  Pistachio Shake,  Naan,  Gosht Curry,  and Mango Lassi.  The delivery took about 15 minutes more than expected according to foodler, upon my phone call, the door literally rang.\\n\\nI open everything and lay it on the table, and realize that the Naan was missing and the Pav Bhaji with Chicken was just Pav Bhaji.  Now if I didn't pay extra just to put chicken, really wouldn't have cared, but since I did I was little frustrated about this.\\n\\nSo I called in to explain what happened.  The guy who picked up, although as good mannered as we was, kept repeating what I was saying, making it sound like I'm the one who's making the mistake here.  He also put me on hold for a few minutes before responding to my complaint.  He said in approx 30 minutes the Naan and the Pav Bhaji with Chicken will be delivered.\\n\\nLiterally 31 minutes later (good accuracy!) comes our correction.  The delivery man this time seemed to be in a chefs outfit, and apologized for the mistake.\\n\\nThey made a mistake, and they corrected it.  In my eyes, with the exception with the man on the phone, that is some quality customer service.  Not to mention the food was great, its a rarity in the Boston area to find a restaurant that serves Pav Bhaji (and with chicken it!), and with the exception of the chicken soup, everything tasted pretty good.  Chicken soup just needed more substance, all it seemed like they did was take chicken broth and add Maggi seasoning.  In my eyes, a chicken soup should be something tomato based and stronger amounts of spices.  The Lassi and Pistachio Shake was in question at first since it came in a sealed bottle (made us wonder if its just bought from someone else), but after drinking it there was no mistake that they made it themselves.  They probably just have a method of sealing the bottles.  I will venture to buying from this place again and giving all their options a shot.  I just also wished they deliver just a bit longer than 10 PM for those that eat late in the night."},{"name":"Bridges Cafe & Catering","address":"2716 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place gets four stars for the sassy (yet amazingly nice and fun) waitress, awesome breakfast burrito, and next door neighborly feel. \\n\\nI had no idea this place existed, and right across from the Nike outlet?!

They have a fairly wide selection of hand crafted beers.  I recommend that you at least sample the brew they call Sweet Heat as it is quite unusual.  The bar tender or waitress will be happy to let you sample a few beers before making your selection.  The Sweet Heat is not for everybody but it is worth sampling for it's unusual flavor palate.  It is brewed with apricots and scotch bonnets (a very spicy pepper with a Scoville rating of 100,000 - 350,000).  Apparently when brewing the Sweet Heat the employees wear hazmat suits as if they walked off the set of Breaking Bad.  The finished product is a sweet beer with a spicy finish.  Again this beer is not for everybody but it is at least worth sampling.  I found the food and service to be above average and would not hesitate to go back the next time I'm in Portland.  I found it refreshing that they make their own ketchup while still offering regular old Heinz.  The house made ketchup was a welcomed departure from the expected run of the mill ketchup flavor.

I have been here many times and I have had an excellent meal at this Ruth's Chris Lake Mary and every Ruth's Chris I've ever been too. Never had an order that was slightly under-cooked or over-cooked. Few chains can hang with this place for quality and consistency.\\n\\nOn my most recent meal at Ruth's Chris, I stopped by to try their happy hour burger. WOW! This has got to be the best burger for the money in Central Florida. If it isn't, than please someone suggest what is so I can go try that. I cannot believe this with a side of fries was $9! You can taste the quality. This was definitely made from Prime Steak trimmings as advertised. It was so tender, so juicy, and had a very unique flavor compared to your standard gourmet burger. There is so little chew to each bite that it truly can be described as \\"melts in your mouth\\" which is not a phrase I would typically use to reference a burger. The bun was soft, flaky and held it all together well. The fries were nice and crispy. Decent but not special. Nothing stood out about the cheddar but I could not get over how good that burger was for $9. This is in the running for best deal on a menu item you can order from a happy hour menu. I love this burger and I will be bumping Ruth's Chris up into the top tier of places to go for happy hour. I love to splurge at places of this level. I don't pass on ordering a steak at a Prime Steakhouse very often. This is a great example of why a steakhouse is somewhere you should stop when you're just in the mood for a burger. \\n\\nI've been here and to many other Ruth's Chris for a steak on several occasions. Every steak I have ever ordered has been cooked to perfection, along with the lamb chops which are outstanding too. This is a broiler steak. The 1800 degree heat always ensures it has a nice crust to it, but don't expect any of the smokiness you get from a grilled steak. They bring it to your table bathed in some sizzling butter which makes for such a great presentation. I have ordered the filet, and the Cowboy Ribeye on several occasions, and at this location I have ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye. All have been outstanding. They don't have any distinction about their steaks that make you know it is a Ruth's Chris steak, but it is always top quality with just the right amount of salt and seasoning. Every steak I've gotten from here was cooked just the way I requested. The Tomahawk Ribeye is not as good as the one you can get at Del Frisco's on I-drive, and maybe just slightly better than Charley's Tomahawk. It can't touch either on bang for the buck, but it is still a really really good steak!\\n\\nThis Ruth's Chris looks quite different than the others I've been too. You still have you dimly lit rooms, but this one has a lot more sunshine coming into it and modern decor with bright colors.  It reminds of some of the restaurants I've been too in Miami. They are all very nice touches and it keep this from looking like copy of a copy of another upscale steakhouse cliche. It is always clean, the staff is very attentive and friendly. Always a great dining experience. When I ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye the manager brought it to my table and carved it for me himself. Great food, Great service, Beautiful restaurant that reflects the quality and price tag.\\n\\nWe have so many GREAT steakhouses in Central Florida. This is not the greatest steakhouse in the Orlando area but it is a great one! We are spoiled by having 3 Ruth's Chris and this one is as good as any of the three. I will be back for many more meals and a deeper dive into this menu beyond steak. If you are here at happy hour, absolutely get the Prime Burger."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Took the Silver Line Bus to the lovely South End area and - a good omen - it stopped right in front of Myers & Chang.  The stylish place (self-described \\"funky indie\\") with the friendly and efficient  waiters offers a tempting array of reinterpreted Asian dishes (mostly Vietnamese and Chinese).  Mama Chang's pork dumplings were outstanding - a vibrant pork mixture in pan fried potstickers, but all the other dishes left something to be desired, mostly the spicing which was all but absent, even in the triple-starred (for heat) green papaya slaw.  This absence of spices made the \\"Tiger's Tears\\" grilled skirt steak salad dull despite the abundance of Thai basil and cilantro that came with the few slices of beef.  The dan dan noodles fared even worse, the dish again consisting mostly of the same fresh greens (basil, cilantro) - all very good to eat - but strangely lacking any spices or even a hint of peppery heat.  While the few slices of crispy pork belly bathed in sriacha aioli were as good as their description, they were lost in the gigantic, slightly charred bread roll that contained mostly mountainous amounts of carrot-daikon julienned carrots.  \\nThe place has some very interesting beers that go perfectly with the food and for dessert and coffee you can walk a couple of blocks down Washington Street (@ Rutland Street) to Ms. Chang's Flour Bakery and Cafe and enjoy great coffee with finely made pastries.

That's usually the first thing you are looking for in a Yelp review. I was skeptical because it's such a high volume eatery. It's your typical 4rivers cafeteria style. Get in line, order your entree, they ask for your order for sides, then you pay. Your check will typically be from 10-20 dollars depending on if your eating alone and eating like a normal American with \\"obese-weightness\\" or trying to be responsible with your diet. But honestly, you're here for calorie rich starchy artery clogging southern fixin's. They have family chicken dinners available, so plan according if you want chicken. \\n\\nI had the Chicken N' Dumplings, Mac & Cheese (same as 4rivers), the Cinnamon Bun Bread Pudding, and shared the Shrimp and Grits.  They have added tomatoes to the mix since the opening of the restaurant. (Not sure if that was for filler to keep costs low and profits high)  \\nMost of the staff seemed pretty blunt and short with you if they are working in the line. There is a forced courtesy, but I understand where they are coming from. This place is popular and a Mecca for those that are suffering from being \\"Hangry\\" \\n\\nUpon paying, you are optioned with a customer rewards membership. Very smart marketing.  You then find a seat and sit. Eclectic tables and are placed through the building as well as six or so 4rivers branded picnic tables that my party of 23 had moved around to create a large family style setup.  The \\"serving\\" staff was extremely helpful in accommodating us and extremely friendly. I would hope so seeing we brought in 300-500 dollars of gross. \\n\\nThe cons of the place is that you feel rushed. There should be a large format menu at the door so you don't feel rushed at the ticket maker. The menu is not small and concise whatsoever.  This place is making a killing so there is no reason whatsoever they use styrofoam cups. They have dishes for everything else. Offer cups or biodegradable plastic cups. We know how much money your companies are making Mr. Rivers. Do something ethically challenging.  It's still considerably busy and pricey for soul food. But white America is much more comfortable to a gentrified neighborhood than to a run down seedy side of town for better and cheaper soul food.  There is not traditional sit down service considering the price you pay for a plate. \\n\\nAll in all, this place is worth a visit, granted you don't have severe social anxiety.  The food is better than Cracker Barrel, the service better than Mc Donald's, the setting better than the existing ghetto.  I will come back. Hopefully there will be no more styrofoam cups."},{"name":"To Dine For Eatery","address":"333 Terminal Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I see the sign in the window every time I ride the Skytrain. \\"Best Burger in Town\\" it reads.

I approved.]\\n\\nTheir cocktail menu is extensive as well as the extent of their happy hour (11AM to 6PM - Yowzer)  and it's a nice local touch that many of their drinks have an exclusive-to-Austin name.  \\n\\nService staff was prompt and friendly. I had a one-hour time limit from sitting down to when I needed to leave. Our orders were taken promptly, specials were given to us, our waitress let us move tables so I could be near an outlet and our food came out quickly and perfectly. \\n\\nI'm not a sweets person so I haven't tried their desserts yet, but with the amount of time I plan to spend here, it'll come down to it.

The server told me that this particular omelette was normally cooked on the lighter side (meaning is would be a little a runny), and I told her to ask the chef to cook the omelette a little longer than he normally would, so it would be more solid. (*I thought it was nice that she told me before hand, how they normally cook the omelette, in case I wanted it firmer).

That is a shame to me because with chicken this exquisite it's just not appropriate to dip in to Hidden Valley out if a bottle.  Even if they just used the hidden valley packet to make it in-house it would be 10x better.  They do have honey as a dipping sauce option though, so it's not like ranch is the only choice.  I didn't try the honey mustard.  Maybe it's awesome.  Not sure.

The burger that I had appeared to have been gently cooked to a medium level - I'm not one to over cook the protein.  There is just something about getting that searing on a burger that makes it great and not just good. If you go to other first-class burger joints, not your mega-chains, you will notice that most burgers tend to have some angle in the actual preparation of the meet (high heat on a grill, flame, unique but not overpowering seasoning).  The use of eggs, sauces, etc. on a burger is a distraction in my opinion.  A burger is about a high-quality first rate bun, good ketchup, mayonnaise and mustard, fresh lettuce, thick robust tomatoes, dill pickles, onions and cheddar cheese.

That it's located in a Burnet Road strip mall is of absolutely no consequence. Before I even break down the excellence of the food let me just say this, economic down times aside, give yourselves the reward (if you're an Italian food junkie) of paying a visit. It's worth every penny.\\n\\nThe decor is quite conducive to romance. Mouth-watering Italian paintings line the walls. The formal dining room essence pervades the place. When in full on dessert mode I and my fellow diners were lucky enough to be treated to soothing guitar music. Curious yet? Great! Get set to be blown away!!\\n\\nFor a salad I selected the Insalata Innamorata. It consists of mixed greens, strawberries, corn, roasted almonds, and goat cheese, with a raspberry vinaigrette. The corn element delivered a sort of American Thanksgiving potluck vibe to the traditional Italian fare. Just a little variety to spice up this diner's life (insert groan provoked by weird attempt to use old adage here).\\n\\nMy main course was the Linguine Andiamo. It's made up of linguine, diced shrimp, cherry tomatoes, Portobello mushrooms, garlic, and olive oil. What a joy! Seeing as how garlic was one component of this dish I find it the perfect place to offer special mention for the baskets of garlic bread I was gifted with. Forget about Olive Garden or any other franchised version of this staple. As much as I'll gladly admit to liking Olive Garden food, their garlic bread isn't fit to occupy the same zip code as that of Andiamo's. From the texture to the look to the taste it's the real deal. Had to restrain myself from reaching for slice one of the second basket because I wanted to give my linguine ample attention first. It's HEAVENLY!!! If that was all I was fed I'd have gone away content and ready for more action!! I'm glad I received a second basket. It would have been criminal not to have been offered more. Anyway, the linguine dish was sensational also. Effective meshing of flavors. Being a tomato devotee I appreciated cherry tomatoes being woven in to the presentation. The shrimp provided a winning heft. The linguine itself proved suitably tender. The mushrooms I found to have just the right smoothness.\\n\\nWhat could make this meal a total standout? Dessert of course! My choice was a cannoli. Ladies and gentleman, that's how a four star meal advances to the five-star pinnacle!! Scrumptious cream filling married perfectly with flecks of chocolate chip. Beneath were artfully applied arcs of raspberry and chocolate sauces. They were so attractive to gaze at I didn't dare mess them up by dipping into them!!\\n\\nThe lone quibble (and not enough to cost it the perfect rating) was the fact that since I was essentially the first diner in the door for dinner the wait between drinking the water and getting a refill was a bit on the long side. However, my waiter informed me that they were getting set up  in the kitchen when I came (a bit after its 5:00 initial dinner hour) so I can let that slide. They were no doubt just trying to settle into the rhythm needed when the prime time hour kicked in. In addition, as one of many for whom a relaxed meal is the ultimate luxury, I appreciate not being hurried from one course to the next.\\n\\nWhether you're single, married, young, old, in love, out of love, or just a person with an urge to splurge. Andiamo's is a must-try winner!!"},{"name":"Steveston Village Vietnamese Restaurant","address":"120-12480 No 1 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for my very first time to this restaurant  and first time eating pho.it was great food, this will be a regular placei go for dinner or lunch anytime."},{"name":"A4 Pizza Bar","address":"445 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"The best pizza I've had in Boston.

The ingredients and plates are always made from the best available, seasonal ingredients and executed to perfection. They never use any ingredient that they just want to use. They use it because it's the best tasting it will be during the year. Because of this, their menu is always changing. One visit will always be different from the other, which means that you'll always get to try something different. \\n\\nWhile the other two major players in Austin, Uchi and Uchiko, tend to do best in raw plates (generally speaking), Barley Swine really excels with cooked meats. Even though I haven't loved every single dish I've ordered here, every piece of goat, lamb, scallop, pork, or whatever other animal you can think of has never been anything but cooked perfectly. I would recommend dishes, but really anything you get will be good. If you can't decide, ask your server. They are very helpful when making recommendations, and they'll usually know what people generally like. Also, if anyone from Barley Swine is reading this, PLEASE bring back the foie gras with strawberry ice cream and hoe cakes dessert this summer. That dessert was just incredible. \\n\\nOne drawback of its concept is that because the menu changes so much, the experience can be inconsistent. Now don't get me wrong, every single plate was as consistent as the next. What I mean is that the combinations of flavors may not be as good as a whole from plate to plate. By fluctuating, they still range from really, really good to mind blowingly good. Now this really is nitpicking, and I understand it's hard to hit it out of the park every single time, but at such a quality restaurant like Barley Swine, you really have to look hard to find any flaws. \\n\\nOverall, this really is one of the best restaurants in Austin. Barley Swine and Bryce Gilmore deserve all the praises/awards they get. Ever since their Odd Duck trailer, I've been rooting for these guys to succeed, and it looks like they have and are going to continue to do well.

We were seated at a tiny two top, which would have been OK, but the other tables around us were so close, it may as well have been communal seating. Even the staff had difficulty maneuvering between tables. It was plain awkward! I'm not sure if extra seating was added to accommodate for Valentine's or if that's the norm. If it's normal. It'd be more comfortable to be seated at the bar. \\n\\nOur waiter was OK. He was pretty attentive, but also, not attentive. Like, he came by often, but didn't care if we were having a good meal. Or he'd clear the empty glasses, but leave the plates. He also didn't offer cheese for on our meals when I saw others getting it. If that helps gage the service we got. \\n\\nBread service was OK. They serve you an individual ciabatta roll from a basket to your bread plate and deliver a fresh herb butter. I have had better, but as far as bread and butter goes, I like it all. I ordered prosecco and the boyfriend a reisling. Brought promptly with an ample pour, rightfully so, as no glass of wine was under $7. \\n\\nI ordered the asparagus ravioli that was very good with a toasted almond pasta. I'd never had anything like it before.The filing was perfectly seasoned to compliment the mild cheese sauce with ample, but not overwhelming aparagus flavor. The unfresh winter tomatoes garnish ruined the dish overall with their harsh yucky flavor. I'd request those off in the winter. Also, the sauce had a hint of uncooked wine. Like they added it, but didn't cook it long enough to get the alcohol off. A product of a busy evening I guessed as my boyfriend's Veal Marsala was in the same boat. With perfectly al dente pasta and tender veal the dish was overshadowed by runny undercooked sauce. Of course, not horrible, just not the best. I think these mistakes were minor and easily fixable if they'd been less busy. But, then again, no excuse for it, really. \\n\\nSo, that's all. No apps, no dessert, as soon as we declined dessert we immediately had our check. $56 total was a little on the high side, but also, not unusual for that type of meal.

They also had a gluten-free TCW cider that one of the dudes working the photo booth seemed to be enjoying, so I'd be anxious to try that on a hot summer day.\\n\\nThe menu looks fun for an omnivore, but limited for the veggies (and even more limited for vegans). They have a small plate section with one veggie taco that, if it doesn't have cheese, seems to be the only option for the vegans of the world.

We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.\\n\\nHusband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.\\n\\nWe both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.\\n\\nThe space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family. \\n\\nI am so excited to become a regular here!

The fries were crisp and they had also spiced it with peppers, salt and oregano I think. I liked the crunchiness of the fries. What first hit me about the burgers was the freshness of the meat and the way the meat matched perfectly with the mushrooms and the sauce used. I can go on the limb and say it is one of the best burgers I have had so far. There were not many ingredients used and the simplicity allows you to savor every flavor and not have a sensory overload.

That didn't make my day. Settled for the beef stir fried noodles. It wasn't bad nor was it spicy enough. Their chili oil was fragrant but the spice was hardly there. I'm a wuss when it comes to spice but the chili oil was not on a spice level scale from 1-5. Had to order some sriracha to get me through. That's sad! \\n\\nDessert came around, my friend had ordered the Tempura banana. Simple and good.

The Earl Grey was presented in a small antique-type silver kettle by a very nice blonde female server that mentioned that she had worked at the cafe for a while. In awaiting the waffles and sausage (took about 15-18 minutes), I noticed that the cafe seemed to fill very quickly with regulars that did a bit of gaming on their Macs/other tablets, so on & so forth. Considering that this was a Tuesday morning, there seemed to be a buzz among patrons, which I thought was good in that this could be a good place to network with professionals of like interests and such.\\n\\nOnce the food had arrived, I was impressed with the sausage yet so-so with the waffles. There were three waffles the size of my a drink coaster (quite small) on a plate. The waffles, believe it or not, looked like the asterisks that are a part of the Yelp logo!

Good thing I did, because that ended up being our favorite by far!  The texture of the RRB donut was perfect- crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  My second favorite was the passionfruit, probably because I just love passionfruit.  I thought the other two flavors were fine.\\n\\nNow that I'm back in NY writing this review and thinking about/craving these donuts again, I wish I'd a) ordered more donuts - it was just my husband and me so 4 was plenty (lasted us 2 days), but I would've loved to try more flavors...and b) ordered more of the buttermilk donuts - the apple cider fritter one looked really good!

We had 4 guests (so total of three couples) coming to Vancouver so we wanted to give them an authentic experience. What better than seafood in a modern, downtown location? We ordered white wine. I prefer dry, so ordered accordingly. The wine was too sweet so I asked the waiter for another bottle - not to replace the one we had but an add-on (expense not an issue). The waiter refused saying the wine was dry enough. WHAT! Long discussions, eventually we got what we ordered. Food was fine (only) - despite our meal being constantly interrupted by talkative waiters (no, we weren't interested how long you'd worked in Vancouver and where you'd be going in the summer). End of night, went to the restaurant entrance to recover our valet-parked cars. They refused - didn't I know that the alcohol limits in Vancouver were tight and I had to get a taxi!? Fair enough if I had been the driver, but yes I did know DUDE, and my wife and another guest were the designated drivers - they were both completely sober. Why did I have to argue this with you?

It's nice to share a regular size so you can check out other food stalls.\\n\\nNext we had the schnitzel which I thought was satisfying.

While you're in line, a host finds a table for your party and lets you know what number to look for and give with your order. No hovering over tables waiting to snatch one up as someone leaves. No waiting outside until they can seat you.\\n\\nNow the important stuff - food and beer. The beer selection, while fairly limited, is really good. The burgers were top-freakin-notch. I got the Magic Shroom burger, and all of the flavors blended together really well. The bun, the cheese, the mushrooms, the pesto, the burger.... everything was just stellar. They lose a star because they never asked how I wanted it done, and as a result, I ended up with a burger that was medium-well. That said, it was still really freakin good."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Service not great at all.

Some of them beat the normal boring food of bars. \\n\\nI had the sesame seed encrusted salmon with the sweet fries and broccoli as sides. They food was all deliciously rich, which is a euphemism for saying overly buttery. The sweet fries were some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Slightly breaded, perfectly crunch. The broccoli was cooked well, as was the salmon. I usually prefer my salmon raw, but this well-done salmon was well done. I really enjoyed the crunch sesame seed crust.\\n\\nFor dessert we split the fried snickers bars. As ridiculous as it sounds, I've had fried snickers before, and this was not as good. The fried crust was too tough, and led to a hard to eat fried snickers bar.

Have not eaten the pizza though, so I cannot comment on it. \\n\\nMy coworkers and I order delivery from this place frequently. One of the popular dishes we get are the chicken wings. They come in various flavors and spiciness. A bucket of 10 along with celery sticks and bleu cheese dressing is almost $8. The flavors I have eaten are the honey mustard and, of course the buffalo flavors. There are five degrees of spiciness: Mild, Medium, Hot, Super Hot, and Ballistic. I have eaten the Hot and Ballistic Buffalo wings. The chicken wings were big and meaty and I enjoyed them even more with some cooked leftover fried rice that I brought to the office. \\n\\nEating the Hot Buffalo wings actually was not that hot to my taste buds. It felt more medium spiced than hot spiced. Really tasty and went along well with my rice. \\n\\nThe Ballistic Buffalo wings are the spiciest chicken wings I have ever eaten. Eating just one piece caused a reaction that I typically get from eating really spicy food. I was sweating and my face had a slight burning feeling and it made me want to drink some milk to calm the spiciness. My nose was really runny, but it did clear up after I was finished with that one piece. \\n\\nThe Honey Mustard wings are really good, and are a great alternative to the buffalo wings. \\n\\nI have also ordered other dishes as well. I have eaten the Chicken Cutlet Pasta dinner. I paid a little more than $9 total (including tax, tip and my part for the delivery fee). It comes in a plastic box approximately 7.5 cm in height, 23 cm in length, 15.5 cm in width. It was filled to the lid of the box, not the rim, so the portion was really generous, and I had enough for lunch and dinner. The garlic bread was also big as well. The pasta was nothing special, the tomato sauce was watery, the chicken was not crispy, and after eating the pasta, my stomach felt a little funny. The garlic bread did not seem to taste fresh, so I thought it was really mediocre, but the butter and garlic was tasty. I would probably not order the pasta dishes again, even though they give great portions at the price you are paying for. \\n\\nThe sandwiches are pretty huge, and they seem to also be a good value for what you are paying for. The onion rings are tasty as well. \\n\\nOrdering is very convenient. You can order from their website, windypizza.com or by phone. They were really quick, under 30 minutes.  \\n\\nIf I order from Windy City with my coworkers, I am definitely going to order the chicken wings again as long as I have some rice to go along with it. The Ballistic Buffalo wings are probably the spiciest chicken wings I have eaten in the Boston area so far."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Old school, fun and delightful -- this is not a fancy place but it sure is fun.

This place has waiter service, which I found unusual for a burger places.  Ted's was the only burger place that I've been to that had waiter service. At other places, you go at the counter and wait. \\n\\nUnlike the other newer, trendy burger places, they don't advertise grass fed beefs, hormone free meats, gluten free buns, etc. They just serve burgers and non-beef burgers. They do have a gluten free option where you can order a burger without a bun. \\n\\nI tried the Lamburger. I never tried any type of lamb hamburger before, so I didn't know what to expect. The Lamburger looked pretty with all the colors. It came with marinated vegetables, goat cheese and some sauces. It had a strong lamb flavor which took me by surprise. I guess I'm used to tasting beef in my hamburgers. Even with the strong taste of lamb, I found it to be a decent burger. I would avoid it if you don't like the taste of lamb though.\\n\\nThe sides at Flip Burger tasted good. I loved the onion rings. They didn't make them gigantic. Compared to their competitors it seemed more manageable to eat in 1-2 bites. Also, they deep-fried and battered them well. It had a nice, crunchy texture.\\n\\nTheir fried okra tasted good too. It wasn't sliced up pieces of okra, they used the entire okra and fried them up. The Siracha sauce it came with made it taste good. I loved that sauce.\\n\\nTheir Sweet Potato Tots tasted good too. It was nice and crunchy. My friend said she could taste some heat to it. I didn't. But I'm used to eating spicy food, unlike her who is wimpy with spicy stuff.\\n\\nTheir fries seemed like normal fries. I didn't see anything special about those. For $3.50, I would try the other sides if you want something more exciting than french fries and ketchup.\\n\\nThey had a soda I haven't seen before called \\"Nehi\\" sodas. I tried the grape flavored one. It didn't taste that much different from grape Fanta. Oh well. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I didn't get to try their milkshakes. Being lactose intolerant sucks. Maybe next time, I'll brave it as long as there's a bathroom nearby. \\n\\nI liked the burgers, and I liked the sides better. I think for the price, they seem overpriced.

We had heard there were long waits for food to arrive but I think we only waited 15-20 minutes. We debated getting one of their famous waffles but decided to save that for next time. The Fricass√©e was pretty good; I was impressed with the amount of short ribs. The arugula seasonal greens complemented the dish well and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The focaccia was great for mopping up the tomato sauce and runny yolks, but one piece isn't enough. I'd rate Medina 3 stars because while the food was good, I don't know if I could say it justified the wait time. Dare I say it's slightly over hyped?

We went to the one in Lake Mary.  We arrived early and were directed to the bar area where we each ordered a cocktail.  The drinks were very good.  Approximatley 15 minutes after our reservation time, we were taken to a cozy table in a very nice dining area. Our server did not come over to our table for approximately 15 minutes, but the \\"assistant server\\" did come and take our drink order after 10 minutes.\\n    For an appetizer, my husband ordered the crab-stuffed mushrooms.  The crab was a bit too strong for my taste, but he enjoyed them.  I ordered the lobster bisque which had one very tiny lump of lobster, but overall, was very well seasoned and quite tasty.\\n    My husband ordered the Cowboy ribeye for his main dish and a salad, and I ordered a Chef's seafood special and we shared a side dish of asparagus with  Hollandaise sauce. My husband said that his steak was cooked correctly and tasted fine, but it had very little seasoning. The salad never arrived, but was on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed. The asparagus was fine, but the sauce was bland.\\n    My entree consisted of one small lobster tail, two scallops and two jumbo shrimp cooked in a wine, butter, garlic sauce.  The dish arrived extremely overcooked.  The scallops has a rubbery consistence and the sauce was nonexistent as it appeared to be cooked into the dish it was served in.  The scallops and shrimp were served atop tomato slices that were very soggy and extremely unappetizing. The server was very nice and appologetic.  She said a replacement that was cooked correctly would arrive promptly.  I asked her to please have the tomatoes omited and to ask for more sauce. Over 10 minutes later (my husband had already finished his entree) the new dish arrived.  This time the seafood was severly undercooked.   The tomatoes were once again added and the sauce was once again nonexistent. I told the server that I would not like to try a third time.  The manager came over and was very apologetic and said that he would take the dish off of the bill.  He added that they were a steak house and that was what they did best.  I feel that if that is the case then maybe they should not offer other dishes.  The seafood dish was $38.00 and I could have eaten better at Red Lobster for much less!.. This is a high-end restaurant and they should not serve poorly cooked food, even if it is not steak!  Even without my entree, the bill was $89.00 (this did not include cocktails as we had paid for them at the bar).  For this amount of money I do expect to be able to actually eat the food served.  I gave one star due to the time it took to be served and due to the quality of the food served.  There are many restaurants nearby that do a much better job, such as Nelore Steakhouse or La Bodega.

You can get any of their dishes in the form of a pita sandwich, a laffa wrap (like a burrito) or in a bowl. The chicken shawarma is my favorite. I also adore their babaganoush which I always order as a side though I do have to make a complaint about the side of pita bread that comes with it: it is not enough. The babaganoush bowl is pretty abundant and comes with a tiny pita cut into quarters. My husband is quite the scooper and I am a decent dipper, and even though he takes massive amounts of babaganoush using the pita as a vehicle, we always end up with still half the bowl left but no more bread to eat it with.

The meat is tender and has a nice smoky flavor to it.  I like it that they don't drown everything in BBQ sauce because I want to be able to taste the smokiness of the meat itself.  The first few times I went there, I also ordered fried okra which comes coated with a cornmeal crust.  That stuff is good too.  Unfortunately, the most recent time I was there, okra wasn't on the menu anymore.  The server said that it was out of season or something.  Too bad, because okra and BBQ go great together.

A few TV's playing sports or a random television show and they'll change it to something specific if you ask them to.\\n\\nFor now seating is fine but if this place becomes really popular [and it has that potential] than I see this potentially being an issue.\\n\\n~Service~\\n\\n The service was outstanding.  I went here with some friends a few weeks ago and we were greeted at the door by the owner who was not only friendly but seemed VERY eager for us to critique his food.   He ~really~ wants to make the best pizza he can which is a refreshing attitude to see.\\n\\nHe was quite helpful with any questions we had about anything on the menu and offered some great suggestions.\\n\\n~Food~\\n\\nThe important part!  There was 4 of us [none of us small guys either] and an order of Garlic Knots and 2 large pizza's were enough to fill us up. \\n\\nWe order the \\"Been to the Greenbelt\\"  as well as the \\"No Pity Joe Pesci\\".\\n\\nThe crust of the pizza was quite good and both pizzas arrived with ample sauce and plenty of cheese.\\n\\nThe Been to the Greenbelt pizza was surprisingly good. I personally think a pizza with no meat is blasphemous but everyone else wanted to try it.  I was surprised at how good it was.  That being said, it was difficult to taste everything on it. The mushrooms and onions seemed to get lost in the pizza.  I could taste the broccoli and artichoke hearts but that was it.  It was a common \\"complaint\\" at our table about the pizza.  That said it was still quite good.\\n\\nNext up, the \\"No Pity Joe Pesci\\".  They were out of the ham which bummed me out as it's personally my favorite meat on a pizza but he happily substituted it with their Italian artisan pepperoni.    I love these pizza and thought it was delicious.   The meatball and the sopressata were the stand outs as far the toppings go.\\n\\nThe garlic knots was the biggest complaint we had.  They weren't consistant in size at all, actually they were quite off.  Half the table liked them the other not so much.  The one I got was a bit too hard on the outside and I personally like my garlic knots to be quite soft and easy to tear so I can easily dip it into the marinara sauce.\\n\\n~Price~\\n\\nThis is the main culprit as to why I gave this place a 3 out of 5.\\n\\nThe prices are high.  I understand the ingredients they use are of a higher standard than most of the other pizza joints nearby but if you're unable to make those ingredients REALLY stand out and smack you in the mouth, than it doesn't really matter. \\n\\nThere is a nearby pizza joint near me that has pizza equally as good as this place an they charge 9.99 for a 3 topping XL pizza. Compared to 22.50 here.\\n\\nI have no problem forking over money for a good pizza but the pizza needs to be worth the price and they aren't there yet.\\n\\n~Overall~\\n\\nI plan on coming here a few more times.  The atmosphere is pleasant, the owner / employees are quite fantastic and he REALLY seems to care what his patrons think.\\n\\nI really hope they learn to make those stand out ingredients POP in their pies sooner rather than later.  The ingredients are fantastic but the flavors are getting lost, which makes spending 22.50 for a pizza there a hard pill to swallow. \\n\\nI do recommend trying this place out for sure, it's a place to keep your eye on and has all the potential in the world to be a popular Austin pizza joint!"},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Why I don't deserve down votes just because I don't love chocolate: I've lived in Belgium and have bought from a lot of Chocolateries.\\n\\nThe few times I've been to Thierry, they've only been O-K.

I am not sure if the smell around the sushi bar area was because of the fish or if it was more analysis with the patrons in the area. \\n\\nI tried the \\"chicken wings\\", stir fried Udo noodles with seafood and a couple different tries at steak along with some maki rolls.  I wasn't really impressed with anything.  The stir fry Udon noodles were by far the best thing that I tasted.  The tempura items were fairly flavorless, even the ones in the maki rolls.  The \\"filet\\" was a creative interpretation of what a filet should be/is.  during a previous visit we got the Miso Salmon which was a couple small pieces of fish for about $20 and is an appropriate serving size for a humming bird.  \\n\\nIt took about 20 minutes to be waited on.

The frosting was the consistency of a stick of butter and tasted exactly like eating raw butter. Didn't even taste like it had sugar in it, just raw butter. Very very strange to say the least. The worst part was you might have been able to eat around it if it was only on the outside of the cake, however they used the exact same raw butter tasting stuff as the filling where lemon curd was supposed to be. This was so disappointing. I don't think two bites of the entire cake were eaten before everyone just had this disgusted look on their face and the whole cake was tossed right in the trash.

Not a huge coffee fan so it wasn't my favorite, but I could see how coffee lovers might like this. The coconut flakes add that slight coconut flavor and some texture.\\nBlackberry compote filled with peanut butter powder - never had peanut butter powder before but it really is a powder that tastes like peanut butter! This one is a very interesting donut. The pair between peanut butter and blackberry does work, although it wasn't the perfect match in my opinion. The blackberry filling is so delicious though. \\nOld fashioned buttermilk - hands down my favorite. There is just something in the way that Blue Star makes this classic. The donut itself is incredibly soft and fluffy. I was melting with every bite. It was a beautiful crunch on the outside, and the donut has been scored in such a way that the sugary glaze gets into every crack. \\nBlueberry bourbon basil - a favorite among many Yelpers. I did enjoy this donut, although it wasn't my favorite. The blueberry coating is scrumptious and you can definitely taste the basil. (Which is a good thing because if the name says basil, then it should taste like basil!). \\nRaspberry buttermilk - similar to the old fashioned but it has a raspberry glaze. If you are a raspberry lover, then this is definitely heaven.\\nHard apple cider fritter - oh so delicious! There are tons of apples found throughout the donut so you really get an apple punch. The outside is perfectly crispy with the inside being nice and fluffy.\\nLemon poppyseed - another lemon packed donut. This one has poppyseeds so if you like lemon and poppyseeds, you will probably like this one. I love how the lemon flavor just pops and stands out.\\nPassion fruit - oh tarty goodness! I love passion fruit and this donut encompasses the flavor so well. The outside is a perfect tart glaze that melts in your mouth. \\n\\nI truly appreciate that the name of the donut is really carried through in the flavors of the donut. They don't skimp on the fillings or the flavor. If it says raspberry, then it's going to taste like raspberry. If it says coffee, then you will be given coffee. Love that about this place.\\n\\nFurthermore, the service here was awesome. We were given our donuts promptly. I originally only ordered seven donuts but they gave us two extra lemon poppyseed donuts in our box! It was so nice of them to do that! +1 for the extra donuts because no one can say no to more donuts!\\n\\nThe smell when you walk in is enticing and it will hug you from all angles.

I ordered the white clam chowder both times I came in and I adored it, the smokey flavours were great. The lobster bisque was good as well but not my favourite.

We ordered the sourdough bread with it and it came to us piled with freshly grated parmesan. \\n\\nMy next time in I ordered the chefs selection of oysters, the classic mussels, king crab and the chowder again. The oysters were delicious, coming with a great selection of toppings and range of different types.

I have tried the papas fritas, the yuca fries, a roasted half chicken special they had, the pork belly sliders, and picarone for dessert when out at dinner.  I came recently for brunch and had the pork belly huevos benedict - which was the best breakfast I'd had in my life.  They serve the eggs on top of these cassava root, zucchini and corn fritters instead of on english muffins, and these fritters are probably my favourite thing about the dish.  Imagine that - they are so tasty that I am a bigger fan of them than the perfect and moist pork belly on top of them.\\n\\nIf coming here for dinner, leave room for dessert, and order the picarone to make your life instantly better than it was before.  They're these little doughnuts with raspberry sauce, but are made out of sweet potato and peruvian pumpkin.\\n\\nThe service is excellent - everyone I've ever met there has been friendly, attentive, and created a great experience for me and the diners i was with - the ambiance is wonderful and very comfortable, and the drink choices and cocktails are everything you could want.  Its a smaller place, but this adds to its charm, because it feels intimate and cozy.  \\n\\nRegarding the bar, I'm a fan of beer myself, and like that they have driftwood white bark on tap.

According to a staff member who wrote me a venomous private message on Yelp threatening legal action, the falafel was provided at the request of the bride from another Mid-Eastern restaurant since Phara's does not offer falafel on its menu. Although I appreciate Phara's efforts to accommodate the bride's request, I think the restaurant should take responsibility for what they *serve* as well as what they make in-house. For example, if a restaurant does not have its own bakery or pastry chef and must get bread or desserts from another vendor, it would behoove it to choose a vendor that makes a product that it is proud to serve as its own.

It was good, but a little dry. I also thought it would be grilled fish, but it was actually fried before being minced. Oh well.\\n\\nMy friend had the Chicken Tibs, which was very tasty.

There is a garage roll-up door they can put up when the weather is nice, outside seating (no smoking) and heat lamps, which I find quite luxurious. The only negative is that the classical music will get sucked into kind of a brackish aural swill when the neighboring business, some kind restaurant with outdoor music, does the weekend thing.

The space is cool. You can see the whole workspace in the back. They have counters around for folks to take a quick seat and enjoy their snack.  They also serve Stumptown coffee which goes awesome with their donuts.\\n\\nAll around they have signs explaining why this is one of the least greasy donuts around (low temps and rice oil) as well as why the donut tastes so great (brioche dough deep fried).\\n\\nWe tried a bunch of flavors but below are some standouts.\\n\\nCreme br√ªl√©e donut has a crispy top.  I have no idea how they keep it from becoming a sugary ooze.  Actually I have no idea how they keep it from being too sweet.  This is the donut with the little sqeezie stuck in it.  Seems to be some sort of sweet rum concoction from what I could tell.  The cream in the donut was nice and seems to contain actual vanilla bean. Surprisingly balanced and not too sweet\\n\\nBanana walnut fritter also had a really nice crispy exterior, but a soft interior.  It was actually almost like a bread pudding.  Again not super sweet.\\n\\nLemon Poppyseed glaze has a bright lemony flavor so go for that if you like that flavor.\\n\\nOne of my favorite flavors there was the blueberry basil bourbon donut.  The glaze has a fruity blueberry tang and a fruity sweetness comes through. I saw them making some of the base for the glaze and it's really a lot of blueberries and basil.  I even saw them pour in a cup of the Bulleit bourbon into the blender.  It's sweeter than some of the other donuts there, but still not cloying.\\n\\nThey say their donuts aren't oily and they aren't kidding.  You can get them in a box or just served on paper.  The paper will get some oil, but it won't soak the whole thing through.  We bought a box and left them in the car and the oil didn't soak through the bottom of the box (you know what I mean)."},{"name":"The Breakfast Club","address":"270 Western Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Great, cheap hungover food.

The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable as he recommended the light and refreshing limoncello sparkler, a crisp blend of limoncello liqueur (not house-made, alas) with a non-alcoholic mixer served in a champagne glass, the perfect aperitif. \\n\\nOnce we were seated at the primo table nestled in the rear corner of the second story deck overlooking the trees of Freedom Parkway, we decided to share a sampling of the \\"really small plates\\" and \\"small plates\\" forgoing an entree all together. \\n\\nThe Gaufrette potato chips lived up to their billing as a decadent and rich nibble of crisp and thin waffle style potato chips with slightly warm chunks of gorgonzola cheese and gorgonzola sauce drizzled over top- wow. It made me want to dust off my mandoline and experiment with recreating this easy but impressive and delectable appetizer. Update: when I was verifying ingredient information for this review on Babette's website, I spotted a note from the chef saying that she is willing to share recipes upon request! :) \\n\\nThe most memorable dish for me though was the grilled corn chowder made with fresh and sweet in season corn and topped with a small but tasty portion of fresh lump crab. Normally, I eschew seafood (I know, I know!) but this was delicious and we finished every drop of the bowl of soup. It is offered by the 'taste' and by the bowl. If you're splitting dishes as we were and want to be sure to each get enough, the bowl is better, but it would likely be way too much for a single diner, especially if being followed by an entree as its thick and rich texture and taste was quite filling. \\n\\nOther highlights were the Georgia shrimp and gnocchi with olives in an herbed butter sauce. Though I just sampled the dish sans shrimp, save one tiny bit of shrimp at my dinner date's behest which just reconfirmed my aversion to its chewy texture, the gnocchi was tender and melted in my mouth and the sauce was gorgeous- fresh and light tasting with a bright well-balanced summer herb flavor. The piroskis of pork and veal were spectacular, little pockets of dough bursting with flavor and complemented by a tarragon butter sauce that was so good, we mopped up the remaining bit with the delicious bread. \\n\\nOverall, Babette's is a unique, special restaurant that deserves its fine reputation. The chef-owner Marla Adams was on the floor several times throughout the evening greeting frequent diners and she seemed very warm and gracious to all. One thing worth noting was that while this was a Friday night, the restaurant had completely emptied by the time we finished dining around 10 pm, though it had been packed when we arrived at 8. It seems to be a restaurant with an early-dining crowd if our experience was any indicator. \\n\\nService overall was terrific- pacing was right as dishes came out piecemeal as we requested- and our server was able to answer detailed questions about dishes and made recommendations with ease. \\n\\n4.5 stars out of 5 and well worth a return visit soon!"},{"name":"Kyma","address":"3085 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I luckily got to go to Atlanta on a business trip.

This past time I went, the waitress (a different one) was very nice, but almost a little bossy.... told us that there was no way we could split one of the apps we wanted (\\"it's just not good for sharing\\") but we ordered it anyway and it was fine. She tried selling us on something that was way bigger and way more expensive... it rubbed me the wrong way. \\n\\nI'm so torn because this place has amazing food /drinks and I love the decor/ambiance, but the service sucks.

The set menu includes a 6lb Alaskan King Crab (ways), peking duck (2 ways), soup and a pork dish. The service was pretty good (i'm comparing to Houston's Chinatown service), they cleared our full dirty plates often and moved dishes to a smaller dish as we finished. \\n\\nThis is my hubby and I's first time having FRESH Alaskan King Crab, so we were pretty excited. We saw a few tables where they brought out the live king crab, so we thought they would do the same for us.  NOPE that didn't happen.... I felt robbed of that experience but the food made up for it. The legs of the king crab were steamed with garlic and onions and the juices from the legs were used to toss egg noodles. The body of the crab was salt and pepper toasted.  The peking duck was really good too and I didn't try to lettuce wraps only because I don't want filler. The pork dish came out and it was fried fatty pieces of pork... we were all too full to eat it, so we had small pieces of it. \\n\\nSince this is our first time experiencing fresh king crab I don't have anything to compare it to. Also, since we did not get to see the king crab prior to being cooked I can't be sure if we got all 6lbs of the crab... but everyone left very very full and we finished most of the food (so we didn't waste anything)."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I live right around the corner and this place is somewhat of a staple of mine.

If so you'll probably love Babica Hen cafe. I love it because of its proximity to my house, home style food, and the addictive chorizo gravy! The owners did a nice job renovating the old La Provence, it's more open, has new fixtures and a warm color scheme that provides a minimalistic yet comfortable interior. There's just one catch, they only serve breakfast and lunch. However this all day until three concept works because of quality, service, and a simple well thought out menu with no fuss.\\n\\nI've tried an item from each section on the menu which breaks down like this: waffles, eggs, specialties and lunch. The options offer both sweet and savory for carnivore or vegetarian. But take it from this elite meat eater, you'll want something, anything, with their chorizo gravy! \\n\\nI thought their rum, apple, bacon-caramel waffle was inventive but lacked flavor. So if I had to recommend one thing for taste and value, it would have to be the Iron Miners breakfast. For $11 you get a hearty portion of potato hash mixed with roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions and cheddar. That is smothered in delectable, lip-smacking chorizo gravy, with two eggs, your choice of sausage or bacon, (bacon always wins) and toast with homemade jam. You can upgrade your bread option to corn, a biscuit or coffeecake for a mere ($)dollar. I also tried their pork schnitzel and biscuit combo with said gravy for a mouth watering, pork pleasure cruise down tonsil alley, it was heavenly. Picture delicate pork pounded thin and lightly dusted with panko atop flaky, golden biscuits and drowned in a salt bath of silky gravy. The only thing that could elevate my pork fix was dipping a bacon strip and using it like a fat mop to soak up the tasty remnants left on my plate. My rule when eating out is the food should inspire recreation but this cream spiked, meaty marvel, has this addict brimming in jealousy, because this hen house has the secret perfected!\\n\\nDid you hear that Babica? You have created a fan without any fowl play. Just know this, if you decide to put a pork triple play on the menu you may have a gravy stalker licking his hands to get at your recipe!"},{"name":"Tassili's Raw Reality","address":"1059 Ralph D Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I visited this modestly-decorated, dimly lit West End establishment for an early Saturday night dinner.

Our waitress passed by our table multiple times while we sat and waited and waited, every time completely avoiding all eye contact with us.  Not until I finally got up and approached several employees standing around their computer was there any mention of the status of our order. At that point, we were told that our order still had two more orders ahead of it. It was still another 30 minutes before we were FINALLY served.  This was the worse customer service I have ever experienced. All they had to say regarding the situation was that they would give us a discount. We just wanted our meal. They avoided us at all costs the entire time we sat there waiting.  Never offered appetizers or any reason for why it too so long.  The waitress never even apologized until the point where she brought our checks to be totaled out. I.e. When we were completing the total with her tip. Tip? Are you kidding me?

Since I had try coming here last year on Christmas Eve and failed miserably when it closed early that day (hence why the above picture was taken during the night), I happily obliged. \\n\\nEntry for car2go members was free that weekend, so there was really no reason to say no! Otherwise, it's normally $5 per person.  Not sure if I would pay that much to go in, especially since the stuff inside is not that cheap.  (This is also considering that people were complaining that $2 at the Richmond Night Market was called expensive.)\\n\\nThis German Christmas Market is located right at Queen Elizabeth Theatre with food stands, as well as crafts.  It was nice to head to the market fairly early when it was still light out.  However, I guess the evening is also nice when all the Christmas lights are lit up.\\n \\nAfter a moment's wandering in search of the stand with the German sausages, we found the Black Forest Delicatessen, which sold a variety of sausages served with buns and sauerkraut.\\n\\nWe got the bratwurst (~$8), which is made from both pork and beef sans bun and sauerkraut since we weren't feeling too hungry.  I found it to be quite good, with a crunchy exterior and not-too-salty interior. Eight dollars for just the sausage is kind of a shame, but I wouldn't mind coming back (since I have a free re-entry card!) to try it with the bun and sauerkraut.\\n\\nWe also got the freshly baked pretzel (~$4) since they looked pretty big.  Perhaps it was due to the cold weather, but the pretzel was sadly quite cold.  I didn't find it too special, but actually quite salty and not soft enough.\\n \\nThe most popular stand by far was actually non-German -- the Hurricane Potato stand! Lines here were quite a bit shorter than they were at the Richmond and Summer Night Market, but I wasn't interested in having potato on a stick.  Another stand sold kettle corn.  I haven't seen people mix the popcorn in a large vat for a while, so I thought it was pretty cool.\\n\\nSomething else that I thought was pretty neat was that people were carrying cute blue and green mugs whilst strolling in the market.  Cider and mulled wine was sold at the German Gluhwein stands scattered in the market.\\n\\nThe apple cider without alcohol was $4, and the mug was an additional $2 which served as a deposit.  The cider was delicious, but not all that special.  It was slightly kitschy, since it was overpriced (only 200mL of cider!), though I'm sure the cider was of decent quality.  But regardless, toting a hot mug while walking around the market was pretty cool and a highlight. I can see how visiting the market could be a holiday tradition for many since it's quite neat and happens only once a year.  If you've never been and you really want to go, I'd suggest going on weekdays from 11am - 4pm when it's $2 admission."},{"name":"Giuseppe's Ritrovo","address":"2268 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Great Italian neighborhood restaurant!

With the busy holiday schedule, and relatives flying in to visit, it was a perfect place for our group of eight to meet up....some of us coming back to NW side with out of town guests directly from the airport and other family members central and NE. The location is a stones throw away from 183 and Burnett and, since most people seem to love Italian, a good choice for maximum enjoyment. We were expecting a solid Italian experience....we all found it to be a gem in an unexpected place. Who would look for excellent Gnocchi behind a jack in the box next to a floral shop in a strip mall?  Not I!\\nWe ordered appetizers to desserts and everyone was generally pleased with their food. I do think that gnocchi is a good indicator of an Italian restaurants capabilities. Although a \\"simple\\" dish, .they are all to easy to screw up. Andiamo's were very tender without being mushy and bland. I had the lamb....expertly cooked to medium rare and tender. Let's see....what other stuff did I try??? I tried the filet Mignon with a cream mushroom sauce which was tasty as well. It is always a welcome change to find good Italian food which is not smothered in tomato sauce and cheese. Between the food and the service I will definitely eat here again. check this place out...it has a really cozy down home feel, complete with the owners visits to your table, in addition to that extra attention to detail.

I have gave it a year to get better but it literally can not get any worse. I run a business that is not 100 yards from this taco bell and it is a fast paced business where me and my employees need to eat fast, or at least get our food in a reasonable amount of time. I would say 5 minutes from order would be reasonable.  This does not happen here.  I have been caught in the drive thru for over 45 minutes (no exaggeration) and today took the cake.  I should have learned my lesson, but I pulled in and saw the drive thru line was overflowing...poor souls.. I parked and went inside to an empty dining room. I ordered my food.  I went to use the bathroom and im not kidding, the urinal AND the toilet were overflowing, water all over the floor. The employee said they knew about it for awhile, but were too busy to handle it.  I wish I could send a pic. There were poop pieces in the hallway to the eating area.  As I was waiting for my food there was a traffic jam outside where people were trying to reverse out of the drive thru line, people were coming inside and asking for money back, an elderly man ordered just before me and he ordered ONE BURRITO SUPREME and I got my order before him which was an order for 2 people.  It seems that the business owner has done nothing to help the situation. I don't understand as if it was my business I would make sure I watched social media and also had a finger on the pulse of my business! I ordered my food per my receipt at 5pm and I just got to my work next door at 530.  Fortunately this was a little faster than normal.  They informed me they were out of Baja blast, then the guy who ordered after me they told they were out of dr pepper. There were over 20 receipts on the counter top by the register all spread out where people had got their food and just left them there to blow all over. I could see the kitchen and there was a nacho on the floor, and countless pieces of garbage all over.  I have reasonable expectations from a fast food joint, but this place is so bad I cant believe it. I feel bad for the kids working there. They have no direction. Its like their parents have gone out of town and they are trying to run a business. Someone HAS to get this place under control. Right now, I have vowed to drive the 4 miles up the street to the other taco bell and get my food there. At least I know what I will be getting."},{"name":"360 Pizza","address":"6203 N Capital Of Texas Hwy, Ste A100","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Just moved to Austin and  it's our second night ordering out from 360 pizza in the past 4 days.

I go for the No Pink.  My hubby gets the Pink and it is definitely a more rare burger.  I really like that all the condiments are DIY.  No chance of getting that pesky mayo when you don't like it.  The food is always piping hot and the burgers are so juicy.   We've started to put a paper towel on the tray to soak up all the juice that drips.  Once you pick the burger up, it's hard to put down.  The fries are great too.  Cut small and nice and crisp.  The waitstaff has always been pleasant and attentive.

They also called me a few minutes later, when I was 1 block away. (I like the redundant notification system.)  I went through the drive-thru, picked up my food and had a pleasant, brief conversation with the lady at the window.  She was very friendly and when asked, said she really liked working there.  She also informed me that the oil was a really good oil that didn't make the food greasy.  I appreciated her input.  \\nI took the food home and the unveiling was surprisingly pleasant.  I even liked the container.  The salad was a spring mix, another pleasant surprise, and all of the veggies were fresh!  They gave me dressing on the side -- including an extra one that I requested online  (Yaay!) -- and buffalo sauce on the side.  The chicken pieces were big, crunchy and juicy!  Surprisingly good!  REAL chicken breast, cooked perfectly.  The salad was abundant as I was full halfway through.  It was truly an ample serving.\\n\\nOverall, this was a surprisingly good experience.

Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup for Asians is like Marconi and cheese for North Americans. Its the ultimate comfort food. I know when I see it on the menu anywhere, I will order a bowl regardless of what else I order off the menu. \\n\\nWhat makes or breaks this dish for me is two things: 1. The noodles 2. The broth.\\n\\nMost places get one of the two right, which makes it a OK bowl. But sometimes when the stars align, I will stumble upon a bowl of pure magic. It's like in the Disney movie \\"Ratatouille\\" when Anton Ego bites into the plate of ratatouille and it transports him back to his childhood and warms him from the inside out. This is a simple peasant dish with simple ingredients, which sometime is the toughest dish to get right.\\n1. The noodles:  Get the thick Taiwanese noodles which have the best texture and taste.  I can tell it is definitely homemade, and it is NOT over cooked. This sounds like a simple thing but you'll be surprised how many people get it SOOO wrong.\\n\\n2. The broth: great flavor and NO MSG...which is rare because like I mentioned before, it is a simple dish so people cheat by putting flavor enhancers instead of using quality ingredients. The beef shank is sooo tender and moist, the chucks basically melts in your mouth. They also put a few thin slices of rare beef at the last which gets cooked by the hot broth to medium/ medium rare when the bowl hits your table.\\nThe lone bok choy in the soup and the small dish of pickle cabbage on the side works as a palate cleanser in between bites of beef and slurps of broth.  \\n\\nSo why not 5 stars? The only thing I am nick picking on is the price, like I mentioned before, this is suppose to be a simple peasant dish, which means it is suppose to be cheap. Not $11 a bowl. I would have given it 5 stars if it is $8 or less. Granted, the service is Uber fast and friendly, even by Chinese standards. So I will be back, because after all, it is still cheaper than flying back to Taipei to get a bowl."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I saw many great reviews and photos on Yelp so I wanted to give this interesting Moroccan, middle eastern cafe a try.

We sat down at a small table and ordered latte to start. For brunch, we had paella with a side of backed potatoes. Its paella has spicy chorizo, orzo pasta, Grana Padano, avocado & Spicy Charred Tomato Salsa. It was not what I was expecting. Maybe the name \\"paella\\" misled me but I thought it was so-so. Orzo pasta was okay but spicy charred tomato salsa was good with spicy chorizo. However, baked potatoes were very good! Very crispy on the outside but soft inside.

The foods good, the food is expensive, the service is friendly, and the handcrafted sodas are love.\\n\\nAs far as quality, I think they at least don't skimp on flavor and quality. Portions are also pretty big. I've tried the falafel bowl and have also carried a laffa from krog to midtown via taxi and on foot... kinda a mistake (It wasn't even an order for myself). I didn't realize this thing weights the same as a small baby. By the end of the journey my arm actually was aching.\\n\\nThe food is middle eastern food. You basically go at it Chipotle style and you pick a bowl or a laffa/burrito looking thing and a protein then a bunch of veggies, sauces, marinated veggies, or meats. They also have premade choices/combinations they've deemed super tasty themselves.\\n\\nMy favorite thing is the marinated eggplant and the food is really refreshing and fresh. Most of what I got with mine was the vegetables and didn't really bother with the meat but I was told the shawarma laffa I picked up was very good.\\n\\nOne of the things I come here most for is the handmade sodas though. I'm not entirely sure if it's something Yalla does or just has an independent offering/partnership because I've seen the lovely lady who makes the sodas at the Grant Park farmer's market selling sodas a few times unrelated to Yalla. Regardless, sooo good and so worth the money. I'm not really into drinking soda anymore so it's extremely rare treat for me, however, these handmade concoctions are soda water and handmade syrups garnished with lemon/limes/oranges and fragrant herbs. The sodas are also not super carbonated so if you like that fizzle against your tongue then it might be weak, but I don't really mind, it's enough fizzle for me and I am not a fan of flat sodas. Flavor isn't overly sweet too and each one is really unique. They often seem to change it up with whatever is available or seasonal.\\n\\nIf you're looking for something more substantial in the Krog Market definitely give Yalla a look, the bowls are huge and so are the burrito looking things (laffa--expensive but really good) and so, so tasty."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"825 Battery Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The food was great!

I love going in and seeing a completely new menu every time (though, I wish some year-round dishes were kept and perfected).  It feels like I'm eating with someone's who's always experimenting with what's around themselves, and that's exciting.  It makes me wish I lived around my foodie friends again when we'd experiment with different ways of cooking exotic protein we'd find around the city.\\n\\nI love their standard menu of eggs, greens, veggies, proteins, etc.  It's hella awkward to fill out your order with their crayola markers (seriously? get some pencils!), but very useful for controlling how much food you want for your party (and how much you want to spend).\\n\\nA french inspired rabbit-quail egg dish I had there a while ago was absolutely delicious (and I strangely appreciate the fact that they allow diners to salt their food to their own whims), even though I wish my egg had been poached instead of fried.  I also took a basque chicken dish with a tomato herb sauce back home once and was even more delicious the day after when I ate it at my kitchen counter completely plastered and foraging things to satisfy my late night munchies.  Their salads are stellar and are uniformly mouth watering.  Overall, the food is really impressive for a young chef and completely falls in line with the wave of seasonal, fresh, farm-to-table cooking you see as of late.  Put some more experimental food in their (hello offal?) or maybe some more time, I'll be head over heels.\\n\\nOn another note, no, the food isn't the most amazing I've ever had -- but I don't think it'd be fair to compare them with certain restaurants I've been to.  Navarre clearly has a certain food philosophy (experimentation, whim, and local produce), and I think they fulfill it, which is completely satisfying for me.  In terms of pure execution, they are rarely off the mark.  I had some dry hen once, but it didn't ruin my experience.  The presentation is at best described as minimalistic (at worst, just putting food on a plate).  But it doesn't bother me, personally.  It totally fits into their laid back foodie vibe.\\n\\nIn terms of service, I've had no problems with the service at all.

We had a Sunday night dinner with a party of 4 tonight. The restaurant was not very busy so our waitress shouldn't have had more than 2 other tables. Our waitress seemed very inexperienced and flustered throughout the night. It started with us waiting to have our drinks taken, which the hostess did a few minutes after seating us. Our waitress came and greeted us a few minutes after the hostess took our drink order. We ordered appetizers and our burgers at the same time. We sat for another 10-15 minutes without drinks and could see them(the drinks) ready at the bar. I had to remind her that our drinks had not arrived yet when I finally saw her check up on her other table(adjacent to ours). \\n \\nEverything else went well with the server checking up on us every once in a while. The food arrived promptly and was still pretty good quality. The tuna tacos were a bit too salty but edible and the bacon mac and cheese arrived cold. We sent back the mac and cheese and got something else. The burgers and other sides came out great as usual. \\n\\nThe second issue with the waitress was at the end of the meal. She brought the ticket to us and I told her that she charged us full price for the beers we had when they should've been half the price(Sunday special). She took the ticket(no apology btw) and went off to fix the error. When she came back a minute or two later with the new ticket, the bill had increased. She had added extra beers and did not remove the full price ones from before. Ok, no problem, I'll just let her know the issue again and be polite about it. She kind of got upset that I was telling her she still didn't fix the problem. I'm not sure why but she came back at me with an attitude, asking me if there was anything else I wanted to take off the ticket, in a snarky/sarcastic way, like I was trying to get free stuff. There actually was more, but I could tell she was stressed from trying to do her job or whatever else she was dealing with. We had ordered 3 beers and she only changed the price for 2 of them. I let it go and just paid the bill for the full price beer once she came back with the 3rd ticket. The manager came after I had already paid the tab and I explained to him what happened. He was apologetic and insisted to give me some type of gift card, which he did not mention the amount when he gave it to me.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the food is still good here. The hostesses and food runners were pleasant and courteous, but our waitress was not. Maybe she was having a bad day but don't take it out on your customers who are paying $130+ for a couple beers, tacos, burgers, and fries. This wasn't the only unpleasant experience here either, just the one that made me feel inclined to write a review about. Our visit before this one was also unpleasant in regards to service, but not quite as bad as this time. \\n\\nI'll still give them another try since the food is good and I have this gift card with a mysterious amount of credit on it to spend."},{"name":"Ebi-Ten","address":"388 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Probably one of the best small restaurant joints that I have ever been in.

I'm not sure what the trick is for actually getting that view. They did give us a very nice table next to a window. The waiter immediately came over, wished the roomie a happy birthday, and asked if we wanted wine or drinks. We were all wined out so he brought us the cocktail menu. We both ordered a nice ginger cocktail (forget the name). It was amazing. We also ordered the calamari. This is some of the best calamari I have ever had. Very tender with a kick to it from the Kung Pao sauce. Seriously, I could just eat that. \\nFor dinner he had the lobster tail and I had the filet. I was trying to decide exactly how I wanted it cooked and the waiter suggested rare plus. Sounded great to me and it was. That filet was melt in your mouth good.

The roomie does not like truffle oil but said he wanted to taste it. he ate almost 3/4 of the dish! It was by far the best mac and cheese ever!\\nFor his birthday they comped us a dessert. We ordered the bananas foster cake. Holy cow. I told the roomie this what I want for my last meal. Just this. Lot's and lot's of this. They put a rich butter cake, topped with bananas, in the middle of a long plate with \\"Happy Birthday\\" written in chocolate across the top. On one side is a scoop of Amy's ice cream, on the other a dollop of unsweetened whip cream. The waiter then takes a rum sauce, pours it over the cake, and poof, sets it on fire!

The big issue for me is that there are simply too many tables for such a small place.  You've got to remove at least one table to make room for dining.  Chairs are seriously backed up to each other, and it's practically impossible to get into your seat - and forget about going to the bathroom.  You are literally crushed up against other customers, and claustrophobic people need not eat here.  \\n\\nAs for the food, it was good but certainly not great - except for the pillowy, delicious gnocchi.  That was the best thing we tasted.  Fried calamari was solid but boring.  Squash blossoms with goat cheese were way over fried, and not nearly as good as I've had elsewhere.  Sauces were underwhelming, with a less than mediocre pesto sauce on paparadelle; and a watery tomato sauce on a decent-if-uninspiring seafood pasta.  I agree with other Yelpers that this has seen better days, and perhaps the kitchen is riding on its former glory.

We wanted a place that would give us the \\"Downtown Portland Experience\\".  Unfortunately, this is not even close to a downtown anything.  It was awful!  I was so lookinging forward to watching the trains and dining in an old school,  Portland Institution.\\n\\nFirst of all, they would not except a Groupon coupon because they only except them for dinners.  The coupon did not say anything regarding not being good for lunch.  In fact it didn't have any restrictions. We asked the server to please ask the manager.  The manager suggested getting a refund through Groupon if we weren't happy. She refused to even look at the Groupon to see why we questioned the refusal.  Even if the policy is to accept the coupon for dinner only and the coupon doesn't say that it should have been honored. Obviously, Groupon made an error.  Wilf's should take that up with them and not penalize a customer.\\n\\nNext, my critique of our server and  all I can say was the service was mediocre. When my friend asked for water, he sneered and said, \\"Of course we bring water\\".  She was embarrassed for asking, what was perceived as a stupid question by the server.  When she asked him which sandwich was better the BLT or the Wilf Burger? He responded, \\"He couldn't answer that\\".  He did the bear minimum a server should do.  Nothing more, nothing less.  When you are paying a higher price for a sandwich the least you should get is a little service.  Thoughts of Little Big Burger started to dance in my head as this dining experience proceeded.\\n\\nNow for the most important part of dining out........the food.   The food was worse than the food you get in the dining car on Amtrak.  The Corned Beef Reuben was dry.  The meat tasted as if it had been sitting out on the counter in the Wilf kitchen for a week.  I am not sure there was any sauerkraut on the sandwich but I did see a few pieces on the plate.  Someone should tell Wilf's that Russian Dressing is a key component in a Reuben along with a nice piece of swiss cheese.  The rye bread was great but it takes a little more than great bread to make a sandwich!  The  Wilf Burger(Medium) with gorgonzola had to be sent back to the kitchen because it was to rare.  Seriously, it was so raw I thought it might be a steak tartare burger  When the burger was returned it was so well done it looked like a hockey puck.  Gorgonzola was no where to be found.  !/2 of the burger was left on my plate and the waiter didn't even ask if he could wrap it up or if there was a problem.  Again, mediocre service.\\n\\nMy 60th birthday luncheon with the girls didn't turn out to be what they had planned.  Too bad, because I loved the idea and was totally looking forward to a great experience.  My questions to you are:\\n\\nDid they recently get a new cook?\\nAre they under new management?\\nAre you always empty during the luncheon rush?\\nDo you care about return business?\\n\\n***UPDATE\\n\\nThe General Manager of Wilf's called my friend last night and offered us a complimentary luncheon to make up for the disastrous lunch we had today.  Although that was a lovely gesture, we are not sure we wish to subject ourselves to their food ever again.  Maybe we will mellow in a few weeks but as of right now I am done with Wilf's!"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm not going to lie, I was impressed. \\n\\nThe location is unassuming, but it obviously isn't hurting their business and it won't keep me from going back. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is trendy without being overly pretentious.

Great list of unique sandwiches and salads. I chose the Nebo and my friend got the Zuni roll. My friend's sandwich was OK - a turkey/avocado wrap.

Everything on their menu is consistent in quality, presentation, and pure deliciousness. As far as I'm concerned, they're leading the way in the food & beverage industry, at least on the west coast of Canada.\\n\\nMy friend and I started off with two classic Adrenaline martinis that aren't on the menu anymore. If you want a slap in the face along with a taste of moderately rich chocolate coffee heaven, order one right now! The only problem is that you drink it too fast. #Depressing ;)\\n\\nIt's true. I often dream of the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I eat them probably twice/month. With the two perfect accompanying sauces, peanuts, crispy wontons, Thai-tossed chicken, and fresh lettuce, their impeccable flavour surprises me every time they enter my mouth! #JoyGasm\\n\\nThe Bacon cheddar burger (or Feenie Burger if you like saut√©ed mushrooms) is easily the best burger in town. Tap and Barrels burger comes close, but there is absolutely nothing disappointing about what it has to offer as far as a classic burger that's hinging on gourmet goes. I would have eaten two if they had of let me. #SaveBron #Delicious\\n\\nSERVICE/SUPPORT STAFF:  27/30\\n\\nIt's very rare I walk into a Cactus Club and don't get greeted with a smile. Almost every time I come there I can't help but verbally celebrate to my server (yes, my over zealousness probably embarrasses whoever I'm with lol) the fact that they're able to hold down a clean, fun, professional, yet laid back and sexy vibe WITHOUT coming across as pretentious. How do they do it? They put people first. I always feel taken care of by the servers and management at Cactus with one exception a couple years ago. Aside from that unfortunate time, they always meet my expectations of high quality, friendly service. Even though the girls look like they belong on the front cover of Vogue, 90% of them have GENUINE SMILES on their faces (even the hosts!) that's followed up with everything that a server is supposed to do. To top it all off, almost every time I've gone to Cactus Club, at least one of the staff members (usually my server) puts in the effort to make a unique human-to-human connection with me, as apposed to treating me as just another customer. That was also the case with Anna, the young, lovely girl who was taking care of us today. I so appreciated her authenticity and professionalism. It's so refreshing because you RARELY get that at other restaurants, and I can almost always expect it when I come to Cactus. I will, of course, be back soon!\\n\\nENVIRONMENT/VIBE:  20/20\\n\\nThis is my favourite part about cactus probably. There's nothing wrong with it, vibe wise. As I stated in the section above, they hold down the vibe three intending. This takes a lot of thought and attention to detail that the average person doesn't consciously recognize, but unconsciously gets impacted by in an extremely positive way. For example, the next time you go into a Cactus Club spend a good 5 minutes solid in the bathroom to observe the design work and money that's gone into it. That alone is enough to impress you. See a quick example in my photos.\\n\\nAlways busy during peak times, but never hectic. I'll come anytime I want, I know it will be a positive experience!!! Thanks, Cactus.\\n\\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE:  94/100\\n\\nFor me, it's very easy to give them a solid rating. They're doing everything a restaurant should be doing and more. If I were to give any constructive feedback, it would be to ask the management to find fun ways to encourage ALL staff members to hold a genuine smile. I believe this is something that always can and should be worked on in any public establishment. There is the odd resting bitch face that brings down the general vibe, yet at CC, it's easy to ignore. ;)"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Really good burger joint!!!

Where can I go that has more veggie options than just a salad, fish options for my Dad, who is allergic to red meat, and enough pastas to satisfy the Wop-tastic BF?? But the real reason I ended up picking Milestones is because I wanted a bellini, and Cactus Club has very limited veggie options. Therefor, Milestones it is. \\n\\nI made a rezzo for about 15 people, but I think we had more like 18 altogether, and they had reserved a little room for all of us, which was perfect! The boys didn't like it so much because there was no TV to watch the game, but hey, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to! Besides they should be paying attention to me right? ME ME ME!! \\n\\nI had a bellini to start, which you can upgrade to \\"ultimate\\" to get an extra shot on the side of either pineapple rum or raspberry vodka, so obviously I upgraded. But after that I saw someone else in my party who had ordered some juice drink that had a big pieces of mint leaves curling out of it, so I got jealous and went for a mojito. Unfortunately the mojito looked better than it tasted, and I was left longing for one as good as the one I had at Nuba a few weeks ago. So it was back to the bellinis for me.\\n\\nFor dinner I ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and the BF had the fresh spinach and tomato capellini. I was disappointed that his dish was far superior to mine in taste, but mine was definitely superior in presentation. Since we were a big group, and I wasn't really that hungry after my hangover breakfast four hours earlier, I was not in too much of a hurry, and I kinda wanted to chillax with my peeps before refilling my bloodstream with too much booze, since I don't think there was any blood left running in those veins after this weekend. However, I know that some of my friends were getting a little disgruntled with the wait times on drinks. \\n\\nThe bill came and the waitor had it seperated for each person or couple, and he slowly worked his way down the line with the wireless debit machine. One cool thing about Milestones is that if you visit their website they have special deals on that you can get. For example, I noticed they had a special coupon for people celebrating their birthday, the coupon was for one free entree when three of your friends also order an entree, and was valid for one week before and one week after the big day. That helped bring our grand total down a little bit, and give me more spending money for bellinis! Our waiter also brought over some warm chocolate cookies and ice cream on the house with a sparkler after dinner for me and everyone sang, too bad the BF was too busy eyeballing my dessert to get the camera ready. In fact, he got the lens cap off just in time for the sparkler to go out! Our waitor brought us another sparkler on our apple crisp dessert to make up for it. Even though the family paid for my dinner, I threw a $20 tip at our server for being such a nice dude, and because for some weird reason he kept reminding me of Dr. Christian Troy from Nip Tuck?? He even said he would dance on the table if we bought him some shots, so if you see him working, test this theory out for me please!"},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The struggle for good Asian food in Austin is very real.\\n\\nI'll admit I'm a prejudiced snob.

The funny thing is we originally chose to go next door to ZTejas because I felt I wasn't dressed fancy enough to go to Eddie V's compared to their other customers, but after a poor experience at ZTejas we moved next door and were warmly welcomed.

I might consider attempting to fit in a little better next time and not wear ratty clothing.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was a relatively limited HH drink special menu, a slight lack of bar seating, and of course nightmarish parking, although free valet is offered.

Moderately thin, super golden crispy (color of dark paprika) and a tad spicy. There was no slimy fat or soggy skin under the batter, which I appreciated. Breast was moist and flavorful. Collard greens were the best of the 5!sides we ordered and that's not saying much at all. They were just average. Macaroni and cheese was bland and tasted store-bought, along with the canned baked beans and the really downright awful tasting potato salad. It was watery and flavorless and the potatoes were hard.

I went to Hopdoddy's with one of my good friends on a Friday evening.We arrived at the restaurant around 9ish,which is rather late, because we took a leisurely walk along SoCo and its captivating nightlife. \\n\\nWhen arriving, I had a gut feeling that it would still be serving a large number of customers.Even though it was packed and the wait was a bit long, it was worth it. The whole process starts at the door. Once you are allowed inside the restaurant, the waitress leads you to a bar/drink area where you obviously order any beverage (or milkshake in my case) on the menu. It is prepared right there so that you do not have to wait in line without something to 'snack' on.\\n\\nMy friend got a nutella and chocolate pretzel milkshake. Boy, was is something else! First of all, you have the best combo in the WORLD- sweet and salty. The 'sweet' nutella, which is an amazing blend of hazelnut and cocoa, and then you have pretzels, or the'salty' component. Basically, I was at a lose of words due to the shocking reality that something like this exists on a menu.\\n\\nBefore we were done at the cash register, we were given our table number. After our purchase we had to find our table, which was alittle difficult due to the heavy traffic within the restaurant's  limited amount of space. We got our order in the next 10-15 minutes. I got the Janis Joplin, a hemp veggie burger with amazing avocado and tillamook cheese with an order of Kennebec fries. My friend got fries too but a Terlingua burger instead of my vegetarian conscious burger.\\n\\nOverall, the sprouts with the avocado and horseradish made a great combination.  The texture of the veggie patty was not solid like a hamburger but loosely packed. Some people might find this odd, but I like it better when the patty is not so condensed.

Perhaps my standards were high after my intial bite into the burger.\\n\\nWho knows, but this should not stop you from purchasing this particular side.\\n\\nAll in all, I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to show Austin off to their friends.

The menu card does a great job of describing the food, and our server went above and beyond to help us become familiar with the options. We ordered the Lentil Sambusas as an appetizer, they were a-ok as a good start. My friend had the goat tibs, I had the veggie platter. Food was great and spiced well. I tried a couple of the beers, Harah and St George, preferred the latter. The injera bread is always my favorite part of an Ethiopian meal, and the only negative of the meal is that they were slow to refill it. The problem with not having bread available is that you don't have eating utensils, so the bread is essential to finishing your meal! I might have considered a five star on this one if we didn't have to wait around for more bread, and this is one detail that may have been overlooked.

You either wait to be seated or on one occassion I just walked in and sat down on a busy night (I think it says to do that on one of the signs).\\n\\nHere is what I've ordered with ice cream (minus the gourdough):\\n\\nSouthern Belle: Lots of big pecans.  Be prepared to cut it hard.  Still good though.\\nFreebird:  You can't go wrong with graham crackers and fruit.  Delicious.\\nFlying Pig:  Chopped up strips of curled bacon on a donut.  The bacon goes very well with the sugar and tastes of perfection.  I still have yet to try everything, but this is one of the best donuts I've tasted.  You have to try this...\\nThe Gourdogh: A Sunday Brunch Donut sandwich that tastes really good.\\n\\nWhat I like about the dessert donuts is that the amount of sugar is just right.

Right from the start we felt that we were somehow inconveniencing them by visiting their restaurant. I understand that it was a busy day, but that's the day that they can turn occasional patrons into regular patrons. Instead, they treated us like cattle (get them in - get them out). I'm really not kidding. The waiting took our plates before we were even finished. \\n\\nWe came in on Father's Day and were looking forward to our raw oysters, fried clams, and lobster.  The raw oysters had obviously been opened days before and refrigerated. They tasted old - which is never good with raw food. I begged my wife to send them back, but she was starving from the long wait. $30 for a dozen slimy old oysters. Gross. Next came the lobster and the fried clams. The lobster was perfect and my son gobbled it up. The fried clams on the other hand tasted like uncooked mush. It was a soggy pile of mushy nastiness. After one bite, I sent it back. \\n\\nNeither the waiter nor the manager made any attempts to apologize or smooth things over. They truly didn't care. They weren't even surprised.\\n\\nAnyway, this will be the last time my family visits this restaurant. \\n\\nSide note: we had called this restaurant a couple weeks ago and asked the host if the place was busy.

Or better yet, try thier flamming bananna dessert. Delivery for Thai Palate is fast and with good quality. The only con would be the parking situation. You have to park in the Camden deck and walk out, up, and around the corner to get to Thai Palate. Oh and a tip for the Camden deck is that you do no have to valet.

I'm writing this while waiting over 45 mins for my food during my 3rd trip to La Mongerie. During my first trip here I really enjoyed the food. So here are my experiences thus far:\\n\\nTrip 1: The waitress was extremely inattentive to my girlfriend and I as customers. The wait for food to come out of the kitchen was a bit long, but not terrible. Great food and poor service.\\n\\nTrip 2: We were simply told there weren't any grits because the chef hadn't made a batch yet. The potatoes were too hard. We made mention of that and they took them back and heated them up more. It only made them hotter not softer. On this particular day there seemed to be an abundance of gnats as well. In addition to that they were handling stocking during store hours in clear view of the customer. Also, the toilet was out of order.\\n\\nTrip 3: Much more attentive service staff, but the wait for food was miserable. We waited about 50 minutes for food. The food was great with the exception of the shrimp, that my girlfriend ordered, it seemed to be a bit overcooked. I was very satisfied with my food. The server was nice, but clearly inexperienced. He apologized profusely for the wait time and then we waited 15 minutes for our bill.\\n\\nThis place has so much potential, but clearly management is doing a bang up job hiring staff and running the place. May I suggest more cook staff, an experienced wait staff, and a way to rid the place of those damn gnats?!?!"},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The only reason I am rating Schmidt's one star is that I can't rate a zero. It's that bad. First, a little backstory:\\n\\nI was visiting a friend in Ohio, and she's never had German cuisine. She lives in Dayton, and the only real German options were either across the river in Kentucky, or up in Columbus. Since her father is in Columbus, Columbus it was. Now, due to religious reasons, she can't eat pork. That means the sausages are off the menu. But I've eaten plenty of German; there SHOULD be other options. We check the menu, and they offer sauerbraten. Since that's one of my favorite dishes, we have a battle plan.\\n\\nWe drive out there, and we're seated quickly. Menus are presented, and we order the soft pretzels and the strawberry fizz. Both come out quickly. So far, so good. My friend depletes her drink, and is looking for another. Our waitress is about five feet from us, making a table with another waitress (why it takes two waitresses to set a table is beyond me), and doesn't even bother to look over at us. We have to call her over, and order the drink. Down to 4 stars, because the place wasn't that busy. There's no reason you shouldn't be looking over to make sure things are good on your table, especially when you're five feet away.\\n\\nThen, the food. The main entree, and sides. The sauerkraut comes out...served cold. Why someone would serve a cold kraut with a dinner entree is beyond me. My potato pancakes side...well, true German potato pancakes are decently sized, decently thick. These were...what you'd get if you squashed a tater tot. So thin I couldn't lift one without it breaking, and calling them 2 inches across would be generous. There were a whopping four of these, as the side. I would have gotten more potato in a fricking McDonald's hash brown. By an order of magnitude. Flavorwise, all I taste is onion, when I bite one. This is embarassment. The spaetzle....everyone knows spaetzle. It's small, soft, and usually awash in a pleasant flavored liquid, whether that's butter or gravy. These? These are practically quarter-inch cubes of dough, that are HARD and practically crunchy. I honestly thought they put breakfast potatoes on my plate. And then the sauerbraten. Should be marinated, soft, and again, awash in gravy. This stuff is as tough as old shoe-leather. Tough, chewy, and DRY. And so little gravy on it that it doesn't even cover all the meat. Overcooked, just like the spaetzle.\\n\\nWe start in on the food. The cold kraut is practically unedible. It's cold, and the cabbage is stringy. The potato pancakes tasted of nothing but onion. And the sauerbraten was so overcooked and dry I could barely get it down. I ate my portion (diabetic; I really didn't have the option to NOT eat), but my friend barely touched hers. We went through our drinks, trying to choke down this dry meat. Again, our waitress has to be flagged down to bring drinks, despite not being busy; she just can't be bothered to look at us.\\n\\nNever once does our waitress ask us how our food is. No manager or front of house comes over to ask how our food is. We finish, and ask for the check. The waitress asks if we want a box, to which we answer an emphatic NO. (Another red flag that should have tripped, especially when seeing how much of my friend's portion was left.)\\n\\nFor the \\"privilege\\" of this horrible food and service? $45.00. I felt HORRIBLY ripped off. For 45 dollars and two people, I expect a memorable meal. Not a near-twenty dollar plate of shoe leather.\\n\\nIf you're looking for real German food, don't go here. If you're looking for good service, don't go here. If you're looking for tasty food, don't go here. If you want to have sausage and mashed potatoes on a self-serve buffet for 15 dollars...well, I guess go there.\\n\\nI certainly won't be going back, and I consider it a horrible experience."},{"name":"Blue Ribbon Grill","address":"4006 Lavista Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"Really nice family hangout that appeals to locals for its great drinks, comfy atmosphere and good food.

We only got a chance to try a few things this time - but we're looking forward to going back for more.\\n\\nThe rundown - our favorite dish that day was the burrata which was served in a bowl with what I think were poached peaches, blueberries, granola.  It was a great starter!  We then had both the Phoebe's Benedict and the Fried Chicken.  The bene's were had perfectly cooked eggs on biscuits with thick cuts of smoked ham. Mmmm.  They paired that with some hashbrown casserole (which was like a mix between hashbrowns and potato salad - it was a scoop).  They even had some Yellowbird hot sauce you could get (we love Yellowbird!)  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and fried (came out piping hot!) and served with a bowl of goat cheese grits and pickled chiles (tasted home pickled to me) and some syrup.  We did also get a side add of a biscuit with some butter (ooo good stuff).  Really like their biscuits - they're square and so crumbly and seem light until you start chewing and then you get that nice doughy biscuity goodness.  Note though - it's $4 for a side biscuit so it's a bit of an add.\\n\\nSome observations - the place gets loud fast when it's full of people.  I think this has to do with the hard wall surfaces that are currently devoid of decorations.

Two rolls sort of like an egg roll with more bread like roll featuring noodles and veggies inside. Came wih two sauces like a tandoori sauce and salsa verde flair. Sorry i am too unfamiliar to give the right names. We liked this. Good quantity good flavor good value.\\n\\nThe salad arrived and honesty it didn't really seem tibetan by any regards. It was a red leaf lettuce with cranberries a couple avocado slices and two fried slices of eggplant and some nuts. Nothing bad nothing special probably worth the $10. \\n\\nUnfortunately the letdown was really in the main dish. We ordered a beef noodle soup. Similar to pho for most purposes. But the flavor was minimal and no i don't mean it was just not salty. It was just really bland. I really felt it was like a stock can soup. Portion was ok noodle and beef wise but minimal baby bok choi and onion, and for some reason there was broccoli in there despite not being on the menu (not a huge problem but was this from some other soup stock?) And where were the tomatoes? If this was as good as pho pasteur i would have been happy but at $15 for this it let us down big time.\\n\\nWe also tried the tibetan butter tea which i heara lot about. Not my cup of tea (pardon the pun) but again i don't know if its done right and i just dont like it or if it was poorly done.\\n\\nThe bathrooms were nice ans clean and the decor was interesting with minor incese some books and decorations.\\n\\nI would come again for the $10 lunch buffet to get an idea of what to try before coming again. looking at the other tables when we were leaving it seems dumpling and sauce meat wishes might have been the forte of the place and perhaps we picked the wrong dishes.\\n\\nSo nothing terrible, nothig really outstanding.

There was also a stand with a single 8.5x11 page menu, but only so many people can crowd around it at one time. After placing the initial crepe order, you follow it down the line Chipotle-style and you have some options for customization.

The glaze was pretty good and not overly sweet.

Still a somewhat cold donut, but vanilla pudding filling was good and it suited my taste.

We decided to finally go check out the infamous Gus's! We were on a time crunch. They were closing in an hour and we only paid for an hour of street parking. We walked in and there were quite a few tables lingering at the last hour but it wasn't packed or crazy busy. We were greeted by a guy that said we could sit anywhere on the back wall. \\n\\nWe sat down and looked at the menu trying to figure out how we were going to feast. I was beginning to get that uncomfortable feeling of not being greeted yet when a very young girl came to us to took our drink order. We both got sweet tea duh. She left and we continued analyzing the menu. We finally decided on what we were going to order and we patiently waited for our teas...and we waited and waited. I was seated facing the entire restaurant where I could see the wait staff at the counter and kitchen. I was getting really pissed off because we didn't receive our sweet teas yet. The 12 year old (The very young server. That's what she looked liked) kept visiting (well really flirting) the table next to us and completely had lack of concern that we had been sitting there waiting for our drinks and willing her to take our order. A guy at the counter could see my irritation from across the restaurant and came over to check on us. He brought over our drinks and took our order. He profusely apologized and offered us a free dessert. I noticed that he spoke to our server before she returned to our table. The rest of the time we were there was so awkward with the 12 year old server. She brought over our food and apologized for the rocky start and ensured us that she was there for us and to let her know if we needed anything. \\n\\nFood is so good! Hubby got 2 piece white meat with fries with seasoned fries. I got the 2 piece dark meat plate with baked beans and slaw. The chicken was so crispy and hot! It was freshly made. The crispy, slightly salty and spicy skin was so good. The meat was moist and juicy. Baked beans and slaw were a little on the sweet side but it was a nice balance to the heat hot and spicy hot chicken. Sweet tea to wash it all down was perfect. Dessert...we didn't get any. I was full enough however if they were going to fulfill their end of the deal with free dessert I wasn't going to refuse. We really enjoyed our food but can't get over the fact that the service was lacking. The price is great also! We will definitely be back and I hope that the service is better.

Our server was with us almost immediately, and our waters were kept full at all times.\\n\\nI had heard rave reviews from a friend about FLIP's \\"fried burger\\" (the country-fried \\"Southern\\" burger), so I tried that.  My husband had the \\"FLIP\\" burger with a country-fried patty.  I was scared that we'd get an attitude for asking for substitutions, but our server was totally nice about it.  We also ordered sides (I had the sweet potato tots and my husband had the onion rings).\\n\\nAll of our food was delicious, the portions were fine for the price but not ridiculously huge.  The prices were much more reasonable than I expected--around 8-12 bucks for a  burger.  At some places, you pay this price and get an enormous burger.  Here, you are paying for flavor, creativity, and artistry, not size. \\n\\nWe really wanted to try the milkshakes, but we were too full to have dessert that early in the day.

We asked if we could sit and have a drink at the bar (which was empty), she seemed hesitant, but finally said, 'I think so'.  Another staff then gave us a table not more than a minute after we sat down.  The dineout menu looked very appetizing, but was not very clear if we had to all choose the same starter and main to share, or if that was just the suggestion.  We sat for 10 mins without anyone coming to our assistance, luckily the next table explained it.  Our first waitress never bothered, though I saw another waiter do an excellent job of that, so it's just a bit inconsistent.  Our tom yum koong came out with undercooked prawns (they were translucent) our server was quick to address that but said the chef says they were cooked, but they will make us a new one.  The second bowl came out the same, prawns were translucent and texture did not feel cooked, we were going to just have it but skip the soup, but our server noticed and offered to bring us something else.  We tried the tom kaa gai, it was tasty and the soup was considerably hotter in temp than the other one, perhaps that is why the prawns.  The rest of the dishes were solid, the panaeng curry was a bit too sweet for my taste, the beef ribs were great, though the 'very spicy' special sauce the server warned about, was just very salty, not at all spicy, like it was just fish sauce with a hint of lime.\\n\\nOverall, the food was still very tasty, service was a bit inconsistent, with one really good server and others a bit off.

I agree with other reviewers suggesting that it would be helpful to have some pre-determined flavor combinations for the add-ons (but then allowing folks to customize if they so choose).   \\n\\nOne thing that doesn't really help with the functionality is the design of the bar where you order--there's a wide wooden top to the bar, which helpfully keeps creeping hands away from where the food is prepared, but it also hides the toppings that I think you're maybe supposed to be able to look at and choose from.  While there is a window below the wood where you can theoretically see into the preparation area, it's pretty low down, and even if you crouch down to see through it, the angle makes it difficult to see what's available. \\n\\nI don't remember exactly what my dish was called, but it was one of the small plates--basically yogurt and Israeli salad that I dipped pieces of laffa in. The flavors were bright and fresh and it was VERY tasty! I also tried one of the handcrafted sodas (pineapple and thyme, perhaps?) which I wasn't crazy about, but my husband adored it.

The reviews looked promising and it was very close to where we were staying. For a Tuesday early afternoon the place was packed and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes before we were seated. There were a couple empty tables but they didn't seat people as the tables got empty, instead they waited until about 50% of the seats were empty then sat us down. I thought that was a little interesting. It made sense after because all the tables were pretty close together. It would be pretty annoying having to move the tables in the middle of a meal. \\n\\nWe ordered:\\n\\nLa Sant√© (soft boiled egg, vine ripened tomato, olive tapenade, avocado, prosciutto, extra virgin olive oil, grilled ciabatta) - I ordered it because I never had a soft boiled egg this way before. Everything together was really good, except for the olive tapenade. I'm not a huge fan of olives. The soft boiled egg was cooked to perfection and it was a fun experience for me to crack it open. \\n\\nSaumon Fum√© (open faced ciabatta sandwich. Fried egg, smoked salmon caper cream cheese, sliced avocado, arugula peppadew and artichoke salad) - smoked salmon was nice and fresh and the caper cream cheese was a good balance.\\n\\nWaffle with dark chocolate sauce - these Belgian waffles looked exactly like these waffles that I LOVE in Lake Tahoe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/eurosnack-truckee) unfortunately the taste wasn't the same. They were a little more dense than I expected. The dark chocolate sauce was really rich and I liked that. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good but I think it was a little on the pricey side for the amount of food that you get. Service was nice and friendly. I would have loved to come back and try their dinner menu. It didn't occur to me by the name of the restaurant that it was a Moroccan place. I'll have to save that for another trip."},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Our meal was great.

We sampled some other classics like patatas bravas and empanadas which also met our expectations - well prepared, hot, and tasty.\\n\\nThe wine list is extensive and covers the globe. I was surprised to see so many non-Spanish offerings. We chose a rioja from Lopez de Heredia that was reasonably priced for what it is.\\n\\nService was kind and responsive.

I was really looking forward to the Kobe beef hamburger and was disappointed to find it has been changed to \\"Northwestern\\" beef, which technically could even be from an old ground up Tillamook dairy cow so they might want to clarify. There was not a real price drop however to reflect the downgrade and the burger was still $10 and did not come with fries or salad. The burger was not bad, but I had to order some mayo as it didn't appear to have any and there was a lack of veggies to add on. No tomato, no fresh onion, just a thin piece of lettuce and 2 razor thin pickle slices. Under the cheese was a thin slice of sauteed onion. So if you like your burgers rather plain, but expensive, this one is for you. And no I could not detect any added flavor from the duckfat if that is what they actually used. \\n\\nThe friend I was drinking with ordered the rueben so I tried a bite. It was interesting... Thick cut corned beef and very tender. It just had an odd flavor which I think was from the spice mix they use for curing. This guy orders ruebens whenever we pub crawl and I order them every now and then and both of us thought the flavor of the corned beef was very odd. \\n\\nSplit a side of fries and they were a monster size order and just outstanding, some of the best in town. Long, thin shoestring style and made from fresh potatoes. Prefectly cooked, but they only salt the tops so make sure you toss them before you eat them or you get a mouthfull of salt. Did NOT like their homemade ketchup (and I eat allot of ketchup at home) so I asked for aioli and it tasted just like the mayo (maybe there was a mix up in the kitchen). So I ate the fries plain and they were great!!\\n\\nAs for the beers, another disappointment. I drink primarily IPAs and this one I didn't even finish (we were pub hopping so a good one was just around the next corner). If you read one of the other reviewers below she states she \\"doesn't like IPAs, but liked this one\\". That kind of sums it up, if you do like IPAs avoid this version. Their Oatmeal Stout was very good, but the Apricot/Habanero brew neither tasted like apricots nor was spicy at all. It was just an odd beer. \\n\\nSo if they had better beer, I would probably come back for beer and fries, and if they dropped the price on the burger and added a few traditional veggies I might try that again. I do applaud the chef for his efforts in trying to keep allot of things homemade, but his/her tastes and my tastes just don't seem to be on the same wavelength. I will give them 3 stars however forall  their efforts and hope they can improve some things. ."},{"name":"Pekoe Sip House","address":"1225 Alpine Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I love the calm sensation; a lavender tea latte!

Management definitely needs to step up their standards, customer service is everything!! At least they got the food right. \\n\\nUpdate: \\nManagement reached out to me, and invited me back.

We had a 5:30 reservation which is early for us and for any other civilised diners but it was the only time I could get. I arrived early because I wanted to get away from the office and I waited at the bar until my wife showed up. One thing I do not like about the bar is the pathetic selection of draught beer. They only have Molson Canadian, Rickards, and Heineken. I am a craft beer lover and these choices make me want to go elsewhere.  \\n\\nWhen my wife arrived we got a table on the mezzanine with a view over the main floor. The interior design is very chic. The good table helped ease the irritation from the beer selection.  I opted for the dine-out menu and my wife went a-la-carte. The food, as always, was excellent. Coast is arguably the best seafood restaurant in town. The service at Coast is quite good. They appear to have a higher than average ratio of service staff to customers.

So generous, amazing service, and way above and beyond considering we didn't even wait an hour.\\n- He sent over baskets of hot bread, a delicious cheese board loaded with cheese, a perfectly cooked hanger steak, and roasted potatoes.

The biggest con is that the portions were smaller than expected based on the price we paid. My SO and I ordered several different plates from Myers+Chang's Dim Sum brunch menu:\\n¬†\\n-Spicy Cold Dan Dan Noodles: This was my favorite dish overall. Didn't think I would prefer the Dan Dan noodles cold, but it tasted delicious and had a bit of a kick to it, but was still manageable if you're not a spicy food person.¬†\\n¬†\\n-Salt+Pepper Calamari: I thought the calamari was tasty as well. I appreciated the flakiness of the breading. My only issue was the portion size. I thought I'd get something a little larger. The calamari itself is pretty small. I probably could have finished the bowl by myself with room for a lot more. If you're here with a group of people I'd probably get a few bowls of this so everyone is able to have a decent portion.\\n¬†\\n-Hakka Eggplant: This was a bit on the oily side, but I loved it!¬†\\n¬†\\n-Mama Chang's Pork + Chive: Pretty standard dumplings to me. I thought $8 was a little pricey for only 3 dumplings.\\n¬†\\n-Nirvana Chicken Congee: I didn't really like the congee all too much.

Probably wouldn't get it again.\\n¬†\\n-Wild Board Dan Dan Noodles: if you want something that is really meaty then definitely order the Wild Board Dan Dan noodles.

The main reason why my rating is so low is because of poor service. At any restaurant one would assume that the customer is the number one priority. Ikenohana fails to recognize this. Every time my girlfriend and I go to dine we are never greeted right away. In fact, there have been many times where we would not be acknowledged for an unreasonable amount of time. The waitresses would talk amongst themselves and look at us but would try to avoid eye contact. The restaurant is a fairly small establishment so seating a customer should not be that difficult. One particular time we finally were greeted and sat down after about twenty minutes. It then took another thirty minutes for us to place an order. We were seated before a table next to us but for some reason they got their order in long before we did. Even after placing our order we did not receive water for quite some time. \\n\\nTo put the nail in the coffin, the wait is never worth it. In fact, it makes me wonder how Ikenohana has such a high rating. The food is just average. Average may even be pushing it. The only thing I enjoy is the tempura udon because the portion size, broth, and it is hard to mess up tempura. Also there aren't very many places to get decent udon in the area. The sushi is NOT worth the money. The sushi chefs slice the fish into very thin portions. I would rather go to Murata and spend the money for higher quality fish that also has thick cuts of sushi. The sushi rice also tends to crumble when the sushi is picked up. This is a clear sign that the quality is not that great.

We had driven a ways to get there and wanted to try it. We put our name on the list and began our wait.\\nThe three of us sat on the couch watching baseball on the bar TV and passed the time by looking over the delicious menu. After we had been sitting quite some time, the young lady who had put us on the list came over and offered us complimentary roasted nuts and apologized for the wait. There had been some guests camping at their table long after they had finished. She offered to start our drink orders which agreed to. \\nBefore we could even get our drinks a different table opened up and they had us seated immediately.

For this staff to maintain that level of service on an extremely busy Friday night shows that it is natural to them and is something you can expect to receive when you choose to dine here.\\nI have a belief about customer service and it played out here. You can go somewhere and have a meal. everything could go right and be exactly what you expected and you feel that it was decent. On the other side of the coin you could go somewhere and it doesn't go quit right. It is in those moments that you see how the business reacts to the challenge and overcomes the obstacle that could make you have a bad experience. Those are the moments, that when overcome well, creates a customer that will be more loyal, tells their friends and family and will return time and time again.  They also will be inclined to tell the masses by leaving a review as I have done here.\\nThey could have let us sit alone on that couch, not acknowledged our wait time, not apologized repeatedly, not have been so friendly and personable on a busy Friday night, not checked in every 5-10 minutes, but they didn't.

My dish was, without a doubt, the saltiest food I have ever tasted (it should be known that I LOVE salt, but this had WAY too much). The \\"broth\\" the mussels came in was more like a brine. I literally felt like a horse at a salt lick every time I took a bite. The chicken was also over-salted (but not as bad) and the vegetables were ironically bland.

The manfriend is planning on dominating (and, it is implied, totally \\"wowing\\" the crowd with his mad Super Nintendo skillz) the next time his little brother visits. Sure, honey. Sure.\\n\\nGreat service. Very friendly. It gets pretty packed, so try to get there before the dinner rush or be prepared to wait (it does have a surprisingly fast turn over.) A limited but good beer selection (especially considering the lack of space.) A looooooooot of Maker's Mark. It looks like that's all they offer... a whole shelf of Maker's Mark... surely not, though - right? Eh... [EDIT: I asked about the Maker's Mark the last time I went. They said since they just opened and didn't know how popular the bar would be, they figured Maker's Mark was a good, versatile liquor to start with. Apparently they make some great drinks with it, but I'm a beer girl. :) ]\\n\\nAnyway, a little pricey but definitely worth it. I mean, it is FANCY pizza, you know? The pizza is rather small but filling - I'd suggest a couple either split an app and a pizza, or just get two pizzas and know you'll have some leftovers.\\n\\nDon't let this shut down like the Bearded Pig... although that was due to smoke complaints from the neighborsANYWAY just go.\\n\\n(Also, they're kid friendly! I've seen plenty of little ones with their parents here and the servers were very accommodating.

I'm not sure if there were any \\"Western\\" or \\"European\\" flavors thrown in except to say that all dishes were somewhat Americanized probably for the target audience.\\n\\nBefore saying more about the food, I want to point out the welcoming atmosphere and the friendly service. Both were greatly appreciated. We were seated at the counter facing the open kitchen.\\n\\nMama Chang's pork and chive dumplings were just okay. The exterior skin was on the thick side and there was ample filling. They were probably pan fried, but the skin wasn't particularly crispy.\\n\\nThe braised pork belly buns were flavorful but too salty. I suspect that both the meat was salted and then the soy based sauce was extra salty as well. The meat itself was tender and fatty (rightfully so), and would've stood on its own while letting the soy sauce add the salted flavor.\\n\\nNasi goreng, aka Indonesian fried rice, had some heat to it. The dish in Indonesia tends to be very basic (in all the good ways) without being too salty or spicy. From what I recall, the locals tend to flavor the rice however they prefer. We had the dish without pineapple, so I'm sure the flavor profile was a bit different compared to what it was meant to be. It didn't remind me of nasi goreng I've had in Indonesia, and I would venture to say that it tasted like its own dish."},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I cannot begin to tell you how delicious my experience at Navarre was.

I have yet to be disappointed in a drink and it is probably the best coffee I've had since moving to Austin.\\n\\nThe food is pretty good and pretty sizable, and best of all, there are some great vegetarian options. I've ordered the Terra Taco most often and that thing fills you up. I know it's huge, but definitely fold it up and it as a taco. Any other way doesn't do the flavors justice.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is great for hanging out with friends. It's lively and comfortable. Unfortunately this means that Cherrywood isn't the best plae to take a book and read. They have my favorite chair is the world , but even supreme physical comfort doesn't save me from the loud and sometimes bizarre music that plays all day and all evening.\\n\\nThe complaints:\\nService isn't overly friendly, which doesn't bother me much in general. However, I was once there with my friends and we could not hear each other speak over the club-loud music and when I asked the girl behind the counter to please turn it down a bit, she sighed and didn't respond. And then she didn't turn it down. This is the only time that the service has really annoyed me. \\n\\nAlso, the room to your right when you walk in is very badly lit and there aren't enough lamps to make up for that problem once the sun sets.\\n\\nOverall, love it, but would definitely go somewhere else if I wanted to read in peace."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Best BBQ in the state.

Perhaps it was that mysterious unami of which people speak - I don't know.\\n\\nThe level of service I received corresponded with their level of busy-ness.  When I first arrived, I was one of few.  And my server checked in with me with pleasant regularity.  When I exited, my water glass had been empty for quite a while, and there was a wait for a table at 6pm.  Having neighbors such as Symphony Hall and Huntington Theater will do that to you.\\n\\nAt $4.99, the  Hand-Breaded Zucchini Chips seemed an easy add on to my Chicken Spinoccoli Pasta (A rolled chicken breast filled with mozzarella, feta, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, garlic and basil with penne in pesto alfredo and chunky tomato sauce) $14.99 dinner.  It also turned out to be the more satisfying part of the meal with its crisp salty coating covering the hot tender squash.\\n\\nNothing was precising \\"wrong\\" with the pasta - the penne just south of al dente, the chicken tender, all the ingredients were there... but it just seemed... plain.  It didn't make my mouth happy though it filled the tummy just fine.  Having had my fill, I still had just under half left over.\\n\\nTemptation was garnered by their well placed ads featuring both a pleasant picture of a dainty treat and an easy on the pocketbook price.  I nearly ordered dessert to satisfy my sweet tooth, but my excess minutes expired as I observed my server tackling two tables before me.\\n\\nI paid with a gift card, and they let me have the tip taken off it as well, which was nice.\\n\\n3 stars.\\n\\n*** 9/2015 ***\\n\\nSpinoccoli PIZZA is back in the house! ($11.99/$19.99)\\n\\nFor those who have no idea of which I speak, Unos used to have a deep dish pizza filled with spinach and broccoli florets, which had a great taste and a great bite.  Yum!  My favorite of Uno's concoctions... well, maybe except for their pizza skins app.\\n\\nI sampled their Jumbo Onion Rings $7.99, and they were big and hot and crispy.  Actually they were quite good.  I also tasted their Ridiculously Awesome, Insanely Large Chocolate Cake $8.99 and have to admit it was a really good cake.  Chocolatey, moist, not overly sweet.\\n\\nI love that they have a selection of Mini Sweets on their dessert menu for $2.59 and am tempted to order one of those on a future visit.\\n\\nObtaining the attention of a server was initially slow, till I discovered the Call Server option on the Ziosk station they now have set at each table.\\n\\n3.5 stars.\\n\\n*** 10/2016 ***\\n\\nYou can pay at the table kiosk, just not with a gift card.\\n\\nTheir Granny Smith All American $5.99 (apple crisp) arrived in a mug topped with two full scoops of vanilla ice cream.  The apple crisp itself beneath the whipped cream and ice cream was served warm (not hot) but was a rather thin layer of the stuff.  Fine for one. But I wonder how much less crisp you would get for the $2.99 mini version with its likely single scoop.  It was tasty, but the crispness was lost beneath the dairy embellishments.\\n\\nUno's has a kids menu.  It isn't listed on the printed menus, but it is posted online and on the kiosk.  They have a Pick a Pasta with Chicken $5.49 where you can choose the pasta, sauce, and optional veggie add on's.  The Alfredo linguine with roasted vegetables was a nice portion for a light appetite with a good number of tender chicken chunks, and a relative healthy choice for your young one 12 and under, though the marinara would have been a healthier sauce.\\n\\n*** 4/2017 ***\\n\\nThe side of Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Bacon $3.29 was a bit disappointing with only 5 of the mini cabbage balls sliced in half and given a cursory baking in the oven and a sprinkle of bacon bits that accompanied the vegetable but did not infuse it with any added flavor.\\n\\nA Not-So Mini Sweets Granny Smith All American $2.99 was quite mini, at perhaps a third the portion of the full dessert at half the price.\\n\\nService was not the best, as my water did not arrive till I asked for it - same for the refill - and when I asked for the bill, I got it, but did not get a return visit to handle the payment till I tracked my server down."},{"name":"Newk's Eatery","address":"1405 Spring Rd SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3","text":"First, the place is always filthy...hard to find a clean table.

Nope, not even a chance.  It was decided that these were the best donuts EVER.\\n\\nSo good that we went back three times in the span of 4 days...\\n\\nThese are donuts with an irresistible, fluffy brioche base and classy ingredients, guys.  (I was fooled into thinking that their blackberry compote with peanut butter toppings was more than a PB&J doughnut remake)  Oddly enough, my personal favorites are the cream filled ones: valhrona chocolate crunch and meyer lemon were so good!!  Blackberry bourbon basil was an intriguing medley of ingredients and they do it well.  \\n\\niDevour.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that during the afternoon hours when we visited the first time (5pm), the selection was limited to three doughnut varieties.  During the morning hours (10am), full selection and a long line to match!  \\n\\nDefinitely pair your Blue Star doughnut selection with some good 'ol Stumptown Coffee.

I was disappointed to learn that Cheap Date Monday is actually not that cheap!  $40 for five small dishes?  Eh - so my date and I decided to order our own dishes - which turned out to be cheaper.  We ordered the miso glazed carrots (yumm!), Coconut Soup (creamy!), edamame slaw (mama mia!) and Dan Dan Noodles(muy caliente)!  The star dish, however, came last and it was AMAZING!

But why not try Taiwanese food where the Chef is renowned for his \\"champion beef noodles.\\"\\n\\nIt's located on the 2nd floor of Aberdeen Centre and you are greeted by a funny and memorable mechanical contraption - a pair of chopsticks picking up some noodles from a full bowl. Hilarious - I even took a picture. There was about a 10 minute wait around 1 pm on Saturday. It wasn't that bad as there's a glass divider where you can stare at the staff who are making the fresh noodles and other Taiwanese dishes. And of course, you can stare at the mechanical noodle bowl too.\\n\\nDecor is modern with some Asian touches and there's even a private dining room in the back. You order your food via a menu sheet that's left at your table - just check off what type of food you want and you can specific the type of noodle and the type of soup (spicy or not) you want. \\n\\nWe started with the beef wrapped in crispy pancake ($5.95), which is wrapped in this thin crepe like roll with marinated beef, hoisin sauce, cucumbers and scallions. Like one reviewer noted, it is reminiscent of the peking duck wraps. You get 8 large cut up portions which is a lot to eat even though it's in the \\"snack\\" category. Definitely share with a lot of people or plan to take some home for another meal. I would order this dish again - it was surprisingly good.\\n\\nThen we tried the cold mixed jelly fish ($4.50) which was dressed with the usual sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar. The flavour was nice but very similar to the jellyfish that I've tried before. Though I wish they would have sliced the jellyfish in smaller and more equal proportions. Some strips were easier to chew than others. \\n\\nThen came the star of the meal, the Champion beef shank with noodle in spicy soup ($10.95). I chose the fresh noodles that are made in house because the noodle looked intriguing to me. The fresh noodles are flat but thicker than regular noodles I've tasted. The noodles almost had an Italian pasta like texture and taste even though it's made from rice and not semolina. There was a slight chew, almost el dente texture. Noodles were really unique and I enjoyed it. It also included 3 beef shanks and 3 thin slices of medium rare beef. The beef shank was tender and flavourful but I actually preferred the sliced beef more. I really enjoyed the fire chili soup (though you can get the clear broth) - it's spicy and has that very slight numbing sensation. The broth was delicious though I don't know if I could finish all that broth on my own. The portion was pretty big as I couldn't finish my bowl especially after the other dishes I tried. If you're not that hungry, maybe split the noodles and share the appetizers to get a broad taste of Taiwanese food in one try.\\n\\nI would go back this place because the flavours were all very strong and memorable."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Good eats for a slightly heftier price than a typical dim sum brunch. \\n\\nFood (4/5): The food was good, for a group of 3, we got the Hakka Eggplant (one of my faves), Mama Chang's Pork + Chive Dumplings (kind of pricey for the fact that we only got 3 dumplings for the price of $7, meaning each was a little over $2?!), Sweet Potato Chip, and Braised Pork Belly Buns (delicious but $5/ bun is hefty). I truly enjoyed the flavor and taste of each dish, but none of them were mind-blowing amazing and I thought each dish was a bit overpriced (especially the dumplings and the buns).\\n\\nService (5/5): Our server was amazing, she was sweet, checked in on us, and made nice conversation that I appreciated - got some good tips on shopping haha. \\n\\nSetting (4/5): the place was nice and clean, a bit smaller than expected but chic.
