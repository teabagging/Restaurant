The vibe is right up my ally (flannel city) and I'm so stoked there's finally a place that does southern food right in Boston!  \\n\\nCame here for brunch with a couple of friends and I can confidently say that we'll be back!  To start, we had the skillet cornbread.  The *only* reason why this is a 4 star review instead of 5 is that we didn't know we were being charged for the cornbread. Our server came to the table and asked if she could get us any cornbread or biscuits to start..we were under the impression that this was to be the complimentary bread in the beginning of the meal--after getting the bill we discovered that wasn't the case. But anyway, it was so good that I decided to let that go. The cornbread was served with green onions over the top..which I was a bit weary of at first, but after trying it, I immediately understood the genius.  I forget the name of the drink I ordered, but it was a prosecco drink that was served with a slice of peach.  I don't normally order alcohol with my food, but this was perfect to sip on.  For my main, I had to get the chicken and waffles.  Unfortunately, I've only ever had \\"chicken and waffles\\" in the sad form of a few chicken tenders on top of a sad waffle. SO NOT THE CASE HERE. The chicken was fried perfectly and was still so juicy. I also loveee the spice you get from the sliced peppers on top balanced out with the sweetness of the maple syrup.  Oh man.

Then we sat down to eat in a literal garage (how innovative ). We decided to get the chefs tasting menu which we learned was not a tasting menu but instead food from the regular restaurant menu. It took 2 1/2 hours for us to get 5 courses of food which was really annoying considering it's food they know how to make. Unfortunately, each of us had to share these courses instead of having our own plates. This was annoying and made for the smallest portions ever for the price (approx $80/person!). The food was ok but not $80/person worthy. Last, they told us that we had our food paid for! Somehow, they had made a mistake and called us to let us know of it. We weren't even angry with that. We had a fantastic waitress that made our day special despite all of this!\\n\\nTLDR: This restaurant overcharges for basic food. $80/person is outrageous especially considering that the quality and quantity was low.

It's almost, in and of itself, a perfect representation of Portland: conscientious hipster sensibilities, delightfully bizarre, an unreasonably long wait, and perhaps a bit overrated even though it's pretty damn good.  A lot of people talk about the weird flavors and yeah, they are pretty weird.  I tried a sample of the bleu cheese and pear, assuming the cheese would be used in the creaming process, more for texture than flavor.  Nope!  It definitely had a big old chunk of bleu cheese right in the ice cream.  It actually didn't taste terrible, but it was a little too strange for me.  In the end, I settled on a half scoop each of honey lavender and salted caramel.  Even the relatively ordinary salted caramel wasn't quite the same as what I'd normally expect of that flavor -- much heavier on the salt than you'd normally find, which I actually found a pleasant and intriguing surprise.  The honey lavender was good, but a little bit off in texture, more icy than creamy, almost more like a gelato (which I'm not a fan of).

The bacon strips in the omelet were too big, I would have preferred the bacon be chopped up and more ingrained in the eggs than separate from them. Home fries were well-spcied.

I'm not really a fan of rhubard, but the flavors melded really well in the clafoutis.  The whipped cream had just the right amount of sweetness, and the piece of maple glazed bacon (which topped the dish) was the first thing to go.  Overall a great tasting dish.\\n\\n2nd Course:  Beast Hash - Maple-Brined Pork Loin, Market Potatoes, Romanesco, Maitake Mushrooms, Haikuri Turnips, Brussels Rapini and a Poached Egg with Hollandaise.  *I thought this was good, but not great, like I hoped.  Egg was poached perfectly and everything went well together, but I felt it needed more seasoning (or maybe I should have added salt and pepper - who knows?).  But it was a good dish nonetheless - it just fell a little short.\\n\\n3rd Course:  Three types of cheese (I have now forgotten what kind of cheese) and Farm Greens with Aged Sauvignon Blanc Vinaigrette.  *The cheese was very good (very small pieces though) but my greens were a little wilted and had too much vinaigrette.\\n\\n4th course:  Dark Chocolate Stout Cake with Creme Chantilly.  *One of my friends commented that it looked like a Ding Dong - which it did.  The cake was good, but very rich, and I couldn't eat all of it (which shocked even me).\\n\\nOverall, I thought it was good, but I was expecting something better (especially for the fixed price - $35 per person).  \\n\\nService was good, and the atmosphere is nice (they only seat around 30 people, with one smaller table at the front of the restaurant and a longer one on the side, in front of the kitchen).

Perfect pillowy interior, slightly shiny on top with what might've been a light egg glaze, and delicate crusty exterior. \\n- Bayou Tacos had great flavor. I've had more tender chicken-like gator than the lean meat in this taco, but the flavor itself was scrumptious--slightly vinegary, sweet, with a kick of spice from thinly sliced hot peppers. The black beans were not overcooked. I'm not sure if the super lean texture of the gator is due to the long cooking process.\\n- Georgia's Salad had decent flavor overall and was fortunately not overdressed like most salads, although I tasted more of the cheddar than the honey-lime dressing. The salad could've used 30% more pork rinds to maintain the \\"perfect bite\\" forkful ratio.\\n\\nService: 4 stars. \\n- Our server was friendly, knowledgeable (considering it was opening weekend), gave good suggestions, and welcomed constructive criticism. There was some confusion on which customers ordered what dishes because of the bar-table setup; this is something that needs to be improved on.\\n\\nAmbiance: 5 stars\\n- Great addition to a side of Assembly that used to be too quiet. The dishware was adorable. I enjoyed the lighting fixtures, massive ceiling fans, muted colors, and eclectic texture of woods, bricks, tiles, and metals. If they add a couple of small outdoor tables, I could bring my dog while I partake in day drinking. The noise level was manageable, although I feel like all these kinds of restaurants can benefit from some ceiling canvases for noise absorption.\\n\\nValue: 3 stars for food; 4 stars for booze. \\n- Drink prices appear standard. Most cocktails were $10. We saw many people enjoying batch \\"Southern Hospitality\\" cocktails, which looked like a good value to split between 4 people for $38, even with the large amount of ice.\\n- The 3 gator tacos ($13) had sufficient fillings, but each taco itself looked like a child's plaything. Big enough to choke on if consumed in one bite, small enough to make an adult look foolish for fiddling with it.\\n- Biscuits were on the slightly more expensive side ($7), but they were so wonderfully executed that I'd go back just to order them as a decadent snack.\\n- The salad was a satisfactory size for $9, although it could've used more pork rinds.

I'm scared to go to sleep after having a late dinner here. Scared that I will have recurring nightmares of the food. For the second time in my life, I was served an entire meal that was pretty much inedible. 5 of us went in with completely open minds and stomachs. We left with empty wallets, empty stomachs and in utter disbelief. Let's start with the atmosphere. Cute, I understand where they were trying to go with it. I don't think it's at all the uber steampunk vibe everyone keeps talking about. It's very subtle, but still nice in a sense. Music was so loud that it was impossible to carry on a conversation without the \\"what?\\", \\"sorry, I didn't catch that\\", \\"what'd he say?\\".  Now, for the horrifying experiments that were done on helpless food. Plate #1: Kimchi Sampler - eh, daikon kimchi was okay. zucchini kimchi had a very off putting taste to it and the napa cabbage kimchi was very eh as well. Plate #2: Shishito peppers - the only edible part of the entire meal. It's a chargrilled shishito pepper. How can you mess it up? It's the same as every other place I've had them. I would've eaten more, had I known what was in store as the meal progressed. Plate #3: Caesar Salad - Um, what? What part of that salad was considered caesar? First you take some kale, which can be difficult to start. Burn the holy living hell out of that so it takes on nothing but  char flavor. Top that with a \\"dressing\\" that had no discernible caesar flavor, or flavor of anything you would willingly top a salad with. Then take a  fish that's known for it's very strong and pungent flavor so it's usually served in smaller amounts (aka silver fish  or sardine) and plop an ENTIRE fried one on top. Mmmmm, super pungent fish garnished with burnt kale. Plate #4: Scallop dish -  Maine Scallops aren't fresh right now, so you're being served frozen. (I was dining with a seafood purveyor, so pretty certain of this!) This was a most oddly contrived dish. At this point I truly thought I had walked into a restaurant on \\"Kitchen Nightmares\\". Unfortunately for me, this was a dining room nightmare. Cucumber sorbet with raw scallop atop a spicy  pepper preserve. Not one component of this horribly plated dish, made any sense. Light delicate scallop, with a melting sorbet leaving a liquidy watery mess to blend with the pepper preserve. Did anybody bother to try this dishes out first? Plate #5: Duck wings - my husband, who is a proclaimed and well known salt-ophile, could barely stomach these. He said it was so salty that you couldn't even eat them. (I'm pregnant and salt isn't sitting well with me currently, so I passed on these). Plate #6: Tater tot casserole dish - lacking any imagination or flavor other than a burnt oil flavor. One tot was way more than enough for anybody at our table. Plate #7: Foie gras/pork belly banh mi - holy crap this was disgusting! Tasted like a nice mouthful of pork fat and grease slathered on a raw oyster. This dish literally turned my stomach. Eating bugs, no problem. Offal, line it up. This dish? Put this dish on Fear Factor my friends. Plate #8: Chicken Meatballs - unanimously considered to be by far the absolute worst thing served tonight. Chicken is usually a pretty bland protein. Seems as though they knew this and decided to stick with it's natural bland property and just serve it deep fried with a sauce(?) that we were daring each other to eat. It was a sauce so horrible, you would think one had to have spent time pondering \\"what is perhaps, the grossest things I can put together and serve? Answer: squid ink, rice vinegar and nori all blended together. Sweet heavens to Betsy this was so bad, I'm surprised the baby growing inside of me didn't abort itself from the abuse I was causing it by feeding it these things! Plate #9: Venison Kebabs - sweet! Something I know can't be messed up. I grew up eating venison. It's awesome prepared in the simplest manner. We all took one bite and asked, could this really be venison? How could someone do this to Bambi? Dear Bambi, I'm sorry your family has been disgraced like this. My sincerest sympathies. As one of our party said at the end, \\"The best part of this meal? That it's over!\\" Cheers to that! Our server asked if we'd like dessert. No, no thank you! By now we had considered ourselves lucky to have made it this far with no serious illness. We'll pass. Besides, panna cotta served with a sorbet? On top? Really? As a former Pastry Chef, that's rule 101. Now, I'm sure all these amazing descriptions just have you dying to try it out. We were dying to get out! And at $400 for the 5 of us, I at least should have gotten a t-shirt that said \\"I survived the food at Swift's Attic\\"."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My girlfriends and I had a weekend in Boston last week and this place was our fancy dinner out. Overall I would say it was FANTASTIC and would definitely recommend it to any meat, cheese and wine lover. \\n\\nLet me start by saying that I hate when I don't understand what is on a menu. I go out to eat often, not always in super fine establishments, but I'm not at The Olive Garden. I feel like I'm a little smart and somewhat hip, and I hate feeling like an idiot. When I am out, I want to be comfortable, not intimated. So, if you must use fancy words on your menu, at least describe what the dish is in the description. I went to college, and I don't know what the F a Taliatelle is. (I found out later that it is very fancy Hamburger Helper) My number one and only gripe about this place is the language on the menu. The atmosphere is super laid back and the food is great, so why be pretentious? \\n\\nWhat made ordering so much less intimidating? Our amazing waiter Matthew! We were smart enough to ask him what everything was on the menu and what he recommended. He went thorough his favorite things and it was great! We started off with meat, cheeses and pates. The cheese was AMAZING. We just asked for Matthew's 3 favorites from each category. I'm really not a pate person, but the lamb was pretty good. We decided to order 5 or 6 things from the menu and just share everything. This is the way to go. The MUST HAVES are the Hot Dog (a fat and juicy pork dog resting on a grilled buttery roll, topped with krout and served with homemade chips. It's what dreams are made of.) and The Parmesan Agnolotti. (pasta filled with cheesy goodness, topped with a light brown sauce, tasty mushrooms and tiny homemade meatballs. AMAZING!) \\n\\nNow for the dreaded bill, which turned out not to be dreadful at all! There were five of us (the bill was split four ways) We got a bottle of wine, a meat and pate plate, 3 cheeses, 2 appetizers, a hot dog, an entr√©e, a mixed green salad and a side of saut√©ed spinach... and paid $64 per person. YAY! Did what we did and go here immediately, if not sooner! And afterwards you must visit The Beehive, a very fabulous bar across the street. The atmosphere and the drink called the \\"Queen Bee\\" just can't be missed."},{"name":"Uwajimaya","address":"10500 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I have been going to this market since I was a little kid.

Obviously, they have a great selection of beer, but I was impressed with their selection of wine.

We then proceeded to split the bolognese, which was clearly homemade and on par with incredible bolognese we'd had at another restaurant in the area. And this is where I take one star away. The waiter must've assumed we were done eating and we had to flag him down to order our steaks and a second glass of wine. Maybe we didn't look like the type of people who could down four courses or maybe he though we were cheap, but at least humor us and ask if we're all set.

I'll start with the suck and move onto the blow.\\n\\n*The Suck*\\n\\nThe food was terrible. The chicken biscuit I had ranks slightly below McDonalds but slightly above a gas station chicken biscuit that had been sitting out a little too long. The chicken was seriously dry, and lacking in any notable fried chicken flavor. I don't know what seasoning they use on the chicken, and I don't think they do either. The biscuit was somehow both dry and too doughy--it tasted sort of like flour that had been mooshed into a biscuit shape. Needless to say, it was severely lacking in butteriness and flavoriness.\\n\\nLuckily, it came with some gravy \\"sauce\\" to provide much needed moisture and flavor to this bland desert of a biscuit. It is important to note, however, that this is not gravy, but gravy \\"sauce.\\" While gravy is thick and fatty and \\"mmmmm,\\" this is thin and runny and \\"huh?\\". Proper gravy can practically be eaten with a fork; this can practically be eaten if you don't think of it as gravy. Even still, I slathered as much of it as I could onto every surface just so the chicken didn't suck all the moisture out of my body. So yeah, it sucks.\\n\\n*The Blow*\\n\\nHoly crap this is the smallest chicken biscuit I've ever seen and it cost $4. Seriously, the biscuit is a half thumb in diameter. I think Chick-fil-a sells something similar called a \\"chicken mini.\\" Here, you get one chicken mini for $4.

Went down to Pandora, World of Avatar to check on the Satu'li Canteen.  Menu is essentially only a build-a-bowl, but it's surprisingly a really good bowl.  This is probably one of the healthiest, freshest, and tastiest places to eat in the theme parks.  There was ample seating in the dining room, lots of nooks so you didn't feel like you were eating in a cafeteria hall, and they had real metal silverware.  It was pretty civilized in the middle of the tourist frenzy that is lunchtime.  Luckily a \\"bowl\\" does not seem to appeal to most kids, like a basket of chicken fingers and fries, so mostly adults it seemed in this place.  \\n\\nGot the Combination Beef and Chicken Bowl.  The beef was slow-roasted and a beautiful, rosy medium-rare, and well-seasoned.  The wood-grilled chicken had great smokiness.  In fact, you can see and smell the wood smoke from across Pandora when you walk through.  I had the potato hash base, which is a dice of red-skinned and sweet potatoes.  The potatoes were soft and tender, not crispy, if you're expecting a browned hash, but still tasty.  The raw broccoli slaw made it feel like I had a little vegetable.  The healthier option is the \\"hearty salad\\" base, but the hash was certainly filling.  The passionfruit boba were a little flavor surprise.  The green onion vinaigrette added a nice pungent accent to the rich meats and starchy hash.

The restaurant is located in a converted house so it isn't large but nicely decorated and felt cozy. The food was great! We started with the calamari that was light, you need the sauce that comes with it. The sauce with it was tomato based, fresh ingredients and very flavorful. They had a \\"specials\\" menu and I overheard the waitress tell another table that it changes every few weeks.  The bread was good but not warm. I got a ricotta gnocchi with chicken and an arugula pesto. Lots of sauce which I was glad to have the bread to use for it. Sauce was very tasty but it was the overriding flavor. Others at the table got the chicken cannelloni, the mushroom risotto and tortellini. Everyone enjoyed their entree. We skipped dessert but the options looked good: tiramisu, cheesecake, gelato, crepe br√ªl√©e. The service wasn't great. The waitress didn't check on us really and it took a while to get waters.

Taste is a very open and bright restaurant located right off of Cesar Chavez.  They have some outdoor seating but it is right off of Cesar Chavez and can get loud from the cars whizzing by.   Taste was the one establishment that did not have any specials for Sunday.  This was a bummer because the other 3 wine bars had specials on Sunday.  Taste was unique because they have an area where you can pay to tastes various wines.  I believe that a customer can give the waiter/waitress a credit card, and then they are given a card that they can use to taste the wines (You slide it in the machine that gives you the wine pour).  Wine tastings ranged from $2 up to around $8 (I didn't look at all of the prices, so there could have been more and less expensive tastings).    We ordered our glasses of wine and enjoyed our time with each other while at Taste.\\n\\nWe all had one complaint about Taste, and it was our waiter.  He did a good job of recommending wines based on what we liked, but he had a bit of an attitude.  When he found out that our next stop was House Wine he made a comment that we all thought was slightly inappropriate.  He said that \\"why go to House Wine? They aren't a true wine bar; they get their wine from HEB\\".    Most of us have worked in a retail environment and we know it is unprofessional to talk bad about your competition.  Excuse the pun, but it left a bad taste in our mouth.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a wine connoisseur but I do buy some of my wine from HEB and I don't think that makes me any less a \\"true wine\\" fan.\\n\\nAs we were paying our bill another waiter came up and asked what we were up to and chatted with us.

We ended up just trying their chicken - chicken thigh 1 piece and chicken tenders (3). We got the frim fram and honey mustard sauces. While the line isn't terribly long, it can be slow going for sure. \\n\\nHaving tried their chicken, I think it's a bit on the average side than anything. I don't see the allure of the chicken from here and we were kind of glad we didn't get a full meal from here. The chicken thigh was succulent on the inside and tasted like fresh chicken being fried, which is a plus. You can definitely taste the seasoning on the outside because it was too salty, but the inside lacked the seasoning itself. To which, I think the chicken wasn't seasoned enough and the flour was overly seasoned. Not overly positive if it's a southern batter - buttermilk - but the outside wasn't as crispy as we thought it would have been. It had a slight crispy, but otherwise it was a bit soggy. Either from the chicken's juices seeping out or from having sat for a while. When ordering, you can see which chicken pieces are running out and which pieces were freshly refilled. I should have opted for a chicken breast part, but since we didn't want too much, we opted for a thigh instead - regrets. \\n\\nThe chicken tenders were not as great, because they were fried for too long and were dried on the inside. The honey mustard saves it, but the tender itself are not worth trying in my opinion. The frim fram sauce reminded me of a fail attempt at making thousand island. It's made with tomato, mayonnaise, garlic aioli, and one herb I believe. It was appetizing, but not well suited for trying with friend chicken. Perhaps on a biscuit or starch item, it would be nice. \\n\\nOverall, it was worth a try, but I would suggest trying something else in the area instead."},{"name":"Bamboo Garden","address":"2430 US Hwy 27, Ste 340","city":"Clermont","stars":"4.5","text":"Bamboo Garden is the best Chinese food in the area!

We did not want to make a scene so we didn't say anything.\\n\\nLastly, we wanted our bills to be separated since none of us were couples and since he brought the bill over that was billed together, I asked him nicely to separate our bills and he says \\"you should have told me that before.\\" I said \\"you didn't ask us\\" and he said \\"Oh.

The chicken was still just okay... the first time we ate there, our chicken came out undercook and bloody. This time it is crispier but still.... nothing to write home about. The roti is not as flaky and not enough layers as it should for it to be Melayu style. Malaysian roti canai has many layers and this is just plane flat roti that is slightly on the dry side. The curry is a bit on the sweet side. We enjoyed the Dtom which is a modified Tom yum soup but overpriced. The ceviche had way too much salt and it took a lot of rice for us to finish that. $12 ceviche... better not waste it when it is just a mini plate!\\nLastly,  service is just plain rushed and full of sassy attitude that's totally unnecessary for it to be an eating joint. Waitress shooed us to the back by the washrooms to wait while the front order taker tapped her pen loudly and impatiently while our friend tried to decide what to order.  No one behind us, why the show of impatience? This is no Thai hospitality. Your fried chicken may be famous but honestly,  overrated.

Remember those inexplicable burrito cravings every time of day?  Well Pig Floyd's gives me flashbacks...  Major cravings.  In fact, you can't stop thinking about Pig Floyd's until you finally get Pig Floyd's.  It's that bad, you guys.\\n\\nSo my first visit here was a little annoying because of the wait.  They were out of my first choice and  I forgot which sandwich I ended up ordering but it was yummy.  I thought the plantains were under-ripe but ate then anyway (of course).\\n\\nThe second time I visited in the middle of a Tuesday night rainstorm.  The parking lot was empty and there was no line. Practically no wait.  The clerk was friendly and even wanted to chit chat.  I ordered the banh mi sandwich and fell in love.  The textures, you guys. The textures.. Again I have the side of plantains and this time they are out of this world.  I wake up the next morning craving more for breakfast.\\n\\nMy third visit, however, nearly crushed my crush.  It took 25 minutes from when I initially stood in line until we were able to finish our order.  In those 25 minutes I drew up an entire narrative for the man and woman ahead of me.  They were flirting and asking about where the other is from.  I go \\"oh sweet a first date\\".  The woman was a little on the heavy side and the man was quite short.  Odd pair but  good for them!  Exchanging stories about grandfathers. How sweet!  The man handed me a menu to look at as soon as we got in line.  Such a gentlemen!  Not necessary because my partner and I decided what we wanted three hours ago.  We even took into consideration the crowds, and decided to wait until 9pm to drive over, not normal dining hours.  We can avoid the wait - I thought.  So the woman changes her purse to her other shoulder.  Oh, boy. We have been here a while.  I look up and see I swear the same three chaps still negotiating their order.  What the hell?  The couple's conversations slowly draw to a close.  I feel sad for them.  I turn to my companion and he is knee deep in researching man-buns, which he just realized is a thing.  He was about to articulate his innermost thoughts on the subject and how it relates to Jared Leto when I give him a elbow nod.  The young man behind him is sporting a man-bun.  I notice the line has not moved and a few people have entered, note the line, and turn back around to leave.  I turn back around and see a (new?) group of chaps still having issues ordering and paying.. Did I just see a double man bun? Does that count?  Keep in mind I'm still craving Pig Floyd's like a fiend the entire time. I was starving.  Finally our couple stands up to order.  I find it odd they pay separately.  I feel like the date went from promising at the beginning to a general knowledge that there is no future here so we pay separately.  I feel sad for them.  By now my partner has researched the origins of the name of the beer he plans on ordering.  Why do so many north-eastern towns have Native American names?  Is that all that remains of Native American culture?  Is this the outcome they deserve?  Do children growing up the the Western states grow tired of learning about the original 13 colonies of the United States? It is 9:23 and only then notice we need to multiply our pre-planned order by two.  A quick mental shuffle and we get it down pat. Sauces and everything.\\n\\nThen we sit down and *wait* for our food.  I can feel my stomach eating itself.  The line is out the door.  My couple have literally broken up.  They went in different directions.  My world has crumbled.  What is the problem with this line?  \\n\\nSo we sit down and my compatriot goes \\"Man-buns are dumb and ugly.  Native American names for beers and towns sound ridiculous and what the hell are you talking about that man in front of us was gay.  Those two were not on a date.\\"\\n\\nMy food was delicious.  The brisket is perfection.  Yuca and the lucky dragon sauce go wonderfully together.  Corn on the cob had me in tears and for the sake of GOD please get that line under control because I cannot be alone with my thoughts for 25 minutes while hungry.  My hope is with time customers will figure out the menu so they don't have to ask the clerk 70 questions before placing an order.

I asked the waitress, who was super nice, to fix this and she did. When I got the plate back, it was a complete disaster. The brisket was not served in slices and there burnt ends were not real burnt ends (moist and tender pieces of the point on he brisket), it was the actual burnt pieces of the brisket which should have been thrown away. It was comparable to eating a bite of charcoal. \\n\\nThe brisket was dry, chewy, flavorless, and completely inedible.

Mind you, it was around 8:00 and the Lindbergh City Center station still didn't have that many shops around, so there is not much in a way of activity to begin with. Still, with the type of reputation that they apparently have, you would think they would have lot of more people in there.

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the fries, which came out in the bag (why a bag if I am eating in?). Eating them up, I can definitely say that meat quality matches that of In'N'Out, although I can't really say the same about the toppings. As for the fries, they are better than average; it helps that they have malt vinegar, which goes really well sprinkled on the fries and dipped in ketchup (which, ironically enough, really just thick and read vinegar).\\n\\nOverall, I would rate it this a good burger joint, but to parapharse a certain senator:\\n\\nI lived near In'N'Out.

Today was the day, and I am all in all a fan.\\n\\nIf you are not a fan of the pick-and-choose, sample-y style menu, you could be a little confuddled by the layout of the menu, and the portions are mostly not what you would consider entree-sized.  My man-friend and I like to eat snack-style, so it's perfect for us. \\n\\nWe started with skewers - baby octopus (yum! and spicy!) and chicken hearts (double yum! whoever dissed them below obviously didn't try them!) along with an order of the short ribs (savory flavor explosion of fatty-good meat!), followed by miang kham, a kind of roll-your-own taste treat, usually served with lettuce leaves or spinach, but served in betel leaves at Ping.  The betel leaves are a change from what I'm used to, but delicious nontheless.  We wrapped up the savory portion with the Spicy Mama Ramen, which is a gussied-up take on instant ramen - I was magically transported back to college for a moment.

Really, you won't care what the ice cream is made of, because this is one of the best desserts I've had in a long long time!  The silky ice cream over the not-too-sweet sticky rice topped with peanuts, toasted coconut and an ever-so-delicate drizzle of chocolate sauce hit all my spots. \\n\\nDrinks were good, especially the drinking vinegar, and when I asked nicely, they made me a non-alcoholic salty lime Collins - I can't wait to have the real alcohol kind! - and the Asian beer selection looks fantastic.  Our waiter was a fount of knowledge and gave great advice on drink selections.  \\n\\nNow for the bad news:  it IS a little on the pricey side.  I enjoyed our dinner, and I will be back, but we spent over $60 on about 6 oz. of meat, some betel leaves and chopped veggies and ramen.  Our drinks and dessert accounted for about $25 of the total, and we left satisfied, but there was a smidge of sticker shock at the end of the meal.

The TWIST to all of this is that all of the ingredients to the Old fashioned are frozen into a ball - which is then dropped into the bourbon of choice so - as the ice ball melts the flavor slowly infuses into the bourbon. So as it chills, it's flavor profile rises and there is no watering down from ordinary ice cubes. Brilliant! \\n\\nMy first course was the \\"Sweet Pot\\" - a mixture of sweet potato (of course) tomato curry, coconut curry, Brussels Sprouts Leaves, spicy peanut, fried  onion, and other magic.

I do wish that the ribs had been butchered into smaller pieces for easier eating and that the noodles were less clumped, but that did not stop me from throughly enjoying the meal. I also had a taste of my colleague's Kuaytiaw Pet Pha Lo, which was amazing with that yellow chili dipping sauce. I also tasted my other colleague's Kuaytiaw Khua Kai, which had this wonderful seasoning over the noodles. \\n\\nI know other Yelpers have not had the best of experiences here, but I really enjoyed my food (and the little bits of others' dishes). I felt that it was very clean and that the flavors all worked well together, especially the harmony between the meats and the dipping sauces.

I came for dinner and the Sound+Vision event with Big Freedia, so the market seemed to be pretty packed for a weeknight.\\n\\nI decided on a thigh and a wing with macaroni and cheese and rolls. The line was moving pretty quickly, which was a plus compared to other places. I think if I want to try the rolls, I may have to get there earlier, because they ran out. So, I got the chicken, the side, and frimfram sauce.\\n\\nThe chicken was FRESH! It was moist, but still crispy, and the seasoning was tasty. It was a little bit on the salty side, but my tastebuds could be different because I try not to eat a lot of salt. I asked a friend that is also particular about chicken to try it; we both loved it. The frimfram sauce was interesting; it has a slight kick, but it's also creamy. The macaroni was a combination of creamy and cheesy. I typically dont like creamy mac and cheese, but it was everything.\\n\\nI will definitely be trying Hops again, possibly with more sauces.

Maybe something sweet like cranberry on it would have earned it some higher marks. \\n\\nIn addition, the tuna wrap was even more bland than the lecce--I asked for pickles on it, and that was the main flavor of the sandwich. They would have been served well to put some sort of spicy mayo on it or something just to kick the flavor up a notch.\\n\\nWe also shared a bag of BBQ potato chips and a cheesecake brownie. The potato chips were just a store bought bag, but the cheesecake brownie was a great finish to the meal. It was definitely our favorite food of the afternoon as it was so moist and flavorful and had a great texture to it as well.\\n\\nOverall, though the sandwiches here were a bit lackluster, with just an addition of a sauce, they could probably be very good.

Yes, I realize it is the North End of Boston and real estate comes at a premium; however, while dining, you should still be afforded enough space to comfortably sit without having your waiter's ass (literally) in your face while talking to the diners seated next to you. If nothing less, the waiter should be familiar with the working environment enough to be able to work around it. Out of the five dishes we ate, the scallops were triumphant. Everything else scored a \\"C\\" in my book. Of course being in the north end of Boston, I anxiously anticipated the dessert that was soon to come. Unfortunately, at 9:30, while still considering another course, we were told that the kitchen would be closing and we had to put in our final order. Clearly, our waiter had plans that night. Soured by the news that we were being pushed out the door at 9:30 on a Saturday evening, knowing that the restaurant had not stopped seating, put an end to my appetite.

For instance, they will charge extra for every item placed into the pho.\\n\\nThe service was only ok. The young new waitress was fine and helpful.

It was okay.\\n\\nWe got the Honey Lavender and Almond Brittle with salted ganache.\\n\\nI HATED the honey lavender. Turns out I love the smell of lavender and hate tasting it. Something about eating lavender ruined my experience. I will say, it tastes just how lavender smells. Two of my children loved it. I couldn't eat more than a spoonful and would have thrown it away. All this to say that if you love the taste of lavender, you'll probably love this ice cream. Aside from the taste, it was creamy and the texture was great. Much better than commercially produced, store bought ice cream.\\n\\nThe Almond Brittle salted ganache was my favorite of the two. It was creamy and provided a wide array and depth of flavors. It's has a strong salt taste in some bites, a sting dark chocolate taste in some bites, and they are both contrasted with the sweet creamy taste of the vanilla ice cream surrounding those bits. I've never tasted anything like it.\\n\\nI'm not an ice cream connoisseur and I have to be in the mood for ice cream, so take my review as lightly as you wish.  I love the handmade ice cream and the care they took preparing it. In consideration of the price, be careful sampling things you may not like. Know your limits and all will be okay.

Brussel sprouts & broccoli were great. The burger was fine - wasn't completely blown away but maybe it was just a weaker entree vs. the other stuff.

They refer to a buffet. There is no buffet other than some appetizer salads (seaweed) and fruits.  The restaurant has a regular menu or an All You Can Eat option. Seems to me the only reason to go here is the AYCE option. There are better straight up sushi places.  There are few AYCE sushi places in the Boston area.  This one is a great option for that.    I dislike Minado in Framingham which is a buffett. Its a mad free for all where you always feel rushed, you have to run up when they put out the premium stuff or someone else will grab all of it at times.  Maki Maki is not like that.  You order from an AYCE menu that has cooked food (tempura's, varied appetizers, etc, and sushi & sashimi with a broad selection of specialty rolls plus the normal ones). Its not that common for an AYCE place to offer sashimi - most want you to fill up on the rice.  If you order mostly big rolls with lots of rice - thats your own fault.  you can also order oysters for an additional $0.50 per oyster The sushi & sashimi pieces are smaller than you get in most japanese restaurants. It threw us for a loop the first time, but once you know, you just know to order more.  We usually order appetizers (gyoza or shumei, or tuna tartar, steak tataki, etc) while we figure out what sushi we want.  Order the sushi as soon as you can and it comes sometime after you finished the apps.  It does take a little while but this is par for the course at any busy sushi place let alone an AYCE place.  At this point we know what we can eat and order almost all we want in the first pass, then add a few salmon/eel or something to top off while we ponder dessert.  The tempura oreo's are amazing - though obviously not authentic japanese.  also choice of ice cream like green tea, ginger, and the standards van/choc.  \\nThe place is a deal at $26 on the weekends and less during the week.   If you are looking for high end or finessed sushi - this is not the place.  But the sushi is pretty good , with many options and certainly alot, and with variation of cooked food too, for a great price. But its not just volume, the sushi is pretty good and the cooked food is tasty.  It all satisfies and If you leave hungry - its your own fault.\\nWe have been several times and will go back."},{"name":"Doc's Motorworks 38th","address":"1106 W 38th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I hadn't been to one of these in years, and unfortunately, not much has changed.\\n\\nThe beer tasted like water.

This place has always been 5 stars to me but definitely not so much anymore. A couple months back, I noticed the delicious cupcakes they have had gotten smaller, a lot smaller, but of course the price didn't. The girl I had spoken to said they were trying to make the cupcakes more profitable and desirable. I guess they were too big and people weren't ordering them. Making them smaller and keeping the price the same isn't quite the way to go. \\nFast forward to yesterday when my dad and I went here before taking the kids to the parks. We each got the pulled pork sandwich. My dad was watching them make his sandwich and when the sandwich maker was done, he slid the tray to the girl doing the sides. My dad had to ask if that was all the meat he was getting. The gentleman apologized and put more pulled pork on. I had no idea this had happened because I was up ahead of him and sidetracked by the kids. We sat down and when I took the bun off my sandwich to add some of their awesome sauce, I was astounded by how little meat was on my sandwich. This was twice now because on my last visit my sandwich was ridiculously small. My dad told me he had to say something and got more meat. In all fairness, he did make me a new sandwich but the quality of the pork was not what it used to be.

I was looking for a Fluoride-Free Sensitive toothpaste. You'd be surprised how hard that is to find. Amazon failed me.\\n\\nHow did I find out about Hoover's Market? I googled Vitamin Shoppe as a starting point. Hoover's Market showed up on the map. The store is close to me so I figured I'd give it a try.\\n\\nDid I find my toothpaste? Yes. There are so many toothpaste choices. There are a few fluoride-free options, but only one that was both fluoride-free and for sensitive teeth - Tom's of Maine. I'll take it.\\n\\nDid I like the store? Yes I did. Why? Because it has most of the organic/real natural stuff I go to Amazon to buy. Whole Foods isn't convenient to my house. In fact, I like Hoover's because it's small and, funny enough, I don't feel overwhelmed by choices like I do at Whole Foods.\\n\\nI figured Hoover's Market was a chain.

No biggie. \\n\\nThe place itself is a small restaurant with a definite hipster vibe, nestled in a cute little neighborhood with street parking. To start our Portland adventures, we were seated at the counter that overlooked the open kitchen. I ordered a Bloody Mary after seen so many being made, I figured they must be good here. Boy, was I wrong! I pretty much got tomato juice and a splash of vodka. At least the presentation of it was nice lol. \\n\\nFor our food, I ordered the Go Home Thomas which was to consist of scrambled eggs, white cheddar (mine was missing :-( sadly), house ground sausage (burnt) with braised greens on a House English muffin served with breakfast potatoes. I'm sad to say, this was very underwhelming in flavor and overly priced. The hubs was the smarter one and ordered the daily special of fried eggs with house made biscuits and gravy. He enjoyed his dish very much! \\n\\nAfter we were done and ready to check out, they give you a free bite sized bread pudding dessert which was delicious! I should have just ordered that instead of my breakfast option.

One of the cast members also recommended the black bean Vinaigrette but I also wanted to try the chargrilled onion Vinaigrette so I got both on the side. After trying both, my favorite was the black bean Vinaigrette. It has a great tanginess and just a little bit of heat which really complimented the hash and steak. However, I really liked the chicken with the onion Vinaigrette so I ended up dipping the pieces of chicken in it as I ate.  \\n\\nThe day I was there, it was right around 12:40pm.

Based on the reviews, I thought Dos Madres would be decent, but it was anything but! It started off ok with a nice smokey tomato based salsa and decent guacamole, but maybe I should have been tipped off about how the rest of the meal would be by the greasiness of the chips. They were glistening! Anyway, having not eaten since breakfast we polished off the chips. I got the Baja fish tacos and my husband got the carne asada tacos. My tacos were in a word - unacceptable! I should have returned them. First, I ordered corn tortillas which were so saturated with oil that they were crumbling. The fish was breaded (as baja style always is) but it didn't seem like they made any attempt to drain the excess oil off after they took it out of the fryer. I honestly don't even recall if the slaw and creamy sauce was tasty because the oil overwhelmed the whole thing. \\n\\nMy husband offered to swap me one of his carne asada tacos. He had the same reaction to the fish taco. The carne asada was not good, flavorless and even though it  was grilled it managed to taste oily too. I couldn't even eat it. They also used large flour tortillas so the poor carne asada and oily onions were very lonely in that gigantic tortilla. Not cute! Now for the rice and beans - which it is usually hard to screw up, but Dos Madres managed to. The beans were flavorless black beans and the rice, again, was glistening with oil. The cooks must have a very heavy hand with the oil they use, bc every last thing was soaked. Yuck! My stomach was feeling a little sick after I ate the taco so that was really all I actually ate. \\n\\nThe service was average (at best.) We could have used some more chips for our guacamole, but the server didn't even offer. We didn't ask for more bc they were so soaked in oil, but still, its a common courtesy to offer. My water was also not refilled. Being pregnant, I didn't get a margarita. I would hope they could at least do that right?!  What I've noticed about Atlanta is that you either get a poor imitation of authentic Mexican or tex-mex and honestly, I'd just rather have tex-mex done well than authentic done half-assed. \\n\\nLooks like the search for a decent Mexican place continues.

Satu'li is the best way to satisfy hunger (after 1.5+ hour ride line waits).\\n\\nThe cheeseburger steamed pods are delicious. Having eaten many buns/baos in my life...I can say that this one is not to be missed (if you love cheeseburger- for me, cheeseburgers should be a food group). Served with root vegetable chips and crunchy slaw..it's a perfect meal option or in our case, a shared appetizer for the table.\\n\\nThe flavor profiles of the satu'li bowl with harvest salad base are unmatched by anything else you can buy at the Disney theme parks. Park food is notoriously unhealthy, but with this bowl...you're able to feel satisfied & not guilty (until you walk out and buy a churro or an ice cream for dessert). Grilled beef is also offered at medium temp, which is a nice break from the overcooked meats that are often found at quick serve restaurants. Food quality is also impeccable & makes me wonder why all theme park food isn't. \\n\\n**Pro tip: create your mobile order through the app & there's virtually no wait for your food (gave us something to do/think about as we waited in line for Flight of Passage)."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow this place was SUPER.

There was one food ordering place for pizza, which was totally overwhelmed, as well as several bars you could order at. No outside food or drink was allowed in, (although, we saw people bring in things like cupcakes etc.) but the waits for both the lines to order  food as well as the wait for food itself was ridiculous. 50 minutes for a pizza! If you ordered a salad or garlic knots though, those were ready right away. This really needs work. Additionally, the drink lines were quite long as well.. I think I stood in line for over 10 minutes just to get a glass of wine. \\n\\nAnyways, I really loved that they had the big barn with plenty of huge benches, as well as fans all over the ceilings for hot days. They also had picnic tables up under some live oaks which looked so picturesque and lovely. The whole place seems to be kept up really well. I'd come back here, to experience more things like the brewery tour as well as venture further into the grounds.

Nothing was great, the oysters tasted bad and other dishes were over salted.  Service was terrible.  They brought us a dish that another table ordered.  We tried to explain to the gentlemen we didn't order the empanadas before he even placed it down, but was clearly bothered by being there and wouldn't listen.  When our original server was leaving for the night, she introduced another that would be taking care of us.  The introduction was pointless seeing as how the server that took over never came back to check on us.  We had to flag her down to get our check and which time she stated she wasn't sure if we got the one item we ordered from her.  We did, but it  sucked.

It's got an amazing variety of dishes, ranging from Canto-dishes to even Szechuan ones. The menu itself was already a plus to me! \\n\\nAs for the dishes, one dish that really impressed me were the spring rolls. I usually don't go for those because I get so disappointed when I see them all flat and small with bad sauce slathered across. Here however, the Spring Rolls were huge, round, and crispy. The dip was great! I think it's definitely my go-to place for spring rolls now!!\\n\\nI also liked the lobster dish. I recommend you eat it with a big group because there's quite a lot of lobster! (2 lobsters in our dish actually) and the meat was great. It was tender, juicy, and very flavourful. Although I don't usually eat lobster outside all that much, this one caught my taste bud's interests right away! Be careful though, make sure you use the miniature trident thingy to skewer the meat and pull the rest out of the shell first. If you just eat the it without removing the shell, the rest of the meat will be lost in that unreachable void forever. Trust me, I've tried pulling it out and making a fool out of myself for 10 minutes. No good :(\\n\\nAnother dish I enjoyed is my ultimate bias: Honey garlic boneless pork. I eat it at EVERY Canto-based Chinese restaurant EVER. It's just SO GOOD--but the degree of deliciousness really depends on the cook. For some, the meat is not crispy enough and that itself can REALLY ruin the dish for me. This restaurant however, does not disappoint. It came out a perfect balance of honey on crispy, deep fried pork. Although we were out in a group, I can pretty much vouch that I ate half of the dish myself.\\n\\nIt's a great place to go to with a group, and its friendly atmosphere is perfect for eating out with friends and family!! \\n\\nFinally, the food was quick and our server was also very nice!

The waitstaff looked at us like we were criminals or something, chasing this other couple away from their table.\\n\\nThe waitress approached the couple and I couldn't hear what she asked them, but the woman said, \\"She told us that their names were on a list.\\" The owner (manager?) came over to them and apologized for the confusion. But no one apologized to us.\\n\\n2. The waitress came over to us and asked us for our order. We ordered two menus. Then the waitress went and spoke with the displaced couple again, then gathered orders or dishes from every other table in the restaurant, then brought them to the kitchen, then made another round of all the other tables, then brought us our menus.\\n\\n3. I don't know how long we waited to put in our order. We got our water glasses refilled twice each, and were brought a second bowl of bread. Though the busgirl had remembered we were there, the waitress obviously hadn't. I lost count of how many times my friend and I tried to make eye contact with her. When she approached the table next to ours for the third time since we'd been given our menus, the woman at that table said, \\"We're all set, but I think they'd like to order.\\"\\n\\n4. We ordered several things and then began the long wait for our food. The egregiousness of it wouldn't have bothered me so much if the food had been good, but the green beans in the Taze Fasulye had come from a can, the lettuce that all our food was served on was old and drying out, the tomatoes that came with everything were flavorless and practically colorless, and the beans in the Piyaz Salat were obviously straight from a can as well.\\n\\n5. The waitress, recognizing that we'd had a less than stellar experience, offered us free coffee or dessert, but we were both pretty fed up with both the meal and the service and opted out. From arrival to departure, we'd been there a hair over 2 hours for 5 plates of old, canned food.\\n\\nIncidentally: when we first sat down, there was a segment on mummies showing on the large TV, and \\"Walk like an Egyptian\\" was playing on the radio.

We opted for the Sweet Hereafter and were very pleased with our decision. Located in the Buckman district of Portland, parking is a bit of a chore. However, we found street parking 4-5 blocks away, so it wasn't that big a deal. The place itself is nice and dark like a bar should be and definitely has a neighborhood vibe. We tried the Eastern Bowl, Bahn Mi, and Buffalo sandwich, all of which were vegan and all delicious.

The educated guess paid off and I had some of the most delicious tacos ever.\\n\\nI had two $2 tacos. One al pastor and the other a carnita taco. Wow, they were good. The meat was well-seasoned, the tortillas were fresh and double-wrapped which prevented the tacos from falling apart after each bite.\\n\\nThe bountiful cilantro and onion toppings also added much flavor. The tacos were served with limes and a side of vinegared cucumbers which was a nice touch. They also had a homemade guacamole sauce which was delicious and a spicy pepper and onion condiment that gave it a nice kick. \\n\\nFinally, the customer service and friendliness of the staff at EL Tuzo Taco are amazing. They are seemingly a family-run business, with the children and adults working together to make it all work. One of the owners (I think) came out to greet us and made sure we enjoyed the food.

Then all of a sudden a server came by and said you cannot sit here it's for couples only, and asked me to move to a seat at an already cramped table. I protested, but the server not only did not listen to my concern (I think he could not understand me or did not bother to listen at all), but basically became more and more aggressive asking me to move. I was horrified by the experience. No matter how good the food is, I wish they had been more thoughtful or diplomatic about it.

One being the corn. While I do love me some corn on the cob the cheese and cilantro sauce was a tad bit overwhelming for me. I did notice brown sugar on the fried plantains that really compliments the sweetness of the classic side dish. The rice and beans were also very good. As a half Cuban, I feel as though I can somewhat accurately vouch for the quality of some black beans. These were good! Definitely a viable side option here. The brisket was fatty and delicious.

It's nice when a restaurant is as exciting as it was when you were reading and drooling over the menu online. Two friends and I came on a Thursday morning, were seated almost immediately, and proceeded to order what felt like half the menu because too many things sounded good:\\n\\n-Potatoes bravas over eggs: I've had the potatoes bravas at their sister restaurant, Toro Bravo. The ones here are delicious too...lovely chunks of roasted (fried??) potato bathed in a paprika-y garlic-y sauce. I might have liked the potatoes to be a little crispier. \\n\\n-Biscuit with marionberry jam & butter: What a biscuit. You can't break off a piece without noticing the dozens of flaky layers. The marionberry jam is perfect on it. \\n\\n-French toast with mixed-berry maple & whipped cream: I don't typically order French toast because I've usually had enough after half a slice. We decided to share a half order, though somehow, a full order managed to make it to our table. I loved that the toast was sliced relatively thinly, so the middle wasn't super wet and soggy. The berry maple was thickly lathered on and had the right amount of sweetness.  \\n\\n-Polenta and sausage ragu with mozzarella and fried egg: This wasn't quite what I expected. It was a lot more orange (maybe colored by the sausage fat?) and less soft. Once I moved on from my expectations, I found the dish hearty and delicious. I didn't think the mozzarella, which was in a slice that quickly congealed over the polenta, added too much. \\n\\nDespite eggs being ubiquitous on the menu, I wouldn't necessarily say they did an exceptional job of cooking them. In both the potatoes bravas and the polenta, the yolks were half to mostly cooked through, depriving me of the glorious runniness. \\n\\nWhen we got the bill for our enormous brunch, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it came out to be about $13/person after tip.

This is a weekend-only soup. No they do not sell it any other day but Saturday and Sunday. Why? Because it's hangover food and it goes fast, so if you want it, you better call and keep calling to reserve your soup cause every Latino waking up \\"crudo\\" will be there with bells on.\\n\\nThe tortillas, while they aren't the most legitimate, lard-filled, handmade tortillas I have had...they're still pretty good. A 3.5 out of 5 in my book. The tacos de lengua (that's cow tongue, folks) are so life changing. Try it, then judge it. Of course you have the usual suspects, carne asada, chicken, al pastor...all are good and come with your assumed authentic toppings of onion, cilantro, add a good squirt of lime and dash of salt. The salsas there are made in house and stored in ketchup bottle, diner containers...If you can't take heat then pass on these.\\n\\nTortas, tortas, tortas. \\nThese are deliciously large ways of saying sandwiches in Spanish. It's a very specific square type of bread, a lot of mayo (because Mexicans might as well have thought Jesus converted water into Mayo, it's a big staple in our lives) and your choice of chicken or carne asada. The torta is then filled with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, sliced avocado, roasted pickled jalape√±os and ....love. \\nDespite their size, be prepared to want another torta because after it is gone from its warm foil wrapper you will want to cry. These are a football game day favorite in my house. I order like 6 for 2 people (don't judge me I'm not fat, I just eat a lot) and enjoy them with beer.

He tried to convince us to get the whole bottle, since that's only 4 full glasses, but we opted to spend those calories on dessert instead.\\n\\nI had the arugula salad - delicious and rustic, with untrimmed greens, pine nuts, cheese, lemon juice, and olive oil.  Just what you'd expect from a simple Italian salad.  Jimmy had the Caesar and ate every bite, so it must have been good.\\n\\nFor the main, I had the eggplant and bell pepper ravioli with tomato basil sauce, and Jimmy had the angel hair with seafood.  The bell pepper in the ravioli definitely overwhelmed the eggplant.  The sauce was not too sweet, and greatly improved by the mountain of cheese on top.  The seafood in Jimmy's angel hair was well-cooked, not chewy as often happens when sauteed with pasta, but the sauce on the noodles was a little too thick - it distracted from the texture of the noodles themselves.\\n\\nDessert was a treat - coffee gelato and tiramisu.  The gelato sadly was American - not the smooth creaminess that I remember from Italy, but still had delicious flavor and a generous portion.  The tiramisu was a light and flavorful treat - the perfect ending to clean the garlic taste from your mouth.\\n\\nI will go back for the atmosphere and try something else on the menu."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So glad Jan H.  will never be back!

A friend made a recommendation to see Jester, and while there are alot of breweries spread throughout Austin, consider this as one of fhe essential breweries, a must visit. Any beer advocate needs to check this. It's worth the drive out, about 40 minutes outside of downtown Austin. The place is perfect for a nice, warm day with plenty of picnic table like seating throughout the outdoor properties. They have an outdoor post and indoor for ordering beers. A gift shop also provides cool souvenirs to bring back home.\\n\\nWe had flights of beers, mostly included the barnyard funk or sour beer variety. I had namely specials on the menu, the Spon 1 and 2 (3 Year Blend), Fƒìn T√°o, and Vague Recollection. These consist mostly of sours with slight funk. All were amazing, but I was particularly loving Spons 1 and 2. They had a sour base but unexpected flavors pulling through each sip. We ended up buying Spon 1 and 2 and bringing them back home to age for a bit. The quality of their beers is evident from the very start, and their staff is very knowledgeable of the Jester beers. It's unbelieveable I haven't encountered a Jester King brew before, but I will be on the lookout from now on.\\n\\nA wonderful time at Jester King, and I would strongly recommend a trip for beer lovers or anyone out there. My friend who is not into beers at all has now became a fan of it after our trip to Jester. For non beer fans, Jester beers will make you believe tasty beer does exist. The brewery is massive compared to some breweries I've passed along the way. I would say it's maybe a bit smaller compared to say Ommegang, but the outdoor seating is definitely a prominent part of the space. There are also some food stations adjacent to the brewery that take up a large part, including a pizza station open till fairly late.

Check the other recent reviews - most of the 5-star reviews are most likely fake and the others, since the restaurant was redone a few weeks ago, are bad. \\n\\nHere's our particular experience: \\n\\nWe have been coming to this Chevy's location for years, but on our most recent trip, after the restaurant was \\"redone,\\" we had a horrible experience. I don't know that I've ever received worse service.\\n\\nFirst, we tried calling to see if they could put our name on the list before we got there, but the phone rang endlessly. Then, when we arrived, the three hostesses assured us the wait was 25 to 30 minutes in a confident manner. After waiting 20 minutes, I asked how much longer and was told 20 more minutes. When I said that that was longer than the stated waiting time, a hostess just said, \\"I know.\\" No \\"I'm sorry\\" or explanation -- something other than, \\"I know\\" would have been much appreciated. \\n\\nAfter 50 minutes, after everyone else who had been waiting outside with us had been seated, we went inside to wait, and saw that there were 8 tables open. When we questioned this, the hostesses told us that they were \\"giving the kitchen a break.\\" When we pointed out that our wait was only supposed to be 25 to 30 minutes, they didn't care at all. Meanwhile, people were going to the bar and getting food, choosing to eat outside and getting food, etc. It was just the people waiting for tables inside that weren't being seated. One of the hostesses was also texting on her cell phone, and when my boyfriend called the Chevy's phone number just to see if they'd pick up, no one answered the phone yet again. (Three hostesses - one couldn't be on phone duty?) When my dad saw that the manager was talking to the hostesses, he went over to express his frustration to her that we had been waiting so long and that there were plenty of open tables. The only thing the manager had to say was, \\"I understand sir. We're working on it.\\" Ten minutes later, we finally got seated, although still without any sign of kindness, just a pathetic \\"Again, we apologize for the wait.\\" In actuality though, that was the first apology we had actually received, and the hostess didn't really seem to mean any of it. \\n\\nWe really should have left way before this point, given the carelessness of the entire staff as to the operation of the restaurant. Our waiter was the one exception though, and we did feel really bad for him because he went from having no tables (and therefore, no tips) to being swamped with tables (after the manager told the hostesses to seat everyone at once, after \\"giving the kitchen a break\\"). When we questioned the new menu, which was very limited compared to the old one, he seemed to have heard the same complaint before. He also seemed to expect our questioning if there was a more mild salsa, as the updated salsa is much spicier than the previous version. The chips are also not as light - why change the best part of Chevy's?!?! I don't get some of the changes. The management is clearly more concerned with the bar crowd than the regular dinner crowd. There are more drinks on the menu and less food. The food was ok, but there were issues with it as well - like the top of the pepper left in my dad's chile relleno and the lack of chicken in my chicken flautas. The portions were also smaller - they're clearly trying to make Chevy's more upscale, but changing what worked before is not the way to do it. And the number one factor in an upscale restaurant? Service. The managers might want to look into it. \\n\\nAt one point during dinner, the manager came by with an incredibly fake smile on her face to ask if everything was better now. We just stared at her in disbelief and she left. Nothing else was ever said about anything - no apologies from the manager or anyone else. \\n\\n1. Do not expect a normal Chevy's. 2. Do not expect good service. 3. Just don't go. It's really not worth your time and even if you do get seated, the food isn't consistent.\\n\\nAlso, I think a lot of the 5-star reviews on here are fake given the short length and number of reviews by each reviewer. Maybe that's what the managers are focused on..."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"6607 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I love Chipotle Mexican Grill.

It was served in a fried tortilla bowl, with lettuce, cheese, gauc, pico and beef (you could choose between chicken, fajita beef or ground sirloin). The gauc was good, but a small-ish portion. It was really good. Everyone's food had huge portions and for a really great price.

Those comments are just more of an FYI for expectations, I don't hold it against them because they're clearly trying to be more of a \\"clean\\" eating spot. I had the salmon poke which was pretty good but lacked flavor and I realize now after seeing other people's pictures of their salmon poke that the sauce for the entire dish was left off of my place, which is probably why I was left confused with the bland flavor of my dish. Husband got the kimchi beef and thought it was tasty, however I would say for $16 dishes, the portions were a bit small, we left still hungry, but it's a healthy place with quality ingredients so I guess that's fine. My cucumber ginger agua Fresca was really good, but husbands margarita was odd. Again, I'm assuming it's because they replaced the typical sugary simple syrup with blood orange flavored water, so it did in fact taste like tequila and water, just an FYI.

If you read my previous review, I used to come here A LOT, and it started from when they first opened in Richmond. My mom and I would come here for the fish-pork liver-kidney congee while my dad would get the chicken fried rice. We almost always ordered these two items. Therefore, we knew, first hand, what these two items tasted once upon a time.\\n\\nLast night, I came here with my parents and ordered the same two items. The fried rice came first and my dad pointed out how the portion had drastically decreased. Our congee came. As a ritual, I'd eat the liver and my mom would eat the fish. I scooped the liver into my own bowl and wanted to help my mom with her fish. Instead of a couple of decent sized fish, all I saw was tiny white cubes (1-2 cm). So I called the waitress and said that we had ordered the one with the fish in it. I showed her my own bowl as well as the congee bowl, and both of them clearly didn't have (much) fish. She got the other waitress to at the counter to check my order, and I did order the fish one. The waitress then brought my bowl back to the kitchen. 2 minutes later she came back and pointed at the 2 cm fish and said here is your fish, and that these tiny white pieces in my bowl are the fish as well. I have ordered this congee too many times to count, I know what the fish should look like, and it's definitely not what i had last night. The kitchen didn't even bother to \\"fix\\" the issue. \\n\\nWith the portion issue aside, these two items no longer tasted what they were before. The other times I came here for breakfast and lunch, the food was just a disappointment as well. The quality since No. 9's establishment has gone down by a lot.

There was a man playing piano there, and the ambiance was great. My second thought was that this was the kind of place my parents would love. That's not a dig at my parents or the restaurant, but I felt that my husband and I (less than 30) might not be the primary clientele. It felt like an upscale suburban steak house. That being said, there's a huge value in venues like that. They're crowd pleasers, and are usually really dependable. I've marked Truluck's as a place I could easily bring in laws or visitors when they're in town, but they don't want to venture into the more eclectic vibe Austin can offer. \\n\\nWhen we were seated, they spread confetti across the table in recognition of my husband's birthday, which my reservation had made note we were celebrating. I thought that was an awesome, above average touch. The service from everyone was phenomenal, the waiter was friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations from the menu.   \\n\\nThe wine list impressed me: the range of prices in particular was great. There were bottles we could easily order without breaking the bank, and some that edged towards that special occasion price. Despite this, we both ended up with cocktails, mine a spicy margarita and his a Manhattan. I've had some amazing cocktails (and some terrible) in Austin, and these totally held up to the high standard. \\n\\nMy scallops were perfectly cooked and very flavorful, and my husband's steak was a properly cooked medium rare. We both had parmesan mashed potatoes as a side, and those were tasty, fluffy, and not offensively starchy. Finally, they brought us a beautiful, flaming s'mores desert. Truluck's hit all the checkboxes. Service was good, the venue was quiet enough for a romantic evening, the food was tasty, and the live music was played at a pleasant volume throughout the venue. It's not an everyday place, but I'll totally return."},{"name":"Hai Ky","address":"3808 Spicewood Springs Rd, Ste 104","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to Hai Ky three times now, and am pretty happy with it.

The Pho is pretty good, and I liked the Pad Thai (not the ketchup style sauce that too many places use).  We asked them to warm up our hot tea (it was lukewarm) and they snapped to it.  \\n\\nWhat else - the vermicelli only had a fish sauce with it, not another sauce, one difference from Triumph.

It was 3 pieces, with a cheddar-chive waffle or you can substitute the waffle for 2 delicious and large biscuits. The breast was a little dry, but the other two pieces, a drumstick and a thigh, were fine. You'll note that I've only given this place 2 stars. The reason is simple: they serve some of the weakest drinks I've ever had at any establishment. The drinks were attractively presented, but basically, the glasses were filled to the brim with ice and appeared to consist mainly of mixers combined with eyedropper amounts of alcohol. With the amount of ice they used, it seemed beyond the pale that they would also skip so much on the alcohol. The drinks were a total joke. My husband got a hamburger which came with toast for the bun, instead of a traditional bun. The problem was that the toast was no match for the sauce that was on the burger and the entire thing fell apart in his hands while he was trying to eat it, making a huge mess. So, when I add up the dried breast, the ice-filled, weak-as-hell drinks, and the super messy burger, it comes out to 2 stars. Both those stars were for our excellent waitress, who made the experience pleasant regardless of the overall poor quality of the food and drink.(Maybe one more half-star for the nice decor.) She was super friendly and extremely attentive. Will we be back? Probably not, because it seems silly to pay that much money for drinks that basically tasted like fruit punch. Oh, well.

I ordered the \\"Ooh La La Belly\\" and I've never had a more flavorless slab of pork belly in my life. Typically pork belly is marinated in a mixture of sugar, salt, and sometimes black pepper for 6-24 hours which helps give it a flavorful, caramelized, and unctuous character. This was just a bland slab of fat. This bland slab was served over equally bland roasted potatoes, pico de gallo that lacked salt, acid and ultimately character, a hint of sour cream, avocado, and a duck egg.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the \\"Berried French Toast\\" which was only slightly less underwhelming than my dish. It consisted of two pieces of French toast with six to ten blueberries in lieu of the compote promised in the description. A compote, by the way, is fruit cooked down or preserved in syrup. There was absolutely no compote. There was also whip cream, maple syrup, and two pieces of bacon.\\n\\nIn summation, it's a friendly and nice enough place but it does not cut the muster in a town like ours where great food is around almost every corner. Cooking is more than just applying heat to food, cutting, peeling, and slicing.

The cashier wasn't the friendliest, she didn't explain anything to us and seemed a bit impatient with me and my boyfriend but everyone else I encountered was super friendly and welcoming. I love the option of getting to pick whether I want grilled or fried tenders. So I ordered the grilled 5 pc and the loaded fries (to share) because balance! The loaded fries were delicious, the cheese sauce and the seasoning were amazing and it comes with fried chicken tender chunks inside. I didn't like the bacon (it was more like bacon bits) because they didn't taste fresh. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the grilled tenders are served on skewers which make it less messy to eat, not sure about the fried tenders. The sauce options are great too but I'm not really a sauce person. I did try the garlic parmesan sauce and it wasn't my favorite but honestly my chicken did not need any sauce.

Myself and several friends went to The Butcher Shop for a Restaurant Week dinner. I realize that one is always living on the edge with restaurant week - restaurants SHOULD see it as a chance to showcase their strengths to a new audience, but I think it is hated by waiters and so many restaurants don't put on their A game. I'm about ready to give up on it, frankly. Anyway, The Butcher Shop brought it's \\"F\\" game for restaurant week. We had an early reservation - 6:30 - and we did not receive our entrees until 8:40. I'm all for a relaxed dinning experience, but TWO HOURS? Since there were only two entrees on the restaurant menu, I don't know how it could have been so complicated in the kitchen. During this time, our personality-free waiter NEVER came to apologize for the wait. But it gets worse - when our food finally arrived, the portions were not only microscopic, but the steak for  two out of the five diners in my group was improperly cooked - and WAY improperly cooked. So, after waiting more than two hours for their entrees, they had to be returned, and of course, one can never cook a piece of meat properly after it's already been removed from the grill. As one of our party noted \\"a burger joint will cook your meat the way you ask for it.\\" And might I note that the place is named THE BUTCHER SHOP???? Our waiter took those two meals off the bill, but nevertheless the mood was ruined. Wine is a minimum of $11 a glass, outrageous even for fine dining in Boston. My husband and I have been to The Butcher Shop for appetizers and drinks before going elsewhere for dinner in the South End. We've enjoyed those experiences immensely but now that we have a 1-year-old our nights out are rare. It kills me that I wasted a rare night out on this place.

The fried snapper is served whole - fins, eyes, teeth, are all included - so don't be thrown off.  The fish tasted so fresh and tasty!  It was served with a few sides (plantains, ground yucca, fries, salad) so come hungry or plan to share it.        \\n\\nThe fish muqueca is a delicious stew served with probably cod or haddock in a clay pot (that's what it is cooked in) and then mixed with really fresh cilantro, tomatoes, and onions.

Despite the number of awesome fried chicken options we have here in Vancouver, Nashville hot chicken isn't a thing. But I love fried chicken and I love spicy food so I was eager to try out what DL has to offer.\\n\\nI was lucky enough to come by the drive on Italian Day, where they had the window open for sandwich service ahead of their grand opening June 13th. My boyfriend and I decided to split a sandwich (this required a lot of self control) so that we could eat more during the festival. Usually $12, the hot chicken sandwich was $10 for a special intro price and damn, this was worth every single penny. \\n\\nYou get a huge piece of juicy chicken breast, battered perfectly with a nice crunch in their DL hot sauce. I was honestly blown away by how juicy the chicken was despite it being white meat, and the breading adheres very nicely. The homemade slaw leans towards the more sweet and sour side, and really cuts through the greasiness of the whole thing. Their house pickles are also very sweet, and I love their choice of potato buns for the bread. DL sources them from a local small batch baker called Livia Sweets and they are the perfect vehicle for this delicious mess. The texture is nice and soft, easy to get a good grip on, and pillowy with a slight sweetness at the end.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that I didn't really find the chicken very hot. Perhaps that's my fault for ordering it medium on their heat scale, but I did want to experience the sandwich in a way that I could really taste all the components. With that being said, I'll just go straight for the hot (or more) on my next visit. As a whole, this sandwich lived up to my expectations and gets two thumbs up!

We walked into a meticulously clean dining area with an ample bar directly in front of us.  \\n\\nOnce we sat we were greeted by a friendly server with a warm smile.  Because an NFL game was on that night they offered an appetizer special which consisted of beef ribs and slider meatballs for $1.50 apiece!  Please note that I am ordinarily not a fan of beef ribs because they are generally too fatty as compared to the baby back or pork ribs.  However, these beef ribs were not only fall-off-the-bone good, they were expertly trimmed and slathered in a barbecue sauce that was not the candy sweet sauce you find in most rib joints but a savory, tangy and perfectly seasoned blend that knocked my socks off.  The slider meatballs were terrific for several reasons.  First and foremost the meatballs were North End delicious.  Secondly there was just the right touch of marinara which is important because too much would make it not only messy to eat but create a soggy bun.  Finally, any good sandwich is only as good as the roll.  These rolls were airy and bakery fresh.  Homerun!\\n\\nLastly, I had the mixed grill which consisted of barbecue steak tips (normally I order my tips naked because again, the prevailing wisdom around these parts is sticky sweet, often with a Coca-Cola base, makes for good eating...not!) that featured a light barbecue dressing that was tangy though not too sweet.  It seemed to be a lighter version of the sauce found on the beef ribs.  The Italian sausage was flattened out but tremendously tasty.  And the coup de gras was a rack of pork ribs that were as succulent as you would find anywhere.  This dish came with steak fries seasoned with sea salt complemented by a cucumber/pickle round and cherry pepper to finish it off.\\n\\nThe Mussels in garlic and white wine were also a hit as was the colossal shrimp prepared in the same manner as the mussels.  Colossal shrimp is ordinarily an oxymoron but wait until you get a look at these sea delicacies!\\n\\nOur server was affable, attentive and helpful throughout without being overbearing.  The ambience was the epitome of cozy.  All we needed was a light snowfall to complete the picture.  Plenty of room between tables which is always a welcome sight especially if you are bigger than the average bear.\\n\\nEJ Cabot's is an absolute must if you enjoy fine food at a reasonable price. Based on my experience, there are no cooks at EJ Cabot's...only chefs.

It is my go to spot to take friends to show off what Portland can offer. It's one of those places where the food is so good you know it has to be unhealthy, so you only go on special occasions as a special treat for yourself.\\n\\nSo a few things:\\n1. The french toast is amazing. Make sure to mix the white cream on top. The toast is so packed with so many flavors. I use to never order this toast, because who pays $12+ for 4 small tiny splices smothered in sauce. But smarter people have shown me the way. This toast is life changing. Try it. Don't think about it, just try it. You will thank me.\\n\\n2. Burmese Pork Stew - Very good. Chunks of pork with a sweet yet spicy flavor cut with dry rice all mixed in with one wet egg and one done Asian style. Very good. Said it twice.\\n\\n3. Chicken Fried Chicken. Yes, this is also very good. The chicken in itself is a juicy fried chicken that you probably could get somewhere else, but the beauty of this dish is the venison gravy lathered over biscuits. The biscuits are fluffy and buttery. When combined with this venison gravy it just pops.\\n\\n4. Dutch Baby - It's good, but it's like saying Allen Crabbe is good! Yes he wasn't bad this year, but he isn't Damian Lillard or even CJ. He's Allen Crabbe. Come off the bench and bring good flavors, but it isn't why you are having a good morning.\\n\\nFinally:\\nLine is always about 30-80 minutes long (the place is tiny). I hate waking up early for brunch so do the following... go around 10:50AM, put your number down and go across the street to Hopworks Brewery. Drink a few beers or check out one of the hundred random cafe's.

My girlfriend and I were waiting for a couple others and their kids to arrive so we decided to grab a couple of drinks and quick app in the gaming area during that time. The bar area had about 15 others seated and 4 bartenders with what seemed to be a manager as well. The manager was an older woman, very sloppily dressed and had poor service as well as food and beverage handling skills. 2 bartenders were actually doing their jobs while the other 2 were eating behind the bar, mixing drinks (not for customers) and drinking them, playing with their hair (touching food that was brought to the bar for other customers and then leaving it for someone else to tend to) as well as avoiding customers at all costs by \\"looking busy\\" if someone tried to get their attention... in other words,  stood in front of the register and clicked buttons. Mind you, the \\"manager\\" was present during this and never corrected their actions once or had someone tend to service the customers with the food that had been waiting.  Now, I observed all this in the 20-25 minutes it took to even be greeted or receive a menu. The menus were in poor condition and very sticky.  The bartender practically tossed the menus to us with an attitude because he was trying to eat behind the bar rather than work (the only male that was working as a bartender that night). I ordered a couple beers and an order of fries because I honestly doubt their bartending staff can correctly mix a drink simply based off of the time I observed them. A request to be closed out post ordering resulted in the not so bright bartenders saying the needed a card on file for the orders. You only need cards on file to start tabs. Even people who have never bartend a day in their lives know that. Needless to say, it took 5 or so minutes to get these individuals to properly close out our bill. 2 beers that require no talent to pop the caps off of took 30 minutes to receive and the fries took 45 and were cold. I honestly would never come back here due to the unprofessionalism, multiple health code violations, lack of customer service in the main gaming/bar area and so on. This place needs to be inspected heavily and needs a whole new structure.  Also, big issue... they did not card me or at 3 other people that came to be serviced at the bar.

My entree was grilled shrimp in a creamy chipotle sauce on top of a creamy spinach risotto. It was perfect.\\n- Management: while we were waiting on a table, the man who was clearly the manager, came by and asked if we would like anything to drink while we waited.

We didn't have a reservation and it was a VERY busy night so we understood that part. First they sat us at the wrong table... a table that I wish we could have kept if it meant we may have had a different server.\\n- I can hardly put into words how horrible the service was when it came to ordering drinks. Our server was so incredibly overwhelmed by more than one order. One water...got it. One Sprite? Hold on sir, I need to write this down.

Kept having to remind him that we were in his section. \\n\\nA friend at my table had ordered a house margarita and it took over 45 minutes to get there. No exaggeration. We continued to follow-up with our server each time he came by, but his response never changed \\"we are really busy right now. you have about 20 orders before you\\". I finished my margarita and ordered a beer along with another person at the table. The two beers came out and still no margarita. The server saw we were clearly upset by this and said, \\"I can send a manager to talk to you\\". It was infuriating. We don't need to talk about it. We don't want anything for free. How about you go tell your manager to make my margarita? Hey, bring me the tequila and I'll make it! No problem! \\n\\nMaybe it was just a bad night. Maybe it was his first day ever in a restaurant.

The dinner started with a loaf of bread served in a hot (very hot) pan. The server didn't mention the pan's temperature so my fingers weren't happy for a few seconds! Loved the bread as it was fluffy and came with a yummy butter. For a starter, we had the grilled calamari. I liked the saltiness and flavour of the calamari, which was tender and cooked well. The steaks were a good portion size but didn't compare to other prime rib steaks I've had. I thought there wasn't enough flavour in the steak itself and there wasn't enough sauce to compensate.

We corrected this huge culinary hole on Saturday by going to The Butcher Shop for lunch. I have never, ever seen less than 20 people inside this restaurant. It always seems so busy that we always discount it as a place to go to for dinner because we think there's no way we will be seated quickly. While walking past on Saturday, we only saw on table taken and a list of lunch specials that sounded absolutely delicious. We walked in and sat down at the bar.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is a very stylish layout. There's a large bar with a few high tops along the window and a large butcher block in front of some refrigerators filled with meats and other items for sale. All the servers in black t-shirts and jeans making for a very casual feel (we were nervous about eating here because we were just in t-shirts) and the butcher in his whites with a tie breaking down some meats.\\n\\nAbby went with the duck hot dog and I went for the BLT. Some Italian soda bread was placed in front of us along with some butter (topped with salt) and organic honey. The honey was no ordinary honey...I forget the process it went through that our bartender explained to us. However, after one small bite, we both were hooked. I think all restaurants should provide this honey and salted butter to be served with bread. Fan-freaking-tastic.\\n\\nAfter a short wait, our mains arrived. The tomatoes in my BLT stole the show of my sandwich. One would think the massive amount of bacon I got would be the main attraction, but the tomatoes were just so fresh and so perfect in this sandwich that that is all I can remember. The only way I think one could prefect this sandwich is to replace the Helman's mayo with Miracle Whip...however, maybe that's not a good idea because the tangy MW might take away from the sweetness of the fresh tomatoes. Abby's duck hot dog was likewise \\"to die for\\". I definitely enjoyed how little of a bun she got so there was no mistake that the duck hot dog was the star of that plate. And that was one damn good hot dog. I was very surprised that the sweetness of the brioche bun didn't make the entire dish too sweet (what with the duck and all) but it was perfect. The homemade potato chips earn my highest praise because it reminded me of my own potato chips. (This is not to say these chips were amateurish in any way, it was just that they were seasoned with a lot of pepper which is how I do it at home.)\\n\\nAt the end of our meal, we purchased a little 3oz jar of the honey for $3. The meal was decently priced too, with both entrees being $10 or less. And for the quality of our food, those prices might have been bargains. We will definitely be back to try their salumi's and charcuterie and give dinner a try too.

The malayu-styled curry is no joke; it's more dense than most curries, but insanely rich. Almost like gravy!

The roti was a little greasy, but more crispy and buttery than one would expect from something so greasy! \\n\\nSpeaking of greasy, the chicken was quite so. I want to say the chicken itself was juicy, but the outside batter was so thick and DRIPPING with grease that it only served as a distraction. Not so much a fan!

Meh. \\n\\nHonestly, I didn't feel it was worth it.

I guess that's a clean way to go, but before she began handling the food she sneezed between 6-12 times, turning away from the food luckily, but then got started right after.  For the sauces, she didn't use a spoon or ladle, she used a plastic dipping cup, which meant her gloves had to touch the inside of the cup/the sauce itself.  From there she used the same hands to pick up the cheese, 3 meats, and three veggies, including minced garlic.  Then, in the same gloves, made my wife's, which had ricotta.  Ricotta is not a solid, so to watch her hand scoop the ricotta and flick it on the pizza wasn't very appetizing.

I left home around 3:30pm in Pennsylvania and didn't get to my hotel in Orlando until 11pm.  This was one of very few nearby places still open, so I did eat the food and tried to ignore the food handling concerns because I was starving and exhausted.\\n\\nWould love to see them add spoons into their wet ingredients and just have very clean hands instead of rubber gloves handling the food, but that's just me.  Maybe this was because they already started packing up and I caught them really late.  Great concept.  Good food.  Good prices.

It's always been a funny spot: the service is poor, the food product is ok, the prices are probably a little too expensive, the cleanliness is somewhat questionable, and there's usually some minor drama going on there.\\n\\nIt's really hard to blame the staff, they're all college kids and I've been in enough times to gather that the manager / owner figure is oppressive and difficult to work for, just ask them. The restaurant runs poorly because it's poorly laid-out and no-one is trained on any process; in fact it would appear to me that there is no process of any kind. Management FAIL.\\n\\nIt pisses me off that there's a sign above the register stating that the staff doesn't necessarily get any of the tips they've earned and that any additional money collected belongs to the establishment. Why does the service suck? Could it be because the incentive has been removed? Management FAIL.\\n\\nAnd it rubs me the wrong way that they don't offer a local's discount or a loyalty program of any kind. Why would you want your best customers to come back? Management FAIL.\\n\\nStill, I've been a quasi-regular for a while out of convenience.\\n\\nBut today when ordering my regular sandwich, apparently the owner / manager heard my order and instructed the cashier to charge me $3 more than I've ever been charged before, then disappeared into the basement office. (I ordered extra meat on the sandwich, which is normally $3, but today it was $6.) When I got to the register, I argued with the cashier about the price she told me she was instructed to do it. An assistant manager girl observed the dispute and offered no support to the cashier or help to make me happy. I told them I wouldn't return and no one tried to make it right. The cashier was upset left in a huff to the same office into which the owner had previously disappeared. Neither one presented themselves again. Management Uber - FAIL.\\n\\nGame over Salvaggio's. I'm out, and I think everyone else should be too.\\n    \\nGod, give me grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed (Salvaggio's), Courage to change the things which should be changed (it's rating on Yelp), and the Wisdom to never return again.\\n\\nI wish I could get the Food Network to do a Restaurant Impossible episode on this place. I'd pay money to watch Robert Irvine break-down this weak, ridiculous manager / owner, he's probably the type that would start crying about his ineffectiveness.

Upon walking in you're greeted by a very coffee-shop vibe. A mish-mash of mismatched tables and chairs, a couple of chalkboards sporting a menu of coffee drinks, a slick La Mazorcco machine, and, uh, a nice big pizza oven in the back? Yup. By morning, Gladstone Coffee fits its name perfectly, making allegedly very tasty drinks with locally-roasted Stumptown coffee (I didn't actually try the coffee), and by night (Weds-Saturday) they offer a full menu of Neapolitan-style thin-crust pizzas as well as some other tasty fare.\\n\\nWe stopped in with a group on Friday night to try out this now-infamous pizza and were pleasantly surprised. With topping options like Mozzarella di Bufala, Boqerones, andoullie sausage, and similar, the menu alone drives one to salivate. We started with a family-style caesar, and it was the highlight of the night for me. Rarely do I find a caesar that matches my recipe - garlicky, anchovy-y, tangy, and not creamy at all. Delicious. I could eat this all day.\\n\\nFor pizzas, rather than split a large, Hilary and I decided to each order a smaller Neapolitan personal-size pie each. I went for the anchovy and onions, and Hilary opted for the margherita di bufala. While both were quite tasty, hers was the easy victor.

I definitely will be checking one of these out on my next visit. \\n\\nThe truly stand-out part of these pizzas, at least on this visit, was the crust. The crust was amazing.

It's sad to me that this place has any good reviews, as Ohioans apparently don't really have much to choose from, as I've found out. Being from the northeast my expectations are much higher. To begin with this place is WAAAAY over priced. Not only for this area, but for any place that I've been. Fried rice for $8.50? Really? I made the mistake of ordering fried chicken livers (I know, not everyone's favorite, but it is mine). For $7.25, when livers are less than $2.00 a pound, I expected they would come maybe with a nice light tempura batter, or (as I've experienced) in a nice brown sauce with walnuts. Nope. They were in a pint box, with ... nothing. They were sort of a grayish brown and were badly overcooked. My first bite made me gag and I promptly threw them away in disgust. In fact, just about everything was overcooked. The beef teriyaki was like chewy leather, the fried wontons were slightly less hard than a rock would be, the chicken wings were dry and had very little taste, and the egg roll smelled bad and had a bit of a strange after taste. As for the shrimp fried rice, I'd hardly call what was in there shrimp. They were very small with virtually no taste, as the whole dish was basically bland and tasteless.

Particularly the Kendall Square location. The Seaport location and the Assembly Row locations both have disappointed me on multiple occasions before I felt like I had to write this. \\n\\nRecently stopped in on a Saturday night and we ordered wings, a Pit Boss w/ brisket, pork belly burnt ends, and pulled pork along with a 1/2 slab rib plate. Sides included corn bread, zucchini salad, coleslaw, mac n cheese, and baked beans. You know its disappointing when the sides were better than the BBQ meats. I'd say the mac and the beans were best, whereas the cornbread was quite underwhelming.\\n\\nI always order the wings because I have fond memories of them from the first time I went to Smoke Shop in Kendall. Juicy, plump, seasoned and cooked to perfection. On subsequent visits to the other locations I have been met with small, bland and extremely dry wings. Ribs were not \\"fall off the bone\\" tender and were so dry and chewy the server had to refill my water about 5 times throughout. Unfortunately the array of tasty sauces they had couldn't even save the meat itself. Brisket was the best protein and the pulled pork was okay.\\n\\nLastly, I don't know why these other locations seem to always serve their food borderline cold/lukewarm at best. Is it an issue with communicating between staff? Is there no quality control? Will check out Kendall again next time around, REALLY hope it hasn't gone downhill. Otherwise, Blue Ribbon BBQ is the place to go if you want BBQ around Boston.\\n\\nTLDR; Stars for the sides and service, ambiance is great.

And affordable too! Tried Lebanese food for the first time here, and it's very much like Turkish, Greek, Persian, etc. And since I love those cuisines, I loved this place!\\n\\nFirst time here I odered the Kefta Kebab wrap for lunch. Though a bit on the small side, it was full of flavor! I pretty much inhaled that thing, longing for more afterward, which usually doesn't happen, which means it's super good or that it needs to be bigger--I think it may be both.\\n\\nSecond time I came I brought my husband. I had the beef shwarma platter. It was soooo good. Beef was tender. Their babaganoush was very very tasty, while the pita bread was OK (wished it was softer and puffier, because while it was warm when it came out, it got cold and hard pretty quickly). All the little items on the platter like the hummus, tabouli, pickled radishes were full of flavor and very fresh. I think all that for $9.75 is not bad at all. Portion was decent for the platters as opposed to the individual wraps. My husband liked his chicken shwarma wrap as well--he ordered the combo, which is the wrap and a salad or soup. Now I know to order the COMBO for lunch to get filled up instead of just getting a wrap, and it's only $6.49 I believe.\\n\\nAnyway, great spot for quick and tasty Lebanese food!"},{"name":"Pasta Da Pulcinella","address":"1123 Peachtree Walk NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Best lunch in Atlanta.

It has an extensive menu of breakfast and lunch bagels and sandwiches. There's a good selection of vegetarian choices. It's not as cheap as the chains but it's better. The cost of a meal is about $8 to $10. It's still kind of high. The tahini mocha is the best drink. It's so rich and smooth and is best for when on the patio in warmer weather. The Mo bagel is really good. It's a long and skinny Jerusalem bagel that comes with a side of hummus topped with fruit and olives. The tofu salad is another excellent choice. It comes on a bialy bagel. The prices are what I have a problem with. I understand it uses better quality ingredients here. They still need to bring their prices in line with the area if they are to keep people coming in. \\n\\nIzzy and Mo's is a great addition to the bagel scene.

However, the capellini pomodoro was quite a disappointment. Far from the blossoming sweet blended sensation I expected, the sauce was almost bitter and somehow managed to put the tomato and the basil in conflict, leading to abrupt and jarring changes of flavor. It wasn't awful but it was a long, long way from the bar set by the ambiance, the artichokes, the ravioli and the price.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I recommend Chianti Cafe for romance, jazz with dinner and delicate cream sauces that compliment and enhance their dishes."},{"name":"NFA Burger","address":"5465 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd, Inside the Chevron, Salim Thobani's Chevron","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4.5","text":"Really, really, good burger, this place is worth a visit.

We were pleasantly surprised to have a pianist playing a mix of pop hits while we dined and we had a fun time trying to guess the names of the various songs he was interpreting with his own style.\\n\\nAfter reviewing their tablet which contained their drink menu, we opted for the Imperial Pear ($8 for a single) and Zen Cucumber ($8 for a single), both of which were quite refreshing. Our friendly server also brought us out some pan bread with blue cheese butter. Let me tell you, this bread was really good! I didn't want to get too full on the bread but it was served warm in the cast iron pan and had a nice, light crispness to the exterior while the insides were fluffy and perfect with the creamy blue cheese butter.\\n\\nWhile you can get your Caesar Salad ($14) prepared tableside if you have at least 2 orders, we didn't really want 2 salads so we just opted for 1 salad (which isn't prepared tableside). It was a good thing too because this was a rather large salad that we wound up sharing between the two of us. This was a fairly traditional Caesar salad with heart of romaine, parmegiano-reggiano cheese, and a light Caesar dressing.\\n\\nIf you enjoy steak and seafood, you'll have no problem finding something you like here. As with most traditional steakhouses, sides are extra so you have to give some thought as to what should accompany your main.\\n\\nThe West Coast Bouillabaisse ($30) was simply amazing! The seafood here (including black tiger prawns, mussels, clams, salmon, and rock fish) all tasted so fresh and I loved how big and plump the mussels were. But the real winner here was the rich and creamy San Marzano tomato and lobster broth.\\n\\nFor our side dish, we picked the Josper Roasted Vegetables ($8) which had a nice mix of asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, beets, and Brussels sprouts. Not exactly a \\"wow\\" dish but we felt we needed to get some veggies in our meal.\\n\\nThis is what I came for... the 16oz Chili Rubbed Cowboy Rib Steak ($65) from 40-day aged certified angus beef. They recommended that it be prepared \\"medium\\" due to the amount of marbling but I asked for \\"medium-rare\\" and I'm glad I did. It was cooked perfectly and sat on a \\"warm potato salad\\" which really isn't what you think it is. The meat was so tender, juicy, and flavourful... damn!\\n\\nEven though we were super full, we opted for dessert. They're known for their baked Alaska but we needed something a bit lighter so we went with the Frozen Trio ($10) which turned out to be Early Grey Ice Cream, Peach Sorbet, and Dulce Gelato with strawberries and pineapple.\\n\\nOverall, dinner here was really good and the atmosphere was great for a date night. I think part of the appeal for us was the table location as we were able to do a bit of people watching and we weren't too close to the piano that it was too loud (we did see a number of diners seated at tables that surrounded the piano eventually move to quieter tables) but we were close enough to be able to see him tickling the ivories.\\n\\nWe came back to try their lunch service in mid-December and managed to sit in the same lounge area. We were lucky that the same piano player was there so we enjoyed our meal with some live music. First off... drinks! We liked the Zen Cucumber last time so we ordered it again and paired it with an El Diablo with Sauza Silver Tequila, blackberry carbonated ginger ale.\\n\\nAs it was close to Christmas-time, they had a winter set menu available ($35 for 3 course meal) which included this Butternut Squash Salad as well as a main course of turkey breast with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts and dessert. The squash was quite tender but made for a filling appy.\\n\\nI decided to order from their regular lunch menu because I wanted to try the Lobster Bisque ($10) served with seared scallop and roe. To be honest, I think this soup lacked the rich lobstery punch that I'm used to and the flavour was too muted.\\n\\nThe Turkey Breast turned out pretty good and I've always got a soft spot for Brussels sprouts. Odd since I never enjoyed them as a kid.\\n\\nFor my main, I opted with the Mussels and Frites ($19) OMG, these frites were amazing! They had a nice crispness to the exterior and they were sprinkled with a cheesy mayo-type dressing.\\n\\nThe mussels were served in a cast iron skillet and accompanied with chorizo in a tomatoey broth.\\n\\nFor the dessert in the 3-course meal, they brought out Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e with Chocolate-Dipped Biscotti.\\n\\nOverall, I've been quite pleased by the meals that I've had at Atlas.

All of the food that we ordered was incredibly fresh, including a TOWER of seafood that included everything from crab legs to mussels to smoked salmon.

The one that isn't sprawling with bugs, fairly clean, and of course, cooks your general tso chicken like no one else. China Cafeteria so happens to be that for me. I've been coming here faithfully since I've moved to Atlanta almost 3 years ago.\\n\\nThis restaurant is definitely reasonably priced as for most chinese takeouts. However, the quality of their food is what stands out to me. Some chinese take outs can serve up some extremely greasy food that definitely makes you regret it later. However, I believe china cafeteria does a great job at not having that problem. The food is always served hot, and fresh. They're great at making sure your requests are maintained as well. For example, I like my lo mein noodles spicy, which isn't an option on the menu. However, I always request the additional spice, and surely they are done so to perfection every time.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a killer lunch buffet, that is all you can eat with a drink for around $8. Not bad. They serve up man common americanized options such as Beef/chicken w/ broccoli, hibachi chicken, black pepper chicken, general tsos chicken, lo mein, fried/white rice, dumplings, and egg drop soup, just to name a few. There is seating in the restaurant, about 5-7 tables, and 2 or 3 high tops. You also have the option to carryout a lunch buffet plate for about $4/lb. \\n\\nI normally don't look to carryouts for chicken wings, however, china cafeteria serves up some great wings. A favorite of mine are the BRAISED wings. A signature sweet and spicy asian sauce that'll have you asking for a bottle to-go. The wings are nice sized and come in 4, 6, 10, and 20 pc options with a choice of rice. the 20pc is only $10.95, which is a deal for that quantity most anywhere you go.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some good chinese food. The food is normally ready in about 10min when ordering or calling in. Never a long wait.

The chicken was great, simple and rustic but the pork shoulder sandwich was like OMG holy wow deliciousness!  Highly recommend.  I will be dreaming about that sandwich in Florida!  Service was good, and the ambience is awesome.  It's in an old hotel lobby and the decor on the walls and staircase are old printing press plates giving it a bit of color and funkiness.  The rest of the decor is reminiscent of decades past.  Didn't try any of the cocktails, but they apparently make the mixing soda recipes from scratch!!  Sounds awesome.   We had the grilled pound cake for desert and every bite was delicate and delicious. Try it!!!!

I was a bit disappointed that the menu is pretty short and especially that as far as meat goes they only offer chicken, steak, carne asada and pork belly as choices fot the tacos. My companion ordered the Pobre Bowl with pork belly and had them add some greens. It was quite a nice bowl with plentiful pork belly cubes that had been fried crispy and were still moist. I tried the 3 tacos for $8 which is a great price especially considering how much meat they do put in them. I opted to try the chicken, carne asada and the steak. By far the carne asada one was the most flavorful. The chicken one was good but just ok as was the steak. They were good for the price but not out of this world. I would certainly get them again but the Carne Asada would be my choice. I do wish they had carnitas and a couple other choice meats but... We will most certainly go back and try some other things but the menu is pretty limited. The bowl was very good.

I looked at the menu and finally picked the grilled lamb potato!!!! It had mushrooms, onions, broccoli, bell peppers (I think), and lamb. I didn't stop there I seen wings and added wings to it not knowing it would turn into a combo (potato, wings, and a drink). I got the honey lemon wings. So let me sum up this whole meal in one word - disappointing. When I got my food I was extremely excited about this food because of the way it looked first and the smells that were bursting through the container. I say it was disappointing being that it smelt soooo amazing it lacked flavor in a major way. When I eat a baked potato I expect it to be seasoned properly especially if it's going to be topped with toppings. I expected to get tender chucks or at least 1/4 to 1/2 in thick of lamb on my potato. Nope sure didn't have that, the slices of lamb were seriously paper thin to where I couldn't figure out if it was saut√©ed onion or the meat until I pulled pieces out and looked at it. Another thing that was disappointing was that the wings were tiny to where as a consumer I couldn't actually enjoy the flavor enough to where I had to eat 2 before fully getting the honey with the lemon pepper flavor. Even though my first experience wasn't the greatest I will definitely go back and try something else"},{"name":"Pasta Da Pulcinella","address":"1123 Peachtree Walk NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Tasty food good portion sizes and friendly service."},{"name":"China Hut","address":"16721 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"Chow main had no noodles what so ever, only bean sprouts or whatever m... it was also supposed to have pork, but there was none... there was an unidentifiable object, that was supposed to represent the meet, but it was white and slimy.

As the brand has gotten bigger and bigger, the prices have gone up and up, and the quality down and down. A regular combo -- beef (no, Halal Guys cheaps out and doesn't use lamb) and chicken -- costs almost $10. The servers were friendly and efficient, but my plate was half salad -- and, by salad, I mean cheap lettuce and cheap diced tomatoes. On top of that, I was charged extra for asking for a ketchup packet-sized hot sauce packet -- and, I'm not even sure if I should have been charged extra, because the receipt said I was charged for an extra white sauce packet (i.e. a sauce packet much larger than the hot sauce). The pita triangles tasted stale. When you're paying about $10 for a plate of rice, cheap salad, and cheap meat, you might as well get lunch at Chipotle or the Whole Foods hot bar and pay less for more food and significantly better quality. I doubt I will ever return to another The Halal Guys -- in New York, Atlanta, or elsewhere.

There are days where the entree options are literally pasta with chicken or pasta with meatballs. The grill has a wait up to an hour on certain days.

Well, Satu'li Canteen sure is pretty alright, but not everything is really delicious. Let's break this joint down. \\n\\nLocated in the Pandora section of Animal Kingdom, Satu'li Canteen has some indoor and outdoor seating in the Quonset-hut for you to chill at while eating to your heart's content. According to Disney, it used to be a RDA mess hall and is now a peaceful dining facility adorned with Na'vi artifacts. \\n\\nWhen we went in, there was no one in line or coming in so we went right up to the register. The lady waited a minute then told us we actually had to go through the line even with no people there, so we went back out & by the time we circled around to get in line, 6 groups got in front of us! Ha. Thanks, lady...that made no sense.\\n\\nBut on to the grub!\\n~Cheeseburger Steamed Pods are alright. In a kids meal, you get one pod for $7.49 or an adult meal comes with 2 for $10.99. With the kids meal, I got colorful veggie chips, grapes & a mini Dasani water. Now the Cheeseburger pod is really a bao with ground beef, Ketchup, Mustard, Pickle, and Cheddar Cheese. There was So.Much.Bao. as in so much dough and not nearly enough on the inside. I ended up picking a bunch of the bao off because there was just way too much of it. The flavor was alright but I didn't get the full cheeseburger experience feel from it by any means, especially didn't taste any cheese. I'd skip getting this next time.\\n~Slow-Roasted Sliced Grilled Beef ($13) marinated in a blend of Garlic, Herbs, Red Pepper Spice, and Red Wine Vinegar topped with Crunchy Vegetable Slaw and Boba Balls. This was is a great healthy option but I would recommend trying a protein other than the beef. It was dry and there wasn't much of it. As far as Disney quick service goes though, the meat, veggie & rice plates are a decent option.\\n~Blueberry Cream Cheese Mousse with Passion Fruit Curd ($5.29) clearly the star of the show! It's gorgeous and also tastes really great! If you have a sweet tooth but want something a bit less indulgent than the chocolate dessert, this will have you totally covered. Took some great instagrammable shots of this and loved the flavor combination of all the components. \\n\\nI think the newness appeal will wear off on this spot soon and it'll be just another quick service spot unless they up their flavor game with the main entrees. Pandora could great with a slightly nicer & more delicious table service spot but I digress. If you just want to knock a meal out that's semi-healthy & cheap while looking around Pandora's beautiful atmosphere, this may be the place for you. Do not skip that cheesecake though!\\n\\nPro-Tip: You can pre-order through the App on your Phone but have to use your CC if you do (no Magic Band or Dining Plan purchases through the app)."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered the lobster roll with parmesan risotto and truffle fries.

So then we wrote out all of the food and how it needs to be on each bill. This issue took 45 mins to resolve and they were screaming at us, and we just wanted to pay and leave. Some of the worst service I ever received, and extremely rude to walk away from customers who are in the middle of a sentence it happened about 10 times.

When we arrived their was a short line outside the restaurant where they were passing out menus and then pulsing us in as to not block the door. The line moved pretty quickly and I would say within about 15 minutes we were inside waiting in the short line. My fianc√© went and grabbed a table as the dining area inside was VERY limited while I ordered us a little bit of everything and went to the beverage station with my friend which had a puddle that she slipped in. She let an employee know and they just looked at it, walked away and then didn't clean it up by avoided it each time he walked by. This was about the same for all employees except one guy at the end of the lunch who was directing us around a spill and was honestly concerned for everyone's safety. \\n\\nThe food. Seeing as I had not know anyone that had been here yet, I feel like we had a little bit of everything. My fianc√© ordered the loaded fries (smothered in SMC aka- Super Melty Cheese, chopped Grilled Chicken, Bacon and Green Onions $7.99) but with no chicken and Three Tenders (Crispy Fried or Grilled All-natural plus your choice of any two Signature Sauces $5.99). I ordered the Combo with Chicken Tenders (any Sandwich or 3 Tender plus Fries and a Fountain Drink $11.49) and Fried Pickle Chips ($2.99). We got our food pretty quickly and it we enjoyed it all. My friend got a combo too, and when she ordered her fried pickles they told her that she could substitute the fries for pickles because I didn't love the fries and only ate one or two. The fired pickles were moist, crispy and absolutely delicious (no dipping sauce needed)! The loaded fries were huge, covered in toppings and packed with flavor. The chicken tenders were big pieces of chicken covered in a delicious batter. I will be returning here based on the food and prices.\\n\\nThe Sauce. Coming here I was super excited about the plethora of sauces and after some serious conversation with my fianc√© we had settled on Teriyaki and Bourbon Brown Sugar BBQ and for me we decided on Buffalo and Nashville Hot Honey. All the sauces were good and packed with flavor but I am IN LOVE with the Nashville Hot Honey as was the entire table! I could put that sauce on anything and I hope they sell this sauce in a bottle so I can have it at home!\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed Chicken Guy again but their service left something to be desired but as it only just opened I have high hopes that that will improve."},{"name":"Hand Roll Sushi","address":"12200 Menta St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I had read the other reviews before visiting and came in with a bad impression/prejudice. Some aspects of their reviews were true. This is not a Japanese authentic restaurant. The servers appeared new and confused when one of them came to take our order only just after another server had seated us with menus. This is a new establishment and appears that way. From the outside it would appear that the restaurant is very spacious being the largest division of the building however seating and table sizes were similar to a small cafe. Service was quality as the servers made sure to attend to our needs and asked/verified information about our orders. \\n\\nNow onto the food. The prices of these rolls are not cheap. They range from $6-12 which for the competition around them in central florida is not competitive at all. The ingredients and quality of the rolls were itself cheap. The imitation crab was in the same shape and appearance  as the ones you would find in a local Asian market for home sushi endeavors. The tempura shrimp in the volcano roll had a artificial smell to it. The crunch roll used Doritos/tortilla chips instead of tempura flakes which takes away from authenticity but adds to the fusion of cultures. The rainbow roll and Philadelphia Temaki had very good quality fish. Presentation was as good as other reputable sushi restaurants. Fresh fish items while reasonably portioned were a bit on the higher end price wise. \\n\\nCame here with a party of 4 with one person opting not to eat and left $80 poorer. It would've been more financially responsible for the three of us to buy the all you can eat option over the a le carte menu and I believe this would be the best option when coming to eat here. The a le carte menu prices are very pricy compared to other establishments and quality of food however a $25 unlimited rolls deal would keep me coming back. \\n\\nThis establishment requires work, lots of it. I recommend a better menu as my knowledge of popular sushi items had gotten me to make good selections but for people not familiar with sushi, pictures and visuals would definitely help. A happy hour/ lower priced a le carte menu would also be a good recommendation as $12 (half the cost for all you can eat) for a 6 piece volcano roll is nearly ridiculous to a seasoned sushi consumer like me who recognizes the cheap ingredients used. In conclusion, my 4 stars are given in the hopes that a better service is expected in the future for this growing establishment with high quality/ sourced ingredients (not Asian supermarket ones) and lower prices. Otherwise the restaurant will fall short compared to its competitors and follow a stagnant and inevitable demise."},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great bar staff headed by Stef and Maria.

Not for the faint of heart :D\\nThis was an extremely generous portion of seafood in a lobster based tomatoes sauce (perfect touch of spice) over cooked to perfection linguine.

This dish consisted of fresh salmon stuffed with lobster meat, crab meat and ricotta cheese served over a saphron risotto in a lobster brandy cream sauce. Starting with the risotto, it was amazing; not to moist, not too dry and subtly seasoned with saphron so to compliment the salmon. The salmon had great texture, perfectly baked on the outside while remaining moist and rich exploding with flavor inside from the crab, lobster and ricotta. The lobster brandy cream sauce really complimented both items of the dish tying the stuffed salmon and risotto together. Highly recommended!\\n\\n\\nWine:\\n\\nLauren our waitress made great recommendations for wine. We began our meal searching for something nice and easy to drink and enjoy that wouldn't overpower our palette. Lauren suggested we try the Negro amaro which was spot on. The wine was medium bodied with a moderate presence of tannins and red fruit while not overly dry, offering an easier drinking lush characteristic.\\n\\nTowards the conclusion of our meal we opted for a larger wine for dessert (Though the homemade Amaretto Almond Cr√®me Cake and espresso shots did sound tempting!) in which case Lauren suggested the Montepulciano del Rosso. This wine equally exceeded our expectations offering a much larger presence of tannins and dark cherries/ red fruit with a larger body. From what I gathered from both the waitress and the owner/host, this wine was made in the Abruzzo region of Italy from the Montepulciano grape varietal as opposed to other wines made from region of Montepulciano from the Sangiovese grape varietal. The Montepulciano grape varietal tends to produce bigger tasting wines.(Dinner and a wine lesson!! :D)\\n\\nIn conclusion, the ambiance was delightful, the service was very friendly and welcoming but most importantly the wine and food were amazing, unique and offered at a great value especially given some of the neighboring establishments ( in past trips to the north end I have paid $40+ for a bottle of house swill while experiencing great tasting wines and selection at Mauritzios for $28 to $34).  \\n\\nHighly recommended to those seeking great food, wine and service while avoiding \\"breaking the bank\\" which I used to associate with dinner in Boston's North End... Until now  ;)"},{"name":"Epicure Market","address":"1025 Cannon Dr, Ste 105","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"I made reservations by calling the place a day before without issue.  My husband and I ate dinner with another couple.  Staff was attentive and friendly. Maybe a tad attentive for my taste. Table got the brussel sprouts for a starter that I didn't have as they had cashews with them and I have an allergy.  I got the mussels for my entr√©e.  It was a tad different than other places more of an Asian flare.  My husband got the short ribs.  I ate a small bite and they were also ok.  I have had better but they were not bad.  The husband of the other couple got the mac and cheese and it was very good as well.  Very rich. The wife got the meatballs and I didn't taste them but she enjoyed them.  We finished the meal with a chocolate moose desert and it was excellent.  Our friends got the Elvis cake, which was a special desert.  Oh my it was really really really rich.  There was piano music playing on a Friday.  The staff was so nice not kicking us out.  We were having such a good discussion.  Once they brought us little biscuits we go the message and really did lose track of time.  Tables are close together for Texas but if you travel to Europe you are used to this.  The place wasn't that packed for us on a winter Friday night.  Our friends live around the block from this place and don't like leaving DS so I see us driving out to met them often in the future.

For those who aren't familier this is his third attempt in the Boston metro area. 10+ years ago it was Istanbul Cafe in Beacon Hill, which closed, then he tried again on Commonwealth Ave in Brighton, this also closed and now here we are in Somerville. This small restauranteur really needs to learn something in customer service. For someone who has made several failed attempts with restaurants this size, hospitality (when onsite) should be a priority but rather ego takes front seat here. Good luck getting a hello when you see him upon arrival. Thank goodness for his servers who makes up with friendly and eager to please smiles.\\n\\nNow let's get to the food. Our meals included sheppard salads and I should say they were pretty good compared to the others served in the area. The pide bread and pepper dip also were a nice compliment to the salad. We ordered the sigara borek which again pleased with it's crusty exterior and warm feta interior. My husband ordered a traditional turkish soup with lamb cubes and was able to count about 3 which was a common problem at his previous restaurants - skimping on main ingredients resulting in lack of flavor. Those not as familiar with Turkish cuisine might not pick up on this which is unfair. We waited about 35 minutes for our main courses post appetizer and upon arrival appeared ok. At closer look we noticed a layer of salt on both meals and our first bite confirmed that in fact our dishes were drenched in salt. Thank goodness the servers were frequent to fill our water because we needed it badly. I don't think I've ever had Turkish food this salty, my stomach aches just thinking about it. We followed our meals with rice pudding which was farely decent. \\n\\nTo conclude, I would say the servers are great, but avoid the egotistical owner. The food lacks quality and consistency. We'll likely avoid this place and any other future restaurant attempts. If you want great hospitality and great food try Pasha in Arlington, sure to please and consistent dishes every time."},{"name":"Zaviya Grill","address":"1212 W Parmer Ln, Unit A","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"the food was great but the service was terrible it was worse than any restaurant my family ever went.as soon as we walked and the moment we were in that restaurant no one paid attention to us ,literally had no service.we literally had to ask for everything like seats,plates and etc. then a server comes yells at us cs we asked her if she's okay and then she gives us attitude till we left. we will never go to this restaurant ever again, we only had to cs it was 11pm and this was the only restaurant that was open."},{"name":"Captain Pizza","address":"227 Maple St","city":"Middleton","stars":"3","text":"I wish I could give this place NO STARS.

The tickets are $1 each; it costs 2 tickets for only 5 minutes in the bounce house and 3 tickets for the \\"petting zoo\\" which is actually 2 baby goats, a Tupperware of chicks, and a locked cage with two unhappy bunnies in it huddled together. Ok, whatever we came prepared to spend money so the cost wasn't the problem but there were barely any animals! (Some things you should just not charge patrons for.

They both ordered fries, except at the time the food actually arrived, the food runner told us they had no fries, and the guys would have to pick other sides, and then stared at my husband apparently having expected him to memorize the menu! He's sitting there with half his food in front of him being asked to pick something else off the top of his head! We just started getting really annoyed at this point.

They didn't know how to fix it which means if you go and don't order alcohol with your food, you're overpaying.\\n\\nWe went back outside for face paint and the line was now a mile long so we just picked out pumpkins to use our remaining tickets and left.

We were warmly greeted when we arrived and promptly seated. The restaurant setting is lovely and our waiter was very smiley and friendly. We truly thought we were in for a great dinner! Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.\\n\\nMy friend and I started with the buffalo cauliflower and my husband ordered the lobster bisque. The cauliflower was flavorful and spicy so it was well complemented by the cool blue cheese dip - however, since I'm vegan I don't eat dairy so my mouth was burning. The menu boasts a lot of vegan this and that so it would have been nice if there'd been a non dairy alternative to the blue cheese dressing. \\n\\nMy husband took one spoonful of the bisque and was horrified. He didn't know what he was tasting so he asked our friend to try it. She immediately knew the bisque was rancid. We told our waiter, who apologized, yet didn't ask my husband if he wanted anything in place of the bisque. Then he told us he'd remove the bisque from the bill (gee, ya think?) - Since he didn't return with a replacement bowl we assumed the entire batch must have been thrown out.\\n\\nFor our main courses, my friend ordered the prime rib, served with braised kale; my husband ordered the lamb, served with sweet potatoes; I ordered the vegan Thanksgiving which consisted of roasted root vegetables, vegan stuffing, mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.\\n\\nMy friend thought her prime rib was tasty, though commented it could have been warmer. My husband said the lamb was delicious and very tender but barely warm. My entire plate of food was cold. Once again our waiter apologized, then took away my plate and I waited... and waited... and my husband and friend wanted to wait for my food to return before continuing to eat but their barely warm food but getting colder by the second so I told them to go ahead and eat.\\n\\nBy the time I received a fresh plate my husband was completely finished with his dinner. As far as the quality of my meal, the roasted veggies were hot and tasty. The stuffing was very good but there was barely more than a spoonful of it on my plate and it was lukewarm. The cranberry sauce was delicious but the mashed potatoes were absolutely horrid. The were covered in some sort of brown gravy and had a strange flavor that I can only describe as spoiled - which should have been impossible since they were vegan and shouldn't have contained any dairy. \\n\\nMeanwhile the 2 girls seated next to us were experiencing their own meal troubles. They were served their dinners, one of which was cold, before their starters. They were given a sincere apology as the cold turkey dinner was whisked away.  I should probably mention that despite being Thanksgiving, the restaurant was not completely full, so it wasn't as though the kitchen would have been overwhelmed. The holiday menu only had 5 entrees and yet half of them seemed to be leaving the kitchen cold. \\n\\nAfter dinner I wanted a cup of tea, so my husband ordered a piece of chocolate cake. It was served with some sort of whipped topping which - you guessed it - also tasted spoiled! At that point it was clearly time to go so we asked for the check.\\n\\nCan you believe our waiter actually forgot to remove the $18 rancid lobster bisque from the bill??? I mean really? So, after pointing that out and receiving yet another apology (clearly by now we'd realized that these \\"sincere\\" apologies held no actual merit), we paid our $200 bill  and got the heck out. \\n\\nWe've all had bad meals but I got the feeling that the kitchen staff at Beat Brasserie must all be either extremely inexperienced or extremely disgruntled to allow such substandard food to leave their kitchen. \\n\\nThis Thanksgiving I was thankful that none of us got sick from dinner at Beat Brasserie."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I feel like this ice cream place was overhyped after hearing rave reviews about the ice cream.

The honey lavender tasted only of lavender.  The strawberry balsamic was too sweet and couldn't taste the balsamic.  I finally chose the coava coffee (signature Oregon coffee) with cloudforest craque (basically crunchy chocolate covered coffee granules).

The open kitchen feel, along with the scattered tables and booths and a strip of patio with flowers outside is a nice balance. The ordering counter being so close to the door was a little awkward, however, and explains why once I saw a line out the door and around the corner. \\n\\nI ordered the \\"Forbidden\\" Rice bowl with shaved chicken. I liked the fact that the chicken was shaved - smaller pieces instead of chunks that went well with the small pieces of veggies and rice. The flavors were fantastic, and the bowl was a lot of food - I wasn't able to finish it. I believe that I had the apple cinnamon lemonade, (there was also rose water honey lemonade and maybe a lavender one as well?) and it was wonderful. \\n\\nI can see myself coming back here and trying different things and I will.

Homemade sausage, piles of fluffy scrambled egg, and delicious cheddar cheese shredded all over the eggs and all over the plate like a P-Town Snowpocalypse.  Homemade English muffins quickly became my new favorite carb, that is, until I tried the potato rosti.  Oh. My. God.  The rosti is large and fluffy and full of flavor.  I've seen other reviewers refer to them as similar to hash browns.  Sure, they're made of shredded potatoes, but all similarities end there.  These are so fluffy and so magical, there must be some unicorn mixed in there somewhere.  It's the only logical explanation.

The burgers are good as well, and they make decent salads.

Somebody may come in and try to secure a table for a group that has yet to arrive, which should be easy, considering the emptiness of the restaurant; but unless the group is actually present, the restaurant won't reserve a table (again, despite the available tables).\\n\\nAll in all, M.J.

I really hope she goes to work for a really great restaurant one day bc she's a great server. I came in late and missed her name though! We were also asked several times by the manager if we were ok so in general, the service was good. It was also not busy at all as we were there at 5pm on a Monday so I would hope the service would be great. The decor is \\"retro\\" and kind of obnoxious--Sort of like some kind of Disney restaurant maybe. Not what you'd think of for a steakhouse. I think my coworkers were expecting more of a fine dining experience and, that, it was not. \\n\\nAs for the food...To make a long story short, the food is akin to what you might get in a cafeteria.... not sure what type of food-vibe they are going for or who they would appeal to. There's no culinary flare at all. Super duper generic. I guess it's a decent place If you only like meat, potatoes, and badly done veggies/salad. Real plain. \\n\\nThe \\"endless salad\\" is iceberg lettuce, not super fresh, and swimming in dressing. That was mostly their only salad option. My friend had to send a steak back twice because the medium-well kept coming out rare (she got tired of sending it back and they offered to make her something else but everyone had already eaten and the moment was gone. She did get a salmon filet to take home). They did do the right thing by comping her meal without having to ask. The sad thing is, we were there celebrating HER, and poor thing didn't get to eat. The only drinks that were ordered were 2 sangrias that were not fresh-made and the 2 ladies I was with did not like it and sent it back. The manager comped them but also brought out \\"fresh made\\" ones but they weren't much better. \\n\\nOne person ordered the filet medallions and it looked like 3 small pieces of random steak on the plate. Really tiny bites of meat.....looked silly. She didn't really eat it so I'm assuming she didn't like it. The salmon filet that I had was actually good and cooked right (I was surprised!). I ate the whole piece and had no complaints about it. It was over some rice which I didn't eat and side of veggies. However whatever you do, don't get the steamed vegetable side. They are hard and smell and taste like chemicals. It's very odd and off putting and everyone at the table could smell it and kept asking \\"what is that smell?\\" Not sure how you can mess up steamed veggies or what could have been on them to make them have that smell/taste....\\n\\nWe are all having belly aches tonight too! :-( \\nThe party of friends I was with are such polite girls and no one wanted to make a fuss but we probably could have made some real substantial complaints if we wanted to be those people.

Naomi was not there herself, and the people she left in charge in her place were uninspired at best. I did the wine pairing, and the tastings were very scanty.

Unfortunately, when we sat down, I do not think he wiped it down because the table was unbelievably sticky.\\n\\n5 minutes later, our waitress came over for our order.  This was after we looked at the menu... the smallest menu that I have seen.  I respect the fact that they want to keep it old fashioned and focus well on their small menu, but it was disappointing to see something so small.\\n\\nWe ordered, and luckily didn't wait too long for the food.  My eggs, homefries and toast were fine- I asked for well done homefries but did not receive them as so.  They were pretty warm-raw.  My gf got a mushroom omelette, the mushrooms were canned which she did NOT like, and the cheese was also not great.  My brother said he enjoyed his omelette.\\n\\nAs we were leaving, we decided that we were not coming back- we like variety.  The service was not good, we were barely approached after we got our food, we got the bill and luckily we did not need change because we probably would have had to wait for it.  The food was cheap, not good, and no variety.\\n\\nFinal decision:\\nNot worth it."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"1314 Glenwood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place isn't COLORED friendly.

She did not come back to ask how our food was, and she took the menu away while we were talking. She later came by to ask if there was anything else we wanted (after she had taken the menu) and we simply asked for the bill. She came back with the card machine and handed it to us.

One place that was showing up on a lot of radars is out in a residential area in northwest Portland, the sort of place where I would look for a really good neighborhood restaurant but probably not for a top-flight restaurant.\\n\\nBut this restaurant is Beast. It was opened in 2007 by Naomi Pomeroy, and has an unusual prix fixe format. It's like this:\\n\\n- You show up for your seating (6PM or 8:45PM; reserve well in advance) and are one of two communal tables (24 diners per seating)\\n\\n- You eat what is put in front of you-the menu is only a guide to what you will be served later. You have a choice of drinks (good wine list)\\n\\n- You try to keep from swooning as you dig into each course.\\n\\nEach course is prepared and plated at the open kitchen in the room; every seat is a chef's table seat. Ms. Pomeroy, her sous chef Ms. Paredes, and a couple of waiters and bussers run the whole show from there (okay, the sinks are in the back). Every plate is plated on the big island butcher table in the middle of the room.\\n\\nThe food, of course, is the main show. It changes every week, so any menu you see online is just a view into how Ms. Pomeroy and her staff think about food. They are all-in to the slow-food, locally-sourced, snout-to-tail philosophies.\\n\\nOur dinner started with a carrot veloute and a pickled oyster served as a large shot. We are not normally oyster people-usually I find them bitter, and Herself is just not into raw bivalves. But in this case, the shiso pickling rendered the oyster exquisitely sweet and tangy; with the carrot veloute, it was a real treat as a starter.\\n\\nThe next course was a charcuterie plate. Herself has gotten into minced organ meats in a big way of late; see the prior night's dinner for a sample. I will admit that I am still on the \\"eew! liver\\" side of the equation in most cases, especially when it's a big slab on a plate with toasts. But in this case, the course was five individual and different tastes of bits of raw and cooked meats. In this case:\\n\\n- Chicken liver mouse, on a cracker made with leaf lard\\n- A bit of salami\\n- Steak tartare, perched on the same toast as a poached quail egg\\n- Pork rillettes\\n- A foie gras truffle-a tender ball of foie gras, almost a mousse-with a tiny cube of gelled Sauternes\\n\\nPlus little dabs of mustard as seasoning. You're supposed to eat the foie gras last, as the texture and the Sauternes cube have a dessert-like sweetness. It's good advice, as is eating the tartare and egg toast in one bite.\\n\\nThe main course was roast quail stuffed with bread, herbs, and-get this-rabbit hearts. Yes, there were these little lumps that really did look tiny hearts. Where do you even get rabbit hearts? This is truly hard-core omnivorism, or maybe omnivoraciousness, in the sense of eating every bit of an animal. The quail was served with tomatoes, caramelized cauliflower, and a demi gla√ße that had us polishing the plates with the last of our bread.\\n\\nThere was a salad at this point, very Continental. It turns out that salad is apparently an aid to digestion, and eating it after the main protein course seems to make more sense that up front. I have no idea, but it does work well as a palate cleanser and refresher after the main course.\\n\\nThence to a selection of cheeses. I remember a blue, and Irish cheese, and a Manchego, with almonds and quince paste and figs. Is one supposed to clean an offering of cheese, down to the last bit of almond and quince? I have no idea what the protocol is, but we cleaned this one.\\n\\nThe dessert was a brown butter pecan tart with ice cream and caramel, all made in-house, of course. A great finish to the meal.\\n\\nReally cool touch: once the salad had been served, the chef/owner took a big pitcher of water and went out side, several trips, to water the flowers and trees out front. That's a small crew."},{"name":"Josie's Pizza","address":"952 W Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I have been going here for the last seventeen years and I love it.

Unfortunately, I was left underwhelmed.  The seating at Beast is communal and uncomfortable from the table to the chairs.  So for two hours, I sat there without being able to move and this in no way added to my overall dining experience.  I have also decided, after dining at numerous restaurants with communal seating, that when paying a higher price for food, I want the entire \\"dining\\" experience.  Thankfully, I enjoyed the couple seated next to me.  \\n\\nWhile there were some definite high points to the meal like the corn soup with its rich flavor, the fois gras bon bon and the flawlessly cooked scallops, the duck confit course was so overly salted that it required glass after glass of water to get through.  Even the cookie at the end was sprinkled with salt and was not what I would have wanted my last taste profile to be.  The reviewer before me (Pdx F.) did a great job of explaining all of the courses, so I'm not going to repeat what has already been written.  Although you can watch everything being plated, you're not given the opportunity to see the actual cooking.  Unfortunately, the one thing we saw the most of was the dishwasher washing an endless stream of plates.  \\n\\nMy understanding is that the wine pairings are in the $35 range.  Unfortunately, we did not opt for the pairings which in hindsight was a big mistake.  I like Rieslings and asked if they had any on the wine list without looking at the menu and its wine pairings.  I was told no, but that there was another white I would like.  After drinking about half of that glass, I noticed that a Dr. Loosen Riesling was offered on the menu as a wine pairing.  My dinner companion, as well as other diners, was offered a wine off of the dinner menu and I am not quite sure why I was not given this option as well since the bottle was already opened.  I asked about getting a glass of the Dr. Loosen (remember we were told earlier in the meal that they had no Rieslings) and after much deliberation on Beast's part, I was brought a glass of Dr. Loosen.  The surprising part was when the bill arrived and I was charged $18 for a glass that should have been a fraction of that price and should have been suggested in the first place.  In addition, my companion's wine (also offered as a wine pairing) was only $12. \\n\\nOverall, Beast just did not live up to the hype and does not warrant the $75 per person charge.  I really wanted to rave about the flavor profiles, the service, and the restaurant in general, but just cannot.  More importantly, I cannot recommend Beast as a must go to restaurant - it just wasn't special enough."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"We had dinner there, first time, on a cold January night.

The freshness of the fish here isn't terrible, but it's definitely not the best. Their nigiri sushi has too much rice, the rice to fish ratio is unbalanced.

I'll just hop on in and do that. Right.\\n\\nMy partner tried one more time Saturday morning, to see if we could get on the list without driving in. Shock. No one answered. \\n\\nThe host was pretty unpleasant when we arrived, the coffee was bad, so waiting wasn't great. Finally over an hour later, we were seated (one of our group couldn't even stay for food, due to the wait).\\n\\nWe got food. It was about the same caliber as Petite Provence, or any of the other good brunch places in town, but the service was hipster-better-than-thou, and the food comes out really fast, so the ridiculous wait doesn't seem worth it. Again, bad coffee. \\n\\nThings that could have happened:\\n\\n1) On the message or on your website, just say that you only do one reservation and it's early in the morning. Don't drag on the process. I could have found any number of other places that would have taken my reservation and this whole thing could have been avoided.\\n\\n2) Get a coffee brewing lesson for your staff. There is no excuse for bad coffee in Portland.\\n\\n3) When people order separately, assume they don't intend to do the shared plate thing, and put the correct food at least NEAR the person who asked for it.\\n\\n4) Get a new host, or give the one you have a lesson in civility.\\n\\nNow that I've typed this, I'm taking away a star, because it pissed me off all over again."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Came here twice during our weekend stay in Austin.

It's sad to me that this place has any good reviews, as Ohioans apparently don't really have much to choose from, as I've found out. Being from the northeast my expectations are much higher. To begin with this place is WAAAAY over priced. Not only for this area, but for any place that I've been. Fried rice for $8.50? Really? I made the mistake of ordering fried chicken livers (I know, not everyone's favorite, but it is mine). For $7.25, when livers are less than $2.00 a pound, I expected they would come maybe with a nice light tempura batter, or (as I've experienced) in a nice brown sauce with walnuts. Nope. They were in a pint box, with ... nothing. They were sort of a grayish brown and were badly overcooked. My first bite made me gag and I promptly threw them away in disgust. In fact, just about everything was overcooked. The beef teriyaki was like chewy leather, the fried wontons were slightly less hard than a rock would be, the chicken wings were dry and had very little taste, and the egg roll smelled bad and had a bit of a strange after taste. As for the shrimp fried rice, I'd hardly call what was in there shrimp. They were very small with virtually no taste, as the whole dish was basically bland and tasteless. Needless to say, I won't ever go back there again."},{"name":"Guac y Margys","address":"661 Auburn Ave NE, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We stopped by Guac y Margys on a weekday at 2pm for a late lunch.

I had the ceviche shrimp and the zucchini flower Both were a nice size (2x the size of bartaco). We also ordered three dips with chips (queso, bean dip, guac). The dip sizes are pretty small and pricey but you are really paying for location (aka beltline). The chips are really good here as they cover them in pepper. If its just you and another person, the 3 tacos and 3 dips for $28 is a nice way to sample Guac y Margys. \\n\\n**This place is also very dog friendly which is a plus."},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"I had the best experience ever today!

The single pancake was huge and fantastic.  It was dedicated one of the best I've had. The Turkey sausage is a patty which was nice. My friend's bacon & single fried egg looked great as well.

The meat on the ribs was fall-off-the-bone tender and perfectly lathered with the right amount of BBQ sauce. The half rack was plenty big for a filling dinner along with the corn bread and coleslaw.

My server also forgot some of the things I ordered.\\nIt was weird because by the time we were ordering, the restaurant was slowly dying down, so I'm not sure how the service didn't get better as our night went on. \\n- Rice to fish ratio was way off for nigiri. It was like 90% rice and 10% fish. But for the rolls the amount of rice wasn't as bad. \\n-For the Ikura (salmon roe) nigiri - they give you literally all rice, a small half of the nigiri is the ikura and the other half is a cucumber!!

Sweet potato fries were yummy- crisp and hot and who doesn't like bacon jalapeno cheese? It was a little movie nachoi cheese like- but in a gross sick fatty way I liked it. Everything else was downhill from there- filet mignon bruschetta came highly recommended but the filet was so well done and lacked any sort of sear- it literally could have been hunks of roast beef. Yuck. It also weirdly lacked flavor. Just warm rubbery beef. Bleech. We also split two sushi rolls- I wish I could remember their names- but the fish was a little fishy (cheap salmon likely) and just not that yummy.

Combine that with wonderfully attentive service and simple but elegant ambiance and you create what is quite possibly my new favorite seafood restaurant in Boston. I never heard of restauranteur Vincent Vela before but am impressed with what he has accomplished in a city that truly did not need another seafood establishment.  And he has done so with such attention to detail that it is no surprise that he beams with pride as he walks around his restaurant greeting every guest personally and insuring that each is enjoying the extraordinary dining experience that he has meticulously created.\\n\\nFrom the moment we arrived, and even before, it was evident that the goal here is to make each patron feel like a valued guest.  Graciously seated by a pleasant hostess we were brought up two flights of stairs to the dining room.  This lovely 60 seat venue was tastefully but simply decorated providing a wonderful ambience for the meal we were about to have.  I did notice the room to be a bit on the noisy side, yet I never had difficulty hearing my dinner companion. A waiter immediately greeted us, offering still or sparkling water, and taking our drink order.\\nThe drink offerings were only beer and wine and, for this evening, I wanted neither.  We perused the menu and selected the prix fixe 3 course option.  I chose the asparagus salad, seared  duck breast, and baba au rum dessert.  My wife selected the spring dug parsnip soup, the stuffed skate and the same dessert.  The salad was delicious but I must admit I had soup envy.  Delicious and an aesthetic delight with its brioche and caviar garnish, my taste buds practically thanked for the opportunity to enjoy the array of flavors that combined into one of the most delightful root vegetable soups I have ever enjoyed.  The main courses were no less pleasing, each expertly prepared and presented beautifully.  The skate was a standout easily assuming a prominent position among the best fish dishes I have ever eaten.  Wonderfully cooked and stuffed with an exquisite lobster preparation that complimented but did not overpower the  delicate skate.  And the dessert was, in a word, scrumptious.  I have never had baba au rhum this good.  While as a purist I craved whipped cream with it, I thoroughly enjoyed the flavorful pastry with its beautiful and tasty garnishes.\\nThe staff was gracious and attentive.  The owner, Vince, treated us like valued friends.  I will be back.  Often.

I wasn't a fan of the chocolate nibs, the texture was much like coffee grounds but the Almond Brittle on my 2nd scoop made up for it. The pieces were large and still tasted just as much like Brittle would if snacked on alone.

In particular, they have the best wings (not just BBQ wings, wings of any sort) and BBQ ribs I've ever had!!!\\n\\nUnfortunately, I was a bit conflicted by my first visit to the new TSS-Seaport location for a late weekday lunch.  Some things were good, some not so...\\n\\nTHE GOOD...\\n\\nWHAT IN CARNATION ($12): Rebel Yell bourbon, pineapple, lemon, grenadine, orange blossom\\n~The constantly changing cocktail list at SS is very good, and this was no exception.  Surprisingly, more citrus than pineapple flavor.  The TOUCH OF LOVE ($12) with Platinum vodka, Green Chartreuse, mint, lime, Peychauds was also good\\n\\nTHE BEST BAR WINGS: Agave & pit spices ($9 for 6)\\n~Incredible, as good as Kendall, just order them already!  Although, like everything at SS, on the sweet side, so if you don't like sweet BBQ, you may not be a fan.  They do have a hot version that is good, although I prefer the regular.  Also, the plating was a bit odd, all scrunched off to the side of the mini-cookie sheet, not very Instagrammable lol\\n\\n1ST PLACE RIBS (1/2 slab with one side for $23)\\n~Very good, although a tad on the dry side this time.  These are always very lean ribs, which I greatly prefer, but YMMV.  We had already filled up on a bunch of sides, so they very kindly substituted some of their totally addictive Butter Cake Crack (the crunchy, sweet edges of their Kenny's Butter Cake) for us instead\\n\\nTHE NOT SO GOOD...\\n\\nSMOKE SHOP SHOWCASE ($35): Three whiskeys from one of our favorite whiskey houses. Limited availability\\n~OK, SS-Seaport has an incredible 207 different whiskeys, almost entirely American (I'm not sure if the original location even has this many), and several different flights to select from.  My fellow Yelpie Sasha ordered the so-called Showcase flight.  What came out were 3 different WhistlePig's bourbons, FarmStock, 10 year and 12 year \\"Old World\\", all fantastic.  The only problem was that her menu had listed a Showcase flight of 3 entirely different whiskeys costing only $16.  I'm sure it was a problem with the menus and not a bait & switch to the $35 selection she was given.  I mentioned this to the bartender, but didn't make an issue of it and we were charged the full $35.  Actually, this wasn't the only problem with the menus, which also had all the daily specials crossed out, when in fact they were still available\\n\\nPRIME BRISKET SANDWICH ($13 with 1 side)\\n~I've had this at the Kendall location and it was very succulent.  Here, it was decidedly dry, with no noticeable fat content.  Even saturating it with their tasty Hot BBQ sauce didn't fix it.  One of my friends also had a Brisket Plate with the same problem.  Admittedly, BBQ meats are not easy to do well in an all-day restaurant, but they definitely need better QC and should have 86'ed this.  The side of Brussel Sprouts with caramelized red onion was good\\n\\nPULLED PORK PLATE ($19 with 2 sides)\\n~My friend ordered this and I didn't actually try it.  Although I love pulled pork, I'm just not a fan of SS's, too dry, so I've given up ordering it.  Sounds like this was the same and not to the taste of the North/South Carolina girl who ordered it.  She also thought their collard greens were too sweet, but that is to be expected here (I love them)\\n\\nI'm sure this is going to be a popular lunch spot for people who work in Seaport.  The space is reminiscent of Kendall Square, but less interesting, being essentially a big square space.  Approximately the same number of seats, although the bar is shorter.  Half a dozen TVs, so probably a good place to watch a game.\\n\\nI'll go again when in the neighborhood, but I think they more work to match the excellence of the Kendall Square location."},{"name":"Ginza Sushi","address":"2850 Oxford Street","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favourite spots in the Tri cities.

While I ordered the rice noodles, my friend ordered the Green Curry (chicken, bamboo, bell peppers topped with fresh Thai basil and rice). \\n\\nWhen our food arrived, the spicy and tangy aroma filled my nostrils and increased my hunger. When I took a bite of my rice noodles, I expected it to be very spicy but because my coworker said that \\"medium\\" is equivalent to no spice, my food was just perfect (as I can't eat too spicy foods; I'd get an upset stomach). Part of the spicy aroma was from my friend's green curry...she told me hers was really spicy even for someone who eats a lot of spicy food. I liked how my food was hot (temperature-wise) because I've been to other Thai places and when their food came out, it's semi-warm.

We walked in and were told by an employee at the counter that the restaurant is downstairs (on this level is the bakery).

Order the following:\\n\\nLarge Pretzel, $4.50 prior to tax & Small Beer Cheese, $2.50 prior to tax- Thought this was a good appetizer and snack to have. The pretzel is a good size to share with a 2nd person and doesn't come with anything, so we ordered the beer cheese. I thought the beer cheese was just okay. This pretzel was fine but I have had better, especially with the cheese. \\n\\nMuffuletta Lunch Special, $12 prior to tax with cucumber & tomato salad as side- This sandwich has a good amount of lunch meat in it. But I do want to mention that the olive tapenade spread is spicy. I am not a spicy eater so I didn't like this as much. This lunch special comes with a beverage but you can add a beer from a selected list for an additional $3. This lunch special also comes with a side, in which I opted for the cucumber and tomato salad. I liked the side but thought it was a little heavy on the vinegar dressing. \\n\\nSt. Elmo Carl, $3 prior to tax- My husband ordered this beer and liked it.\\n\\nChai Tea, $4.25 prior to tax- I opted for a hot drink for this cold afternoon. My drink never came and we were done with our meal. I asked the server about it and she said that it takes time to have it made but will check up on it. I suspect that my drink was never made and the employee put in my order. Eventually it came but I really just wanted to have it taken off my bill instead since we were ready to leave. But I ended up just asking if I could have it taken to go. I was disappointed that my drink was so small and wasn't even filled up all the way in my to go cup. The chai tea was good but not worth the price and the wait.\\n-------------------------\\n(Total= $28.42 after tax, prior to tip)\\n\\nService throughout was lacking. There were 3 employees walking around trying to serve the groups of people outside and did not really check up on us during our meal.

After a few failed attempts to get an employee's attention the first time, I just went up to the bar and got the silverware myself. \\n\\nI had to remind an employee of our beer cheese, which was not served with our pretzel.

And frankly, the efficiency of both our server and the kitchen made it so that we were served lightning fast and with absolutely no loss in quality, so I have to attribute the \\"2 hour waits\\" to the obvious popularity of the place. The tables turned just fast enough to keep up with the influx, and the meals just kept coming.     \\n\\nYES, this is simple, honest, flavorful food, like Nonna used to make---you want frou-frou, go to Boston and pay 3x as much, capisce? The slow roasted bones and mirepoix for the veal stock in the Rino's Special added a rich, soul-satisfying depth.  The Lobster Ravioli were perhaps the best use of those (2!) crustacians I've ever had, and something as routine as Chicken Parmigiana, crisp, huge (3 meals of leftovers frozen) was equally carefully prepared. Fresh pasta all around (an upcharge---but WELL worth it---al dente and substantial) just elevated the whole dinner.  An appetizer of asparagus delicately wrapped in prosciuto, spinkled with ricotta salata, and dressed simply with Balsamico was just the right starter to the heavier pastas.  I only wish I had the opportunity to thank Tony---all of his kitchen staff just rocked it out impeccably.

We did have a few issues that made our stay less than 5/5, but they were not persistent. \\n\\nA few things to note for first-time visitors -\\n1) At this time (6/2018), the Champions Gate area has many options for dining (Red Robin, Panera, McDonald's), necessity shopping (Publix groceries, Walgreens pharmacy), gas, and coffee (Dunkin Donuts - there is a Starbucks in a Target about 10-15 minutes away). \\n2) Keep your key card handy. For reasons unknown, the gate control is not located immediately before the gate. You'll need your key card to pass through the gate.\\n3) Bring pool gear! There is a great zero-entry area to the main pool. There is also a gated kids' wading pool and a hot tub/spa. There is also a bar outside the pool area, but we did not partake. \\n4) The patio/balcony is fully screened, which is great for kids.\\n5) There is a children's playground located far from most of the buildings. We never visited, but it exists.\\n6) If you aren't from Florida, enjoy the wildlife - lizards and frogs are frequently spotted! \\n\\nSupplies you'll need -\\n1) round coffee filters for coffeemaker \\n2) laundry detergent and dryer sheets for in-condo washer/dryer\\n3) THERE IS NO CLOTHESLINE. Bring your own if you have anything to hang-dry, like swim gear. Be aware that things may not dry fully in the Florida humidity.\\n\\nThe biggest frustrations of our stay were our key cards not unlocking our doors on occasion (which meant a visit to the front office), the cleaning service wanting to clean prior to our check-out time, and the building being power-washed/textured/painted while we were there. The floors were covered with underlayment, plastic was draped and taped everywhere, and constantly bumping into the workers (unsure if they were an outside company or  property maintenance) took away from the vacation feel. If it had been the last day or two, it would have been more understandable (as soon as we vacated, they would work), but this was about midway though our visit and continued through our departure. We were not told at any time prior to booking or arrival, or until we saw signs posted and plastic/underlayment being taped, that significant maintenance was about to occur. \\n\\nHope the next visitors enjoy their freshly-maintained building!"},{"name":"BARbacoa","address":"2036 North High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Solid 3-star place.

Thigh meat is juicy and tender. I got a Nashville style thigh, and boy, it was really hot and smoky -- probably from the cayenne. \\n\\nI have yet to try any of their sides, but I'm really bummed that I have to walk around the corner for fries.

First off, we had one of the best tables in the restaurant with a lazy Susan, which made it very fun. Really liked my (2) new fashioned cocktails. We started with the bacon wrapped dates, shishito peppers, and Brussel sprouts. The dates were savory and sweet, served with a delicious pepper sauce. Also loved the shishito pepper preparation, and the lemony aioli added a nice compliment to the charred flavor. The Brussel sprouts were definitely my favorite. They were sweet from the golden raisins, and super crispy. We also had the burrata, but it wasn't my favorite. However I did like the addition of the roasted red peppers. We then had the special pork and beans, which was very good. It tasted so delicious with the fried egg on top. We also had the pad Thai, which had a great sauce but was a hard one to share. I liked how crunchy the noodles are, and the addition of the spiralized noodles.

I have been a regular patron of Jaho Coffee Roaster & Wine Bar for well over three years now. I was and am ecstatic when they opened the new location at 116 Huntington Avenue in the Back Bay. The interior is gorgeous and boasts an assortment of extensive and highly comfortable seating, outlets, free WiFi, warm colors, an espresso bar, awesome background music, food that is cooked from scratch and made-in-house, a dessert casing, a pristine bar with coffee and beer on tap and two high-definition plasma screen televisions that always have a sporting event playing, a lounge containing very comfortable seating and a massive, high-definition plasma screen television that is mounted over a huge fireplace, and much more. When I walked in for the first time a week after it opened, I felt like I was walking into a young professional's paradise. I am not over-exaggerating. \\n\\nBeing a categorical young professional, I study, do work, plan/organize, brainstorm, meet with friends and colleagues, and relax at this Jaho location. Countless other patrons do exactly the same. You will feel like you are lounging about in your own living room. It just has one of those ambiences and atmospheres that makes you breathe and want to come back again, again, and again. It is extravagant, and yet the patronage is so massive that the prices of coffee, food, pastries, and wine are all kept within reason and are of (extremely) high quality. Perhaps with the bias of nostalgia, I exclaim with a zenith of confidence that this is the most magnificent coffee shop in the City of Boston, and this is largely attributed to the phenomenal, dedicated management and his distinct ability to recruit and retain excellent staff. \\n\\nThe owner/manager's attributes range from being unequivocally enthusiastic, humbled, dedicated, and community-oriented to being outwardly genuine, respectful, personable, accepting of critique and feedback, and a bona fide coffee and wine guru. Want to talk sports? He's your guy. Want to talk business? He's also your guy. His creativity is nothing short of brilliant. He constantly strives to make it the best \\"let's hangout and sip on some real coffee, tea, wine, or beer\\" shop in town, From my observations and those of countless other patrons, he actually seeks positive/negative feedback on a regular basis, which is likely why Jaho has attracted a multitude of monumental successes. He carries a high degree of cultural and communicational competence. Although I do not know the owner/manager on a personal basis, I perceive him as one of those people that you will meet and feel like you have known for years. I feel the same about his staff members. \\n\\nAccordingly, I am notably surprised over the preceding negativity in the review written on November 2nd, 2018 (and by the way, it's common knowledge that it is illegal to photograph an individual without his/her consent and especially on a negative basis, so you will be incredibly fortunate if you do not get slapped in the face with a libel lawsuit). A friend of mine witnessed this particular patron's outburst, and described it as being similar to a child's temper tantrum. Thus, I would argue that his review is as defamatory as it is unreliable.

This place is for real!\\n\\nOne typical rainy Portland morning my friend, his son, and I decided we wanted to try something other than the \\"normal\\" breakfast fare of bacon, eggs, pancakes, hash, etc. So, we drove to North Portland to eat at Tasty n Sons. This place has been getting rave reviews not only from yelp, but from many other publications. The Willamette Weekly named Tasty n Sons the \\"Restaurant of the Year\\" so it was definitely a must-try. \\n\\nFirst off I noticed that this place was quite large. You wouldn't think so from the outside but there were quite a few tables in the place, all packed of course. We decided to sit at the community table which had probably 12 seats and a super long table. The staff was very friendly and very attentive to our needs. Our server was very knowledgeable with their complex menu. What really stood out was the variety of dishes they served up and it was actually pretty difficult to choose a few items because they all sounded either good or interesting. Some sounding good in a strange way. Bacon wrapped dates? Hmm...\\n\\nAll the dishes come out from the kitchen staggered so it's great for sharing family style. With us being from Hawaii, it's something we're comfortable with and used to. We opted for the Pork Cutlets which are lightly breaded and come over a bed of spinach and an over-easy egg draped over the top. The pork was so tender that my fork cut through it like butter. The Morocan Hash Chicken was another dish that tasted great! Shredded chicken mixed with hash with a spicy cr√®me fra√Æche and over-easy eggs. Yum. And the darkhorse of this restaurant was probably the Potatoes Bravas with over easy eggs. These potatoes were cooked like traditional homestyle fries with a perfect outside crispiness while keeping the inside moist. It was sauteed with a spicy garlicky, paprika~y, onion and tomato sauce that had a hint of citrus. Yummy!\\n\\nWhen I read reviews of great eats I usually end up disappointed.

Our waitress had wrapped the crabcakes to go and I simply handed them back to her and said I've only taken one bite, please give these back to Jerrod and tell him that we would like to have our money back. She came back downstairs about 4 or 5 minutes later, as her manager had been somewhere upstairs, and she did take the cost of the crab cakes off our bill.

I love to say to the owner, \\"I see you cater too? That's awesome.

Low and behold we didn't like the wine, but to our dismay, we weren't offered an alternative. In fact he disappeared. After telling us that he would be right back to take our food order, he disappeared leaving the cook to tend to the tables. After ten minutes or so, as the cook was delivering wine to another table, we flagged him down hoping to order some food. He said that he was busy and our server had gone down the street to get a burrito, and he would be back soon. WHATTT???? 8 o'clock on a Friday night? Your only server leaves the bar to get burrito from another restaurant?!!??!? I guess we'll wait. We had considered just walking out. I haven't been treated so badly since I moved to Portland. I haven't considered walking out before but we were pretty close. After asking for the check, twice, our server blatantly over charged us; by a dollar.

However the cook was polite and seemed concerned. \\n\\nThe way the restaurant is set up is quite confusing when you enter especially when it's crowded. People are all gathered at the entrance and you would assume that's where you'd place your order but no. I was completely disoriented and both cashiers who could visibly see my confusion didn't even welcome me nor tell me where you place your order. After wondering, I figured out that apparently you just have to shout it over the glass to the cooks. The gentleman cook was nice and patiently helped me out with my order, as a first timer here. \\n\\nThen you kinda of just have to slide on down to the cashier to pay. Those two women were total bitches! The sign says they offer student discounts. I guess they changed their mind once it was time for me to pay!

The thought of choosing a mediocre meal, schlepping it back to work, and being entirely underwhelmed by my lunch paralyzes me with indecision.  And then I realize it's just lunch; I should get over myself and my drama, pick something and come back another day if I don't like what I choose. Paralyzed?  Really, Danni?\\n\\nI opted for #1 Bento for a couple of reasons - in part, based on friends' reviews on Yelp, but admittedly in part based on the ability to walk right up to the window on this particular afternoon.  The verdict?  Decidedly not bad.  Better than not bad.  I would definitely come here again.\\n\\nIn a classic \\"Really, Danni?\\" move, I went with teriyaki chicken despite other, more \\"authentic,\\" Korean options.  I was not at all disappointed.  This chicken had a lot to live up to given that I had to walk it 18 blocks before consuming it.  It was dressed with lots of sweet teriyaki sauce which had soaked nicely into the bed of rice below.  By \\"bed\\" understand we're talking California King sized bed of rice.  The chunks of iceberg lettuce in the side salad were nicely dressed with a creamy dressing.  I particularly liked the other little salad - apparently called chap chae.  The glass noodles were dressed with a sesame oil-based sauce.  I could eat lots of that.

Very good Dave & Busters"},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"First things first; I'm a guilt ridden carnivore. I believe deep down that meat really is murder and you can't deny the environmental impact that eating meat has on our planet.  Alas, other than a brief stint as a herbivore in my early 20‚Ä≤s I have never been able to commit to a full life of no meat.  One day perhaps I will have the determination and fortitude and much needed cooking skills; but until then I try to make any meat eating event a good one, lest these poor quadrupeds die in vain of a tasteless dish. It was with high expectations that I ventured to Pig Floyd's, the newest restaurant to enter the Mills/50 district.  Some foodie friends had gone to the media preview and had only palate-pleasing praise.\\n\\nWe arrived around 6 PM on their opening day, and the restaurant was half full, with both indoor and outdoor seating, but there was a decent line forming to order. It's set up as what would appear to be a fast causal establishment, with your order taken at the counter, a number distributed, and you grab a seat and wait.\\nI knew from the first few minutes in line, this was not going to be a seamless experience since only one register was ringing, and I could see the panicked faces of the workers who were completely exposed in this beautiful open kitchen. The POS system was giving them problems so each order was taking time getting put in. You know it's bad when there are I.T. professionals milling about.\\n\\nWe ordered the pulled pork platter and the the pork belly tacos and began our wait.  The restaurant started to fill with the line forming out the door and as we waited and critiqued the design and the usage of the small space as only non-restaurant owning people can. The contained chaos continued, but it wasn't until I noticed a man that had been sitting at the bar from the moment we walked in get his food that I knew this might take even longer than previously thought.  He had been there for at least 20 minutes since we had walked in and was just NOW getting served.  That's when I knew, either those pigs were being slaughtered freshly off of Virginia Drive, or their kitchen was really backed up.\\n\\nForty minutes passed when the kitchen realized our order never actually made it to the line, and when it finally came out it was not complete.  As irritating as it was, I couldn't really be mad. Once you've worked in a restaurant you have an everlasting empathy for situations that are out of your hands.  POS issues on any day can throw everything out of whack, but on your opening day, that's a really kick in the snout. This is what smart phones were invented for right?  Time to surf the web and tell each other work stories.  The wait staff was very apologetic and accommodating, which was appreciated since in times of distress it's easy to have staff become irritated and apathetic and none of them displayed any of these traits. Our food arrived and the worry about the wait went out the window.  My pork belly tacos were packed with flavor. It was topped with asian Dragon Sauce, Citrus Peanut Slaw and accompanied with a side of grilled corn on the cob with chili, lime, and Cotija Cheese.  Tacos are purchased singularly and two was the perfect amount. All I can say is Tako Cheena better watch out, because these tacos were amazingly good with an excellent price point to sweeten the deal.\\n\\nMy companion had the pulled pork platter with the same side of corn and fresh grilled veggies. Another dish packed with flavor that didn't even need sauce. They spared no plate space with the a heaping portion of meat.\\n\\nWe split one dessert, the Black & Tan which was like a brownie mixed with pudding and whip cream in what else, but the all too popular mason jar. Dark chocolate brown bites, chocolate chip cookie chunks and cookies & cream pudding.  It was rich and smooth and the perfect sweet cap to the meal.\\n\\nKinks are to be expected on an opening day, and despite the chaos, the food quality apparently didn't suffer, which means the kitchen has their act together and can keep quality consistent even when under pressure. After talking briefly with a delightful girl at the table next to me, she raved about her ribs, saying that Four Rivers had nothing on them.  Smiling faces were all around when I scanned the tables, which considering these people had been waiting as long as I had speaks volumes.  I will surely be back and hope for shorter ticket times.

Pork cheek, if you've never had it before, is superbly lean yet tender... something that you don't normally see in pork. There was an ample amount of meat in this dish and all of the collagen and connective tissue dissolved to produce a melt-in-your-mouth experience.\\n\\nOur next dish was the Pineapple Fried Rice ($12.50) which we ordered to go along with our Panang Chicken Curry ($12.25). The fried rice, shaped into a dome, was topped with Chinese sausage (which I liked the best), and contained chicken, pineapple, raisins, and cashews with a dash of curry power.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the curry included green peas and sliced bell peppers in the rich coconut milk. Definitely the kind of dish that you want to soak up the sauce.\\n\\nLast up, the Pad Thai ($11.25) with chicken, sliced tofu, ground peanuts, bean sprouts, spring onions, and egg... as if we didn't have enough carbs \\nI actually thought that the food here was pretty solid and a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."},{"name":"Whiskey Dicks","address":"50 E Central Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I go there once or twice a week for lunch.

It is dark enough that it was sort of challenging to read the menu, but they are going for the 'candlelight' atmosphere, I think.\\n\\nThe overall vibe is 'old-school Italian' (at least to me; if you are of Italian descent, YMMV).  At least for Atlanta, this place reminded me of other favorite Italian places which are now defunct.  I liked it.  The waiters are very professional.  There were several tables of what appeared to be older sets of couples who were 'regulars' (based on their interaction with the staff) as well as a couple of larger parties.  There is a bar area also.\\n\\nThe menu was interesting and we both found good dishes.  I think mine was a stuffed ravioli and was good.  I liked the salad and the wine selection too.  Prices are a bit high, but this is more along the lines of a fine dining place.  I didn't think it was unreasonable for the overall experience.  \\n\\nI think we'll be back; I'm glad this place is still around!"},{"name":"Quaintrelle","address":"3936 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"LOVED our dinner here a few nights ago!!

We came in from out of town with a group of 8 and arrived to the location at 8:40pm. We talked to the hostess and she said between 30-45 minutes, our group had no problem with waiting, since it was a Saturday night that didn't seem too bad. After an hour we noticed that it had really started to clear out and we still did not have a table nor had anyone come up to us to say it was going to be longer. I went back up to the host stand and talked to a man who said he would check on our table. When he walked away he went to an EMPTY table and picked up a tray with glasses on it. He came back to the stand and didn't say anything to us to let us know it was ready just started cleaning menus and talking to coworkers. After another 10 minutes of wondering, I went back up to him and ask what he found out he then said \\"oh right\\" got our menus and led us to a table. \\n\\nAfter waiting for over an hour the last thing you want is to get to the table and have an ongoing bad experience--unfortunately that's exactly what happened. Our server came over and seemed nice and ordered our drinks right away and said bread and butter would be out soon. Most of us ordered just water with the exception of 3 bar drinks, at this time one of the guys in our party ordered a slice of cheesecake. Took at least 30 minutes for the waters to come out and then another 10 for the bar drinks. Still no sign of the cheesecake OR the bread & butter after those 40 minutes. When we questioned the server about the cheesecake she made an excuse on how busy they were with Togo orders even though it had quieted done immensely in the restaurant since it was now almost 11pm. We asked to speak to a manager and she asked why so we explained. She then came back 2 minutes later with the cheesecake and said she had just gone and did it herself, which we appreciated though why couldn't that have been done earlier? Bread came out next with a promise that food should be out shortly, and it did. One of the guys in our party had ordered plain angel hair pasta with just butter and told the server nothing else just butter after the server looked at him like he was crazy for ordering that. When his plate came out the server held it slanted to show him and asked if it was okay the way it was and the kitchen had made it with just a little bit of tomato on it... the entire pasta was covered in raw tomatoes. How does plain translate to tomatoes? No clue. Regardless, she took it back...at this point my fianc√© finally has had enough to get up and find the manager since the server never sent him over to us after we asked. He found the manager and explained what happened from the time we came up until that point. My fianc√© came and sat down as the rest of the food was coming out. The food was set in front of us quite hastily, I assume the server saw someone in our party speak to the manager. The manager came over to our whole table to ask how things were and to see if we had any appetizers, we answered with a no but one of the guys in our group got cheesecake. The manager nodded his head blowing it off and said he talked to the hosts upfront and had a \\"teaching moment\\" with them. He left and we all ate. The food was good like it usually is so no complaints there and the only reason why this gets a one star rating. The next time we saw our server she was at the table next to us chatting with them which is great but she never even tried to have a conversation with our group.\\n\\nWhen it was time for the check to come it was a long process to even receive the check and even longer one to get the cards back. Our whole party was frustrated and tired of being at the restaurant. It was now almost midnight and someone else in our group went to find the manager because after everything that had happened we were not happy how the situations were handled. He explained to the manager that it wasn't right what had happened and how we weren't happy. The manager just said sorry and reluctantly offered to buy us a couple cheesecake slices after we had said something should be done and changed on the bill. No one was even going to order cheesecake so we left irritated that nothing was done to handle the problem. Two of the people in our party did end up getting cheesecake but they ended up paying for it so the manager ended up literally doing nothing for us. \\n\\nAll of these issues could have been resolved if the hosts,server and manager had communicated effectively with each other and us. I can understand a wait and something coming out wrong but what I don't understand is the lack of genuine apologetic concern. We've all worked in the service industry so we get it. This could have been avoided or at least handled better by the supervisor.

And that's exactly how they model and brew their beer, in the traditional farmhouse style. This means local water, local yeast (mostly), and as much time as the beer needs. This also means that Jester King is a brewery unafraid to make \\"unpopular\\" styles of beer. If you are timid of palette, stay away.\\n\\nOur brewmaster/tour leader summed it up nicely: \\"We brew unconventional beer for people who share our taste. The implication being that most people don't share our taste in beer.\\" Not only is this a siren song to beer snobs everywhere, it's also their polite way of saying \\"If you don't like our beer, feel free to piss right off.\\"\\n\\nGo in with an open mind, and an open wallet,  'cause craft brewing ain't cheap. \\nProtip: Go with several good friends and share 8oz beers. A sip or two will let you know whether it's a beer you can commit to, and you'll be able to spread the cost around. \\n\\nUnlike the other reviewers, the long lines were conspicuously absent for our mid November trip (it was sunny and 80 degrees...if this is global warming, sign me up!). Everyone was polite, the beer flowed freely, dogs and children milled about untethered. All in all, a gorgeous day.\\n\\nOur brew tour felt like a master class in brewing. I personally know almost nothing about the process of creating beer, though I feel like I could fumble my way through now. I recommend taking the tour before you imbibe, there's a lot of info to take in, and several folks in the tour dropped out after their eyes glazed over. \\n\\nIn order, I liked the Atrial Rubicite (which is apparently a hot commody in beer enthusiast circles), Boxer's Revenge, and Das Wunderkind. Again, the beer flavor profiles here are off the beaten path, so you'll really have to try everything for yourself. The most impressive part?

The food WAY surpassed my expectations!! Everything on the menu looked so delicious, it was hard to choose my entree. I started off with the Firecracker Chicken Wontons. The wontons themselves are very tasty and seems to be their specialty. The pricing is great to -2 for $1.99. You can also buy orders of 4 and 6. The Firecracker Wontons were ok. They were good, but nothing out of the ordinary that I would order again. I will definitely try the Crab Wontons next time. WAK has a Chipolte feel in the manner that you pick your protein and then pick the style you want it cooked. I picked Korean Sticky Chicken. It was SO GOOD!! The sauce was amazing, thick, and flavorful- yum!! The price point wasn't bad either at $8.75, plus you get your choice or white or brown rice. I chose the brown rice which was blah as could be, but the protein definitely made up for it. My sister ordered Bulgogi Chicken and paid a $1.00 extra for Fried Rice. I DEFINITELY recommend doing this! The fried rice was extremely appetizing. It was packed with veggies and flavor. I also tried her Bulgogi which was enjoyable as well. Then we got Banana Foster Wontons that were also delightful. Their wontons are light and crispy and had a banana in them and were served with a creamy caramel drizzle. The food here was way better than I anticipated and I'm so glad we stopped in for lunch! Everything tasted very fresh and the quality was superb for a smaller Asian restaurant. \\n   The restaurant has a contemporary look inside with complimentary decor. The cashier was friendly and very helpful in assisting us with our order being that we've never dined there before. They have an open kitchen layout so that you can partially see in. All of the chefs were cooking efficiently and all the food they were putting up on the counter looked terrific.\\n   I am so glad WAK opened up and already can't wait to go back and try some other items! The Sweet Chili Teriyaki is next on my list. If you're in the area, you should definitely stop in and sample some yumminess!\\n\\n**UPDATE** WAK was so good, I've already returned! This time I tried the Sweet Chili Teriyaki Chicken. The presentation was great and again was very tasty! Didn't taste too much sweet chili, mostly teriyaki, but it was still super! My friend got the Pad Thai and it was also delicious!\\n\\nBeing that I've come back to WAK twice more since my update, I had to alter them from 4 starts to 5!! Everyone I've brought to WAK LOVES it just as much as me! Today I tried something totally different. This time I went for the Bahn Mi Sandwich. The flavors once again were off the charts! The bun wasn't my favorite, a little on the harder side, but it was drizzled in a garlic butter vinaigrette which was a nice touch. The pickled veggies served on it were done well also. We did got the apple wontons for dessert and I liked them better than the banana myself, but both are delectable. I will also mention that I just went here yesterday as well and took my niece. They might start knowing me by first name. Their heightened flavors are so tasty and there so many options to try, I'm sure I'll be back soon again! It helps that they only 10 minutes from my house.
