We initially gave the benefit of the doubt to the 1st female staff member who took our order, chalking it up as \\"she may be having a rough day\\" when she rudely responded loudly with some grumpy look to our inquiries of a couple of menu items. But then we found out the other staff members also demonstrated the same demeanor by either giving us death stares or not even looking or acknowledging our simplest requests such as asking for a pair of chopsticks, removing a couple of empty containers when they came to bring out our foods, they just simply ignored and pretended to not even hear us as they continue to walk right past our table, not wanting to be bothered with. Of all the places we ate in Boston, this was the only restaurant that charged us for the tea  brought on our table even though we did not order it. They never bothered to come by our table one time to check up on us or refill our water.  From their demeanor, we were frankly scared to ask of anything else from them the entire time.  They somehow expected a tip through all this!  Their dim sum foods were not outstanding but decent, however with this type of poor service from their entire staff we encountered, not sure how this business will last in the long run(?) If minimum customer service is expected, then you are coming to a wrong restaurant in our opinion. We have never short changed anyone on tips except this one instance as a way of \\"constructive criticism\\" but this one last impression we want to point out, upon seeing our minimal tip left on the table, one of the waiter there (with a left earring) had the nerve when he bolted out the front door, asking us for more tip, we told him that was for poor service and he responded with the \\"F----\\" response.

The salesman told me these were all USDA good quality steaks and let me tell you, this is not even close. The meat was very tough by itself and had a lot of gristle. For the price I paid for 4 boxes I would say go ahead and save your money. HEB is right down the street and you can get a way better quality steak than these frozen hokey pucks.

This is a standard practice if a place is really proud of their craft. We had to get our own sauce from another table. The water offered no pleasantries, as well as those who brought the food to the table. Just dropped the food and left. \\n\\nAfter we had our food for about 15 min the water came by to ask if everything was good. The fried green tomatoes were not prepared southern style at all. They were so thinly sliced that there was a faint taste of tomato. Then they were breaded with a crunchy breading and deep fried, not like authentic southern ones.  $9 is steep for a scant amount of tomatoes and lots of breading. They had a paprika spicy sauce which doesn't marry well with green tomatoes in my opinion. \\n\\nI ordered the burnt ends sandwich which was good but not like the burnt ends like we do it in the south. It is far more crunchier. The collard greens were not traditional but, I make my greens like these which are firm. They were very tasty.

However, I didn't want to be a wet blanket, so when people wanted to go here, I wanted to make the best of it.\\n\\nLocated in SE Portland, which is a bit of a drive from our part of the PDX Metro area, Toast has a cute ambiance.

At a cost of $75/person, plus gratuity, this was a special meal where we expected great things. The serving staff and bartender made good, but the chef's food missed the mark.\\n\\nNew Year's Eve 2017/2018 was a cold, blustery, snowy evening, which was weird for Texas. Regardless, we were excited and looking forward to fun and new beginnings. From all accounts, Swift's Attic seemed to be the perfect place to celebrate. We arrived nearly half an hour earlier than our reservation. The friendly and accommodating hostess politely smiled and said that they would have the table ready in a few minutes. Excellent! We were seated in about 10 minutes, turned over to our server, and brought water and menus to pick our four course meal. For my four courses I chose pozole verde soup, something somewhat similar to a  tuna tartare, olive oil salmon, and toffee sticky pudding.\\n\\nThe pozole verde was good. Spicy, savory, and flavorful, this dish was perfect for a cold evening and thoroughly enjoyable. The second course seemed to be kind of similar to a tuna tartare... kind of hard to describe. Basically, the dish was comprised of small chunks of raw tuna with perhaps a mix of grains in a light soy sauce. I did not like this dish at all and skipped it after a couple of bites. Some chunks of tuna were tough and something in the mix of grains crunched like weird Grape-Nuts. The strange texture was a complete turn off.\\n\\nThe third course was salmon so gently poached in olive oil that it seemed to be cooked sous vide. The fish rested on a bed of sauteed vegetables and mashed potatoes. While well-executed, this dish lacked flavors other than salmon. Too bad that the beautiful piece of fish had to carry the dish on its own. The fourth and final course was the dessert: toffee sticky pudding. Once again, the dish was done well, but lacked depth. I think that a warm creme anglaise lightly drizzled with fresh caramel would have really added the oomph that it was missing.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I don't remember my wife's meal, so I won't comment much on it. I can report that my wife had much the same feelings about her food that I did mine... either the dishes didn't work and came off as strange or they lacked flavors and were one-dimensional.\\n\\nWhile the only drink that I had was the complimentary champagne, which was given to customers to toast the New Year at midnight, my wife quaffed her Strawberry Fields ice ball cocktail. From what I have heard from friends, the ice ball cocktails are proven winners.\\n\\nAgain, we had great service and my wife had a good cocktail. Unfortunately, most of the food was conceptually sound and well executed, but lacked the kind of delicate flavors that would make it memorable dining experience.

The pork in black bean sauce does not have the black bean sauce flavor at all, and rather it is covered in either sesame or cooking oil. The greens are good, but that is hard to mess up.

Located on the edge of a strip mall on an exceedingly suburban corner in north Decatur, this is the kind of spot that you go to for a solid, stodgy meal in a relaxed, no-frills environment that isn't trying to be cool. We stopped in on a Friday night after a busy, frazzled  week, and we were immediately relaxed by the unpretentious vibes of this neighborhood hangout. We came in December, and were charmed by the colorful Christmas lights that added an extra glow to the already cozy atmosphere. We started with a couple of beers from their surprisingly extensive beer list, and then ordered snacks. We chose the vegetable starter, which was blanched broccoli, cauliflower and carrots served with a decadent onion dip, the cheese puff basket, and the chile relleno bites, a seasonal menu item. The relleno bites were good- tempura fried, with plenty of creamy cheese and chopped poblano. I should say that the name was a bit misleading. I'm a Texas pepperhead that grew up eating chile rellenos, so I can't say that they lived up to what I was expecting. However, once I managed they expectations, they were a good replication. On the other hand, the cheese puffs were incredible, similar to a crumbly miniature cheese biscuit, served with a tangy marinara. They were a must-have, and by far the stand out of the meal. All in all, Melton's is a solid choice for simple, no-frills food and beer when in suburban Decatur.

And, if it's drinks you're after, the bar does offer a prodigious array of beer on tap (while at a constant $6 a pint, seems high for a place way out in the low-rent countryside), and a number of specialty cocktails.\\n\\nBut, it was the food that offered the big disappointment.  It began as we were perusing the wall-mounted menu (order at the counter only).  A surprisingly small variety of offerings, leaning toward a number of \\"specialty burgers\\".  Every item comes ONLY with tater tots, no standard french fries to be had, either as substitution or as an additional side. Really?  Did we wander into a Sonic by mistake?\\n\\nStrangely, a separate sign proclaimed \\"Happy Hour Special..Wings and french fries\\" (if $10 is the happy hour price, I wonder what the regular price would be).  When my wife asked if she could have the french fries (offered with the wings) in place of \\"tots\\" with a burger, the only response from the other side of the counter was.. \\"no, sorry, management decision\\".\\n\\nThere being so few items on the menu, my wife opted for the wings, mainly because she had her taste buds set on french fries, not Costco 'tots'.  That turned out to be a mistake, as the fries had clearly been languishing in the kitchen for some time, if not hours, since their trip to the fryer.  Yep, limp and soggy.  The wings?  Not much better, offering a less-than-appealing visual presentation, which matched the actual taste and texture.\\n\\nfor myself, after mentally rejecting most of the offerings on the wall menu, I settled on an order of Frito Pie (bowl of chili on top of some Frito's), and a side of hush puppies ($6 for THREE).\\n\\nWhen my chili arrived, I took one bite and found it to be literally at, or below room temperature.  It was almost as though my bowl had been sitting in the refrigerator, and then nuked in the microwave, but the \\"cook\\" dialed in the wrong setting.  To add insult to injury, the 3 forlorn hush puppies (yes, at $2 a pop), were almost black, eliciting negative comments from the rest of the table before I even took a bite.  Again, I can only assume these things were fried some time ago, then warmed up in the microwave.  They were as rubbery as tennis balls, and about as tasty.  To give faint credit, when I took the chili back to the counter to complain about the temperature, the clerk there promised to have them \\"make me a new bowl\\", and, in fact, the second attempt did arrive at an acceptable temperature.\\n\\nOne of the other ladies at the table opted for the 3 piece Dark fried chicken, which at $11 isn't going to put Chicken Express out of business.  when her food arrived, she tried to give away the larger thigh piece, but the darken exterior and glistening grease deterred the remaining table guests from taking the bait.\\n\\nBefore beginning my review, as is my custom, I read a number of reviews from other clientele, and honestly was surprised at the number of higher ratings.  Then, on further reflection, I noted that the better reviews mostly focused on the facilities (separate game room, outside patio.. check, check; and good selection of drinks at the bar... check if you don't mind the premium prices).  On those points I can't argue.  I could see stopping by for a pint from the cheerful and efficient bartender(ess?), but I would strongly suggest avoiding the food.\\n\\nI do readily acknowledge that a commercial kitchen can have a bad-hair day, one that perhaps is not representative of the true quality an establishment can be capable of.  I want to believe that might be the case with our experience, but our combined score card for the evening just totaled so low that I don't see us ever returning.

However, I love all kinds of fried chicken - I'm not picky, just give me all the fried chicken! \\n\\nI've been wanting to try Downlow since they've opened and finally got the chance to this weekend after my brother expressed how much he wanted to check this place out. We came in during the evening early Saturday and it was pretty busy. I was worried we weren't gonna be able to snag a table, but by the time we ordered other tables cleared out. It was a little confusing knowing where to order - the menu is at the front and there is a pick up station right by the door, so I assumed thats where we were ordering, but we had to go to the back of the restaurant. \\n\\nI've been seeing their sandwiches all over Yelp and Instagram, so coming in that's what I wanted to get, but then I saw that they had chicken tenders on their menu, and I decided to go rogue and order that instead. I got them mild with downlow sauce and spicy jalapeno sauce on the side. We also ordered a side of their fries tossed in medium spice w/ downlow sauce on top to share. We waited less than 5 minutes before our food got to our table. For how busy it was, I was really impressed it came out that quick. \\n\\nThe fries were so so so good. They had the perfect crispiness, and the medium seasoning and downlow sauce complimented them so well. It did not take long before this was all gobbled up. The main star of the show: the chicken. Damn, this was good. We both got the 6-piece tenders and I was only able to eat 2 before I got so full. Large portions for a good bang for your buck for sure. \\n\\nThe vibe in the restaurant was fun, the staff were really helpful, and the chicken + fries were damn good. I can't wait to come back and try their chicken sandwich and get more of those fries.

You can see assembly line for their kitchen which is kind of cool. \\n\\nFood 3.5/5\\nI tried the Take It Easy (boneless thigh), the On A Bun, and their fries with the DL sauce. The fries were crispy and seasoned. The sauce was drizzled on top. The sauce was mayo based was good except we barely got any.  I also got the On a bun with medium heat. The spiciness didn't really register. The chicken was juicy. The skin was crispy and the seasoning was quite nice. It was kind of tangy, but some parts seemed as if it was burned. The sandwich had some slaw in the middle and the bun itself was mediocre. The bonless thigh was a winner. The flavor really came out and it the portion was large. \\n\\nService 3.5/5\\nThe place filled up fast when we got there and a line formed outside. Our food came out pretty fast about (7-10mins). The staff was friendly. You grab your own water from the dispenser. \\n\\nValue 3.5\\nThey have a few items that are filling and reasonably priced like the fries and chicken thigh.

But I digress. Winsor Dim Sum is, in fact, pretty hidden as far as it goes, tucked out of the way on Tyler Street in Boston's Chinatown. It's a tiny little hole in the wall with no more than 14 tables (and I'm being generous with that estimate). However, what Winsor may lack in space and aesthetic allure, it more than makes up for in awesome food and flavor.\\n\\nSit down at a table, which may or may not be communal (hey, it's better than those random Film majors that won't leave you alone in the Dining Hall, begging for Kickstarter donations), and take your pick of tempting offerings from a photographed dim sum menu. It can be overwhelming at first pass, but stick with the classics if it's your first visit, and then you can be the \\"cool friend\\" that brings people here and orders for the table next time. And with very cheap and student friendly prices, you can feel comfortable making an investment to try a new dish.\\n\\nMy all time favorite items here are the Steamed Roast Pork Buns and the Steamed Chinese Sausage Buns. Picture this - flavorful, snappy, caramelized roasted meats wrapped delicately in puffy, light dough and steamed to perfection, served to order in a cute little steamer, ready and waiting to be doused with the addictive homemade chili sauce on every table. Pure heaven. Not into dim sum? If you can get past the vastness of that menu, they also offer tons of other Chinese staples. The scallion pancakes, with golden crisp fried exterior giving way to tender carb goodness, are particularly masterful, especially when dipped in the tangy accompanying vinegar sauce.\\n\\nWinsor is an amazing alternative to the bigger dim sum palaces around the block. While the promise of eating in an old 1920's theatre down the street might sound great to Instagram, I bet the line you'll have to wait in on a Saturday or Sunday morning doesn't. So even though you might not get the best photos or incur your followers' FOMO at this simple spot, I would highly recommend Winsor for the high quality of their dim sum, cheap prices, and lack of lines and wait time. You'll be on your way to dim sum delight in no time!"},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"So I've been here a few times now.

None of them come close to the actual deliciously just right tasting dimsum in Hong Kong. Everything just lacks a certain taste. However I do give this store props for their Sampan congee. It's pretty good and very savory. This is probably the best dish I've tried here. Their shrimp dumplings (xia jiao) are also delicious. Can't go wrong with ordering these two items. Everything else remains a fuzzy memory to me (meaning it wasn't that great). Stay away in particular from the preserved egg lean meat congee. That was a huge waste of money and super disappointing especially as how it's typically a staple for dimsum restaurants. It was super bland and just bleh. Also the beef lo me in was also quite lacking. Not salty enough and way too oily. \\n\\n\\nOn the bright side though service is fast here and there's dimsum everyday and night.

I remember walking by many times and always noticed a young girl with awesome, funky colored hair. They almost went out of business but the store owner of Blue Bunny, a children's book store bought the company!!!!! They are now one...and have great gift type items for children off all ages and interests. With the same fresh made, real Italian espresso drinks! The one thing I noticed while spending time in the square was, when blue bunny and Mocha Java had their opening day, the owner of Dedham Square Coffeehouse had his employees stand on the corner in the cold and rain, with a big sign that said FREE COFFEE, the intent seemed to be to direct customers there instead of Mocha Java. to me it seemed disrespectful and rude. Dedham is a tight knit community that I feel tries to work together not steal each other's business. Mocha Java has earned their loyal customers through genuine kindness. Those loyal customers saw through this fake gimmick and went straight into mocha Java. I enjoy going into their new location and purchasing little animal charms made from crystals and stones. They sold them for a reasonable price, and made cute gifts! Nice work Mocha Java for keeping a tight community."},{"name":"Slidders Pizza","address":"13848 Tilden Rd","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"I moved down here from Boston 7 years ago, and every place I've gotten pizza has sucked.

Hop's is one of those places and it's pretty darn good! I know Hattie B's moved into town but if you're looking for your traditionally well done fried chicken then this is where it's at. I was about to board a plane and wasn't sure when and whether I would get dinner so I decided to calorie it up. I got two of their sandwiches: Chicken sandwich and their chef's special. I was told that these were their two most popular as well as the chicken biscuit sandwich. The chicken sandwich was everything a good sandwich should be: crispy, well seasoned and juicy. The chef's special sandwich was spicy and cooled with slaw on top. I liked them both but the original chicken sandwich definitely won out.\\n\\nYou can also order chicken pieces or by the half bird. Again, well done chicken that was crispy, seasoned and juicy. There may be some inconsistencies with the flavoring day by day as some Yelpers have highlighted the lack of salt. Can't say that was my experience. If I could conveniently pick up or have these chicken sandwiches delivered to me, I would probably eat here more often.

Either get to the restaurant early and/or agree to share a table with other people; and (3) If you use your chopsticks as drumsticks during the meal, you are an ass and I will never allow you to eat with me again.\\n\\nAnyway, I was once told that there are really only about six dim sum chefs in Boston worth their salt, and that the various restaurants are constantly stealing said chefs from each other.  When this happens, you can taste the results in the lower quality of the dim sum.  I think the reason Winsor is consistently good is that the dim sum chef is also its proprietor, so he's not going anywhere.\\n\\nThe dim sum are not slung from a rolling cart here as it's not big enough of a place for it to happen, but this means the dim sum tends to be fresher, and fresher means tastier.  Nearly everything is good here, particularly such stand-bys as steamed shrimp dumplings (har-gow), steamed pork dumplings (shu-mai), and steamed bbq pork buns (char-shiu bow).  Try ordering off the beaten path too.  The turnip cake in XO sauce is great: turnips are made into a paste, mixed with a Chinese sausage and dried shrimp and stir-fried with bean sprouts and XO sauce.  XO sauce is a savory sauce made with dried scallops that has a spicy kick.  Winsor also does a great job with it's ginger-scallion tripe and my favorite, steamed tofu-skin stuffed with ground pork in oyster sauce.\\n\\nService in Chinese restaurants, including Winsor, tend to be curt but efficient.  I wouldn't expect to be coddled if I were you.  \\n\\nThis is a place for authentic dim sum and is the first of my forthcoming reviews  of good, authentic Chinese restaurants in the greater Boston area."},{"name":"Soy GRILL TERIYAKI","address":"9738 SE Washington St, Ste W, Mall 205","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great service and consistently delicious food!

We drove from DFW to visit Family Business Beer, which we loved, and Jester King.    Our Jester King visit was on a super busy Sunday evening, on a holiday weekend.  Tons of people.  There is ample parking available.  Weather was nice, but got cold as the sun went down.  I don't mind the cold and I expect to be a little cold in an outdoor venue, but keep reading and you'll see why even I got uncomfortably cold on this visit.  I am a wine drinker, my husband is a beer fanatic.  I started with an incredibly average glass of wine.  I get it though - it's a brewery.  My husband grabbed his flight of beer - he enjoyed it, but not overly impressed.  My two girls & I got in the long food line.  We were excited because we looked at the online menu and had decided what we wanted.  After about 10 minutes, a gentleman was coming down the line to get an idea of what everyone wanted.  He was carrying a menu with things marked through.  The entire front side of the menu was marked through.  My daughter couldn't even get a green salad.  All they had left was pizza (minus one of their vegetarian pizzas), and they were out of pepperoni.  It was evident they did not expect their holiday weekend crowd.  I ordered 3 pizzas, paid and was then told it would be about 55 minutes.  Ok - fair enough - it's brick oven pizza.  We'll wait.  An hour and a half later, we had our pizzas - hardly any ingredients on them, crust a bit too done in places and freezing our fannies off!! They have heaters, but not covering all of their tables. I will say that on one of my husbands attempts to check the status of our pizzas, a nice guy handed him some bread and marinara sauce and comped him a beer.  I think they could feel the pressure.  As far as family friendly, if your kids like to run around an open field and kick a ball, then this is a good spot for them.  Otherwise, bring some entertainment for the wait if you're eating.

Even a roasted marshmallow and Thai Ketchup sauce. We really didn't try any that we didn't like. I ordered the Tex-Mex Haystack burger and my son wanted to try the Chicken Parmesan burger. Both very good choices and both came out perfectly cooked. I love Gouda cheese (Tex-Mex) and that's what sold me. It also seems to be a popular choice. Because we were so stuffed we didn't get to try their shakes, but I'm hearing these are a must as well. Bananas Foster is supposed to be the jam! I'll be back. I have a lot more to try."},{"name":"49th Parallel Coffee","address":"2902 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"During my short stay in Vancouver, I think this had to be my favorite coffee shop. The shop is HUGE - lots of space to lounge, sit and enjoy your coffee and pastries. I like how the right side of the shop was a cozier nook for lounging (the side closer to the bathrooms), while the left side of the restaurant had longer tables (perfect for larger groups like ours) and was closer to the ordering station. \\n \\nThere was a constant stream of people in and out of the shop during our visit, but the line moved quickly. So, by the time we got to the front, there wasn't enough time for me to really peruse the donut selection and decide on a flavor. I ended up going through the line once and ordering coffee, then standing in line a second time in hopes of studying the donut flavors a little more carefully. I read great things about Lucky's Doughnuts, so I really wanted to try one. \\n \\nOne of our group members got a donut, but I didn't end up getting one during this trip. I really would have wanted to try the square-shaped peanut butter donut, but I don't like jelly (and it has a jelly filling), so I decided to pass. \\n \\nIf you're looking for great coffee and sweet pastries, check out this spot. There's a tiny parking lot immediately in back of the shop with 2-3 stalls; otherwise, it's street parking. \\n \\nHere's what we got: \\n \\nCoffee of the Day: During our visit, the coffee of the day was called Guatemala San Juan. It featured a plush texture and chamomile aroma with flavors of apple and cashew. One of our group members ordered this coffee and really liked it; he enjoyed the fragrance and the slight hints of the apple and cashews. This was an interesting combo that I wouldn't have expected (for coffee, anyway), but it was a hit within our group. \\n \\nLemon Meringue Bismarck: This was the one donut we got, since we had just come from breakfast. But our group member who ordered this likes lemon meringue pie, so he was really happy with this flavor. It featured a perfectly torched meringue topping, as well as a lemon curd filling (at least, that's what it looked like to me). This is a great option if you want to try one of the donuts but aren't super into sweets; because of the lemon flavor, this pastry is more tart. \\n \\nVenezuelan Coffee: At first, I was going to stick with my usual coffee order (some type of mocha or latte with soy). But I asked about this Venezuelan coffee (I had also seen photos of it and was curious), and I'm so glad I ordered this instead. It features caramel inside the latte-like drink, as well as the coffee shop's homemade almond milk. It tasted so good - I like sweeter coffees, so this was right up my alley. I loved that I could aptly taste the caramel flavor, and the almond milk was smooth and divine. Plus, the latte art was amazing - usually, the latte art in my drinks isn't that great because I get soy milk, but the design on this was still picturesque. Great taste and flavor; I'd definitely order it again. \\n \\nCinnamon Sugar Old Fashioned: Now and then, I crave old fashioned donuts because of their texture (not as smooth, dense or heavy as the yeast options). Because this one is covered liberally in cinnamon sugar, it's one I would want to try one day. I love cinnamon, and this donut reminded me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch ... but in donut form. This was one of the plainer donuts in the display case, but sometimes, simple is best. \\n \\nCoffee and Donut Combo: If I were eating here, this is what I would have ordered. It features a 12 oz. coffee of the day paired with any donut of your choice. For $5, that was a deal, as donuts are around $3.50-4 alone."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"1314 Glenwood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I had been wanting to try out this place for awhile.

Instead, I figured I'd get coffee.  They had horchata lattes on the menu, which sounded amazing, and I got so excited I ended up ordering one as a hot drink and another as a cold.\\n\\nSomehow, as great as espresso with horchata sounds, it wasn't.  I don't know what happened.  I was so disappointed.  Both versions had a very strange acidity to it and I don't know if that was coming from the coffee or from the horchata.  It might be that the combination of the two somehow brought out the worst qualities of both.  It didn't have the flavor of coffee, but it also didn't taste like horchata.  It didn't even really have a cinnamon taste.  Of the two, the cold version was slightly more palatable, but even then, I only managed to drink around a fourth of it.  The hot version, I took three or four sips, each time trying to convince myself it was okay, but it just wasn't.\\n\\nI thought about that coffee my entire flight back home.  It was such a confusing thing.  What I finally decided is that maybe they did not stir up the horchata and it had settled, so what I was served was a shot of espresso with really watery rice when all the real flavor was down at the bottom and never made it into my drink.  That's the only way I can conceive of them making a drink that tasted the way it did.\\n\\nMaybe instead of using actual horchata, they should just make it a dairy drink where they use espresso and cream, plus a little bit of vanilla flavoring and blend in some cinnamon."},{"name":"Satu'li Canteen","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy, Ste E","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"By far the best quick service place in all Disney parks!

Though I've been driving past this place for the last 9.5 years, watching it change names over and over again, I'd never been.  I think one of the reasons I never chose this place before was the horrendous parking situation at Jock's and Jill's... but there was free parking in the part of the lot down the hill right at the corner of Juniper and 10th.

The pie top was flaky but extremely dry so it didn't really work if you tried to cut straight down and get a clean piece of the pie top plus a steak chunk in gravy. Your best bet would be to chop out up the top and give it a quick mix in the gravy first. The steak was cooked perfect but I was expecting a little more meat to be honest. The mushroom chunks were just about the same size as the chicken so when it's about 50/50 there wasn't all that much meat.\\n\\nThe seasonal veggies were also a let down. I think it was just various kinds of squash and potato chunks so not any kind of variety. They were also covered in a seasoning that lessened the flavor and made them off putting after a few bites so I didn't eat much of those.\\n\\nThe highlight of the meal was mom's meat loaf though. I don't have meat loaf often but this was incredibly good! It was moist and had a little more saut√©ed onions mixed in than I'm used to(which I loved) because it gave a little extra texture to each bite. And the tomato sauce on top was also delicious!

The inside makes you feel like you are not in America but somewhere like Dubai or Egypt. It sounds weird but it works great. The drinks are quite expensive as the martini's are now 10.50 and not the best you have ever had either. The Draft beer selection is quite disappointing. The food is pretty good not the best I have ever had but I do like the Mac N Cheese. Their Mac N Cheese is by far the best I have ever had.

The handful times of times I was forced to grab drinks there because Soma was too packed--I would sit at the bar and wait over 25+ mins just to get her to acknowledge me let alone get a menu. The last time I visited I waited 45 mins to get to a drink! I watched her service gentlemen that walked in and stood in close proximity to me, but failed to acknowledge my existence even though I was feet from her and came in much earlier. At this point I had to ask a cocktail waitress who was walking by if we could grab menus. She proceeded to tell me that the place was really busy and we'd have to just wait. Shortly after she dropped off her tray she went behind the bar and snickered a few words to Mrs. Charming and my girlfriend and I were finally asked what we would like to drink. It's too bad their female bartenders are that rude. The men that work their are top notch. I refuse to go back or recommended their bar/service to friends.

Our server was very nice. And my non-descript glass of red wine was nicer. As a lover of sausage, chorico, linguica, etc...I was pleased to see the appetizer selections.  We had some linguica and another sausage based pate plate. My favorite Portuguese offering (albeit a boring one) is the queijo fresco, which made me miss OCantinho. It's simply fresh cheese and tomatoes w/ oil and minced red onions and seasonings. It is so! good. For dinner, my companions had steak dishes (which I tend to avoid in most restaurants, unless its an Argentinian place or a nightly special). I just find that in Spanish or Portuguese restaurants, the meat is the same cut (over and over) and it is usually over cooked (regardless of you specification). Personal taste. I'm also probably going to die from a parasite found in raw meat, so it's my funeral- per se. I also think that these are the places to get fish!!

Maybe that was my bad - should have set my expectations way lower. Actually, should have just taken my expectations, scattered them on the floor, stomped on them, then  tossed them out a moving vehicle. But let's start from the beginning.\\n\\nTonight started off quite promising. It was a Saturday evening around 7:10. The restaurant was mostly empty so we had the full attention of our wonderful waitress Morgan (no sarcasm here, she was actually great). In hindsight, an empty restaurant on a Saturday night at 7pm should have been a red flag, but we were staying at the hotel so this was a convenient spot for dinner. Morgan was very knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations for us. I ordered the Bistro Steak + Frites, medium rare.\\n\\nThen we waited. And waited some more. We waited so long I started to wonder if they had gone off to the fields to fetch a cow to slaughter for my sirloin steak.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, the food arrived at our table. While the garlic fries were on point, I found that the sirloin steak had already been cut (unnecessary but okay). The steak, which was supposed to be medium rare, was medium if I'm being nice, medium well if I'm being accurate. Since the steak came to me cut, the kitchen staff had already seen the inside and made the decision to send it out even though it was clearly not medium rare. Morgan took one look at it and said, \\"yeah that's medium well.\\" She took it back to the kitchen for them to remake it and said it would take just a few minutes.\\n\\nSo I waited. And waited some more. I waited so long I flagged down another waiter to go find Morgan because I was pretty sure they all forgot about my food. I actually kept checking my phone because I was hungry. I waited for 21 minutes for my new steak to come out.\\n\\nNow, when I eat at a restaurant with my family, I want to eat WITH my family. Instead, I got to watch them finish their dinners, and they returned the favor when my steak finally came out. The good news is that this one was actually medium rare. The bad news is that it was lukewarm at best. Maybe that's why it took 21 minutes for a medium rare sirloin to arrive at my table - they were waiting for it to cool down..?\\n\\nMorgan understood our frustration and asked if there was anything she could do to make our dinner more enjoyable. How about go back in time and tell me to dine elsewhere? She ended up comp-ing half the steak on our bill. It was a nice gesture, but it was overall still a crap dinner experience.

I love that they offer their rolls \\"Connecticut style\\" (butter instead of mayo), which is obviously the superior lobster roll style.

We had brunch on a Sunday morning. The menu is set and they don't make substitutions. They also charge you if you cancel your reservation. The price includes tip and coffee, which was nice.\\n\\nWe popped in around 9:55 for our 10am seating. We were the first two seated. We didn't understand the layout of the seats. If you are dining with a partner, you sit next to him/her, not across. Several other couples made this false assumption too. So we couldn't exactly sit where we wanted. \\n\\nCoffee followed directly. Extracto drip with sugar lumps, raw sugar lumps and cream on the table. The coffee was good! The cups were huge, black, ceramic. They didn't hold the coffee hot but they will refill it, very attentively, as much as you want. Coffee got cold, pretty quickly. Maybe rethink those cups to a smaller size or another material. Brunch is slated to last an hour. \\n\\nFirst course was a half cake/half souffle (like 25/75) of apricot and bacon. It was divine. The ramekin kept the food hot (should the coffee be served in these?) the entire course. The egg was a bit heavy, esp with creme fraiche and bacon, so the next course was delightfully lighter, crisper fare. \\n\\nSecond course, a bigeye tuna, with a smoked olive oil aioli (so good), some pesto-ish sauce, crisp greens and a few halved orange tomatoes. This dish was excellent. I wished my plate had 1-2 more tomatoes but every ingredient was thoughtful and played well with the overall symphony, esp after the heavy cream/egg dish. \\n\\nThird course disappointed me, but that's not their fault. It had a duck egg, which was exceedingly rich, under hollandaise (very rich). The other components of the hash were lamb from Corvallis (seasoned, a bit sweetly, like a nutmeg warmth), zucchini, confit potatoes, red bell pepper and mushroom. I wish the potatoes had skin on or were larger, or had been seasoned a bit more, I wish the egg wasn't so heavy...I'm not exactly sure why but it didn't work for me. I asked for a small side of hollandaise to cover the potatoes a bit more but ultimately the dish was a no for me. I think the ingredients didn't pack enough flavor, compared to the other courses. The tuna was rich and bold, the tomatoes were ripe and flavorful, the apricot and bacon were strong flavors. In the final dish, the potatoes were nuanced, the bell pepper tasted blanched, the mushrooms were textured but not strong flavored, the lamb was slightly sweet while the duck egg was a wall of richness. I wish the flavors were more bold or seasoned. I don't want to call the dish bland, but it didn't dance with flavor, spice and boldness the way the other two dishes did. It was comforting, warm, rustic and filling but the flavors left somthing to be desired for me. The piece of rustic toast was salted and I appreciated that, having some dimension to the flavor. \\n\\nI'm not a food critic, I'm just a person who paid for brunch. I wanted to be wowed and just felt fed. \\n\\nIn the final minutes of brunch, we got a small plate of sweets. A raspberry cake, a key lime confection with a poppyseed crust and a white chocolate truffle with coconut in the middle. A bit of fresh fruit wouldn't have been amiss here in the final stage. Perfect apricot, reminding us of the first dish or something perfectly ripe to take away, like a pear or a handful of berries. \\n\\nThe staff is skilled, no doubt, and they run a tight ship. I appreciated the service, the menu curation and the formality of the meal. You can tell every piece of Beast is purposed, not accidental. \\n\\nWe talked after about the point of the communal seating. It'd be nice if there were some items that were shared, like a salad, extra toasts, some reason to interact with the people at the table. If not, if everything is single portioned, it adds a stiffness; no one wants to eat first, we kind of hid our feelings about the dishes, it was formal and stilted, dining with strangers. If we'd had some reason to interact (pass the salt, please), it might have made more of a warm setting. Despite a table of 8, our table didn't share any conversation, it was clearly 4 groups of 2. \\n\\nI'd go back in another season to see how the menu changes for brunch. The dinner prices are beyond my means, by a long shot - but brunch was worth checking out. You will need a reservation and promptness is expected.

However, some of my favorite menu items are the Coconut Shrimp, the Baby Back Ribs (because that guava BBQ sauce is otherworldly!), the Stuffed Plantain Bowl (because plantain...stuffed!), and of course the Rum Cake w/ Ice cream for dessert. \\n\\nUnfortunately the service at the Sanford location is a bit spotty, hence the 3 stars. We live between the Altamonte and Sanford locations, and we have been coming to Sanford since it opened because there's usually no wait, so that's a plus. The hosts and wait staff are always friendly, but oftentimes hard to track down once you place your order. We have had many dinners here where an item or two were wrong or we needed something and couldn't seem to flag down out waiter. On our most recent visit, we noticed that they now have the little electronic kiosks at the table, which I guess helps with that issue because when we pressed the service button (like on an airplane) a nearby waiter attended to us quickly.

This 1 star review is directly representative of my feelings toward the abomination they called a burger for their \\"Big-Ass Burger Mondays\\" this past Monday and all those involved in its creation.\\n\\nTo me, Swift's Attic has more style than substance. The atmosphere is pretty nice and I feel they want to sell themselves as a gastropub that churns out quality food. Perhaps they normally do, but the appetizer and \\"Big-Ass Burger\\" my friend and I had was anything but quality. They do change their burger every Monday so it is possible the other ones are better - however, the very fact that they rolled this one out with any confidence is concerning.\\n\\nBefore taking a bite, I thought it was a good deal for the burger to be $10, especially considering their gimmick of making only 18 of them for the night. After having it, I wouldn't say it was worth $2. Simply put, the burger was gross. First of all, there wasn't much that was \\"Big-Ass\\" about it. Maybe their other burgers were huge, but with this one I think they have delusions of grandeur. Second, and most importantly, the quality of the ingredients was s*#%, period. A McDonald's fried chicken sandwich is better quality than this was. The chicken meat itself was mushy, not firm or tender at all. Seemed like there was a lot of filler mixed in with the meat. The consistency and taste was very much along the lines of Tyson's frozen breaded chicken breasts. They used Kraft cheese singles (or another brand) for what they called \\"swiss cheese\\". Swiss cheese that was not. Last, but certainly not least, it's not even a burger. As far as I'm concerned, unless the word \\"veggie\\" or \\"chicken\\" or \\"buffalo\\" is in front of it, it ain't a burger without beef. There was zero beef to be found on this one. My friend made a good point that if they raised the price to $15 and used better ingredients, this might have been at least decent. The fact they charged $10 for what they served was insulting.\\n\\nThe fries were the worst fries I recall having at a restaurant. They were stale and completely flavorless. They called them \\"seasoned curly fries,\\" but there was nothing seasoned about them. Their Devils on Horseback appetizer was bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese and other stuff (does it really matter?). It amounted to not being very memorable or very good.

My inlaws were visiting and we suggested Pig Floyd's when Four Rivers was mentioned -- we ordered and paid in cash and no receipt was offered (we asked later and they said that was protocol for no receipt if cash is paid - uhhhhhhhhh). So our order went in incorrectly -- we got (and initially paid for) a half rack instead of a full rack of ribs. When our food started to come out 30 min later (we expected this since it this is typical), we noticed that we only got a half rack and mentioned it. The first busser was NOT happy and was arguing that we only ordered and paid for half a rack -- we said it was probably a mistake and we asked the receipt. He went back and got it and it had a time stamp (this is how we knew how long each step took). So we ordered our second half of the rack (he took a 20 and returned our change - no receipt). And we waited. 50 minutes since we have ordered now and we still don't have half our food so we went up to say something and they were all confused (we had another sandwich from our original order that we are waiting on still). We showed them the receipt and they put in the order. So now it is 60 min plus and our food is cold. It took an additional 20 min for our sandwich and another 30 min for the second half rack of ribs (we asked twice more for this). By the way -- no apology yet (just rolling eyes) until now another waiter comes by and asks if everything is ok and we explain that we are still waiting - he offers dessert on the house and to get it out - he was the first apology we have gotten. So we eat and wait for possible dessert and go and ask - oops, they are sold out of dessert. Finally the manager gets called and he offers a future credit then a partial refund.

We were staying at a local resort and they specifically told us they could deliver to the building, but not the room and asked us for our building and room number, which we agreed was fine. Shortly after we received a call from the driver who stated he was at the main building and that they do not deliver to our building, which was a good 15 minute walk. Less than thrilled that I now had to jog to the main building and back at midnight only to return to our room to realize the order was wrong.

The food was wonderful, with a reasonably-priced range of British staples mixed with Southern favorites. \\n\\nHowever, when we arrived we stood, waiting for anyone to help seat us, for about five full minutes. That may sound like whining, but it was an unprofessionally-long wait. Once we were seated we waited so long for one of our drinks (water!) that one of our party gave up and got his glass from the bar. Later, once the delicious food arrived, we needed some drink refills. Once again, service was spotty and required repeated requests. For the food--start with the Blue Cheese Chips. Crispy homemade potato chips, dotted with blue cheese and bacon bits. Unique and tasty. The Shrimp and Grits was wonderful and rich. We also had the Fish and Chips. They have a massively thick pork chop that rocks--consider sharing it-seriously (even you big eaters). On top of the great food, the atmosphere is delightful. It's in a charming, converted brick house, in a neighborhood. The only thing that gives it away is the group of patio umbrella tables out front.

Originally, we were only stopping in for a drink & for a side order of collards (I've been wanting some good ones) We ended up meeting our absolute fave waiter of all time! His name is David and he is so charismatic and personable it was hard to NOT listen to any of his suggestions. I almost suggested leaving before he came because all the drinks had whiskey and I'm not a whiskey fan. But when he suggested the porch rocker and was very dead set that I would love it....I couldn't say no. I am SO glad he persuaded that to me because the drink is phenomenal. AND my boyfriend took a sip and said it was good to (Mind you, he is so picky and does NOT touch whiskey) \\n\\nWe ordered sides because we had been bar hopping around Assembly and got a few apps at Tony C's so we weren't really hungry. We ordered the Mac & Cheese, Collards, and corn bread. OK, collards were cooked differently than I'm used to because it had some sweet glaze on it. It was a little sweet for me but it was still very good! Mac & Cheese was AMAZING. I am not a huge fan of mac & cheese normally but there was a kick to it that made it even better. The corn bread tasted like when my boyfriend had it down in Mississippi (major compliment) The second drink David recommended for me was the Berry Smash (you could taste the whiskey a little bit more but it was very good as well!) My boyfriend stuck to his normal Vodka & Cran (Lame haha) For dessert we got the Pecan Pie and it was very very very good. I choose Pie over Cake anyday and I want to go back and try more pies. \\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere is great, it wasn't too crowded when we went. The food, even though we ordered sides, were fantastic. I want to go back and try actual entrees next time. And the service....beyond perfect.

They also have plenty of vegetarian options. We ordered a bottle of Malbec (used the 25% off a bottle of wine from yelp). The wine was very good, we also got fresh bread for the table. Then we each ordered a vegetarian pasta. The mushroom ravioli was the star. My least favorite was the eggplant ravioli as it was slightly underdone and the marinara tasted almost like store bought ragu. The mushroom tagliatelle had very good pasta, the oil sauce was lacking a little in flavor. The last dish was gnocchi which they agreed to prepare without chicken for us. It was a solid dish, the gnocchi had great texture. The service here was wonderful and even gave us a tiramisu on the house for my mother's birthday. All in all it was a solid experience.

The food here is delicious, filling, affordable, and served up quick.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located street level in the Modera Midtown apartment building (same building as Japanese restaurant Momonoki and Momo Cafe). You get 2 hours free parking in the Modera deck with validation from Halal Guys (ask at the register). The entrance to Modera's deck is just to the left of The Halal Guys' storefront. Metered street parking is also available. Use the Parkmobile app to pay for, monitor, and add time to your meter if needed. Zone 51554. Street parking is free on Sunday.\\n\\nThis is a fast-casual restaurant chain where you stand in line and servers behind the counter prepare your order, on the fly, in assembly line fashion (like Chipotle). The restaurant is new and clean with an open kitchen, self-serve drinks (both fountain and canned/bottled), and a small variety of table and counter seating. It's a small place. The inside can seat maybe about 20 customers while the uncovered sidewalk patio outside seats about 12. There are two keypad-locked unisex restrooms.\\n\\nThe menu is simple. You can get a sandwich ($6.99) or platter (small $7.99, regular/large $8.99) filled with the following: chicken, beef gyro, combo (chicken and beef gyro), or falafel. Sandwiches come wrapped in pita with lettuce, tomato, and sauce. Platters come with orange rice, lettuce, tomato, pita triangles, and sauce. Their sauces include their popular \\"white sauce\\" (a server told me it's mayo with herbs), hot sauce (it's legit spicy), and barbecue sauce (it's good). Sides and desserts include hummus, baba ghanoush, and fries ($2.99 each), falafel (2 for $1), and baklava ($1.99).\\n\\nI really like both the sandwiches and the platters. I think the sandwiches are a bit tastier than the platters because you get to eat that warm, fluffy, and soft pita wrap; however, the sandwiches can be messy to eat and the platters come with more food. I'm not a huge fan of the pita triangles that come with the platters because they're thin and relatively hard. The pita that comes with the sandwich is where it's at.\\n\\nI prefer the beef gyro over the chicken, but the chicken is fine too. To me, the beef gyro is almost lip-smacking good. It's got a nice, tender consistency (so does the chicken) and an almost addictive savory flavor. If you get a sandwich, I think beef gyro is the way to go and if you get a platter, you should get the combo (beef gyro and chicken).\\n\\nThe white sauce is a must and, if you spicy food, the hot sauce too. The Halal Guys' hot sauce is concentrated so if you've never had it before, you might want to start small. I like to get 2 or 3 lines of hot sauce in my sandwich or platter. Their barbecue sauce is actually pretty good too. It's smoky and strongly flavored. You can always ask for sauces on the side.\\n\\nThe falafel are yummy. They're delectably crispy on the outside and warm and comforting on the inside. At 2 for $1, they're a good cheap side to get.\\n\\nService I've experienced has been great. The staff has been polite, attentive, and quick. When dining in, servers will come by with squeeze bottles of sauce if you want more sauce. This place works well both for dine-in and takeout.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review, if you check into Halal Guys on Yelp, you get 20% off your order.\\n\\nThe Halal Guys' first Georgia location opened in January 2017 on Buford Highway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-chamblee-4).

The charcuterie plate, however, not so good. Expensive and very little to it.  Jester King owners and management need to do a little research on charcuterie boards and look at some photographs.  There is so much that COULD be added to theirs for not too much extra cost to them. Different mustards, spreads, chutneys, nuts, pickles, peppers, etc.\\n\\nI have given 4 stars instead of 5 due to the charcuterie board and the VERY VERY hot bathrooms.

The plate comes out with 2 big portions of meat (relative to other places) and a salad. I must say I don't mind for the skin or patty but a little bowl of soup would have been good. The meatballs were really nice, a little on the sweet side as it should be. I think I had a huge amount of meat so the sweetness wore me down. I would highly recommend the crispy pork belly.

None of that powder stuff. It's a little grainy and extremely fragrant. It's a tad on the sweeter side.  \\n\\nI've always been hesitant to come in here. I haven't heard much about it and rarely notice it when I walk by. It's a little pricier than your average Vietnamese restaurant, but keep in mind it's hard to find a good Vietnamese place in downtown Portland.

However, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was for me to find food to eat here. I was excited because it's not very often I eat BBQ food, so it was cool to kind of have those flavors again. But the best part about this place is that it's infused with Latin cuisine, so it gives it that extra flare.\\n\\nNow on to the part you're waiting for, what did I eat? I had a Tofu (Pork) Belly Taco, fried plantains, and a side of seasoned vegetable with southern sweet tea lemonade. It was all soooo delicious. I enjoyed the flavors of the taco very much, it was delicious. The plantains were amazing! They were perfectly ripped and sweet, just the way I like them. Lastly, the vegetables were really good as well, they tasted smoked (in a good way) which made me want to eat like 4 more bowls.\\n\\nThe prices here (at least for what I ate) are very inexpensive, which is also a big plus.\\n\\nI wouldn't say I will be a regular here, but if I'm ever craving some smoked BBQ tofu tacos for cheap, I will stop here for sure.

Eventually I found Toast's Yelp page, saw she hadn't reviewed them and we went to give them a try.\\n\\nAs for the positives when we got there, the wait wasn't too long. We requested seating outside, which made us wait longer than others that were willing to take a seat anywhere. A gentleman came out and offered drinks of our choice while we waited which certainly made the wait better. And the Breakfast Old Fashioned I had was wonderful. A great twist on a classic drink. Everyone that worked there was wonderful and nice, which also wanted me to rate them at four stars.\\n\\nThe problem came in that I wasn't impressed with the food. It was alright, nothing tasted particularly bad, but nothing beside the drink really excited me. We split our meals so we could sample more items, and I'm glad we did. If I'd only had the french toast it would have been a much larger letdown. It was really dry and lacked much flavor.

We were a group of 6 which I understand is larger and serving can be a little bit more difficult, but they messed up 4 out of 6 orders and tried arguing with us about it. But, the funny thing is the ticket that was rung up said the correct thing on it, they just didn't read the ticket. Probably would've been a 4 star if the people weren't so rude. The hummus was good, but again not savory or flavorful and I tried the mixed shawarma which was good, just nothing amazing. If you are going to try this place, definitely use the spicy sauce.

A bench outside to sit in front of the store. Alongside the wall were antique decorations or gifts to spruce up the ice cream shop. Many people living in this area bring their dogs so it's a very dog-friendly place. It's so dog-friendly that a dog walked into the store without it's owner.

That can't be denied. Where Billy's suffers, I think, is from a decided identity crisis.\\n\\nIs it a neighborhood spot? A jazz club? A sports bar, a restaurant, a cocktail lounge? Certainly a great bar can be a few of these at once, but Billy's is trying to cover too much territory right off the bat, and in doing so not doing an exceptional job really at any of it.\\n\\nOn one recent Sunday afternoon visit, a football game was on, but any cheering was shushed by the folks sitting at the bar and the view was blocked a bit by the folks sitting on the former-shuffleboard-table-turned-high-bar. Also, Billy's apparently features live music, but the calendar on the website hasn't been updated since early September so that's clearly not the main focus. Occasional sandwich boards on the sidewalk advertise live music, but the bar closes at 10 so it would seem to be more of a dinner accompaniment....so is this a restaurant then? Well no, it's called Billy's BAR, despite a decidedly restaurant feel.\\n\\nAnd it doesn't seem like it's really your friendly local neighborhood joint either. At $3.50 a bottle for domestics, you're probably not getting Joe Blue Collar in there as a regular when other bars in the area offer them for $2.25/$2.50. And that's fine, if it's supposed to be more upscale - although that just doesn't feel like the best fit for the surrounding neighborhood. Also, on all 3 visits service has been really spotty. I've had to go to the bar to order more than once, while the staff chatted with friends at another table or at the bar.\\n\\nI think if Billy's gets a little more focus it could really be something. Maybe offer some later hours. Advertise music better (hint: where else in that area can you go to hear live music? ****crickets****) by updating the website with dates, bands, type of music, etc. Or offer Monday night football drink specials, if you want to go that route. The bones are there, for sure - there's a LOT of potential here. Just narrow the focus.\\n\\nMany reviews are saying this is \\"just what Beaverton needed.\\"  However, rather than filling a perceived void, Billy's just leaves me wanting more and at this point, looking somewhere else to find it."},{"name":"Jim Dandy Drive-In","address":"9626 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"You may think five stars is a stretch for a drive-in but this place is all my guilty pleasures under one roof!

He was great! Very helpful and patient. \\n\\nI'm not really a burger fan, so it was nice to see the creative menu options... including shrimp, tuna and chicken burgers. I opted for the Spicy Thai Shrimp Burger. YUM! It featured finely chopped shrimp and a little breading, plus a light slaw, lettuce and tomato on a toasted brioche bun. The flavors were well-paired and the texture and consistency was well-balanced. I'd order this again.\\n\\nMy family ordered traditional burgers, a turkey cobb burger, a seasonal chicken burger featuring fresh watermelon and avocado, french fries and sweet potato fries. Everyone seemed to like their food. The seasonal chicken burger looked particularly delicious. The fries are shoe-string cut... very thin. For that reason, I think the traditional fries were a little better than the sweet potato fries. But the sweet potato fries go very well with the marshmallow sauce, which is definitely worth trying, if only for the sake of trying something that's a bit of a novelty.\\n\\nSpeaking of the sauces, be sure to hit up the sauce bar! I'm a sucker for Tijuana Flats, with their hot sauce bar... so it was fun to see this type of offering at a burger joint. Now, my shrimp burger was so moist that it didn't need more sauce. But it was fun to try the options, from sweet to spicy to savory.\\n\\nThroughout our meal, we had excellent service. Employees checking to make sure everything was to our taste, or checking to see if we needed a drink refill or assistance with anything. \\n\\nThe only downside I can recall is that the bathrooms are one-person rooms, rather than multi-stall bathrooms (which I kind of expected given the size of the dining room).

As someone who had been wronged by Brazos before; let's just say I had low expectations from the start. From initial impression it looks like any other slab of frozen beef but, they claim the Brazos \\"special\\" sirloin could possibly last you a year maybe more. This was a main selling point of the processed meat anyway ...that even if you waste your money on it today that it will last you a entire year so whenever you literally are about to die of starvation we'll, at least you bought that Brazos Beef. I followed the instructions that were included with the box itself and I couldn't seem to cook the product to an acceptable presentation. The meat reacted very different than other cuts I have picked up before. It nearly shrunk more than 50% its size as soon as it was introduced to heat. Which is due to the handling some of the lowest quality meat you can even find in Texas.Undoubtably something that Texas has always had which is healthy cattle. I have already reviewed to help another good victim of this business model built to steal from their customer. Brazos Beef never keeps track of return clients because they don't have return clients.They won't leave you a number to call, they won't let you order online for delivery . They simply want you impulsive spending habits to line up with the day a Brazos bees salesman is driving through your neighborhood.

We were directed to a cashier that had a few people still ordering, and unfortunately the person in front of us ordered $170 worth of food, so it took even longer. I'd suggest a better system of only sensing people up to open cashiers so no one gets stuck behind someone with a large order. \\n\\nThe seating area was jam packed and you may have to hover to find an open seat once sometime vacates one. The vibe was nice though with an open feel and fun decor. \\n\\nFood was just okay. The chocolate cake was really a chocolate mousse dome and was very small for the price. There were two small, flavorless berries on top, and you couldn't even taste the banana. \\n\\nOverall: C\\nOther than a fun vibe and look this place is passable for better options elsewhere."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Hm... not sure why this place is rated so highly.... I've been twice now - once for dinner + drinks at the bar, and once for brunch at a table. Both times the experience left me thinking \\"meh\\". The food was generally good - pretty flavorful and certainly not bad, and I appreciate that they do everything fresh from scratch.... BUT it felt very overpriced. And given the fact that service was downright BAD the first visit and incredibly slow the second, I don't think I'll be going back. \\n\\nMy notes on the dishes:\\n- The ribs are tender and have a good smokey taste. Definitely the highlight of both meals. \\n- The red neck nachos are not nachos, and the menu description should do more to warn you as such. For instance, the bulk of the dish is pork rinds, which is listed last in the description (?). There are no chips, and the cheese component is just a creamy grits dip. It wasn't unappetizing, but also not the thing to order if you're in the mood for nachos. Setting expectations is important. \\n- The collard greens and fried okra are both good, but a little too acid-forward for my liking. \\n- The southern wedge salad is also good, but way overpriced. Ok, I get it. I shouldn't order a salad at a southern restaurant. But at $19 a pop, I need more than just a tablespoon worth of crab meat and two thick wedges of fried green tomato on top of iceberg lettuce. \\n- My friends seemed to enjoy the various fried chicken dishes and biscuits. So this might be the way to go."},{"name":"Olive Branch","address":"115 W 3rd Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4","text":"Great dinner!  Huge portions with unique flavor and very friendly staff!

A hinky feeling told me we needed to get there early, and I was right, because when we shortly after 9:00am, we snagged the last open table.   After we ate, throngs (with appeasement coffee provided by the restaurant) had spilled out onto the sidewalk.\\n\\nThe interior at Tasty is smartly decorated, modern and replete with high ceilings, but what I think is the real draw at Tasty is their manner of serving.\\n\\nYou order several dishes and with surgical execution, the wait staff brings out your dishes in a sequence, not all at once.

Tasty encourages you to order \\"family style\\", but if you want to order a dish for yourself, that's not a problem.\\n\\nPrices are reasonable too.\\n\\nFor \\"appetizers\\", we ordered the bacon-wrapped date and the chocolate potato donut with cr√®me anglaise.  Both were fabulous, though the maple syrup the date was resting in overwhelmed the date a bit.  You may be tempted to order more that one donut, but they are so rich, you really don't want to.\\n\\nThe first main dish we ordered was the Cast Iron Frittata, which came with fava beans, olives, confit green beans, caramelized onions and feta cheese.  The other main dish was the Polenta & Sausage Ragu.  It came with fried eggs and mozzarella cheese.\\n\\nThe frittata tasted fine (maybe the olives were a tad salty), but had a not-necessarily-pleasing potpourri appearance, having so many ingredients.  It likely also had beet and the beet bled all over the frittata.  The polenta egg & sausage dish, on the other hand, was perfect,  with really delicious sausage.\\n\\nThe coffee...well...I wasn't impressed with the blend.  It just had sort of a dull unfinished flavor.

He makes little effort in both presentation (he wore a pair of old man sweatpants that drooped so often he had to drag them up his butt several times) and banter.  He did a bit about a mall Santa that was filled with stereotypical musings with racial undertones.  Why would a black Santa get turned on by a kid sitting on his lap than any other Santa?  It just wasn't funny. He finished his time with a \\"joke-off\\" where the comedians swapped off telling jokes that we've all heard before.

I ordered the shrimp rice dish and somehow received chicken which I don't eat. So not only did he pay extra for shrimp that I never got but he never got his chips with his sandwich.

That was enough for me.\\n\\nArriving on a Tuesday at about 7:45pm, we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes. The hostess sent us to a nearby pub for a drink, which we did. By the time an hour had gone by, we were seated. They stop seating at 9pm (Tuesday - Thursday, 10pm other nights), but then stay open until everyone is fed. Nobody is rushed out the door to turn over tables quicker.\\n\\nThe menu has a LOT of options. The staff's T-shirts and a huge signed poster on the wall soon made it clear that this gem was no longer hidden... it had been featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives.\\n\\nOne friend ordered veal marsala, another ordered rack of lamb, and I went with the lobster ravioli. In fairness, it was easily the best lobster ravioli I'd ever had worldwide. Just the best in Massachusetts or Maine (we are lobster folks, ya know) would have been praise enough, but these really were the best I've ever had. No lack of lobster, and the pasta was perfect. Great sauce.\\n\\nMy veal marsala companion could only rave. My rack of lamb pal spends more time in Rome than home in MA. He is incapable of complimenting anyone's Italian food in the USA, but he cleaned that plate better than a dog could have licked it.\\n\\nI would gladly return to try their Lemoncello Shrimp, and a variety of other items. Next month, they open a place across the street called BEFORE AND AFTER. So, walking a few blocks down to the pub to await a table will no longer be neccesary, and it seems one can move across the street for dessert as well.\\n\\nThey WILL take reservations for parties of 6 and more.

I ordered the lunch special that came with a cheese enchilada and mushroom taco. When they first brought it out the enchilada was literally just a loosely rolled tortilla with a tiny bit of cheese inside. No sauce, no seasoning, nothing. The taco had unseasoned mushrooms and literally nothing else, even though the menu claimed it came with cheese and onions. I asked the manager if my order was right and she replaced it, but the second try wasn't much better. Enchilada sauce out of a can, strange ingredients that didn't suit each other. The beans were more like a watery soup and tasted like they came straight from a can. Literally nothing tasted fresh. I was so shocked that a restaurant with these prices had the audacity to serve food that was below Taco Bell in terms of quality. \\n\\nAside from the food, the service was cringingly bad. Our waitress would disappear for extended periods of times. Whenever she finally would pop up, she seemed so distant and confused. Didn't ask us if we wanted refills, to go boxes, straws, absolutely nothing. \\n\\nA manger or owner (couldn't tell) came by at the end of the meal and asked if we were still working on our food (we left most of it on the plate because it was gross).

Then he made some weird and slightly suicidal comment about how that made him sad, but not to worry because he's learned how to live an unhappy life....what?? You can't make this stuff up, folks. \\n\\nEverything about this experience was uncomfortable and gross, from start to finish. In a city full of amazing (and authentic!!!)

Naah, I can't bring myself to do that - so I'm bumping it up to 3*, but the sentiment remains.  Presentation was pretty enough - although the place is unhappily dark, making it quite difficult to see and certainly to photograph - and even good in some cases: the opening cold soup was very prettily garnished.  Wines were good, although very heavily white-focussed: only one savoury red and a (very good) fizzy red to end.  We're fans of tasting menus, of communal eating, of local-sourcing: it should have been a hit.  And at only $100/head, very reasonably priced.\\n\\nSo what went wrong?  Two things: lack of adventure, lack of service.  The latter was more intrusive: the staff had a universal air of disinterest, overt frowns on their faces, and seemed to think that they were annoyed we were there.  I suspect something may simply have been wrong that evening, because it was a remarkable way to be treated: dishes were brought with a rapid-fire (and very quiet), monotonal list of ingredients, after which the presenter would rapidly flee.  In several cases plates were attempted to be cleared after only a bite or two, also odd. [The wine guy was a little more lively, but described every single wine in very similar terms - the fifth iteration of 'this is a unique varietal that doesn't grow anywhere else' was a bit much!]  And the food: nothing stood out, had any wow factor, took any risk at all - in short, it bored.  A couple of times it seemed more about collecting buzzwords than having had anyone actually taste things - \\"ice-wine-infused compressed apricot' sounds cute, but was on the edge of bitter and watery, a waste of good apricot, for example.  \\n\\nSo: meh.

After my boyfriend and I stared at each other, unsure if we should leave right then or stay, we decided we didn't receive enough condescension from hipster guy. As we were singing the waivers, my boyfriend asked how the whole process worked (since the cats were in a separate room from the cafe, we weren't sure if we had to wait our turn until the other two customers were done), to which, hipster guy looked at us like we should've memorized the Eat, Purr, Love handbook prior to entering the building (if such a thing exists, please don't read it before coming here, but rather ask this slouched beanie your seemingly ridiculous questions). After our unvoiced agreement not to ask him any more questions, I ordered a coffee thinking it would make the experience better. It didn't. Upon paying to be belittled, we exited the cafe from hell and entered the cat sanctuary room, where things started to improve.

I can see why some people might complain about the soggy bread, if you let your sandwich sit for too long or you're a slow eater it can definitely get a little soggy but I don't think it was unreasonably so. I think it was good enough to get again but I'd definitely want to try some of their other dishes first before I swing back around to the pastrami again. \\n\\nSo, if you want to have a great night out with some delicious pretzels, beer, and good food. Easy Tiger is definitely the place to check out. It's not a crazy loud bar or place where you head to meet new people. Instead, it's the place where you go to with some friends and relax, having a great time with great food.

Of the two I definitely preferred the earl grey. The filling was spot on and made me wish they had a thick tea on the menu. The tiramisu was kind of blah. Just dough covered in cocoa powder with a heavy cream filling that vaguely tastes of marscapone. My boyfriend has gotten the bacon apple fritter and some other savory pastry. The fritter was delicious but could've been served a tad warmer. As for the unnamed pastry, he said it was dry. Very dry.\\n\\nEven though I said I'm not a coffee fan I have tried their offerings (it seemed necessary) and I just didn't like it. My cappuccino tasted sour and I just couldn't handle it. But then again, I'm more of a tea girl. Which is exactly why 49th's tea offerings bothered me. Don't get me wrong, I like tea that requires steeping, but I can do that at home for cheap.

My project team and I visited for a dinner one night, and every dish we ordered was delicious! That's impressive, because usually when we order a bunch of plates at a restaurant, there are at least a couple dishes we find lackluster. \\n\\nHighlights:\\n1. Drinks: The ice ball drinks are a little gimmicky, but in a fun way, and I appreciated the refill shot concept. They had plenty of other cocktails & spirits to choose from as well, and my coworkers enjoyed what they ordered.\\n2. Food: Most of the menu is intended for sharing, so we chose a few items from each section (Snacks, Vegetables, Meat, Seafood) and doubled it for the table. The most popular items amongst the group were the Charred Edamame, Sweet Pepper Burrata, Squid \\"Fries\\" (so tender!), Pork Cheek, & the Korean Flank Steak.\\n\\nWe were able to make a reservation for our party of 10, but the space is pretty intimate, so I would say it is best suited for a date night or small meetup. If you're in the heart of downtown Austin, Swift's Attic is worth checking out.

To be honest, I did not have much expectation for this place. I know that it's run by Naomi Pomeroy which starred in Top Chef Masters (yay, Portland) so I anticipated a lot of hype and overpriced food. \\n\\nWe did the 2nd shift of dinner at 8:45. By the time we got there, people were waiting outside eagerly as the staff was preparing the dinner setting. Ambiance was warm and cozy. Seating was done in a communal style. There were only 22 seats surrounding 3 big tables. There were many staff members making sure that things run smoothly. We did the six course dinner with wine pairing. The menu changes every week and of course no substitution is allowed. \\n\\nThe first course is spring carrot soup with goat butter and chervil salsa. Simple as it sounded, the taste was amazing. Soup was smooth and not too rich. The goat butter added an extinct taste and the chervil salsa complemented the richness with the crunch and citrus. \\n\\nSecond course was a charcuterie plate that comprised of foie-gras bon-bon, chicken liver mouse, steak tartare with quail egg toast, pig head terrine lemon, and smoked salmon. My favorite here was the chicken liver mouse. Not many places can make chicken liver mouse as good as this one. Texture was as smooth as velvet and the taste was heavenly. I picked this one over the foie gras bon-bon. Although many people from my table claimed that the foie gras was the best. Personally, it tasted too much like a dessert to me (more on the sweet side). The steak tartare was my second favorite. Chopped steaks cooked to perfection resting on half of the toast while a raw quail egg laid on the other half. Such a nice combo, and it reminded me of breakfast. \\n\\nThe third course was game hen cooked with bread salad, heirloom cucumbers and fresh green peas. This dish was good, certainly a comfort food but nothing is really special about it. I appreciated all the fresh and high quality ingredients. \\n\\nThe fourth and fifth courses were beet salad and a cheese plate. I don't like beets in general, but they tasted good for what they were. The combo cheese plate certainly had an interesting selection. Beside the cheese, there were anish shortbread, fried marconas, poached apricot and honey. It was just a fun combo signaling to a transition toward dessert. They also served grapefruit sorbet to clean off the palate before dessert as well. \\n\\nAt this point, I was kind of stuffed and under the influence to enjoy dessert fully. I remembered the lemon souffle was good and so was the strawberry. There was also honey creme anglaise that I didn't quite remember what it was. \\n\\nSo that wrap up the 6 course meal. I highly suggest the wine pairing. You can totally share the wine pairing if drinking 6 glasses that night might be too much. Prepare to spend around 3 hours for dinner. It's kind of pricey, but I think it's one of those experiences that you just have to have. Go there for your special occasion.

It is a very mall restaurant in a house so I think they keep service staff highly trained but as few as possible so they don't overcrowd the space.  We tried the calamari which was pretty good but average.  We also did the linguine, chicken rollups, and risotto. I was super excited because I have not had good risotto since my time in Italy but sad to say it was a disappointment.  It had a very strong flavor of celery which I am sure is just a one-off and not how it is normally made.  Instead, I had the lobster ravioli, which was good.

My salad was dry, not dressed at all and I had to request dressing.  And my daughter's pasta which she had requested without chicken contained chicken.  Neither a huge problem, easily correctable.  Got my dressing pretty quickly but after the initial drop of our food and correction of my missing dressing and someone else's dipping sauce our server disappeared.   We were unable to say anything about the mistake with my daughter's pasta (it was a baked dish and not obvious before she began eating that it contained chicken).   After about 20-25 minutes we finally tracked down another server to get our server.  She offered to replace the dish but at that point we didn't want to wait any longer.

The brisket had a nice burn on top, not too much, not too little and was super savory and juicy.  The ribs were really good as well but a tad on the dry side for my preference... then again, my friend and I were eating there an hour before closing and I sure they make this stuff earlier so it might have dried out a little ... it didn't really matter, the flavor was excellent.  I'm being really nit picky.  The Mexican corn was divine and the black beans and rice were tasty, although the rice was a bit sticky and dry as well.  Again, not a big issue as the flavor was the main focus and it delivered!\\n\\nBecause the portions were generous, I had a good amount to brisket to take home.  Let me tell you, I dreamed about it and ate for breakfast the next morning ... cold ... and it was FANTASTIC.  Cold Brisket Breakfast?  This needs to be a trend.

It's really simple in my opinion - offer delicious creative fresh food choices supported by exceptional customer service at reasonable prices and they will come even when the line is out the door.\\n\\nThe most difficult decision you'll make here is choosing what you want because on your first visit you'll probably want to try a little bit of everything so sharing with the ones you're with is the simplest way to accomplish this no doubt your return visits will become much easier I know mine will be.\\n\\n\\n- Pork Spare Ribs - Good luck on finding any better in the State of Florida, seriously these are so delicious, the basting sauce and seasonings alone provides enough flavor that you may forget to add any of the house sauces, they are cooked to the perfect doneness to provide the tenderness you demand but with a slight chewiness that holds the meat together so you can rip it from the bone and hold it in your hand without it shredding requiring you to eat them with a fork and knife. A must try!\\n\\n- Half a Chicken - Completely cooked through, but oh so moist, tender and flavorful through and through when it first arrived I though oh okay it's just chicken nada.... It's magical chicken the seasoning on this bird is incredible, fall off the bone tender and I apologize to the owner you have some great sauces but I want it like its served, naked. The seasonings here are complex in flavor and some thought was definitely required to get this right. This is not ordinary chicken this is super chicken. \\n\\n- Black Beans and Rice - OMG this could be a meal in itself, the black beans are very special, the seasoning will have you at first bite. The flavors are complicated yet subtle you'll be wondering how can you achieve this at home because these could make the menu anywhere, served over steamed rice there's little doubt this side will be a staple going forward.\\n\\n- Grilled Corn on the Cob - All I can say is they sell a lot of corn almost every plate out of the kitchen has this side on it.

Her food was very nicely presented and showcased delicious-sounding flavor combinations in a contemporary style.  She also talked about food very intelligently.  Her restaurant Beast puts her front and center and while the dining experience is meant to be very communal, she seemed reserved (though pleasant) and all business.\\n\\nThe all business is definitely necessary to put out Beast's very strong 6-course menu for all diners simultaneously with only a staff of five (Pomeroy and another chef, a dishwasher and two servers).  I am not sure of the reasons why Pomeroy utilizes such a unique restaurant approach, but it definitely results in many great benefits to customers.\\n\\nFirst, it is a great way to ensure optimal utilization of ingredients, which allows for more ingredients to be used at peak quality and freshness; this probably also helps deliver a lower price to the customer due to less waste.  You also get a much better sense of what the chef is going for because of the more streamlined menu; finally, the set timing of the meal allows for a freshly made dessert, which is a rarity these days.\\n\\nThe dessert was a rhubarb clafoutis, which combined the lift and airiness of a souffl√© with the moistness of a bread pudding.  I loved the use of the seasonal rhubarb so that it had both a sweet and tart flavor.  It was drizzled with really good cardamom caramel--nicely sticky and the cardamom was prominent.  There was also a good ice cream on top--good flavor, very creamy and the cool ice cream worked well with the warm souffl√©.\\n\\nThe other dishes were also very good.  The carrot and curry velout√© was very velvety and had a great carrot flavor as well as both fragrance and spiciness.\\n\\nI really liked their meat course--a very good strip loin, which had a great crust and a really soft and juicy center.  It had a strong beefy flavor and the seasoning was just right.  I really liked the sides because of the balance.  There was a rich and creamy risotto, but there was also fresh, leafy and lightly bitter greens.  Fried shallots provided a great and non-greasy crunch.\\n\\nThe charcuterie plate is an always on the menu item at Beast though they do change out the small bites that make up the plate.  What they had on the plate on my visit was great.  There was an excellent tartare on brioche topped with a rich quail egg yolk.  I am not typically a fan of chicken liver, but I really liked their preparation--very creamy chicken liver on a light crisp and a nice tang from pickled onion.  The beef belly was rich and good and there was also a good pate.  The foie gras bon bon with a sweet wine gelee was a meaty, rich and creamy bite.  There was also a palate cleanser salad of fennel, bitter greens and pickled vegetables--bright, tart and very refreshing.\\n\\nThe cheese plate was also a highlight.  Great cheeses with very different flavors and all of the garnishes were good--sweet crunch from caramelized nuts and a very tasty and addictive prune soaked in liqueur.\\n\\nMy least favorite course was the asparagus with a soft boiled egg, very good croutons, Marcona almonds, and very soft and sharp Parmesan cheese. It was kind of a take on a Caesar salad and it was actually a good dish.  That being said, I thought it was simply a good asparagus dish while the charcuterie was a fun collection of bites, the strip loin was a great beef dish, the cheese was outstanding, and the dessert was one of a kind.\\n\\nService was personable and good.  The food came out at an even pace.  The staff really works hard here, but I think the restaurant needs more servers.  With the wine pairings and many customers asking a lot of questions because of the restaurant's reputation, finished plates seemed to sit too long.\\n\\nPrices are reasonable given both the variety and quality of the food.  A similar restaurant in the Bay Area could cost twice as much.\\n\\nBeast has a great dining room.  It is very simple and rustic, but it has an intimate feel that works well with this restaurant's setup.  The open kitchen also allows you to see Pomery and just one other chef cook and plate all the food.\\n\\nBeast serves great food, but it also delivers a unique experience.  The restaurant feels very much like the perfect restaurant for Portland, but its quality would make it an excellent restaurant in any city.  I am not sure how many times I will return to Portland, but a trip to Beast would be likely on each visit.\\n\\nFree street parking is available."},{"name":"Jinx","address":"3000 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It's so great finding a good neighborhood spot with Yums solid and liquid but really..... the PEOPLE there are the best at making you feel like loved family/friends.

My boyfriend and I were in Salem for a few hours before a wedding. We decided to grab lunch and stumbled upon Turners (thanks yelp)! \\n\\nWhen we walked in there was a great atmosphere & cute decor. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter, John. John was awesome, he has extensive knowledge of the menu and had great recommendations. Besides being extremely personable his service was impeccable. \\n\\nNow to the food - we wanted to order everything on the menu but I had to fit into a dress later that night. We started off with oysters & the award winning lobster bisque. John gave us some background on each of the oysters and each one was better than the next. The lobster bisque deserves the name award winning. There was a piece of lobster meat in ever scoop. There are no words to describe how amazing this was, I would drive back from NY just for that. Then we followed with steamers and a crab cake. The steamers were good and came with a garlic butter dip. The crab cake came with an apple slaw - this was on the top of my list of the many things we ate. And finally we split a lobster roll. Might have been in the top two lobster rolls I've ever had in my life. The bun was perfectly buttered and toasted and the roll was packed out with succulent lobster meat. This also came with sides of garlic spinach & parmesan mashed potatoes which were yummy. \\n\\nNeedless to say we were beyond content with Turners. Next time we're in Salem (which I hope is sooner rather than later) we will be coming back. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great seafood and service.

What I don't like as much -- the location and the staff. Let me start by clarifying the \\"dislikes\\". \\n\\nIt's not that the staff is unfriendly. It's that they appear to be more \\"staff\\" than \\"your waiter\\". They come by, take your order, then take your order to the back. Our waiter was friendly but seemed to always be \\"in a rush\\", which is not the type of energy I like to be feeling when I'm sitting with a group of friends for brunch. Despite this, I would like to point out that our waiter was very accommodating in that he helped separate my tab from the table's check so that I may place a separate to-go order for myself (it was the beignets. I had to take some home, I could not resist!) \\n\\nWhen you walk in, you may notice that right above the hostess's head, is the head of a mounted antelope, or stag. Don't be frightened -- he's there for all the same reasons you are. I love the \\"old saloon\\" feel of this place. Now, the food. I ordered The Dirty Bird, which is their customer favorite: bacon, an egg and fried chicken, all sandwiched between a biscuit, generously dressed in meat gravy! Personally, it felt like the presentation was more appetizing than the dish itself. That's not to say it wasn't good, but that the meal was a tad on the dry side and was easy to fall apart. My friend ordered the Shrimp and Grits. Very tasty! if you and your company are down to split some appetizers, I recommend you go for it. They all look good. Our group went with the beignets and the hush puppies. \\n\\nLastly, Somerville is on the opposite side of where I spend most of my days, so this place is certainly out of the way unless you live here.

The cheesecakes are delicious without a doubt, but it's not worth the ridiculous prices, extremely long waits (to be seated and for your food), and terrible customer service. \\n\\nLong story short, I ordered my fianc√© a cheesecake for his birthday last year, and honestly if I wanted the cake to look like a 5 year old made it, I would have asked my niece. I ordered the cake around 9am the morning of his birthday to be ready by 4pm. I got there a little after 4pm thinking that I would give them an extra 10-15 minutes to get my order ready because it's always extremely busy there. Didn't get my order until over 40 minutes after my arrival so it was actually about an hour after the pickup time that I requested, and yet a couple of the workers had the audacity to be extra stank and cause a scene when I was quite politely inquiring about the wait time. It's just cheesecake guys. I'm sure it gets very busy there, but you don't have to make transferring a slice of cheesecake onto a plate with a squirt of whipped cream that difficult and stressful--it will be okay. \\n\\nEven though it was evident that something was wrong from an employee yelling and being dramatic over plating cheesecake, there wasn't a manager or supervisor in sight to try to deescalate the situation. Two employees tried to remedy the horrific experience I had, and they were very sweet and accommodating, which is pretty standard for decent customer service nowadays, but it's unfortunate that some can't even manage that.\\n\\nAside from the cheesecake, there's really nothing else worth coming here for. The food is subpar and extremely overpriced. Not worth it at all unless you like overly greasy and flavorless food with high prices. I probably would never eat here again, and it may take a while for me to actually want to order a cheesecake from them again, but next time I'll be sure not to order it for a special occasion and arrive an hour later than my pickup time."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"With so many other glowing reviews of Tasty n Sons vying for your attention, I'll spice mine up with a bit of brevity.\\n\\nThe food is great and reasonably priced.

Create your own dishes are huge now and here they offer not just Pizza, but also Flatbreads, Pastas and Salads. You can chose from their recipes or create your own. My mom decided to create her own and started out with the white sauce. She then began to add different meats and cheese and topped it off with some ranch. I chose to try their barbecue chicken pizza which is one of my all-time favorites, but I also added fresh mozzarella and the garlic spread to the base of my pizza. \\n\\nWithin minutes our pizzas were delivered hot and fresh to our table. A few minutes after that we were brought over complimentary garlic knots. Upon first bite of our pizzas we knew we were hooked. I am a crust girl and theirs is somewhere between thin and pan. The flavor was fantastic. The blend of the garlic sauce, mixed with the BBQ sauce was a great match! There was enough of every topping to make the first bite just as good as the last. The vastly knots, while not super garlicy, were a great addition. \\n\\nI enjoyed my meal so much I went and bought another one to go so I could enjoy it for my lunch tomorrow.

Pulled pork and beans was EH, but arguably the best part of the meal. Sweet potato fries were very undercooked,  greens were very bland,  and the mac and cheese was dry and flavorless.  My biggest complaint though is the fact I had to pay an extra dollar on my mac and cheese AND on my sweet potato fries for them to come hot?  I've never seen anything like it.  Its literally in a drop down menu and you have to choose to pay an extra dollar on each item for them to come hot lol. I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried lol.   Def my first and last order.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Sorry,  not sure how to directly reply to the owner's comment but I was absolutely charged an extra $2 when I chose to have my mac and cheese and beans 'hot', as my pictures show very clearly that you cannot choose hot without the dollar upcharge..I can assure you that I order from Uber Eats often and from many places and that's not an option on any other dropdown menu, for any other restaurant, that I've tried, on the app... so if that's not your doing then you should really look into that with Uber Eats because its absolutely a deterrent and its going to hurt your chances with first time customers. There are trackers on Uber Eats. My food came directly from your restaurant to my house within 15 min of it being ready...  things that are seasoned properly don't lose their flavor because they traveled a few miles.  Also just some advice- 'We're sorry to hear you had a bad first impression,  we would really like to make it up to you! You should come down and enjoy a meal, in-house, so it's fresh and hot, right from the kitchen'... maybe something like that?

So let's break down the issues that I hope the restaurant will be able to address moving forward.\\n\\nFirst, the good: service was great. We loved our servers, and they were friendly, comfortable, and on top of things. We also sat at the large wooden table, so that was cool.\\n\\nAnd now for the \\"constructive\\" feedback: I do not intend to rant, though it may come across that way because I'm more in disbelief than actual contempt. My goal is to give a very pointed depiction of mine and my guests' experience.\\n\\nFood Problems:\\n1) The Lion House Rolls with thyme butter and candied pistachios sounded heavenly. But they came to our table, dry, hard, and overcooked, and accompanied by a brown-sugary butter. First big problem is that the food served did not match what the menu said and what I had ordered. I was looking forward to what was depicted on the menu, and the fact that the rolls were just plain bad was frustrating. A terrible way to spend $6. At a restaurant of this caliber, shouldn't someone be screening the food before taking it out to the table?? I don't know how these rolls passed, even just by looking at them.\\n\\n2) The Sirloin and Beet Napoleon also sounded amazing. It's supposed to come with horseradish cream, and I love horseradish. However, this dish was basically made up of 50% horseradish cream, very strong horseradish cream! It was practically a dish of the cream, topped with a few beets and sprinkled with sirloin. I enjoyed the first few bites since I like horseradish, but I couldn't even finish more than half of the plate because the HR overpowered everything. I tried picking out the steak and beets, but they were coated with the cream. Inedible. Does the chef here not taste the food before sending it out? No one in their right mind should have sent out that much horseradish cream of that strength on a plate of food. How do you even mistake that one!? $14 down the drain.\\n\\n3) The meatloaf was actually really good, but not $20 good. Accompanied by bland green beans, but really silky mashed potatoes. I'd get it again for $10. The mac n' cheese had amazing flavor, but for $15, it would have maybe filled the belly of a child...maybe.\\n\\nIn Summary:\\nI'm embarrassed to have taken my wife here for her birthday, as well as 7 of her friends to make them pay high prices for very disappointing food. I think a few of them probably had to have a 2nd dinner afterward. My wife and I payed around $50 for the two of us. I wish I just bought $50 worth of Taco Bell to feed the entire party and leave everyone happier. \\n\\nThis may have just been a huge fluke from the kitchen that night. I hope it was. Hopefully it doesn't happen again to anyone else."},{"name":"Guac y Margys","address":"661 Auburn Ave NE, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Update: They apologized and said that they refunded my guacamole, which is very good customer service! \\n\\nI live right by this place and go all the time and have had good experiences, except for the fact that they always seem clueless about the specials.

Because every time I go in and ask for the tacos beer special, they are like huh?? \\nBut the big reason for my bad review is that the place is called GUAC and Margys and I had some of the worst guacamole I've ever had yesterday. It was flavorless and brown and had already oxidized. It tasted like it had no seasoning or lime juice. And had they actually made it the day before or something? Also, it cost $15!!

This was my first time, as was hers, and it made fans out of us!\\n\\nWe went on an early Saturday evening before a SAK show and it was very quiet. I have to say walking in you really can't tell WHAT this place is...full bar, dining tables everywhere, a deli-lunch counter in the back, and a small stage area tucked away to the side. The decor is mis-matched as well - taxedermied saltwater fish hang from the entrance ceiling, Mediterranean paintings on the wall, and a barrel with a water pump near the bathrooms. The music couldn't decide what theme it was - I think we heard nearly a full Bob Dylan CD from when we walked in, and then it was an odd mix of classic rock, pop, and R&B. Confused ambiance aside - come here for the food.\\n\\nI haven't had baba ghanoush this good in a long time. We started with the appetizer for two and it easily fed three with leftovers. I've never actually been much of a parsley fan, and I was digging the parsley salad so much I had it on everything. It was extremely fresh and the lemon wedge added a tart punch to the already tangy parsley. The hummus was good, but I like a little more garlic in mine. The falaffel were cooked perfectly but a little bland. Tzatziki sauce was very good, smooth with slight chunks to remind you there's cucumber in there. The stuffed grape leaves were also a highlight of the appetizer, not overly filled so they held together extremely well and let the flavors of both leaf and stuffing come out.\\n\\nI had to try the chicken curry soup which was smooth, rich, full of vegetables and tender chicken, and the curry was mild with a slightly coconut sweet flavor. The salad had a nice house Greek dressing, but nothing special.\\n\\nAll three of us had gyros which were perfectly assembled. Great meat to veggie ratio and just enough tzatziki to add flavor and moisture but not overpower. They were wrapped well in a thin pita, so it wasn't too doughy either. They were excellent leftover, too, didn't get soggy and crisped up nicely in the oven without drying out or going mucky.\\n\\nPrices were reasonable, $12 for a whole 12\\" gyro and salad or fries. The appetizer could have easily been a meal for two and it was only $20 with endless pita triangles. The waitress was doubling as the bartender, since there was only one other table, but glasses were never empty and she was very attentive and pleasant. \\n\\nDefinitely a return visit in my future.

The menus are quite similar, as are the experiences, as our server told us. Even at 1pm on a Monday, it was still pretty crowded, and there were plenty of larger parties waiting for tables.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we weren't able to try their signature chocolate potato doughnut, but there were plenty of other things available on the menu, so we weren't too disappointed. We were feeling pretty hungry, so we ordered the breakfast board to share(6-minute egg, bacon, beets, chicken liver, crostini, greek yogurt with olive oil), the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich, and the chicken fried chicken with a biscuit, egg, and gravy. Sensing a bit of a theme here, eh? My favorite was likely the chicken fried chicken, since it had all the components I liked, and was a complete dish. \\n\\nService was very friendly, although it took us about half an hour to get our food, and the dishes were spaced out kinda weird, with the chicken sandwich coming out first, and the breakfast board second. Nonetheless, we enjoyed chatting it up with the staff and the people around us, so it was okay. The prices are a bit pricier for the portions, so beware of that when ordering. They recommend that you order a few dishes, since everything is meant to be shared, which is fine, but you shouldn't expect your sandwiches to come with fries, only a few potato chips.\\n\\nDon't know if it lived up to the hype, but everything we had was quite delicious and I had a great time, so I can't really complain. Definitely a great place for some unique comfort food. Make sure to beat the lines for weekend brunch by coming early."},{"name":"Goodale Station","address":"77 E Nationwide Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Ok, let's get this out of the way - this place is gorgeous, and definitely a 5-star venue. Everyone should come here once to at least check out beautiful view and swanky digs. That being said, this place is way over priced and trying especially hard to compete with the other rooftop bars around town. I came here for a work happy hour, despite the fact that there IS NO HAPPY HOUR pricing of any kind. That means no matter when you are here, you're going to pay $14-15 for a cocktail or $8-9 for a draft beer... a DRAFT BEER. I am not sure why being fancy in Columbus has to equate to overpriced beverages. This is not NYC or LA, and frankly, I'm perfectly okay with that. Our bartender was perfectly nice and attentive, and the few small plates that were purchased looked tasty. \\n\\nI have no intentions to come back to pay $4-5 more than necessary for good cocktails in this city. If you dig this kind of atmosphere and don't have any pricing concerns, I'm sure this would be a 5 star venue for you.

The other part I love - the great selection of booze mixed into crafty craft cocktails!!  The third thing I love - it's so freaking close to my favorite climbing crag in the Austin area!!  These three reasons will keep me coming back.  \\n\\nTheir interior is great, from the moment you walk in you notice the time and detail they put into this place.  The bar is the center point for your entertainment.  I love the rustic/industrial feel of it, from the bar stools, tables, all the way to the restrooms.  They do have outdoor seating as well, so Fido is welcome to join you.  \\n\\nThe bartender really seem to know his stuff and wasn't overly arrogant, but fun and engaging.  Though it was pretty busy when we were there and it did take a bit of time to get a drink.  Only one guy behind the bar at 6PM on Saturday might need to be re-evaluated as they get busier!  He did whip us up a tasty rye old fashioned and a tangy beet juice drink, \\"The Gardner\\".  \\n\\nThe counter service hostess was also welcoming and helpful.  She even came around to check on tables, whisk away empty food trays and make sure everything was A-OK for you.   When we ordered, I asked if there were any vegetarian options besides the salads and she said they would easily whip something up for me!  This was a big bonus since it was a meat heavy joint.  The counter service was a bit unexpected, but it works.  They give you a number and bring it to your table, so it doesn't feel too disconnected.  \\n\\nAs far as food - my veggie sandwich (off menu) was really good.  So don't be afraid to ask for something!  I'm excited to see if they do come up with a good vegetarian main dish option!  Maybe a chicken fried portabella mushroom?? (hint hint).   The hushpuppies were light and airy with a perfect crisp to them.  Flavor wise, however, I found them a bit dull.    They could use some spice or a dipping sauce with them.  I found dipping them into my man's pimento cheese that fell out of his burger was a good choice!  My man was happy with his burger quality and thought the pimento cheese was a great choice, but the bun left him unimpressed and a bit dissatisfied.  I believe the term \\"cardboard\\" was mentioned.  And being that it was 13.00 he expected it to all be fantastic.  The slaw however was great!  Even the deviled eggs were yummy.  I loved the pickled onion on top and they were slightly spicy and creamy.  \\n\\nOverall we liked the place, but the bun experience left my man in an \\"it ruined my experience\\" kind of way.  Guess he'll have to try something else next time!  I'd really give it a 4 star, but my man thinks a 3.  So we'll go somewhere at a 3.5.  If they get a little faster at the bar and wow him with food next time, I can bump it up!"},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely amazing and delicious!

This was the spot for me. I would hope on the streetcar at PSU and ride my kitten self into the Alphabet District and get off on NW 21st to get to this place. Great food and great prices for the average broke college kid (who still want decent sushi and bento). Service however, is another story.\\n\\nPROS - They have happy hour \\"all day\\" (you know what that means though right?), there are two menus given to you, one is their main menu and one is their \\"happy hour check-list\\" menu. The items with the smiley faces next to them denotes 50% off. Others without the smiley face is original price.\\n\\nIn terms of food, the portion is above average for the great prices. Around the Alphabet district, Sansai has the best prices (not counting Sushiville because they are below average). \\n\\nI usually get the steak plate with brown rice ($.50 extra). It comes with your choice of house tossed salads (I go with the Oriental salad and the Cucumber Seaweed salad) and also a yummy grilled veggie kabob stick. This plate is huge, enough to share with another person...$8.50. I opt for the salmon skin salad (huge portion) since it's on the happy hour menu and they smoke and grill the salmon skin just perfectly on a bed of salad ($4.50). The tempura sampler is also good value, it comes with a handful (about 6-7 pieces) of assorted tempura veggies and about 4 pieces of good, flavorful tempura shrimp. They don't use puny shrimp, they use medium average shrimp and their tempura batter is excellent ($7.00). The sushi rolls aren't bad either, especially the Spider roll (also on HH menu...$5.00).\\n\\nCONS - The service here really sucks. During lunch time, you could wave down your waiter to give you the check (or to get you more tea or sauce) but during dinner time? Good luck!  Sidebar comment, there is one Hispanic waitress there who I think is pretty but for some reason, she hates me. She treats me like crap yet I still give her good tips, it's weird.\\n\\nPOINTERS - I cannot stress how good the food here is for the price, but the service needs major improvement. Don't even think about sitting in the corner spot (newly remodeled area), because once they drop off your food, you are pretty much abandoned forever (no checking up on you, they won't even give you the bill unless you go up to them after staring at them for 15 minutes).

I brought it home and actually weighed the chicken because I was dieting. It was 2 ounces. For the 10.95 that I was charged I expect a little bit more. The second time I went I got an iced coffee. I had to wait quite a while for my order and when I tried the coffee it tasted watery. I left and went to Starbucks. The third time I tried a tuna sandwich. It was mediocre it tasted very basic- tuna on bread. I love a√ßa√≠ bowls & was driving by and saw a sign for them So I thought I would give it one last try. I get a√ßai bowls often at other places so I know what I should've received. I got it to go & was surprised when I opened the bowl. First it was smaller in size than anywhere else I've got them. Second it was purple liquid with a small amount of fruit & a spoonful of peanut butter floating in it. Every time I've ordered an a√ßai bowl it comes with frozen a√ßai on the bottom and whatever you want on the top. For $12.95 (which is more than the ones in downtown Boston) I expected more.

The egg tarts arrived first. The tarts were already made in advance and stored in a warmer. They tasted fresh with a creamy egg custard filling. The siu mai arrived afterwards. I did not find the truffle topping anything special. I would have preferred the traditional fish roe topping instead. Otherwise, the pork and shrimp portion was tasty. It took 50 minutes from placing our order for the lobster with crystal noodles to arrive. Lobster was a bit over cooked and the sauce was too salty for my liking. The noodles was a nice chewy texture. I think Neptune makes a better version. Lastly, the kitchen forgot about our shrimp dumplings so we waited even longer for that item to arrive. The shrimp dumplings tasted good. Shrimp filling was plump and nicely seasoned. \\n\\nOverall, food was good for Surrey standards. The wait times for food was too long.

But tbh, I only ever have eyes for their pizzas when I go to JKB. And veggie eaters like me will have at least one or two pizzas to select from, so that's always a plus.

Tater tots smothered in gravy and queso fresco topped with shredded ham hock.  Yes please.\\nAntelope--This was my first experience and was worried about it being gamey(sp?), but not so.  Tender meat dressed with a house chimichurri sauce served with fries that almost had a lemony zest to them.\\nSquid Fries--This was the only dish that received a kind of \\"meh ok\\" response from the group.  It was more squid onion rings in a jenga like tower.  Not bad, just didn't measure up to the other dishes that had graced the table.\\nQuail--Perfectly cooked with a nice jam pairing.

Picnic House is the first sit-down restaurant my husband and I ate at on our trip to find apartments in Portland, and we were still riding high on a celebratory wave. But I don't think it was simply a rush of endorphins that made me crush on Picnic House, but rather their consistently great service, beautiful interior and of course the delicious food. I'm definitely a fan. \\n\\nSince that initial dinner, I've been to Picnic House a number of times for lunch and all meals have been top notch. Off the (current) dinner menu I've tried the pistachio crusted salmon and the lamb chops. The salmon was prepared perfectly and the pop of the pomegranate made for not only a beautiful dish but also a immensely satisfying one. When it first came out I thought the portion might be a bit small, but it ended up being just right. The lamb? Well, it was good but I didn't closely enough consider the menu when ordering. It's basically DIY gyros, which isn't my cup of tea. The meat was prepared well, but I definitely suffered from envy of my date's meal. As for their sides, the roasted cauliflower and the fried brussels sprouts are both ridiculously good, and I didn't want to share. Some day I'd like to make a meal of just their sides. \\n\\nFor lunch the offerings are much more geared towards quick soups, salads and sandwiches, which makes sense as their location is pretty central to downtown worker bees. My favorite sandwich featured charred tomato, caramelized onions, fresh cheeses (goat, feta, cream, ricotta), arugula, basil pesto. Ridiculously good, and if they happen to have a tomato soup on the menu, would pair perfectly. Their mixed greens salad with pickled blueberries is great as well, and I added roasted chicken to make it feel more like a full meal. What can I say? I eat big. \\n\\nMy last experience at Picnic House was a bit of a production. I had to put together a dinner for 23 people, with a fairly tight budget. I immediately thought of Picnic House and led by the special events coordinator Ari,  their team were fantastic from initial contact to the dinner itself. They assisted in organizing family-style appetizers and deserts, which made service easier and kept costs down. We also selected a small number of entrees to keep ordering simple and not overwhelm the kitchen. Food took a touch longer than I had hoped, but not enough to really worry about. Everybody worked together well, and nobody was left wanting for food or drink. I'd venture to say that everybody fully enjoyed the meal.\\n\\nI don't have the opportunity to return to restaurants all that often, but knowing that it's such a reliable standby, I see myself at Picnic House again soon."},{"name":"High Note Kitchen","address":"300 S Lamar, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Super cute atmosphere and outdoor seating!

Didn't like the veggies that came with it, and whatever pickling liquid they use seems to be weirdly sweet. \\n\\nFood began with the salmon board which was pretty good. I really liked the herb spread and toppings but the crispy bagel chip wasn't my favorite.\\n\\nI ordered the fried chicken and egg biscuit sandwich. Overall it was very plain but I will say that the chicken itself was really crispy, juicy and cooked perfectly. I ended up attacking it with fork and knife because it was too tall to eat in one piece. It was definitely lacking some type of gravy or sauce. \\n\\nHusband ordered the smoked pork sandwich. It wasn't what he expected based on the description - which had mentioned a cheese sauce and a spicyness that both didn't seem to be present. The cheese wasn't melted and the bread was tough and hard to bite through. Also the fries weren't very good. He saved the second half of the sandwich anyway and when he reheated it later in the microwave he enjoyed it much more since the bread had softened and the cheese was melted. \\n\\nAll in all the experience was mediocre, which was maybe a little more disappointing that it would have been if it wasn't a birthday lunch. I'm still tempted to give it another shot since everyone seems to love it so much. Hopefully I will be able to bump it up a star or two the next time around!"},{"name":"Bahama Breeze","address":"1540 Rinehart Rd","city":"Sanford","stars":"3.5","text":"I have truly enjoyed my dining experiences at the Bahama Breeze restaurants on Alafaya and International Drive, but last night the new Sanford restaurant missed the mark.  I ordered the tostones and chicken, which I have had at both other locations multiple times.  The Sanford restaurant has the right flavor profile, but my appetizer was chicken scented instead of chicken enriched.  I need lots of protein, and this did not get the job done.  When I mentioned it to the waitress, she said she would be sure and tell the chef.  I guess that might help future patrons, but it did nothing for me!

It says that they are open until 12 on Saturday nights but they actually kick you out at 11 no matter where you're at in your meal. After looking up these incorrect hours, we decided to go to the movies first then eat after so we didn't get there until 10pm. We were both really excited to eat there and to have an unconventional dining experience. It's a cool set up with a round grill in the table that you can cook everything on yourself. We got the combo for two which came with a free lobster and we couldn't believe how much food it came with. We started off cooking it ourselves at a pace we could actually eat at. The waitress came over and kept dumping everything on in an effort to try and rush us out. Everything tasted great but there was so much cooking that we couldn't eat it fast enough and a lot of it ended up over cooked. The minute we put our forks down we were being given the check, not asked, just given, no dessert offered. When we got the credit card back we were told that we had 10 minutes to leave since it was 1050. What would they have done if someone walked through the door right then? We were really excited to eat here and the service completely ruined the meal. What makes it all worse is that they didn't know I speak mandarin and I had to listen to the staff complain about us throughout the majority of the meal.

After 2 days, I was ready for a familiar filling meal. I frequently order vaca frita at a restaurant nearby work, so I knew what my go-to order would be... VACA FRITA!\\n\\nWe walked up to Las Palmas Cuban Restaurant around 7pm on Tuesday and we were immediately seated. The restaurant had roughly 5 other families inside seated at tables, the bar area, and the booth seating adjacent to the windows. There was a pianist right near the front door, who was playing the piano and singing in Spanish. He walked around singing to the tables, which was actually kind of awkward. Never really thought of having a pianist singing Spanish music in a tuxedo/suit. Maybe a little Mariachi band or something like that would make more sense? ... I guess it just was unexpected. Anyways, our server, Scott, immediately greeted us and told us about the 2 for 1 margarita deal (disappointing because the deal didn't include frozen margaritas). We ordered margaritas and mariquitas to start, which were delivered around 5 minutes later. When Scott came back, we placed our orders... Red Bean Soup for my mom and Vaca Frita with black beans, white rice, and maduros for me! OK - now this is where the 3 stars comes in. Scott had a positive attitude and told my mom that we were only his 3rd table EVER! AND, we quickly learned, he doesn't speak Spanish. Our order was served, but it was incorrect... Black Bean Soup was delivered for my mom and the vaca frita had black beans, white rice, and yellow rice for me. We had him take back the black bean soup and replace it with the correct red bean soup and same with the yellow rice with the maduros. The red bean soup was delivered 5 minutes later and, sadly, another plate of yellow rice was delivered for me. Scott came to check up on us and I had to clarify that maduros are plantains! Once he understood better, the order was delivered correctly and we indulged!\\n\\nOverall, 3 stars because it seems like the restaurant is new and the service/staff could use better training. The vaca frita was rather dry and the beans were bland - didn't really seem homemade. Anyways, maybe I'm spoiled since I work in Miami and can have authentic Cuban food at my disposal, but Las Palmas didn't seem to match up. Not disappointed in the restaurant, just think it might take some time before it becomes a popular Mount Dora staple."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"1605 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Named after a city in southern Thailand, at Hat Yai you won't find the traditional fare offered at every other Portland Thai restaurant. Go elsewhere for your pad thai and drunken noodles. Here you will find spicy Southern Thai dishes that dazzle the tastebuds and leave you dreaming of a return trip.\\n\\nTucked into a quiet, unassuming location between Podnah's Pit Barbecue and Handsome Pizza, Hat Yai is anything but. Peruse the short menu, check out the chalkboard specials, and belly up to the counter to order. Grab a small table or a seat along the grill and prepare to juggle dishes to make space for everything. Watch the cooks chop, grind, and saute your meal at the grill. Inhale deeply the delightfully exotic spices that permeate the air.\\n\\nEvery single dish we ordered was amazing. But the Hat Yai Fried Chicken was hands down the best I've ever had. I have to admit, I normally do not care for fried chicken. I don't like the thick, chewy batter and the greasy feeling it leaves in my mouth. But this was a game changer. The batter is thin, crispy, melded with the chicken skin, alternately spicy and sweet, and there is nothing greasy about it. Pieces of shallot embed in the breading and I swear I could taste a little tamarind. It was unexpected and completely delicious. I found myself picking the crumbs from the plate.\\n\\nOn this night, a prawns and scallop dish was on the specials menu. While the portion was small, the flavor combination was completely unique. Peppery ginger marries with tart kaffir lime leaves, sweet figs, and end of season spicy padron peppers. While very spicy, it was a delight to the senses. I especially loved the sweet fig played against the spicy sauce.\\n\\nOur hostess talked me into trying the soy-cured short rib and I'm so glad I did. The short rib was supremely tender, falling off the bone and melting in my mouth. Braised in coconut milk, it was sweet and slurpable with an herby cilantro finish.\\n\\nAnd finally, the oxtail soup. This is soup comfort food at its best. Mildly spicy and rich, it warms you from the inside out. The broth is complex and deep with traditional Thai flavors of lemongrass and galanga. I'm pretty cure I tasted a little clove in there as well. Next time I have a cold, this is the soup that I want.\\n\\nBottom line, I can see why Hat Yai receives such rave reviews. They also recently announced plans to open a new location in SE Portland.\\n\\nTip: Don't miss the fried chicken!"},{"name":"Guy Fieri's Tequila Cocina","address":"110 Causeway St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Really good!

I was surprised when the girl on the other end of the phone said there were 2 empty tables.  Needless to say we took off like Speed Racer, I think we arrived in under 10 minutes.

It was soft, not a bit chewy, it actually melted in your mouth.  And the spices, AMAZING!! The Cannellini Beans were good, but the Octopus was definitely the star . $14.00\\n\\nThe first entr√©e to be placed on the table was the Veal Parmiggiana. There were two large pieces of Veal pan fried and panko crusted topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese baked and served over HOMEMADE RIGATONI. This is a killer dish! The veal was tender and perfectly seasoned. The rigatoni were cooked al dente, OH Boy!! How Delicious.  $20.00\\n\\nThen the Ribeye was brought over, My God! What a steak!!

I'll definitely be going back again to fill my Ribeye void. \\n\\nI would have loved to see the desert menu, but needless to say, we were stuffed. However a double espresso was forced down..

The other thing that frustrated me and says that food came out they tried to carry too many plates and sure enough one of my tacos was squished underneath and stuck to the bottom of another plate server acted like it was no big deal but honestly it was kind of gross. Overall the food was delicious, and the price is reasonable this part of town and for the quantity of food to get."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great bier garten place on Waller Creek.

The relish was really good with the sausage. You can get the sausages with a pretzel bun, which we will do next time. Great place on 6th, and the outdoor seating by the creek is very nice.

We walked in and were not expecting this place to be as big as it was! There was plenty of seating and a bar that you can also sit at where you can watch the chefs cook. The kitchen is also completely open so you can see everything going on and see your food being prepared. Everything is fresh and made to order. Our food would come out as soon as it was cooked so nothing was cold and some items came out quicker than others.\\n\\nWe ordered the pork egg roll, hot and sour soup, and the wonton sampler to start. The wonton's are all delicious and freshly made everyday. My favorite was the classic crab and cream cheese wonton. The hot and sour soup was pretty good, but not like your traditional one that you would expect. It was definitely tasty but it does have a little bit of a different flavor to it.\\n\\nFor our entrees we got the tofu pad Thai, fried rice (to share), and the Kung Pow beef. The pad Thai came in a huge bowl (definitely shareable) and it's not as peanut-y as your average Pad Thai but it was tasty and had good flavor. The Kung Pow beef was delicious and cooked well.\\n\\nThere are a lot of items on the menu and we will definitely be back to try some other menu items (and probably get a couple of the same ones).

We had a party of 4 and most of their items came in 3's so that was not ideal. Taste wise, it was okay at best. The shaomai were NOT pork. Like, how do you mess up something so iconic? All their selections were shrimp. Ugh. Mix it up! They didn't have the crispy taro dish and no tofu items at all. The spare ribs were all bones and inedible.

It starts with the all but forced valet parking. We came in for dinner on a Thursday and the restaurant was fairly empty. We could have easily parked ourselves and walked the 30' to the door but most of the empty parking lot was roped off for valet. This always annoy me, if you want to have a few spots aside for valet, fine. But when you are basically forcing customers to valet, well, out of principle we parked ourselves and walked. \\n\\nService was very slow, even though the place wasn't busy. Our server only seemed to have a few tables but getting someone to greet us and take our drink order took too long for a place like this. I tried a flight of beer and liked most of them. My favorite was Hairy Knuckle. On the way to the restroom I noticed a table set up in the brewery which would make for a fun spot to dine. \\n\\nOn our server's suggestion we started with the pimento dip ($13) which was probably the best thing we had all night. The bread crisps were flavorful as was the cheese dip topped with a sweet ham chutney. Wow worth every calorie! As for entrees I was at a loss. There aren't' many entrees and nothing really stood out to me, although some sides sounded yummy. They serve veal and foie gras, neither of which I will eat for ethical reasons. The other entrees would have some unusual ingredients which were completely foreign to me. I ended up having the quail and pork belly ($24). We split a side of the mac and cheese ($10) and grilled corn ($8). The corn had a good flavor but came out ON THE COB and covered in white sauce. The corn itself was overcooked and shriveled. It was such a mess to eat, don't order it on a date! The mac and cheese was unfortunately dry and bland. My quail had a good flavor but was tiny, even for quail. The pork belly was just a thick slice of fat that was not worth the calories. To end we had fried dough ($8) which saved the end of the meal. The dough was soft on the inside yet with a nice shell. The dip was delicious, like a creme brulee. \\n\\nThroughout our meal service was too slow. Water glasses sat empty and obviously finished plates sat on our table after employee after employee walked by. Hubby actually laughed when he saw the scotch prices. He said even for a \\"nice\\" restaurant the prices were double what they should be.

This meal could have been split bc it also came with a salad as did all the dishes. The appearance was perfect so I assumed the flavor would be amazing...man was I disappointed, the angel hair was mush, zero flavor at all. I definitely do not recommend getting this dish. I will say the chicken was so moist! But it lacked the butter lemon flavor that it is supposed to have, it's as if it was a water sauce...so idk if they had an off night but it wasn't good. The side salad however was great! Our server was slow, unresponsive, took forever to bring us our check or even come back for asking for dessert. I will go back bc of the ambiance but I would try a different dish.

The curry, the paratha.... made me weep. I had been traveling and was in the city for the day. I wanted something somewhat spicy, crunchy, delicious. A place I could just sit down and be one with life. Was I asking too much? I spent about 30 minutes looking through local food reviews and this place just hit a chord with me. It was about 30 minutes out of my way but I decided to go for it. Boy, was I glad I did! I was greeted warmly and sat with my daughter at a window facing seat. You could see the outside seating from there and people walking about their day up and down the road. My daughter and I love people watching so this really was the perfect seat to enjoy our food. The food took about 25 minutes to come out. I noticed a man in pan frying each dish individually. The great love in the way he was making it astonished me because you usually didn't see cooking on the scale you would make at home anymore. \\nWhey they brought out our food my mouth was watering. I just couldn't wait.I took a bite and about burnt my tongue off, whoaa! It was hot!!! As much as it hurt, I love how fresh off the pan it was. Once I let it cool down a few minutes I took the first real bite. I COULD NOT BELIEVE how crunchy on the outside, JUICY on the inside , perfectly spiced, DELICIOUSLY cooked this chicken was!! The only thing I was sad about was that each order only had two pieces. I fixed that problem quickly. I ordered another exact to go. Call me a fatty, I dont care. Im not ashamed of this love! haha . We also had the sesame ice-cream which was non dairy and very good. This place deserved all 5 starts.  \\nThe fried Thai chicken was just scrumptious!! It left a mark in my soul. Like falling in love but not able to be with that love forever. I wanted to transport this restaurant to my state!

I've never reviewed Uwajimaya? I don't believe it. I swear I wrote a tome about this Japanese supermarket... maybe it was in a dream? Who knows. But here goes. \\n\\nUwajimaya is a semi-local Japanese supermarket chain that, when it comes to Asian markets, is one of the most well-appointed and best-stocked. The items on sale here are definitely Japan-o-centric but you can find plenty of other international food on the shelves. When you consider the trifecta of Asian supermarkets in PDX (Fubonn for Chinese, H Mart for Korean and Uwajimaya for Japanese), this definitely pulls weight for the Land of the Rising Sun. When I need nori, umeboshi, Japanese sauces and vinegars, sake, Japanese pickled veg and the like, I make the trek. I just discovered the other day that they have a poke bar for my Hawaiian food needs, and while I haven't bought any recently, the seafood dept here is pretty solid. \\n\\nThe location leaves a lot to be desired (for me, at least) but the service is good, selection is great, and it's clean. Which is something you don't find at a lot of Asian markets. Clean. \\n\\nSo for all your interesting Asian snack needs, ramen supply, and everything else - come here. You won't find nearly as good of a selection of other Asian stuff (SE Asia/Chinese) here as you will at Fubonn, so if you're on the hunt for that kind of stuff, hit up Fubonn on 82nd."},{"name":"Manny's Original Chophouse","address":"4979 New Broad St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"1st time here,Been waiting to try this place out,I thought it was a upscale steakhouse , was more like a Johnny Rockets...

I should have checked the reviews before I went. After arriving it was very obvious that the main focus of this establishment must be to sell alcohol due to the large alcohol menu. The chips were salty and the most horrible chips I have ever had. The tacos were ok but not great. $1.00 for an ounce of sour cream, $7.00 for a dish of guacamole and $3.75 for the nastiest flavored tea is a bit ridiculous. The noise level in this place is so loud you can barely hear yourself think let alone hear anyone at your table. Artwork was cool on the walls. After getting my bill and tipping the waiter it cost over $43.00 for 3 tacos and 2 drinks some guacamole and 2 very small containers of rice and beans.

First visit: brunch. Both the service and the food were subpar. Despite not being very busy, the service was slow and our server forgetful. After much deliberation, I ordered the Crispy Soft Shell Crab Benedict, only to learn that they were out of soft shell crab! I won't fault them for that- it happens. As an alternative, I was offered a crab cake in lieu of soft shell crab. Maybe it's just me, but I don't consider a crab cake equal to a soft shell crab on the food hierarchy. So I changed up my order and got the omelet. It was not good. I don't know who thought \\"bigger is better\\" applies to omelets, but it doesn't. Advertised as 3 eggs, this easily could have contained 6. It was huge! As well as dry, overcooked and flavorless. The cheddar grits were better, but still nothing to write home about. After a few bites, all I could taste was salt. The biscuit was good at least! \\n\\nSuffice to say, after my brunch experience I was in no hurry to give this place another try. That is, until one Friday night when I found myself at Assembly Row, hungry and without a reservation. After a few failed attempts elsewhere, Southern Kin, the only restaurant with any empty tables, was the most promising offer to put food in my belly, quickly. Fortunately, dinner was significantly better! Two of us shared an order of the griddled cornbread, the Bayou (gator) Tacos and the Chicken N' Waffles. The cornbread was great, especially with the honey butter and/or the jam, more of a savory relish than a sweet fruit preserve which I prefer.  The tacos were good, but didn't wow. It was my first time having gator, so maybe I expected something overwhelmingly \\"gatory,\\" but this could have fooled me for pork. Shrug. Still good! Last, but certainly not least, the Chicken N' Waffles. Easily the star of the show! This is where Southern Kin really shines. The chicken was incredibly flavorful and crisp, the waffle nice and crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. It was well portioned, with two large pieces of chicken served over one large waffle. If I do come again, I'd definitely getting this.\\n\\nTL;DR I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Southern Kin, but if you end up there, order the Chicken N' Waffles and it won't be the worst meal you've had (nor will it be the best)"},{"name":"Creature Coffee","address":"807 E 4th St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Michael was enthusiastic and professional throughout the process of hiring his service for my company's new office opening.

What can I say about this place...\\n\\n1) Ambience is incredible (as it should be in a museum, IMO). The decor is done in plush couches, wine red upholstery, beautiful shimmering curtains that can divide the space...and a piano man. Who doesn't love that!? We were told by the events coordinator that the room was designed by Peter Niemitz and that the artwork on display rotates in and out from the museum's collections.\\n2) The food is tasty...and so beautifully plated it almost feels a shame to eat it. I've eaten here twice now (not including the event my company hosted and they catered) and was not disappointed. I've started with the vanilla poached pear with bleu cheese and the potato bisque. The vanilla poached pear was my favorite...the tangy sweetness of the pear infused with the vanilla offset the bleu cheese quite well. The potato bisque was very good but I found myself enjoying the carmalized onion on top better than the bisque itself. \\nFor my entrees, I've enjoyed both the hand made potato gnocchi and the short ribs. Short ribs win hands down (the potato gratin it comes with is so creamy and a forkful along with the short ribs melted in my mouth and nearly made me swoon). The gnocchi is good, but sometimes you get that undercooked piece that crunches and gives you the nails-on-a-chalkboard shiver. \\n\\nFinally - the desserts...I will rave and rave and rave about their version of s'mores. I nearly peed my pants I was so excited when it came to the table. They were so good - though I don't know if they are only offered seasonally. Also a real treat is the trio of gelatos. I think the flavors change seasonally, but the gelato is well-made.\\n\\nService seems to be hit or miss. My first visit here, the service was impeccable. The second visit (at which we sat outside on the beautiful garden veranda) the waitress seemed disinterested and distracted.

I actually prefer this spot to its sister restaurant, The Bye & Bye. The Sweet Hereafter has better ambience and even though the menus are the same, the food tastes slightly better here. \\n\\nThe tables in the front part are limited. It's fine to sit in the back area, although it's the hotter section in summer. In winter they have big heaters that keep the back area almost too warm. \\n\\nDownside: they allow minors before 8pm. You'll see toddlers, children, AND babies. Kind of a damper during happy hour, when many adults just want to relax and maybe not deal with crying or screaming kids. It's not an especially kid friendly place (no games or baskets of crayons, etc), and there's not really anything to entertain kids, but some parents still bring them, despite the loud music and dark mood lighting. It kind of ruins the overall cool vibe of the place. Kids eating in the dining area of New Seasons or various pizza places seem happier. Laughing Planet is right next door, and it seems far more appropriate for children/babies. \\n\\nPortland is trying so hard to be kid friendly everywhere, that even bars are no longer an escape for adults. Where can adults get drinks after work anymore where there aren't kids? It's impossible to even find such a place. What if you want a break from kids before you go home? If you're not really into strip clubs, all-adult bar options are nearly impossible to find. Seriously, google it. And who knows, here in PDX, the strip clubs might even start offering childcare before long. \\n\\nBack to the positives: \\nThe bartenders are always nice and good at their job. The general crowd (the adult crowd, that is) is very typical Portland with about 90% having various tattoos, several with pretty colored hair, and artistic wardrobes. You do see the occasional backpack clad tourist, but the overall vibe is local. Somewhat hipster, but not in that annoyingly trendy way. \\n\\nThe food is tasty, though it can take a long time to get served when they're busy. So, just be prepared to wait if it's a weekend night. \\n\\nI recommend the basil, balsamic, and tomato sourdough sandwich made with various vegan cheese (sometimes it's been Daiya, but more recently it's been Ciao). My boyfriend likes the \\"meatball\\" sub or the lemongrass tofu Bahn Mi sandwich. The chips they always serve with entrees are so-so, but the salsa is delicious. \\n\\nThey offer an enticing list of imaginative cocktails, and have $1 off during happy hour on draft beers, house wine, and well drinks. \\n\\nIt's definitely worth a visit.

I eat out twice, every day.\\nOn Sunday 8/18 at 7:27pm, I ordered four items off the menu as I like to try multiple choices when I am first introduced to a eatery. I ate a side of nachos and a side of fries at the location while getting a burrito and a side of two corn tortilla quesadillas to go. As I ate the fries and nachos, waiting for the to go food, it took about a half-hour even though there were no orders before mine. Once my food was ready to go, I went home with it. Once home I discovered the quesadilla cheese to be burnt and not edible at all. Also my burrito was not made the specific way I asked. I was very frustrated and had to wait until the next day to complain to the business as they had already closed for Sunday and are also closed on Mondays. \\n So today, Tuesday morning, I took my untouched food back and the owner said there was nothing wrong with my food and that I was trying to take advantage of his business. The owner told me he is a cook, he knows what burnt is and that he is also a business owner. He said I was in the wrong and he would not refund me the $12 of the $20 I spent there.\\n I couldn't believe the way he was talking down to me as if I had never eaten out before. At this point I was feeling discriminated against. He must not like the way I look or dress. To accuse me of trying to take advantage of his business was uncalled for. I have never heard that lame excuse from a business before. He told me that restaurants don't refund customers. The nerve of a business owner telling me, a stranger, that I don't know how the service industry works, as he is grinning at me like a trickster would.\\n Take in mind the business owner appears to be about 15 years younger than me as he is telling me all this nonsense. If he is a serious business owner and cook, why is he being so defensive about food that his employees mess up and then accusing me of trying to take advantage of his business? I don't understand how I could be taking advantage of his business when the food wasn't even edible for me. \\n After he kept trying to play the victim in this situation, he agreed to refund me $9 for the burrito but not the $3 for the quesadillas with burnt cheese. So I had to ask for the quesadillas back from him so I could take a Yelp picture of them. I handed him my debit card for the burrito refund but I just checked my US Bank account online and the $9 refund wasn't even processed! What a completely disrespectful business.  \\nThe business owner should be kinder to the residents who live in the neighborhood and maybe hire line cooks with experience instead of a bunch of young girls who seem inexperienced in the service industry.\\n\\nIf you scroll down here on Yelp, you can read all the lame excuses the young business owner has when someone doesn't like the food. He is trying to deflect the criticism about the business, back on to the person writing their Yelp review.\\n\\nSo what exactly is \\"Latin Food\\" or \\"Latin Flavors\\"? I have read Greek Latin that appears way more edible than the hot trash you serve up.\\n\\nUPDATE: Within minutes of my Yelp review the owner left a defensive reply. First off, I was in no way violent. So now he is lying on Yelp. If I was violent why wasn't I arrested? You don't know what the word \\"Violent\\" means, I guess. No worries. Second, the person \\"walking by\\" was an employee from the business next door and they did not help you get me to leave. I left on my own, once you finally returned those two burnt cheese quesadillas to me. I also have no issues with women in the kitchen. Now you are trying to claim I am sexist? It just gets creepy when a male business owner only hires young and attractive girls for their looks and not for their service industry experience. Just admit you guys made a mistake instead of claiming a paying customer is trying to take advantage of your business. \\n\\nSeriously, how pathetic can a male business owner get?"},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Almost every aspect of this establishment was off putting. We choose to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday at midnight here.  The music & atmosphere drew us in but immediately after having our IDs checked the trouble began. A manager stopped us on the stairs on the way down & declared that his establishment is a classy place for adult & told us he would not stand for any boisterous behavior like high fiving, hooting or hollering.  Mind you that even though my friend was turning 21, most of the party was well versed in adult beverages & our ages reflected that.  Our party looked passed it & headed to the bar to start celebrating. The bartender seemed not to know how to pour a drink.  It took him over 5 minutes to take 7 drink orders & most of them were beers. Again we looked passed this & headed to a table, of which there was many.  Strange for a Saturday night but a nice surprise. We settled into a few tables & after a few minutes a hostess came over to tell us that these tables were reserved for table service only.  Once again not trying to harp on the negative we requested menus to fulfill the request of the hostess. Fast forward 15 minutes, no menus, not even one server came to ask us for anything, no water, no refills on our clearly empty glasses, just dirty looks.  Some of the worse service I have ever had anywhere. Now for the few positive notes, the initial staff member who checked our  ID was very nice & congratulated our newly anointed 21 year old, the music was pleasant & the atmosphere was nice but the way we were treated, scolded & ignored would lead me to say that I will never revisit or recommend this establishment to anyone.

The other minor quibble that I had was seeing the description, I expected more than 3 tiny French Fries topping the sandwich out.

I'm not usually a fan of beef that's on the raw side, but the basil, chili, onions, and peppers was just an explosion of flavor.  Spicy beef was good as well, very simple and a bit on the greasy side, but nonetheless, delicious with rice!

Narrow space, antique wood lining the bar area and walls...very charming. Reservations are a must unless you're going for the bar because there is not a lot of seating. There is a big community table in the middle for dining and small booths on another side for smaller parties. \\n\\nUnfortunately and fortunately, for me, I am with child so I could not try what seemed to be a delicious assortment of cocktails. However, I did get hooked up with a Topo Chico, so that's almost as good....right? For the two of us we ordered the Shishito peppers of which I could eat EVERY.SINGLE.DAY but this was probably the best thing we had. We ordered the duck wings, chicken meatballs and the quail for our main courses. Duck wings were really good, chicken meatballs were served with some sort of sauce that resembled that of something in your baby's diaper, and the quail was just okay. I was bummed because by the menu options I was expecting to be WOWED and I just wasn't. For dessert we had the Popcorn & a movie (simply divine) and the S'more (flavors did not go together at all). \\n\\nI probably will not go back here.

We could not remove the lobster from the shell because it was overcooked. When we brought it up to the bartender (we were sitting at the bar) We asked him if there was a way to get another lobster tail not soaked in tomato broth that we could actually eat. Also, not over cooked. The dish was described as having marinara sauce with it, however it was more like a soup. A runny, watery tomato broth. The owner came out and basically told us to fuck off. He said that we should make a yelp review because his score was so high he did not care about our review. He was encouraging us to write one! SMH.... I have never posted anything on yelp that was negative. I prefer to always be optimistic and to leave great reviews for people and establishments rather than the latter. However, this guy was such a pompous ass, that I could not, not write a bad review. I will not lie, the food was decent. However this dish, was not as described on the menu. The dish was also the most expensive on the menu! I was hoping to eat everything that was in this dish, however it was impossible. Truly! I got tomato broth all over myself trying to get the seafood out of its shell. If he was a smart man, he could have offered to give us another lobster tail. However he refused to do so and insisted on being a complete asshole. When we said we just wanted to leave and wanted the check, he said \\"YAY\\" and told us to leave.  LOL what happened to providing good service for customers? We weren't being rude or confrontational.  We didn't talk to him in a demeaning way like he did with us.... I just couldn't and can't wrap my brain around how awful this person is! The bill was almost $200 for two people. This is in Dripping Springs people!!!  I guess he feels like a big fish in a small puddle. I will never go back there. I will never recommend this place. The owner is a complete asshole. Save your money and drive to Austin or another establishment in Dripping.  This guy does not deserve your money. If I could, I wouldn't even give him 1 star.  The star belongs to the nice bartender that took our order and served us.  I feel bad that he has to deal with this asshole on a daily. \\n\\nOne of the owners responded to my post and of course is denying everything. We did not demand that it get removed off of our bill. Just to have the lobster redone because it was severely over cooked. The owner was the one making the scene by being super loud and confrontational in front of everyone. My friend and I kept our voices down because it was embarrassing that he was yelling at us in front of everyone. So get your facts straight! Also, there are many other posts that other people have made in regards to the executive chef's behavior. I am not the first nor the last person that will unfortunately have to deal with him. Again, I did not ask for a handout, as I am more than able to pay for the bill. However, when something is not done well, I personally believe that it should be rectified. The fact that you have an owner/executive chef that does not believe in good service but believes in belittling their customers is just uncalled for and extremely unprofessional. I will take my business and my money elsewhere. Where people still believe in good customer service. Again, I would give you no stars if that were possible."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I can't speak for the restaurant/beer garden, but I get their bread loaves often.

Two noteworthy desserts were 1) the Pasteis de Nada, which looked nothing like what I've seen in Portugal. Instead of a solid yellow/brown custard center, ours came in a black liquid form.

We were seated after a short wait. After we placed our order, I realized many of the customers ordered tableside salads and desserts. There was also tableside service for the peppercorn sauce (certain steak orders). This is definitely a place worth visiting if you want a food presentation during your meal. \\n\\nWe started off with complimentary bread and a side of blue cheese infused butter. I found it interesting that the restaurant would serve that flavour of butter. I did enjoy the combination. For appetizers, we shared some kusshi oysters, steak tartare and lobster bisque. The oysters were fresh and kusshi oysters are my favourite oysters for their clean and delicate taste. The side of lemon was wrapped to prevent seeds from falling into the oysters when you squeezed the lemon. Nice touch to details there. The steak tartare was very good and went well with the crispy fried dough (gnocco fritto). Lobster bisque was smooth and creamy. The seared scallop was a nice touch although I would have loved a piece of lobster as well. Scallop was cooked perfectly. For my main dish, I ordered the Bay Area cioppino which was a good medley of seafood in a tomato broth. By this part of the meal, I was too full to enjoy soaking the broth in some bread. I did take a bite of the basil crostini but I think bread would have been a great option if my stomach was a bit larger. I took a bite off the tomahawk pork chop that my husband ordered and it was moist and tender. For dessert, we shared a baked Alaska after people watching a number of customers ordering the dessert. It was neat to watch our dessert prepared at tableside. The baked Alaska filling of lemon sorbet and raspberry coconut ice cream was delectable and by far the best prepared baked Alaska I have tried in recent memory. \\n\\nThe service was top notch throughout our meal.

The jambalaya and the crawfish √©touff√©e was exactly the same thing, seriously, the same exact thing! ( I couldn't believe it ). But, that's not it, neither meal was what it was supposed to be. It was not jambalaya, it was steamed white rice, no tomato base, no Seasoning. It was more like a buttery garlic sauce , shrimp scampi if I had to compare it to something, and the crawfish √©touff√©e, no crawfish at all! I would go into detail, but I'm sure you get the picture. The gumbo...... Horrible , thick roux , like gravy with under cooked okra. The oysters...... No comment, we left before we could even got it , we ran as fast as we could. Don't go here you guys, seriously. I'm really offended that they even call them selves by the \\"New Orleans\\" name. It's really a disgrace. I was really offended by this place and what they are fooling people to believe they are. Ok, I'm done, I was so mad about this disgraceful place.

I always get the healthy chicken or chicken/shrimp over rice plate fully loaded (mushrooms, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes & cheese).\\n\\n* The sauces take it over for me. I love the honey mustard or spicy creole. I've been eyeing the chipotle ranch, but I'm a creature of habit. \\n\\n* The portion size is huge (and I'm greedy).

I just love good 'ole southern hospitality!\\n\\nCONS:\\n* Depending on when you go, the wait can be the entire length of a Power episode.

I went around 7:30 tonight and it was only 15 mins until I got my food. \\n\\n* The new place is really tiny. It's around 6 seats and standing room for only a few more people. Also, factor in the weather because you may have to stand outside. \\n\\n* The area can be a little rough (safety wise) but I've never had a problem.

The restaurant follows the build-your-own-bowl model, allowing you to choose your base, protein, and dressing.  There are four proteins: grilled beef, grilled chicken, fish / shrimp, and/or tofu.  The bases are equally as varied: rice and black beans, red and sweet potato hash, mixed whole grain and rice, and/or salad.  There are fewer options for sauce: black bean vinaigrette, creamy herb dressing, and/or charred green onion vinaigrette.

Since we were there for breakfast, I decided to go with a savory crepe. I made sure to do my Yelp research beforehand and thanks to Mariacristina R's review, I decided to try the smoked salmon crepe and also asked them to go light on the cream cheese (thanks for the tip!). The crepe was huge and more than enough to share . It was light yet hearty and very filling. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we were all too stuffed to order dessert.

Not my favorite thing I've ever had but certainly interesting.  \\n2nd. Squid ink pasta with calamari. This was very good. Best dish of the meal in my opinion. Portion size was fairly decent and had me worried that I would be really full by the end if the remaining dishes were portioned equally. \\n3rd: strip loin. Not the best beef. Under seasoned and kind of tough. The accompaniments were better than the meat.\\n4th: a salad of some sort. Grilled kohlrabi and pickled carrots but I really think this course had no purpose.

I am no miser and will spend for good food that is worth the price.

It was supposed to be able to feed up to four but for me and my friend we were left hungry!\\nThe margaritas were pretty basic. Nothing out of the ordinary.

I knew in advance this was an expensive restaurant. After being seated, we were served warm bread. And ONE tablespoon of butter for four adults. I looked at the tiny portion of butter, modest for a single person, and said, \\"Oh no. It'll be as bad as I feared. The corporate-drones have decreed that if they can shave point six cents off each cover served, by week's end they'll have saved like, ten dollars.\\"\\n\\nIt was as bad as I feared. I have to say in advance overpriced is not a dollar-issue. I've spent big bucks for great food and been thrilled. Overpriced is a bang-for-buck issue. Truluck's failed this test badly. They brought a knife to a gun fight.\\n\\nAt about $100 per adult, I expect superb. Here's the tally:\\n\\n1. The place has lobster-lobster-lobster. I assumed, the lobster bisque had to be stellar. Well, I assumed incorrectly. First off, it was cream of lobster soup, not a bisque in any sense of the meaning. And it was drab. Yeah, a lobster place didn't know how to make even cream of lobster adequately.\\n\\n2. The caesar salad was the second worst I've ever been served. The worst was at Chicago Fire Pizza. Truluck's barely beat a hack pizza chain. Trader Joes pre-boxed caesar is much better, and it's not very good. First, they used white anchovies (Boquerones) Cured in Vinegar, not the correct salt-cured dark brown ones. The pickling fought and won in the flavor mix. Second, I could not tell that there was any dressing on the lettuce. I assume there was, but all I tasted was romaine lettuce with pickled fish. Yuck!\\n\\n3. The ribeye steak was very good. I've had better, but it was fine, if it were half the price. But both mine and my wife's were conspicuously thin for a $$$$ steakhouse. I'm sorry, I do not make the rules, I only live by them. A $$$$ steakhouse serves a steak so big you have your heart attack BEFORE you eat it. Thank goodness Truluck's had my cardiologist's back and served a modest portion only. Prudent yet unappreciated.\\n\\n4. The designated driver had Diet Coke. To avoid the pain of unlimited refills, some bean-counter at Truluck's figured a way around it. Serve the coke, most unnecessarily, from a small bottle. Bingo! Profit profit profit. Also, insult insult insult, but hey, it's business, not personal.\\n\\n5. The side of hash brown-style potatoes was dry and tasted like -- wait -- wait -- here it comes -- plain old hash browns like you get at IHOP. Hmm. Interesting goal on the part of the cooks ( not, please, chefs) in charge at Truluck's.\\n\\n6. On the menu, the PRIME ULTIMATE STEAKHOUSE RIBEYE says it has \\"melted gorgonzola cheese.\\" Mine did not. Though touted to be \\"broiled at 1,600 degrees and served on a sizzling 500-degree plate\\" the cheese was fully intact and solid. It was clearly set atop the cooked steak. Such disregard for visual appeal and adherence to the menu description is inexcusable. Period. Shame on the food-warmer masquerading in the toque blanche.\\n\\n7. My wife ordered the \\"VOILA! A sensory tour de force of dry ice smoke,\\nvodka, cava, Chambord, pineapple juice, raspberries.\\" I kid you not, the waitress served it and said, \\"Now don't drink it till it stops bubbling.\\" AYFKM? Truluck's serves food you cannot consume? \\"Here's your order, but I am serving it to you in a form and manner dangerous to your health. Enjoy!\\" AYFKM?\\n\\n8. Okay, okay, I'm from California. Sue me. Truluck's serves Faroe Island Salmon. You're not suppose to support the Faroe Island fisheries because they slaughter pilot whales and dolphins. Here's one example of documentation. http://www.planetexperts.com/sea-shepherd-asks-consumers-boycott-costco-salmon-save-whales-dolphins/ If it's the best salmon in the world it's not worth eating because you are supporting monsters who violate the seas and desecrate intelligent mammals. Okay, I'll step off my soap box now.¬†\\n\\nIs my review a tad snarky? Sure. But keep this in mind. I spent nearly $400 for a lousy meal. It's the only real satisfaction I'm getting for my money.

The building looks super fancy but has a very casual ambiance. \\n\\nThe food: \\n4 Rivers offers BBQ meats such as brisket, pork, chicken, turkey, sausage, etc. It was my first time here, so I sampled a lot of different things. The brisket is lean and juicy and the burnt ends are so flavorful. I tried several different sides: fries, potato salad, Mac n cheese, bread pudding, and spices green beans- all of which are amazingly delicious and are bursting with flavor. I got a special- the brisket burger and I added two sides. The burger was very good, although I asked for no tomatoes and still got them. It has an interesting sauce on top, it kind of reminded me of big mac sauce or a honey mustard of some sort. We also left with a piece of chocolate cake from the sweets shop which was AWESOME! \\n\\nThe service:\\nI was waiting a while for my brisket burger to finish being made, which is fine. A man who seemed to be a manager noticed me standing up front for a long time with a blank face and made sure if there was something I was waiting on. I highly appreciated that, after interacting with two other female FOH employees with bad attitudes. Not one smile. Not any bit of enthusiasm for their job or for what they're doing or just for customer service. I stood up at the counter to ask for a sample for five minutes and they made eye contact with me several times and neither of them cared to acknowledge my existence. And when somebody did, she acted completely annoyed and didn't make any eye contact. The girl who helped me at the little sweets shop was great though! Thank God for her.

Juke is $2.50 less and you get an awesome Asian slaw with. And Duffins which still reigns supreme is like $4.50 for two pieces. If you haven't gone to Duffins GO! DL chicken came on a stale/toasted (honestly not sure) piece of Wonderbread, no sides. There were some pickles tossed on top which were okay but again nothing to write home about. Let's get to the flavour though. All I tasted was cayenne pepper and lots of it, I ordered hot because I love spice. But there's a way to do spice and still have flavour. The chicken wasn't seasoned well with salt. It tasted like there wasn't any in fact. The skin was crisp but definitely oily. I am so curious to taste Nashville hot chicken in Nashville because this can't be it. And if it is, I'm not a fan. On top of that, my thigh was boneless...boneless! Don't give me fried chicken without the bone unless it's a breast. Bone is where the flavour lives. I'm really curious as to why they opt for boneless thighs, such a mystery.

I ordered the fried chicken with the dipping curry and roti. I thought the fried chicken had good flavors going on but the crust was abnormally hard. It was so crunchy that it hurt my sensitive-ass teeth. The sauce that came with it I wasn't loving. The curry was good but is really only for dipping. Flavors are really strong and the sweetness was a bit much to be enjoyed on its own. Also, not gonna lie, this place was overpriced. This is the problem with Portland gentrification. These restaurants keep opening that serve Thai or Indian street food, anglicize it a bit, then charge like $15 per person when it would cost like under $2 in India or Thailand.\\n\\nDespite my criticisms.

I get Irish nachos in place of a birthday cake every year.  The better burger, brisket sandwich, and chicken tenders are favorites of ours too.  There is a seasonal menu that  mixes things up and a lot of the time they have a weekly special including the Dagwood, the greatest sandwich to have ever been created.  The rotating tap is excellent and the wait staff is usually pretty knowledgable about the beer they're serving, so you don't have to worry about a bad recommendation.  I should mention that the meats that they bring in are fantastic, and you will see a Patak truck parked outside some mornings to back that up.\\n\\nMy one complaint?

I'm a flight attendant and while on a layover, I found this place and was blown away by just how deep and rich the flavor of this broth was. So much that I even felt compelled to tell the owner how much I enjoyed it. He then explained to me that while so many pho restaurants take shortcuts on their broth by simply adding too much msg, they do it right; by letting the broth cook over a 24-hour period. And I believe it. You can just taste it. There's probably still a little msg in it. On the menu, it says \\"no msg\\" next to the chicken pho option, so one would assume that there's msg in the beef pho option. But who cares? A little msg never hurt nobody. And let's be real- pho just isn't pho without a touch of msg. I have to add that they don't offer different sizes, which is unfortunate as I ALWAYS opt for the large, and they don't have a lot of options for their meat. I think they have rare slices, brisket, and meatballs. But I'm all about that tendon and tripe life tho... But the broth is SO legit that it's still my favorite pho and I now bid for Portland layovers just to get it in my belly. I will also add that Luc Lac nearby was the other option and once, I did go for dinner to taste their pho so I could compare and TRUST ME- skip their pho. I literally had to send it back. All I could think was \\"How DARE they call that pho?!\\" But I may just have a whole new pho standard after experiencing Fresh Roll's pho.

Trust me, you want to read this...\\n\\nThe menu here is very well rounded and it has excellent side dishes. I ordered a rib platter and a pulled pork/brisket combo platter. The ribs are not very fatty, the fat has been trimmed and the ribs are uniform and somewhat lean (yeah, right), something that upscale restaurants do to ribs. The brisket was nicely cooked and flavorful, and it had some burnt parts full of smoke, and this is good. The pork was very tasty, and really, a fantastic rendition of pulled pork. The meats were simply really good.\\n\\nFor sides, sorry, no mac and cheese, but they had black beans and rice, plantains, corn, and fries. And no corn bread... hence and possibly why the \\"urban\\" label. Before I move on, the sides were also very good. The rice was great, the black beans were tasty, the plantains were superb, and the fries were just fries. These sides perfectly complimented the meats on the menu. Pig Floyd's is a place that truly embodies what this area of Orlando represents and has to offer, with its many cultures all converging at this point in time, starting with the Vietnamese and Thai influences, to the Latin food and others.\\n\\nWhich lead me to the thinking...\\n\\nPig Floyd's basically serves Latin American, Caribbean, Vietnamese, Thai, Mexican and American all in one cool place. I am pretty sure that none of the staff did the traveling to be acquainted with those cultures and cuisines.

I have visited his beautiful venue about 4 times now and apart from sometimes unpredictable or limited weekday hours and a rather rude bartender on one occasion, I absolutely love this place. \\n\\nThe AMBIANCE at Distillery is fantastic! There are a lot of options for seating, with both low and high top tables, booths and cushy chairs, couches in the lounge, tons of bar seating, and great options for large groups. Dim lighting and tastefully decorated this venue is perfect for dates, birthdays or just a nice evening out. I am huge on ambiance and this venue does it for me. I recently visited on a date and situated myself in a nice little half booth tucked away in the corner. It was perfect for private conversations and sneaking a few kisses! \\n\\nI also celebrated my BIRTHDAY here last January and I was very happy with our space and the food. The service was a little slow (only one server) for a group of 20, but they do not have a minimum spend or ask for your credit card info in order to book. I believe there was automatic gratuity on our bills, but separate bills were also not an issue. Just a heads up, they were very strict about charging $20/head for no shows so makes sure your friends are not flakes! :)\\n\\nThe SERVICE is always wonderful here. I have had the same lovely server the last two visit, Lisa you are a doll! I love it when a server remembers you, that's saying something (hopefully something good)! Lisa was amazing with her suggestions and answering our questions about the menus and cocktails. \\n\\nThis place is like alcohol central with a plethora of options: Smashes, mules, classic cocktails, shots, wine... everything. I highly recommend the passion drop shots, they are quite tasty and will sneak up on you! I also recommend their Old Fashions and Classic Martinis. \\n\\nThe Distillery distills their own alcohol as well, of course, with inventive flavors such as jalape√±o or cucumber vodka. Yummy.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nI super insanely recommend the Bianca pizza and then add some prosciutto!! Omg nom nom nom. This fantabulous flatbread has an amazing concoction of pears, hazelnuts, arugula and gorgonzola cheese. Add some Prosciutto on there if you like meat, and viola you have one of the best flatbreads I have ever had!! Soooooo flipping good! $16 for the 'zaaaa and add $6 for prosciutto.\\n\\nI also have tried their stuffed mushrooms which are massive. You get 5 fat ones for $15. Recently, I got to try the Baked Stuffed Cornetti Peppers and oh yum Batman! These peppers are stuffed with meat (pork and beef I think) and baked in a creamy tomato sauce. Grab some garlic bread for this dish 'cause you will not regret it! A bit expensive for the portion, no lie. $16 for only 4 small peppers. \\n\\nMonday's and Tuesday's you get 50% off wine bottles on tap. I haven't tried the tap wine, but it's a few if you are looking to save.\\n\\nHAPPY HOUR is 4-6pm mon-thurs and 3-6pm fri-sun. Their specials are discounts on starters, but I have yet to try HH here (on my list). \\n\\nUnfortunately, on my last visit we were rushed out of The Distillery by the bartending telling us to \\"finish up our drinks\\" which I thought was incredibly rude, especially for the price you pay and the fact the most cocktails are made to be sipped and not downed. It was only 11:30.

It should be noted that while their prices aren't great on paper, their portions are huge so most entrees can easily feed 2-3 people (assuming you aren't in the habit of eating like an effin' PIG).  \\n\\nAlso, I have never used their delivery service but always walked in and ordered for takeaway.  Partially because I'm too cheap to tip a delivery person, plus I generally feel better seeing them make the food and having them see me rather than just being a disembodied voice on the phone, esp. given their limited English.  I also think that if you are friendly and polite in person, and go out of your way to smile or wave at the cooking staff in the back (open-view kitchen), they are more likely to take at least a little bit more care making your food than not.  \\n\\nSure, the guy at the counter is a little brusque but I suspect his lack of English fluency has a lot to do with it, plus I have seen lots of shady-looking characters come in being rude, drunk, and stupid (or some combination thereof) so it wouldn't surprise me if he just has had to develop a hard front to deal with them.  \\n\\nBottom line is that it's frickin' hard to find any hot food available in the neighborhood this late at night, other than this place and the lousy Dunkin Donuts down the street, unless you want to just grab something at a convenience store.

The guy who made my pizza applied the cheese and ingredients liberally, and everything tasted great. I enjoyed my pizza with beef and onions. My boyfriend enjoyed his pizza with beef and onions (and regular cheese) also. We liked it so much we've already gone back one other time. I tried one of the flatwiches with the daiya cheese.

They also have a nice selection of sauces to top your food with. Spicy creole (BOMB!), teriyaki, chipotle just to name a few, and they give you two for the free.\\n\\nThe portion size is huge. Your tray will end up being around $10-$12 but it's definitely worth it because you can eat from it more than once, or share with someone if they not too greedy. I had half for lunch and then finished the rest off for dinner. I really enjoyed it. The flavors were bold (def hints of Italian seasoning) and the sauce was the perfect touch. It's something you realize \\"Well damn, WHY didn't I think of this!\\" first, cuz you could definitely make your own rendition at home.\\n\\nMy only real complaint is that I wish the vegetables were more...vegetable-y. I like my broccoli vibrant, and green and very broccoli- lookin! My vegetables were on life support. Any bits of life/color my vegetables had was sucked out on the grill and then promptly escorted to vegetable hell. Like they tasted good, but I wish they were lamest well-done.\\n\\nOh, also!  had a sweet tea that was really good, but only if you're the the that likes lemon already in there.

We were surprised at how accommodating the staff and kitchen were to my wife's dietary needs. Not only is she vegan, but she is also highly allergic too many things including tree nuts. The server brought us a heavily marked up menu but did highlight several things that they could modify for her. She had a brussel sprouts dish that was amazing, & I hate brussel sprouts. She also had the kale salad substituting their house vinaigrette for the bacon vinaigrette. She absolutely loved it.\\n\\n i, if you haven't already gathered, and definitely not vegan. I started with the boudin balls, which were absolutely ridiculous. Their take on these snacks was to include grouper meat as well as shrimp and a whole assortment of other amazing flavors. the slaw that it sat upon was better than any I've ever had in my life, and that's saying something.\\n\\nMy entree was what they call the Nashville hot chicken. Not hot isn't spicy but just enough kick to really bring out the flavors. The chicken was baked with skin on, which was perfectly crispy and flavorful. while it is somewhat difficult to eat chicken on the bone gracefully in a nice restaurant I did my best. The white barbecue sauce that came with the chicken was really good, if not different. I thought it would be stronger and its flavor profile, but its not a bad thing that it was relatively mild. Accompanying the dish was the most delicious broccoli mac and cheese I've ever had.\\n\\n this dinner capped off a great birthday for me.

It's ok. The breast and thigh are boneless and skinless (in fairness, the skin could have fallen off but boneless! Come on), which defeats the purpose of the NHC style of seasoning. The breading doesn't do a good job of holding flavor since the skin is gone. Then, the flavor is very one dimensional. It hits the front of the tongue and dissipates quickly. They really need to round it out and get some depth of flavor to the back of the mouth! If this is authentic Nashville hot chicken, then I must say that the hype doesn't match the reality. I'm guessing it is not exactly authentic...\\n\\nThe fries were great and the dipping sauce was pretty good, a basic remoulade with the seasoning from the chicken it seems.

We were not seated in what you might describe as a prominent place within the restaurant but nevertheless we were visited often and very much taken care of. Coffee refills were given so liberally, desires didn't need to be verbalized and we never found ourselves without. \\n\\nBefore even seeing the food, one must comment on the menu. It isn't an everyday type of menu, filled with your typical, bland offerings often over-described as comfort food. There are some really creative combinations and tasty-sounding plates, though I will agree that these are high prices. I admittedly will not come often due to that fact alone. \\n\\nI tried the french toast, eggs, and the \\"Rain Man\\" dish. All were good. The french toast was underwhelming, I will admit. It was delicious, but there was little to distinguish it in a sea of french toast offerings. I did like the syrup and definitely appreciated the bacon. The \\"Rain Man\\" was truly satisfying. The mix of braised greens and grilled veggies was filling and begging to be given the hot-sauce treatment. The baked egg on top was nice, almost too little really. I didn't notice the cheese and to be honest, I wouldn't choose parm cheese for these, but a nice goat cheese instead. The dish reminded me a bit of Trinket. I look forward to trying more of what the menu describes and I hope its more of the \\"rain man\\"-type tastiness and not the unoriginal french toast type of direction. \\n\\nIf one can tolerate the steep prices, it's worth trying.

These full wings (tips intact) were really good. Don't bother with the bread tho because it seemed pretty stale.\\n\\nThis place is known for their not-so-secret menu items such as their Fries on the DL ($10 + $3.50 for added thigh). This is the dish that I've been meaning to try since I saw it on social media last year... a mixture of crinkle-cut fries, melted cheese, creamy/crunch slaw, tart pickles, and their fried chicken.

I got some chicken tenders, fries, and tried the curry mayo, teriyaki, and special sauces. \\n\\nThe part I didn't like is they need a bigger dining area! They clearly draw a big crowd and they can probably only seat about 30ish people inside. There's a lot of outdoor seating but we are in Florida where it seems to rain everyday. We were lucky to get a table (after some hovering). When the skies finally did open up all the outdoor tables were also coming inside.

The dirty bird was okay, but I've had better, and the shrimps and grits were just not good; the consistency and flavors just did not mix well together. This would be a two star rating but I give it an extra star for the live music during brunch."},{"name":"Lucky's Market","address":"695 S Broadway","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"Ok - let's break this down.

I was very impressed with the fish section! They have a massive selection of sustainable fish and even have octopus! However, I couldn't give them 5 stars because the prices are crazy! It was $2 for one bunch of organic cilantro . My bill was $15 for 2 celery bunches, one cilantro, one parsley and 2 'on sale' boxes of granola bars.

The interior is well decorated and modern feeling. For Tapas, we tried the patatas bravas, croquetas de jamon iberico and manchego mini burgers. Patatas bravas were good! The sauces were on the side which was different and allowed each person to decide how much or little they wanted. The croquetas de jamon was creamy, fried and delicious! We were also pleased with the manchego mini burgers with garlic aioli, bite sized with a pepper on top! We also tried the CHULETON - 2lbs of neat in beautiful presentation, the meat is a little fatty and beware it comes with blue cheese. Chuleton was good but maybe not $80 good.

So i went in today to get some.  Placing the order for a milk tea with boba, i asked the young lady (not the same girl i usually get, but the older one) if the the boba balls were fresh, because if not, i don't want them..   She said yes..  Then i asked her again, because i can see there weren't that many balls in the bottom of her can, which usually indicates to me that they were probably from yesterday or something.. again, she said yes.  (there were not, i had to spit them out because they were too hard to chew)  that was issue 1.  Issue 2 was, 4$ minimum for credit card..  okay, that's fine, so I buy two of the same drink.  no big deal.  but issue 3 is what got me.. I asked her for the second drink, but to put no ice in there since i wasn't going to drink both at the same time, i didn't want it to get watered down..  So she goes in the back, and comes out with a cup with only half of the milk tea in there, and the first one is completely filled with ice.   I looked at the cup and told her.. \\"you're kidding right?\\"  \\"where's the rest of it?  I asked for no ice, not half of the drink.\\"  then she said \\"that's the drink.\\"  \\"if you want i can give you a cup of ice on the side\\".  I laughed and said.. I come her a lot and i normal ask for very lil ice because you guys pack it down on the ice and i usually have no problems, and also the drink i just tasted has no milk in it, and it's HOT.  Why is the milk tea hot!?  How do you call this milk tea when there's no milk in it??  she takes the 1/2 filled cup to the back and comes back out.. \\"this is your drink.\\"  I asked her then why did you take the cup to the back if you were;t going to put the rest of my drink in in?  It's a 4$ drink with only $2 of the contents in there..\\n\\nI then told her, \\"i come here a lot to buy this exact drink time and time again.

I enjoyed my meal from here. I thought my chicken biscuit and fried chicken (drumstick and thigh) were delicious. The sides were OK. I'd come back.\\n\\nHop's Chicken opened inside the Central Food Hall at Ponce City Market in September 2015. It's presumably named after Linton and Gina Hopkins, the husband and wife team behind Holeman & Finch and Restaurant Eugene (two superb Atlanta restaurants). They opened Hop's Chicken and H&F Burger at PCM at the same time. The two stalls are located next to each other.\\n\\nLike other food stalls at PCM, there's no dedicated seating for Hop's. However, there are several tables spread throughout the lower and upper levels of the food hall. Hop's amounts to a corner counter with window service. Order at one window, pick up at the other.\\n\\nThe menu is simple.\\n\\nFried chicken:\\n* Chicken biscuit - $4\\n* Chicken sandwich - $6\\n* Chicken wing - $1\\n* Chicken drumstick - $2\\n* Chicken thigh - $3\\n* Chicken breast - $4\\n* Half chicken with 2 rolls - $9\\n* Whole chicken with 4 rolls - $17\\n\\nSides ($3 each):\\n* Coleslaw\\n* Mac & cheese\\n* Succotash\\n* Buttermilk rolls (4 rolls)\\n\\nSauces (complimentary, though limited):\\n* Honey mustard\\n* Hot sauce\\n* Frim fram\\n* Aunt Julia's BBQ\\n* Buttermilk ranch\\n* Black pepper gravy\\n\\nThat's it.\\n\\nBeverages include Coke products, sweet tea, lemonade, water (bottled and tap), and beer (poured).\\n\\nMost of the times I've been to PCM, there seems to be a line at Hop's. I think there's only one register.\\n\\nI ordered a chicken biscuit, drumstick, thigh, mac & cheese, and collard greens. After tax and tip, my meal cost nearly $20, not including the PCM parking fee ($1 for every 30 minutes). Not cheap for a fried chicken lunch, especially when compared to a mom and pop restaurant in the country (or 'burbs) or a popular chicken fast food joint like Chick-fil-A or Popeye's.\\n\\nI admit I ordered a pretty sizable lunch for myself. However, the price you pay here is definitely more than you'd pay elsewhere. Is the difference worth it? Well, if you're at Ponce City Market, you're going to pay a bit of a premium for your food anyway so there's that. You're supporting local by patronizing Hop's. And, of course, the business sources its all-natural chicken from - where else? - Springer Mountain Farms. Springer Mountain chicken seems like it's in every Atlanta restaurant that serves regional, sustainable cuisine.\\n\\nMy chicken biscuit was terrific, near perfect. The biscuit was fluffy, flaky, and buttery. The piece of chicken was thick, mouth-wateringly seasoned, lean, and moist. It tasted fine without any sauce. In hindsight, I regret not having it with black pepper gravy. I'll do that if I return and get a chicken biscuit again.\\n\\nOne of my tablemates checked out my chicken biscuit and commented on how much better it looked than the disappointing chicken biscuit he had from Hop's earlier. Also, he commented he had both the best fried chicken and the worst fried chicken in his life from Hop's. Perhaps they've had consistency issues? I respect his opinion.\\n\\nThe drumstick and thigh were fantastic. So good, especially the drumstick. It's pretty much what you'd expect of good fried chicken -- nicely flavored and crispy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside. These pieces were hot and fresh out of the deep-fryer. I'd say the thigh was slightly too greasy, but nothing out of the ordinary from any other chicken place.\\n\\nPeople have asked me to compare Hop's fried chicken to Gus's fried chicken. I think Hop's fried chicken is less crispy and less flavorful than Gus's fried chicken, but it is meatier and juicier. Gus's fried chicken has their signature spicy seasoning. Hop's fried chicken has a simpler, more traditional seasoning. Ultimately, I think both Hop's and Gus's fried chicken are good, but I give Hop's the edge. I just think Hop's has better quality fried chicken based upon my experiences up to this point.\\n\\nI asked for one of each sauce, but was told I was limited to three, so I told the lady behind the counter to just give me their three most popular sauces. She threw in the bag: honey mustard, frim fram, and buttermilk ranch. I liked all of the sauces. The mustard has a noticeable zing to it, the frim fram is a yummy tomato-based sauce, and the ranch is light and creamy.\\n\\nThe kitchen was out of succotash the day I went, so customers were offered collard greens instead. They were alright, a little too salty. The mac and cheese was A-OK. In general, no complaints, yet nothing exceptional as far as the sides go.\\n\\nService is friendly, but you may have to wait a while for your order. My friends ordered at El Super Pan the same time I ordered at Hop's and they were well into eating their Cuban sandwiches and pork belly buns before my name was even called at the pick-up counter at Hop's.\\n\\nIn the end, deliciousness supersedes price and wait time in this instance. Therefore, I give Hop's Chicken 3.5 stars rounded up to 4."},{"name":"Golphis Lobster & Steak House","address":"1122 5 Avenue","city":"New Westminster","stars":"2.5","text":"We have ordered food from here before and it was ok...slow service and delivery despite that we love less than 5 minutes away, the food was usually cold.

But those were the days when they only offered 24 burgers a day, and only after 9pm + all day on Sundays. Only Bocado rivaled their beefy goodness and quality. Now H&F has expanded their operations to include multiple location and for me, the overall taste has taken a hit and dropped off my favorite burgers list.\\n\\n\\n{ THE EXPERIENCE } \\n\\nFast forward to 2019, where NFA Burger owner Billy Kramer is out to simply make the best burger in Atlanta. \\"The Only Burger You'll Ever Want\\" is a featured trademark on his website. Currently he doesn't have a permanent location and instead uses pop up events at different restaurants. We caught up to him at The Spindle Kitchen Cafe on the southeast side of Atlanta's Old Fourth Ward neighborhood.\\n\\nThe event was for three days, from Thursday March 7th to Saturday March 9th. We chose Friday thinking it might be crazy crowd on opening day and Saturday. Either that worked out perfectly or the event was not as popular as I'd anticipated. It was not crowded at all, at least not within the opening hour (5pm to 6). \\n\\n\\n{ THE BURGERS } \\n\\nAvailable options on the limited menu included:\\n\\nBILLY'S BURGERS CLASSIC COMBO - Two 2.5 oz patties, American Cheese, pickles and mustard on a potato roll + tots w/sassy sauce. ($12)\\n\\nBILLY'S BURGERS IMPOSSIBLE CLASSIC COMBO - One Impossible patty, American Cheese, pickles and mustard on a potato roll + tots w/sassy sauce. ($16)\\n\\nSince we don't get down into the city often, I decided to bypass the Impossible Burger here in favorite of the newly opened Slutty Vegan about 6 miles away, which we drove to directly afterwards for their version of impossible burgers.\\n\\n\\n{ THE VERDICT }\\n\\nWhile I think Billy has a tall order on his hands, I would definitely rank his double-stacked cheeseburger as one of the better offerings around Atlanta. It reminded me heavily of the Holeman & Finch burger I loved so much back in 2012 when they were at their best. \\n\\nHowever, I would've preferred my burger with grilled onions, a regular bun instead of a potato bun and fries instead of tots. I've never truly been a fan of tots, but I will eat them when fries are not available. Burger purists will love his simple ingredients approach, but toppings make me happy in my older years and I for one would appreciate lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mayo and sweet pickle slices. Still, I can confidently give his burger 4-stars to say I am a fan.\\n\\n\\n2019/37"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"In town for work and decided to try this place after a friend recommended it several times.

My friend's have been raving about this place for a while now but warned me that I might end up in a food coma after finishing my meal. The smells of all the spices in the air as I walked was amazing. As I approached the counter to place my order, I was flipping back and forth between all the options to put into my Roti. It was a split second decision and I ended up getting the bone in chicken in a Roti. The older lady who was helping me was very friendly and asked if I wanted everything in it. I had no clue what \\"everything\\" was but I just went with it and said ok. Ended up finding out that they push potatoes, cabbage and the protein of choice inside the Roti. \\n\\nAs the lady was making my order, I noticed another lady behind her on the grill making some type of tortilla wrap thing. No idea what it was but it looked liked something I could dip into some sauce and eat. My chicken Roti cost just about ~$10 for a large, it was only like 80 cent difference for the small and large size. Picked up my bag of food and felt like somebody had put a melon inside. The sheer weight of this Roti was astonishing. I couldn't finish my food but you can definitely get at least two meals out of one. Flavors tasted just as good as it smelled in the restaurant.\\n\\nThe filling was very heavy as the bottom was filled with potatoes and all that starch will make you bloated. Next time im going to ask for a little extra sauce inside the Roti as the potatoes were kinda hard to eat after a while. I could also ask for half the amount of potatoes and still be satisfied.

They are dangerously delicious because of how the sweet & spicy of the meatball and sauce pairs with the pickled cucumber & carrots.\\n\\nThe people that I usually go with also order the bacon wrapped dates with chimichurri to start. This dish is also one-of-a-kind and has a sweet/savory vibe (the chimichurri sauce is a must try).\\n\\nThe main dishes do change from time-to-time, but it is usually the sides that change and not the main meat, so I will focus my recommendations on that (but my favorite side is probably the scalloped potatoes).\\n\\nMy top pick for a main dish is the salmon. Chef Julio is a magician when it comes to cooking Salmon, and I have never tasted fish as delicate, juicy, and, for lack of a better term, PERFECT as Chef Julio's salmon.\\n\\nMy second pick is the steak. Now, you might think, \\"a steak is a steak\\", but you would be wrong. Have you ever had steak accompanied by caramel sauce? Because if not, do not pass up this opportunity.\\n\\nNow, if you're not in the mood for meat, and you are ready to throw down on some carbs, my recommendation would be the mac & cheese.

Pig Floyd's has been around for a bit now - and they've settled into their place nicely on Mills. I'm still working my way through the menu (next up: Mills 50 Cheesesteak!) but most everything I have had so far was really, really good. The sandwich & tacos menu is very smartly put together...each one with piece of flair that really brings it all together (like the grilled pineapple, sesame seeds on one, pumpkin seeds on another, etc.). The Butter Chicken taco is really popular - and you'll see why. The specials are always interesting, too, and after you've found out what you like best - you definitely should veer into some of their creative 'non-menu' creations.\\n\\nThe BBQ here is pretty solid, and although I am definitely more of a brisket guy, I actually prefer their smoked pulled pork (which always has a really great bark to it.) The brisket, in the tacos is great, but on the platters I have found it to be a bit greasy - but it seems to vary. The pork and brisket meat platter with 2 sides is a great introduction to Pig Floyd's (I totally recommend 2 people share it, and each get a taco). The sides are all pretty good - but the grilled corn smothered in cheese, lime, and spices is my go-to. The slaw is pretty good and always fresh, but I think it lacks the punch I wish it had. I'm not a fan really of the fries - but I hear they have their following, some double-fried or something - which makes for super crispiness, but underwhelming taste (maybe I should try seasoning them like the corn!? Wait...I think this might be genius).\\n\\nThe patio is a great spot when there is a breeze, but I like the vibe inside as well, including sitting at the bar watching the cooks breeze through orders. The service is average, but gets the job done (the runners/bussers are sorta lackadaisical and don't often seem to be round to help out when you need a quick refill or a napkin - but it is counter service, so just don't plan on relying on them and you'll be OK.) However, the guy usually working the front desk taking orders is GREAT - super nice, knowledgeable about their menu and beers, and downright gets customer service.

I read that this tiny place does communal seating with only two seats at the chef's counter, so I booked the counter seating (am not a fan of sharing my meal and conversation with strangers). Beast does brunch only on Sundays with three seating, 10AM, 11:30AM, and 1PM.\\n\\nWe arrived for the 11:30AM reservation to find this place homey and rustic, like we were having a meal at a friend 's house. We sat at the counter where all the action was. TIP: counter seating gets served first. We were also the first to settle our bill and leave. However, when it's a full house like it was on Easter Sunday, counter seating can get cramped and a bit uncomfortable. The staff position the seats on the side so when sitting, you would have to twist your waist to eat. They didn't allow me to reposition the chair as it would block the walkway.\\n\\nBeast offers a prix fixe menu for $40 per person which includes three-courses + coffee or tea. Brunch cocktails are extra and if you want to do wine pairing with your brunch it's $20 extra. For $40, I thought they served some incredible dishes:\\n\\n- Apple clafoutis with homemade glazed bacon\\n- Endive salad with crab and cara cara slices\\n- Beast hash with poached duck egg and pork\\n\\nEverything was delicious, I especially enjoyed the endive salad. The pairing of crab and cara cara slices tasted so fresh!

So we were on a time crunch. I'm just gonna keep this short because I can write a whole novel about this place. We basically waited the entire hour and still our food did not arrive. Mind you - we only ordered two freaking sushi rolls. We ended taking the sushi to go and I complained to the employees there and I NEVER do that unless it's serious. We received a $5 gift card - like what can I get with that, a soda? That day, two other parties had to take their food home as well and were unhappy because their service was awful and painfully slow. My sister and I were late heading back.\\n\\nSecond experience - I told myself I would never come back but came again during a calmer day. We were given another table's appetizer and it stayed on our table for a while. They just took it and gave to the correct table. Um what if I touched the food? I would of given the customer a brand new dish. Our food took long to come out again but luckily I was not in a rush that day. Our waitress was pretty good this time.\\n\\nOkay so I said nothing about the taste of their sushi so far. It is very tasty and authentic. I actually really love their sushi.

To be honest, I was concerned when I visited D&B yesterday because of the two and one half star yelp rating.  I assumed that the rating was harsh because I've visited D&B before.  Unfortunately the 2.5 star rating was not only warranted, it was actually generous.  My experience was a tragic validation of the failings of poor management, poor employee training, and poor customer service.  Not only was this experience sad, it was incredibly disappointing. Every aspect of my visit was sub-par.  From the greeting hosts/hostesses who were not friendly, and clearly disinterested; to the persons bussing tables - the tables were filthy, to the servers who were more interested in their personal conversations than serving anyone.  Each employee exuded apathy and indifference. This is NOT an intelligent business model. \\n\\nThe experience was even more sad because I was taking my 11 year old son to Dave & Busters to celebrate his promotion to 6th grade.   It was meant to be a special father/son outing filled memories to propel him towards middle school success after purchasing many supplies he would need for his impending school journey.  This was supposed to be a cherry on top because I have many fond memories of D&B from years ago.  Like most contemporary parents, I desperately wanted to get him out of the house.  Instead, our trip turned into affirmation as to why you should just stay home.  Bottom line, the only reason to leave your home in 2019 is for service.  Corporate or management needs to let the employees understand this.  The experience is all that matters in 2019!  Market capitalism has evolved to the point that customers don't have to put up with poor experiences.  With modern day subscriptions and delivery services, I have no reason to leave my home.  I can cook for myself.  My son has an Xbox One and a Playstation 4 console with graphics equivalent to or better than anything in their game room.  Brick and mortar establishments will continue to die unless they focus on customer service.  The experience (the supply) should fuel the demand (my desire to leave my home).  This location obviously hasn't gotten that memo; and if your bottom line hasn't yet suffered, I assure you that it soon will.  \\n\\nThe hosts (if you want to call them that) seemed completely indifferent to the customer.  We waited for at least 30 minutes for a server to take our order which never came.  We weren't the only ones.  Other customers (or victims) left as servers and employees passed without concern or shame.  All it takes is acknowledgment.  \\"We'll be right with you\\" \\"Our kitchen is slightly behind, here is a game card until we get up and running\\" \\"Can I offer you a beverage while you wait\\" They could have done anything.  Instead they just ignored people.  I guess the most painful part was my sons words \\"Dad, let's just go.\\"  The body language and disappointment that accompanied these words were both piercing and heartbreaking.  We were in this establishment for nearly and hour with nothing to show for it but this tale of sadness and regret.   I don't see this business surviving.  If it closes in the near future, I will most certainly understand why. My suggestion is that corporate needs to  seriously implement a \\"secret shopper\\" program.  No one should have to experience or endure what we did yesterday.  If this is the standard of Dave and Busters corporate business model, I enthusiastically await for this company's demise.  Truly sad.  Cobb County deserves better."},{"name":"Nouveau Bar & Grill","address":"3775 Main St","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"First visit, but definitely not the last.

The delivery said 45-60 minutes and it arrived within the time window as promised. The food has some hits and a couple misses.\\n\\nFirst thing to know if you order online the descriptions on the dishes are either just a word or two or nothing at all. The majority have none so this makes it difficult to see how this business prepares its dishes. As you all know you can order the same dish at 3 different places and get three different interpretations. I hope they take the time to fix this issue and provide details descriptions with ingredients.\\n\\nI ordered the build your own platter with fried shrimp, boneless ribs, and beef teriyaki and rangoon. I also ordered the sweet and sour chicken so I could try a few items to review.\\n\\nThe portions are HUGE! The rangoons and the sweet & sour chicken filled an XL size Chinese food container with the lids opened and filled to the top of the lid. These could easily be shared between two or even three people. \\n\\nThe delivery included two plates which is nice. However, no plastic wear or napkins. \\n\\nThe rangoons were very good! Lots of creamy filling. The dough is cooked perfectly with a VERY thin and light wrapper. They are cooked just enough to be crunchy and light at the same time. \\n\\nThe beef teriyaki is beef on a stick. There was a strange taste with the way they marinated the beef. It was not a typical teriyaki. The beef was tender.\\n\\nThe boneless ribs are not what I expected which is probably my own fault. Think about the pork pieces you get in pork fried rice with the red tented color. That is exactly what these are just larger pieces. They were not bad but coming from Texas I have a different idea of boneless ribs lol...forgot I was ordering Asian cuisine for a min.\\n\\nThe fried shrimp was the only major food fail. The shrimp had the thickest batter covering I have ever seen. The middle of the batter was right on the line of being undone. The shrimp are the biggest fail as both shrimp still had the waste veins and had not been cleaned properly.\\n\\nThe sweet and sour chicken was prepared very well. The batter was just enough to not be think and doughy or to thin. The sauce was unique as it is very think almost like honey. It tasted good but you have to be careful to use just a small amount or its over sweet and ruins the bite. \\n\\nOverall not the worst or the best I have tried. They have some things they do really well and others they need to work on or take off the menu in my opinion.

Our waiter was knowledgable and helpful and I was delighted by the simple fact that their complimentary bread is served with a small dish of honey along with salted butter. I definitely had a pleasant experience overall but nothing special to make me eager to return. \\n\\nHere's a breakdown of some of the options on their current $38 (dinner) 3-course prix fixe menu for Dine Out Boston.\\n\\nAppetizer:\\n\\n1. Baked Chevre and Tomatoes with black olive crisps -- This is a shallow ramekin filled with goat cheese and cherry tomatoes all baked together and two \\"black olive crisps,\\" which are toasted baguette slices with an olive spread. It was alright to have a bite here and there with the petite charcuterie but I can't imagine eating a dish of just the cheese, even with the two baguettes, it seems a bit hard to stomach in terms of richness and monotony of flavors. \\n\\n2. Petite Charcuterie -- An assortment of cured pork and three types of p√¢t√© (lamb, pork, and duck). I wasn't a huge fan of what tasted like \\"fancy bologna\\" in the top left corner of the plate in my photo. The prosciutto was my favorite, as it generally is, and it was moist and flavorful without being too salty.\\n\\nEntree:\\n\\n1. Braised Pork Shoulder -- I really enjoyed this. It's a sizable portion and quite tender. The first few bites were especially delightful. I seem to always find myself wishing there was more sauce and this was no exception, especially towards the end- perhaps the cannellini beans soaked up all the moisture but the meat began tasting more dry and less flavorful. I also really appreciated the presence of the broccoli and felt that they definitely made a difference as opposed to if it were nothing but pork and beans- gotta love them green veggies.\\n\\n2. Flat Iron Steak -- It came out medium rare like we ordered and it was very tender. Just a heads up, there is a significant amount of connective tissue and gristle in the cut of meat they serve, so if that's not your thing, I'd avoid it. They give you a hefty steak knife and even with that, it was hard to cut through. But that aside, the parts around it are tender and flavorful.\\n\\nDessert:\\n\\n1. Chocolate Mousse -- I was surprised by the mousse in a good way. It's smooth and chocolatey with a pleasant bitterness to it, not too sweet at all.\\n\\n2. Lemon and Raspberry Cake -- For lack of better words, yuck. This tasted like it's never known life outside of a fridge. Think slabs of cold, dense pound cake and raspberry preserves and solid buttercream that snaps in half at a touch, and I'm using the term buttercream loosely here since the taste and the texture were more like straight up butter infused with some lemon."},{"name":"4 Rivers Smokehouse","address":"11764 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Texas Destroyer - brisket was so salty it was almost inedible.\\n\\nHalf chicken all white meat.

Maybe he was new a didn't know where to look. \\n\\nAnyway, the food arrives quickly and is your typical Denny's. If nothing else it's consistent and I must say their pancakes are pretty good. It would be nice if they had real maple syrup instead of the maple flavored high fructose corn syrup that's on the tables though. But, it is hard to screw up eggs.

I mean who wouldn't with the 27 on Zagat! It started out as such a promising evening. \\n\\nDish one was a truly delicious wild nettle veloute perfectly paired with Gruner Veitliner and the cripsy maitakes were perfect addition. It can be tough to match soups with wine, but they nailed it. Also brought out bread that was ok (not spectacular. If you want spectacular bread, see DOC down the street).\\n\\nFollowed by the charcuterie, which was delightful. The foie-gras bon-bon peanut shortbread, with sauterne gelee was like candy and a highlight. As expected, the Riesling matched the saltiness well. \\n\\nThird dish was a Riesling braised Pork belly with maple glazed baby turnips and pea tendrils with veal and duck jus. The dish by itself was solid, but the wine pairing was a stretch at least. The char on the crispy pork did pull out some of the savory notes but the sweetness of the dish pulled out some of the green tones and the wine was lacking in the mid palate (exactly where the pork is strongest). The wine was a half measure, either match with time with a richer red with a touch of residual sugar or go more acidic.  I just don't know why you'd have to go all the way to France to make a pairing when Willamette is right next door and would go perfectly.  Simply over-thinking this one.\\n\\nIn the french style, the salad follows the main. Mache salad with a lemon truffle vinaigrette and heirloom baby carrots and tempura fried lemon paired with Chablis (2010 no less). The pairing makes sense, but the salad was nothing special and the wine was such a baby.  Not as austere as Chablis can be, but still tight enough that it may have consider a decanting (if you believe in decanting whites...and I do) if you're pouring something that tight. I guess it did make the wine about as boring as the salad.\\n\\nOn to the cheese course!  I love cheese but again the issue was the wine pairing. Honestly I find this pre-dessert cheese course to be a bit perverse. It crosses the line between a nice meal and food porn. Cheeses were good but the southern white Burgundy was simply disjointed and no amout of cheese was going to fix it. Everyone's least favorite wine of the night, that is until...\\n\\nThe Dessert!  It was a lovely thought as well. A rhubarb galette with anise ice cream and Grand Marnier caramel. Sounds lovely, but again the wine! Corked! It happens. Not a big deal and while clearly muted nose and palate, it needed a bit more air to fully reveal the issue (at least to me), and  they handled the issue and quickly got us some fresh juice. My date's dish came sans ice cream which again at least remedied quickly. My actual quibble with this dish was that by the wine fiasco allowed us to momentarily miss that they burned the caramel. The bitterness made the whole thing fall apart.\\n\\nOverall it's pretty good, and you may considering some of my comments knit-picking, which they certainly are. At a cost prohibitive 70+ per person, I've paid for that right and you expect the meal to be special. While the meal looked the part, the majority of the courses were not. We greatly enjoyed dining here largely due to the couple we were sitting next to at our table (again, love Portland) which was fun to sit with folks with a nice palate, but the meal was uneven.  At this price you simply expect a little more attentiveness across the board and my 3 stars is being generous."},{"name":"Max's Deli Cafe","address":"151 Milk St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I have now ordered from here several times, both for breakfast and lunch.

Much different the second time around - unbelievably rude greeter and waitstaff. It's obvious to me that the celebrity status of the restaurant has altered its perception of the customer. \\n\\nThere are Italian restaurants in the North End that are a) just as Italian, b) just as good, c) just as authentic as Rino's so I recommend trying them. What separates Rino's from the others is Rino's celebrity. That's it. Really. When you honestly compare Rino's to the food available in the North End, Rino's is not worth the wait. It's just as good but not worth the wait.\\n\\nWe were a party of five so weren't allowed to make a reservation. We plan our trips to Boston 7-8 months in advance so a reservation that early would not be a problem. We waited for 95 minutes while parties of less than 5 were seated ahead of us. Apparently, in order to seat more than four, they have to put two tables together. If you have more than four, it requires two tables but a group of five can't make a reservation, unlike a group of 6, which can. Very strange. \\n\\nAll I saw were two and four tops. My guess is that Rino's doesn't want a party of five taking up six seats (leaving one empty) when they put a two and four top together. A party of six, however, fills it up nicely. \\n\\nWe never ate. At the 95 minute mark, we were told that it would be at least another 2 hours. Off we went. We originally put our name on the wait list at 5:13PM. We did receive a call that a table was available at 8:48PM. It was ignored.\\n\\nOne option would be to show up with Guy Fieri.

The exterior was a little thick and there was not much soup to begin. \\n\\nThe tripe was delicious it had a nice barbecue taste.\\n\\nthe shumai was perfectly done, so soft and there was so much shrimp.\\n\\nThe ribs were very tender\\n\\nThe turnip bites with bean sprouts or a bit on the oily side, but they were very addicting.\\n\\nDeep fried dumpling with minced pork inside was probably my favorite. The texture is just so odd that I enjoyed it so much.\\n\\nThe fried shrimp was good, but not as juicy as I'd like.\\n\\nThe shrimp dumplings were done well too. Great amount of shrimp and perfect with the spicy soy dipping sauce.\\n\\nI love the chicken feet, a nice subtle flavor of sweet Asian BBQ. The feet fell off the bone so easily. \\n\\nThe egg yolk what's the star of the show. This is definitely a dessert. Keep in mind that you should keep your face away when popping open these babies. They squirt right up!\\n\\nthe brightside about this place is that they serve hot tea with your meal. Great for digesting and it gives you enough space for more! The service is not up to par, but that's what you would get in Chinatown. You need to request more napkins and keep in mind their chili oil is extremely spicy. In Texas, artist don't come like that!

Initially when I heard that Disney Springs was getting a new quick service chicken restaurant, I rolled my eyes a bit.....does Disney really need this restaurant? No. Does Orlando really need another chicken restaurant? Again, no. \\n\\nThe first part of this restaurant that doesn't work, in my opinion, is the size. The inside is small with very limited seating. In a place like Central Florida where it's extremely hot a good majority of the year, sitting outside to eat is a no go. We basically had to stalk a table as someone was finishing up so we didn't have to eat on the patio in the summer heat. The outdoor seating area was at least 3X the size of the inside area, but no one was trying to sit out there.\\n\\nAlso, (and I hate to say it) but the food here is average at best. While the menu appears to have a decent variety, it's all basically different versions of a chicken strip. Box of chicken strips, a \\"chicken sandwich\\" which is really just chicken strips on a bun, and some grilled chicken strips. At least put a chicken breast on the sandwich. The strips kept sliding off the bun making it impossible to eat. Honestly, the sauce, thin pickle slices and shredded lettuce on the sandwich were great. I was really only disappointed in the actual chicken....considering it's a chicken restaurant, probably not a good thing to be disappointed by. I also found it slightly annoying that they don't have regular iced tea, only sweet tea available at the beverage station. I had to ask one of the staff members who then had to go upstairs into Planet Hollywood to get me an iced tea. Why not just have it readily available with the rest of the beverages?\\n\\nOverall, I doubt I'll be back.

Add a star if you like crab and do to their all-you-can-eat Monday night thingy, or if you like sampling wines (they have wine flights!)\\n\\nLong version:\\nIt looks like your stereotypical fancy restaurant - well-appointed, dim lighting, piano music, uniformed servers, and has the prices to match. So, you'd think, ah-ha, another Eddie V's-type restaurant. But you'd be so wrong. Eddie V's has a huge selection of dishes which show cooking talent and are always tasty. Truluck's has a few unimaginative dishes.\\n\\nTonight we started with the hot & crunchy shrimp, tuna tartare tower, and crabcake. The tuna tartare tower was an unequivocal success, every layer was tasty in itself and everything combined really well. From there it went downhill. The shrimp was crunchy, but that meant a lot of breading hiding the shrimp, and it was hot, not spicy. I mean, I guess they said that, but if you see \\"hot\\" in the name wouldn't you assume spicy as opposed to temperature? I expect my food to be served hot unless it says chilled. The crabcake had lots of crab but not much flavor and came with this heavy unappetizing mayonnaise-type white sauce.\\n\\nFor our entrees we had the king crab and the halibut. The king crab was good and came with grilled asparagus which wasn't bad and a side of a really heavy mashed potato... which I guess is OK since the crab itself isn't that filling... but it just tasted heavy and not that good.\\n\\nThe halibut was very overcooked. Sigh. I don't know, perhaps I'm expecting too much, but I expect a seafood restaurant to be able to not overcook fish. And the sauce it came with seemed a bit strong to go with it.\\n\\nService in general was good. I was a little surprised that when we came in a little before 7:30PM on Sunday night there was no one up front; it took a couple of minutes for a hostess to show up, and then we had to wait another minute for them to \\"prepare a table\\"... not sure why that was, there were many empty tables and we had reservations. And there were a couple of times when we sat waiting with nothing to eat, I think our server was overbooked. She was very good though, and immediately wanted to bring us another dish or a replacement halibut when we mentioned (in a nice, you should tell the cook this) that the halibut was \\"a little\\" overcooked. We said no, it was fine, but I just noticed as I was looking on the receipt to see what we ate that she comped us that dish, which was a very nice gesture. Despite this, I don't think we'll be back, this was my third time going to a Truluck's and my experiences have all been less than thrilling.\\n\\nThe desserts all looked gigantic so we passed.\\n\\nAll in all, if you're in the mood for high-end seafood Eddie V's is a much better bet. But, if you like wine flights or like their all-you-can-eat Monday night deal it might not be a bad place to try."},{"name":"ArtEpicure Cooking School","address":"1 Fitchburg St","city":"Somerville","stars":"5","text":"I too found ArtEpicure on Yelp, and asked for a private couples class from my parents as a birthday present.  I must say that it made for one of the most miraculous evenings I have ever had.  I was slightly nervous about such an intimate setting for a cooking class as I had never taken one before, and was concerned it'd be awkward or cold.  I was absolutely floored the entire evening that I spent there.  \\n\\nMark was incredible from the get-go.  He helped us to put together a personalized menu for the evening, even allowing us to swap a few items around from a couple of his suggested menus.  When we arrived and entered the school, Mark greeted us kindly and showed us into one of the most beautiful kitchens I have ever seen.  He has an exquisite collection of art and cookbooks accompanied by unique antiques -- all arranged brilliantly.  Before starting to cook, we sat around and chatted for a few minutes.  I was impressed with how great he was at engaging a conversation with two complete strangers.  He is a very eloquent man, who has had a very interesting combination of experiences (both cooking and otherwise).  He is also a wealth of knowledge when it comes to food and cooking.  He enjoyed answering everything from my elementary questions about how to cut an apple to my inquiries about where to obtain cheese-making items.  His choice of background music was perfect for the setting. All in all, he's a super great guy to spend an evening cooking with.\\n\\nOn to the cooking school experience.  Our menu for the evening was mussels cooked in an apple-cider brown butter sauce, homemade ravioli stuffed with butternut squash and a sage cream sauce, duck cooked in red wine, and chocolate mousse.  Every step of the way I felt engaged in the cooking experience.  He took care of the basic things, like stirring the pot, or dropping the ravioli into the water, while we tended to the more complicated aspects of cooking (with his assistance and instruction of course).  I must say that he really has this down to an art.  I never felt like there was anything I was confused about, and knew that if there were he'd be more than happy to re-explain it.  I left feeling like I could cook each of the items again, in fact I made the chocolate mousse again several days later.  His instruction on how to make the perfect home pasta was impressive.  Having tried (and failed) to make pasta multiple times at home, we were so grateful to finally see exactly how to do it.  I can't rave enough about the cooking school aspect of ArtEpicure.  You not only get to eat one of the greatest meals of your life that you've prepared, but you also leave knowing how to re-create it.  His detailed recipes that he leaves you with are perfect for recalling the harder-to-remember smaller steps that seemed insignificant during class. \\n\\nWe spent around 4 hours preparing the food with Mark.  He had everything timed perfectly, so that we sat down and ate the food all at the same time -- none of it having cooled off at all.  The entire time we looked at each other and at him saying how great the food was and the evening had been.  He never made us feel rushed in any way.  He gladly sat there with us talking until we were done eating and ready to go. It truly was worth every singly penny!\\n\\nSo, succinctly, great instructor, incredibly educational, and amazing food!  A few tips I'd give to anyone doing a couple's cooking class: definitely bring a bottle of wine or two (don't be shy); think about a specific skill like pasta-making that you want to learn and inform him of that; come with questions about where to get supplies, etc.; be prepared for a relatively late night; and, most importantly, eat something small before you arrive, as it might be rather late when you're finally eating.  I really can't rave about this place enough!!!!"},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Jester king is the perfect place to spend a few hours on a beautiful day.

Was here for a quick brunch catch up with a friend, and I'd rate this visit more of a 3.5 stars for the following points:\\n\\nInterior: Very minimalist and trendy, overall quite clean. The front space from the door to the order counter is a bit squishy if there's more than a couple people ordering. \\n\\nFood: I got the Brekky Sando ($10) and a chai tea latte ($4.50). The Brekky Sando is on the smaller side, but I have to say, it was a very tasty sandwich! The bun was nice and soft with a good chew and the egg and duck sausage with fennel were lovely together. Would recommend, although it is pricey for the quantity of food. \\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was definitely the chai tea latte. The price point was pretty standard for most cafes in Vancouver, especially downtown, but for what I got it wasn't at all worth it. The latte was really weak and milky, with barely any tea flavour. And it was SO. SMALL. If Starbucks can do a better chai tea latte than an independent cafe, I think the recipe needs a revisit. Also, I was confused about putting hot drinks in...little water glasses? No handle? Just...why? Please consider putting hot drinks in cups with handles. \\n\\nOverall, Nemesis isn't too bad for a quick and convenient brunch spot.

I didn't feel like anything to heavy so I ended up ordering their seared ahi tuna salad and an order of seafood rangoons. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and although I don't know what it was, something smelled heavenly. Sadly I was kind of disappointed with my food when I got it back to work. Although they were bigger than most, there were only 2 seafood rangoons in the box. However I did like their homemade sweet and sour sauce. My salad was pretty disappointing as well. The lettuce was severely wilted and several pieces were brown. The tuna although decent tasting, appeared to have been cooked in advance and kept in the fridge. And even if the previous things didn't occur, the wasabi mint dressing was so strong I ended up mixing some ranch and soy so I could eat my salad. Obviously I didn't get the right thing when I went.

The pickled kraut accoutrement was tasty. We also enjoyed the salami and beer cheese sandwich. What we didn't care for and why I can't give this place that fifth star is the ham and butter sandwich on baguette that had literally a \\"hurt your stomach for hours\\" slab of butter on it. A server even came by to make fun of us for having ordered such an absurd item. (Not our server, mind you, as he was perfectly pleasant. Although, I guess we wouldn't have minded a heads up when we were ordering had the staff known that was a terrible pick). \\n\\nFinishing up, we ordered coffees and petite pain au chocolat. Was hoping the two pieces of chocolate would have been baked in a traditional way, side-by-side, to give the pastry more chocolate per bite as opposed to the chocolate being stacked so all the sweetness was concentrated in the middle.

There are 3 or 4 sauce options to top with and all bowls come with a little slaw and popping boba which were full of a vinaigrette type liquid. I was really excited to get a healthy meal that wasn't a salad at the parks, but I was skeptical on the flavor because theme park food is usually bland. I chose the sweet potato and red potato hash with roasted chicken and charred green onion vinaigrette. The chicken was tender and not dry, the hash had onions and red peppers in it.

Parking took 30 minutes and the closest spot was about a ten minute walk. Construction within the already normally busy area made not only driving, but walking to the restaurant more difficult. The wait was quoted 1.5 hours and I was sat in 1.25 hours (it is nice that they will seat incomplete parties). Though the wait is long, they do have a nice waiting area with a bar available. The restaurant is spacious and has a nice ambience. Unfortunately I found that the booths are VERY tightly spaced and the music is extremely loud. However, being next to TD and big night live, it may contribute to the noise level in the restaurant. \\n\\nWe ordered trash can nachos, cheeseburger tacos, tuna tostada, pork belly, and the tomahawk steak with fries and fried rice. The nachos were very good, but quickly got soggy as it is made in layers. The cheeseburger tacos were very flavorful but I would definitely try other things on the menu if I were to come back. The tuna tostada was very refreshing, but the chip base it was made on tasted very stale and it was difficult to bite. The pork belly was amazing, my favorite thing the entire dinner; however the portion was incredibly small (a buck a bite?!). Flavorful and cooked perfectly. The steak was cooked well but smaller than we had anticipated. Taste wise, it was very good, but for a 75 dollar dish we were hoping we'd be buying a little more meat than a bone. The sides were a bit disappointing, as the fries were well seasoned but not crunchy, and the Mexican fried rice was not spectacular at all. We were given a complimentary trash can nachos; the kitchen said that they made an extra one. \\n\\nOverall I would return to this restaurant prior to an event or concert in the area. I do enjoy the space and think there is great potential for the restaurant. However, I think the food is tremendously overpriced for both portion and quality of the dishes."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Had dinner at Beast on Saturday evening. They put together an excellent tasting menu and I loved the use of communal tables to enhance the dining experience.\\n\\nQuality: I visited Beast for dinner and indulged in the Six Course Dinner and Wine Pairing. The meal started with a small amuse bouche to tease what was to come. The first course was Hawaiian Ahi Tuna Crudo, served alongside mushrooms and pine nuts. It was a solid start with a smoky and citrus flavor. This was followed by the Ravioli Amatriciana. The pasta course was excellent and really showcased depth of flavor with the fresh tomato chili sauce. The star of the show for me was the third course, American Gold Label Wagyu Coulotte. This beautiful piece of meat melted in your mouth and the cognac sauce was sensational. I was a little surprised by the decision to follow this with a salad course, highlighted by Chioggia Beets and Leeks In Thyme Vinaigrette. It was fine, but felt out of place. Next up was a cheese course, Black Sheep Creamery Fresh Sheep Cheese. Served with melon, mint jelly, and olive rye toast it was a good transition dish. Finally came the Sweet Corn Baba Au Rhum, a perfect finish to the meal. The wines chosen throughout the meal were excellent as well, though I admit I was hoping for more local wines.\\nQuantity: I was stuffed after the Six Course Dinner and Wine Pairing.\\nValue: $118 for the Six Course Dinner. $50 for the Wine Pairing.\\nAmbiance: Beast is located in Northeast Portland. The small restaurant has a massive window in the front beckoning diners in. At 8:45 they invited in the guests and placed everyone in their assigned seat. There were two chairs at the bar, providing an intimate chef's table experience, then two large family style tables. The lights are low and candles that line the tables set the mood. Music plays quietly in the front, but increases in volume further back in the space. Warm smells meanwhile constantly flow from the kitchen. \\nCrowd: They have set times for service and the meal is done communal style. It makes it less appealing for an intimate dining experience, but dining solo, I appreciated the style more than usual.\\nService: The service was perfect. The pacing of the meal was excellent, and each dish and glass of wine came with a thorough explanation.\\nParking: Street parking can be found relatively easily."},{"name":"Machine Head Coffee","address":"1701 East Mlk Blvd, Ste 103, Veracruz All Natural","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I heard about the Iced Horchata Espresso and had to try it.

But this French Onion Soup the cook actually burned the onions to a crisp and then put them in the broth. There is nothing sweet when onions that are burnt are put in a soup.

I made a reservation for my graduation dinner with my family and friends and they were able to accommodate us in a private corner of their restaurant. Our waitress made a recommendation to do the pit master which is $35 per person (8 person min) in which you get a little bit of everything family style to try out, so you don't have to worry about what people want. We did not partake in this option but instead shared a few pit bosses (3 meats and 3 sides) between a few people. We ordered bbq fries and meatballs for appetizers to start. The meatballs definitely had a kick of spice to them which settles in after you eat it and the spice lingers. The bqq fries were okay, a good starter to share among our group while we waited for our main dishes to come out. My group ordered 3 pit bosses for 4 people, but it was definitely too much food. I'd recommend getting 1 pit boss to share among 2-3 people depending on how much you would eat. It also comes with a piece of watermelon which was very refreshing to end the meal. Overall, the meats were okay, I felt like the meats weren't as warm as they could have been. I think they waited for all of our food to be served at once but would have preferred for the food to come out when it was done being prepared. I'd recommend getting the pork belly, burnt ends, and pulled pork. The brisket comes with toast, but all the oils seep into the bread, thus I would not recommend getting that one.

I don't know what happened to this place since then although I see the same owner at the til,  the service,  quality and food has completely plummeted.   I don't understand why ppl still go here.   Today was the last straw.   I waited for over 15 minutes standing there for a table to which all the help ignored me.   Then when one of the dishes came out that was supposed to be stir fried pea tips with extra garlic no meat - - my mouth dropped open in horror.   There were \\"remnants\\" of beef obviously from another dish cooked on the wok that wasn't cleaned properly,  but more importantly there was a LARGE plastic/glass piece sticking out of the dish.   I immediately asked for the manager and no one came.   I asked a total of 4 times until we became so disgusted and lost our appetites and took the dish to the front where the owner was chatting with a customer.   She basically looked at the dish and said,  \\"oh ok you want another one?\\" uh YAH NOT.   No apology given.   If one of us had chewed into that glass/sharp plastic piece that was over an inch long or even swallowed it by accident then what would have happened,  I get a new dish of veggies on the house??

Do not pass Go, do not collect $200. \\n\\nThe long version:\\nMy initial thought when told about dinner at Gladstone Coffee + Pizza was \\"Really? Way out there?\\"  Off the beaten path from the typical town favorites, I wondered if it was the misguided hand of lady luck that pointed the way to SE Portland for dinner out with friends.   But arriving on a brisk fall night to the inviting glow of a small and humble neighborhood storefront I instantly sensed they I was in for a treat.  \\n\\nThe menu offers a series of classic pie options mixed in with a few specialties.  While they're not dirt cheap, they are affordable for their quality of ingredients and their sheer enormity.   After pouring over the list my group settled on the Basil Pesto which turned out to be a phenomenal blend of  chevre goat cheese, pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes, and mozzarella on a basil pesto sauce.   Were there leftovers? Oh yes. Did they stick around long enough to become cold breakfast leftovers the next morning?   Heck no. \\n\\nThe something utterly genuine about  this place.  From the mismatched decor to the bizarre mix of tunes overhead (Andrews Sisters to Hip-Hop, really?) it's obvious that Gladstone intends to be anything more than what works for them.  No hype, no gimmicks, just a sincere and dedicated staff that makes sure you have a fine meal and a great time. \\n\\nSo while you might think that relatively obscure pizza off the worn urban path might be kind of a drag on your night (like going straight to jail in Monopoly) it's really more like being the first one to land on Boardwalk. \\n\\nJackpot."},{"name":"Atlas Steak + Fish","address":"4331 Dominion Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4","text":"Five of us went to Atlas Steak + Fish last week and had the most unbelievable meal.

On the weekends it can get very busy so reservations are a must. I always order the satay soup base, which may taste a little too much of peanuts for some people, but very flavourful for those who like satay. I have also tried the Szechuan spicy soup base which is very spicy. They put too many peppercorns for my liking in this soup, and I find it unpleasant to bite into one. That may just be my preference though but Little Sheep does it better.\\n\\nThe fatty beef slices are pretty good quality, although not comparable to places like Landmark of course. But for the price and since it is AYCE, I think it is pretty good. I would highly recommend the pork jowl. The slices are relatively thick, fatty and high quality. The chive dumplings are also very good. I like that the skin is quite thin and I can eat a lot of these. Although most people don't like to eat chicken with hot pot, I think that their chicken is good quality as well plus it adds flavour to the broth it cooks in. I can't comment on the lamb slices but they seem quite popular at other tables and look very fresh. The fish fillet are great - soft and flaky - for people who like seafood in their hotpot. The other menu items such as mushrooms, wintermelon, noodles, veggies, fish tofu, are solid and I can't complain about them.\\n\\nOne of the downsides is that what you order is not always what you get. For example, a dish I order may never come, or I get much less than what I ordered. However, I kind of expect this from hot pot places and you can always flag down a waiter to put in an order so it does not bother me. The service is also very good (ask the two young guys for help if you can) although that varies from server to server. I haven't had a bad experience here yet though.

So nuts and so completely rich that it was a bit difficult to handle, but I appreciated it nonetheless. I did enjoy what seemed to be a Portland-specific flavor, the *Cinnamon Snickerdoodle*. The cinnamon is sourced from Eugene and the cookies are baked in-house at the SE Portland location. Chunks of snickerdoodle with plenty of cinnamon goodness...

Not only is it part of the staff uniform, but lots of people seemed to have gotten the memo and also can wearing plaid/flannel. Please observe the dress code: flannel\\n\\nOn to the actual review. \\n\\nThere were definitely some hits on the menu (chicken and waffles) but most things were meh.\\n\\n1) the tacos were meh. Could have used a creamy element. It was smokey and had flavor but definitely missing something...and the gator was tough. Maybe we should just decide to leave this animal off the food chain and let it enjoy it's swampy life....and for the ones that die naturally...as purses....did I go to far? Just kidding.\\n\\n2) shrimp and grits. The grits were lacking flavor and got dryer as I ate them. The sausage tasted like they weren't fresh...as in on the verge of going bad. The pepper and sausage sauce made me hallucinate to a past life where I was a deer licking a salt lick and the shrimp were runts. Usually with shrimp and grits you get some nice big juicy whole shrimp. These shrimp were the opposite of juicy and umptious. In fact they were somehow weirdly braided. Overall a really bad dish. They should just take this off the menu and no one should get it. Obviously a Yankee is making this....its like when you walk into an NYC pizza joint and a bunch of brown guys are behind the counter. Usually you leave cause you know it's not going to be real....unless you're incredibly drunk and desperate and even at 4am you still haven't found your one night stand partner yet. Then you just eat the shit pizza and hope someone else who hasn't found their one night stand might walk in and look good enough given your beer goggles.\\n\\nThe pork belly biscuits were pretty good. The pork belly was slow braised and very tender and flavorful. The biscuit was lost in there and an after thought. The fried green tomato was great. This could have used some acid or spice as it got greasy towards the end. \\n\\nThe chicken gravy biscuits made me wish they were really good. The chicken breast was too dry for me. The gravy was good. Again biscuit was lost. \\n\\nThe shrimp Po boy was ok+. The remoulade sauce was the best part. It was tangy smokey creamy and spicy. Really good. Again the shrimp were too small and over battered. I didn't taste much of the shrimp flavor. The bread was the wrong choice and soaked up my mouth like the Sahara while making me feel guilty about the carbs. Could have been toasted. Definitely off on the bun filling ratio. \\n\\nPass on the potato wedges. They aren't even double fried. They just coat them with bread crumbs and then pretend like the potatoes themselves are actually crispy and crunchy. They weren't. Posers. get the side salad instead as these weren't worth the calories....and your belt will thank you later. \\n\\nOk so why even the three stars?\\n\\nThe chicken and waffles were really really really good. The chicken thighs and wings were crispy and crunchy and juicy and flavorful. It was really good...and definitely not greasy feeling. The chicken were also coated in a slightly sweet sauce that was really good and well balanced. The waffle was also really flavorful. The batter had herbs in them and gave them a savory note that was really well balanced by the sweetness that they brushed onto the waffles. The texture of the waffle was great too. Very crispy on the outside by fluffy on the in.

Sure, they have beer, but they have an amazing outdoor tree shaded picnic like area that is both kid and pet friendly (leashed & well behaved that is).  They also have Stanley's Farmhouse Pizza onsite that also serves up salads for us wheat sensitive folk.  Plus, they highlight some phenomenal ciders on their menu, as well as Texan Lewis Wines, and Texas Cuvee Nitrogenized Black & Blue Coffee on tap!  I only wish they allowed you to bring your own food, but they don't allow outside food or beverages, except water.  Be prepared, you will be parking in a field, so if you have a fancy low rider car, you may want to leave it at home.  Saturday's are crazy busy, but Sunday is getting to be that way too now that they are receiving national accolades for their quality of beer.  However, several months ago they did start a outside tasting tent to help reduce the lines to their inside tasting room, and they are building additional bathrooms to keep up with the demand.  When you walk onsite you will need to be prepared to show your ID and get a stamp. After that you can walk around freely.\\n\\nOK, so you have probably guessed that I am not a beer person, but married to one, and really want to know about the beer.  Jester King is known for it's authentic farmhouse brewery committed to making wild ales and spontaneously fermented beers.  Their menu changes often, but is predominantly focused on unique sours. The current favorite that is well reviewed is this beer made from beets.  I took a sip of this red liquid, and don't get why everyone likes it, but each to their own. They produce less than 1,500 barrels annually, which is why they are hard to find elsewhere.  They do have a separate bottle purchase area should you want to take any away with you.  They are open Fridays from 4-10pm, Saturdays from 12-10pm, and Sundays from 12-6pm. Free brewery tours are available Fridays at 6pm, and Saturdays and Sundays at 1pm, 3pm, and 5pm.\\n\\nI love that this is a brewery that I can enjoy with my husband, as he sips a beer, I can enjoy a lovely Lewis Rose."},{"name":"High Note Kitchen","address":"300 S Lamar, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Delicious drinks and great happy hour menu.

It's currently the only Mambo Italiano restaurant open for business in the Atlanta area. There was a longtime location in Peachtree Corners at The Forum on Peachtree Parkway: https://bit.ly/2O1nWSe. It lasted from 2004 to 2018. There was also a location in Sandy Springs at the City Walk development: https://bit.ly/2EYM5Vv. It lasted from 2007 to circa 2014. Only time will tell how long this incarnation will stick around.\\n\\nThis is a sit-down restaurant with a casual atmosphere. There's plenty of seating, but tables are packed together somewhat tightly. There's a dining room with tables, booths, and a small banquette. There's a fully enclosed patio with more tables plus a couple sofas. The bar is huge. One section of the bar has TVs while the other faces the restaurant's open kitchen. The kitchen features one of those fancy Neapolitan wood-burning ovens. The interior has a hodgepodge of decor such as street signs, soccer balls, and an Italian bicycle (suspended above the dining room entrance from the patio). Some tables have tablecloths while others don't. On the patio side of the dining room, they have a setup for live music (e.g. keyboard, mic, speaker).\\n\\nWe visited for lunch which is served Monday-Friday, 11am-3pm. Brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday, 11am-3pm.\\n\\nThe lunch menu featured a wide variety of items: appetizers like calamari ($8.95) and bruschetta ($5.95); soups and salads ($4.95-14.00+ each); red and white pizzas ($8.95-10.95 each) and customizable pizzas (starting at $8.95); calzones ($9.95 each), oven-baked sandwiches ($8.95-9.95 each); pasta such as lasagna ($8.95) and penne chicken pesto ($9.95); entrees like piccata, marsala, and Parmigiana ($12.95-15.95 each); sides such as mixed olives and Parmesan fries ($3.95 each); desserts like cannoli ($4.95 each) and gelati ($3-12 depending on serving size); plus espresso-based coffee drinks ($2-3 a cup). Beverage-wise, they had an extensive wine and cocktail list as well as beer and several non-alcoholic drink options as well (e.g. San Pellegrino Fruit Beverages).\\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n\\nAntipasti\\n* Burrata ($10.25) - Italian soft creamy cheese, arugula, EVOO, kosher salt, pepper, warm Italian bread\\n* Meatballs ($7.95) - ricotta, pomodoro sauce, fresh basil\\n\\nPizza Rossa\\n* Pizza Bianca ($8.95) - EVOO and garlic base, mozzarella, sun-dried tomato, smoked provolone, feta, garlic\\n\\nPanouzzo\\n* Polpette Della Nonna ($9.95) - Nonna's meatballs, mozzarella, San Marzano tomato, fresh basil, Parmesan\\n* Vitello ($9.95) - crumbled veal, provolone, arugula, sliced tomato, lemon garlic mayonnaise\\n* Genovese ($8.95) - prosciutto, Genoa salami, mortadella, provolone\\n\\nControni\\n* Parmesan fries ($3.95)\\n\\nPasta\\n* Gnocchi ($9.95) - potato dumplings, fresh spinach, tomato cream sauce, cherry tomato\\n\\nIn general, I thought the food was satisfactory. The best dishes were good, but not great. A common theme across almost all the items was the bread/dough. It seemed the pizza, sandwiches, and even the apps were served with the same type of bread, and there was a lot of it. Generally, the bread was dry and/or too chewy (not the most appetizing) and that had a negative impact on most of the dishes for me.\\n\\nOut of everything we ordered, the burrata was my favorite (burrata is typically one of my favorite things to order at an Italian restaurant). The burrata was fresh and delicious. However, the portion size was small. I've seen better value burrata around the city. Also, the bread-to-burrata ratio was out of whack. There was way too much bread for the small amount of burrata given.\\n\\nThe meatballs were alright. They weren't memorable. Three meatballs were served in a black cast-iron skillet with three large pieces of flatbread. Again, the bread-to-meatball ratio was off.\\n\\nThe pizza bianca was my second favorite item. According to the menu, Mambo's pizzas are made with San Marzano tomatoes and 00 flour (both considered standard for \\"authentic\\" Neapolitan pizza), fresh mozzarella, and are baked at 900¬∞F. Of course, our pizza bianca, being a white pizza, did not have tomato. Mambo's pizzas are no greater than 12 inches in diameter so they're more of a personal-sized pizza, though two people could easily split one. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza was it was a bit too salty.\\n\\nThe sandwiches were fine (I did not try the Genovese). The Polpette Della Nonna, unsurprisingly, used the same meatballs as the meatball app. The \\"crumbled\\" veal in the Vitello was breaded veal, similar in taste and texture to schnitzel. We had the Parmesan fries with our sandwiches and they weren't anything special. Salads were also included with our sandwich platters. The simple mixed salad was good.\\n\\nThe gnocchi wasn't bad, but it was unmemorable. Decent portion size though.\\n\\nOur server was nice and our dishes came out fast.
