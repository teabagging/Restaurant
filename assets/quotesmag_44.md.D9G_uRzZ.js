The atmosphere is intimate, classy but accessible, family-friendly, and a bit romantic all at once.  I personally wouldn't come here with a big group.  Alfredo's is a dark, cozy little room with a small bar, oldie decor (70's wood paneling), and burgundy-vested self-important waiters bustling around.  On a Friday night around 6:30pm, my friend and I got seated immediately without reservations.  It got a lot busier later on.  \\n\\nYou get a free basket of deliciously fragrant garlic bread with plenty of minced garlic and butter.  It's a little distracting when you're trying to focus on the menu... not that I complained.  I ordered Penne al Salmone, alla Rita (a vodka sauce dish) after reading another review about how great it was.  Meh, it was good, but not even CLOSE to the amazing vodka sauce dish from home that I fantasize about regularly.  I finished dinner with a Cafe d'Amore, which was amaretto (plenty of it), coffee, and tremendously thick whipped cream.  It came with a hazelnut pirouette, and it was lovely.\\n\\nSome iffy notes:\\n- The portions here are SMALL, compared to what I'm used to for Italian-American food.  Not that I think America needs to gain more weight, but I'm used to, and I like, having to take home leftovers when I eat at an Italian restaurant.  Besides, pasta is relatively cheap, and I didn't think it was worth my money to get so little.\\n- My friend and I split the check, and we each tipped over 20% separately... someone came to collect the check and said \\"What, no more for the waiter?\\" because he only saw one of the checks.  Granted, he then realized we'd split it, but still -- it's the customer's call.\\n\\nI'm pretty discriminating about Italian-American food, having grown up with the best of it in the Jersey/Philly/NY area.  Judging Alfredo's purely by food, it was good but not quite up to the level I was hoping to find.  However, the ambience, garlic bread, and relative authenticity of the menu offerings will definitely bring me back."},{"name":"Taco Mac - Lindbergh","address":"573 Main St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Cool sports bar fan.

The fillings are a little bit too fatty for my liking and the skin of the xlb also rips very easily. We have also tried their deep fried chicken (which was way too heavily battered and very chewy) as well as their wine chicken which is way too bony but extremely heavy in wine flavouring.

The sandwich took their dip - artichokes blended with spices, red pepper, and parm - and put between a grilled sourdough slice w/cheese. Great mixture, great taste - a blend of subtle spice and cheesy goodness. Their version of a quesadilla was a nice in theory, but with the berry jam sitting mostly at the folding line, the taste didn't come through as its title would imply.\\n\\nWish I had the chance to try their breakfast here, but there is always next time.

We didn't expect gourmet food from Cathay House, of course, but we also didn't expect to be this disappointed. Truth be told, a couple of the dishes we ordered tasted OK (Boneless Ribs, and Hong Kong Style Chow Mein with Chicken), but everything else was very, very mediocre. \\n\\nThe Hot and Sour Soup was arguably the worst I've ever had (and I've consumed many gallons of this over the course of my gastronomic career). The soup was very thin - almost watery -  in texture, dark brown in color (like it was colored with a lot of soy sauce), and contained some tasteless ground meat (not sure if it was beef or pork) plus a few pieces of very soft tofu as the only discernible ingredients. We had some extra soup left in the container after serving up everyone's portions, but no one wanted seconds. We then had the Boneless Ribs. As I mentioned, these were fine - not anything near amazing but not overtly bad, and it was a large portion for the price. So one thumb up for that dish. After that, we had the Hong Kong Chow Mein with Chicken, Shrimp and Lobster Sauce, and Pork Fried Rice. The only one of those dishes that was even remotely tasty was the Chow Mein, and that dish earns only one thumb up at best. I'd advise staying away from the other two altogether (I'd actually advise staying away from this restaurant entirely, but if you do wind up here, be pre-warned that the Shrimp and Lobster Sauce has that same watery texture, same brown color, same ground meat, and not many shrimp. The Pork Fried Rice was similarly brown in color, with tiny and rather scant pieces of basically tasteless pork mixed in. There was something amiss with the rice itself as well - possibly cooked using too much water so it was kind of mishy and mushy.\\n\\nThe portion size was generally quite large for all the dishes, so we now have to face the dilemma of either choosing to have a very unmemorable dinner (or two) of leftovers in a day or two, vs throwing out quite a bit of food. We are a thrifty family but the disposal might just get fed this time around. Yes, it was that unimpressive.\\n\\nThe woman behind the counter, though, was very pleasant.\\n\\nI really wanted this food to taste better than it did, but alas, that was not to be. For those yelpers who think this is great Chinese food, I beg to disagree - this food is neither great nor is it Chinese.  Please come visit Vancouver - the Chinese food there will blow your tastebuds (in a good way!) - or just go downtown to Boston's Chinatown (Beach and Kneeland)."},{"name":"Mahoney's Public House","address":"10714 NW Lakeshore Ave, Ste 105","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"HUUUUGE beer menu.

We made a reservation for a Monday night around 7:30, when we got there, there was maybe two other tables.  But it was a warm and inviting space, with candles on each table.  It took a while for a server to come by to get our drink orders, and when someone finally did come, it was a manager with our waitress trailing a few seconds behind.  Essentially we gave our drink order to two people.  Weird.  We ordered water with lemon.  After what seemed liked quite some time, we got our water and some bread with a fantastic red pepper hummus with olive oil dip.  It really was very nice, especially with the fresh bread.  \\n\\nFor an appetizer, we got the Crab Cakes.  They were the best part of the meal.  Two nice sized cakes with a crispy batter on the outside, but fall apart fresh crabbiness in the middle.  The aioli that came drizzled on top and on the side was also very good, but the cakes didn't need it.  For dinner I got Veal Saltimbocca.  It was okay.  The veal cutlet was cooked well and the thick pieces of prosciutto were delicious, but the sauce was just okay and the pasta was really unappealing.  (I may be jaded from the fresh pasta I have been unable to get enough of lately - L'Impasto in Cambridge).  Overcooked, definitely not fresh.  The boy got the Special Risotto that night.  It had sausage and mushrooms, and Gouda cheese and some other really yummy sounding things.  He doesn't like mushrooms so they made his order without.  It was good and creamy, but ridiculously heavy.  Too much of the cheese in our opinion.  So the food was not bad by any means, everything was \\"good\\", aside from the crab cakes which were outstanding, but it was overpriced.

Mind you: there were only three other tables at this point.  They offered a dessert tray, we got the \\"No Flour Chocolate Cake\\", which was also overpriced but not disclosed until the bill came.  The cake was VERY rich, a smaller, lesser priced piece would have been sufficient for the two of us to share. \\n\\nI ended up spending an extra 30$ on top of my 50$ groupon, and I don't think it was entirely worth it."},{"name":"Emilio's","address":"536 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The front of this pizza place looks enticing, but the 2 times I have ordered pizza there it has been terrible.!!

It resides in a basement (below street level) of a building in Boston Chinatown.  The whole restaurant houses one large table (sits 8), one medium table (sits 6) and three small tables (sits 4).  The day that we visited during lunch, our group of four was seated at one of the small tables and there was another table taken by another four patrons.  After ordering several Canton/Shanghai dishes, the food took little more than 20 minutes to come out from the kitchen (we suspect that there was only one chef working that day).  The salted chicken was not overcooked and had just the right amount of seasoning, as good as any such dish being served in Chinatown.  The golden garlic rib was well seasoned but slightly overcooked.  The preserved cabbage and pork belly (mui choi kau yok) was tasty but a bit too salty for my taste, and it could benefit from a more fragrant preserved cabbage.  The stir fried peapod stems was very fresh and well executed.

We have visited multiple Miller Ale Houses in 3 different states and never had any issues until the disappointing service that we received here.  I took a seat at the bar while my  husband excused himself to the men's room. During that 3 minutes it took him to get back to the bar, my presence went unnoticed. Giving the bar maid the benefit of the doubt for being the only one catering to the bar, we gave her a little more time to get to us. After 10 more minutes and watching her approach 2 other pattrons that sat at he bar After our arrival, we began to feel a bit ignored... Purposefully. It was only after a gentleman decided to sit damn near right next to my husband, did the bar maid ask if she could help us. Total time lapse, 17 minutes. If the gentleman hadn't chosen to sit near us,  how much longer would  it have taken???. No \\"I'm sorry for your wait\\" nothing. Other pattrons were greeted promptly with a smile.  She even told them her name,  we got \\"Can I help you?\\".  My husband wanted to leave,  I needed a drink after the experience so I convinced him to order just 1drink. We were also ignored when it came time for her to take our reciept with payment. Sat another 10 minutes for that.  No tip and a discussion with the manager before we left.

Usually we go to Mikado Sushi located about a mile from our home. If you live in the Hunter's Creek area you should check it out and feel free to read my review. But, I digress.\\n\\nAbout a week ago my oldest son thought he would purchase a discount coupon and take me out to lunch for a change. Bad news is that the offer started on the 31 of July, and he had to work that day. Today is the 30th of July, so, it's off to Sushi Katana and dad would cover the bill. As I looked up the restaurant on Yelp I saw that another Elite, Tom B, has visited a number of times and written a great review! I trust Tom's judgment and said \\"if Tom likes it, then I'll like it as well.\\" Sure enough, this was absolutely true!\\n\\nWe arrived about 3Pm and were greeted by the server Ken. He was quite helpful and suggested some really cool stuff like the Spicy Edamame for my Son Michael. I noticed that Tom had had a special wine when he visited so, I wanted one as well. Ken didn't disappoint! He hooked me up with a chilled sake at $5 a glass. It was quite strong so I only had one. But, boy was it perfect for the meal. We added a Gyoza for David and a Seafood Osumashi Soup, that was AMAZING,  for me, and appetizers were on the way.\\n\\nThen the real fun began. I read another Yelper talking about this thing called a Chirashi. I didn't know what it was but boy did it sound yummy. If you didn't know: Chirashi sushi, meaning scattered sushi, is a style of sushi where as many as 9 sashimi toppings are placed in a bowl over a bed of sushi rice. Care is given to the presentation; placing the items just so, adding shiso, daikon, or whatever garnishes are chosen, and making the dish as attractive as possible. Think 'work of art' and you will get the idea. The first experience when you are served chirashi sushi is the presentation, the second is the eating!\\n\\nThis place doesn't disappoint. Combined with a tasty salad with homemade ginger dressing, my meal was both filling and fantastic! I was quite sad because I remembered that the Yelper that had mentioned the dish forgot to take a picture to post because the dish looked so yummy, he dug right in. Well people, I'm guilty as well. After I took my first couple of bites I remembered that I wanted to take a pic of the dish. But, by then I had already started in and, well, nom nom nomm nom! So, will someone with more self control than my fellow Yelper and I take a picture so the rest of the World can see this work of art?\\n\\nMy son David had the Mexican Roll and the Millennium Roll. Both were quite delicious and David pointed out how the Mexican Roll was done just perfectly with the seaweed on the outside instead of the inside as many other places do. I had one of each of his rolls and I found the Mexican Roll to be a bit heavy on the cream cheese side for me. But, hey, David loved it and that boy knows his sushi!\\nMy Son Michael had the Arizona Roll and Dynamite Hamachi. I also had one of each of his rolls and found them to be fresh and perfect! We took home a Mexican Roll for my lovely wife. She seems to have liked it because, 1. she didn't offer me any. and 2. It was gone within the first 10 minutes of me arriving home with it for her. That lady also loves her sushi!\\n\\nThe entire meal ran less than $100 and was worth every penny. We'll certainly be back to Sushi Katana after the 31st of July to enjoy that coupon. A big thumbs up to the server Ken and a big thanks to my fellow Yelper tom. I think I'm going to have to agree with Tom that Sushi Katana is one of the best places for sushi in Orlando!"},{"name":"AJ's Kitchen","address":"162 Lowell St","city":"Wilmington","stars":"4","text":"I went to Aj's today to attempt the \\"Godfather Challenge\\".

Of course, I couldn't pass that up!\\n\\nA very nice portion for $6.50, and a colorful presentation! I really enjoyed the salad. The chicken was moist, and their hot sauce was basically a kicked-up Buffalo wing sauce. Good heat here. The vegetables were fresh. The shredded carrots added a nice texture and sweetness to the salad. The onion provided a nice bite and crunch to the meal. When I tried the blue cheese crumbles and dressing were not overpowering with the chicken and veggies. Classic combination with the wing sauce, no doubt about it.\\n\\nI personally loved the Hella Hot sauce. The smokiness of the ground-up Ghost peppers packed a real nice punch. After a few bites, my tongue was tingling pretty good and the \\"eye sweats\\" were noticeable on my face. Trust me, I was enjoying it!\\n\\nI guess if I had any real criticisms here, it would probably be to have more chicken.

My father typically cooks a large feast for the family on Thanksgiving, but this year he decided to patronize Busy Bee and order a few of their sides and the Cajun fried turkey. He pre paid around $400 for three pans of side items and the turkey with a pick up time of 5:30 the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I arrived at 2:00 thinking that I may be able to pick up the food earlier, but was told to return at the pick up time as the food was not ready yet. I showed up at 5:15 expecting to wait a few moments for my food. I unfortunately spent the next hour along with several other patrons waiting for my food. At 5:45 I overheard the man next to me say that he's been waiting since 3:00 for his food. There was not much communication from the staff as to what the hold up was so I pretty much sat there completely unaware of when I would receive my items. Finally around 6:15, my name was called to get my food. I was then informed that my sides were ready to go, but there would be a 2.5 hour wait for my fried turkey. I was given the option to wait or have the turkey delivered that evening to my family's house in Lilburn. I took my sides under the impression that my turkey would be delivered that evening. My father received a phone call the next morning at 12:15 am from the delivery driver asking if it was okay to have the turkey delivered Thanksgiving morning. We never heard back from anyone. The turkey was never delivered. We have not heard back from anyone at Busy Bee since. Needless to say, I will never use their catering service again, and I'd like the business to make this situation right."},{"name":"Maudie‚Äôs Hacienda","address":"9911 Brodie Ln, Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Our favorite tex Mex place around.

Surprised to see only one bartender working at the bar, which was full and very large...but she held it down.  Took a few minutes to get a beer, but she was very polite and helpful once she got to me.  The place seemed pretty decent but my only complaint was with the wait staff.  I was sitting at the last seat, which was a few feet from the area where the wait staff gets drinks from the bar and brings empties.  So one of them apparently brings someones nasty empty plate and drops it almost directly in front of me and leaves.  I wait for someone to eventually take it away, and they don't.  In fact a server (Tim) goes about organizing the server area and actually pushes the plate further in front of me. So now I have someone else's nasty seafood plate right in the area where I would be resting my arm.  I grab a napkin and push it as far away as I can, and still no one takes it.  It probably sat there for over 20 minutes before the bar shift changed and the new bartender (Elizabeth) immediately took it away. She deserves some kudos for that. Maybe a note to the staff there to help out your bartenders if they are swamped.

The bar area where we waited to be seated was comfortable and they came around with a number of appetizers which were delicious. \\n\\nI thought the best part of the meal was the lamb lollipops, as recommended by everyone else; the creamy curry that came with them was great. The sablefish and goat were also excellent, both with unique curries that came with them. Naan was delicious and you got as much as you want, but make sure you don't fill up on this. There's too much other delicious food to try!\\n\\nService was excellent and fast, though it was a little strange that all of the wait staff were blond women. But that's just a picky thing. Dinner is meant to be shared, so 3-6 people with similar tastes in food is probably best. Larger groups or picky individuals might be tough here. \\n\\nWould absolutely recommend Vij's.

They ordered the chef's special which happened to be two 4 oz. filets wrapped in bacon served over mashed sweet potatoes.  It looked great and seemed to be very pleasing to them.\\n\\nI went for the fish and sadly was disappointed in the flavor and the overall dish.  The saving grace were the sides.  Our table opted for the mac & cheese, smashed potatoes and the glazed carrots.  Each item had been prepared with care and precision because they were all mouth-watering. \\n\\nAs was the dessert.  It was the best $10.50 I've spent on dessert in my life!  I went with the Chocolate Lava Cake and had to be restrained from licking the plate.  It takes an extra few minutes to cook so place your order sooner than later.  But when it arrives it is warm on the outside and full of lava-goodness on the inside.  It comes with just the right amount of ice cream to cut the sweetness and a few raspberries for color.  This is the type of dessert that all other desserts should strive to be -- perfect.\\n\\nOur server was also a highlight of our trip.  She knew the menu, was attentive but not pushy and made sure we had everything we needed for a great meal.  I would recommend Fleming's on her service alone.\\n\\nParking is a bit challenging on a busy night so the Valet might be your best bet.

I've had really friendly funny servers, sort of blah ones, and one just downright weird server. I've been here when it's packed and when it's dead, and the wait time is actually pretty similar. Not sure if it's the kitchen staff being slow or if this is intentional, to give you time to talk and take in the decor. \\nSpeaking of which, that's one of the best parts of this place. There's tons of interesting stuff to look at. I notice something new every time. And if it's your first time, definitely check out the bathroom (unless you have a weak heart or bladder control issues). \\nThe drinks aren't their strongest menu items, but they're far from bad, just somewhat forgettable.

So, between that, the menu, and the overall quirkiness of the place, Rimsky's can be great for either a romantic late night date, or a fun spot to check out with friends.

My next visit I placed my order in drive-thru.   When I got to the window Rebecca was working and remember the incident but now refused not only to not refund me but also not apply a credit to my now order.   She said she was throwing my food out that was made.  I asked for a manager.   In the meantime she made me wait and since I couldn't go in the store I had no options.  A man behind me proceeded to pound and kick my car.  Tried to break the locks to get in.  Called me many names and blocking me by standing in front of my car.   This went on for several minutes.  The manager came to the window(Alex) who very professionally handled the situation.  He asked Rebecca why she didn't refund me and prevent this crime against me.  She instead let it escalate and celebrated the actions of this man who was threatening me.  Alex suggested I call the police.   I called the police and got the plates on the car of the man.  Meanwhile, I do not understand the level of mental capacity of Rebecca.  Rebecca can't figure out simple logic.  The fact that she didn't give me my food the first time and refused to at a minimum credit me demonstrates her level of competence.

After about 25 minutes the front desk person came and took our drink orders (I think because she heard us complaining).  25 minutes later, I get my drink, but they tell my husband they are out of the beer he ordered. He opted not to order something else and they disappear again.  We had planned on ordering food, but after an additional 20 minutes with no one showing up I began to rethink it.  Then, I noticed a \\"service\\" button on the computerized scoring thing (the only upgrade to the bowling equipment that appears to have been made since it was Suburban Lanes).  So, I go up to the server, who had been standing at the computer pretty much the entire time we were there, and ask her if the service button is for food service or for service of the lane itself.  She replies, \\"I'm not really familiar with how it works.\\"  She apologized and asked if we wanted anything.  I had had it by then and said no.  We still had to ask for our check sometime later and it still had a charge for the beer my husband never got.  They did remove the charge.

They were both very tasty and had a light sweetness to them- perfect Southern, all dinner rolls should have a bit of sugar. Another bonus once we all had dinner (and some had dessert, but I could fit another bite) our check came WITH INDIVIDUAL SPOONFULS OF CHOCOLATE GANACHE ICING/BROWNIE BATTER TYPE STUFF!!! Huzzah! It was awesomeness on a spoon. \\n\\nI will be headed back soon for the Cincinnati style Chili- I love this back home (in Louisville) and am curious how they prepare it here.

The fact that Roosters is a chain restaurant is also pretty awesome. They have the biggest drum wings i've ever seen. Size matters and so does taste, Roosters' wings have both.\\n\\nThe best things about Roosters is their Monday half-off wings deal. This applies to both their bone-in and boneless wings. It comes out to slightly under 60 cents per wing with tax. I would definitely recommend the bone-in wings, as they are more flavorful and moist.\\n\\nMy go-to flavors are the Carolina Gold (sweet BBQ) and Donkey (hot). Their Garlic wings are also decent. Roosters has a pretty average selection of draft beer, so there's really nothing to write home about.\\n\\nThis Olentangy Road location is closest to me.

I find the concept to be very flexible, inviting and fun. Basically, it's a design your own bowl, from the \\"style\\" (Asian sauces), to the base ingredient (4 choices), to the fresh roasted vege toppings to the final addition of meat/tofu/vege.  This allows you to design around your mood, desire for spice and you can keep it healthy if it's that kind of day.  \\n\\nFor $8-10, you get several distinctive flavors in the bowl and a nice variety of food. I've made several visits and simply feel this is a very nice value for the complexity and variety of the food.  And... I'm not easy to please.  Service is very attentive, though you order at the counter. I'd much rather have a bowl of this tasty and unique food than another hamburger, pizza or chicken wings.  Not to mention, this is not the kind of food I can replicate at home so it's a nice inexpensive outing for a nice bite.\\n\\nBtw, a few reviewers gave mediocre ratings.  But it seems this was often heavily influenced by the change in the restaurant concept (July '14).  Apparently these folks enjoyed and were accustomed to the older concept (Doc Chey's). But the text of these reviews often speaks favorably of the food itself.

I wanted to go somewhere lively (but not trashy) before we went out to the bars for my bachelorette.  Mark - the assistant manager/patio bartender made our entire night.  I included my future mother-in-law & mother in the dinner plans before our bar hop  so I didn't want to go somewhere like Pete's Piano Bar just yet.  My socialite coworkers recommended this and Moonshine but Moonshine doesn't take reservations so we opted for Ranch 616. We showed up 10 minutes after our 7:30pm Saturday night reservation thinking it wouldn't be a big deal. They made us stand in the middle of the restaurant basically (not much bar space) and said the people at \\"our\\" table on the patio already paid the bill but are just sitting there talking and there wasn't anything they could do about it.  So we stood there for 10 minutes awkwardly.  (NFL playoff game was in overtime and they wanted to watch the end, okay understandable)  Finally they let us go to the patio and sit near the cozy fire pit (our feet were killing us after the walk we had from The Driskell over there)....a little annoyed 5-10 later they finally seated us........but every other aspect of the night was beyond perfect.\\n\\nImmediately we got waters & fire in the hole shots from the outdoor bartender, no one ordered them...so we assumed it was to make up for the wait! How sweet. They were amazing too, not sugary/gross/girly shots.  Everyone's cocktails were amazing, unique, well prepared (and strong).  We got appetizers (fried oysters were to die for) but all were good.  Every single person went on and on about how I picked the best place for dinner (because of how good the food was - especially the mashed potatoes) when I had never even been there!  I got the divorced quail and it was good but I tried my friend's beef tenderloin & it was again, to die for good.  Half way through the meal our waiter brought us another complimentary round of Fire in the Hole shots! I mean, wow, I was happy after the 1st round.  I also had a brush fire cocktail that was spicy, unique and now my favorite cocktail.  When we were about done eating I overheard the bartender/patio manager ask my mom & future MIL if we wanted an inappropriate dessert.  They both said YES! without a second of hesitation.  A banana & 2 scoops of ice cream covered in chocolate and whipped cream arrived and my group yelled at me to eat it.  It was hilarious! Everyone on the patio got a kick out of the dessert & it was a good crowd out there.  It was a chilly/windy night in January but the patio was perfect with the fire pit and plastic hangings. Atmosphere was a lot of fun too. Cons- It was VERY loud and we had to yell to hear almost the entire night....but we were looking for a hopping place for a girls night out (not a intimate romantic date lol) so it worked for us.  I agree with the other reviewers you MUST have a reservation.  I will definitely go back, probably with my mother-in-law as she is still talking about the food :)  \\n\\nLastly - before we left Mark gave us a list of the classy/fun bars on West 6th street since none of us had been out in Austin before.  We went to all of them and had a fantastic night.  Way to go above and beyond with your customers!

I would recommend going in a group and splitting a bunch of plates since you'll want to try a bunch of different things and there are so many options on the menu! Each of us ordered 2 dishes, and between the 4 of us, it ended up leaving us the right amount of full. I would say that a few of the dishes were mind-blowing (Spanish chorizo, the fried potatoes, and the beef short ribs), a couple were pretty good (sunchoke salad, olives, and escolar which was essentially Spanish sushi), and a couple were disappointing (mushrooms-- kind of lemony?, pork belly -- SO SAD this was not tender and had a weird sauce, the flank steak with chimichurri -- tasted a little bit burnt on the edges and the chimichurri sauce was not as good as I've remembered from other Brazilian restaurants).

I pride myself on knowing Thai food as I've been to Thailand over 40 times. I was a little skeptical as I expected a less traditional place. However, the plates we shared were pretty authentic. We had the papaya salad (som tum) it was authentic and ok. I normally eat mine very spicy but wife needs less heat than me. If you like spicy order two or three. A One had relatively no heat. We ate the jungle beef I've never had this in Thailand. It was good the sauce is a must and even had some decent heat. We also had the druken noodle (MaMa style) basically a ramen noodle style. Wok fried with chicken and veggies. I have it quite often in Thailand super spicy. Since this was the first time the wife had it I toned it down. She said it was just enough heat for her. We chased everything down with some sticky rice. If you're not familiar with sticky rice I strongly recommend it. It will come served in a bamboo container to keep it warm. Simply reach in and grab a small amount. Roll it into a ball and use to dip in any of the sauces/juices or along with one of your protiens.\\nI highly reccommend you try this restaraunt.

My client recommended this place after I told her I was looking for a new mom n pop in the I-4 area around Winter Park, College Park, Downtown area. I started with the Turkish red wine which was really smooth. The puffed bread was super light compared to pita which I usually have when I order Mediterranean food. We ordered the hummus, yogurt sauce and taboule...and everything was so fresh and flavorful. We ordered a combo platter to share with shaved lamb, lamb shish, chicken shish, and another chicken option. My fave were the shaved lamb and chicken shish. Everything was seasoned perfectly including the rice. It came with cucumber tomato salad and more yogurt sauce. My boyfriend's daughter ordered the equivalent of Turkish pizza with salad drizzled in olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper. She is not easy to please but really enjoyed it. Overall...total winner. The decor is cute and cozy and the restaurant is very clean. We will be repeat clients for sure!

The grounds and restaurant are beautiful, and the ambiance is fantastic. However, our brunch was seriously lacking. For $72 dollars per person it's certainly an upscale brunch, but for that price you also expect upscale service. Our waitress came by initially to bring us a round of mimosas (included in the brunch price), but then disappeared for the remainder of the meal. Nothing was cleared from our table, no drinks were re filled. Finally we were able to flag her down and ask for our check. SO, you can imagine my surprise when our brunch was 300 dollars for three people, which included a mandatory gratuity of TWENTY TWO PERCENT. 50 dollar gratuity for a waitress who completely ignored our existence. I get that they just re opened and are maybe working out kinks, but seeing that crazy gratuity included for absolutely nothing really left a sour taste in my mouth. 15 or 18 percent would be good service, and would allow patrons the option to add more on top for outstanding service...but 22 percent automatically added for zero service is unacceptable"},{"name":"Banzai Sushi & Grill","address":"3914 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here yesterday and got a spicy tuna roll and some dancing something roll to go.

Still up for debate.\\nOverall, the staff have always been very polite and helpful.  When questions asked of the menu, answers are given or found out.  I do feel picky about asking where there food is sourced, but the waiter did tell us that they were proud to try to be as local as possible.  Love the space and ease of parking in the cinema garage across the street.  The space is modern with a wonderful view of the courtyard at Director park - lively scene at night.\\nNow to the food - we had six of us so I will touch on some the selections.  The Foie Gras served whole and grilled was fantastic as always.  The oysters from Netarts were perfectly cleaned and served with a wonderful and not overpowering mignonette which let the sweetness of the oysters shine - one of the best mignonette I have had in Portland.  The beet salad with Troutdale produced beets was nice, clean and fresh with a perfect test of earthiness.\\nEntrees - duck superb, but could have had the fat a little more rendered - just picky that way.  Scallops - simple, fresh and cooked perfectly. Rib eye steak, painted hills, was a little on the thin side for me, and slightly med rare to medium, and definitely had rested too long because it was Luke warm when it got to me - also it came with fiddleheads which could be left off this plate.\\nOverall, it is a place I would recommend, they just really need to define their cuisine and go for it.\\n\\nFood:  34/40\\nAtmosphere/ambience/decor: 17/20 - primarily because the bathroom is a journey to get too.\\nService/staff: 19/20 - like the manager making the rounds and checkin in\\nValue:   17/20 \\nTotal:  87/100"},{"name":"Goldies Pizza & Beer Lounge","address":"605 W Pender Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Something in its name... \\"Goldies\\", perhaps?

I've learned that on Yelp I should always give a little more weight to the 2-3 star ratings; as they seem more accurate to my own experience.  This place was no different.\\n\\nHere is what you should know:\\n\\nThe pie is $4.75 per slice, $2 for ala mode.  We had to ask, because with all the chalkboards written with useless information - you will find no pie prices posted anywhere.  This should have been my first clue.\\n\\nDrip Coffee is $2.25 per cup; a refill is $1!  Really?  Isn't this a coffee house/bakery?  No free refills on coffee?  I took away big points for this.  The cashier didn't tell us when we purchased two cups.  Had she told us, we wouldn't have gotten it.\\n\\nIn a town with coffee shops serving up great coffee with free refills on every corner - it's actually shameful.\\n\\nPie is good; but really just above average.  We had the cherry, peach and caramel apple. Apple was probably the best of the three - but none was worth the high price tag.  \\nYes, it did take 15 minutes to get our pie.  We wanted it warm, which they do by sticking it in the oven - so it takes a while.  Remarkably, the apple still wasn't heated through.\\n\\nService - meh.  I'm done with people working the register that are too cool to engage.  Not rude, but certainly not friendly.  For a $5 slice of pie, can I at least get a cheerful hello?

I was beyond devastated because I had been craving a Colombian dog for far too long (since going to the food truck event down on OBT last year). But living in WP and going to OBT is unrealistic just for a hot dog, at least to me and my NYC logic of how far I'm willing to travel for food.\\n\\nAlas, in came my boyfriend to the rescue with his bookmark for Juniors over by Universal! Please note, the REAL ADDRESS is: 5389 S Kirkman Rd Suite 105, Orlando, FL 32819, we were all sorts of confused on Vineland when we couldn't find it.\\n\\nOk the burgers/hot dogs - this is whats in it: it's the meat, buns, onions, tomato, creamy cheese, lettuce, mayo, garlic, pink-sauce (ketchup, mayo, mustard mix), more ketchup, more mayp, crushed chips, and sweet pineapple sauce.\\nDo not ask for fries. The food is enough as it. Don't fool yourself unless you're a bear awaking from hibernation or a really drunk person - then stuff yourself silly.\\n\\nAs a 1st-gen Colombian-American, I was spoiled living in NYC and getting to eat these monthly (which explained why I was such a little chunky monkey... but I also blame an unhealthy love for Chicharron for that too). But I digress - this place reminds me of an actual burger/hot dog joint in Colombia, even the small alley of high-top wall seats, down to the Postobon and Colombiana (Sweet Apple Soda and very popular Colombian soda - both are NOT super fizzy, just how I like it, think Pepsi level of fizziness). As other reviews state, the burger meat (single) just vanishes into the toppings, so maybe upgrade to a double or triple. The hot dog is just divine. It's just how I remember it and thats a damn good thing. Just please remember people, Colombia is in South America. \\"Spicy\\" food is a Central American thing, so please don't let your pre-conceived notion of what \\"Spanish\\" food is based on only eating Taco Bell level of Mexican food.\\n\\nDont trust my opinion?

It was trendy, so in University Park- this meant it was busy.

I'm not one of those people. So after paying a few dollars for a bowl of hot & sour soup... that was oddly sweet (because I correctly predicted the dumplings wouldn't be enough) the dumplings came. They were on the small side, like Japanese gyoza, served on a sprinkling of bean sprouts. They were tasty, but average I'd say. The service was slower considering that they have only 10 or so menu items, and they are all dumplings and two types of soup. It is busy now, I'll be curious to see if it continues. If you are in the mood for Chinese food, I highly suggest walking a couple of blocks and going to Mary Chung's, it isn't hip, but if you are looking for that, perhaps it can be unhip enough to be hip... ironic or something?

With ethics in place I will say that Tin Shed was a spot that many locals detracted me from visiting during my original research but with early opening hours and a solid, though perhaps un-exciting, menu and low prices I figured it worth a look.\\n\\nArriving early at the restaurant and thus avoiding any lineup I walked into Tin Shed and was greeted pleasantly by a middle aged female who suggested I could sit anywhere I like and opting for a bar-seat near the window overlooking rainy Alberta Street I was handed a menu and offered coffee - refills available to my rear - and given a \\"Grumpy\\" cup I had to chuckle because at the time my mood was quite good, even if the \\"Portland Roasting Company\\" Coffee on brew was a bit acrid and over-roasted. \\n\\nOrders placed and left to wait as I watched the street outside slowly begin to populate with 20 to 30-somethings, the vast majority with dogs, it would not be long before my plates began to arrive - unfortunately all four of them at once; something I'd not see at any other brunch spot in the city even though the restaurant was not at all busy...though in the end I guess it did not really matter only one of the items was anywhere near 'good,' the least of which being a $2.25 chocolate chip cookie that paled in comparison to even the sort cut from a Pillsbury Bar and baked at home.\\n\\nMoving next to slightly better options, the \\"Belly Teaser\\" featuring Coconut Milk Jasmine Rice Porridge with Vanilla, Bananas, and nuts was fine, I guess - the texture pleasant enough but the flavor flat and lacking any semblance of vanilla while the bananas were a bit under-ripe - the whole dish cried for some sweetness, but even with a bit of sugar added it was not worth the stomach space and the majority of the $6 order returned to the kitchen untouched while the $1.75 Buttermilk Biscuit received the majority of my attention, its flaky exterior and soft center both textbook and nicely complimented with provided fresh raspberry preserves.\\n\\nLast, and although not least certainly not 'most,' a $2.50 side of \\"Sin\\" rounded out the offerings at Tin Shed and although the exterior was nicely cooked and laced with cinnamon the interior of the \\"House baked Sweet Potato-Cinnamon French Toast\\" was essentially just warm potato bread; not custard, not really sweet or even nuanced, just whispy and dull while the syrup - thick and cool - seemed out of place for a restaurant so focused on natural/healthy options, a note on the menu indicating that \\"real maple syrup\\" would have added a $1.50 surcharge to my $15.00 total bill; the vast majority of which I'm at least reassured went to compost."},{"name":"Noor Mediterranean Grill","address":"136 College Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Whether its for take-out, eat-in, or delivery, Noor is the best!

The first time I visited this Starbucks was in 2008 during Dragon Con. I've been back every year since in addition to a visit during MomoCon in 2014, so this review is written from a con-goer's perspective.\\n\\nThis Starbucks does crazy good business during conventions. Every Labor Day weekend (Dragon Con weekend), the line is out the door. For an event that spans multiple days with parties that go late into the night and a parade and panels that start early in the morning, caffeinated beverages are much needed for con staff, guests, and attendees.\\n\\nDespite the high volume of traffic during convention time, the baristas churn out orders in a reasonable amount of time. I've never had a problem with an order here. You can expect to spend at least $4-5 for a beverage.\\n\\nFor those who are feeling under the weather and think they may be coming down with the dreaded \\"con flu\\" (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=con%20flu), consider a Starbucks Refresher. These are fruit-based iced drinks that come with real fruit inside. Last time I checked, this location offers Valencia Orange, Very Berry Hibiscus, and Cool Lime.\\n\\nAll three drinks come with Green Coffee extract, so there is caffeine in them. The orange drink has real slices of orange, the hibiscus drink has whole blackberries, and the lime drink has real slices of lime with hints of mint and cucumber. I like to get these if I'm not feeling a traditional coffee or tea-based beverage.\\n\\nOn the traditional side, the cold brew coffee here is a great pick-me-up. One of my go-to drinks at this location is an iced chai tea latte. It's delicious, refreshing, and great for when I need to take a break from the con.\\n\\nService is good. During peak periods, I've seen staff members come out and take drink orders from people standing in line to get drink orders get started sooner.\\n\\nAt Dragon Con 2015, I ran into Mat Fraser (Paul The Illustrated Seal from American Horror Story: Freak Show, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Fraser) while we were both waiting for our Starbucks orders.

Keep in mind that the name of the restaurant contains both the food items: congee and noodle, so that's a good start if you're wondering what to get. There are however plenty of other items to choose from then just those two. \\n\\nBoth items came out fast and steaming. Now generally speaking, most of the time I have to add some soy or fish sauce to my congee but when I tasted it here, all I needed was some pepper. The taste of both dishes hit the spot. I was expecting some bland stuff but boy was I sure wrong. I couldn't believe how such simple and typical Chinese dishes like these could have been packed with so much flavor. Utter satisfaction.\\n\\nService was a little slow but I guess it was because they were a bit busy. We did order a third plate which was the fried taro (the same one you would find at dim sum restaurants). They totally forgot about it but it eventually came out after we reminded them. The fried taro was also well made but I could have done without.

We didn't get any alcoholic drinks, though we both really, *really* wanted to. The starters came quickly, and they were beyond excellent.

The herbed bread and basil butter were delicious - I could've eaten more, and probably should have asked, haha. The entrees themselves were really, really tasty. I wasn't thrilled with the vegetables, but that's my fault for not asking for a substitution. The zucchini risotto is the best I've ever eaten. We shared a piece of pumpkin bread pudding for dessert. We both took about half of our dinner home with us - the portions are pretty large, and not at all what I expected at 'a fancy restaurant'. I believe it was worth every penny. \\n\\nAs an aside, Josh mentioned that we were there for our anniversary to the hostess, and before we left we received a bottle of the 55 salad dressing as a gift.

The cheese tray and spinach quiche were tasty, but not at all amazing. The smoothie was way too wheat grassy for my daughter's taste. The black tea was fine. Perhaps we were paying nearly double for the partially lovely lake views, but the very loud and messy construction site next door made that not at all worth the extra cost.

But what really got me was how the kbbq was set up. (A more in-depth of the hot pot review is on the previous preview).\\n\\nThey first put a bit of oil on the clay(?) plate and then a piece of wax paper of some sort and then that's how we would cook the meat--on top of a piece of paper. Of course with all paper based products, it burns and such which requires frequent paper changes. Not only that, it makes it so that the meat cooks in its own oil and not drip away. I'm not gonna tell them how to run the place but I think having a changeable grill would work so much better and almost more efficient/aesthetically pleasing than if you just cook it on paper. \\n\\nThe service was good, there was nothing to complain about."},{"name":"Swank Restaurant","address":"808 SW Taylor Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We stopped in on a whim on our way back from the art museum and so glad we did.

It far exceeded my expectations.  I only wanted and expected decent, standard Thai, but this was exceptionally delicious Thai, better than most of the other places I've been to around town.\\n\\nWe decided to go with what we consider benchmarks for a Thai restaurant:  the summer rolls, the pad thai, and some kind of curry.  Just as a way to evaluate against other places in town.\\n\\nThe summer rolls were excellent:  very big, with lots of fresh delicious veggies and perfectly cooked shrimp.  The peanut sauce was soooo good, and they had these delicately carved veggie garnishes that looked like they took some time to prepare.\\n\\nThe panang curry came next, which I asked for 4-star spicy (out of 5) and BOY was it spicy which is what i wanted!  Some restaurants say spicy, but fail to deliver.  I got what I asked for and it was delicious.  I will say that some of the green beans were slightly undercooked, but I would rather have that than overcooked and we pretty much finished the plate.  The shrimp was very fresh and again, cooked perfectly.  I also requested brown rice instead of white, and still got white, but hey accidents happen, and it's still rice, so I didn't mind too much, at least not enough to send it back or alert the server.\\n\\nFinally, the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  So good!  Very spicy as well, with lots of fresh ground peanut, green onion, fresh shrimp, lime, egg, etc.  The noodles were an excellent texture and perfectly cooked.  Excellent plate of pad thai, and very generous portion.  \\n\\nI hope this place gets a following and does well, it's 2 blocks from our home and the people are very nice.  Service was great!

I don't recommend anybody go to Century, this is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

Corned beef quality was excellent. The sandwich lacked the pizazz flavor of the sauerkraut. It just didn't have flavor bite like I like. Too much butter was used on the marble rye, so there was grease factor with the sandwich, and the onion strings had grease factor as well.

When the bartender stopped to get our drink orders we asked if there were any drink specials and he replied not at this location - we would need to go to another Sage location for that. No problem, I wasn't going to Alpharetta for a drink special as he suggested. Great start - so we ordered 2 martinis, were served and the bartender vanished.  There were four other bartenders all huddled up behind the bar doing fist pumps and not serving customers - the whole vibe was off.  After about 20 minutes we weren't offered water or asked if we wanted to order anything off the menu so we flagged down the bartender to settle up and move on.  When he presented the bill he didn't say a word, he just put it in front of us and walked away.

We ordered the vegetarian plate and the lamb gyro and the hummus.  I asked what the Greek Coffee was and she explained it is basically coffee the Greeks drink.  When we sat down, she immediately brought us two Greek coffees to try and they were good; different and sweet.  The hummus was creamy and the pita...OMG, the pita were warm and soft.  After that, our lunch came out.  The lamb gyro was crammed with meat and it was tender and perfectly seasoned.  Not over seasoned like some other places around here.  The owner told us the lamb was actually from Greece.  My falafel was good, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.  You can tell they make their tzatziki in house and don't get it out of a jar.  There was another condiment on the plate that I didn't recognize but it was garlicky and out of this world!  As we were finishing up, the woman brought us out a small pile of Greek beignets.  They were amazingly light and fluffy and crispy on the outside.

It was about what I expected, which is decent food in a fun atmosphere, but nothing especially worth screaming about. We were seated immediately, which was nice as we arrived in the middle of the dinner rush on a Thursday night.  Between the patio, bar, and dining room, there is plenty of seating to go around.\\n\\nThe menu is playful - appetizers are \\"Foreplay,\\" the salads are \\"tossed with care,\\" and the Wrap section reminds diners to \\"Be safe and wrap it up!\\" Cute.  I was in the mood for a burger, so I went with Jerk Mehoff.  Go ahead and giggle - I certainly did - but it sounded delicious.  Seriously, a burger rubbed with jerk seasoning and served with pepperjack and \\"raspberry mayo?\\" I was prepared to die in the very best way possible.  I also thought a little spice would be the perfect way to follow up the appetizer we'd settled on, sweet tater tots with marshmallow dipping sauce.\\n\\nWe were seated quickly, the server appeared to take and deliver our drinks right away, and he was extremely funny and helpful.  The sweet tater tots were delicious, but so sweet they could almost have been a dessert.  I am not one to complain about that, though.  So far, so good.\\n\\nThe burgers came much later, long after we'd finished the appetizer and our drinks.  My friend had ordered the Jerk Mehoff as well - who could resist, I ask you? - but he'd asked for no cheese on his burger and even conversed with the server about not wanting the cheese. Of course, his had cheese on it.  It took about fifteen minutes for him to get a replacement burger, which is a bit long I think.  I was disappointed in mine as well - I could not taste anything remotely \\"jerk\\" about the meat, and there was no raspberry mayo to be tasted.  In fact, the server brought me a packet of regular Hellman's on the side.  There was nothing *wrong* with the burger and really, you're not going to find many better deals in Atlanta in terms of a fun, comfy place to hang out with fellow gay folk and enjoy decent food at a decent price.  That being said, the burger, as decent as it was, did not taste a thing like it was described on the menu.  That and the long wait for the kitchen to fix its mistake, make this a three-star review.

Uhhhh...) to the tip hungry waitresses, it just cancels out anything good that the kitchen might produce.\\n\\nMost recently, I met an associate for a lunch here and this occasion reminded me why I steer clear of Earls, especially in the downtown core. The restaurant wasn't busy and I asked to be seated in the dining room as opposed to the bar/lounge area as we were having a business lunch. The hostess either a)didn't care what I said and was spending time gawking at my good looking associate or b) was just an idiot as she walked us right over to the lounge. I asked to be moved and she rolled her eyes? Ok then...\\n\\nWhen our \\"server\\" came over, she made brief eye contact with me and then spent the other 99% of the time talking/interacting with my associate. I found it hilarious that she even went as far as to lean OVER him (chest in his face) to explain something on the menu to me, instead of just walking three steps to my side of the table. Our beverages were brought in an OK amount of time (how long does it take to pour a pop?) but the ridiculousness continued as she offered to fill my associates glass 3 times while leaving mine empty on the table. I had to ASK for a refill.  After she took our orders and walked away, we had a good laugh. It wasn't all in my head, we both noticed the over the top treatment he was getting and the cold shoulder I was getting.\\n\\nOur food was good, despite the \\"server\\" having to come back and fourth to our table twice to ask questions and confirm things. Write it down if you can't remember, we didn't even ask for modifications or add ons to our orders.\\n\\nThe sweetest part of the whole experience was when the bill was brought to the table and placed down promptly in front of my associate. I wish I had a picture of the look on this girls face when I reached over, grabbed the bill fold and said \\"don't worry, I've got this one\\". \\n\\nThis was the second time in my entire life that I've not left anything for a tip. I realize (having worked in the hospitality industry) that I screwed the kitchen staff out of a tip out on my bill, but I honestly could not justify giving the horrible excuse of a server any cash in her pocket. Further, I was so annoyed (and out of time) that I didn't even want to bother talking to a manager or shift sup. \\n\\nAs others have said: SKIP IT!"},{"name":"Me-N-Ed's Pizza Parlor","address":"7110 Hall Avenue","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"Having two toddlers makes it difficult to have dinners out sometimes but we love it here as they're well equipped for family meals.

We waited for about 40 minutes before our food even came to the table meanwhile about 3 other tables who arrived about 20 minutes after us got their food before us and our waitress was nowhere to be found!

She came back and asked how it was the second time around and I told her \\" I'm sorry I know it's not your fault but this food wasn't remade it's the same food, I bit a chicken tender and French fry and they are still on the plate\\" her response was \\"no honey I threw those out myself.\\" And she seemed as if she was offended because I addressed the problem to her.

I have visited the pig multiple times for dinner and it's been amazing EVERY time. So I was super excited when I had time to sit down for lunch with my very busy schedule! Instantly I decided on coming to my favorite spot. \\n\\nHere's where the one star got lost...\\nOur server for lunch. Unfortunately she seemed very uninterested in us on a seemingly slow Wednesday lunch service. I ordered a vodka soda to enjoy while sitting out in the beautiful Florida weather..but then..after realizing 20 minutes have past and still no drink...I was confused. So I walked up to the bar myself and had to pick up my own drink sitting there with the ticket under it watered down! The bartender was doing her job and very sweet but where was our server?! \\n\\nAfter this we got our apps, wings and tacos...tacos were amazing and always and the wings were very interesting and full of flavor. Not your plain old wings but that's why I come here! \\n\\nWe then had the Nashville chicken sandwich and Gatherer salad. Both great lunch items but our fries were ice cold! This made me pretty sad because I know what amazing things the kitchen is capable of! So after waiting awhile for our server to return I told her about the fries and she hesitated and asked if we wanted new ones......this should be a no brainer for a server! Bring new fries and offer a dessert on the house or something off the check. \\n\\nSo when we finished I figured at least the drink I ordered would be taken off and maybe something else for the fries ...but not a single thing. Not one! \\nI then had to ask to speak to the manager(Ashley) and this is where it all turned around for us.

I've been there a few dozen times.  It's definitely a favorite.\\n\\nI'll categorize:\\n\\nFood: the food is basically great.  I've had the opportunity now to try most things on the menu at least once, and even though I have my favorite dishes I'm rarely disappointed with any of the other options.  One very disappointing thing to note, though, is that my favorite dish of all time was removed from the menu about a year ago and I miss it very much.  Sausage and Pepper Classico, you will always be fondly remembered.\\n\\nService: this is usually good, sometimes great, sometimes not so good.  It depends on what night of the week you're in and who is working.  Sad to say, I've had lousy service here just about as often as I've had fantastic service.  The good news is that even the worst service at Macaroni Grill is still not too bad. \\n\\nAtmosphere: the atmosphere is pretty good and definitely feels Mediterranean Italian.  I like the atmosphere, especially in the bar area.  Fake plants, and paper table clothes?  Sure.  Have you been to Italy lately?  That's how they do it.  The point is, it feels like Italy and it tastes like Italy, more so than Olive Garden could ever hope for.\\n\\nPrices/value: the price is moderate.  It's not a fancy restaurant so don't expect fancy prices.  Do, however, expect food that is frequently more fancy than the price you'll pay for it.  That is what you'll get.\\n\\nHandy tip #1: you get better service in general in the bar area, on the stools.  The crew they have slinging the alcohol is the best in the place.  Probably the best in town.\\n\\nHandy tip #2: don't bring groups of over 6 people here, especially if some people will be paying separate.  The wait staff is just not prepared to handle that, for some reason.  We had a shindig of about 10 people, all going dutch, and we were most displeased with the hassle we had to go through to get all the bills taken care of.  It's Keystone Cops for sure, so stick to small groups at most. \\n\\nAll in all, if you're interested in a nice dinner and drinks, at a moderate price, Macaroni Grill is never a bad choice.  It's often the perfect choice if you're in the mood for Italian."},{"name":"Me-N-Ed's Pizza Parlor","address":"7110 Hall Avenue","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"Last night the man and I decided we didn't want to cook and since Me & Eds was right there AND had a special on for their large pepperoni pizza's that's where we went :)! \\n\\nI almost gave this place only 3 stars as the cashier left LOADS to be desired. Since it's not in the best location we thought we would park in front on the street. Of course it's paid parking until 8 but that wasn't what bothered us.

On my last take out order I chose a large pizza extra-cheese and pepperoni on half.  I like Flipper's sauce but I find it weird on a traditional pizza that they put the pepperoni under the cheese.  Chicago deep dish, I get that the toppings are buried but not on a traditional pie. I've only ever ordered cheese pizza so I had never experienced this. The pizza itself was good, but I find it weird that they don't have electric warmers to hold the pizza when they finish cooking it before the customer comes to pick it up.  I walked into the restaurant, paid, and the staff member takes my pizza out of a delivery bag.  By the time I got it home (I live 1.2 miles away) the pizza was luke warm.  Maybe I'm crazy but don't most establishments keep the pizza in a warming oven?  Not to mention I threw a $2.00 tip on the receipt even when I knew it was a carry out order because I appreciate quality and know that restaurant workers live off tips, but the young lady working the counter didn't even thank me when she grabbed the receipt and shoved it in the drawer.  I thanked her and she just walked away without any acknowledgment.  Lastly, if I were the franchisee and I was operating a restaurant in the busy SODO shopping center I would have worked a dedicated 10 minute parking spot for \\"carry out orders only\\" into my lease. I can never find a place to park when I go to pickup the pizza at 7pm because the shopping center is so busy.  I parked in the garage this time but it's kind of a hassle.

The hostess came over and apologized for the confusion and sat us at a different table. Mistakes happen, not a big deal. But that was only the beginning.\\n\\nMy friend, who had been there before, ordered a ginger mojito. I thought that sounded good, so I ordered one too. The waiter looked confused and said that they didn't have those. My friend said, I promise you guys have them, I ordered one last time. So the waiter gave her the benefit of the doubt and went over to the bartender to put in the order. 20 minutes later, everyone else at our table got their drinks, and my friend and I were still sans ginger mojitos. A while later, the bartender came over and gave us yellowish drinks and said, here are your bumblebees (or something like that??). And we asked him if that's the name they have for ginger mojitos and he said, oh no these are bumblebees. And we told him that's not what we ordered. He took the drinks back. About 5 minutes later, the waiter came over and tried giving us the same drinks. And again, we said no, we ordered ginger mojitos, not bumblebees (whatever those are). And he said, yes that's what bumblebees are. And we were like, oh, the bartender said otherwise. So the waiter, again looking very confused, went back to the bartender then came back to us, and said that yes, bumblebees are ginger mojitos. He added, they have tequila. My friend said, mojitos have rum, not tequila. She tasted the drink and said, this is definitely not a mojito. After all of that, it was finally settled, and we got our drinks. What a pain!\\n\\nThen, throughout our dinner, at LEAST 3 times we were given the wrong food. We ordered a few rolls and then later decided to order one more. We waited about 45 minutes for that last roll. Sure, the restaurant was busy, but isn't that normal on a Saturday night? \\n\\nI was very surprised in the extreme disorganization and incompetence on the part of the staff.

Still, it is one thing to have abrupt and impatient service at the table (which included having one server really irritated with us when we asked her to repeat what she said regarding which particular congee she just delivered as they all looked similar and we ordered several different kinds).  And I must say the table-side service by multiple servers was probably the worst all of us adults at the table can recall ever experiencing at a Chinese restaurant.    But at one point when my 6 year old and I were standing by a fish tank (as the kid wanted to see the fish that was swimming upside down), a server rushed out of the adjacent hall and actually shoved my son (via pushing his shoulder) out of the way.  It was definitely a first for me.  It wasn't as if there wasn't room behind us to walk pass; she just didn't want to veer from her straight path.  If she had even said anything we would have definitely moved to give her more room.  But she came out so quickly the first time I noticed her was when she pushed my son.  I was upset and wanted to say something, but I was so startled that by the time I got my bearings, she was all the way across the room.

The oysters are always fresh, and you usually have a choice between either the Royal Miyagi or the Summer Breeze. Personally, I think the Summer Breeze is clearly the superior oyster, but try both and see for yourself! It's a very small place, manned by only one or two people at any one time. I love the cozy intimate space, and the servers are always friendly, but (through no fault of their own) the service is ridiculously slow. The servers are expected not just to serve, but to restock supplies, bartend, seat people, take reservations, clear tables, AND shuck all the oysters. It's an impossible mission where they are set up to fail due to gross understaffing by management. \\n\\nExpect up to half hour waits for a dozen fresh-shucked oysters, and up to ten minutes even to just bring your wine to the table. I really like this place, and want so much to love it, but the lack of efficiency here is a pretty big problem. Another gripe is that aside from the buck-a-shuck, everything else on the menu reads like an over-priced upscale seafood restaurant. The space essentially functions as a bar; I've never seen anyone actually eat a meal there. The menu, however, doesn't offer any bar snacks or shareable appetizers to accompany drinks. I love chowder and mashed sweet potato, but they're just not conducive to having drinks after work with friends. I'm not being picky - even a plate of fries would be nice, but fries are not on the menu! I'm not writing this place off, but it definitely needs a few management tweaks."},{"name":"Sage Woodfire Tavern Buckhead","address":"3379 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I went for brunch.

I just got us annual Disney passes for Christmas, so I decided to give one of the restaurants on Disney property a try. I chose Artist Point since it had some of that Northwest US style we are fond of, and we really like that area of the country (Seattle in particular). \\n\\nWe arrived at about 8:40 with a 9pm reservation. The hostess informed us that they were running behind about 20 minutes due to earlier parties not vacating their tables. Not a problem. What was unusual is she said they were out of buzzers to alert guests when their table was ready. Shouldn't an establishment keep at least a minimum amount to cover the tables they have....with maybe a few extras just in case? We grabbed a drink in the lounge and sat down together to chat. After 20 minutes went by I inquired with the hostess on how many more tables were to be sat before us. She said we were #4. Well we ended up getting our table 20 minutes after that, so 40 minutes past our reservation time. I wonder if they put the same priority to walk-up diners & those with reservations? I know that V-Day is a huge event for all restaurants but I think Artist Point overbooked and left those of us with later reservations at the mercy of those who didn't leave in time to turn our table.\\n\\nOur server did a great job initally explaining the menu and recommended a few items. The food itself was very tasty and I would have rated this entire experience 4-stars if not for this issue that came up. My wife's cedar-plank salmon was raw in the middle. I didn't see our server right away and after a few minutes I flagged down another gentleman to explain the situation. Let me give some detail before I go further. I have worked in the restaurant industry before as a server. I am extremely patient when it comes to those rare instances when food is prepared incorrectly or under/over cooked. I know it is not the fault of those that bring the food to the table. So I explained very nicely to the other server that I flagged down that my wife's salmon was raw in the middle. She had moved it to another small plate and had it open where you could obviously see it was raw inside. He whisked it away and said he would find the person who was taking care of us. Our server came up a minute later and said her salmon would be our shortly. No apology, Didn't offer her something else from the menu. Nothing. That was bad itself. What followed was inexcuseable for a establishment of this magnitude. They just slapped her raw salmon and cooked it a bit longer and then SERVED HER THE SAME PIECE OF SALMON THAT WAS SENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN. I expect this from a Denny's or IHOP, not a very nice Disney restaurant such as this. Again when he brought it back to the table, no apology....nothing. Business as usual. Well the inside was cooked finally, but because they used the same piece of salmon the outside was extremely dry now. \\n\\nI didn't want the meal comp'ed, not even her salmon taken off the bill. Just some acknowledgement that they didn't prepare it correctly and maybe a small discount or free dessert. What was the icing on the cake was the fact they used the same piece of salmon that was sent back to the kitchen.\\n\\nSorry, Artist Point....you've lost our business for good. And we really need to consider dining at other Disney restaurants on property now."},{"name":"Ginger Exchange Symphony","address":"250 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"It doesn't claim to be authentic Asian, which is good, because it isn't.

This establishment in Orlando thinks of the details you want before you even know you would've liked them. For example, I was offered black linen napkins as I was wearing black, and white napkins can leave residue on clothing. We returned for our wedding anniversary dinner (booked through open table app) and approaching the booth a red rose and heart confetti, subtle not too much, decorated the table with a hand written card from the staff. Without our knowledge, the hostess was able to place us with the same waiter, Curtis, we had on a previous anniversary trip. He has been with Flemmings for 11years and was a wealth of knowledge and a gracious host.  (It really says alot for a company to have employee loyalty in the restaurant industry) He prepared the Belvedere Vodka martini table side in hand cut glass to have with our Mushroom Ravioli appetizer which was an incredible start to our journey.  As they have about 100 bottles by the glass, Curtis offered a taste test between Cabernet Sauvigvons which was very helpful when choosing the perfect bottle to share. Then the  manager came over and personally thanked us for our return and gave us his well wishes. \\n\\nThe Steaks were melt in your mouth divine at just the right temperature, and the recommended coffee rub for the strip was well paired.

We tried the pub for a small meal and a few cocktails.. very attentive waiters and the food was better than expected. \\nA couple of issues, the 1st , we called the hotel prior to booking to confirm they have a shuttle service to Epcot (food and wine festival) free of charge, were were told the times and the departure times back. When we arrived the next evening and again inquired about the shuttle to Epcot they confirmed and told us the times as well gave us the schedule. The next morning we went to ask where to wait for the shuttle and we were asked what time our reservation is...we stated that was not clarified and we inquired 2 times about the shuttle and she stated sorry but you need a reservation and the time was incorrect so we were told we would have to wait until noon for the next one if she could fit us on as the reservation should have been made prior to 10pm the night before. We were a littlle miffed as this was one of the reasons we chose the hotel as to not have to pay for parking in Epcot or worry about driving back.  We decided to suck It up and drive. \\nNext issue, the room was not cleaned when we got back around 6pm. Not that we left a mess but there were left over dessert containers with melted icecream still on the table and some trash ..we expected to walking, relax on the clean bed and just have a fresh room ...after a long fun filled day. That didn't happen. We called the front desk and were told they clean up to 7pm. Then the room cleaner tried coming in without knocking and caught us off guard. He left us with a handful of towels and asked if we wanted to leave the room so he could clean. Sorry no! I want to give it 4stars but the couple if mishaps prevent it.

Good prices for a Sixth Street lunch and pretty good lunch fare.  This past weekend marks the first time I came for dinner to sample from the full menu - and I was fairly impressed.  The place was packed (not a big shock here, it was 8pm on Friday), but they found room for us at the bar in the interim.  I had the Ranch Rita to start (I think that was the name) - a relatively sweet twist on a traditional marg.  After a couple sips, I deducted a few man points from my tally and decided my alcohol dollars were better spent on something else.  Once we were seated, we started with the fried oysters and calamari.  Not the best fried seafood I've had, but not bad either, just a lot more oil than I am accustomed to.  The dipping sauces also left a bit to be desired. Now on to the high points - for my main course I ordered the Pork Tenderloin 616 (ancho honey glaze, served over poblano taters, roasted corn, pico, and portabello mushrooms).  Superbly flavorful and more food than I could handle.  My buddy ordered the ribeye, cooked to his specifications and equally massive.  Our server was great, handling a few item substitutions and being pretty attentive despite how crowded it was.

Meanwhile we are waiting. Other staff members are going back and forth, talking and laughing, looking at us like they are wondering why we were there. Finally Ms. Hostess dallies herself back in no apparent rush and we get seated.  We have plenty of time to look over the menu cuz our server, whom I affectionately dubbed \\"Jeff Spicoli\\", also imitated the whole \\"slower is better\\" attitude. Not to mention that everytime we asked for something his expression was that of utter bewilderment. We ordered drinks which I also asked for a lot of ice.  That didn't happen. We ordered the spinach dip appetizer. It came with tortilla chips and a side of salsa which was very bland. the dip was okay. For dinner, my husband ordered a chicken sandwich with fries and I had the shrimp tacos and a baked potato. I noticed they offered a bang bang shrimp option and asked if the shrimp was tossed in that sauce for the tacos. \\"Spicoli\\" said  no. I then requested to have the \\"bang bang\\" shrimp in the taco and he said they couldn't do that but he would bring me a side of the sauce. Okay. When the food came, my husband looked less than thrilled with his choice.  His chicken looked anemic, and the roll like it came from the bread aisle at publix. Fries were good but they were cold so hubby didn't eat them. The tacos were okay. The bang bang sauce had just enough spice. Tortillas were also cold and my baked potato al dente. \\nAs this is a sports bar, we requested one tv be changed to the NASCAR race. I may as well asked for world peace.

He then asks if we wanted our check.  Well, if we're done, and unless you're buying, then yes, check please. That was the only time he shifted to a higher gear. He hovered near our table til the check was signed and swiftly wished us a good day and picked it up. Oh and that \\"side\\" of bang bang sauce? Yeah, got charged for that.

However I can't remember what I ate and so that knocks off a star for me. It was good, it was brunch but it wasn't anything to write home about. There is a good balance however between sweet and savory. Other members of the family might disagree as they love the burger trilogy but after eating at other places every day it can be a bit of a let down. I do remember lunch but only because of how incredibly greasy my steak was. It was a nice cut of meat that's not often used but I don't know if it was the cooking style or it rendered that much fat in a short amount of time but I really felt like I was eating a steak covered in oil. It definitely made me not even want to bother with my fries which actually were good. However I and my little companion were not thrilled with anything we ate. The service was a bit lackluster but I guess they're really going for a French bistro vibe with the French pop tunes playing nonstop, which actually is an interesting addition to the experience.\\n\\nHowever it is still a restaurant inside of a hotel in a city full of great restaurants.

We spent an hour and a half with two of the sweetest people in the world, hearing stories about how the owner spent his youth spear fishing and deep sea diving in South America (in fact, he was crowned the top deep sea diver in South America!) and looking at some impressive pictures of the numerous fish he'd caught over his lifetime, and chatting with the sweet mom to the mom and pop, who gladly took everything we ordered with a smile and a little comment on what was good on the menu (hint: everything!).\\n\\nWe started with an order of Tiradito Tricolor, which is something I probably wouldn't order again, but that's because I'm not a fan of ceviche-like dishes. However, for what it was, it was incredible! As I said, I don't like ceviche normally, but between the two of us, we ate it all, and happily. The two colored sauces they served with the fish were certainly amazing, and the yellow one I would eat just on its own! We got Tamal next, with pork, which I devoured by myself since my husband does not enjoy corn dishes. But, the toast it comes with is so incredibly soft inside that he did end up stealing half of that! The tamal itself was flavorful and had olives (I think?) and roasted peppers inside like little treasures. The onion slaw on the side was perfectly seasoned and sweet to counter the savory pork. Our main course, Lomo Saltado, was a favorite for my husband, and my first time trying it. In his words, \\"That was the best lomo saltado I have ever eaten, ever!\\" And boy, he's had a lot of it. I had to fight him for the french fries, which were perfectly soaked with the juice running from the all-too-tender steak. I think there might have been a single lonely grain of rice when we finished, and that was only because licking the plate is usually frowned on in restaurants! I finished my dinner with flan, which unlike most places I had it, was served with a chocolate sauce drizzled on top. Needless to say, much like everything else, this was perfection. Moist, creamy, and not the least gritty or even chewy. It melted in your mouth and was sweet but not too sweet, the ideal ending to a fabulous meal.

I ordered a chocolate croissant, a mocha with caramel (based on a yelp review), and a single-shot espresso, all to go.  I was informed they only do double-shots...that's annoying because I have to decide whether to drink an extra shot with the attendant caffeine, leave it on the table (wasteful and it's hard for me to resist espresso like that), or not get any (which is less caffeine than I want and I don't find out if their espresso is any good).  But I can deal with a little extra caffeine so I get the espresso.  The cashier asks if I want the espresso for here.

So she tells the guy she'll make his drink next, and she pours my drink from the mug into a to-go cup.  Thus I watch the pretty design in the milk get turned into a uniform brown.  It's not really so much that I care about the design, but I do care about the coffee-to-foam boundary, which is messed up when you pour from one container to another.  Then she gives me my espresso...in a to-go cup.  So I stand there and drink the espresso out of the to-go cup while watching her and wondering how she thought I was going to hold both of the to-go cups and everything else I had with me.  She wasn't rude, but it was an odd occurrence...maybe she is inexperienced or maybe their ordering system cannot handle a split order (here & to-go)...but then why did the cashier ask me if I wanted it like that?\\n\\nMost importantly, the coffee was ok, but not any better than Starbucks.

At Hu Tieu Nam Vang they would make watermelon tea or green bean tea with the real deal, fresh fruit and vegetables.  At Tapicha it's all made with powder.

I've gone through MANY cards over these years.\\n\\nThey have a truly outstanding number of flavors to choose from and also a pretty wide variety of teas both caffeinated and decaf.

Their food is the best but there are other spots nearby with good food and better service. An older man works the door like some guard dog, but it is hard to see how he is helpful or effective at anything other than frustrating and upsetting people as he's so rude and disrespectful. Telling paying customers they aren't accepting orders, that they have to wait outside (surely a capacity issue), or they can't be seated at a table until the kitchen clears him to do so is just asinine in 2018; these folks aren't new to this restaurant game. It's like they are doing customers a favor by being open and have no regard for people's time or respect for the fact that people can take their hard-earned money elsewhere; coming there truly isn't a must.

I don't know what kind of shrimps they used but they were literally the thinest shrimps I've ever seen.

The donburi bowl was actually tasty but someone added way too much salt at the end to make it almost inedible.\\n\\nFor the ramens, we got the Kanji Ramen and the Tonkatsu Ramen. The broth was ok.

At the time I thought the food to be mediocre and not worth the wait in line, nor the long wait to actually get the food once it was ordered to be worth it.\\n\\nBut we wanted to have Sunday Breakfast somewhere outside of the usual places, and after reading and re-reading the menu, settled on Tin Shed. Apparently part of the key is to show up earlier, or go on a holiday weekend. When we arrived about 9:15 there were only three groups ahead of us so the wait was only about five minutes.\\n\\nBased on another review here (thank you Yelp iPhone App!) I decided to try the Garlic Basil Infused Bloody Mary. It was every bit as awesome as it sounds. With the added bonus of actual chunks of garlic to be sucked up in your straw and chewed on!\\n\\nThe wife went with champagne, but note that their glasses are actually small jam canning jars. While technically the incorrect glass to use with champagne to keep the bouquet within the drink, (does that sound like I know what I'm talking about?) note that it is actually a larger portion then you'd get in a typical champagne flute. \\n\\nThe first dish was the \\"Tim Curry,\\" described as Roasted seasonal veggies, sweet potato, mushroom, onion, roasted garlic (huge chunks again!) and tofu in a coconut-curry sauce topped with avocado, raisins and peanuts. It was described to me multiple times as \\"awesome,\\" \\"great,\\" delicious,\\" and \\"best breakfast ever.\\" \\n\\nWhile I would disagree about the last statement, as curry isn't exactly my idea of breakfast food, it was indeed a fairly tasty concoction.\\n\\nThe second was the \\"Roll Over,\\" Potato cakes topped with sausage and egg scrambled and smothered with apple-wood smoked bacon gravy (or mushroom-rosemary gravy.) I went with the bacon gravy, and also spent the extra buck to get a homemade buttermilk biscuit on the side. \\n\\nThis turned out to be stellar choice. Despite my first thought of \\"that looks a little small on the portion side of things considering everything else I see walking out of the kitchen,\\" I didn't actually finish the entire plate because it was hella filling. \\n\\nI've become quite the fan of potato cakes when done right, and to use them as the base for a scramble is pure genius. The sausage in the scramble was a bit on the bland side, being there more to add some heft to the eggs. But it didn't need to be more then that as the bacon gravy complimented the entire dish really well. \\n\\nAnd the biscuit? That was an astounding marvel of bread-like engineering. Topped with the home made raspberry jam provided I probably could have had an entire meal of two of these and been satisfied. And full, they're that big. \\n\\nNow the only reason I am giving this place only four stars; First, the bar stools are really too low. I'm not a short person at all, but they were fairly uncomfortable and I felt like I could have used a couple of phone books for some height. Second, the length of time it took to get the food was almost 30 minutes. They didn't seem that busy, but we had the same problem the first time we visited, which was part of the reason it took so long to come back. \\n\\nI can see that part of the problem is likely the small kitchen space that they have five or six people in at all times, but it seems to me a larger kitchen space would allow food to be made faster and would help increase table turnover, thus increasing profits. \\n\\nBut really... those are my only criticisms and they're pretty minor over all. The quality of the food, the frankly awesome service, and the good drinks have moved this back up into the \\"must go again\\" category."},{"name":"The Corner Suite Bistro De Luxe","address":"850 Thurlow St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"A full five glowing stars for the Corner Suite.\\nMaybe it's two times lucky, but they've delivered perfectly so far.\\n\\nLazy Sunday Brunch - Eggs Benny and waffles were a delight.\\nLatte - Smooth as silk.\\n\\nCasual Dinner - Veal Cheeks - Wow.

Everything we tried was well cooked with good flavor but it was still fairly Americanized Mexican food. It's lacking a lot of the big flavors and presentations that make the cuisine what it is. I had the Habanero steak burrito; tasty but not the least bit spicy and while the steak was tasty, the burrito, instead of being labeled as steak should have been \\"Bean and Rice burrito with Hints of Steak\\" as the steak was rather scarce.

Have for a couple of years now, but for some reason I very rarely cross over the barrier that is Clarendon Street. Sure, I will walk all the way down to Gloucester Street for some delicious middle eastern food, but to go a whole block and a half in the other direction is like putting your shoes on the wrong feet. You just don't do it. Today was different; my bff was doing some free-lance work in my building and we decided to go for a late lunch. Our first stop was the little caf√© in the library, but they were closing early for some weird reason. So we meandered through the farmers market and finally landed ourselves in this place.\\n\\nIt is interesting.  First walking in, I had the feeling that I was walking into an old school diner-ish place.  Then I went around the pay counter and saw the salad bar. No old school diner in their right mind would have a fancy salad bar, let alone one with at least four choices of croutons. That, however, is all that I really know about the salad bar.  It certainly looked fancy, but, then again, the lettuce could be sub-par.  I don't know.  Maybe next time.\\n\\nThere were a lot of those temporary queue dividers all over the place and my bff and I had to take a few moments to figure out what line to get in. This process would most likely have been aided if there were people in the lines, but late lunches leave empty seats and empty seats mean less of a crowd to show the newbies what to do. No one from behind the counter spoke up to ask if they could help us, either, and it didn't look like they were all that busy, so that is a star knocked off right there.\\n\\nWhen I finally pulled it together enough to walk up to the counter and order my food, I could barely hear the person taking my order. It isn't as if there was much of anything besides a chest-high counter and air between us, but I still had to have him repeat the choices of bread about three times before I just said, \\"WHEAT WILL BE FINE\\". The bff had the same issue with her soup order; how many soups sound like \\"chili\\"? One, that I know of.  Also, the pay counter was a farce; I was called over to what looked like the coffee counter to ring out. Strange.\\n\\nFinally, with our food acquired, we went to sit in the seats that face the window. This place has seating all around their windows, the kind of seating that is like bar stools at a bar, but the bar is the window. You know the type. Anyway, we tried swiveling the chairs toward us to sit down. These things turn about 20¬∫ maximum, so slipping your butt into the seats can be challenging. Once we had sat down and arranged ourselves, my bff turned to me and simply said, \\"You MUST Yelp this place.\\" So here you are. I think I will go back at some point, because the vegetarian black bean soup was that good. I just don't know when.

My husband had stayed here years ago and obviously thought it was good when he reserved an executive suite with the woodburning fireplace on the top floor, room 1601. I arrived a day before him to find a teensy little suite compared to every other suite I've ever stayed in, which is many and often at least once to twice  a month for ten years. This is a corner suite and you'd be surprised to know that the walls on all sides look straight into brick walls. The carpet is a gold square pattern with dark stains from wear. The upholstery on the two mismatched dining room type chairs is also a gold diamond pattern. Let's say c.1975. The sofa is a sad pink brocade from the 1940's that is not only threadbare but has disgusting black stains where one's fanny would sit. I will take photos and post. \\n\\nWhen my husband arrived a day after me, he attempted to change rooms immediately to something larger. When the desk clerk looked on his screen to see which room we were in, he gave us a funny look and said, \\"Oh wow, you're in our largest suite. And even if we wanted to change you, there's nothing else available.\\" \\n\\nThe bathroom had only one lavatory and zero storage to set up your toiletries. Since the tiles are 12\\"x12\\" I can tell you that the entire bathroom floor space, including the toilet and lavatory is 4' x 5'. An old shower curtain makes it look oh-so-special. The best part of this miniature bathroom is sitting on the toilet. Both of us hit our butts on the edge of the sink to the left and the toilet paper dispenser to the right. Guess what? There's 14\\" between the sink and the toilet paper dispenser. My husband hit his head on the light switch as he attempted to stand up. He's 6' and 185 lbs. I feel for the people who are larger. I don't know how they could possibly use the toilet! \\n\\nAlso a surprise were the light fixtures on the ceiling. That's something you don't see in a renovated hotel, which clearly this is not. \\n\\nI have never, ever stayed in a room where there was NO coffee pot of any kind. If you really think you should stay here, the location is great, then bring your own. I brought my Nespresso pot and loads of capsules because we are renting a house on the Cape for a week beginning today. It came in handy for sure. (Hint: there's a Nespresso boutique just next door, but I couldn't possibly wait until they open hours from now to have my first cup). It took four different trips from housekeeping to bring a coffee cup, a spoon, bottled water (they give you one small bottle when you check in but no more unless you buy it from the mini-bar), extra hangers, a foam pillow. Don't expect to get a memory-foam type pillow even though they will tell you they have them. What they actually bring is a shredded foam. \\n\\nThey do have two flat screen TVs, one in each room, if that's important to you. To rent a movie from last year be prepared to spend $16.99. \\n\\nThe bed was comfortable. I'll give them that much. There was a knock on the door last night after we returned from dinner to give us our turn down service. Since we were already in bed, it seemed a little silly. The room safe remains locked from the previous guest. The robes in the room are stiff and thin terry cloth. Since there are plenty of clothing stores around, I walked down to Marshall's and bought a new one. Problem solved. \\n\\nThe air conditioning, while noisy, does work. It is July, so we didn't need the fireplace although if they ever did remodel, I suspect that would remain a nice feature. \\n\\nIf this were a lesser chain, a Holiday Inn perhaps, I would give this 3 stars as my expectations would be much lower. The staff are nice enough, saving them from a 1 star review. But this place passes itself off as a five star luxury hotel. We are justifiably (as are 95% of the other reviewers) disappointed.

I think that two people could each get the combo special and be more than satisfied and be out for less than $20.\\n\\nBut we got waaaay more than that.  Here's what I can remember of what we got...  Hot and sour soup, which is something I'm usually tepid toward, was delicious.  Orders of vegetarian and shrimp dumplings.  Salt and pepper tofu, which was wrapped in seaweed, fried, and topped with aromatics and a brown sauce.  Very awesome, and not heavy at all.  A special that they called Portuguese tofu, which was served almost like a really thick stew.  Well cooked tofu with potato in this good thick sauce.  I could have eaten three bowls.  My friend got a \\"barbecue\\" pork bun that she went nuts for and said was worth the drive on its own.  I got a veggie bun that was okay, but probably the least favorite thing I ate.  Vegetarian spring rolls.  Sorry, I don't remember the name, but it was sort of like a really thin, moist enchilada with seasoned vegetables and a thin sauce on top.  Really good; I was full when I tried these, but I found room.   Sesame balls, again, something I'm hot and cold toward, but loved.  And an egg custard bun that was absolutely fantastic.

I think about, fantasize and dream about these empanadas for days after I eat one.  Who am I kidding?  I never eat just one.  I could make a meal of these empanadas.  They're accompanied by a sauce/relish thing that among other things contains very finely diced peppers, onions and cilantro, mixed with vinegar.  It's addictive!\\n\\nThe rest of the food is so-so, at least to my gringo palate, but there's a loyal Colombian following gobbling down traditional dishes like Arroz con Pollo and the signature Bandeja Paisa and Mini Bandeja Paisa.  I'm not sure what makes it mini because it's a ton of food - grilled steak, pork skin, eggs, sweet plantains, corn cake, avocado, rice and beans.  I've also tried the Pechuga a la Criolla (chicken breast with creole sauce).  The chicken is pounded pretty flat and the sauce is okay, although not a traditional creole sauce like I'm used to.  Still, it's all pretty tasty and comes with rice and what passes for salad - undressed shredded lettuce with tomato and avocado.  The closest thing to a dressing is the oil and vinegar cruets on the table.  On weekends they offer special soups, meals unto themselves, made with a variety of meat like hen, beef and mondongo (entrails!).  My friend swears by the tongue soup.  Other traditional dishes include arepas and for dessert, postre de natas.\\n\\nMy Colombian boyfriend introduced me to La Casona and it's become a favorite place to celebrate holidays, his new art exhibit or when he's feeling homesick.  He laughs at my attempts to use my limited Spanish, but the menu is also printed in English so I'm on safe ground.\\n\\nIf you hunger for Colombian food, give La Casona a try.

We moved inside once it started raining without any of her help and sat in the corner of the restaurant, unnoticed and forgotten by our server. The one time she did come by she took my boyfriend's drink order and hurried off before she could get any other's. We had a good time, so we didn't let it bother us too much. But, last night, I went again for a late dinner with my boyfriend and we waited in the door at the hostess stand for a while until someone came up to us and asked us \\"what's up?\\" in the most unfriendly tone, as if she were annoyed we were there. We said we were here for dinner and wanted to sit outside. She said...ummm....ok....its self seating once we go to the late night menu.... and then walked away. We grabbed some menus and sat outselves outside and waited for our server. When she finally came, we realized we were looking at the wrong menus (we just grabbed some because the hostess just kind of walked away). Dinner was...ok...service was....ok.

Luckily, there are plenty of spots nearby where you can grab a quick bite (a breakfast appetizer, as I call it). Additionally, Tin Shed is dog friendly so there will be pooches inside. Lastly, they will split the bill for you even if it's busy, and you bring a mini-van worth of people with you.\\n\\nI came here on Memorial Day with seven other people, and faced the 2 hour wait. Luckily, we were able to give a name and number and explore the area as opposed to being bound to waiting near the restaurant (this helped my hanger immensely).\\n\\nOnce we received the call we ran to the restaurant, and were quickly seated. Coffee, tea, and water were self-serve (unusual practice for an Angeleno, but when in PDX, you must act like a native/long time transplant). I ordered the everything naughty. And I didn't feel the least bit bad about it. The biscuits were delicious, the eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausage was tasty, and the hash browns... Let me just end with, I'm drooling as I type this.\\n\\nGo brunch here!"},{"name":"The Ruby Dragon","address":"N Mississippi Ave & N Skidmore St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Excellent vegetarian curry.

The batidas are outstanding. The dinner specials are uniformly good, and some are standouts-- the rabo , the chicken friccasee, the red snapper, the \\"vegetable tower\\" ( a sort of Cuban ratatouille), the goat. The morir sonando is like if Jesus Christ himself appeared in your bedroom to make an Orange Julius for your hangover. Some people here are dissing the sammiches, and I can't address that because I almost never have them. But I can guarantee the entrees are not only very good, but outstanding for the price. No kidding, two hungry adults can happily eat delicious Cuban comfort food to the point of discomfort for $22. Two hungry adults I know frequently do.\\n\\nI love the waitstaff. I feel like they're my family. And Nobel is a warm guy and a great supporter of the neighborhood. Jamaica Plain is lucky to have El Oriental here, and it's worth the T ride from other neighborhoods to try it.\\n\\nNote: I'm pricing this at moderate by yelp parameters, based on the most entrees being $10-15.

Quick and tasty dim sum any time you want it (after 11am). You don't need a large group to enjoy it, and woe on you if you do try to bring a group. The seating is optimized for parties of no more than four.\\n\\nAlso, you don't get the pleasure of seeing the carts go rolling by and choosing what looks or smells nice (nor the humilation of being abused by the waiter). This place assumes some prior bare bones knowledge but the staff is very helpful as are your fellow diners who don't at all mind your asking.\\n\\nBut what you DO get is your choice of about 25 a-la-cart items and daily specials. The quality is very high and I'd say is on par with the equivalent bites at Yank Sing, which in my view is better than other Austin options in terms of taste. The taste and texture is very fresh and they make it a point on their website that there is NO MSG.  There are no fried chicken feet that I can tell. And those fragrant mysterious smells you get that the restaurants in Hong Kong (or the Hong Kong airport for that matter) are absent. But what they do, they do very well. Their buns are tasty and very soft and fresh. Their standard dim sum fare is better than you would expect from an \\"order at the counter\\" place. Their shrimp stuffed eggplant gives me hope that there are a LOT of creative and tasty options worth coming back for. \\n\\nIt IS the McDonaldization of DimSum: The Americanization of DimSum. But to all you fine and traditional Hong Kongites, I say: lament not. But rather, rejoice that someone is spreading the cuisine, if not the tradition, well. Keep it not to yourself. Some day my kid may want to do a cultural exchange with someone in China (funny...like we have culture here....)and it just may be because of the flavors she experienced today. A place like Get Sum is GOOD for the world.\\n\\nLet me say that I am more excited about this place than I have been about a restaurant in Austin in quite some time. I am more likely to come back here before going to T&S for convenience, taste and price. And these days the Strollerman really APPRECIATES convenience.\\n\\nBottom line: I split about 25 really tasty pieces with my wife for about  $13 pp and didn't have to wait in a line (the lines WILL grow, believe me).  The only danger is that I may get burned out on Dim Sum too quickly.

There are several items on the menu that appear to be vegetarian or vegan. We ordered a flatbread that was not supposed to have meat and a falafel wrap. After eating a piece of the flatbread I noticed something that looked like chicken. After further investigation we realized that a few pieces of random chicken had made their way into our flatbread. I called the waitress over and she spoke with the chef, who was very non chalant about the whole thing and said he must have dropped a few on by mistake. She apologized and said \\"Hopefully the next time you come in this won't happen\\". When I ordered the wrap I asked if there was any dairy on it because I am vegan and the waitress said no. The sauce was obviously yogurt.

I had previously been to Tin Shed on a weekend and after an absurd hour wait for breakfast I enjoyed one of the most delicious breakfasts I had ever had.  Even though the  wait had sucked, I thought the food quality had been worth it.  So much so, that I decided to bring an out of town guest there recently.\\n\\n We decided to go on a weekday to avoid a long wait and I brought my dog because they are supposedly \\"dog friendly.\\"  We got there and signed the check in and there were 3 names ahead of us.  Fine.  40 minutes later, after many people who had JUST arrived were seated before us, we were finally seating.  They told us that they were \\"waiting for a good spot for the dog.\\"  Now when they only have about 8 tables available to seat and if a dog can only go at certain ones, I would have left my dog at home had I known.  Also, my dog is about 8 pounds so I'm uncertain how she can really be an obstacle in anyone's way.  \\n\\nWe placed our drink and food order and fought out hunger until our meals arrived.  The people next to us (who were seated right before us) received their food before our drinks had even been delivered.  Finally, our waitress came up and said that they had lost our order and needed to start over. Now I was getting angry.  We gave our order again and our drinks finally came.  After waiting some MORE, our food came and I have to say, the food did not taste as wonderful as it did the first time.  I'm not sure if they have different cooks weekends or weekdays or they rushed our order without giving it the love it deserved, but it was just not very good.

This is a pleasant option. Several big TV's tuned to sports, both inside and outside. \\n\\nService is friendly and helpful. \\n\\nConvenient location off Dresden in Brookhaven. \\n\\nCons:\\n\\nOverpriced for what it is. Almost all of their rolls range from $12 to $20. They are all \\"special\\" rolls....but nothing to write home about. Just \\"okay\\" in terms of quality and value. They don't have regular rolls (like basic tuna roll, yellow tail, etc.), which would provide better value and options. In general, portions are small. Bill for two fairly unremarkable special rolls, one small order of pan fried dumplings and two soft drinks: $66.\\n\\nService is painfully slow.

Most of the venues wanted $$$$ just to have the room. Beacon Street Tavern only asked for a $600 deposit and that would be applied to food!!  I contacted the manager and through a series of emails, and phone calls I was able to have one of the best parties ever--30+ people, our own room, our own bar, and it ended up costing $650 (includes tax and tip) for the best appetizers. They have a huge private function appetizer menu all made at the Tavern .  The general managers, first Paul and later JC, were outstanding and went overboard to accommodate me. At the last minute, JC even volunteered to go get balloons because a sister-in-law thought they would be nice. As it got closer to game time I was on the phone with JC, or emailed him, about two times a week.

Elements such as seasoned popcorn and pickled veggies added unique textures and flavors unexpected with a classic tartare. The lamb Agnolotti stole the show with two perfectly seasoned and tender lamb \\"patties\\" and a beet ravioli topped with mushrooms in a savory brown sauce.

Cozy, dark, a little bit sophisticated but warm & welcoming.\\n\\nI sat at the bar, and my bartender / server was fantastic.

Another guest stayed with his order, but it was too rare for his taste - but he didn't complain.  He rarely does.  We spend two hours there waiting on steaks and by the time we got them (medium rare and medium) we were full on baked potato and spinach.  Took them home in doggie bags.  Not why we came.  \\n\\nOur waiter was nice, but really slow (two hours?!) and smelled like cigarettes.  \\n\\nTo be fair, I come here about once a month and this is the first time this has happened.   They did take the two steaks off our bill, but it still came to $87.00 with only one drink.  Still, I would have rather paid and had a nice experience.  I was kind of embarrassed.  There are plenty of great steakhouses in Columbus.  I'll just have to start looking again."},{"name":"Hometown Oriental Gourmet Foods","address":"787 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the best Chinese food in Columbus.

I was in Orlando for a business trip and we wanted to find a nice place to have our dinner. There were many other steak houses and I looked at their menu's and we decided on going to Fleming's. The food was really good and the preparation was so wonderfully delivered. Good food can be purchased almost anywhere, what's important is to provide proper customer service. Great customer service only adds to the overall meal. In this case both customer service and the food were great.\\n\\nThis was my first time in a Fleming's and I really didn't know what to expect. There were four of us and we were going to go all out and get whatever we wanted. Between the four of us this is what we ordered.\\n\\n1x Pan Crusted Pork Belly\\n1x Shrimp Cocktail\\n1x Crab Cake\\n1x Sauteed Mushroom\\n1x Truffled Mashed Potatoes\\n1x Bone-In Ribeye w/ Truffle Lobster\\n1x Bone-In Ribeye w/ Diablo Shrimp\\n2x Wagyu New York Steak w/ Truffle Lobster\\n4x Creme Brulee\\n1x Chocolate Lave Cake\\n1x Bottle Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc\\n1x Bottle Pascual Toso Malbec\\n\\nWhen we arrived the place wasn't too busy and we were 15 minutes early. They seated us immediately and we ordered some cocktails and beer. Jessica, our server, came by to serve us and took our appetizers. \\n\\nThe pan crusted pork belly was just done perfectly. It has a great sear and nice crisp to the bite. It was served with a sweet and dark chutney accompanied by very creamy grits. It added to the texture and taste of the pork belly. \\n\\nThe crab cakes were huge. You'd get good sized chunks of crab in every bite. If you like crab they are definitely worth ordering.\\n\\nThe shrimp cocktails were huge. Who doesn't like shrimp cocktail? Nothing special but they were good.\\n\\nMy co-workers ordered the bone-in ribeye and I got the wagyu. My co-worker gave me a nice slice of his ribeye for comparison to my wagyu and I must say... His ribeye was good (I got the outer cut next to the fat for the most flavor) and even then they wagyu was better. I gave him a slice of wagyu and he was regretting his choice. I'd say the wagyu was consistent all the way through. I was so full but still managed to eat the entire thing. When ordering the steaks they asked up for we wanted them as well and how they were seared. We all got them \\"rare plus\\" (which was between rare and medium rare) and had them do the classic sear on the griddle (which I feel is the best way to finish off any steak). The sear was perfect, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. The lobster companion was very good. It came has half a tail and it was topped with some caviar. Maybe I'm just a fatty but I was hoping for a whole lobster tail.\\n\\nAfter the main entrees were done we ordered desert. I love creme brulee so I ordered one. Everyone else decided to get one too so we ordered 4. Jessica recommended the lava cake so we said sure why not. The creme brulee was definitely worth it. The lava cake was up to you. The fudge or chocolate had a hint of salt so if you dig the whole salt and bitter (dark chocolate) then this is a good dish. I liked it but my co-workers, not so much.\\n\\nWe have a Fleming's here in the Bay Area too so at least I can relive this dinner if I ever wanted to."},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I went to Hudson Grille to watch the Jones vs. Evans MMA fight.

I asked her to change the channel to the fight station and then turn the volume up so we could hear the commentary, and I ordered food and drinks and although it got very busy, she never broke a sweat or lost her patience.  She was awesome.  \\n\\nI had a couple of their $5 Pinnacle vodka martinis; they were very sweet and not very strong but what could I expect for $5?  I also ordered the pretzel sticks which were more like bread sticks from an italian restaurant with rock salt.  The would definitely disappoint a pretzel bread lover.  I also had an order of lemon pepper wings which were decent along with some tater tots that were super crispy and not greasy at all - they were perfect.  \\n\\nI don't know if it's because it was a fight night and sure to have men gathered but some of the women were seriously swanked out, like sexy fake-Herve-bandage dress swanky.

We waited a few minutes with no regard from our waitress.  My husband eventually approached our server asking for our rice. She brought out two of the rice orders but seemed to imply that someone had taken the fried rice that had been ordered and started to jet away from the table again.

I approached it with a grain of salt. I sent in my order on an odd automated submission form on their website. See above! I also was a bit hesitant because the pricing was astronomical. My worst nightmare was fulfilled when I actually put my order in for delivery: I was out of the delivery zone. I was going into this with the worst expectations.\\n\\nI was sent an email that said that they would accommodate my order, even though I was far out of the delivery zone. Then, they told me that I would be OK to receive the time that I wanted, roughly 12:30PM for lunch--they deliver HOT AND FRESH! This is just the start of the brownie points.\\n\\nOn the day that I had scheduled delivery, I was actually at a doctor's appointment, worried that my roommates would not be home to receive the order. Luckily, they were. And the delivery girl, who they said was very nice, passed my order off to them.\\n\\nNow, $26 does seem outrageous for 4 12 oz. soups... but let us consider. They deliver it to you HOT, leaving you with not a worry besides if you are going to get off of the couch to answer the door. Heck, you don't even need to microwave the dang things. And, they even supply you homemade focaccia!\\n\\nI will get to the main attraction, the soups. The yam curry had an abundance of fantastic spice. The texture was a perfect, thick puree. The streak of tomato balanced well into the earthy sweetness. I even got a clove in my mouth... and I mean that in the best way possible. The cream of asparagus was my least favorite, but it was just because I like my soups outrageously creamy. This one was certainly on the lighter side, with a tad too much salt. The butternut squash was smooth and provided a touch of sweetness; honestly some of the best often-hated-root soup ever. The lentil vegetable coconut curry was extremely hearty. I did not get much coconut or curry flavor, but the chunks of tomato and the well stewed pulses were great.\\n\\nThe focaccia was very fluffy and perfect to crumble into your soup. It was a little dry, and I would have preferred some herbs. Nonetheless, fantastic starchy staple to pair with the liquid-based meals.\\n\\nAnother surprise: I saw an envelope next to my order. They print out the ingredients of your exact order, even the bread! I just counted; the lentil offering had the most ingredients, coming in at 11... the catch is the most processed ingredient is \\"red curry!\\" Talk about pure and fresh!\\n\\nAgain, $26?

I only tried the Baja and Swordfish and I'd recommend both.\\n\\nI was torn by how to rate this establishment I would give it a 3.5 if I could, the food was OK meh good but nothing really stood out to me.

WTF! They aren't supposed to do that as it's against the agreement that they made with the credit card company and that alone is enough reason to keep me out...passing the charge onto the customer is a sleazy move and I typically walk right out when someone tells me that but I was hungry so I sucked it up. \\nI'm not sure why I did though because this is the kind of place that feels dirty when you walk in...i don't know if they clean it or not but it's in need of a major overhaul because it has that look like it's been cleaned but can never get clean if you know what I mean...like a bathtub in an apartment building that's been neglected year after year. Ewe! \\nThen there is the food...talk about uninspired, Sodexo everything. You'll never hear or see the word \\"fresh\\" or \\"homemade\\" attached to anything on their menu because it all probably comes from a can. I just had a cheeseburger sub and it was nasty. Frozen, unflavored, dry beef (I hope it was beef...I couldn't tell) and as if the food wasn't insult enough, I had to pay $10 for it (and a soda I didn't want). Ugh!

Our server for the evening is sweet and attentive, checking up on us throughout our meal and quite friendly.\\nFor starters we begin with the Crab Hush puppies ($7) a twist on the traditional hush puppy appetizers, made with charred corn, bacon, and served with a orange-habenero aioli.\\n\\nSteak Frites ($24), is a porcini marinated flat-iron steak served with their signature truffle fries and tarragon aioli. The steak was tender and grilled perfectly with a warm outside and a cool red inside, just the way I like it. Truffle fries are basically like shoestring french fries with a hint of truffle mushrooms. The tarragon aioli sauce that accompanies the dish was very unique and all in all the dish was very creative.\\n\\nOverall I definitely enjoyed my meal at The Ravenous Pig. I would come back just to check out their menu and all the creativity that they put into it. It's surprisingly refreshing to see such ingenuity in their dishes and I wish more Central Florida restaurants practiced this philosophy, although I do have reservations about their pricing. I would want to come back to try their Pub Burger ($12) since its pretty cheap hah.\\n\\nhttp://tastychomps.blogspot.com/2009/11/ravenous-pig-winter-park-florida.html"},{"name":"Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant","address":"343 N Front St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Stuffed shells were the best I had.

The food was actually very good, but the service was not up to par with what Portland has to offer.  After being seated, our hostess never brought menus as she said she would.  Luckily a couple at a different table left after not being served, so we took the menus from their table.  After about 15 minutes without service a waiter arrived and asked if we had ordered drinks yet.  When we indicated we had not, he asked for them without apology.  One of us ordered bottomless mimosas, but don't let the adjective fool you - multiple wait staff walked by without acknowledging our presence or asking if we needed a refill.  Luckily our waiter checked in on us when we were more than halfway done with our meals and agreed to get another refill upon our request.\\n\\nThe food was admittedly very good (we had the Florentine omelet and classic benedict), not to mention we were given complimentary donuts that were very tasty.

Just to note - I probably would not go there by myself, even during the day, the walk from the subway stop to the restaurant (about 4 or 5 blocks)  was pretty interesting.  The place is fairly small, also a lot of people will be there waiting for their takeout when you think they might just be waiting for a table.  Basically you gotta just keep a look out and wait until a table frees up and take it... there is no waiting list.

I went in today (a Sunday) and the first thing that I noticed was that the line was almost out the door. Now, it is important to note that there were absolutely no people sitting at any tables, so clearly there is no reason for them to be that backed up. The line ended up taking forever...I have never seen a slower Chipotle in my life (and I have been to many Chipotles in various cities). For a point of comparison, I used to frequent a Chipotle in Pittsburgh that regularly had lines out the door because they were absolutely slammed by health workers at lunch time. The difference between here and there is that the line out the door took about half the time at the Pittsburgh one as it did here in Quincy. I saw absolutely no urgency on the part of the staff. One of the girls just kind of stood over by the drink machines wiping things down and didn't seem to get until 5 minutes later that it would be a smart idea to come over and help with the register (since there was no one at the register). Maybe it just seems like common sense to me since I have worked in multiple food service jobs, but apparently not. The guy asking about cheese and sour cream proceeded to put mounds of each on my burrito even after I told him I wanted a little of both, at which point he zoned out and I had to say it 3 times for him to respond and take some off. As for the food itself, the burrito was very dry compared to other Chipotles and I struggled to get through it because of the ridiculous amount of sour cream.

I also ordered a side of fries and a large drink.  I was told my wait would be about 10-15 minutes and to make myself comfy.  It was kinda hard to do this since the place was so empty.  You could tell that it's kinda new since there's very little decor, and the place just feels empty.  I'd like to note that the cups that are provided for the ketchup dispenser are entirely too small.\\n\\nSo after about 12 minutes, I get my meal and it looks great!  I'd like to note here that I'm about to tear into my burger and the older couple is still waiting for their food.  I taste the fries;  salty and previously frozen.  Not impressed.  Oh well, it happens.  I assemble my burger and take my first bite and I am impressed.  The roll is hearty, and the meat is beefy.  I take another bite.  Salt.  I've never experienced a salty beef patty before, but I got it.  I felt like my blood pressure increased a bit from all the salt in this meal.  But I finished it and was left with a strange emptiness.  I had high hopes for this trip, and this restaurant.  Sadly, I do not see them lasting very long unless they make some pretty amazing changes; they're in a location that demands excellence.\\n\\nTo finish my side note, I was done eating my entire meal and the older couple still hadn't received their food.  At one point, that young lady that helped me earlier came over to them, handed them a gift card and said \\"Sorry for your wait.\\"  They had to have been waiting a minimum of 20-25 minutes for their food, and the gentleman was getting visibly anxious to either leave or get his food.  I'm pretty sure a gift card is not the thing that they were wanting.  I forgot to mention that this was at 7pm on a Monday night.  That's inexcusable.  There's nothing on the menu that would have caused them to have to wait that long for their food.  And lackluster food, at that.\\n\\nI would probably rate this closer to 2.5/5 instead of 3, but that's not a function on this site.

The decor, menu and obviously the prices are upscale, but there was a weird mismatch between that and the customers. \\n\\nThe service was non-existent. The lone bartender was also waiting all the tables, and he seemed to have no experience whatsoever in that department. Every request took forever.

The dressing on the salad was very good, as were the edamame in it. But the burger? Meh. The meat was overcooked and lacked flavor. The pancetta was also overcooked but more flavorful. I couldn't even taste the cheese, onions, butter lettuce or tomato in there. The bun was soft but I've had better. Nothing about this burger made me swoon.

Hearty and flavorful, it's like a French take on vegetarian Italian wedding. I loved the tuna tartare, but thought the Salade de Tomate was just eh.

I was always prevented by not having a reservation and the fact that it is one of the more expensive places on Disney property.  Finally, I had an opportunity with a friend armed with a discount and gift cards to try it out.   Besides the fact that it is one of Disney's Signature restaurants, the location makes it a little easier to get a reservation then the others, being out of the way at the Wilderness Lodge.  I was able to secure a reservation for 6:30 pm for a party of 3 without much issue.   We got there a little early and had a drink at the Territory Lounge to wait for our table, which took about 15 minutes after check in.  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself was beautiful, and gave a feeling that I was dining in the Pacific Northwest with beautiful woodwork throughout with high open air spacious ceilings.  One thing that struck as a little off was that we seemed to have 2 servers.  They would come by one at a time and talk to us, but for the most part they seemed to have no idea the other already took our orders or such.  Even with the extra help, the food did take some time, which was the only down side of the whole experience.  We go out to eat together frequently and most of the time we get different dishes so we can share and sample as much as possible which we chose to do here.  The bread service was a nice wheat bread with a sea salt butter.  Nothing too fantastic, but it hit the spot while waiting for the appetizers.  \\n\\nAfter a while of waiting and eating bread, our appetizers began to arrive.  My friend ordered the Bouillabaisse, which in this case was a Floridian seafood citrus stew that featured squid, little neck clams, and mussels, and was ladled over charred artisan bread.  Both of our waiters raved about the house specialty Smoked Mushroom Bisque which is made of oyster mushrooms, so his girlfriend decided to give it a try.  Lastly, my love of seafood made me go for the Pacific Ahi Tuna.  With its complements of avocado, thai chili aioli, nori, and rice crisps this dish looked more like a work of art than food.   I have to say all of the dishes were plated well and tasted fantastic.  The only issue was a dirty clam from the bouillabaisse, which was filled with sand.  The chef sent out 4 more to replace the one.  My favorite, hands down, was the mushroom bisque.  I have been just getting into soups and bisques are my favorite.  This one had wonderful taste and was nice and creamy earning its rave reviews from the staff.  \\n\\nNow came the main course of the meats, which Artist Point is known for.  This part took forever for us to order.  Every time you second glanced the menu you would change your mind.  My friend ordered the 14 oz. Veal Tomahawk Chop with a harissa vinaigrette, petite potatoes, and garden herbs. I was originally going to go for this but backed off once I saw aged items on the menu, which is my favorite style of preparing meat.  First that caught my eye was the Aged Buffalo Loin.  I passed on this for a few reasons.  First being that buffalo can sometimes be dry if cooked too long. Secondly I really didn't like what it came with, which was wheat berry risotto, smoked carrots, root spinach, summer beans, wheat grass, and jus.  None of that seemed to pleasing to me, but his girlfriend decided to give it a try.  The other aged meat was the 10 oz. Aged Prime Strip Loin, accompanied by new potatoes, roasted carrots, watercress, and a herb vinaigrette.  This was the dish that was meant for me.   I tried everyone's dishes and in my opinion the aged strip was my favorite.   Don't get me wrong, the others were great as well.  That was just my preference. The veal was tender and succulent just as I expected it to be and the buffalo actually was not dry at all or too gamey.  All of the dishes tasted superb, and if the menu does not change I will have an even harder time choosing the next time I visit.  \\n\\nAs usual, last came dessert and despite being stuffed to the gills and one step away from a food coma, two of us decided that we could not turn it down.  I got pulled into the inevitable Vanilla Bean Cr√®me Brulee trap.  I have a love-hate relationship with this.  I had my first one on my college internship and fell in love ever since, but they are very hit or miss.  Sometimes they are excellent and I savor each spoon full whereas other times, they are runny and very mundane, lacking flavor and the right texture in the caramelized sugar.  This one was thankfully delicious.  It came with heirloom apples slices, fig, and had bee pollen sprinkled on it.   I never knew that I liked fig, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried it.  The other couple shared a dessert but to be truthful with you, I have no idea what it was.  I was too lost in the greatness of mine.  I can tell you one thing is that it had chocolate, was green for some reason, and it tasted good according to them.

I'm a little confused because its called \\"Teriyaki House\\" but most items on the menu have nothing to do with teriyaki and are not Japanese.  \\n\\nEverything on the menu is under $10.  They don't have a \\"lunch menu\\" so you might need to ask about what menu items are eligible for the lunch deal.  Their stir-fries, lo-meins, fried rices, and teriyakis are all available with choice of hot+sour soup or egg drop soup for $6.50.  I ordered the chicken stir-fry and my friends ordered the beef lo-mein and scallion pancakes.\\n\\nScallion pancakes were way better than I expected.  There are many different ways to make scallion pancake, but this one was cripsy (not greasy and thick) and came a sweet soy sauce.  \\n\\nMy stir-fry was fine.  Came in a HUGE portion, with lots of chicken/broccoli/snow peas.  I liked that they didn't fill the whole plate with rice.  I don't believe there is a way to make outstanding chicken stir-fry.  It was good for what it was. The same goes for the beef lo-mein.  It was also HUGE.  It wasn't over-loaded with soy sauce, which was good.  Again, there isn't really a way to make great lo-mein while only charging $6.50.  The lunch special can EASILY be used for 2 meals.  \\n\\nI would say that their egg drop and hot+sour soup were really good though.  Way better than they would be at the average chinese takeout place.  \\n\\nIf I go again I wouldn't get stir fry or lo-mein again.  I would try their teriyaki or their baobaos.  Stir-fry and lo-mein are very standard Chinese take-out dishes and I'm never in love with them.  But so many place mess up these basic dishes.  At least teriyaki house did them right.  \\n\\nFor a place that primarily does takeout, the interior is actually pretty nice.  Clean and bright.  The service is also pretty good.

For an AYCE connoisseur, as I am self-proclaimed, they are an inefficient means to a full stomach. However, Hot Pot Buffet manages to excel due to 2 key factors: 1) there is a paucity of AYCE Chinese restaurants in Boston; 2) they serve really quickly.\\n\\nThe venue has 2 floors. The first floor has both individual and small party seating. Individual seating is in a U-shaped table, which is actually pretty fun for groups, as each person has his own hot pot. Upstairs, there is seating for larger parties.\\n\\nRather than a buffet, patrons are provided with a paper menu with check boxes. Simply check off the items you want, and write the desired number of portions next to each. I recommend that the average person orders 5 different items - 1 portion each - to start off with.\\n\\nSo here is the process for those who are new:\\n1. choose broth\\n2. choose items\\n3. choose noodles\\n4. put seafood in broth first\\n5. cook meat and noodles last (place in the spoon with drains for easy collection)\\n6. feast\\n\\nWhat I like to do after cooking is make a noodle soup with the bowl they provide. Also, they give a dipping sauce for the meat. If you want an extra kick, ask for ginger and scallions. It will come on a small dish, and you would only have to mix it in with the dipping sauce.\\n\\nBeef and seafood lovers will benefit the most here. I recommend the choice prime and the sirloin. Also, get dumplings and various balls (eg: fish, shrimp, cuttlefish). Other seafood options include salmon and crab. Chicken is unfortunately rather dry here, so unless you do not eat beef, save your belly room for other sources of protein.\\n\\nNon-meat eaters still have plenty of options. There is an assortment of vegetables to select from, various types of mushrooms, bamboo, tofu, fried gluten, etc. \\n\\nFor broth, I recommend spicy. It actually is not very spicy, and it is the most flavorful broth they have. The house special broth is unremarkable.\\n\\nIf you want a sweet drink to complement the meal, I recommend the Red Milk Tea.

It was priced at a reasonable (for a mid-scale burger joint) price of $10 including fries or a salad.  \\n\\nI have to ding them a little bit for aggravating a pet peeve of mine - they have a \\"Kobe burger\\" on the menu.  I'm not clear why places feel it is ok to call something Kobe when it isn't Kobe beef.  And if they actually were able to somehow get real Kobe beef why waste it on a burger?!?!?!  But I digress.  \\n\\nThe burger was square (reminding me of good old White Castle - in shape only  though of course).  The pancetta was a round nicely crisped slice on top of the rich slice of melted Guinness cheddar.  The cheddar provided a nice colour pattern from the Guinness interspersed with the cheese.  The patty, which was very juicy and moist, was cooked just right, was well seasoned and had a nice beefiness to it.  It was served on top of slightly sauteed onions (not mentioned on the menu) and a leaf of butter lettuce.  The bun was brioche and had a thin layer of chipotle aioli to give a bit of spice.  I would have preferred the bun to be a little smaller to get a better beef to bun ratio.   But I'm nitpicking.  This was a very good burger.

We've eaten at this location twice and the reason I'm giving it two stars is the slow service.  The first time we were here the service was glacially slow, so slow that we missed an event we were planning to attend later that day.  (We were there around 2pm & the place was almost empty so it wasn't a case that they were busy.)  The second time (which was months later) we went because our friends wanted to go and we weren't pressed for time.  Any place can be off once so we usually give a place at least two tries before we cross it off the list.  Unfortunately things were not improved.  The service was better this time but it still took a long time to get our food and to get our bill.   On the plus side we had a nice visit with our friends while we waited.

Outdoor patio bar type seating, and inside more formal seating. The dress is casual however. Outside there is live music and a noisy bar atmosphere. Inside is quiet. We had dinner inside. First thing I noticed were the flys. The manager said because the doors are always open to the patio that the flys come in. This concerned me a bit because the kitchen was open to the dining room so the flys could land on the food prep areas as well as our tables. I ordered a beet salad and paella, my husband ordered the calamari, lobster bisque and a filet mignon. Calamari came out first. Quite tasty. His soup next. Not bad. Then our dinner arrived. My beet salad was forgotten. The manager apologized and brought one out. (I wish I hadn't) it was terrible. I adore beets, however this strange salad combination did NOT work. Very bland, mozzarella balls on top with brown avocado chunks, grapefruit and mandarins mixed with a very subtle blueberry vinaigrette. Skip it. My paella tasted good. Muscles, clams, large shrimp, chunks of fish topped with a few fried calamari (like the appetizer we just had) in yellow rice. Seafood only. No chicken or other proteins. Rice was a little over cooked but overall it tasted flavorful. My husband's filet mignon came on a slab of polenta and topped with an orange colored garlic sauce and piece of kale. The sauce had separated and had a clumpy consistency. Too oily and too much garlic. The filet was not thick or tender. He ordered it medium. It came medium well to well done. $45 price was completely overpriced for what he received. Unfortunately, our local national chain steakhouse provides a better quality filet. It's disappointing to pay that much and not be totally delighted with your steak. It should be a $20-$25 price point. We both drank diet soda and did not have dessert. Our bill was over $100. I'm not sure how they justify the high prices. In our opinion, it was very overpriced for what we received. Service was ok. Waiter disappeared most of the night and we had to wave him down for soda refills. If we ever return, I'd order a burger. The people next to us got four burgers.

Actually, it's always been a good experience and I've now dined here probably a dozen times in the past 2 years.\\n\\nFood - The Ravenous Pig has a variable menu and with some essential items staying consistent. The menu does not have an overwhelming number of choices on their menu, but enough variety to be able to choose from. The ingredients are said to be locally sourced and they always taste fresh and well prepared. Charcuterie is a must here and it's something my group has EVERY time we dine there. \\n\\nDrinks - drafts on tap are a flat $6, cocktails are $12. the bartenders know what they're doing here so you can't go wrong with any of the cocktails.\\n\\nService - This restaurant understands service as being an important part of the dining experience and trains their staff extremely well. I can't recall dining here where the service was bad or inattentive.\\n\\nAmbience - The restaurant, again, is versatile for any occasion. There's a good mix of people who are dressed in different levels, noise level is average to low. I've celebrated my own birthday at this restaurant, girlfriend's graduation, dinner before a concert, casual Saturday lunch. Maybe not a tuxedo restaurant, but short of that, you shouldn't feel out of place.\\n\\nBang for the Buck - This is, by no means, an inexpensive meal. You can get away with a $20-30 meal if you just went with an entree, or you could easily spend $100/person. I would argue the experience and the food is worth the price but to some people, no food is worth a certain price.

The main entree portion was a very large piece of pre-sliced pork tonkatsu that was fried to a very nice golden brown exterior while maintaining a delicious juicy interior. They were also very generous with the bowl of rice that goes with your meal. You put down that entire set meal and you feel like you're about to be put down for a nice long afternoon nap. The rest of my family got the Gyu Don, Eel Rice, and Curry Katsu. All of their portions were equally generous. For me, I felt like for the price I paid, the portion sizes were more than sufficient. Based on my personal experience, I'm inclined to say (and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt) that this place has hopefully turned over a new page compare to some of the prior reviews that I read. Like every restaurant that I go to where I had a pleasant experience, I really hope they succeed in the long run. But only time will tell, and maybe a second review of the place if I ever find myself in the location again. But in the meantime, I hope they strive and desire for excellence."},{"name":"Wasabi House","address":"5500 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't judge a restaurant by the way it looks this is true for wasabi house.\\nThe sushi is very fresh and the rolls range from 10-13 dollars. \\nThis just became my favorite place for rolls in Atlanta.

When we inquired about what glasses were on happy hour, our server (I believe it may have been a manager, actually) acted a little put out and mentioned that it was barely still happy hour (we still had a good half an hour) when showing us the two by-the-glass options for $5/glass. Later he came back and apologized saying he thought it was later than it was, which was nice, and did at least provide the happy hour menu and we ordered a $5 appetizer apiece. \\n\\nPossibly because of that, our server (now another person) must have assumed we were just there on the cheap. We were asked if we'd like another glass of wine and when we said yes, the server just went and got us one of the same, before we had a chance to indicate if we wanted to get another glass of *something else.*\\n\\nAfter our second glasses, we were offered dessert and after turning that down, our checks were brought just as we'd drained the glasses and a good 20-30 min before I'd intended to leave. No mention of another glass, refill of water, dinner, etc. was made by the server. \\n\\nIt was pretty clear that we were perceived to be taking up a valuable table that they'd like to fill with someone else who was going to have a bigger tab. It's just really disappointing that taking advantage of the great happy hour values results in that kind of attitude. Too bad for them, as I had my eye on several other glasses, and would also probably have gone home with a bottle or two of my favorites. \\n\\nI'll keep going to Wine Bistro because they have great offerings and it's a nearby wine bar that my neighborhood very much needs, and I'll hope that maybe next time we're treated like the regulars and wine lovers that we are."},{"name":"The Comet Pub & Lanes","address":"2619 N Decatur Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"Poor service in various ways (i.e. people ignoring us at the bar, long lane turnover times leading to prolonged wait times).

Sometimes the frosting/cream on a bad pie can be too sweet or disgusting, but they've gotten it just right here. The cream topping was light and fluffy with a little bit of cinnamon flavor. The actual banana filling was also very good. My only complaint is that the ratio of cream to filling seemed a bit too skewed towards the former. \\n\\nMy friends order the coconut cream and chocolate cream, which I also tried. The coconut was flat out amazing. If I'm ever in town again, you can bet that I'll stop by to get another slice.

I have only tried it twice. The first time me and my mom came here, we tried it because everyone always had great things to say about it. We got the Chicken Alfredo, and it was so extremely bland. Also they have FAKE Parmesan cheese (servers don't grind the cheese onto your plate, it is like store bought). How are you going to claim that you're authentic with fake cheese?\\n\\nWe waited almost a year to try it again, and the only reason we did was because my dad was convinced from everyone else that this place was great (he'd never tried it before). Well he shortly understood what we meant by it not being good. We got just basic meatballs and spaghetti, and again BLAND. The most basic Italian dish. The sauce was watery, had little to no flavor, and we're pretty sure the \\"sauce\\" was just a can of crushed tomatoes. We decided to order the Mount Vesuvius, which is a chocolate molten lava cake. It was so dry that it was comical. We almost paid 13 bucks for a dessert that was absolutely terrible. (I say almost because we sent it back). We will NEVER return here again. Spaghetti Warehouse is so much better, and much cheaper.\\n\\nOh and another thing that is crappy about this place is that it's \\"family dining\\". So you can't order your own individual entrees. They have either a small entree (that's meant for up to 3 people), or a large (meant for 5). So unless you have a big party I would venture elsewhere (personally I would venture elsewhere anyways).\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because our service was good for how busy it was.

I almost wished my plate had been only full of enchiladas and nothing else!\\n\\nBut where did they lose some points in the latin food loving heart of mine? Their rice and beans. Just blah.

The chicken & waffle tenders were a thumbs down due to the bland taste of the tenders. The lump crab meat mushrooms were a winner & this comes from the crab cake connoisseur! My friend enjoyed the asparagus. Now the cocktails were on point & refreshing! I had the mango pineapple martini & uptown daiquiri & was satisfied. There was also live music that kicked-off @ 6 PM.

Many old favorites like mashed potatoes or grits were no where to be found. The desert bar was similar to that of a Chinese buffet. No longer is there a chocolate fountain on display either.  Another casualty of new ownership is the pianist. The pianist was replaced by a group playing folksy music on a banjo. It was really loud considering the small space.

I have been feeling pretty ill for the past 24 hours. \\n\\nDespite the salad, I'm sticking with 3 stars because the service was good, and I feel like I probably just got the wrong meal. My boyfriend had a chicken special and it was fantastic. I would give it another shot, but it's not my favorite place (yet???)."},{"name":"Kanji Ramen","address":"12636 Research Blvd, Ste C101","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Authentic as they come.
